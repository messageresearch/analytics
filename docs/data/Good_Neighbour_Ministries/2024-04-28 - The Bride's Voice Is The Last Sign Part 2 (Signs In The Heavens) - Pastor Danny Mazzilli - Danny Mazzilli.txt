God this morning that's that's for sure and I believe um by the time we get to the end of this service you'll understand just on how on time he is amen praise God you know we serve a supernatural Living God Amen that's the one thing that um that uh has differentiated each and every one of your walks is because you didn't just join a church you didn't just happen stance into this ministry um you know and not just saying in just this church I'm talking about the mystical Supernatural body of Jesus Christ it's a reality it's a living living manifestation of God in this day and in this hour and if you can come into contact with that you your life is is never going to be the same amen and this I can say with all Assurance amen God bless you welcome into the house of the Lord this morning um before we go to the baby dedication uh just a few comments next Sunday how many knows we have a visiting Minister next Sunday praise God so you want to be in prayer you want to believe that the Lord is going to uh do something whenever uh ministers are coming through we want um we want to we want to see the supernatural we want to see God speak we want to know that uh you know that uh this is something that um you know like an evangelist when he comes by uh they don't know anything they just come and whatever God lays on their heart then that's what he brings and you know sometimes that can be a real tremendous blessing so I you know I'm under great expectation I hope you are Amen brother um uh amard Muhammad that's uh sister farid's brother who is the assistant Minister out in Trinidad with uh brother Pastor Albert green amen praise God so don't forget that give if you can to support that aspect of the ministry we always always um make sure that uh when the Lord sends ministers uh they're worthy of their hire amen and so whatever you can give if it's a dollar that's fantastic if it's 20 that's great whatever we want to be able to give amen glory to God and so we also have our upcoming uh special meetings that are coming June 7th to the 9th you've been receiving emails on that we want to know who's going to be attending the uh celebration dinner on the Sunday night okay so we'll need to know uh you know numbers um there's going to be a uh a signup sheet at the back also where you can put your name and the number of uh adults and children that will be attending amen praise God we're looking forward to that also remember that in prayer it's coming quickly amen amen praise God and so at this time I would ask that uh sister hope and brother uh Jose would bring their child are they here Jose is not here yet okay all right um okay um do do we know where he is hope I'm sorry car oh he's parking the car okay perfect all right well let him come in because we definitely want to do that first okay you may be seated for a couple of minutes sorry to keep you st standing amen praise God um in the meantime we're still in the Passover season um you know there's lots that is happening um at this time in the world and we know that um you know Israel is God's time piece let them come right away as soon as they're here praise God and so um today we're going to be uh continuing um along the uh thought that we've been bringing over the last couple of services praise God and so right now we're going to go and change the order of the service let's just let's just sing that bring them in bring them in bring them in from the fields of sin bring them in bring them in bring the the wondering ones to Jesus oh let us bring them in bring them in bring them in from the fields of sin bring them in bring them in bring the wondering ones to Jesus praise God Amen today we have brother Jose and sister hope and our lovely little Leah Christine I believe praise God and we've got Grandma here to be a witness and um I'm just going to read quickly here from Psalms 127 it says except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it except the Lord keep the city The Watchman waketh but in vain it is vain for you to rise up early to sit up late to eat the bread of Sorrows for so he giveth his beloved sleep Lo children are inh Heritage of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward did you know that she's a reward to the both of you amen as Arrow are in the hand of a mighty man so are children of the youth happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate amen praise God in um in the book of Samuel uh verse um 1st Samuel 1 verse 26 six um I'm just going to read that quickly praise God chapter 1 verse 26 and this is about Hannah when you know she had received a child and she had been praying unto the Lord and she said oh my Lord as thy soul liveth my Lord I Am Woman I am the woman woman that stood by thee here praying unto the Lord for this child I prayed and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him therefore also I have lent him to the Lord as long as he liveth she liveth be lent to the Lord and she worshiped the Lord there and he worshiped the Lord there amen praise God today we uh are witnesses of a child that the Lord has given you into your home and today by you coming here you're making a declaration you're saying that that Leah Christine is a child that you want to give back to the Lord that you want to acknowledge that the Lord is is Lord and head and leadership in your life that her life is now something that you want to place into the safety of God's hands but her safety is in your hands at the same time in the way that you serve the Lord in the way that you dedicate yourselves as a husband as a wife as a mother and as a father will show the the the true faith that you have in really sincere wanting the Lord to place his hand over her life to watch over her every step to be there in her times of decision and eventually to make that decision where she herself will come to the Lord amen and so uh the dedication of a child to the Lord is an important statement by the parents and by the church family when we stand here together as as the children of God as the family of God we realize that it takes a village to raise a child and we're willing to do and to pray and to support those that are identifying themselves as a part of this local body amen and so uh god um you know and and so the parents are covenanting before God to raise their child to know to love and to serve the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise God and so at this time I'd like to dedicate the child unto the Lord I get a chance to hold the baby my wife says are you going to hold the baby I said absolutely praise God highly yeah oh what a nice smile praise God Amen let us pray father what a privilege it is Lord to hold life new life in our hands father and to know that that life was given by you Lord what an awesome marvelous Miracle this life is father and Lord as I hold Leah Christine in my hand oh God as your representative Lord I offer her unto you in the name of Jesus Christ that your hand of Mercy that your love that your protection that your guidance will be upon her her every breath Lord her first steps in life father in everything that concerns her oh God lord Jesus may your hand be upon her May the angels of God be encamped about her and Lord these parents that have identified themselves Lord to bring this child unto you I pray that that you will bless them that you will be with them that you will give them Lord leadership wisdom Lord a loving environment for this child Lord May their relationship grow in the unity of the spirit of God lord may they know that without you lord that it takes three to make a a true marriage Lord without you in their midst Lord there's there's very little hope in this world father that Lord is a world where it's tearing families apart but may your spirit so guide and direct this family in this home Lord that Lord you would look and be proud and you would be pleased with this family Lord bless them continue to move them direct them guide them Lord Prosper their way Lord whatever they have need of Father Lord we commit this family into your hands Lord Prosper them we pray and remember grandma and the the rest of the family and all the uh aunts and uncles and those Lord may they feel the joy and the and the spirit of Christ that moves in and around this child and this family Lord granted we pray We Love We Appreciate You Lord and we commit this child Christina Lee Leah Christina into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name [Applause] amen congratulations congratulations sister congratulations and there's your uh certificate okay let's give them a round of [Applause] applause amen praise God so now we need to go to the word now I've got an unusual word today um it's going to uh possibly we're going to be here a little bit longer than we normally would but um as you know um in May the garden centers really take off and I'm going to be tied up there we have very able ministers actually next weekend we've got a visiting Minister then we've got Pastor Simon who will be stepping in on the 12th we've got brother Phillip who will be stepping in on the 19th we've got Pastor Simon again I believe 26th and then um and then then I should be back right around the beginning of June so um you know the lord has laid this message upon my heart over the last you know several weeks um so we want to get right into it I want to uh finish it today okay so I'm going to need your patience but if you come into the atmosphere of where we're going here today I believe you'll leave rejoicing amen I really do because um this is something that the Lord has certainly uh been dealing on my heart and um what I'm bringing to you today is all that that God has basically laid on my heart okay and I want to make it clear that you know there's going to be things that are going to be said here that um that I am not claiming any kind of you know the first to recognize this or to see this or to all I'm doing is what we're all doing we're walking with God amen amen and like I said right at the beginning this is a supern natural walk and if you're not seeing the supernatural in your walk then you need to dig deeper like you heard last weekend when the Lord was speaking to us we need to go deeper and and really get serious with our walk with God so that we can know assuredly who we are the hour that we're living in and what it is that God is doing in this day and in this hour amen praise God let's go to our first slide so we're going to continue along the same lines now it's going to go into another Direction but it's all surrounding signs in the heavens it's all about recognizing that God his first Bible was written in the heavens before he declares anything on the earth he declares it in the heavens in our last service we were looking at the cloud we're going to finish that and then we're going to be looking at God's perfect numerology okay that these things that have happened in our day that happened in the in the you know in the early 60s with William Mariam brandom in the in the visitation of the supernatural Cloud on Sunset Mountain was not just uh just another event it was a supernatural uh dimensional uh time changing uh uh dispensational changing event that the Earth was coming under and and was allowed to witness but it's not everybody that recognized it amen praise God and so when we look at everything we want to see it in the right perspective let's go to our first slide and let's read the scripture amen Luke chapter 21 25-28 let's all stand respects to the lord and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the Stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring men's Hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your Redemption dwth nigh let us pray father Lord you know everything that you have placed upon our hearts Lord we're we're going into areas of your word and we're believing in everything that you Vindicated and that you showed and that you came and confirmed through a a Vindicated prophet in the 20th century Lord we know that you are still the same yesterday today and forever you will never change what you did back then you are doing again today it's how you declare yourself it's how you make yourself known Lord we're asking that your anointing will come this morning Lord as a man I am weak but as your servant this morning as a yielded vessel I'm surrendering it to you Lord you can have absolute preeminence and you can do and speak the supernatural into the lives and into the hearts of your people that are here present and those that are listening online father Lord may you take absolute control you be The Interpreter Lord you be the one that vindicates you be the one that makes it real to each and every individual heart Grant it we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you may be seated next slide brother brandham speaking here in Christ is identified the same in all generations 1964 he says and then every sign has a voice behind it and the voice must be a scriptural voice okay so everything we're going to be looking at today I want you to bear that in mind okay that whatever we're looking at we're looking at the scripture God's word to to to to be the Vindication behind everything that we're bringing okay if there's going to be a voice it's got to be scriptural there's nothing that that I can bring as a man or that any Minister can bring as a man that of his own interpretation you see that's what they've done with all the rest of the denominational churches they've taken man's doctrines and man's teachings and man's interpretations on the word of God and by doing that Jesus said they've made the word of none effect to the people and so now signs happen things happen the supernatural takes place and people just keep on walking like nothing ever happened why because that's also scripture like Moses when he went down into Egypt the voice of the first sign the voice of the second sign and every great thing that happens with God that gives a sign there's a voice follows that sign like Jonah when he was delivered from the the belly of the whale that was a sign then his voice was repent or in 40 days you'll perish so there's always the voice going with the sign amen go to the next slide today we're going to be um continuing right along the thought that we had um and that the bride's voice in this hour and when I talk about the bride I'm talking about the church there's a church that's a church that's LED and directed by the Holy Spirit himself not a church that's directed and and led by man there is a real true church in this day and in this hour there's scattered all over the world okay and they're joining and they're getting together just like we are today we're not not the only church that's under this Supernatural leadership of the Lord himself the Lord himself but when the Lord comes just like he did back in the Old Testament you look at all the the the books of the Old Testament and all the prophets of the Old Testament when they stood before the people and stood there and said thus sayeth the Lord that was not the man the prophet that was God's voice in the prophet and so they were the voice for that time for that season and for that generation amen praise God and so God has always had a voice in every season in every time in every dispensation but it's it's not an easy thing to recognize his voice because his voice W it walks among the common people it moves among the common people and the common people will miss it most of the time just like they did when Jesus himself was here upon the Earth and so we're looking for that scriptural voice but brother Braham says here the seed shall not be a with the shuck message in 1965 Jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him and all that the father hath given me they will come he says they will come my sheep my doves they hear my voice okay a stranger they will not follow and what is the voice of God it's the word it's the word of God being manifest in the day and in the season that we're living in and what is the evidence that you actually have the spirit of God in you is when you can recognize the word that's being manifested and fulfilled right before your eyes amen God has a church God has declared there be a Rapture God has declared that there will be a people that will unite in the end time under the leadership and the voice of the Lord himself and it'll be his voice that she will recognize and that will transform her change her bring her under obedience under the leadership of the word for this day and and for this hour amen amen glory to God Amen God is dealing with this Earth and this generation at this time I want to repeat that God is dealing with this Earth this generation at this time you know a lot of people always want to be praising God for what he did back there and what he's going to do but they always you know most of the time fail to recognize what it is that he's doing right now and right now we've had signs and wonders that have been made uh available to us that that that are telling us things that are that are being declared in the heavens that are going to be manifest shortly here upon the Earth they're already in process as we read the scripture when it said when you see all these things coming to pass I don't know how much more is left I don't know how much more is left to be fulfilled before all of this culminates and we're going to be changed in the moment and in the twinkling of an eye do you know that we just experienced a couple of solar eclipses all right you know that the Earth is the only place in the universe that a full eclipse either solar or lunar is possible okay that just tells me that God is dealing with us this is the only place in the universe where where you can witness and and actually see a total so solar eclipse why because the sun is exactly 400 times larger than the moon and exactly 400 times further away from the earth and when the two of them based on that perspective it makes them look the same and God is speaking to us through that amen he's saying that the bride and the groom they are one when you see me he says you see the father he said all that was all that was in uh Christ was poured into the church amen and so when the moon gets in front of the Sun or the sun gets in front of the moon it's because they are declaring themselves to be one amen although there are other messages that are coming off these signs and we want to see the scriptural signs amen let's go to the next slide no not yet sorry I'll read a scripture in Psalms 19 verses 1 to5 it says the heavens declare the glory of God we're talking about the voice that follows the sign all right we're talking about a scriptural voice the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament show his handywork day unto Day utth speech and night unto night showeth knowledge there is no there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard their line is gone out through all the Earth and their words to the end of the world in them hath he set a tabernacle for the son which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race glory to God I believe he's speaking about the Bride of Jesus Christ right here there's nowhere where her voice is not going to be heard she's going to have the final say she's going to have the final voice she's going to be the one that's going to declare exactly what it is that God is doing in this particular generation and in this time and in this season amen praise God and so we rejoice in knowing that that God is is speaking about us everything that he needs to declare he's now going to declare it through his bride through his his church amen the Church of this day and of this hour everything that that I'm going to be bringing forth here today is what the lord has laid upon my heart I've had some Supernatural experiences with the Lord and I can tell you there's no way I could bring with conviction the things that I'm going to bring to you today unless I had those Supernatural experiences I'm not and let's get this clear here this is not about Pastor Dany bringing his experiences this is about uh us recognizing the things that God is doing in our day and that you have a part of it I have a part of it you're going to need to recognize where you fit into the whole place because by you recognizing where you fit you receive perfect Faith to live this message you will fall away if you do not have this kind of a supernatural walk with God Amen this is the kind of walk that if you don't experience Christ in the power of his resurrection in the day that you are living and you don't start to see Supernatural taking place around your life you are missing something this is going to be a a a supernatural event when the bride is taken off the Earth and we are already being changed we're we've already been raptured we've already been you know a lot of us have separated from our families and our and and our friends in the way that we used to you know be with them it's not that that we're trying to separate from them we're not we love them we want to be with them we want them to know but because God has placed his word in us to fulfill the word for this day then it's automatically going to happen that the the people around us they're going to think that we're kind of strange they're going to kind of find that what do you mean these Supernatural things what is it that you see in the heavens that we didn't see well just go back Jesus rebuked them he says you could see you know when when when the times were changing when this when the the the the the sun would CH you know the the the red sky in the morning would show that there was going to be you know uh rain and you can read the signs but then you cannot read the actual signs of the times the things that God is doing right here in your midst and so this is the thing that you know that that I want to make very clear here everyone must meet God personal amen there's absolutely nothing that I can do for you to to to make you see and experience the supernatural in the way that that I'm experiencing it and many of you are experiencing it you know when God speaks to you you know when God is directing you guiding you rebuking you directing your life amen you need to have that experience and when you know it's real nobody can take that away from you there's nobody on this planet amen go to the next slide now we looked at the church Church ages and we recognize and we declare that the church ages uh spiritually the church ages are over okay they're over so we're not looking for any other Messengers there's no there's no eighth human Earthly messenger amen okay the seventh Church age messenger was William Mariam brandham he fulfilled that and and that church age has come to an end we don't know if the Gentile dispensation has come to an end I'm not saying that it has and I'm not saying that it hasn't I'm just telling you that there is things happening right now that are declaring a an a supernatural change on the earth the world has gone into absolute gross Darkness Israel is under under some serious bombardment right now okay because it's it's a portion of the word that must be fulfilled okay just as as the as the true church she's going to be rejected in the same way she's not going to be accepted you know people are not going to just easily accept the fact that you belong to the true church not that you are the true church that Jesus Christ the body of Christ is the true church but because you've identified yourself with him and you've you've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you receed the Holy Ghost and your life is manifesting his life that's the evidence that Christ is in you amen and so the ages are over uh and you know here we are and if we look at you know that Leo deia was to be this the the the shortest Church age it places us right here in 2024 an observation that's it not saying that this year is the last year it's all going to end this year I'm I'm not saying that remember God is his own interpreter he will make it plain amen so let's go on now so I want to look here now at uh the fact that um prophecy is not something that we're taught okay prophetic events are not things that we are taught they are events and things that we that that that we catch they're not taught they're caught okay Proverbs uh 252 it says it is the glory of God to conceal a thing but the honor of Kings is to search out the matter and so when you get deep into God and when you start to really search God to find out what it is that he's doing in this day and in this hour you start to look deeper you start to search deeper and you know when you start to search in the way that I've been searching lately with these signs that have been taking place I can't help but see God God's Perfection everywhere amen God's perfect numerology everywhere it's everywhere it's in every aspect of this ministry in our lives personally and and and you're going to see here today that that this is not some coincidence all right let's go on so in the next slide we were looking at uh go to the next slide we were looking at the cloud and the supernatural uh uh High ring Cloud that showed up in in on May the 17th in the Life Magazine this actually took place February the 28 okay 1963 when it actually showed itself uh over sunset Mountain and what we want to bring to your attention Okay and this is going to be just f act okay that I'm bringing now and then we're going to see how the Lord unveils it all but this Supernatural Cloud it was something that that took place um and Life Magazine packed it and what we want to look at is the dates we want to look at how the dates you know coincide with a lot of uh different dates um and things that happened within the Bible amen now the first one that we know okay was before we go to that let's let's just um let's just go through these these slides one at a time okay and take note of these dates May 17th 1963 okay the the cloud was was uh was there and it showed itself in the heavens for about 28 minutes okay um in the evening time uh it was photographed in many different areas okay um it showed up in Life magazine and I actually have a copy you can go to the next slide I actually have the the the physical copy of this Life Magazine I I left it at home because I was going through it and it was just amazing what what I saw in there okay but um we're just going to look at at all these dates and I want you to see the res uh the the the timing on everything okay and it's going to lead us into more here okay so um the next slide okay these are just pictures of the actual magazine okay and then you can go to the next one okay now brother brandham speaking here in the Feast of the trumpets he says then one day in Sabino Canyon while God called me early in the morning up there I was up with my hands in the air praying and a sword came into my hands you know that I stood there and looked at it just natural as my hand is now not knowing what it meant and it was left and it was left me with a voice that said this is the sword of the king now this event that took place on February the 28 1963 was a supernatural event of the mighty angel God himself Christ himself coming down to meet with William Mary and brandham in order to give him the commission to go uh to to Jeffersonville where he was going to uh Minister and open the Seven Seals of the Book of Revelations okay but he had this Supernatural event that that he's sharing um where he where he was talking about and this is what's giving us the reason why this all took place and then later when the angel of the Lord revealed it it was the word in the hand immediately after that the angels of the Lord appeared and told about the Seven Seals that I was to return back here to Jeffersonville and preach the Seven Seals and there if ever said anything that was inspired it it was that there where the angel of the Lord met us and the Bible becomes a new Bible so here now I want you to understand that his commission was to go back to Jeffersonville and open the Seven Seals the supernatural Mysteries that were to be revealed and his ministry fulfilled Revelations 10 1 to 7 okay it was the introduction of the mighty Angel himself coming down in 1963 to meet with the body of Jesus Christ and so as we move along now uh we're going to go into the numerology and we're going to look at the timing of all these things now uh go to the next slide when we look at God's numerology we can see you know one is God you know who is G there's only one God two a witness three Perfection seven completion eight new day the law of the word uh 10 17 is a representation of Victory 24 worship and dedication life is 28 okay we're going to be seeing that number 28 very often here today okay because it represents a woman's cycle you know to bring forth life the 28 day cycle of a woman when she you know brings forth life and 30 you know uh calling the public Ministry King David Jesus Jesus and then there's other numbers that go on from there there's 40 uh you know which which is testing and then there's 50 which is Jubilee all right and so some of the things that we want to take a look at here okay is that God's numerology is perfect you know brother Bram says here he says the end time sign seed he says three is the number of perfection we all know that three is God's number in his numerology God is known by his numbers three is perfection seven is worship 24 is worship 40 is Temptation 50 is Pentecost jubile so forth all his numbers his numbers the his numerals of God is perfected and is perfection God is perfected in his numbers amen praise God and so there will always be some numbers okay that are going to stand out more and today I'm going to draw your attention to some numbers that are going to stand out a little more than others okay so let's go to the next slide okay I'm going to read here in Genesis 7: 11 to2 it says here in the 600th year of Noah's life in the second month the 17th day of the month the same day where all the fountain mountains of the deep the great deep broken up and the windows of Heaven were opened and the rain was upon the Earth 40 days and 40 nights and so we know that it was it was the second month May 17th when this event took place in the days of Noah and you'll also notice that you know that it was May 17th that the Life Magazine was brought to the public about the supernatural Cloud being displayed in 1963 over sunset Mountain these correlations are not coincidence this was showing God's judgment God's timing God's placing of his servants identifying and showing that he's the same yesterday today and forever we need to recognize these things and we will see these things rep repeat themselves the second month on the Hebrew calendar is actually may did you know that the first month is April and so the actual second month according to the scripture was actually may and when was this uh Life Magazine brought out May the 17th 1963 the the cloud appeared on Sunset Mountain February the 28th 1963 I want you to notice the number 28 28 represents life okay and so everything that we're talking about here today I want you to recognize that this is all around the Life of Christ it's all around the life of the church everything is relating to the life if you look at 1963 you will see that 19 + 6 + 3 equals 28 there it is again right life the cloud remains sunlit for 28 minutes after Sunset all right there it is again 28 Victory so so Life Magazine publishes the article on the cloud on May 17th 1963 17 representing victory in the Bible okay because to the people that recognize what God is doing in this day it's victory Amen to those that do not recognize 17 represents judgment represents rejection okay and so if we look at Matthew 17 verse 5 okay we'll go to that and when they saw saw him they worshiped him but some disbelieved you see so This Cloud this Supernatural event that took place it wasn't for everybody even when Jesus himself appeared before them in the Supernatural when he rose and he stood there before them in that Supernatural body he was he was in he was surrounded by a cloud some actually believe that it was him but some didn't believe because this is not for everybody this that that has taken place in our day you see it's the foundation of our faith without you recognizing what God has done through a Vindicated profit and what has taken place in in our ministry in the bride's Ministry over the last 61 years you will fail to recognize what God is doing today without recognizing that he's the same yesterday today and forever you're going to miss everything that he's doing now and so the Life magazine article came out on May 17th which which was Victory to to the Believers but to those that rejected it it was judgment I want you to notice Matthew 28 is the resurrection chapter in The Book of Matthew there it is again 28 life the resurrection and commission to the church acts acts 28 is the only other book in the New Testament that has 28 chapters and the book of Acts is all about the acts of the holy spirit in the church and what is the the holy spirit in the church the life amen it's the life of the church amen praise God God and so acts 217 and acts 2:28 and there's those two numbers again 17 28 second month second month I will pour out my spirit which is his life 17 and 28 and two is a witness okay out of those two same scriptures because it's all about God pouring out his Spirit into the church giving the church the life that it needs to be God's representative in this day and in this hour amen praise God and so here we go and we continue now in Acts 21:17 he says and it shall come to pass in the last day saith God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams Joel 228 and it shall come to pass afterwards that I will pour pour out my spirit upon All Flesh see there it is again and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see Visions H Allelujah acts 2:28 thou has made known unto me the way of life aren't you like like can you see here that that these are not just scriptural coincidences but this is actually God showing himself in the Perfection of his word vindicating that that cloud that took place in 1963 was not just some other phenomena in the sky that could be explained away but this was actually God coming to the Earth to vindicate that he was going to do something that he was going to call a church that he was going to meet with the mystical body of Jesus Christ that's why when you look at the cloud you see it as a as as a cloud uh that that is is the head of Jesus Christ which is the head coming down to meet with the body of Christ amen praise God another thing that was very interesting is that right around that same time when this event took place there was another event that took place on the other side of the US in Hawaii there was a a rainbow that was photographed and the person that was the writer in the article of the Life Magazine on May the 17th 1963 wrote this article on these Moon beams it was like a rainbow that he described as Moon beams because of the sunlight and the reflection of the moon on the rainbow and it gave off what they called like a a rainbow and this individual under the inspiration of God not knowing god not remember Life Magazine was a big you know magazine back in those days it went it went all over the United States and they had different writers that would do different articles and and this particular article was written and it was placed on page 11 of the Life magazine that we're talking about here on page 112 was the actual article on the cloud okay so if you took the actual magazine and you and you were to take that particular page you can go to the next slide and you would look through that page this is what you would see you would see a a rainbow cloud over the head or The Cloud of 1963 and this was not a coincidence this only could have been God and I saw listen Revelations 101 says and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head now somebody try to explain to me how that is a coincidence that's no coincidence that was nothing but God vindicating and showing that he was coming to the Earth to vindicate his word and to show himself and fulfill scripture and come to a people that would recognize his scriptural voice amen because William brandham preached on all of this he ministered on the Seven Seals he his whole purpose was to come and Minister the word of God so that a church could be called out of the mess that they were in in all of these denominational churches worldwide this was not a coincidence this was a supernatural visitation listen to brother Bram in 1962 he says here is this the sign of the end sir he says this Angel come down from heaven see the other seven angels of the seven churches was Earthly Messengers but this Angel all the messages finished when this Angel comes down this is Revelations 10 1-7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin the sound all the mysteries of God were going to be finished and there was going to be a supernatural faith that was going to be released unto the church and the church was going to start to recognize who she really is by the supernatural calling of recognizing the scriptural voice that's calling her and he says here all the message is finished the seventh angel winds up the whole thing and this Angel comes not to the Earth he isn't a man from the earth as The Messengers to the church ages that's finished he says back then but this Angel brings the next announcement and an angel means messenger he comes down from heaven clothed in the pillar of of light cloud with a rainbow over his head and a rainbow is a covenant a covenant to who a covenant people did not did not God tell Noah that I will not destroy you by water anymore I make a covenant with you my people I'll be with you I will come for you I will declare myself to you I've made a covenant with a with a people in this day and in this hour that have recognized the word of God for their day and she's walking with God Amen praise God hallelujah so the Rainbow on page 111 and the cloud picture on 112 was not just some coincidence it was God declaring to the world back then and today again I'm bringing it as a reminder to you and to everybody that hears this that God has declared himself he declared himself in 1963 and he continues to declare himself in this day and in this hour through signs and wonders in the heavens amen praise God H Allelujah God was speaking and vindicating his voice through the ministry of William Maryam brandham back then in 1963 if there was ever anything that was anointed brother Bram said the Bible became a brand new Bible to him because it wasn't him that was opening the word now it was the mighty Angel himself he said that if he had to come and taught what he saw in the scriptures without the the the those angels coming in to to speak to him and tell him exactly what the interpretation was on the word he would have made a mess of it and we in the same way without the spirit of God without the Holy Ghost an an ano Anin in on a minister to to to minister the word of God and to to bring forth the word under that Supernatural anointing of the Holy Spirit you'll make a mess of God's word William brandham was told to go back to Jeffersonville and I want you to notice that on March the 17th he began to minister the Seven Seals he ended on March the 24th we just had two eclipses one in 2017 and one in 2024 now you you're going to need to let the Holy Spirit reveal to you you what it is that's going on and what it is that he's telling us over and over and over again in these in these perfect numbers the seventh seal is something that he preached on the eighth day if you go back and you actually count the numbers the seventh seal was on the eighth day okay and eth is new beginning E is eternity e is an eternal messenger that's now it's no longer William Branham it's the voice of the mighty Angel speaking through William Branham and speaking life into the church calling her placing her it was on July the 28th of that same year 1963 that brother Branham actually went and preached Christ is the mystery of God revealed well do you know that the seventh seal was actually fully preached in that message you go back and listen to that message he'll say that it was one of the most anointed messages it culminated absolutely everything about Christ being revealed through that message and exactly what God was was trying to do do with the church in the in the placing of the church in Christ having the preeminence in the church remember he's restoring Adam he's restoring eve and he's restoring the Earth and everything was covered in that message and right now we're in the restoration of Eve we're right in the midst of it she's been called she's been restored she's been placed and it happened in July on the 28th day there's that number again 28 life 1963 you add those numbers together 28 again life these are not coincidence God was choosing these particular days for a reason God is is perfect in everything that he does amen amen praise God when we look at even the ti Christ is the mystery of God revealed it's seven words in the title it happened in the seventh month and it happened on the 28th day God was finishing up something in the preaching of Christ The Mystery of God revealed he was he was placing it all into a Supernatural Ministry at that time and the bride was now going to be called personally each one would receive their calling they would recognize and hear their their their their name being called under this message you wonder what is it about this message you know people say Danny how come you follow this message I said it's because it's called my name it's because it's it's identified me as a part of the body of Jesus Christ I can't tell you how I heard my name but all I can tell you is that I recognize the word I recognize what God has done I recognize that God sent a a supernatural cloud in 1963 that God sent us a prophet that God opened the word that God opened the Seven Seals so many people are trying to interpret the Seven Seals out there and they've got all kinds of their own interpretations if you go back and you listen to William Branham and the opening of those Seven Seals it is so simple it is so clear but it has to be revealed to you personal and when you see it you can't help but see it simple right at the end of that message in 1963 on July the 28th brother brandom and you go back and listen he say he looked at the clock he says look it's exactly 2:00 the second pull has ended and the third pull is at hand now I'm not going to get into everything about the third pull but the third pull was all about the opening of the word to the church and that God now was going to supernaturally reveal himself and that people would start to hear their names they they they somebody would give them a track somebody would talk to them about a prophet somebody would show them baptism in the name of Jesus Christ they would show them how the word is the absolute and and all of a sudden everything just starts making sense like I said when brother Gabriel handed me that tape I didn't know that William ROM at the time the the person that was speaking was was a prophet I didn't understand that he was a prophet till maybe almost a year later what his true position was but something was speaking to me through those tapes and then when I came into the church and Pastor Simon was ministering the word something was speaking to my heart and and I couldn't understand why I could recognize it why I could see it why I believed it it just made perfect sense to me why because there was representation in us from before the foundations of the world to receive this message it's not for everyone it's only for those that are called Jesus said all that the father hath given me will come those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundations of the world they'll be able to see it they'll be able to hear it they'll recognize it amen praise God and so the the third pull now was was was activated and here we are we're all in the midst of it and we're still under the leadership of the third pull because the third pull is Jesus Christ now I'm just going to read you know um a scripture here from 2 Thessalonians because this is all about the opening of the word and understanding that it was that it was a supernatural Angel The Mighty Angel himself that has come down and in 2 Thessalonians 1: 4-7 it says so that we ourselves glory in you in the Churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions tribulations that you endure it's not easy to re to to to receive this message and to and to and to stand for this message and and and to stand the reproach of this message it's not easy but here he's saying here which is a manifest token of the righteous Judgment of God that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God for which you also suffer seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you and to you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty Angels you see God revealed himself he made himself known the word is declaring it there there's a scriptural voice there's scripture that backs everything up that we are talking about here you know it's been uh 61 years since the opening of The Seven Seals the church Body of Christ has come into her maturity and they and she's come to a place where she's starting to know what to do with the word she's recognizing that she has the word and she's coming to realize that she actually is the last voice and the final voice to this generation now go to the next slide back in 2000 or 1995 we moved into this church here and we were known as the Eagles cry Ministry we moved into a church on Bruce Dale and you know it was at that time that we had our church dedication in in August I believe it was August 1995 and you know a picture was taken and I want you to look at this picture here and I want you to know that that eagle that eagle Cloud that's in the picture there that was not something that we had designed and put into the sign that showed up when our photographer was taking pictures in preparation for our dedication and then he handed the picture to us and we looked at the picture and I mean it's it's just look can you see that head there it's just sitting right in the nest there and it's surrounded by a white cloud it's outlined by a white cloud now I looked at the scripture and and right away you know Matthew 24 is all about the end time you go back and look at Matthew 24 and then there's that 28 number again and the scripture says for wheresoever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together now like I said these are Supernatural events and to a lot of people they're going to think oh what are you bringing that up for Danny I'm bringing it up because I identify myself as one of those Eagles that's feeding on the fresh revelation of God's word in this day and in this hour and I came under a Supernatural Ministry when I come under our former Pastor John Simon okay it was a Supernatural Ministry because I was under bondage I was under drug addiction I was under the slavery of the of the of the principalities and the dominions of this world and Jesus Christ Set Me Free through this ministry and I'm not talking about you know to show that this Cloud this was a supernatural event there's no question in our minds anybody that knows this this uh remembers this sign and when this took place it was Supernatural we rejoiced in it it was God showing and vindicating to us personally this is all about a personal walk with God this is where I'm going here today okay this is all going to culminate you're going to see why these things have been brought forth here today why God laid it upon my heart so strong amen and so in 1995 we moved uh into this church and in 2004 we we moved out of this church and I remember at the time when we were leaving the church you know it was like this all came back to me and it was like now the eagle is stirring the nest he's saying it's time to you to go go out and move into your public Ministry okay it's time for this church to to move on and you know and you know sometimes when the nest gets stirred and you get kicked out of the nest you know we were we ended up on Walker's line and it was like kind of like almost like a Wilderness kind of experience we were walking we were walking we didn't know where we were going we didn't have a church we didn't have a home we were like the children of Israel we were looking for that place where God was going to place us and and and and lead us and you know kind of like we we kind of kind of felt like kind of scattered and didn't know exactly what the Lord had in mind but then God comes on the scene again supernaturally and in 200 uh um s the church that we were staying in which was uh Pineland uh no it was East Presbyterian uh Church on ERS line they came and approached us and said hey we're going to be amalgamating with our church pin land Presbyterian which was this building and this church is going to become available for sale would you be interested in putting in an offer well when we looked at the property we said yeah we love this church are you kidding me but then I knew exactly that this church was you know was was was in a a number that was definitely not financially in the reach of this small flock here okay but with God With God all things are possible God was going to do something that that that we had no idea but With God all things are possible and so they just came to us and they said listen just come in with your best offer and that's what we did and we came in with our best offer which was about half the value of this property at the time there was offers that were 7 to 800,000 higher than our offer but then they turned around because the holy spirit said I call the shots here they they surrendered to the Holy Spirit and I thank God and we Rejoice for P for for that pin land Presbyterian and East Presbyterian for what they did because God LED them that they wanted to keep the church as a Ministry they wanted it to still be in the service of the Lord all the other offers that were coming in were for people that wanted to develop the property because it's a very desirable piece of property and it can be turned into multiple homes and you know this this property is now probably four to five I don't know5 million dollars in value that was the grace of God God was doing something new and so in 2007 God gave us this church and it wasn't until 2012 that the Lord moved us in here because he was doing something new God was going to do something new right here on New Street and it's always been a supernatural Church saints of God you've got to recognize that that God has always been moving in our midst sure we have our trials sure we have our fights sure we've got to overcome things but that doesn't mean he's not with us that just goes to show how much he is with us amen praise God let's move on so now we're going to bring this home okay we're going to look at the two eclipses that just took place and we're going to see how these numbers are all over the place and how God's Perfection is in his numbers and hopefully you can see yourself in those numbers you know it it was in in uh 1918 was the last time that America actually witnessed a total eclipse okay and when you look at 1918 you take the number 19 plus one plus 8 and what do you get 28 there's that number of life again see God showing himself you know that was the last time that America experienced it in the same way that they experienced it just now where it actually went right across all of America God was calling the Gentiles now let's go to the next slide 2017 so when we look at 2017 the the Lord led me to Luke 207 when you look at 20 again 17 you go 20 + 1 + 7 equals 28 there's that number again okay and he beheld them and said what is this then that is written the stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the Cornerstone when that Supernatural Eclipse took place in 17 and we covered a lot of what happened during that eclipse and how it went over you know the the the seven Salems and and uh you know that God was declaring certain things you know to the earth I believe it was God calling the Gentile dispensation to repentance again you know in the form of a warning and for those who have recognized they turn to the Lord which is the word you know and and and they've recognized actually it was it was the seven Salems yes and then the seven Church ages you know we looked at all of that you know I don't want to go into all of that I'm just looking at how this particular scripture in Luke 2017 it's it's it's a a a a rejection scripture how they're rejecting The Headstone that's what they did when when those that rejected the cloud back in 1963 didn't realize that they were actually rejecting the Cornerstone The Headstone Christ himself when they didn't believe that William brandham was the prophet of Malachi 4:5 Revelations 107 that it was Christ himself that brother brandham had to go off the scene so that he could introduce Christ again to this generation just like John the Baptist he had to go off the scene he was also under the spirit of Elijah the first John William brandham the second Spirit of Elijah okay actually the third fourth Spirit of Elijah and then there's one more coming of Elijah because if you go back into the Old Testament God used Elijah five times okay and then we look at the next slide and this is 2024's eclipse and then you look at acts 2024 and the scripture says but none of these things move me neither count I myself my life dear unto my myself so that I might finish my course with joy and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of God you see here we've been given a Ministry God is God is is reiterating to us that hey I gave you a Ministry I gave you the ministry of life I've given you the word for this day and for this hour and here I'm identifying my myself in you and he's and he was declaring there was things that were speaking out of that Eclipse back on on uh uh April the 8th that we need to find the scriptural voice for and so I started to search and I started to dig and then even while I'm sleeping the Lord would show me certain scriptures and I would just write them down and I would write them down and I would say yes Lord and then when I came across this and I saw there's got to be something for 2024 and there it was the ministry that he gave us he's given us the ministry but to the world that rejects it it's judgment the whole world has gone into darkness Saints there's no hope except for the coming of the Lord amen and so I went on and then I looked at you know God's perfect numbers and we already talked about this the Seven Seals were preached on March the 17th through to March the 24th there's those two numbers numbers again 2017 2024 but then when you take those numbers and you add them and you look at you just take now this just all the numbers and you go 2 + 0 + 1 + 7 equals what 10 then you look at 2024 you look at 2 + 0 + 2 + 4 equal 8 what do you get the next slide Revelations 108 and what is that scripture and the voice which I heard a type of the Bride from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth what came down put his foot upon the sand and the the sand and and upon the sea back in 1963 it was the mighty Angel himself and he had a rainbow over his head which was a covenant to who to the church and the church was going to be given a commission that she would fulfill Revelations 108 to1 brother William Mariam brandham never took this scripture because it didn't pertain to him it pertained to you and me it's for our season it's for this hour God is revealing prophesying and speaking to a generation out there that need to know that the word of the Lord has been restored and the word is now in a people and she's preparing for a Rapture amen praise God when we look at this scripture we see it so clearly praise God Amen and so let's go on the church has recognized her position she's recognized her placing in the word of God H Allelujah amen now let's go to the next slide all of this being said and the reason why God has placed the voice in US is so that we can unite the bride of Christ This is a uniting time and there's signs that God is giving to this world that it's uniting time and season and there's going to be signs and there's going to be a voice that's going to that's going to be behind those signs amen praise God go to the next slide acts 2:17 to 21 and it shall come to pass in the last days saith God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy what did we just look at Revelations 108 and if you read the whole scripture thou must prophesy again before many tongues Nations and Kings we are now in that ministry right now and here we are they shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and I will show wonders in the heavens above and signs in in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapor and smoke listen all these things are happening right now there's volcanic eruptions that are taking place in different parts of the world that's blood and Fire coming out of the earth there's all you know like if if we start looking all these signs they're all happening the sun shall be turned into darkness it just happened again these are things that are happening and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the Lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved amen amen praise God there's a people that are declaring that you need to call on the name of the Lord you need to receive Jesus Christ in this day and in this hour because this world is going into Absolute Total Chaos total tribulation there is no hope but the coming of the Lord the people need to know it they need it needs to be declared amen praise God hallelujah glory to God Amen listen to brother brandham here the purpose of the final voice I want you to recognize now we've just turned into the final stages of this message here today and I want you to pay attention brother Bram speaking here in uniting time and sign he says now we're talking of this uniting uniting time the sign of the uniting time see Jesus was here in this last scripture reading now he's referring to Matthew 16:4 where he's rebuking them because they couldn't recognize the the the signs of the times okay and here Jesus was here in this last scripture reading he was rebuking the clergy for not being able to discern the time or the sign of the time now that has always been a great thing to the people see to be able to discern the sign of the time that you're living in because God writes it plainly so nobody could Escape it now ordinarily I'd go back it plainly so nobody would Escape now ordinarily I'd go back and pick up from other ministers other Servants of the Lord in the Bible time like the sign of Noah in his time the sign of Daniel's time and so forth the different signs but I want to bypass that tonight to save time to be able that it's always been God's way to give them a natural sign of the time so that everyone would know just what time it was it is and these Pharisees should have known their time they should have known what the time was he said in another place if you would have known me you would have known my day see it's very a great thing that we understand see without understanding what was he saying here that that these things that God is doing and what I'm saying to you here today these things that God is doing in our midst declaring himself through the cloud and and through these Supernatural events that he's done in our lives that these are things that that that you need to recognize that that the people it just goes over their head they can't see the sign of of of the Resurrection they can't see that Christ is now alive in a church declaring itself he goes on here to say here in the same message now just think every man and all the astronomers people them days their clocks was the stars there was a Watchman went up on top of the tower and he would get up there and watch and he seen what certain Stars was in the certain constellations and they were passing he knowed what time it was you remember in the scripture what time it is Watchmen and the Watchman come back and told him what time it was God's got Watchmen in this hour We're God's Watchmen we're watching we're seeing we're recognizing these signs these times these Supernatural eclipses that have that have been taking place and the Watchman come back and told him what hour it was see they kept time by the Stars Now isn't it strange that these stars were exactly in line for three men and nobody else saw it isn't it the same he says nobody else s see just exactly in line now you could you can be in so in line with the scripture see when those stars become in unity United themselves together in this constellation three men were're also United at the same time and you can be so United with God in his word until these things become realities and you can see them and know that they are true has it become a reality to you amen is this a reality that God has called us that we're in the last listen we're in the end time of the end times amen this is the greatest time of decep ception and if there was ever going to be a time of total deception it's going to be right now and don't be looking out there into all the different denominational churches they're A Million Miles Away we need to look at what's going on right around us and we need to realize that there's people that are sleeping they're not recognizing the signs of the times brother brah says it needs to become a reality the sign of the time he says you might look right over top of of it say ah nonsense but to you it isn't nonsense to you you're United with the word and here it is then it's it's absolutely light brother Pat when when when you see this sign Unite with the believer and that's who I'm addressing this to is the believer that's who I'm speaking to this this afternoon it's to the believer amen for for for the unbeliever will never see it oh my and what a rebuke it would be if he was on Earth today to many of our clergy today who cannot read this sign the signs that we're reading daily here at the Tabernacle and seeing the things and others reading it and seeing the handwriting on the wall and yet many just ignore it and don't even see it at all it's nothing to them at all they don't even notice it what an hour we're living in Saints what an hour glory to God Amen thank you Jesus listen behold Revelations 1 7 to8 behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all kindreds of the Earth shall whail because of him even so amen I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending sayeth the Lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty hallelujah praise God Amen I want you to go to the next slide on April the 8th 2024 at exactly 3:03 p.m. on that Monday I was driving along the 407 and I pulled over to the side of the road I I just realized that I wasn't going to make it home the traffic was so bad so I pulled over to the side of the road I was there for about three or four minutes and then the lights came up behind me and it was a police officer and I was there like this looking with the glasses on waiting for the event to come and I I hear this and I'm there and I'm looking and I look over and it's a police officer with a big smile he says and I put my window down I said oh hi officer I had my those glasses [Laughter] on I look over I said yes sir he says you can't stop here he says you got to move along I said oh no problem he says thank you got up started driving couldn't get off the highway all of a sudden it was so jammed up I had to pull over again now there was like about 80 cars and he's way back there and I can see him way back there the lights are going on and he's going from where I said by the time he gets here this eclipse is over and so I started taking pictures and the Holy Spirit led me to just take a few pictures and it wasn't until after that I looked at this picture and I realized that there was something there and if you look at the cloud it's almost you know the cloud of 1963 except it's looking the other way because if you look at the cloud you go to the next slide real brief you'll see that he's looking to the right if you go to the go back now to the other one it's looking to the left and so I thought okay where's the scripture there and so the Lord led me to look into the the two thieves that were on the cross one was on the left one was on the right and I found that the good thief was crucified to Jesus's right according to tradition and the other Thief was crucified to his left and so for this reason the dep itions of the crucifixion of Jesus often Show Jesus head inclined to his right showing his acceptance of the good thief I believe it was in 1963 that that God came down and was looking favorably to those that were that were sinners like just like you and me it was the opportunity for us to to say Lord remember me but here now in in uh 2024 here comes another cloud and I'm not making this oh this has got to go around the message now and it's going to be the cloud and oh brother BR brother Danny is making himself special or anything like no I'm just showing you observations and I am expressing to you what the Holy Spirit showed me in my heart and the scriptures that he led me to and these were the scriptures behold he cometh with clouds every eye shall see him and so forth okay and those which pierced him and all kindreds and then and they also led me to these scriptures and if we look at second Peter because I looked at my at my picture and it showed me the exact time that I took it and it was at 3:03 p.m. it was about 15 minutes before the actual eclipse this was in the process of the eclipse taking place and I looked up second Peter 3:3 and it says knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming I said hallelujah praise the name of the Lord there's a lot of people oh yeah these signs yeah another eclipse okay this happens no God is again declaring to our hearts through Supernatural experiences and like I said said at the very beginning you need to be having Supernatural experiences with your walk with God and you need to be watching you need to be looking these things are happening around us all the time but it's to them that watch he says he says here where where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation but yet in Luke chap 23: 42- 43 and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me go to the next slide Luke 23:43 and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto him verily I say unto unto thee today today you know this can be a brand new new day for you I don't know whoever's listening in today you can be with Christ today you can accept the things that God has done in our day and recognize the supernatural moving of the holy spirit amen praise God go back to the previous slide when we look at three it's the number of perfection 1963 you look at 1 1963 there's three all over the place you look at the number of perfection in 2024 here it here here it happens again another Supernatural sign right here in 2024 the three-fold purpose of God it's all threes 61 years later here we are 6 + 1 equals 7 the number of completion I mean there's so many different things that we can look at here and I I close here just another five to S minutes from the message an exposition of the seven Church ages the leoan church age brother brandham says in the Dark Ages the word almost entirely lost to the people but God sent Luther with the word the Lutheran spoke for God at that time but they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends towards dogma and Creeds and not simple word they could no longer speak for God then God sent Wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his Revelation from God became the living Epistles read and known of all men for their generation when the Methodist failed God raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until in the last days there was another again another people in the land who under their message will be the final voice to the final age yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it's its own mouthpiece so God is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her yes it is for it says in the last chapter of Revelations uh 17 the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear directly from God as at Pentecost but of course the word bride will be repudiated as in the first age it's not going to be easy to live this message Saints it's not going to be easy to recognize what what responsibility God has given us but when you start to look at God's Perfection and you start to see that that you're walking with the Living God this is not just a a simple church that you belong to this is a supernatural mystical body of Jesus Christ then you start to see and recognize all kinds of things I was laying in bed this morning I woke up just after 4:00 this morning I was laying there and the Holy Spirit just started pouring in all kinds of thoughts into my mind and he started to say he says look he says you you you've been looking into all my numbers you've been looking into my perfection he says he says look at you he says I want you to know something you were born in the second month on the 24th day I said yeah 24 there's that number again second month if you take the two and the zero and you reverse them you got 2024 what's he doing he's just telling me about that that you know what you're in my mind you're a part of my thoughts he says look at your wife she was born October the 8th 1961 I said yeah he says 108 the woman the bride I gave you a wife she was from before the Found Glory to God hallelujah I said Thank You Lord Revelations 108 here She is again she's prophesying the word of the Lord for this day and for this hour she's got a word amen glory to God I'm 63 years old and I was born in 1961 and when you add the two together it's 124 and there's that 24 again I said yep there you are Lord 24 in 2024 here we go he says you were ordained in 2024 I said yeah that's right I said praise God he says yeah you were also publicly ordained on March the 17th I said oh yeah he says yeah 17 there's a number again and if you go back and you look at Luke 3:17 look at John 3:17 look at Matthew 3:17 it was Jesus Christ moving into his public Ministry it was God saying I am pleased with him ye Oh Glory to God I said Lord you're everywhere not me him it's him it's about him bringing his word to his people declaring his word in this hour that it's always been Jesus Christ it's his public Ministry it's not our public Ministry but he's going to show us one of these days he's going to put us before the people he's going to let us know that I am with you and you shall know that I am your God and that you are my people I said Thank You Jesus glory to God hallelujah praise God he says look at your look at your presentation I said yeah he says count the number of slides how many slides there brother 24 slides I said oh okay there it is again he says you were supposed to be here last week but I I I had to set you aside for a week why I said Lord he says because I wanted you to preach it on the 28th I said glory to God Amen thank you Jesus I said Lord You Have Your Way in my life I'm surrendering my life to you Lord May the people recognize these signs may they see what it is that you're doing in this day and in this hour Lord this is all about you this is all about the move of God Amen so no matter where I look all I see is my number I said let the musicians come Hallelujah we're going to sing that song I'm in that number Glory Hallelujah I'm in that number I believe God has you numbered I believe he's got you in the palm of your hand I

spiritual Amnesia all this denominational teaching and all these doctrines of men man and all these teachings of man that have been placed upon your life God says I'm calling you to your position now

amen amen that we the celebration of our previous Pastor brother John is coming up from the 7th to the 9th of June amen and we like all those who will be attending amen there's a sign up sheet on the board and I have brother Mike here who's going to give us some instructions and some details of what is going to be taking place amen come on brother mik okay first of all um concerning what we just heard how many can say that's nothing but the truth it is it's the truth um but what does it mean it means life to the bride she's alive she's well he's alive he's well well he's living in his bride that's what it means brother sister you want to talk about supernatural in this day I don't know how this works here but there's life nevertheless all right so okay towards the uh the banquet what we just wanted to make this announcement uh this has to do with the Sunday dinner right you know whether you've been invited or not it's By Invitation or whatnot but we just realized that on that at that dinner time after the dinner we the the thoughts are just starting to become clear as to what we're going to be doing that day and one thing we know for sure right is that we know like like brother Desmond he wants to say something where is he anyway he wants to say something right am I right oh yeah brother coffee is gonna want to say something sister so and so is gonna want to say something and brother so and so and this one's gonna want to everybody's GNA want to say something right am I right why wouldn't you right so we just thought boy this could be a long after afternoon especially if everybody gets up and says Pastor Simon you are a great pastor we love you all that's true but if you keep if that's all we hear all afternoon it's going to be a long afternoon so here's what we we thought would be a good idea you've heard the phrase that a pictured um what's it what's that that phrase is worth a thousand words right so what we want to do is uh use words to draw a picture all right so when it comes my time to say something or your time to say something here here's what would be good I don't know if this is we're going to be able to do this or not but with your cooperation perhaps what we would ask is you can say God bless you Pastor Simon we love you we appreciate you yeah okay and then but we would like to have a story from everybody not a long story just just a a two or three minute blurb about something that took place in brother gab's life for instance brother Gabe comes up he says it was approximately 1998 when Pastor Simon came and spoke to me or preached from the pulpit and said something something something and this is what took place right I mean we have those experience expences do we not all right all the way up and what what I'd like to do is is try to um put it all on chronological order so from as far back as I go as uh 1988 so we do have a few that are a little bit ahead of me but we can start there and have a story in 1988 1990 92 try to put it in chronic logical order go all the way up everybody gets to say something you can say your nice things but you have a little story and it'll paint a picture of his ministry for the last I didn't do the math but anyway whatever the whatever okay for this past few years right so is that do that sound reasonable so everybody gets a chance to say something a short something but uh but have a story attached to it an experience attached to it that can be related uh that day it paints a beautiful picture of his ministry right so the point is we're only about a month or so away so it's a lot of work to do so I need everybody who wants to say something to get in contact with me to give me an approximate year when this took place and then we can talk and go through it and try to put it together like a puzzle all right that's why we're telling you about it today sound good the rest of it whether there singing and all that stuff that we we still don't know about that we're still working on that stuff but this part I felt was important that you can start to think about it and relay the information you got to let me know right you have to let me know ahead of time and then uh everything will be good we're looking forward to a fantastic weekend that weekend it will be a fantastic weekend trust me Friday night Saturday night Sunday wow gonna be a good time who's who's taking this Anthony you coming all right come ahead God bless you was it the truth it's marching on brother sister in two feet all right here yeah Brothers you can you can dismiss everybody years of time have come and gone till I was heard it all how my Jesus will come to [Music] again if back then it seems so real and I can't help but feel how much closer he coming is today signs of the times are everywhere [Music] there's a brand new feeling in the air Keep Your Eyes Upon the Eastern Skies lift up your head your Redemption Jo night Wars and stri on every hand and violence fills all land still some people doubt that he would come come [Music] again but the word of God is true he's redeem keep his Chosen Few don't lose hope soon Christ Jesus Will beend yes sign of the time everywhere oh
