[33:03] early
[33:04] 70s and we stayed together in one room
[33:09] until we were able to do better and
[33:12] separate and go our various ways okay so
[33:16] I know uh he's my first cousin actually
[33:21] and so he passed and then the wife and
[33:24] the family were in Toronto
[33:28] and uh somehow I haven't been in touch
[33:31] with them for I don't know maybe about 5
[33:34] years something like that um but anyway
[33:38] when a mother passed they don't have
[33:41] anybody else you don't have any any
[33:45] relatives in the country except me so
[33:49] obviously uh when they call I just this
[33:53] one of those things you have to
[33:55] do so I had to be there for them um you
[34:00] know comforting strengthening in every
[34:02] possible way and we thank the Lord Jesus
[34:06] for that um I couldn't even listen to
[34:09] last week service actually I started and
[34:12] started a little bit of it and then I
[34:14] had to come off so I apologize uh
[34:18] brother brother Tim but I was into so
[34:21] many other things we praise God that the
[34:25] word of God is still in our our hearts
[34:28] It Never Dies it's a burning fire it's a
[34:32] flame that cannot be put out it's like
[34:35] the fire that was in the Tabernacle
[34:37] never can go out it's not a Strange Fire
[34:41] it's Holy Fire it's fire from the
[34:44] presence of almighty God we don't have
[34:47] to stoke it light it beat it up drum it
[34:49] down or sing it up or whatever that's
[34:52] part of inspiration but that's not why
[34:55] we are here we are are here because of
[34:58] the word of God making itself known to
[35:02] Us Praise the Lord we are here gathered
[35:05] together to worship Him glorify him and
[35:09] also to express ourselves one to the
[35:12] other we not only here not just to hear
[35:15] the word but we are here to experience
[35:19] him and his presence and his power this
[35:23] great one that lives in us and with us
[35:27] around us walks with us talks with us
[35:30] every step of the way and really um your
[35:34] human beings we feed natural food but
[35:37] spirit with spirit will
[35:39] meet uh if if your soul can only feed on
[35:45] God because you are part of him praise
[35:48] the Lord and like a mother feeds her
[35:51] child God feeds us with his word and we
[35:54] thank him for his word here today I'm
[35:57] thanking him within my heart while I'm
[35:58] saying that for his word and and and the
[36:02] Simplicity of the Holy Spirit you know
[36:05] find as the the the the this that the
[36:08] devil gets in the minds of men because
[36:11] the prophet was was one Prophet sent
[36:14] here to bring the word that the the
[36:17] deeper you go or appear to go as more
[36:20] recognition you're going to get or
[36:22] whatever it doesn't work that way we are
[36:26] Who We Are by the grace of God Amen you
[36:30] see and the prophet gave us the secret
[36:34] God hides in
[36:37] Simplicity what you appear to think is
[36:40] nothing sometimes under there is some of
[36:42] the greatest
[36:44] things so the prophet says watch be
[36:48] careful watch be vigilant or else it'll
[36:51] pass right by you and you won't even
[36:53] notice it see Jesus got up on on the the
[36:57] greatest sermon ever preached on the
[36:59] Mount of Olives and blessed are the pure
[37:03] in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of
[37:06] God my that doesn't sound
[37:10] mysterious you see but that's how it
[37:13] comes and it appears to come right and
[37:17] uh and it's the spirit in you the deep
[37:20] that calling back to that begins to see
[37:22] that thing unfold right what appears
[37:25] simple and appears to be nothing over
[37:27] there in your eyes when you see it it
[37:30] starts to bloom and Blossom and you
[37:33] recognize the Roman Candlestick the
[37:35] prophet was talking about fireworks
[37:38] going on in your soul brother good to
[37:41] see you brother hallelujah amen he's
[37:44] here strong in the house of God uh and

[37:54] all having our battles cuz we we're
[37:56] getting up there I know you would admit
[37:58] it but
[38:01] uh but we all getting up there but be
[38:04] like it or not God is going to make sure
[38:06] you
[38:09] know you're going to become aware that
[38:12] something is going on it's different I
[38:14] can't uh go out the way I used to go out
[38:17] before it's changed truly it's changing
[38:21] and we thank God and we must recognize
[38:23] the change right the Bible gives a
[38:26] special blessing and there was a special
[38:28] tribe mentioned in the bible men whom
[38:31] God gives spiritual understanding to
[38:33] recognize the seasons and the times and
[38:38] how to tell the children of Israel how
[38:42] to avoid certain dangers of the seasons
[38:45] times that's going on we know we're
[38:48] living in a time of chaos yes we know
[38:51] the prophet prophesied it how we'd be
[38:53] living in a season of Life the Prophet
[38:56] tells us plainly he says your whole
[38:59] economies are built on the seat and lies
[39:03] is that right yes it's all lies
[39:06] everything they sell you is a lie
[39:07] everything they try to tell it's lies
[39:09] it's lies they can't speak the truth
[39:12] because they don't have this word they
[39:15] they want to but they can't you
[39:17] understand praise the Lord and it just
[39:19] moves like that in them praise the Lord
[39:23] hallelujah thank god well uh today uh
[39:27] our brother has the scripture can you
[39:29] put the scripture up so that we can read
[39:32] it today uh brother together shall we
[39:35] all
[39:46] stand praise the
[39:49] Lord uh my topic today is
[39:53] Choice revealing character
[39:58] Hebrews
[40:01] 11:23 gracious father as we are about to
[40:05] break the bread like Jesus did we raise
[40:09] our hands and hearts to heaven and give
[40:11] thee thanks for the word of God and as
[40:14] you break the bread we pray you'll
[40:16] multiply it amongst and upon the people
[40:20] that we might all receive Divine
[40:22] strength to give you more praise honor
[40:25] and Glory Ines Jesus name amen and
[40:29] amen by faith Moses when he was born was
[40:35] hid three months of hisence because they
[40:40] saw he was a proper
[40:43] child and they were not afraid of the
[40:47] king's
[40:49] commandment by faith Moses when he was
[40:53] come to years refused to be called the
[40:57] son of Pharaoh's
[41:00] daughter
[41:02] choosing rather to suffer
[41:07] Affliction with the people of God than
[41:10] to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[41:15] season esteeming the reproach of Christ
[41:19] greater riches than the treasures in
[41:21] Egypt for ye had respect unto the
[41:25] recompense
[41:26] of the
[41:27] reward by faith he forsook Egypt not
[41:32] fearing the Wrath of the king for he
[41:35] endured as seeing him who is
[41:39] invisible through faith he kept the
[41:43] Passover and the sprinkling of the blood
[41:46] lest he that destroyed the firstborn
[41:49] should touch them amen praise the Lord
[41:54] and my a is to show you exactly what I
[41:58] said that the choices that we make in
[42:01] our lives uh
[42:04] reveals what character nature what
[42:08] character uh is in you amen and the
[42:11] choices that we make in our lives shapes
[42:15] or helps to shape our futures sir is
[42:18] that
[42:20] right God bless you please be
[42:25] seated
[42:28] first of all let's do something
[42:30] extemporaneous by looking at the
[42:32] scripture
[42:34] amen by faith when he was born he was HD
[42:37] for three months because they saw he was
[42:40] a proper child they were not afraid of
[42:43] the king's
[42:44] commandment they saw he was a proper
[42:47] child what do you mean you think a NIC
[42:49] looking baby no they had a revelation
[42:53] that he was a god-sent child a god-given
[42:55] child child he was not just a regular
[42:58] baby you know we all come as babies but
[43:01] they recognized that he was a proper
[43:03] child that he was a godsent child and so
[43:07] they wanted to protect him in every way
[43:10] and later on of course he grew up and
[43:13] when he grew up he grew on grew up in
[43:15] Pharaoh's Palace as you know the story
[43:18] uh with the bull rushes and Pharaoh's
[43:20] daughter and uh he grew up in Pharaoh's
[43:23] Palace he grew up with all the
[43:26] privileges of life he he grew up with
[43:29] the best
[43:30] education he was known to be when he was
[43:33] just a young man one of the wisest men
[43:37] of of that time right so he was when he
[43:42] was come to years he's come to
[43:45] understanding he come to maturity when
[43:47] he's come to years he
[43:50] refused to be called a
[43:53] Baptist because he was raised in a
[43:56] beautiful church he was raised with a
[44:00] marvelous uh preacher educated in the
[44:03] best universities he lacked nothing and
[44:07] he was even a master of that uh he was a
[44:10] master he became one of the top church
[44:13] members and leaders within the system
[44:17] and he was favored that in next in line
[44:20] or he could have become the
[44:23] superintendent or he could have become
[44:25] the the the the president or the head of
[44:28] everything but what the Bible tells us
[44:31] he refused to be called the son of
[44:34] Pharaoh's daughter well of course we
[44:36] know Pharaoh still has a lot of
[44:38] daughters all around uh they're now
[44:40] known in the Bible Daughters of the
[44:43] Harlot Revelation right so we understand
[44:46] that he came out of that and it was
[44:48] wonderful we all were inside of that
[44:51] amen yes I said we all were in that amen
[44:55] Okay so we were all in there enjoying
[44:58] the Privileges and the blessings of it
[45:01] the offers the goodness you know H H for
[45:04] myself I have offers we will send you a
[45:07] scholarship this University that univ
[45:09] we'll send you over here we'll all we'll
[45:12] take care of everything don't worry
[45:13] about it you see they see that just as
[45:16] much as the parents could see God in him
[45:19] the devil also recognize there's a gift
[45:22] under there and he wants to get a hold
[45:26] of that and to use it and that's the
[45:29] reason why a lot of us before we were
[45:33] really and truly born again or our eyes
[45:36] were opened or we recognized who we
[45:39] really are we did a lot of things and we
[45:43] did it with
[45:45] sincerity if we drink we want to drink
[45:48] like anybody else if we want to dance we
[45:52] danc amen if anything we want to do we
[45:55] want want to use our drugs we want to
[45:57] use smoke we we want to whatever we did
[46:00] it with everything we enjoy the parties
[46:03] the pleasures of sin the Bible says yeah
[46:06] we went out there we had a wonderful
[46:07] time because that's exactly the devil
[46:11] wants to suck you in and draw you in to
[46:15] his way of life his way of living just
[46:18] like Pharaoh wanted to do with
[46:21] Moses but something in Moses was already
[46:25] calling
[46:26] before he
[46:28] recognized who he was because gifts and
[46:32] callings are without repentance and so
[46:35] the spirit of Christ was already working
[46:38] in him amen are you going to let me
[46:40] preach here a little bit today oh my
[46:43] praise God praise God hallelujah yeah so
[46:46] here he was he refused once he
[46:50] recognized that something was calling to
[46:53] be called what some denomination name
[46:58] anymore it bothered him to be called a
[47:02] Methodist it bothered him to be called a
[47:05] a Church of Christ or whatever
[47:08] denomination he didn't care how powerful
[47:11] how glorious it was he didn't want
[47:14] anything to do with it amen and when
[47:17] you're a real child of God and a real
[47:20] seed of God even when you didn't know it
[47:23] God's spirit was already called
[47:27] and you start feeling you don't know why
[47:29] you feel bad about this why do I feel
[47:33] this way that way you feel strange to
[47:35] your own self but it's God's spirit
[47:38] calling it's the pull of the Holy Ghost
[47:41] amen praise God do you believe in the
[47:44] Holy Ghost amen praise God hallelujah
[47:48] yesterday I'm walking in walking by the
[47:52] gate by the doorway of a dollar store

[50:26] cycle and and uh the church and even the
[50:30] Believers look like they're dying like

[50:35] like they're dying but it's going
[50:37] through a cycle it has to go through and
[50:39] then it's coming back again amen praise

[51:27] no false flag you're the real
[51:30] Pentecostal a real Pentecostal is part

[51:40] of Jesus Christ and you shall receive
[51:43] the Holy
[51:44] Ghost amen when he has come upon you
[51:47] amen that same Spirit of Christ come to
[51:50] rest upon Peter who tells the people you
[51:54] must be baptized in the name of Jesus
[51:56] Christ repent and turn to God and give
[51:59] your heart to him amen yes sir and so uh
[52:03] Moses refused to be called a a nominal
[52:07] Christian he refused to be called some
[52:10] church member or some denominational
[52:13] amen oh praise God and he chose to uh
[52:18] suffer
[52:19] Affliction listen that's a choice yes
[52:23] amen because he was already next in line
[52:26] to be the next Pharaoh right he didn't
[52:28] have to do anything he just had to
[52:31] continue the way Road he was going and
[52:33] he would become a very wealthy powerful
[52:36] personality in the Kingdom but then he
[52:40] made a choice amen amen must I lie in a
[52:44] flowery bed of East While others fight
[52:47] and die on Bloody Seas he made a choice
[52:51] that he was going to take that road and
[52:54] choose to suffer Affliction with the
[52:56] people of God hallelujah amen many a man
[53:03] could have walked away look there's
[53:05] brother Gabriel right there I'm talking
[53:08] about him right here which had a a a
[53:12] massive company uh with thousands of
[53:16] square footage of space trucks going and
[53:19] coming over 200 and something employees
[53:23] I don't know if that's the exact number
[53:24] or for but praise God going like that
[53:29] millions and millions of dollars coming
[53:32] in and then when all at once God wants
[53:36] to call him to a higher uh status then
[53:40] God takes that company way out of his
[53:43] hands and he comes right back to
[53:49] zero right back to zero and then when
[53:53] the Holy Spirit could pass him through
[53:54] the Mill and start to recognize what God
[53:57] is doing then God slowly start to give
[54:01] him back like
[54:03] job is that right yes start giving them
[54:06] back like job praise the Lord now I'm
[54:09] not saying something that's imagination
[54:11] he seated right here and you know him
[54:13] he's the man that speaks his mind even
[54:15] while I'm preaching he'll get up and say
[54:17] no that's not
[54:19] right hopefully he
[54:24] doesn't
[54:26] oh my choosing right what I'm trying to
[54:30] tell you in his Society in his status
[54:35] that he was and is still living in now
[54:41] he made the choice because he recognized
[54:45] this is the word of the hour Jesus
[54:49] Christ there's only one God and his name
[54:52] is Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[54:55] he recognize baptism is not sprinkling
[54:58] of holy water but it is going down into
[55:03] the water coming up out of the water and
[55:06] the Holy Spirit anointing you to
[55:08] recognize your day and the message of
[55:11] your day that you are living in
[55:14] Hallelujah and he recognized that he
[55:17] could have walked off with his uh with
[55:19] his with his brother uh he could walk
[55:22] off with his brothers amen who praise
[55:25] God he he could have gone in this
[55:27] direction that direction amen praise God
[55:30] but he chose rather to be with the
[55:35] people of God here amen there's me not
[55:39] only brother Gabriel but there's others
[55:41] here don't have they didn't have to be
[55:44] here they appear like nobody or nothing
[55:46] to you but they didn't have to be here
[55:49] they going to be somewhere else living a
[55:51] high life and walking with society and
[55:55] the highest levels of society and
[55:57] everything else but God's spirit in
[56:01] their heart and lives they made a choice
[56:05] to be here in the house of God with the
[56:08] people of God not just because of you
[56:11] but I've caught a revelation I've caught
[56:14] an anointing of this last prophet's
[56:17] message I've heard the seventh Thunders
[56:20] blast and I heard the voice the mighty
[56:22] Angel has spoken amen and I recognize
[56:26] what he is saying praise the Lord oh
[56:29] praise God forever more and praise God
[56:33] he suffered with the people of God
[56:35] rather to enjoy the pleasures of sin and
[56:39] esteeming the reproach of Christ greater
[56:42] riches than the treasures of Egypt re oh
[56:47] my to take the reproach for the word and
[56:51] counting that to be greater riches to
[56:54] bear the reproach for this word can we
[56:57] all do that today if you are not doing
[56:59] that do that today commit yourself like
[57:02] Mary did to Bear the reproach of
[57:05] carrying the word let's carry this
[57:08] message amen and not be ashamed of it we
[57:11] don't have to be ashamed of it we don't
[57:13] have to apologize to nobody it's God
[57:16] doing it this is not my doing your doing
[57:19] this church is not my church or whatever
[57:21] I was just a vessel you are just a
[57:25] we not here for nothing else but to
[57:27] serve the true and the Living God Amen
[57:30] if you got some other motive than that
[57:32] try out the door try out the window

[1:00:18] them leave it to the brothers or any
[1:00:20] other preacher that might be listening
[1:00:23] or watching

[1:04:37] and I bought one bottle for
[1:04:39] $20,000 one sip of this oh my see they

[1:05:19] so but we see that is what's going on

[1:05:49] the last minute he could get the bo
[1:05:52] right but before before he come to it
[1:05:55] his brother already got
[1:05:57] it see what about bam and and this one
[1:06:02] is more appointed he was a
[1:06:04] preacher and and he was not just a
[1:06:06] preacher he was a god anointed
[1:06:10] preacher bam was a
[1:06:12] Pentecostal you know that he was
[1:06:15] anointed but he didn't have the
[1:06:17] revelation of the
[1:06:19] word and here bam turned around and sold
[1:06:23] out a genuine gift they think having
[1:06:27] gifts is a glorious thing to have a gift
[1:06:31] no brother Bram said no do you said do
[1:06:33] you know that Wizards and witches is a
[1:06:37] similar gift to what I have but they
[1:06:40] surrender that gift to the
[1:06:43] devil they surrender it for the devil to
[1:06:46] use it and this is surrender to God you
[1:06:50] see so being a Pentecostal and having
[1:06:52] gifts of this and gifts so that that's
[1:06:55] wonderful that's marvelous but that's
[1:06:57] not the word of yah back to the word
[1:07:01] back to the Revelation back to God
[1:07:03] himself hallelujah amen so bam did what
[1:07:08] he sold out his ability to preach and
[1:07:10] man and and deliver the word and to
[1:07:13] reveal truth and to prophesy and to warn
[1:07:16] generations to come for a big
[1:07:20] purse from a pagan King filthy LCA
[1:07:25] private
[1:07:27] jet
[1:07:29] amen thank you Jes is that right am
[1:07:32] don't get too quiet because I might
[1:07:34] think you're not agreeing with me but
[1:07:36] actually I'm pushing you away by
[1:07:38] preaching about private
[1:07:40] jets private jets having a whole set set
[1:07:44] of bodyguards around you you're a
[1:07:46] preacher and you got to have a whole set
[1:07:48] of bodyguards around you to protect you
[1:07:51] you can't go anywhere in a simple car no
[1:07:54] it's got to be a stretch limo it's got
[1:07:57] to be a bentle it's got to be something
[1:08:00] of that nature then you find you a
[1:08:02] preacher is that right I was in New York
[1:08:06] and there is one uh uh female Bishop God
[1:08:09] forbid but I have to tell you the truth
[1:08:12] but a female bishop and she invited a
[1:08:15] certain Bishop from Georgia to come and
[1:08:18] have meetings in her Tabernacle her
[1:08:21] Temple which was very large in the sense
[1:08:23] that she had was large she had about 250
[1:08:26] people she invited this bishop and uh uh
[1:08:30] he says yes uh he said you know um how
[1:08:34] many members he said oh I only have 250
[1:08:37] he says oh he says no I can't come he
[1:08:40] says that can't even pay for an hour of
[1:08:42] jet fuel from
[1:08:45] my from my private
[1:08:48] jet so he turned it down he couldn't
[1:08:50] come he has to go somewhere else that
[1:08:53] has thousands of people that can do that
[1:08:56] right you see this is the world we are
[1:08:59] living in and while this is going on
[1:09:02] around us we keep our eyes upon the word
[1:09:05] of
[1:09:06] God and do you think people like us will
[1:09:09] grow more and more if you're thinking
[1:09:12] that way no it gets less and less is
[1:09:18] right you're cooking the food starts out
[1:09:20] with a whole big pot and by the time it
[1:09:22] starts to Stew down

[1:09:26] handful is that right I'm not telling
[1:09:29] you that's going to happen in this
[1:09:31] particular church I'm talking about the
[1:09:34] message as a whole God still is going to
[1:09:36] choose whether when he was throwing out
[1:09:39] the seeds as the Divine planter whether
[1:09:42] a handful is going to fall here or a
[1:09:44] whole basket full going to fall over
[1:09:46] there or 5,000 fall here or five over
[1:09:49] there I don't know that's up to God but

[1:09:57] us here and give us this facility amen
[1:10:00] God and I believe God will fill it and
[1:10:03] God is going to give you a brand new
[1:10:06] facility after a while not maybe not now
[1:10:09] not because I made plans or I talk of
[1:10:11] plans with the pastor or anybody I am
[1:10:15] the one that's talking here now not
[1:10:17] because of what I hear or think or
[1:10:19] whatever but it's what I I'm telling you
[1:10:21] what I'm seeing praise the Lord that God

[1:10:27] facility it's going to be different
[1:10:30] praise the Lord everything is going to
[1:10:32] be changed praise God hallelujah but I
[1:10:35] want you to know that that the message
[1:10:37] as a whole you're going to find a lot of
[1:10:41] Jews who say they are Jews and are not
[1:10:43] but Liars don't recognize the word but
[1:10:46] still quoting and talking and message
[1:10:49] and everything else that those are the
[1:10:52] deceivers what's going to deceive you
[1:10:55] somebody close to you when the devil
[1:10:58] want to deceive Adam where you think he
[1:11:00] goes he he didn't go and find a a a some
[1:11:04] kind of a poisonous snake out there
[1:11:06] didn't find he didn't even come himself
[1:11:08] personally trying to talk to Adam he
[1:11:10] knew that's a waste of time but he goes
[1:11:13] to that is closest to him today it's the
[1:11:15] church so the devil wants will come to
[1:11:18] the church and try to uh take control of
[1:11:22] the mind and heart part of the church he
[1:11:25] tried to displace Adam in his position

[1:14:29] worship some savior nailed on a cross
[1:14:33] amen these things are only
[1:14:35] representations that we use but the fact
[1:14:38] is we come here to worship an unseen
[1:14:43] God the the Unseen presence of God and
[1:14:46] not just to lift our hands but to
[1:14:48] experience God by him revealing himself

[1:15:46] to warm yourself from Luther's Revival
[1:15:49] Wesley
[1:15:50] Revival you can't warm yourself with
[1:15:52] that how you going to come to that you

[1:15:58] present tense God who meets your needs
[1:16:02] meet our needs who is here in this day
[1:16:05] with this generation meeting the word
[1:16:08] for this hour that's what we are here
[1:16:10] for praise God Amen yes sir so Judas
[1:16:15] made a bad decision after he heard all
[1:16:17] those sermons he heard all the messages
[1:16:21] he he know all the quotes he he can out
[1:16:23] quat you matter fact he can bury you
[1:16:25] with coats and and everything else like
[1:16:28] that and still he didn't recognize who
[1:16:31] Jesus
[1:16:32] was what you mean to tell me that I can
[1:16:36] have all brother bram's sermons messages
[1:16:39] and book form and video form and voice
[1:16:42] form and every possible form and I can
[1:16:45] be hearing them day in day out sleeping
[1:16:47] waking up with them and still not
[1:16:49] recognize him no you will not recognize
[1:16:52] them because no man can come unto me
[1:16:56] unless my father draws him thank you
[1:17:00] they will know when it's time for them
[1:17:03] to
[1:17:04] know amen yes sir oh my I open and no
[1:17:09] man shuts and when I shut your eyes no
[1:17:13] man can open it no Theologian no no
[1:17:16] explanation from no wise man can open up
[1:17:19] your eyes because I hold the Bible says
[1:17:22] Book of Revelation I hold the key of
[1:17:24] David and when I shut no man can open
[1:17:28] and if I open your eyes even if you
[1:17:31] yourself Paul said even if my own heart
[1:17:33] Tred to condemn me God is greater than
[1:17:35] my heart I can't even doubt it anymore
[1:17:37] because I'm seeing it too plain it's
[1:17:40] clear it's part of the word and I see it
[1:17:42] here in the word of God hallelujah that
[1:17:45] keeps me going praise the Lord my God
[1:17:49] you're getting old you're getting tired
[1:17:51] you feel weary you haven't done nothing
[1:17:53] and yet you feel tired you start feeling
[1:17:55] weary but praise God brother that's not
[1:17:58] stopping me this outward man made Decay
[1:18:01] but the inward man on the inside is
[1:18:03] growing stronger every day it's getting
[1:18:06] richer in the word of God and
[1:18:08] recognizing what God has done and is
[1:18:10] doing amen praise God hallelujah but
[1:18:14] look at the ends of these people that
[1:18:16] were so negative a lot of us made
[1:18:19] negative choice but thank God you're in
[1:18:21] here today I would say most of all
[1:18:23] because you recognize somewhere along
[1:18:25] the line I can't explain it but I I I
[1:18:28] think I made some wrong choices is that
[1:18:31] right don't get scared I'm not going to
[1:18:33] ask you to raise your
[1:18:35] hand but we all know it I made wrong
[1:18:38] choices too praise God I'm not saying
[1:18:40] I'm making wrong choice with my
[1:18:44] wife that was a right
[1:18:47] choice but she has to tell you if she
[1:18:50] made the wrong
[1:18:51] choice
[1:18:57] but the point is here you get the point
[1:19:00] I'm making here that you they made wrong
[1:19:04] choices and then Judas went out and hang
[1:19:07] himself and but thank God the Bible
[1:19:11] gives us positive examples in the Bible
[1:19:15] and the first of these is
[1:19:17] job in job
[1:19:21] 2:9 the the Bible tells us and you know
[1:19:25] the background of job job was the
[1:19:26] richest man in his day having a big Camp
[1:19:30] a company with camels that took Goods
[1:19:32] across the desert and and and and he was
[1:19:35] paid gobs and gobs of money very wealthy
[1:19:39] very very wealthy man and then one day
[1:19:43] the Bible tells us Satan went up into
[1:19:45] heaven not because of something you done
[1:19:47] the devil always like to put it that way
[1:19:49] it's your fault this happened and that
[1:19:51] happened it's it's his fault is no the
[1:19:55] devil in the background is working these
[1:19:57] things to stir up chaos and trouble in
[1:20:00] our lives and we got to recognize it
[1:20:03] Bible says he went up into the presence
[1:20:05] of God and he said look at that job he's
[1:20:09] only rich like that because you blessing
[1:20:11] him he says he's only worshiping you
[1:20:14] because uh you know you're there
[1:20:17] protecting him he said you take off your
[1:20:19] hand and let me get a chance at him you
[1:20:21] going to see how fast he going to curse
[1:20:22] your name
[1:20:23] it's right in your Bible you got to read
[1:20:25] it job and and God says
[1:20:29] okay but don't take his
[1:20:32] life try him test him prove him but
[1:20:36] don't take his life you know some Trials
[1:20:39] come like that that you almost feel the
[1:20:41] next step is death the next step is
[1:20:44] suicide then I can't take this no more
[1:20:47] you think you can't but God knows what
[1:20:49] is in you and a devil can't go further
[1:20:52] than what God tell him yes he says I
[1:20:55] command even the sea the waves can't go
[1:20:57] further up on the shore unless I tell
[1:20:59] them right they got to go back amen it's
[1:21:03] the same in our lives so chest come and
[1:21:06] it will stretch you to your limit where
[1:21:09] you feel I'm dead I can't go on this is
[1:21:13] too much it's you mean God don't know
[1:21:16] what's happening yes he does but he's
[1:21:18] letting it happen so that you come to a
[1:21:20] point where you give up and say I can't
[1:21:22] do this more Lord I rely on you you take
[1:21:25] it over that's what he waiting for when
[1:21:28] you going to give him over and say Lord
[1:21:30] you take over
[1:21:32] amen
[1:21:34] so God uses job was rich like that and
[1:21:38] God get his children a windstorm came
[1:21:41] and kill every one of them one day they
[1:21:45] all gone and while he mourning for the
[1:21:48] children news come again his Trucking
[1:21:50] Company gone bankrupt
[1:21:53] news come again the hordes of sheep that
[1:21:55] he had Bandits and every robbers come
[1:21:58] and take it
[1:21:59] away everyone part of his wealth taken
[1:22:03] away from him and then look the devil
[1:22:06] turn around go straight to his wife now
[1:22:08] instead of the wife encouraging job and
[1:22:11] saying man look at what you go through
[1:22:14] is you know let's pray or something like
[1:22:16] that listen job 2:9 then said his wife
[1:22:20] unto him thust thou still rain your
[1:22:24] integrity do you still believe that
[1:22:27] stuff you've been talking about message
[1:22:30] do you still believe the word of God you
[1:22:33] still have faith in the midst of all
[1:22:35] these
[1:22:36] trials Dost
[1:22:38] thou retain thine
[1:22:41] Integrity Curse God and die come out of
[1:22:46] that message get away from that word
[1:22:48] move out of that stuff oh my job 13 15
[1:22:53] you know what job's response was listen
[1:22:56] though he slay me yet will I trust him I
[1:23:02] will maintain my own ways in other words
[1:23:05] my Integrity I will maintain my own ways
[1:23:09] before him Hallelujah that's the stand
[1:23:13] the believer should take can you say
[1:23:15] Amen can you say
[1:23:19] amen I maintain my integrity I'll stand
[1:23:23] by the word until the crown I gain amen
[1:23:27] hallelujah amen I'll pass by Jacob you
[1:23:30] can deal with that I just touch a few of
[1:23:32] them what about this Moses we were
[1:23:34] touching about and we read the scripture
[1:23:37] from him what about him how he esteemed
[1:23:39] the reproach praise God I'll pass over
[1:23:42] that he's an example of making a choice
[1:23:45] amen and the choice taking him in the
[1:23:48] right place so young people even us who
[1:23:51] are old the ones let us make the right
[1:23:56] choices it's you don't blame somebody
[1:24:01] else things are happening and has
[1:24:04] happened because of former choices that
[1:24:07] we made is that right but now God is
[1:24:11] showing you that so from now on you have
[1:24:14] the ability and the
[1:24:16] opportunity to make the proper and the
[1:24:19] right choices so that God Spirit can
[1:24:23] guide you he said I will guide you with
[1:24:26] my eyes not what your eyes seeing but I
[1:24:29] will guide you with my eyes is that
[1:24:32] right I'll go before you I'll protect
[1:24:35] you I'll send my angel before you to
[1:24:38] protect you and provide your way clear
[1:24:40] the way and prepare your way for the
[1:24:43] steps of a righteous man or woman are
[1:24:46] ordained of the
[1:24:48] Lord ordained of the Lord you know God's
[1:24:52] has certain things that he has that you
[1:24:54] must do while you are here on this Earth
[1:24:56] is that right he knows what you're going
[1:24:58] to do before you do it and so he says I
[1:25:01] I can guide you into that or else you're
[1:25:03] going to stumble around trying to find
[1:25:05] what is the path where you should be in
[1:25:07] but let me guide you let me have the way
[1:25:10] praise the Lord I'm trying not to spend

[1:40:51] choice think about Ruth some of these
[1:40:54] old nuggets are here I want to just hit
[1:40:58] some highlights on these nuggets Ruth
[1:41:00] was willing to forsake all her
[1:41:03] Idols is that right we're not talking
[1:41:06] about them Idols they used to put on the
[1:41:08] wall but but you start to forsake your
[1:41:11] your Idols whether you're singing Idols
[1:41:13] whether it's Jame Bronx that can do a
[1:41:15] moonwalk or whether it's Taylor twist
[1:41:18] that can do the twist or whether
[1:41:26] oh my see God is she forsook her
[1:41:30] Idols she got out of Hollywood and went
[1:41:33] into the holy Woods is that right she
[1:41:37] instead of coming and being a Hollywood
[1:41:39] star she recognized that she is a
[1:41:41] morning star from the presence of the
[1:41:43] Living God Amen yes sir she forsook her
[1:41:47] Idols she forsook all of our past life
[1:41:51] whatever it might be she forsook her
[1:41:54] people her own people she forsook her
[1:41:58] people forsake
[1:42:01] everything amen and return back with
[1:42:05] Naomi no matter what circumstances were
[1:42:09] there he was willing to go on that's the
[1:42:14] way that every man or woman that comes
[1:42:18] to Christ must first be will
[1:42:21] in
[1:42:23] regardless I never like to tell the
[1:42:25] people oh you're going to prosper you're
[1:42:27] going to be rich now and God is going to
[1:42:30] bless you you ain't going to have no
[1:42:31] sickness you're not going to have no
[1:42:33] problem I don't promise that because God
[1:42:36] doesn't promise them that I say that if
[1:42:38] you're really born in your heart I don't
[1:42:40] care how rough the road gets you'll
[1:42:42] still hold to God's unchanging
[1:42:45] hand is that
[1:42:48] right oh praise God I'm not here to
[1:42:51] preach but the next time we'll preach on
[1:42:53] God's economy how God wants some of his
[1:42:57] people to be rich so that he can they
[1:43:00] can turn around and support his kingdom
[1:43:02] of what he's doing he'll put some in a
[1:43:05] middle class he'll put some here he'll
[1:43:06] put some and he'll put some right in the
[1:43:09] bottom not he'll provide their every
[1:43:11] need but they'll be at the bottom so
[1:43:14] they can witness they can speak to
[1:43:16] people on that level because this one
[1:43:18] that's way up at the top it's hard for
[1:43:20] him to come down and meet some of those
[1:43:22] people at that level so he scatter Us in
[1:43:25] all levels of society and community that
[1:43:28] we can be able to speak to those that
[1:43:31] are uh to be riched with the God's word
[1:43:35] amen oh yes praise God oh my yes sir we
[1:43:39] must come to that place if Jesus goes
[1:43:41] with me I'll go long as he goes That's
[1:43:45] all that is necessary praise the Lord
[1:43:48] amen praise God what about Esther did
[1:43:52] you think of
[1:43:53] her that she had to make a choice she
[1:43:56] was already queen of Iran Queen of
[1:43:59] Persia pers in the Bible it's Iran is
[1:44:02] called
[1:44:03] Persia and Persia is where Babylon was
[1:44:07] that is where Nebuchadnezzar was king so
[1:44:09] it's an ancient uh community and an
[1:44:12] ancient culture that they had there
[1:44:15] praise the Lord and you know at one time
[1:44:18] Nebuchadnezzar was worshiping all kinds
[1:44:20] of Gods even wanted to was worship
[1:44:22] Danielle but when the Revelation begin
[1:44:24] to strike him and he begins to see then
[1:44:26] he says your God is God Amen and he
[1:44:30] started serving God then his son his
[1:44:32] grandson start taking the nation away
[1:44:35] from the original teaching of the word
[1:44:37] of God now listen brother Brandon
[1:44:40] speaking now Romans 8:17 to18 if you are
[1:44:44] children then ears ears of God joint
[1:44:47] ears with Christ if so be that you
[1:44:50] suffer with him that you may be also
[1:44:52] glorified together for I reckon the
[1:44:55] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:44:58] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:45:00] which shall be revealed in us oh praise
[1:45:04] God there's Glory being revealed in us
[1:45:06] here today I believe there's Glory being
[1:45:09] revealed in every one of us that
[1:45:11] believes this word of God you can't see
[1:45:13] it but you are a shining light for the
[1:45:16] glory of God every one of us is a little
[1:45:18] bright shining star amen you shine in
[1:45:21] your corner Let Me Shine in mine
[1:45:24] continuing brother
[1:45:25] bradam let me unless we suffer with him
[1:45:30] we cannot reign with him you have to
[1:45:34] suffer to rain and the reason for this
[1:45:38] is that character is simply never made
[1:45:43] without
[1:45:44] suffering the seed that's in you is
[1:45:48] never going to be able to fully manif
[1:45:50] manest and come into its maturity and
[1:45:54] the character of Christ that is in there
[1:45:57] is not going to be able to express
[1:45:59] itself suffering the fire and the
[1:46:03] furnace of suffering and trial brings
[1:46:06] that out is not that your life is going
[1:46:08] to be spent and your entire life in
[1:46:10] suffering but every child got to uh pass
[1:46:14] through um correction with their parents
[1:46:18] is that right he says if you are my
[1:46:20] children then I have a right to correct
[1:46:22] you don't I have a right to test you to
[1:46:24] try you to prove you amen then one day
[1:46:28] you're going to come to a maturity when
[1:46:29] you don't need that no more and you're
[1:46:31] going to walk by yourself in the word
[1:46:34] hallelujah amen see character is a
[1:46:38] victory not a gift a man without
[1:46:43] character can't
[1:46:46] rain is that
[1:46:48] right because
[1:46:50] power from apart from character is
[1:46:55] satanic if you don't have the character
[1:46:58] to control the power that you revealed
[1:47:01] it will just become evil and satanic
[1:47:06] amen yes sir so but but Power with
[1:47:11] character fit to rule it's fit to rule
[1:47:16] praise God you'll find that um in the
[1:47:19] church age is I want to give you so you
[1:47:22] find a place there a sman church age
