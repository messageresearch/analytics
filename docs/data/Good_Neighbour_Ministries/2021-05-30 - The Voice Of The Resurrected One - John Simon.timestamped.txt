[0:00] [Music]
[0:15] good sunday morning friends
[0:18] and thank you for being here
[0:21] and again thank you for the opportunity
[0:25] of being able to speak to you
[0:28] you who represent
[0:31] the bride of jesus christ
[0:34] the true church of the living god
[0:37] in these last days it is my
[0:42] honor given to me by god
[0:46] to preach his word and to be a
[0:49] blessing to your hearts and lives
[0:53] may the lord bless us all together
[0:57] as we come in as one
[1:00] in christ to him be the glory
[1:05] the honor and the praise
[1:08] my topic for today
[1:11] will be the voice
[1:16] of the resurrected one
[1:21] amen may the lord bless us all
[1:25] as we come together in his name
[1:30] my scripture is found in revelation
[1:33] chapter 1.
[1:36] reading from verse 17
[1:39] and verse 18
[1:45] and it reads and
[1:48] when i saw him i
[1:52] fell at his feet
[1:55] as dead and he
[1:58] laid his right hand upon me saying unto
[2:02] me
[2:03] fear not i am the first and the last
[2:09] i am he that liveth and was
[2:13] dead and behold
[2:16] i am alive forevermore
[2:20] amen and have the keys
[2:24] of hell and of death
[2:28] praise be to god for the reading of his
[2:31] word
[2:32] let us pray together
[2:37] our gracious god
[2:40] our heavenly father as we come in the
[2:44] name of jesus christ
[2:46] we ask your blessing
[2:50] upon the word of god upon the minister
[2:54] of the word
[2:56] upon the people that are here to receive
[2:59] the word
[3:01] wherever they are
[3:04] may my voice be heard father
[3:07] and may the great holy spirit use it as
[3:10] a vehicle
[3:12] to convey his truth
[3:16] that may bring light into the dark
[3:19] corners of the earth we
[3:22] ask this in no other name but in the
[3:25] name of our blessed lord jesus
[3:30] amen
[3:32] the voice of the resurrected one
[3:37] john is giving us the picture
[3:41] of him being on the isle of patmos
[3:45] and he hears a voice behind him
[3:49] and the bible tells us he turns to see
[3:53] the voice or the person from whom the
[3:56] voice came
[3:59] and when he turned and looked he saw it
[4:02] was jesus
[4:05] and jesus spoke to him
[4:08] and was telling him i
[4:11] am the first and the last
[4:14] i am he that liveth and
[4:18] was dead now you know according to
[4:21] history even in bible genealogy
[4:24] you will read over and over again
[4:29] and adam lived for so many hundred years
[4:33] and he died and methuselah lived
[4:36] for a thousand years of whatever and he
[4:39] died
[4:41] and noah lived for so many years and he
[4:44] died
[4:45] but when we read about the lord jesus
[4:48] christ
[4:50] he turns and says i am he that
[4:53] was dead but i am alive forevermore
[4:58] praise be to god here he is
[5:01] the ever-living one the mighty christ
[5:05] risen from the dead the resurrected one
[5:11] and today i'm speaking on the voice
[5:15] of this resurrected one
[5:18] i can say voice of the
[5:22] resurrection for he is the resurrection
[5:26] and the life he is the rapture
[5:30] he is all in all this
[5:33] jesus whom we love and serve
[5:36] may ye declare himself by the word of
[5:40] god
[5:41] now we know that
[5:45] the early church was in the image
[5:50] of the second adam
[5:53] it was formed and shaped
[5:57] not by organization
[6:01] but it was shaped by the hand of the
[6:04] great holy
[6:05] spirit of the living god
[6:08] they were so much like jesus
[6:12] in their walk in their talk in their
[6:14] actions
[6:16] they were like him and so ought wheat to
[6:19] be
[6:20] to be like jesus in everything
[6:23] we do and say oh praise
[6:26] god the bible says they took knowledge
[6:30] of them
[6:32] that they had been with jesus hallelujah
[6:36] you know when you are uh the wife of
[6:39] someone
[6:40] or a good friend of someone somehow
[6:44] you begin to pick up each other's
[6:47] ways habits and certain peculiarities
[6:52] here the scripture says they
[6:55] took knowledge that these people had
[6:58] been with jesus oh praise god
[7:02] may it be on our record that we
[7:05] spent time with the lord we come to
[7:08] know the lord in the power of his
[7:11] resurrection
[7:12] until we we don't have to tell anyone
[7:15] i'm a christian
[7:17] because just looking at you perceiving
[7:21] your actions your attitudes your
[7:23] intentions
[7:24] and motivations their real lives from
[7:28] your
[7:28] the sweetness of your spirit amen
[7:32] from your action and your attitude they
[7:34] can recognize the christ
[7:36] in you god in christ christ in the
[7:40] church
[7:40] the kingdom being restored back again
[7:43] blessed be the name of the lord
[7:45] hallelujah
[7:47] the early church
[7:51] is the resurrected christ
[7:56] working and acting through his
[8:00] earthly body that early church
[8:05] that was there and he they were
[8:08] in seoul they were in such harmony with
[8:12] him
[8:14] or he the head was in such
[8:17] harmony with his body
[8:20] that they were just working together
[8:24] perfectly in signs
[8:27] wonders salvation manifestations of god
[8:31] movings of the holy spirit one sermon on
[8:35] the day of pentecost
[8:37] 3 000 were born again by the grace of
[8:41] god hallelujah
[8:42] why because christ the resurrected one
[8:46] was working through his earthly body
[8:51] which in his body is the church of the
[8:54] living god
[8:55] displaying the same kind of
[8:58] oneness that was there
[9:02] in the garden between adam and eve
[9:06] before the fall and now
[9:10] when he has come back to his people
[9:14] and bringing them back to himself and to
[9:17] his word
[9:18] then we see that oneness
[9:22] that union that uniting
[9:25] just emerging again that
[9:28] oneness is emerging again
[9:31] where there is hardly you can hardly
[9:34] pass a a razor blade between
[9:39] christ uh standing alone
[9:42] or jesus christ in the people because
[9:45] they're becoming
[9:46] so much like him the headstone
[9:50] praise god that you can hardly pass a
[9:52] razor blade between them
[9:54] because they can now say i and my
[9:58] father are one lord of god oneness in
[10:01] understanding oneness in the revelation
[10:05] oneness in the anointing oneness in the
[10:08] word of god
[10:09] for i recognize you should recognize
[10:12] that i am a part of that word
[10:16] praise god hallelujah that's why i
[10:18] understand that's why you will
[10:21] understand the word when you begin to
[10:24] recognize that you you have not you're
[10:27] not just
[10:28] here yesterday or 40 years or 20 years
[10:32] ago
[10:33] but you weren't in the mind of god
[10:36] before the foundation of the world
[10:40] but it's now made known to you
[10:43] and and you realize and recognize
[10:47] that you are not just a child of time
[10:50] but you are a woman a man that
[10:53] come from the presence of almighty god
[10:56] and you're going back to god hallelujah
[11:00] amen amen praise god hallelujah
[11:04] now realize the first
[11:07] eve that was in the garden with adam
[11:12] she fell because she was she allowed
[11:15] herself to be
[11:17] seduced by the false teaching
[11:20] of the serpent satan
[11:24] satan in the serpent
[11:27] which was not a snake at the time for
[11:29] the bible said it walked it talked
[11:31] it had reasoning powers it was smart and
[11:34] so on
[11:35] anyway the fact is she was seduced by
[11:39] the serpent
[11:41] this is a lie of the modern church
[11:45] that they will not address for they do
[11:48] not want to get in their pulpits
[11:51] and talk about the subject like this
[11:54] because to some ears
[11:58] it may sound a bit raw it may sound
[12:01] out of line but it's not out the line
[12:04] for it is in the word of
[12:05] god god speaks of it that she did
[12:09] not eat an apple to become pregnant with
[12:12] cane
[12:13] she did not eat a pier
[12:16] it was not a pear on the tree it was a
[12:19] pear on the ground
[12:20] and the result was a hybrid born
[12:24] uh boy by the name of cain who was
[12:28] filled with anger and every hateful
[12:32] attitude contrary to
[12:35] how adam was abel
[12:38] being adam's son and cain
[12:41] being the son of the serpent or the
[12:44] serpent's
[12:45] seed oh my she bore them
[12:48] twins one for god one of the devil
[12:52] even saw in the modern church justice
[12:56] came
[12:56] he fell back there the modern church has
[13:00] failed again in the presence of god
[13:04] and is allowing herself to be
[13:07] pregnated by false doctrine
[13:10] false teaching and the seed
[13:14] ideas precepts principles
[13:17] lies of satan has failed her
[13:21] and now she is producing what
[13:24] to theologians professors
[13:28] instead of possessors oh my praise
[13:32] god men that are looking for
[13:35] profits instead of being profit
[13:39] of god being a real prophet of god a
[13:42] real
[13:42] minister and man of god that will
[13:45] shoot the gospel gun barrel straight
[13:49] hallelujah so that you will know the
[13:51] truth and the truths will
[13:53] set you free amen and so
[13:56] he fell back there and they fell into
[14:00] sin but when the church fell
[14:03] at nicaea council they fell into the
[14:06] dark ages
[14:08] oh my take upon it brother sister
[14:12] here we are but thank god
[14:15] true this time of luther
[14:18] wesley pentecost god
[14:22] was starting to shine the light and
[14:25] bring
[14:25] back his word again and now
[14:28] we are in the midst what we are
[14:31] experiencing
[14:33] is the restoration of god's
[14:36] bride tree hallelujah
[14:40] the tree of god oh the wife of god
[14:44] that was separated from him glory to god
[14:48] now the holy spirit is bringing
[14:51] back a restoration bringing it back to
[14:55] the place
[14:56] amen and so once again
[15:00] god has a bride or
[15:03] calling a bride so that he would be
[15:06] able to have another move of god
[15:10] he would have another revival he would
[15:13] have another time of refreshing in the
[15:15] presence of god
[15:17] he will have another latter and former
[15:20] reign why
[15:21] because now he has a bride
[15:24] oh my where he can reproduce
[15:28] himself praise god amen
[15:31] reproduce himself again and the people
[15:34] can recognize
[15:36] that he is the same yesterday today
[15:39] and forever praise god hallelujah
[15:43] oh my do you realize friends
[15:47] brother branham came on the scene
[15:50] and many know of the fact
[15:54] that he spoke the word
[15:58] and squirrels suddenly were created
[16:04] suddenly they appeared on the branch
[16:08] and he shot them and killed them
[16:12] they were not his imagination
[16:15] it was real the spoken word being the
[16:19] original seed the creative force
[16:24] the power of the life of god
[16:27] moving and operating through a human
[16:31] being
[16:32] all to display to the rest of us
[16:37] that what we saw operating and moving
[16:40] in that prophet that minister of god
[16:44] you with a surrendered and open heart
[16:49] god will use you man woman
[16:52] child whoever you are if thou
[16:56] canst believe all things are possible
[17:00] does them that will believe the word of
[17:04] god
[17:06] god used that man
[17:09] in a mighty miraculous wonderful way
[17:15] and it was marvelous to see the
[17:17] multitude of miracle signs and wonders
[17:20] but the greatest things my brother
[17:24] was the preaching of the word
[17:27] for all things come from the word of god
[17:31] from the beginning
[17:32] of time in the book of genesis
[17:35] that nothing could appear nothing could
[17:38] come
[17:39] nothing could was made that was not made
[17:42] or created by god's spoken word
[17:46] and god said and it was so and god
[17:49] said and it was so god said
[17:52] and it was so it remains the
[17:56] same thing today you must go
[18:00] back to the word and see what god said
[18:03] and then when you believe what god said
[18:07] then the rest is fulfilled and it is so
[18:11] god fulfills his word
[18:14] one time he was in a storm
[18:18] and the black light the thunder the
[18:22] darkness
[18:22] came around and the blowing of the wind
[18:27] couldn't find his way out of the woods
[18:31] went in circles dead man's walk
[18:36] and then he heard a voice behind him
[18:38] saying
[18:39] oh just trust me
[18:43] believe raise up your hands
[18:46] and when he raised his hands it touched
[18:50] on a wire that was leading right
[18:53] down to the bottom of the mountain or
[18:55] the hill
[18:57] and he was able to follow that and get
[18:59] himself
[19:00] out of that situation
[19:03] my friends god's program
[19:07] is always genuinely based
[19:11] on the spoken word of god
[19:16] let there be let there be
[19:20] read genesis one you'll cheat they
[19:23] right on my friends it's always the case
[19:27] even hebrew says the worlds were
[19:31] framed by the word of god and
[19:34] nothing was made that could be made
[19:37] except by the word of god
[19:40] amen and it has not changed
[19:45] so we must rely not on the words of
[19:48] man beautiful uh dissertations beautiful
[19:53] deliberations of wonderful
[19:55] argumentations
[19:57] logic of beyond your your your
[20:00] imagination
[20:01] don't you rely on that that's wonderful
[20:04] that's marvelous it's to be admired
[20:07] but let me tell you we ought to rest
[20:11] our face upon the unfailing
[20:14] word of god the unchanging word and say
[20:17] like martin luther
[20:19] here i stand so help me god
[20:22] rest your faith in the rock revelation
[20:26] of god's word that is unfolding
[20:29] before your eyes amen so god
[20:32] is unchanging in his ways
[20:37] and he always creates by his
[20:41] spoken word god has set a
[20:45] time and a season for everything
[20:49] you know that the book of eclipse yes
[20:52] this tells you
[20:52] that there's a season and a time to
[20:55] everything there is a season
[20:58] and there's a time for everything under
[21:01] the sun hallelujah
[21:05] you see adam and eve should have waited
[21:10] god would have spoken to adam
[21:15] and told him it's time for there to be
[21:18] another son
[21:20] or another daughter
[21:23] then adam would have turned and spoken
[21:26] to
[21:27] eve a type of the church like how jesus
[21:29] is speaking to us
[21:31] as his church now and then
[21:34] she eve would take adam's word
[21:38] and speak it and the child
[21:42] son or daughter would be created
[21:46] instantly by the spoken word
[21:49] even so jesus
[21:52] who being the word john 1 1 in the
[21:55] beginning was the word the word was with
[21:57] god
[21:58] and the word was not a god but the word
[22:02] was god and the word is
[22:05] god same yesterday today
[22:08] and forever and he speaks his word to
[22:12] his wife
[22:14] his church his bride and now what is the
[22:17] bride supposed to do
[22:19] take the very word that was given to her
[22:23] and speak the word again hallelujah
[22:26] and it what does it do it brings about
[22:30] that creative ability creation comes
[22:34] again
[22:35] miracle signs wonders salvation
[22:38] eternal life manifestations of god
[22:42] multitudes moved by the word and power
[22:45] of the holy spirit
[22:47] why because it's the great i am the
[22:50] mighty
[22:51] god the everlasting christ amen that has
[22:54] returned once more to the earth again
[22:57] oh yes he spoke in the word
[23:00] hallelujah that at evening time it
[23:03] shall be light again the darkness that
[23:06] covered the earth
[23:08] covered the minds of god's people that
[23:11] darkness will be pushed away
[23:14] because with the rising of the sun
[23:18] the light of the sun just pushes the
[23:21] darkness
[23:22] out oh praise god brother sister
[23:25] i believe the light of god is shining
[23:28] into the eyes and minds and hearts of
[23:31] those that
[23:32] want to believe amen for the paths of us
[23:36] justin man or woman shine it
[23:39] more and more until they walk into the
[23:42] rapture day
[23:43] into that great perfect day hallelujah
[23:47] amen yes sir oh
[23:50] jesus said john 5 19
[23:55] the son can do nothing of himself
[23:59] but whatever he sees the father doing
[24:02] do it amen now
[24:06] jesus had that by vision
[24:09] by vision he knew
[24:12] what he ought to do brother branham by
[24:15] vision knew what he had to do
[24:19] we have the word of god revealed to us
[24:23] which is greater than a vision
[24:25] greater than a dream greater than any
[24:28] other gift
[24:30] is the word of god hallelujah
[24:33] and when the true genuine word of god
[24:37] is revealed to you it explodes within
[24:40] your soul
[24:41] oh praise god it creates a
[24:44] transformative force within you
[24:46] changes your life from the inside to the
[24:49] outside
[24:50] oh praise god your past is cast into the
[24:54] sea of forgetfulness
[24:55] and you have a second chance a new
[24:58] beginning
[24:59] where you can start all over again and
[25:02] commit or recommit your life to the hand
[25:06] of almighty god
[25:07] and he says you know he will not look
[25:10] back
[25:10] he will not forget you but he will
[25:13] forgive
[25:14] you cleanse you walk with you and take
[25:17] you
[25:17] until you come to the end of life's
[25:20] journey
[25:20] oh my hallelujah amen
[25:24] so adam should have spoken
[25:28] to eve god's word
[25:32] and eve should have spoken the word
[25:35] and brought about the creation of
[25:38] another
[25:39] seed son of god called from the
[25:43] dust of the earth just as how adam
[25:46] called god called adam
[25:50] and formed him from the dusted earth eve
[25:53] would have used the spoken word
[25:57] and that is how the human being
[26:01] originally should have been
[26:04] reproduced and how they should
[26:07] have multiplied on the face of the earth
[26:11] by god's spoken
[26:14] word but instead
[26:18] eve went ahead of god's
[26:22] program and she
[26:25] did what was in our own heart
[26:29] and used the instrument
[26:32] of sexual relations
[26:36] instead of the spoken
[26:39] word of the living god and
[26:42] that brought death on the face
[26:46] of the entire earth oh praise
[26:49] god brother sister here we are
[26:52] in this hour in which we are living in
[26:56] and seeing the fullness of the word
[27:00] of the living god oh praise his
[27:03] name you see i let me repeat
[27:08] eve should have spoken the word
[27:12] like adam spoke the word to eve
[27:16] and that word would have taken
[27:19] hallelujah and eve herself
[27:24] my friends would already have that
[27:27] son that daughter that child within her
[27:30] then she could speak it into existence
[27:34] and this is proven by the fact
[27:38] god is showing how
[27:42] children should have been brought forth
[27:44] how the human
[27:45] race should have been reproduced for
[27:48] when that
[27:49] hour was come when the word should be
[27:52] fulfilled
[27:54] the bible tells us in the book of
[27:56] matthew
[27:58] that the angel gabriel descended from
[28:00] heaven
[28:01] from the presence of god and stood
[28:04] before mary
[28:06] what did he do and he spoke god's
[28:10] spoken word seed
[28:13] into mary's womb
[28:17] amen mary believe
[28:21] the words of the angel
[28:24] that was spoken hallelujah
[28:28] and by believing the word or
[28:31] message of that angel
[28:35] she became impregnated
[28:40] by the spoken word of god
[28:44] and brought forth what
[28:47] a child which was the
[28:51] living word hallelujah
[28:54] the word of god in the
[28:58] form of a human being now thank god
[29:03] history always repeats itself
[29:07] in our day god sent another angel
[29:12] amen not abraham but his name
[29:16] happened to be william branham
[29:20] god's 20th century prophet
[29:24] and he came with the
[29:27] word of god and stood
[29:30] before a virgin bright
[29:33] church of the living god and brought to
[29:37] her
[29:38] the opening of the seven seals
[29:42] hallelujah he preached and brought to
[29:45] her
[29:46] the unveiling of the mighty god
[29:49] hallelujah she brought to her
[29:52] christ is the mystery of god being
[29:55] revealed
[29:56] glory to god hallelujah amen
[30:00] and furthermore brother branham said
[30:03] he said do you know
[30:06] that the mind is is the spiritual
[30:09] womb of today praise god
[30:13] so in other words when the
[30:16] angel messenger speaks
[30:19] just saith the lord the truth
[30:22] of the word of god and we receive it
[30:26] within the womb of the mind and heart
[30:30] our lives become pregnant with truth
[30:34] our lives become pregnant with the
[30:37] life-giving
[30:38] word of god within us praise god
[30:41] amen oh the mind is a womb
[30:45] and what the spoken word
[30:48] is the original seed oh praise god
[30:52] and we believe that and the seed
[30:55] has caught within the womb of our hearts
[30:59] glory to god and what is it bringing

[31:19] i'm a brand new woman i'm a brand new
[31:22] man
[31:23] because why i've been born again
[31:26] by the revelation of the word of god
[31:29] and i'm happy i'm so happy because the
[31:32] word has changed me amen
[31:35] o praises name glory to god

[31:49] back there
[31:50] but in the manger of your heart he is
[31:53] born again today
[31:55] oh praise god oh hallelujah
[31:59] oh the church age speaks to us saying
[32:03] and now what that does is
[32:06] flesh our flesh
[32:09] is changing back to become the word
[32:13] and he who is the word
[32:16] is coming back to being flesh in
[32:19] us so flesh is becoming word
[32:23] and word is becoming
[32:26] flesh glory to god hallelujah
[32:29] amen notice carefully brother sister
[32:34] that jesus was put into mary's womb
[32:39] by the spoken word
[32:43] and his body which was in the dust of
[32:48] the
[32:48] earth was called forth
[32:51] to connect with that seed
[32:55] which came forth as jesus christ
[32:59] hallelujah amen praise
[33:02] god hallelujah amen friends
[33:05] here we are in this last day
[33:08] and you and i have been put into
[33:12] god's church body or god's bride
[33:16] or god's wife's body by the spoken
[33:20] word of god is what called you it's what
[33:23] changed you
[33:24] it what's placed you in the body
[33:28] of the church which is pregnant with the
[33:31] truth
[33:32] with the revelation of this hour praise
[33:35] god hallelujah and here we are
[33:38] back to our text which we re we
[33:42] spoke on last week for the lord himself
[33:47] shall descend with a shout with the
[33:50] voice
[33:51] of the archangel or chief angel
[33:54] with the voice of the archangel and the
[33:57] trump of
[33:58] god hallelujah amen what do we see
[34:04] we see the picture that paul is
[34:06] presenting
[34:07] of jesus descending
[34:10] from the heavens spiritually descending
[34:15] here to do what to call
[34:18] his children from the dust of the earth
[34:22] to himself who is the word
[34:26] let me say that again jesus
[34:30] for this rapture
[34:33] he is descending and his reason for
[34:37] descending
[34:38] is to call his children from the
[34:42] dust of the earth to himself
[34:45] and he is the word so he is calling us
[34:49] back to the word back to the resurrected
[34:52] christ
[34:53] back to the ever-living one that was
[34:56] dead
[34:57] but is alive forevermore oh praise his
[35:00] marvelous name that is why we are here
[35:03] this morning
[35:04] to give glory and honor and praise to
[35:07] his mighty name
[35:08] somebody say amen somebody praise the
[35:12] lord out there
[35:13] somebody give him glory hallelujah
[35:16] somebody raise your hand and say
[35:19] hallelujah
[35:20] thank you lord jesus for your blessing
[35:23] and your hand on me here today
[35:25] oh bless his holy name amen amen
[35:29] oh praise god hallelujah
[35:32] why would he descend he is descending
[35:37] because he already knows
[35:40] that there are predestined
[35:44] seed for this age
[35:48] buried in the dust and
[35:51] dirt of humanity and denomination
[35:55] that he can utter his voice and his
[35:59] voice can crawl out those that were
[36:02] dead with dead doctrines dead teachings
[36:06] dead past dead and sin dead and iniquity
[36:10] o praise god and his voice can give them
[36:13] life
[36:14] praise god bring them back to themselves
[36:17] call them from the dust to the earth of
[36:20] human
[36:21] life and of the human race back to his
[36:24] word that they may know him in the power
[36:27] of his resurrection amen as we have said
[36:31] before
[36:33] the only way that a man
[36:37] can reproduce himself is through his
[36:41] wife
[36:43] because god met adam and eve
[36:47] god did not make adam and steve
[36:50] but he made adam and eve
[36:53] so here we are friends that a man
[36:57] only reproduce himself
[37:01] through his wife he only brings forth
[37:04] something that looks like him true
[37:07] his wife and so
[37:10] jesus is descending and he is descending
[37:14] to get
[37:14] some children where he's got to go he
[37:17] has to come to the church first
[37:19] he's got to reveal himself to the church
[37:22] praise
[37:22] god hallelujah amen
[37:26] comes to his wife for his true her
[37:29] that he will be able to bring
[37:32] his word to pass in this day
[37:36] and in this time and to bring forth his
[37:39] children amen he utters his voice
[37:44] while he is descending how does he utter
[37:48] his voice
[37:50] revelation 10 1
[37:53] the mighty angel the covenant angel
[37:56] the bible said with a rainbow around his
[38:00] head
[38:00] here he comes descending from heaven
[38:04] glory to god the bible says and when he
[38:06] uttered his voice
[38:08] seven sunders roared and seven sanders
[38:12] unto their voices and shook the earth
[38:15] when the angel shouted out praise god
[38:18] who was that it was jesus christ the
[38:21] great covenant angel
[38:24] sputtering his the voice of his word
[38:27] voice of the resurrection this mighty
[38:30] god in christ
[38:31] letting his word go forth and when he
[38:34] comes
[38:35] the bible tells us if you will read
[38:38] revelation chapter 10 amen
[38:41] it tells you that the mighty angel
[38:45] of that chapter 10 spoken of
[38:49] in verse 1 how when he uttered his voice
[38:54] seven senators uttered their voices
[38:58] and revelation 10 the mighty angel
[39:02] went to the earthly angel
[39:05] of revelation 10 7.
[39:10] and the voice that he uttered the seven
[39:14] sunders that he uttered
[39:17] went like it did god came spoke to adam
[39:21] adam speaks the word to eve here he
[39:23] comes
[39:24] he speaks the word it comes to the
[39:27] prophet of this
[39:28] hour the messenger the angel of the age
[39:32] and then that angel now takes the word
[39:35] and presents it to the church of the
[39:38] living god
[39:38] the opening of the word of god
[39:42] amen for the seven thunders

[1:01:31] with all kinds of other things but let
[1:01:34] me tell you
[1:01:35] if you come to him with a sweet
[1:01:38] surrendered consecrated
[1:01:40] life that the lord god has taken over
[1:01:43] your life
[1:01:44] and he fills you and uses you for his
[1:01:47] glory
[1:01:48] then you become a voice of god in these
[1:01:51] last days
[1:01:52] a living person a living voice
[1:01:55] but a voice comes in you and speaks in
[1:01:58] you
[1:01:58] that's why in that day jesus said in
[1:02:01] that hour
[1:02:02] think not of what you will say for the
[1:02:05] father in you
[1:02:06] will speak through you amen is not i
[1:02:10] that do the works
[1:02:11] but the father that liveth in me he

[1:02:23] is when he looks at you and all he can
[1:02:25] see is a sanctified life

[1:02:31] holy surrendered consecrated to
[1:02:34] god amen see anything to him
[1:02:38] say anything to a man or a woman like
[1:02:40] that call him any name
[1:02:42] and they don't rile up and get mad and
[1:02:45] forget that they're a christian
[1:02:47] and before you know it they're all
[1:02:49] cursed words and swear words
[1:02:50] come out of their mouth and call the
[1:02:52] other person all kinds of names
[1:02:54] no sir it's not like that when those
[1:02:58] things happen
[1:02:59] the real christian is even more humble
[1:03:02] and simple and walk in the light of the
[1:03:05] word
[1:03:06] of the living god their sweet and they
[1:03:09] move right on
[1:03:10] and that throws the devil away from them
[1:03:13] that is the thunder that shakes the
[1:03:16] devil
[1:03:17] and breaketh the cedars the proud cedars
[1:03:20] and the proud trees of the wilderness
[1:03:23] and of the woods

[1:03:35] ever be a great
[1:03:37] influential speaker amen you know what
[1:03:41] the devil will just laugh at you

[1:03:49] that kind of thing
[1:03:51] oh this one went to bible school that
[1:03:53] went to seminary
[1:03:55] that went and studied theology this one
[1:03:57] got a phd
[1:03:58] this one introduces himself i had a
[1:04:01] when i was just a boy i knew a minister
[1:04:04] like that

[1:04:20] and so on and so on and so on oh if he
[1:04:22] was not introduced like that he was mad
[1:04:24] and brother's sister this is the
[1:04:27] emphasis
[1:04:28] today rather than the life of christ
[1:04:31] shining out and moving in the people in
[1:04:34] his
[1:04:34] power and in his glory amen amen
[1:04:38] the devil don't pay attention to man's
[1:04:40] theology
[1:04:42] in your life amen he doesn't pay
[1:04:44] attention
[1:04:45] to your seminary training because he
[1:04:47] knows he's got you
[1:04:49] he's got you he trained you in his
[1:04:51] cemeteries
[1:04:52] of how to act and the devil just set
[1:04:55] back
[1:04:55] and just laugh at you but when he sees
[1:04:58] that life of christ in you that this is
[1:05:02] a
[1:05:02] different form of christianity

[1:05:25] what i am preaching to you what the word
[1:05:29] is revealing to you
[1:05:31] that you must surrender let christ come
[1:05:34] and live
[1:05:35] in you and then let him
[1:05:38] live his own life through you
[1:05:42] that is the life of christ that is not
[1:05:45] me trying to live it
[1:05:47] but him living his own life and when the
[1:05:50] devil sees
[1:05:51] that that is the real christ living
[1:05:54] through you
[1:05:55] that is the thunder that shakes the
[1:05:58] devil
