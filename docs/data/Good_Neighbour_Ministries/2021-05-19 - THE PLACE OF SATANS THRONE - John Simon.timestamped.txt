[0:41] look into the word of god

[1:18] showers of blessings by the
[1:21] opening of the word or
[1:25] the breaking of the bread of life
[1:28] i'd like to read out of revelation
[1:31] chapter 2
[1:32] reading verse 13. i

[1:40] dwellest even where satan's
[1:44] seat is and thou
[1:47] hold as fast my name
[1:51] and has not denied
[1:54] my faith even in
[1:57] those days wherein
[2:00] antipas was my faithful martyr
[2:04] who was slain among you where
[2:08] satan dwelleth amen
[2:12] gracious heavenly father with
[2:16] thankful hearts for the word of
[2:19] god coming upon our lives
[2:23] giving us divine moisture
[2:26] so that the life in us can
[2:29] spring up lord and blossom and
[2:33] bloom lord to become
[2:36] whatever you want us to be that we might
[2:40] walk and live in the perfect stature
[2:44] of the perfect man jesus christ
[2:49] bless us all together father for we ask
[2:52] it
[2:53] in jesus name
[2:56] last week we talked
[2:59] about nimrod and how
[3:03] that nimrod founded his
[3:06] religion and the religion
[3:09] was around worship of himself
[3:13] and worship of his wife
[3:17] uh es astarte uh later on
[3:21] uh that of course has evolved to our
[3:25] present time and our modern day
[3:29] we also brought to your attention
[3:33] that the bay bell
[3:36] instigated by nimrod
[3:39] babylon founded by his father
[3:43] but later developed into a great city
[3:48] by nimrod and his
[3:52] wisdom and his organizational
[3:56] abilities he was able to create
[4:00] this marvelous city of
[4:03] babylon now we have been showing
[4:07] how that that very
[4:11] uh thought of nimrod
[4:14] and religion of nimrod how he
[4:17] penetrated the roman empire
[4:21] and how the roman empire
[4:26] true uh constantine
[4:30] thinking that he was doing good and
[4:33] trying to unite
[4:35] the church of god the
[4:38] good seed and the bad
[4:42] the pagan priesthood
[4:45] the pagan babylonian priesthood
[4:49] that had come to the borders of rome
[4:54] under their king atulus
[4:57] and there they were practicing
[5:00] their pagan religion under
[5:03] their priest king atulus
[5:07] now at that time
[5:11] when constantine tried to create
[5:14] a unity or a church
[5:18] union today we call it the world
[5:21] council oh amen so here it was
[5:25] that he tried to do that way back then
[5:30] and then when one side
[5:36] won the debate because
[5:39] of government power favor influence
[5:43] they forced or pushed their
[5:47] ideas upon the true church of god
[5:51] which was pushed out in every possible
[5:54] way
[5:56] and the roman empire the
[5:59] as a military power
[6:02] at that time began to transform
[6:06] itself into a religious
[6:10] power under the influence
[6:14] of these babylonian priesthood
[6:19] that had penetrated
[6:22] christianity usurp
[6:26] the names and titles
[6:30] of christianity the labels
[6:33] and placed it on themselves and their
[6:36] false gods
[6:39] calling them by christian names knowing
[6:42] full well
[6:43] they might have been venus astarte
[6:45] jupiter
[6:46] job juno whatever but the
[6:50] names were changed
[6:54] and christian names were placed on them
[6:58] astarte of course changed
[7:01] everything changed but a nice christian
[7:04] name was placed on it
[7:06] and now it has become acceptable
[7:10] paganism posing
[7:14] as christianity
[7:17] and the roman empire which was once a
[7:20] military force transformed itself
[7:25] into a religious force or religious
[7:28] power
[7:29] one of religious influence and control
[7:33] hence the bible god
[7:36] in his divine wisdom describes it
[7:40] as mystery babylon
[7:44] an evil system of
[7:47] paganism politics
[7:50] and religion all mixed into one
[7:54] displaying itself as a tree-headed
[7:58] hydra a hydra-headed monster
[8:04] now we asked you to read
[8:08] out of daniel chapter 2 verses 31
[8:12] to 45 in which we
[8:17] received from daniel
[8:20] his interp interrupt god's
[8:22] interpretation
[8:24] through daniel of the king's dream
[8:28] and danielle speaks the whole king
[8:31] source and behold
[8:33] a great image danielle saw a great image
[8:37] and the image's head was made of
[8:41] fine or pure gold
[8:44] the breast
[8:48] and arms were made
[8:52] of silver pure silver
[8:57] the belly and the ties
[9:01] were made of brass
[9:05] the legs and feet
[9:09] were made of iron
[9:13] the legs were made of iron
[9:16] but then the feet was
[9:19] made of iron and clay
[9:25] now daniel's further said and i saw
[9:28] stone as
[9:29] it were cut out from the mountain
[9:34] the size of a man's hand oh
[9:38] praise god oh and that stone
[9:42] came and struck the image
[9:45] and the image was shattered
[9:48] and broken down into pieces
[9:52] and as he says and became like the shaft
[9:56] of the summer threshing folk floor
[10:00] and the wind carried them away
[10:03] that no place was found for them
[10:08] and the stone that smoked the image
[10:12] became a mountain and filled the entire
[10:16] earth
[10:17] this is the dream and we will tell the
[10:20] interpretation
[10:21] thereof before the king
[10:25] and then he started to interpret you
[10:27] thou o
[10:28] king art the head of gold that is
[10:31] the king of babylon was the head
[10:34] of gold and he went on
[10:38] to interpret that and
[10:41] show how these things would be
[10:44] displayed of course that was the king's
[10:48] dream
[10:50] but of course the king's dream
[10:53] as danielle brought god's interpretation
[10:58] by the holy spirit of that dream
[11:02] was really a revelation
[11:06] of future history future history
[11:10] from the time uh that daniel
[11:14] spoke those words until the time that
[11:18] jesus
[11:20] comes again not in the rapture
[11:23] for his church but at the ending
[11:27] of time when he comes again to
[11:30] rule and reign after the tribulation
[11:34] period
[11:35] is over he comes to rule and reign
[11:39] as the son of david
[11:42] the son of david which is to say his the
[11:45] physical
[11:46] being of jesus came
[11:49] out from the seed of david so he comes
[11:53] now
[11:54] back as the seed
[11:57] of our son of david now
[12:00] that same period of time
[12:04] from danielle to when
[12:07] christ returns is called
[12:11] the times of the gentiles
[12:14] it's known as the times of the gentiles
[12:19] well he also made plain to us so we can
[12:23] understand that history
[12:27] would be unfolding
[12:30] in four parts at that particular time
[12:35] and during the first part
[12:38] during these parts it will be controlled
[12:41] and influenced
[12:43] by four powers
[12:46] one the the head of gold
[12:50] the babylonian empire
[12:53] would rule the world and have
[12:56] influence and power the media
[13:00] persian empire
[13:03] would be the next and then
[13:07] comes the grecian
[13:10] empire followed by
[13:13] the roman empire of course
[13:17] the babylonian empire was the greatest
[13:22] naturally speaking it was the greatest
[13:26] and the most powerful and the wisest
[13:30] the wisdom of nimrod worldly wisdom
[13:33] earthly wisdom
[13:35] it was the wisest at that particular
[13:38] time
[13:40] then followed by those medial
[13:43] persians which history bears out
[13:47] that they were a little less than the
[13:50] babylonian empire
[13:52] but still very powerful
[13:56] in the events world events
[14:00] they were followed by the greeks and the
[14:03] greeks
[14:04] were are brilliant leaders with military
[14:07] minds
[14:09] able to uh go out into
[14:12] great military wars
[14:15] of that time and finally came
[14:19] the roman empire typified
[14:23] or tight by the
[14:26] legs and the feet
[14:31] now while all the other kingdoms
[14:35] were shown by god to be pure
[14:39] metals pure materials
[14:42] like gold and silver and brass
[14:46] we find that this roman empire
[14:50] starts out as iron
[14:53] but it ends in defeat
[14:56] as a mixed material
[15:00] of iron and clay
[15:03] so it's a hybrid mixed with iron
[15:07] and clay now think of it my friends
[15:14] we know that soil and
[15:17] iron doesn't really mix they don't mix
[15:21] just simply doesn't work because it will
[15:25] have no
[15:27] consistency and or strength
[15:30] if you try to mix soil
[15:34] along with iron but the most
[15:37] amazing thing is that this
[15:40] roman empire
[15:44] would endure in that mixed hybrid state
[15:49] until jesus comes again
[15:55] now let us study this roman empire
[16:00] it's necessary for us to
[16:03] uh study and understand
[16:08] history some history
[16:11] that is in line with scripture so we can
[16:14] understand
[16:15] the scripture better but here it is
[16:19] this roman empire of iron of course
[16:22] iron signifies power and great
[16:25] destructive force against uh
[16:28] anything it comes against it would be
[16:31] with destructive
[16:32] uh force right now the roman empire
[16:37] was uh
[16:40] divided into two parts
[16:44] like two legs uh
[16:47] of of the of this great image
[16:50] two legs so here are two parts
[16:54] even to this day east
[16:57] and west the eastern part and the
[17:00] western
[17:02] part there it was and iron
[17:06] clay east and west
[17:10] two divisions two feet
[17:13] there they were both powerful
[17:18] and crushing power between the two of
[17:21] them
[17:23] but like all the other empires before it
[17:26] fell they all vanished away
[17:29] in the dustbin of history
[17:32] and the roman empire also
[17:35] fell we've seen there are many books
[17:39] written on that fall of the roman empire
[17:42] but here it is rome fell
[17:47] and thus pagan
[17:51] rome imperial pagan rome
[17:56] was no longer the iron
[18:00] that it was with its with its divisions
[18:04] and legions
[18:05] marching conquering everywhere the
[18:08] iron fist of rome the iron fist
[18:12] on our iron feet i should say off-road
[18:16] for there were great
[18:17] marchers great legionnaires great
[18:20] soldiers
[18:21] fighting formations and everything else
[18:24] yes disciplined and even so they
[18:28] would have that in their in their
[18:30] particular uh
[18:31] church or temple they would have
[18:33] disciplines
[18:34] strong forceful disciplined just as if
[18:37] they're in an army
[18:39] it's another kind of army it's now a
[18:42] religious army
[18:43] but however she crumbled
[18:47] and the roman empire fell
[18:51] it was wounded to death as the book of
[18:55] revelation
[18:56] tells us the beast was wounded
[19:00] unto death but when the world
[19:03] sought that the roman empire was over
[19:07] and it was done it was finished
[19:11] it really was not dead it was only
[19:15] wounded
[19:18] here it is worst
[19:21] uh translation of revelation
[19:24] 13 verse 3
[19:27] and one of his heads
[19:31] appeared to have been mortally
[19:34] wounded the truth
[19:38] having been slashed
[19:41] and his head his death stroke
[19:45] was healed and the whole
[19:48] earth followed after the wild beast
[19:54] in amazement now people look at rome
[20:00] they look at the nation of italy
[20:04] and they don't realize that it's two
[20:07] different things
[20:11] for rome itself is a nation
[20:15] within the nation of italy
[20:19] the city of rome is ruled
[20:23] over by the pope
[20:27] who is bought emperor
[20:32] and priest we will understand
[20:35] later uh a little more of this
[20:40] but his dominion is actually there
[20:44] and i have stood there and watch
[20:48] ambassadors coming with flags of various
[20:52] nations
[20:53] of watch apostolic delegates going and
[20:56] coming
[20:57] doing diplomatic uh charges
[21:01] and works of which they have to do
[21:04] about stamps that are vatican stamps
[21:08] bought in their post office because
[21:11] it is a legitimate
[21:14] nation among the nations
[21:17] that is why many do not understand
[21:20] there's a difference between the
[21:24] catholic church and all the other
[21:26] churches
[21:28] because all the other churches are just
[21:31] churches
[21:33] but the catholic church it's a
[21:36] nation that has extended itself by
[21:40] religion
[21:43] into every other nation on the face of
[21:46] the earth
[21:48] and the churches
[21:51] so-called and cathedrals are like
[21:56] semi-embassies that is a reason why
[22:00] in the in that church
[22:03] one can flee and have sanctuary
[22:08] if they're a catholic uh just as much as
[22:12] if you're an american you can flee for
[22:14] sanctuary
[22:16] into an american embassy
[22:19] if you are french you can flee
[22:22] into a french embassy and so
[22:26] if you're under a pressure or
[22:29] or the law or or anything of that nature
[22:33] one can flee into that
[22:37] catholic church and receive
[22:40] sanctuary and protection there
[22:44] because it's literally an extension
[22:47] of the nation of rome ruled
[22:51] by the pope of rome who is bought king
[22:56] and priest not just a priest
[23:00] not just a preacher but king emperor
[23:04] and priest now
[23:08] of course they have their own
[23:09] ambassadors and receiving ambassadors
[23:14] and now this papal
[23:17] false christian
[23:20] rome even calls herself
[23:25] the eternal city that of course is
[23:28] blasphemy
[23:29] for the only eternal city is the
[23:32] jerusalem of
[23:34] god above there is none other
[23:37] they may say oh it's just a figure of
[23:40] speech
[23:41] to say it will endure but the bible says
[23:44] different
[23:45] the bible says in one hour the whole
[23:47] thing will be
[23:48] burned and destroyed by the judgments
[23:51] and powers of almighty god
[23:54] amen now here it is my friends
[23:59] we know that this now
[24:02] controls instead of controlling
[24:06] by military power as
[24:10] rome did in the past
[24:13] remember i said rome the roman empire
[24:18] has morphed or has transformed
[24:22] itself from a religion
[24:26] a military imperial political power
[24:32] into a religious power
[24:36] now controlling
[24:39] not so much by military power
[24:45] it still uses the military power and the
[24:48] laws
[24:49] law enforcement of every nation on the
[24:52] earth
[24:54] but in actual fact it now
[24:58] controls by the religion
[25:03] it controls by that form
[25:07] of christianity they called
[25:10] christianity their brand of it
[25:15] which is contrary to the word of god
[25:20] now we see then why god in his infinite
[25:24] wisdom
[25:26] called it mystery babylon
[25:30] a place of chaos
[25:34] confusion are
[25:37] all manner of mixed up languages
[25:41] towns knowledges coming out of it
[25:45] to confuse the minds and the hearts of
[25:49] men
[25:50] from one god to tree
[25:54] from believing in one god
[25:57] to their to believing into the pagan
[26:01] faith of three gods
[26:05] in one and so they can now control
[26:11] even more and are more powerful
[26:16] than imperial rome was
[26:19] because they control even more people
[26:24] and their control is not only over the
[26:27] physical bodies of the people within
[26:31] their empire but this form
[26:35] of this mystery babylon
[26:39] now controls by the
[26:43] narcotic of
[26:46] false religious belief
[26:50] using the very word of god for their
[26:53] purposes
[26:56] so they're doing a greater job
[27:01] now from the millions imperial rome
[27:05] controlled now they are they control
[27:08] billions
[27:09] of people who have received
[27:13] that kind of a false faith
[27:17] not knowing its origin
[27:20] and its background of course
[27:25] imperial rome received a new
[27:29] or was revived from its wounds
[27:33] by the emperor constantine
[27:36] and his dream and his good
[27:40] thoughts of trying to unite
[27:43] the empire
[27:47] and how he backed the uniting and the
[27:50] mingling
[27:51] of the two seeds
[27:54] at nicaea rome 325
[27:58] a.d that spirit
[28:02] that motivated him is still loose in the
[28:05] world today
[28:07] still anointing the roman empire
[28:13] spiritually and causing it to
[28:16] push like constantine did back
[28:20] there for the uniting of all the
[28:23] churches
[28:25] it pushes the same way he did
[28:29] to unite the churches today by acumenism
[28:34] by the world council of churches
[28:37] bringing them together using the word of
[28:40] god
[28:41] how that jesus said we should be one
[28:45] not having any revelation not having
[28:48] the spirit of god making it known clear
[28:51] what that is about
[28:56] but we know friends i repeat
[29:00] the former roman imperial
[29:03] power military power
[29:07] never really went out of existence
[29:13] on the surface it appeared that
[29:17] rome had fallen and disappeared
[29:21] into the dust bin of history
[29:26] but in actual fact under constantine
[29:30] i repeat 3 25 80
[29:34] it rose from the dead
[29:38] it came out of its seminary its
[29:41] cemetery and rose up
[29:46] once again all it did
[29:50] was change its outer appearance
[29:54] an outer texture from an attacking
[29:58] uh force to one that appears
[30:02] meek and mild like a cat
[30:06] until it is disturbed and then the claws
[30:10] came comes out then the spitting
[30:13] then the cruelty then the opposition
[30:16] comes out
[30:17] out of it changing itself from military
[30:21] to religious
[30:24] now once the power
[30:28] had shifted at the isa
[30:31] council
[30:35] and they had received power
[30:39] from present time
[30:43] after that most of the believers
[30:46] who were jews at the time were expelled
[30:50] out of the city of rome they filled the
[30:53] gap
[30:53] moved into power and influence
[30:58] and it seemed as if they would go to no
[31:00] limits
[31:01] the witch they will go
[31:05] in persecuting the true saints
[31:08] of the living god and now
[31:12] they put on the cloak of the name
[31:16] of christianity the very
[31:19] name which at first was
[31:23] persecuted cursed swear
[31:26] uh the word christian back then
[31:29] it's not like today people are proud oh
[31:32] i'm a christian i'm a christian
[31:34] back then nobody wanted to be known as a
[31:37] christian
[31:38] because to say you're a christian was to
[31:41] court your own death
[31:43] and the persecution and the torture
[31:47] of your family so they they hid from the
[31:51] name they didn't want the name
[31:53] but once they had power
[31:57] now they adopted the name
[32:00] and under the cover of that name
[32:04] they began to perpetrate
[32:09] their religious crimes of history
[32:12] the inquisition and so on
[32:17] now friends it was in this stage
[32:24] 354 a.d
[32:27] to 4 30 a.d
[32:31] you may have heard the name of the
[32:35] bishop
[32:35] augustine augustine of hippo
[32:41] and he was the one
[32:44] or architect the one who propounded
[32:48] the idea and the thought
[32:52] that the church ought to and that the
[32:55] church
[32:56] must use force let me repeat
[33:00] saint augustine
[33:04] was the one who proposed
[33:07] propounded and preached the fact
[33:11] that the church otto was supposed to
[33:16] and must use force
[33:19] in order to bring
[33:22] all her children back into the fold
[33:26] by force and violence
[33:30] he said it was in the heart in harmony
[33:33] with the word of god
[33:35] to kill heretics and to
[33:38] kill apostates and those that
[33:42] differed with them oh
[33:45] my think of it yet he is revered
[33:50] in history he's looked up to everywhere
[33:54] to those who do not know the truth
[33:58] that he propounded this thought
[34:01] listen i can't give you the entire quote
[34:05] but you may read this
[34:08] in augustine's controversy
[34:11] with the donatists amen
[34:15] you can read it over there and you'll
[34:17] find
[34:18] that he was one who pushed for this
[34:21] while these
[34:22] donatis d-o-n-a-t-i-s-t-s
[34:28] were pushing that for the opposite
[34:32] to leave the christians alone
[34:35] but here in his talks
[34:38] against them is argumentations
[34:42] against them he said
[34:45] that should be compelled
[34:49] by fear or compel them by
[34:52] pain so that they
[34:56] may afterwards be influenced
[35:00] by teaching so that they might
[35:03] follow out and act what they have
[35:06] learned
[35:07] from the word of god
[35:10] he even went as far as
[35:13] using paul the apostle paul
[35:17] as an example of what he really
[35:21] meant he said
[35:24] that paul was at first only constrained
[35:29] are called by god's voice
[35:33] but then
[35:36] paul was dashed on the ground by force
[35:42] and by power he was thrown to the earth
[35:49] and then he was struck by
[35:53] blindness by power and
[35:57] by force wherefore
[36:02] i'm quoting him now why therefore
[36:06] then should not the church
[36:09] use force in compelling
[36:13] her lost sons and daughters to return
[36:17] the lord himself said go out into the
[36:20] highways and byways and hedges
[36:24] and compel them to come
[36:27] in therefore the power that the church
[36:31] has received
[36:32] by divine appointment in its new season
[36:37] is true religious character
[36:41] and true the faith of kings
[36:45] in other words the compulsion they can
[36:47] exercise is through using governments
[36:50] kings amen to be the
[36:54] instrument by which those who are
[36:57] found in the highways and the bibles
[37:03] are compelled to come in then
[37:06] let them not find fault
[37:10] with being compelled by us by
[37:13] by them by the church they should not
[37:16] feel
[37:16] bad about being compelled
[37:19] well we can see
[37:24] this evil monster
[37:29] its lips red
[37:32] tripping with the blood
[37:36] blood thirsty for the blood of the
[37:40] saints
[37:41] dripping with blood as we can see
[37:44] my friends the false vine
[37:48] in spain played upon
[37:51] the emperor maximus
[37:55] to join into the attack upon true
[37:58] believers
[37:59] who had the word of god the power of the
[38:02] holy spirit
[38:04] and signs of the supernatural
[38:07] working and moving amongst them
[38:11] now these same personalness
[38:14] were brought to shreves
[38:21] 385 a.d he accused
[38:25] christians of witchcraft
[38:28] of immorality uh
[38:32] they did not understand like the
[38:33] communion and stuff like that so
[38:36] they thought it was cannibalism they
[38:38] thought it was witchcraft and
[38:41] everything else and many were executed
[38:44] but two bishops martin of tours
[38:48] and ambrose of milan
[38:52] they opposed absolutely protested
[38:55] and pleaded for the true believers
[38:59] they did not heed them and the
[39:03] persecutions continued
[39:06] and from this time on
[39:09] right through the dark ages of the
[39:12] church
[39:14] we will see the children of the flesh
[39:18] persecuting those of the spirit
[39:22] we will see clearly here friends
[39:25] the false vine persecuting
[39:29] the true vine the seed of cain
[39:34] the children of nimrod persecuting
[39:39] the children of the word jesus
[39:42] christ the living word persecuting
[39:46] children of the living word
[39:49] both claiming
[39:52] god be to be their father just like cain
[39:56] and abel
[39:57] claim eve to be their mother
[40:01] and adam to be their father but we
[40:04] know from scripture that cain was the
[40:08] son of the devil
[40:09] it is said in first john cain who
[40:12] was of that wicked one
[40:16] right and that's not just a a reference
[40:19] he
[40:20] was the son of satan a son
[40:23] of the serpent who was not a snake
[40:27] but walked upright like a man reasoned
[40:30] like a man
[40:31] intelligent like a man but had no
[40:34] soul and therefore satan used him as the
[40:38] instrument
[40:39] to intermingle himself with the entire
[40:42] human race
[40:44] so here we have the seed of the serpent
[40:49] and the seed of god
[40:52] and the seed god promised from that time
[40:56] the seed of the woman will bruise
[41:00] the serpent's head will bruise the
[41:02] serpent's seed
[41:04] by the power of the holy spirit
[41:07] and the word of god just as it was
[41:12] ishmaelian isaac what could claim
[41:15] abraham to be their father
[41:18] but one of god and one of the devil
[41:23] so on see the parallels
[41:26] throughout the word of god from genesis
[41:30] right into the book of revelation
[41:34] you may see him right there in the word
[41:37] of god
[41:38] the darkness of spiritual corruption
[41:43] began to deepen
[41:46] and the true light of god the word that
[41:49] was given
[41:50] the fate once delivered to paul
[41:54] of peter and all the original saints
[41:58] began to fade as the
[42:01] babylonians mystery teachings
[42:05] and religion mingled and
[42:08] mixed in with the word of god
[42:11] began to take precedence their
[42:14] trinitarian doctrines
[42:16] of many gods saints and so on began to
[42:20] take
[42:20] precedence it pushed out
[42:25] the truth of god's word
[42:29] hero israel the lord thy
[42:32] god is one lord there is only
[42:35] one god and that jehovah
[42:39] of the old testament is jesus
[42:43] of the new for of course jesus means
[42:46] jehovah
[42:47] is our savior oh blessed be his
[42:51] holy and precious name
[42:54] and so friends the true light
[42:57] of god began to fade out
[43:01] under the pressure the enchants
[43:03] persecution
[43:05] and inquisitions during that time
[43:08] until it was just glowing faintly
[43:12] yet thank god the promise of god still
[43:16] holds true
[43:17] the light shaded in the darkness
[43:20] and the darkness can do nothing about it
[43:24] and in the prophet zechariah saying that
[43:27] even though
[43:28] the darkness would try to push out the
[43:31] light
[43:32] the prophet prophesied but it
[43:35] shall be light about the evening time
[43:39] oh praise god just about coming to the
[43:43] end of the age time for jesus to return
[43:47] he made a promise that the light
[43:50] would be restored back
[43:54] into the church of god and i believe
[43:56] that's what we have been receiving
[43:59] that is causing the holy ghost to react
[44:02] to his people and through his people
[44:04] and with his people for his glory
[44:08] this is also the fulfillment of malachi
[44:12] 4 5 god saying i
[44:16] will restore or praise god
[44:19] the faith of the children back to the
[44:22] fathers
[44:23] is speaking of us restoring the faith of
[44:27] the children
[44:28] back to the apostolic fathers
[44:31] to receive the fullness of the word
[44:35] as they had it and give praise glory
[44:38] and honor to our god we're on the move
[44:41] we're on the charge
[44:43] our god is working and moving by his
[44:45] spirit
[44:46] to fulfill his word in this our day
[44:50] and this our time oh my friends
[44:53] here it is my friends let us remember
[44:56] and recap
[44:58] how nimrod came
[45:02] and asked the people to unite to build
[45:06] bay bell
[45:08] and so god came down
[45:11] and destroyed it and split up the towns
[45:17] and nations were scattered abroad
[45:21] in the face of the earth
[45:24] and he in rebellion to god
[45:28] formed his own religion and his own army
[45:32] as we talked he was the first to form an
[45:34] army
[45:36] teach discipline teach order
[45:39] systems of government he
[45:42] was the first to do that and my friends
[45:45] here it was
[45:47] he entrenched his babylonian
[45:50] religion with himself at the head
[45:54] his wife next to him astarte
[45:58] of course venus is the same name
[46:01] in the greek language and you'll find
[46:04] the same name
[46:06] but in other languages it's called
[46:08] differently today
[46:09] you may want to use a religious term on
[46:12] that
[46:13] no but here it was my friends
[46:18] that he formed his own religion
[46:21] pagan religion and we taught you you
[46:24] taught your true history how that
[46:27] religion
[46:28] morphed mingled and
[46:31] mixed itself into
[46:34] genuine pure christianity and saw
[46:38] spiritual pollution so polluted it
[46:43] until genuine real one
[46:46] god one christ christianity
[46:50] was pushed out
[46:54] out of the picture and the true
[46:57] is looked upon as if it's false
[47:00] and the false being in power and in
[47:03] denomination and influence
[47:06] is now looked upon as if it is the
[47:10] true church now
[47:13] my friends we find out
[47:18] how the king i told us
[47:23] a follower of nimrod's religion
[47:28] fled to the outskirts of rome
[47:32] and set up his kingdom and it flourished
[47:36] because of course the god of this world
[47:41] helped him to cause it to flourish
[47:45] there was a great succession of
[47:48] priests kings under atolus
[47:52] until the reign of atulus
[47:56] iii and for some
[47:59] unknown reason but when he was dying
[48:05] he willed his entire kingdom
[48:09] an authority over
[48:12] to the kingdom of rome at that time
[48:16] ruled by julius caesar
[48:21] it is at this point that historic
[48:26] potpourri began or the historic origins
[48:31] of potpourri began
[48:35] so then caesar took
[48:38] bought the military physical kingdom he
[48:42] was ruling
[48:43] and married it to the idols
[48:47] of attolos the pagan
[48:51] priest rome was already pagan but
[48:54] military in its structure but now
[48:57] it becomes completely married
[49:00] it's as it were ephraim married to his
[49:03] idols
[49:05] to this babylonious religion
[49:09] and took it and thus
[49:12] he became what military
[49:16] physical head and the spiritual head
[49:22] becoming a priest king
[49:26] an emperor and yet the priest
[49:30] from this we have the term pontifex
[49:35] maximus remember pontifex
[49:38] maximus a priest king
[49:42] supreme power of that
[49:45] empire of being bought emperor
[49:49] and priest of course that following that
[49:54] that title was passed on down
[49:57] from emperor to emperor right on
[50:01] until the time of maximus the third
[50:04] emperor maximus iii and he
[50:07] refused it he didn't want it
[50:11] and according to the history
[50:14] of stephen's or stephen's history
[50:18] my friends today there is still a
[50:21] pontiff
[50:23] in the world and he is truly
[50:27] the pontiff maximus
[50:31] for he still wears the triple crown
[50:37] and my friends
[50:40] he still resides in rome
[50:44] in revelation 17 god does not
[50:49] no longer refer to portuguese
[50:52] as he read in revelation 2
[50:55] 13 as the seat where satan
[51:00] dwelleth god does not
[51:03] refer anymore
[51:07] to it just my friends
[51:11] as babylon and saying satan's seat is in
[51:15] babylon
[51:16] but now god began begins to
[51:20] call it and identify that spirit
[51:25] as mystery babylon for now it's gone
[51:29] into a spiritual atmosphere
[51:31] and therefore now becomes mystery
[51:35] babylon
[51:36] so when we speak of mr babylon you must
[51:38] understand
[51:40] we're speaking of how uh nimrod through
[51:43] the ages through the caesars
[51:44] right on down has brought organization
[51:48] military precision mixed into religion
[51:52] discipline right and all
[51:55] that the very discipline of and brought
[51:58] order or orders
[52:02] into religion
[52:06] complete obedience
[52:10] total and complete he
[52:13] enforces it and so we have mystery
[52:17] babylon with us and mr babylon
[52:21] in a city with seven hills
[52:25] on seven hills and the head of it
[52:31] the king priest
[52:34] who has usurped the position of
[52:37] jesus christ calling himself
[52:41] vicarius philia i die
[52:45] we will speak on that at another time
[52:49] or praise god saying or thinking he
[52:52] alone is the mediator
[52:54] when our bible tells us there is one
[52:57] mediator
[52:58] between god and man and it
[53:01] he is jesus christ amen
[53:05] makes the claim he alone can forgive
[53:09] sins on the earth contrary
[53:12] to the word of god when we know
[53:16] that jesus christ is the only one who
[53:20] died for our sins the only one who has
[53:23] the power to forgive us of our sins
[53:25] and we put our faith in him but still
[53:29] while we are given real genuine
[53:32] forgiveness from jesus christ
[53:34] this pontifex maximus
[53:38] is here now upon the earth
[53:42] may god help us in this dark
[53:46] dim twilight hour
[53:49] but we rejoice in the fact
[53:52] that god can give us assurance
[53:56] telling us before the time
[53:59] that this would happen but when it
[54:02] happens
[54:03] and it begins to become dark
[54:06] it becomes troublesome he says
[54:10] at evening time when it's dark
[54:14] it shall be light it shall be light
[54:17] again
[54:18] he'll restore the word he'll bring us
[54:22] back to the original fate of our fathers
[54:25] the faith once delivered to the saint
[54:28] may god bless you all may god bless
[54:32] us all as we revel
[54:35] as we take the word of god with
[54:38] rejoicing
[54:40] hearts and believing the word and
[54:42] promise for this day
[54:44] may you be straightened may you be
[54:46] enlightened
[54:47] may your eyes may your heart be opened
[54:51] and may god build your rock
[54:54] foundations upon the revelation of his
[54:57] word
[54:58] which will stand forever god bless you
[55:01] my friends
[55:02] we'll come together again on sunday
[55:05] in the presence of the lord as we once
[55:08] more
[55:09] feed and feast upon god's word
[55:13] for today god bless you
[55:20] [Music]
[55:51] you
