[42:25] this we ask in your precious name amen
[42:29] and amen and
[42:32] reading Hebrews
[42:35] 11:25 I believe it
[42:41] is
[42:43] 11:25 amen choosing rather to suffer
[42:50] Affliction speaking about
[42:52] Moses amen so he made a choice he's he
[42:57] made a choice to suffer with the
[43:00] Affliction with the people of
[43:03] God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin
[43:08] for a season you all may be seated
[43:12] praise
[43:14] God
[43:16] hallelujah sinner
[43:19] pleasure sin is
[43:21] attractive amen sins look good to the
[43:25] the five senses
[43:28] hallelujah amen so I just want to recap
[43:31] a little bit on the lesson that we had a
[43:34] few weeks ago
[43:36] amen from Genesis all right we saw where
[43:41] God made Man In His Image and his
[43:44] likeness
[43:46] amen and God created him male and female
[43:51] he created them
[43:55] Hallelujah
[43:58] you say man was first created as a
[44:01] spirit being not yet as a physical being
[44:07] until expressed in a human body amen
[44:11] amen hallelujah so man was a spirit
[44:14] being first and then God because Man was
[44:18] created in image of God because God is a
[44:23] spirit amen so the first creation of man
[44:28] was in a spirit form and then he formed
[44:31] man from the dust of the earth and
[44:34] breathed the breath of life into him and
[44:38] he became a living
[44:41] soul but when man was in that body he
[44:44] was both male and
[44:47] female and then we
[44:49] see where God separated the feminine
[44:53] part of him and he placed it in an
[44:56] another body amen and call her woman
[44:59] because she came out of Man Simple
[45:02] teaching amen understand amen
[45:08] hallelujah and then we went to
[45:10] Genesis chapter 2 verse 16 and the Lord
[45:15] made a commandment to man
[45:19] man now remember Eve was
[45:23] still part of him when God gave that
[45:28] commandment you got
[45:31] that when
[45:33] God gave the Commandment to Adam he was
[45:36] both male and female so Eve was already
[45:39] was there in him
[45:43] hallelujah praise
[45:46] God and the Commandment was of every
[45:49] tree of the garden thou mayest freely
[45:53] eat so here there a choice he gave them
[45:58] Choice amen but of the three of the
[46:02] knowledge of Good and Evil thou shall
[46:06] not eat of it for in the day that thou
[46:09] eatest thou shall surely
[46:14] die amen so when God makes a a a a law
[46:19] there's a penalty when you break the
[46:21] law and if there isn't a penalty to AOW
[46:25] it there isn't it's not
[46:26] AOW amen you go speeding on the road it
[46:30] says 60 or 50 or whatever the cops stop
[46:34] you you're speeding now there's a
[46:36] penalty attached to that amen you commit
[46:40] a crime you pay the fine or you do the
[46:44] time right
[46:49] Glory you just don't know that the Holy
[46:53] Spirit feeds on the w
[46:56] word so here was a choice
[47:00] you the Bible is in symbolic
[47:04] form right when they say a tree right a
[47:08] a tree in the garden right was actually
[47:12] a
[47:13] person amen but it's in symbol form and
[47:18] the word takes Faith or Revelation to
[47:23] understand the word of God amen without
[47:27] faith or Revelation it's
[47:31] impossible to please God you don't know
[47:34] what to believe am and only God can give
[47:37] you the clear understanding of his word
[47:40] for you to
[47:41] believe amen you Jesus I love to make
[47:44] the gospel as simple as simple as
[47:48] possible so that you can catch it
[47:52] Hallelujah to God be praised thank you
[47:55] Lord
[47:57] you
[47:58] see when you have the Holy Ghost
[48:02] man you need to be
[48:05] fed amen and God the Holy Ghost feeds on
[48:11] the revealed
[48:13] word that's where your strength lies
[48:18] amen you could just read it read it read
[48:20] it and you get nothing from it but it
[48:22] takes Revelation to give you the reason
[48:25] substance that is coming off to give you
[48:28] the strength to give you en
[48:30] encouragement the Assurance brother Mike
[48:32] was just saying you have Blessed
[48:35] Assurance we sing it all is
[48:39] well I said brother Mike like you're
[48:41] going right into the little study here
[48:44] that's the Holy
[48:45] Spirit guiding you and leading you in
[48:48] simple little ways you look for key
[48:50] little key little things that you know
[48:53] that you're are on the right
[48:57] Frack amen and God loves to do that us
[49:02] so to encourage you you know you got all
[49:05] kind of opposition all kind of
[49:07] challenges in your life I know some
[49:10] brothers sitting right here this morning

[49:21] hours and hours couldn't understand what

[49:48] to encourage you and lift you up amen
[49:51] hallelujah blessed be his holy and
[49:54] wonderful name
[49:56] you
[49:59] see you believe the spirit feeds only
[50:04] and only on the word of
[50:06] God hallelujah and the Bible said so man
[50:11] shall not live by bread alone but by
[50:16] every word that proceedeth out of the
[50:19] mouth of God hallelujah so you feed on
[50:24] God's word you you listen to the tapes
[50:27] you read your Bible amen why are so so
[50:30] many
[50:31] weak why are so many so weak man because
[50:35] they do not go to the source of their
[50:39] strength Hallelujah you read your Bible
[50:43] and you pray every day that is the A B
[50:46] Cs of being a strong Christian to
[50:51] overcome the wives of the
[50:53] enemy Hallelujah
[50:57] now we see that sin didn't start here
[51:00] just a earth amen sin began in heaven
[51:05] right Lucifer was kicked out of heaven
[51:08] and cast down to earth Satan as he is
[51:13] known now saw what God was doing by
[51:17] having a
[51:19] family and we understood that God is a
[51:22] family man amen amen hallelujah
[51:26] we all love to have family we all love
[51:29] to have Fellowship amen don't
[51:31] we man you can't be like a as we say as
[51:35] a Onan Island you go and you seclude
[51:37] yourself from everything you're going to
[51:39] be
[51:40] lonely amen hallelujah so God wants
[51:47] Fellowship that's why he created us and
[51:49] placed us here amen hallelujah and we
[51:53] going back to where we had fallen from
[51:55] amen amen hallelujah praise
[51:58] God so you see Satan saw what God was
[52:03] doing and you is a
[52:05] copycat he can't create so he takes what
[52:08] God created and Peres
[52:11] iten you see it all around man man is
[52:15] taking what God created amen and
[52:18] perverting it why all this pollution all
[52:21] this Wars Gunpowder the same vehicle
[52:24] that you're driving it's killing so many
[52:26] more amen hallelujah praise
[52:30] God you see and it's all started from
[52:34] the Garden of Eden
[52:37] Hallelujah he could not create because
[52:40] he's a creation he could not get through
[52:44] by
[52:45] establishing a kingdom in heaven so he
[52:48] seized an opportunity where he could Mar
[52:52] God's
[52:53] creation and he is doing that all the
[52:56] time he wants to destroy your life he
[52:59] come to he wants to Mar you he want to
[53:01] to to to to do all everything to kill
[53:05] you and Destroy You amen hallelujah
[53:09] that's his Statics Hallelujah blessed be
[53:13] the name of the
[53:15] Lord excuse
[53:18] me so he saw an ceased an opportunity
[53:22] where he can Mar God's plan
[53:26] man you know Satan love
[53:31] worship it started way back in heaven he
[53:33] saw how the Angels were worshiping God
[53:36] and getting god of the great God getting
[53:40] all this worship and praise and
[53:42] everything like
[53:43] that and it entered jealousy entered
[53:46] into him amen and anytime you see
[53:48] somebody jealous you know that Satan in
[53:51] them thank you Jesus they want what you
[53:54] have man
[53:56] Hallelujah the craving for what you have
[53:58] and they'll do all ends to get it and
[54:01] that's exactly what Satan was trying to
[54:03] do amen
[54:06] hallelujah he loves worship even when
[54:10] the Lord himself s was here in
[54:13] flesh he
[54:15] approached the Mighty God in flesh form
[54:19] and say if you could bow if you Bow Down

[54:43] his tactics from since then and he's
[54:45] continuing right now hallelujah praise
[54:49] God see he wanted worship and that's his
[54:52] main worship and a lot of people worship
[54:55] shiing Satan under the disguise that
[54:58] they're worshiping the true and living
[55:02] Goden the songs they sing amen and all
[55:05] this they're praising Satan and they
[55:07] don't even know it and all these
[55:09] denomination they've been so deceived
[55:13] man that they do not know that they're
[55:15] worshiping Satan Hallelujah but we know
[55:19] who we worship amen we know where we
[55:22] came from amen we know where we going to
[55:24] amen amen hallelujah we worship the only
[55:28] true and living God and his name is the
[55:30] Lord Jesus Christ
[55:34] hallelujah thank you Lord blessed be his
[55:37] wonderful name
[55:39] Hallelujah then we see s Eve Le leaving
[55:45] from under the headship of her
[55:48] husband amen and when you decide to
[55:52] leave the headship from under under the
[55:55] Holy
[55:56] Spirit or or under the revealed word at
[56:00] this hour amen you're going to end up in
[56:04] trouble you're going to surely end up in
[56:07] trouble because you want to lead your
[56:09] own self or you want somebody else to
[56:11] lead you
[56:12] Hallelujah so we see Eve left from under
[56:15] the headship of her husband and went for
[56:17] a
[56:18] stroll
[56:20] amen she went to explore amen she expose
[56:26] ourselves to the attack of
[56:29] Satan amen
[56:34] hallelujah and when you do that amen
[56:40] hallelujah Satan has a a right to attack
[56:43] you he has a right because you live from
[56:48] Under The Canopy your
[56:51] protection you see when when Satan went
[56:55] and challenge the Lord on job he said I
[56:59] can't touch that
[57:01] man you have a protection around him I
[57:05] can't penetrate that amen but if you
[57:08] only move that amen from around him then
[57:12] I going to get to him but you know some
[57:14] of us we actually leave it and we go out
[57:18] amen we go from under that protection by
[57:21] our own self and there you are exposed
[57:25] to Satan's attack on your life man H it
[57:29] was different with job because the
[57:32] challenge not wasn't between job and
[57:35] Satan and know it between God and
[57:39] Satan and God put put out a challenge to
[57:42] to to to Satan he said do everything you
[57:45] can but don't touch his life do anything
[57:48] you can don't touch his
[57:50] life and he would not curse me
[57:55] God was assured of that seed that was
[57:59] inside of job that he would not deny the
[58:02] word of God Amen could God put that
[58:05] challenge on your life today yes amen
[58:08] that you would not give up you would not
[58:10] giv you would not surrender to the lies
[58:13] that the enemy would would would present
[58:16] to you thank you
[58:19] Hallelujah so we see one day amen the
[58:23] serpent approached that
[58:25] you see he wanted a
[58:27] congregation and the first Sone that
[58:30] ever was preached was in the Garden of
[58:32] Eden so he got Eve to
[58:36] listen because if she was under the
[58:39] protection of her husband he couldn't
[58:41] touch
[58:41] her he couldn't whisper in her
[58:44] ears some Sweet N Things as some of us

[59:16] talk he could talk you into
[59:19] anything but you got to stop and
[59:22] listen and that's where it's that's
[59:24] where it's starts when you stop to
[59:27] listen to his
[59:29] lies and he is not 100% liying know he
[59:33] will take the word of
[59:36] God
[59:40] 99.99999% word and put one little doter
[59:44] lie inside of it how much poon you think
[59:47] going to kill a
