[0:25] fresh water from the wells of salvation
[0:31] may the joy of the lord be our strength
[0:34] may the lord bless us as we
[0:38] fellowship with him
[0:41] and with each other as we
[0:45] sit around stand around
[0:49] believing wherever we are in our homes
[0:52] in the street
[0:53] in our cars or in our churches wherever
[0:58] we are may the word of god speak to us
[1:02] and may we respond to him
[1:05] and say yes lord i'll say
[1:09] yes yes yes
[1:12] amen praise god now
[1:16] i shall certainly read from the word of
[1:19] god
[1:20] as i speak on change
[1:25] in the bible matthew chapter
[1:28] 27 verses
[1:32] 51 to 53
[1:37] and behold the
[1:41] veil of the temple was
[1:44] rent in twin
[1:47] from the top to the bottom
[1:52] and the earth did quake
[1:55] and the rocks rant
[1:59] and the graves were opened
[2:02] and many bodies of the saints
[2:06] which slept arose
[2:11] and came out of their graves
[2:14] after his resurrection
[2:18] and went into the holy city
[2:22] and appeared to many
[2:26] thank god gracious
[2:29] loving heavenly father
[2:33] we thank thee lord for the reading of
[2:37] your word
[2:39] we pray now father that you will
[2:42] now as the soil is prepared may the seed
[2:46] of
[2:46] life find a resting place
[2:50] that it might bring forth fruit
[2:53] in jew season for thy glory and honor
[2:58] bless us each one open the eyes of our
[3:01] hearts
[3:03] lord god we ask this
[3:06] in no other name but in the name of
[3:09] jesus christ
[3:12] i thank god i've been changed
[3:15] my life has been changed
[3:19] by the great holy spirit and i
[3:22] trust that as we speak on this
[3:25] a wonderful subject here today
[3:29] in line with what we have already spoken
[3:35] then you will find god by his
[3:38] grace will be able to
[3:42] bring about a change in
[3:45] your life a total
[3:48] uh transformation
[3:52] or as i may say
[3:55] may god give you an extreme makeover
[4:00] of course we realize friends
[4:04] that the word is now in the bride
[4:09] the word that was from the
[4:13] great mighty angel that
[4:16] went to the seventh angel
[4:19] who gave forth a shout
[4:23] the shout was believed and received
[4:27] within the hearts of believers
[4:32] as a result of the shout
[4:35] being received in the heart
[4:38] of the elected that
[4:41] shout has now become
[4:45] his voice within us
[4:50] thus in the church ages brother branham
[4:53] made it clear the bride is
[4:57] now she has the voice of god
[5:01] and she knows what to do
[5:05] with the word why because she got it by
[5:08] revelation and now
[5:11] she is the final voice
[5:16] in the fine of this final age
[5:19] and we thank god that his voice
[5:22] is in us now we take the lord
[5:27] god the same voice
[5:31] that roared with seven
[5:34] thunders uttering their voices
[5:39] it was really one voice
[5:42] the voices of the seven messengers
[5:45] of the seven church ages combined
[5:50] saying the same thing one adding to the
[5:53] other to the other
[5:55] one great roll of thunder
[5:58] and the voice of god comes forth
[6:02] and now that voice
[6:06] is sundering through the bride of jesus
[6:09] christ
[6:11] that is the voice of the resurrected
[6:14] christ
[6:16] raised from the dead and a lie
[6:19] forevermore
[6:20] praise god and he is speaking
[6:24] through his bride not in
[6:27] the form of jesus christ back there
[6:32] but in the bright form or in the form
[6:35] of a bright church multiplied
[6:40] speaking through them voices voices
[6:43] voices from half of the throne voices
[6:47] from the throne
[6:48] of god that is within their hearts so
[6:51] the voices
[6:52] which is the voice make up the voice
[6:56] all the voices thousands
[6:59] of living voices combined together
[7:04] around the world africa
[7:07] india china wherever the voices are
[7:11] elected are when those voices are
[7:14] combined together in
[7:15] unity it is the roaring voice
[7:18] of the lion of the tribe of judah the
[7:22] voice of
[7:22] jesus christ voice of the second
[7:25] adam speaking his word now you say
[7:29] brother simon the voice is now in the
[7:32] bride
[7:33] yes the spirit
[7:36] is now speaking through the bride
[7:40] hallelujah for the spirit speaks through
[7:43] the prophet
[7:44] hallelujah and now the bride
[7:48] vocalizes hallelujah
[7:52] the word of god listen
[7:56] brother bobby roark a precious brother i
[8:00] know
[8:01] preach a wonderful message giving
[8:05] voice to the word and that
[8:08] uh basically the bible written
[8:12] it's written here but when you
[8:16] take it in your heart and you
[8:19] are anointed by the holy spirit
[8:22] and you speak it to someone or some
[8:25] group or crowd
[8:27] again then you are giving
[8:31] voice to the word the
[8:34] word then has a voice
[8:37] by using you o praise
[8:40] god forevermore may god help me
[8:43] to surrender my all
[8:46] may god help us all to surrender our
[8:50] all to him that we may give his word
[8:54] a mighty voice oh glory to god
[8:58] now in the book of ephesians
[9:02] paul tells us clearly you
[9:05] you in particular had he quickened
[9:09] i thank god that his spirit
[9:13] has quickened us and so
[9:16] we are now already
[9:20] in a condition of experiencing
[9:24] god's quickening power
[9:27] of transformation
[9:30] hallelujah getting us ready
[9:34] or coming into readiness for the rapture
[9:39] and for the resurrection
[9:43] coming in a position
[9:46] of total deliverance where we can have
[9:50] complete deliverance
[9:53] praise god and i tell you friends
[9:57] that as time goes by or as time permits
[10:03] we find out that we will be permitted
[10:07] by god like these
[10:10] disciples and saints
[10:13] in the new testament where the bible
[10:17] tells us
[10:18] in the scripture that we just read
[10:22] that when the word was resurrected
[10:26] or restored back again
[10:29] when the word was restored or
[10:32] resurrected
[10:34] what happened the graves were
[10:37] opened and the saints
[10:40] as i've preached the fourth time that
[10:42] were in satan's prison house
[10:46] they were set free by jesus christ
[10:50] who took the chains and took
[10:54] them captive and brought them out of the
[10:58] prison house
[10:59] and so when he raised they raised
[11:02] and the bible tells us they started to
[11:06] appear
[11:08] in the streets of jerusalem
[11:11] oh and the saints begin to see them
[11:15] and they would appear and they would
[11:17] disappear
[11:19] and for 40 days supernatural
[11:23] happenings of supernatural
[11:27] appearances and disappearances
[11:31] of prophets patriarchs great men
[11:35] of the bible women of the bible
[11:38] appearing and disappearing
[11:42] and listen and the saints
[11:45] the disciples could see them
[11:48] could recognize them of who they
[11:52] really were praise god hallelujah
[11:56] oh brother sister i thank god
[11:59] right now that because this word
[12:03] is being preached around the world by
[12:06] various ministers
[12:08] many are raised many are being raised up
[12:12] out of their dead sleep of death
[12:14] spiritual death
[12:16] and they're being raised up into life
[12:19] to walk with jesus christ
[12:22] and to take their position with him
[12:27] and so hallelujah we see the same thing
[12:32] now taking place spiritually
[12:36] as one by one we gain the portals
[12:41] oh praise god the open door
[12:45] of the portals of god's word opening up
[12:50] and saints are beginning to walk in
[12:53] and recognize their day
[12:56] the message for their day the messenger
[12:59] for their day
[13:00] the one god eternal hallelujah
[13:04] they're recognizing many hidden
[13:08] mysterious truths that were in the bible
[13:12] that they don't want you to know but is
[13:16] now revealed praise god
[13:19] by the great wonderful holy
[13:22] spirit through the messenger amen
[13:26] has brought back the word to us and now
[13:29] the holy spirit
[13:31] is sending forth the word in great power
[13:35] and in revelation that man might come to
[13:38] know him the same yesterday
[13:42] today and forever hallelujah
[13:45] praise god what happened
[13:49] when those saints began to appear
[13:52] those patriarchs began to appear in the
[13:56] streets of jerusalem
[13:58] those disciples were allowed by god
[14:01] or permitted by god to look into the
[14:04] fourth dimension
[14:06] they were able to look into the next
[14:08] dimension
[14:10] and to be able to see hallelujah
[14:14] beyond this curtain of time
[14:18] listen the curtain was tore
[14:22] in the temple and that quentin
[14:25] that closed the people away from god
[14:29] now god tears the curtain of time
[14:33] and is now granting again to his people
[14:37] young men shall see visions
[14:41] old men are going to begin to dream
[14:44] dreams and upon my handmaidens
[14:47] upon the sisters i will pour
[14:51] out of my spirit saith the lord

[18:13] some many years ago
[18:16] brother branham had a buddy friend a
[18:20] wonderful brother who had
[18:24] the fate for healing and
[18:28] miracles in the midst of the people
[18:31] his name is recognized in
[18:35] christian circles brother
[18:38] fred bosworth brother bosworth
[18:42] a man of faith that god
[18:45] used in a marvelous way
[18:49] and brother branham tells the story
[18:53] of when brother bosworth
[18:57] was old and now bedridden
[19:02] and how that the time had come for him
[19:05] to go
[19:06] and to meet the lord
[19:10] but days before his actual
[19:13] departure from earth to glory
[19:18] they heard him begin to say oh
[19:22] hi uncle and he began speaking to his
[19:25] uncle
[19:26] as if he's right in the room
[19:29] and uh and then he'll come to himself
[19:31] and says
[19:32] where's uncle gone and they say he's not
[19:34] he wasn't here
[19:36] he said yes he was he was right here see
[19:39] brother bosworth while he
[19:43] is yet alive was crossing
[19:47] into that dimension
[19:51] and god was allowing him to see
[19:55] his loved ones he saw his
[19:58] mother his father begin to see his
[20:03] cousins talking with them
[20:06] they could hear him talking with those
[20:09] people
[20:10] oh glory to god amen
[20:14] and as he began to talk with them my
[20:17] friends
[20:18] after a while a few days passed
[20:21] and then he slipped away and
[20:24] went to the presence of the lord
[20:28] with a marvelous smile upon his face
[20:32] may god fill our hearts with joy
[20:35] help praise god that we can go
[20:38] into the presence of god now
[20:41] or whenever he wants to call us with
[20:45] joy and faith and peace
[20:48] within our heart their death has no fear
[20:52] holds no fear for us anymore praise
[20:56] god because absent from the body we're
[20:59] present with the lord
[21:01] when he calls me i will answer
[21:04] and i'll be somewhere listening for
[21:07] my name praise god why was that story
[21:13] or that incident
[21:16] told to us within the message of the
[21:20] prophet
[21:22] pointing to us that the same
[21:26] kind of experience that he had
[21:30] we would be able to
[21:33] experience the same thing maybe not
[21:37] every one of us but god
[21:40] will allow many of us to have
[21:44] glimpses of eternity
[21:48] just like brother branham
[21:52] tells in his wonderful sermon
[21:57] which i hold within my hand
[22:02] beyond the curtain of time
[22:05] and he tells how
[22:08] one morning
[22:12] god spoke to him
[22:17] he said i play i was laying on my bed
[22:22] and i had just a walk from sleep
[22:27] and i placed my hands behind my head
[22:30] and relaxed with my head on the pillow
[22:34] then i began to wonder what it would be
[22:37] like on the other side
[22:41] i realized that i have lived more than
[22:44] half my life
[22:46] if i lived to be as old as my people
[22:49] and i wanted to do more for the lord
[22:53] before i left this life
[22:56] and then i heard a voice saying
[22:59] you are just starting press the battle
[23:03] press the battle keep pressing keep
[23:06] pressing
[23:08] as i lay there pondering those
[23:11] the words i thought i had just imagined
[23:15] hearing a voice and the voice said again
[23:20] press the battle keep going keep going
[23:24] keep going and still unbelieving
[23:28] i thought possibly i have spoken
[23:32] the words myself and i placed my
[23:36] lips between my teeth
[23:40] like that and held my hand
[23:44] over my mouth and i listened
[23:48] listened again and
[23:52] the voice spoke again
[23:55] just keep pressing keep pressing the
[23:59] battle
[24:00] oh if you only knew
[24:03] what whets you at the end
[24:06] of the road amen hallelujah
[24:10] he said i then remembered an old song
[24:15] i'm so homesick and blue
[24:18] i want to see jesus
[24:22] i would like to hear those harbor bells
[24:25] chime it would brighten my
[24:28] path and banish my fears
[24:32] oh lord let me look past
[24:36] the curtain of time
[24:39] then the voice spoke again
[24:43] and said would you like to see
[24:47] just beyond the curtain and i
[24:50] answered it would help me
[24:53] so much what happened
[24:56] i cannot say whether i was in the body
[25:00] or out of my body or whether
[25:04] it was a translation
[25:07] i do not know but it was unlike any
[25:11] vision or anything i had ever had
[25:15] i could see the place to which i was
[25:17] taken
[25:19] i could see my sight self lying
[25:22] back there on the bed
[25:27] and i'm gone somewhere else
[25:33] i said that this is a strange thing
[25:39] and when i looked there were great
[25:42] numbers of people
[25:44] that came running to greet me crying
[25:47] oh our precious brother our precious
[25:51] brother first came young women in their
[25:54] twenties amen
[25:57] oh our precious brother young men
[26:00] of brilliance in the brilliance of their
[26:03] manhood
[26:04] eyes glistening like stars and
[26:08] teeth as white as pearls saying
[26:11] o our precious brother our precious
[26:14] brother
[26:16] then i notice that i had become
[26:20] young again myself oh
[26:23] i looked at myself and turned and looked
[26:26] back at my old body
[26:29] laying on the bed back there
[26:33] but here i was young again
[26:38] oh blessed be god brother sisters we all
[26:41] will be made young again to never grow
[26:45] old
[26:47] oh my as i began
[26:50] to comprehend the place where i was
[26:54] i began to realize in this place
[26:57] there is no yesterday there
[27:00] is no tomorrow no
[27:05] and we never got tired
[27:10] multitudes of them
[27:13] began to say oh our precious
[27:17] brother and greet me with overwhelming
[27:21] love i only discovered
[27:25] that there was only great love
[27:28] no physical attractions there
[27:31] as in the human behavior
[27:36] i notice that the women
[27:39] wore their hair down
[27:42] and their skirts were down to their
[27:46] feet then the voice spoke again
[27:51] this is what you preached that the holy
[27:54] ghost is
[27:56] this is perfect love nothing can enter
[28:00] here
[28:01] without it next i was taken
[28:05] up and seated on a high place
[28:09] all around me were great numbers of
[28:12] men and women shouting crying oh
[28:16] our precious brother we are so happy to
[28:19] see you
[28:20] here and i thought i'm not dreaming how
[28:23] can
[28:23] i see these people how can i look back
[28:26] and see my body
[28:27] lying there and the voice spoke again
[28:32] it is written in the bible that the
[28:36] prophets were gathered
[28:38] with their people and i
[28:41] go oh my yes i remember
[28:45] the voice i asked uh are these
[28:48] all branhams the voice
[28:51] replied these are not branhams
[28:56] hallelujah but these
[28:59] are your converts
[29:02] the ones that you led to the lord
[29:06] some of these young women you think are
[29:08] so

[29:35] and the holy spirit the angel had to
[29:38] make him know those were your

[30:31] name of the lord

[38:26] what god has done and what god is doing
[38:29] first thessalonians 4 we which
[38:32] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[38:37] and so shall we ever be with the lord
[38:41] how wonderful that while we are alive

[39:39] we realize that god
[39:42] left some of his creation to adam
[39:47] to continue and when jesus was here
[39:52] his cup this ministry was not
[39:55] completed amen
[39:59] remember the bride is part of him
[40:04] so that part of his ministry it is
[40:07] becoming unto her
[40:09] to fulfill all righteousness
[40:12] all of the word of god amen
[40:15] so the bride has to be the continuation
[40:21] of the earthly ministry
[40:24] of jesus christ but paul
[40:27] tells us that he has committed unto us
[40:32] the ministry of reconciliation
[40:37] amen so here we have the ministry
[40:40] of reconciliation what is that
[40:43] that we would be his voice
[40:48] to call the rest of the elected
[40:51] seed that are out there to come
[40:54] back home to god and to be reconciled
[40:58] back to him to have a uniting time with
[41:02] him
[41:03] and to know him not to know the church
[41:06] not to know theology not to know some
[41:09] form of religious knowledge not to be
[41:11] excited
[41:12] because you've been let into some great
[41:15] religious
[41:16] knowledge but that god himself
[41:19] has let you experience his person and
[41:22] his
[41:23] presence by revealing and making himself
[41:26] known
[41:26] to you and lighting up your life and
[41:29] your
[41:30] understanding so that you could
[41:32] recognize him
[41:33] who he is amen and so here we
[41:36] are with the voice of christ the law
[41:40] resurrected one in us calling the rest
[41:46] of the elected seed
[41:49] from the dust of the earth from amongst
[41:52] humanity

[41:57] whether they are up in a river whether
[41:59] they're down in a valley whether they're
[42:02] on the mountain top
[42:04] whether they're in a modern climate
[42:06] whether they're
[42:07] down somewhere in the deep south whether
[42:10] they're in the southern countries
[42:13] whether they're in islands of the sea
[42:16] wherever they
[42:17] are in a desert wherever they are
[42:20] in jungles the spirit of god and the
[42:24] knowledge of the lord is covering the
[42:26] entire earth
[42:27] as the waters cover the sea and god in
[42:31] this
[42:31] hour by the voice oh hallelujah
[42:35] of this resurrected christ is calling
[42:38] he's elected
[42:39] back to himself amen and bringing them
[42:43] to himself

[42:49] revelation 10 1 in spirit form
[42:54] has come to earth again and is now
[42:57] speaking out
[42:59] of the bride with that voice
[43:02] the voice of the mighty angel
[43:06] the voice of seven thunders
[43:09] thundering speaking through the voice
[43:12] through the
[43:13] voice of the bride now you say oh
[43:16] i don't see any shaking i don't no but
[43:19] he said i
[43:20] shake the heavens and shake the earth
[43:23] and i'll shake them again by the power
[43:25] of god
[43:26] the holy spirit is doing a spiritual
[43:29] shaking up
[43:30] the holy spirit is shaking the church
[43:33] world
[43:34] the holy spirit is shaking the normal
[43:37] and natural world
[43:39] you praise god you may not eyes may not
[43:41] be able to see it
[43:42] your ears may not be able to hear it but

[44:12] brother sister
[44:13] we're gonna keep running we're gonna
[44:15] keep pressing
[44:16] we're gonna keep pressing the battle
[44:18] hallelujah
[44:19] in every way that we can until the lord
[44:23] calls us home
[44:24] oh what an encouraging word from god
[44:28] that we are given this great thing to do
[44:31] amen hallelujah amen praise god
[44:35] let me tell your friends
[44:38] that same voice of the mighty angel of
[44:42] revelation 10
[44:43] 1 is the same voice
[44:48] that spoke out of jesus
[44:52] when he came to the tomb of lazarus
[44:55] and they said master our brother is
[44:58] dead he's he he's four days
[45:02] dead and behold
[45:05] he is tinkered oh we can't
[45:08] we should not he says no roll the stone
[45:12] away
[45:13] he said lord but he will raise
[45:17] up in the resurrection he said
[45:21] i am the resurrection
[45:24] and the life praise god hallelujah
[45:28] the resurrection the rapture is not
[45:30] something
[45:31] it's not just an event the resurrection
[45:34] and
[45:35] rapture is the person of jesus christ
[45:38] hallelujah oh my and he said
[45:42] i am the resurrection i am the life
[45:46] roll back the stone hallelujah
[45:50] and they rolled back the stone when they
[45:53] rolled back the stone
[45:56] the pharisees are looking on now to
[45:57] criticize
[45:59] they're looking on now to have a good
[46:01] laugh
[46:03] they're looking on now you know
[46:06] they're going to make that preacher look
[46:08] so foolish
[46:09] so let him get up there and raise his
[46:12] voice and
[46:13] preach like that and talk all those
[46:15] things
[46:16] and let's see what's going to happen and
[46:18] the bible tells us
[46:21] jesus lifted up his voice
[46:24] last russ come forth and when he said
[46:28] lazarus come forth in the words of that
[46:30] serpent
[46:31] his voice traveled right through
[46:34] eternities
[46:35] right to where lazarus's spirit
[46:39] was traveling back to god and his
[46:42] voice caught lazarus's attention and
[46:45] brought him back from where he was
[46:48] hallelujah and the bible tells us
[46:51] he walked out of that tomb
[46:55] when they saw him they were amazed they
[46:58] were aghast
[46:59] oh praise god some of some of you
[47:02] wherever you are people may be
[47:04] astonished
[47:06] at the change in your life the
[47:08] transformation
[47:09] on your walk in your talk how you change
[47:12] your friends
[47:13] or your chat your friends stay away from
[47:15] you because they don't want to hear
[47:17] that jesus business that one god
[47:20] business
[47:21] that that baptism in jesus name jesus
[47:23] business
[47:24] that prophet business that message
[47:27] business
[47:28] they don't want to hear about the
[47:29] serpent's seed
[47:31] in the garden they don't want to hear
[47:33] the truth of the word of god
[47:35] and so god's word calls for a total
[47:38] separation
[47:40] from all unbelief and sets you free
[47:43] to worship him and to walk in the light
[47:46] of his way
[47:47] that same voice that cried out
[47:51] lazarus comfort that voice is
[47:54] crying out again today doing it through
[47:58] the bride
[47:59] hallelujah while brother branham was
[48:02] here on earth
[48:03] he demonstrated and manifested the voice
[48:07] in him
[48:08] in the form of the third pull the word
[48:11] of god
[48:12] rey bringing a fish back to life again
[48:16] that word of god stopping a storm
[48:19] that was about to take place that word
[48:22] of god
[48:24] moving and saving the sons of sister
[48:27] heavy right
[48:28] that voice of god speaking through the
[48:31] prophet
[48:31] and now that voice is in the bride
[48:35] hallelujah
[48:37] amen that voice was on the apostles
[48:40] as they walked by there was a beggar
[48:45] at the beautiful gate and he
[48:49] asked them for some money
[48:53] but there were poor preachers
[48:57] they were not like these money hungry
[49:00] preachers that you have today
[49:03] they were not like some of these
[49:07] men that all they are is for filthy luca
[49:12] now matter of fact let me it's in the
[49:15] bible read the book of acts
[49:17] silver and gold we have none
[49:20] peter and john told him we are broke
[49:24] silver and gold we have none
[49:28] you just told them we are broke but such
[49:31] as we have
[49:33] we give unto you what did they have the
[49:35] holy spirit
[49:36] what did they have the word of god
[49:39] revealed to them
[49:40] amen rise take up your bed and walk
[49:45] hallelujah and the bible says straight
[49:47] way
[49:48] the man got up took
[49:51] jumped in the air and began to run
[49:54] around
[49:55] and he was healed by the power of god
[49:59] the miracle power of god struck him
[50:02] because the same voice
[50:04] that spoke through jesus and spoke
[50:07] and called back lazarus that same voice
[50:12] was calling this man to rise and stand
[50:15] up on his feet
[50:16] that voice was in the prophet
[50:19] thousands thousands delivered saved
[50:23] and even the dead rays by the voice of
[50:27] god
[50:27] in these last days and that same
[50:31] voice has returned in this bright class
[50:34] of people
[50:35] in this hour and in this time once again
[50:39] to cry out
[50:40] as god will lead us as god will guide us
[50:43] he will tell you when
[50:45] it's not for us to go around thinking we
[50:47] just was speaking speaking
[50:49] but under his guidance under his
[50:51] leadership
[50:52] on his direct command and then
[50:56] watch my friends the word watch what
[50:59] takes place amen
[51:01] hallelujah i want you to know that voice
[51:05] was in peter and john that voice
[51:08] is in us now the second adam
[51:12] is now thundering through his bride

[52:24] the male is the carrier
[52:27] of life
[52:31] but the woman
[52:35] is the one that manifests that's life
[52:38] and brings it to pass or
[52:41] brings it to life amen
[52:45] praise god a man can have all the
[52:47] children he want in him
