[16:14] at the the topic of
[16:18] season
[16:19] of holy convocation
[16:23] season of holy convocation
[16:28] and our scripture
[16:31] is found in the book of leviticus
[16:36] chapter
[16:37] 23
[16:39] reading from
[16:41] verse 39
[16:46] and also
[16:48] in the 15th day of the seventh month
[16:53] when ye were gathered in
[16:56] have gathered in the fruit of the land
[17:01] you shall keep a feast
[17:04] unto the lord
[17:06] seven days
[17:09] on the first day
[17:11] shall be
[17:13] a sabbath
[17:15] and on the eighth day
[17:17] shall be
[17:18] a sabbath
[17:21] and ye shall take you
[17:24] on the first day the boughs of goodly
[17:27] trees
[17:28] branches
[17:30] of palm trees and the boughs
[17:33] of sick trees
[17:35] and the willows of the brook
[17:38] and you shall rejoice before the lord
[17:41] your god
[17:43] seven days
[17:46] and you shall keep
[17:48] a feast
[17:50] unto the lord

[18:02] in your generations
[18:05] you shall celebrate it
[18:08] in the seventh month
[18:10] you shall dwell in boots
[18:14] seven days
[18:16] all that are israelites born
[18:19] shall dwell
[18:21] in boots
[18:23] that your generations may know
[18:27] that i made the children of israel to
[18:30] dwell
[18:31] in boots
[18:33] when i brought them out of the land of
[18:36] egypt
[18:37] i am the lord
[18:40] thy god
[18:42] and moses declared unto the children of
[18:45] israel
[18:46] the feasts
[18:48] of the lord
[18:50] hallelujah
[18:51] amen
[18:54] now
[18:55] my friends
[18:58] i want to point out to you that
[19:02] this wonderful nation of israel
[19:06] had three
[19:08] feasts fall feasts
[19:11] that they keep
[19:13] for the lord
[19:16] in the month of tishrei
[19:19] which is september
[19:22] to those of us that go according to the
[19:26] english calendar
[19:27] september 1st
[19:30] was
[19:31] and still is feast of the trumpets
[19:37] september 10th
[19:39] the feast
[19:41] of the day of atonement
[19:45] and september 15th
[19:48] was the feast
[19:51] of tabernacles or feast of boots
[19:56] as it may be called
[19:58] or it's also called time of him
[20:01] gathering
[20:02] time oven gathering
[20:05] and god caused them to
[20:08] live in boots
[20:10] uh
[20:11] the word sukkahs
[20:14] has been used
[20:16] so that they may be
[20:18] reminded
[20:20] that they are pilgrims and strangers
[20:24] in the land
[20:26] oh praise the name of our god
[20:29] forevermore
[20:30] we give him all the glory and praise
[20:33] hallelujah strangers in the land
[20:37] now
[20:39] this marvelous time
[20:41] of the feasts of boots
[20:46] seven days
[20:47] which represents the seven church ages
[20:52] and i will
[20:53] pass over this briefly
[20:56] because uh next sunday
[20:59] i will come to this subject from another
[21:03] point of view to point out and expand
[21:08] on those
[21:09] matters
[21:11] but here we are
[21:13] looking at israel
[21:15] having this feast for seven days
[21:20] and
[21:21] on the eighth day
[21:24] the eighth day
[21:26] there were to come in the presence of
[21:28] god
[21:29] the seven days being a type of the seven
[21:32] church ages
[21:34] and the eighth day
[21:37] a type
[21:38] of holy convocation
[21:42] eighth day
[21:43] a type or sign
[21:46] of another eternal day
[21:51] we realize that adam and eve
[21:54] lived in an eternal day and time
[21:59] for a season
[22:01] and they fell out of it
[22:04] into
[22:05] the
[22:06] frame
[22:07] that we call time
[22:09] they fell from eternity into time
[22:13] and so the apostles also
[22:17] on the day of pentecost
[22:19] they had the marvelous
[22:21] opportunity
[22:24] of breaking entering in
[22:26] to this eighth day experience
[22:30] uh
[22:32] and to
[22:33] live in
[22:34] what
[22:35] i call
[22:37] the eternal day or a day
[22:41] which is really
[22:43] the first day
[22:45] similar to the first day
[22:47] right there they were
[22:49] as a journalist in the land
[22:52] god wanted israel to know
[22:55] no matter how prosperous you become
[22:59] no matter how many great buildings you
[23:01] have put up
[23:02] be ready to leave at any time
[23:06] because you are only pilgrim and
[23:08] strangers here
[23:10] and so are the true believers
[23:13] to recognize
[23:15] and understand
[23:17] no matter how prosperous we may become
[23:20] no matter what foundations we have upon
[23:23] this earth we must always be ready to
[23:27] answer our master's call
[23:30] or praise god whether to work
[23:35] on the earth here
[23:37] before he comes
[23:38] or to answer his call when he comes but
[23:42] we must always be vigilant
[23:45] watchful and ready for his marvelous
[23:50] wonderful coming hallelujah
[23:53] now adam and eve
[23:55] they lived on an eternal
[23:58] day
[24:00] the apostles lived
[24:04] in an eternal day for a season until
[24:07] they broke out of the word the pure word
[24:09] of god
[24:11] now it's our time
[24:14] it's our turn as a people
[24:17] to live
[24:19] in the
[24:20] great
[24:21] word of god in this eternal day
[24:25] or time
[24:27] season
[24:28] of holy
[24:30] convocation for the eternal day the
[24:34] eighth day
[24:35] is a time of holy convocation
[24:40] and this takes place
[24:42] after the church ages are over
[24:47] after the fullness of time
[24:50] hallelujah
[24:52] then comes
[24:53] the eighth day
[24:56] i want you to listen to this
[25:00] as brother branham
[25:02] speaks
[25:05] future home of the heavenly bride
[25:08] and the earthly bride
[25:10] bridegroom an earthly bride
[25:13] now in ephesians 1 10
[25:18] it's called
[25:20] not the seventh day
[25:22] it's called the fullness of time
[25:26] and when the fullness of time
[25:30] was has come
[25:32] that's when time has been
[25:35] fulfilled
[25:37] when there is no more time
[25:41] then you go
[25:43] into eternity
[25:46] after
[25:47] the seventh church age is over
[25:51] you go
[25:53] into eternity
[25:55] and luther's age is over
[25:58] methodist age is over
[26:01] and now
[26:02] you go into what you go into
[26:06] eternity where there are no more sevens
[26:11] hallelujah
[26:13] no more of that
[26:15] you are now
[26:17] in eternity where you do not have
[26:21] numbers and times and things to deal
[26:25] with amen praise god hallelujah now i
[26:29] want you to understand this
[26:32] what is brother branham speaking about
[26:36] he
[26:36] he's not telling us that physically
[26:40] when the seven church ages are over
[26:44] that we just
[26:45] walk into eternity
[26:48] but he is speaking to the elect
[26:51] he's speaking to the members of the
[26:54] lord's bride
[26:56] that are within the message within the
[26:58] church
[27:00] within
[27:01] the flock
[27:02] there within it
[27:04] and so he is saying
[27:07] in your soul
[27:09] that eternal part of your being
[27:13] your gene
[27:14] that is in you
[27:16] oh praise god
[27:18] after the seven church ages are over
[27:22] spiritually after you have come true
[27:26] in your experience the seven church ages
[27:30] by revelation
[27:32] by
[27:32] understanding you enter
[27:35] back into eternity again where you come
[27:39] from
[27:40] you came from god you're going back to
[27:43] god you came from his presence you go
[27:46] back to his presence blessed be the name
[27:49] of the living god oh praise god
[27:53] oh my how wonderful it is to know
[27:57] that after
[27:59] the church ages are over after the
[28:02] fullness of time is over you know what
[28:05] the bible tells us revelation 10
[28:09] 1 to 7
[28:11] how the great mighty angel
[28:14] came down from the heavens
[28:17] with a rainbow around his head
[28:20] roaring a mighty voice
[28:22] like when a lion roar seven thunders
[28:26] uttering their voices
[28:28] and as the mighty angel
[28:31] all one foot on the land and one foot on
[28:35] the sea
[28:36] with his hands raised to heaven and in
[28:39] the other hand an open book hallelujah
[28:43] and says time shall be no more
[28:48] oh so you may understand he was saying
[28:51] an announcing
[28:53] that with the ministry of the seventh
[28:56] angel of revelation 10 7 the church ages
[29:02] are over
[29:03] the church ages are complete they are
[29:07] finished and now
[29:09] that
[29:11] the portal is ready now you are ready to
[29:15] uh to enter in to that
[29:18] feast
[29:19] that holy convocation
[29:22] that holy eight-day convocation this
[29:26] season of the supernatural
[29:29] entry
[29:30] into the presence of almighty god where
[29:34] god is able to feast along with his
[29:38] people glory be to his holy and
[29:42] wonderful name for this marvelous
[29:45] entrance that we have into his divine
[29:48] presence
[29:50] now many have preached
[29:53] and many have taught
[29:55] about this subject or on this subject
[29:59] of the holy convocation
[30:02] god bless their hearts
[30:04] they spoke it preached it and taught it
[30:07] according to their understanding and
[30:10] that is what i am doing here today
[30:12] preaching it according to my
[30:16] understanding from the word of god as
[30:19] given to me so here we are brother
[30:21] sister
[30:25] once again hearing of this
[30:28] topic which you might have heard about
[30:30] it before because in the day in which we
[30:33] live
[30:34] everywhere we are hearing about holy
[30:37] convocations
[30:40] and
[30:42] churches are having holy convocations
[30:45] denominations are having holy
[30:47] convocations
[30:49] and so i want to show you
[30:52] that we are now living
[30:54] in the actual season
[30:56] of god's holy convocation
[31:01] and that we are living not
[31:04] in the seventh church age
[31:08] physically we are still in that but
[31:10] spiritually
[31:13] you have if you have caught the
[31:15] revelation
[31:17] then you have
[31:18] entered in
[31:20] to the holy convocation
[31:22] god's holy convocation
[31:26] hallelujah for the eight day feast
[31:30] the holy convocation
[31:33] is the feast after
[31:36] the seventh day feast
[31:39] oh praise god you go to the new
[31:41] testament you'll remember that jesus
[31:44] came towards the end of the last day of
[31:48] the feast
[31:49] and lifted up his voice
[31:52] oh praise god hallelujah amen
[31:56] and everywhere we can see various
[31:59] denominations
[32:01] are organizing
[32:04] convocations
[32:06] great conventions
[32:08] and they're calling
[32:10] them holy
[32:12] convocations
[32:14] but i'm not speaking
[32:16] about those church
[32:18] denominational church
[32:21] convocations
[32:22] or conventions
[32:24] whatsoever
[32:26] i am speaking about god's
[32:29] great holy convocation
[32:32] you say well
[32:34] brother simon
[32:36] what is
[32:37] a convocation
[32:39] what really
[32:40] is a convocation
[32:44] and you will find that the word
[32:46] convocate
[32:48] means together
[32:52] to assemble
[32:55] or to congregate
[32:58] or
[32:59] to meet
[33:01] convocate
[33:04] when we say convocation
[33:07] we're speaking of a a great gathering of
[33:11] people
[33:13] a great meeting
[33:15] you're having a great meeting
[33:17] or you you may use the
[33:20] word or thought a great assembly
[33:24] see a great assembly
[33:27] oh and in particular
[33:30] in particular
[33:31] when the word
[33:33] convocation is used
[33:35] it's used in terms of congregation's
[33:39] great assembly of clergy
[33:42] of of men and of god coming together
[33:47] to talk about the things of the church
[33:50] the things that the word uh in those
[33:54] in that way
[33:56] and so when we use convocate
[33:58] it's the leadership
[34:01] of the church
[34:02] uh coming together
[34:05] various delegates
[34:07] i'm speaking naturally here come
[34:09] together
[34:10] and they're speaking on the affairs
[34:13] of the church of god
[34:17] but not only that convocate speaks of
[34:22] the formal assembly
[34:25] of a college
[34:27] or university
[34:30] especially
[34:31] at the time of graduation
[34:35] and i have attended some of those
[34:38] uh when there is a great convocation

[35:27] diplomas there in the presence of
[35:30] admiring friends
[35:33] oh my
[35:34] yes sir so
[35:36] that is mainly what convocate means
[35:42] now i can remember when i was a boy
[35:47] just at school
[35:49] uh in my memory i think of this
[35:53] how
[35:55] we would have
[35:56] in those days they rang a bell
[35:59] they rang a bell
[36:01] to let you know it's time
[36:03] for classes to start
[36:06] it's lunch time we are let out
[36:09] and then
[36:10] they would ring a bell
[36:12] for us to return back
[36:15] to our classes
[36:16] when the classes were over they'd ring
[36:19] another bell
[36:20] but
[36:22] when
[36:23] a very important person
[36:27] like the queen the president
[36:30] or the principal
[36:33] someone
[36:34] of great reputation note someone
[36:39] having something important to say
[36:42] then they rang the bell but that bill
[36:46] had a different tone to it a different
[36:49] sound to it and
[36:52] you knew
[36:53] by the ringing of that bell that this
[36:56] was not an ordinary meeting this was not
[36:59] an ordinary assembly this was a
[37:03] convocation for a get-together for the
[37:07] entire school to be present for this
[37:11] because this person is fixing to speak
[37:15] and we would all make sure that we are
[37:18] there in time for it praise god
[37:22] but this convocation
[37:25] of which i am speaking
[37:28] jesus christ himself is the speaker or
[37:32] the convocator of this meeting
[37:35] hallelujah
[37:36] he is the convocator convocator the one
[37:40] who calls for the convocation and our
[37:43] great shepherd
[37:45] is now calling his sheep
[37:48] calling them by the opening of the
[37:51] seventh seal and the calling for
[37:53] sounding forth of their names within the
[37:58] word of god as it's being revealed to
[38:01] them to recognize themselves
[38:04] in god's word of this hour and of this
[38:08] time hallelujah amen
[38:11] yes sir oh praise god hallelujah i'm so
[38:16] glad
[38:17] our great shepherd is calling all his
[38:20] sheep
[38:21] and is calling them by name
[38:24] for
[38:25] he knows his sheep
[38:27] and his sheep knows his voice
[38:30] and they know how to answer praise god
[38:34] and they answer his call glory be to god
[38:38] hallelujah he's calling his sheep
[38:41] calling them together
[38:43] summoning them together into his divine
[38:46] presence glory be to god
[38:50] forevermore oh my oh praise god
[38:54] i bless his holy name i'm thinking
[38:58] of up here in northern canada
[39:01] we have a lot of ducks
[39:04] and
[39:06] they have their season for the laying of
[39:09] their eggs
[39:11] and
[39:12] the hatching of the eggs
[39:15] and those eggs would hatch
[39:18] and out of them will come the
[39:21] ducks
[39:22] various
[39:23] young ducks
[39:25] and amongst them will be a young drake
[39:29] a wonderful
[39:31] uh
[39:32] leader for the flock for when they're
[39:34] going to head south
[39:36] or praise god to escape from the
[39:40] blistering cold winds and ice
[39:45] on formality of winter they're escaping
[39:48] to the south
[39:50] and a young leader would arise
[39:54] just born he's never been south he
[39:58] doesn't know the way how to get there
[40:00] oh praise god but then as time a season
[40:05] comes around
[40:06] something within him causes him to begin
[40:10] to crawl out he begins to cry out and
[40:13] call the other ducks all around him i
[40:16] believe god used our precious brother
[40:19] william branham for that purpose
[40:22] to begin to call together
[40:25] his people amen in the last stages of
[40:29] his ministry
[40:30] or praise god when he moved out of the
[40:35] office of just being seventh angel to
[40:38] become the fullness of the voice
[40:42] of the
[40:43] mighty angel of revelation 10 1
[40:46] and there
[40:48] oh praise god inviting god's bride god's
[40:53] children to go into this time of holy
[40:58] convocation oh glory to god and he would
[41:02] assemble them bring them together
[41:05] hallelujah and they will come together
[41:08] amen
[41:10] i want you to see
[41:12] what drew them together
[41:14] what caused him to be able to crawl out
[41:17] together what caused them to all want to
[41:21] go south or praise god because naturally
[41:25] they have an instinct in them
[41:29] something called instinct
[41:31] and when the time comes they'll all fly
[41:34] up and when they fly up they don't even
[41:37] know their way but led by the instinct
[41:41] that is within them it'll take that
[41:44] young
[41:46] duck and those other ducks they'll fly
[41:49] straight down to the south and they'll
[41:52] find no doubt the swamp or the pond
[41:56] where their parents were feeding in the
[41:59] year before and they'll go back right
[42:02] there maybe even find the old nest and
[42:06] they will go right back there all my
[42:09] friends praise be to god
[42:12] that the same holy spirit is right here
[42:16] with us that was with all the patriarchs
[42:19] all the prophets all the apostles all
[42:22] the saints of all the ages oh blessed be
[42:25] to god the name of the lord hallelujah
[42:29] and the same holy spirit all by a
[42:32] supernatural instinct and inspiration
[42:37] hallelujah begins to lead us
[42:40] back to heaven so that we may take a
[42:42] rapture never went there before
[42:46] never flew into the presence of god like
[42:49] that before but he will lead us and
[42:53] guide us right there into the presence
[42:56] of god but we must
[42:59] convocate
[43:01] come to a meeting
[43:03] of minds meeting of hearts
[43:06] a convocation
[43:08] of divine revelation
[43:11] convocation with a watchman on the walls
[43:15] of zion
[43:16] see eye to eye
[43:18] oh praise god because they have caught
[43:21] the revelation
[43:24] of the last prophet's message
[43:26] they caught the revelation
[43:29] of the fullness of the word of god
[43:32] and it doesn't matter if they never met
[43:36] before they never heard the other one
[43:39] before they never seen each other the
[43:42] other before or like paul and barnabas
[43:45] and peter all praise god when they come
[43:49] together they still find themselves
[43:52] saying the very same thing maybe himself
[43:56] in different ways but saying the same
[43:59] thing because there's only one god
[44:03] and there's only one divine revelation
[44:07] of himself
[44:08] so no matter where we are who we are and
[44:12] we look at the whole plan of god
[44:15] we can only see one god
[44:18] one revelation one jesus christ oh
[44:22] praise his marvelous and wonderful name
[44:25] amen
[44:27] praise god forever
[44:29] so
[44:30] here we are by holy ghost instinct
[44:35] brought together
[44:37] by the grace of almighty god
[44:40] amen
[44:41] as us
[44:42] the prophet has said magnetized
[44:46] we are drawn together by a magnetic pull
[44:50] of the holy spirit
[44:52] the third pull
[44:54] the great holy spirit of almighty god i
[44:58] know to some i sound as if i'm speaking
[45:00] in other towns and cannot be fully
[45:03] understood
[45:05] but to those whom god has given eyes to
[45:08] see ears to hear
[45:10] god it's clear pure to their hearts and
[45:14] their rejoicing night and day as they
[45:17] walk this narrow way for the hand of god
[45:21] upon their lives they see or praise his
[45:24] marvelous name and if you can't see if
[45:27] you can't understand right now you lack
[45:30] wisdom the bible says ask of god who
[45:35] giveth liberally to all that will ask
[45:38] him and he will deny you not but ask the
[45:42] lord god open my eyes that i might see
[45:46] glimpses of truth oh god from thee open
[45:49] the eyes of my heart lord i want to know
[45:53] and see what it is that these brethren
[45:56] are seeing what they have caught onto
[46:00] what is being made known to them oh
[46:03] blessed be and my friends if you come
[46:06] humbly
[46:09] if you come
[46:10] with open heart
[46:12] if you come repentant
[46:15] god
[46:16] will reveal himself unto you
[46:20] and you know god puts filters barriers
[46:23] and things
[46:24] that unless you are his genuine seed
[46:28] it'd be hard for you to get past those
[46:30] filters
[46:31] he'll put filters like uh making the man
[46:34] uh
[46:35] save things that might not be sound
[46:38] accurate he'll make him act sometimes
[46:41] crude
[46:42] he'll make a profit where camel's skin
[46:46] is not dressed right he's
[46:48] maybe he don't talk right maybe he
[46:50] doesn't have the proper grammar maybe
[46:52] he's uneducated like peter
[46:55] or maybe you know he's like john
[46:59] they come out never oh god have mercy
[47:03] just to create a filter
[47:06] and if you can only get past that filter
[47:09] oh and get beyond the veil and be able
[47:13] to see and to recognize the presence of
[47:17] the living god you'll go through such a
[47:20] life change such a change a
[47:23] transformation by the presence of the

[1:01:09] oh they feel they can shout it down they
[1:01:12] can dance it down they can sing it down
[1:01:15] they they can do whatever they believe
[1:01:18] that that creating an atmosphere
[1:01:21] to break in
[1:01:23] to the
[1:01:24] dimensions of god
[1:01:27] and of the supernatural realm of god
[1:01:30] and my friends but i'm here to say that
[1:01:33] is not the way
[1:01:36] you might have come
[1:01:37] that way
[1:01:39] during the seventh
[1:01:40] church age
[1:01:42] but the seventh church age
[1:01:45] is over and gone
[1:01:49] spiritually
[1:01:51] experientially
[1:01:53] those who recognize what has happened
[1:01:57] what is happening
[1:01:59] oh praise god we enter in by the
[1:02:03] revelation opening of the doorway or
[1:02:07] portal
[1:02:08] of the word of god
[1:02:10] to see the unseen
[1:02:12] to come to a perfect realization
[1:02:15] a complete recognition of the great
[1:02:19] circle
[1:02:20] of eternity and of eternal things
[1:02:24] for his glory and honor
[1:02:26] oh
[1:02:27] some believe that god can be bribed said
[1:02:30] peter can be bribed that they can enter
[1:02:33] in
[1:02:34] by their wealth
[1:02:37] that they can
[1:02:39] pull it over god's eyes
[1:02:41] and their culture they'll be able to
[1:02:43] slip through or climb in to the window
[1:02:47] by culture
[1:02:48] some believe
[1:02:50] that by
[1:02:51] having a wonderful service of filled
[1:02:53] with dignity
[1:02:55] and culture
[1:02:57] oh and respectability
[1:03:00] there may be able to enter in to this
[1:03:04] convocation
[1:03:06] but this holy convocation that i am
[1:03:09] speaking of none can enter there unless
[1:03:13] they have been invited by the convocator
[1:03:17] jesus christ himself has to invite you

[1:03:26] because you've been given eyes to see if
[1:03:29] you're elected you've been given ears to
[1:03:31] hear if you were elected but unto them
[1:03:35] it is not given it is given unto you and
[1:03:38] you ought to praise god and take god
[1:03:41] that is open your eyes of your own heart
[1:03:44] praise god others try to slip in
[1:03:49] or climb through the window of good
[1:03:50] works
[1:03:52] they believe
[1:03:54] that they
[1:03:56] may be able to get in
[1:03:59] without
[1:04:01] the wedding garment
[1:04:03] they believe they can climb in
[1:04:07] by being
[1:04:08] a good person
[1:04:10] oh i lived a good life i never hurt
[1:04:12] anyone i never swore at anyone and ever
[1:04:15] cursed anyone i never did any evil to

[1:04:34] to this convocation
[1:04:37] natural convocations you're not allowed
[1:04:40] in without having your token ticket or
[1:04:44] pass
[1:04:45] because of the things that will be
[1:04:47] discussed even in the natural
[1:04:50] convocations
[1:04:51] when it comes to this supernatural
[1:04:54] convocation the holy convocation of the
[1:04:58] spirit of almighty god none can enter
[1:05:01] there except those who have been invited
[1:05:05] by him the great holy spirit no matter
[1:05:08] what good works you have you try to
[1:05:11] enter in without having on the wedding
[1:05:14] garment you're not robbed
[1:05:17] by the holy spirit you don't wear the
[1:05:20] holy spirit on you as a robe he hasn't
[1:05:23] covered you under his wings and brought
[1:05:26] you
[1:05:27] under
[1:05:28] his severity and preeminence oh praise
[1:05:31] god hallelujah amen
[1:05:35] oh my
[1:05:36] my friends
[1:05:38] what a wonderful time to know the true
[1:05:41] believer to rejoice and know
[1:05:44] they're brought in
[1:05:46] to a holy convocation
[1:05:49] by the holy spirit himself
[1:05:52] oh
[1:05:53] but yet
[1:05:54] there are many convocations going on
[1:05:56] everywhere everybody has a convocation
[1:05:59] and what are you talking about
[1:06:03] about a holy convocation we heard about
[1:06:06] it so many times
[1:06:07] but let me tell your friends back in the
[1:06:10] old testament
[1:06:12] there was a man named ahab a king
[1:06:16] and his wife jezebel
[1:06:19] and they had a convocation too
[1:06:22] first kings 18
[1:06:25] and the motivation for that convention
[1:06:30] or convocation
[1:06:32] was to eradicate the name of jehovah
[1:06:35] from within the land of israel
[1:06:38] you want to get rid of the name of
[1:06:39] jehovah and as we are here today i want
[1:06:43] you to know they want to get rid of us
[1:06:45] talking about the name of jesus christ
[1:06:49] i was invited
[1:06:52] the very prestigious
[1:06:55] uh prayer breakfast
[1:06:58] where ministers of different faiths
[1:07:02] would say a few words
[1:07:04] will be a little prayer prayer
[1:07:07] and when it was made clear to me
[1:07:11] by those who would organize this
[1:07:13] when you pray
[1:07:15] don't call any name
[1:07:18] just use the generic term god well god
[1:07:21] just means object of worship which god
[1:07:24] so don't mention the name of jesus just
[1:07:28] pray you're supposed to pray in a lofty
[1:07:30] dignified religious way but don't
[1:07:33] mention the name of jesus just say god
[1:07:36] and i absolutely refused and rejected it
[1:07:40] this great meeting
[1:07:42] of
[1:07:43] all the high in the mighty uh so-called
[1:07:46] my friends i turned it down and walked
[1:07:49] away from it because at the name of
[1:07:52] jesus every knee shall bow and every
[1:07:56] tongue shall confess that jesus christ
[1:07:59] is lord amen i know some would have been
[1:08:02] tempted and give in to that just for the
[1:08:05] exposure
[1:08:06] and the recognition to be in such an
[1:08:09] august crowd but no we are not called to
[1:08:13] cut corners we are called to stand for
[1:08:16] jesus and he will stand for you when you
[1:08:19] stand by the word of the living god
[1:08:22] there were absolutely
[1:08:25] having this convention this convocation
[1:08:29] for the purpose
[1:08:31] of eradicating the name of jehovah
[1:08:34] within the land of israel
[1:08:37] they were anti-jehovah
[1:08:40] and they wanted to get rid and cleanse
[1:08:42] the land
[1:08:44] of the teachings and prophecies
[1:08:47] of this so-called elijah
[1:08:50] that that cursed old harlot jezebel and
[1:08:54] her daughters
[1:08:56] brought the saint the lord god of israel
[1:08:59] against them
[1:09:00] and spoke the word amen and she haunted
[1:09:04] him to get a hold of his life
[1:09:08] oh as as such
[1:09:09] oh
[1:09:10] but they called
[1:09:12] because they wanted to immerse the
[1:09:14] people
[1:09:16] into this kind of
[1:09:18] anti-elijah
[1:09:21] anti-present-day
[1:09:23] william branham
[1:09:25] who was god's and his gods
[1:09:28] elijah for this age for god's glory and
[1:09:32] honor
[1:09:33] the one who called conventions
[1:09:36] and convocations
[1:09:38] to be raped
[1:09:39] to to
[1:09:41] come against
[1:09:42] his name his message
[1:09:45] the voice of god who spoke through him
[1:09:48] to be anti-elijah
[1:09:50] an
[1:09:51] anti-word
[1:09:53] anti-his doctrine and teaching is
[1:09:56] nothing less than the word of god and
[1:10:00] thus saith the lord hallelujah oh my yes
[1:10:05] they were against elijah's prophecies
[1:10:08] and for this convention
[1:10:10] was not going to be an ordinary one
[1:10:13] for this convention she brought
[1:10:16] their
[1:10:18] 450 prophets of baal
[1:10:21] well-trained men schooled in all manner
[1:10:25] of doctrine and teachings
[1:10:28] of their false god trinitarian god
[1:10:32] and along with those 450
[1:10:36] were 400 prophets
[1:10:39] of the groves
[1:10:41] and they're at from jezebel's table and
[1:10:44] they came to this great convention this
[1:10:47] great convocation and the motivation to
[1:10:50] repeat was all was motivated to the
[1:10:55] destruction of elijah and his message
[1:10:59] but thank god elijah met them up in
[1:11:03] chicago
[1:11:05] elijah in the bible met them on mount
[1:11:09] carmel and you can read in your bible
[1:11:12] first kings 18
[1:11:15] how they jumped their carry on a petty
[1:11:18] crosstalk meeting like you've never seen
[1:11:21] jumping around and dancing and screaming
[1:11:25] and calling
[1:11:26] and in the bible said they even cut
[1:11:29] themselves some of them have oil and
[1:11:31] blood coming out of them trying to bring
[1:11:34] the genuine god on the scene or my
[1:11:38] friends and when it came towards evening
[1:11:41] hallelujah
[1:11:43] at the time of the evening sacrifice
[1:11:46] elijah got them to put all the bullock
[1:11:51] and the wood on the altar playset he
[1:11:54] plays it praise god and then he turn and
[1:11:57] tell him look you can pour cold water
[1:11:59] you can criticize you can say whatever
[1:12:01] you want uh my job is done you can even
[1:12:05] get rid of the messenger but you will
[1:12:08] never get rid of this message of the
[1:12:10] spoken word of malachi 4 5 revelation 10
[1:12:15] 1-7 luke 70. you cannot get rid of it
[1:12:19] because it's the word of god it will not
[1:12:22] die but it will live on and on and his
[1:12:26] word shall not return unto him void for
[1:12:29] it's thus saith the lord god hallelujah
[1:12:32] of hosts amen praise god yes sir and
[1:12:37] elijah just simply prayed and asked god
[1:12:40] to answer by fire
[1:12:42] and the great pillar of fire came down
[1:12:45] and burnt up the sacrifice god will
[1:12:48] always vindicate this message
[1:12:51] god will always vindicate his word
[1:12:55] he'll vindicate the prophecies
[1:12:59] of elijah
[1:13:01] the prophet in the bible
[1:13:03] and the elijah of this day that he has
[1:13:07] sent according to his word many do not
[1:13:10] recognize it yet
[1:13:13] but he himself has said
[1:13:15] after i'm gone
[1:13:18] they're going to start realizing that a
[1:13:20] lot of the things i've said
[1:13:22] and done
[1:13:24] with the word of god
[1:13:26] and they're going to begin to ask you
[1:13:28] about it
[1:13:30] oh they're going to want to know about
[1:13:32] it
[1:13:33] too late
[1:13:35] the door is closed
[1:13:37] the bridegroom has come
[1:13:39] and they
[1:13:40] all the wise have been shutting with god
[1:13:44] and he's speaking and whispering to them
[1:13:47] the secret things within the word of god
[1:13:51] and you're wondering to know
[1:13:53] where they hear that where they got that
[1:13:56] where is that where do i find that where
[1:13:58] can i you can't educate yourself into
[1:14:01] this you cannot this cannot be
[1:14:04] impersonated it's only revelated it's
[1:14:07] only given by god himself for his glory
[1:14:10] and honor blessed be the name of the
[1:14:12] lord yes sir
[1:14:14] ahab had a convention another
[1:14:17] convocation
[1:14:20] and he had this convocation
[1:14:23] at the gates of samaria
[1:14:25] along with king jehoshaphat
[1:14:29] and the motivation
[1:14:31] for that one
[1:14:33] listen close
[1:14:34] was to convince jehoshaphat
[1:14:38] to join with him
[1:14:40] or to unite with him
[1:14:42] to go to war
[1:14:43] but the emphasis i'm putting here is to
[1:14:46] unite
[1:14:47] to join with him
[1:14:50] so that they can fight against the
[1:14:52] common enemy
[1:14:54] you see that points to how
[1:14:58] they will do everything
[1:15:00] to try to get the elect
[1:15:03] to unite
[1:15:05] or cooperate
[1:15:07] or join with them
[1:15:10] yes
[1:15:11] that they might go
[1:15:13] against the unbelieving
[1:15:15] oh lord have mercy but thank god
[1:15:19] that god had a micaiah
[1:15:22] in that day and take god he has my kaya
[1:15:27] spirit anointing many
[1:15:30] in this day and in this hour that will
[1:15:33] stand by the word of god what did ma
[1:15:36] maikai
[1:15:39] stood by the prophecies of elijah
[1:15:42] i can say nothing different
[1:15:45] than what elijah has already prophesied
[1:15:48] how the dogs will lick your bow your
[1:15:51] bones
[1:15:52] amen
[1:15:53] how the how that
[1:15:55] uahab and you you are not going to have
[1:15:59] any victory whatsoever and then he told
[1:16:02] this great vision and everything else
[1:16:04] that god has given to him
[1:16:07] and then they threw him into jail as
[1:16:09] their will
[1:16:11] with many of you who truly see
[1:16:14] recognize
[1:16:15] and believe
[1:16:16] not have enough fiction or a fantasy or
[1:16:19] some religious delusion in your heart oh
[1:16:23] or some enchantment or you're charmed by
[1:16:26] this because it sounds nice and
[1:16:28] religious but because you caught
[1:16:31] something at the root of your being amen
[1:16:35] oh praise god forevermore hallelujah
[1:16:38] they're going to literally put some of
[1:16:41] you into jail
[1:16:43] amen hallelujah but the word of the lord
[1:16:46] will still come to pass amen i want to
[1:16:50] tell you this world consular churches
[1:16:55] this ecumenism
[1:16:57] that they're calling
[1:16:59] and trying to envel
[1:17:03] many of the elected into
[1:17:05] by telling them yeah we can give you
[1:17:08] your papers we can give you your
[1:17:10] registrations we can give you
[1:17:12] recognition we can lift you up in the
[1:17:15] eyes of the public we can empower you
[1:17:18] with this and empower you with that oh
[1:17:20] my friends let me tell you friends that
[1:17:24] many will stand with the spirit of
[1:17:26] micriah with the message of elijah and
[1:17:29] come against that spirit and stand with
[1:17:32] the word of the living god i want you to
[1:17:35] know there's a coming mystery babylon
[1:17:38] convocation

[1:17:46] a wicked convocation
[1:17:48] a one world church
[1:17:51] of ecumenism
[1:17:53] trying to merge everything else
[1:17:56] into one great church union
[1:17:59] and they try to pull
[1:18:01] even those who claim to be the elect
[1:18:04] into the influence
[1:18:06] on to bring them under his serpent spell
[1:18:11] of evil

[1:18:14] and tell you my friends even though
[1:18:17] this great combine of religion
[1:18:22] might
[1:18:23] be

[1:18:30] jesus's prayer that they all may be one
[1:18:34] as we are one
[1:18:36] my friends i want you to know it's evil
[1:18:40] for that is the wrong way
