[1:26] they send their greetings to everybody
[1:28] amen praise God forever more and so
[1:33] we're here once again the last time we
[1:36] were here was um a couple weeks ago and
[1:41] we were right in the midst of um the
[1:44] elections in the
[1:45] US and um you know I recall when I was
[1:50] studying for for the message that
[1:53] weekend when I came across that
[1:55] scripture as I mentioned to you in
[1:57] Corinthians 15
[2:00] where when I read the last trump it just
[2:03] kind of like jumped out at me and I told
[2:06] you that I said but then I thought my
[2:08] mind I said but Lord how in the world
[2:11] could they ever put a man like
[2:13] that on the
[2:16] throne here in America and and then you
[2:20] know the the prophecy brother braham's
[2:22] prophecy but you know I was with my
[2:25] partner Frank a lot and you know we'd be
[2:28] constantly talking about this and he
[2:30] says it's not going to be Hillary and he
[2:33] just kept saying that and he just
[2:34] believed that and he just he says she's
[2:37] too awesome
[2:39] she's this is Brother Brown says it's
[2:41] going to be beautiful and there's
[2:43] nothing you know there's not so much
[2:45] Beauty in her and stuff like that and
[2:47] this is what he was saying you know and
[2:49] uh you know and then he'd bring up every
[2:51] time you know the times where brother
[2:52] Bram spoke about it and if you actually
[2:54] look at all of the quotes of brother
[2:57] Brown speaking about this woman that's
[3:00] going to come into great power you'll
[3:02] not see that it says clearly or thus
[3:06] sayith the Lord she's going to be the
[3:07] Pres amen does not say
[3:10] that but it says that she'll come into
[3:13] some kind of a dictatorship or a great
[3:16] powerful woman in
[3:18] America she was the most powerful woman
[3:20] in America over the last year you know
[3:23] that right she stood in that position
[3:25] she stood in that office and she
[3:28] actually you know was was revered by by
[3:31] the Democratic movement and by that
[3:33] liberal movement and by the women's you
[3:35] know uh Liberation and everything else
[3:38] and took the Pinnacle of women power to
[3:42] such a level that you would wonder my
[3:45] goodness this is amazing and that's why
[3:48] there was so many women that were
[3:50] disappointed and and you know women
[3:52] having to explain to their daughters and
[3:54] you know I heard so much on the on the
[3:56] news and you know on the radio about all
[3:59] of this in the in the newspapers about
[4:01] how you know women had to wake up and
[4:03] tell their daughters they emphasized on
[4:06] these things you know how you know that
[4:08] it wasn't it just you know wasn't the
[4:10] time yet and you know but they were
[4:12] looking at this as a great moment for
[4:15] America that a woman would would
[4:18] escalate to the highest office in
[4:20] America
[4:22] imagine but yet you
[4:24] know we saw God's interpretation this
[4:29] week right right because all I could do
[4:32] when when that when that happened and I
[4:34] was watching it happen and I just I was
[4:37] watching the election results and I was
[4:39] seeing how it was on I can just imagine
[4:41] a lot of you know Believers worldwide
[4:44] imagine there's going to be a greater
[4:45] Falling Away
[4:47] now you know because they were probably
[4:51] wondering what in the world is going on
[4:53] so many of them went out on the on the
[4:55] limb and you know and said this is going
[4:57] to be the Fulfillment of that prophecy
[5:00] and and and this and that you know and
[5:02] and then even when I when I explained
[5:04] this to to a brother and I said you know
[5:06] when I when when I was reading that
[5:08] scripture and that came out to me so
[5:10] strong and and I know the inspiration
[5:12] that I caught off of it but then there's
[5:14] that natural right remember there's a
[5:16] spiritual and the natural and I caught
[5:18] the inspiration of the last trunk being
[5:21] that this bride is going to receive
[5:23] Faith that's going to actually change
[5:25] her at at a moment there's going to be
[5:28] the last Trump and it's going to be a
[5:30] faith that's going to be Beyond human
[5:33] Faith human understanding you can't put
[5:35] any interpretation on it all I can tell
[5:37] you is that it's going to be a
[5:38] revelation and it'll be the last
[5:41] Revelation you receive as a mortal human
[5:44] being before you are changed and that
[5:47] revelation will change you it's that
[5:50] simple and so you know I said and I said
[5:53] you know and so he turns he says well
[5:55] what are you saying brother are you
[5:56] saying that Trump's going to be the
[5:58] president I said no I'm not saying that
[6:01] I can't even
[6:03] imagine I just I just you know in my
[6:06] mind I just couldn't make it
[6:07] fit but then after it happened then you
[6:13] start seeking the Lord and you start
[6:15] wondering and you start looking and and
[6:17] saying well Lord and all I could say was
[6:21] he was your
[6:23] choice he was your
[6:27] choice let's get to the message
[6:31] today I want to talk about the last
[6:33] Trump part two and I want to look at
[6:36] what's happened I want to look at what
[6:39] it all means and really how do we fit
[6:43] into the whole thing because that's
[6:45] what's important to me and to you right
[6:50] whether anyway let's get into the
[6:53] message praise God let's open our Bibles
[6:56] to 1 Corinthians
[7:02] chapter
[7:07] 15 I don't want to get ahead
[7:11] [Music]
[7:12] here we've got a bit of a PowerPoint
[7:16] presentation that we'll be putting up
[7:18] just I'll let you know when um when you
[7:20] can put up actually go ahead and put up
[7:23] the first slide
[7:34] amen let's pray
[7:36] father what a time and what a season for
[7:39] the Sons and Daughters of God lord we
[7:43] have gone through
[7:46] quite a year I know there was great
[7:50] expectation in the hearts of the
[7:51] Believers and father there was so much
[7:54] excitement Lord through these uh
[7:57] elections in the USA father the modern
[8:00] Sodom and Gomorrah Lord we saw so many
[8:05] uh prophecies and so many uh
[8:09] uh manifestations of your word in so
[8:13] many ways father a a a country a land a
[8:16] nation that is completely Fallen apart
[8:19] but yet Lord these are prophetic
[8:22] scriptures these are prophetic events
[8:25] that we have witnessed with our own eyes
[8:27] and in our time and in our season but
[8:29] yet we are the ones Lord that have been
[8:31] given the ability to recognize the word
[8:34] of God and how it pertains to our day
[8:38] and the hour that we're living in and
[8:40] that's what we are gathered here this
[8:41] morning to do father is to be inspired
[8:45] by you father through speaker through
[8:47] hearer Lord that we might catch the
[8:50] faith and and the present truth father
[8:53] what it is that we need the inspiration
[8:56] that's going to give us the Courage the
[8:58] confidence and the ability to to to
[9:01] fulfill our part and the purpose why you
[9:04] called each and every one of us and so
[9:07] for that we come together this morning
[9:10] with great expectation and we ask that
[9:12] your anointing would come and move and
[9:14] bind every Power every demonic power
[9:18] that would try to hinder or or uh uh try
[9:21] to hold back in any way shape or form
[9:24] what it is that you would accomplish
[9:25] this morning but that would that change
[9:28] would be broken eyes would be opened the
[9:31] dead would be raised up father and Lord
[9:34] if there's healing required let there be
[9:36] healing in our midst father we thank you
[9:39] for it we give you the praise we give
[9:40] you the glory for it and we look to thee

[9:56] bless you Saints in Corinthians chapter
[10:01] 15 verse
[10:05] 51 it
[10:07] says
[10:09] behold I show you a mystery we shall not
[10:14] all
[10:15] sleep but we shall all be
[10:19] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[10:23] an eye at the last
[10:26] Trump for the trumpet shall sound and
[10:29] the dead in Christ be raised
[10:32] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[10:37] amen may the Lord add His blessings to
[10:40] the word of God you may be
[10:42] seated
[10:44] amen praise
[10:46] God so we're looking here at the trumpet
[10:51] of God we know that God never does
[10:54] anything L he first reveals it unto his
[10:57] servants the prophets
[10:59] and then once the word has gone forth
[11:03] then there is a trumpet call which calls
[11:06] the children of Israel to the feast to
[11:09] the call to what it is that God is
[11:12] accomplishing what God is doing in that
[11:15] present day in that present hour amen
[11:19] praise God and so next slide we know
[11:24] that this is the hour where there's
[11:27] something that's going to sweep the land
[11:30] for the Christians for the sons and the
[11:32] daughters of God and it is going to be a
[11:34] faith that is going to change our bodies
[11:38] we don't need to know how it's going to
[11:40] happen we don't need to be scientific
[11:44] about the whole situation and how the
[11:47] event is actually going to be and how
[11:49] we're going to be you know changed into
[11:51] white gowns and all of a sudden we're
[11:52] going to be floating up into the air
[11:54] like some people want to interpret it
[11:57] that's not that's not important to me
[12:00] all that's important is that I that you
[12:03] know that it's going to happen so quick
[12:05] in the twinkling of an eye I was
[12:07] explaining it to one of my children
[12:08] yesterday and I was saying you see how
[12:10] you just blinked that's how quick it's
[12:13] going to happen that's how quick it's
[12:15] going to happen and God is doing it and
[12:19] and it's not going to be a matter of you
[12:20] know that we got to work something up in
[12:23] order for it to happen no it's got to
[12:25] come into God's time and God's season
[12:28] and when does the faith is going to come
[12:31] into the fivefold ministry and she's
[12:34] going to begin to to to minister that
[12:36] word in such a way that it's just going
[12:39] to it's going to have an effect on the
[12:41] bride it's going to bring her into more
[12:43] clarity of what it is that God is doing
[12:45] in her day amen now last weekend last
[12:49] Sunday we had an experience of what it
[12:52] is to be to be evangelized amen glory to
[12:56] God by the word of God by a servant of
[12:58] God
[12:59] by an evangelist by the five-fold
[13:01] ministry you witnessed an evangelist you
[13:04] heard him Minister the word of God in
[13:07] such a way that there was fire moving
[13:10] through the house there was inspiration
[13:13] moving through the hearts of the people
[13:15] there was there was demon powers being
[13:18] cast out of the people there was chains
[13:20] being broken he says listen I'm not like
[13:23] your pastor I'm not like your pastor
[13:25] where I can hold back and I got to be
[13:26] emotionally attached to your situations
[13:29] and you're you're I'm not concerned with
[13:32] that I'm I'm not built that way see he
[13:35] had perfect Faith he had a revelation of
[13:37] who he was the part that he was playing
[13:40] and God was pleased with that and God
[13:43] came down and anointed what he was
[13:45] speaking and that word had an effect on
[13:49] you don't tell me it didn't have an
[13:51] effect on you if it didn't have an
[13:54] effect on you you better get back on
[13:56] your
[13:56] knees because that fire burn burned
[13:59] around me for days amen it's still
[14:02] burning because it is the fire of God it
[14:05] is the way God is taking this bride and
[14:08] changing each and every one of us
[14:11] changing us from from from Glory unto
[14:14] Glory removing all those character flaws
[14:19] Amen to
[14:20] God the one thing that you will not take
[14:23] from here okay is all of your
[14:27] money all of your pride all your all of
[14:30] your Acquisitions you're not going to
[14:31] take any of that with
[14:33] you none of it some people they get into
[14:37] this concept into their minds that
[14:39] they're going to that they're going to
[14:40] be able to show God that they did
[14:43] something good by showing how much they
[14:45] could give or how much they could
[14:50] build that's not what it is without
[14:53] faith it's impossible to receive the
[14:56] change it's just that simple it's it's
[14:59] not going to be a matter of your ability
[15:00] or my ability or anybody's ability it's
[15:03] going to be the word in its
[15:06] season the word in its season and when
[15:09] you catch that word in your season it's
[15:13] going to cause you to manifest life the
[15:17] life of the word amen that's the
[15:20] interpretation of the Holy Ghost brother
[15:23] Bram says the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[15:24] is your ability to recognize the word
[15:27] receive it and live it
[15:31] amen so in a moment in the twinkling of
[15:36] an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet
[15:39] shall sound and the dead shall be raised
[15:43] Incorruptible now the very next thing
[15:46] that you're going to
[15:47] see when that Trump strikes your soul
[15:51] and you are changed in a twinkling of an
[15:54] eye you're going to see the Saints of
[15:56] old prise Lord that'll be the very next
[15:59] thing that you are going to see because
[16:01] the scripture is very clear that the
[16:03] dead shall be raised
[16:06] Incorruptible and it's just that simple
[16:08] so we can be under the right
[16:11] expectation of what it is that we expect
[16:13] to
[16:14] happen and just like when Jesus in the
[16:18] first
[16:19] resurrection when the when he came back
[16:21] from hell with those Saints because he
[16:25] went down to preach to the souls that
[16:27] were in prison but with him came the the
[16:30] the the Saints of old amen glory to God
[16:34] and that's just a very uh exact type of
[16:37] how it is that we are going to witness
[16:39] and see this change and this next event
[16:42] that's going to happen because Jesus is
[16:45] going to go get them first the dead in
[16:47] Christ shall rise first and just like
[16:49] the apostles and the disciples back in
[16:52] the days of Jesus they witnessed
[16:55] those Saints in Jerusalem
[16:59] they witnessed them they saw these
[17:01] events taking place Jesus had told them
[17:04] about you know there was going to be
[17:06] this time this season just like we've
[17:08] been told so we get under the same
[17:11] expectation to know what it is that's
[17:13] going to happen here in this Dimension
[17:16] right now in the season that we're
[17:18] living in and how it is that it's all
[17:19] going to come about amen puts us under
[17:22] the r the the the right expectation very
[17:26] important Saints because you can get all
[17:29] caught up with what's going on in the
[17:32] states and you could be one of those
[17:34] that are so disappointed oh I don't know
[17:36] brother gram said that you know it was
[17:39] supposed to be a woman president I mean
[17:41] how close can it get I don't know you
[17:45] know I don't know about this now I'm
[17:48] wondering what's going on here I wonder
[17:51] you know these guys that are that are
[17:53] you know claiming brother Brandon to be
[17:55] a false
[17:57] Pro I wonder I wonder I wonder I wonder
[18:01] you know why cuz they're wandering
[18:04] Stars they aren't anchored by
[18:07] revelation God does not make any
[18:12] mistakes that's why as soon as it had
[18:14] happened as soon as I seen it I all I
[18:17] could say what all I could say was this
[18:20] was your choice Lord how does it how
[18:23] does it pertain to me now where do I fit
[18:26] into this now how do I move on because
[18:29] you don't make mistakes you don't do
[18:31] anything that is out of cater according
[18:35] to your plan and that's one thing you
[18:37] need to get into your heads right you
[18:39] need to get that stubborn thing about oh
[18:42] I want to be right you don't need to be
[18:45] right you don't need to be right there's
[18:47] no there's no need to be right there
[18:49] this is the hour where God you know God
[18:51] has always been his own interpreter
[18:54] amen so why all of a sudden you want to
[18:56] be his interpreter right why does
[18:59] everybody out there want to be his
[19:01] interpreter I'm not here to be an
[19:03] interpreter like I said to you when when
[19:06] I study the scriptures and I look to the
[19:07] word of God I wait for inspiration to
[19:10] strike my soul and then I just go and
[19:12] just whatever God lays on my heart
[19:14] that's what God that's what I that's
[19:16] what I give to the people that's all I
[19:18] can give because I know that I got
[19:20] nothing I know that I don't I cannot you
[19:24] know come up with my own ideas and my
[19:26] own interpretation on the word of God
[19:28] God is his own interpreter God sends the
[19:31] power of the Rema life into the vessel
[19:34] God sends that anointing onto a certain
[19:37] situation and he brings it to pass
[19:40] exactly the way he prophesied it like
[19:43] you know he said a virgin shall conceive
[19:45] he said that hundreds of years before
[19:48] through Isaiah and my god when that day
[19:51] come when that angel come down and stood
[19:54] before Mary and said blessed art thou
[19:57] amongst all women
[19:59] thank you that was the
[20:02] life
[20:04] word Rema power love anointing of God
[20:09] coming upon that
[20:11] individual and she right there
[20:14] manifested a seed in her womb and all
[20:16] she could say because she was under that
[20:19] Supernatural anointing that light that
[20:22] was all over her she could not deny it
[20:25] one of these Morning Saints that light
[20:27] is going to light around you that power
[20:29] is going to come upon you you're going
[20:31] to feel a love and anointing that you
[20:33] will
[20:35] not all you know that you will say be it
[20:38] unto me according to Thy word oh God
[20:41] Amen blessed be the name of the Lord you
[20:43] won't have to try and put an
[20:44] interpretation on that God will
[20:47] interpret it to the world Amen and
[20:49] that's what he's doing in this hour
[20:51] don't let these events get you all out a
[20:54] cater next slide please
[20:59] recently we know that
[21:02] God always shows signs in the
[21:05] heavens before they are declared on the
[21:08] earth and we know that brother BR said
[21:11] that if you want to know what time it is
[21:14] he says watch
[21:15] Israel we've heard that over and over
[21:18] and over again you need to hear it
[21:21] again Watch Israel watch what's going on
[21:24] in Israel recognize that whatever God is
[21:28] doing
[21:29] God is showing in the heavens and in a
[21:32] nation which was his chosen people and
[21:36] just recently and you know I never knew
[21:39] about this it was brother Desmond that
[21:41] brought it to my
[21:42] attention after I ministered there a
[21:45] couple of weeks ago he sent me this
[21:48] video he says oh brother have you
[21:50] seen what's going on in Israel and what
[21:53] took place with the trumpets I said
[21:57] no so he showed it to me yeah and then I
[22:01] said wow and I looked into it and it
[22:05] happened right after the final feast in
[22:09] Israel because they've just gone through
[22:11] all of their
[22:12] feasts and the last Feast is the Feast
[22:14] of Tabernacles the one that
[22:17] calls the Saints to that final Feast the
[22:22] one that calls the chosen the elect of
[22:25] God to that final Feast to that that
[22:28] final meeting and so we know that
[22:31] trumpet
[22:33] sound is God's way of calling to an
[22:38] event that's what it is it's a calling
[22:41] to an event this event next slide took
[22:47] place on October the
[22:51] 1st and here you know we read in the
[22:54] scriptures then you shall cause the
[22:57] trumpet of Jubilee to sound on the 10th
[23:00] day of the seventh month on the day of
[23:03] atonement you shall make the trumpet to
[23:06] sound throughout all your
[23:09] land it's interesting you know we've
[23:12] seen that before on the 10th day the 7th
[23:14] month and we know what happened in
[23:16] Revelations 10: 7 when the mighty angel
[23:20] came down that was the time in the
[23:22] season for a change in dispens
[23:26] dispensation that was a major event on
[23:29] the earth Saints we're going to look a
[23:31] little bit more at that as we go into
[23:33] the message here next scripture Joel 2:1
[23:38] says blow the trumpet in Zion where is
[23:41] Zion Israel
[23:45] Jerusalem amongst my chosen
[23:47] people sound the alarm on my Holy Hill
[23:51] let all who live in the land tremble for
[23:55] the day of the Lord is coming
[23:59] it is close at hand amen this is a
[24:04] season this is a time we're trying to
[24:06] look at where we are and how it all fits
[24:08] together next
[24:11] scripture it's not a scripture actually
[24:14] it's a link and I'm going to ask Chris
[24:17] if he would just play that link because
[24:19] this is the actual somebody that you
[24:22] know recorded the
[24:24] event back on October the 1st
[24:42] it
[24:52] off you got a microphone up there
[24:59] [Music]
[25:19] tell
[25:28] [Music]
[25:52] amen this was a phenomena that took
[25:56] place back on October the 1st
[25:59] and you could hear the trumpet sound in
[26:01] the background and this has been
[26:03] happening in other times and seasons and
[26:08] but this being so close to this event
[26:11] and the time and the season that we're
[26:13] living in now does it mean that it is
[26:17] the final
[26:19] Trump does it mean that you know we're
[26:22] going in the Rapture in 30 days or 60
[26:26] I'm not giving you any kind of
[26:27] interpretation on but I'm letting you
[26:30] know of the things that are taking place
[26:33] that before God declares
[26:35] anything to the people he declares it in
[26:38] the heavens and you saw The Ring there
[26:40] like a trumpet like the end of a trumpet
[26:43] and you heard sound coming out of that
[26:45] and you know all the scientists would
[26:46] like to say well that's like a that's
[26:48] like a phenomena that takes place when
[26:50] certain atmospheric pressures move
[26:53] together and this happens yeah sure
[26:56] that's that's fine but who's the
[26:58] intelligence behind
[27:00] you there's an intelligence behind every
[27:04] event and
[27:07] every uh natural situation in the world
[27:10] and that that natural that that
[27:12] intelligence is God Amen it's that
[27:15] simple blessed be the name of the Lord
[27:18] and so you know these things are
[27:20] happening in the world and people are
[27:22] getting excited and imagine the children
[27:24] of Israel are getting excited to them
[27:26] you know the the conservative Jew and
[27:28] the rabbis they're they're looking at
[27:30] these events and they're saying
[27:32] something God is moving God is up to
[27:34] something the world is going through a
[27:36] dramatic change right now this is a
[27:39] world changing event amen next
[27:46] slide back in
[27:48] 2015 Donald Trump stood before a
[27:51] Christian
[27:52] organization with his
[27:55] Bible that was speaking to the Christian
[27:58] people and I don't know like you know
[28:00] this week I had a chance to I said you
[28:02] know what I got to I got to look into
[28:04] this guy I got to look into him I got to
[28:06] find out what's what you know and then
[28:08] you know I I I I came across some
[28:10] interviews where you know he was asked
[28:13] by a Christian minister by an
[28:14] organization saying uh Mr Trump have you
[28:18] ever asked God for forgiveness of your
[28:23] sins and he couldn't
[28:26] answer he couldn't answer it straight
[28:28] know
[28:29] wow you know i' I've looked at my life
[28:32] in such a way that you know I make
[28:34] mistakes and and then what I do to to
[28:36] you know I just I just my relationship
[28:38] with God is to make those things
[28:40] right but you know you know sure I made
[28:43] a mistakes and you know sure you know
[28:46] this and that but you know and all I
[28:48] could all I could see was that through
[28:52] every
[28:53] interview when it when it was with
[28:56] respect to Christianity
[28:58] and to the word of
[29:00] God we've been given the ability to
[29:03] discern the Lord's body amen and to
[29:06] recognize don't ever
[29:09] underestimate your faith in Christianity
[29:13] the faith that you got according to
[29:15] Christianity because
[29:18] 99% of the Christian world out
[29:21] there has an
[29:24] interpretation but they have not
[29:26] recognized what God has done in this day
[29:29] amen your ability to recognize what God
[29:32] is doing now just like when Jesus was on
[29:36] the earth remember when Jesus was on the
[29:39] earth there was only a handful a couple
[29:42] of handfuls that actually recognized
[29:44] that he was the word made flesh the rest
[29:48] of the world wanted to crucify him they
[29:53] didn't recognize the word because the
[29:56] word was clear all even the priests of
[29:59] that day they could not recognize the
[30:02] Fulfillment of scripture where he would
[30:04] you know where behold your king he comes
[30:07] riding into Jerusalem on the full on the
[30:09] ass of a mule they couldn't recognize
[30:12] that that was the Fulfillment of all the
[30:15] scriptures of the Old Testament saying
[30:17] that he was coming he was coming he's
[30:19] coming he's coming and they fail to
[30:22] recognize and they would always get
[30:24] caught up in the day that they were
[30:26] living in and looking at the leadership
[30:29] of the day that they were looking that
[30:31] they were living in don't miss this they
[30:34] were looking at the leadership of the
[30:37] countries and the Kings and all the
[30:40] great leaders and they were looking to
[30:42] them for an
[30:44] interpretation they go look into the
[30:47] pope a man for an
[30:50] interpretation they go look into to
[30:52] their priest or to their to their uh
[30:54] Pastor or or no that's not the Jesus
[30:58] Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll build my
[31:01] church and what he meant by that was
[31:03] that when he spoke to Peter and he asked
[31:05] him personally who do you say that I am
[31:09] never mind what your papa your mama your
[31:12] pastor your preacher or your Rabbi says
[31:15] I want to know who you say that I am and
[31:18] Peter caught a revelation you Thou Art
[31:21] the Christ the son of the Living God you
[31:24] are the word made flesh you are the
[31:27] Messiah you're the you're the one that
[31:29] we're supposed to follow and Jesus
[31:32] turning says flesh and blood has not
[31:34] revealed this to you you were not taught
[31:36] it by by some teacher by by your
[31:40] Traditions that's not how you receive
[31:43] Christ in this day and in this hour the
[31:45] way to receive Christ is according to
[31:47] his word amen he says repent and be
[31:51] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[31:54] Christ for the remission of your sins
[31:56] you shall receive receive the gift of
[31:59] the Holy Spirit which the Holy Spirit
[32:01] Jesus said would lead you into all
[32:06] truth I'm just trying to keep it simple
[32:09] we need to be reminded of these things
[32:11] and so we don't look at what the world
[32:15] interpretation is we look at what the
[32:17] word interpretation is because that is
[32:21] what you are going to be judged by on
[32:23] that day if you are not a son or
[32:26] daughter of God because the Sons and
[32:28] Daughters of God they go in the Rapture
[32:30] amen your judgment the sons and
[32:32] daughters the Judgment for them is right
[32:34] now they're being judged every day by
[32:36] their life by their character by their
[32:38] by their own conscience by the way that
[32:40] they live by trying to get their lives
[32:42] right with Christ amen amen because this
[32:45] flesh is not your friend it's your enemy
[32:49] it wants to do things like Paul said the
[32:51] things that I shouldn't do I do the
[32:53] things that I should do I don't do you
[32:56] will struggle with that the Bible says
[32:58] that the carnal mind is at enity with
[33:01] God Amen bless the Lord and so a lot of
[33:06] people Christians started to look at
[33:09] this Trump and say wait a
[33:12] minute he's God
[33:15] said he's he's he's the man that God has
[33:18] chosen to lead
[33:20] America this is our way of getting back
[33:23] our
[33:24] heritage next slide
[33:28] Christians have been pointing to the
[33:30] book of Isaiah comparing
[33:34] Trump and
[33:36] saying Cyrus the next
[33:39] scripture Cyrus who was whose name was
[33:43] pronounced Kesh in Hebrew became King of
[33:46] Persia in 559 BC and conquered Babylon
[33:50] in 539 BC he is mentioned in the
[33:53] Majestic passage in Isaiah where the
[33:55] Lord says Cyrus he is Shepherd now you
[33:58] got to realize Cyrus was a
[34:00] pagan he was not one of the Kings of
[34:05] Israel he is my shepherd and he shall
[34:08] fulfill all my purpose saying of
[34:10] Jerusalem she shall be built and and of
[34:13] the temple your foundation shall be laid
[34:16] could Donald Trump then be a modern-day
[34:19] Cyrus and I looked at this because you
[34:21] know these are some of the you know the
[34:24] arguments of Christianity today and
[34:26] they're trying to find where it is that
[34:27] he could possibly fit into the word of
[34:30] God and be God's
[34:33] chosen now remember what I said at the
[34:35] beginning God has a plan and God's will
[34:40] will be done he rose up individuals that
[34:44] were not Sons and Daughters of God they
[34:48] were pharaohs they were they had a
[34:50] purpose God hardened their hearts for a
[34:53] purpose God used many in the scriptures
[34:55] that did not they were only used in
[34:58] order to move Israel into her position
[35:01] move the Sons and Daughters of God into
[35:04] their position God has a way of applying
[35:07] the word of God in our day and we've got
[35:09] to be able to recognize the scripture
[35:12] and the prophecy that's being fulfilled
[35:14] and to see where we fit
[35:17] in and so what's
[35:20] clear though is that God did not raise
[35:24] up an idol worshiping King to rule the
[35:27] nation of isra
[35:28] that would have been a curse rather than
[35:30] a blessing so when we look at at Cyrus
[35:33] as being like uh someone that that that
[35:36] God would raise up to be king over
[35:39] Israel that wouldn't line up and so to
[35:42] say that that Donald Trump has been
[35:45] raised up to be king Over America over
[35:49] the Christian people of America because
[35:52] that's what they're doing they're taking
[35:54] him and saying this is this is how God
[35:56] is going to deliver us this is how God
[35:59] is going to deliver
[36:01] [Music]
[36:03] America before I even looked into
[36:06] this before I even looked into this to
[36:09] see what Christianity was saying this
[36:12] week earlier in the week and I was
[36:14] saying God he's your
[36:15] choice he's your choice he was your
[36:18] choice in this election regardless of
[36:21] how we look at it because nothing you
[36:23] are God you you you create the wealthy
[36:26] the you you place Kings you do you are
[36:29] God it's that Ser I don't have to argue
[36:32] or try to find some excuse or some way
[36:35] to justify what it is that's taking
[36:37] place he's God he's done it that's it
[36:41] that settles
[36:42] it but what came into my thoughts and
[36:45] into my heart
[36:46] was did I not raise up a
[36:50] pharaoh did I not
[36:53] use a
[36:56] Nebuchadnezzar to
[36:58] come and there was a Jeremiah in the
[37:01] land at that time and he was the only
[37:04] one that had the truth he was the only
[37:07] one that had thus sayth the Lord that
[37:09] recognized you go back and read and you
[37:12] know read about Jeremiah in the time
[37:14] when Nebuchadnezzar came in and wiped
[37:16] out
[37:18] Jerusalem Nebuchadnezzar even he even he
[37:21] even like you know he he he even like uh
[37:23] was bragging how God you're God he went
[37:26] to Jeremiah say you're God is given me
[37:30] this
[37:32] imagine so can God raise up a
[37:36] Nebuchadnezzar because if you look back
[37:38] at that year and at that time you will
[37:42] recognize that Israel was in a fallen
[37:47] condition she was totally backslid from
[37:51] God the leadership was absolutely
[37:54] totally corrupt
[37:57] come all the king every every part of
[38:00] the Kingdom from the King down to his
[38:03] Down To His
[38:06] prophets even down to His prophets those
[38:08] that he he he would look to for counsel
[38:12] and here we have witnessed in our day an
[38:15] America that is so corrupt in its in its
[38:18] political
[38:21] correctness that they've made this word
[38:24] of God of none effect to the people
[38:27] where the people will look to political
[38:29] correctness instead of looking to the
[38:31] word of God
[38:33] Amen so God can raise up a
[38:36] Nebuchadnezzar God can raise up
[38:38] somebody because I want you to note that
[38:42] the
[38:43] prophecy for America according to the
[38:47] Revelation that we have received through
[38:49] a prophet of Malachi 45 William maryi
[38:52] and Brenham does not talk about an
[38:56] America that's going to be rebuilt up
[38:58] like Cyrus
[38:59] did
[39:02] on that's not the season that we're
[39:04] living in we need to recognize the they
[39:07] were're in and to see what the word of
[39:09] God says what the prophecy says about
[39:12] America now these are not our own
[39:15] interpretations Saints this is in the
[39:17] word of God you can find it in the Book
[39:20] of Revelation what it says about America
[39:23] the 13th chapter of Revelations 13
[39:26] stripes States 13 13 she's the number of
[39:30] 13 there's nothing really too good to
[39:34] look forward to in America I hate to be
[39:36] the bearer of this news but it's the
[39:40] prophecy of the word we are entering
[39:43] into perilous times we are entering into
[39:46] the final moments of time as we know it
[39:50] amen and so Israel has
[39:54] gotten America a type of Israel back
[39:58] there in the book of Jeremiah Was that
[40:00] they were completely gone from God they
[40:03] did not want to hear God's word they did
[40:07] they did not want to rule by God's word
[40:10] they wanted to rule by their own
[40:12] interpretation by their pride and by
[40:14] their by their their their their their
[40:17] their their standards and their liberal
[40:19] de Democratic uh teachings in the way
[40:23] that the world should be and the the
[40:25] future of of the nation and and the new
[40:27] New Age movement they want to move by
[40:30] their own interpretation but the word of
[40:32] God does not back that
[40:35] up next
[40:38] slide so he too was an idol
[40:42] worshipper there was another Ancient
[40:44] King named Nebuchadnezzar the Babylonian
[40:46] leader who decades before Cyrus became
[40:49] king led his armies to destroy Jerusalem
[40:52] burn down the temple and send the Jewish
[40:54] people into Exile in 58 6
[40:58] BC he too is an idol worshipper yet
[41:01] shockingly God called him my servant
[41:05] stating plainly behold I will send for
[41:08] all the tribes of the north declares the
[41:11] Lord and there's another one in the
[41:13] north that we've been told about the
[41:16] King of the North Russia oh yeah Russia
[41:21] and they're not exactly you know they
[41:23] were they they they wanted Trump
[41:26] [Music]
[41:27] the only reason they wanted Trump was
[41:29] because they just couldn't quite get a
[41:31] handle on this woman that's right they
[41:34] couldn't quite get a handle on her and
[41:35] they couldn't control her and and and
[41:38] the and the the the the the Democratic
[41:40] party and the and the power that was
[41:42] behind it but that P you know that party
[41:45] got smashed you know
[41:47] that they didn't expect what happened to
[41:51] them they were shocked just as much as
[41:54] 95% of the other people out there and
[41:57] you wonder well hang on a minute here if
[42:00] 95% of the people you talk to I talked
[42:02] to 10 people n nine of them say I
[42:06] thought it was going to be
[42:09] clean n out of 10 yeah but yet he
[42:14] wins not
[42:16] just not just the
[42:19] presidency the goop the Congress he's
[42:23] got he's got he's got like where his
[42:26] party basically in
[42:28] control they're basically in control and
[42:31] I can imagine that Democratic power
[42:33] that's that's been so strong that's been
[42:35] so you know because if you look into the
[42:37] Republican party and you look into their
[42:40] to their teachings and their history and
[42:41] their background they're very
[42:43] conservative they're like they're more
[42:44] like the farmer you know like the
[42:46] natural farmer that wants to just have
[42:48] things right they're like they're like
[42:50] yeah papa comes home Mama's got a meal
[42:52] ready for
[42:54] me not the Democrats honey you got my
[42:57] meal ready
[42:59] what cook your own meal you know I've
[43:02] been working all
[43:04] day quiet I'm
[43:09] busy just look into it you will
[43:13] see the Republicans they have that that
[43:16] old they're they're more they're more
[43:18] like go to church on
[43:20] Sunday not like the Democrats we I want
[43:23] to
[43:25] church Christmas
[43:30] Easter you know you look into it but God
[43:35] did something and I believe this is a a
[43:37] this is a very significant time Saints
[43:41] this is a a a historical
[43:44] event not only is it a historical event
[43:47] but when you look at Israel and you look
[43:49] at the blood wounds you look at the
[43:51] season you look at all the years the
[43:54] Year of Jubilee last year all of the
[43:57] things that have taken place in the time
[43:59] and the season that we're living in and
[44:02] these events line right up with it all
[44:04] and then you see an earth shattering
[44:07] this this was an earth shattering
[44:11] [Music]
[44:12] event it's only the
[44:14] beginning there was another earthquake
[44:17] this morning in in uh New Zealand 7.4 on
[44:21] the RoR scale there's there's birth
[44:23] pains taking place constantly Saints and
[44:27] this was one of the
[44:29] earthshaking events politically in the
[44:31] world where there's been a shift of
[44:33] power amen and I want you to know
[44:35] something it was God's will it's part of
[44:39] God's plan it's part of God's purpose
[44:42] and what he's doing in this day and in
[44:43] this hour and we don't need to be shaken
[44:47] we don't need to be uh uh you know Fall
[44:50] Fallen away because we we thought that
[44:52] it had to be exactly you know that
[44:54] brother BR said it be a woman president
[44:56] he did say that
[44:58] amen she might be read this read the go
[45:03] back and read all the quotes I went back
[45:05] and read them all and and and it's like
[45:07] in such a way God always does things in
[45:10] such a way that if you get too
[45:15] lck you know he's not looking for that
[45:18] he's looking for somebody that can catch
[45:20] inspiration that can recognize what his
[45:23] mind his thoughts his ways his will and
[45:26] desire for the for for for for the Sons
[45:28] and Daughters of God because remember
[45:30] things will be said and done in such a
[45:32] way that will take others away why
[45:36] because they were not of the scripture
[45:38] they're not of the kingdom of God
[45:40] they're not Sons and Daughters of God a
[45:43] lot of people say everybody's a son and
[45:45] daughter of God no amen if that was true
[45:48] then this word is a
[45:51] lie cuz that's not what the scripture
[45:53] says I can show you scriptures that talk
[45:57] both the sons of God and the the sons of
[46:01] that Wicked one the seed of God and the
[46:04] seed of that Wicked one God brought life
[46:09] everything exists by the life of God yes
[46:13] amen everything has an existence by the
[46:16] life of God because he is life amen but
[46:19] then there's those who were with God
[46:21] before the foundations of the world and
[46:24] those are the sons and daughters the
[46:26] attri rutes of God all God did was
[46:29] Express those attributes into a
[46:32] dimension called Earth and place them
[46:34] into Earthly vessels and use them for a
[46:37] time and a season so that when the time
[46:40] and season came just like now we are
[46:43] those Earth and vessels we are the ones
[46:45] that God is using right now to to to
[46:48] show what is the manifestation of the
[46:50] word of God we're not making ourselves
[46:52] special I want to make that clear here
[46:55] cuz a lot of people might think oh what
[46:57] you think you're better than anybody
[46:58] else no no better than anybody
[47:02] else I could tell you about my
[47:05] past it was ugly you a lot of you know
[47:08] about it but it's irrelevant God says my
[47:12] future is clear and that's why I Rejoice
[47:16] because he forgave me of my past he
[47:18] washed away my past he gave me an
[47:21] ability to recognize what he's doing in
[47:23] in his day in the day that we're living
[47:25] in right now my day and I can rejoice
[47:28] and only be thankful
