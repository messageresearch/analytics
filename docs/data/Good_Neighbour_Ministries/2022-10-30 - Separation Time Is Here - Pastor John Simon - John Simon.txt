to bring a simple message on separation Time Is Here separation Time Is Here praise the Lord may the Lord bless you we're going to read from Genesis chapter 28 verses 10 to 16. I will have a word of prayer and then we'll enter into the word of God our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you this morning for this great honor and privilege has become not in our strength but in your grace and Glory we pray you'll bless us everyone and most of all fill us with your spirit the spirit of wisdom and understanding that we might recognize you in this day of deception and evil take Glory and Honor we pray in Jesus name amen praise the name of the Lord and Jacob went out from Beersheba and went toward Herod and he lighted upon a certain place and carried there all night because the sun was set and he took off the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and laid down in that place to sleep and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached the heaven and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it and behold the Lord God stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the god of Isaac the land we are in our lies to thee will I give it and to thy seed amen praise the Lord and thy seed shall be as a dust in the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west to the east to the north to the South and in the and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed praise the Lord and behold I am with thee and will keep thee in all places without goeth and will bring thee again into this land for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee amen praise the Lord may God bless everyone today please be seated oh yes thank you sir praise God what a mighty God we serve amen we are living in great days we thank God that we are people who have come to this Earth with um Blessed Assurance already built in uh and we thank God for that that uh he did that so that our thoughts don't have to be filled with worry filled with fear doubt or anything else because even if you did nothing uh even if your heart condemned you you still have that Assurance you still you're still certain of God you're still able to know that you will make it through not by your will not by your mind not by the blood of man not by the will of man but by the purpose of God which he said I am going to see all that I have spoken will be done amen praise God of course coming to a present time we're living in difficult times we're living uh as Timothy said in perilous times uh we're living in chaotic times that we are in here today and the word in hearing recognizing acting on the word of God I'm just quoting now we are fully acquainted we people who search the scriptures day and night and read out of papers and hear the news commentators that the world is now standing in the grip of two great spiritual forces and there are both very religious forces you didn't think Satan was huh but but he is religious too right so the real the real test and the real um deception will be within the religious realm this is It's just telling you that in a nice way religious realm because both forces operate in the religious realm now and I believe that these two great forces are soon coming to a head and both of these forces were represented in these two sons of Isaac how that God in his infinite wisdom has foreshadowed all things to us that we might by these things know of certain what lays before us made it so plain God his word nature his Universe also perfectly arranged together so that even The Sinner can see something is fixing to take place and therefore no one is without excuse is that right in other words you don't even have to read the Bible just look around you just look at what's happening in the world look at the events around your own life and you recognize something strange is going on it's just chaos everywhere and therefore we are to take a note of such things now the spiritual seed of the Living God has always been a Sojourner as you've seen with Jacob Jacob had to go hiding and traveling and sojourning everywhere that he went and that goes on with the true seed of God until it Finds Its position it's adjourning it's traveling it's searching it may go to this church that church it may ask this person talk with this person because it's hungering and thirsting to find the very truth it's hunger and thirsting for God to fill its heart that's what it is now the spiritual seed of God now it has to be a Sojourner it has to be a rambler and that always causes a separation amen you see Isa did not last very long with Jacob for as soon as Jacob obtained that book right praise God right then is the time it called for a separation amen I'm showing you the time of Separation he says the time of separation is from the moment that Jacob obtained that but right Hallelujah now you say well brother Simon what really is the birthright what really is the birthright we fling around these phrases and these terms and we need to understand what is the birthright now we we see the bird right in clear plain language is the holy spirit himself you have a right to the Holy Spirit within your life now that is only in a generalized way but as we go deeper we understand that in John 16 13 I believe where the Bible tells us that when he the spirit of truth will be a spirit of Truth when he comes he will guide you into all truth in other words he'll open your understanding he'll give you a revelation he will even show you things to come he'll he'll let the word of God come alive when the spirit of God comes and fills your life it's not just to make you twiddle your terms and you know shout and dance or speaking tongues or do what these are wonderful things but that is not his man purpose his main purpose is to guide you into all truths from the word of God Amen in in other words he is the spirit of Revelation Hallelujah he is the spirit of Revelation now go again the moment Jacob obtained that word right it called for a separation amen the word right or the right to receive the Holy Spirit of Revelation the right to receive Revelation the ability to be able to receive Revelation and you cannot receive Revelation from God unless the seed of God the gene of God is in you God's life is already in you so when the Holy Spirit comes he's coming to those who have the ability to receive this Revelation when he speaks amen for the Deep will only call to the Deep one and the Deep must be able to respond Hallelujah they must have the ability within them to respond use the word ability it sounds like it's something you're going to do but it's not really something you are going to do he already predestinated this will be in our lives that when we hear certain parts of his word immediately there's a man here that can turn on the light and you understand that you don't know why because it's so simple and it opens up your understanding to the word of God right see praise God my the book right the Seal of God God showing this is mine This one belongs to me praise God hallelujah yes sir the Holy Spirit has come only to the ones that are predestinated to receive him praise God because they are from the thoughts of God they're the genes they're the life of God in praise God hallelujah and they have in them that quality to receive Revelation they are receptors of Revelation they have this spiritual using the term Crystal to be able to pick up the Unseen sounds they're unworked by the human ear sounds they have the right to do it praise God so we come into the world with the right to receive revelation in the Bible we read Jeremiah 1 verse 8 before I formed you in the womb before you were in your mother's womb you were way back in the eternities in the presence of God and he says before I even formed you in the womb I already knew you I already knew you you're not doing something new that God didn't know you were going to do God already knows you your every action your every thought everything he already knew you and I ordained you to be a prophet amen who does the word of God come to who does the revelation of the word of God come to the word comes to the prophet and therefore I I ordained you to receive revelation so that the holy spirit will bring the word to you and you'll be ready to receive it and then you'll go and speak it so he was predestinated to receive the word of God and all of God's believing Sons and Daughters comes with that same Spirit if we were to take that from the individual Jeremiah and expand it out to every True Believer it's really the same calling amen not to be a major prophet like he was but to have that that ability to receive the word for your age when the word comes you are willing and ready to receive it praise be to God hallelujah how wonderful to know that he is the same yesterday today and forever I don't care what church you belong to is that right God doesn't care what church you belong to it's us human beings that jump around and and fasten oh I believe this and you believe that so what amen you for all you know we got a hold of the same thing but you are looking at it from a different angle right as I've always told you about the man with the elephant one holds the tail and he he he he's just adamant it's a rope and the next one has the ears and he says what rope well your nonsense it's a fan and the other one says the two of you ah you just make me laugh because it's a post he's got a hold of the leg the next one said ah nonsense what are you guys talking about it's a horse he got a hold of the the elephant's nose you see what I'm saying all of them had a hold of the elephant but they only had a part and they were adamant that that's it but God doesn't care about that he cares about opening your eyes to see the whole picture not a piece of it he doesn't want you to be like that but you see if a person does not have that work right they become carnal they become Colonel and they run around they play around they rush to their parties and uh they're filled with all Spirits are lost and lies and cheating and robbery and uh stuff of that nature they think that that makes them smart because they can calculate and scheme and plan and trick others as such and that's their belief they are in total control amen now when you obtain this book right there is something in your heart that causes a hunger amen and when you hunger for him like that that calls again for a separation you want to separate and come out from amongst them come out from the midst of that see that's what it calls for oh my it calls for separation praise God hallelujah now if we're to look at brother Branham while he is here while he is speaking we understand clearly amen that he goes on here let me say this first now you see when that happens the church settles down it because at that point it cannot go on Esau was a good type but it cannot go on because once uh Jacob the Jacob said have received that but right they're scheming they're lying and their deceptions at that level can is no more effective because the Jacob group has caught the revelation of the word of God and it can clearly see what God is wanting to do hallelujah amen now when brother Branham said the church settles down you must understand that he was standing in the seventh Church age and he was looking forward at the church age that was coming and he was telling what what's going to happen when that age starts when you get into that age by that time the church will settle down amen and so while he was in the seventh Church age he is calling for separation and we know that every age had a separation because Luther separated from Catalyst Catholicism Wesley separated from methodism uh as such a an anglicanism he separated and Pentecost separated from methodism and these other things there always is a separation in every age but I'm talking about this age that we are in that separation is again in this age Hallelujah and we know that the separation comes when when the Jacob group receives the birthright and recognize that oh I have the ability to receive Revelation I'm seeing something that that they're not seeing I I I don't want to do it if I didn't bring it on myself but it's here and I receive it and the moment they receive that it creates a atmosphere of Separation hallelujah amen now you must understand when I say separation I'm not saying separation necessarily from people I'm not saying separation from groups I'm not saying you walk away from people because now you believe something different or you're seeing something more no that's not what I am talking about whatsoever you don't have to do anything about separation word itself will make that separation and that's what I'm telling you the time of separation is here amen it's not the wheat goes to separate from the shock the shock just pulls away from the weak because it can't stand it anymore it can't stand the wheat anymore so it pulls away from it so there's really nothing that you have to do in pulling away yourself it's the word does that because just being around you with that word of God in you because the world being quick and sharp you don't recognize it the word Discerning the word exposing the word revealing the word opening up manifesting itself through you and in you it is just something that irritates them and they don't know why yes yes it bothered Cain it irritated him he didn't know why but that's because the word was working mightily in his brother amen and when the word begins to work mightily in your heart it does the same thing oh praise God comes that time of Separation see because the church will settle down and I believe here the message has settled down I believe it has come true a time where when the message the prophet everything was right here that's wonderful but all the years now have passed it has settled down amen yes praise God and now we find out that this Spirit of Esau was there with the church through the church ages but now I spoke of you of how the accumulation of his wisdom his evil his knowledge his come to a peak and that Spirit of Isa was what they fought or we had to fight during the church ages but we are not now in the church ages that spirit is at a higher dimension it's in the highest stage of its manifestation we are now facing this Judah spirit or the spirit of Judas working within the Church of the Living God hallelujah because Esau typing you know he was only a natural brother to Jacob but now he's having to deal my friends with the Judah Spirit which was only a spiritual brother to Jesus and the rest of those disciples and that's where the separation is and the deception is and that's where we are we don't want the public say it but it's right in the midst of the church right in the midst of the message it's where the deception is not the natural brother but the spiritual brother that we have to deal with so we are facing those in spiritual Brothers amen and the battle now is between the spirit of Judas fighting against the spirit in the bride the Spirit uh the bright spirit fighting against the bright spirit that is on her anointing her and using her amen praise the name of the Lord Lord of God think about it my friends they have settled down and therefore we know they can't really overcome them things of the world out there amen they still have that Spirit liking their carousing on their dancing there still may be religious outwardly they still may come to church do everything perfectly but they got that thirst they got the taste for the for the dancing of the world and the carousing of the world he's saying when he's telling us what will happen in this age while standing in the seventh Church Edge he's saying the church will settle down and when it settles down it will be carnal and because they don't have the book right they will have these Tendencies to have the spirit of carnality wanting to do their dancing see and their manicure all their makeups amen Christina they are here wearing their little old shorts and clothes and men liking to go to pool rooms smoking cigarettes telling their dirty jokes and still claiming to belong to the church amen praise God listen there will never be able to overcome those things why he could he say to emphatically they don't have the birthright amen they don't have the birthright they'll do everything but they can't do it they'll never be able I tell you he repeats there will never be able to overcome those things neither could Esau and yet there will be religious amen amen you see he had to settle down and when he settled down he had to hold on to an intellectual conception so that he could still fight against Jacob and that is what's happening in the church world right now the message has settled down and various ministers and Men Women they're going into intellectual conception and there many of them don't even realize they're doing that but they're going into intellectual conception like that see my under settle down into an intellectual conception amen oh that's the same thing don't you see even now they have the feeling we will become an organization that spirit is in the message right now we will become an organization do you want to be able to have this kind of religious power you have to be organized do you want to have this uh benefit you need to be organized you need to have this then they want to become an organization amen hallelujah I want you to know friends that the Judas Spirit has moved up from its babyhood stage and now it's come to its adult stage of maturity here among the people amen praise God and God knew in our day and in our time now even we as Believers with our intellectual our natural Minds will never be able to see or detect that difference because it will be evil spirits operating in the religious Realm amen and doing those things amen hallelujah oh my you'll go along and you shake the hand of those things or these things and you'll have to call it brother you'll have to say God bless you brother God bless you Sister don't you think Abel had to do the same thing don't you think that he knew what was happening but he still had to do the same thing and he wasn't saying it with any kind of feeling because it was actually the fact it was his brother it was his brother but yet he knew that spiritually something was out of whack there amen he recognized it as such and so he had to shake his hands and say that praise God oh God bless you brother why they're in the message am I right they're in the message so I believe the prophet oh yeah I believe the prophet I believe the message I believe the word amen praise God so you have you can't go and judge somebody or just claim no you guys God bless your brother you got to go right with that because that thing is going to prove itself it's going to uh manifest itself somewhere in your walk in your talk or in your conversation with it it's going to show itself and sometimes it shocks you because you don't expect it to come from certain places uh like that amen praise God of course you know that some have followed the prophet many years amen they followed him and they can write books and they can make tapes and they can tell stories of how they or are they hunted with him and when they were hunting this Supernatural happened and that Supernatural happened and wonderful marvelous things happen and it's good and we love to hear that but they hunted with him they act with him they slept with him they even joked with him he even was a man that always was funny and he made jokes and stuff like that and so on Hallelujah they saw them signs wonders and miracles of that marvelous and wonderful gifts amen praise God but I believe and I tell you we would have never seen the closeness of this deception except for the Holy Ghost that is why I preached walking on the razor's Edge because that's where we are right now we are walking right on the edge of that the the king's sword amen where Hebrews 4 12 says he is quick and sharper than a two-edged sword amen it's so sharper than a surgeon's knife that will divide right down divide your soul your conscience your motivations and your intentions and God will be able to work it out like that so they're settled down and they'll begin to talk about become become we'll become an organization that's me saying and they'll begin to talk but he says we'll become an organization we'll put ourselves together we'll make a clan or a clique or something like that that's the way the church moves today and the spiritual and the colonel are still the same do you believe that it has not changed and it will never change it will go on that way amen praise God let me say quote this again the church settles down Hallelujah you see why does it settle down it can't go on the church ages are over the spirit of Esau that was working through not Church age it cannot go on it doesn't have the ability to go on you see for Esau was a good type of the colonel believer today he's speaking in the seventh Church age amen never able to overcome the world Amen praise God in other words let me put it naturally this way you're Believers that I knew in the message from early days to this day and they either went off on some little thing this way and you meet them again after 20 years and you know what they're stuck at the same place that's what really is talking about here they're stuck on things but they're still preaching about clothes they're still preaching about smoking and not that those things are right but that's their major the the clothesline religion you know they're still preaching about here and and and all these things and and televisions and so it's this the truth but the major thing is people to receive the word and they will do them things themselves by the revelation of the Holy Spirit and God's time and God season when he wants them to do it not when I want you to do it or somebody else wants you to do it but when the Holy Spirit begins to move on the individual in their heart they themselves are their own selves these things will fall off drop off they will just go away from them because it's God in their lives working it out they're stuck right there and a lot of them ministers end up preaching a glorified Holiness Doctrine rather than the revelation of the Holy Spirit but how can some of them do it when they don't even have it they can't do it that's what he's saying they will only go so far and after that what they're stuck there's nothing that can't go on right now let's move to another level here this message of brother William Marion radham has been studied to death I tell you they are studied it to death it has been searched out for every little German gem uh by mechanical means like by computerized and digital means there is not a verse a chapter a jot or a title that is hidden from them as long as they have a computer amen they're against it's being searched out let me use another term here uh it's been sanded out amen the dragon saying in the pond and every living thing that was in that pawn is coming up on the shore right they send out the message but they don't realize that there are other things in there was made in such a way not to be saying now oh my God place it there for his glory and for his honor hallelujah amen and when they're saying it out it settles down because the pond is now empty we got everything there's no nothing the prophet said that is hidden no more it's all of them before our eyes and so he says that church settles down this message has settled down but when they settled down they're settled down with partial understanding and when they settled down like that they go into intellectual conceptions because they have no Revelation so they have to take their conceptions and they settled down upon that in that way see oh praise God Amen oh yes quote brother Branham everything he ever said they can do it they can quote the quotes of brother Branham every part of it hallelujah amen to the point now that they have begun to preach and teach Christian psychology amen Hallelujah how that you can as a well-known person and I just use this so you can understand what I'm talking about not talking of him but I'm talking to the prevailing Spirit you can live your best life is that right it's all true but that's is the word has gone way above that sort of thing it's not you going to try and live your best life the best life is Christ and he is going to live his life through you so you're not worried about such stuff but they have to preach those kinds of things in the message it won't be said that way but it will be said that you need to be more consecrated you need to be more holy you need to do this you need to stop that you need to stop this you need to stop that you need to do this and don't do that and don't do the other but when a Believer is a real True Believer they don't have to think about not doing this or not doing that because they have a witness in them the Holy Spirit and them will guide them into all truth and he will teach them of these things that are to come if they are sincerely Sons and Daughters of the Living God now they're preaching psychology now I'm going to bring you the sermon today of how to be a real Christian are you going to give me now a blueprint of the dramatic arts of Christianity of of all the rules of how to be an actor are you going to give me the the wording the pacing the this the that and my goodness you should be wearing this you should be at this time you should be talking like this you see that's creating an atmosphere when it's coming down to the point where you can every person come to that particular Church they give them a curriculum Christian curriculum you want to be a member in this church you have to do this you have to do this you have to do that you're not pointing them to God and God will help you to do that even me as a preacher I'm only here as a Shepherd to guide you and say oh no you're going a little too far this way come back and come back in the center and everything will be fine but the rest of it is God speaking in your own heart it's God speaking in your own life I know all of this sounds very simple but you think about it amen praise God hallelujah amen praise God now I want you to be able to have a real Christian lifestyle see they're going to preach on those things and with the terminology it's going to sound like they're still preaching the message or preaching the word but they are already off of it because they don't have that Gene germ seed of God to give them that spirit and ability of Revelation right and that's where the problem comes from praise God hallelujah you see you the spirit can only go that far Hallelujah you know that he just went that far to Calvary and can talk about the blood and and Jesus and and and and seeing about the blood or how it flowed and Calvary but when you want to take him up to the real Pentecost no he don't want to go all the way because of all the ways to walk into the pillar of fire and he doesn't want to be there amen because he'll be this minor brain will be burnt up to a crisp so he stays away from that because it's got nothing to do with human conception praise God hallelujah amen oh praise God my just think of it they'll settle down to an intellectual conception the same thing the church does today we'll become an organization do you know that that's happening already in this message I'm not talking about the churches out there they're open organization that's not our deception no more that plane oh man we wake up in the days of the prophet and recognize that that's why we come out from that because that's open that's not our deception this is right here in in within the very message Hallelujah some of them in this message I'm not talking about being registered with the government so the government knows that you are operating as a church I'm talking about literally going and forming a small denomination do you know you can form a small denomination and you alone and your church could be that denomination and and then if any other minister comes uh or any other Church wants to come and associate with you you can bring them into that organization and then you end up with a lot of churches around you and then you start growing into a public open denomination but for years you can operate single as a single person owning or having a denomination necessary for you to know these things because that evil is behind the scenes working day and night working and the prophet says it's playing it's going to push every one of us out is going to push you out because you don't have the right to do this anymore because you are not in that particular group amen praise God hallelujah yes sir and so uh let's do the spirit can only come this far and another reason as I said it can't go any further because Jesus said it it's really the same reason Upon This Rock I'll build my church Revelation and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it building his church what on spiritual revelation of the word of God hallelujah praise God and the Judah Spirit has come this far hiding within the ranks of this present day message of this Prophet that God has sent amen and they're now coming to their end and they are now coming to their exposure and I want to thank God for that Hallelujah because they come forth and they operated and manifested in that way for so many years hallelujah praise God they're going to continue saying it is written it is written in the message I have it right here on the pages of the spoken word the prophet said it and it's written over there but when you have a conversation with them and you they you tend to go beyond the written word not differ from but go beyond the written word right there amen and show them the revealed word they just will tell you then you see that Spirit exposed they can't accept it they cannot accept it but your which are naturalized you're looking at a religious woman or a religious man that you literally could naturally admire an associate with but spiritually you can detect that thing that will not accept the truth of the word of God not according to me but according to the spirit of the Living God hallelujah they can accept it Hallelujah because they would have to have the spirit of Revelation on them to be able to accept it and when the word goes out they can't accept it I'm not saying momentarily they can't understand it you as a Believer will know that when you're talking to somebody like that that momentarily you know when I say moment there to me oh it might be a week it might be months it might be so but you know there's something there but right now they can't accept it but there are other ones adamant right away push that off they they can't have it they don't have the spirit of Revelation to be able to receive it praise God we're having a conversation here today and I trust the word of God gets true to you amen praise God hallelujah amen yes sir so we're living in this crucial hour of this last day deception praise God and it's very sad to me to see every day people believing this message and they're rubbing shoulders with eternal life just like Judas did they're rubbing shoulders with eternal life they're walking with eternal life they're taught in you and me they're talking with eternal life amen just as Judas was he was so near to eternal life Walking With Jesus every day the Lord of eternal life and he's rubbing shoulders with it God now has made it into a bright form and eternal life lives in his children in his people and their rubbing shoulders with it talking with it every day that they're going along while it's in God's elect and yet they are standing right there deceived and standing in religious era my Hallelujah we'd better be prepared because it's going higher and higher and higher until we get out of here amen and it's all around us hallelujah it's getting so bad Satan is starting to throw a lot of his Superman into this message you know some Satan Supermen are coming in this message Hallelujah is just as it was in the Old Testament when they entered the land they had Giants already in the land is that right Giants were in the land where you know we will call them intellectual Giants we'll call them message Giants we'll call them you know you can tip a fight anywhere you want but the Giants are here in the land and those giants in the Old Testament were what there there were the Bible says particularly and the Giants were like the the children and the generation of the brothers of Goliath of gas is that right it's the same spirit that was over there but it's come in here infiltrate the land and now it's multiply itself and it's moving with the spirit of spiritual Giants but God is not looking to that that was for a season God's looking at the humble and the lowly amen praise God hallelujah what do you think those those are brothers of Goliath of God were therefore in the land to fight against thee those who crossed in the promised land it's the fight against them why do you think they're hearing the message today it's the fight against the bride class the bright people the spirit of the Bride that's in this message of this hour hallelujah praise God hallelujah I'm so glad that uh that uh as while Goliath's brothers are over there in the promised land uh you know uh the spirit of David is here David's greater son spirit is here praise God and and he's ready to wield some stones again because the bride has a lot of stones and she got a lot of little rocks that she can sling away at him and I'm glad a part of that praise God that God has given us the rock revelation of the word of God that can take apart his entire being amen hallelujah amen praise God now I'm switching from that to talk a little bit about Hitler I know it sounds funny but you know um when Hitler during the last war whenever his troops got in trouble whenever he looked as if he's going to be losing to the Allies he would call for his Stormtroopers crack Storm Troopers that they would do a blitzkrieg that they will just say these were guys that were like you know suicidal they just don't care you know they carry out this work and most of the time they were able to win and overcome their uh opposition in every possible way amen hallelujah whenever he got the problem and I tell you he got a problem now and that is why I'm telling you he's calling up his Stormtroopers that's why I'm telling you he's bringing out his Giants that is why he's bringing out all his Supermen because they have to come against uh revelation and he has to bring out all of his Acumen all of the heights of his wisdom and knowledge through the years to fight against the elected seed of God hallelujah so he is uh standing here today he is standing here today in our midst with his intellectual wisdom and knowledge and he is imparting it to all those message ministers that are open to receive it amen and this men are sincere they are not they're not evil evil or bad man or anything like that amen praise God but it's just they don't realize what they're doing they don't realize what they're doing and I make it a little clearer to you do you know that came felt that he was just as much a servant of God as Abel he didn't think he was any left he didn't think he was wicked or he was evil he thought he was a good man uh just a gentleman and this rough crooked rugged guy goes with a rock and uh you know and he kills this nice white lamb and smashed the head and the blood flow out how could he be a servant of God he felt that he was much more a man of God even more than ever absolutely amen hallelujah I say to you this way do you know that Cain did not know that he was the serpent seat stop and think about it I never really thought about it uh you know he didn't know he was the serpent seed so he believed that he was just as much right as Abel has to be a man of God Amen and that is what the spirit that he came in hallelujah praise God and that is why he got angry because he felt he had just as much right to receive God's blessing and God's approval as much as in Allah he felt that so much hallelujah amen but when he brought his fruits of his labors and he brought all the flowers of his labor and um the fruits of his lips and bring them to God hallelujah his offering was rejected rejected by God outright and he just got fighting mad imagine that a man got mad with God you know a lot of people still get mad with God a lot of people get mad with God and they get mad with God first of all there is no God then when they get in real trouble all of a sudden there is a God because they're mad with God right I told you man I was just I just started preaching the message this gentleman owned a great big you owned the store and you own the store and the Man in the in the village or the town would come out and they they would play dominoes and drafts in front there and ordered their drinks and drink and play and then they would making jokes and they would talk and uh they see me coming up and say oh here's the preacher and uh what are you talking about telling these people about God and all this stuff there is no such a thing as God and this and that so I turned him and said no there is a God and he's this true Living God and it's one God and he says Ah nonsense he turned to walk away and they were fixing the road and there was a rock projecting and he went bang ah oh God I said I thought you said there was no God right but that's what happens the cryotan called to this God that they said doesn't exist then all of a sudden they cry out and call to him amen see that's the way it is my friends but you see brother the spirit in this message today it's like the spirit of Judas I want to be where I'm conscious of that so that you are not naive so that any and everybody that comes along I said I'm in a message I believe the prophet I I follow the word that you don't just swallow that I have been deceived by that spirit uh no doubt you met it too but you don't let that kind of spirit deceive you whatsoever amen hallelujah and all they were walking Judas Walk With Jesus was so that he could impersonate him whatever he was doing looking to see if he had a trick there's something to it a guy is smart oh my goodness he's looking for something thinking that Jesus was this is that so he could learn it and he can all of a sudden he can impersonate Jesus but it was not anything he could learn there was a life standing in front of him there was a person standing there and that you can't impersonate whatsoever amen hallelujah oh my think of it that colonel and spiritual will ever be the same it hasn't changed and it will never change praise the Lord amen praise God hallelujah now I want to point out something to you about separation separation in time in time was foreshadowed by Esau and Jacob separation again in time was God wanted us to know to be fight in Abraham and lot right it was also shown to us in Cain and Abel that there must come a time once that Birthright is received or like Abel did you received the revelation of the word of God showing that you are his amen but in our day God is you know that God goes with the times he doesn't change his word but he manifests himself with the day or the time we're in but we can see the day of Separation in the rocket ships that they're sending up into the moon and the space and everything else amen praise God and you know uh that this message has been fueled by The Prophet's message is what empowers it and fueled it how many of you have seen the rocket ship I'm talking about in Florida there how it goes up and the fire behind it and a long Pillar of Fire behind it and it goes up right in to the heavens amen praise God and when it goes up way up then all of a sudden one part begins to drop back to the Earth coming more carnal and coming more you know worldly slowly drop back towards and the other part takes off and goes to its destination that it has to go to right so I'm saying the rocket ship there is actually a type of our separation in this day and in this particular time amen praise God hallelujah praise God and I'm glad you know when the message came it got me all fired up yeah it got me all fired up my eye was on fire and anything that was near me it was just lighting fires everywhere spiritually speaking like that praise God and that thing just blasted me off as it did you and put you into another dimension amen you're blasted often you go into another dimension take off time countdown time praise God and it took you into this next Dimension praise the Lord glory to God but then after this uh this great tank of fuel uh typed the seven Church ages oh praise God oh it goes up that is what took you up if we didn't read understand or talk on the seventh chart changes what happened the mystery iniquity the mystery of godliness all these things coming up through the church ages it could not have put you into another dimension like that but take God he used that to take you there but the time comes amen when all of a sudden you see that cone amen it just separates from them ages it absolutely separates from the ages because what it's headed for Glory now amen the separation time takes place praise God hallelujah Up Up Up and Away praise God hallelujah and now it's not just those astronauts in the thing that decide it's the time to separate it's mission control and I want to tell you our mission control is saying get ready because separation time is here it's near be on your guard because it's time for the separation to start taking place it's already taking place but it will become so apparent that what you are saying what you are doing and how you are living which is not so much uh impressive to them now after a while they'll recognize it when the Gap starts to widen they think you're just the same yeah oh it's the same thing oh we all in the message but watch that Gap is widening and when that Gap starts to whiten then they'll realize oh my God we're left behind oh God have mercy left behind why oh praise God and now the mission control is the one that does that what we look at it's beautiful because brother sister something we didn't select ourselves to become astronauts we were predestinated hand-picked and then God trained God called you know we were pressurized we take all kind of tests in the water tank in the air tank and all kinds of pressure to see that you are really one of those amen hallelujah and that started to separate you from the rest of the fact amen but thank God that we were called out by the grace of God for this time that is here upon us praise the name of the Lord and we must real I'm going to close now we must realize it brother sister all the Simplicity of this that we are now fighting the Judas spirit right in the message fighting against the bright spirit that is in the bride and the bright Spirit of course is the holy spirit for the spirit and or in the bride says come and let him that is a thirst come you're thirsty come you're hungry come whatever it is the spirit is calling and identifying the hour that we are living in and what is happening in this hour aren't you glad you're a part of the word of God thank you musicians come print please praise the Lord Hallelujah separated onto him everything is becoming clearer to us that is not our works not our will but the will plan and purpose of God um do you have um okay good praise the Lord Hallelujah I'm one of them
