we give god the glory please be seated for a moment and then we're going to stand again i want to give honor and recognition to brother harold hildebrand of the wonderful ministry in the city of edmonton alberta he has gone to his reward the lord has grant him his graduation and he's gone into the presence of the lord i want to thank god for him i will try i will do a tribute on um line i'll i'll do tribute we'll tape it so that we can send it and they can have it praise god but before you i would like to say that uh brother hildebrandt i met in 1970 when i came to canada for the first time and i was brought up here uh by brother perry green at that time the churches needed books and all kinds of things and tapes and a windmill was necessary for the for electricity produced in some far-out area up there myself and johnson the johnson boy not boy now is a man now and um used to dabble with ham radios and things but now he's somebody that uh deals with satellites and all kinds of stuff but he is we both drove all the way along with francois lippy from switzerland we were just young men and we drove a truck with all this stuff inside and we drove it all the way up to edmonton there and when we drove up brother we drove right up from arizona right through the whole us um from bottom right up to the top and um brother perry green flew in after we got there but before he could talk to any of them and introduce me and say well look there's a young minister whatever a funeral he got a sudden call and he had to go back really fast so he just turned around got on a plane and took off so we were left there and so i just began helping to put up the tent on the shores of lake edmonton where they were going to have the meeting and their brother don babblitz i met there um and we were helping with this tent all together and i got to meet the brother hildebrandt at that time you know in the pink of his life strength and youth and everything else you know a little older than myself but uh he was just a man of vigor and vision and god used him in a mighty way we want to thank god that he is an apostle to africa for god used him to raise up and to assist brothers that were raising up churches in all almost every single country in africa has been touched by his life and by his financial support and i'm not talking about uh ten dollars here fifty dollars there i'm talking about hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars uh going out from the church in edmonton starting all these great works i also i'm not going to make this much longer also had the opportunity of ministering also with him in africa and we had marvelous wonderful meetings in malawi and other places we thank the lord for that i've also was able to minister in the church here a blessed god for him and the faithful ministry that he has had and the millions of believers that are beneficiaries of the great work that he has done may the lord rest his soul [Applause] of course he was a very jovial man as a man very jovial always as a minister uh you know making a lot of nice jokes with his friends and like that very light he never carried a heavy ministerial atmosphere that will intimidate people it was always outgoing and as a husband um he was a very uh feeling supporting a man that god made him to be a blessing to his entire family praise the lord uh god god really blessed him in every way as a man as a minister as a husband as a servant of god very surrendered to god and to his perfect divine will i um i i thank god i have a belief one or two of his messages that he preached some of them are classics that are desired by ministers all around the world and i've heard ministers quoting from some of his his messages that he has preached that god used him in a wonderful way and we thank god for that the last time i saw him was when i was passing through edmonton just about two years ago and preached in the church and i was preaching on abel um abel or having the revelation of god how revelation comes not by the written word but by the logos of god amen because abel had no bible he had nothing but how did he know right that it wasn't a fish or a horse but he knew directly that it was a lamb so it had to be revealed and he was just shouting and jumping up the best he could at the but the time and rejoicing and they were looking at him strange because they were what he's he's supposed to be this a great older minister and he's jumping up so but he knows what he was seeing and he knows why he was rejoicing like that and i thank god for him and his wife who now remains who are behind with the children god bless her heart she's been faithful she's been true she's been strong under various uh pressures and we are so happy that god has helped them both to overcome and so they are a testimony to the entire bride of jesus christ to god be the glory shall we stand just for a moment of silence for another soldier has gone home god rest his gallant soul as brother branham would say god bless you and now we will turn our attention to the word of god we will look into genesis chapter 3 verse 17 to 19. and now that you have found it let us read out of the word of god and unto adam he said because thou has heartened unto the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of which i commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it curses the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life thorns also and sisles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field praise god in the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat bread and now this is the foundation of what i will speak on till thou return onto the ground for out of it was thou taken for dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return may god bless us here today father we thank you for the reading of thy word and we ask that the great holy spirit will minister to us everyone individually that portion that we need that will lift us up lord break all the shackles from around us take away every contrary spirit lord that may lurk around us let all the darkness disappear and let the sun shine in as we surrender ourselves into thy hands for divine service to thee be the glory and the honor and the praise father in jesus name amen amen god bless you now in this book of genesis chapter 13 verses 14 to 16 god told abraham that your seed shall be like the dust of the earth they're going to be numberless like the dust of the earth of course you know abraham was a type of god or that god was typing himself in the character of abraham so when he was speaking and saying abraham i promise you that your children will be a number less like the dust of the earth he was speaking about his seed because the natural seed of abraham speaks of the royal seed of abraham which is the seed of god and then in genesis 15 5 to 6 god declares that those same seeds that will be as the dust of the earth he said to abraham i will take them from the dust to the stars they'll be numberless like the stars of heaven praise god so here these seeds that are of the dust are going to go from the dust back to the stars amen praise god hallelujah first timothy 2 12 and 13 you know that jesus came as a man in other words he came as dust himself and there later we know he shows and displays our pathway he who came as man as flesh as dust went right back to the stars where he came from through his divine ascension amen hallelujah oh praise god so we must do the same because just as much as eve came out of adam then and how his wife came from him so jesus went to calvary or golgotha really so that his wife could be taken from his side but understand clearly before he went to galgata she was still in him she was still in him and we will talk about that as we go along now i i cannot and will not complete this message here today um but i will speak on it as much as i can without trying to rush it along so that i can finish the entire text it's more important that you receive the truth of the word rather than me finishing what i have here i will let the lord determine that and with that my eyes on the time and the time of this holy spirit uh then i will conclude it but for now let's just talk about this for a while let's talk about the subject of called from the dust and this is the season where we are being called from the dust right because jesus came into this flesh which is dust and went back where he come from now uh that was all prophecy of course promise and prophecy but we want to uh talk about the prophet of malachi 4 5 because we know that under the first and the second poll that he said a lot of things before the opening of those seals how many knows that praise god and what he has said confused and still confuses a lot of people they're still confused to this very day while we are here they're confused of things that he has said but it was for a reason as he himself said you know the quote unveiling of the mighty god that some might go out some may come in some may be confused some may wonder right it was done all for a reason it doesn't mean that he was consciously putting out these things to confuse people but the holy spirit in him was causing him to act do and say certain things like that to confuse the minds of the devil right uh the enemy who was watching waiting whispering searching every way if the princes of this world knew see trying to find out what god's redemptive plan was all about so god had to hide it from the wise and prudent and reveal it only to those that were willing to learn not just naturally spiritually they're going to learn after they come out of their amnesia where they come from and how to get back to the will and purpose and plan of the living god amen so it was for a reason listen to brother branham speaking here out of the message feast of the trumpets one day i was up in sabino canyon and while up there i stood there praying and a sword came into my hands it was just natural as my hand is and there it was not knowing what it meant and then i heard a voice saying this is the king's sword then later when the angel of the lord revealed it was the word that was put in my hand it was the word for the age for the elect that was now put in his hand hallelujah now he said immediately after the angels of the lord appeared and told me of the seven seals and i was to return back to jeffersonville and to preach those seven seals let me say this i have never said anything that was this inspired it was in that where the angel of the lord met us and then the entire bible opened up and become a new bible to me and there it opened up when it re opened up revealed all the things the reformers had left out it was the complete revelation of jesus christ all together new to us but perfectly exactly with the scriptures that was the word which has always been hallelujah but now being inspired and directed for what the restoration of the bride tree amen the word came to him that the bright tree might be restored oh hallelujah oh praise god now let's get into some things here i am just excited like a kid ready to eat chocolate as much as you now listen carefully we see the attribute sons of the spirit have not yet entered into their word form body a theophany this body is one subject to the word and in earnest waiting for the earnest change of the body amen you see on look i tell you i can't finish today because change of the body we're taking just of this body here changing not understanding these talking they're waiting for the change of the body moving from this to that right that's the change of the body he's talking about not this body here changing but changing out of this body changing your body and going into that one that's why he's saying here them attribute sons of the spirit the eternal spirit the elohim spirit hallelujah see oh my you see they have not yet yet entered into that ward form body as yet that theophany this body that body is subject to the word they are waiting for the earnest the change of the body amen but if you don't have this revelation you wouldn't understand that he's talking they're waiting on the time when they're gonna move from this one moving day when they're gonna move out of this one into that one and you don't necessarily have to die because paul made it plain some of us gonna be alive hallelujah but if you're dead you're still going to be changed but if you're alive you shall be changed you're changed you're caught up by the spirit of the living god oh my praise god can we be alive and and still be inspired and operating from the leadership preeminence and point of view of our theophany body with which we have already come in contact by a revelation of the holy spirit that god will be able to use you praise god not of your own thinking of your own will but when you are not even thinking are you not even anything whatsoever unconscious godliness strikes your soul moves you out and around you know nothing about when you come back to yourself in a moment of time you wonder what did i say what did i do what happened there what happened here what happened there it's not you that live but christ that lives within us hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord you see now we are different there's a difference between him and you praise god you know you he says when you caught the revelation of the word the true revelation of the word you have come in contact or heard from your theophany is that right so every single one of us that's a true believer who has really caught the revelation of the word opened up a new world right you are actually getting inspiration for your theophany but because another place he says your theophany is really part of the holy spirit it's the holy spirit is your theophany right and that portion they got pieces pieces pieces but but that part that is your part that part that is inspiring you now leading and guiding you now hallelujah that's how you are led by the pillar of fire not the bread big old pillar of fire but that same portion each one of them god leads them and guides them whatever they do by the spirit of god so don't make up yourself like you're super spiritual and you you're going to do this you're going to do that you just need to relax and be yourself and live the way god wants you to live so that the holy spirit of almighty god might direct your steps might order your steps that you might be sons and daughters of god led by the spirit of almighty god hallelujah not by our because we want to be holy because we want to be recognized because we want to be real no not our will no more not of the will of man not of the will of anybody not of any religious person but by the will of god and by the blood of christ hallelujah amen this is happening the difference between him and you as sons see he was at the beginning already the word he was the word but we know the the word the word not a word the word was god right he was in the beginning the word he was in an and morphe body a body that he himself brought right transformed brought hallelujah it came that end morphe body it came and lived he came and lived in that in the person called mel cassidy then later as you know the process and morphine and morphed changing from glory to glory we never heard suddenly no more of melchizedek you never heard that he died on the bury him you never heard nothing melchizedek seems to just disappear but we became aware of jesus for he melchizedek became christ melchizedek was the priest but now he became jesus christ praise god hallelujah oh priests redeem us savior and king oh my lord now you see now you bypass that you and i bypass that because in that form he still knowed all things even though he was in that form or in morphe as melchizedek he knew all things see because he was in that form and you now and i have never been able to know that then hear how he says it at the end yet right you haven't gotten to know that yet so you're going to go back to that state and condition sometime now or in the future where you're going to be just like him knowing all things as a conscious aware part of god that has lost all the spiritual amnesia that we suffered when we come down here by the grace of god hallelujah oh my praise god hallelujah oh my now we know the opening of the word just like when it opened up in uh matthew it corrected the church it corrected its own mother uh that it came out from you know it was only young but yet it corrected the mother right now in us as believers it's doing the same thing and when the prophet came on the scene on the malachi 4 5 and i told you that uh and you know it under the first and the second pull he said and did a lot of things um uh without um complete understanding because he himself hadn't come into he had to grow even in his life and ministry and he hadn't come into all of this so he was saying all kinds of different different things amen but once that uh bible become a new bible by revelation then his teaching and his understanding changed and when it changed the glory days of the first ball and the second pull he started to bring not forceful and second full teaching which was glorious and wonderful but the glory of the latter house was greater than the former house you know we live in a house so so the glory of his latter house was greater than the former house because now he was teaching and preaching and inspiring oh praise god from under that third pole oh amen hallelujah which we know that the third paul ministry and revelation took him one octave higher it took it is taking us an octave higher it is lifting us on a higher into a higher dimension a higher realm of revelation and understanding oh yet so simple that many bypasses it praise god look i know god built me in certain ways where i do certain things say certain things and sometimes i can't see a thing because god is doing it through me or with me and whatever and it's causing such reactions and certain people and everything but it's for him not for me it's not for me but for him i can't say well oh don't do that don't say that because this it sounds almost sometimes like i'm wishing some people bad but it's not me wishing anybody anything bad the word says certain thing if you do certain thing you say certain things this is going to be the reaction so when you when i turn run i say that then it looks like you are criticizing a church criticizing a denomination or you're saying something against somebody but it's not that it's the word itself that's doing that hallelujah that's what they were telling him when he was here you were criticizing the priest he criticizing the tabernacle you're criticizing moses law this that the other you're talking out against everybody else you must think you were the only one right at all this is what happens and god does that on one side and but he does it on the other side to humble you to break you down because you gotta shut up you gotta stand everything take everything swallow everything and uh open up your mouth and just go on for the glory of god hallelujah amen but now it's gone one octave higher praise god which means the attraction has gone away from the gifts of power gifts of power that god gave but the attraction has gone away from the gifts of power hallelujah the attractions has gone away from the discernment it's gone away from just visions it's gone away even from prophecy the devil made sure that he moved in whole bunches of so-called prophets bunches of people that screamed they're seeing this and seeing that and having visions of the new world war and this and the other all kinds of people claiming to have discernment and everything else trying to create chaos and confusion with god's plan for the end time oh my but god already moved on from that and leave him to play around in the sandbox while god has moved on to the perfection of the world and the attraction to the true bright believer is to the word the plain simple word isn't the track them what what they don't see nothing what's there you see if you look the types and you see is it rebecca when uh eliezer went to her and gave her all them gifts of diamonds and gold and rubies and pearls and everything else and when she he she asked him about the bridegroom and he started talking about isaac and the bible said she took all the jewels and give them to her cousins and friends who and she's done listening to him she accepting words from a prophet from a messenger rather than grabbing all them jewels and holding them you can't help it women like jewels they love jewels and these churches they love jewels they love the gifts they love all them shiny sparkly monkey business stuff they just love it oh my and they cooperated but not her sheep gave them away to them and kept your eyes on eliasa and listened to what he was saying about the bridegroom that's what the church needs today keep your eyes on jesus keep your heart on jesus keep your love for jesus keep your desire for him hallelujah she hadn't even seen him yet amen oh praise god have you seen him you you haven't seen him yet you only see him by understanding through the word but a prophet came and say one day the one you feel in your heart will come personalized right before your praise god hallelujah oh you'll see him face to face and tell the story save my grace oh praise god hallelujah amen yes sir so praise god so he started teaching the third poll but you must understand for a second pull that can go out to all peoples everywhere but the third pole was towards abraham's royal seed that was hidden up all among this dust did all in the dust everywhere and so that was to them remember now you didn't come like him because you know he came with that and morphed body knowing all things but you come like adam you come like me you came from the attribute but you went right to flesh not to the and morphe theophany body he said you came from that attribute there right to the flesh hallelujah and that saw you could be tempted god way before had his desire to be a savior and a redeemer all right he already ha as a father you have sons but now he wants to be redeemer he loves all these things and he wants to do it in people like you and me he displayed in job make him sick and he still encouraged god bring him trials and he still didn't get rid of god uh break up his business this big trucking empire that he had with camels and stuff moving things across the desert god break the whole thing up and he still bless god hallelujah glory to god amen a real type of the believer the elect believer what they will be like when they get here to the end what shape and form they're supposed to be displaying so they can be identified praise god no matter what amen even if he's slay me he says i'll still trust him i'll still believe his word in every possible way so but you see you come like adam you come like me you come down from that attribute to the flesh to be tempted see amen so now you let me give you a picture now the point is that there is god with all his sons his daughters his children in him his attributes in him his genes in him they're all in him and there they were fellowshipping and rejoicing with god in every possible way so we come from being in elohim that's why the word is plural it's not singular but it's plural yet speaking of one person yet it's a plural word because we were all in him right oh my oh thanks be to god we were in that great eternal spirit as part of it we won't even discuss why you know you are eternal already even though you're not fully aware and conscious of what that means we know according to this word that we are eternal as a part of him and you had to leave for him to be the savior now he had to have somebody or something he could rely on that when he sent it down here you have confidence that if he make it sick if he do this if he does that to it if he do that to it do that to it doesn't matter it's not going to curse him it's not going to do that to him it's going to go through the entire cycle of life and go right back where it comes from and god chose you god chose me that god places confidence in you that you're going to be one of them that will ride the tides of time and return back into the presence of your heavenly father amen praise god so he moved you and i from being attribute sons you can never stop to be that but he put the attribute sons down into flesh and they become flesh man now remember that inside gene attribute that ain't changed one iota but outside the facade that they're wearing is a flesh man like everybody else but everybody else doesn't know that these uh have an eternal element an ingredient in them and the devil don't know who is who or what is what either that that is somebody that he really can't kill right uh in the sense like the prophet said here about jesus how are you going to kill god god death cannot kill god amen and he knew death couldn't kill him that's why he said i rise again in three days what are you going to do about it see they can't do anything about it and we are a part of him and so we know death can't really kill us it will kill off what it produced it'll kill back off this flesh man but we only come into this realm and this flesh man to use it that god might go proving his word that he might show forth his glory and his power and we are a part of that great undertaking right now when this life is finished but when this life is finished after that attribute has been tempted trying tested whatever else he said when that life is finished here remember you have a promise if this this earthly tabernacle that you're wearing now be dissolved remember your teopony you have another one waiting you got another one waiting right then jesus a body has now prepared me praise god hallelujah we have the same thing we have a prepared body that we're going to that's why we preached the other week on believers have another body you leave this one you go to that one all you're doing is the body change all you're doing is changing bodies from one to the other you understand what i'm saying about the body change what it really is oh praise god hallelujah we have another one that's there already waiting praise god uh to go back with all the word the revelation that the inspiration you're getting now you're in contact with it and you know it's real it's just waiting to receive you praise god that's where you go to that's where you go you go back to the word hallelujah the word you're going back to the original when it was all word and go back to your position in that word praise god then hallelujah when you go back like that you can now look back and see all them things that we've done and whatever else now you're going to understand even why some of the things you've done and and why i've done this and why i'd run that you know you never could understand why i act that way why say this why did that why did that why didn't i you see but he says when you go back it's just like the seals uh hallelujah i think brother lamb in in michigan must have preached on that that god not only break this seven seals but he broke the seals on your life and the seals were broken what happened the church could look back now and see where it come from and the history of it right on up to this time and from there they shouldn't they should know how to act to for the rest of the journey that might take the trip with the bright room the really let when the seals are brought from across your life hallelujah god allows you to look back on everything how he protected you some of the evil you've done some of the right things you've done some of this some of that whatever ways of thinking those things are coming off of your mind of your life everywhere delivered by the power of god and the holy spirit allows you to look back he says and see understand and see what we all done oh now do you understand it oh my we have never become the word you never become the word whoever you have become the word oh no because you always were the word right so you say we never become the word see oh my no what we become flesh man not the word look you will never be the word unless you was a thought in him before the beginning amen that proves the predestination of god you can't be the word unless you were his thought you are a thought of god see you had to be in his thinking first praise god now you see what you see in order to stand temptation he had to let you bypass that theophany is that right you had to come down here and be in this flesh praise god oh my oh praise god to be tempted by sin and then if you stand jesus already said all the father has given me will come to me the word and i'll raise him up at the last day hallelujah so you see you had to be the first to be raised up at this last day right now another place the prophet says you see what he means when he says the last shall be first because you have to be in him you have to be forced this flesh man is not first this flesh man come afterwards but the first shall be last to be the last man standing brother praise god hallelujah oh i wish old pete was here brother he'd be jumping in shouting and screaming amen he said he'll take you back from the dust back to the stars where you come from beyond the stars where you come from then you see coming down the regular line from attribute before the foundation of this world see oh my he come down like that before the foundation and do you know his name is put on the lamb's book of life oh my see the book of all living things all living things the lamb's book of life eternal life amen and eternal life and you know that breaks down the various degrees of persons that have will receive eternal life somewhat we don't expect them so on god will still granted by his being rich and mercy will grant that eternal life you see but that's why he says his name shall be called jesus right there you see his name on the book of life right amen see then he become known the word see the theophany that could appear and disappear but you see now he could do all those things but under a flesh bill named jesus right he was doing that under a flesh veil named jesus hallelujah praise god he could appear and disappear they tried to take him to the to a cliff and throw him over and the bible says and he just passing through the midst of them went this way just leave them with their foolishness you know walk through the middle of them and he's gone right because he still had the element of the ability of the theophany in him but inside of a veil of flesh and he was conscious of it praise god hallelujah now he become flesh and returned back there again resurrected the same body in a glorified condition but you see you you bypass that theophany and you and i we come here become flesh man i repeat to be tempted by sin god proven his word that that person there is his word and his word can't fail can't lie can't come back void it can't it will always he said return back to me it will return to him and it won't return void it will fulfill its mission it will do what it was set down here to do amen praise god you see oh my now to become flesh man to be tempted by sin hallelujah or praise god but while they know they're going through all these things they're not worried why he says here because they know if this earthly tabernacle this flesh man be dissolved back to dust we have one already waiting hallelujah so you have another you have a body waiting for you we have bodies waiting for us so you see why we don't fear what they call death what they call death because that death is no death for us who are real believers the attribute suns the the spirit man that god has in there praise god you see but we have not yet got those bodies but they are waiting amen hallelujah praise god when this body receives the spirit of god the immortal life inside of you throws this flesh this body into subjection to god hallelujah he that is born of god does not commit sin now we've taught on that that john talked about it that the seed of god can't commit sin because i see this part of god himself it can't commit sin but the devil's strategy through the ages is that he does he goes causes you to lie yes you can't say no i didn't lie it was the seed no no but he he does use you to lie he lose you to cheat he used you to do whatever evil wrong or whatever but he he's not letting on that you know he is the motivator brother george smith said it from this pulpit he goes and uh eggs you on to go light a fire and then when the moment you light the fire he's the first one to run and go call the police see look what he did look what he did he liked to fire his burning down that person's house but he is the instigator he is the accuser of the brethren he is the one doing those things but god has woke us up by a prophet of malachi 4 william marion branham and by this revelation the seed of god cannot commit sin for she is part of him the word and more than that she is justified hallelujah she had never done it in the first place it wasn't her it wasn't him it was the devil back there motivating instigating and stirring things up because he wants to see how many of them he can take to hell and he can't take none for he said i will lose none that will place within my hands not a single one hallelujah lord of god amen amen praise god forevermore praise the lord oh my therefore we know there is therefore no condemnation them to them that are in christ jesus for they walk not after the flesh that they're living in in other words and and the motivations desires and nature of this flesh they're living in amen see oh praise god they walk not after the flesh but after the spirit there you are see that causes you to throw that body into subjection to the world hallelujah oh praise god you don't have to say oh no more you don't have to say oh if i could just quit drinking he's talking about the works we all are this oh if i could only quit drinking if i could only don't say this if i could do that if i don't do this oh my oh all you've got to do is recognize and get into christ you get into christ and it's all gone because you're all gone doesn't mean it's gone but it's all gone because it's passing away god means passing away right it's passing away there you see because your body becomes subject to the spirit and them things are now dead they're dead your sins are buried you're a new creation who can say that i'm a new creation i'm a brand new man i've been born again hallelujah thanks be to god you see your body becoming subject to the spirit and it causes you to try to live a right kind of life you just try to live why because in other places he talked he said but we're still inside of this flesh body we're still going to be tempted we're still going to be tested we're still going to have all kinds of things come across our thoughts and minds and everything else but you are aware you're in this body but you're trying to overcome those things and you may never overcome them every one before the rapture but god knows your intents of your heart he knows every desire of your mind he knows all that is in you praise god it's not trained to think that you are going to grow up in a monastery and bring yourself to perfection no the perfection dwells within you and you're trying to work it out every day you're trying to work out your salvation oh praise god forevermore oh my just think of women claiming they got the holy ghost and going out wearing shorts and things on how could you do that how could that be the spirit of god in you and it let you do such a thing as that certainly it's he's not a filthy spirit he is the holy spirit when you become subject to the spirit that troubles your whole being subject to him the spirit hallelujah is nothing in the world but this same seed may manifest in you quickened hallelujah quicken hallelujah and now made alive oh praise god so them seeds that were laying in the dust there waiting for three thousand years like that wheat seed that what they found in egypt and when they go and put some moisture on that we see to their shock and surprise the seed began to blossom and grow again oh praise god to produce another loaf of bread oh praise god forevermore see that it's nothing the spirit is nothing in the world but this word seed made manifest in you or quickened hallelujah it's man alive praise god when the bible then says to you don't do this the body quickly has to turn to it and answer there is no question for the spirit that is in you is that word praise god in other words you can't deny yourself right oh you're going to deny your own self you can't do it what is it it's the earnest of your resurrection this body will be raised up again because it's already started it was once subject to sin to maya the corruption but now it's got the earnest inside of it it's turned it's turning heavenly now that's the earnest you're going in the rapture hallelujah oh praise god hallelujah how glad how happy are you that you know you know ernest do you know ernest you know the guy oh my he says you got the earnest in you praise god earnest of the resurrection in your soul praise god notice that quickening power what praise that is from who is this melchizedek praise the name of the lord this is from the rising of the sun now notice this quickening power bringing the word or the mind that was in christ in you amen let me say that again this quickening power bringing the word the mind that was in christ in to you i'm trying to show you that that when you are raised god raised jesus from the dead but he raised you up also also quit into life with him you are now quick to life although then you were but an attribute still in his thoughts when he was on the cross i was on his mind yes he yes he knew yet he loved me oh praise god you you see do you see clearly when he was on the cross he was thinking of all of his that's why isaiah said he shall see his seed he shall come and see his generation oh praise god hallelujah amen oh my quicken to life see with him but then you were only an attribute in his thoughts but god saw all of them in him at the finished praise god hallelujah amen so what the prophet is saying is that when jesus came and he was here they look and they see the one man jesus but we were still in the starts that's like the wife still being in adam's side and he is doing all these things but he said the prophet is saying don't you understand don't you know what it means when he was walking and doing all them things going on the cross dying and going in the grave overcome death already and raise up and you were you were in him don't you understand it's talking about you because you overcome them things already you're waiting now for the manifestation of it and the holy spirit has come as an earnest to your resurrection that you've got to be in that number he said because when god looked down upon that body he said all of them in him hallelujah you didn't see him alone but he said all in him he's our husband and wife in other words husband and wife together the spirit left him in the garden of gethsemane for yet to die as a man remember friends god anointed that flesh which was only human flesh if he that went up there as god he would have never died they couldn't kill him see because you can't kill god so he didn't have to do it but he did remember he went there when he went there he went there with you in him praise god uh paragraph 242 rising of the sun he says remember he went there with you in him praise god i i make a note here in order for him to redeem us he went there with us already in him god had never separated yet the bride from the groom like adam and eve when he took her from adam's what side amen but with jesus the prophet is saying here at this point god had not yet taken the the bride from in the groom she was still in him that's why he says you're identified with christ everything he did you already done it he overcame you overcome in your flesh you may be struggling but really the man inside the you guarantees you to overcome and that you are an overcomer already because you overcome he said how by him that is in you that has already overcome oh praise god hallelujah amen so when god looked down upon the body of christ then looking down he was he saw both male and female hallelujah for the bride was still in the groom so when it redeemed it was all redeemed in that one body it was all redeemed that's why they are one and the same word this same word that spoke of the groom speaks of the bride hallelujah when it speaks of the groom it speaks of the bride oh how can the bride come and fail to manifest everything that was spoken of concerning him see and the groom come and when he come again he wouldn't be the bride his own bride so the bride manifesting the word is actually crap the lord jesus christ come back by the seventh seed this is the coming of christ but now he's come in the bright form he's come as his own bride let me repeat it again read it again how can the bride remember the word that spoke of the groom speaks to the bride they're one how can the break come and fail to manifest everything that was promised of him and how can the groom come and wouldn't be the bride hallelujah that's too much oh praise god sister sheila god bless your soul oh praise god he's a marvelous wonderful god hallelujah our faith is an eternal praise god hallelujah when he did everything even to proving it by raising himself up from the dead hallelujah don't you understand the bride has to do the very same thing amen praise god have to be exactly he says that's what the word said she would be in the last days don't you have to return through malachi 4 hallelujah in other words you referring to the angel that come down and rule back the stone now with a stone of doubt and fair and everything else roll it back so that you can come out from them prisons and you know all those graves uh and seminaries they add you in and then you're able to come out into the glorious liberty and recognize who you are right she has to be manifested like it was in the days of sodom don't the word have to world have to be in that same kind of a condition like that for this to happen amen so all that carry on out there you rejoice because your salvation is narrow then you suppose you're worrying about this worrying about that better about uf4 worrying about whether this happened whether los angeles is going to say we're not looking for them signs we'll we're not look they will happen the word says so well that's not what we're looking for we are looking for the word hallelujah amen don't the world have to be exactly like that isn't these things a perfect identification of the word of god made known to us hallelujah praise god can i go a little more oh my i don't want to be route your flesh man praise god hallelujah amen let's feed on the word here i'm going to the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride from paragraph 2 10 to 2 15. he's talking about leviticus 23 and verse 26 going downwards now remember here there is seven feast days hallelujah feast of the trumpets feast of the tabernacles feast of the wave sheath and so on he didn't give all of them but there are seven feast days and them were only a type of these seven church ages you got that oh my now how many sabbaths were there between them see seven sabbaths between pentecost and the trumpets seven church ages now between pentecost that happened back there and the trumpets the word going back to the jews this is what he's talking about here which is and he says it here which is them seven church ages amen see remember that always them feast days represent the seven church ages praise god just a quick thing in here we see seven feast days they had it literally there in israel but every time a messenger come and drop his message that's the spiritual fool or the feast day for the season they feast on that word that was received for them so each age had a feast day praise god well we still feasting on what the seven angel left for us praise the lord glory to god so now he says but keep your numbers running somebody will say brother branham you don't run out the days because you only got seven but look at the 36th verse seven days shalt thou make an offering of fire unto the lord but on the eighth day the eighth day shall be a holy convocation wow oh man he said oh there's another holy time coming praise god i believe that's right now amen oh holy convocation and you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord it is a solemn assembly and you shall do no servile work therein you're going to cease from your work no more flesh works you don't have to do that to earn your way into the kingdom uh you don't have to try to work down holiness or anything of that nature because you're not under that covenant anymore we got an eight day when we speak of eight day holy convocation what what does it say do do no work when you are in it do not work in it you you you break into this thing you know your works are over hallelujah oh praise god if i got mistakes i want my brethren to see them so they can correct me the spirits in them can correct me turn me around help me in the way that i'm going oh praise god hallelujah oh my the flesh they like to hide things but when the spirit of god begins to move on you amen you're going to let the light the sun shine in praise god hallelujah do not work in it the 8th day what you're back to the first day which speaks of eternity for as she rolls around without a stopping place there oh my back into the eternal oh glory to god you see them them attribute sons going right back into the eternal oh praise god notice also upon this eighth day last day last day feast day of the tabernacle after that last feast day after the last church age amen holy convocation begins amen holy convocation or praise god convo to convocate means together a holy gathering start to take place when the redeemed are gathering in oh whoa wash like the snow and free from all sins how they're gonna shout how they will sing when the redeemed are gathering in praise god hallelujah amen praise god the arrow of god's deliverance shot from his bow rainbow of promise oh god asks us to believe his word then we believe it he sends the holy spirit to energize that word praise god when he falls into it the word when the word is being preached the holy spirit brings the word he energizes that and then he flashes the same light he flashes the light of god's promise over that word so you and i can see do you believe do you believe do you believe there is a man here that can turn on the light oh praise god turn on the light not this light but all of a sudden the light went off in your heart all of a sudden you got an epiphany all of a sudden you recognize all of a sudden some little something in the veil rips and you can see clearly what god is talking to you by the great holy spirit god said by his blessed promise i made a promise to abraham oh my glory god i'm sending you down there to do it then when god's word or his promise becomes enlightened by his presence of the angel of the lord oh hallelujah oh my friends uh god always keeps do you believe that god always keeps his promise i believe god always keeps his promise okay the time is winding down i'm going to still preach a little more is that okay if if it's too much for you get up get some water wash your face your eyes and shake yourself come back in the house of the lord god let the word go forth and saturate your soul oh my god hallelujah oh my i was feasting on all of this and you know i can't make you see all i am seeing but the holy spirit can do that and you can rejoice in it and you don't just listen to these messages and leave them like that you need to go back and listen to them again and and let them saturate your soul praise the lord hallelujah amen you see it's the water uh you you see zechariah 4 6 says amen not by might nor by power but by my spirit said the lord not by your wisdom not by knowledge not by denomination but by my spirit i will energize my word hallelujah the disciple he had sowed it into them disciples when the spirit come it come to energize the word and i'm saying this the word that was already in them what the holy spirit does the holy spirit doesn't bring out what you're not it brings every seed must bring forth after its kind and the true baptism holy spirit comes to quicken that seed that was buried in the dust of the earth and make it start to wake up no matter if it was sleeping for 3000 years it starts to wake up it starts to recognize who it is where it come from where it's what's supposed to do and where it's going back to amen remember now that's wisdom versus faith amen oh my pre see oh praise god now remember you remember i've told you some time ago just before jesus come the devil is cunning and a sly and wicked before jesus come just before jesus come a whole bunch of false messiahs came on the scene they were trying the devil was trying to confuse and confuse and mix up the minds of the people so all of a sudden you start to get a whole bunch of them tagging us judas macabre so this one that one coming and saying dear the messiah until that problem wrong you know uh before the real messiah jesus christ come on the scene well if it happened to him the bright room what's the happen to the bride this is what he's talking about now there have been churches and churches and churches and brides and brides and churches and brides and brides but there has got to come one there has got to come forth a real bride praise be to god but this false one's got to come first this false will not go out there but that only lets you know the real one is on the way hallelujah one that's not only got mechanics she not only got a building of beautiful church buildings no but the dynamics of it makes the church live and move under the power of the resurrection hallelujah no matter how much the mechanics prove to be right it has got to be the dynamics to make it work don't matter how you build a church building no matter how you got your life in order with all kind of church teachings you got all your mechanics you got it right none of that means nothing unless the holy spirit comes to quicken those mechanics he says that is what easter actually proved he wasn't only the word he was god himself the dynamics in the world oh praise god hallelujah that made the body of jesus christ called stiff dead in the grave shake into life and rise again praise god you know praise god i'm running ahead of myself but i will get to that another week he says it's not the seed itself that just comes to life and start to grow you see when the rain falls he says there have to be an invisible life in that sea yes and that's what the rain come to putin to let it grow and live praise god hallelujah oh my so i'm so grateful to god that in the sea of god that there is [Music] life is laying there [Music] [Music] oh my praise god forevermore think of it oh my oh my see the dynamics in the word that's what made the body of jesus christ the body of jesus christ but the dynamics was in the flesh man jesus and made that rise up hallelujah no matter if the moon said he was dead son said he was dead star said he was dead all nature could even say he was dead but the whole world may recognize now that he's alive again i am he that levitan was dead but i'm alive forevermore praise god he was not only the mechanics of the world but he was the dynamics to prove the word prove it praise god hallelujah he being the groom then the bride has to come forth because she spotted him and if he come forth she has got to come forth oh my it can only be the manifestation of the fulfillment fulfilling of all the revelations any others have spoke about the bride now it can only be made manifest praise god if it does something different from the groom then that is not the original bride because she is flesh of his flesh amen bone of his bone natural flesh of his flesh bone of his bone spiritual flesh the word and spirit amen the spirit keeps the word just like your bone soldier body as a foundation the spirit of god she is part of him bone of his bone praise god hallelujah oh my she can't manifest to do something different than the group she's got to go according to the word hallelujah she is life of his life power of his power she is him let me repeat again she is him as men and women are one the woman taken from his side she had taken a spirit or the feminist spirit taken from him amen praise god we are the bright spirit taken from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and dynamics their wife hallelujah praise god that's little there but you see what they're saying too god allow us to come down here to become in these flesh bodies that he can come back and be the dynamics in these mechanics to manifest himself true and make the word real to the world hallelujah praise god put it together and this the spirit in him to put him and the wife together the spirit of him and by the flesh of him the word and put it together making both mechanics and dynamics praise god forevermore hallelujah i'm gonna i'm gonna pause here and we're gonna pick this up hallelujah amen two more quotes short quotes quickly for if the spirit that raised christ from the dead now dwells in you will it not also quicken your mortal body your flesh body that you're in if it's the same spirit that was in jesus christ in you amen praise god it also quickens your mortal body now how we flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone because we are yet mortal sinners by the flesh mortal that part ready to die these bodies ready to die you see but the spirit quickens brings to life the spirit that wants light to drink run around commit adultery all these things it's quicker than this body that you're living in why you see it's quick in it that thing now hallelujah has died amen and you are now resurrected praise god oh my i thought you're going to resurrect um i don't know how many years you are going to live or whatever i thought that's when your body gonna rise up out of the grave like like that you see those are pentecostal delusions and paintings that they visualize that that's how it's going to be but god says no that's not how it's going to be you are you you're being spiritualized right now for the rest of this journey amen right now and your the first stage of the process of resurrection it started already because the spirit has already quickened you to the word oh my and we gotta be like captain kirk where all the atoms got to kind of move around a bit before it forms the whole thing and you go back to being where you were but god by his spirit hallelujah amen prophecy is being fulfilled therefore your bodies now are just the temple for the dynamics who is the dynamics him praise god so don't you see there is your resurrection there he's telling us what the resurrection is not what this pentecostal saying is the resurrection and god even believers that following this message years of that drumming in their head they're still looking for that kind of resurrection not realizing it's a supernatural resurrection that's going on now but time to come to that one moment your god hallelujah if you're dead you'll be changed that change will be completed amen from this body praise god by the grace of god i'll end this now therefore your body is a technology dynamics from the beginning you are a part of the mechanics there is your resurrection there is the church in the resurrection with him these bodies right now right now i say are quicker see you heard you believed and it changed you from denomination to the word amen praise god from glory to glory he's changing me musicians changing me changing me come on you lost your voice i should use my voice instead seems like you lost your voice i'm going to preaching and you lose your voice my goodness that's a mystery to me [Music] glory to god hallelujah praise god amen i'm so thankful of god for opening our eyes and opening our hearts to these things they were already in the word but the prophet plainly said that the spirit spoke for him and said but they will know when it is time for them to know and i believe that time is now i believe now the tabernacles can feast on the word of the living god god bless your brother praise god hallelujah it's wonderful wonderful now um i'll be here next sunday to preach the word of god and then i am leaving as i've said to you to go into guyana south america for two weeks or wear out their

remember brother philip and sister rose as they go to petroleum to minister the word they've been invited to minister the word to those believers and we pray that god will bless them and use them brother tim amen and sister deborah have ministered there today praise the lord i don't know if the service is over because you don't know how the spirit will move but i know god is going to bless them them and use them and has used them and will be using them for his glory and honor when i return i'd like to set a date with the brothers here the board for a church meeting that we can have one church meeting we haven't had one in quite some time and we'd like to have a church meeting so that we can pull things together a little more tighten a few things make a few things clear and we
