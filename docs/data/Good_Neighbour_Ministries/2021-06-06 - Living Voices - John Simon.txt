[Music] praise the lord to one and all another wonderful sunday morning to lift our hearts and hands and voices and to give glory and honor and praise and glory to the true and living god may the lord bless us all today as we look into his perfect law of liberty with our hearts singing and rejoicing praising and magnifying him may god bless us together from his holy and precious word hallelujah our topic for today is living voices living voices and our scripture is found in revelation chapter 19 verses 5 and 6 shall we read together and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our god all ye his servants and ye that fear him both small and great and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as a voice of mighty sunderings saying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reigneth praise be to god hallelujah a gracious heavenly father how thankful we are this morning that we may come together as a people to show lord association with you that you allowed us to be fellow yoke fellows and to join our hands and hearts and voices with you in fellowship and in praise and in honor to your great and glorious name though we do not see you with our eyes but we fill you with the redeeming power of the holy spirit pulsating within our hearts lord god may your spirit settle upon us father wherever we are in our homes in our in any foreign land wherever your people may be let the great holy spirit lord call out your people bring them to attention of your word may they recognize your voice that was buried in them from before the foundations of the world grant it lord and you take the glory you take all the praise all the honor for what you will do and what you are doing now for we commit ourselves to you lord in jesus name grant us utterance and grant us hearing and may you as we have said father be praised now and forevermore hallelujah living voices last sunday as we spoke we were concluding our talk and in this we spoke of the rapture mystery and how the rapture mystery was uh revealed and unfolded by the ministry of this great prophet messenger of malachi 4 5 a messenger or the messenger sent to the seven church ages and here he made it clear that there are three levels or steps in jesus descent for the rapture now we are speaking on on this living voices living in the season and time of the rapture coming of jesus christ this time when he comes is coming for his bride hallelujah right now he is appearing and his appearing is creating moves of god miracles signs and wonders the unfolding of the word the revealing of the word the manifestation of the word changing of hearts changing of lives it's a preparation time when the bride is making herself ready for the for the lord's return to earth again to pick her up and raise her up praise god for paul said we will be caught up to meet him caught up in the presence of the living god and now we see jesus descending from heaven with the shout the voice and the trumpet certainly when we read revelation 10 1 we read of that mighty angel coming down from heaven and planting one foot on the land and one upon the sea and the bible says in his hand he had a book and in that book hallelujah the book was open i want you to know it's the same book that was there when the voices voice went out if there's anyone that in heaven and earth that can break the seals that were upon that book the seventh seal book which held the names of all god's elected seed were in that book and john himself knew that his name would be in that book and if the book could not be opened and the names could not be read out then all was lost the whole gods people his children all would be lost but then suddenly they heard the voice then they looked and when they looked they saw a bloody bleeding lamb hallelujah come forth and he took the book from the hand of him that sat upon the throne in other words god changed his he changed his ministry right there he changed his office right there praise god here was the great lion become a lamb and that lamb dying bleeding hallelujah the bleeding bloody word coming down so the book which was closed was taken into the hand of the lamb praise god but now and he took the soup seals from off of that book and now the book was open now in this scene we are seeing him again but now he is in the form of the covenant angel of revelation 10 1 for as you know in the old testament god sent the great covenant angel that covenant angel is different from all the other angels for this one he comes the bible says with a rainbow around his head hallelujah and in his hand he al he has the book now open the book is now open the seals were opened and they were in the hand of this angel with the rainbow about his head the rainbow covenant angel angel of the covenant who is no uh who is well known to be the lord jesus christ himself descending in the form of an angel and the bible says and he placed one foot on the land one upon the sea raised his hands with the book open towards heaven and he shouted with a loud voice and when he shouted with a loud voice when he uttered his voice the bible says seven thunders went forth when he uttered his voice as i made known to you seven is the number of perfection his voice being the word which was now to be revealed or release or uttered amen which he would utter his voice and his voice would become the shout in and through the ministry and message of brother william marian branham of malachi 4 5 of the fulfillment of malachi 4 5 and that voice that mighty thundering voice would now in and through the prophet of malachi 4 5 revelation 10 7 would become or has become the shout the shout the voice the shout the trumpet oh blessed be the name of the lord god hallelujah the shout of course is the message amen the message behold the bridegroom comment going out to meet him trim your lamps amen may your lamps be trimmed and burning oh brother sister if your lamp is not trimmed and burning then you are in trouble and you need to come to god and say lord jesus help me lord let me trim my lamps lord jesus i remember in the old days maybe even now in some some countries people would take a rag and place it in a bottle or can of kerosene and that rag would be sticking out at the top and they would light that rag and it would give them light and then it would burn and burn and it would become so black after a while that unless you trim it and pull it up you won't get any more light and your lamp will go out so this is what the bible is saying we ought to rise up and trim our laps get out of that smokey smoky lip slap shade come out of the situation where your life is so smoky it has no purpose it has no direction it doesn't have a clarity to it and the holy spirit is saying dip yourselves in the blood of christ which will wash away the snow it will turn your life around change your lifestyle change you from the inside to the outside it's not the putting on of religious clothes it's not the putting on of religious actions it's not the putting on of religious talk but it's a change of life when your life is exchanged and christ comes into you and he lives in you then it is not i that live paul said but christ that liveth within me hallelujah and when christ lives within you your life is changed and changing from the inside out little by little he's changing my way little by little my night turns today oh thank god that i have received jesus christ within my heart my life did not just change completely like that even now i have not come to perfection in every action but every day by day we're walking in the light we're walking in the world we are letting the voice of god come in us on us and through us for his glory and for his honor blessed be the name of the lord oh behold the bridegroom cometh amen who is coming the resurrection is coming the one who is the rapture is coming amen the one that can if you die he's the one that can raise you from the dead if you're alive and remain he will caught you'll be caught up by the power of almighty god into the presence of god matter of fact we are already being caught up the holy spirit by this revelation has raised your spirit your soul is being raised up now by the revelation of this word and god is placing you putting you into a heavenly place a heavenly condition and position to know who you are and what you are raised up for praise the lord praise god praise the lord for this original life that is being displayed in us now to him be the glory and the honor and the praise amen amen amen hallelujah voice the voice of the resurrection glory to god hallelujah for when i said the shout comes and the shout the message from the prophet is believed accepted and inculcated then my brothers that shout becomes the voice inside of the sons and daughters of god his voice in us that's no wonder jesus said in that hour you will know that it's not just you that speak but my father that dwelleth in you he will speak think not of what you will say or when you stand before the high and the mighty and you you're you're wondering what to say he said in

great things he has done because he has given to us jesus christ amen the blessed body that was so filled with the father that anointed us and being a substitute died in our place for he was wounded

a comeback oh god of god and you are saying lord wash me in the blood and the cleansing and forgiveness that the blood provides has made you undefiled as if you've never done it in the first place amen he said i'll make you white as snow you're not the same person you used to be you're not the same person you were before you've been changed by god's power to transform he has raised you up to a

glory to god real christians and that when you live like a real christians the voice that is in you speaking out like oh praise god that is the thunder that shakes the devil and puts him on the run that's the thunder in your life that makes the devil paralyze and scream when he hears the voice that is in you living and speaking out through you amen i thought i made the point the devil doesn't care how loud you go around talking about you're a christian you're a preacher you're a this you're a superintendent you're that the devil don't care about you saying oh i've got the doctor divinity i've got a dd of i've got a ba i've got this the administrations whatever oh that's marvelous and wonderful for down here but the devil doesn't care what you say about that what about that whatsoever amen amen oh what the devil cares about is that when he looks at you he's here sanctified life is he is god in you he is christ back of your skin veil amen it's not just you in your skin but now god is in your skin god is back of your skin veil know you not that you are the temple the holy ghost lives within you praise god and your body is a temple for the living god to live in you for you are the temples of the living god you are part of that new jerusalem the new city hallelujah will praise god forevermore all of us are living stones or lively stones which are now being what shaped and built up into a house for the glory of the living god amen amen back then solomon said lord david lord let me build you a house god said david you can't build it allege your son solomon build it nevertheless man can't build me a house and i can't live in the house uh made by that man's hands for the heavens of heavens cannot contain me all eternities can't contain me oh my glory to god oh praise god but you know what god decided he was gonna build his own house and his house would not be made with bricks and stones but as the bible tells us a house where there is no it's going to be built not using saw or plain or any kind of measuring things that man has but built by the hand of god alone glory to god hallelujah and is built in the house now and the house is not made of bricks but we are the stones that build god's temple one by one he is building us and placing us into our position positionally our glory be to his marvelous name amen when you walk with that kind of a life consecrated sanctified dedicated to god they see all manner of evil against your swearing cursing everything else but what happens it doesn't bother you amen you look towards heaven i don't mean you turn your nose up in the air but i'm mean little bit in your heart you're trusting god and you're smiling because you know the reason why the people are angry or why the devil is getting the people angry is because the devil is seeing christ's in you and he's angry not at you but in christ because jesus said if they persecute me your lord and master and then i am in you now will they not persecute you amen christ in me the hope of glory oh praise god forever paul said it is not i that live the life i once lived amen yes that i once used to live that kind of a life but the life i now live i am living it by revelation by faith amen and the son of the living god oh glory to god hallelujah amen praise god amen call us whatever you want call us reproach us blackball us rumor lies whatever call us whatever you want amen you see listen friends let me say this again people don't realize what they're doing this move of god is not a church it's a move of god and it's god himself moving in and among and upon his people oh my listen so when the people are coming against you wherever you are for believing this message and they're talking against the prophet against the message against the church against the uh the pastors against the the believers they are speaking against the christ or god that is in you but they don't know it because they're still seeing you who are just the outer veil now you are the outer veil but the one living in you is the lord jesus christ himself so when they do that they're actually coming against him and then oh how we should pity them and feel sorry for them for they don't know and i believe that's what jesus was trying to say on calvary oh father forgive them for they don't they know not what they do they don't recognize who's living back of this veil and they're they're piercing it they they're criticizing it they're they're they're pushing a spear in it they don't recognize that the same god that they claim to serve that they are piercing him they are sparing him they're they're giving him vinegar calling him all mandarin names and every word that is spoken against him he said after i leave whatever you do it may be forgiven but that comforter coming after me which is the holy spirit when he gets in the people and he begins to move and the spirit of the living god begins to work through them and you begin to come against that and you speak against him he said that will not be forgiven you for it will be what blasphemy oh my lord help us in this day and in this hour in which we live praise god praise god when you live that kind of a life recognizing it's not by my works of myself or doing anything it's not my praying for anybody or praying against anybody amen oh praise god but just let the lord work through you and when the lord begins to work through you oh that is the thunder that shakes the devil the devil can't stand that oh my my friends i've told this story to my own church i remember when i was in old pentecost there was a wonderful saint of god but back then with no understanding of how god works she came to church one sunday morning and she loves to testify and we all should love to stand up and testify and not just be reticent sit in our seats with our mouth like we have locked jaw no sir but we ought to be able to raise up and praise god and be able to testify about his goodness and of his love however she came and she was testifying she said bretwin when i woke up this morning and i went to my foul coop or we say pen foul pen and i looked inside my rooster oh my foul was gone oh my she said when i saw that and i already had my church clothes on ready to come to church and when i saw my rooster was gone i went into the middle of that yard and i lift up my voice and i said listen i am going to my church and i'm going to put down these two knees to before god and i'm going to ask god to bring some kind of a curse on whoever stole my foul cup my rooster somebody belly is going to swell here today somebody's belly gonna swell oh my she said and i prayed like that i told them that i'm coming here and i said by the time i get back to my house that rooster had better be in that pen or somebody as belly or somebody's stomach is going to swell oh my oh so the next sunday she came back she came to church and she said brethren i am telling you we serve a true and a living god you see when i got back there my fall my rooster was locked up in that pen safe and sound and god gave back my brewster and i give him praise honor and glory and si our sister had a good run around the church praising god for what he had done now that was wonderful back then but let me tell you that's not what we're talking about here now we understand that if god allowed that person to take that rooster or that chicken he knows what he's doing if it's a real safe he still knows what he's doing if it's somebody that's hungry he still knows what he is doing just relax rest yourself in his case and say lord you take that away you must be going to give me something better maybe you're going to give me something more you see when you get under the spirit of revelation you don't work up and worry and wonder you trust the lord in all things and you don't go and pray any prayer like that upon people for we are servants of the living god so let me say it in that colloquial way and let me say it in this way let us become living voices to a living man living women living young women living young men living children our life becomes the voice of god to the age in which we are living in oh glory to god hallelujah amen amen praise god because your life becomes the sunda that shakes the devil it scares the devil you ever heard a thunder roll the lightning flash when that sun i don't care who it is when that lightning suddenly cracks and it shines out for the glory of god somebody's begins to shake somebody's scared nervous oh my because it's god speaking oh my of course the scientists say the voice is the winds clashing the clash that's the scientific explanation winds clashing together and they create that cracking sound symbolic of the voice of god amen speaking to his children amen god on the mountain god speaking and thunder and lightning amen praise god forevermore amen praise god brother sister that's the way it is when we put our faith in him and trust him god send us out in life and in love amen speaking to us in every possible way for his glory the voice the voice of the resurrection but that voice of the resurrection with that voice comes within his people brother branham says here not just their voice anymore not just a voice but voices amen hallelujah for god has now multiplied himself god has now reproduced himself and now that voice has now become voices around the world thousands millions of voices that are speaking out and testifying of this message as paul said regardless of their understanding of it their pre some are preaching it may have a great understanding some are mixed up some are tangled up in every way but paul said regardless nevertheless christ is preached amen somebody listen this message is a miracle message it's a mysterious miraculous powerful message not because i am saying it or not because i am speaking in such an animated form amen but just to let you know this is a message of power and the last day glory of god bought former and latter reign falling in these monks the power of god and the spirit of the living god amen over in africa one man amen went one preacher went to preach the gospel and when he went to preach the gospel the people in that part of the jungle were against anybody coming in to preach that the word the gospel they don't know any different they just know their animist beliefs and so they came after him with bow and spare and he started running for his life and he came to a river and he got to get over and there in the river crocodiles on every side oh my my my and he didn't know what to do and he heard the voices of the people coming with their spears and he kneeled down to pray he said lord i'm in this in this place here and they're going if they kill me nobody will even know i'm gone oh and that will be it i'll be finished lord please help me and while he was praying he heard the voices further and further and further away so he opened his eyes to see what happened when he opened his eyes he was on the other side of the river and he don't know how he got there oh my no wonder the old negro spiritual says how i got over my soul looked back and wonder how i got over i don't even know how i got over but god took him over just like he took philip from samaria right into the desert and he doesn't know he doesn't feel anything yet he god did it by his power and by his glory i remember another precious brother that was converted minister converted under uh this ministry that god has given me he heard the word but when he heard it right then he didn't believe it but one day he went out being a member of pentecostal denomination to preach and on his way back the rain began to thunder and lightning and rain begins to fall torrential rains he decided to go under a house in those days houses were built like on stilts and you could go out to the bottom of that house in those old days so he went there to shelter from the rain there was a workbench and so he decided as the rain kept falling and falling longer and longer and he was going to lay there so he laid on the bench unless he's laid there look on the ceiling he noticed that there were creases in the floor and so somebody took paper and pasted it up to block your vision from seeing into the house or into the flow or through the floor and when he looked up he began to read so he he raised up he stood up and he started reading and he started reading and he started reading and the next thing you know brother sister he came and sought for me and told me brother simon i got to be baptized oh praise god i baptized him he got out of that denomination so fast and begin to preach the word and god used him and raised up a couple of churches and he kept preaching the glory of god you say brother samuel what was it that he read you know what happened somebody that was given one of the spoken word books voice of god that took the book in there and tore it and used the pages to paste it under the house just a block out amen the creases the holes in the floor but god allowed that because god already knew a man that he wanted a seed of god a son a daughter of god a son of god was coming and he lay there and on his back and sometimes god gotta put a lot of us on our back through sickness through knocking off of a high horse of pride and accomplishment knock you off whatever horse you were riding on so you can come to your senses and recognize the voice of the true voice of the living god but there it was the voice of god the pages of the book was pasted and he read them and he became converted with nobody else there but he himself i know of another situation where i had taken my church and we had distributed tracks and books in another town from where i was ministering in and you know a brother went to his job and on the job he had a very good friend who was a muslim a muslim man and they were very friendly and so the muslim man invited him to come to his home and so he decided i'm gonna i'm gonna go with him this afternoon and so he went to that man's home and when he got to that man's home he started trying to witness a little bit to him the message or the word of god and then he said and then he spoke when he spoke the word that that muslim man turned to him and said uh me i won't believe any body else except the prophet william branham so the brother was stunned he said the prophet william branham what do you know about william branham he said well what one day i went out to throw out my garbage and when i look in the garbage can i saw a book in there and i took that book a sermon preached by william branham and when i read it the oh it changed my life completely when i come out from

thing amen oh praise god nothing but judgment nothing but doom lies ahead of you oh my friend amen nothing like the voices he said voices the voices of the thunders what is it the voices of the church ages the voices of these meetings like this amen these meetings the voices of the people when they begin to praise god magnify glorify and honor his mighty name amen the voices of these meetings amen hallelujah brother sister let me tell you something just before you leave this natural life to move into the next realm you're going to start hearing all kind of voices is either you're going to hear the voices of the devil or you're going to hear god's voice but naturally sometimes when people are crossing over they begin to hear the voice of their uncle their mother their father their brother and sometimes you'll be able to witness they begin to talk back to them as if they were right in the room you know what that is they're actually beginning to cross over from one dimension to the other from one realm to the other hallelujah oh praise god i believe i'm friends i'm going to begin to wind down stop right here because let me tell you praise god amen that that's the way we are also fixing to go in the rapture and we will talk about that next week how the holy spirit is going to say not all of you are going to die and have to experience that but some of you while you're alive and
