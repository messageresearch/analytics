[0:00] but him. What a what a blessing. It's a
[0:04] fighter not only to preach it but to
[0:06] live it and to get to that place with
[0:08] God to overcome yourselves. But when you
[0:10] get to that place, saints, what a
[0:13] blessed place. It's a place that you've
[0:16] always desired and always wanted to be.
[0:18] Get there.
[0:20] Don't stop. Don't look to the right, to
[0:23] the left. Don't listen to any other
[0:26] voice but what the word has said.
[0:27] Hallelujah.
[0:29] get in the word. Thank you, Lord.
[0:33] Let's pray.
[0:34] [Music]
[0:38] Father, you
[0:43] Jesus.
[0:46] [Music]
[0:48] Oh God, we're yours, Lord.
[0:52] [Music]
[0:55] You have spoken this
[0:58] morning by your
[1:05] spirit, the word of
[1:07] [Music]
[1:10] God. I believe that with all my heart,
[1:15] Father, this is not pride of who I am.
[1:18] I'm nothing, Lord.
[1:22] I don't deserve anything of your
[1:24] blessings, Lord, that you give
[1:26] me. But I desire one thing,
[1:30] Father. to look into your face on that
[1:34] day and hear you
[1:39] say been so rejected from the world and
[1:42] so rejected for
[1:46] people so put down at
[1:49] times but just to hear you say well done
[1:52] good and faithful
[1:53] servant enter
[1:56] in all that matters to me
[1:59] Lord I I know without your spirit in
[2:02] your life and what the cross did for me,
[2:07] Lord, I wouldn't be able
[2:10] to have this privilege, Father, to walk
[2:14] with you, talk with you.
[2:19] Oh, God. It's
[2:21] not man that the bride is looking to
[2:23] anymore, Father. She's only looking at
[2:25] one man, and that's you.
[2:28] I pray this morning,
[2:30] Father, that only you could do. I'm
[2:34] asking only something that you can do,
[2:37] Father. You asked me to believe and I
[2:40] believe this morning, Father, you asked
[2:42] the people to
[2:45] believe. Father, I'm asking you to to to
[2:48] set the people free. I'm not saying that
[2:51] this flesh is not going to bother that
[2:53] the sin the sin will always be in this
[2:55] flesh, Lord. We know that by the word. I
[2:57] hope we see that this morning, Father.
[3:00] This card of mind will always be there.
[3:01] That's that it always struggle and fight
[3:03] against us, Lord. We stick you right to
[3:05] the end. But there's something greater.
[3:07] That's right. What I'm asking for is
[3:10] deliverance, Lord. To set the people
[3:12] free from the unbelief that's in their
[3:14] heart that makes them believe that they
[3:18] are that man. But they are not that man.
[3:22] That man has been redeemed. Hallelujah.
[3:27] There's nails in your hands, Lord.
[3:31] Holes, because you redeemed this flesh.
[3:35] Your body was torn
[3:38] apart. So now, even though I'm walking
[3:40] in this body,
[3:42] Lord, and I'm seeing the sin in this
[3:44] body, and I'm doing things that I don't
[3:47] want to do, and things I should do, I'm
[3:48] not doing at times, I can still have the
[3:52] joy of the Lord. I still have the faith
[3:54] to believe and walk with God.
[3:57] That's right. I still can get victory,
[4:00] Lord.
[4:02] And so can your people, Father. That's
[4:04] right. Let them believe that in their
[4:06] hearts this morning, Father.
[4:09] And I believe every devil that's holding
[4:11] them back, lying to them, trapping them,
[4:15] keeping them in prison will loose this
[4:19] morning. Father, hallelujah.
[4:22] only believe
[4:24] in the name of Jesus Christ. As you
[4:26] believe for your need this morning, do
[4:29] you believe his word this morning? In
[4:32] the name of Jesus, in my name, you'll
[4:34] cast out devils.
[4:37] Speak the word and go forth. Loose the
[4:40] people, Satan. Yes, Lord. Every sin
[4:43] that's holding them and trapped with
[4:45] their souls,
[4:47] loose them this morning in the name of
[4:49] Jesus Christ. Every spirit of
[4:51] condemnation, guilt, every spirit of
[4:54] fear, every lying spirit from the pits
[4:57] of
[4:59] hell, every spirit, complex spirits,
[5:05] demon from hell that's holding through
[5:08] the body of this flesh,
[5:10] you loose them this morning in the name
[5:12] of Jesus Christ.
[5:16] Believe his word.
[5:21] Oh Lord,
[5:24] Jesus.
[5:28] [Music]
[5:31] Hallelujah.
[5:35] Hallelujah.
[5:39] Oh, glory to God.
[5:41] Jesus.
[5:44] Oh, worship him, saints.
[5:48] Release yourself.
[5:51] Release yourself.
[5:54] Believe.
[5:56] Release that believing.
[5:59] Release that believing.
[6:02] Believe his word this morning.
[6:05] Thank you, Lord. In the name of Jesus, I
[6:08] believe. Lord, I in the name of Jesus, I
[6:12] believe. I give you my soul. Oh yes,
[6:15] Lord.
[6:20] Yes. Worship her. Worship her.
[6:25] He'll
[6:29] [Music]
[6:30] come for
[6:35] your Lord. I give you my
[6:39] heart. I give you my soul.
[6:43] [Music]
[6:45] I live for you.
[6:49] I everywhere
[6:53] [Music]
[6:58] I have
[7:03] your Lord. I give you my
[7:07] heart. I give you my soul.
[7:11] [Music]
[7:13] I live for
[7:17] you.
[7:19] Every
[7:21] [Music]
[7:28] single way.
