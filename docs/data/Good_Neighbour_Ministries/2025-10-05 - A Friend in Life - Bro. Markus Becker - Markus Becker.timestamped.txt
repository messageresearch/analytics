[8:00] God bless you, saints. Good to be in the

[8:04] Good to be here this morning. Amen.
[8:07] Hallelujah. We're going to read from uh
[8:10] Psalms 5.
[8:13] Hallelujah.
[8:15] Give ear to my words, O Lord.
[8:18] Consider my meditation.
[8:22] Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my
[8:25] king and my God.
[8:28] For unto thee I will pray. My voice
[8:32] shalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord.
[8:35] I hope you heard your voice this
[8:37] morning. Hallelujah. In the morning will
[8:40] I direct my prayers unto thee, and I
[8:43] will look up.
[8:45] For thou art not a god that had pleasure
[8:48] in wickedness, neither shall evil dwell
[8:51] with thee. The foolish shall not stand
[8:54] in thy sight. Thou hatest all works of
[8:57] iniquity.
[9:00] Thou shalt destroy them that seek le.
[9:03] The Lord will uphold the bloody and
[9:06] deceitful men. But as for me, I will
[9:10] come into thy house in the multitude of
[9:13] thy mercy, and in thy fear, which means
[9:16] respect, will I worship towards thy holy
[9:20] temple. Lead me, O Lord, in thy
[9:23] righteousness because of my enemies.
[9:26] Make thy way straight before my face,
[9:30] for there is no faithfulness in their
[9:32] mouth. Their inward parts is very
[9:36] wickedness. Their throat is an open
[9:39] sepure. They flattered with their
[9:41] tongue. Destroy thou them, oh God. Let
[9:46] them fall by their own counsel. cast
[9:50] them out in the multitude of their
[9:52] transgression, for they have rebelled
[9:55] against thee.
[9:57] But let all those that put their trust
[10:00] in thee rejoice. Amen. That's us this
[10:03] morning. Hallelujah. Let them shout for
[10:06] joy because thou defendest them. Let
[10:10] them also that love the name be joyful
[10:14] in thee. For thou, Lord, will bless the
[10:18] righteous with favor, and thou will
[10:20] compass him as with a shield. Oh,
[10:24] blessed be the name of the Lord. I'm
[10:26] glad this morning. Amen. That his favor
[10:30] is upon my life. God bless you.
[10:40] Amen.

[13:16] me out.
[13:23] Oh

[13:30] as far removed as darkness is from
[13:35] the sea of God's forgetfulness. It's

[39:38] from time to time. That's wonderful. But
[39:40] when you come to meet with him, you're
[39:43] coming to meet with me. You're coming to
[39:45] unite with the word. We are the word.
[39:48] Amen. And you've you've got a revelation
[39:50] now that you've got a part in the word
[39:52] and that you've you've got something
[39:54] that you that you've got to do. Amen.
[39:56] You've got a purpose of God laying
[39:58] within you by the Holy Ghost. Amen. And
[40:01] this so you can't you can't wait for
[40:03] those doors to open. Amen. Praise God. I
[40:06] was excited when I when I was told, you
[40:08] know, Sister Saron and Brother Daniel
[40:11] and uh telling me that Brother Marcus
[40:13] was going to be coming through. I didn't
[40:15] really know Brother Marcus, but I
[40:16] thought, "Okay, I I've heard good
[40:18] things, though." And so I said, "I'm
[40:20] going to I'm just going to peek in on
[40:22] him a little bit." And I peaked in on
[40:24] him a little bit. Amen. And I listened
[40:26] to, you know, a couple of services. I
[40:28] fell in love with him.
[40:30] I said, "Glory to God." I said, "It's
[40:33] the same Holy Ghost."
[40:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. That burns within the hearts of
[40:37] the bride. You know, this is how you
[40:39] know that that you're you're in the
[40:41] body. Amen. This is the thunders. This
[40:44] is the unwritten part of the word that
[40:46] you can't explain it, but you just love
[40:48] them. You just you just know there's a
[40:50] unity. There's a faith. Amen. That that
[40:52] that burns within our hearts is because
[40:55] we love him.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a love for him and
[41:00] automatically you feel his love towards
[41:03] you. Amen. Praise God. And so I'm very
[41:06] privileged today to honor our precious
[41:09] brother right here at our pulpit. Amen.
[41:12] I believe that if you've come with
[41:14] expectation in your hearts, you are
[41:16] going to leave rejoicing. Amen. I
[41:19] believe that with all of my heart. We
[41:20] had such a wonderful time here. A men's
[41:22] fellowship. We came here just expecting
[41:25] him to just, you know, share a few
[41:27] words. Well, the Lord Jesus showed up.
[41:30] Amen. And he he just he just laid it all
[41:34] on into our hearts and he just
[41:36] vindicated exactly where we are the day
[41:38] that we're living in. And it's exciting,
[41:40] saints. Amen. So, at this time, I'd like
[41:42] to invite our precious brother Marcus.
[41:44] God bless you, my brother. Have the
[41:46] liberty of the Holy Spirit on your
[41:48] heart. Amen. We certainly love and
[41:50] appreciate you.
[41:55] [Applause]
[41:57] [Music]
[42:16] [Music]
[42:25] Father, may you just speak to them.
[42:28] Thank you, brother. And Lord, may you
[42:32] give me the right words to express and
[42:34] may you give the right hearts to
[42:36] understand what I want to say. Father,
[42:39] bless the church back home in
[42:40] Beaslesburg. Bless the bride here in
[42:43] Canada. Father, wherever they gather
[42:45] this morning and please, Father, may you
[42:47] bless Israel because those who bless
[42:49] Israel, they are blessed. Father,
[42:52] &gt;&gt; so we ask these things in the name of
[42:54] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother, for the So, let's
[43:03] while we're standing, let's open the
[43:04] word of the Lord
[43:06] in the first book of Kings. And in my
[43:08] Bible, it's page 481, but it doesn't
[43:12] tell you much, but it's first Kings
[43:14] chapter 20 verse one.
[43:18] First Kings 20 verse one.
[43:22] And Benhadat
[43:24] the king of Syria gathered all the hosts
[43:27] together. And there were 30 and two
[43:29] kings with him, horses and chariots, and
[43:32] went and besieged Samaria and wared
[43:35] against it. And he sent messengers to
[43:37] Ahab, king of Israel, into the city, and
[43:40] said unto him, thus sayest Benhad, "Thy
[43:43] silver, and thy gold is mine, and thy
[43:46] wives also, and thy children, even the
[43:49] goodliest, are mine." And the king of
[43:52] Israel answered and said, "My Lord, O
[43:54] king, according to thy saying, I'm
[43:55] thine, and all that I have." And the
[43:58] messengers came again and said, "Thus
[44:01] speakest Ben Hadat, saying, Although I
[44:03] have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt
[44:06] deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and
[44:09] thy wives, and thy children." Amen. And
[44:12] we read from
[44:14] verse 28,
[44:18] same chapter. And there came a man of
[44:20] God and spake unto the king of Israel
[44:24] and said, "Thus sayaeth the Lord,
[44:26] because the Syrians have said, 'The Lord
[44:29] is the God of the hills, but he is not
[44:31] the God of the valleys, therefore will I
[44:34] deliver all this great multitude into
[44:37] thy hand, and you shall know that I am
[44:40] the Lord."
[44:42] &gt;&gt; May the Lord add his blessing to the
[44:43] reading office where we may be seated.
[44:46] and I greet you all very warmly and I
[44:49] really thank Pastor Danny for the nice
[44:51] invitation, for the real welcoming
[44:53] spirits and the nice words. It's a great
[44:56] honor for me to be here and I heard many
[44:59] good things about this church, its
[45:01] former pastor. We met uh at the at the
[45:04] at the uh marriage of of of Tina and and
[45:09] um Daniel and uh we had a very good
[45:12] impression and now the same very good
[45:15] impression when we met you brother. It's
[45:17] a great honor to be here and I thank you
[45:19] very much for that for that time. Um I
[45:22] remember years ago when brother Tim
[45:24] Humes when he was in the message I was
[45:26] preaching there and when I was there for
[45:29] the first time he was a little bit
[45:30] taking too much time and he thought I
[45:32] was nervous so he said please church you
[45:35] must understand brother Marcus is one of
[45:37] those Hitler boys
[45:39] and I was sitting in the did did I hear
[45:43] anything wrong so we are not Hitler boys
[45:45] okay
[45:47] we are we are family of God okay we are
[45:50] friends Okay. And uh I really really
[45:53] love that place the way you made up the
[45:55] church. I heard that some precious
[45:57] sisters had their good input into it and
[46:00] and it looks very nice and the character
[46:02] of the people. So it's a great joy and
[46:04] friends are predestinated. Anyhow, so
[46:07] definitely so when when when Sarin and
[46:09] when when Tina left, I mean they they
[46:13] are I don't say it just by politeness
[46:15] but they are very very precious sister
[46:17] you know both of them really and they
[46:19] have a clear vision where to go they
[46:21] have an understanding of of spiritual
[46:24] things and uh we found out that both
[46:26] Danny's are very wonderful gentlemen you
[46:29] know real brothers and we are very
[46:31] confident that they will make their way
[46:33] with the lord so we're really we are
[46:35] really at peace, you know, and um uh
[46:38] we're very happy for this a fine church.
[46:41] Brother Garrett, the pastor sends his
[46:43] greeting. Andreas Ringan, another pastor
[46:45] sends his greeting. the whole church in
[46:46] Beaslesburg send a greeting and it's for
[46:49] us it was honestly it was a loss because
[46:51] uh I mean Sarin because of the music and
[46:54] because of of her taste or her feeling
[46:57] for design and uh being a really a loyal
[47:00] sister and Tina uh really one of the
[47:03] helpers in the youth meetings okay
[47:05] really an organizer and so we we we we
[47:09] didn't have a brain drain in Germany but
[47:11] we had a heart drain in in Germany and
[47:13] so we are praying that God will will
[47:15] will restore us some good people and so
[47:17] you are fortunate to have good uh people
[47:20] coming from from Germany over here to
[47:23] &gt;&gt; to to just be a part of the of the of
[47:26] the whole dream team let me say like
[47:27] this the dream team
[47:33] so this morning I thank again uh I know
[47:36] as you don't know me and there must be
[47:39] some questions in your heart who's
[47:41] brother Marcus beside that uh he comes
[47:44] from Germany what does the belief. So,
[47:46] so I thank you again for the confidence
[47:48] and I would like if that is fine for me
[47:50] that I will just share things from my
[47:53] heart. Huh? And and I have no notes but
[47:56] I have I always work with some pictures
[47:58] and it gives me always a red line to
[48:00] that I don't miss my subject. And uh
[48:03] there's even a little video and we are
[48:05] not normally in in Christian churches we
[48:08] don't have videos but I have uh just two
[48:11] minutes. It's nothing ugly. Okay, it's
[48:13] fit for a church. Okay, don't fear.
[48:16] Okay, fear not. But it's not believers.
[48:19] Okay, but I will explain you later. So,
[48:21] please don't uh don't be offended by
[48:24] this. It's just let's let's say I felt
[48:27] on my heart. Let's make a a little youth
[48:29] meeting this morning. Okay. A little
[48:31] youth meeting. Okay. Amen.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And that's what I want to say. The
[48:34] youth up to 80. Okay.
[48:37] And and if you're older than 80, you are
[48:39] you you can leave but only with
[48:41] permission of the parents. Okay.
[48:43] [Music]
[48:43] [Laughter]
[48:46] And and I would like I would like I
[48:48] would like to not to preach at you but
[48:51] to share things even from life
[48:52] experience. And I would like to entitled
[48:55] that sermon a friend in life. A friend
[48:59] in life. Now we realized that the
[49:03] message of the hour that we believe does
[49:05] not come from America.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennan was just a voice. It's
[49:10] not an American message. It's not a
[49:12] Brandon message. It's not a
[49:14] Jeffersonville message.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; It comes from the presence of Almighty.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour is not a cult.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; Why should I become cultish?
[49:25] &gt;&gt; We have too much churches in the
[49:26] message. What they play is cold war.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; But cold war pertains to Europe.
[49:33] Okay. This message that we believe is
[49:35] not a sect.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Why should I become sectarian?
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. The message that we believe is not
[49:40] a denomination. Why should I become
[49:42] denominational?
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Why should I play the game of the devil?
[49:46] &gt;&gt; And when I'm traveling around, I said,
[49:48] "Look, you have to understand not
[49:50] everybody in the message is mature."
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Not everybody is spiritual. You never
[49:56] uncchristianize people. You never you
[49:58] never put them out of the plan of God
[50:00] because God said to brother Bram, "Mom,
[50:01] always love you. All that you love will
[50:03] be there." But there's still time to
[50:06] grow,
[50:07] &gt;&gt; to take childish things away.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; God will not the marriage, the the the
[50:12] rapture will not God will not marry a
[50:14] baby,
[50:15] &gt;&gt; not a teenager.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; God will marry a woman. She knows where
[50:19] she comes from. She knows where she's
[50:21] standing. You have do not have to baby
[50:22] her around. And so we understand the
[50:26] message of the hour is is it is the
[50:28] voice of our father.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. And by that I remember when I was
[50:35] younger and my age uh we in Germany when
[50:39] we had German courses we had to make
[50:41] interpretations of the book. We have
[50:44] great writers in Germany like Gert like
[50:47] Schiller I think for America is like
[50:49] like William Faulner is that correct?
[50:52] Shakespeare
[50:52] &gt;&gt; Shakespeare for example. Okay. And at a
[50:55] certain but he was not American. So
[50:57] don't please
[50:59] okay
[51:04] your doctrine is no no taxation without
[51:07] representation. Huh? We we message
[51:10] believe we think about the theophony in
[51:11] the rep representation but the the first
[51:14] father's day. But let me talk about
[51:15] Shakespeare. You're completely right
[51:17] brother.
[51:18] And I remember when we were when I was
[51:21] 17 18 years old that we were reading
[51:23] these books and I want to be honest with
[51:25] you I had no idea
[51:27] uh what what is the intention of the
[51:29] writer and I thought what is the
[51:31] intention of the writer ask him why do
[51:32] you ask me okay what is the intention of
[51:35] the writer so after all these years my
[51:39] daughter she she was in school and uh
[51:43] what happened is that she was reading
[51:44] the same books that I was in school for
[51:47] interpretation that I was reading when I
[51:49] was a young person. So one night I
[51:51] couldn't sleep. So I took one of those
[51:53] Schiller books, those Gerta books and I
[51:56] was reading and everything became clear.
[51:59] Everything was clear. I mean there's
[52:00] little little just little mentions and I
[52:03] understood what is going around. Okay. I
[52:05] I could I could read between the lines.
[52:08] But what does it mean? The book was the
[52:11] same
[52:12] &gt;&gt; but God changed the reader of that book.
[52:14] Amen.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; You must understand when brother Brmond
[52:17] said the Bible became a new book, God
[52:19] didn't change the Bible, but God came in
[52:21] this generation with the mind of Christ.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; So we can read the Bible different.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; So it takes all the radicalism away
[52:31] &gt;&gt; because the Bible says in the in the
[52:32] days of the voice of the seventh angel,
[52:36] the mystery, not mysteries.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Scoffield had mysteries. Some of them
[52:42] were correct, some were not correct. But
[52:44] the mystery means God reveals who he is,
[52:47] &gt;&gt; how he thinks.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; And therefore, we can be transformed in
[52:51] the image of God because now we
[52:52] understand our father.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; We tried Pentecostalism, it never
[52:56] worked.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; We tried reformation, it never worked.
[53:00] We tried we tried free love, it never
[53:03] worked. I mean, we tried
[53:05] denominationism, it never worked. But
[53:07] what worked is the word of the Lord.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. placed in our hearts.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; So, so, so let's take that uh that uh
[53:15] little story here that we have a king of
[53:18] Israel and we have an an opponent by the
[53:21] name of Benhadat.
[53:23] And Benhadat, he he comes to be a uh how
[53:28] do you call a challenger. He challenges
[53:32] Israel.
[53:33] And brother Brandon says he says Elvis
[53:36] Presley came to challenge the church
[53:40] as he learned these maneuvers in the
[53:42] Pentecostal church at that time. We come
[53:44] out of Pentecost. So therefore we
[53:46] understand very well. So we must
[53:50] understand there's a lot of things
[53:51] today. I see the cell phones. I see the
[53:54] internet. I see many many things which
[53:56] are challenges
[53:58] and we have to find an answer for this.
[54:02] Legalism will never make it.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; Legalism is fit to frustrate the people.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it takes revelation.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; It takes substance.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Okay. So in all these years, we didn't
[54:17] become more worldly. We have the same
[54:20] standard as we has in the beginning. But
[54:22] we we were leaving that kind of
[54:25] legalistic foolishness that we were
[54:27] under.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we were younger, we want to
[54:29] be more spiritual than brother Brandon.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; But every legalist is a person who is
[54:35] insecure in his heart.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; That's his problem. He needs the rules.
[54:39] And more rules, the more happy he is.
[54:42] But our rule is the Holy Ghost.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen?
[54:47] &gt;&gt; I said we will not keep the church clean
[54:49] by more pressure. What the church keeps
[54:52] clean is the Holy Ghost in the church.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so we understand that God sent
[55:00] a man and says to the king at Ahab at
[55:03] that time. So, be be of good cheer
[55:07] because I will protect you.
[55:10] If you have your own children, brother,
[55:12] when I was young, we were legalists, but
[55:13] I got children, at least one daughter.
[55:16] When you have children, you turn from a
[55:18] legalist to a realist.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; And you find out in your life that you
[55:23] can do nothing without God. Amen.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; If it's not God's time, you will not
[55:29] change anything.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; And God, the Holy Ghost is there first
[55:33] to change things. But until God changes
[55:35] them, we need uh
[55:39] patience
[55:40] &gt;&gt; to just care, just lay everything into
[55:43] God's hands. So God gave them the great
[55:46] victory and they came back. And the
[55:48] problem for the uh Syrians, they didn't
[55:51] know Jehovah Gyra. They thought he is
[55:54] the God of the mountains. And so God
[55:58] sent a messenger and said, "Look, I will
[56:01] show them. I'm the God who cares for you
[56:06] &gt;&gt; in the valleys and on the mountains."
[56:09] &gt;&gt; I'm not the God of Sunday morning.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; I'm not a God of a convention.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Brother, this message is not a doctrine.
[56:17] This message is a relationship
[56:19] &gt;&gt; between our father and us. Amen.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; And my father is my bridegroom.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; And my father is my king. And my father
[56:26] is my savior. And my father is my
[56:29] friend.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen?
[56:32] &gt;&gt; So before we enter in some of the things
[56:34] of life circumstances for young people,
[56:37] let's go a little bit into the spiritual
[56:39] part. And if the technicians will help
[56:41] me. When I'm preaching to the young
[56:44] people, I will always have a part uh for
[56:49] the adults. Let me call them adults.
[56:51] something really spiritual meat. When
[56:53] I'm preaching to the adult, I have
[56:55] always included a part for the young
[56:56] people so that everybody leaves the
[56:58] church without having with with having
[57:00] anything. So I don't know if that if
[57:02] that wording is correct because I was
[57:05] just translating it this morning by
[57:07] Google translator.
[57:10] But when you deal with people, you must
[57:12] make a difference. when when is a person
[57:15] unable to do something or when he
[57:19] doesn't want to change something. Okay,
[57:23] there's a big difference. We should
[57:25] never throw the baby with the bath. You
[57:30] must find out does the person not can
[57:34] that isn't he able to do it or doesn't
[57:37] he want to do it? a person comes and and
[57:40] to make myself clear we want to help
[57:42] this morning people who are not able let
[57:45] me say who are not st who are standing
[57:47] in their own way who want to be
[57:50] different but they cannot change unless
[57:51] god changes them but I want to make that
[57:54] thing clear as you don't know me as a
[57:56] person if somebody says look I want to I
[57:59] want to live in in free love I want to
[58:01] have three three girlfriends I want to
[58:04] drink I want to smoke but at the same
[58:06] time I want to sing here in the choir
[58:09] Now I would say you can live as much as
[58:10] you want but not here
[58:13] &gt;&gt; because this is the church of the living
[58:14] God.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Okay? If you choose to live your own
[58:18] life, live your own life but not here.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; But there is people who are always
[58:23] trespassing
[58:25] and they don't want to do it. And these
[58:27] people we have to give a helping hand.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Okay? Because we are not helping people
[58:33] by just dis by just uh uh disrespecting
[58:37] them. This world needs a needs a a
[58:41] helping hand for those who want.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Okay, can you say amen?
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Did I make myself clear? Okay, we are
[58:49] not we are not inviting every spirit
[58:52] into our churches.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; We're not inviting them. If you want to
[58:56] live your life, live your life. Okay.
[58:58] But you're inviting people who wants to
[59:00] receive the Holy Ghost
[59:01] &gt;&gt; and those who want to be right with God.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; But sometime it takes a long time until
[59:07] they come into a victorious life and
[59:10] then it takes that church who has a
[59:12] feeling for the human part of people.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Okay, that is the the balance in all
[59:18] things. Okay, if you help me with the
[59:20] next thing. So first we have to
[59:22] understand one thing
[59:25] brother Blame said. So he first was God
[59:28] Jehovah and out of him let's just
[59:30] picture now as a little drama so you can
[59:32] get it. Let's see coming out of space
[59:35] where there was nothing. Let's make it a
[59:37] little white light like a mystic light
[59:39] like a halo. And that was the logos that
[59:41] went out of God in the beginning. That
[59:43] was the son of God that came out of the
[59:45] bosom of the father. That was what was
[59:48] in the beginning was the word and the
[59:50] word was with God and the word was God
[59:52] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[59:54] among us. In the beginning was God and
[59:56] then out of God came the logos. A part
[59:58] of God that went out of God.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Look there is a difference and brother
[1:00:03] Bra said the first thing and if I walk
[1:00:05] around again that's good for you. Okay.
[1:00:07] Yeah. Uh you therefore you understand
[1:00:10] I'm not a German. Huh? The only thing
[1:00:12] the only thing that I know I'm a German
[1:00:14] because I always have a white shirt. A
[1:00:16] German when you pray have a white shirt
[1:00:18] and long sleeves. You know
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; it's not in the message.
[1:00:25] It's not in the Bible. It's pure
[1:00:27] culture.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; So, so we when we were younger, we were
[1:00:31] fighting for cultures. Now we understood
[1:00:35] I mean cultures are cultures. Opinions
[1:00:36] are like noses. Everyone has one. Okay.
[1:00:40] Okay.
[1:00:43] So, so brother says the first thing that
[1:00:47] God created were the angels. Here he
[1:00:50] says the first thing that came out of
[1:00:52] God was logos. That was I will not have
[1:00:55] time but that was the beginning or that
[1:00:58] was the reason for Constantine inviting
[1:01:01] the people for the council of Nika
[1:01:06] because they wanted to find out if Jesus
[1:01:08] was divine or not. Is he part of the
[1:01:11] godhead or not? Okay. Is he just a
[1:01:15] special man?
[1:01:17] You see and we find out some people said
[1:01:19] if you see the father you see me and the
[1:01:21] other group said yes but Jesus said my
[1:01:23] god my god why does thou have forsaken
[1:01:26] me. So there were different quotes.
[1:01:28] Okay. So if I take my life I build it up
[1:01:33] many many things. I created a house. I
[1:01:36] built many many things but I only burst
[1:01:39] one daughter. Amen.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; The difference between my creation and
[1:01:43] my birth was part of me is in my
[1:01:47] daughter.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; My DNA is in my daughter.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; So there is a difference between
[1:01:53] creations and part of God.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; All the angels were created
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; but the family of God is part of him.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; There's a big difference.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; That is your worth.
[1:02:08] That's your dignity.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Please understand when we preach, we are
[1:02:13] not preaching to colors.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; We preach to theophanes.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; So please don't come to me with inferior
[1:02:21] complex because of races or superior
[1:02:24] complexes because of races. I we are
[1:02:27] what we are by the grace of God.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's let let's forget these
[1:02:35] childy things of trying to play the
[1:02:38] victim. You must understand the history.
[1:02:39] I'm not interested in the history. I'm
[1:02:41] interested in the word.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; So, so you must understand that brother
[1:02:47] Brandham says the as Eve was in Adam.
[1:02:50] Amen. The bride was in Christ.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. You remember when God called Adam,
[1:02:56] he says, "Adam, where are you?" Two
[1:02:58] people came
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; because Eve had no name. She got her
[1:03:03] name when she fell.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Eve was part of Adam. God called Adam,
[1:03:07] where are you? Two people came.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; So when when when when when the logos
[1:03:12] came out of God, it was not another
[1:03:14] person. So I feel sorry for those who
[1:03:17] believe there is two God, two persons in
[1:03:20] the Godhead because brother Brmond said
[1:03:22] go never said God created the son. God
[1:03:25] became son.
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; The human part of of Jesus Christ.
[1:03:29] That's another thing. But it's a big
[1:03:31] doctrine in itself.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Okay. But there's only one God.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. One person. No two. No two
[1:03:37] persons.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; No. No. So if the logos was part of God,
[1:03:43] okay, that logos became a theophony.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Melchazedc. I mean that Melzdc became
[1:03:50] Jesus Christ. Okay. When the bride was
[1:03:53] in Jesus Christ in what form ever? Okay.
[1:03:56] Um just quote the prophet. When the
[1:03:58] bride was in Christ, then the bride was
[1:04:00] in Melkazedc.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; And then the bride was in the pillar of
[1:04:05] fire in the beginning.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; And then the bride was in God in the
[1:04:09] beginning.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Brother, brother brother, brother
[1:04:13] brother. If you're part of God, Amen.
[1:04:16] Nobody can preach you into the bride
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; and nobody can preach you out of the
[1:04:21] bride.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; But beside the bride, there is people
[1:04:24] who will be saved. That is so important
[1:04:27] to keep a balance on the on the mercy
[1:04:29] seat on the mercy seat.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Ah, it's not only the bride. There's
[1:04:33] people who will become
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; who will get eternal life even at the
[1:04:37] white throne judgment.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; So we understand. Please make the next
[1:04:42] one. So we understand that brother says
[1:04:45] the eternal thoughts of God. Let me ask
[1:04:47] you are the thoughts of God eternal? If
[1:04:51] you can see this you will see many
[1:04:54] things.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:56] It's a gate.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; In other words, if you don't see this,
[1:04:59] you just see God send a prophet.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; But you never find yourself.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you see this, you will see many
[1:05:06] things. God is unchangeable in both
[1:05:08] essence and behavior. He is omniscience.
[1:05:10] He has never had a new thought about
[1:05:12] anything because all these thoughts he
[1:05:14] always had and always will have. And
[1:05:16] because uh he knows the end from the
[1:05:18] beginning because he's God. Thus the
[1:05:20] thoughts of God are eternal. They are
[1:05:22] real. They are not simply like a man
[1:05:25] with a blueprint he has drawn up and
[1:05:27] which one day will be translated into
[1:05:29] substance and form but they are already
[1:05:32] real eternal and part of God.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; So you must understand there is people
[1:05:40] on this earth that God was thinking
[1:05:42] about.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Okay. You you know that joke with with
[1:05:47] the German coast guard. Amen. He's he's
[1:05:50] he's not he's learning English because
[1:05:52] he has a new uh job in Canada. Okay. And
[1:05:57] he's the first day and he hears mayday
[1:06:00] mayday mayday. We are thinking and he
[1:06:03] says h what are you thinking about?
[1:06:07] That's a
[1:06:09] that's for the Germans try to speak
[1:06:11] English. Okay.
[1:06:13] What are you thinking about?
[1:06:17] There's people and if I make these
[1:06:20] little jokes not to be joke but I feel
[1:06:21] free therefore they understand. Okay.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; There's people that God thought about.
[1:06:26] God knew the end from the beginning.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; But there is people on this earth. They
[1:06:30] are the thoughts of God.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Quote brother Brandon. God in the
[1:06:35] beginning was alone with his thoughts.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; In in other words, he wasn't alone.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; In other words, he wasn't alone because
[1:06:43] his thoughts are part of God. They are
[1:06:45] eternal. They are already substance.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; And God took our lives and and and and
[1:06:51] and throwed us in seven church ages over
[1:06:55] seven continents. And God put part of
[1:06:58] himself into us because David said in
[1:07:00] the Psalms, God makes everything perfect
[1:07:04] in his time. He even places eternity
[1:07:06] into our hearts.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; And there's only one who's eternal.
[1:07:09] That's God himself. Amen.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Therefore, brother Brandham said, "God
[1:07:12] made a picture of us before the
[1:07:14] foundation of the world."
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Quote, "Brother Brandham, and here we
[1:07:17] were."
[1:07:19] [Applause]
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Therefore, a message believer has no
[1:07:24] reason to become arrogant.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; We have no reason to become arrogant
[1:07:28] because but we are proud of our father.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; So God throwed us in seven church ages
[1:07:34] over seven continents in all kind of
[1:07:36] races. And God knows one thing. When the
[1:07:38] time will be over, the family of God is
[1:07:41] complete.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; No, nobody is missing.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was the first messenger
[1:07:47] who said, "God is not anymore complete
[1:07:50] without you."
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Who could say this?
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; This Bible became a new book.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Therefore, we are privileged people.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Nobody can preach. Therefore, we cannot
[1:08:02] preach fear because nobody can preach
[1:08:04] you into the bride. Nobody can preach
[1:08:07] you out of the bright.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Please make the next one.
[1:08:11] Therefore, brother Brand says just like
[1:08:13] the little dew drop. I know it's too
[1:08:15] much chemistry, but but there's a
[1:08:17] congelling of humidity. Understand our
[1:08:19] atmosphere. And when the nights get cold
[1:08:22] and c dark, it fell from heaven and
[1:08:24] drops upon the ground. It fell from
[1:08:26] somewhere. But the next morning before
[1:08:28] the sun come up, it's laying there. The
[1:08:30] little fellow shivering. But just let
[1:08:33] the sun come up and watch it go shining.
[1:08:35] It's happy. Why? The son is going to
[1:08:37] call it right back where it come from.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; And that's the way with a Christian.
[1:08:42] Hallelujah. We know when we walk in the
[1:08:44] presence of God, something in us tell us
[1:08:46] that we come from somewhere and we are
[1:08:48] going back again by the power that is
[1:08:51] pulling us.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; You don't have to push the bride.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; God is pulling.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Therefore, we have the third pull.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen? Yeah.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Somebody something in you tells you that
[1:09:04] you come from somewhere.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; That is your dignity.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Nobody can preach you out of it.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen?
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. So when
[1:09:14] the sun comes up, God calls for the
[1:09:17] humility. Blessed be the name of the
[1:09:18] Lord that we are not in Laia anymore. We
[1:09:21] are not in darkness. But what time do we
[1:09:24] live in? It's there's a man who can turn
[1:09:26] on the light.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; It's the rising of the sun.
[1:09:30] A brother came to me and said, "Brother
[1:09:32] Marcus, we are all in Laudis here." I
[1:09:34] said, "Maybe you, but not me
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; and not me. We live in Laia because
[1:09:39] Angela Merkel is not the president in
[1:09:41] the millennium." I understand that.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Okay. Outside the world is still in LA
[1:09:47] here, but the bride is not in La is here
[1:09:49] because the bride is not poor.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; The bride is not blind. The bride is not
[1:09:54] wretched.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. This day, this scripture is
[1:09:58] fulfilled.
[1:10:00] Brother Brandham says three years ago it
[1:10:02] was a prophecy. Now it's history.
[1:10:04] Revelation 10.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; And we can say brother Brand left the
[1:10:10] scene but a greater than Solomon left is
[1:10:13] here.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; I want the color people say preach it
[1:10:18] man. Don't teach it
[1:10:21] but I'm I many time preach in Africa say
[1:10:24] brother Marcus is a black man in a white
[1:10:26] skin. That is there is and I feel really
[1:10:30] at home there God. So God bless you all.
[1:10:32] Please make the next one. So what
[1:10:34] happens now? Put on the spiritual
[1:10:35] jacket. But in my in my work I'm I'm
[1:10:39] working as a as a social worker. Okay. I
[1:10:42] help in the integration of the refugees
[1:10:45] of people coming from Syria from
[1:10:47] Afghanistan. Everything that you read in
[1:10:48] the news. Brother, you must understand
[1:10:51] even if a person is not a believer, he
[1:10:53] has a soul. Amen.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; You're never wrong in respecting people.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; You're never wrong in having a a heart
[1:10:59] for a dying world, brother.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Brother, that is what the prophet teach
[1:11:03] taught us.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; If we if if we miss the empathy, this
[1:11:07] message is just a doctrine.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; It's it just gives us a superior
[1:11:11] complex.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. But people even, you know, uh
[1:11:17] and and I have to respect them because
[1:11:18] they never came to Germany to become
[1:11:20] Christians. They are Muslims. Okay. But
[1:11:36] Thank you very much.
[1:11:43] Is that fine? All is well. I I use this.
[1:11:45] That's that's very perfect. So So these
[1:11:48] young people, they said to me, "Mr.
[1:11:50] Becca, one day we will make a good
[1:11:51] Muslim out of you." He said, "No, I
[1:11:53] don't I don't think so. I don't think
[1:11:54] that will work. But I respect you."
[1:11:56] Okay. But but but you must understand
[1:11:59] that that here comes brother Brandon
[1:12:01] speaks about amnesia.
[1:12:04] People forgot who they are. Okay? And he
[1:12:07] you can call it psychology. It's not
[1:12:09] it's the message.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; It's the message because God understands
[1:12:13] life.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Okay? Now this amnesia we are told it's
[1:12:17] caused because it had to h it's to be by
[1:12:20] a place where you cannot identify
[1:12:22] yourself. Now it's an unusual thing. I
[1:12:24] don't have it don't happen too often but
[1:12:26] it causes from a shock. Okay. Brother
[1:12:30] explains World War I these people saw
[1:12:33] all these grenades and bomb and they got
[1:12:35] a shock and that soldiers did not know
[1:12:37] anymore who they are. Okay. Worry will
[1:12:41] cause it. Therefore, gospel is always
[1:12:44] good news.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Always good news.
[1:12:48] Worry will cause it. And another thing
[1:12:51] said, brother Brandon, if uh it causes
[1:12:54] it among the people is getting between
[1:12:56] two opinions. Therefore, today you have
[1:12:59] to protect the pulpit. You cannot let
[1:13:02] everybody brings his doctrine because if
[1:13:05] you give too much rooms for nonsense
[1:13:07] even in the message, people will come
[1:13:09] into an amnesia because they are too
[1:13:12] long between two opinions. Okay? So you
[1:13:15] must understand
[1:13:17] that when Adam and Eve came upon this
[1:13:19] earth, they were not babies. They came
[1:13:21] as adults. They didn't come as a baby.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Okay? They came as adults. We came the
[1:13:28] natural way. Okay? I want to say this. I
[1:13:31] was there at the birth of my daughter.
[1:13:34] Okay.
[1:13:36] Yeah. My my wife needed one helper. I
[1:13:40] needed two.
[1:13:42] That that was honestly that was too much
[1:13:44] for me. Okay. A birth is Okay.
[1:13:48] So, we got only one. I'm thank God for
[1:13:50] this. Okay. So, what happens is this
[1:13:54] that a birth according to brother
[1:13:56] Brandham is a mess. Okay. We're
[1:13:58] changing. That's fine.
[1:14:01] A birth is a mess. Okay. So when we came
[1:14:05] on this earth, we didn't come as adults,
[1:14:07] as babies. And we came, let me say, in a
[1:14:11] complete disaster.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; You understand? Amen. It was it was a
[1:14:16] shock. A birth is a shock for the mother
[1:14:20] and for the child. Okay? So you remember
[1:14:24] the first thing when you came on earth
[1:14:26] that you got was a spanky.
[1:14:31] And the midwife said, "You will get more
[1:14:33] in life."
[1:14:36] And brother Blamy said, "Amnesia comes
[1:14:38] by a shock." And therefore, we came on
[1:14:40] the earth and we did not know who we
[1:14:42] were.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; We had complete spiritual amnesia.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; You see, but the great thing is this. We
[1:14:50] did not know who we were, but our father
[1:14:53] knew who we were.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; You understand that? I told the brothers
[1:14:58] yesterday, brother, we we we came out
[1:15:00] from from we were uncchristians. We
[1:15:02] didn't believe anything. I had two great
[1:15:05] stars in my life. There was Arnold
[1:15:06] Schwatzenegger and Sylvester Stallone.
[1:15:09] Definitely. So, because we were and I
[1:15:11] like the films and I saw one time I saw
[1:15:13] Arnold Schwatzenegger in in in a film
[1:15:16] making his breast mus.
[1:15:19] So, I started bodybuilding.
[1:15:21] Okay. I tell the brothers everything
[1:15:24] that you see here was here.
[1:15:28] It's just a change of dispensation.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:15:34] Okay. So, I want to tell the the brother
[1:15:37] don't invest too much in the body.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Keep a balance. Okay. If if you if you
[1:15:43] say, "Well, the whole day I'm just
[1:15:45] reading the Bible and then then I fear
[1:15:47] you have a religious spirit." Okay?
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; So, keep a keep a balance in all things.
[1:15:51] Okay? But if you invest in your body,
[1:15:53] it's fine. But don't forget your soul,
[1:15:55] man.
[1:15:56] to invest in your soul. Okay.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; So, what I find out when I wanted to
[1:16:00] have muscles, I'm if you want to have
[1:16:03] muscles, you cannot eat McDonald's.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; You need spiritual food in due season.
[1:16:09] Okay? You need a steak. And if you want
[1:16:11] to have spiritual muscle, you cannot eat
[1:16:13] Facebook.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Don't don't think that you are spiritual
[1:16:18] because you are posting some nonsense
[1:16:19] that the denomination do. Jesus loves
[1:16:21] you, Jesus. And that's fine. That's
[1:16:23] social. But if you want to have muscles,
[1:16:26] you must eat
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; eagle's food.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; The rest is just entertainment.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; You are not spiritual by sending little
[1:16:34] videos. That's not spiritual.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you must eat spiritual food in
[1:16:39] due season.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not even conventions will not
[1:16:45] fill that gap. You can go from
[1:16:47] convention to convention and it will
[1:16:49] never change you. But you must find the
[1:16:51] person of the word.
[1:16:53] Can you say amen?
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So please make the next one. So we
[1:16:58] understand.
[1:16:59] So we fell in life situations that we
[1:17:03] were not choosing. So when you came on
[1:17:05] this earth, nobody asked you.
[1:17:09] You wanted to you wanted to come
[1:17:10] directly into your theophony. Okay. But
[1:17:14] you landed in Toronto.
[1:17:20] Nobody asked you do you want to be male
[1:17:22] or female.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Nobody asked you.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Do you want to be rich or do you want to
[1:17:26] be poor? If God would have asked, we
[1:17:29] have all said I want to be son of Mr. uh
[1:17:32] how do you call it? Uh Rochild.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; A raw child. Okay.
[1:17:38] Nobody asked you how do you want to
[1:17:39] look?
[1:17:41] You came into a body that you don't
[1:17:42] like.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; That's very true. That's true. When when
[1:17:49] I wake up in the morning, okay, and I
[1:17:50] look in the mirror, I said, "I don't
[1:17:52] know you, but I wash you anyhow." Okay,
[1:17:56] brother. I mean, that part is funny, but
[1:17:59] some of us came into dysfunctional
[1:18:01] families, brother.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Brother, I come from a broken home. I
[1:18:05] mean, when I was 14, 15 years, not to
[1:18:07] not to be emotional right now, but they
[1:18:10] told me that I have cancer, there was
[1:18:11] nothing in me that was that was afraid
[1:18:13] to die, but I was just afraid to live. I
[1:18:16] mean at that time if you don't have a
[1:18:17] father you were just an outcast in
[1:18:19] society. You see I gave my heart to the
[1:18:22] Lord Jesus Christ at the age of 20 21
[1:18:25] and one of the first thing that God was
[1:18:26] showing to me that he was my father.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Brother brother maybe our earthly
[1:18:32] parents made a lot of trouble.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we have an heavenly father who
[1:18:38] is our true father.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; And we must understand that we don't own
[1:18:43] our own children. Our children are our
[1:18:46] brothers and sisters.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; Because if you have a little child and
[1:18:50] you have a car accident on the other
[1:18:51] side, you have the same size of the
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; theophony.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Therefore, the daughter of brother
[1:18:56] Brandon said on earth I was your little
[1:18:58] Sharon Rose.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; So life can be life can become very hard
[1:19:03] and the way with the Lord is a lot is a
[1:19:06] way with a lot of tears and it makes you
[1:19:09] to understand. Amen. Because we were way
[1:19:11] too judgmental when we were young. Okay.
[1:19:14] Again, I speak about the group who wants
[1:19:17] to be right, not those who don't care.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Okay. Make that keep that balance.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Here's here's brother Biscuit. And he
[1:19:25] tells that that that that wonderful that
[1:19:27] wonderful uh testimony. They were in
[1:19:30] Canada and it's on tape. Their brother
[1:19:32] Brandon cries out, "Young soldier, don't
[1:19:34] take your life. It's just the devil
[1:19:37] lying at you." And brother Biscuit said,
[1:19:40] "We were just driving in the car and we
[1:19:42] were waiting at a restaurant and here
[1:19:44] comes a a sergeant with a tall American
[1:19:48] soldier said, "Brother Brandham, you
[1:19:50] said young soldier, don't take your
[1:19:52] life." That is the young man. He
[1:19:54] different time wanted to take his life.
[1:19:56] And brother Bisc said, brother Brandham
[1:19:58] said, "Look, God is not in a hurry. We
[1:20:00] for first we will eat, then we will
[1:20:02] chase out those demons
[1:20:04] because God does not come too late." I
[1:20:07] will tell you as young people every
[1:20:09] decision that you do under pressure will
[1:20:11] be wrong.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Every decision that you do under
[1:20:14] pressure is a wrong decision already.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:20:18] So what happens is that brother Biscuit
[1:20:20] said when they came out of the
[1:20:21] restaurant and there was a tall American
[1:20:23] soldier
[1:20:25] and little brother Brandon that they
[1:20:27] went into that area and they went alone
[1:20:29] and at some time brother Brandon just
[1:20:31] lifted up his head and they were just
[1:20:34] praying and the boy turned around he
[1:20:36] said I'm free I'm free I'm free and they
[1:20:40] were just shaking hands and brother
[1:20:42] Brandon asked brother Biscuit do you
[1:20:43] know the boy he said no he said then I
[1:20:45] will explain you he's a Christian. He
[1:20:48] has a family. He has children. But when
[1:20:50] he was in the army, he fell in
[1:20:52] homosexual acts.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he was so embarrassed. And
[1:20:57] when I lift up my hand, the Lord Jesus
[1:21:00] came down and revealed where the problem
[1:21:01] is.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; You see, here is a person who wants to
[1:21:04] be right, but he was trapped in life.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; And God has a way.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Please understand that this Bible needs
[1:21:14] an upgrade.
[1:21:16] You cannot just say homosexuality is
[1:21:19] because Romans 1 says they they worship
[1:21:22] the creation instead of the creator when
[1:21:25] brother Brandham says today we live in a
[1:21:27] time where homosexuality comes from
[1:21:29] hybrid food
[1:21:31] that never existed in Paul's time.
[1:21:33] Therefore, the angel of the church age
[1:21:36] catches the mystery for his church age.
[1:21:39] Amen. So for the Bible is not enough to
[1:21:42] bring us into the rapture. Amen.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Please understand as we were seeing
[1:21:46] yesterday, the Bible is a book which is
[1:21:49] progressive.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; In the time of Paul, I'm a dead part of
[1:21:53] the Bible was not written. God later put
[1:21:55] it into it. You know, and things were
[1:21:58] revealed in this time which gives an
[1:22:01] upgrade for the time in that we live.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; A brother said it's because of the
[1:22:08] hormones that is in the chicken.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. That you get homosexuality.
[1:22:14] Therefore, it matters to pray before you
[1:22:16] eat.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Who who could say this? Who could preach
[1:22:22] this? But in the days of the voice of
[1:22:24] the seventh angel, the mystery of God be
[1:22:27] revealed. Remember that that dream of
[1:22:29] Junior Jackson, brother Bren confirmed.
[1:22:32] He said, he said, "And that pyramid, and
[1:22:34] here's the white stone, light never
[1:22:36] shone upon it since
[1:22:40] the foundation of the world." In other
[1:22:42] words, Jesus never mentioned it. Paul
[1:22:45] never mentioned it. But in the days of
[1:22:47] the voice of the seventh angel, the
[1:22:49] mystery of God will be revealed.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; And it's nothing outside the Bible, but
[1:22:56] it's fulfilling the missing part that
[1:22:58] God left for the end time.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; So, so, so, so we're not propagating
[1:23:04] homosexuality here, but what I want to
[1:23:06] say, whatever comes your way, don't give
[1:23:09] up. Amen.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; God has the last answer.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Marcus, what is your
[1:23:15] doctrine? God will have a way
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; where there seems to be no.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Brother, how much? And I want to ask the
[1:23:24] older one among us. How much did we want
[1:23:26] to give up
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; as ministers, as parents, as people? We
[1:23:30] just want to give up. But there was
[1:23:32] something in us that couldn't give up.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; And if we help these youngsters who say,
[1:23:38] "Hey, there's things in your life that
[1:23:40] will that will come your path, but don't
[1:23:41] give up."
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Why? Because we have a father.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. My strength is not because I have
[1:23:49] a prophet.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; I have a father.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; We are not
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; We are not here because of William
[1:23:56] Brandon.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; William Brandon became because of us.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Behold, I will send you.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; God saw us. And then as he had to send
[1:24:06] William Brandham,
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; we are not here because of William
[1:24:08] Brandham.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; We are here because of the Lord Jesus
[1:24:11] Christ.
[1:24:13] [Applause]
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; The great person. Therefore, we are not
[1:24:18] Branamites
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; and we are outside of all that cultish
[1:24:22] things that is in the myth for us. It's
[1:24:24] just teenage teenage.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; It's good people but childish
[1:24:29] understanding. Um the great person in
[1:24:32] this time is not William Brandham. is
[1:24:33] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Have have you ever thought about that
[1:24:38] man that how how how God does not forget
[1:24:42] here is the rich young ruler or not or
[1:24:45] the the prodigal son. I mean that was
[1:24:46] his mistake. He goes in the things of
[1:24:49] the world and and he lives in all kind
[1:24:51] of red light districts and the money is
[1:24:54] away and parties and whatever and then
[1:24:56] he has no money and then the Bible says
[1:24:59] and he came to himself.
[1:25:02] That is the miracle part.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; It was not him. It was God's
[1:25:08] bringing back his memory.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Who he is. People say, "Brother Marcus,
[1:25:13] where are the signs and the miracle in
[1:25:15] the message?" Look, we are the signs.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; We are the miracles.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; That's what Isaiah says. Behold Israel,
[1:25:22] you are the miracle. You are the sign.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? How God transformed
[1:25:28] us. That's the greatest miracle that
[1:25:30] there is
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; from egocentric persons standing in
[1:25:33] their own way to people who have a
[1:25:35] helping hand for a dying world. Only God
[1:25:37] can do this.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we understand and the second
[1:25:44] thing what was the sec the first
[1:25:46] revelation that the boy had? He came to
[1:25:49] himself. What did he say? I have a
[1:25:52] father.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; He never said I have a church. I have a
[1:25:55] brother Brandham. I have I have a
[1:25:58] father.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; And my father is a great man.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; And I want to say this. Our father is a
[1:26:04] great man.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Hey. Hallelujah.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Revelation and love goes hand in hand.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Revelation will never puff you up.
[1:26:16] Revelation gives a feeling.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; I told the brother I said when when life
[1:26:21] becomes thick and life becomes hard,
[1:26:23] okay? and you're just you're just seeing
[1:26:26] what power is. Okay, the children are
[1:26:29] disobedient. The church doesn't like
[1:26:31] you. The neighbors are difficult. And I
[1:26:33] said, brother Bra said, love is the
[1:26:35] greatest power that there is. You will
[1:26:38] win when you have love.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Sooner or later, you must win because
[1:26:43] love is the greatest power.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Love is greater than hatred.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Please make the next one.
[1:26:53] I mean, here's brother Bren. I mean,
[1:26:59] sorry for this. Here's brother Brennan.
[1:27:02] Rebecca said when we were on our way to
[1:27:06] going to to from Jeffersonville to
[1:27:08] Tusome, our father went back into the
[1:27:10] house and got that picture of of the
[1:27:13] angel, okay, and brought it into the
[1:27:15] card. It seemed for him to be so
[1:27:18] important, okay?
[1:27:21] But what does he want to tell his
[1:27:23] children? What do we want to say our
[1:27:25] children? Brother, we are over 60. When
[1:27:28] the Lord carries, we just have 20 years
[1:27:31] to live. Then our time is up. Okay,
[1:27:34] maybe 10 years according to the Bible.
[1:27:37] 70 with power 80. Okay, our time, we are
[1:27:40] already on our departure tour.
[1:27:44] Hey,
[1:27:46] do you know one thing? When you were
[1:27:48] born and when I was born, the date of
[1:27:52] expire was already on our front.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ram said on one hand side,
[1:27:58] a Christian never dies because of his
[1:28:00] sickness. Never. A Christian dies when
[1:28:03] God calls him.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Okay? No matter what the doctor says.
[1:28:07] But on the other hand side, you can you
[1:28:10] can you can eat healthy.
[1:28:12] I'm you can live healthy. I'm only only
[1:28:15] biological food. Okay? No meat, no
[1:28:18] nothing. All is fine. You can eat
[1:28:19] healthy, but when your time is up, you
[1:28:21] die healthy.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; So, I encourage you to go to McDonald's.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; When your time is up, your time is up.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; So, hey, young man, young boy, Amen. If
[1:28:41] you want to do something for God, do it
[1:28:43] today.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; You don't know if you have tomorrow.
[1:28:47] If you want to serve the Lord, if you
[1:28:48] want to make things right with God, make
[1:28:50] it today.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; If you want to if you want to tell your
[1:28:52] parents how much you care, if you want
[1:28:54] to tell your children how much you love
[1:28:55] them, tell them today.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you don't know if there is
[1:28:59] a tomorrow.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; So God shows to his children, look,
[1:29:03] maybe one day daddy will not be with you
[1:29:05] anymore, but never forget you have an
[1:29:07] angel.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said, that is our own
[1:29:10] theophony. Quote brother Brandham.
[1:29:12] Brother Brandon, please explain the
[1:29:14] angels who are always beholding the face
[1:29:17] of the father. That's Mark 10 or Matthew
[1:29:20] 10.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, sir. Amen.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; And brother Bra said, "These angels are
[1:29:26] the bodies in which you will go after
[1:29:29] you will die."
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; In other words, your own theophony.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; God cannot forget you because part of
[1:29:36] you is beholding God.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. and the heavenly parts, the
[1:29:40] spiritual parts.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; God cannot forget his children.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandon, please explain
[1:29:46] about each and every personal angel. And
[1:29:49] brother Brand said for two for two for
[1:29:52] two pages blah blah blah blah blah blah
[1:29:54] blah blah blah blah blah blah. And at
[1:29:55] the end, yeah, that is your own
[1:29:58] theophony.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; That is the answer to the question. Our
[1:30:03] only children of God have a theophony.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nobody can preach you into it. You
[1:30:09] will not earn it. It's not because when
[1:30:12] you die, God will not see 5 minutes
[1:30:15] before your death. Okay. Was he always
[1:30:17] in church?
[1:30:19] Did he pay his tithings?
[1:30:22] Was he always nice to Marcus Becker?
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. We know, not we hope, we know when
[1:30:32] this earthly tabernacle
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; will be dissolved. We have already
[1:30:39] waiting for us. We know we have less
[1:30:43] obedience. Does it make us now? Okay.
[1:30:46] Now I can drink. I can smoke. I can live
[1:30:48] because I have a theophony. No. Because
[1:30:49] you have the Holy Ghost.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost will not allow these
[1:30:53] things.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; When you die, it will be like Elijah. It
[1:30:59] was not Elijah trying to find the
[1:31:02] chariot but it was the chariot finding
[1:31:05] Elijah
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; when we die. Amen. Brother Blame said
[1:31:09] that is our own theophony will find us.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So nobody but brother
[1:31:18] sister. Amen. Our our our our hands as
[1:31:22] parents we can do our best.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; We can we can bring them up in the fear
[1:31:27] of the Lord. We can do and we did our
[1:31:29] best becoming friends to our children
[1:31:32] but we will find out it takes a
[1:31:34] supernatural element only God can call
[1:31:36] them.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; If your children don't serve the Lord
[1:31:39] don't be discouraged because salvation
[1:31:42] it pertains to God
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; not to the parents.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; We do our best but God has to call him
[1:31:48] whenever it comes.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Please make the next one. So we
[1:31:53] understand. Amen. here. Uh, and I want
[1:31:56] you to put on the spiritual jacket. Now,
[1:31:59] we have, and I know Sarin and Christina
[1:32:02] knows it already, but but just now we
[1:32:04] have two personalities. Okay? As we
[1:32:07] realize that the Canadians, they cannot
[1:32:09] play football. So, I will give you some
[1:32:11] some lessons.
[1:32:13] Okay? But you are good in hockey. That's
[1:32:16] what we honest. So, we peace. Peace.
[1:32:21] Now, you need the lamb's nature. Okay?
[1:32:24] But here is France Beckenbower and he
[1:32:27] was they call it the okay the emperor
[1:32:29] whatever and this is Bertie folks the
[1:32:31] two men both had the same success in
[1:32:35] football they were both world champions
[1:32:37] both became uh coaches very very
[1:32:41] successful okay but their n their
[1:32:44] mentality was completely different okay
[1:32:48] now France Beckenbau when he lost the
[1:32:50] battle he said look where is the problem
[1:32:52] okay Next match we will win. Okay. H. So
[1:32:56] so what to the to the journalist. Okay.
[1:33:00] Bertie folks he was always explaining
[1:33:02] himself. Yeah. Please uh understand you
[1:33:05] must know the defenders they were not
[1:33:07] right in their own tactic and here is
[1:33:09] the midfield players and but next match
[1:33:11] we will try to change this and we try
[1:33:13] and they try to find out where is the
[1:33:15] difference between both and they found
[1:33:18] the answer in their youth. France
[1:33:20] Beckenbau comes from a prominent family.
[1:33:24] The father was a great man. The uncle
[1:33:26] was already player in Bayern Munich. I
[1:33:29] mean Bertie Folks never had a father nor
[1:33:32] a m mother. I mean he was raised up in a
[1:33:35] in as a step with a stepfather. And they
[1:33:38] found out that the relationship of the
[1:33:41] children to the parents, the the care,
[1:33:45] the warmness
[1:33:49] builds up a personality in which that
[1:33:52] person will live for the rest of its
[1:33:54] life.
[1:33:56] Okay. Amen.
[1:33:59] The Jesuits say, "Give me a child for
[1:34:01] three years. I will form it for the rest
[1:34:04] of its life."
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. is exactly so and that's that's
[1:34:08] truth. Okay, brother. I'm I'm taking
[1:34:11] care of the young people in the church.
[1:34:13] I took already care when Christina and
[1:34:15] Saron were in Sunday school. So, I can
[1:34:18] see how trades go to families. I see it
[1:34:22] because the children have the same
[1:34:23] problems like the parents had when they
[1:34:25] were young. It's incredible. You see
[1:34:29] what happens is this.
[1:34:31] These things are you see for example
[1:34:33] sicknesses.
[1:34:35] If somebody you go to the doctor and he
[1:34:37] says doctor I have heart blood pressure
[1:34:40] or I have uh uh problems with my with my
[1:34:44] with my let me say I have cancer problem
[1:34:47] or I have u for example stroke problem
[1:34:50] you know what the doctor says did
[1:34:53] somebody in your family had already that
[1:34:56] problem because a doctor knows
[1:34:58] sicknesses go through families and the
[1:35:01] natural types the spiritual so they
[1:35:04] found out that when a a a family is
[1:35:08] unhealthy, no care, okay, that the
[1:35:12] children of that family will never build
[1:35:13] up a true relationship.
[1:35:16] I mean, I thought by myself, if this
[1:35:20] works for human relationship of fathers
[1:35:25] of daughters,
[1:35:27] how much is it important that we have a
[1:35:29] relationship to our father in heaven?
[1:35:32] Amen.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Brother, brother, I was asked by a
[1:35:36] person who is working. He's a colleague.
[1:35:38] She's not a believer. She said, "Brother
[1:35:39] Marcus, what how can Christianity help
[1:35:44] in the integration of people?" I said,
[1:35:47] "Look, it it it depends on the picture
[1:35:51] of the father that this religion draws.
[1:35:56] If you present God always as a father
[1:35:59] who is never satisfied, whatever you do,
[1:36:02] it's always wrong and you did your best
[1:36:05] and he's never happy with you anyhow. He
[1:36:08] is happy when you miss the rapture. If
[1:36:10] you play that picture, then that
[1:36:13] religion becomes toxic for your own
[1:36:15] life. But if you play a picture, paint a
[1:36:20] picture of a father who cares, who does
[1:36:25] everything to encourage you, who is
[1:36:27] happy when you make it,
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; then you can sing the song, what a
[1:36:32] friend we have in Jesus.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; It depends on the picture that we have
[1:36:38] of the heavenly father. And I don't talk
[1:36:40] about people who don't care. I speak
[1:36:43] about people who need a father.
[1:36:46] who need a help
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; who see I I who say I need somebody who
[1:36:51] takes me out of that miry clay
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; and not only for my salvation but for my
[1:36:58] for my whole life.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Brother, we were we were young in the
[1:37:05] message and we were full of zeal and we
[1:37:09] were full of fire and we were full of
[1:37:12] naivity.
[1:37:14] We said here we were the eagle tie.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; Okay. The eagle belt.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Nothing against that but the eagle must
[1:37:24] be here. Come on.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Okay. Hey.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay. And here we were. And we
[1:37:30] really saw this.
[1:37:32] Whole Germany
[1:37:34] comes to the message by Marcus Becker.
[1:37:39] Praise God.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Brother. And then God says, "Marcus,
[1:37:43] you're a fine boy, but we have to mold
[1:37:45] the character a little bit."
[1:37:47] Okay? And then you get
[1:37:50] and then and in all these years we
[1:37:52] become
[1:37:56] and today we pray different. We say,
[1:37:58] "Lord, keep me on the way."
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Keep keep my heart loyal to you, Father.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; We see people even in the message, they
[1:38:05] go this side and this. Lord, keep me
[1:38:07] humble.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Keep keep my heart pure before you.
[1:38:11] Hallelujah.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you older people, do
[1:38:14] you know what? Do you know one thing?
[1:38:15] Time means nothing for God.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Time means nothing for God. God
[1:38:20] remembered Abraham even three
[1:38:22] generations later.
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; In other words, the prayers that you
[1:38:27] were praying as a young person, God
[1:38:29] remembers them.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; God did not forget. We forgot our own
[1:38:33] prayers.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; But God did not forget what we say.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:38:41] So we see we call it in in the world we
[1:38:45] call it bonding.
[1:38:47] The bonding between the parents and the
[1:38:49] children is so important to give that
[1:38:53] young girl or young boy a personality a
[1:38:56] b if not he will be always insecure
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; all his life. Amen. So you understand
[1:39:03] and here we have in the middle and you
[1:39:05] can think whatever you want but that is
[1:39:08] Joyce Meyer.
[1:39:10] Joyce Meer is a preacher in the
[1:39:12] denominations
[1:39:13] uh prosperity gospel. We had sometimes
[1:39:17] some fans of her. So I looked her up and
[1:39:20] that's not a great thing. We know what
[1:39:22] God says about the woman preacher. But
[1:39:24] she has a tremendous testimony.
[1:39:27] Joyce Meer, she was she was she was uh
[1:39:30] abused by her own father over and over
[1:39:33] and over and over in her life and she
[1:39:36] throwed her whole all whole life away.
[1:39:38] Okay? Lived on the street, you know, had
[1:39:40] no value in life anymore until she said
[1:39:43] that the Lord Jesus found her and she
[1:39:46] became a preacher in a denomination. I
[1:39:49] thought by myself, if the Lord Jesus can
[1:39:51] do this for a denomination,
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; what can he do in the message of the
[1:39:55] hour?
[1:39:56] Hey, and she said it was the Lord Jesus.
[1:39:59] And then she said a sentence that I
[1:40:00] never forgot. And it helps you to
[1:40:03] understand people who leave the message
[1:40:04] and who leave the church. Never throw
[1:40:07] something behind them. I'm keep a a
[1:40:10] loving heart to them. Amen. Because he
[1:40:13] said people who got hurt do silly
[1:40:16] things. People who got hurt do silly
[1:40:20] things. Amen. That's the time when we
[1:40:22] when we leave the message, brother.
[1:40:24] Therefore, you under we leave the
[1:40:26] church. Therefore, we are not a sect.
[1:40:29] You know how a sect functions in a sect.
[1:40:32] Oh brother, we come here together in
[1:40:36] this church and before the foundation of
[1:40:38] the world, you know, we were already in
[1:40:40] him and then we were this and then yeah,
[1:40:42] I feel it when I saw you the first time.
[1:40:44] Ah, that was such a that was such a we
[1:40:46] were long enough in the world that I
[1:40:48] fell in love at least 10 times in my
[1:40:49] life
[1:40:51] and everything was before I I I think I
[1:40:54] knew you since many many years. So that
[1:40:58] person leaves the church he doesn't go
[1:41:00] because he leaves the doctrine but with
[1:41:03] hurt maybe in his feelings. Okay. So a
[1:41:05] person leaves the church. So you know
[1:41:07] what people say? Yeah, you must
[1:41:10] understand they left us because they
[1:41:13] were never part of us just to justify
[1:41:17] themsself. Okay, so that person after
[1:41:20] some years repents. Okay, finds out it
[1:41:25] was wrong. Comes back to the church. You
[1:41:27] know what the church says? Oh, before
[1:41:29] the foundation of the world, we were
[1:41:32] always eagle brother. If somebody is
[1:41:34] part of the family of God, he will stay
[1:41:36] part of the family of God.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; If everything went wrong, then you need
[1:41:43] a father.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Then you need a friend. Can you say
[1:41:46] amen?
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. The great man Arur Rubenstein was
[1:41:51] asked the question, Mr. Rubenstein, is
[1:41:53] it difficult to play piano? He said, no,
[1:41:55] it's very simple. You just have to press
[1:41:57] down the right buttons at the right
[1:41:59] time.
[1:42:01] And to be led by the Holy Spirit to
[1:42:03] correct that person is very simple. You
[1:42:04] must be the right person at the right
[1:42:06] time in the right place saying the right
[1:42:08] things in the right spirit. And the
[1:42:10] other one must be the right in the right
[1:42:12] spirit to receive the right thing what
[1:42:14] you said in the right spirit.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Brother, if a person goes to difficulty
[1:42:18] sometime no word is the best word.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Instead of trying now to put our feet in
[1:42:24] things that we don't understand. Can you
[1:42:26] say amen?
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you must understand if God can
[1:42:31] do these great things,
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; what can you do in the message? This
[1:42:35] message is healing power
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; for our body, for our spirit, for our
[1:42:40] souls.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; And we talk about people who were hurt
[1:42:43] in their feelings. We say, "Okay, don't
[1:42:45] be so emotional. You're too uh uh you
[1:42:48] you are too, how do you say it? You are
[1:42:50] too sensible. You're too sensitive."
[1:42:51] That's not the question. I need a help,
[1:42:53] man.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. I need someone who helps me. Okay.
[1:42:57] So here this please understand and we
[1:42:59] talk about the people who don't want. So
[1:43:02] we will uh who who who cannot
[1:43:05] this know also that in these last days
[1:43:08] perious time shall come for men shall be
[1:43:10] lovers of their own selves. Covetous
[1:43:13] boasters brought blasphemous disobedient
[1:43:16] to their parents unthankful unholy
[1:43:18] without natural affections.
[1:43:23] Brother, when I was young, I thought
[1:43:25] these people are monsters.
[1:43:28] But you must understand the people in
[1:43:30] the world today are victims because we
[1:43:32] live in a sick society.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; And a sick society produces sicker
[1:43:38] children.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. A a a father comes to me and says,
[1:43:42] "Brother Marcus, uh the reason that my
[1:43:44] daughter is is this and this because of
[1:43:46] the cell phone." He said, "It's not the
[1:43:48] cell phone. It's because you should
[1:43:49] invest time in her. have a relationship
[1:43:52] of a friendship together then she can
[1:43:54] have 10 cell phones.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; One is this is just a symptom
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; of a situation. Amen. So you must
[1:44:03] understand that every generation gets
[1:44:06] wiser.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; You say it's not so you give your cell
[1:44:09] phone to your children. They are 10
[1:44:11] times faster than you. Give it to the
[1:44:13] little baby.
[1:44:15] They get a cell.
[1:44:18] You understand that? I mean they they
[1:44:20] become smarter but weaker all the time.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; We live we live in a sick society. Don't
[1:44:27] be blended by Hollywood that people that
[1:44:30] people make a good appearance. They are
[1:44:31] sick in their mind. And the and the
[1:44:33] remedy against the sick society is
[1:44:36] healthy families.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; These youngsters in the street, they
[1:44:41] need a father man. They need a mother.
[1:44:44] They need someone who who who who stands
[1:44:47] in the gap for them who says look
[1:44:49] whatever comes whatever goes I love you.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; The the the young people many times they
[1:44:56] are a little bit ashamed of the parents
[1:45:00] and and what happens is you know uh when
[1:45:03] they are little little ones they are
[1:45:04] proud of the parents but when they come
[1:45:05] to school okay you start to bring them
[1:45:08] to school and they're very proud that
[1:45:09] daddy brings them to school but at a
[1:45:11] certain time they become a little bit
[1:45:13] more cool. Yeah.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; So they said 100 yards before the school
[1:45:18] um
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; you can stop here.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; The older they get the distance become
[1:45:23] bigger
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; because it's not cool you know and then
[1:45:26] you want to get and then
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; I remember my own daughter you see she
[1:45:35] was in kindergarten and the all the
[1:45:36] children they were stand sitting on
[1:45:38] there. Okay.
[1:45:40] And I came to pick her up and I was at
[1:45:42] the fence and she saw me and before all
[1:45:46] the children she stood up and she said,
[1:45:47] "Hello, daddy." And I thought by myself,
[1:45:50] my daughter was not ashamed of me. I
[1:45:52] will never be ashamed of her.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Never ever. I told my daughter, I said,
[1:45:57] "Look, I want to tell you one thing. You
[1:45:58] know, we believe the message of the
[1:45:59] hour." Okay? I cannot force you to
[1:46:02] become a believer.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; Okay? That's God calling in his time.
[1:46:06] Okay? I will not. You have the right for
[1:46:08] your own life. Okay, if you become a
[1:46:11] Muslim, okay, that is up to you. I
[1:46:13] respect this. I will not agreeing with
[1:46:15] your life, but I respect this.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; But I want to make you sure and let you
[1:46:20] know that God put us together as a
[1:46:22] family. And daddy will always be your
[1:46:24] friend. Whatever comes in life, if
[1:46:27] you're in prison, if you're not in
[1:46:28] prison, whatever, we are always friends
[1:46:31] in life.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen to this? Amen.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that our heavenly
[1:46:37] father, he's not always optioning if we
[1:46:39] are chosen or not chosen? He finds a
[1:46:42] way. He's not always agreeing with our
[1:46:45] ways, but that he calls us back on the
[1:46:47] way.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; So, please understand that we live in a
[1:46:53] sick society. These people don't need a
[1:46:55] message book. They need reality.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; They don't need a doctrine. They don't
[1:47:01] need a picture of Brother Brandham at
[1:47:03] the war. We can have we can we can
[1:47:04] plaster our wall with brother Brandon
[1:47:06] but it takes more than this.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Peter said I can only give what you what
[1:47:12] I have.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; How can you give love to your children
[1:47:16] if you don't have that love?
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; And I believe here's a group that has
[1:47:22] the love. But you understand we have to
[1:47:23] transmit a vision a love that the
[1:47:26] children say look I don't know the
[1:47:28] doctrine of papa mama but I want I want
[1:47:32] to say my father is a great man you say
[1:47:35] what happened with those children they
[1:47:37] don't serve the lord and they die yeah
[1:47:40] we see them at the white throat judgment
[1:47:43] we see them if god was allowed
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; that his his dog and his horse was there
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; amen My mother, she was never interested
[1:47:54] in in in religion. Was never, she was
[1:47:55] not against it. She was not, she was
[1:47:57] just not interested. What can I do?
[1:47:59] Okay. But my mother is my mother. What I
[1:48:02] am is because of her.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; If God allows and I would be in the
[1:48:05] white throne judgment, I will have my
[1:48:06] veto.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; I said, I know that she never went to
[1:48:09] church, but that was my mother on earth.
[1:48:12] She did everything for me. Now I want to
[1:48:14] give everything for her.
[1:48:16] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that sometimes you are
[1:48:18] the only one in the family serving the
[1:48:21] Lord? Everybody is is is is in the
[1:48:23] world. You are not helping the people by
[1:48:25] giving up.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; You go your way.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; And you are sure we will meet them again
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; at the white throne judgment.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; And then you will become like Esther.
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Blessed be them. Please make the next
[1:48:40] one. So we understand. Amen. Here's Mike
[1:48:43] Tyson.
[1:48:44] Mike Tyson said, "Amen. I put on all
[1:48:47] these muscles
[1:48:50] to to protect my soul. Okay. Now, Mike
[1:48:54] Tyson, he in that interview, he said,
[1:48:56] "When I'm boxing, I'm trying to put the
[1:48:59] nose of my opponent in his brain." We
[1:49:03] would say, "What a what a monster." But
[1:49:06] he revealed in that same interview, I
[1:49:08] was reading it when I was an unbeliever,
[1:49:10] that he was a how do you call it? I
[1:49:12] think it's sensitive. If if if a person
[1:49:15] is very easily hurt in his field, is
[1:49:16] that sensitive? It's not sens sensitive.
[1:49:19] He said in that interview, I was a
[1:49:21] sensitive boy and I loved and I loved I
[1:49:24] loved animals. Okay. But I lived in New
[1:49:27] York and Catsville and so these boys
[1:49:29] came and killed all my animals. So he
[1:49:32] said, "So I built up all these muscles
[1:49:34] so I could beat down everyone who's
[1:49:36] who's hurting my feelings." And the
[1:49:38] interview the journalist says, "Mr.
[1:49:41] Tyson, will you ever overcome the
[1:49:43] frustration of your use? He said, I will
[1:49:45] never do that. I can never do that. And
[1:49:48] you must understand that Mike Tyson
[1:49:50] became a Christian. He became a Baptist
[1:49:52] and he became a Muslim. But that's what
[1:49:55] I want to tell the people. You can
[1:49:57] change your religion three times a
[1:49:58] month, but it will not change the
[1:50:00] person.
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; You can change the doctrine in the
[1:50:03] message three times a month. But what we
[1:50:05] need is healing on the inside. Amen.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; And it comes by the presence of the
[1:50:10] almighty God.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; I can only make my children happy if I'm
[1:50:14] happy.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; If not, if I have grudges in my heart,
[1:50:19] in my soul, I will only transmit
[1:50:21] grudges. It's so important for me as a
[1:50:24] minister. You know there is a German
[1:50:27] German prime minister uh Katchman and he
[1:50:32] is a teacher and he was asked a question
[1:50:34] what is the qualification for a good
[1:50:36] teacher? He said this the first thing is
[1:50:40] you must love children.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Hey
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; hey must love children
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; and as if you want to be a good minister
[1:50:48] you must love people.
[1:50:50] They must feel that you want to help
[1:50:52] them.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; You must love the word. You must love
[1:50:54] God. But you must love the people.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can feel if a minister
[1:50:59] have his his his if if if he is hurt in
[1:51:03] his feeling, but because it's
[1:51:04] transmitted little complexes, little
[1:51:07] things. Therefore, the Bible says that
[1:51:09] that our leaders that we that they
[1:51:12] should do the things in great
[1:51:13] thankfulness. Amen. I have an older
[1:51:16] pastor, 84.
[1:51:19] I mean, sure. I mean, if you're 84,
[1:51:20] you're not preaching like 60. You forget
[1:51:22] things and you repeat things and you
[1:51:26] find don't find your text and and it's
[1:51:29] normal. Where's a one day we will be
[1:51:31] that the same way. Okay. But he has very
[1:51:33] still a very good inspiration. So, what
[1:51:36] I'm doing if there is a sermon, I always
[1:51:37] send a little text message. Hey, pastor,
[1:51:39] good job. Thank you very much. And I
[1:51:41] just always picked up some some sentence
[1:51:45] that was that was outstanding so that he
[1:51:47] realizes just to feed a little bit the
[1:51:50] emotional moto of a man.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; And brother, you do these things and God
[1:51:54] remembers and will bless you for that
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; because we're family.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; We are there to encourage one another.
[1:52:01] Okay. Behind these muscles, brother,
[1:52:04] when we were young in all our our
[1:52:07] complexes, everything that we did was
[1:52:09] put up
[1:52:11] Every boy, every boy who wants to be
[1:52:13] cool.
[1:52:16] Hi chicks. How are you doing?
[1:52:19] Never forget there's a weak part in his
[1:52:22] soul. And that's what the lead job Jesus
[1:52:24] wants to wants to fill and wants to deal
[1:52:26] with. Can you say amen? Please make the
[1:52:29] next one. I'm hurrying through now. Here
[1:52:31] is here is here is Marilyn Monroe.
[1:52:36] How can God be interested in a person
[1:52:39] who doesn't come into a message church?
[1:52:42] Because you must understand life is
[1:52:45] precious in the eyes of God.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; For God God told to brother Brandham,
[1:52:50] you call these Rickys and Ricettas and
[1:52:51] they are not sawdust. You shouldn't do
[1:52:53] that. Many of my children are still
[1:52:55] among them. You're never wrong. You see,
[1:52:59] for example, a vagabond on the street.
[1:53:02] Okay, for us it's just a bump. is just a
[1:53:05] vagabond. But the same man is the
[1:53:08] daughter of a mama
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; is the son of a mama. For mama that's
[1:53:12] his son. And maybe the same man is the
[1:53:15] father of a little girl and for that
[1:53:17] little girl it's her father.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; You're never wrong in respecting people.
[1:53:22] Amen. Amen.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So here he is. She is one of the
[1:53:27] beauties girl the left one in blonde.
[1:53:31] Okay. So what happens is that brother
[1:53:35] Brandham says uh the angel of the Lord
[1:53:38] tells brother Brandham the minute when
[1:53:41] she dies when God knew the minute of the
[1:53:45] death of Mary Monroe. God knows the
[1:53:47] minute of our death.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; Okay. So and he knows that we go in the
[1:53:53] rapture.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he can call us bright.
[1:53:56] Therefore, brother Blame said, "I saw
[1:53:58] you on the other side quickening power.
[1:54:01] Let me see behind the curtain of time
[1:54:03] and I saw you there. Thank you Jesus.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; You must have seen my theophony.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; So he says now a young blonde woman and
[1:54:12] that is what I want to preach this
[1:54:14] morning. A God who understands life
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; that not a doctrinal not a judgmental a
[1:54:23] God of the word but who understands
[1:54:26] circumstances. why people are in that
[1:54:29] conditions that they are in.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; So when you talk with God, he knows
[1:54:34] exactly where you come from.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Okay. A young blonde woman, Marin
[1:54:38] Monrose, she she died. It was not a
[1:54:40] suicide. I felt sorry for the lady. She
[1:54:43] was a she was a very sad type of a
[1:54:47] woman. Always she needed something. I
[1:54:49] wished I would have could have talked to
[1:54:51] the girl. She needed Christ. She went
[1:54:54] maybe into a cold formal church, but she
[1:54:58] needed a true case of salvation.
[1:55:01] Something in her heart that gives her
[1:55:03] security. She has never seen her father.
[1:55:06] Her mother was in the insane
[1:55:08] institution. All that was on the mind of
[1:55:10] that girl. Blessed be the name of the
[1:55:13] Lord that we have a message who
[1:55:14] understands people. Amen.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; Brother, I tell you one thing in the
[1:55:19] white throne judgment, God is love and
[1:55:22] God is just.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; God will understand people who could not
[1:55:27] come out of their seat.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; I mean, God understands life. I mean, it
[1:55:33] was not okay. All these atomic. No, no,
[1:55:35] no. Okay. Now, you understand she was
[1:55:38] the the woman with the perfect body, the
[1:55:42] nicest girl. Now if she was if she was
[1:55:48] unhappy and said though she was the
[1:55:51] nicest woman, you sisters don't invest
[1:55:55] too much in lipsticks
[1:55:59] and jewelries and and all these if if if
[1:56:03] that didn't make her nice, it will make
[1:56:06] it will not make us nice and happy. We
[1:56:09] need a case of salvation.
[1:56:13] That woman, her man, how old is she?
[1:56:17] When we are at the youth camp, we will
[1:56:18] ask. I tell you right there, she's 16
[1:56:21] years old.
[1:56:22] 16 years old and she's made up like
[1:56:24] this. Brother Brandham explains life. He
[1:56:28] says, "Every woman wants to be
[1:56:30] beautiful."
[1:56:32] Okay? There's nothing wrong. There's a
[1:56:34] difference between beautiful and sexy.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not more spiritual because
[1:56:41] you dress like a scarecrow.
[1:56:45] That's what we thought in the beginning.
[1:56:48] No, no. Make yourself pretty. If you're
[1:56:50] if you if if you're a handsome boy,
[1:56:51] you're a handsome boy. Okay. You can
[1:56:57] Okay. Amen. But there's a difference
[1:57:00] between between between
[1:57:03] being pretty and being sexy.
[1:57:06] Every boy said brother Bren wants to be
[1:57:08] successful that lays in him. It's
[1:57:11] nothing wrong but put it in the right
[1:57:13] kind of channel. Okay. So what happens
[1:57:16] is here
[1:57:18] that
[1:57:19] she was 16 at that age
[1:57:23] and she got compliments from the film
[1:57:26] industry
[1:57:28] and you must understand
[1:57:31] that every human being needs some good
[1:57:35] words.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; Please understand that
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; as much as we have the Holy Spirit we
[1:57:42] are still human beings. If you miss
[1:57:44] this, you are miss life reality.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen. It fills up a certain tank
[1:57:52] of where of of of being respected of
[1:57:56] being uh of of of of a self-esteem.
[1:58:00] Every woman wants to be pretty. Every
[1:58:02] man wants to wants to be successful.
[1:58:05] Now, I want to say this,
[1:58:07] us as fathers, hey, we have our
[1:58:10] youngsters, our girls, they do their
[1:58:12] best. They have long hair and they have
[1:58:14] long dress. Who tells them that they are
[1:58:17] pretty? They need it.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. It should be the father.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. We should go to our girls. He
[1:58:25] said, "Hey, honey, I want to tell you
[1:58:27] one thing. You're looking good, man.
[1:58:29] You're looking good." Amen. We shouldn't
[1:58:32] take those things for granted because
[1:58:34] they need it. And if they don't get it
[1:58:36] from the right person, they search it at
[1:58:39] the wrong person.
[1:58:41] Therefore, we shall tell our our our I
[1:58:44] mean I I I tell you one thing this
[1:58:46] happens only in Germany. Can you say
[1:58:47] amen so far
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; that that that I'm you say that's the
[1:58:51] human part but it's so important to keep
[1:58:53] a balance.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; I here's our wives and I mean I mean
[1:58:59] they do everything to wash the clothes
[1:59:01] to to to to to cook every every day.
[1:59:04] Okay. Now here's brother Marcus. Okay.
[1:59:07] He never says a word. We take these
[1:59:09] things for granted. Okay. So Marcus and
[1:59:11] Martina, my wife, we're now invited at
[1:59:13] another family. Okay, here's Marcus and
[1:59:15] he's eating. And Marcus, it's me. We're
[1:59:17] eating. And I tell that sister, sister.

[1:59:31] potatoes. I never ate potatoes like
[1:59:33] this.
[1:59:36] and my and my wife

[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; by wise
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; brother brother brother brother sometime
[1:59:48] even as a church you must be wise I
[1:59:50] don't talk to children I talk to really
[1:59:52] adult people understand we will reign
[1:59:54] one day and we must understand dynamics
[1:59:57] okay I mean I mean as as a minister I
[2:00:00] mean you do your best you do your best
[2:00:03] I'm a visiting min minister a visiting
[2:00:05] minister is always the man of the hour
[2:00:10] or of the minute.
[2:00:12] Yeah. I mean because people like that
[2:00:15] but if you listen to me every week
[2:00:19] okay but but sometime in the church and
[2:00:21] I think sometime that's so unwise. Okay.
[2:00:24] So so you do your best. Okay. And people
[2:00:26] come and say thank you or they do do not
[2:00:28] say anything. But here comes a guest
[2:00:30] minister. He says the same thing. The
[2:00:33] same. Now, we have a little custom in
[2:00:36] Germany that we at the at the door and
[2:00:37] we shake the hands of the people. Okay?
[2:00:39] And I as a translator, I stand beside
[2:00:41] the guest minister and here come people,
[2:00:44] brother, that was so tremendous.
[2:00:47] We never heard it that way. Please come
[2:00:50] back soon. And and here you are
[2:00:52] thinking, thank you.
[2:00:56] It's it's it's just a question of not
[2:00:58] realization. The other one has feelings.
[2:01:03] Every human being needs some nice words.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; And how much more God has nice words for
[2:01:10] the B for for his bride.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; Do we understand those things? We as
[2:01:14] fathers, we must tell our children how
[2:01:16] much we care for them. You see, you have
[2:01:18] a boy and your own father. Brother, we
[2:01:21] come from a generation where we did not
[2:01:23] show emotions.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Our fathers never hugged us.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Never hugged us.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; I hope I can say that way. I'm missing
[2:01:32] some words. You my father was showing so
[2:01:36] few emotion that I wonder myself how I
[2:01:39] came into existence.
[2:01:43] [Applause]
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; It must have been a spoken word.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; Okay. But I mean, but that was that was
[2:01:54] that was the generation of World War II.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Everything was a boy must be strong and
[2:01:59] a boy must be this and a and But what
[2:02:02] these boys need is a father taking them
[2:02:05] into hey buddy I love you
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; buddy I love you okay and we're friends
[2:02:10] okay and I want to tell you one thing I
[2:02:12] remember myself I mean what what how can
[2:02:14] I help I mean I was I was a small boy
[2:02:17] and my father said when I was in your
[2:02:19] age I had muscles I had this I had that
[2:02:21] after some years I was taller than him
[2:02:23] and more muscles like him you see but
[2:02:26] then it was yes but you didn't make that
[2:02:28] kind of university whatever I did was
[2:02:30] wrong.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; Whatever I did was wrong
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; until I found out with my heavenly
[2:02:35] father, whatever I do is right.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; Hey, say brother Marcus, what is your
[2:02:40] doctrine? I have a father.
[2:02:45] He calls me his own. Long before even
[2:02:50] time began,
[2:02:53] my life was in his hand.
[2:02:58] Brother, if we don't show love,
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. to the children, who wants to show
[2:03:03] love? If we receive the capstone, it's
[2:03:05] more like a doctrine. It's a substance.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; If we can show empathy to a dying world,
[2:03:11] a respect, a feeling, a warmth, who
[2:03:14] wants to give it?
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Make make the next one, please.
[2:03:19] Amen. It fits into it. Beautiful.
[2:03:23] Beautiful. Amen. The dying world needs a
[2:03:26] father.
[2:03:28] a friend in life, somebody who stands
[2:03:30] with you, somebody let me say if you if
[2:03:34] that that doesn't pick up his or take
[2:03:37] his generation but the the gen of the
[2:03:40] religion but the religion gets a hold of
[2:03:42] him.
[2:03:44] I mean that man is not grandfather, it's
[2:03:48] a father but he has cancer. He will die
[2:03:51] soon. He's an unbelieving man. Okay. and
[2:03:55] and they made a big story. I think it
[2:03:58] comes from Holland. That's his daughter.
[2:04:00] Nothing immoral. It's his daughter. But
[2:04:03] look what it is. He found out I have to
[2:04:06] live just a couple of weeks. Pancreas
[2:04:09] cancer. It goes very very fast. So he
[2:04:12] understands my daughter will never be
[2:04:15] able that her father brings her to the
[2:04:18] altar when she will marry. So what they
[2:04:20] did, they said they were playing
[2:04:23] marriage with all the guests
[2:04:27] up to the point where the father leaves
[2:04:30] her at the altar and they stopped there
[2:04:33] and when she when she will marry one day
[2:04:35] she will continue exactly at that point
[2:04:38] so that she can say my father brought me
[2:04:40] to the altar.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; I thought by myself if an unbeliever
[2:04:45] have that understanding of a father what
[2:04:48] about a message believer?
[2:04:50] Brother, sister, we must understand our
[2:04:53] children need us.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; They need us as friends as as as
[2:04:59] partners in life. So, so to take all our
[2:05:03] life experience to help them on their
[2:05:05] way.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; We cannot run away from this because a
[2:05:10] family is a team.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; Even a church is a team.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; They come together. They stand together.
[2:05:16] Brother, a church is a place where so
[2:05:18] much warmness that even the sinner feels
[2:05:21] welcomed.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Not the sin, but the person who fell
[2:05:26] that he comes back. Can you say amen?
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Have you ever seen that
[2:05:33] thing? Can you say amen so far? I'm just
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; just some practical things. Okay. Amen.
[2:05:42] Have you ever heard that voice when when
[2:05:44] some when something when something
[2:05:45] really went bad in your life? Really
[2:05:48] bad. And it can be just feelings. I
[2:05:51] mean, you're sick. Okay. Then you hear a
[2:05:54] voice inside. Don't go to church today.
[2:05:57] You're not a blessing like this. And and
[2:05:59] you you better stay home. And then uh
[2:06:02] with that kind of cough. Oh, no. No. You
[2:06:05] you would start a pandemia in the
[2:06:06] church. Don't be. Have you ever heard
[2:06:08] Have you ever ever had heard that that
[2:06:11] voice that thought? Can you say amen so
[2:06:13] far?
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; In other words, that voice speaks
[2:06:15] English and German
[2:06:19] because I hear that voice in German. You
[2:06:22] hear it in English. Amen. And if you
[2:06:24] come from Africa, you hear it in okay,
[2:06:26] whatever. But I tell you one thing, when
[2:06:29] everything goes wrong, don't stay home.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; Because you don't become more religious
[2:06:35] or more spiritual by staying home. That
[2:06:38] is the point where you come into the
[2:06:40] house of your father.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; He says, "Heavenly Father, I have sinned
[2:06:44] against you. Everything went wrong, but
[2:06:45] here I am. I need you."
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; That is the moment where you should not
[2:06:50] stay at home. When your feelings are
[2:06:52] hurt, when everything is wrong, then you
[2:06:54] come in the presence of your father and
[2:06:56] says, "Heavenly Father, I just need you.
[2:06:58] I cannot make it with you." Can you say
[2:07:00] amen?
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen so far?
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; So next time when Satan comes to you and
[2:07:10] says, "You better stay home." You say to
[2:07:12] Satan, "No, you stay home."
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. You stay home. Okay? I want to
[2:07:17] come in the presence of my father
[2:07:19] because because I need help. Everything
[2:07:21] went wrong. Can you say amen?
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; And the church needs that. Again, we
[2:07:25] live in a sick society. And even when
[2:07:28] I'm traveling, I see sick message.
[2:07:30] Churches,
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; the doctrine is good, but it takes more
[2:07:34] than a good doctrine. It takes a life.
[2:07:36] It takes a warmness. It takes an
[2:07:39] understanding. It takes a empathy. It
[2:07:42] takes a real mutual respect that
[2:07:44] everybody feels that's my house.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Therefore, these these
[2:07:50] doctrines are are so destructive.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. Therefore, Amen.
[2:07:58] Amen. People who come out of legalism,
[2:08:00] please understand, they have their
[2:08:02] scars.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because because legalism is then
[2:08:07] to just discipline unbelievers. But I
[2:08:10] don't need legalism. I need a father.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; Please make the next one. I'm going
[2:08:14] through. Amen. Make the next one. Amen.
[2:08:16] Amen. Amen. Here we go. Okay. Amen. This
[2:08:20] is a little video. Okay. And
[2:08:24] it just shows we have no we have no
[2:08:26] sound. We have video. It's only two
[2:08:27] minutes. It's not bad things. It's not
[2:08:29] believers. But I want to tell you again,
[2:08:32] please don't understand. If God
[2:08:33] understands a dying world, okay? Amen.
[2:08:39] the heart of God.
[2:08:41] The Bible says God so much loved the
[2:08:44] world.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said God wants that
[2:08:46] everybody could be saved.
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; That's his heart. That's his feeling.
[2:08:51] And if we are sons of a father, we have
[2:08:54] a feeling for a dying world.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here is a man by the name of of of
[2:09:00] um Jonah.
[2:09:03] And Jonah was happy for the judgment
[2:09:06] because he was an Israelite. He had no
[2:09:08] feeling for for for for some Gentiles.
[2:09:12] So he brought his message,
[2:09:15] set himself upon upon upon the rock and
[2:09:19] he said, "Okay,
[2:09:22] let the fire fall
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; with him." And then God speaks to him
[2:09:28] said, "Jonah, here's a city of 100,000
[2:09:31] people. They don't know left from
[2:09:33] right." In other words, they don't have
[2:09:34] a message. Amen. I mean, and you just
[2:09:37] ask for the fire and you're not happy
[2:09:39] about the forgiveness of God. I mean,
[2:09:42] you understand
[2:09:44] God has a feeling even for a dying
[2:09:47] world.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; How much more he has a feeling for
[2:09:49] people who fall back or who who who
[2:09:53] people who cannot follow anymore. God is
[2:09:56] not wiping them off. God always has a
[2:09:59] helping hand.
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that's his nature. Amen.
[2:10:03] He is a father. If we can good give good
[2:10:07] things to our children, how much more
[2:10:09] our heavenly father can give to us. And
[2:10:11] if you help us in this,
[2:10:14] [Music]
[2:10:23] I close my eyes
[2:10:27] and in the dark
[2:10:31] I try to see his face from memories in
[2:10:35] my heart.
[2:10:38] It's been some time,
[2:10:41] some months or more,
[2:10:45] since my father went to fight the
[2:10:49] foreign war.
[2:10:53] And I know he'll be home sooner than we
[2:10:57] thought.
[2:11:00] And I know he'll hold me tighter than
[2:11:04] before.
[2:11:06] Oh,
[2:11:10] but I'm not sad.
[2:11:13] You know I'm proud.
[2:11:17] You'll be home soon to hold me tight and
[2:11:21] hold my hands
[2:11:27] turn into years.
[2:11:31] still be waiting for my father to
[2:11:35] return.
[2:11:38] And I know he'll be home sooner than
[2:11:42] before.
[2:11:45] And I know we have to fight the forest.
[2:11:52] And I know you hold me tighter than
[2:11:59] [Music]
[2:12:01] And I know you hold me tighter
[2:12:05] [Music]
[2:12:08] than before.
[2:12:10] [Music]
[2:12:40] [Music]
[2:12:42] I know you'll be home sooner than we do.
[2:12:49] And I know he has to fight for it.
[2:12:55] [Music]
[2:12:56] And I know he'll hold me tighter than
[2:13:00] before.
[2:13:05] And I know he'll hold me tighter than
[2:13:09] his back. He'll hold me tighter than
[2:13:14] before.
[2:13:15] [Music]
[2:13:19] buddy.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; I missed you.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; I missed you too.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; I missed you. Amen. Brother, never
[2:13:27] forget people have souls. Amen. Brother
[2:13:30] Brandon taught us a lesson. He said,
[2:13:32] "Life is precious in the eyes of God."
[2:13:36] Amen. How much more of his right. Amen.
[2:13:39] Nobody replaces the father in the
[2:13:41] family. Nobody replaces the mother.
[2:13:44] Amen. Our kids they need us and they
[2:13:47] need that they need that warmness.
[2:13:49] Sometime we have to correct them. That's
[2:13:51] true. But they need more than just
[2:13:52] correction. They need a a hug. They need
[2:13:55] a real I stand with you. That's the way
[2:13:57] how they feel. Amen. Please make the
[2:14:00] last one. Amen. Can you say amen so far?
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says if you can give good
[2:14:06] things to your children, how much the
[2:14:09] heavenly father?
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. and gives unto us a man.
[2:14:15] Here's brother Brandham. Brother
[2:14:17] Brandham, a man full of the Holy Ghost
[2:14:21] two times want to take his life with the
[2:14:23] Holy Ghost. The seals are open and he
[2:14:26] just wants to give up. Amen.
[2:14:30] So God calls him and Brother Brham
[2:14:33] preaches about it in the message
[2:14:35] standing in the gap.
[2:14:37] Brother Brham said I built up a complex
[2:14:40] against the people. There is two ways to
[2:14:44] destroy a minister. Too much applause is
[2:14:46] not helping and too much criticism is
[2:14:49] not helping him. Amen. Keep a balance in
[2:14:51] all these things. So what happens is
[2:14:54] that brother Brandon built up that
[2:14:56] complex and God led him and he was he he
[2:15:00] stopped the car and God says to brother
[2:15:03] Brandon, you have lost the feeling
[2:15:06] for my people.
[2:15:10] Brother, it could be that we can lose
[2:15:11] the feeling for ourselves.
[2:15:14] Can be that we lose the feeling for our
[2:15:17] brothers, can lose the that we lose the
[2:15:19] feeling for our own children because
[2:15:21] they are so much frustrating us. Then it
[2:15:24] takes a dose of divine love.
[2:15:30] It's not the question who is right. It's
[2:15:32] not a question because God is right all
[2:15:34] the time. is a question who wins that
[2:15:37] situation because he has substance of
[2:15:40] taking that situation under his control.
[2:15:43] Legalism will never make it.
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; God is not breaking the prophet but God
[2:15:47] is molding him.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is not breaking us but he
[2:15:52] molds us to understands.
[2:15:54] Amen. To help people who cannot help
[2:15:57] themsel.
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; So here he is. Amen. So so so whatever.
[2:16:02] Now, brother Brandham was a man of
[2:16:05] complexes.
[2:16:08] Quote, Brother Brandham, until the
[2:16:10] message on the wings of a snow white
[2:16:13] dove, he said, "All my life I was a
[2:16:15] neurotic." Quote, Brother Brandham, how
[2:16:19] can a man with the Holy Ghost be a
[2:16:21] neurotic? Because one is the Holy Ghost,
[2:16:24] the other one is the human part. When we
[2:16:27] receive the Holy Ghost, we still have
[2:16:28] our human minds, the white dog and the
[2:16:31] black dog. And he says, "All my life I
[2:16:34] was a melancholic." Okay? Many musicians
[2:16:37] are melancholic type of persons. Okay?
[2:16:40] It's not a sin, but it's just our our
[2:16:43] upbringing. Okay? So, what happens is
[2:16:46] that when you look to the left, I mean,
[2:16:49] God says, "This is your life."
[2:16:54] I asked you the question. He said, "Your
[2:16:57] name is written all about it. It speaks
[2:16:59] of three pulls. This is your life." In
[2:17:02] the message, stand in the gap. Now, my
[2:17:04] question to you is when did these
[2:17:06] mountains come out of the earth? 1963
[2:17:12] when God created the earth, he knew the
[2:17:15] seventh angel is a neurotic type of a
[2:17:18] person, is a melancholic type of a
[2:17:20] person. So he prepared these things and
[2:17:24] he calls it an eternal and everlasting
[2:17:27] sign for you. And God remembered that he
[2:17:30] he had problems in his psyche in his
[2:17:32] mind in his he said if you ever come
[2:17:35] back into that conditions come back here
[2:17:39] and remember come back
[2:17:42] brother when we when when when we when
[2:17:45] when we make a when we make a a victory
[2:17:47] in our life. Amen. We should feast our
[2:17:52] victories. But too often we are feasting
[2:17:54] our our defeats.
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; You see, so what happens is is this is
[2:18:02] your life. And I tell you one thing,
[2:18:06] this is our life.
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; And God is not nervous because he
[2:18:14] understands life. Because he's the alpha
[2:18:17] and the omega. and he called and he knew
[2:18:19] all the time when we would backslid.
[2:18:22] He's not nervous. He said that was
[2:18:24] included in the price everything when we
[2:18:27] when you remember and and and the young
[2:18:29] people know that I said it many times
[2:18:32] to understand our father. Brother,
[2:18:35] sister, we are the only people on the
[2:18:38] earth who doesn't have a religion. We
[2:18:40] have a father.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; Don't make that message a religion. We
[2:18:45] have a person that loves us. My father
[2:18:48] is my redeemer.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; And when everything went wrong, I can
[2:18:52] speak to him. Heavenly Father, you know,
[2:18:53] I didn't want to do it, but I was
[2:18:55] overthrown in that situation.
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here, quote, brother Brandham.
[2:19:00] Now, this is a little story here is and
[2:19:02] I'm hurrying through knowing that I used
[2:19:04] too much time, but give give me just
[2:19:06] just to say uh to say goodbye. But here
[2:19:09] here comes that boy and he want to buy
[2:19:11] these dogs. And the owner of the dogs,
[2:19:13] he comes down the staircase and the boy
[2:19:16] says, "I want to have that dog." And the
[2:19:18] owner of the dog says, "Uh, look, why do
[2:19:20] you want to have that dog? He's
[2:19:22] handicapped.
[2:19:23] He doesn't have the value like the rest.
[2:19:25] He cannot run like like the rest. He has
[2:19:27] no value." And the boy put off his
[2:19:30] trousers and from his knee down, he had
[2:19:32] an artificial leg.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; And the boy said, "I want to get this
[2:19:36] dog because when we go out, he
[2:19:38] understands me and I understand him.
[2:19:41] [Applause]
[2:19:42] quote brother Brandham, God became man
[2:19:45] to understand man.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; Quote brother Brandham, God became
[2:19:50] teenager to understand the teenagers.
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; That's what he says that when you pray,
[2:19:56] God knows what you talk about. Blessed
[2:19:58] be the name of the Lord.
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; A person says, "Brother Marcus, my life
[2:20:06] is a dead end." No, no, no. I'm God. He
[2:20:09] is the way. where it seems there is no
[2:20:12] he Jesus is the way. If you have Jesus
[2:20:14] you have a way.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; I don't know when. I don't know how but
[2:20:18] he is the way. Never give up.
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; So that's our life. Everything is
[2:20:25] included. The good days and the bad
[2:20:27] days. In the good days. Praise his name.
[2:20:33] Are there bad days in the message? In
[2:20:35] the bad days do the same.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; Say amen.
[2:20:40] I mean so so so that is our life with
[2:20:45] so if you are on the mountaintop don't
[2:20:47] become arrogant
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; yeah that family with their children
[2:20:54] only believe only believe yeah if man
[2:20:59] god says you don't understand them then
[2:21:01] no problem we will I will make you to
[2:21:02] understand
[2:21:05] if you are on the mountaintop don't
[2:21:06] become arrogant because the next valley
[2:21:08] is waiting for us. But brother, if we
[2:21:11] are in the valley, don't give up, man.
[2:21:14] Don't give up, sister. Don't give up,
[2:21:16] brother. Because the next mountain is
[2:21:18] waiting for you,
[2:21:22] brother.
[2:21:24] And that is the story because our God is
[2:21:28] not the God of the mountains. He's the
[2:21:29] God of the mountains and of the valleys.
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; He says, "I will be with you in the good
[2:21:35] times, but when everything went wrong,
[2:21:36] I'm your father."
[2:21:38] Hallelujah.
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I stand with you when everybody
[2:21:42] forsakes you and you forsake yourself. I
[2:21:44] will never forsake you because I'm your
[2:21:46] father.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; Here's the young man.
[2:21:52] Amen. And that is that is our
[2:21:55] motivation, brother. The time is over.
[2:21:56] We're not in kindergarten anymore of
[2:21:58] these ah you are so blessed in the
[2:22:00] service and blah blah blah. Hey, we are
[2:22:02] men. We became men and women. We know
[2:22:04] what's what's what what what what we
[2:22:06] talk about. He's the boy and therefore
[2:22:09] we are so much in in in in tune with God
[2:22:12] all of us. The boy was a good musician
[2:22:15] and he just played and and and and and
[2:22:18] and and
[2:22:20] uh the concert was over and the old
[2:22:21] people, the audience, they were so
[2:22:25] enthused and everybody was was shouting
[2:22:27] and clapping and applauding and the boy
[2:22:29] just looked up because over there was
[2:22:32] his teacher
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; and he wanted to see if the teacher was
[2:22:36] happy
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; of his performance. And definitely we
[2:22:39] like when people give us little
[2:22:41] compliments, but that's not our it's not
[2:22:43] our fuel for our motor. We want to have
[2:22:46] the grace of God. We want our father to
[2:22:50] say, "Look, I'm proud of you, boy. I'm
[2:22:52] proud how you manage the family. I'm
[2:22:54] proud about your prayer life. I'm proud
[2:22:56] of how you deal with situation. I gave
[2:22:58] you difficult people around you, but I
[2:23:00] see how you take everything under your
[2:23:02] control by the grace and the honor of
[2:23:04] God."
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Can you
[2:23:07] say amen? Amen.
[2:23:08] &gt;&gt; This is really this this a bright
[2:23:11] &gt;&gt; famine. But you can only grow if you
[2:23:14] have that bonding
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; brother. We were we were we were under
[2:23:18] false teaching. We were 20 years in the
[2:23:21] message and didn't know if we were born
[2:23:22] again or not.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; Hey, every altar call we were there
[2:23:26] because we said I need the Holy Ghost
[2:23:27] until we found the right teaching to
[2:23:29] understand we have a new birth. But now
[2:23:32] God is giving giving giving building up.
[2:23:35] He's now giving maturity. It goes from
[2:23:37] step to step. It goes from it's a ladder
[2:23:40] that we're going up and we will have our
[2:23:43] human problems.
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; But the more we grow in Christ, the more
[2:23:47] the human parts goes away.
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; But it's not one convention. It's a pro.
[2:23:51] It's a process.
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:23:55] &gt;&gt; And the music come, the musicians would
[2:23:57] come and and do you love the Lord Jesus?
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; Was this is a good good youth meeting?
[2:24:03] If we were used, we might make an altar
[2:24:05] call right now, but we don't make it
[2:24:06] here. Okay? Because we are all believers
[2:24:09] right now. But brother, never forget
[2:24:11] this message brought us a father.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; In the days of the voice of the seventh
[2:24:16] angel, the mystery of God will be
[2:24:18] revealed. Amen. It's a true story and it
[2:24:22] helps us brother as minister. If if the
[2:24:24] musicians would come and you can play
[2:24:26] softly as a minister,
[2:24:29] as a father, as a brother in the church,
[2:24:33] you have to you have you have to take
[2:24:35] situations under your control.
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; And God is just bringing situations just
[2:24:43] to understand to make us to understand
[2:24:46] how mature we are now.
[2:24:53] Amen. And maybe a little song like I
[2:24:56] have a father. If you play softly, is
[2:24:57] that fine? You know have that song?
[2:24:59] Okay. Amen.
[2:25:03] Have you ever thought in just two
[2:25:04] thoughts and I'm finishing I put
[2:25:06] everything away. Do you love the Lord
[2:25:07] Jesus?
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that makes us together.
[2:25:12] Brother Brham said this. He speaks about
[2:25:15] he he speaks about Job
[2:25:18] and legalistically Job was was a
[2:25:21] tremendous man. Okay. But God just
[2:25:24] wanted to prove him. Brother Blam said
[2:25:26] God didn't want to chastise Job. But God
[2:25:30] wanted to prove what laid in Job.
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and I mean if we are
[2:25:41] psychologically strong healthy people we
[2:25:45] can try to manage things but I talk
[2:25:47] today to many many people they have
[2:25:50] their weak parts in their life. They
[2:25:52] they said if God doesn't change it I
[2:25:54] cannot change it by my own mental
[2:25:56] capacity.
[2:25:58] And when everything was
[2:26:02] lost,
[2:26:04] God just comes on the throne. First God
[2:26:07] comes through a man.
[2:26:10] Four men come to Job. The first is a
[2:26:13] nice Lutheran. He said Job only believe.
[2:26:16] Only believe only. That's nice, brother.
[2:26:18] We don't need if if everything comes
[2:26:20] difficult in our life, I don't need
[2:26:21] Bible slogans. Honestly, I don't need
[2:26:24] quotes of brother Brandham. I need
[2:26:25] reality. Okay? Amen.
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; I don't need just a No, no, no. Okay.
[2:26:30] The second was a nice uh Methodist. Job,
[2:26:33] you need uh that the shivering over your
[2:26:36] back. We all like that shivering, but
[2:26:37] it's not the answer to our questions.
[2:26:39] The third one, Job, you need some gifts.
[2:26:41] We I have a gift, but a gift will never
[2:26:44] replace the giver.
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; But the fourth one was God himself. He
[2:26:49] said Job look man
[2:26:53] you have only some years on this earth
[2:26:55] like a 70 80 years
[2:26:58] and life can become very difficult but
[2:27:01] remember one thing you will become young
[2:27:03] again that's what Elihoo Elh who brother
[2:27:06] said that was God El Shai
[2:27:10] El Elohim Elihoo God says look this life
[2:27:15] is not everything boy okay okay so you
[2:27:19] will become young again because you have
[2:27:22] somebody who paid a price for you. And
[2:27:24] Job said, I know that my redeemer lives.
[2:27:28] And then God speaks from heaven at the
[2:27:31] same time. He said, Job, I want to ask
[2:27:33] you a question. Where were you? And the
[2:27:37] sons of God was shouting for joy.
[2:27:41] Brother God, God can give you a life
[2:27:43] where you are happy, healthy, and
[2:27:45] wealthy. And God can give you a life in
[2:27:48] a wheelchair. That's up to him. It's the
[2:27:50] same God. It's your life. Amen. Your
[2:27:54] life will be your own trophy. Maybe you
[2:27:57] brought nobody to the message to the
[2:27:59] Lord, but you brought yourself. And he
[2:28:02] said, "Lord, I am that trophy. Through
[2:28:03] all life, I held a hold."
[2:28:07] Amen. And God says, "You are that
[2:28:10] trophy. You are the proof that this
[2:28:13] message is not a doctrine. is a reality.
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; You are the proof for that.
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; Character is not is not a nice gift.
[2:28:22] Character is is a vision. And to bring
[2:28:25] it into practice, um as for me and my
[2:28:28] house, there's no question. It's not as
[2:28:31] for me and my house, we have to because
[2:28:33] I want to be saved. I want No, no, no.
[2:28:36] We are so much in love with Jehovah God.
[2:28:39] As for me and my house, we want to serve
[2:28:43] the Lord. For us, the message is not
[2:28:45] obligation. It is a love letter from my
[2:28:48] father.
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; And really finishing with with with with
[2:28:54] the last thought. It's a true story,
[2:28:56] brother. It it and sister and it helped
[2:28:58] me a lot because God bring a lot of
[2:29:01] conflicts among brothers, among families
[2:29:04] just to see where we are standing. It's
[2:29:06] in my life, it's in your life.
[2:29:08] Definitely.
[2:29:10] You see there were one day in Germany
[2:29:12] there were there were two very famous uh
[2:29:16] composers and musicians
[2:29:18] Johan Strauss and Yuan Strauss father
[2:29:23] they make all these walts you know what
[2:29:25] they call the waltz king very very
[2:29:27] famous in 1980s something like this both
[2:29:30] became very very famous very phenomenal
[2:29:34] but one day the father was envious of
[2:29:37] the
[2:29:38] because he was more popular than the
[2:29:40] father. A lot of operas come from from
[2:29:42] that area. Strauss Johan Strauss and
[2:29:45] Yuan Strauss father. You don't say
[2:29:47] Yuan's son because he was more popular
[2:29:49] than the father. So they separated. One
[2:29:52] time in Vienna they made a concert but
[2:29:55] separated. And the father
[2:29:58] hope I'm not crying but okay.
[2:30:02] And the father was playing on one side
[2:30:05] and the boy was playing on the other
[2:30:07] side and
[2:30:09] and as the son was much more popular
[2:30:12] than the father all the people came to
[2:30:14] the son and the boy watched his father
[2:30:17] you know and then the boy used such a
[2:30:19] wisdom that I said man that must that
[2:30:21] boy must have had the holy ghost if not
[2:30:22] you cannot do that thing he saw that
[2:30:25] nobody was now watching to the father he
[2:30:27] made a little pause he said I will now
[2:30:30] play a piece
[2:30:32] from a person that I respect a lot.
[2:30:34] That's my own father. And he played that
[2:30:36] piece from his father.
[2:30:39] And when the father heard that the boy
[2:30:42] was playing his piece, the father came
[2:30:45] to his son. Amen. And he waited up and
[2:30:48] he he he gave his son a hug of saying,
[2:30:52] "Hey boy, you're my boy." Amen. And I
[2:30:55] thought by myself, what a wisdom to
[2:30:58] deescalate that situation between the
[2:31:01] father. That's what the mind of Christ
[2:31:04] is given for that nothing ever
[2:31:09] will will separate us from the love of
[2:31:11] God.
[2:31:13] &gt;&gt; This message is more than a doctrine
[2:31:15] because the mind of God came down to
[2:31:17] take every situation under the control
[2:31:21] of the Holy Ghost.
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:31:25] &gt;&gt; What a time that we live in. And I thank
[2:31:27] the pastor for giving me that time. Um,
[2:31:29] we have a wonderful father. Amen. A
[2:31:33] wonderful Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we have the song I have a
[2:31:37] father. Would you sing it with me?

[2:34:00] &gt;&gt; The whole church was praying that you're

[2:34:06] these kids. God finds them one day.

[2:34:10] Amen. Because God was not ashamed when
[2:34:12] we were in the world. We were still part
[2:34:15] of God. Amen. A great shalom. Thank you
[2:34:18] for the liberty. And let's sing the song
