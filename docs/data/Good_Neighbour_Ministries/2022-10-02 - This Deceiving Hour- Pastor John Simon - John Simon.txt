[Music] good morning Saints welcome into the house the Lord this morning from The Book of Psalms chapter 2. foreign [Music] as I'm reading this scripture just keep that in your minds why do the Heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing Kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and against his anointed saying let us break their bands asunder and Cast Away their courts from us he that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh the Lord shall have them in duration then shall he speak unto them in his wrath and Vex them in his sore displeasure yet have I set my king upon my Holy Hill of Zion I will declare the decree the Lord hath said unto me thou art my son this day have I begotten thee ask of me and I shall give Thee the Heathen for thine inheritance and the uttermost parts of the Earth for thy possession Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron Thou shalt Dash them in pieces like a Potter's vessel be wise now

and to any of our visitors here we welcome you here in the presence of the Lord and to all of you Saints God bless you for looking and seeing the hour that we are living in and the word for this hour not just what we call the message but um as Paul said feed the flock of God which is among you amen so we thank the Lord that we recognize these things glory to God we want to talk uh today if you don't mind on this deceiving hour for we live in a very dark and dangerous time a matter of fact the Bible itself calls it in the last days perilous times shall come prophecy shall come and we you can read that chapter you will see all the things it's telling you supposed to take place in this day that we are living in and uh I'm glad that I can be here to identify um with the word of God in the sense that we not just I we are the Fulfillment of that word we are the living revelation of that word amen we are we are part of the prophecy and we're living in the Fulfillment of the prophecy and so our hearts rejoice in him in his great grace and uh Mercy praise the Lord I am just going to uh read Matthew 24. and we are going to read from verse 22. right on to verse 28. glory to God of course you know no one scripture can cover everything you want to say because now the scriptures is just a great circle on ending right praise God hallelujah okay let's read from the screen or from your Bible if you have it it's better for me to read from the screen because these days you know with the it's okay I can read it but it's easier for me to read it up there let me put it that way praise the Lord amen and accept those days should be shortened there would be no flesh saved but for the next sake those days shall be shortened then if any man shall see unto you law there is Christ or there believe it not for there shall arrive false christs and false prophets and shall show Great Signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect behold I have told you before in other words I told you beforehand so that you are warned you know what to expect you know what to watch for or what to look for I'm going to stop there so that we can go on into the word of God let us pray our gracious father before this righteous meal that you have prepared for us we pray that you will bless us bless our hearts bless the ground may be quickened to the word to receive the word and Lord let let it come to life let it live and let the word become clearer and clearer and clearer to us until we walk into the perfect light so you'll be all the glory praise and honor in Jesus name amen God bless you hallelujah amen oh my what an hour that we're living in but we are looking back and we're looking at the scripture that we just read because obviously people were already being deceived right in the day when Jesus was here on Earth now bear in mind that Jesus is the word all of the word of God and while he was here the same Satan who confronted him on the mountain is now was now confronting him uh in his ministry while upon the Earth when they could not defeat him the word they couldn't defeat him the Living Word then they had to or Satan had to um renew his strategy of being able to Blind them deafen and deceive people away from that word so many people were deceived and many were being deceived we have the same thing in our day many are already deceived and many are also being deceived now Jesus has told us that with the coming of the son of man that's the coming of Christ in the form of the son of man coming in the coming of the son of man here again uh well there will arise a time of great deception here upon us and he made it clear and I'm going to make it clear here by his grace that this deception now he wasn't talking about the deception in his day because he was on the scene and he could deal with that while he was here on the scene but he was prophesying in that hour of the coming of the son of man and you know the scripture where he says as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the day of the coming of the son of man or the day when the son of man would be revealed amen praise God and he is saying that that will be a day of great deception and prophesying ahead of time again so that we are aware of what the deception will be he said it but come during the time of the Pentecostals and the Pentecostal age so well where did you see that where did Jesus say that well listen Matthew 7 beware of false prophets if you ever had them it's in this day everybody is a prophet and they really don't even know what a who a real Prophet is many of them are mistaken a gift of Prophecy for a prophet who is a gift of God to a generation total difference right so it's a difference not just people that receive gifts to prophesy amen but the entire man that was sent is the gift of that the age or generation that the people are in listen to the Lord himself beware of false prophets who will come to you uh acting like Christians where we know sheep is is the people of God uh sheep you know your people are like the sheep or the pasture many scriptures will tell you that he's really telling you in this hour people are going to come under the guise of Christianity is that right but they're going to be false prophets right now he's going to describe them a little more you shall know them by their fruits do men gather grips of thorns or fix of Twisted Teslas even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupts three bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good free every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is Hyundai is that right it's going to be cut off it's going to be cast in the fire okay no matter how religious it looks no matter how nice it looks no matter how Cherry tablet looks this tree is after a while after its many branches it's gonna put out and all the fruits it's going to bear that's going to be cut down wherefore by their fruits you shall know them now listen not everyone that said unto me Lord Lord not everybody that says Jesus is Lord I believe in Jesus not everybody that say uh oh um you know Jesus died for my sins or or ran to the Altar and say I'm born again and that not everyone that says these things is truly born again and he's saying You must be aware of this because at that time the deception will be so strong that only this Holy Spirit himself will be able to differentiate it which means you don't go around judging people no but let the Holy Spirit do that for himself but I'm here to make you aware we are living in this power that is a deceiving hour and let God bear me with us here today and may the Holy Spirit of the Living God take his word and bear witness to what I'm saying not because I'm saying it or I'm anybody because this invisible this great one he is the one he is the word he gave his word and his word cannot return to him boy I believe it no you listen and now many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied preached in thy name and in thy name now we're talking about this this deceiving hour he is identifying what hour it will come in it will come in the hour the same time while the son of man is being revealed or revealing himself this devil will also start to bring in his Spirit of deception in a stronger way now we know the mystery of iniquity we know the trail of the serpent we know how that the darkness of sin and evil Started From The Garden of Eden we watched it travel down all of the ages until this hour that we're living in and we are encouraged by the Lord that we should be vigilant our eyes should be open we should be sensitive to the Holy Spirit we should let God have his way within our life and recognize what he is doing not yesterday we can give all the Bible studies on what happened to our thousands of years ago uh oh but what is God doing now is that right the Great I was or The Great I Am see God is an ever-present God he is not a dead God but he is a living God that is why Hebrews 13 8 says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the Eternal one the perfect one the reason one Christ who lives forever [Applause] more hallelujah praise God Amen no uh how they'll say have we not prophesied in thy name amen we're talking about these wolves in sheep's clothing we're talking about these uh Christians that outwardly amen Christians that will come sin have we not cast out even devils in thy name an invite name done many wonderful works miracles signs wonders they're gonna do them right oh my and then will I profess and say unto them I never knew you depart from me you workers of iniquity now now let's go to this what is inequity what is Iniquity iniquity is knowing what you ought to do and refusing to do it not doing it you're absolutely not doing it just like okay in knowing what to do but in Rebellion he doesn't want to do it he he just fought against it is that right listen now children of Disobedience what does that mean children of rebellion because Disobedience even to a simple appearance telling a child to do something and they don't do it and they refuse to do it it's a form of rebellion right God telling his children his people what to do how to do it and they don't do it and refuse to do it it's a form disobedience is rebellion okay oh my oh praise God now I'm quoting brother Branham saying here I looked that up in the dictionary to be sure for Rebellion is repelling against what you must rebel against something now rebel against what he said that is rebelling against the revealed word of God amen hallelujah now I want you to see there not that there they weren't rebelling against the written word they can give all kinds of Bible studies and all kinds of teachings on the written word that is fixed it cannot change the word of God doesn't change it's written it's here it doesn't change so he can get he can Rebel uh he can now go ahead along with the written War but when it comes to the revealed word that is being a momentum moment revealed from this word then he can't deal with that right he can impersonate this but he can't impersonate that and so it gets him in a a terrible state of being he doesn't know what to do amen remember revealed against they that rebelled against the revealed word of God I'm trying to pull myself here together right because I'm I find I'm being quickened okay and then it makes me talk faster so I'm just just trying to come to myself here amen listen Rebel rebelling against the revealed word of God just like King he rebelled against Abel's revealed revelation Abel's Vindicated revelation revindicated of God that it was righteous it was right it was true but he revealed he rebelled against it you see and Cain rebelled against it and slew his brother because of the Revelation that his brother had let me say this again you must understand when the Bible just says by faith Abel amen offered a better Sacrifice by faith what is Faith Revelation because of Revelation on the word the written word not that there was any in that day but because of the Revelation written word we can offer a better sacrifice but at the time when the Bible says that Abel revelation of knowing that it was Lamb's blood amen that had to be shared there was no writings there was nothing for him to refer to so how did he know you see that is the knowing that only comes from God that Daniel speaks about in Daniel 12 there will be a people that will come that will know their God God is the word they will know their God hallelujah praise God and I thank God that he sent a prophet in our generation and that the word of God has come to us and that word continues to unfold like a Roman Candle it keeps exploding and expanding and growing by the grace of God and that's why we are here this morning not just to listen to dead words but to listen to him the Living Word bring his word to us speak to us Quicken us straighten Us in this hour and the day in which we are living amen praise the Lord hallelujah now praise God of course we let me repeat again brother Venom didn't say that he they rebelled against the written word no sir but they rebelled against the revealed word of the Living God and that's where you always find the rebellion and the Rebellion comes because he doesn't know what to do with it he doesn't know where it's coming from he can't position himself that he could receive some of it and that he becomes jealous of the persons that are receiving that Revelation from the presence of almighty God just like he did with Abel jealousy caused them to do that and now it's the same thing coming again jealousy again because God is doing the same thing out Hallelujah he rebelled can't rebelled against the revealed word why did he rebel against it one he despised it how could it be a lamb oh this bloody rough crude kind of worship that he is presenting that to God and I have my flowers and my Altar and my candles and I have my beautiful Saturns and my you know purples and greens and Browns and I have my tiled floor and my plush seats and I have a wonderful attendance of people who are not of the lower class and the lower order but of the higher order how can that even compare with my altar My Worship my offering and then he comes out of nowhere where with this rough crude bloody having a lamb taking a rock sharp like a knife and hitting that Ram's neck until the thing is bloody bleeding the blood's praying on him everywhere until he himself is a bloody mess and then you have to tell me God accepts that the fire falls and drops on that sacrifice and leaves mine right there he doesn't recognize that those beautiful flowers are good but they are the works of his hands this other one by revelation God I can't explain fully what that is to you you have to receive that from God hallelujah just as much as I have told you and I've said to you even if your back has turned and someone is behind you you know but how do you know how do you know nobody has to tell you but you absolutely are positive and sure that there is someone standing behind you and you know it no Revelation is akin to that right not saying it's the same thing but it's akin to that you are believing and knowing something you have not seen you have not heard you you you just know we say oh well well uh you love your wife yes of course I love more how do you know her you don't have to just writing on a piece of paper there's something between you and her that goes back and forth that you are certain and the True Believer the spirit of God lives in this world going back and forth between your heart and the word of God nobody has to tell you but you are second of God you recognize who you are you recognize who he is and together you can say I am my father are one amen praise the god of Heaven hallelujah amen yes sir he despised the word the revealed word of God because it did not come in the manufactured human way of coming so he totally despise it in that way and because it despises it he disobeyed it and you also dissipated because of who that word was coming through why him not me you know because of course he thinks he he's more cultured he's more civilized he is more understanding and everything else like that and I bet he was more of a gentleman than than this rough crude Abel and so uh he just couldn't receive that he just could not see that not knowing that right through the Bible from start to end God always used the most unusual characters foreign is that right oh my it could never be how could it be a hairy guy like that with a a stinking camel skin stinks without your own odor mixed into that and that is all the clothing Elijah had forget this fanciful pictures of Elijah with his hand pointing you know artistic not cultural pictures and artistic pictures but the real fact the man lived in the desert and if you went to the deserts of Judea as I have and some of you have you will understand there's hardly any water anywhere and he had nowhere to go take a nice bath and a shower thank you I'm sorry I'm preaching like this oh my praise God hallelujah amen now but that isn't that isn't and that is why they also have a wrong picture of Jesus because Jesus is going wrong speaking great educated Greek and Roman and this and that uh we we know that Dr lamsa and many other other teachers let us know that he he spoke the Plain Street language amen sit down with the fisherman and they're laughing and they're talking and one of them say you know they're joking and then they turn around to Jesus who was sitting amongst them you know he wasn't sitting in a way to say I am the almighty God amongst you know he was just an ordinary man made himself of no reputation and one of them slapped him on the shoulder and said what do you think about Herod and Jesus turned I said how dare you ask me a question like no he said Herod he's nothing but a fox ah right oh my what is the truth nothing but a fox and they all laughed like that praise God you see but you must understand that God's uh children and his servants God deliberately uses them as a veil and he hides behind that Veil as it was in the temple with the badger skins the goat skins that were hanging there and the glory was behind those scans God does the same thing in our day in the most unsuspecting ways except we have spiritual eyes to recognize and see what God is doing not back there but in this hour this time what is God doing in this season and time your wind blows worth less than no man knows where it goes so are the sons of God born by the spirit of the Living God hallelujah amen yes sir so later not King now but later on we see that same Spirit of rebellion that Spirit of Disobedience that Spirit of iniquity amen that began working true Judas who was now with Jesus rebelling against Jesus who was the revealed word of that hour revealing the word and he's rebelling against the word maybe not openly he wasn't coming out and said Jesus I don't believe what you're teaching he didn't no no no no no no he was quietly listening to every word Jesus saying so that he could just make a critique on that right the Bible puts it this way they marked his mouth that means they had pen pencil and whatever and they just take notes on what he was saying and ready to take that and use the ever karmeneutic apologetic every logic every whatever to to break it down and prove it was not so uh of that nature like that but that Spirit had got a hold of Judas and was working through Judas you know what the Bible tells us he was the son of perdition he was born to deceive he was born to be a liar he was born to do that in that hour when Jesus was on the scene Hallelujah imagine that the word revealed the word Vindicated amen and the word living in that hour and he was rebelling against the revealed Vindicated living word for that day and for that hour and he was fighting it resisting it rebelling against it Hallelujah that's what he was doing right there amen yes sir oh my I quote again now the Roman caterpillar started eating on the tree the bright tree and Paul said I am persuaded that after my departing men shall arise amongst you you didn't say most viruses it is their Master's addresses he did not say among the epicureans the stoics or The Libertines or some other group no but they will arise from right amongst you you who are Christians amongst you Christians amongst you who I'm preaching to and I'm teaching the word of God Amen from amongst you will arise men Hallelujah well and I'm not sure Brethren uh like with sheepskins over them amen and with but with a wolf spirit on the inside oh my that will always try to be drawing you away amen after them you see for Paul continue to speak for the spirit of antichrist that you heard was to come into the world is already in the world and now working now working in the children of disobedience again I repeat this obedient to what this obedient to the revealed word they'll agree with you on you can quote scriptures and everything else that's wonderful and we should and we should always every Christian should read their Bible pray every day amen singing spiritual Psalms worshiping and glorifying God but what I'm saying is the very instrument the very thing that you use or you see God making himself known to you through the word he turns around and uses that very instrument as a means of Deceit deception to delude and to divide and destroy my think about it now we see it here clear in the word amen all my not not your 7 21-23 not everyone that said unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven as we read before but him that doeth the word that with the will of my father this is what the scripture says but I'm letting you come to understand what he's saying but he who does the word who obeys the word who lives the word of my father that's the ones right oh praise God for many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name they're emphasizing their Christianity that they are also Christians okay and in thy name we have cast out devils and in thy name we have done many wonderful works miracles we've done miracles now people accept Miracle signs wonders tongues speaking in tongues and all these things as the evidence and uh it's absolutely not it's absolutely not the evidence acts 4 well I was I I was the Assembly of God I was in their Bible College and I was believing the same thing and one day while I was just a teenager oh my praying for this uh School mate for mine and the devil started speaking in tongues beautiful towns uh but in the middle of that let me say this and you received once something revealed to me that's not me that's him so we turned around and say Satan in the name of Jesus Christ we rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ and that devil laughed laughed out loud also you caught me you caught me then he tells you know where he was from in the days of Jesus and he goes through his whole history down in France than in England it's gone in the country there and how he got into this person but the fact is what I'm trying to tell you it was right then the Holy Spirit revealed to me not all tongues is the tongues of the Holy Spirit not all tongues is the tongues of God some it's nothing but Devils get amongst the people unlocking the people of God and mocking the word of God under the guise of speaking in tongues amen praise God I can't go and say well all tongues is up there no you can't say that it's in the Bible but the fact is that is not the initial evidence because then it will be a faulty evidence but we know that receiving the word of God by Revelation in your heart is the evidence because you can't receive that word unless God had placed something in you where the Deep calls to the Deep and a deep must respond Hallelujah for what you're born to you're born to this word you're born to what God called you to be amen not what I want to be or what you want to be what what God wants you to be amen hallelujah o praise God I feel the pull I've Heard a Voice amen and it told to me the love and grace of almighty God hallelujah amen yes sir praise God so in this scripture what do we see Jesus is highlighting the fact that though these people were religious amen and all these people who are Spirit-filled oh my these people were Spirit-filled and and claiming to know him claiming that they're born again and everything else like that amen uh and then they begin to pile up their works and and we did this in your and your name and we we did this we cast out Devils we look I have seen and met with men uh ministers that got all kinds of gifts signs wonders miracles amen but it's another thing when God begins to reveal then once that devil gets mad what's that devil look you know some of you know of the case here a minister came by and they said oh he had a great gift and he can you know he's coming down the road and he can tell you what's up there and what's there and and so he came to preaching the church and in the middle of preaching I'm sitting listening rejoicing make everybody and all of a sudden that's not me again that's not me that's so so so so so so so so after it's finished he comes down you go into the office say well um sir I perceive that you are and identify what he really how dare you well tell me I'm this and I'm that I've been to other bigger churches and and they never I said but you're not there in the bigger churches you are here my deacons are here you want me to look foolish then just expose me if I'm telling a lie just say it's a lie and then I'll be exposed and I said but you know why you're not doing that because it's the truth and you know when you talk against that who you really are talking against right so he stays quiet like that I said well you know I can't let you stay around here you have to leave and of course you have to leave and of course three about three weeks later the RCMP comes to me and says we have this reference and so in jail because he did this this this exactly the same thing that I told him and he was saying oh I don't do that I am I'm a real man of God and isn't that they had him in jail oh my brother sister that's not to highlight me what's that for you to understand that there is a true and living God Satan has confused the issue by putting hundreds of thousands of these people talking about Miracle signs wonders healings this that the other and meanwhile God just has a simple ordinary View amen and works by that for his glory not for their Glory but for his glory that we might know that he is the great one he is The Great I Am we are nothing we are just Sons and Daughters walking in his will but he is the Mighty God all hail the power of Jesus name all praise God let Angels prostrate fall bring forth the Royal diadem and crown him Lord of all amen religious Spirit-filled claiming to know him claiming for what they did and what they did in his name but Jesus makes it clear in that hour because he's talking about the same hour when the son of man comes same hour like in the days of lot these things are going to happen and behold I have told you in other words beforehand so when it starts happening modern events can be made clear by this prophecy and you would recognize what is happening here because he says You must recognize they are nothing but actors they are impersonators and they are deceivers but I've told you beforehand that you might recognize Interlopers or those who try to climb through a window or crank through get through some other way to enter into his kingdom but Jesus said I never knew you is that right oh my we don't want to go off on that now but just to give you an Insight I never knew you Hallelujah the Bible talks about those whose names already on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world their names are written there already in the page white and fair in the book of his kingdom their names are there amen and so these ones your name isn't there you're posing you're acting you're impersonating you're deceiving you're even producing all kinds of uh made up proof that you know like that but I don't see your name on the page yeah let me go another way so if you did all these great works like Paul said in uh First Corinthians 13. uh you did all these works and all these Charities and all that it profited nothing your name isn't on the book so what is that now I want you to know this is the bright age we have already come through the seven Church ages all right and we are now in the bright age and as we said uh the last night this is the Harvest Time all the seeds uh natural and spiritual that were planted in Genesis down through the ages are now coming to their fullness and fruition is that right and now the Angels the servants The Messengers of God are here to pick up that Harvest and that's why we want to thank God that all the other other all the other Ages were believing Jesus will come in their day and take the bride away take the believing Church away amen but because we know we are there past the last Church age we know this is the rapture age this is the time when he promised he would come again and we are not guessing we are not hoping we are not maybe so but we haven't assurance foreign we have an assurance from him amen that is coming again to pick up his bride amen hallelujah praise God hallelujah now this age has been called by God's servant at judician age we know there's not really any words like that there is no but uh Judas Tyrion age uh yeah judiciarian age Amen in other words it's different from all the other ages that have already passed because all the other ages that pass had churches with the bride in them no matter how rotten no matter how evil no matter what they've done what whatever took place just like Jezebel in the Bible when Elijah thought I'm the only one that believes you oh great Jehovah I'm representing you God says that's wonderful and you're doing good work but I have some more in Jezebel's Palace there they're right out there right in the midst of that idolatry right in the midst of all that mess and they're eating from our table also and I want them to stay there until I'm ready to call them out is that right God has it that way even now amen praise God and so we see that the church seven churches they had churches plus the bride in the church but once the church ages have come to an end and we have moved from and the angel already cried Revelation 10 at that time time shall be no more not speaking about all time for the Earth but the time allotted for the church ages is now over past right and so then the bride steps off the end of the cliff and she already start moving into what we will use a human term Eternal Church age she not you can have something Eternal and at the same time being an age but that's just a term that we can understand but you're broken to Eternity by the grace of almighty God but when you break into that realm of Eternity no church can follow you there is no church over there the churches path it's the bride over there and she is walking under that Eternal presence and power of almighty God and she has kept not by uh Doctrine she's not kept by ministers and Priests having to watch uh every move you make and listen which they're doing their job and they're supposed to do their job but I'm just saying that the time comes when you're no more under School Masters and so on right where where nobody has to tell you what to eat and what not to eat and what to drink and what not to drink and these types of things right but praise God now when the bright crosses over amen there there is no church it's only the bride it's really only the bride existing in that realm because to be in that realm you've got to have eternal life to be in that realm you've got to be a germ of God a gene of God a son a seed son or daughter of the Living God that you have to be there praise God how you how they're going to be there so they can't be there whatsoever amen so it's only the bride up there now praise God in this church age so then the battle comes down now between not Satan hiding behind churches not Satan hiding behind church members using them as a veil but but it's Satan now has to come in the open uh to come against the bride and to fight against her amen yes sir as it is mentioned just as Eve had to come but face to face with the devil Genesis so will this eve at this end time have to come face to face with the evil one again right she got to have that battle with him again but this one will overcome because this one has the word this one has the sword of the spirit therefore she will overcome by the grace of God hallelujah amen yes sir Satan deceiving and impersonating and pretending to be a bride because now he can't he can't try to you know show himself like he's a church because the real bride recognize how he used the church our churches and work through them right in that way so he's got to change his strategy so he is also coming as a right too so he he is like you're right I'm right she might be a bridesmaid but he doesn't care he's going to still say he's the bride but anyway he's claiming that he is bright like that amen hallelujah but let this be known the servant of God for this hour has said did the real deception did not start until after the seals were broken deception was there all the time but now everything is coming into this consummation and therefore Satan got to come to a point where he started accumulating his evil to come against the sons and US of God for in them is all the righteousness all the Revelation all the word of God through all the prophets is accumulated in the bright Church of the last day for him to raise for him to fight against that he's got to accumulate his evil and everything else together to be able to come against her but we we serve a God who knows better than that for when the enemy comes in like a flood I will raise up a standard against him one shall chase a thousand true shall Chase ten thousand that is the promise of God we have in this world and we are resting on that amen thank God forevermore hallelujah amen yes sir praise God now you've got to realize just as I've hinted to a Spoke just now that Satan now has been accumulating natural wisdom intelligence he's been accumulating all the craft and shrewdness that he can accumulate down through all these ages mixed in with a lot of logic and lots of Reason uh reasoning powers and Gathering all these Powers together to come against the Bride of Jesus Christ praise the Lord am I really making sense to you here praise the Lord Oh Praise this wonderful name amen hallelujah now why is he doing this why is he all of a sudden getting frantic and starting calling up all his troops and Gathering his wisdom his knowledge because he's got to come to fight against faith for its wisdom versus faith and so he's got to have that all put together but all these things God if he receives if the devil reads his Bible he will know it's useless for it is not by might nor by power but by my spirit see it in the Lord God has promised that in his word amen by his Spirit God will fulfill his blessed holy word amen yes sir I'm so thankful for that that God is so great amen hallelujah now remember when Moses came in before pharaoh and when Moses came he took out his rod and with his rod he threw it on the floor and and they jumped back because the Run came into a snake oh my oh my well of course Jenny's and jambres Moses they said well what is that you think you're the only one can do that and they they just come out and they throw their rods on the ground but the rods became snake too is that right oh confusing the issue Satan always likes to confuse the issue and um what should I say create a circumstance of discrepancy where people begin to doubt the word because they're not sure because you have all these other alternatives is that right you have uh I mean you just yesterday I went to the grocery store and old man was there complaining look how many of these things they have all of them look the same but yet they they're slightly different you know you see you see why is it create a seed of discrepancy he created a seed of discrepancy where he can't be sure unless your mind your heart is on the original word and you don't take your eyes off the word but to keep looking at the word you keep looking away to Jesus you recognize him and you're still right with the word you don't sweat to the left hand nor to the right hand but to press on with Jesus and Jesus alone oh praise God I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them I said I'm glad I can send one of them amen one of God's despised few that stays with the word of God hallelujah I want you to know praise the Lord that Through the Ages Satan has actually mastered the manipulation of Miracles is that right Oh my he is mastered how to produce miracles he's even mastered tongues oh my they can we have uh brothers that were here that were in some of their great so-called Revival meetings and people claiming they get in the Holy Spirit falling on the ground and quacking like a duck rolling around and Hee Haw like a donkey another one hissing like a snake or claiming to receive the Holy Ghost ultimate they don't really know the Holy Ghost do you think any spiritual manifestation is the Holy Ghost but it's not amen because you've got the Holy Spirit and you've got Satan's Spirit working out there and the Holy Spirit God has to show you how to cut away and the difference in the midst of all that amen praise God hallelujah amen praise God so we see when his master tongues a mastered manipulation of Miracles but now he's come down to the real thing he can impersonate all those but now the challenge to him is this age now is to impersonate the word he has now to impersonate the word how are you going to impersonate the word unless you become the word or be a part of the word that's the only way amen praise the Lord hallelujah so we find out to conquer that his wisdom has increased to such an extent that he can literally 99.9 percent impersonate this message this form of Christianity he can impersonate it right you know some of the uh Christian Science as said can show more love and display more patience godliness some of those priests can show more of those virtues alter their lives than many so-called Christians isn't that right oh my look at those back in Jesus today those rabbis could you know take up a needle and stick it in the Torah and quote every verse without even turning the page and tell you where that thing is touching amen praise God challenge him the word well he they had wisdom of the word but he was the word and that's a huge difference amen oh my goodness praise God now we see here so close amen he's going to impersonate it so close until the natural person with your natural eyes you can't tell the difference you can't do it it's the Holy Ghost is going to have to come now and reveal that to you now under this atmosphere realizing can go on and talk and make known the word of God to you for another two hours or so not that I'm going to keep you for that time I'm conscious and aware of the moving of the Holy Spirit and so therefore I'll just share some more with you uh as we move on Hallelujah so we can't as humans just see that impersonation with our natural eyes or with natural uh wisdom amen praise the Lord but Satan's problem is when he had the written word there's something tangible he can look at and he can be a copycat he can impersonate it but when the word starts to come to an individual or individuals by the god Supernatural process of Revelation not from a bible school not from a college amen I I had all of that but the fact is that's not what Revelation is Revelation is God speaking to the individual praise God individual and Satan has no way of breaking into that encrypted communication foreign oh my it's beautiful it's just wonderful hallelujah amen but he has a problem now where the written word has a morphid itself into the unwritten word amen and how is he going to copy the unwritten word uh I'm talking so much that the you know the seven Thunders when the seventh thunder sound you heard the sound but what did the voice say what what I'm saying is he doesn't know what the voice said or is saying but he knows there was a sound there's a sound there's a gospel sound it's a Bible sound and he can go on with all of that and the titillating uh the ears and minds of the people but for the real truth and the revelation of God's word to penetrate the hearts and lives of the people that is not the doing of man that's the doing of the Holy Spirit and if I stand here and I spoke to you no matter what I say to you here and the Holy Spirit was not here and he doesn't confirm the word it doesn't mean that amen praise God hallelujah amen God wants to take me here like you did Philip and put the American talk to thousands of people in a Revival breaks out amen praise God he wants to take me and put me in a house where I witness only to two people they get comforted amen praise God whatever God wants that's what I want that's what you should want that's whatever every one of us should walk praise God glory to God hallelujah so he can't see the unwritten word he can't know the unwritten word but he can make a 99.9 educated guess of what it is and then try to let you talk to you and act in such a way as if I got it too I know it too I I receive it too I receive the same you see there's all kinds of Christians but in the midst of that you have believers you have unbelievers and you got make-believers and you the holy spirit of God has got to distill crystallize all of this and make it clear to you and I I can't do that as a pastor or as a preacher the Holy Spirit has to do that on an individual basis through the believer praise the name of the Lord hallelujah my next thought was here the hour is dark and God has just now started to show to us Satan's deceiving activities within what we call the message is that right let's let's end here uh for today by the grace of God and may the Lord richly uh bless every one of us here in the house that don't watch uh Washington come here music praise the name of the Lord let's Worship the Lord of wild would you mind hallelujah amen thank you I repeat we are not here to produce a nice religious presentation it's not something that we are we're here to produce a beautiful singing uh preaching something that can go on the internet and bring in thousands more of people and that sort of thing no many of you know that that's not what I am about right not at all but we are here to for God to call in his Chosen Few his little flock the speckled verb and so on that is what we are here for and that's not something we can do he knows his own and he said I have them in the palms of my hands and no one is going to take them out why because they are kept by the power of God through faith amen praise the Lord hallelujah what song is that you have there I've got a revelation [Music] God is [Music] [Applause] [Music] of Freedom destinations [Music] [Applause]
