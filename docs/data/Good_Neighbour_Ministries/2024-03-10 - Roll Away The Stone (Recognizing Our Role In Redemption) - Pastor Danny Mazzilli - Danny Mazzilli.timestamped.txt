[37:57] this day on Amen let's read from the
[38:00] scripture we're going to read from St
[38:02] John
[38:03] 11 verses 37 to
[38:06] 44
[38:08] amen and the scripture starts and and
[38:11] and some of them said could not this man
[38:14] which opened the eyes of the blind have
[38:17] caused that even this man should not
[38:19] have
[38:20] died Jesus therefore again groaning in
[38:23] himself cometh to the Grave it was a
[38:26] cave and a stone laid upon it Jesus said
[38:30] take ye away the stone Martha the sister
[38:33] of him that was dead saith unto him Lord
[38:37] by this time he stinketh for he hath
[38:40] been dead four days Jesus said unto her
[38:44] said I not unto thee that if thou
[38:47] wouldest believe thou should us see the
[38:49] glory of
[38:50] God then they took away the Stone from
[38:53] the place where the dead was laid and
[38:57] Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father
[39:00] I thank thee that thou has heard me and
[39:03] I knew that thou hearest me always but
[39:06] because of the people which stand by I
[39:09] said it that they may believe that thou
[39:13] Hast sent me and when he thus had spoken
[39:17] he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come
[39:21] forth and he that was dead came forth
[39:25] bound hand and foot with grave clothes
[39:29] and his face was bound about with a
[39:31] napkin and Jesus saith unto them loose
[39:35] him and let him
[39:38] go may the Lord add His blessings to the
[39:41] word please be
[39:43] seated so we're entering into the Easter
[39:46] season and we all know that the next you
[39:49] know in the next three weeks next two to
[39:51] three weeks uh right at the end of the
[39:52] month will be um in the Easter weekend
[39:57] and so uh the Lord has just led me you
[39:59] know into a small series here um of roll
[40:03] away the stone and um so today as we um
[40:07] look at this we're going to be uh just
[40:10] kind of seeing how it is that this you
[40:13] know relates to us how it is that you
[40:16] know that that here we are you know
[40:18] we're we're Christians we're going to
[40:20] church we're living Our Lives we're
[40:23] we're believing the word of God we're
[40:24] trusting the Lord Jesus and and and it's
[40:27] all based on one thing it's all based on
[40:32] the fact that the Lord
[40:34] Jesus rose from the dead amen it's all
[40:37] based on the resurrection our whole
[40:40] experience is based on the fact that
[40:42] Christ came and died for our sins took
[40:46] them to the Cross nailed everything to
[40:49] the Cross when he nailed himself to the
[40:52] Cross we were in him he nailed all of
[40:54] our sins to the cross amen and so when
[40:58] he died for us by us accepting Jesus
[41:01] Christ as the the the the sacrifice and
[41:05] taking place taking our place for our
[41:08] sin we walk free amen praise God and so
[41:13] today um you know I'm saying this is a
[41:17] call to
[41:19] action this is a call to recognize our
[41:23] role as Christians as sons and Daughters
[41:26] of God and what it is that God has given
[41:30] us as a part of this Plan of Redemption
[41:33] our part we have a specific part to play
[41:37] why does God call people he's calling
[41:40] them into his body when he calls them
[41:42] into his body he's calling them to take
[41:45] their positions it's a call to reach the
[41:48] Lost amen it's a call to recognize that
[41:51] Christ is in
[41:53] us through US reaching other others
[41:57] that's what Christianity is all about
[41:59] and you know it was said by the preacher
[42:01] Charles spur Spurgeon once he said every
[42:05] Christian is either a missionary or an
[42:08] impostor y amen wow what a statement Jes
[42:12] what a statement praise God you know a
[42:15] lot of people oh I'm a Christian oh yeah
[42:17] I go to church it's more than saying
[42:20] you're a Christian it's more than saying
[42:21] I go to church it's allowing Jesus
[42:25] Christ to become Lord in your life it's
[42:28] allowing him to come in and transform
[42:30] you change you take you out of a life of
[42:33] unbelief and place you into a life where
[42:37] all things are possible amen glory to
[42:41] God a call to reach the lost a call to
[42:45] recognize that Christ is in US amen
[42:49] praise God this is a supernatural call
[42:52] it's an individual call this is not like
[42:56] oh I'm going to join a church and if I
[42:58] join a church then I'm going to be saved
[43:01] salvation does not come as a result of
[43:04] you joining a church salvation comes as
[43:07] a result of Jesus Christ coming into
[43:10] your life possessing Your Vessel and you
[43:14] saying he is Lord he is absolute there
[43:19] is nothing between me and the Lord this
[43:22] is a call where you become totally
[43:25] yielded and surrender to God Amen and
[43:28] when you do people know
[43:30] it it's a supernatural call it's a
[43:34] personal revelation to recognize what
[43:37] God is doing in your day too many people
[43:40] are putting things off into the future
[43:43] but we need to recognize the
[43:44] resurrection is now amen praise God
[43:48] hallelujah we want to explore the
[43:50] powerful message of res of Resurrection
[43:53] today and our role in in this Plan of
[43:58] Redemption and this Resurrection because
[44:01] I believe we're on a another walk on
[44:05] another road to another
[44:07] Resurrection Lord amen we want to
[44:10] explore the powerful message that's
[44:13] that's behind the word Resurrection our
[44:16] main idea centers around understanding
[44:19] our part that we have a part in this
[44:22] we're not just church members we're sons
[44:25] and Daughters of God we're anointed of
[44:28] the spirit of God to to to produce
[44:31] Miracles not to not for
[44:35] us to make Miracles but for the Lord to
[44:38] operate through US knowing that he can
[44:41] do all things through them that believe
[44:43] in Christ to them that are that are
[44:45] called according to his purpose and what
[44:48] his Spirit possesses and takes control
[44:51] everything is possible we are the key
[44:53] players in in the unfolding plan of
[44:56] God's grace amen praise God we're not
[44:59] just recipients of God's grace but we're
[45:03] conduits of God's grace when we go to
[45:05] work when we go to school when we when
[45:08] we fellowship with our families we're
[45:10] conduits of God's love and God's grace
[45:13] when we know it and and and we we we
[45:16] believe it and we and we know that you
[45:18] know sickness it only comes to give God
[45:21] glory and so when we're with friends or
[45:23] with family and and we see them
[45:26] we we become compassionate and knowing
[45:29] that God doesn't want them to stay that
[45:31] way God wants to heal them God wants to
[45:34] raise them out of their condition God
[45:36] wants to bless them amen and we're the
[45:39] conduits that God has chosen in this day
[45:42] to be to be those that that can be his
[45:45] his feet his hands his
[45:48] voice praise God we're not just
[45:52] bystanders we're key
[45:54] players praise God we're not just saved
[45:58] but we're
[45:59] sent glory to God Amen we are the church
[46:03] body who are on their way to another
[46:06] Resurrection amen hallelujah Jes do you
[46:10] believe that amen glory to God do you
[46:12] know that uh we're we're uh destined for
[46:14] the Rapture do you know that the message
[46:17] of this hour is that God is going to
[46:21] Rapture you out of this Dimension into
[46:24] another dimension amen you know if you
[46:26] look at the word rapture it means caught
[46:29] up in 1 Thessalonians 4 it says we will
[46:34] be caught up we which are alive and
[46:37] remain shall be caught up to meet the
[46:40] the Lord in the air we which are alive
[46:43] shall shall not hinder them that sleep
[46:46] the dead in Christ shall rise first
[46:48] praise God there's going to be a general
[46:50] resurrection and we're on that road
[46:53] right now we're walking to the
[46:55] resurrection amen praise God it's an
[46:58] exciting time and so we're going to look
[47:01] at um at uh St
[47:05] John chapter 11 and we're going to read
[47:08] from verses 1 to 24 you can go to the
[47:11] next
[47:16] slide
[47:18] amen so we're going to be looking at
[47:20] experiencing the resurrection all right
[47:23] so we know the scripture that we read
[47:26] and and what
[47:27] happens what the the ultimate outcome is
[47:31] Lazarus raises from the dead and Jesus
[47:35] says loose him but I want to look at
[47:39] what's
[47:40] happening while and
[47:43] before they reach that
[47:46] place and we're going to draw some
[47:48] things through this you know scripture
[47:51] that we're going to be reading and I
[47:53] want you to picture yourself and as
[47:56] we're identifying and we're reading
[47:58] through the scripture we've got two
[48:01] special individuals that we're going to
[48:03] be looking at here Martha and Mary and
[48:07] as we read that I want you to kind of
[48:10] identify I want you to kind of see where
[48:13] you compare where you uh you know you
[48:16] might type where you might be in your
[48:18] walk amen and where you are in this walk
[48:21] to the resurrection cuz they're headed
[48:23] to a resurrection they didn't know it
[48:27] they didn't realize who was actually
[48:29] with them they knew that he could heal
[48:31] the sick they knew that he could do all
[48:33] the things that that they they had seen
[48:35] him do in the they knew that he could
[48:37] even raise the dead he had already done
[48:40] it but yet you know sometimes you're in
[48:43] a situation in your life and you're
[48:45] walking with God for so many years and
[48:48] you've heard of all the things that God
[48:50] can do and you know what God can do but
[48:52] yet you find yourself in a situation and
[48:55] you might find yourself
[48:58] discouraged let's
[49:01] read St John chapter 11 from verse
[49:04] one now a certain man was sick named
[49:08] Lazarus of Bethany the town of Mary and
[49:12] her sister
[49:13] marra it was that Mary which anointed
[49:16] the Lord with ointment and wiped his
[49:18] feet with her hair whose brother
[49:21] Lazarus was sick therefore his sister
[49:25] sent unto him saying Lord behold he whom
[49:28] thou lovest is sick when Jesus heard
[49:33] that he said this sickness is not unto
[49:36] death but for the glory of God let me
[49:41] tell you I don't know what you're facing
[49:42] right now I don't know if there's a
[49:44] sickness in your life I don't know if
[49:46] there's a need in your life I don't know
[49:48] if there's a relationship that's kind of
[49:50] breaking apart and you know you've got
[49:52] certain situations that you're dealing
[49:54] with let let me say this it has come
[49:58] into your life for the glory of God if
[50:02] you
[50:04] believe hallelujah praise God and when
[50:07] Jesus heard that that's what he said he
[50:10] says that God might be glorified thereby
[50:13] now Jesus loved Mary and her sister and
[50:17] Lazarus when he had heard there for that
[50:19] he was sick he Abode two days still in
[50:22] the same place where he was then after
[50:25] after that he saith to his disciples let
[50:27] us go unto Judea again let me insert
[50:32] this we know that from what we just read
[50:35] here that Jesus had spent time near the
[50:38] Jordan River prior to the death of
[50:41] Lazarus he had received the news two
[50:44] days on the day that he received the
[50:46] news Lazarus had probably
[50:49] died they didn't they you know his
[50:52] disciples didn't know that but Jesus
[50:54] knew he knew exactly what was going on
[50:57] Lazarus was sick unto death Jesus stayed
[51:00] where he was for two more
[51:02] days oh boy let me tell you Jesus just
[51:06] doesn't answer me you know he just takes
[51:09] his time you know we wonder sometimes if
[51:12] Jesus really cares oh let me tell you he
[51:15] knows all about it he knows all about it
[51:18] seems apparent that Lazarus had died the
[51:21] same day that he received the news that
[51:23] he was sick
[51:26] and then after two days Jesus tells his
[51:28] disciples to prepare to return unto
[51:30] Judea and he affirms that Lazarus was
[51:35] dead he told he told the the the the
[51:38] we're going to read that while the
[51:41] situation was very desperate for Mary
[51:43] Martha and particularly Lazarus Jesus
[51:47] had purposely waited to
[51:49] return I tell you God I tell you the
[51:52] Lord Jesus knows exactly when he he
[51:55] needs to be in your
[51:57] situation he knows exactly what the
[52:00] right time is amen praise God hallelujah
[52:04] there are times in our lives when it
[52:05] seems we have passed a point of no
[52:08] return you might think oh this is not
[52:10] going to work out I mean imagine you
[52:13] find out that Lazarus is dead your
[52:15] brother's dead you knew that Jesus could
[52:17] heal him but yet he didn't come he took
[52:20] his time he had something else in mind
[52:24] amen we assume our situation will never
[52:27] improve and maybe even think that the
[52:29] Lord has chosen to do nothing I'm
[52:32] telling you I don't care if there's a
[52:34] situation in your life that started 15
[52:36] years ago and you keep going to the Lord
[52:39] you say Lord why has this not changed he
[52:43] knows the right time he knows when he
[52:46] needs to call you he knows when he needs
[52:49] to place you he knows when he needs to
[52:51] position you in the word of God because
[52:53] he has a purpose for every son and
[52:56] daughter of God
[52:59] hallelujah we will soon find out that
[53:02] that he's never too late Hallelujah even
[53:06] in a situation of extreme
[53:09] death he's still not too late your
[53:12] situation may be beyond the point of no
[53:15] return the doctors have given you the
[53:17] final notice Hallelujah but not with
[53:21] Jesus not if it's listen the lord giveth
[53:25] and the lord taketh blessed be the name
[53:28] of the Lord amen hallelujah Jesus was
[53:31] told that Lazarus was sick unto death
[53:34] and they wanted him to come immediately
[53:36] to pray for him they knew Jesus could do
[53:38] it yet Jesus took his time why he was
[53:42] going to show them that they would have
[53:45] an active role in what was going to
[53:48] happen they didn't know it yet but God
[53:51] had something in mind for them God had a
[53:54] place
[53:55] for them in this whole Redemptive plan
[53:59] amen everything is a type and a shadow
[54:01] we need to see all of this that's taking
[54:04] place because this is the last major
[54:06] event before Christ actually goes into
[54:10] Jerusalem to be
[54:11] crucified right it was after this
[54:14] miracle that the Pharisees and and all
[54:17] of those had realized that wait a minute
[54:19] here this is this is too much this is a
[54:22] little bit too much there's no way that
[54:24] uh this can carry on we're going to have
[54:26] to for the sacrifice of one man for for
[54:29] for all we're going to have to we're
[54:31] going to have to put this man to death
[54:34] but that was all part of his plan too
[54:37] amen and so his disciples say to him
[54:39] we're going to read on now verse eight
[54:41] master the Jews of late sought to Stone
[54:44] thee and goest thou tither again because
[54:48] Jesus said let's go back let's go back
[54:50] to
[54:51] Bethany and they knew that wait a minute
[54:54] you can't go back there there but Jesus
[54:56] answered are there not 12 hours in the
[54:59] day if any man walk in the day he
[55:02] stumbleth not because he seeth the light
[55:06] of this world but if a man walk in the
[55:08] night he stumbleth because there is no
[55:11] light in him if you're looking to hide
[55:15] and you're looking to to to you know not
[55:17] allow the spirit of God to do what it is
[55:20] that he's promised that he's going to do
[55:21] listen Jesus knew that nobody could
[55:24] touch him amen if he was in the service
[55:27] of God and he was under the anointing of
[55:29] the Holy Spirit God had showed him that
[55:32] he was going to raise Lazarus amen and
[55:35] there was nothing that was going to stop
[55:37] it because Jesus knew what the Lord had
[55:40] what the spirit his Spirit had showed
[55:42] him now we're not talking about two
[55:44] different gods here we're not talking
[55:45] God the Father and Jesus on Earth
[55:47] remember Jesus Christ was the word made
[55:51] flesh he was God in human flesh flesh he
[55:55] created himself a body but when he says
[55:58] I do nothing less the father shows me is
[56:01] because he is under subjection to his
[56:04] own plan it was the father's Plan of
[56:08] Redemption and Jesus would only do that
[56:11] which he had seen that the father had
[56:14] shown him because he was in a human
[56:15] vessel just like you and me it's a
[56:18] miracle that that that God is in you and
[56:20] and in me yeah amen we don't understand
[56:23] that but that's a supernatural element
[56:27] that that that that God is in
[56:29] you and that God can show you
[56:32] things God can use you speak through you
[56:35] give you a vision and reveal things in
[56:38] your life and in others lives and use
[56:42] you as an instrument well Jesus was
[56:45] displaying that in his own human body
[56:48] that he created for himself the word was
[56:52] made flesh and it dwelt among us and so
[56:57] there was nothing that Jesus Jesus is
[57:01] Walking In The Light according to the
[57:03] knowledge and the will of his
[57:06] father he listen his actions are only as
[57:10] dangerous as God intends them to be and
[57:14] your actions if you're called as a son
[57:17] or a daughter of God into this
[57:19] Revelation that you are a Christian a
[57:22] Christian is one whom Christ dwells in
[57:26] and you've surrendered and you've given
[57:28] your life and you've you've you've made
[57:30] him Lord in your life there is nothing
[57:34] that can harm you there is nothing that
[57:37] can stand between you and the purpose of
[57:39] God and what God has in store for your
[57:42] life you can walk with confidence that
[57:45] Jesus knows all about it and that he
[57:48] will make away in whatever situation
[57:50] you're dealing with am no devil in hell
[57:54] can stop stop God's plan in your life
[57:57] amen because you're ordained you're an
[58:00] attribute of God you're a Son of God
[58:02] you're a daughter of God you can't even
[58:07] sin Hallelujah you can't even sin
[58:10] because sin is when you disbelieve the
[58:13] word of God and even when you are
[58:16] trapped and you're caught in unbelief
[58:20] you're looking at that unbelief and you
[58:22] know you're trapped you know that that
[58:24] that it was a trap of the enemy because
[58:26] you don't believe that you believe God
[58:29] is greater than that you believe God can
[58:31] deliver you from that God has already
[58:34] delivered you from that you know that
[58:37] that that that in your mind in your
[58:39] heart you cannot deny the word of God if
[58:42] you are an attribute of God Amen true
[58:46] these things sayith he now verse 11 he
[58:48] saith and after that he saith unto them
[58:51] our friend Lazarus sleepeth but I go
[58:55] that I may awake him out of sleep then
[58:58] said his disciples Lord if he sleeps he
[59:01] shall do well they thought he was just
[59:03] saying that you know well he's
[59:05] resting and they were figuring oh the
[59:07] Lord knows all about it he's resting now
[59:10] this is great he's resting Lord we don't
[59:11] need to
[59:12] go how be it J Jesus spake of his
[59:17] death but they thought that he had
[59:19] spoken of taking of rest in sleep then
[59:24] said Jesus unto them plainly Lazarus is
[59:29] dead oh listen you you know sometimes
[59:33] you'll hear a statement and you'll hear
[59:35] oh this is this is done this is over but
[59:39] listen what he says he says and I am
[59:44] glad for your sakes that I was not
[59:50] there my goodness you wonder Jesus was
[59:54] not there Jesus wasn't there when that
[59:56] situation took place I got into that car
[59:59] accident my car was destroyed why didn't
[1:00:02] Jesus help me why wasn't he
[1:00:05] there because God is working something
[1:00:08] out in your life God is going to give
[1:00:10] you faith that when you look back onto
[1:00:13] those situations you will see that there
[1:00:15] was something happening there was a
[1:00:17] transformation taking place in your life
[1:00:20] amen he says I was glad I was not there
[1:00:22] to the intent that you made believe
[1:00:25] nevertheless let us go unto them unto
[1:00:28] him now listen you got these guys around
[1:00:32] you all the time too then said Thomas
[1:00:35] which is called dimus unto his fellow
[1:00:39] disciples let us also go that we may die
[1:00:42] with
[1:00:44] him he figured you know he figured oh
[1:00:47] boy if Jesus goes there they're going to
[1:00:49] Stone him they're going to kill him you
[1:00:51] know he didn't believe what Jesus
[1:00:53] actually said
[1:00:55] you know you'll tell people about the
[1:00:56] power of God that he can transform that
[1:00:59] he can deliver you that he can set you
[1:01:01] free and there's going to be those that
[1:01:03] are going to be around that are just not
[1:01:05] going to believe they're going to need
[1:01:06] to see to believe but blessed are you
[1:01:10] that believe and have not seen am
[1:01:13] because greater is going to be the
[1:01:15] victory when when it takes place in your
[1:01:17] life and greater will be the faith that
[1:01:19] you experience when you see God doing
[1:01:22] the impossible God doing doing great
[1:01:25] things amen Thomas he did not believe
[1:01:29] Jesus would raise Lazarus this not only
[1:01:32] puts down Thomas but emphasizes to you
[1:01:35] know to the readers that you know
[1:01:36] because John I want you to recognize
[1:01:38] something when you read the book of John
[1:01:40] you're going to see things and read
[1:01:42] things that that all the other you know
[1:01:45] APO disciples never recognized you know
[1:01:47] you read in Luke you read in Mark and
[1:01:50] and Matthew but John he had he had some
[1:01:53] special revelation God allowed him to
[1:01:55] see certain things amen and so he would
[1:01:58] bring them out in his writings he was
[1:02:00] the one that that that that Jesus showed
[1:02:03] you know at the Last Supper that it was
[1:02:04] Judas that it was him that was going to
[1:02:07] dip you know his bread he told it to
[1:02:09] John amen there was things that you'll
[1:02:12] see in the Book of John so when you're
[1:02:14] reading John this is something that you
[1:02:16] know that that I came to realize and and
[1:02:19] I I heard it and then I started to
[1:02:21] experience it and here it is you know
[1:02:23] and John will pick up on on things that
[1:02:25] you know that that other uh disciples
[1:02:28] did not pick up on Amen praise God he
[1:02:32] just he just thought you know that uh it
[1:02:34] would be an impossible thing Thomas you
[1:02:36] know he just didn't believe and you're
[1:02:39] going to have those that are around you
[1:02:40] that are going to not believe but that's
[1:02:43] where you're going to have to stand
[1:02:45] you're going to have to stand on the
[1:02:46] faith that God has placed within your
[1:02:48] heart then when Jesus came he found that
[1:02:52] he had laid in the grave 4 days days
[1:02:55] already now Bethany was nigh unto
[1:02:57] Jerusalem about 15 furlongs off and many
[1:03:01] of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to
[1:03:04] comfort them concerning their brother
[1:03:07] then Martha as soon as she heard that
[1:03:09] Jesus was coming went and met him but
[1:03:12] Mary sat still in the house H
[1:03:17] interesting
[1:03:18] observation you know if you look at
[1:03:21] Martha and Mary you will see that there
[1:03:23] are differ
[1:03:26] Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus
[1:03:28] was coming went and met him but Mary sat
[1:03:32] still in the house why would Mary stay
[1:03:35] home you know there's times you know she
[1:03:38] was the one that was constantly at
[1:03:39] jesus' feet she was the one that was
[1:03:42] feeding on his words just listening to
[1:03:44] him you know pouring ointment on his
[1:03:47] feet you know expensive ointment some
[1:03:50] some have said that that ointment could
[1:03:51] be worth3 or
[1:03:53] $35,000 in in today's you know cost of
[1:03:56] this special ointment that she was
[1:03:57] pouring on his feet she had come to
[1:04:00] realize that that this was the Messiah
[1:04:02] she couldn't she just wanted to Feast at
[1:04:04] his feet constantly Martha she was the
[1:04:08] servant she was the one that was
[1:04:09] constantly preparing the foods you know
[1:04:12] doing things to to uh you know to be
[1:04:14] hospitable because it was the tradition
[1:04:16] back then that when somebody of
[1:04:18] importance would come into the town you
[1:04:20] would invite them into your home you
[1:04:22] would wash his feet you would you know
[1:04:24] prepare Foods you would prepare like uh
[1:04:26] you know a gathering and you would do
[1:04:28] things and Martha she was a
[1:04:31] worker but Mary she was the one that was
[1:04:34] you know very very delicate and very
[1:04:37] just wanted to hear his words
[1:04:40] constantly but yet when Lazarus died she
[1:04:44] didn't want to go meet him you know
[1:04:46] things happen in our lives sometimes and
[1:04:48] you know situations don't go exactly the
[1:04:51] way we want it we get discouraged we
[1:04:53] don't want to go to
[1:04:56] church because when you go to meet Jesus
[1:04:59] that's going to
[1:05:01] church you know you go through a
[1:05:03] situation and all of a sudden you just
[1:05:05] you know like it just didn't work out
[1:05:07] the way you wanted it to work out and so
[1:05:09] you get you know very discouraged it
[1:05:12] doesn't change who you are it doesn't
[1:05:15] change the fact that you're still a
[1:05:17] Believer and that you've got faith great
[1:05:19] faith amen but you get so discouraged
[1:05:23] that you don't even want to go meet
[1:05:28] Jesus praise
[1:05:30] God hallelujah Mary was Martha was
[1:05:33] hurting and grieving of the loss of her
[1:05:37] brother but she went out to meet him
[1:05:40] what's unusual is that Mary didn't
[1:05:42] accompany her Mary is the one who was
[1:05:44] always found at his feet amen but in
[1:05:47] that moment of grief and pain she chose
[1:05:50] not to
[1:05:51] go how do you find yourself sometimes
[1:05:53] you find find yourself discouraged you
[1:05:56] find it that you know it's hard
[1:05:57] sometimes to to go and meet Jesus to go
[1:06:00] and spend some time with
[1:06:02] him praise God even the strongest
[1:06:05] Believers struggle at times when faced
[1:06:09] with devastating
[1:06:11] situations this does not imply that Mary
[1:06:14] had abandoned her
[1:06:17] faith but it does appear that she had
[1:06:20] kind
[1:06:23] of died to
[1:06:29] defeat her world was shattered and she
[1:06:31] was having difficulty coping with the
[1:06:34] reality of the
[1:06:36] situation there's situations that we
[1:06:38] will face there are realities in our
[1:06:41] lives that we must deal with but I want
[1:06:44] you to know that you can you can get
[1:06:47] back up because Jesus is calling for you
[1:06:50] amen Jesus knows all about your
[1:06:53] situation we all face these times where
[1:06:56] our faith is tested we all face these
[1:06:58] times when when we're tempted to resign
[1:07:01] to
[1:07:01] defeat I'm not going to church you'll
[1:07:04] look for every possible excuse not to
[1:07:08] assemble because you're in a state of
[1:07:11] defeat and you can't get back up Jesus
[1:07:15] is saying get back
[1:07:17] up
[1:07:19] Hallelujah the difference between Martha
[1:07:21] and Mary Martha was a worker she was
[1:07:24] constantly preparing food to host the
[1:07:26] visitors when Jesus would come by their
[1:07:28] home you know Jesus would go by their
[1:07:31] home regularly you heard it Jesus loved
[1:07:34] Martha Mary and Lazarus yes he knew all
[1:07:39] about them he knew all about their
[1:07:41] situation he knew all about their life
[1:07:43] he knew that Lazarus was going to get
[1:07:45] sick unto death he knew all about them
[1:07:49] God knows your situation God God didn't
[1:07:52] start uh you know your your your walk
[1:07:54] with him 15 20 even 30 years ago to
[1:07:57] leave you
[1:07:59] behind he started that work he's going
[1:08:02] to finish that work you can trust him
[1:08:05] you can know that he's going to finish
[1:08:06] the work that he started in your lives
[1:08:09] amen praise God you know Martha was was
[1:08:12] a worker and sometimes we get so caught
[1:08:15] up in working whether it's our jobs or
[1:08:18] whether we're working in the in the
[1:08:20] house of the Lord and we don't even we
[1:08:21] don't even come into the service because
[1:08:24] we're too busy doing things that are
[1:08:27] that are around the church you know like
[1:08:29] you know oh I got to prepare this and I
[1:08:30] got to do that and you know and you're
[1:08:32] missing the time like Mary where she
[1:08:34] just sat at his feet and just feeding on
[1:08:37] the word of God we've got to have that
[1:08:40] balance you know Martha was was was was
[1:08:43] a was a daughter of God but she was too
[1:08:46] caught up in the
[1:08:48] works Mary she was she was uh she wanted
[1:08:52] to be there she wanted to to hear the
[1:08:54] word she wanted to listen to what he had
[1:08:56] to say Amen she was a worshipper
[1:08:59] constantly At His Feet which sister do
[1:09:02] you compare
[1:09:04] to sometimes we got to you know because
[1:09:06] Martha she's like a type of the Old
[1:09:07] Testament Mary type of the new Martha
[1:09:10] the law Mary

[1:09:16] so upset one time she you go back and
[1:09:19] read it in Luke chapter 10 and she got
[1:09:22] upset she went to Jesus and she says
[1:09:24] Mary's not helping out here you know
[1:09:26] like here we are we're gathered we're
[1:09:28] you know we're having some nice
[1:09:29] fellowship and you know we're preparing
[1:09:31] the food but Mary you know she's too
[1:09:33] busy there hanging out at jesus' feet
[1:09:35] like you know she's right there come on
[1:09:37] Lord like you know listen to what Jesus
[1:09:40] said to her Jesus answered and said unto

[1:09:47] about many things you know sometimes we
[1:09:49] get too caught up and and and we get so
[1:09:53] caught up with the the things of our
[1:09:54] life and business and work and and
[1:09:57] family and this problem and that problem
[1:09:59] and oh we got to get this done at the

[1:10:08] service of the Lord but you need to
[1:10:10] balance your walk amen you need to have
[1:10:13] a balance with Christ you need to be
[1:10:16] willing to go and sit quietly at jesus'
[1:10:18] feet get into your closet spend some
[1:10:21] time you know you'll spend two three
[1:10:23] hours hours in front of the tube but you
[1:10:26] won't spend a half an hour with
[1:10:28] Jesus
[1:10:30] hallelujah praise God we're all guilty
[1:10:32] of it you know we're in a world where
[1:10:35] we're constantly bombarded with with all
[1:10:37] kinds of distractions and everything's
[1:10:39] constantly hitting us from the right and
[1:10:41] the left and and and we're being
[1:10:43] distracted by work and you know by you
[1:10:45] know that you know you look into the
[1:10:48] mailbox and you see that bill that you
[1:10:49] know is the the Visa
[1:10:52] bill you you know and you just see
[1:10:56] it throw it on your desk you know or you
[1:10:59] know that property tax bill and oh man

[1:11:16] you surrendered unto Jesus Jesus said I
[1:11:20] will be with you even in you until the
[1:11:23] end of the age I will never leave you I
[1:11:26] will never forsake
[1:11:29] you you can you can place your whole
[1:11:32] being on that amen praise God look what
[1:11:35] he says Martha Martha Thou Art careful
[1:11:37] and troubled about many things but one
[1:11:40] thing is
[1:11:42] needful and Mary hath chosen that good
[1:11:46] part which shall not be taken away from
[1:11:49] her let me tell you when you get into
[1:11:52] the presence of the Lord when you
[1:11:54] assemble yourself around the word of God
[1:11:56] and you come with expectation and God
[1:11:59] speaks to you personally I don't know I
[1:12:01] I know God's going to be speaking to
[1:12:03] some of you here today I know for a fact
[1:12:06] because this is this is how God this is
[1:12:08] the foolishness of preaching this is how
[1:12:10] the Holy Spirit Faith cometh by hearing
[1:12:12] and by hearing the word of God and I'm
[1:12:15] not bringing any deep things here today
[1:12:17] God didn't show me to bring any deep
[1:12:19] things here today amen he says keep it
[1:12:22] simple amen he says people need to roll
[1:12:24] some stones in their lives there's some
[1:12:27] stones of unbelief there's some things
[1:12:30] that that are hindering them from giving
[1:12:32] All to Jesus from from allowing Jesus to
[1:12:36] let them walk out of that grave out of
[1:12:39] that condition that they're in because
[1:12:41] you know the grave those there's a lot
[1:12:43] of graves out there amen praise God
[1:12:46] there's only one truth and that is the
[1:12:48] word of God there is no two 3,000
[1:12:52] different interp interpretations on
[1:12:54] God's word there's only one
[1:12:57] interpretation and the interpretation
[1:12:59] can only be given to you as an
[1:13:01] individual by the Holy
[1:13:04] Spirit that's the only way that you can
[1:13:07] say truth not because a man says it not
[1:13:11] because listen Paul says you follow me
[1:13:14] as I follow Christ he only spoke that
[1:13:17] which was in the word of God Amen we're
[1:13:20] only bringing to you those things that
[1:13:21] are in the word of God glory to God she
[1:13:24] chose the better things it's not that
[1:13:28] Martha was not a daughter of God but she
[1:13:31] was caught up in the works Hallelujah
[1:13:35] glory to God but Mary she was she was
[1:13:38] just floating in Grace she loved the
[1:13:41] grace of God you didn't deserve God's
[1:13:44] grace you didn't deserve him to come
[1:13:47] into your life deliver you from your
[1:13:49] unbelief deliver you from your
[1:13:50] addictions deliver you from from your
[1:13:53] your
[1:13:54] your own
[1:14:00] self we are Our Own Worst Enemy at most
[1:14:03] times and God delivers us from those
[1:14:07] stinking thinking thoughts that we
[1:14:09] constantly allow to nest in our
[1:14:12] minds we got to kick them out and
[1:14:14] replace them with the word of God
[1:14:18] replace those thoughts with God's word
[1:14:20] God's promises says I'm the Lord that
[1:14:22] Health Thee the the devil's going to
[1:14:23] tell you you got cancer the Lord says I
[1:14:26] am the Lord that Health thee which one
[1:14:28] are you going to
[1:14:30] believe do you know that he gives and he
[1:14:32] takes you can't leave this earth unless
[1:14:35] God allows it so where are you going to
[1:14:38] put your trust you might as well lay it
[1:14:40] right at the feet of Jesus just like
[1:14:42] Mary did Hallelujah you can get
[1:14:44] discouraged like Mary
[1:14:46] did but watch Mary was after the better
[1:14:50] things while Martha was doing the good
[1:14:52] things
[1:14:54] both are important and we need to find
[1:14:56] our
[1:14:57] balance Hallelujah please note Christ
[1:15:02] did not say Martha had chosen the wrong
[1:15:06] things he didn't say that he said he
[1:15:10] said and Mary had chosen he didn't say
[1:15:12] and Mary had chosen the right things no
[1:15:14] no he said we can make choices that are
[1:15:19] better the fact that you chose Jesus
[1:15:23] that's the foundation then you can start
[1:15:26] making choices in your life to
[1:15:28] experience better
[1:15:30] things constantly by making better
[1:15:33] choices making better
[1:15:36] decisions Hallelujah the things which
[1:15:38] Martha had been doing Hospitality were
[1:15:41] good things but it was a lesser thing
[1:15:44] than that at the moment of sitting at
[1:15:47] the feet of
[1:15:49] Jesus and so you know you you could
[1:15:52] choose to go down downstairs and you
[1:15:54] know well I got to prepare my Sunday
[1:15:56] school lessons and you know what I'm
[1:15:57] going to have to take time on Sunday
[1:15:59] because I won't have time during the
[1:16:00] week no no you need to be in the house
[1:16:02] in the sanctuary feeding on the word of
[1:16:05] Goden you need to allow Jesus to give
[1:16:08] you the strength to overcome and then
[1:16:10] the Lord will provide all of those
[1:16:12] things that you have need of amen glory
[1:16:15] to God when you are supposed to be you
[1:16:18] know uh feeding on the word you're doing
[1:16:20] other things but you need to be here
[1:16:22] don't make your Works more important
[1:16:24] than feeding on the word of God
[1:16:27] hallelujah simple things were being
[1:16:29] reminded now verse 21 then said Martha
[1:16:32] unto Jesus Lord if thou had been here my
[1:16:37] brother had not
[1:16:38] died now she wasn't she wasn't saying to
[1:16:41] Jesus that you know like mad that you
[1:16:45] know you should have been here no no she
[1:16:49] just she knew that if he had have been
[1:16:51] there he wouldn't have died
[1:16:54] it's not like she she didn't believe she
[1:16:56] still firmly believed amen but I know
[1:17:00] that even now by this statement look but
[1:17:03] I know that even now whatsoever thou
[1:17:05] Willl ask of God God will give it
[1:17:08] thee Jesus saith unto her thy brother
[1:17:10] shall rise again but Martha said unto
[1:17:14] him I know that he shall rise again in
[1:17:16] the resurrection at the last
[1:17:18] day listen we're talking about the
[1:17:21] resurrection now
[1:17:24] we need to come into the you know a lot
[1:17:26] of Christians you know they're heading
[1:17:28] into the Easter season and they've been
[1:17:31] doing lent and they've been you know
[1:17:33] sacrificing certain things you can't
[1:17:35] even find lent in the
[1:17:37] Bible you need to sacrifice every day by
[1:17:41] by serving God by praying reading his
[1:17:45] word they won't do that but they'll just
[1:17:48] decide that they're not going to go on
[1:17:50] their cell phone on Instagram for 40
[1:17:52] days but they'll still go on
[1:17:57] Facebook it's
[1:17:59] ridiculous there's no such
[1:18:02] thing there's only faith and when you've
[1:18:05] got faith in Jesus Christ you you you
[1:18:08] all those Works you've put aside all
[1:18:10] those Works Jesus said I am the Sabbath
[1:18:13] when he came he was the Sabbath if you
[1:18:15] receive Christ in your life there's no
[1:18:18] certain day of the week Yes We Gather on
[1:18:20] Sundays yes we we gather around the word
[1:18:23] of God because we are to assemble
[1:18:24] ourselves even more so as the day
[1:18:27] approaches but you can assemble on
[1:18:29] Wednesday we like we do you can assemble
[1:18:31] on Saturday I don't care what day you
[1:18:33] want to assemble but when you make that
[1:18:36] day a law to assemble and that somebody
[1:18:40] that assembles on a different day
[1:18:43] they're lost
[1:18:46] sorry you want to you know like brother
[1:18:48] brandham says you want to you want to
[1:18:51] write me you want to put me outside the
[1:18:52] Circle I'm just going to draw a bigger
[1:18:55] Circle and bring you right back
[1:18:57] in I'm going to say that that that if
[1:18:59] you want to put me out that's fine
[1:19:01] that's what you believe but I'm going to
[1:19:03] put you right back in because Jesus
[1:19:06] Christ is our Sabbath he is our rest
[1:19:11] once you've come into him you've rested
[1:19:13] from all things and so people are headed
[1:19:16] towards Easter and they're and they're
[1:19:19] not realizing and recognizing they will
[1:19:21] come to Easter Sunday
[1:19:23] and they will like literally on on Good
[1:19:25] Friday they will they will act so sad
[1:19:29] because you know Good Friday was the day
[1:19:32] that he was put to
[1:19:35] death and so they will get so
[1:19:37] emotionally attached to that and they
[1:19:39] will they will they will have to
[1:19:41] sacrifice in some way and they'll be so
[1:19:44] sad and they'll exess
[1:19:46] listen we should be the Glad
[1:19:50] people sure we know that that Good
[1:19:53] Friday what it
[1:19:55] represented but Easter Sunday was the
[1:19:58] Resurrection Day that Resurrection is
[1:20:00] not going to happen on March the
[1:20:04] 31st it already happened 2,000 years
[1:20:08] ago and he's resurrected in you and I
[1:20:12] today and everything that I'm reading
[1:20:14] here we're we're reading it as a context
[1:20:17] to see how we fit into the word of God
[1:20:20] and how this word pertains to our lives
[1:20:23] today in type form
[1:20:26] amen but Jesus Christ has not changed
[1:20:29] listen to what he says he says um but I
[1:20:33] know that even now she says that
[1:20:35] whatever you ask God will give it thee
[1:20:37] Jesus saith unto her thy brother shall
[1:20:38] rise again Martha said yes Lord in the
[1:20:41] resurrection at the last day Jesus said
[1:20:43] unto her I am the
[1:20:46] resurrection and I want you to note he
[1:20:48] didn't just say I am the resurrection he
[1:20:50] said I am the life amen when
[1:20:54] Resurrection took place he placed his
[1:20:56] life in you am that life is eternal he's
[1:21:00] the only one that can give you eternal
[1:21:03] life Hallelujah and the resurrection he
[1:21:06] said I am it's now it's present glory to
[1:21:10] God and he that believeth in me though
[1:21:13] he were dead yet shall he live and
[1:21:15] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[1:21:17] shall never die believest thou this sir
[1:21:21] Hallelujah she sayith unto him yeah Lord
[1:21:24] I believe that thou art the Christ the
[1:21:26] son of God which should come into the
[1:21:28] world she knew that he was the Messiah
[1:21:31] she knew that he was Jehovah of the Old
[1:21:33] Testament had been made flesh she knew
[1:21:36] that it was him she realized that it was
[1:21:38] the it was Jehovah himself that had come
[1:21:41] the word was made flesh was standing
[1:21:43] right before she knew that all things
[1:21:45] were possible amen hallelujah but yet
[1:21:49] she made the statement said but if you
[1:21:51] had been here Lazarus would not have
[1:21:54] died you see she was caught up into a
[1:21:57] future event like a lot of people they
[1:22:00] looking at the Rapture and they're
[1:22:02] placing it off into the future you know
[1:22:05] that the Rapture is already in progress
[1:22:08] you've already been changed you've
[1:22:10] already been snatched out of the world
[1:22:12] your family and your friends listen my
[1:22:14] family my friends I love them dearly and
[1:22:17] they love me dearly but a lot of them
[1:22:21] think you're different
[1:22:23] yeah you take this a little too far
[1:22:26] you're a little bit of an extreme you
[1:22:29] know in in in your in what you believe
[1:22:32] call it extreme call it whatever you
[1:22:34] want listen if you had have been here
[1:22:36] 2,000 years ago when Jesus was walking
[1:22:39] on the earth there was only a dozen
[1:22:41] people that were actually following him
[1:22:43] brother
[1:22:44] Gabe okay but your own family doesn't
[1:22:48] even believe what you believe your own
[1:22:49] friends don't even believe what you
[1:22:51] believe but that doesn't
[1:22:53] matter that's not up to me or you to
[1:22:57] make them
[1:22:58] believe the word of God is something
[1:23:01] that God reveals
[1:23:03] personal it's something personal I know
[1:23:06] when you first come to the Lord I did
[1:23:08] the same I made the same mistakes I got
[1:23:10] so zealous I wanted to drive everything
[1:23:12] down the people's throats you got to
[1:23:14] believe this you got to believe this
[1:23:15] word you got to believe this message and
[1:23:18] then I realized Jesus sitting back there
[1:23:20] and
[1:23:21] saying I open yeah and no man shuts I
[1:23:26] opened your understanding I haven't
[1:23:28] opened theirs
[1:23:32] yet yet that's the way I see
[1:23:35] it that's entirely up to him when he
[1:23:38] wants to unveil himself make himself
[1:23:40] real open that word to where they look
[1:23:43] into the word and they say wait a minute
[1:23:44] you mean I was baptized as I wasn't
[1:23:46] baptized I was baptized as a baby how
[1:23:49] could I understand how could I believe
[1:23:50] anything you see I fell under that
[1:23:53] tradition and when when when our eyes
[1:23:55] are open to see the word of God the
[1:23:56] first thing you want to do is you want
[1:23:58] to get to that tank not because it saves
[1:24:01] you it doesn't save you you could go in
[1:24:04] a a a dry Sinner and you're going to
[1:24:06] come out a wet sinner if you have not
[1:24:08] repented and have not received the
[1:24:10] spirit of God into your heart to open
[1:24:13] your understanding to say Amen to every
[1:24:15] word of God Amen let the let the word of
[1:24:19] God be truth and every man's word be a
[1:24:21] lie
[1:24:22] Hallelujah you're not going to be
[1:24:24] blinded by the traditions of man but
[1:24:27] first communion this that children's
[1:24:29] those are all traditions of
[1:24:32] man that's not the word of God and so if
[1:24:36] you know people you know you're too
[1:24:38] zealous for the word yeah but but if God
[1:24:40] is going to judge
[1:24:42] us listen don't tell me we're not in the
[1:24:45] last
[1:24:46] days don't tell me Israel is not in her
[1:24:49] Homeland and fighting a battle don't
[1:24:53] tell me that these wars that are taking
[1:24:55] place with with with Russia and Ukraine
[1:24:58] and and and and a divided country the US
[1:25:01] of America so bankrupt it has never been
[1:25:04] as bankrupt financially as it is today
[1:25:07] but yet because of man's ways and man's
[1:25:11] listen Satan is the God of all
[1:25:14] governments amen I'm just gonna tell it
[1:25:18] straight okay he's the one that went to
[1:25:21] Jesus in the 40 days of
[1:25:24] Temptation and said you see all these
[1:25:27] kingdoms they're all mine go read your
[1:25:31] scripture he says I'll give them to you
[1:25:33] if you bow down to
[1:25:35] me Imagine The Creation telling the
[1:25:38] Creator to bow down he said get behind
[1:25:41] me Satan you Jesus you you've got a part
[1:25:45] to play thank you Jes your part is being
[1:25:49] played out that's all God God has a plan
[1:25:53] where do you fit into the plan are you
[1:25:56] on your way to the
[1:25:57] resurrection have you already been
[1:26:00] resurrected Hallelujah glory to God and
[1:26:04] whosoever he says yay Lord I believe let
[1:26:07] so then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if
[1:26:10] thou been here my brother would not have
[1:26:12] died I don't think Martha intended any
[1:26:14] disrespect there she knew what he could
[1:26:17] do and you know what God can do but you
[1:26:20] have to you have to sub you you got to
[1:26:22] submit to God's time and God's season
[1:26:25] and God's will for your life hallelujah
[1:26:29] praise God I am certain we all have felt
[1:26:32] that way oh if Jesus had have been
[1:26:35] there but no
[1:26:38] doubt we come to
[1:26:41] realize and I don't want to be the bear
[1:26:43] of bad news but I'm going to tell you
[1:26:45] that these situations will continue in
[1:26:47] your life where you will find yourself
[1:26:50] Lord why Lord Lord why this Lord why
[1:26:54] that he's going to answer
[1:26:57] it Hallelujah we've all stood at the
[1:27:00] crossroads in life but like it says in
[1:27:03] Psalms 121 I will lift up mine eyes unto
[1:27:07] the hills from whence cometh my help and
[1:27:11] it's my Help Cometh From The Lord which
[1:27:14] made Heaven and Earth Hallelujah glory
[1:27:17] to God Jesus said thy brother shall rise
[1:27:20] again Hallelujah
[1:27:22] and there's nothing that would stop it
[1:27:25] death had invaded their home but it
[1:27:26] would not be something final you may
[1:27:30] have got a doctor's report but I'm
[1:27:32] telling you it's not final glory to God
[1:27:35] because if you're a son or a daughter of
[1:27:37] God death has no sting over you if the
[1:27:41] doctor gives a report and says in three
[1:27:43] months you're going to die and in three
[1:27:45] months you do you can you can know that
[1:27:48] you're you're just absent from the body
[1:27:50] present with the Lord amen you see death
[1:27:54] had no more sting over Paul he had a re
[1:27:58] he had a revelation that he was an
[1:28:00] eternal son or daughter of God and so he
[1:28:03] did not fear death he did not he did not
[1:28:06] you know listen as human beings we all
[1:28:08] fear that that that word you know we all
[1:28:12] hate to see it when it happens but
[1:28:15] recognize that there is a time for all
[1:28:19] things scripture says there's a time to
[1:28:21] be born and there's a Time to die I love
[1:28:24] my family my my my my loved ones my my
[1:28:26] parents my dad's 94 years old couple of
[1:28:30] weeks ago I had to rush to the hospital

[1:28:34] bad situation and I just went there and
[1:28:36] I laid hands on him and I said dad I'm
[1:28:39] going to pray for you right now he says
[1:28:40] okay and I prayed over him and I said

[1:28:47] pronounced him made whole in the name of
[1:28:49] Jesus Christ but yet I said said your
[1:28:52] will be
[1:28:54] done not my will your will be done and
[1:28:59] God's will was that he was going to

[1:29:48] Dominic what is it it's the grace of God
[1:29:53] hallelujah God has a time and a season
[1:29:56] for all things and when you live in a
[1:29:59] way that you're free that you're
[1:30:01] satisfied to know that you're in the

[1:30:17] you just got to wait for God's time
[1:30:19] because when it's in his time it's
[1:30:20] beautiful it works out marvelously amen
[1:30:24] hallelujah death had invaded their home
[1:30:27] but it was not something that was Final
[1:30:29] Jesus said unto her I am the
[1:30:32] resurrection and the life amen praise
[1:30:34] God Hallelujah the resurrection now she
[1:30:38] didn't realize that he was talking about
[1:30:40] right now we're going to go raise
[1:30:41] Lazarus right now where have you laid
[1:30:44] him praise God put up that quote there
[1:30:46] slide number
[1:30:48] five now even to this day
[1:30:52] Slide Five now even to this day that
[1:30:55] same holy spirit that has lifted us up
[1:30:58] from a life of sin where we once lived
[1:31:02] and we've and we've already we're dead
[1:31:04] in Christ buried and raised with him in
[1:31:09] his resurrection now and setting right
[1:31:12] now in Heavenly places with him amen
[1:31:16] watching him work Among Us why why I why
[1:31:21] a i out yonder among the
[1:31:24] denominations because it's those that
[1:31:27] are dead and buried in him and have
[1:31:30] raised with him in his resurrection and
[1:31:34] now not we will
[1:31:38] be you see all a lot of churches they
[1:31:41] they talk about the resurrection and
[1:31:43] they're going to put it off into a
[1:31:45] future event and not and not just claim
[1:31:49] all the benefits of being a son or a
[1:31:51] daughter of God right now sure we have
[1:31:53] problems sure we have the same s
[1:31:56] situations sure we get sick from time to
[1:32:00] time
[1:32:02] but God is
[1:32:04] our backbone God is our
[1:32:08] absolute God is now God can resurrect
[1:32:11] the situation now I believe he can
[1:32:14] change it right now he says not will be
[1:32:17] but we are now in Heavenly places in
[1:32:19] Christ Jesus looking back to where we
[1:32:22] once come from a direct evidence that we
[1:32:26] received part of it because we are dead
[1:32:29] and our life is hid in God through
[1:32:33] Christ and already raised again in the
[1:32:36] resurrection with him amen oh my we're
[1:32:41] already resurrected we're already
[1:32:44] changed we're already snatched out of
[1:32:47] the world we're already in the Rapture
[1:32:50] it's already in progress
[1:32:52] and you know the final moment of the
[1:32:54] Rapture read it it's in the moment in
[1:32:56] the twinkling of an eye a lot of people
[1:32:59] think they can just go on live any way
[1:33:01] they want I'm a Christian I went to
[1:33:04] church when I was young that's good
[1:33:07] enough well what are you going to say
[1:33:10] you can't say nothing you got to let the
[1:33:12] Holy Spirit have his way praise God you
[1:33:15] got to know where you stand in the word
[1:33:17] of God you got to know where you are you
[1:33:19] got to make sure your calling your ction
[1:33:22] amen praise God hallelujah and when she
[1:33:25] had so said verse 28 now go to verse 28
[1:33:29] and when she had so said she went her
[1:33:32] way and called Mary her sister secretly
[1:33:35] saying the master has come now she had
[1:33:38] caught something and the enthusiasm that
[1:33:41] was in Martha was now conveyed unto Mary
[1:33:45] you know you need to be like Martha
[1:33:47] sometimes you need to convey that hey
[1:33:50] the Master's here hey Jesus can help you
[1:33:53] Jesus can change your situation he can
[1:33:56] he can transform that situation in your
[1:33:59] life wow I still got another hour and a
[1:34:01] half it's only
[1:34:03] 11:30 he can change those circumstances
[1:34:06] in your
[1:34:08] life praise God he's he's now the Lord
[1:34:11] needs more Martha calling testifying
[1:34:14] that Jesus is calling for you amen when
[1:34:18] Mary heard that she immediately went
[1:34:20] running right away
[1:34:22] oh something some excitement was taking
[1:34:24] place something was going to happen amen
[1:34:26] the Lord wants us to take an active role
[1:34:29] in that way praise God Hallelujah in
[1:34:33] sharing the message of this
[1:34:35] hour this word that God has sent a
[1:34:38] prophet of in and fulfilled Malachi 4:5
[1:34:42] and Revelations
[1:34:43] 107 a man by the name of William Branham
[1:34:47] just like people talk about Billy Graham
[1:34:50] just like people talk about about you
[1:34:52] know great ministers Oral Roberts and
[1:34:54] and you know John Wesley and Martin
[1:34:56] Luther you know William brandham he was
[1:34:59] a reformer but he was one that was
[1:35:02] anointed with the ministry and a
[1:35:04] prophetic Ministry to restore the word
[1:35:06] of God back to the original Faith amen
[1:35:09] and so you need to go back and search
[1:35:11] the scriptures because the Reformation
[1:35:14] is still in
[1:35:15] progression and you need to realize what
[1:35:18] the word is doing in your day we don't
[1:35:21] we don't worship William brandham we
[1:35:23] don't follow a man we follow the word if
[1:35:27] there's anything that he said that was
[1:35:28] not in the word we would not believe it
[1:35:32] but everything he said you got to you
[1:35:34] got to for yourself you need your own
[1:35:36] Revelation you need to you need to read
[1:35:38] for yourself you need to search and
[1:35:40] listen to the messages you need to go
[1:35:42] back and listen to William bram's
[1:35:44] message on the rising of the sun you
[1:35:46] need to go back and listen to Christ the
[1:35:48] mystery of God revealed you need to
[1:35:50] listen to those things because just like
[1:35:53] Martin Luther had a revelation to break
[1:35:55] away from the Catholic church because he
[1:35:58] had caught his own Revelation that the
[1:35:59] just shall live by faith Wesley caught a
[1:36:03] revelation that you need to be
[1:36:04] Sanctified Pentecost caught a revelation
[1:36:07] of gifts William bram's Revelation was I
[1:36:10] want to introduce you to Jesus Christ
[1:36:13] the original word because you've taken
[1:36:15] all of your traditions and you've made
[1:36:17] the word of God of none
[1:36:20] effect
[1:36:23] he came to deal with the
[1:36:25] churches glory to God
[1:36:28] hallelujah so Mary Rose
