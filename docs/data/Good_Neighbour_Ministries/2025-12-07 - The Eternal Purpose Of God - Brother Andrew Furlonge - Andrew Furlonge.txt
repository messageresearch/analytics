TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] God bless. bless you. Welcome to the house of the living God. As I always say, let's give God an applause. [Applause] It's just a short psalm that I'm going to read. Um, so maybe when I read one, you read the next verse, eight verses. I will lift up mine eyes onto the hills. From hence cometh my help. It's not there. My help cometh from the Lord which made heaven and earth. Psalm 121. He will not suffer thy foot to be moved. He that keepeth thee will not slumber. Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord is thy keeper. The Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil. He shall preserve thy soul. Let's read the last verse together. The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth. and even forever more. Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. God bless you, brother. [Music] to know weaknesses I see in me. They will be stripped away by the power of your love. Holy Ghost, let your love surround me. [Music] Bring me near and draw me to your side. As I wait, I'll rise up like an eagle and I will soar with you. Your spirit leads me on. Why don't we all stand this morning? Sing the second verse. Lord, unveil my eyes. Amen. And Lord, unveil my eyes. Let me see you face to face. The knowledge of your love as you live in me. Lord, renew my mind as your will unfolds in my life and living every day by the power of your love. Everybody say, "Holy Ghost, oh holy ghost, let your love surround me. Bring me near and draw me to your side. [Music] As I wait, I'll rise up like an eagle and I will soar with you. Your spirit leads me on. All the eagles will sing, "Oh, I will soar with you. Your spirit leads me on by the power of your love. [Music] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Somebody praise the Lord. You want to soar this morning? Any eagles want to soar this morning? &gt;&gt; Then soar. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord, oh my soul. Oh my soul. and worship his holy name and sing like never before. Oh my soul, I worship your holy name. Well, the sun comes up. It's a new day dawn in. It's time to sing your song again. Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me, let me be singing when the evening. Come on everybody. Oh, bless the Lord, oh my soul. Oh my soul. Give me some drums, brother. Worship his holy name. Sing like never before. Oh my soulless. [Music] They're singing on that day. On that day when my strength is failing, the end draws near and my time has come. Still my soul will sing your praise unending. 10,000 years and then forever more. Oh, bless the Lord. Bless his name. [Music] &gt;&gt; And worship his holy name. Oh my soul. &gt;&gt; I'll worship your holy name. name. I worship your holy name. Hallelujah. Praise God. &gt;&gt; We're here to worship him.

What can we say, Lord, but to give you praise, thanks, and gratitude, Father, even though the enemy keeps trying to beat us down, Lord God, but we've come here this morning to worship you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We lift our hands in praise, in honor and glory to the mighty name of Jesus, the name above all names.

Oh God, may your hand reach to her even this morning, Lord, as we extend our faith for our sister and we rebuke that demon that has attacked her body, Lord God.

We're going into the inner veil this morning. You believe that? If you've come with expectation, you can go behind the veil and you can feast all that you want. Amen. David went into the temple of God. It wasn't even permitted at that time. But God's grace, &gt;&gt; God knew exactly what we would have need of. Amen. Praise God. And so this morning, I'm very grateful to have our sister Serita.

Father, our expectation is is total healing in our bodies, in our hearts, in our minds, Lord, that you would, Father, that you would go deep into the inner parts of our lives. And Lord, just uh bring out whatever needs to be, Lord, uh set free, Father, break chains, open the windows of heaven and pour out your blessings this morning, Lord, as we gather into heavenly places. Father, we ask your blessing upon our dear brother. remember his his ministry this morning. The saints back home, Lord, his family, his children. Lord, may you remember each and every one, Father. Those that are at home here, Father, that are sick and afflicted, Lord. May you encamp them about with your angels, oh God. And may you just brush through the home, Father.

Loving Father, we are so thankful that you made it so simple for us that all we are called upon to do is to believe. Lord, let that be the confession of our hearts. Lord, I believe. Lord, we believe because you are here and you promise wherever two or three are gathered in your name that you're in the midst to bless bless hearts this morning. even the ministering of your word and all things will get the praise, the honor and the glory in Jesus precious name I pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated for just a moment. Amen. Regardless of how many times you minister with me, every time you come, you have a little element of nervousness. So you you pray for me, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. I kind of feel at home. I've been here a few times and um by God's grace, the Lord have allowed us to be here today. You know, it we came specifically because it's was brother Christopher's uh birthday and um his 70th birthday. So they had spent a couple of months, him and sister with us. So we didn't think that there was a need but it just came came to my mind one night I should go for his 70th birthday because he wouldn't have another 70th birthday. You know many of times we want to do things but we just wait right. I talk English by the way just my dialect is a little strange but I see some Trinidadian and they understand me right and by know I had a friend come Canada a few years ago and he left with a guy accent you know so by God's grace we just you know one of the good things is we have one common message &gt;&gt; and regardless of where you go the message is the same the language is the same is that so you go somewhere and you say only believe wait you're a believer right or don't there are certain things that we say we have our own vocabulary in the message so that makes us one and wherever part of the world and one day there going to be a rapture and we'll all understand each other's language &gt;&gt; amen you won't have to worry and I think accent and dialect them things shall be done away with. &gt;&gt; We thank God for that. You know, I was so appreciative to be here and um the Lord has it that my brother is not with us this morning, but I wanted to appreciate brother John Simon and the standard that he set in transition in a church and I I trust that many people other churches will emulate the pattern or the example that he has laid out. We have lots of churches, a couple of churches, significant churches that have fallen away, divided and become, you know, fragmented because of poor transition. And it really take someone like brother John to have done what he have done. So I really want to appreciate him this morning and commend him from the for the way it has been done in the good neighbors ministry. And I trust that the same love and support that you extended to brother John will be extended to brother Danny. And that is easy. It's easy to love brother Danny. If you ask I love brother Danny something wrong with you. Yes. I don't know you know many of times. Let me talk normal. Help me to relax a little bit. There was um many a times I was telling a church recently when we have problems there's always look for somebody to blame but that don't happen in Canada. There's always somebody else to blame you know you never wrong. Oh okay all right you good you're lucky are good people here bro. We always look for somebody else to blame and you never look and see that you the problem. &gt;&gt; Somebody tell me that we church have no love. Well, that's a good thing if the church had no love. You be the one who have love because it had no competition because you leading the group. That's all. If nobody love then you be the one to demonstrate love. You will stand out. But anyway, but we always have, you know, those little things. I was thinking um there's nothing new that I can bring for you because we have had one message that came through a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I don't know how preachers this feel is big preachers and they had new revelation. They can't preach without the prophet message. &gt;&gt; There's no revelation that came outside the prophet message. I don't know how you people feel they take it and they get higher revelation and more scientific and the better listen they can't preach because none of them went beyond the curtain that time none of them understood what the prophet said none of them can say I stood over the banister of times and I saw all things from the beginning to the end when Moses wrote he said in the beginning God created when John wrote he said in the beginning was the word and The word was with God. But when our prophet came, he said, "I take you before time began. &gt;&gt; When there was nothing, he God took him there &gt;&gt; and show him the beginning to the end." &gt;&gt; And all that has been hidden up in the mystery of God was made known to us &gt;&gt; through a prophet that God designed and determined &gt;&gt; and have allowed us to enjoy the ministry. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if I'm saying anything is what he would have already said. &gt;&gt; So this morning is just revision and that's easy. When you have to revise something all you don't know. Let me talk Trinidad. All you don't know the thing. What you want me to tell all you don't know it. I mean so much service. So I was thinking about expectations brother Danny. what you expected when you come to church and so many times he said this morning what were your expectations I mean since I've been started serving the Lord I mean I grew up in church my father was a pastor so I was forced to go to church not because I wanted to but he carried to church I had to go Sunday's church but I used to go in the back of the church and sit down and hope he finish pass and his name was for long. So he could have preached long. So I used to go in the back of the church tolerate it until it done. But there came a point in time that God say enough is enough. &gt;&gt; And when God call you, brother, you could run but you can't hide. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You could do what you want. But God say I want you. I choose you. I've elected you. Amen. &gt;&gt; You either come easy or hard. &gt;&gt; So you choose how you want to come. &gt;&gt; You feel you could give God problem. &gt;&gt; Which of you could give God any kind of problem? Oh wait. You feel there's your own man or your own woman. All right. I'll show you. I'll talk to you how God does things. He will allow you the limit, but he cannot lose you. &gt;&gt; No, sir. When God choose you, he can't lose you. &gt;&gt; And he will make sure you're not lost. &gt;&gt; So for the predestined, I say thank God that free will is not an option for when you are predestinated. &gt;&gt; You didn't hear me. When you are predestinated, you don't have a free will &gt;&gt; because he choose you. He elected you. All right. My message this morning is on the P. So I was thinking of what what was our expectation. So you get come so many times to church and you would have failed. You get our next ser and you get excited and you get blessed. But did you really get what you wanted out of the service? And you got to come with expectation that God is going to speak to me. and let God direct his thoughts to me, to you &gt;&gt; so that you can leave with a blessing. &gt;&gt; I remember the story, the incident tells about the little girl who was blind in Memphis, right? And she came and she got lost in the crowd and her daddy was missing, right? And she Barra saw her. God brought the prophet out. The prayer line for that day was that campaign was eight days ago and Bram just prayed and slept at everything right by the pulpit. But they had called him out to go and pray for a woman who they thought had died in an ambulance. All right. So he stepped outside and he prayed for her. Abraham said she was not dead but he because he didn't sense that she was dead. He prayed and then you know the she the husband realized that she was back and such like right and then he stepped out of the van and it was this time of separation where the whites the Jim Crow law. So here he saw the hearing this little cry girl calling for daddy daddy right and he looked and nobody was there to help her. So he put himself in a way that she would come and and walk into him. And when as she walked into him, she says, "Sorry, sir." You know, you read it in the prophet's message. And um I I picked it up from that message because refers to that case in the message of expectancy. Now, she came and I just want to shorten it up because it's not my message this morning. She came to the service because she heard of a colored a man who was healed. And she say if I get to that service and I meet that man I am going to be healed. &gt;&gt; And brother say well Gil what you come for? You realize that she blind and and such like and he said in these modern times and I said 1950s right? Think of how far more up the road we are today. He say in these times you you believe that a man or angel come and visit a man. She say yes sir I believe that. And then he asked, "Well, what about your heel?" He said, "Listen." And I shut it up now. You could go read it. I enjoyed reading it all the time. It's like one of my favorite stories. She say, "Stop, stop the talk." Using my own language. She say, "You take me to the man, the healer, and then I will find my daddy after that." &gt;&gt; No, you talk about expectation. She says, "Sir, stop the talk, man. You just take me to the man and I will find my daddy for myself. &gt;&gt; Now we are a preacher taught recently on Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever. &gt;&gt; That same Jesus was the 2,000 years ago is the same Jesus that was with brother Abraham is the same Jesus here in 2025. And you got to believe that if he can do something great then he can do it again. &gt;&gt; And that is my expectation that one day something great is going to happen. &gt;&gt; And every service I come to if it didn't happen it will happen. &gt;&gt; Abraham held on for 25 years. And we've got to hold on believing &gt;&gt; that there's going to be a rapture &gt;&gt; and every one of your needs will be metal. &gt;&gt; That you are serving a God who can supply your need, meet your need, &gt;&gt; minister to your situation. &gt;&gt; Don't limit God. &gt;&gt; Abraham said that was too much for me when she said that. And he prayed a prayer that he prayed and he and it very simple. He said, "Lord, when you were going to the road on the road of to Golgata on the way to Calvary, you stumbled and fell and Simon ofSirene helped you carry the cross." &gt;&gt; And he said, "Here stands one of his daughters." &gt;&gt; He connect that child to Simon ofSirene 2,000 years ago. My why can't we have the same faith if the prophet can connect after 2,000 years connect that child by virtue of her ethnicity. &gt;&gt; Isn't that what he did? &gt;&gt; And and she got her healing. He said, "Lord, you understand." &gt;&gt; You know why? She came with expectation. &gt;&gt; Her expectation was so high that people were waiting to get healed. Amen. &gt;&gt; There was crowded. You couldn't pass. The prophet couldn't get back into the building. &gt;&gt; But God in his expectation was so high. He take the prophet out from behind the pullpit, bring him outside of the car park. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; So what you think, brother? It's her faith. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And our faith have to bring God and turn it. He turned the pe preacher around. He turned the pastor up to minister to your need &gt;&gt; so you can leave with a blessing sir. &gt;&gt; We've got to believe that he's the same yesterday. &gt;&gt; He did it for Bimius. He did it for the woman at the well, &gt;&gt; he can do it again. Anything that we have need of believe that God is more than able &gt;&gt; and I we are reaching we God our faith have to rise up to a point &gt;&gt; where we can believe in the impossible. &gt;&gt; What is impossible with God is not impossible with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May God help us. So I certainly appreciate brother Danny and the the church and its administration. Let's work together for one common object objective for the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Listen, we are this is not our ministry enough. This is God's work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I stand before you. I didn't pay the price for your redemption. &gt;&gt; Nobody can pay the price. You can't even pay for your own self. [Music] &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So, we are not your owners. We are stewards. We are servants. We are here to serve God's purpose. Amen. And you are God's purpose. Let me make it personal. You personally, you are God's purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he was walking the road to Calvary, he had you in his mind. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And we are just here by God's grace to fulfill his purpose. &gt;&gt; My subject this morning is the eternal purpose of God. And if the Lord can help me this morning, I trust that our hearts will be blessed. If we can turn our Bibles and may we stand to the book of Ephesians, chapter 1, and we'll read three verses of scripture. Let's call for prayer. Loving father, I pray that you will help us Lord. And Lord, as we go into your word, we pray Lord that you will take charge and grant in the midst of everything Lord, we can commit ourselves to you. We thank you, oh God, for the grace that has brought us into your house this morning. And we pray that your presence will be felt so that, oh God, hearts will be blessed and we be edified. and more we leave more determined Lord to serve you and to do your will. Grant it we pray. Bless our precious pastor, brother Danny, and the officers of the church, Lord, the labor of love, Lord, as they continue the legacy of the brother John Simon, Lord, and that over the years that you would have worked and Lord, with one goal in mind is to get souls saved, Lord, we pray, oh God, that you just bless, oh God, and get all the glory and the praise in Jesus precious name I pray and ask it with thanksgiving. Amen. And amen. We want to read three verses out of the book of Ephesians chapter 1. Uh you can follow as I read. Having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself. that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are in earth, even in him, in whom we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his own will. May God bless the reading of his word. You may be seated. Amen. We want to look at the eternal purpose of God uh and to state to you that God preserves his purpose. Amen. There's a caveat that I need to put in for you as it relates to God's purpose. And may I say this morning that you could I I'll just read it out. You don't need to show all the slides. I'll identify the slides that I want. Back home, they have a tendency to read the slides and don't listen to me, right? There's not I don't want you to read it. You could always have access to the slides afterwards. But just to share with you that God's purpose is greater than your comfort. That's a strong term. God's purpose is greater than your comfort. And it may seems that God is care. He doesn't care less or he's careless. But God is not mindful of your comfort. He's mindful of his purpose. So his purpose is greater than your comfort. We're going to look a little bit at the life of Joseph and see how God had a purpose. Joseph was part of that eternal purpose. And God did some things to Joseph that would seem very harsh. All right, perhaps we can rest as I talk to you. Joseph was plucked out from his family. He had 10 brothers who didn't like him, right? And they sold him, took him, and they were going to kill him. And one brother said, "Don't kill him. Let me sell him." And they sold him into slavery. And it might seem that it is harsh, but even getting out from under his father's home and protection and everything else, the comfort of his home was God's purpose. &gt;&gt; Because God had a greater purpose than him just staying where he was, as you would see later down the road. So your God's purpose even supersedes your ambition or dreams. If you had gone according to your own plans and wishes, I wouldn't be in Canada today because my brother Christopher would have been living in Trinidad. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You would have been somewhere else, but your ambitions, your desires may have been something else. And I want you to apply it to yourself and to see that when God is working for your life, he uproots you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. He may even cause what might appear as suffering or trials or testings. And you're wondering why God is allowing it. But God has a purpose. Before I the day before I traveled, I got in a a vehicular accident. I just a fender bender. A little thing. I was driving out. The road was abs had my mind absolutely clear. I was driving at I say like a hearse, you know, in Trinab we call it damn funeral and you're driving slow. That's how I turn out on the road onto a main road. I just taking my time and I don't know where this car came out of nowhere and hit the front of the van and I was so upset. But I was wrong, right? I came out and the woman said, "But you couldn't wait." But she would have had enough time to see me. Why she couldn't wait? But that's typical Trinidadian woman. I don't hope all you don't behave. So if you could drive in Trinidad, you could drive any part of the world or you come and see if I not fall. Anyway, and I was like and then we started talking. She wanted to exchange information and such like and and she said, "Well, what do you do?" I say, "I'm a pastor." And she stopped. She said, "Just yesterday, I was telling my mother, I don't want to go back to church. I don't even want to pray and I don't even believe there's a God and all of that. She said, "God wanted us to meet." I said, "Yes, ma'am, but not by accident." And I said, and I I just want to tell her, it just come out my mouth. Not by accident. And we get to talking and I said, "Listen, you need to go back to church." And she said, "You know, really," and then she started talking where she come from and a whole set of things. She didn't forget the accident, but she started talking on what her needs and what she had been telling her mother just the day before. I said, "Find yourself back." Well, that is I said, "Get back to church and get into a relationship with God." So, so I'm telling I was upset so much and I'm telling my daughter, my young daughter about it. She said, "Daddy, ain't you to say all things has worked together for good? Why you getting on like that? She say if you don't pass the test now you'll get it again. So my own daughter preaching and you feel that God give you a test and he give you the right to behave anyway. God will give you another test until you pass it. &gt;&gt; So many of times you are tested to see your reaction. All you know the test of shut your mouth. All you never hear the test called shut your mouth. Oh bro, &gt;&gt; you give me liberty to talk here tonight. Yeah. &gt;&gt; There are many times God just want to see you stay quiet. Okay, let me talk proper Canadian. Stay silent. &gt;&gt; But you know what? You must talk. You must say something. Come on. &gt;&gt; You must express your feeling. You know people. She said that my neighbor said that is you you know but not me you know. I had to tell them my mind. We had to most people know give them peace away mine. At the rate they give mind they will give away all their mind. If every time you give them peace your mind and one day you will have no mind. But it's a good thing. We should lose our mind so that we may have the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; They abused him. They did everything. And he opened not his mouth. &gt;&gt; But we must talk. And when we don't talk, I think you have to start texting and messaging everybody and telling them how you feel and what is your opinion. Only Trinidad does happen. Form your own church, your own clique, your own thing inside the church to cause problem. No, it's all right. I'm good. Why? There are directions that are laid down to us by the prophet, the word of God in our situations. But you know, we have to have our way. But God allows situations and tests to come your way so that we may grow, become mature and be able to listen. I was going to preach a mature on mastering all circumstances and brother Christopher say I think you preach that here but it would have be a good reminder. We have got to come to a point that every circumstance you've got to master it. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? You you bring situations under your control. &gt;&gt; You have to be the master of the circumstance. &gt;&gt; You can't be flying off the handle and behaving immature and fighting and that kind of thing. You got to come to a realization. Listen, I'm a son of God. &gt;&gt; And you cannot we I don't know. I feel at home now. So talking less. We &gt;&gt; you cannot be flustered by everything. Listen, brother Arab has brother Abraham give us an example of a slave and he repeated it many times right here was a slave a boy that came from Africa living in America and in the had the auctions for slave and he was the slaves were up for sale and the buyer when he came to the plantation he watched this particular boy and he say I want to buy him and the owner say he's not for But he said, "But there's something different about him. What is it? Do you feed him different? Do you dress him? Does he sleep different from the others?" He said, "No, he's just like all the others." But he tells you something. He said, "And I've wondered to about him, how he conducts himself differently." He said, "And I found out that in the land from where he come from, he's the son of a king. And though he be in America and functioning as a slave, he conducts himself like a son of a king. &gt;&gt; And regardless of where we are, we've got to conduct ourselves as we are sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; You walk like a son, you talk like a son, behave like a son. &gt;&gt; Don't let a slave override us. We can learn from his experience. We can learn from his behavior. And these things are not documented there for us just to for show peace. That has to become alive again in Canada. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In your home, in your life, in your job, wherever you go, you are different &gt;&gt; because you are the son of a king. &gt;&gt; The slavery condition and whatever may be happening in a job should not put you down. should not depress you. It should not oppress you. And you walk like that like you. &gt;&gt; No, you got to walk with your head up high &gt;&gt; because you master the circumstance. &gt;&gt; He was mastering slavery &gt;&gt; and you've got to master every circumstance that come your way. And don't don't get an a test like mine and my daughter tell you or your daughter tell you you will get it again because God wants you to be qualified to be qualified for a rapture. You got to have the mind of Christ. What would Jesus do? You understand? May God help us this morning. So God allow things to come our way to help us for our development. It overrides God's purpose overrides your desires. God's purpose control your life. Brother Abraham was born for a purpose. Amen. And brother Arab's purpose was to be a prophet. Satan couldn't Let me say another. Satan cannot defeat God's purpose. God's purpose can never be defeated. If God has a purpose in your life, you are going to rise up. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what come against you. What the devil throw at you, you are going to rise up. You are going to overcome. &gt;&gt; I God's purpose is not dependent. You will see God's pro. Didn't the Bible say all things work together for good? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. not some things, you know, all things work together for good. Everything is under his control. So when God had you in his mind, he predestinated you because his purpose for us is that you would be the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ. That's the ultimate purpose. You are going to come in a position where you are like the Bible types like Ruth and Esther and Sarah, all of them. You're going to rise up. You're going to conduct yourself and because you are that's what you are called for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now to help us to understand here was brother Abraham in 1965 and he says Lord surely in your word there is a scripture or a character that will say what my role is. And then in 1965, Abraham realizes that he's he opens his Bible to Revelation 24 where Abraham send his servant Eisa to hunt that bride. Right? &gt;&gt; Am I right? &gt;&gt; And then he realizes, listen, my role, all that I've been through my life is to choose a bride for the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you think of the things that as followed his life and and and all the things that the sequence of his life and how it how it went. But his real purpose was for you when Alisa left with camels and such like to go down, right? He was hunting a wife for for Isaac. The favored one was Rebecca. So all that God have done for us in this day is to through our prophet was to bring you and I to attention realize now you are the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; This message has come to me &gt;&gt; to you in a personal way but because you are now being married to the king of kings the lord of lords &gt;&gt; you become invisible union you become Mrs. Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; in in at the end of his life say I was born the son of Charles and Ella Brham right so you may have always thought I was Charles William Brham then one day I found out that I am Mrs. Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; What you are going through right now is just temporal. &gt;&gt; Everything around us, your situation, your house, your car, your land, whatever you may have is just temporal. &gt;&gt; One day it will be no more. It will have no value. &gt;&gt; Okay, we put value ministering for me from Guyana this morning back home. He talk on what is value? What really is value? Listen bel this message is the most valuable thing that could have ever struck the earth. &gt;&gt; You know the value of this message? This message will one day give you and I a body change. &gt;&gt; The best hospital in all the world put together in Canada wherever you live can't give a body change. &gt;&gt; You could exercise until now and thy kingdom come and nothing going to happen. And you're going to get older and older and older. You could eat the best organic food. No this, no GMO, no nothing. You're still going to dead in Trinidad. They're dead. &gt;&gt; Not sir. &gt;&gt; In Canada different. &gt;&gt; None of us. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry to talk. So sir, will you forgive me? I sorry this thing on air you know well it was bet thing and then send it when it when it qualified to go on stream then put it out anyway but the way I'm going live not regarding that but not disregarding the fact listen you we all are dying &gt;&gt; then where is value what is really value not to be connected to the Lord Jesus Christ not to know him in the power of his resurrection &gt;&gt; it's the greatest thing that has never come our way. &gt;&gt; And the message that we have is approved by God. &gt;&gt; God validated. God put his stamp approval on it. &gt;&gt; God was identified with the messenger &gt;&gt; just to give us the assurance that this thing is real. This thing is true. &gt;&gt; There's not going to be another message like this message &gt;&gt; because we are living in the final days, the final time in Satan Eden. I put it this way. God put the weakest of people the believers in Satan when he had the best his kingdom is the greatest. It can't get better than this at all with AI and technology and do you know you live you our lives I remember I've said it here we live better than Queen Elizabeth the first Queen Elizabeth bed didn't have air conditioning she never take a plane right she didn't have car that automated and and have the things like we have regardless of how much servant she had she still didn't have air conditioning and refrigeration and all the things we We are living this is Satan's Eden. &gt;&gt; It is going to a climax &gt;&gt; the best that he can give. But that is the limit. &gt;&gt; But God put the weakest of his believer. You know God is look how God is unusual. God's purpose. You know if I had to make an enemy I would have make a small enemy. Are you understanding me? Why did God take a devil and make Satan and make him equal to himself except for for creative ability? He was a match for God. Are you understanding me? &gt;&gt; God's enemy is he was the cherubam leader in heaven. &gt;&gt; He wanted to ascend higher than God. He thought he could have make himself greater than God. and he's still looking for worship. And if it is that he put the God put the weakest because God know the weakest of my believers. He didn't take Paul and David and them mighty warriors. He put you and I know why he have confidence &gt;&gt; in you that the weakest of believer can defeat the greatest enemy. And no matter what he put in your in before you, you will overcome &gt;&gt; because the word of God is resident inside of you that I was born to overcome. &gt;&gt; You are born to overcomer. You already have a head start because the one who overcame on your behalf already overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. Inside of you resides a mighty conqueror &gt;&gt; because God's purpose have to be accomplished. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God has put us in this day to defeat Satan. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wasn't God who and Satan who came to God and on the day of reckoning and God tell Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job?" Why God had confidence in Job? God has confidence in us. He put us in Satan either because he will take his bride to defeat Satan &gt;&gt; because Satan can present anything to you and you will turn it on &gt;&gt; because you have your eyes only for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your eyes are set upon him. Amen. Your eyes are set and no matter what comes your way, you will overcome. &gt;&gt; Say thank the Lord. Amen. I want to thank God that I am part of God's eternal purpose. Many times in our lives, the prophet of God says he say uh he want to drop a little nugget for you. Slide 12. Amen. And that speaks of Joseph when he was sent down into Egypt. And I'm telling you that God had a purpose because God knew had already told Abraham before your people will sjourn in a strange land for 400 years and I will deliver them with a mighty hand. &gt;&gt; That was done in the record. God set out the purpose and he say what he's going to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that when the time came that God sent Joseph down in Egypt to prepare the way. would look at the way and the method that God used. Uprooted him from his family, sold into slavery, ended up in Potifer's house, and then thrown into jail. Right? But along the way, Joseph was always ascending. Amen. That even in prison, the bottle and the baker who are thrown into prison recognized that he had a gift. The prison God realized that Joseph was not an ordinary person and he put Joseph in charge of even the prison. &gt;&gt; Why? You will realize one day wherever you go because Christ is in you somehow you are rising above. &gt;&gt; And it is because of your attitude, your ability, you become trustworthy. Amen. You do what you have to do. You are honest and you are straight. You can be trusted. You God wants people like that. You can be trusted. As he told Satan, have you considered? And Satan said, well, because you cover him and you protect him. That's why. And God give him limits. There is no test that will overcome you. He never gives you more than you are able to bear. &gt;&gt; Whatever test you are going through right now, God is allowing it because he know you have the capability to overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. test will come your way. Listen, it doesn't matter what the situation is, you have to rise up and overcome. &gt;&gt; Listen, don't be defeated. And don't act like you are defeated. Listen, Satan threw everything at Job. But he never cursed God. All he talk he talk, he never cursed God. But God have that documented for us that we can look at job and if Job overcome we can also overcome because at the end of it there's going to be a blessing that is going to come. May the Lord help us. So Joseph was sent down into prison. He was thrown into prison and he stayed there and instead of coming out as quickly as he thought he would have been, he would remain another two years. Whatever God was doing, he was preparing him for the role that he had to come to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometime God has to put us through so that we can learn forgiveness. &gt;&gt; Remember Joseph's brother, the same brother who sold him into slavery, had him suffer so many years down in a strange land would come one day and bow before him and not even know who to whom they were bowing. But God the prophet said and the Bible shows us that he was sending him there for posterity not to preserve himself but for generations to be preserved. &gt;&gt; All of Israel was preserved in Joseph. You know your suffer suffering sometime you go through a testing but it's not for yourself but it's to prepare you to help somebody. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You can empathize with a brother. You can empathize with a sister. You can know what they are going through and you can feel for them. &gt;&gt; So your test is not may not be necessarily for yourself, but it's to prepare you so that you can help somebody along the way. &gt;&gt; May God help us, friends. Maybe be prepared to realize that we are here to serve God's purpose. Amen. Barraham said in his life story he said I wasn't I wasn't I was too much of a but God was preserving that gift for this day that was altered I was determined slightly I was determined to do it but it was God that protected it for that day here was Abraham he lost his wife and he feels a sense of responsibility albeit the circumstances surrounding which he did not go with the colored people. You see, God's purpose was for you to go with them people. &gt;&gt; But he felt that, okay, the mother-in-law said they colored and there's a whatever you call holy rollers or whatever what is the term trash. You read it. &gt;&gt; She called them trash, right? But God wanted him to go. That's why when he was down the river and the boat was going down to the falls, he tell God, he said, "Lord, it's not me who called them trash." You really &gt;&gt; He says, "Not me. He's the his mother-in-law says so. But he listened to her and you know what happened? You know what it cost him? His wife and daughter. God took them away. And he attempted to take his life. And twice, two occasions, he said, "But was not me. I was determined to end my life." But God was determined to protect him. So he didn't have control over his own life. when he wanted to smoke the pillar of fire came in to show that he's a big man and a strong man but God was protecting his purpose &gt;&gt; and his purpose was identified inside of brother Brham &gt;&gt; when brother Brham was desirous to go up he said Lord after the opening of the seals you know you would think people receive him and all these revelation come and he get rejected and he say going to be a hunter and go up in the mountains and when the Lord give a message he'll come Now God's telling me say, "Listen, you go and do that, you will end up a bomb on the street because God's purpose is that he came to reveal and fulfill Revelation 10:7." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And though he want to be a hunter and he like hunting and all the nice argument, he using to go up and he will come back. God said, "That is not how I call you. That is not what I want you to do." what his desires was wasn't in keeping with God's program. And I'm telling us this morning, God may have a program or a plan for your life. Align yourself to the program of God. &gt;&gt; Because he will force you to do what he want you to do. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; With the one condition at the end of it, he knows best what is for you. &gt;&gt; You will receive that he work it out for your good. Whenever you are in the will of God, there is fulfillment, there is joy, and there is peace. &gt;&gt; Moses run, Moses uh he tried to do God's plan. God said that's not the way. He end up in the backside and he said and God keep him there for 40 years until he was ready. He say ready now Moses come let me talk. Don't give God a hard time because he had a purpose for you. God wants us to come to the state of maturity where we can be directed by him, where we can be led by him. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do all the way my savior leads me. What have I to ask beside? Can I doubt his tender mercy? Who through all through my life has been my guide? When God guides you, he is sure to be blessed. &gt;&gt; It doesn't give you all the comforts of life. It might be harsh circumstances. Like I said, Joseph went in prison. Abraham had to to go go through the hard test, the rugged test. We sometime feel that Abraham's life was easy. It wasn't easy. Let my say this before even if you are a young Christian, the Christian life is not a bed of roses. There are going to be battles. There going to be strife. There are going people come against you. You're going to get persecution. But in all of that, you can praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; In all of that, you can glorify God. In all of that, you can say, "Thank you, Lord Jesus." &gt;&gt; And there's a peace that comes from knowing God. &gt;&gt; Well, we realize what is real value. Real value is not how much we have on this earth. I am I'm not dis disregarding or telling you to give away all that you have, right? But use it for the kingdom of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And put value where it really belongs. But real value is in winning souls for the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; One soul won. Abraham said the value of a soul is 10,000 worlds. You can't put value to 10,000 world. I know one world. I know Canada or Ontario or whatever. You know, all the world combined a soul is more valuable than that. &gt;&gt; Your soul is more valuable than that. It is precious. And if you can by God's grace encourage one another to serve the Lord to keep pressing on. That's why there is power in prayer. Many people don't realize the Abraham said prayer is greater than an atomic bomb. You get down on your knees. You can the devil tremble when you pray. &gt;&gt; The great Satan when he start to pray, oh my, there you go again. You know why? The kingdom start to shake. &gt;&gt; One brother, one sister in prayer. And if we can get together, if two shall agree touching anything, it shall be done. &gt;&gt; Let's move, man. Let's get together with one objective. Let's get another soul saved. Let's encourage somebody to the Lord, a brother or sister, whatever may be happening in their life. Reach out. Amen. Call someone. Love someone. appreciate the grace of God in our lives. Abraham said, "I was determined to do it." He say, "I could not say that I was any good, but it was God's grace, amazing grace, that kept me from doing those things." He say, "I wanted to do them myself, but he just wouldn't let me do it." Why is he saying that? Listen, there are things we would have done. Do you know it's the grace of God that have me standing here? &gt;&gt; Do you know it's the grace of God that have you in this house this morning? There are people who are better than I, better qualified, better merited, and more good. And and in my words, they're nicer than we. They live good lives. They they they're sincere in what they do. But God leave them and choose you. &gt;&gt; And it is grace that choose you and brought you into his house &gt;&gt; so that you can feast on the living word of God. Thank you. &gt;&gt; The prophet call it the unfailing body word of the son of the living God. That this word gives us life. This word that we are feeding on will one day bring our body change. &gt;&gt; You know what it mean? &gt;&gt; Sarah and Abraham was given a promise to go to have a child. When MelchzDC came, Amen. that promise was in fulfillment. MelchzDC has come again. &gt;&gt; Yes, he &gt;&gt; when he said who is this MelchzDC? He knew that MelchzDC was in him. &gt;&gt; It was not a man. It was a man voice being used, a man talking. But it was MelchzDC in him &gt;&gt; that he was expressing the mind and the thoughts of God &gt;&gt; so that we can bring us connect us to the plan and purpose of God. &gt;&gt; That God wants to have his preeminence. Do you know what it means? that the same we look at brother Abraham's life and the kind of miracles that accomp that same God wants to reside inside of you and I &gt;&gt; doesn't he said the bride has thus said the Lord &gt;&gt; that whatever she says that's how it's going to be &gt;&gt; because you are now the wife of the Lord of the harvest &gt;&gt; and you are acting on his behalf My &gt;&gt; Abraham said, you know, when you read the title of the message, who is this Melzdc? You tend to feel that Barra is talking about God and giving the the the attributes and the characteristic of God. But do you know Abraham spend more time the essence of that message is letting us know who we are. You know what our prophet tell us? We used to think we get saved, right? Well, I get saved. I accept the Lord. It's not you accept the Lord or not. Is the Lord accept you? &gt;&gt; He choose you. &gt;&gt; You didn't just come into the message just so you know is God had you, &gt;&gt; brought you into the message. &gt;&gt; If God had to root uproot you like he did some of us from Trinidad and the Caribbean so that you could come in the message. I was telling I was sharing with brother Christopher my brother. I said God had to take you out from an environment where it would be easier for you to serve the Lord. Ah despite all the cold weather and the winter I had said to him Danny I will never come back in this country in December and here I am again. But it is God's purpose. &gt;&gt; God has a reason why I'm here today. And God had a reason why he took him out and placed him in an environment where he could be directed by God and God's purpose can be achieved in his life. &gt;&gt; And God's purpose was greater than his own plan and in his own thinking. &gt;&gt; But I dare say that God have blessed him abundantly. And once you see God's purpose in your life, you will begin to appreciate the grace of God in your life. Oh, brother Abraham said to us in the in the message, who is this man? The complete secret of your life has been made known. You got read the complete secret from I put it this way from where you come from, why you are placed on earth, and where you go after. What more you want to know? And do you know what he said? We are placed on earth to be tested. D I said you mean to for the rest of you you know what you'll be tested but every test come you overcome and as you overcome you climb higher and higher. Could you imagine Jesus being flustered? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Could you imagine Jesus being flustered? When Jesus was crossing and he told them let us go to the other side. You know what Jesus went and do? He was sleeping in the boat. You know why? Because he said we are going to the other side. And no amount of storm that Satan could raise could kill him. Satan listen, Satan cannot cut off your life. You get sick, your boy, you go dead. You can't just so you don't just die. Satan cannot touch you. If God I was asking a friend of mine he's a little bit compromised hell twice and such like I said are you ready to die he said no you free to dead I said boy at this stage you're like you should be ready to dead it's not that I want you to die but no believer if all of you here not all you can't say that Lord if you take me home praise the lord something wrong &gt;&gt; yeah is it truth. &gt;&gt; What are you afraid to death for? &gt;&gt; The only reason why you should be afraid of dying is because you're not ready &gt;&gt; or you're not knowing where you're going. &gt;&gt; But if you know where you're going, then you should say, "Praise the Lord." Lord, if it's your will that I should go, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Once you can have that testimony, Satan go and didn't Paul say, "What can separate me from the love of God? Shall nakedness, trial, persecution?" He said in all of that we are more than conquerors. &gt;&gt; For me to live is Christ and to die is gain. If I dead it better for me. &gt;&gt; So Paul wasn't afraid of death. Why should we be afraid of death? &gt;&gt; Then it means we don't have an understanding what lays beyond the curtain of time. But once you begin to understand the complete secret of your life. But while we are here we can serve God's purpose. We can win souls for God. We can display Christ to the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is time that the message come out at iPod and iPod and all kind of thing and books and start walking on feet. &gt;&gt; That when you walk, you are the message embodiment. &gt;&gt; Jesus couldn't be flustered because he knew he was doing the will of God. He was in the will and the program of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And once you know that you're in the will of the program of God, you have no fear because you are God's purpose. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's it. I I shared with I had a associate brother a wonderful brother preacher right and he had traveled and he came back to me and he said um he called me bro he said bro I had a dream a strange dream a dream that the rapture is taking place and I am seeing people going in the rapture and we're talking just like you and I and I see where they are sitting and the rapture is in effect and he's looking on. And he said to himself in the dream and he telling me they said he said I said as he said you mean to say after all the years of service and and preaching and such like you mean I didn't make it and the angel or whoever was it him says you are not in that dimension. &gt;&gt; So he tells me the dream and it seemed but I understood and I'm sure you understood right? that when the rapture is in effect, he wouldn't be here. &gt;&gt; And a few years, a year or two later, brother, he he took sick and he was diagnosed with a cancer on the by the in the in the brain in the middle of the brain and he eventually died. But he knew and look at God's grace to he knew God tell him you're going to go before the rapture take place. I had people come to me and tell me they're praying 40 days and he going to go to die and I said but the Lord already told the brother he going to go &gt;&gt; but it give us assurance &gt;&gt; hallelujah &gt;&gt; it give us confidence that you know that where you're going to go &gt;&gt; because God tell him you are not in that dimension you I'm going to take you home once your purpose is finished then you should be ready to say Lord take me home You want because you have one desire and one passion is to serve God's purpose. &gt;&gt; You say, "Lord, what is my purpose?" Amen. &gt;&gt; And God's purpose, you ought to find out God's purpose in your life. it. Listen, if your role is just to be a doorkeeper, a cleaner or whatever it is that just to come and worship, if your role is just to pray, sometime I believe the power in the church is more by those who spend a little time on their knees. You can sense it by brother Danny that you know that brother, that sister, you can count on them to pray because they spend time and they connect to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's a powerful role and purpose that your prayer is bringing down a blessing. Your prayer is helping the ministry. &gt;&gt; And it may seem simple. It may seem insignificant. But your role is important in God's po program &gt;&gt; because souls and lives are being touched because of your devotion, your consecration, and your dedication. &gt;&gt; Find God's purpose in your life. It may not be at the front. It may not be in the forefront, but wherever it is, you serve God's purpose. David, Joseph's purpose was greater. He had to go down. He suffered. He went through all of those things. But ultimately, the nation of Israel were preserved because he was in place where God wanted him. &gt;&gt; May the Lord help us. Amen. To find purpose in our lives. Amen. God's purpose in our life. Brother Abraham said that just a couple of quotes to to settle the thought. He said he's talking to a gentleman. He said, "Did you ever stop to think that God put you here on earth sometimes besides raising hogs?" Here was a man who was more preoccupied with mining animals or raising hogs. as legitim as legitimate as it may be. God put you here to be a son and daughter of God, not just to raise hog alone. In other words, it's not just to have a comfortable life and to have money and to be such like that. God didn't put you here to work in a factory alone. He put you here as a testimony, a written epistle read of all men to live an honorable and decent life, hid consecrated life with God so that men would know Jesus Christ still lives and reignal &gt;&gt; that you can walk that people believe this woman like I said the accident she said she tell her mother she don't believe in God it know God her mother had bad experiences and I don't know what she was going through. But she said she stopped believing in God. But if it caused me an accident to point her back to God, it's worth it. &gt;&gt; What if I didn't come out and start behaving bad? You know them road they call road ra. You understand? You wonder sometimes some people behave and you wonder if they really Christian or not. They'll lose their temper, get all back. Like I tell them, oh, I in church, my children know me better than you all sitting in the congregation because I could come and preach a nice woman, but when I go home is a hotteered, badteered, impatient old man, you know. Oh, all lose all your cool home. They know me. I come and greet all the brothers. I say, "God bless you, my brother. How you doing?" And when I go home, you see that brother and I start bad talking him home. The whole church business in my house and the children know why what going on. What they said them don't know that he's a big hypocrite. They might tell me that you I reflect Christ home. They know my life. They know my behavior. They know my pattern. Just like my wife will know me better than anybody else. You've got to represent Christ. Your best service ser message is the one that has lived. Your best sermon. Remember the situation where a woman was um a man was told that there are no true Christian. He and the partners drinking partners. He's not a Christian and the partners is not Christian. And he said, "I know one true Christian." He said, "Yeah, well, let me know who that is." He said, "My wife is a true Christian." He said, "Well, let me go and test you out. Let me see how much Christian she is." They gone home and they behaving drunk and they ask you for eggs and she make the egg and she throw the egg on the ground, smash the plate, whatever it is, right? You remember all of them so you know, but they just testing out the wife to see she walk reaction is. And she she say, "Honey, I'll make you another thing." And he get up and say, "Get out." Thank you. Where's the Maybe there's a there's a nice way to tell me to stop. You can do it a nicer way. I understand. I get the message. I don't I was asking before I come there preacher. I a Trinidadian but I I feel hour is enough. Hour and 15 minutes if you give me a little extra. But you don't need to go too long now man. That's not true. Okay. But although I'm for long, I don't preach long. So just give me a few more minutes. So here was a woman who was being tested. She don't even know they put it on a test for they went behind the door and she went and got a broom and started sweeping it up. And she said, "Must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free. There's a cross for everyone and there's one for you and me." Do you know what happened? That one test that she went through led three men to the Lord. &gt;&gt; And Breham says sometime you are being tested and you don't know. Your behavior, your attitude will determine how people will serve the Lord. Just be calm. If God have allowed it, say Lord, help me to overcome. &gt;&gt; Help me to override this situation. Because at the end of the day, whatever you do, you have to win them and point them to Christ. They have to see Christ in you. &gt;&gt; Wherever you go, you are driving, Christ must be in you. &gt;&gt; You're on your job, Christ is I'm okay with the mic. I'm okay. Thanks. Yeah. Christ is in you. Why? Because you are an written epistle read of all men. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are a written epistle read of all men. May God help us to see that that our one purpose on earth is to represent Christ. Maybe I just forget the notes. I just let let's just talk a little bit. Amen. How can Christ? We are living in a glorious time. Before I left, I was sharing a message on leadership, right? The great brother Abraham preached one of the greatest messages in the last three years of his life and all the others are great, right? But he's encapsulating all the thoughts of God. And his last formal message is leadership. And and most of you edu um you know who work in the environment know that leadership is an important subject and management subject because you have to learn how to manage people. But knew by God's grace the Holy Spirit in you could help you to get favor and to win favor &gt;&gt; and more than that to lead by an example. And one of the things that is set up with being a good leader, you got to be aware of who you are. And like I said, you've got to be aware that I am a son of God. &gt;&gt; I represent God. I represent a message. I represent a light that has come in this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, and once you can begin to come to that point, people can look at you and they know that there's something different about you. It's Christ on the inside. He's the driving force. There's a power inside of you. Others don't have it, but you have it because the Holy Spirit is inside of you to lead you &gt;&gt; and to guide you. You know, Brother Bram had and I will share that incident as I close. Brother Bram went he was hunting squirrels, right? And there were no squirrels where he was at and brother Banks Woods is is with him, right? And brother Banks say I know a place where you can get squirrels. I may have shared this story with you but I love it so much I'll remind ourselves of it again because in n you know the study of leadership they've taken years of accumulation of studies and looking at organization to come out with some of the qualities and characteristics that good leaders may have. But one of the things that good leaders have is the ability and to know how to talk to people. You know not we are not here to put you down. We are not here to condemn and criticize. We are not here to to to just you know express ourselves and make ourselves feel that we big. In fact we are nothing. Is only the grace of God. If God have put us with and trained us and put us in an environment where we learn certain things, it was God's grace to you and I. Amen. So here he was, he was hunting squirrel and Bram had already previously I believe it was spoken squirrel into existence. But this time God had something greater and I'll show you where I'm going at this morning that he brother banks tell him let's go across the hollers and there's a few acres of land we could get squirrel there and he goes there and he said but listen that man hates preachers so you sit in the car and wait and I'll go and talk to him. So he comes out of the car bar of banks and he goes and he identify who he was and such like I am banks and son of Jim Woods. Jim is my father and he said well Jim is an honest man you can hunt wherever you are you want and he said but I bought my preacher along and a 75 year old man real sharp he said you mean to say you get so long so low down you have to to a preacher wherever you go and brother say it's time for me to get out. So he comes out of the car and then he begins a conversation. And the man is mean really. He say, "I don't like you all preachers. There's nothing like God. I live here for how many years and I've never seen that thing you all call God." He say, "All I think about you preachers is that you all want to swindle the people and take their money." And in all of that, Brother Abraham keeps telling him, "You are entitled to your opinion." And brother Abraham never raises his voice. He never gets angry. He never says anything that is mean. He said, "Listen, you are entitled." The man say, "I don't like lying dog. I had a lying dog and a dog and I kill it." Basically, he telling Abraham, he say, "All all these lying preachers and just how I kill that dog, I'll kill you." That's what he's suggesting to him. And Barraham said, "But if he only knew what he talking about." But when he looked at Barra in his bloody coat and thing, he said, "But I like the way how you look. You know, you don't carry about yourself." You see how the disposition just created an impact and and you've got to conduct yourself and carry yourself in such a way that you leave an impression on people. You know, just for example, that woman said, "But there's something about you. You look like a good man." In the accident, you know, she said, "You look like a good man." I like that. We ought to look like a good man and a good woman. This is simple. The grace of God. But you create the right attitude. Never been flustered and never get on mean. And brother carries on the conversation with a man like that. And many times you will see and that's where communication skills come in. Brother keeps telling him you are entitled to your opinion. But he said, "Lord," here's what he buried the prophet said. He said, "Lord, this man must have worked these fields for so many years, these hard soils and such like. I he's about my father's age. If my father would have live, he'd have been about his age. Just give me something so that I can help this man." With all the demands attitude, brother Abraham said, "Just give me something that I can help him." And he said, "Lord, show me the way." And then the conversation and the man says to him, he said, "But there is one man I would like to talk to. If he ever comes back, I would like to meet that man. He was come to act on grounds. He had a prayer line. There was a woman who lives up the hill, right?" And here's how relates it. There's a woman who lives up the hill who had cancer and the doctor say she was died. He said, "My me and my wife would go up and help her." and you know pull the drawer sheets and such like and help her. You see her sisters go her sister went to the service and while she's there this man not being in this country calls the woman by name and tells her what her name was. He said when you left home you picked up a handkerchief from the table a white handkerchief with a blue figure in the corner from a marble tabletop and put it in your pocket book. He said, "Now take that handkerchief that you have in your pocketbook and when you go up back home late on your sister and she will get well." And brother Banks would want to tell brother tell her who tell him who he is now. The prophet said, "No, just give him enough rope." He said, "Give her co enough rope. He go hang yourself." What? Brother Abraham could have used that. If it was me, brother, I had a chop up one time. You know you're talking to the man and that's how we just behave. You want them to know who you is. Sometime we are nothing and we want to tell people you don't know who I is. When you talk like that, you don't really know who he is. If you had to tell people who you is something wrong with your king know who he is. We ought to know we are sons and daughters of God. And if you are nothing, God will make you something. Without his grace we are nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But this man he said you don't believe that that story a man come and pray and tell a lady he said listen man I can take you up to the woman children living up on the hill. He said isn't that so Jim talking to partner sitting with him and he said yes. And then changed the subject completely. Now you will relate to that story better than us because we don't have winter back home. He there was an apple tree and it was August and the leaves were beginning to fall. Now I taking it to a point. I want to show you God's purpose. This man was a infidel. This man don't believe there's a God and God had a purpose for Bar Abraham leaving where he was to come here to speak to him. And that's what I want to get to the purpose of God because he had an attitude. He say if that man ever come back in this area I want to talk to this man because he look like he different. I want to find out what it is who tell him this thing. And then Abraham changes the subject. He said they look there's an apple tree. I pick up an apple. He said can I have one and they eat it and such like and tell tells starts a conversation with him. He said listen it's not yet winter fall and the leaves are falling down from the tree. He said, "Why is that so?" He said, "Well, that's um the we're going to have our early winter." All right, we're going to have our early winter. The leaves, the sappers gone to the roots and the leaves are falling off. And Abraham said, "But it's not yet fall yet. How is it?" He said, "Well, that's just nature." And he tell him, "Well, if it is nature till the sap, leave the the tree, let the leaves fall and go down into the root. You take a bucket and put it on a post and let it happen to the bucket of water. He said, you know, I never thought of that, right? And that's how the conversation went. I never thought of that. And then Bram tell him, he said, you think on that while I go hunting and I will tell you it is the same intelligence that tells me about that woman that you will be healed. He said, you he said, would you remember his name? He said, yes. He said, Brham. He say yes that's the man and brother said think on what I have said. Now the thing point I want to make to you is that man had said he was so sincere if I wouldn't get a chance to talk to that man. I will want to find out what it was and God in his goodness God by his grace sent the prophet from one place to another place to meet that man to talk to him &gt;&gt; because that man was fall was going to come. He was in the end of his life. Winter was going to happen. He died the next year. And he was not prepared for the winter that was to come. He didn't have the intelligence of an apple tree. &gt;&gt; The apple tree had more intelligence and know winter is going to come. Go down into the roots. &gt;&gt; And we've got to have the intelligence more than an apple tree to know that we've got to have that intelligence to lead us and guide us in the life. And God in his grace has brought that intelligence to us. &gt;&gt; It is the intelligence of God that has come to us &gt;&gt; that tells us about a rapture that tells us about the word of God that tells us we can have life in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; And I'm glad that we are connected to that life so that when our winter comes, we'll be ready. We'll be protected. will be hidden away &gt;&gt; so that we can rise again. &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said, "Everything that serves God's purpose will come up in the resurrection." &gt;&gt; And I want to serve God's eternal purpose. If my purpose is to be a doormat in the house of the Lord, I'd rather be a doormat. &gt;&gt; If my purpose is just to pray, I'd rather be a prayer warrior. Whatever is God's purpose in my life, let me serve God's purpose because it's going to come up. He say in the resurrection. &gt;&gt; There has to be a resurrection because you are serving God's eternal purpose. And that's where we got to find God's purpose for our life. Serve it to the best of our ability. &gt;&gt; Amen. and just do his will and we will all come up in the resurrection. &gt;&gt; There's no big me or big you or small you. All of us are the same in God's kingdom. &gt;&gt; All of us are bought with the same price. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Danny price is the same as my price is the same as your price as everybody price here. The blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. So we are all one and we have one common objective. We are part of the body of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; If something is wrong with my toe, my hand can't say dicey toe. Leave it alone and know the hand say well you know you more important you high up and the toe doesn't be touching the ground. The toe and my hand is the same because when my toe have pain my head is telling my toe have pain. So all of us are on the same level and we are all part of God's great purpose. Brother Danny might be the one, the song leader might be the one, but you are part of the purpose because you are bringing down the presence of the Lord when you come prepared in the in the house of the Lord. You bring the presence of God in the midst of the people. &gt;&gt; You think of that little girl, one little colored girl. What about the woman from Memphis? Amen. I've shared that story with you some time ago. Here was say a colored woman. Amen. She find her purpose in the word of God. She say I am like the Shomite woman and here is God's prophet flying in an aircraft heading back home. But she was part of God's pro program. &gt;&gt; Amen. And she went down on the knees. She said, "Lord, I am like the Shamomite woman. And if I am the like the Shomite woman, then where is your Elijah?" Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God had to change the program of the prophet. He could have stopped that storm. Amen. In Colorado. But this storm that a little colored woman created in our home. He couldn't stop. There pilot couldn't say, "Well, I going somewhere else." God created allowed that storm to come. Because a woman was in prayer and she had a need. &gt;&gt; She was God's purpose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And she found God's purpose for her life and for her son. That son was a hardened son, a disobedient son. But when she get down in the knees, SHE SAID, "LORD, YOU give me that son." &gt;&gt; Amen. And I want him saved. When brother Abraham came to the house, Amen. She said, uh, she said, "Preacher, he died in the doctor." A man said, "Don't come back to my house. He will be dead. He go, there's nothing I could do with him." And for two days, he's been out in the dark crying, "Mama, mama, it's dark." Amen. until the prophet came to the door. Amen. She said, "I don't want him healed. I just want to know that he's saved and then let the Lord take him." &gt;&gt; Look at the wisdom of a colored woman. She knew that salvation was greater than healing. &gt;&gt; SHE PUT VALUE WHERE value belonged. &gt;&gt; SHE KNOW THE PURPOSE THAT SALVATION WORTH MORE THAN ALL THE LIFE HE COULD LIVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And God by his grace brought his prophet Amen and brought him on the scene. My you know you think of it an ordinary simple woman bring God's prophet make him walk six miles to come to our house and keep that plane waiting until she done get prayed for. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. Listen, can't we with expectation come the same way? If a woman can bring a prophet to your house, CAN'T WE BRING GOD IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD? CAN'T WE BRING GOD IN OUR HOME? He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; If it happened in Memphis, IT COULD HAPPEN IN HERE IN TORONTO. IT COULD HAPPEN IN TRINIDAD. IT CAN HAPPEN IN AMERICA. IT CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE BECAUSE HE'S THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER. [Music] Do you know brother say if God is not the same then that the Bible could be put away as just another book of fallacy. &gt;&gt; Let me repeat that. If Jesus is not the same yesterday, today and forever. We could do away with the Bible because all it takes is one word that is false and you could get rid of the rest. &gt;&gt; But he's the same yesterday. I say it again THIS MORNING. HE'S THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER. AND IF HE DID IT IN THE PAST, HE CAN DO IT AGAIN &gt;&gt; AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. &gt;&gt; There is nothing too hard for God to do. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we are tested. Sometime we face situation. It might be our children. It might be some situation at home. But we could be anything. But God is greater than your situation. &gt;&gt; God is greater than your problem. God is greater than anything &gt;&gt; that could come your way. &gt;&gt; You know, you think of the woman in the Bible, the woman that was caught in adultery. She was brought to Jesus. Sometimes God forced us to come to Jesus. She was brought to Jesus. God allowed her to be caught in adultery so she could come before Jesus. &gt;&gt; And when Jesus came, he deal with all the accusers. God wasn't Jesus wasn't or God wasn't concerned about all the high priests and Pharisees and all the scribes and Pharisees who was who who catch her. You ever stop to think of it when Jesus is done? Amen. Here she was. She brought before the woman you know to bring her and say we catch this woman in adultery. And my concern was if she was caught in adultery where the man she was she alone was committed adultery. But I say is one of their partners. Oh you don't like that man. We just defend who we want and when we want to condemn somebody we could fight all the fault in them. Typical human beings. Typical Trinidadian. Yeah. And she was brought before Jesus. But when Jesus was done, whatever he wrote on his hand, he get all of them. Big stone dropped there. Big stone dropped there. All of them dropped their stone. Every one of them left. And Jesus said, "Woman, where are your accurusers? Accusers?" And when she lifted her head, there was none. She said, "There are none, Lord." He said, "Neither do I condemn you." The only one who was qualified to condemn her was him. And he said, "Neither do I condemn you, but go and sin no more." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She was forced to be brought to Jesus. But Jesus purpose was to set her free. &gt;&gt; And God has one purpose in our lives. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR PAST IS. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING. GOD HAS COME TO SET YOU FREE. Just allow yourself to be free. &gt;&gt; There's something about freedom. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT LIBERTY. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT praising the Lord. DO YOU KNOW THAT THE prophet of God said, "You have never done it in the first place." &gt;&gt; PEOPLE MIGHT REMEMBER, YOU MIGHT REMEMBER, BUT GOD SAID, "I DON'T REMEMBER. YOU NEVER DID IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. &gt;&gt; He cleanses you. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE WIPES YOUR SLATE CLEAN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Your passings, your presents are what you may yet think. IT'S UNDER THE BLOOD. AND WHEN IT'S UNDER THE BLOOD, IT'S OBLITERATED. &gt;&gt; There is still power in the blood of Jesus. &gt;&gt; But if he has to come to you like he did at the woman at the well, he went to her. The Bible say he was there and he was waiting. Amen. For whatever it takes, he will get you because you are God's purpose. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; The Bible say he had needs to go through Samaria. You know why? Because God's purpose was coming for water that morning. &gt;&gt; Hey, imagine that. He leave the disciples. He say you go away. As important as they were to his program, he say all you go away. I have to deal with one on a onetoone this morning. God deals with you privately. He deals with you personally. &gt;&gt; But when he's true, Amen. A woman with a bad past, people could say what they want about her. Amen. I remember brother John Simon preaching that many years ago. That subject about the woman at the well. He said by the time she was leaving the well, her errands were coming out. Her clothes was dropping down and it was a different woman who leave the well that went down the city and tell them, "Come see a man." &gt;&gt; Why? Because she saw the one who was able to clean your heart. &gt;&gt; The one who was able to satisfy her need. &gt;&gt; Amen. The one. And I'm saying to this morning, that same one is here this morning. that whatever your thirst is, whatever your desire is, if there's a hunger inside of you, there's someone to satisfy it. If there's a thirst inside of you that is burning, there's someone to satisfy that thirst. Whatever your needs are, he's more than able to satisfy it. &gt;&gt; May God bless our hearts. He's still the satisfying portion. &gt;&gt; Let us all stand and give God praise this morning. Hallelujah, Lord. Lord, we give you praise and thanks, Lord. Lord, I thank you, Lord. You are not mindful of our past, Lord. You are not mindful of where we come from, our genetics, Lord. Maybe we have a a a checkered history, Lord. Maybe we have issues in our lives, Lord, Father, that we may have inherited, Lord. But, Lord, when you come, you can clean it up, Lord. You can rewire us, Lord. You can reprogram us, Lord. Father, you can PUT THE VERY MIND THAT WAS IN CHRIST INSIDE OF US, LORD. We say, Lord, let the mind that was in Christ Jesus come inside of me, Lord. Father, help me to THINK LIKE YOU.

Lord, we thank you for your direction in our lives, Lord. Many at times we feel that things are going wrong, Lord, but there is somewhere you are working it out. For we know that all things work together for good, that them for them that love the Lord and for those who are called according to his divine purpose. Lord, we believe by your grace you have chosen us by election. Lord before the foundation of the world you documented our names in the lamb's book of life Lord Father we are placed there Lord in your divine purpose Lord is not our choosing it is your choosing Lord we submit to your will and to your purpose Lord Father help us and forgive us for where we have gone wrong Lord oh God and just set us back right Lord Father that we can demonstrate the very mind of Godord Lord, we give you praise and thanks. We thank you for this wonderful ministry, Lord. Lord, I hope they have labored over the years, Lord, and it continue, Lord. Let it continue to grow, Lord. Let it continue to touch life, Lord. Father, many people are not mindful of the need for Christ, Lord. We live in a time when people have become so self-sufficient Lord and that though he might identify that they are going wrong or there's an emptiness in their life but may that seed wherever it may be may it be found Lord Father and may the ministry oh God continue to prosper and fulfill the great plan and mind of God in the area that they are. We thank you for our precious brother. May you continue to bless him Lord. Father, we ask it for your honor and glory in Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. And amen. The Lord bless you this morning. I have a I have a maker. That's how we go. I have a maker. Amen. Just give the sisters a key. I have her. &gt;&gt; He for my heart. &gt;&gt; And before even time began, my life was in his hand.

Were you blessed this morning? &gt;&gt; Praise God forever more. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Andrew, we've been on a series where I believe around part 12 or part 13, and the series is called the purpose of God. Amen. And so, you know, um sometimes the Lord, you know, is speaking to to to the sons and daughters of God, calling his children. Uh, you know, we've been in this series where the Lord is just showing us that, you know, we're in we're in this adoption phase of our lives where God is bringing out our true identities. Amen.

But you know that God in this hour, okay, is he's not it's not that he's not doing that, but he's working and perfecting the sons and daughters of God. We're we're we're we're late in the hour, saints. And there's many that, you know, sometimes God has to send somebody from Trinidad to come and let you know that he's the same God that's been speaking to us that's wanting to perfect our lives. And you know, that's what the five-fold ministry is to do, to perfect the church and to bring us into our true identity as sons and daughters of the king. Amen. We're not just children of this world. We are children of the king. Amen. And this is what I heard today. This is what just encouraged my heart to hear that that the Lord Jesus, he's not going to stop. He's going to deal with each and every one of you. No matter Listen, there's there's there's some of you here today that need to get closer to God. Amen. Praise God. That need to surrender their lives completely over. God was speaking lip to ear to many of us in this place, including me. Amen. Praise God. This is why we come into the house of the Lord. We we believe the word speaks to us that he's alive and that he's he he's he's mindful of our every need. Amen. And this is the time where he's saying, "Wake up and get into the purpose that I've given you. You are mature sons and daughters of God." Amen. It's time for you to take your rightful position because he's placing that authority in you. That's what the adoption process is all about. To place his authority in us. Amen. Praise God.

Whoever is a member of that try to be there around 1:45. Um also we have some um clothes. Some people maybe have forgotten their clothes or suit. A bunch of them, maybe 10 or so. Whoever has forgotten it, please take that, move it from there so they can have a space for the people to hang their jackets when they come to the service. So, whoever has forgotten his clothes downstairs in the hanger, make sure it's taken out from there. And also we're gonna need a few younger men to assist with the setting up the stage for the children's play. So the young men that are strong, we need your help. And right after the service for the young people's play. So um let's give God an applause and thank God for the word that came and weekend next week. Oh, that's the main thing. You have a big big big weekend for the Christmas dinner. And that's our pastor. I said nobody has an excuse not to show up. So, we expect to see everyone over there after the service, our Christmas dinner. If your name is not there, make sure your name is there. So, we expect to see everyone over there next week. &gt;&gt; I'm going to add to it. So that's next Sunday, the Christmas dinner. But what's happening Saturday? Something happening Saturday? &gt;&gt; My wife says, "Yeah, woman's Christmas fellowship is happening on Saturday, right?" So um the sisters, you know, it's it's it's the biggest one they have all year long. And and uh the there's uh Christmas cookies that they're baking and stuff. Anyway, you you should know about it. Remember, it's next Saturday. You're going to have a good time. And I don't know, usually something happens with the men on Saturdays when they're doing that. I don't know, Daniel, if you got something planned, but if he does, he'll let you know. And uh and on on Sunday, uh uh now uh just a note about the Christmas dinner. Uh we told them Friday how many people that are our numbers were okay? But I asked her, I said, "Hey, we're having Sunday service. Is there any chance of a little bit of movement?" She says, "Call me Monday." So, if you if you haven't signed up or if you don't don't know about it, you online um not sure about it, tomorrow is the last day because they can't wait. It's not a restaurant. They have to prepare all the food and do everything like that. Okay? So, the numbers have to be solidified by tomorrow. I think this is going to be our biggest one ever, by the way. So, thank God for that as far as numbers are concerned.
