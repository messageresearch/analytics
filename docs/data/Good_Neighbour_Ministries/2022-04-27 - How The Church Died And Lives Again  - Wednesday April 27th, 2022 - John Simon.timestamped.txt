[33:35] we are so thankful for the reading of

[33:43] god
[33:44] and that when we come into your house
[33:46] like this
[33:48] though we can't see you you have made
[33:51] our soul
[33:52] our spirits more sensitive to your
[33:56] divine presence
[33:58] and lord we are so thankful
[34:01] that uh you're pleased with us when we
[34:05] get together
[34:07] in the spirit of god

[34:51] bless us everyone we pray father
[34:54] in jesus name amen god bless you praise
[34:58] god please be seated
[35:02] hallelujah
[35:04] now
[35:05] we are coming
[35:08] to the ending of our studies
[35:11] of the seven church ages
[35:14] there maybe three or four
[35:17] more lessons to go
[35:20] however
[35:22] this that we are
[35:24] touching on
[35:26] these rest of lessons are really going
[35:29] to be
[35:30] a review
[35:32] a recapitulation
[35:35] of the
[35:36] entire
[35:38] seven church ages
[35:40] just to remind us of what we have heard
[35:44] and to drive the stake down a little
[35:47] deeper
[35:48] that we might be able to
[35:51] advance in our walk
[35:53] in our lives
[35:55] and in our entire approach to god
[35:58] hallelujah
[36:00] now
[36:02] what you have been receiving was a
[36:06] complete
[36:07] historical
[36:09] uh pattern
[36:10] of the growth and
[36:13] manifestation
[36:15] of the church
[36:17] as we know it
[36:18] and tracing
[36:20] her through the ages
[36:22] right on down
[36:24] by
[36:25] a bit of the history also scriptural
[36:28] that was given by john
[36:31] the revelator
[36:33] by god himself
[36:35] praise god
[36:37] well of course we are not adding
[36:39] anything new
[36:40] but we are bringing out
[36:43] that which is already in the word
[36:47] praise god
[36:49] much
[36:50] of the modern understanding
[36:54] or revelation
[36:55] of the word
[36:57] is misunderstood
[36:59] and that is why
[37:01] a misunderstanding has come about
[37:04] with the word church
[37:07] when we say church
[37:09] we we we tend to have a wrong
[37:13] understanding of that
[37:15] because that word church
[37:18] even though it means ecclesia or called
[37:22] out wands
[37:24] called out assembly in this case
[37:27] god is not speaking
[37:30] directly just to his elect
[37:34] he is not speaking just to the ecclesia
[37:38] or the called out ones
[37:41] because you see what satan did
[37:44] was to expand
[37:46] the meaning of that word church
[37:51] or coliseum he's expanded it
[37:54] so now when the word of it says church
[37:57] or you say church
[37:59] now that means to include
[38:03] all
[38:04] that claims the name of jesus christ
[38:09] all that names themselves as christians
[38:14] all that makes that claim
[38:17] is considered within
[38:20] this word when we say
[38:23] the church
[38:25] right
[38:26] because
[38:27] you understand
[38:29] that the real pure and true
[38:32] called out ones
[38:34] are the bride of jesus christ
[38:38] are the elected ones according to the
[38:41] word
[38:43] but satan loves to waffle and
[38:47] uh he loves to
[38:49] cause things to have shades of
[38:52] difference to confuse confuse and and
[38:56] have people in a state where they can't
[38:59] really focus on that which is the truth
[39:03] right so in this case uh when there was
[39:06] only one church
[39:08] now he has created so many variations of
[39:11] the same thing
[39:13] that the people are out there confused
[39:16] wondering well what is the true church
[39:19] who is the true church what is this all
[39:21] about you see god didn't do that
[39:25] god established one church but since
[39:29] the book of acts
[39:31] satan has created an atmosphere of
[39:34] confusion on belief and chaos
[39:38] in the minds of the people
[39:41] until now when the word church is used
[39:45] it means the all those who claim they're
[39:48] christians
[39:50] all who carry that name amen
[39:54] they say they are christians just like
[39:56] uh now siesta are the jew when you are
[39:59] not and then you say i'm a christian
[40:01] they don't live the life of a christian
[40:03] they don't know what really a christian
[40:05] is but because they born in a christian
[40:08] church because they were baptized maybe
[40:11] as a baby in a christian church or
[40:13] confirmed or something they make a claim
[40:16] of a christian they didn't make a
[40:18] conscious repentance and talk to god
[40:22] that god will speak to their own heart
[40:25] and then make a then that they will
[40:28] serve the lord hallelujah from the
[40:31] bottom of their heart
[40:33] so then they become a what we call a
[40:35] nominal christian
[40:38] you see that's a christian only by name
[40:42] praise god but god is looking for people
[40:45] who are christians by nature which he
[40:48] gave to them praise god those are the
[40:51] people that he's looking for his own
[40:54] praise god amen
[40:56] so what we're talking about when the
[40:59] spirit is speaking to the ages
[41:04] and particularly even in this age and he
[41:07] says the church
[41:09] it means he is talking to the entire
[41:12] field the entire group or of people
[41:17] around the world
[41:18] that claims that they are christians
[41:24] but we understand
[41:26] that within
[41:28] that uh that great group
[41:31] our swat of people is the true vine and
[41:36] the false mind
[41:38] it's made up of the true vine
[41:40] and also of the false vine amen
[41:46] and
[41:46] those two vines
[41:49] are motivated
[41:51] by two different spirits
[41:53] hallelujah your motive
[41:56] is your desire your action
[41:59] something that
[42:00] motive means puts you into motion right
[42:04] emotion power motivation what causes you
[42:08] to act what causes you to act the way
[42:11] you act right so one spirit causes its
[42:15] people to act a certain way
[42:17] and the other spirit
[42:19] act causes its people to act another way
[42:23] the true
[42:24] and
[42:25] the false vain hallelujah praise god
[42:30] oh
[42:31] one has the spirit
[42:33] of god
[42:34] and the other has the spirit of the
[42:38] antichrist
[42:40] and we say antichrist
[42:42] because uh
[42:45] it acts like a christian but it's acting
[42:47] against christ
[42:49] right
[42:50] it acts just like a christian but its
[42:52] works its actions its attitudes its
[42:56] plans its it's calculations all of it
[42:59] it's working against christ
[43:02] it's like a bugs
[43:04] eating at the foundations of the word of
[43:07] god
[43:08] secretly until one day your household
[43:11] your whole house crumble and then you
[43:14] find out that these wood ants were
[43:16] eating at the foundations and that's how
[43:18] satan tried to seed them in
[43:22] to the body of christ
[43:24] so that he might ruin it
[43:27] that he might destroy it and tear it
[43:30] down completely amen
[43:34] both of them claim to be known of god
[43:38] but one knows that they are known
[43:42] and the other one is hoping by their by
[43:45] zeal by works by emotions by
[43:49] worship by
[43:50] everything they do that they will earn
[43:54] god's attention
[43:56] hallelujah but he only has attention for
[43:59] his wife
[44:01] he doesn't have attention for nobody
[44:02] else
[44:04] right so this is what is happening with
[44:06] these two vines
[44:08] exactly out there so both claim
[44:11] to be known of god
[44:14] and both are claiming that they speak or
[44:17] preach or testify for god
[44:21] they're making that claim that they can
[44:24] do that
[44:25] i am one says i am the lawful legal wife
[44:32] so i have a right to speak for god
[44:35] don't you see
[44:37] all these dresses i have don't you see
[44:41] all of the wonderful
[44:44] uniforms i carry don't you see all the
[44:48] crosses he gave me don't you see all the
[44:50] emeralds and the gold and the power that
[44:53] i have that he that he gave me
[44:56] oh my but that doesn't prove anything
[45:00] amen
[45:02] usually most of the time those are the
[45:04] signs of a harlot to the word of god
[45:08] amen but there they are both
[45:12] are claiming they're carrying his name
[45:16] right and
[45:19] by that if they claim to carry his name
[45:22] they are claiming a relationship with
[45:25] him which he doesn't have with them
[45:30] meaning that they now become
[45:33] false accusers
[45:36] they become false witnesses
[45:39] of the word of god
[45:41] claiming the man
[45:44] christ jesus
[45:45] is doing something that is not doing
[45:49] because they're claiming his name
[45:52] and saying he gave it and he never did
[45:55] right
[45:56] and so they're bearing false witness
[46:00] against him
[46:01] claiming
[46:03] a relationship with him
[46:05] which god
[46:06] calls
[46:07] marriage
[46:09] spiritual marriage
[46:10] in an invisible union
[46:13] of your soul
[46:15] with the word of god
[46:17] hallelujah
[46:18] and uh that my friends
[46:22] no one can visibly look and see that
[46:25] union
[46:27] except from what comes out of you
[46:30] except by your action
[46:33] but satan knows that
[46:36] and through the ages he has perfected
[46:39] his
[46:40] christian act or his actions
[46:43] so that even now
[46:45] when you act like a christian walk like
[46:48] a christian
[46:49] then uh he has a his group walking and
[46:53] talking
[46:54] the same way but they are mouthing the
[46:57] words
[46:59] what makes the difference is the
[47:01] revelation of the word of god
[47:05] for flesh and blood has not revealed
[47:07] this unto you
[47:08] but my father in heaven has revealed
[47:11] this unto you
[47:12] and upon this rock i'll build my church
[47:16] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[47:18] against it that rock is the rock of
[47:21] revelation
[47:23] which the other one doesn't have
[47:26] and this is their downfall
[47:30] for their self-deceived
[47:33] deceivers of themselves they are distal
[47:36] they are uh self-deluded
[47:39] or as in modern times we'll use a word
[47:42] they're like legends in their own mind
[47:45] not according to the word of god
[47:49] here it is we find my friends
[47:52] they're not really married to him
[47:56] and therefore
[47:57] they don't have the revelation of the
[48:00] word
[48:01] but because they're claiming his name
[48:06] they put themselves in a position where
[48:08] everybody
[48:10] all that claims their christians have
[48:12] become responsible to him for their
[48:15] actions activities and whatever else
[48:18] they put out claiming to be the word of
[48:21] god
[48:24] we know that the false vine through the
[48:27] ages no matter what it did it could not
[48:31] overcome the true church the true vine
[48:34] it couldn't do it amen because jesus
[48:37] said the gates of hell
[48:39] the gates of hell oh my praise god look
[48:43] every time i'm talking like just just
[48:45] one sentence one word one verse and the
[48:48] whole thing just blooms and blossom you
[48:50] can go talk about the gates of hell now
[48:53] and oh jesus from way back there already
[48:56] seen them and talk about them and that
[48:58] the word of god his true elect are gonna
[49:01] have opposition and the gates of hell
[49:04] will
[49:05] will not prevail which means they're
[49:07] gonna fight against the world and fight
[49:10] against his children but they will not
[49:13] prevail
[49:15] is that right
[49:16] hallelujah i've said it before i'll say
[49:19] it again the devil thinks you're born to
[49:22] lose
[49:24] but thank god he already prophesied
[49:26] there it shall not prevail against it
[49:30] you already prophesied you will overcome
[49:33] the true vine will prevail the true vine
[49:37] will be the overcomers
[49:40] for they shall not prevail against the
[49:42] church
[49:43] no matter how wonderful how glorious how
[49:45] beautiful they look
[49:47] no matter how dumb and out she looks
[49:51] but yet the true church will prevail
[49:56] and they will make sure they bring the
[49:58] church to that position
[50:00] where she's brought down low
[50:03] and she looks like if she has nothing to
[50:04] even bother with
[50:06] but that's where the power and the
[50:08] presence of the living god would be
[50:10] living within her heart the quickness
[50:12] and power will reside there oh praise
[50:16] god forevermore hallelujah amen
[50:20] now you remember i was talking about how
[50:24] um
[50:25] that the the false church always wants
[50:28] to take its credibility and authority
[50:30] from the fact but look we have great
[50:33] works we got miracles you say you have
[50:35] signs we got signs they did that to
[50:38] moses they did that back in moses day
[50:41] and now they're doing it again oh you
[50:43] threw a snake down gonna turn into a rod
[50:45] and turn to a snake look weed can do the
[50:47] same thing look we do the same thing we
[50:49] have miracles we have tongues we have uh
[50:52] we have discernments we have all these
[50:54] signs wonders we've got visions and
[50:56] everything else like that but they
[50:59] failed to realize my friends
[51:04] that jesus said to his disciples
[51:07] have not i ordained you
[51:10] every one of them 12 of them right have
[51:12] not i ordained you
[51:16] and one of you is the devil
[51:19] a devil that was
[51:20] ordained a devil that was actually
[51:24] called out to carry out a purpose like
[51:28] it was
[51:29] in the old testament when um
[51:32] with micaiah and
[51:34] with another prophet when the devil come
[51:37] up before god and say you want a liar i
[51:39] i'll go down there and lie
[51:42] i'll go dumb in the mouth of that king
[51:43] and i'll lie i'll go down in the mouth
[51:46] of balaam's prophets and i lie
[51:48] i'll lie or oh my you see they don't
[51:51] realize that that was a devil and the
[51:55] devil and his cohorts does the same
[51:57] thing so jesus said
[52:00] i called all 12 for you
[52:03] fully well knowing what and who you are
[52:06] what one of you is a devil
[52:09] and one of you is going to betray me
[52:12] and you are going to put your hand and
[52:15] eat the same bread that i am eating the
[52:18] same word
[52:20] uh i have here you're gonna eat from it
[52:22] and you'll turn around and you will
[52:25] betray me
[52:27] amen
[52:29] do you believe that's happening
[52:30] spiritually now
[52:33] people
[52:34] that supposed to be christians denying
[52:36] the very word of god
[52:39] denying the very presence of the living
[52:42] god
[52:42] wanting to call it a false spirit
[52:45] wanting to call it something else when
[52:48] it's the spirit of god
[52:51] and you you must decide what do you
[52:53] believe
[52:54] or who do you believe or who do you say
[52:56] this is
[52:58] who do you say this is praise the name
[53:01] of the lord amen and judas had a
[53:05] definite holy ghost ministry
[53:07] it was definitely it was the holy ghost
[53:10] but we'll touch on that a little later
[53:12] here praise god amen but
[53:15] just like the first adam
[53:18] was given a brain
[53:20] and shortly after he
[53:23] was given her
[53:26] she was
[53:28] defiled
[53:30] or beguiled
[53:32] by satan according to the bible
[53:35] but she came from the hand of god
[53:39] clean
[53:40] virgin on the file
[53:42] but satan corrupted
[53:45] her way
[53:46] in a brief span of time
[53:50] look at the same thing happening with
[53:52] the second adam
[53:54] but now not just one woman
[53:57] it's a many-membered body
[54:00] as typed in the life of solomon who had
[54:03] the 3 000 wives or something like that
[54:06] but all those 3 000 women were
[54:09] considered to be his wife
[54:12] right and the same way
[54:15] all the millions of believers or around
[54:18] the world who truly believe
[54:22] they together are considered to be the
[54:26] wife of jesus christ
[54:29] now we understand like with the first
[54:33] adam whose wife
[54:35] was the file like that
[54:39] we find out clearly friends
[54:43] that even the wife of jesus christ
[54:47] was defiled in the same way
[54:50] because she came forth pure and fresh
[54:54] and anointed under their pentecost
[54:57] and she came out like that and remained
[55:00] separate from the rest of the world and
[55:04] undefiled for a short while
[55:07] and then
[55:08] the bible testifies to that by saying
[55:11] and of the rest of them there's no man
[55:16] join himself unto them acts chapter 5
[55:19] verse 13. in other words nobody was
[55:22] running to join that church
[55:25] as we see today
[55:27] people are running to join churches
[55:30] but there was nobody running to join
[55:32] that church why
[55:34] they heard about ananias and sapphira
[55:37] telling a lie to the preacher and prop
[55:39] falling down dead
[55:41] and having to be carried out to the
[55:43] graveyard
[55:44] amen
[55:45] they heard about this one telling a lie
[55:48] and the apostles just
[55:50] strike him blind you'd be blind for a
[55:52] season from this time
[55:54] and so on
[55:56] why would they want to join the church
[55:57] like that
[55:58] only if you are 100 true
[56:02] other than that you don't want anything
[56:04] to do with it because
[56:05] once those men speak on their word come
[56:08] to pass you are in serious trouble
[56:11] is that right
[56:13] listen to the scripture and of the rest
[56:16] there's no man join himself to them
[56:20] praise god
[56:22] but the lord added
[56:25] daily such as should be saved
[56:28] the lord who's adding the lord
[56:31] oh no i've got a a program of
[56:34] assimilation i've got a program of
[56:36] multiplication they they come up with
[56:39] the scientific programs from this doctor
[56:42] this and after that
[56:44] that they worked out programs of how to
[56:47] increase your church numbers and how to
[56:50] increase your attendance and programs of
[56:53] how to increase your sunday school
[56:55] programs and so on like that but the
[56:58] bible says
[57:00] what god himself added to the church
[57:04] such as should be saved
[57:07] is that right
[57:09] god added
[57:10] nobody else could add
[57:12] and when god add them they can fit right
[57:14] in but when god didn't add them the rest
[57:18] doors no man joined himself to them
[57:21] it wouldn't work whatsoever hallelujah
[57:24] amen
[57:26] how long they continued like that you
[57:29] know they continued eating
[57:31] eating the word of eating bread and
[57:33] having prayers and
[57:35] fellowshipping together as one in jesus
[57:38] christ hallelujah
[57:40] but one day just like eve was tempted
[57:43] the church was also attempted she was
[57:46] tempted and seduced by satan
[57:50] and contaminated
[57:52] by the entrance
[57:55] of an antichrist spirit
[57:58] right it was an antichrist spirit
[58:01] that entered into their
[58:04] thinking processes
[58:06] their believing
[58:08] processes
[58:10] amen
[58:11] for john said and we know it happened
[58:13] because in john 4 3
[58:15] amen
[58:17] that
[58:18] this is the spirit of antichrist
[58:21] whereof you have heard that it should
[58:23] come
[58:25] and even now
[58:28] is already
[58:30] in the world
[58:32] amen so he was acknowledging that it was
[58:35] already
[58:36] there amen and jesus himself said
[58:40] concerning the bride in that first age i
[58:43] have something against thee
[58:45] because thou has what left thy first
[58:49] love
[58:50] amen you left your first love you fell
[58:53] from where you were and you left your
[58:56] first love remember from whence the word
[58:59] fallen and repent amen praise god so
[59:03] what he's saying here is that the church
[59:06] the the ephesian church after paul left
[59:09] the scene became a fallen woman
[59:16] fallen from our righteousness
[59:19] fallen from our purity of the word
[59:22] and into darkness
[59:25] of the deceit of satan
[59:28] that was
[59:30] upon her amen praise god hallelujah
[59:35] well really what caused the church to
[59:39] fall
[59:40] at that time
[59:41] revelation 2 6 tells us
[59:44] did you have within you the deeds of the
[59:47] nicolaitans
[59:49] the deeds
[59:51] of the nicolaitans
[59:54] amongst you
[59:56] and so
[59:57] they dropped off what god is saying you
[1:00:00] you pulled away from depending upon me
[1:00:03] completely
[1:00:05] and now you want to have me and at the
[1:00:08] same time
[1:00:09] take on a hierarchy
[1:00:12] of human leadership
[1:00:14] you start leaning on human leadership
[1:00:18] contrary to the word of god
[1:00:20] rejecting my way
[1:00:23] and taking the way of this human
[1:00:26] leadership that is here upon
[1:00:29] the world amen
[1:00:31] so nickelodeonism their form of
[1:00:34] organizing human organization
[1:00:37] human systems
[1:00:39] of governing and ruling and you'll see
[1:00:42] right now the denominational churches
[1:00:44] each one
[1:00:46] has a different form of what they call
[1:00:49] church government
[1:00:52] amen
[1:00:53] ruling or dominating over the church
[1:00:57] oh but god has his way in his own bible
[1:01:00] and that's not
[1:01:01] that's not the same thing one is an
[1:01:03] organism
[1:01:04] the other is an organization
[1:01:07] its strength lays in its organization
[1:01:11] uh
[1:01:12] the strength of god's church lays in the
[1:01:15] fact that it is a living thing it's an
[1:01:18] organism infused
[1:01:21] and indwelt
[1:01:22] by the holy spirit who is motivating or
[1:01:27] moving her causing her to do and say the
[1:01:31] things she's doing and saying praise the
[1:01:33] name of the lord hallelujah amen oh my
[1:01:37] look
[1:01:39] the only reason for a government
[1:01:42] is to legislate rules for people
[1:01:45] is that right
[1:01:47] it's the legislative rules
[1:01:49] and then
[1:01:51] the the people will be ruled by what
[1:01:54] the laws that they created
[1:01:57] that's why you'll hear all around the
[1:01:58] world different nations saying
[1:02:00] we're a nation of laws we're a nation of
[1:02:02] laws we're a nation of laws we're ruled
[1:02:04] by law and
[1:02:06] that's really what it is
[1:02:08] and they're right but that's the natural
[1:02:11] level right when we come to the
[1:02:13] spiritual level we are ruled by our
[1:02:16] invisible king the holy spirit the lord
[1:02:20] jesus christ amen who lives in our
[1:02:23] hearts and governs us from the inside
[1:02:26] out praise god we are moved and
[1:02:29] motivated by him this great
[1:02:32] god in our midst we take god for that
[1:02:35] hallelujah that he's honoring us or
[1:02:38] honors us with his divine
[1:02:41] presence and we give god the glory you
[1:02:44] see
[1:02:46] the moment they took on religious
[1:02:48] government or organization
[1:02:51] denomination
[1:02:54] spiritual death entered to the church of
[1:02:56] god
[1:02:57] spiritual death entered right in just
[1:03:02] like how death entered by sin in eden
[1:03:06] again the spirit of spiritual death
[1:03:10] entered in
[1:03:12] into the church of the living god
[1:03:15] down through
[1:03:16] the ages in
[1:03:18] the very
[1:03:20] same way
[1:03:21] amen
[1:03:23] but thank god
[1:03:25] the spirit of god says
[1:03:27] to him
[1:03:29] that overcome it
[1:03:31] overcome what that spirit of
[1:03:34] organization
[1:03:36] that spirit of human government
[1:03:39] and systems to him
[1:03:42] that overcome it
[1:03:45] i will give to eat of the tree of life
[1:03:50] in the paradise of god
[1:03:52] well we know the tree of life is jesus
[1:03:54] christ himself who is the word amen i
[1:03:57] will give him he'll give you a
[1:03:59] revelation of himself he'll open up the
[1:04:01] word to your understanding he'll cause
[1:04:03] you to see things and he said he will
[1:04:06] give you that to you praise god but you
[1:04:09] see the church had already imbibed or
[1:04:13] taken in
[1:04:14] so much of the poison fruit
[1:04:18] of of the spirit of death in it
[1:04:22] that it was already
[1:04:24] dying and didn't know it
[1:04:28] right they were having meetings carrying
[1:04:30] on but they didn't know it
[1:04:32] just like modern pentecost today
[1:04:36] is dead
[1:04:38] and some parts dying
[1:04:40] but they don't know it
[1:04:42] they still think revival is going on
[1:04:45] revival is going on
[1:04:47] but they don't know the spirit of death
[1:04:50] has already entered in
[1:04:52] that is working within the
[1:04:56] organizations everywhere
[1:04:59] and they become so colors and hardened
[1:05:01] to it
[1:05:02] uh like the frog in the kettle that kind
[1:05:06] of heat to them seems nice
[1:05:10] but it's death
[1:05:11] in the pot
[1:05:12] to be that way
[1:05:14] according to god's
[1:05:16] word amen hallelujah oh my of course i
[1:05:21] repeat the message to that
[1:05:24] first church age
[1:05:25] was not just a message to that uh
[1:05:28] local church
[1:05:30] in ephesus
[1:05:32] but it was to
[1:05:34] the entire ephesian spirit that will be
[1:05:38] in all the church ages
[1:05:41] right on to the end of it
[1:05:44] for the church ages
[1:05:46] all run parallel
[1:05:49] is that right
[1:05:50] when we say oh the first church age
[1:05:52] ended in
[1:05:54] 64 80 70 a.d whatever that ended that
[1:05:59] means it officially ended
[1:06:01] but the spiritual life of that church
[1:06:04] age continues on
[1:06:07] right to eternity
[1:06:09] and likewise when the second one started
[1:06:11] maybe it started later but that
[1:06:13] continues on
[1:06:15] the third one starts it starts a little
[1:06:18] later but it continues on
[1:06:20] and so we come down to this end of time
[1:06:23] and that's why
[1:06:24] people are under such mental spiritual
[1:06:27] supernatural pressure because all those
[1:06:31] supernatural devils and demons of all
[1:06:35] them ages have now accumulated
[1:06:38] and they're coming against the saints of
[1:06:41] the living god
[1:06:43] is that right
[1:06:45] so you understand that
[1:06:47] that
[1:06:48] that
[1:06:50] that woman that had the seven devils
[1:06:54] in her
[1:06:55] uh a type of the church with all seven
[1:06:59] of them coming against her but at the
[1:07:02] end of it jesus cast them out the word
[1:07:04] will do the same thing again
[1:07:06] hallelujah it'll do the same thing again
[1:07:09] it takes the word of god to do that amen
[1:07:14] praise god hallelujah because uh we look
[1:07:18] at the church from another point of view
[1:07:19] like the seed and the sore when you had
[1:07:21] a field
[1:07:22] and uh the source sowed good seed but
[1:07:26] then uh an enemy came and he also sowed
[1:07:29] seeds well
[1:07:31] any field
[1:07:33] is able to take any seed
[1:07:36] whether it be good or bad whether it be
[1:07:38] grass
[1:07:39] or wheat
[1:07:40] it's all going to grow
[1:07:43] but because it grows doesn't mean it's
[1:07:45] of god
[1:07:47] you see it's just god just let it happen
[1:07:49] that way he sends his reign on the just
[1:07:54] and on the unjust
[1:07:57] oh my think of it that that you'll have
[1:08:01] uh
[1:08:02] all together one
[1:08:04] a devil one a true seed of god
[1:08:08] and the holy spirit's anointing falls in
[1:08:11] the church
[1:08:12] and all will say praise god all will say
[1:08:15] amen
[1:08:16] oh my but you see it's not the rain
[1:08:19] that's falling on you
[1:08:22] is that right it's what seed
[1:08:27] for every seed must bring forth after
[1:08:30] its kind
[1:08:32] the rain that's coming now is only to
[1:08:36] bring out what seed is buried in you
[1:08:41] to show what nature was planted in you
[1:08:46] before you even do it
[1:08:48] as the bible says before
[1:08:50] the foundation of the world
[1:08:53] god for ordained
[1:08:55] hallelujah
[1:08:57] i'm so glad
[1:08:59] that the true baptism of the holy spirit
[1:09:03] is not just the latter rain falling on
[1:09:06] you
[1:09:07] for you to have an enjoyable wonderful
[1:09:09] time but it's to bring out the life of
[1:09:12] the seed that is in you
[1:09:15] for every seed must bring forth after
[1:09:17] its kind
[1:09:19] then whose seed are you
[1:09:21] i was asked that question
[1:09:23] you are being asked that question whose
[1:09:25] seed are you
[1:09:27] what fruits your beer is going to show
[1:09:30] whose seed you are
[1:09:32] amen you don't have to try to work up
[1:09:36] real christianity
[1:09:38] oh i'm supposed to be an orange tree so
[1:09:40] even though i'm a lemon i'm going to try
[1:09:42] to see if i can bring forth
[1:09:45] an orange you see that's what's
[1:09:47] happening right
[1:09:49] oh christians are supposed to be lambs
[1:09:52] but i have the nature of a pig or a goat
[1:09:55] or a donkey
[1:09:57] but i'm going to change and i'm i'm just
[1:10:00] going to start acting like a lamb no it
[1:10:04] doesn't happen that way every seed must
[1:10:07] bring forth after its kind
[1:10:11] that kind of christianity is unconscious
[1:10:14] that kind of christianity is not made up
[1:10:17] that kind of christianity it comes from
[1:10:19] the core of your being from your nature
[1:10:21] inside
[1:10:23] hallelujah
[1:10:24] praise god
[1:10:26] those kinds of people from since they
[1:10:28] are small
[1:10:30] they always knew somewhere
[1:10:33] they were different
[1:10:35] but they didn't know why why am i acting
[1:10:37] like this why am i thinking like this
[1:10:39] why am i talking why am i letting people
[1:10:41] go they do me this they do that they do
[1:10:44] the other they tell a lie on me they do
[1:10:46] that yeah and somehow you don't have a
[1:10:48] spirit of vengeance you don't have a
[1:10:50] spirit of killing retaliation and all
[1:10:52] these kinds of things because there is a
[1:10:55] nature that god planted in there in your
[1:10:58] heart in your life and you can't help it
[1:11:01] that's the way you built
[1:11:03] praise be to god i'm glad i can say i'm
[1:11:06] one of them
[1:11:08] i said i'm glad that i can say i am one
[1:11:12] of them
[1:11:14] it is not i that live but christ that
[1:11:17] lived within me
[1:11:19] praise god i am
[1:11:22] what i am
[1:11:24] praise be to god hallelujah amen
[1:11:29] beat and the tears
[1:11:31] hallelujah the wheat and the tears
[1:11:35] growing up together like that and so the
[1:11:38] church became organized
[1:11:41] the church placed itself on the human
[1:11:44] government
[1:11:45] in
[1:11:46] contradiction to the word
[1:11:49] of god
[1:11:50] but you know
[1:11:53] tears if you put let me use grass so you
[1:11:56] will understand
[1:11:57] a little better
[1:11:59] if you have grass and wheat growing in a
[1:12:02] field
[1:12:03] the weeds
[1:12:05] always grow up faster than anything you
[1:12:07] can plant
[1:12:09] is that right
[1:12:10] your true planting will always come
[1:12:13] afterwards
[1:12:15] and so with the false church
[1:12:18] you have a true church and you're trying
[1:12:20] to teach people and grow them in the
[1:12:22] grace of god and you just see one sprout
[1:12:25] come up here another day or another
[1:12:27] and it looks like it's coming up so
[1:12:29] slowly but let the the false church just
[1:12:32] goes into an area oh my
[1:12:34] and
[1:12:35] just buy a piece of land in that housing
[1:12:38] project and
[1:12:40] they don't have no members there
[1:12:42] but we're going to have a church do you
[1:12:44] know from the first sunday that building
[1:12:46] is packed
[1:12:48] it's packed right away
[1:12:50] when i say that it's not that all the
[1:12:52] people are false what i'm saying
[1:12:55] that the
[1:12:56] making of that church is to pull in as
[1:12:59] many people as they can in there might
[1:13:02] be true and false you know a mixture of
[1:13:05] fish and frog
[1:13:07] but nevertheless they they'll pull
[1:13:10] a a great
[1:13:12] crowd in and so they're flourished in a
[1:13:15] great way praise the lord and
[1:13:18] they'll just be mighty in that way
[1:13:22] and they carry great influence and
[1:13:23] credibility
[1:13:25] by forming themselves into organizations
[1:13:28] because remember
[1:13:30] federal governments
[1:13:32] world governments government government
[1:13:35] at every level come down until you get
[1:13:37] local government right down down down
[1:13:39] down and all supporting each other
[1:13:44] even if you don't see any visible
[1:13:46] connection
[1:13:47] they are behind the scenes supporting
[1:13:50] each other
[1:13:52] is that right
[1:13:54] and
[1:13:54] so
[1:13:55] what happens my friends
[1:13:58] is that that gives the church
[1:14:00] credibility
[1:14:02] oh i am a registered corporation of
[1:14:06] so-and-so uh supported by the government
[1:14:09] and and the government minister comes
[1:14:11] and this and that and the other my
[1:14:13] friends they are supported by the
[1:14:16] government of the of the age that we are
[1:14:19] in right now hallelujah but think about
[1:14:22] it my friends
[1:14:24] it's just like
[1:14:26] when
[1:14:27] um
[1:14:28] a woman gets married man gets married
[1:14:32] or he's just oh he's over the top he's
[1:14:35] enjoying his honeymoon
[1:14:37] but you see
[1:14:39] um
[1:14:40] after a while all the passion and
[1:14:43] everything else start to die off
[1:14:46] and
[1:14:47] it continues on but maybe it's a steady
[1:14:51] strong steady
[1:14:53] love that continues on right on down
[1:14:58] but you know what some of those
[1:14:59] marriages change from honeymoon to blue
[1:15:02] moon
[1:15:05] i'm sorry it's just
[1:15:08] i'm not thinking while i'm talking i
[1:15:09] just
[1:15:11] i'm just
[1:15:12] explaining to you here that's what
[1:15:14] happened it becomes a blue moon and uh
[1:15:17] you know the guy
[1:15:18] the guy or the woman maybe have to go
[1:15:21] out
[1:15:22] and
[1:15:23] and maybe sing one of those old songs
[1:15:25] the blue moon of kentucky is
[1:15:28] something or the other and
[1:15:30] tears are coming down it changes and so
[1:15:33] the church changed
[1:15:36] with this devotion with its love with
[1:15:38] this passion with desire for the lord
[1:15:41] jesus christ
[1:15:44] completely amen my friends
[1:15:47] and so it influenced even some of the
[1:15:49] church leaders like polycarp
[1:15:53] who allowed himself to be established as
[1:15:56] a bishop
[1:15:58] it's not like a minister
[1:16:00] any minister that's really anointed with
[1:16:02] the holy ghost and if he has a
[1:16:04] congregation he's really the bishop of
[1:16:06] that church
[1:16:07] which means shepherd
[1:16:09] doesn't mean he's some exalted person
[1:16:12] he's just a shepherd
[1:16:14] right
[1:16:15] but when it says history tells you this
[1:16:18] that after polycarp
[1:16:20] uh
[1:16:21] may was made bishop
[1:16:23] this means that he was enthroned as a
[1:16:26] bishop
[1:16:27] they have a nice big chair and they put
[1:16:28] him to sit down they put a crumb on his
[1:16:30] head then they give him a staff and they
[1:16:32] gave him certain chains that must wear
[1:16:35] for everybody to know he's a bishop he
[1:16:37] was enthroned as a bishop and
[1:16:40] although he was a good man he accepted
[1:16:44] that
[1:16:44] see that shows he was a direct disciple
[1:16:48] of john the revelator it just shows you
[1:16:50] the deterioration
[1:16:52] of the true faith as it went downwards
[1:16:55] downwards into what historians would
[1:16:57] call the dark ages
[1:17:00] and the church entered into the dark
[1:17:03] ages of the church now i'm not going to
[1:17:06] keep you here forever praise god i'm
[1:17:09] just going to let you go because i can
[1:17:11] keep speaking like this but i just want
[1:17:15] you to be aware
[1:17:17] that after the true church lost this
[1:17:19] love it began to fall into all of these
[1:17:23] eras
[1:17:24] after that cooling off period period
[1:17:27] that she had after the period of
[1:17:30] blissful wedded life of pentecostal
[1:17:34] faith and power and the presence of the
[1:17:36] living god
[1:17:38] then
[1:17:39] she began to wander away
[1:17:42] revelation 2 1
[1:17:45] amen hallelujah it describes the lord
[1:17:48] jesus christ in the midst of his church
[1:17:50] holding the messengers in his right hand
[1:17:53] because the bride has fallen hallelujah
[1:17:58] and because the church was not become
[1:18:00] coming a corporate structure
[1:18:04] right
[1:18:06] rather than a spiritual
[1:18:08] and supernatural
[1:18:10] body
[1:18:11] led by the holy spirit
[1:18:14] now we will talk more about
[1:18:16] i'll think i'll end this tonight but i
[1:18:18] just you you know what i'm saying is
[1:18:20] that in our modern times
[1:18:22] the true church is looking like it's a
[1:18:24] primitive something that's it's not
[1:18:27] people don't even know what the real
[1:18:29] true church is
[1:18:31] and they're looking at these like when
[1:18:33] jesus himself came on the scene
[1:18:36] the pharisees had presented such a false
[1:18:40] picture
[1:18:42] of
[1:18:43] what
[1:18:44] a real
[1:18:46] jewish believer ought to be
[1:18:49] so when jesus came on the scene he seems
[1:18:52] like he was bucking all these things in
[1:18:54] the against this and against but he says
[1:18:56] but this is wrong did not uh isaiah said
[1:19:00] such and such oh wow you're doing the
[1:19:02] opposite did not moses say so and so oh
[1:19:05] how can you come you're you're doing
[1:19:07] this
[1:19:08] did not jeremiah's well did jeremiah say
[1:19:11] even your father abraham and he quoted
[1:19:14] from these different different ones and
[1:19:16] proving to them and they got so enraged
[1:19:18] and so angry the only way they can keep
[1:19:21] establishing themselves as the true ones
[1:19:25] was to kill him
[1:19:26] get him off the scene
[1:19:28] and so will it be with the
[1:19:31] true church of the living god
[1:19:34] whom the bible calls the little speckled
[1:19:37] bird
[1:19:38] sprinkled with the blood of our mate
[1:19:41] we free
[1:19:43] into into the glory of god
[1:19:46] and one day that's what we look forward
[1:19:48] for may the great holy spirit bless each
[1:19:51] one of you here tonight
[1:19:53] that have come to hear the word of god i
[1:19:56] trust that these few words
[1:19:59] would enter into your hearts and life
[1:20:02] keep you preserve you
[1:20:04] to the very end
[1:20:06] our gracious heavenly father as we have
[1:20:08] preached the word
[1:20:09] may the word now take its position
[1:20:13] and
[1:20:14] its preeminence
[1:20:16] may the word take its lordship
[1:20:19] and rule in the hearts of these
[1:20:21] believers
[1:20:23] for we commit them into your hands
[1:20:25] in jesus name praise be to god and as we
[1:20:29] go from this building now father
[1:20:32] not from your presence
[1:20:36] may your presence go up with us
[1:20:39] and as we go
[1:20:41] may you take us safely to our various
[1:20:44] homes
[1:20:45] protect us on the road
[1:20:47] surround us with your great love
[1:20:50] oh god bless
[1:20:53] granting health
[1:20:55] strength
[1:20:57] prosper
[1:20:58] your people
[1:20:59] in whatever they put their hands and
[1:21:02] minds and thoughts to
[1:21:04] and then bring us safely again that we
[1:21:07] might fellowship around the world
[1:21:09] with
[1:21:10] thee
[1:21:11] and with each other
[1:21:13] to thee be all the glory in jesus name
[1:21:16] amen
[1:21:18] we are dismissed brought tonight god
[1:21:21] bless you praise the lord
[1:21:23] it's okay we are dismissed and we can
[1:21:25] file out

[1:21:35] that's
