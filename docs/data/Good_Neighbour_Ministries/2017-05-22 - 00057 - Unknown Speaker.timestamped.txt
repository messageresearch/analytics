[1:16] written word send the fire of God upon
[1:19] it and cause it to live and open our
[1:23] open eyes that we may recognize who we

[1:31] going the Journey of life we commit
[1:35] ourselves to thee now father bless each
[1:37] one father and strengthen Us in this
[1:41] hour what a great day to be aligned in
[1:44] when the race is almost done and the Sun
[1:48] is setting in the M thank you Lord take
[1:51] praise honor and glory in the name of
[1:54] Jesus Christ for the glory of God Amen
[1:56] and amen God bless you praise God
[1:59] forever more
[2:00] Hallelujah let's read how be it we speak
[2:04] wisdom among them that are perfect yet
[2:08] not the wisdom of this world not
[2:11] theology nor of the princes of this
[2:16] world that come to not but we speak the
[2:20] wisdom of God in the mystery even the
[2:24] hidden wisdom which is which God
[2:27] ordained before the world World unto our
[2:32] Glory this hidden wisdom was left there
[2:35] for us to glorify us amen praise the
[2:39] Lord amen which none of the princes of
[2:43] this world knew for had they known it
[2:47] they would not have crucified the Lord
[2:50] Of
[2:51] Glory but as it is written I have not
[2:55] seen nor ear heard neither have ever
[2:59] entered into the heart of man the things
[3:02] which God had prepared for them that
[3:05] love him praise God Hallelujah for God
[3:10] hath revealed them unto but God has
[3:14] revealed them unto
[3:17] us the princes of this world didn't know
[3:19] it the theologians didn't know it nobody
[3:23] knew it but God has revealed it to us
[3:25] amen what a day don't take the seals
[3:28] lightly don't take the message lightly
[3:31] that God has chosen you one out of a
[3:34] million to reveal his word for this
[3:38] power to you thank you Lord people just
[3:40] go n l through the message oh I believe
[3:42] the message and is a sing song and I go
[3:45] to church and come home go to church
[3:46] come home and it becomes more of a habit
[3:48] and a tradition more than a revelation
[3:51] that's right but when you begin to
[3:53] recognize but wait a minute you know he
[3:56] he loved me amen D he saved me rising in
[4:00] Justified barely cared my S far away
[4:04] here I am now and the god of Heaven has
[4:07] opened the eyes of my heart that I might
[4:10] recognize in the word what nobody else
[4:14] could do he gave us the ability amen and
[4:17] made us to be seers of the word knowers
[4:22] of the word amen praise God and when he
[4:25] knocks on your heart you recognize him
[4:28] the word praise the Lord word to God
[4:30] Amen so eyes have not seen nor Nor Ear
[4:34] heard neither have it entered into the
[4:37] heart of man the things which God had
[4:39] prepared for them that love him for God
[4:43] but God had revealed them unto
[4:46] us by his Spirit not
[4:50] theology you're just reading your Bible
[4:52] and a wor of
[4:54] Life all of a sudden the scripture you
[4:56] read suddenly opens up amen doesn't look
[4:58] like much that's Revelation brother B
[5:01] said that's the most powerful thing
[5:03] Satan hates it you know why if you are
[5:06] reading a theology book or you reading
[5:08] one of the Bible studies that they
[5:10] normally give on TV or or whatever the
[5:13] devil can read he's reading the same
[5:16] thing you read you I'm saying but when
[5:19] God brother BR said comes and reveals
[5:22] something to a man it's in his heart
[5:24] devil doesn't know that he said he only
[5:27] knows when you act on or if you went and
[5:31] talked about it before you acted on it
[5:34] he said and I know better to talk about
[5:37] it before I act on it he says revealed
[5:40] to me I act on it before Satan has a
[5:42] chance to do anything and then you'll
[5:44] see the miracles of god right amen
[5:47] praise the Lord hallelujah so Revelation
[5:50] is our strength that's right that's why
[5:52] he said don't think about what you're
[5:54] going to say oh I study the message
[5:57] longer than you I that doesn't mean
[5:59] nothing like that amen because it's all
[6:02] by Revelation that's why a child could
[6:05] could step up here and God could speak
[6:07] for a child amen God just needs a body
[6:11] he doesn't need your knowledge your
[6:13] wisdom God bless you praise
[6:16] God for what man knoweth the things of
[6:20] man save the spirit of man which is in
[6:23] him even so the things of God know no
[6:26] man but the spirit of God God bless you
[6:29] please be
[6:31] seated so it's wonderful to know that
[6:34] God has revealed this unto us and that
[6:37] he uh prepared this and reserved it and
[6:42] now is the season when he's revealing to
[6:45] us but what i' like to uh really get at
[6:49] here is as last Sunday I was speaking
[6:52] about the seed and how Jesus said that
[6:54] he was the corn of beat and it was
[6:57] necessary for him to die and to fall
[7:00] into the ground and if he didn't die and
[7:03] fall into the ground then uh he would
[7:05] abide alone and and like that now Paul
[7:09] is saying if the princes of this world
[7:13] knew they would not crucified the Lord
[7:15] Of Glory in other words God we we serve
[7:19] a god with a plan do you believe that
[7:22] our God is not a random God he just does
[7:26] things wild and like that even when the
[7:29] appears like on the day of Pentecost it
[7:31] appears like it was fin theism but it
[7:34] was not because it was with a
[7:36] plan is that right it was an orderly
[7:39] chaos if I might say that the
[7:41] contradictory terms of course but it's
[7:43] trueth orderly chaos that's brother R
[7:46] said rain doesn't come just like that
[7:48] out of the sky it's got to be ragged
[7:50] Jagged black and booming and then the
[7:52] rain come he said it always looks like
[7:54] confusion going on but in the middle of
[7:56] that God comes on the scene amen so in
[7:59] the same way Jesus in the unveiling of
[8:03] God brother Ben said that Jesus spoke in
[8:06] Parables and the reason why he spoke in
[8:09] Parables was to hide it from the devil
[8:14] and his children but to reveal it to his
[8:19] his own his God God's children that's
[8:22] why he said unto you is given to know
[8:25] the mysteries of the Kingdom to the
[8:28] disciples but onto the Pharisees and
[8:31] sades it is not given it's a par to them
[8:34] it's a mystery to them what's the
[8:36] Revelation to us is that right praise
[8:40] the Lord and here it is he spoke
[8:43] everything in Parables to Blind the
[8:45] devil so he couldn't understand what
[8:47] God's plan was but God's plan was like
[8:51] anything a man's seed or children are in
[8:54] him
[8:56] amen Eve was in Adam
[9:00] the entire human race was back there in
[9:04] Adam you know if you have heard the
[9:07] parable that you may be able to count
[9:10] the seeds of an apple that are in an
[9:13] apple but you can't count how many
[9:15] apples will come out of that one seed
[9:17] right right it's the same thing Jesus
[9:20] was speaking that in a parable that it's
[9:22] necessary for me the corn and wheat The
[9:25] Original Seed to go into the ground so
[9:28] that I can multiply myself but he spoke
[9:30] in the par so the devil they didn't
[9:32] understand and the prince of this world
[9:34] if he knew better he would not that's
[9:36] the worst thing he did was to crucify
[9:37] the Lord Of Glory and to bury a seed you
[9:41] know what you're doing you're not
[9:42] killing it you're already killing the
[9:44] seed when you burier you're actually
[9:46] given a chance to germinate and to live
[9:49] amen and that's exactly what the devil
[9:52] uh tried himself in other words the
[9:55] snake is so vicious that he bit his own
[9:57] tail and and and Christ himself de
[10:00] killed death amen praise God and so here
[10:04] it was that uh if he said we speak the
[10:08] wisdom of God in the mystery uh which
[10:11] God ordained before the world unto our
[10:14] Glory yes that's which none of the
[10:17] princes of this world knew for had they
[10:21] know that they would not have crucify
[10:23] the Lord Of Glory you understand we
[10:26] would have been still locked in him
[10:29] that's right right praise God we would
[10:32] have been locked in him if the devil had
[10:35] not crucified the Lord so when he Cru SP
[10:39] the Lord out of him came the blood the
[10:43] Holy Ghost Amen brother B said the red
[10:46] part fell on the ground and the the
[10:49] spirit part of it you know went off and
[10:51] came back down the de phost Acts chapter
[10:54] 2 came back down upon us but praise the
[10:57] Living God that in another place he says
[11:00] but that blood he said the blood the
[11:04] church is the blood of Christ by the
[11:06] holy spirit being in heart am is that
[11:09] right you recognize when the Bible tells
[11:13] us that life is where in the blood is
[11:18] that right so each one of us is similar
[11:21] to a blood costle of God with the life
[11:24] of God in you dilating and manifesting
[11:27] God's life in you so the life is in the
[11:30] blood of the church is the blood of
[11:32] Christ by the Holy Ghost that's why
[11:34] symbolically when he shed his blood the
[11:36] red part that you could see that part
[11:39] fell on the ground amen r fell on the
[11:41] ground that's where it fell praise God
[11:43] when we are here we are part of this
[11:45] Earth and we are now redeemed Earth
[11:48] Redeemed by the blood of Christ amen
[11:51] redeemed Earth Redeemed by the Precious
[11:54] Blood of the Lord hallelujah I also
[11:58] spoke to you on and then I mentioned how
[12:00] that Jesus
[12:02] himself uh was the Great Seal the Seal
[12:06] of the father for God was in Christ
[12:11] reconciling the world to himself in
[12:14] other words God or the Holy Ghost was
[12:16] locked in Jesus all the fullness was in
[12:19] him so uh it wasn't available to go and
[12:23] for everybody at that time because he
[12:26] had to die first that's the reason why
[12:28] all the prophets all the Patriarchs
[12:30] under the dispensation of Innocence
[12:33] human
[12:34] government law you know Grace right on
[12:37] down to this hour they all had to wait
[12:40] until he was crucified and then when
[12:44] preach of the spirits that were in
[12:46] prison waiting they were waiting by
[12:49] faith according to Hebrews 11 they had
[12:51] to wait by faith before he died they
[12:55] actually believed the Redemption so when
[12:58] he died they he can go into the prison
[13:00] and say San you have no rights over them
[13:02] because they believe unto this blood
[13:05] they believe unto this resurrection and
[13:08] took them out praise God and he took
[13:11] captivity captive and sent back gets
[13:15] onto men amen praise the Lord hallelujah
[13:18] they were captives of the word amen
[13:20] captives of Satan and he made them
[13:22] captives of the word and then he led
[13:24] them back into Glory you'll find that
[13:26] back in the Book of Psalms when he was
[13:28] taking them back and the angel said who
[13:31] he says open up your Everlasting Gates
[13:34] that the Lord Of Glory may come in the
[13:37] angel said who is this Lord Of Glory he
[13:40] says the Lord strong in battle the Lord
[13:43] mighty to
[13:45] save and the gates were open and he led
[13:48] all of those saints that he had taken up
[13:51] right in David was speaking the prophecy
[13:53] of course LED them and took them back so
[13:56] Abraham Isaac all of those prophets of
[13:58] Patriarchs that were there before our
[14:00] time are already in the presence of God
[14:04] and they are waiting on us right is that
[14:07] right but now because he was building up
[14:10] a body through the uh through all these
[14:13] ages amen and the body was is not going
[14:18] to be completed until the head comes
[14:20] back on the body just like in when he
[14:23] was building the physical body of Adam
[14:25] the Bible said Adam was the body was
[14:27] laying on the ground
[14:29] right and and and then when it was
[14:31] complete then God bring with the bread
[14:34] of life right so it's the same way
[14:36] through the ages he was building his
[14:38] body back but not with dirt with Earth
[14:43] men of earth we are the dirt to that God
[14:47] us Amen to build back his body predes
[14:50] you predestinated piece of dirt
[14:53] [Music]
[14:55] brother but that's what we are amen
[14:59] amen uh you see when that blood dropped
[15:02] on the off the cross uh I would no it's
[15:06] farfetched but put it way that's almost
[15:08] like dropping on a predestinated piece
[15:11] of it was predestinated Dr their Calvary
[15:14] couldn't drop anywhere else brother BR
[15:16] said that was the hill Adam di on that
[15:18] was the
[15:19] hill Abraham went and asked him to bury
[15:22] him this what those prophets by
[15:24] Revelation they all almost got Buri in
[15:26] the same place that's right because by
[15:28] Revelation amen they always said take me
[15:31] back take me back don't leave my bones
[15:32] here they want to go back amen the same
[15:35] way praise God so we see that we were
[15:39] all in him and we were locked into him
[15:42] there amen amen so until that seal was
[15:47] broken we could not be made manifest
[15:51] right because we were all in him praise
[15:54] God look it's the same way we were in
[15:57] God's mind because he T about us before
[16:00] the foundations of the world do you
[16:02] believe
[16:03] that praise God you are in the mind of
[16:05] God and when I say mind of God not like
[16:07] a man mind similar but not the same
[16:11] because if you're in God's mind God
[16:13] knows everything about you beginning end
[16:16] every single thing he knows about you
[16:18] right so he knew you as you are before
[16:23] the foundation of the world we were in
[16:25] this
[16:26] mind and like you you think about
[16:29] something after a while you know you
[16:32] going to speak it is that right so we
[16:35] were in this mind then we ended up being
[16:38] in his mouth to be spoken out is that
[16:41] right uh and we spoken out there and in
[16:47] word form uh our representation our
[16:51] theophany release are and so on uh by
[16:54] the spoken word of God Amen just the
[16:57] same way brother said you know when he
[16:59] said let there be light back there he
[17:01] said it's the same light shining now so
[17:03] we don't have a different son the
[17:05] effects of his word is is just gone and
[17:09] it's accomplishing its work and it's
[17:11] going right on through until it goes
[17:13] back to Eternity amen it's the same
[17:15] thing with us so we come out with God's
[17:17] mind uh we were in um his mouth and then
[17:21] we were made revealed praise the Lord
[17:24] with a with natural Adam we were in his
[17:27] loins
[17:29] amen and then we got expressed by the
[17:32] instrumentality of our mothers and we
[17:35] were made manifest here on the earth
[17:38] praise the Lord now actually the word
[17:41] comes into the heart of a minister comes
[17:44] into the heart of a Believer and when
[17:46] comes into the heart of that believer of
[17:49] the heart of that believer becomes
[17:50] pregnated by the invisible Union of the
[17:52] word of
[17:54] God and your soul that believe that word
[17:57] or receive that
[17:59] word then the word produces what a new
[18:02] birth amen it produces a birth amen that
[18:06] invisible Union produces the birth and
[18:08] you were born again again you become
[18:11] what a new creation in Christ amen
[18:15] praise the Lord now your soul changed
[18:19] but your physical body being born in sin
[18:22] he had he just had to redeem do some
[18:25] Redemption Jesus was born in by virgin
[18:27] birth so he didn't need Redemption
[18:30] praise God he didn't sin so he didn't
[18:32] need Redemption but because we were born
[18:34] in sin shap he come to the world
[18:36] speaking Lies We Needed Redemption you
[18:38] believe that praise God hallelujah
[18:41] praise God so we needed Redemption and
[18:44] so what happened see if we had remained
[18:48] in the loins of Christ in the Lord Jesus
[18:51] Christ spiritually his mind his heart if
[18:55] we had remained there we would not have
[18:58] been expressed it's like a man having an
[19:00] idea and he never has the opportunity to
[19:03] to actually create the thing or make it
[19:05] or do what he has in his mind but here
[19:08] it is if the princes of this world
[19:12] knew God's Plan of Redemption they would
[19:16] not have crucified the Lord's of glory
[19:19] amen because instead of having one
[19:21] Messiah he ends up with a whole bunch of
[19:23] Messiah
[19:25] X he ends up with a lot of little all
[19:28] not Jesus's but Christ in one amen
[19:32] anointed by the Holy Spirit to carry out
[19:36] the will and word of God Amen and we are
[19:39] all representation of that word Amen
[19:42] brother Brandon knew his representation
[19:44] was on Malachi 4:5 Revelation 10:7 do
[19:48] you know you're a part of this word am
[19:51] that's right the Holy Spirit has to
[19:53] reveal to you and you alone will know
[19:56] which part of the word you f MH amen
[20:00] that's that is the reason why he hid our
[20:03] names where under the
[20:06] seals because human beings have a habit
[20:10] that no matter where they are Darkest
[20:12] Night Brightest Day when you're in a
[20:15] crowd or you're in Al loone about to
[20:17] come and you heard a voice calling your
[20:18] name Mary or John or
[20:24] James it causes you to turn around
[20:27] that's right is that right you
[20:30] repent from whatever you were doing cuz
[20:33] that's what repent mean repent to means
[20:35] turn around and going the opposite
[20:37] direction from how you were living so
[20:40] your name gets called so you had to hide
[20:43] your names under the seals because we
[20:45] were his children and he didn't want
[20:47] Satan to get at us he didn't want Satan
[20:49] to be able to get at us like that so he
[20:52] hid our name cuz we are especially us
[20:55] here in this last
[20:57] name because we had to wait until the
[21:00] last stage and if he knew who we
[21:05] were before this
[21:07] time you kill your
[21:09] [Music]
[21:11] grandfather you destroy your
[21:14] mother if he knew
[21:17] beforehand whose names were under those
[21:20] seals and that's what I'm talking about
[21:22] briefly tonight the brid names were
[21:25] hidden under the seals amen that's right
[21:28] am if he knew all of that beforeand so
[21:33] true he would have killed your
[21:36] ancestors so that in your path of
[21:39] Life traveling down from Adam through
[21:42] all those thousands of years
[21:46] mysteriously through each one of your
[21:48] ancestors until that germ got here and
[21:52] then you were made manifested he would
[21:55] have cut them off so that you wouldn't
[21:57] get here
[21:59] the devil devil doesn't care about
[22:00] killing millions of people look what
[22:01] he's do in
[22:03] Syria look what he did in Vietnam look
[22:06] what he did to the Jews during the
[22:09] Holocaust he doesn't care about killing
[22:11] millions of people it's trying to cut
[22:13] off the seed of God that's right trying
[22:16] to kill off the effects of the testimony
[22:19] of Jesus Christ that's right and the
[22:21] power of God that dwells within us amen
[22:25] amen praise God because we are
[22:28] predestinated for a purpose that's right
[22:31] amen and he knows the difference we are
[22:34] not serpent seen amen we are we we are
[22:39] the brother said you are not really
[22:42] creatures of time you said you come from
[22:46] God you're going back to God you come
[22:48] from eternity you're going back to
[22:50] Eternity because Eternal being
[22:54] to how can this world hold you this
[22:58] world can't hold you amen praise the
[23:02] Lord do you know you're bigger than your
[23:05] body you're spirit so your body is just
[23:08] a representation so I can oh Glenn is
[23:11] over
[23:13] there but if Glenn had no body I would
[23:16] know Glenn is over
[23:17] there right see praise God I'm using you
[23:21] tonight for Myra
[23:23] brother praise
[23:25] God to God Amen

[26:31] a baby he said I don't even know how I
[26:33] got on the ground amen predestinated for
[26:36] a
[26:37] purpose God have your name hit the seals
[26:42] for his purpose amen listen to the to
[26:45] the word for seal the members of the
[26:48] Bride their names were put in the Lamb's
[26:51] Book of Life
[26:53] before the foundations of the world so
[26:56] you're older than than this Earth and
[26:59] your soul your soul is older than this
[27:02] Earth your names were put on the book of
[27:06] life before excuse me the foundation of
[27:09] the world and if you were in God and you
[27:12] Eternal as God's ET turn you're older
[27:14] than this earth right right praise the
[27:17] Lord amen but it was it was sealed up
[27:23] see God sealed up their names not now
[27:28] it's being revealed whose names were in
[27:32] there
[27:36] am all about it what a great thing is
[27:40] happening now for he's saying that that
[27:44] that's where your names
[27:46] were your names were hidden under the
[27:49] seals but of course in another part of
[27:52] the seals he said I don't mean your name
[27:55] James Susie but
[27:58] your name God's the name that God gave
[28:03] you before the foundations of the world
[28:06] Amen see Jesus his name was what Jehovah
[28:09] Elohim but brother said when he came to
[28:12] the Earth as the word made flesh God
[28:16] allowed uh Joseph and Mary to give him
[28:19] an Earthly name and that Earthly name
[28:23] was Jesus your Earthly name is whatever
[28:26] it is
[28:28] but then you're going to get back your
[28:29] name you going to recognize your by then
[28:32] you will call it a new name praise God
[28:35] you you will recognize who you are and
[28:37] your new name is a part of the word and
[28:40] when uh a preacher preaches that part of
[28:46] the word that your name is represented
[28:50] by or is
[28:51] on even you're not hearing us we use the
[28:55] word name you're thinking of a natural
[28:57] name but one the person speaks that part
[29:00] of the word that fits your character
[29:03] because name nature character and so on
[29:06] I'm not teaching on that but the fact is
[29:09] the preacher is preaching he's preaching
[29:10] on the word and he might not even know
[29:12] what where what's happening but your
[29:15] name is under certain scripture it hits
[29:17] your
[29:17] heart certain Revelation is under that
[29:20] word it hits your soul the Deep calls to
[29:25] the Deep amen and then the Deep has to
[29:27] respond am why because you a part of the
[29:31] word and when that part of the word it
[29:33] fits your soul like a hand in a GL am
[29:38] amen that's not a man amen that's God
[29:42] doing that praise God God does that so
[29:46] our names were hid beneath the seals
[29:50] amen now we know that the people whose
[29:54] names were not under those seals that
[29:57] wouldn't catch the revelation of it
[29:59] truly they will be
[30:02] deceived they will be deceived because
[30:05] they have no
[30:07] Anor your
[30:09] name is written in the last book of life
[30:13] and you're anchored in the kingdom of
[30:15] God Amen you have Blessed Assurance
[30:19] that's right see I'm pulling you away
[30:21] from the Pentecost believe it you have
[30:23] bless the chance because you believe you
[30:25] know I believe in Jesus I'm believing
[30:28] but you have Blessed Assurance because
[30:30] we have an anchor that keeps our soul
[30:34] what is that anchor the foundation stone
[30:38] the word in in Daniel 7th week he says
[30:41] is been laid in you before the
[30:43] foundations of the world that's right
[30:45] predestination amen the foundation stone
[30:49] so your anchor Ru is Christ amen the
[30:53] ancher is your ho is the Holy
[30:55] Ghost it's the Holy Ghost keeping yes
[30:58] sir Grace greater than all our sins
[31:02] that's right amen his grace is what
[31:04] keeps
[31:05] usen not by our strength not by our own
[31:09] wisdom not by any length of time we'
[31:12] been in the message no man could boast
[31:15] amen we are kept by the power of God
[31:18] through faith reah amen that's what
[31:21] we're kept by the part of God true Faith
[31:24] amen praise the Lord so listen what he
[31:28] says here in uh the first seene page 172
[31:31] and the Bible says that the he the devil
[31:35] deceived all he said a l l upon the face
[31:39] of the Earth whose names were not
[31:42] written under
[31:45] themselves amen from the foundation of
[31:48] the world now if the Bible said he did
[31:52] he did it he hid them names under those
[31:56] seals praise the Lord glory to God
[31:59] hallelujah oh my aren't you glad that
[32:01] the seals are
[32:03] broken he was the Seal of the father and
[32:06] that had to be broken so the Holy Spirit
[32:08] could be made manifest and we could be
[32:10] made manifest amen glory to God and the
[32:14] last day these seals are broken to make
[32:18] what the word of God made manifest but
[32:22] it's not just a written word you are the
[32:24] word you are the unveiling of the mighty
[32:27] today it's God in flesh again not in
[32:31] Jesus but in his bride and you are the
[32:35] flesh is living in for this hour that's
[32:38] why we live holy that's why we live
[32:40] consecrated that's why we live according
[32:42] to the word of the hour not because the
[32:46] not just because the Bible is telling us
[32:48] it but because it's now in our heart and
[32:51] we want to do it amen we want to do it
[32:55] because we love him amen you know what
[32:57] that means it's putting you back on free
[33:01] moral agency where the Prophet said they
[33:04] can
[33:05] s when Adam and Eve were on free moreal
[33:08] agency they were Sons son and daughter
[33:10] of God Amen and they could sin or not
[33:14] sin praise God because they were already
[33:18] on free moral agency and just as that
[33:21] Eve had to be tested by The Serpent and
[33:23] that one fell he said this last day one
[33:27] will be tested also San this verion
[33:29] finding that will be tested also by
[33:33] Satan face to face speaking through man
[33:36] that's many the theologians false
[33:38] teachers you know even preachers of the
[33:41] message that will misdirect you uh you
[33:44] will by Revelation and by discernment
[33:47] will recognize that amen praise God not
[33:50] by comparing scripture with scripture
[33:52] that that's not enough just by compare
[33:54] comparing scripture with scripture that
[33:56] that just means that somebody has a
[33:58] sharper mind than the other one or one
[34:00] can quote the Scripture A little better
[34:02] that don't mean nothing he said one re
[34:04] genuine Revelations of that old wased
[34:06] woman will take her home glory to God
[34:08] Amen because the veil is ripped now and
[34:11] she's entered Beyond the Veil and will
[34:13] walk into the presence of almighty God
[34:15] hallelujah amen praise God no yes so
[34:19] some people are going to be
[34:21] deceived but the devil is going to at
[34:24] least make try to deceive the elected M
[34:27] but the Bible tells us
[34:29] impossible Hallelujah words not the
[34:33] elected can only be temporarily thr off
[34:36] of
[34:36] course right the devil can divert you
[34:39] into a Catholic
[34:41] Church divert you into the Methodist
[34:44] divert you into the Baptist Church but
[34:46] that's only for a while because there's
[34:49] a hunger that's going to be there that
[34:50] thirst that he cannot fulfill only the
[34:54] word of God can fulfill I mean the
[34:56] revealed word not just the Bible but to
[34:59] reveal word is the only thing that can
[35:01] fulfill because you have a thirst for
[35:04] God himself praise the Lord and you
[35:07] going be seek and search him amen
[35:10] hallelujah praise God oh my like all
[35:13] prophets of all they watered in sheep
[35:14] skins and goat skins from place to place
[35:17] he said searching for a city where a
[35:20] city of rest a place where they can rest
[35:22] in the same way you might have been
[35:23] Church to church been here you've been
[35:26] there what you searching for your soul
[35:28] was actually searching for the revealed
[35:30] word of God that it can find a resting
[35:34] place the Bible says that th SPS have
[35:37] made the the alar they rest upon thy
[35:41] altar the res in place upon thy altar oh
[35:44] God hallelujah amen let me stand upon
[35:47] the promises of
[35:49] Christ let me let me say like the Saints
[35:52] in heaven when the brother BR said but
[35:55] but I preach what all priest they said
[35:58] we are resting on
[36:00] that amen praise God on Christ the solid
[36:05] rock I stand all other ground the S sand
[36:10] amen oh Hallelujah when all around my
[36:14] soul gives way he then is all my
[36:17] strength and St all Christ is stand all
[36:21] on the ground is sinking s hall
[36:25] hallelujah amen praise God Hallelujah
[36:30] the seals are open he said and he says
[36:33] now the spirit is calling out the names
[36:37] of the elect in the church H book he
[36:40] says he's the great Shepherd is now
[36:43] calling his Sheep amen calling them even
[36:48] though are changing their ARS of their
[36:51] body even though they have not fallen
[36:54] asleep glory to God Hallelujah can you
[36:58] hear your brother calling at supper time
[37:01] come home come home it's time for the
[37:04] wedd supper of the lamb praise
[37:07] God hallelujah oh I remember when I I go
[37:12] back it's so wonderful when I was a boy
[37:14] in childhood and and and supper would be
[37:17] ready we' be playing we be doing this
[37:19] and and your mother would just give a
[37:22] let me use the Common Place word a
[37:24] holler out of the kitchen window
[37:27] you you you drop whatever you're doing
[37:29] and rush and try to wash up and get in
[37:32] there so that you can dive into those
[37:35] homemade chops or meat or whatever fish
[37:39] or whatever she prepare it was just
[37:41] wonderful praise God hallelujah and it's
[37:44] so funny it tasted sweeter
[37:48] than now I can afford to buy any meat
[37:50] any fish I want but the fish that she
[37:53] cooked back then tast sweeter I like
[37:58] your mother's cooking and baking is that
[38:00] right it's so different that's the way
[38:02] God made us praise God and it's the same
[38:06] thing there's a difference between the
[38:08] Theologian preaching and and God's
[38:11] cooking God's word God's meals God's
[38:15] food is that right and one day we're
[38:18] going to have that great chef is going
[38:20] to serve us up a seven course meal amen
[38:23] praise God is that right I think he's
[38:25] serving it already that's right amen
[38:27] seven course meal praise God prepared by
[38:30] the hand of God himself because this was
[38:33] all prepared before the foundation of
[38:34] the world and prepared for you praise
[38:37] God just I'm going to use the last quot
[38:39] and then I'm going to start wiing this
[38:41] up or else we're going to go off into a
[38:43] major uh preaching message here now now
[38:47] he says I am thinking of that awful hour
[38:50] that is
[38:51] approaching and there is no more way to
[38:54] stop it it is predicted that if would
[38:57] come but of course I know that you have
[38:59] said that they wouldn't so they would
[39:03] but there is something that have there
[39:05] are some people that have got their
[39:08] names already written on the land's Book
[39:12] of
[39:13] Life and when them seals are thrown
[39:18] open there they'll begin to see their
[39:23] names there praise God are you starting
[39:26] to see your name in there amen oh praise
[39:29] God see means understand that's what it
[39:33] means it don't means you're going with
[39:34] your eyes but you begin to understand
[39:37] praise God if said see see I means see
[39:40] what see what I mean see because he want
[39:43] the person to understand so that's what
[39:46] the scripture is telling you here they
[39:48] will see or understand that their names
[39:51] were him under those SS praise God I'm
[39:55] going to preach for more from another
[39:57] angle on this because the breaking of
[39:59] the seals identifies you and give you
[40:01] certainty of who you are
[40:05] because if you were not part of the
[40:08] Bride then you wouldn't have a clear
[40:10] Revelation right of seeing the word made
[40:13] flesh or revealed to you like that so
[40:15] the word identifies
[40:17] you you identify the word and the word
[40:20] identifies remember John the Baptist in
[40:23] Jesus amen Jesus was coming down to
[40:26] wanted to be baptized Behold the Lamb of
[40:29] God that take away the sins of the world
[40:32] what did he do he identified the word of
[40:35] the hour because he was what he was the
[40:39] predestinated prophet that had to be
[40:42] there to identify that word is that
[40:45] right what a prophet a predestinated
[40:47] body that God works through praise the
[40:50] Lord hallelujah but at the same time the
[40:53] Bible that
[40:54] prophesied um uh that one crying in the
[40:58] wilderness preparing the way of the Lord
[41:00] hallelujah so when he said Behold the
[41:03] Lamb of God that taken away the sins of
[41:05] the world he identified the word but the
[41:08] word that was written also identified
[41:11] him amen amen right so when you receive
[41:16] the word of the hour by
[41:19] Revelation Hallelujah you identifying it
[41:23] that that's the truth I believe it
[41:25] praise God that's the word that's the L
[41:30] will take away my this is the message
[41:32] without spot or wrinkle I receive it in
[41:35] the name of Jesus when you do that it
[41:38] also identifies your bride that's right
[41:41] Hallelujah is that right amen it
[41:43] identifies you as bride because you then
[41:47] become the body just like John was the
[41:50] body predestinated to be there to
[41:52] recognize the word when it came on the
[41:55] scene Hallelujah you was predestinated
[41:57] to be in this age to identify the word
[42:00] for your hour to recognize your day and
[42:04] the word for your day Hallelujah and say
[42:07] recognize it th say the Lord I believe
[42:10] all my heart glory to hallelujah amen
[42:13] praise God hallelujah amen when them
[42:17] seals are thrown open there they begin
[42:21] to see their names there and the Holy
[42:24] Spirit speaks to them then and they
[42:28] come you just can't keep them away
[42:32] anymore no one can and he repeats again
[42:36] no one can once they see it no one can
[42:42] praise God because they recognize who
[42:45] they are brother BR himself said that
[42:48] when when the seals broke to him and you
[42:51] understood it he said I recognized that
[42:54] I was not really the son of Charles and
[42:58] ELR it was just his Earthly
[43:01] parents but my Father in Heaven oh
[43:04] Jehovah God I am your son I'm coming
[43:07] home to thee glory to God hallelujah you
[43:10] recognize that your heavenly father you
[43:13] are a spirit being and your father in
[43:16] Heaven is the god of Heaven the god of
[43:19] the
[43:19] universe amen hallelujah oh my no one
[43:25] can keep them way they are coming anyhow
[43:29] and they are coming because you are the
[43:32] one that's leading them second seal page
[43:35] 224 God LED you here tonight amen is

[44:25] Amen admit that maybe you came to church
[44:27] a little tired after work but it's truth
[44:31] it's the truth we just flesh and we just
[44:33] here to worship and serve the Lord I am
[44:36] trusting oh
[44:38] God that I am one of them that's going
[44:41] to find my name here tonight behind this
