[21:36] 51 the day following
[21:40] Jesus okay maybe we can start from
[21:44] uh let's start from 41 then we can
[21:47] understand the story he first founded
[21:50] his own brother Simon and said unto him
[21:53] we have found the
[21:56] Messiah which is being in interpreted
[21:59] the Christ he brought him to Jesus and
[22:03] when Jesus beheld him he said thou are
[22:07] Simon the son of Jonah thou shall be
[22:10] called
[22:11] cifas which is by interpretation a stone
[22:16] and the day following Jesus would go
[22:18] forth to into Galilee and founded filth
[22:23] and said unto him follow me that will be
[22:26] my subject follow me and Philip was in
[22:31] basda and the City of Andrew and Peter
[22:35] Philip founded Nathaniel and said unto
[22:38] him we have found
[22:41] him whom the whom Moses in the law and
[22:47] the prophet did right Jesus of Nazareth
[22:51] the son of
[22:53] Joseph and Nathaniel said unto him can
[22:58] can there any good thing come out from
[23:01] Nazareth Philip said unto him come and
[23:06] see Jesus saw naani coming to him and
[23:10] said unto him behold an Israelite indeed
[23:14] whom is no guy natanian said unto him
[23:19] where knowest thou me Jesus answered and
[23:23] and said unto him
[23:25] before that F called the when thou was
[23:29] under the F tree I saw thee n answered
[23:34] and said unto him
[23:35] brabi Thou Art the Son of God Thou Art
[23:39] the king of Israel Jesus answered and
[23:42] said unto him because I said unto thee I
[23:47] saw thee under the victory beloved D
[23:52] thou thou shall see greater things than
[23:56] these and he said unto to him very very
[24:00] I say unto you Hereafter you shall see
[24:04] Heaven open and the angels of God
[24:08] ascending and descending upon the son of
[24:12] man may the Lord add his breing unto his
[24:15] you may be seated Hallelujah blessed be
[24:18] the name of the Lord before we we start
[24:21] I'm going to give you a little bit about
[24:24] the the trip of Africa
[24:30] I went to Africa for my brother
[24:34] funeral and you know as a a minister you
[24:37] cannot go anywhere say I'm going
[24:41] just
[24:43] do your
[24:45] own your own project or your own thing
[24:49] God is always with you he is the leader
[24:53] wherever he leads you you will go my
[24:57] heart I thought I was thinking when I
[25:00] landed
[25:01] Acra I will go and minister
[25:04] to a certain place but the Lord did not
[25:08] allow me so I
[25:11] stopped and I went to I went to Kumasi
[25:15] the following day for the preparation
[25:18] for the funeral and the things that I
[25:21] need to do I'm doing a little project
[25:24] over there at a at some place so I just
[25:27] went to see those those places there and
[25:29] everything was going well I thank God
[25:32] for that and I encourage anybody if the
[25:35] Lord prays in your heart to to to put
[25:38] your money in use you got to use it one
[25:42] day you're going to benefit for that so
[25:45] that's where that's what I'm doing if I
[25:47] have a letter I always like to put
[25:49] somewhere in the future you're going to
[25:53] yell you going to yell where you were
[25:56] not thinking that you're going to have
[25:58] have something by the time you know God
[26:00] make it increase and you're going to
[26:02] benefit from that you and your family so
[26:06] it's very very important that in Canada
[26:09] here is very tough for you to save money
[26:12] in the bank but if you can do something
[26:15] somewhere do it brother Abraham said if
[26:19] you are working
[26:20] work whatever you doing doing but you
[26:24] have to be ready whenever he comes
[26:27] you're ready to go
[26:28] we don't know when the rer come so you
[26:30] cannot sit down there oh rer is coming
[26:33] so I'm not doing nothing what I get I
[26:35] eat no it doesn't work like that so I'm
[26:38] just doing a little project I went there
[26:40] and check it out and it's it's coming
[26:42] out good I thank God for that amen and
[26:46] then I I went to that after that Sunday

[26:54] bran there and it was a very wonderful
[26:59] uh meeting we had over there was great

[27:07] the funeral was taking place and we did
[27:10] everything and everything was
[27:13] fantastic we have a wonderful weather
[27:17] everybody cry a little bit because we
[27:19] miss him that was my big brother so that
[27:23] is part of the game when you miss

[27:29] was very very very very missing cuz he
[27:31] is the one who raised me up I'm number
[27:34] seven he's number two so he's bigger
[27:37] than me way bigger than me he used to
[27:39] just straighten me up with his stick and
[27:42] hands and everything so I do really
[27:44] appreciated him and the same brother
[27:47] that me and brother kfy and brother F
[27:49] went and we pray for him when he had his
[27:51] three Strokes I think two strokes and

[45:30] churches this gospel start from the
[45:34] beginning in the day of Pentecost when
[45:37] they came out there was no fear you know

[1:16:06] he was really a real servant of
[1:16:08] Christ there's a certain old negro
[1:16:12] sister that came to the church and she
[1:16:15] was filled with the Holy Ghost and such
[1:16:16] a great character she
[1:16:18] was and she had a husband he was a good
[1:16:22] old fell his name was the called him
[1:16:25] Gabriel we just called him Gabe for
[1:16:28] short and so we can never get him to
[1:16:30] line up at the church he he just didn't
[1:16:32] want to come to church he said that all
[1:16:35] the boys down around the pool room where
[1:16:36] he hung out said that's a bunch of holy
[1:16:38] rollers and nothing to
[1:16:42] him and the only thing Gabe had to do
[1:16:44] was on Sunday morning get his pool queue
[1:16:46] and go down to the pool room or
[1:16:48] something and gr around the boys but his
[1:16:51] wife was a real devout saint
[1:16:54] and she'd go to the church and she'd
[1:16:57] pray and have the pastor and all to pray
[1:16:59] for Gabe because it really down his
[1:17:01] heart he was a good man and he run a
[1:17:03] little business down there a little on
[1:17:05] the corner little shoe shine business
[1:17:08] and shine shoes get enough money and
[1:17:11] play pool while he went to play pool so
[1:17:14] he just didn't want to line up with the
[1:17:17] gospel and the pastor old Gabe liked to
[1:17:20] hunt a lot so the pastor was a hunter
[1:17:22] too so he'd take Gabe and go hunting
[1:17:26] so one day after a all day tramping
[1:17:29] through the the Wilderness and the sloes
[1:17:32] is on the road home that afternoon and
[1:17:35] and they had so much gain they could
[1:17:37] just barely tote it had the rabbits and
[1:17:41] the birds all over them going along and
[1:17:44] they come around an old familiar path as
[1:17:47] they come up come up top of the hill and
[1:17:48] they went down into the little city down
[1:17:51] there is on
[1:17:53] Saturday and the sun was going
[1:17:56] down and the pastor haded to look around
[1:17:59] he hadn't heard old Gabe say nothing for
[1:18:01] quite a while and he watched around and
[1:18:03] Gabe was looking over his shoulders
[1:18:04] towards the the sun setting as it was
[1:18:07] going across the Western
[1:18:09] Horizon and the pastor looked back and
[1:18:12] he noticed Gabe wasn't standing him
[1:18:13] looking back as he walked and so the
[1:18:16] pastor walked on for a few minutes and
[1:18:18] after while a big black hand laid on his
[1:18:22] shoulder and when he turned and chist
[1:18:26] old Gabe was looking him in the face
[1:18:28] with tears running down his cheeks
[1:18:30] dripping off like
[1:18:33] his he says
[1:18:35] Pastor in the
[1:18:37] morning use G to find me right up there
[1:18:40] at that morning's bench so then I was
[1:18:43] coming right back from there and take a
[1:18:45] seat to the side of my faithful wife and
[1:18:48] that is going to remain in that church
[1:18:51] until God calls me home
[1:18:55] and the pastor of course turned around
[1:18:57] in amazement he said Gabe I wanted and
[1:19:01] waited and long and prayed for
[1:19:04] years for
[1:19:07] this he said
[1:19:09] gab is it sett he said yes Pastor settle
[1:19:13] but I want that Holy Ghost
[1:19:15] too and I was coming up the morning as B
[1:19:17] in the morning and I was going to get it
[1:19:20] or I was going to die right
[1:19:22] there he said Gabe
