[1:12] with the Jews and all that so there's so
[1:15] much going on spiritually if you have
[1:18] the eyes to see and the ears to hear
[1:20] well for today we want to have the
[1:25] Lord's Supper and how many knows that
[1:30] sometimes it's not easy to keep up with
[1:33] your schedule right it's not very it's
[1:37] not easy to really keep up with that it
[1:40] becomes harder and harder every day as
[1:45] you know what I bring dr. Luke sharper
[1:49] sharper the word body whose
[1:53] evening and desserts and everything else
[1:56] and so I take the Lord for that but I

[2:03] track Danny here somebody that's helping
[2:11] me in terms of having a digital
[2:13] character out there filling in certain
[2:17] things that I might not remember I've
[2:20] had a waiter up where he is you can fill
[2:23] that in and I hope when I turned my

[2:27] coming up lately the use there's coming
[2:30] up this might end up over there so
[2:32] praise God for breath and he serving

[35:59] especially our praise to God for
[36:01] evermore Alleluia amen yes sir in the so
[36:05] here now that we were entering into a
[36:08] new world after this crucifixion and
[36:13] this great resurrection so we're not
[36:16] living in church legalistic rules fear
[36:34] that we take it the word revelation that
[36:46] is building the people thing is pretty
[36:49] sturdy living in the yes sir and now
[36:53] we're happy that we're living in a in a
[36:56] world where grace happens every day
[36:59] grace will be in a state of bridge
[37:02] that's happening to us every single day
[37:06] praise God because I can just stick
[37:08] around I can forgive me Lord
[37:10] grace I can just react to the wrong way
[37:15] Oh grace we're living in that area
[37:25] that wonderful state of gods Greece amen
[37:28] hallelujah and a plan that is happily
[37:31] with a regular basis the whole watch of
[37:33] men and women who see the word clearly
[37:35] and believe the Word of God for this
[37:38] great power even raced up a middle path
[37:41] of fighting this up we have to remember
[37:44] that sin that safe at that same table
[37:48] when he said remember Jesus that he said
[37:52] the one who hands that the betray me is
[37:55] at the same thing as price so we have to
[38:00] be living so carefully amen
[38:04] that we don't be part of the spirit of
[38:10] truth that would betray the Lord amen a
[38:16] remember this betrayal is one of the
[38:20] things that is mentioned in all four
[38:23] Gospels usually one will have something
[38:27] for the other one may not have it the
[38:30] next one happened to the other may not
[38:31] have it you know but in this case this
[38:34] betrayals mentioned it all and so from
[38:38] that time he said to remember he has be
[38:46] personally but remember how easy it is
[38:50] to be thinking that he really was gonna
[39:04] lose Jesus or Jesus
[39:11] [Music]
[39:19] [Music]
[39:39] [Music]

[41:42] pray communion meditation will remain
[41:47] within your hearts our gracious God
[41:51] every father we thank you for these
[41:54] thoughts we shared the believersí of the
[41:56] day we pray in the name of Jesus the
[42:00] somewhere even plot from what life one
[42:04] part of it was staying in the minds and
[42:07] hearts of each believer as they need
[42:11] some part of the spiritual food it will
[42:16] sustain them in the day of trouble from
[42:19] protect and keep them in this hour
[42:24] we asked in the name of Jesus
[42:26] the musicians come in this we prepare
[42:30] ourselves to take the Lord's Supper amen
[42:34] how now a lot of these denomination
[42:43] things remember Jesus remember the Lord
[42:51] in remembrance of me letting up for the
[42:55] Lord suffered important I think if you
[42:58] didn't have to remember the details in
[43:00] the science and the crucifixion even
[43:02] true surely be remember that but they're
[43:05] emphasizing that but we are about two
[43:09] people and that our revelation is
[43:13] rapture in faith or rupturing revelation
[43:17] for this hour so they were looking to
[43:21] the crucifixion but we are looking to
[43:23] the rapture yet now to here so let me
[43:27] come together for the bark supper yes we
[43:30] know he died for us
[43:32] we're watching for the great
[43:35] resurrection and rapture that is to come

[45:37] [Music]
[46:00] [Music]
[46:17] Oh
[46:28] picture his bottom I suppose would you
[46:31] ask the Lord to wash just sensibly and
[46:35] say that you was a year apart might
[46:39] whether it were thought are indeed ask
[46:44] the Lord to bless you according to the
[46:46] scriptures
[46:47] 1st Corinthians 11:28 but lift a man or
[46:52] woman examine him for herself so let
[46:56] them eat of that bread and drink of that
[46:59] Cup for they eat and drink are hardly
[47:03] eaten drink damnation to themselves not
[47:08] discerning the Lord's body
[47:11] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[47:14] among you and many sleep but if we judge
[47:18] ourselves we will not be just but when
[47:22] you want judged we are chastened of the
[47:24] Lord and we should not be compared with
[47:27] the world therefore my brethren with
[47:30] something
