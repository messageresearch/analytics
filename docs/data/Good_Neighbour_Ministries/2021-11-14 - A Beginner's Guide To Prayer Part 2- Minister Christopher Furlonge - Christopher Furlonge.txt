lord i said praise the lord our god is good god in action god is so good yes you all knew that my mommy was dead and me and my wife traveled october 14 12 to go and bury her but the most important when i was going in my heart was to it's a chance for me to go preach the gospel get somebody to christ when i read there on the 13th by god's help the next day alex which is a unless we know a less for a long time pastor simon knew him philip desmond everybody that has gone to ghana from good neighbor ministry no alex he'd been baptized i baptize him in the name of the lord and savior jesus christ and he's on the way so he took me he says brother once you are here we have to go to street ministry whereby i stand on the street and preach you have a little group that is raising so i went with him in the morning preached on repentance baptizing jesus name and things after that he took me to a place where there's seamstress they saw clothing and things he wanted me to minister the brother philippa's minister over there so i went there brought the word of god the people were blessed the anointing of god was right there why i came out from the place after i finished i getting out from the building i saw a man that had stroke passing the anointing was upon me the holy spirit says go and pray for him i asked him do you believe that jesus christ is the one true god he says yes i said then i the lord can help you i lay my hands on him pray for him then me and alex went and brought my wife from hotel relaxing for the evening service so in the evening service that was our last church the lord lay on my heart i preached the message right there about 10 people wanted to get baptized so i told them okay you're gonna get baptized i went with my wife the next day friday with alex to go to my village to do my mommy sell money things pay for everything i had the money with me while we were going he forgot to put the radiator water in the radiator the car was on smoke on the way it was getting to evening so i bought my head all the money is with me about my head and i pray to the lord i said lord your servant need help and as soon as i lift up my eye i saw a man sitting on the motorbike coming he came help us everything was done we reached our home my village eight o'clock we slept there the next day i have to come with my wife to the city again because sunday i have to preach far less i came back preached sunday so then 10 people that wanted to be baptized another four was sorry trey was added from the tailoring shop the seamstress shop so we go baptizing them in the water when we read there there was so many crowds different churches wanted to baptize their people but i don't care bosses and every so many groups so i went to the water expressing the word of god to the people began to baptize in them while i was baptizing them i felt to tell them hey jesus is the only way jesus is the one true god you have to baptize in his name heaven and head there's no name whereby we must be saved they believe like that baptizing the power of god just me and are less on the water the power of god was right in the water there touching the people as soon as they get out they're screaming crying one lady big lady that fall on the ground crying crying she get up then all of a sudden speaking in tongues the power of god was upon her and god began to say it's me that is doing that i'm calling all of you come out and the prophecy was going forth like that i was still baptizing the people and the denomination two were baptizing their people i didn't know that it was they were baptizing father son holy ghost and i was screaming and telling them to baptize in jesus name why i didn't know my wife was standing there even he recorded some a little bit for speaking my language both english and whichever way the lord is deleting on the word of god because god understands all languages as this one said so while we were there there's a rich man pastor someone and i friend a wealthy man in the country and i went and visited him and while visiting me says when i was going he says let's pray i bow my head with him pray for him told him about my mommy he says i'm coming i have about six minutes i'm checking the time and why he told me he will come to the phone so i was thinking maybe he won't come because he's too rich and powerful so in terms of financial distance so during the day of my mom she was coming and big brother and i saw him sitting down there he turned to my brother he says do you realize what person you have in your the family he turned to my big brother he says let me tell you through this your brother i am becoming a christian he already told me he started going to church and i told him i says the broadway churches jesus is not there jesus was born where she was born so when you go into jesus you have to close your eyes because that place think all your clothes gonna be stink stink like sheep so that's where you find jesus and oh i said so many things i preached to him very hard so he turned to my brother and says let me tell you sick person they are born into a family one in a season and he says because of him i believe i will become a strong christian for the lord of the word of god and it was powerful to me it wasn't joke i go my mommy ceremony was going on that time they called me to the top the priest set me beside him big church almost closed like this why was there a preach finish he gave me a chance to speak and i speak for about three four minutes and when i spoke after we finished there were two young boys sitting in the church they come back to me outside they says what you spoke touch my heart i was even crying first time i was crying i don't know but the power you have i need some and i says okay meet me at the funeral ceremony things so i sneak in from the funeral and go and witness to them give them to our list so many things my cousin we go there while we were there the power of god shook him drinker he was crying crying like that i left it there we came to our crowd and i minister for a less again while i was ministering a girl came very nice girl came on the church that day first time not knowing she is a muslim after the service he come to me he says you know what preacher you spoke everything you spoke was about me and he says after you finish there was a christian song that come on my heart so strong i didn't know whether when i get up and sing you guys gonna accept me or don't accept me because i'm i came from muslim and i says you need to repent baptizing jesus name he says i'm ready [Applause] hallelujah the next day i met a girl baptized the girl in jesus name she gave a heart to christ 14 baptized preached on brother daniel church who has preached here before he allowed me to preach oh the testimonies his wife the congregation they were so blessed the power of god i'm trying to rush things because few minutes are finished then i went to michael who have about half of this church size some brothers philip desmond pastor simon sister simon we all know him which this good neighbor has helped him build the church and his the brother is doing fantastic my wife is even eyewitness is now building a big check maybe that size he's gonna build will be like this our church he's doing good and the power of god even to a point the king is subjecting to the word one from the king family has baptized and is a believer those that used to trouble him concerning the land the lord has get hold of them and god is moving i preached there after i finished the lord put in my heart called altar for the people i called three people came left up in front of me and i say you have you repent and baptize in jesus name that says no i says you need to do that it says i'm ready and that time we were about to come so i could not do it i told i turned them to the pastor michael when i'm here i call pastor michael says they are baptized so to gather all of it is 17 that has got baptized god has greater glory so that was the trip everything went smooth i want to thank the lord for that listen if you are sitting right here under this ministry you are bigger than what you think you are bigger than what you think don't estimate yourself because god the book of acts pastor simon is preaching out from his bottom heart to us and the holy spirit is moving punch yourself in don't think you cannot do it you can god says with god you can look at me i am not big educated or something but let me tell you i don't care about that god once i open my mouth i believe what brother brown preached i believe what pastor someone preached it does the work it does the work god didn't ask us to understand but he asked us to believe so let us believe [Applause] [Music] amen thank you [Music]

musicians be seated praise god you all can be seated just for a moment amen are you enjoying these studies that we having amen truly it's it's been a blessing amen to each and every one of our hearts and even to those that are out there amen out in streaming land on youtube hallelujah amen it's just a little bit of ring up here and praise god amen so it's my love to be with you today amen hallelujah man not coming here with any eloquence anything of my own amen but i just pray that the lord will speak to your hearts today if you come expecting you shall go rejoicing and receiving men hallelujah that's it's what's all about amen we care to praise the lord to lift up his name amen and to receive life today amen amen because the word of god it's life amen hallelujah and we like to continue in our little study that we're doing this is part two amen a beginner's guide to pray amen and as we started off on the last time right i just want to recap a little bit amen and but before we do that let's pray it's all about pray amen let us bow our hearts amen you can stand amen praise god hallelujah our gracious god and eternal heavenly father lord we approach a throne of grace and mercy by the way of pray that you have instructed us lord father and as we have learned may you teach us how to pray lord father lord jesus we thank you lord for your many many blessings lord father that we can be in your house today lord assemble together lord to hear from you lord not to listen to some man but to hear your voice speaking to our hearts lord forgive us for all our shortcomings lord father may you father take full control of this service may you oh god just come down in a mighty way lord and speak to your children lord father move us out of the way lord and let your voice be heard lord father lord we thank you again for your saints for your children those that are present here those that are listening out there lord may you bless them to lord father lord as you con as we continue to lift up your name in praise and worship and thanksgiving bless the reading of your word lord and may you take all the praise the honor and glory in jesus name we pray amen and our theme for our 40 days of prayer amen was taken from james 4 and 2 amen you don't have to turn to it but if you would like to very short i think it's seven words you do not have because you do not ask amen hallelujah you do not have because you do not have so god is instructing us to ask that we should have amen you all may be seated may god bless this world today amen we can go to slide two and i'd like to take a little reading from our prophet amen which is the word of god for our for us today and he's instructing us and i tell you don't let the world creep into you and what is the world worldliness so it's instructing us don't let worldliness creep into us amen don't let the world get into your churches pray it out fast it out until god comes down and take hold that's right keep the joy of the lord among the saints keep them prayed up and guard every little place now if noah seen a leak in his ark why he put some pitch in it and so that's about the best thing i know to keep the leak out amen keep the world out man it's to stop up the leak the best thing that i know how to do the only way to do it that is prayer so you got to fortify yourself with amen and that's what it's all about man the greatest stool the greatest weapon that the lord could have ever given us is so why don't we pray pray pray hallelujah bless us be his name prayer stops leak so if your oil is leaking out amen you got to start praying amen to fill back your lamp with oil amen hallelujah to keep your light burning hallelujah to keep the holy spirit brilliant in your life glowing in your life is to pray pray pray hallelujah prayer changes things amen amen hallelujah blessed be his name and i just want to continue a little further on what he was saying it breaks my heart to see you letting the world reach into you the way it's going amen so don't do it no more snap out of it pray proud of it and let god come back and take over amen take over your life amen the things that are obstructing you hallelujah amen submit yourself to god and get the old-fashioned blessings back amen so if you want an old-fashioned holy ghost amen revival in your life you need to pray amen to bring back the blessings in hallelujah praise be to the living god hallelujah the whole pentecostal world if they do let dong you don't let them you don't let up you don't give up hallelujah praise god amen live right and i want to disassociate yourself with god on his people what he's saying he say associate yourself assemble yourself get together with god and god's people man some people want to disassociate themselves with the things of the lord this will see i said themselves with god people when you're caught your connection with god and god's people you shall surely die you're going to fade away and then you want to know why trouble is coming in your life why this is happening why that is happening praise god brother tom bless you welcome i'm hearing us a familiar voice there amen hallelujah welcome thank you lord no matter what your neighbor does and how good she is what that fellow does don't associate yourself with unbelief hallelujah it leap right out of you what's going to leap right off you the holy ghost god's spirit amen if you're if you associate yourself with unbelief amen god's spirit is going to leave you hallelujah thank you lord jesus praise god and the spirit of god is warning say come out from amongst them my people and be not partakers of their plague their unbelief men they're going to pull you away they're going to draw you away from god's presence hallelujah man thank you lord jesus hallelujah so the last time we spoke about amen we could you go to the the other slide please thank you hallelujah okay we we we just want to conti we spoke about we are wired to pray amen amen so in every human being just want to recap a little bit amen we spoke about amen we are wired to pray so in every human being there is a desire to pray amen in some form or the other you know everybody prays the muslim praise the hindu all religions oh they'd have some form of prayer and worship amen hallelujah thank my brother hallelujah there's an internal desire into every human heart to pray in some form or the other because we were created in the image of god man to have that if there is a desire for us to project that deep inside of us calling to that deep amen so just got that deep to respond there is a god out there to respond to that desire that we have in our lives in our heart amen hallelujah and then we learn that we are not good at pray we don't know what to say amen we don't know how to say it you know we we feel so incompetent when we pray amen hallelujah and we said if i should call anybody up here to pray they will cringe because they will they're going to say i i'm not good enough to pray my words are not you know fluent you know my speech and i can't make a good presentation but god is not asking you about that you pray from your heart amen hallelujah thank you lord and you hear we spoke about jesus was the greatest teacher that passed through this world there was none greater than him preaching teaching and all that healing is sick and everything but his disciples didn't ask the lord for them to to teach us how to preach and teach and whatever and how to heal is sick what do you what do you what did the disciples ask teach us how to pray amen hallelujah thank you lord and we also learned our frustrations with prayer amen are caused by misconceptions amen there's a lot of misconceptions out there we just want to recap a few minutes just take a few minutes so you know repetition is the mother of learning and humans need to be reminded over and over again amen so if we tend to forget it's good to repeat sometimes amen to remind us to bring us back amen hallelujah man there are a lot of phony baloney ideas out there man a lot of lies myths and misunderstandings amen legends and misconceptions amen there are a lot of information that's information that are not simply true amen amen so a man developed all these things right and it led us astray for all these years that you got to pray in a certain way repeat certain words and everything like that amen for prayer but it's all misconceptions amen hallelujah amen praise god and when we don't do that we feel guilty amen we feel kind of guilty because we can't pray like how they pray and how they speak and how they bring forth these things amen god doesn't want you to feel guilty about prayer because prayer is a conversation with the almighty god hallelujah hallelujah move on to the next slide four please amen hallelujah and we also pray is not a magic one amen that you just wave it amen and everything is going to be all right amen amen hallelujah prayer is not magic amen or you say some some words some familiar abracadabra or some kind of uh concoction i mean we have a lot of that down in the islands and a lot of men you go up to them we call them we call them ob men and and and i i believe some people must be listening to that right now oh dear they know what is that we call them here i believe maybe witch doctors or something like that men but phillip there a lot of that in africa right a lot of that over there right by the husband oh yeah amen a lot of that audio amen so god is not a magic one amen hallelujah that's your husband or your wife you just wave a wand over them and they just change instantly from a frog into a princess or something like that amen hallelujah and prayer is not a fire extinguisher amen hallelujah amen break the glass in case of emergency amen hallelujah so you don't use the pasta and i like to really say they say as a paramedic and the deaconess are paramedic you need to have your own experience with god how to approach god when the trouble hit you in the middle of the night who you want to call upon man when the emergency situation reach who's going to call upon amen you need to have your own experience with god amen hallelujah as brothers you are saying you're broke not any willingness no help nowhere where the first line of defenses pray man call upon jesus call upon him he'll be right there never too busy hallelujah also prayers that i talk about you're not battling bargaining with god man lord i'm gonna do this amen for you to do this for me lord and you're battering and you're bargaining with god and you're pestering god and you're bugging god amen you've got to do this to me god is not obligated to no man amen hallelujah amen praise god or your prayer your past so much amen i'm going to pay so much i'm going to pay my tithe but you got to do this for me you know for me to pay that amen lord i need this job but you know what you know i'm gonna come to church for this week when when i get the job yes you know again at all you're not bargaining and bara with god hallelujah that's how money is god is not a free market amen hallelujah amen hallelujah prayer is not a ritual to relieve guilt amen hallelujah praise god praise god amen hallelujah let's go on to slide number five i've got uh so much here today and i'd like to bring out what the lord will want you to hear amen whatever his will for you today you are my knee today god is going to meet that need amen you come here that he's gonna speak to you he will speak to you you can depend on that you can have confidence that when you have a need he's gonna meet it amen hallelujah hallelujah god loves to talk amen god loves for me to talk to him amen it doesn't have to be something spiritual amen it doesn't have to be something religious amen it just has to be whatever that you are interested in because the lord said i will grant you the desires of your heart so whatever you're desiring today god is interested in today about that amen hallelujah what are you interested in salvation for your husband salvation for your wife your children for a friend a family healing for your body healing for the soul amen amen finances whatever you have need of or your desiring of god is here to meet that need hallelujah you believe that this is what all these 40 days of prayer is about i know so we need to grasp that and hold on to that amen amen how to approach god the brothers are uh the beautiful what is being said throughout the different series amen from better danny from by the uh tim from brother philip from brother despond amen from brother corey man hallelujah and for brother uh are we gonna hear from kofi soon amen thank you lord amen praise god we've been listening we've been hearing all these truths over the years but now it's time to clench the nail amen amen to remind us to bring us back to that position to that condition where god's spirit is going to move not to the pastor only not to the deacon only amen not true but to every single believer imitate the youngest to the oldest amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen and god is going to do it and god is on the move amen and nobody can stop it hallelujah you're hearing the testimonies that is coming forth amen hallelujah from all over amen if these brothers could come here and our pastor come and tell you but certain things gotta keep a little bit a little bit on the uh uh and the silence for now amen and let go when is the right time to reveal it how god's spirit has moved then it will amen hallelujah in time amen you're going to hear all about you're hearing a little bit here a little bit yeah a little bit of rainfall here a little bit that rainfall yeah but it's going to be showers are blessings amen amen showers amen hallelujah thank you lord praise god let's go to slide six please and praise god and as we have uh close off a little bit we wish we closed the last time with this amen in john 1st john 5 14 it says we can be confident amen are you confident today approaching god knowing that he listens to what whenever we ask for anything according to our will oh i hope you're listening to this morning are you with me according to whose will according to his will so you're just not going to be asking any anything you've got to be asking according to his will to his perfect will for your life there's permissive will you could be bartering and begging and battering and everything and sometimes god because he said you see god is he keeps his water just because you ask us you say ask and it shall be given and and most a lot of times we ask for our own self according to our will remain and then god say you're asking but i got to give it to you but it's for your own detriment amen but when you ask according to his perfect will amen hallelujah his perfect will amen hallelujah since we know that he hears us when we make our request then we can be sure that he will answer us amen hallelujah praise god i want you to notice a couple of things amen we know do you know we know do you know that he listens to us when we ask amen amen hallelujah praise god it's not according to our greed but it's according to our need as our brothers rightly says because man give me give me give me give me. right it's a give me give me attitude jimmy give me give me give me amen hallelujah but as according to our need god will meet our need amen amen hallelujah amen i have so much testimonies amen about how god meets needs amen some of the things are secret in your heart the desires and you know just god just come on the scene and just display them and sometimes you forget about it but god is mindful about your needs your desires amen amen and in supernatural ways he meets them hallelujah hallelujah praise god now we spoke about a lot of the misconceptions before now we would like to continue slide number seven prayer is a conversation not a ceremony amen what is a ceremony it's something with a bunch of rules and restrictions we have a lot of that audio amen a lot of that you got to do this and this and this rituals and everything form amen and and things like that amen amen you have to do it in a certain way or it doesn't work amen hallelujah you got to say a hundred at this 200 or not and then god is going to forgive you man and you got to do the beads and the sharp plays and whatever rituals amen hallelujah and then then the prayer is going to work man it's not a ceremony amen hallelujah prayer is a conversation and in a conversation it means you talk yeah you only talk right amen it means also you have to listen amen so get that amen one of the reasons you're bored with prayer is because you do all the talking and you don't listen to that still small voice amen hallelujah if you're just doing monologue to the sky or in the dark amen you don't get any answers you don't hear any impressions of course it's going to be boring to you man because it's just like a one-way street lord give me give me give me lord i want this i want that i i i want this i i i what you're failing to recognize you're feeling to stop a little while and listen because as we always say god gave you one more but two is so because you have to listen twice as much as you speaking amen hallelujah amen so prayer is a conversation amen yes you speak but you got to listen hallelujah praise god hallelujah we are learning how to listen to god amen during this 40 days of pray are we amen simple instruction simple guide that we miss out for all these years amen we gotta go and pray all night amen yeah it's good to wait upon the lord but you don't have to do all the talking you have to do some waiting and listening hallelujah praise god hallelujah thank you lord jesus prayer is not a speech it's not an essay talking and listening to god is a conversation amen hallelujah let's move on to slide it prayer is a relationship not a ritual amen hallelujah it's all about getting close to god it's all about talking to god and be a coming acquainted with god what's a relationship getting to know the person better amen how do you get to know the person better you stay a million miles away no you don't talk to them at all to get to know somebody you got to speak to them and for them to speak back to you that's a relationship to get to know the person better amen it's not a form it's not a ritual amen hallelujah you're talking about things you think you ought to talk about and it becomes a duty it becomes druggery if you do holy talking alone amen hallelujah i should pray amen i have to pray i ought to pray and friends once you get into that trap you're gonna want to pray because it you are motivated by guilt you feel guilty because if you don't pray if i don't pray before i go to bed if i don't pray before i go to work in the morning it becomes like a ritual amen it comes like a habit man hallelujah and it you you feel that you're obligated to do it amen god doesn't want you to feel obligated in any way you are free amen and who the son of man set free is free indeed and you can approach the lord at any time in any situation and in any condition any amen hallelujah amen hallelujah whenever you feel led to pray pray call upon the lord anytime he's there he's he has an open line amen god don't sleep amen what about the time of elijah amen when they went through all the rituals they danced and they sing and they do and the beat they caught themselves and they'll do all that amen did they did their god answer them because they were sowing our dead god we have the only true and living god amen hallelujah and when elijah prayed while you pray pray for a whole night a whole day amen hallelujah short and simple he said

sometimes you don't have to make a summon any mount hallelujah man stick to it that's what god said we're gonna see that amen repetition your acts are posing to pray for one prayer but they're saying it in 20 different ways to the same prayer god may be saying and somebody must be listening man land the plane get to the point amen somebody asked her for prayer they're going for surgery but you

pretending what they not amen hallelujah so don't be a the great pretender amen hallelujah for they love to pray standing in the synagogue and on the street corners to be seen by men in other words for them prayer is a performance they are real good actor amen hallelujah oh yeah watch me pray now i'm really going to impress you all man this time buckle up i'm going to pray a good prayer today amen here we go they're not praying to god they're praying to be seen to impress somebody and the lord is warning us don't be like that amen hallelujah amen he says when you pray don't be like the hypocrites who pray just to be seen by men i tell you the truth they have received their reward in full in other words they're not going to get any more reward than just praises from the people that are around them amen oh man you sound really good that was a wonderful prayer amen hallelujah he says instead when you pray lord is instructing us when you pray go into your room into that secret chamber where you meet him every time where you have enough he has an appointment with you amen because our prophet said he said when you meet god at a certain time in a certain place the angel of the lord is there before waiting on you so it's very important when we have a certain time set aside amen for church service for prayer meeting in your own prayer time in your own time that you scheduled to meet god god is waiting on you to be there so don't be late he's waiting on you amen in this world when we are caught up so in in the busyness of life amen and time is like so much we don't have enough time when you have an appointment with god amen hallelujah you be there you make it your priority to be there and you see how god is going to bless you some people are so late somebody said they might be even late for their own funeral my my mind hallelujah instead when you pray go into your room close the door shut in with god in a secret place amen and pray to your father who is on seed then your father who sees what you've done in secret will reward you amen in other words he will reward you openly the things that are being said in secret desired in secret he'll manifest it openly for the world to see for others to see that the god that you're serving he's a good god amen is god good to you amen is your god really really good to you amen hallelujah amen because he hears and he answers prayers man he knows your desires he knows the secrets of your heart he knows every single thing about you but you got to ask him for some other things amen hallelujah amen thank you lord do not keep on babbling on and on like the pecans for they will be heard because they think they will be heard because of their many words longer is not stronger amen so the more you keep on the same thing over repetition repetition repetition you believe that you have a good case with god you're bargaining and you're battering with god lord i need this lord and needs and i keep going and say it a hundred times you know that's how i you know when i was younger that's how the pentecostals sorry just said they said the holy said hallelujah fast enough and long enough your tongue will get tied up and you start speaking in tongues you do that and you're gonna see you say you say hallelujah a hundred time and see better tell me and i just start talking in a different you can't make nobody can make sense what you're saying and then you see us speaking in tongues my my my i when we were small when i was praise god hallelujah for your father knows what you need of even before you ask does he know what you need exactly he knows man you don't have to convince god he already knows what you have need of you don't have to convince him you know intention you know what you're needed for you know your need and what you need it for so you don't have to convince him that lord i need this for this or that or the other amen hallelujah just talk to him about what you need amen hallelujah he says don't pray to show off to impress somebody we all seen people do that amen watch this i'm going to blow them away today amen you knock that one out at the ballpark god don't want you to be ashore amen god wants you to be sincere to be humble you know prophet said he said be sincere be humble amen and god will bless you amen hallelujah and the way up is dumb so be humble somebody want to elevate their own self the higher your goal they always say the harder you will fall amen so the more you can humble this yourself in the sight of the lord he's the one who's going to

god with confidence we are not afraid to talk to him are you afraid to talk to the lord today he's not a terror amen he's not this terrible god that every time you approach you're going to hit you with a stick in your head and batter you and bite you and condemn you god is a loving faithful kind oh good god amen hallelujah hallelujah we've not embarrassed to talk to him we're not hesitant to talk to him that we have something blocking our lives amen we did something and we feel that we did something so terrible we can approach him god has made our way for each and every one of us [Music] that we cannot approach a stone boldly you see if you have anything just ask for forgiveness a man as of our brother was ministering on friday night amen hallelujah that is nothing so bad you can do

answering prayer hallelujah are you experiencing the grace of god today in your life amen god is so gracious and so merciful amen hallelujah his grace you can say like paul his grace is sufficient for me can you say that this grace is sufficient for me hallelujah when you say it amen amen and you mean it deep it in your heart amen and you experience it then you have a true understanding what grace is hallelujah his grace is sufficient for me where did god bring you from where could you have been today where could you have been this morning today amen hallelujah amen recovering from some a party the night before amen but to be in his presence in his house on this day giving him praise giving him thanks what better place to be than to be in this house amen to thank him for his grace in your life amen y'all could have been calling out for some gutter from some house that you you're not supposed to be in amen hallelujah his grace is sufficient for me hallelujah hallelujah god is good god is my father he is gracious full of mercy he's compassionate he's loving and god loves to answer prayer because he gets to show what he really is because he's a loving god amen hallelujah so when god answer your prayer amen he displays amen his love for you amen hallelujah thank you lord jesus hallelujah everything in the universe comes from the generosity of god everything so everything that you have today comes from god amen you gotta be thankful for that even the breath of life that you're breeding right now comes from him [Music] nothing that you have belongs to you nothing amen hallelujah nothing so why can't we humble ourselves in the sight of the lord amen hallelujah don't feel you're somebody because we are nobody amen even for us for the grace of god in our lives we are nothing nothing amen that we can stand in his presence today amen hallelujah and lift up our voices and holy hands to him and give him praise and thanks for what he has done for us what he is doing and what he is going to do amen hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah loves for us to give him the opportunity for him to bless us amen hallelujah are you giving him the opportunity for him to bless you amen hallelujah god wants to bless you more than anything amen in every single area of your life hallelujah amen hallelujah thank you lord thank you lord jesus hallelujah [Music] his presence is here this morning sweeping over this place hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord over 20 times in the new testament it's referred to god is saying he's asking and he actually commanded us to ask of him to ask of him so don't you think he knows what you need of but he's commanding us for you to ask him amen he's like a father he has everything everything but he loves when his children could come and say daddy i need this amen could you ask your daddy this morning papa god amen oh i listened to her sister prayed he said oh sweet daddy god oh sweet papa oh sweet loving jesus you pray like him like that to him with that passion inside that love that is inside you for him oh my sometimes it just draws us it just pulls on our heart to reach out to him when we speak to him like that oh and he loves it when we talk like that we loves it when he we come to him like that amen hallelujah sweet jesus what a wonder you are what a good father you are amen and amen and amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah god gets to show how good he is when he answers our prayers amen hallelujah praise god and it also re it's regardless how he answers us amen sometimes you know there are three ancestor prayers amen three ancestor prayers is either yes no or wait a little while but i want to give you that fourth one amen god may say is that what you're asking for that's your fourth one you know you mean to say is this what you are asking for something you baffle the lord himself you know it ain't good for you you know you know for sure it is not in this world but you're still asking for it amen hallelujah my praise god thank you lord and every single prayer is answered not yet this is not good for you it does not you are not grown up enough as brother than you say you're not mature enough to receive it it's not good for you because god is a good god and he only gives us good things and if it's not good for you then he's not going to give it to you he said wait a little while for when you can handle it you're going to give a little child a million dollars or you're going to put a gun in their hand or a knife in hand just because they ask for it it's going to destroy them it's not going to be it's going to be to their own detriment to their own heart because they don't they're not mature enough how to handle earth so sometimes god said not yet hold a little bit when you grow up then you can get this and some things are blank no it ain't good for you because if you wanted to marry that man that you want so long in before after god sees in the future he said no anything good for you oh that's cute you've been after for the longest while god said i can see anything good for you you're my son no no this isn't good for you at all amen so we must we must be confident when you give us the answer it's for our own good amen hallelujah amen thank you lord blessed be his wonderful name and also sometimes god said no because you know you have better things in store for us better things in store he said he's going to give you above even what you ask or what you desire amen so god knows god knows better things in store for us amen hallelujah thank you lord jesus my my my mind time is just fleeting on us today wow hallelujah god sometimes says no to our for our own correction to correct us sometimes god said no for our perfection amen to help us grow in our character amen sometimes god say no for our inspection he looks inside of us and help us to see what we couldn't not see amen hallelujah hallelujah you think you're going to give your child every single thing you ask for there will be one spoiled brat amen we see that too many times out here my my my everything asks what you doing a loving father will know what's good for his child and we have a heavenly father knows what's good for you and i am so he don't give you every everything out you ask for you say ask but you asking for everything no your acts according to his will get that in to his will so let your will be done on earth as it is in heaven whatever his will is for my life lord when you pray lord let your will be done for me as you have seen as you have purposed for me amen hallelujah we are learning how to pray because god taught us how to pray amen hallelujah praise god praise god it's like 13 in jeremiah 3 33 it says call on me and i will answer you i will show you marvelous and wondrous things that you could never figure out on your own on me and i will answer you so what god is saying speak to him have a conversation with him amen and he will answer you isn't that the word of god he promised he's going to do it and he surely does all the time amen god answer is bigger than even we can think let me just say even our perspective what we can even dream of or think of what did the lord have in store for us amen eyes haven't seen as haven't heard the things that god has prepared for those that love him could you imagine what god have in store for you you can't dream about it you can't even imagine it imagine that think because you can't even imagine that this great creator have in store for us what await us at the end of it amen hallelujah what is heaven is all about man that is the promise god have for us amen so the sky is the limit the universe is the limit beyond the stars is the limit you can't even dream about that amen what god has in store for you amen hallelujah praise god god is not a vending machine and you know what a vending machine does whoever built a vending machine you get pop you get chips you get all the chocolate and you get all that you put in your money and you press a button and here it comes god is not a vending machine amen he don't give you anything that's bad for you you only give your good things you say chips and salt and pop is not good for you so he's not a vending machine amen hallelujah thank you lord every vending machine only gives you things that are bad for your health and god is only going to give you things that are good for your health good for your life because god is good all the time slide 14 please i mean hallelujah if you if you being imperfect and sinful parents know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your heavenly father give you good gifts to those who ask him amen hallelujah so we just went over that so that's kind of obvious isn't it so god is only going to give you quittings amen god's a perfect father he's only going to give you good things but he wants to give you stuff that you can't even imagine amen hallelujah praise god when you don't pray there are a lot of things that you miss out in life get that when you don't pray there's a lot of good things that you miss out in your life amen so get up get that one amen because the god the lord has been commanding us to ask for him and he's only interested in giving you good things so you got to ask him and he will give you only good things hallelujah hallelujah praise god and when you get to heaven amen you're gonna find out there's a lot of things that you missed out on because you never asked for them you don't want that amen hallelujah praise god thank you lord hallelujah praise god let's go on to slide number 15. so we have seen that god amen praise god that prayer is a conversation it's not a ceremony amen god listens to prayer that are sincere and simple amen and he loves to show us his goodness by answering his prayer and the next one is god longs to be close to me do you want to be close to him we sing draw me nearer nearer blessed lord amen we sing that all the time do you really want to be close to him amen praise god he desires it amen see god is to meet adam every day i believe in the cool of the evening so god loved to be close to adam then amen god created us for fellowship for conversation with him amen for company with him amen amen if you really love someone don't you want to be close to that one amen hallelujah so god loves us amen but due to this separation we get disconnected but now he's calling us back to himself amen he wants to be close to us amen hallelujah amen he wants it deeply he wants to be close to you amen and he wants you to be close to him amen if you are aware from someone for a long period of time don't you long to be with that person again if you love your wife you love your children you've been away for a long time from them some journey or some circumstance or situation you mean you're away from them due to whatever amen don't you want to be close to that person and god is longing for us to be close to him we've been separated from him for too long amen hallelujah and he wants us to be close to him and for us to amen to draw to him god is waiting on you to talk to him he loves you so much he longs to be close to you amen hallelujah he's never too busy to hear your hearts cry never too busy god is on the main line tell him what you need tell him what you need hallelujah praise god and he got a 24 7 hour service amen it's not like when and elijah tell them them prophets and them your god must be gone on a vacation you're too busy the telephone line got caught the internet real busy hallelujah daniel when daniel prayed from the very moment daniel prayed yes the angels were dispatched from the very moment daniel prayed but on the way down they were intercepted by some demonic forces that they had to battle their way through everything that you have need of god has already supplied it amen so when you ask for something the supply is already there just waiting on the delivery service amen healing is already there amen hallelujah but it's just for the delivery service you got to reach out and touch the lord as he passes by he's never too busy to hear your hearts cry never amen hallelujah what you have need of today praise god hallelujah that's the way god feel amen you know you might have children grown up especially the grown up once teenagers they feel they get big enough they want to be disconnected from their parents don't want to leave home they want to talk to you they want to call on the phone nothing they're just completely disconnecting and you as a loving parent how you feel it hurts inside that you have children and they didn't want to talk to you they don't even want to see you imagine about your heavenly father just think about it the one who loves you so much you as a parent feel that way how much god do you want to be like that to your heavenly father my my mind and that's the way how god feels when you don't talk to him when you don't have a conversation with him when you don't meet up with him amen hallelujah praise god you know if you go if some people treat yes spiritual being as sorry if some people street the lord amen how did let me get this thing right hallelujah praise god if they treat themselves right i want to get it right hallelujah praise god this the spiritual being man if they stream their soul right like how they treat their natural cells
