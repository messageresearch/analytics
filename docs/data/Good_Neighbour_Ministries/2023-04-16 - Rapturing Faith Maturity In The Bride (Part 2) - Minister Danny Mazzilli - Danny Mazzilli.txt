the Lord has his house in order this morning amen where the songs of Zion go forth in preparation for the word of God this morning I trust you've all come with some sort of expectation you've prayed it's not just another Sunday something that you do and you just decide to all go to church this Sunday I'm trusting that you're here because you actually know that Christ has come down amen praise God forevermore because that is the experience of a true Christian they've come into that revelation Christ has come down Christ is interested in my life God has come to intercede in my life this morning God wants to do something special for me because he loves me because he knows me because he's interested in fulfilling his purpose and his plan in each and every one of our lives do you believe that this morning if you believe that this morning then you can leave with something in you that will give you strength to overcome the challenges that you will face as a Son of God as a daughter of God As a Christian in this world and in this life right now amen praise God but the Lord is more than able he had prepared it all from before the foundations of the world and he's got a plan for us to get out and to make it out and there is no way that it ain't gonna happen amen it's going to happen amen praise God so just uh before you um sit down just a couple of quick announcements and then we'll go right to the word um first of all this week you know I got a call an individual was passing through by the name of Tony he didn't know us he doesn't know any of us he just had bought in a bunch of Bibles and decided that he wanted to give them away and he says uh you know I want to just give him to a church so he went online and he put Church in Burlington and guess what Good Neighbor Ministries came up and I said wow that's fantastic and and I said that is wonderful I said we'd love to uh you know receive those Bibles um what's going on and and he says well he says uh you know I just feel that I want to give he says what kind of a church are you I said well we're a Full Gospel Church we're similar to a continuation of the book of Acts if you look into the book of Acts you see what the church was back then then you can get an idea of who we are right now and so he says oh that's good he says because I'm coming out of the nomination I said oh well I said that's good I said you're certainly welcome to come and join us anytime he lives out in in Etobicoke I said you're welcome to come anytime and uh if if not you can tune in online and he says he'll do that so if Tony you've tuned in online on behalf of good neighbor Ministries we want to say thank you for the beautiful Bibles they're really nice Bibles they're going to go to people that need them so thank the Lord you know but God is doing something amen and that's what that's what I get out of all of it the Lord is doing something and moving on hearts and lives and somehow supernaturally we're a part of his plan amen amen praise God and so the other thing is the ministry out in Quebec brother Steve result Pastor there is going to be holding a youth camp this year again in the spring from I believe it's it's the long weekend in May around the 21st weekend and so we're asking the young people that are interested and even if you're thinking about going um please stay behind after the service for a quick meeting there is a bulletin on the back bulletin board that's been put there today that gives the details of the speakers and so forth and um there's a sign up sheet there too but it'll all be explained to you for those young people that want to stay behind and when we say young people we're talking about like 13 and up right what is it 12 13 brother Mike you know correct me but anyways stay behind if you have an interest and I'm sure it'll be a tremendous blessing for anybody that wants to go we're going to support it and we're going to support you if you want to go so there's no reason why you can't go so just stay behind praise God let's go to the word of God this morning let's pray just before that father we are really honored this morning Lord to be in your presence once again Lord and we we sense your spirit your presence we know that you're mindful of every need here this morning and I know that if we can all from speaker to here get real sincere and within our hearts Lord just honest before you Lord that something special can happen this morning and and Lord we're looking forward to that father may your spirit ride the word this morning because Lord we can read the Bible we can read the quotes we can bring words and intellectual man's interpretations and meanings but Lord without your spirit there is no life that is nothing but the truth and so father take control remember our pastor and his family this morning may you bless them watch over them provide their needs and Lord we will never fail but to give you all the praise and the glory remember those that are not with us that want to be with us here this morning that maybe have not been well I pray that you'll touch them remember brother Corey this morning Lord certainly right back on his feet again and doing extremely well we thank you for that Supernatural touch in his life Lord may you just finish the work now and Lord we will never fail but to give you all the praise the glory and the honor in Jesus name amen praise God let's put up the first slide we're continuing along with what we started here the last time we were here looking at rapturing Faith and maturity in specific in mature the maturity that's in the bride maturity in the bride a time in a season that the Bride Comes to understand her placing her position in the word of God what is expected of her and when I say her the bride I'm talking about Christians that are in the body of Christ the church the called out ones we need to understand that amen and so the first scripture that we read um from The Book of Romans chapter 1 verses 16 and 17 it says for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek in other words the Jew the Gentile it's to anyone that can receive the word of God Amen for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written the just shall live by faith the Amplified version says I am not ashamed of the gospel for it is the power of God for salvation for his wrath and Punishment to everyone who believes in Christ as Savior to the Jew first and also to the Greek for in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed both springing from faith and leading to Faith disclosed in a way that awakens more faith as it is written and forever remains written the just and upright shall live by faith you may be seated praise God we're talking about rapturing faith you know and just to you know kind of recap from the last time that we were here rapturing faith is a is a a specific kind of faith and we've read here in the scripture that that God is adding to our faith God has always been adding to Faith when he started right from you know from uh you can go right back to Genesis okay where God revealed himself and came and revealed himself through Adam and then expressed Eve through Adam and and then expressed by Revelation to Abel what the you know what the acceptable sacrifice it was always God revealing his mind his purpose and his will for each and every dispensation revealing unto each of them what they were going to require in order to fulfill their time their season their part in the word of God and so coming down now we we've come to realize that there's a special kind of Faith that's being you know revealed to us right that and and that faith is called rapturing faith because in this hour it's going to require a supernatural Faith to change these bodies to translate us to fulfill the portion of the word that we have been given to fulfill and that is the rapture our departure is the next major event that is going to take place on this Earth we're not talking stories here we're not talking uh fables you know when we talk about the Rapture and when we talk about what God is going to do in this hour and how he's going to change this Mortal so that it can put on immortal okay this is what the scripture says about you and me we're going to be changed and we're going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye okay so there's been a a supernatural rapturing Faith that's been released in this day that is for a specific people all the other churches out there all the denominational churches and you know there's a lot of wonderful people in those churches we're not putting down the people but they've come under a system and any time that you come under a system you gotta realize that that system has been infiltrated by the enemy we're going to look at a scripture even now the next scripture we're going to look at that and we're going to see what it is that's been taking place and how the whole world is in a level of deception right now when it comes to the religious realms amen and that that that level of deception is something that that every single person will get caught under that accept those who have been predestinated whose names were in the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundations of the world they cannot be deceived and the reason why they cannot be deceived is because they're receiving rapturing faith without rapturing faith you fall into the deception so let's look at now and let's go to the next scripture and we're going to continue this thought on maturity in the bride Matthew 13 verses 24 to 30 another Parable put he forth Jesus speaking unto them same the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a man which soweth good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and sold tares among the wheat and went his way now remember Christ Elohim the self-existent one had a plan from before the foundations of the world that he was going to bring forth his sons and daughters and redeem them it all started in the Garden of Eden and right here we can see right here we see that God set up a garden he put a man there and and and the enemy came to Eve came right to that garden and what did he do he started to sow seeds of discrepancy he started to put things into their minds and started to take and that's why denomination is not of God because they've got their own interpretations being infiltrated by the enemy that comes in and souls the tares puts in the lies tells the people that God is three and that he's three in one and that there's a trinity and there's no such scripture for that God is one the Lord God hear ye o Israel the Lord thy God is one one not two not three Jesus of the New Testament is Jehovah of the Old Testament Jesus means Jehovah savior all God did was create for himself a body so that he could dwell in that body so that he could be the ultimate sacrifice go to Calvary take our place for our sin as humans and bring us back to our position as attributes of God because this will not inherit the kingdom of God Amen that's why your mistakes and all your all your failures and you know I've got rapturing faith good news this morning this kind of faith that goes beyond your mistakes it goes beyond all your weaknesses it goes beyond your history it goes beyond your genealogy it goes beyond all the things that you thought that had a hold on your life you've been liberated by this rapturing Faith you've been placed into a realm where all things are possible now for your life those who I have called I have Justified you look up the word justification it means you never did it in the first place [Applause] but while men slept his enemy came and sold tares among the wheat and went his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tears also so the Servants of the householder came and said unto him sir this not thou sow good seed in thy field from whence then hath it tears he said unto them an enemy hath done this we know what has deceived the people they're good people they're honest sincere people they read the same Bible that we read but these scriptures are here to bring out the understanding and the Lord himself was bringing Clarity and he says sir did not thou so good seed and I feel from Once then had deters he said unto them an enemy have done this the servant said unto him will thou then that we go and gather them up that's not our job but he said nay lest while ye gather up the tares ye root up also the wheat with them let now watch this is important let both grow together until the Harvest and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers who's going to say the Lord is going to say Gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn now we know by understanding the message of this hour that God has sent a prophet in the 20th century it's hard to swallow for a lot of people but I challenge you to search the scriptures and see if in them it doesn't bring clearly what God required and what was necessary in order to bring us to this rapturing faith that we're preaching on this morning there were many he says I will send out the Reapers and there and you know God has sent out all the ministers all the ministers that are out there that are that are ministering the word of God they all come under the the call of God going Jesus says go ye into all the world and preach the gospel and so many are doing it and they're believing that they're doing it under the anointing of the Holy Spirit and they believe that that that you know that they have a message that is salvation and they do have a message of salvation but the message of Salvation that we're speaking on here this morning and the one that we've been called to just by the grace of God Saints you were not deserving of this kind of a calling there's nothing that you did in your in your human existence that you were so good that you deserve this kind of a calling because all of us can start to talk about our past and and bring up how God just by the grace of God I'm here today it's by the grace of God that we're all here today what it was a call of God because he saw his attributes his thoughts he had them he knew but he also saw that there was going to be a harvest and this Harvest that we're talking about is the Harvest of the Bride go to the next slide so we're looking at rapturing Faith we're looking at maturity listen here modern events made clear by prophecy now notice when we're talking about the seed now I want you to recognize and identify the seed as the attribute of God seed word attribute mind of God the word expressed when God saw you in his mind he expressed You by attribute into this Dimension at this time he's calling his seed attribute back to himself and it's going to happen in a harvest there's been many harvests but this is the Great Harvest at the end of the world notice he likened it to a grain of wheat the bride the reason that God had to let that go like that that fine real genuine church that was established on the day of Pentecost had grown and groaned since the day of Pentecost into a great church it had to fall into the Earth in that Dark Age and he buried like all seed does you got to see in here we are we're looking at the Reformation how God has brought us to the day that we're in right now and it all started right back there on the day of Pentecost when all those that had received the Holy Ghost started to go out and Minister the word of God and and because they were actual seeds of God that were that were anointed by the holy spirit amen it had to die so but but then it had to go through a stage and a process and this process you know we're just going to cover it here to lay in the foundation it's important for us to understand that there was a process that's bringing us to this level of maturity that we need to enter into as the seed attribute of God we are moving into a level of maturity that will produce a body change it had to die so it could come forth in the Reformation again so the word went down into the Dark Ages you can go back and read the history of what happened after Pentecost we went through the Dark Ages and all those that were that were seeds and attributes of God in that time in that season because there was harvests in each and every age they all had to fulfill their portion of the word those that were in the Dark Ages they had to produce death they had to go and be sacrificed but God gave them an anointing in order to produce that part of the word so they were they were they were ordained for that amen I want you to see what's what this is leading up to they were ordained For That season in that time they had to be buried they had to go down and from there just like a stalk of wheat coming up the first thing comes up is two little blades then it keeps adding more blades up come Martin Luther than swingly and on down Calvin and they moved on and go to the next slide finally it goes into a tassel now that was John Wesley okay we need to see Luther Wesley justification was Luther Wesley sanctification God is God is preparing the church God is bringing the church into its fullness God is ripening the church because there's going to be a great harvest and each one of them had to produce their part and then Wesley's age and it had a pollen drop back from there come the Pentecostal age Pentecostal age was so close just like the real grain of wheat the spirit of God was moving on the people they were speaking in tongues they were rejoicing around the word of God they believed that that was it that it was that that now was the coming of the Lord and that and that his second coming was right then right there everyone thought you know this is it the manifestation of the gifts but that's not it that's still not it this got to come to the fullness of the word Christ himself once again amen grain of wheat okay then uh but it's set there for a purpose to shelter the sorry from there come the Pentecostal age so close just like a real grain of wheat if you look at the stock but if you'll take that wheat and move it back there's not one grain in it at all it's only a shock and in the shape of a grain and that's kind of where we're you know we're at right now at the time in the season we're going to see it a little closer as we go on but it sat there for a purpose to shelter the grain to protect the elected of God to keep them in the hour of great deception because that's really deceiving you know like you can see you can look into a field and you can see the wheat and the stock and everything looking you know all the leaves are out and even the leaves are starting to die around it and everything else and you would think it's grain time it's time for to harvest the grain but it wasn't yet that was the Pentecostal age but now we've entered into the sea time the grain time the time where he takes his grain into the Garner where he's going to take his elect those that have those that he has seen from before the foundations of the world that have come into their position that have come into their placing that have recognized their calling amen this is not play Church saints this is not just join a church there's a lot of churches out there that you can go to this Sunday you can go to another one next Sunday you'll get different varieties of preachers you'll get all kinds of teachings of man you'll hear things that can be put together even better than I can put them together or even Pastor Simon or any other other ministers can put it together because they're doctors of divinity they know the Bible inside out they know the the the humanetics and hermeneutics and and all the the interpretations and the Greek and everything else my God you could spend years there's books that are like like a library full of interpretations of of the word of God but let me tell you there's one interpreter and that's the Holy Ghost and when the Holy Ghost comes in you it doesn't matter what you read it's the spirit of God interpreting that word right back to you all right don't tell me that it was some man that called you into this come on are you kidding me that you would that that you can still stand after so many years to still stand on this word no matter what comes your way no matter how hard it gets no matter what comes you listen you might get knocked down and many of us get knocked down and there's nothing wrong with getting knocked down by the way nothing wrong with it but I'm telling you there's something in you that raises you back up there is no way that you can stay down as a son or a daughter of God temporarily you might get put away you might get set aside you might need a rest God knows what you have need of but if there's an attribute of God in there and that's what we're talking about today we're not talking about churchianity we're not talking about oh you know Salvation and Jesus is your savior yeah that's all the truth everybody's claiming that you can go right downtown Hamilton right now and you'll see some guy that's you know probably high from the night before and preaching Jesus with a sign saying God bless you God bless you why God bless you so you can bless me and there's nothing wrong with blessing them don't get me wrong it's good the poor will be with us always that's just the dimension that we're living in that's part of the existence here it's the Paradox Saints you listen we we must experience it as Sons and Daughters of God that have been enlightened to the word you drive down the street you see things you see people begging you see hungry you see the sick you see The Afflicted you see the mentally oppressed it's a reality it's taking place but it's a paradox because you're seeing it all because you're awake you're awake God God just awoken you by the grace of God you didn't deserve to be awakened but you were ordained to be awakened and you can't help us say Amen to this word amen then all the life leaves the shock as it left the stock left the pollen leaves the shock and goes into the wheat and forms again just like it was down in the ground God is showing the process that the word that he sent forth from the beginning shall not return unto him void that which he has sent it forth to accomplish it will accomplish whatever is in your life that needs to be dealt with that needs to be uh put to death we die daily the Bible says we're going to be looking at some things whatever is needed God is going to do it you know Jesus here gives the interpretation of the parable and I want you to notice he says here in verse 37 he says and he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man now I want you to recognize here why it's so important for God to sow his seed in his season there's a portion of seed that God needed to sow in this dispensation that we're under this 20 21st 20th and 21st Century dispensation there was a portion of seed that needed to be sown he says the good seed is the son of man and we know that it's always been Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is the son of man he was Elohim in the beginning it was Jesus the self-existent one Jesus is a name that he gave to himself while he was here on Earth but before he was called Jesus he was the self-existent one he was Elohim he was God he was the one that the Bible says by the word of God was the worlds framed by the word of God was everything created everything exists and consists by the word of God that's why when you're talking to people out there and they're saying oh the universe we don't believe in Jesus but we believe in the universe we believe in the in the in in the in the the life of of the universe and that we are part of that universe and that we are one with that universe and that we can be and and do anything that we want because we can call by speaking and visualizing everything now they've they're they're touching on Truth there they're actually touching on a lot of Truth but within there there's there's the perversion of leaving out the absolute which is Christ the self-existent one the the creator of Heaven and Earth and everything that was ever created and they'll just go and say no but we can be that we can do I've I've heard people say we can do whatever we want I said so what it's okay to steal cheat lie yes this they said if you're doing it and not harming anybody and you know it's and I thought wow really I said that's interesting you see they don't understand the law of God's word that it has a law behind it which is sowing and reaping and that's why God had to sow his word the son of man coming through a son of man in our 20th century to bring forth and sow a word that was going to fit you and call you and position you and bring you into maturity for one purpose the rapture so here now when we look he says here the field is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one who was the Wicked one it was the darkness it was the evil one it was Satan the Fallen Angel all part of God's Plan of Redemption remember he was actually created for that purpose you know that's the Paradox Saints you know you can talk to people and I've said this before you can talk to people about the Earth's 200 million 500 million a billion years old it's so irrelevant because the Bible says in the beginning Elohim in the beginning God the self-existent one that beginning to God has no significance it only becomes significant to the human mind because we think in time we think in time so it's one of the weaknesses of Being Human you've got to see the Paradox here God could have been a trillion years on this Earth and there could have been other worlds before this world the Bible says the world's plural were framed by the word of God but what has it got to do with your world you see this is where you got to tune into your world your plan your purpose why you're here on Earth Hallelujah he says here the enemy that sowed them is the devil he sold the tariffs the Harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the Angels so God is is using this aspect of preaching the word using the process that Faith cometh by hearing and by hearing the word of God because we're in a world of human existence and yet we are attributes of God because you're made up of soul body attribute okay you've got a body you've got a spirit but then in there is the attribute it's like it's like the stock right you know the stock is the body and then the shuck is like the spirit and then the grain the seed that's what we're talking about here it's the attribute of God so you are an attribute in an eternal attribute having No Beginning No End that's the Paradox of being a Son of God but yet you're in a human realm so we need to come back to earth and deal with the plan as God has laid it out for us so here now we need to understand Harvest look at Harvest harvest the season when crops are gathered the Gathering of a crop a ripe crop as of a grain or fruit the quantity of a crop gathered in a single season so there's a harvest in every age God has a harvest at the end of the world and that Harvest is that we're talking about and that we're that we're looking to is our Harvest our time of maturity you can't listen Harvest you can't Harvest without something being mature they go and they pick the peaches and the cherries because they're ready for Harvest they've come into a level of maturity they've come into a place where they can be picked where they can be gathered and brought into the see God used all these parables in order to you know to to show us his process and and God hides himself in simplicity and that's why he made it so simple for the children of God this is simple what we're talking about here God is harvesting a mature bride a mature Church so now how will we know that the Harvest is at hand by recognizing that individuals are recognizing who they are according to the word for this season we start to see first of all we need to recognize that brother Branham was a son of man revealing the son of man he had come into His maturity he had come to his place where God had taken him through his whole Ministry to the very point of his Epiphany which was the opening of The Seven Seals where he would would uh cross a new dispensation where he would go off the scene so that Christ could come on the scene remember it's always going to be Christ it's always going to be the son of man the son is what ripens the the grain it's Christ in you it's Christ speaking to you it's Christ revealing to you making his word known to you telling you who you are where you came from and where you're going that is the Awakening and the maturing of the seed as you're saying Amen to that as you're recognizing that you're not just a Christian so-called quote-unquote that belongs to a church but you're actually the green you're the you're the attribute you're the bride you're the seed of God you're the one that's going to be changed in this last day but the next uh slide says fruit cannot ripen unless the sun ripens it you are going to have to identify yourself with Jesus Christ he's the only one that can ripen and bring into manifestation what's in the seed because remember their seeds of God and then there's weed seeds brother Branham called them seeds of discrepancy they're coming forth they're manifesting they're showing themselves like their bride like they're the Church the true church but yet when the pure word of God comes to them and and identifies them in the word of God it's either identifying them as an attribute of God or they reject the word and identifies them as a terror it's just as simple as that so when you're you know like you could talk to a lot of people and oh I'm a Christian I'd go to church I go to church every day people have Catholics you know they go to church every day but then when the Holy Spirit shines his light remember it takes the the the sun to ripen and to bring into manifestation what's really there when the light starts to shine upon that seed it either says Amen to the word of God or rejects it if it rejects the word if it questions the word if it starts now I'm not talking questioning in a way I'm talking you know that sarcastic questioning you know where they they have their they have their their own agenda in the back of their mind and they're questioning you and questioning the word and oh but you know what about this did you consider that and you know they they don't you know they don't want to just keep it simple and allow the word to be the interpretation because remember if the spirit of Christ Jesus said I'll send you the comforter which is the Holy Ghost and he will guide you into all truth so you cannot deny this word no matter how much you preach whatever you do it cannot be ripened it cannot be manifested it cannot be Vindicated only by him who said I am the light of the world and he is the word and when the word is a flashed over you as a son or a daughter of God and there's an attribute in there it's has to respond you can't help it you you you're you're gonna hear this message you're going to recognize what God has done you're going to see that God sent the prophet you're going to recognize that he was a wave chief that he was one that came into full maturity that that identified Jesus Christ not the man but identified the Fulfillment of the word in the man he fulfilled Malachi 4 5. he fulfilled Revelations 10 7. he fulfilled being the angel that was on the earth that was gonna that was gonna be the voice of God not God the voice of God he was going to speak and and be rep and and it would be representing the voice of God it would be the actual literal voice of God and that's what's happening even now this rapturing faith that that I'm feeding on and that you're feeding on it's it's it's the Deep call to the Deep it's it's it's right now communicating with you it's it's moving through the aisles it's going into your hearts and into your lives it's it's Discerning your heart it's it's showing you certain aspects of your life where God was real where he supernaturally did certain things for you and you couldn't deny it you knew that it was a supernatural experience it wasn't just some altar call so there has to come forth a power the Holy Spirit himself to ripen or to vindicate or to prove or to make manifested that what he's predicted would happen in this day the evening light produces that Hallelujah glory to God this is our time this is the end time this is the Harvest Time this is the time where we come into maturity amen rapturing faith is being released through the word right now as we're ministering the word of God there's a supernatural Faith that's seeking out attributes of God wherever they are I don't have to put an interpretation on it God is his own interpreter when you listen to the word of God you're gonna you're gonna hear an uncertain sound you're going to hear the unwritten part of the word of God it's like a wife and a husband when the husband sends his wife a love letter and he writes about certain times certain places certain experience she knows exactly what he's saying she's been there she's experienced and you were in Christ before you came to this world to Manifest this human this human body of mistakes that's what we are there's no perfection in in this it's the attribute of God that's what makes us different that's what identifies us with the word with the pure word of God Amen praise God everything that the Lord did in brother branham's Ministry I want you to know that he's going to repeat it in your ministry he's going to bring you into a level of maturity just like he brought him to that place where he could stand and know who he was until you come to a place where you can stand and know that you are a part of this church I'm not talking about Good Neighbor Ministries I'm talking about the mystical body of Jesus Christ you're identified with Christ you're identified with the word you've recognized what God is doing in this hour you realize that it's not going to be by your own intellect that you're going to overcome you've come to an understanding that greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world you're not going to stay in a defeated condition bride you need to wake up this morning the rain is falling on us this morning it's bringing Harvest rain so that you can come out of your shell you can come out of your weakness come out of your unbelief and and and the things that that sold so many times want to hit you over the head sickness wants to hit you over the head financial problems they want to hit you over the head relationship issues want to hit you over the head but I want you to know that there's something greater in you this morning that has already overcome that has already provided has already made a way everything that the Lord did in in that's why when you go back you know listen Saints I was listening to the Prophet this morning and he was talking about a woman that came into the prayer line and he was just talking like the woman and he's saying you know like maybe she's you can go listen to it in the seat of of of discrepancy and and brother branham's talking and he says well maybe I don't know this woman I don't know who she is maybe she's you know like the one like Jesus had to go to Samaria one day and he had to go and see a woman and maybe she's like that or maybe not but you know he was just talking and talking in all of a sudden I'm going through my whole experience with the Lord and he just kept going and I'm I'm just I'm just like feeding I'm driving and I'm feeding and I'm feeding this is early in the morning and that's when I can just absorb and I cut I got caught up into this world where where my whole world I was experiencing the reality of what he was speaking and then he starts to go and he says and there's another woman here and she's in the prayer line she was given a card and I don't know her man do I know you ma'am no I don't know you now he's talking to her and he's he's waiting on the Lord because the Lord is going to do something for that woman so I don't know why you've come here and I don't know what it is that you have need of but here he keeps talking and then he says and all of a sudden he says to her he says you want to have a child you've been and you're you know you're you're just around 40 and and you know there's been others in this ministry you know that that this just the other day he's talking he says I picked up a little girl and you know she was you know her mother came into the prayer line and she was seeking the Lord to have a baby and God you know graciously granted her and I picked up that beautiful little girl she's a spoken word child and I'm going through this whole thing and I'm I'm right in the midst of this whole thing and I'm saying Lord I had that experience you're the same God you're the same one it was it was it was 23 years 24 years or 28 years because my wife and I we wanted to have another child after our second child I had gotten a vasectomy I decided that I would you know at the time I didn't know the Lord I said you know though no more children we had a lot of trouble you know with with Michael he was colic and you know I made it tough on my wife and you know when you don't know the Lord everything's tough everything's hard nothing's easy amen oh my goodness but you know what when the Lord came into our lives all of a sudden there was a desire there was life because God is a giver of life and all of a sudden the desire came on my wife came on me we wanted to have another child we prayed we believed we wept and we cried I went and got a reverse all of the vasectomy done I went two weeks of Hell amen and then the doctor tells me sorry it didn't work he says if you want us to redo it again for you week I said no no no no no and I stood and I looked I said Dr Sheldon I said I'm going to tell you a story and this is what I said to him I said there was a man in the Bible by the name of Abraham I said God gave him a child because God ordained to give him a child and there was nothing that could stop and I said and if God wants to give me a child it's easy for God your part is done I'm done see you later it wasn't until four years later In God's Time and the Holy Spirit spoke through our pastor in a prayer line because my wife had a desire not now four years later but four years before while we're going through that turmoil and Pastor Simon ministered and preached and and and prayed over my wife and prayed over us for that desire and God had a time and a season and then we had moved and we'd gone to a house and we just moved into a house on Applebee line we're just gonna move into it and I brought Pastor Simon to go and see that home he walked into the house and he's looking now we didn't have the child yet she wasn't even conceived yet he walks into the house and he starts walking around he says where's the baby's bedroom and my wife and I looked at him and we said which baby well guess who came a year later you see when God wants to do something he'll do it there is nothing too difficult for the Lord what's my point here there's two points here God was vindicating that he was sending a wave chief that was going to speak a son of man that was going to reveal the son of man and speak the word that there was going to be a church that was going to be harvested in the end time and when God came and Vindicated it through that Prophet it came to pass and here we are today and the other point was that God is a supernatural God and this call on your life is not some just ordinary invitation to come to church and be a part of a church if you're not an attribute of God I'm just sorry to say it you're not going to be able to stay the full course and take that flight into Glory that's not by my choice that's not by your choice that's all because of the plan of God and what he established from before the foundations of the world Hallelujah glory to God Amen so what is it now it's laying in the presence of the Sun and that will ripen us to the level of maturity required to take the Rapture which is the Harvest in this time remember Saints this is his Harvest of his attributes in his time it's got nothing to do with our timing our uh decision you know people say oh I made a decision I came to the Altar and I gave my life to the Lord no I give him the real interpretation God called you and it was your time to come to the altar to be awakened to who you've always been because you are a son of God or a daughter of God the Bible says whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundations of the world you don't just become a son or a daughter of God by making a confession like the like a lot of people say they'll just tell you listen just confess that Jesus Christ is Lord that's it just confess it okay I confess that Jesus Christ is Lord you got a light you want to go smoke a doobie no I'm not making fun here but I'm talking about the reality because the spirit of God is a Holy Spirit now I'm not also saying holier than thou you can't be holy don't try to put on any holiness you know it looks it looks funny when people try to put on holiness okay it's when Christ is in you and Christ does things that are like simple almost unnoticeable but yet it's the Holy Ghost doing it because it's vindicating his own word it's it's bringing his own word into manifestation bringing it to life in your life Hallelujah we don't put on holiness and this is not a choosing but this is not your choosing this is God's foreknowledge God could see you know a lot of people say oh so what God decide to choose him not choose her choose him no God could see down through time because remember God is eternal he could see that when the word was going to come to you when he was going to speak to you that you were just like the woman at the well something was going to cut your attention something was going to make you say wait a minute something something what did you say what did you say you just did you just say that I got five husbands yeah and the one you're with right now isn't even yours Hallelujah this is the Messiah this is the reality this is the this is the experience that we're talking about the reality of God coming into your life you never chose God God chose you God saw you God God's going to use you you know I was talking to brother Corey the other day and I was saying brother Corey it's a miracle I said when did you come to the Lord he said 1995 I said praise God I said I came 1994 because I remember you were just a kid you'd come into the youth meetings you know just a kid and and I said you're still standing after 28 years I said I don't care what you've gone through I don't care what the devil is trying to put on you the devil's put a lot of things on a lot of us tries to Mur us and scur us and make us tell us that we're this tell us that we're that I don't believe I tell that demon go right back to hell where you came from I said but guess what sometimes I get a headache and I'll take a Tylenol I'm not afraid of taking medicine when I need it I don't need it all the time but when I need it I'll take it okay because it's dealing with this it's got nothing to do with that attribute I said you're still standing after 28 years by the grace of God I said a young man are you kidding me being tempted by the lust of the flesh by the by the things of this world you know as a young man I look back and say Lord Jesus thank you Lord that I didn't have to have that portion what a fight that would have been we don't understand but God knows what that attribute has to produce God knows what it's gonna what the purpose behind it is God knows how it's going to get used and how it's going to bring glory to God In The End Hallelujah there's been a lot of others that have been put through certain trials not even close to those kind of Trials and yet they walk away but there's something in there that is standing from before the foundations of the world Hallelujah glory to God when that when that blind Bartimaeus was blind as about sitting on the side of the road born blind new blind Nothing But Blind and the spirit of God looked at him and said what do you have need of and he said that I might see and right there his eyes were opened you try to tell blind biter mass that he didn't meet the Living God you try to tell him he left with a testimony the woman at the well left with a testimony you can claim that you've left with a testimony you know what God has done in your life you know what God is doing in your life this has got nothing to do with you trying to put on or you I can go to church more than anybody else I can do this I can do that you gotta die out to I you all of you you remember the seed it's surrounded by all kinds of leaves and Shucks and everything else but it's all Gotta Die it's got a completely all die everything around your life everything that's human everything that's that that that's that's contrary reasoning trying to put reasoning on this reasoning on that it's got to die this is the time of maturity this is where she comes into the fullness of knowing who she is and who she stands with and who it is that's in her Hallelujah but you know God has to send manna God needs to send us something every now and then listen to Listen to brother Branham here in the message kinsman redeemer now you know the story of Ruth he says then he went to the young man the others he said now she's gleaning for life oh boy listen we all go through those times where we're searching we're searching for something we're searching for that next Revelation we're waiting on God what is it it's gleaning it's searching the scriptures listening to the messages coming into the house of the Lord coming under that anointing but brother Brahm says here he says now she's bleeding for life now I want you Reapers you angels in other words that's what they are said I want you Angels you Reapers once in a while to drop a handful of Revelation purpose he calls it the Bible said it was well sometimes you get down sometimes you get weak sometimes you get so discouraged but God is going to send you some purpose to your life he's going to send you some Revelation that's going to bring you back that's going to restore your walk with the Lord renew your your your walk with God restore unto you the joy of your salvation because we all go through those dry times amen but God sends some purpose oh don't let it all be so tiresome for her but every once in a while let her hear a good message let a good power of the Holy Spirit cover her over once in a while to let her know that I'm still there do some kind of a healing among her do some kind of a sign or a wonder that she'll know that I'm in her midst that it's that don't don't you like to find them handfuls he says he says the Congress the congregation says amen I hope we find some this morning I hope you found some this morning I hope that there's there's a refreshing of some purpose coming into your walks this morning to serve God and to recognize that you've got a great purpose in the plan of God a handful of fresh barley the Lord is doing something that he that he that he used to do something that we know he does you see that's what that's what happened to me this morning I'm driving along and I'm just listening to the message and all of a sudden I realize that that he's dropping inspiration and Revelation and he's vindicating that that he's in my life that he he's concerned that he wants to do more that he did those things because he had a purpose he wants to fulfill his plan you're coming into that maturity you're growing by the grace of God he drops some purpose amen glory to God I hope we find some this morning he says he does the he's lord of the Harvest he's the only one can drop the handful I want you to know that Danny or Pastor Simon or Tim or Chris or Philip we can't drop purpose but he can come and he can drop his anointing and he can let the word be be filled with the spirit so that when it when it strikes you when it strikes your heart that's called the Revelation the stimulation that comes from the Revelation and you don't you you can't explain that it's just Supernatural when you're in Fellowship you'll know you'll know when you're in fellowship with a brother or sister you know like my wife tells me all the time you know I was in the fellowship there with the sisters and boy there was a beautiful sweet anointing that came around what is that it's the stimulation because God is dropping handfuls of purpose Revelation to give you existence to give you uh confidence to keep pressing on and to keep encouraging one another we should be encouraging one another this is the time to encourage one another this is the time to lift Christ up in the midst of our fellowship not raise ourselves up I can do this and I can do that and you know I did this and I did that and oh yeah yeah it's all no this is God's time this is Christ in you the bride manifesting himself in the world showing himself that he can live in a people that he's still alive that he's not somebody that's just in the word in the Bible that people talk about as a history but he's alive he's alive brother Desmond he's real so many testimonies brother Desmond goes and prays for the sick and and and and people getting healed why because he knows he's alive he knows he's alive and you need to know he's alive you can't be afraid to lay your hands on the sick when they're sick pray over them let the Holy Spirit interpret it you're not going to need to interpret anything Hallelujah Angels go down he says I command the angels to go down to that meaning that meeting this morning I want them to do a certain certain thing I've commanded them and they'll do it oh my praise God forevermore what is it it's God coming down in the midst next slide it's like hatching an egg the seed is not air with the shuck brother Branham saying here an egg cannot hatch it rots right in the nest if it hasn't been with the male bird and that's why we need to realize recognize and know that this is all about him this is not about you this is about him manifesting his Spirit into your home into your family into your business into your health inviting him into every aspect of your life because that's what brings forth The Life just like members of a church you can baby them and call them make them deacons and everything else but you have a nest full of rotten eggs unless they've mated with the meat oh glory to God Amen God is God is looking for elected attributes of God in this day and in this hour that's what he's hunting for that's what he's harvesting now amen the shuck has to leave the seed to get the seed in the presence of the Sun so it can be ripened and so so that's why sometimes they'll go out from us because they were not they were not of us that's why there's going to be a separating sometimes that's why there's going to be situations that are going to happen people in your own lives that you thought you know they were your friends they were you love them that you thought they loved you and then all of a sudden you know you talk too much about the Lord and it kind of scares them and then all of a sudden they're not calling you anymore they're not hanging out with you anymore because they think you're some sort of a religious fanatic that's what they thought about Jesus because he was God on Earth and and he says I'll be with you even in you and if you believe that then you know that the spirit of God is around your life you can't help it he chose to Abode in you and so he's going to manifest himself in you and things are going to start to leave your life things are going to fall away you know little by little the Lord is going to deliver you when I first came to the Lord and he opened my understanding everywhere I looked it was like unbelief all around me and I I said pastor Simon I'm going to sell everything I'm going to get rid of everything I'm just going to come I'm just going to come to church I I don't want nothing to do with this anymore this is my God it's a wife you see you your eyes are open and without some wisdom and some some direction and some balance and maturity you start to do things that are out of character and that's why it's so important to realize that this is a work it's a it's a work God is gradually little by little will I deliver my people next slide invisible Union of the Bride he says here you take that wheat and open it up and you pull it off the stock you look at it you say we got a grain of wheat but careful it's just exactly like the grain but there's not a bit of grain in there it's the shuck the shuck can look just exactly like the wheat seed but the moment that you really open it up and you start to expose what's really there you find out there's nothing there and there's a lot of that going on right now Matthew 24 24 said it would be so deceiving in the last days that it would deceive even the very elect if it were possible there's a lot of people that are claiming this message but yet they're claiming things and saying things that don't line up with the seed word of God it's not it there they don't realize that they're actually pushing aside Jesus Christ in the present stage of his ministry he's the lord of the Harvest right now he came down in 1963 brother Branham had to go off the scene in 1965 so that the mighty Angel himself the lord of the Harvest could step down and begin to ripen and call and bring into maturity the seed that he's calling into the rapture so there's a lot of things going on right now around us even within the ranks and the Realms of the message that if that but but you see you can't be deceived because the minute you remember that that that that that Supernatural element that's called Revelation and stimulation never never uh make that anything you know really like simple it is simple but don't don't put put it aside because when the spirit of God stimulates you when you hear something when somebody says something and and there isn't a stimulation and there isn't a revelation behind it it's either because it's not time for you to receive it you don't need to say anything it's maybe not the time for you to receive it or it's just not revelation it's man it's man's thinking but you've been given this Supernatural element which is the ability to receive rapturing faith that element cannot be under emphasized you will know when something is not truth you will the spirit of Truth in you will will identify with you need to wake up to this if you're not aware of it now then I'm asking you to be more sensitive to your inner senses too many times how many times have you done certain things and you knew that you received an inspiration not to go there and you ended up going and it was like I knew that I felt something about that I shouldn't have even gone there you know I shouldn't have said that you know that's why it's so important to think before you speak it's important you've got to understand that your words they have an effect on people when you write something it has an effect on people when you don't write something it has an effect on people it's there's all kinds of hidden messages that can be uh you know discerned in in our lives and we need to become more sensitive to those things and how do you do that you just get more quiet with the Lord you surrender more to the Lord these are practical things that before you do something take it to prayer and sit quietly and wait and if you sometimes you gotta wait there for an hour but all of a sudden you will receive an inspiration he's the same yesterday today and forever I will speak to my people he speaks you need to come into that time of maturity in your life where you where you can actually get quiet and Silent with the Lord and you can hear his voice amen hallelujah and see here he says we got a grain of wheat be careful it's just exactly like the grain but there's not a bit of grain in there it's a shuck there's the Pentecostals now brother Branham was back then talking and saying there's the Pentecostals today I say there's the message believers there's a lot of them so much as Matthew 20 24 said it deceived the very elect in the last days if it were possible continue on next slide and then the life comes out of that denomination goes into the grain then what happens when the grain begins to grow and it gets bigger so it can cover over something the denomination pulls away from it and you see that's what's happening right now there's a there's a season that we are now going through that there's that there's message Believers pulling away from message believers there's a time where the grain where God now is ripening that grain so much that everything else the the life because it's a denominational Spirit remember the same that white horse rider we can't get into go back and read the Seven Seals but that white horse rider that continued to ride and now is that Pale Horse he's riding right within the ranks of this message and the only way that he's deceived the people is the same way that he's always deceived the people he injects his own interpretation into the word of God and gets people listening to man instead of listening to the voice of God and still allow and instead of allowing the five-fold ministry which is the supernatural Christ himself operating through the five-fold through preachers in this hour right now right here speaking to individuals and giving them inspiration and teaching them what they're who they are why they've been called what their position in the word is and how you're coming into the maturity now for the rapture that denominational Spirit it starts to pull away not because it's pulling away it's because you're pulling away it's drying up it dies it dies remember without the Holy Spirit you've got no message I don't care how much you quote brother Branham I don't care how much you know every single message that he preached in every single quote if the spirit of God is an anointing you to give you the revelation of what he was meaning when he was speaking those quotes and it was the spirit of God by Revelation speaking the understanding into the Sons and Daughters of God if you're not catching that spirit all you are is an intellectual Theologian of this message that's it it takes the spirit of God to give you understanding on what it is that's being revealed through the five-fold ministry and you cannot be deceived you cannot be deceived if you're a seed attribute of God you are ordained to receive this they never will it's the grain it can't go no further we're at the end time Hallelujah what does it have to do now lay in the presence of the sun to be ripened that's exactly the word to be ripened into your heart to bring forth and live what we're talking about right here right now I'm going to start to wind this down next Ephesians parallels Joshua and remember they had to eat manna Angel's food out of Heaven until they crossed over into the land God was giving them spiritual food God was giving them what they had need of while they were in the wilderness God was supernaturally out of nowhere nothing that they had to do nothing that they had to put on they didn't have to do nothing God just fed them and when they crossed over into the land the Manna ceased to fall see now it was a different dispensation now they had to come into their own walk with God now it was no longer just oh Lord give me this give me that oh I'm going to get my food the Lord's already dropped it I can go pick it up no now there's something that you need to do now there's a life that you need to live now there's a portion of the word that you need to fulfill remember this bride she she comes into maturity for a purpose you're not being matured to just get lazier you know like you know like you like you know like the boss of a company as the company grows and gets stronger and builds up and all the money's pouring in and the bank accounts are all full you start to notice the big belly start to come out he's relaxing more he's not doing much anything he's not doing anything anymore that's not what we're talking about here that's not the way it is with the bride this is the time where you come into your Joshua commission it's the Ephesians commission it's the time where you got to take the land God's given you everything you need God's Justified you Sanctified you given you everything that you have need of put a sword right on your side but if you don't use that sword you're going to get your head taken off you see you've got to know that you are maturing for a purpose when they crossed it ceased to fall they were fully matured then and they eat the old corn of the land now now you're not babies anymore now that you're not Desiring the sincere milk of the Gospel that you don't have to be babied and patted and persuaded to come to church now that you're really fully matured Christians you're ready to eat strong meat now you're ready to come into something he said you're ready to to understand something that's deep and Rich this is what we're feasting on right now it's not easy to swallow that Christ is in you it's not easy to swallow that that the mighty Angel has come down right now moving in the five-fold ministry speaking the word of God speaking life into your walks calling you into the resurrection calling you and placing You positionally by adoption into the word of gods because you have a purpose you have a plan you have a destiny you can't this is not the time to give up this is the time that you've got to keep Crossing amen next slide he says but you have noticed that this has been sweeping for 20 years now brother Brown said that back in 1965 when he preached the Rapture he says you'll never denominate this he was talking about that that this is not something this is the supernatural this is the strong meat that we're talking about now this is the element where you take your position where you recognize that you are the word you are the word made flesh in this vein in this hour you are the interpretation of the word of God in this vein in this hour God is going to interpret his own word around your life God is going to do Supernatural things around your life as you become aware and mature and recognize that you are no longer just just a church but you are the bride you are the wife this is not a church age anymore this is the bride's age Hallelujah but have you noticed this has been sweeping now for 20 years now there's no organization and they'll never be this is the end the Wheats come back to the wheat again and I say to you church this morning that the wheat is coming into full maturity that it might be gathered into the Garner that there's a people that God is maturing in this Dane in this hour to place into their positions in Authority listen we go in a Rapture but remember we're being trained and we are being given character for a purpose because after three and a half year uh honeymoon the time that we go and we go in the Rapture for three and a half years this whole world goes into chaos for three and a half years but guess what you're coming back if you're an attribute of God you're coming back and you're coming back to rule for another Thousand Years there's just so much that's going on Saints but we need to realize God wants to mature us and get us ready and be mentally under the right expectation the Wheats come back to its grain the shuck has pulled away from it and the wheat must lay in the presence of the sun let the musicians come to be ripened next slide Jesus counts character he counts character not members sure we want to see people being saved sure we want to see people receiving the word and that's our purpose and that you should be out there and all you need to do is just give him your testimony let them know what the Lord's done in your life that's all you need to do you don't need to tell them what they need to believe and that they they need to believe this or they need to believe that just give them your testimony let them know what God did for you and something inside there if the Lord is speaking to their heart there's something there they will awaken they will recognize just like when you received it he's the same yesterday today and forever he says Jesus counts character not members you know that he counts characters not all that say Lord Lord but the one that doeth the will of my father not he that starts it's he that finishes Hallelujah let's bow our heads father thank you for your word thank you for the inspiration Lord thank you for doing something in each and every heart here this morning Lord I know that you're so mindful and you
