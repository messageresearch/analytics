[9:57] it's not only we know that Jesus didn't
[10:06] see me verse 20 says and when he saw
[10:10] there they were so determined to get to
[10:15] Jesus so they come when he saw their
[10:44] faith he said it's a man I said to
[10:46] forgive me
[10:48] the Pharisees scribes said they begin to
[10:52] reason thing was when Jesus perceived
[11:07] their thoughts the answering said unto
[11:10] them what recently in your heart whether
[11:11] teachers say that forgiving it which
[11:13] they rise up and walk were that you may
[11:15] notice on man that power on earth to
[11:17] forgive sins he's actually in the street
