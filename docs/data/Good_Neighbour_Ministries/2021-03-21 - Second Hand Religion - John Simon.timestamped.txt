[1:28] to 17 thank god for all the old warriors
[1:34] preachers men of god anointed by the
[1:36] holy spirit
[1:38] that god used in the past
[1:41] for his glory and now this is our day
[1:46] let us read from the word of god
[1:51] and god wrought special
[1:54] miracles by the hands of paul
[1:58] so that from his body were brought
[2:02] unto the sick and kerchiefs
[2:06] or aprons and the diseases
[2:10] departed from them
[2:13] and the evil spirits went
[2:16] out of them then
[2:20] certain of the vagabond
[2:23] jews exorcists
[2:27] took upon them to call
[2:30] over them which had evil spirits
[2:34] the name of the lord jesus
[2:38] saying we are jordy
[2:42] by jesus whom paul preached
[2:47] and they were seven sons of skiva
[2:51] a jew and chief of the priests
[2:54] which did so and the evil spirit
[2:57] answered and said jesus i know
[3:01] paul i know but who
[3:04] are you and the man in whom the evil
[3:08] spirit was
[3:09] leapt upon them and overcame them and
[3:12] prevailed against them
[3:15] so that they fled out of the
[3:18] house naked and wounded
[3:22] and this was known to all the jews and
[3:24] greeks also dwelling at ephesus
[3:27] and fear fell upon them
[3:30] all and the name of the lord jesus
[3:35] was magnified praise

[3:56] that even you know i preach
[4:00] hard the word of god and i make it plain
[4:04] to you that the denominations
[4:07] are dead their day has
[4:10] passed their hour has slipped
[4:14] away but truly the true
[4:17] church the elected of god
[4:21] the true church is alive and well
[4:24] i want to say to you my friends
[4:28] that the true church is still victorious
[4:32] she is still triumphant and she
[4:35] is still marching on in the name of
[4:39] jesus christ

[4:43] the living god
[4:45] is alive amen hallelujah
[4:48] glory listen the church hasn't
[4:52] gone to to seed
[4:57] and the church hasn't gone to pot
[5:01] the church has not gone to crack
[5:05] the church has not gone to to to any
[5:09] drugs
[5:10] or drink or drifted off from
[5:13] the original world i'm speaking about
[5:16] the bride i'm speaking about elected
[5:20] this sermon is into individuals that
[5:24] they would
[5:24] recognize that the genuine church
[5:28] not the denominational church not the
[5:30] nominal church
[5:32] not the high church but the true
[5:35] genuine church of jesus christ
[5:38] amen is alive

[5:58] the members are not backsliding
[6:03] amen they're not giving up
[6:08] they're not compromising with the world
[6:12] and despite all the corvid that we see
[6:17] running moving around in our society
[6:21] despite the fact that we as believers
[6:25] have to march through this hot dry
[6:29] weary land of the modern day wilderness
[6:33] of
[6:33] sin felt lies deceit
[6:38] and manipulations my friends even
[6:41] then i want you to know the church has
[6:45] not
[6:46] failed the church has not fainted
[6:49] but the true elect of the living god is
[6:52] gathering strength and she is alive
[6:55] today
[6:56] more than she ever was thanks be to god
[6:59] hallelujah
[7:00] there are still some that are praying
[7:05] there are others that are fasting
[7:10] and yet others they're living right
[7:13] today
[7:14] they're living godly in a godless world
[7:18] they're living pure in the midst
[7:21] of mystery babylon hallelujah
[7:25] i believe it and i preach it and i
[7:27] accept it
[7:28] and i experience it that the truth
[7:31] church still has
[7:33] holy ghost power to meet the challenges
[7:36] of this evil wicked hour in which we are
[7:40] living in i want to thank god he has not
[7:44] left the church alone by herself
[7:47] in the end time he has not left her
[7:51] in this little decian darkness
[7:54] of the midnight hour but he promised he
[7:58] will be with us to the very end of the
[8:02] age
[8:02] and i am happy to announce to you
[8:06] that even though we are suffering
[8:09] from a spiritual blackout of the church
[8:13] ages
[8:14] yet we are now entered into the new day
[8:18] we are entered into a new time we are
[8:21] entered
[8:22] under the inspiration of the of the lord
[8:25] jesus himself the covenant angel
[8:29] that put his one foot on the land and
[8:32] one on the sea and says time
[8:35] shall be no more in other words the
[8:38] church ages
[8:40] are over the time for them is
[8:43] no more they're over they're done with
[8:46] they're gone and now the that man
[8:50] that woman that will walk into
[8:53] the eternal church age that begins
[8:57] with the ending of the seals hallelujah
[9:00] praise god i believe we are in that day
[9:04] and in that hour right now praise god
[9:08] never mind the bible says
[9:12] evil men seducers will wax
[9:15] worse and worse all manner of wickedness
[9:20] on the face of the earth but praise god
[9:23] the church today in this hour
[9:27] i know it may your mind might think
[9:30] different but let me tell you the truth
[9:32] because
[9:33] of the abundance of truth the revelation
[9:37] of the word that has come in this hour
[9:41] not the one man paul who then gave it
[9:44] to some others and the church of god
[9:47] took off in the first
[9:48] age but we are now in the fruit
[9:52] time the harvest time of god's bride
[9:56] tree
[9:56] and the fruit of the word has come to
[9:59] its
[10:00] mellow richness for the children of god
[10:03] and to feed their hearts and their souls
[10:06] with
[10:07] light life and power so the true
[10:10] church is here praise god bringing
[10:13] victory bringing victory and deliverance
[10:17] to mankind today if they will care to
[10:21] turn their hearts and minds toward jesus
[10:24] christ i want to tell you friends
[10:26] the move is on the move is on
[10:30] praise god hallelujah the move is on the
[10:35] song said my lord the move is on
[10:38] i can hear the rustling in the mulberry
[10:41] trees
[10:42] and i know i know i know the move is on
[10:46] hallelujah praise god the move is on
[10:50] yes friends but when we say the move is
[10:53] on
[10:54] then we find out friends
[10:58] that even though we have seen
[11:02] spectacular deliverances
[11:07] we have seen mighty miracles
[11:11] we have seen great earth earth-shaking
[11:14] supernatural events taking place
[11:17] hallelujah but it is not
[11:21] always that way but it seems as if the
[11:26] modern church and even many
[11:29] of the modern message believers
[11:32] seem to believe that it has to be
[11:36] with a a rash or rush of
[11:40] supernatural events before
[11:43] it is the real church of god
[11:46] but that is not so my friends
[11:50] the modern church believers of this day
[11:55] even of this message they believe
[11:59] that the a real move of god is is a mass
[12:02] meeting or convention with miracles
[12:06] and signs and and wonders
[12:10] when in reality a real
[12:13] move of god is calling out the elect
[12:17] for that certain area
[12:20] in which they are let me give you an
[12:24] example jesus down
[12:27] in israel was having a great revival
[12:33] and as the revival was growing
[12:36] he suddenly said to his disciples
[12:39] i must needs go through some area
[12:44] and there it was he left a great
[12:47] mass meeting of multitudes
[12:51] and went and sat upon a well
[12:55] to meet one elected seed of god
[12:59] may it be that you are one of god's
[13:02] elect today
[13:03] may be that your god's daughter to dan
[13:07] and god's spirit is calling may you
[13:10] maybe you are god's son and god
[13:13] is reaching out to you in particular
[13:16] today to call you back to himself
[13:20] and back to his word oh glory to god
[13:24] hallelujah amen so
[13:27] there it was that god jesus
[13:31] went out and waited on the well
[13:35] just to reach one woman you see my
[13:38] friends
[13:39] that was a mighty move of god
[13:43] for god's real moving
[13:46] is to call out his elect
[13:50] for that certain area whether
[13:53] it be one or ten
[13:56] or ten thousand that
[13:59] moving of god to call them out
[14:02] that is the real move of god
[14:06] amen for in the non-seed there is
[14:10] nothing to to be reborn
[14:13] there is nothing to revive there is
[14:16] nothing to bring to life
[14:18] anymore oh praise god but this
[14:21] has come to magnetize
[14:25] to germa ties and to wake up the seed of
[14:28] god for this day
[14:31] and in this hour i'm going now down
[14:35] into the book of acts and there
[14:38] i can see philip in samaria
[14:42] great meetings great healings
[14:46] miracles taking place signs and
[14:49] wonders or shaking oh praise
[14:53] god but in the middle of it the bible
[14:55] says
[14:56] and the spirit hand of the lord
[15:00] was upon philip and the spirit of god
[15:03] picked him up amen and
[15:07] moved him and took him to a wilderness
[15:10] desert
[15:10] glory to god hallelujah when philip
[15:14] came to himself philip found that he was
[15:18] in the wilderness and there was a
[15:21] chariot
[15:21] passing by with an african an ethiopian
[15:26] with his bible open and he was
[15:29] reading out of his bible and philip said
[15:33] do you understand what you're reading
[15:36] and the man said how can i understand
[15:40] unless one would teach me or show me
[15:44] and there philip preached jesus christ
[15:47] hallelujah
[15:48] and when he heard the opening of the
[15:50] word and he heard the reality
[15:53] of what god has done the bible said
[15:57] that the man said there is water there
[16:00] what hinders me to be baptized and
[16:03] philip baptize him in the name of the
[16:06] lord
[16:07] you see my friends one soul
[16:10] is worth more than a world
[16:13] and god counts his children his elected
[16:18] seed
[16:19] as his precious jewels and even he has
[16:22] to leave a
[16:23] mass meeting with multitudes of people
[16:27] who praise god who may be healed maybe
[16:30] say
[16:31] may be healed may be delivered in
[16:32] various ways
[16:34] but his heart is on his elect
[16:37] even one in an area
[16:41] in other areas there may be five ten
[16:44] hundred hundred and twenty five hundred
[16:47] a thousand two thousand five thousand we
[16:50] don't know
[16:51] but a real genuine move of god
[16:55] is to call out god's elect
[16:59] for that particular area
[17:02] a lot of people even in this message
[17:07] still do not understand what
[17:10] is meant by greater works than these
[17:13] shall ye do
[17:14] they do not understand that it is the
[17:18] entire bright body of christ
[17:22] that will to together do those
[17:25] greater works and it does not
[17:29] mean that individually
[17:32] each one of us is going to do
[17:36] great spectacular works
[17:39] that will astonish the entire
[17:42] world amen praise god
[17:46] hallelujah i want you to see
[17:49] that the real move of god sometimes
[17:52] is not with all the attractions
[17:56] spectacular things that will
[18:00] feed your flesh and attract your mind or
[18:04] your attention like that but the spirit
[18:07] of god sometimes
[18:08] moves so so softly so quietly
[18:12] that if you're not watching
[18:15] you you'll count it off you you're
[18:17] brushing the side and
[18:19] and the spirit of god will just make his
[18:23] quietly his way away this gentle
[18:26] dove of peace amen spirit of god
[18:31] will move without great fanfare
[18:36] great noise hallelujah
[18:40] sometimes the spirit of god
[18:44] will move in such a way it will astonish
[18:48] you
[18:49] maybe while i'm yet speaking the word
[18:52] as in the bible it says
[18:55] acts chapter 10 verse 44
[18:59] while peter yet speak those words
[19:03] the holy spirit fell on
[19:06] all them which heard
[19:10] the word not just hearing with the ears
[19:14] but those who heard the word
[19:17] and recognize what they were hearing
[19:21] my friends let me say this i preached
[19:24] the word of god
[19:25] and seen it where once
[19:29] while preaching a gentleman was sitting
[19:32] in the congregation
[19:34] and as the word went forth with power
[19:38] the holy spirit wanted to confirm his
[19:42] word and here was the gentleman with a
[19:46] cancer in his truth
[19:48] and as the word went forth it seems the
[19:51] devil got
[19:52] scared and he just
[19:55] and before you know it that catcher was
[19:58] crossed up and was right there on the
[20:01] floor
[20:02] the people screamed and shouted because
[20:05] they saw the hand of god
[20:07] it had nothing to do with me but the
[20:10] spirit of god was
[20:12] on the scene friends and sometimes he
[20:15] moves
[20:16] in such a quiet way without any
[20:20] fanfare without any spectacular stuff
[20:24] like that
[20:25] and he moves like that and it's a very
[20:29] wonderful heartwarming move
[20:32] of the living god i want to say to you
[20:34] again
[20:36] the true church the elect lady
[20:42] the church the bride of christ is alive
[20:46] and well and she is more powerful
[20:50] in this end time than
[20:53] even the earlier ages of the church
[20:57] you see but i don't see this i don't see
[20:59] that i don't see the other
[21:01] oh that's what thomas said if i don't
[21:04] see the wounds if i don't see this i
[21:06] don't see that
[21:08] oh my but when he got a spiritual
[21:11] revenant
[21:12] revelation of who it really was
[21:16] oh he said my lord and my god hallelujah
[21:20] no more i've got to push my hands and
[21:24] touch you or feel it before i believe it
[21:26] no he believed to see the
[21:30] very glory of the living god
[21:33] amen hallelujah man makes water pumps
[21:38] and they're pumping their night with a
[21:42] whole lot of noise
[21:44] and carrying on a lot of noise like that
[21:48] but then god just lets the sun come out
[21:52] and the sun in some hours
[21:55] pulls millions of gallons of water
[21:59] right back into the sky with no
[22:02] noise no attraction nobody
[22:05] noticing anything but millions of
[22:08] gallons of water
[22:10] dries up from the earth and is drawn
[22:13] right
[22:13] back up into heavens you see god
[22:16] moves in a mysterious way his
[22:20] wonders to perform he plants his
[22:23] footsteps on the sea
[22:25] and he rides upon the storm
[22:28] now look at it man has something called
[22:31] generators
[22:33] and they will have these generators
[22:36] working
[22:37] and again a whole nother noise
[22:40] generating
[22:41] electricity generating light and
[22:44] generating power like that
[22:47] but watch the same sun just comes out
[22:51] and it just comes out that's it and it
[22:54] lights up
[22:55] not a building not a city the
[22:58] entire world is lit up
[23:01] by the light of the sun with no noise
[23:05] now look at me look how i'm shining look
[23:08] how bright i
[23:09] am look how look look at me no the sun
[23:12] just does its job and it just shines the
[23:16] light
[23:16] and it's brighter than anything you've
[23:20] ever
[23:20] seen before without any noise
[23:24] without any fanfare anything of that
[23:29] matter i want to tell you the church
[23:32] still has
[23:33] power amen for greater is he
[23:36] that is in you than he that is in
[23:40] the world and i'm glad to know
[23:43] that this church has caught the
[23:46] revelation
[23:47] of this last prophet's message
[23:51] and this this church is a is a
[23:54] conquering church
[23:55] this church is a triumphant church
[23:59] this church is a vibrant church this
[24:02] church is a victorious church you are a
[24:05] victorious son of god
[24:07] you're a victorious child of the king
[24:09] glory to god hallelujah
[24:12] amen praise god hallelujah
[24:15] i want to thank god that the devil
[24:18] will never triumph over the true church
[24:22] because even in this last day
[24:26] we are equipped to meet the challenge of
[24:29] the hour
[24:30] we're equipped by the living god you say
[24:33] brother simon
[24:34] what do you mean we are equipped well
[24:37] god has
[24:38] set the prophet according to the
[24:40] prophecies of
[24:42] malachi 4 5 and that
[24:45] prophet has brought a message
[24:48] and stored up spiritual food for
[24:52] us to eat in its right our
[24:55] jew season glory to god hallelujah
[24:59] but we are equipped to meet any
[25:01] challenge
[25:02] of this age and of this time
[25:06] in which we live hallelujah or praise
[25:09] god that generation back there
[25:13] the devil challenged them and the devil
[25:17] is here again
[25:18] in our time to challenge
[25:22] this generation amen
[25:26] we look at the devil and the
[25:29] the same question that he asked the sons
[25:32] of skeva
[25:34] he's asking the church world again today
[25:37] amen hallelujah who are you
[25:43] where is your faith
[25:46] amen have you got your own faith
[25:50] or are you relying on somebody else's
[25:54] faith
[25:56] oh take god i'm not
[25:59] i'm here to preach to the individual
[26:03] i'm here to preach to the true sons and
[26:06] daughters
[26:07] of the living god hallelujah
[26:12] and each one of us has got to
[26:15] respond to this challenge of satan
[26:19] individually individually
[26:23] we got to give an answer to the devil's
[26:26] question that he is asking of us
[26:30] of who are you amen
[26:34] now listen there were having a great
[26:38] revival
[26:39] down in ephesus and the power of
[26:43] god was moving everywhere
[26:46] signs wonders as we read in our text
[26:50] the bible tells us mighty miracles hand
[26:55] courtships from the body of paul
[26:58] and their people were being delivered
[27:02] and it shook the entire city
[27:05] and shook the entire countryside
[27:08] great things were happening god was
[27:12] demonstrating himself in a tremendous
[27:15] way
[27:16] and it became the talk of the town
[27:19] if they had newspapers it would have
[27:21] been in the newspapers
[27:22] it would have been all over the internet
[27:24] but this was the
[27:26] talk of the tongue at that time
[27:29] amen hallelujah and while paul was
[27:32] ministering
[27:34] oftentimes he'd come against
[27:36] demon-possessed
[27:37] people and he would say in the name of
[27:39] jesus christ
[27:41] come out of her or come out of him or
[27:44] come out of the child
[27:46] loose the woman satan in the name of
[27:48] jesus christ
[27:50] hallelujah now these vagabond
[27:53] jews they were jews but they were
[27:56] vagabonds
[27:57] amen see there's a lot of christians
[28:01] they're christian but they're vagabond
[28:03] christians
[28:04] because watch they were
[28:07] going at the edge of the meeting
[28:11] and watching everything paul did
[28:16] and the bible tells us
[28:19] these men were exhausted in other words
[28:23] they were ones who believed they could
[28:26] cast
[28:27] out devils without the name of jesus
[28:30] without the authority and the power of
[28:34] jesus
[28:35] amen and so
[28:38] these men hearing paul and seeing
[28:42] paul's effectiveness of his ministry
[28:46] they realized that paul was
[28:50] often using the mighty name of jesus
[28:54] hallelujah oh praise god and so
[28:58] they felt oh that is his secret
[29:02] amen his secret is in
[29:05] the those words in the name
[29:08] of jesus christ hallelujah oh
[29:12] praise god oh we got it now
[29:15] here is this man come to town
[29:18] he has got a brand new spell that we can
[29:22] use
[29:23] there's a man that has a magic word
[29:27] that we all can go and make some
[29:31] money from we can go out there and start
[29:34] a
[29:35] ministry we can go out there
[29:38] with that with those words of that name
[29:41] with our witchcraft and wizardry and we
[29:45] can have a great
[29:46] marvelous wonderful time amen
[29:50] hallelujah all mine praise god
[29:54] they were convinced because every time
[29:58] paul rebuked the devil the devil didn't
[30:01] argue
[30:02] the devil just took off the devil just
[30:05] screamed and come out of the people that
[30:08] were bound by him and while i'm speaking
[30:11] and you're listening may the devil loose
[30:14] you right now
[30:16] may the sick be healed now oh receive
[30:20] deliverance as you believe
[30:22] god's word hallelujah may the great holy
[30:25] spirit
[30:26] break the spell of sin across your life
[30:29] the habits that hold you set you free
[30:32] now
[30:33] every spirit of drug and drink alcohol
[30:36] smoke nicotine loose the children of the
[30:40] king
[30:40] glory to god in the name of jesus christ
[30:44] for
[30:44] at the name of jesus every knee shall
[30:47] bow
[30:48] every town shall confess that jesus
[30:51] christ is lord hallelujah amen
[30:54] praise god hallelujah amen
[30:58] so these vagabonds
[31:01] these vagabond jewels they decided
[31:05] they were going to use the new uh
[31:09] incantation the new magic word
[31:13] they're going to use paul's spell
[31:17] you know in the name of jesus in the
[31:19] name of jesus
[31:20] all they got to do is use the name
[31:24] of jesus this new uh
[31:27] you know collection of magic words
[31:31] they added to their vocabulary so that
[31:34] they could
[31:35] use it amen now these seven sons of
[31:39] skiva
[31:42] they were the sons of the priests of the
[31:45] chief priest i don't know if there were
[31:48] like the sons of eli
[31:51] uh misbehaving
[31:54] but the bible said vagabond jews
[31:59] you see all my friends
[32:04] so they went out and found
[32:08] a fellow that was possessed of the devil
[32:12] and thought they would now try
[32:16] out their new smell on this
[32:20] man with the devil and so
[32:24] they gathered around him i can see them
[32:28] as they gather around that man for now
[32:32] they're gonna use the magic word
[32:35] they're gonna use paul's spell that
[32:38] was magic words in the name of jesus
[32:42] christ hallelujah
[32:44] amen and so they came to him
[32:48] and they tried out by giving him
[32:52] praise god hallelujah they said
[32:55] oh my friends we're going to say it
[32:58] exactly the way that paul said it
[33:04] and as long as we say it the way that
[33:07] prophet
[33:07] said it that devil has to go
[33:12] oh my my my they felt they really had it
[33:17] they really got the secret they feel
[33:19] they were really on to
[33:21] something if they only repeated
[33:26] pirated oh my the
[33:29] words of the prophet paul
[33:33] amen now remember brother branham said
[33:38] i said and preached to you exactly
[33:42] what paul preached amen
[33:45] and he could say nothing different to
[33:47] paul but paul
[33:48] said even if i were to come back and say
[33:52] something different to what i'm saying
[33:54] even if an
[33:55] angel came down from heaven and tried to
[33:58] tell you something
[33:59] different from what i am saying let him
[34:02] be accursed
[34:03] for he was the apostle the messenger the
[34:06] prophet
[34:07] for that first age amen alpha
[34:11] omega and now we see the same thing
[34:15] the sons of skiva jews these are
[34:19] christians some of them are message
[34:21] believers
[34:22] they are followers of this prophet's
[34:24] message
[34:25] and they believe they'll defeat the
[34:28] devil
[34:29] they'll cast out the devil they'll have
[34:31] victory
[34:32] and they'll be able to overcome by just
[34:35] going and saying what the prophet paul
[34:39] said
[34:40] or what our prophet brother branham said
[34:43] by just quoting his words or
[34:46] reading or by saying the words
[34:50] and it but the devil will tremble and
[34:53] just
[34:53] come out of the people
[34:57] oh my this is exactly what paul preached
[35:01] what are you saying brother simon
[35:03] this is what brother branham preached oh
[35:06] how could you say that
[35:07] this is what he said here he said say
[35:10] what i
[35:11] said oh hallelujah you gotta understand
[35:14] what he meant when he said
[35:16] says that say what i said oh my
[35:19] lord hallelujah oh praise god
[35:22] so they began to cry out to this man
[35:25] that was
[35:26] possessed with devils and said we are
[35:29] jordy
[35:31] by jesus whom paul preached
[35:34] amen oh brother brangham said this
[35:37] brother branham said the other
[35:39] brother branham said this over here
[35:41] brother branham said that those men must
[35:43] have said
[35:44] and paul said this and paul said that
[35:46] and paul said
[35:48] i assure thee but jesus
[35:52] amen whom brother branham preached whom
[35:56] paul preached and you know what
[36:01] it did stir up the devil but the devil
[36:04] got
[36:04] mad not because
[36:07] of them using the name of jesus but they
[36:10] kind of
[36:11] showed some disrespect for him thinking
[36:13] he's a fool
[36:14] or or he doesn't know what's really
[36:17] happening
[36:18] in the spirit realm and the devil
[36:21] spoke to them and
[36:25] spun around and looked at every one of
[36:28] them
[36:30] and turned and said yes
[36:33] jesus i know
[36:38] i met him at galilee
[36:42] i met him in many a meeting when he was
[36:45] preaching in galilee
[36:47] he cast me out from many
[36:51] bodies many cripples
[36:54] many blind deaf dumb possessed
[36:58] he cast me out so jesus
[37:02] i know i know him in galilee
[37:06] yes i know him
[37:09] because i met him again
[37:13] in the garden of gethsemane
[37:16] and we had a wrestling match there he
[37:19] prayed all night
[37:21] and we wrestled in a titanic battle
[37:26] we wrestled until he was sweating blood
[37:30] what a battle that was and
[37:33] uh but i know jesus and so
[37:37] the devil began to speak to them
[37:40] and said yes and know him in galilee and
[37:43] know him and gets heavenly
[37:45] and i know him and go on go
[37:48] got his hill and there
[37:52] one got his heel my friends
[37:57] that killed him but they didn't know
[38:00] that his spirit was still
[38:03] fighting with me darkness covered the
[38:07] land
[38:08] midday the sun was blooded out
[38:12] for here we were engaged in the greatest
[38:15] battle ever fought
[38:18] lightning flashed the thunder rolled
[38:21] we were at war it was a contest between
[38:25] me and god between jesus christ
[38:28] hallelujah
[38:29] and me oh my for the souls of
[38:32] man because all those prophets all the
[38:35] patriots before
[38:37] i held them in my grip i had them
[38:41] and so we fought our way all the way
[38:44] from golgotha right down into
[38:48] gehenna we fought our way to the prison
[38:52] house of hell
[38:53] and there he took the keys of
[38:56] death hell and the grave away from me oh
[39:00] please god hallelujah oh all my
[39:03] friends and open the prison doors and
[39:07] let
[39:07] out all of my captives and the next
[39:11] morning
[39:11] he came out and all the gravestone
[39:16] rolled back and out of that grave he
[39:19] stepped out
[39:20] and said i am the resurrection and the
[39:23] life oh praise god hallelujah
[39:27] my friend i tell you i know jesus
[39:32] so that devil let them know
[39:36] that he really knew jesus
[39:40] and he said yes jesus i know
[39:44] and paul i know him too
[39:49] because i met paul in the deserts of
[39:54] arabia
[39:56] there for five years i tested him
[39:59] attempted him
[40:01] like i did with jesus on the mountain
[40:04] oh of in a time of temptation
[40:08] i met paul up tested him
[40:11] attempted him i fought with him
[40:14] we had many a battle in the deserts
[40:17] of arabia oh praise god i tell you
[40:21] friends
[40:22] what a battle that was but then
[40:25] paul had to leave the desert
[40:28] and come by the command of god into
[40:31] ministry and later on
[40:35] we can hear that devil just like he said
[40:40] i know jesus amen
[40:44] and you know that's the truth how when
[40:46] jesus was walking on the street
[40:48] the devils would scream out i know thee
[40:51] who thou
[40:51] art that want the holy one of god
[40:55] amen praise god the man at gadara said
[40:58] the same thing
[40:59] i know you who you are oh my
[41:02] art thou come to cast us out before the
[41:05] time
[41:05] you see the devil knew jesus
[41:08] and in the same way the devil knew paul
[41:11] so it's a paul i know because when
[41:15] paul had the great battle in philippi
[41:19] when that woman would wha with the
[41:21] spirit of divination
[41:23] would follow him around everywhere he
[41:26] went
[41:26] and the devil said i know you i know you
[41:30] you are the servant of the most high god
[41:33] hallelujah
[41:35] you know the story paul cast that devil
[41:37] out
[41:38] after a while but the fact i am making
[41:42] is that the devil knew jesus
[41:46] and the devil knew paul
[41:50] amen but the devil wants to know who are
[41:55] you
[41:56] the one the devil wants to know if
[41:59] you're a real christian
[42:02] what is back of your words are you just
[42:06] speaking words
[42:08] or is there a life behind the name that
[42:11] makes the
[42:11] demons tremble oh praise the wonderful
[42:15] name of our blessed lord jesus
[42:18] hallelujah
[42:19] amen oh praise god hallelujah
[42:23] amen all they had
[42:26] those seven sons gave ahaz like some
[42:29] christians today have
[42:30] like some message believers have all
[42:32] they have
[42:33] was the words and the name
[42:38] of a person amen
[42:42] hallelujah they heard the name
[42:47] that somebody else used they heard the
[42:51] words
[42:52] that somebody else used but they didn't
[42:55] have the authority
[42:57] they did not have that anointing they
[43:00] did not have the reality
[43:02] of the power and the presence of god
[43:04] flowing through their lives
[43:06] for the devil to recognize that they
[43:09] were one they and their father are one
[43:13] amen hallelujah oh praise
[43:16] god there they were they heard paul
[43:19] preaching
[43:21] many heard brother branham preaching
[43:24] amen but yet they don't know who they
[43:28] are but they may know who he is they may
[43:32] be able to explain to you who
[43:33] he is why god sent him and
[43:37] what his job was what the prophecies say
[43:40] but they don't know who they are in the
[43:44] word of god
[43:45] they have no recognition of their
[43:48] position
[43:49] in the in the body of christ and their
[43:52] placing
[43:53] of who god has placed and their purpose
[43:56] of why god has placed them here upon the
[43:59] earth
[44:00] to walk work out his divine
[44:03] will amen yes i believe today
[44:07] the devil in this generation will say
[44:10] ah jesus i know paul i know
[44:15] william branham oh i know him
[44:18] i met him when he was just a baby
[44:22] in a cabin oh and i was about to
[44:26] freeze him and his mother to death
[44:29] but then here comes a holy fire of god
[44:33] flowing into the window and come into
[44:36] that place
[44:37] and i had to run for my life oh i know
[44:41] william branham oh my i know him
[44:44] because i met him in many a meeting
[44:48] especially up there in that meeting up
[44:51] there in chicago
[44:53] oh i brought i went up there with 400 of
[44:56] my prophets
[44:58] to meet him and in the name of jesus
[45:01] christ
[45:02] he defeated us and he cast out every
[45:05] devil
[45:06] by his word for the glory of god so
[45:09] william branham i know hallelujah
[45:13] but friends let me say to you
[45:17] in the name of jesus christ the
[45:20] devil is not afraid
[45:25] of brother william marion branham
[45:28] today let me repeat
[45:32] the devil is not afraid
[45:35] of brother william branham
[45:39] today for he has
[45:43] moved off the scene
[45:47] moses my servant is dead
[45:53] william branham is dead
[45:56] now joshua rise you must go over this
[46:00] jordan now joshua rise up
[46:04] you must make the crossing oh
[46:07] praise god hallelujah blessed be the
[46:10] name of the lord
[46:11] and so my friends he has gone off the
[46:15] scene
[46:17] and the devil is not afraid
[46:20] of brother branham
[46:25] and so we must become very
[46:29] conscious of where we stand today
[46:34] because every generation must
[46:37] face this challenge other than the
[46:40] devil will challenge every person
[46:43] and every generation as to their
[46:47] position and their confession of this
[46:50] word of the living god hallelujah
[46:54] amen praise god if you want to have
[46:58] what brother branham had none of us will
[47:01] ever
[47:02] have the fullness of what he had
[47:05] but we are sparks off of the anvil we'll
[47:08] have
[47:09] some we'll have a bit we'll have a
[47:11] little here a little there
[47:13] each one will have something off of what
[47:16] he had
[47:17] and what he had was the blessed holy
[47:21] spirit the pill of fire that followed
[47:24] moses followed the churn of israel the
[47:26] pillar of fire that
[47:28] appeared in his meetings the pillar of
[47:30] fair
[47:31] that was over there in jamaica the
[47:34] pillar of fair that was in south africa
[47:36] switzerland
[47:37] oh praise god and many other places
[47:40] where the fire of god appeared and the
[47:43] power of the holy spirit
[47:45] penetrated the hearts lies minds and
[47:47] bodies
[47:48] of the people and set them free by the
[47:51] spoken
[47:52] word which is the original seed of the
[47:55] living god but if we want to have some
[47:57] of what we have we got to pray like he
[47:59] prayed
[48:01] amen we got to believe god's word
[48:05] like he believed amen praise
[48:08] god hallelujah and if we are going to
[48:11] stand like man of god
[48:13] we got to preach like he preached
[48:15] without fear
[48:17] without favor and in faith for the glory
[48:20] of the name of our lord jesus christ
[48:23] hallelujah
[48:24] amen praise god we got to
[48:27] live the kind of loving
[48:31] overcoming life that he
[48:34] lived also friends praise god
[48:38] hallelujah or else my friends
[48:41] when you try to use the name of jesus
[48:47] that name of jesus
[48:51] will not be effective
[48:54] in your on your lips
[48:57] coming from your mouth or from your
[49:00] heart
[49:02] because faith is not inherited
[49:07] you cannot inherit convictions
[49:11] you can't inherit relationships with god
[49:16] that is supernaturally given from the
[49:19] presence of almighty god
[49:21] blessed is the man the woman whom i
[49:24] invite to approach unto me hallelujah
[49:28] all the people of today believe that
[49:31] they
[49:32] choose him not realizing he has to
[49:35] choose you
[49:36] amen blessed is the person whom he
[49:39] chooses to approach unto him
[49:43] and to receive his blessed word
[49:46] hallelujah amen so my friends
[49:50] right from the cabin
[49:53] to chicago and to the car crash
[49:57] the devil will say yes i know him
[50:00] and know him right through his entire
[50:04] life but who are you where do you come
[50:07] from
[50:07] with what authority are you uh
[50:11] speaking or rebuking or praying
[50:14] or or whatever it is
[50:17] in whose name do you come glory to god
[50:20] hallelujah
[50:21] amen because the life the the name
[50:25] is doesn't mean anything there are many
[50:28] jesuses
[50:29] over there in mexico there are many
[50:31] jesuses in hispania
[50:33] there's many jesuses in the spanish
[50:35] south american countries
[50:37] oh my friend but there is only
[50:41] one jesus christ the anointed word of
[50:44] the
[50:44] hour amen and it is his life
[50:48] behind your name that causes the demons
[50:52] to tremble
[50:52] when the devil looks at you and realize
[50:55] that the real christ that's the same
[50:58] yesterday today and forever
[51:01] he lives in you he moves in you
[51:04] he has his being in you that's why he's
[51:06] still alive today
[51:08] moving in the hearts and lives of his
[51:10] elected
[51:11] amen praise god hallelujah
[51:14] every individual
[51:17] got to have this kind of faith
[51:21] like the prophet of malachi 4
[51:24] 5 had amen
[51:29] and the reason why some people are
[51:32] tossed about
[51:34] the reason why some people
[51:38] following this word
[51:42] are having a struggle with their with
[51:44] their walk
[51:46] and the struggle with living right
[51:51] many having struggles
[51:54] we're trying to keep the guidelines and
[51:57] standards
[51:58] conduct an order of the word of god
[52:03] amen hallelujah many of them
[52:06] flip flip flop this way in the church
[52:10] today
[52:10] out tomorrow believe today don't believe
[52:14] tomorrow
[52:15] uh moving like a man a drunken
[52:18] under this sledgehammer blows of satan
[52:22] and the punches the devil has put upon
[52:25] them
[52:25] i want you to know you've got to know
[52:28] god for yourself
[52:32] you cannot live your life off of brother
[52:35] branham's experience
[52:37] you must enter in the innervale
[52:40] and have your own experience your own
[52:44] conference with god hallelujah
[52:47] i want to quote david duplessi
[52:51] one of the great preachers of all
[52:54] pentecost
[52:55] from the full gospel businessmen's
[52:58] association he used these words
[53:02] in a great sermon and he said his words
[53:05] with these
[53:06] god has no grandchildren
[53:10] only children oh praise god
[53:14] hallelujah you cannot inherit conviction
[53:17] you cannot inherit faith you cannot
[53:20] inherit
[53:21] any of those things you've got to
[53:25] go to god and get them for
[53:28] yourself amen hallelujah
[53:31] oh my friends i believe
[53:35] that the church of god has gotten away
[53:39] from the shekinah glory the glory has
[53:43] departed
[53:44] they have gotten away from the shekinah
[53:46] glory of the presence of the living god
[53:49] hallelujah they've gotten away from the
[53:52] shining
[53:53] warming presence of the revelation
[53:56] of the word of the living god hallelujah
[54:01] listen quoting the prophet of this
[54:04] hour out of conference with god
[54:10] amen grandsons
[54:13] god don't have grandchildren
[54:16] god only has sons and daughters
[54:21] your grandchild if your mother was just
[54:24] a pentecostal
[54:27] if you just say oh my daddy was a
[54:29] pentecostal
[54:31] amen you're just a grandchild
[54:35] you've got to be born just like your
[54:38] daddy or your mammy was born
[54:41] god doesn't have grandchildren
[54:45] he's you've got to have the experience
[54:48] yourself
[54:49] you can't go in on your peppers or your
[54:52] mama's

[55:50] the altar
[55:51] to repent let me repeat that again
[55:54] no man can call
[55:58] jesus the christ
[56:01] just because he feels
[56:04] sorry for his sins in a meeting
[56:09] and comes and repents
[56:13] at the altar no sir
[56:18] no man can call jesus the christ
[56:24] except by the revelation
[56:27] of the holy ghost making it known
[56:31] unto him that upon this
[56:34] rock i'll build my church
[56:38] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
