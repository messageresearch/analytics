when the redeem who everything lost like snow I wish [Applause] thank you Mr thank you Hallelujah it's just a blessing to be here just I don't know how to express it but it's a holy place here to stand with the grace of God and we will never saw the time you can't come here all the time but we believe that God will take control amen so our confidence is not in me if you came here to listen to bro I feel like that you are in trouble but you have to have in your heart you're coming to hear from the Lord and with that expectation God will speak to your needs amen because I have nothing to give to you but he has so you're lying on him and without wasting my time let's read our scriptures and have two scriptures and my title is um okay so let's read the two scripts I'll give you the title I wrote it back first Peter chapter 1 verse 1 to 7. and Proverbs 15 23. to finally say Amen okay I read from the Bible from the top yeah Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to The Strangers scattered throughout Pontius galatia Cappadocia Asia and bathania elect according to for knowledge of God the father true sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ unto you and peace be multiplied blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy had begotteness unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead restful to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that faded notary reserved in heaven for you he said that an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that faded not away think on that reserved in heaven for you amen who kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time where we greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness true manifold Temptations that's my our best most on here that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perish though he betrayed with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ and I'm gonna base most much of my thoughts on this and Proverbs 15 23. it's just I can't get away from this scripture here that has been my topic a man has Joy by the answer of his mouth and a word spoken in due season how good is it so my targets a word spoken in due season let's pray our gracious Eternal God we came here with Thanksgiving in our heart father during the day if we have dying to wrong forgive everyone of friends because you give us assurance that the blood of Christ washes us from every unbelief father as we coming to speak I pray God that oh Lord I am us on the way to email us father we did something that the disciples recognized that before the the crucifixion Lord you break the bread in certain way so father I went there they got to that place and you broke the bread in that way they recognized that it was you father and they said the daughter had been within us as he spoke unto us may you come once again and break the bread of of way of life for us may you take me aside let me be a blessing it all like you reject it may your spirit take control come please Jesus and take control in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen please be seated yeah so um so my title is a word spoken in due season and definition of a word is the thought expressed when you express what's in your thoughts it becomes a word so a word is the thought expressed and the word that we speak it can either make us or destroys because the power you have that power in your funk so it can say the right thing and it will bring the presence of God it can see another thing and it's gonna bring death to you and in most cases I am when a man is tried to the call when they get to the Rope the end of the road when you reach right and you get the end of the rope and it seems there's no way out for the individual and at that time because remember his God of the mountains and the god in the valley and most of the time when we're in The Valleys that's when you really deal with this not mostly on the Mountaintop he deal with us on both ways then when round the valley that's why sometimes he really deal with this and that time is either make or break and depends on what seed is being planted over there because for years I was wondering and said oh man what made Peter able to say that thou are the son of the Living God and so many examples that you can't recognize that it was a seed of God in them that's why they could say the right word at the right time so when you are being tried to the call you either going to defile reject God or say the right thing the attributing you who says something new to bring God on the scene and job was tried to the call but one thing I love about job was someone whose confidence was in the word of God even though God blessed him with all riches he was the richest man in his age but his heart was not on his riches there's nothing wrong to be rich we need money to preach the word of God but the question is do you allow that money to control you or you control the money and when you have confidence in God and you control that money the money is has is not attached to you that's why in Hebrews if you read in Hebrews 13 going down that thing verse 4 5 Paul said that in whatever state I find myself I'm content before that I said that do not be convict yourself other people's things the content in whatever state you find yourself and then somewhere he said that I'm able also to be abound high and also to be low and if you read that they says that the reason why I said that the content what you have it doesn't mean that you don't it doesn't mean that when you say the content it doesn't mean that you don't have to have any aspiration or even motive to do anything or just stay like that but all that Paul is trying to say that for God will never never leave you nor for safety so whatever condition that you find yourself in you have that assurance that God will never leave you nor for safety that thing has to be always because once you have that confidence that God will never leave you not forsake me you never going to stumble you're going to stay put because you know he will come on the scene when he has to show up you show up so whatever says that you have yourself you still have to give God thanks he's the god of the good times and the god of the by times amen those things may not look right but he will make it right is that right because you might not say things the way he wanted to see but he will tell everything and make it right so you have to be happy you have to thank God for every situation when you answered your prayer praise God even if you stand yourself to thank him because God will never leave you nor forsake you he has brought you thus far he's more than able to take the rest of the journey do you think you kept yourself he has kept you this far so job wasn't worried about everything he lost his faith was in God he he was never wavered by the situation and all his friends were a miserable comforters that's why sometimes when people are going through their trials you have to watch and let God speak to you before you try to speak to them because if you go by the flesh you're going to be a miserable comforter may God has to reveal to you the right way to speak in due season that will bring right Atmos that will help and encourage the individual they will just go by the flesh you make mistake because job friends they just look at the flesh the condition and they told him all kinds that you are sinner but if they have seen God and pray for job and see God's face they could have gone the right way and when you are being tested to the call whenever your colors will show and job's wife didn't have that seed she looked at the circumstance that cares God that Joseph said thou speaking like a foolish woman the lord giveth and the love ticket blessed be the name of the Lord and when job said that he spoke there at the right time and he brought the presence of God down and he could see beyond the captain of time and God revealed to him and he said that I know by redeem I leave it even if the skin went destroyed his body in my flesh I shall see God why because he spoke the right word at the right time tell me why because there's a seed of God hiding in there so when it gets to the the core of the heart when he was tried to the call that seed came forth and spoke blessed be the Lord the Lord take it and the Lord give it he never cares God amen he never gave up his um what right do I say is that right just like Esau when he was tried when he was hungry you see a lot of people are selling their best right the economy is in shambles now inflation is going higher and they take you money from the system so he's squeezing the people financially but a true Christian will know that the Lord give and the Lord taken blessed be the name of the Lord your confidence is in God Elijah when there's a farm in the land God sent even Ravens to feed him so no matter what you find yourself in this economic hardship your confidence should be in God and believe that God will never leave you not for safety the god that fed Elijah in the midst of that that same God is able to take care of you and your family amen so job never never let God that Esau was thanking the law of his belly and a lot of people are selling their Birthright because there is no seed in them they don't have what it takes to what resist because when you get to that place only the attributes can come forth and speak remember Abraham went to the same condition he lost his wife who lost his children he lost his daughter he lost his brother he lost his father around the same time and he wanted to give up even holding Electric Ball to get rid of his life and he didn't die and the denim was telling him sometimes you hear all kind of voices and those wives was not the word of God it was to bring depression to him then he was saying yes yes but that attribute came forth and said who am I William Abraham I'm from a poor family I didn't come with anything the lord giveth the Lord to get blessed be the name of the Lord well the attribute came forth and spoke the right word and trim the enemy what cut it so it says in your life and in my life if there is that part of God that Gene of God that tribute is hiding over there it doesn't matter what you go through that should be able to come forth and speak the right word at the right time that doesn't mean that in your life you're not going to speak wrong questions you're not going to make mistake or relearn from my experience and because there's a seed of God in you there if you want to say something wrong it corrects you and it brings you back to that word of God so you don't have to just um you don't have to worry about anything just be simple lead your true Christian Life and God will take your business somewhere Brahm said that job has to go through all that in order for him to see My Redeemer leader to see beyond the Rapture to see to get that thing he has to go through all that so you and me we are not going to have it easy Christian life is not a flowering birth of ease they said that many are afflictions of the righteous but God delivers them out of what o a l l he will deliver you from everything he's able to do it there's nothing that God cannot do no matter what the circumstances he'll bring us through because he's the same yesterday today and forever he will never leave you nor forsake you it is the same God but trials and afflictions is a part of Christian work because God has to train us that's why I said that if your trust is worth more than gold because to get the pure good they have to what um crisis Crisis crisis to get that gold out so to get that pure of field that part of you to fully manifest God sometimes allow us to go through all those things like the Hebrew children they got to a place and when I read that scripture for the first time that was so dear to my heart they said that we know they were so certain that their God is able to deliver them but even if that God decide not to deliver them they were not going to bow down to that Idol why does part of Christ in them those attributes of God so when they spoke that right that right word in due season it took them to the fire but they were not scared to have been in that fight because they have spoke the right to that she put in them has spoken and they have spoke the right word in due season and when they did that what happened they saw Jesus Christ The Fourth Man in the fire so is you and me no matter what you go through stencil and see the salvation of God because God is a miracle working God he makes a way where it seems to be no way he is God that answers praise His God that is control of you and my life amen because he promised he'll never leave you and forsake you sometimes God permits certain things just to try you he just trying your faith somebody who says something to you don't get angry just let God take control by the situation because sometimes we try to fight our own battles we try to take control over situations but when you leave it to God he will take control he will turn things in the right way because he is in control of you so like Mary Lazarus brother like your sister sorry excuse me last one sister dear brother was sick and they call on Jesus their friend to come but he never show up imagine you are sick and you call your pastor you never show up in the hospital you're the king nobody is trying to visit you at the time of your hospital your need what will be your reaction and when the Lord got there in a modern woman modern people they would have just say anything to him oh my brother was saying he didn't show up what are you doing over here now she's dead what do you want from here now is there was one of the man who was still all kind of thing to him but it wasn't Mary that tribute of God In Hell came to pass and she said Lord my brother has died but he said that my brother has gone he said but if you were here my brother would not have died but even now whatever you ask God God will grant it to you he has that confidence and I'm relating the same to you tonight you on the YouTube land whatever you ask God God will grant it to you as the word is coming forth whatever you have need of tonight if you can't believe and ask God he will bring gate to pass because all things are possible to them that believe if thou can't believe whatever is happening of tonight God is able to bring you to pass if you are sick accept your healing if you are not fully accept your healing let the rich say I'm strong let the blind say I can see amen because he's able to bring it to pass our God is an awesome God whatsoever you ask God he will grant it to you whatever in your heart that you have rid of you can claim me tonight because all things are possible to them who believe in God amen not sometimes or a-l-l are possible to them that believe God so right now whatever I have though you can claim it and what receive it hallelujah amen so it all comes back to the heart that Gene of God in you and me that chain can never disrespect God that Jane can never sin by the flesh that made mistakes that's why Paul said that the things I want to do I don't do the one things I don't have myself doing wretched me this is that refresh here but that chain of Christ it can never respect said that blessed is the balloon I will not improve sin and whose iniquity and so often say the seed of God abide in him he can never what sin amen so you can't sing so don't forget about it you are free just trust God and be reverent and God will bless you amen that start official woman that woman whose daughter was sick she used the wrong word and it didn't even turn Christ's head he said thou son of David have mercy on me he wasn't a son of David to her because it was wrong word and the wrong in the wrong time but when she said it's not meat for me to give the children's bread to the dog oh my goodness her mother oh my God I tell her that the way they'll give it to you I don't know but there was an attribute of God in that lady she said that oh God the Lord in the crabs and Jesus said he has not found such a faith in Israel and because she said the right way she got the right results so it's about speaking the right word in the season that brings the presence of God down at any time because he said I will never leave you nor for saving and then you can talk about um the Centurion he is a sanitarian that have 100 Centurion means that he has a hundred people under him so when when the Lord says try he said that I'm not even fit for you to come to my house just speak the word because I am man of authority and when I say this one go here he goes this one comes and he comes so just speak the word and that shows that there is no distance in prayer but you have to recognize who you are no wonder Brothers when the bride recognize who she is she'll be an invisible Army because if you recognize Who You Are then you have the authority in the name of it says to cast out devils to raise the dead to preach to speak today to to raise the dead to to heal their sick so when you lay your hands on they say they shall recover this world word is real it's not just a letter it has to be rare to you as I'm talking to you without that you can't please because it's impossible to please God with faith without faith without faith you can please man faith is a revelation unless the things reveal to you you can never please him and that woman that man the Centurion recognize his position and when you fully recognize that he spoke the right word at the right time and he brought the presence of God and when he went to him they said he asked what time did he got healed he really got into us the self same hour exact same time when he spoke the right word so you have to a son or daughter of God the attributing you have to be positive don't look at conditions and speak according to the conditions he said let the poor say I'm rich let the Rick say I'm shrunk and believe it and step forward it will come to pass just believe and see yourself healed and you see yourself in that condition because they said yesterday today and forever if he has done it for others how can he do it for you and me because it's the same God he said Elijah was the man subject to like passion like you and I and he prayed endlessly that should not Reign for three years and and through half years didn't rain he has up and down he makes mistakes like you and me but you pray sincerely so you and I we have to be sincere we have to be serious we there's no time for the bride to sleep it's like waking up time no time to joke it's going on time so if God can do it to them he will do it rest and he's doing their lives we have a lot of a lot of testimonies so you always have to remember what God has done for us no wonder I said that um count your blessings and name them one by one it will surprise you what the Lord has done for you he's doing a mighty work all the time so you have to say the right way no wonder I said that whatsoever thinks that are of good report whatsoever things that edifies either very virtues think on those things because the things that you think around is forms an atmosphere around you Your Atmosphere comes around the things you feed in your soul on so you have to search what you are feeding your soul up unconsciously those things comes and flow through you either you like it or not if you listen to the word it flush through you you see yourself in it if you listen to what little things it's gonna flow through you the things that you feed on so much that's what gonna approach you so I said that whatsoever things is of good report because forever things that edifies if there are any verses think on those things because God is not to something big amen and a part of it hallelujah praise God so what am I talking about here when Moses met God in that burning bush God talked to Moses and Muslims talked to him in that bedding voice and if God calls you I believe he talks to you and you have to talk back to him we God is real brother it's not just a picture here it's a living God one time when I was just new in this church I was leaving Mississauga I ran Dairy and everything there and I had some problem was bothering me and I was coming to tell pastor I'm not saying that when you have an issue don't bring it because if you keep their things to yourself you alone struggle with it but when you tell so many people you get that back they share it with you but every situation how God want to deal with it so thinking and praying over it and a voice saying Abraham was a friend of God and God speak to him lives to you why can't you tell your problem to God yourself I became conscious of myself and I cried unto God and have an answer it doesn't mean that when I have a situation I don't bring I'll bring it but God has to reveal to you which one has to come because somewhere Brian said if you have that Faith you don't even need to bring the prayer line because they felt like mustard seed it will not mess with anything that we have we help one who chased a thousand to chase ten thousand but sometimes God's wanna be real to you and the history said that come talk to me son I'm here to listen to you amen because Moses talk to God and God talked to him you are not different from the same God thousand Moses in you and me it was not Moses who did all those 10 miracles it was not Moses who stopped the Red Sea it was not Moses that are it was God in Moses during their miracles it wasn't blah blah um it was the Brahm what telling the people um brother bread your son is this towards God in the prophet during that Miracles how can he knows your address and everything it wasn't him so I was calling him doing those things and that same God is in you and me doing that success in our life in a small way in accordance their faith the measure of your faith it has never been a people it was calling them the attribute part of God in them in this place it wasn't something it was God in something how can a young a young man carry just take a boy and kill thousand people and kill lion and all those things how can he do it trust God behind him and that same God has put on flesh in you you see they're looking at him back there on Calvary but now he's in you and me some flesh walking along the aisle and the people can recognize him that's why I have to recognize God what he's doing in due season the right threat at the right time will bring him on the same he's the same yesterday today and forever God has never changed Hallelujah the same God because listen even the Lord Jesus Christ he has to be crucified before Ascension we can't have it any other way is that right everywhere in the scriptures is crucifixion before Ascension you're gonna go through trust before it can be worked go to all of sin and fall of Fame it's all of critics before Hall of Fame you can't have it any other way so we have to have in your heart and believe God that whatever comes my way my life is in your hand my life is in God's hand you have to be in that place recognize that you are the clay here is the Potter he has to make us and Shepherds according to his own will amen is God that doesn't want to be moved by a sheep hear the voice of the shepherd a sheep is willing to be led a sheep is willing to be led by his master amen so you have to come to a place that you have surrendered everything to him that he is the Potter reality wherever he does he's right shall not exist until they have due right Abraham have his own trial the very thing that was so dear to him Isaac he was asked to sacrifice and when the time come that she would came from for me he said me and the Lord are going to worship and we come back how can he have that confidence and when he said that he spoke the right word in due season and it brought the presence of God when the time came for him to kill Isaac God provided him spoke that sacrifice and the same God that spoke Abraham's needs into existence he is able tonight to speak your needs into existence if thou can't believe the only thing that prevent God to bring things back is your own belief if you do not doubt it might be me and say to this mountain be moved it will move it's all based on faith if you do not doubt and believe and say to this mountain did I removed it will come to pass and Abraham spoke the right way until season and God spoke his knees into existence and God will speak your knees into existence when you say the right word in due season amen that trouble to speak to you don't worry when the time comes when the meat arrives he because I said that he will never give you anything that you cannot bear and when enemy rides like a flood he always gonna raise a standard the standard is the word of God it's a revelation part of it not only the written part the Revelation part that's why the devil don't have nothing to do with it amen because they are so focused on the written back forgetting that he's the same yesterday to them forever they forgot the unwritten portion Rhythm between the lies you don't want it because they don't have what it takes but you have that quality you it is giving to know the kingdom of to know the mystery of the Kingdom to them it's not giving amen praise God hallelujah thank you Jesus amen so what is happening now is the same God that was in Moses Moses LED them through the wilderness and when you get to that Red Sea he was so begin to cry and God said why Cry by speak he spoke and they went forth so he did his part but it got to a place that God finished with Moses so Joshua was the one who has to leave them the promised land and Joshua is the one that's what placed the children of Israel The Inheritance in there and Joshua type the Holy Ghost leading us back to the to the promised land God has sent us a Vindicated Prophet that said the Lord William Brown Abraham never been a time that God has used a human being like that because it wasn't him it was God in him the son of man being revealed at that time amen and that you said that yourself almost is the source a day do not depart from left or the right so God has taken the prophet out is that right by the same God that was in the prophet in the form of the Holy Ghost is leading the bride again because remember the son of man's son was when God incarnate himself in the flesh when God take control over the Flesh and live in that individual around the world become flesh he didn't become the Sonoma so it is the son of man being revealed again in the bright form that's what is happening it's Joshua Ministry it's a Holy Ghost leading us back the mighty angel he's the one leading us back to the rapture amen the rapturing time Hallelujah and I'm just gonna read this quotation then I'm gonna wrap it up it's Look Away to Jesus one of them is the proven he swear that yes you shall give me all the best paragraph 35 is the Lord you only give me a small portion put all the paragraph 35 when I might okay let me look away to Jesus first paragraph 48 well he said it's practically that way now you can't go to a church and preach unless you have a fellowship card or some identification and now on Persons like ourselves we are going to be cut out of all that all together that's exactly cause they won't be able to do it it's tightening and then when that time comes and the Press come to a place to where you are pressed out then watch what I'm facing to tell you in few minutes watch the third pool then see and it will be absolutely to the total loss but it will be for the bride and the church now we are closer than it seems to be I don't know when there is real real close I may be building a platform for somebody else to step in to step on I may be taken before that time I don't know and that time may be this coming week that the holy spirit will come with and bring crises he may come this next week he may come yet tonight I don't know when he will come he doesn't tell us that but I do believe that you are so close that it I'll never die with old age yet at 54 years old I'll never die with old age until he's here see unless I'm short kill or something other some way killed just old age won't kill me until his time come and I believe that and I want to say this I've never said it before but according to scripture according what he said 30 years ago 33 years ago on the river down there in 1933 rather what he said everything has happened just exactly I may not do it but this message will introduce Jesus Christ to the world for us John the Baptist was sent to fall around the first coming so is the message to forerun the second coming and John said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of wealth see so its power it in every way and I know a twelve the message will go on we all know that when the cease was revealed the title became available it's available to us but what I'm trying to say God is dealing with us in a secret way it doesn't put us right now in an open show just like David I believe that when God was dealing with David with a bear and the lion nobody saw that it was a word god dealing with David in a secret place and God is dealing with you and me we having victory over here having testimony over here having um um having a victory here and there just like David it wasn't David it wasn't just a slingshot it was faith that led that but it came to a time that what God has been dealing with David in a secret maybe all his brothers knew that God was dealing with him that way that he was able to kill as as a lion when attacked his ship he was able to kill that bear when the attack is sheep only few people know but it came a time that God put him on display between Goliath and when that time came everybody saw Who David was so is the bride of Christ God has been hiding us people don't know what is going on they haven't seen that but there is going to be a short break work God is going to this place right for the whole world to see what's inside of us but unless the title didn't come unless they close the church all those that is hidingness is going to come in full strength we are manifesting it I'm not saying that it's hidden it's here everything that I really fear with us is that right but when that thing comes when that crush them when that desperation ceasing whatever it is either by God is going to trust to the whole world we know that bride of Christ on this plane it's not going to be hidden anymore they have the world hasn't seen nothing yet the bride is coming in this place and the short time you're gonna be happy when they cross the church we're going up amen it doesn't matter what they do it's economic pressure political pressure and religious pressure all culminating against the bride of Christ that God raises the standard and the same God that spoke sister had to write son salvation that gave the life to that little fish that spoiled those Spirits in existence that same God is going to display the bride for the people to know that he is hiding behind us it's not you or me there is the same Holy Ghost don't get me wrong God the table is here he's manifest himself in the little way here in the corner here here people don't know but what God is doing he's giving you and me as an experience because he dealt with David by himself alone to have those experience to when he came for the show between him and Goliath he wasn't scared because God has dealt with him the backside of the desert so that same Mighty Angel is dealing with you and me giving us that Victory here when the time comes The Showdown that attribute of God you will show up don't worry that part of God that seed of God in you will show up and light up that people who know who this God is that God of rabraham he said Living God he's not a dead God amen and it will be long everything is pointing the coming of Christ everything that you were saying is coming is coming is coming has come before you were saying this is coming that is coming but we see it now without playing unless you are blind you see everything unfolding the gospel is going back to the Jews they will have the atonement those seven trumpets and we'll go home because now they have the right thing who are fighting for the land nobody knows that is is the time saying it's getting closer than we think and very soon you take his binder it shows us that the marriage of the Lamb is here and his wife had made herself ready amen the wife of Christ has made herself ready is going long time brother sister is going on time so the gospel has to go to the Jews and the two professors to come before then we are going up we are going up when brother Philip I can't tell but I can say it's right around the corner so let's have our lamb streamed amen um I think I'll end over here by David can you just come yes so all that I'm saying that is here the time is near is the evening time the bride's room is there the bride is preparing for her me to meet amen praise our God oh this is the evening time it's later than you think the pride is [Music] me all things are ready now foreign [Music] not according to God's word [Music] rejecting is only son and accepting the Creeds of man this is [Music] all this is the evening time foreign [Music] he that hath an ear to hear the evening time is here [Music] to hear the evening time is here amen you're dismissed tonight God bless you all see you on Sunday [Music]
