[20:16] to increase
[20:18] between Christmas and the New Year's
[20:20] service

[20:23] my first scripture gonna be first
[20:25] Thessalonians chapter four
[20:28] verse 13 to 18.
[20:32] and then my 2 16 1-3
[20:39] but I would not have you to be ignorant
[20:43] Brethren concerning them which are
[20:46] asleep
[20:46] that used to do not even as others which
[20:50] have no hope
[20:51] for if we believe that Jesus died and
[20:54] rose again
[20:55] even so them also which I sleep in Jesus
[20:58] will God bring with him
[21:00] for this we say unto you by the word of
[21:04] the Lord that we which are alive
[21:06] and remain unto the coming of the Lord
[21:08] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[21:12] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[21:15] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[21:18] the Archangel and of the Trump of God
[21:20] and the dead in Christ shall rise first
[21:24] then we which are alive and remain shall
[21:27] be caught up together with them in the
[21:29] clouds to meet the Lord in the air I'm
[21:32] gonna
[21:33] um
[21:35] base most of my thoughts of meeting in
[21:38] the air so we shall ever be with the
[21:40] Lord
[21:42] and
[21:45] Matthews is well for comfort and that
[21:47] with this verse Matthew chapter 16 verse
[21:51] 1 to 3.
[21:56] 63 verse
[21:59] 2 and 3.
[22:02] he answered and said unto them when it
[22:04] is evening he said to be fair weather
[22:07] for the sky is red
[22:10] and in the morning it will be far
[22:12] weather
[22:13] today for the sky is red and lowering oh
[22:17] ye Hypocrites you can design the face of
[22:20] the sky but can you not descend the
[22:23] signs of times but then you can please
[22:25] come and prove by the service
[22:30] let's pray
[22:32] our gracious father Lord Jesus
[22:36] we are so grateful tonight Lord to be in
[22:38] your presence and to be under
[22:41] expectation to receive a word from you
[22:43] tonight Lord it'll change each and every
[22:46] one of our lives one word One Revelation
[22:50] father
[22:51] to give us Clarity of the day that we're
[22:53] living in in the hour that we are
[22:55] approaching Lord bless our precious
[22:57] brother now as he yields himself to your
[23:00] service Lord anoint speaker and hearer
[23:03] and Lord may we rejoice in that great
[23:06] meeting in the air this evening in Jesus
[23:09] name amen
[23:10] amen please be seated
[23:14] yeah once again how many enjoy the
[23:17] Christmas just well I know that
[23:19] everybody enjoyed the Christmas
[23:21] um
[23:22] and it's in between the Christmas and
[23:25] then going to the New Year's service
[23:28] so
[23:29] I'm not the one preaching the New Year
[23:31] the Christmas service also preach
[23:33] already but I'll just I encourage each
[23:36] and everyone that has re preparing for
[23:39] the New Year's Eve and the new year you
[23:42] have to check the little things on them
[23:44] because so many times not the big things
[23:47] deliver things that we live on them
[23:50] that lead us into trouble if you do
[23:53] those little things it end up the big
[23:55] things so you have to check that we do
[23:57] all the little things then let us all
[24:00] I mean
[24:03] have some consecrated time or
[24:07] rededicate our life again to Christ and
[24:10] approach the New Year's service it's
[24:13] very important that we do those little
[24:15] things
[24:16] and the Christmas
[24:19] they have made it
[24:21] um commercialization it's a money making
[24:24] scheme
[24:26] as Pastor said why they having their
[24:29] backyard whatever it is we were also
[24:31] worshiping Christ
[24:33] when we as Christians we worship we have
[24:35] Christmas every day you call Christmas
[24:38] the worship of Christ
[24:40] and that has been always because so many
[24:45] people
[24:46] are looking for
[24:48] Christ they're looking the manger
[24:51] for the Lord Jesus Christ there is no
[24:54] more in the manger
[24:56] he's not in your heart and in my heart
[24:59] so they're looking at him for the wrong
[25:02] point of view talking about Jesus
[25:03] they're always looking at the manger but
[25:06] it's not in a Manger anymore
[25:07] he's in your heart and in my heart
[25:10] walking on the two feet
[25:13] that's when people are missing it big
[25:15] time
[25:16] and it has always been the case
[25:20] because the intellectuals the high
[25:22] priests and all those people in the time
[25:25] of Jesus they makes him very big time
[25:29] and when he was even born because people
[25:32] all the time they put their own
[25:34] intellectual interpretation the word of
[25:36] God so they in their mindset they were
[25:40] expecting that is going to be a big
[25:42] giant man to come and deliver them from
[25:45] there from the Italian from the Romans
[25:49] but he came what the word of God has
[25:52] said you come through a virgin birth and
[25:56] they missed it and they are missing it
[25:58] today again
[26:00] because the Same Spirit
[26:02] and if you look at the priest I read a
[26:05] little bit in over here
[26:07] and the priest
[26:12] and Brian said in the future home of the
[26:15] Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly
[26:17] bride paragraph 57 and there was the
[26:21] priest representing the light
[26:24] he had learned from from the Bible
[26:27] he had learned that God was God
[26:30] he had learned that the Holiness was
[26:32] right
[26:33] he was learned that there was a law of
[26:36] God
[26:37] he had learned it because of an
[26:40] intellectual conception
[26:41] and he was born in a right lineage he
[26:45] was a levite
[26:47] but he only know it by intellectual
[26:49] conception
[26:51] and when the light of the hour see he
[26:54] learned it by what had happened
[26:57] not what was happening
[27:00] but what had happened as he said that
[27:03] they can design everything but they fail
[27:06] to know what is happening right now so
[27:10] they were praising for what has happened
[27:12] they know it intellectually they can't
[27:15] design what is happening in the present
[27:18] sense of the ministry of Jesus Christ
[27:21] they always put pointing back or
[27:24] pointing for it so that Prince has
[27:27] learned what has happened so when Jesus
[27:31] Christ was there the Bible said that
[27:34] told Moses that God said I raised up a
[27:37] prophet unto like thee him you should
[27:40] listen that will be the Messiah and when
[27:43] he did that Messiah sign
[27:46] what happened the high priest call it
[27:49] the Elizabeth
[27:51] because he has learned it intellectually
[27:54] but the woman at the world there she was
[27:57] a prostitute married and divorced for
[28:00] five times and was living with a sixth
[28:03] man but because she has a representation
[28:06] in heaven when he recognized that sign
[28:10] she didn't say that it was a Belgium he
[28:13] said we know that the Messiah will come
[28:16] when he cometh he will do these things
[28:19] she cut it right away
[28:22] even though she was a prostitute
[28:26] actually she looks very dark
[28:29] and the priest looked like shining to
[28:32] everybody but when the word of God was
[28:35] made manifest
[28:37] that priest know it all intellectually
[28:40] he failed to recognize that but that
[28:43] woman at the world she has a
[28:45] representation she was part of God's
[28:48] attribute of God so she recognized that
[28:52] this is the sound of the Messiah and the
[28:55] people when the word of God is making
[28:58] manifest it becomes foreign all the time
[29:01] to the people who are not part of him
[29:05] who do not have representation over that
[29:08] side remember when the Bible said that
[29:14] um
[29:14] Joel said that I went Joel prophecy was
[29:19] being made manifest in Acts 2 38
[29:22] they were caught up they defined that as
[29:25] new people are drunkard but Peter had
[29:28] defined them and said no they are not
[29:30] trans
[29:31] this is that which was spoken of by what
[29:34] Joel when the thing was being manifest
[29:37] those who do not have who do not have
[29:40] representation on the other side they
[29:42] always give it a name no wonder they
[29:45] call Paul that you are heresy and he
[29:48] said away look heresy that's the way I
[29:50] worship my God because what the hell is
[29:53] you the way Paul was worshiping it was
[29:56] foreign it was foreign to them they
[29:59] couldn't cut they couldn't understand it
[30:01] but a true seed of God those who have
[30:04] representation could see that this is
[30:06] the work of God and that has always been
[30:10] the case and it's repeating itself now
[30:13] in the present tense the denomination
[30:17] they rejected the prophet of God they
[30:19] rejected the word that came forth they
[30:22] couldn't recognize it and they tell
[30:25] their people is wrong and they gave all
[30:27] kind of interpretation to it but the
[30:29] true bride of Christ will say this fits
[30:32] me like gross they could recognize that
[30:34] it's the word of God for their day and
[30:37] it has even gone so bad that the
[30:39] intellectualism has even gone into a
[30:41] puppet in this age in the pulpit we
[30:44] didn't even the message that people can
[30:47] quote from A to Z and tell you
[30:49] everything that a prophet said but
[30:51] without the Revelation is just a letter
[30:54] because the letter killing by the spirit
[30:56] give life so without a revelation is
[30:59] just worse because you cannot please God
[31:02] without Revelation and those
[31:05] intellectuals will not take them
[31:06] anywhere because they don't have
[31:09] representation those with their
[31:11] representatives that have the attributes
[31:13] of God will recognize what God is doing
[31:16] present tense
[31:18] they will never put the word back or
[31:21] they won't put it forward
[31:22] it will get manifest they will catch it
[31:25] right away
[31:26] amen that's the true seed of God
[31:29] hallelujah so that's always been the
[31:31] case and they will always catch it
[31:34] but those people is going to be foreign
[31:37] to them
[31:38] and what am I saying I'm I'll just talk
[31:43] about three stages of
[31:46] um
[31:47] of of of
[31:48] justification certification and the
[31:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost but I'm gonna
[31:53] type it up
[31:55] with the Earth
[31:57] we all know that
[32:00] um
[32:01] the the Earth I also have three stages
[32:05] in the time of Noah
[32:08] the Lord
[32:11] told Noah that is going to rain
[32:15] and the people did not believe it but no
[32:19] I believe it out of the Millions
[32:22] it was only eight soul
[32:24] that catch up what Noah was saying but
[32:27] it was the number but if you check when
[32:32] it comes the Rapture it was only one
[32:34] which was Enoch so it's not gonna be
[32:37] many
[32:38] that you have Assurance you don't have
[32:40] to look at the numbers you have to have
[32:42] that Assurance in your heart that if God
[32:45] has met you if God has come to you then
[32:48] I claim I am one of them you claim
[32:51] you're one of them don't have to be
[32:52] worried but it's not going to be many
[32:54] anyways it's only a few chosen one and
[32:57] the people when they rebel against God
[32:59] God send rain to baptize the Earth
[33:03] like the type of justification when you
[33:06] come but God your by justification is
[33:08] that right by justification so he
[33:11] cleanse the word with the water
[33:14] and the next 2000 years
[33:18] was sanctification
[33:20] God himself became a human being
[33:25] and died to save us and he shed his
[33:28] blood on Calvary
[33:30] and that blood Sanctified the Earth
[33:33] exactly sanctify you but when you talk
[33:36] about that
[33:38] before it goes that I'll type it back to
[33:41] Abraham
[33:42] when Abraham
[33:45] told those people that and when he
[33:48] bought that piece of land
[33:50] they wanted to give it to him for free
[33:53] then he refused it you not take it
[33:57] but the Lord Jesus Christ to the same
[34:00] thing
[34:01] on the mountain the devil told him he's
[34:03] gonna give it to him for free but he
[34:06] refused it
[34:07] because if he accepted for free
[34:10] the devil will still have something to
[34:12] do with it he's always going to say
[34:13] something so he rejected it
[34:16] and he went on the cross and paid
[34:21] the price for you and me
[34:24] so he paid for it you are redeemed
[34:28] so on the cross whatever that you've
[34:31] happened of was done on the cross of God
[34:34] when he did it he crushed himself his
[34:36] head the devil was defeated
[34:39] on the cross so when that thing happened
[34:42] you were set free like Barabbas
[34:46] if you are the one supposed to die
[34:49] that he died so that you can go free
[34:53] so tonight don't let nothing hinder you
[34:56] he died on Christ so that you can be
[34:59] free you are Justified
[35:02] because none of us
[35:04] can always forgive and forget
[35:07] but when God forgives you he forgets
[35:11] also he doesn't remember anything so all
[35:15] your sins are forgiven tonight because
[35:18] on Calvary that's what it was for to be
[35:22] forgiven for justify as if you have not
[35:25] done it and he was wounded for your
[35:28] transgression bruised for your
[35:30] iniquities the chastisement of his peace
[35:33] was upon you and it was the stripes you
[35:36] were healed so you are healing is
[35:38] painful you just have to accept it and
[35:42] Redemption is not only in one part
[35:45] he said I wish above all things you
[35:48] prosper and be in health even as you are
[35:50] so Prospect so all the trespects were
[35:54] covered on Calvary
[35:55] so you will redeemed you have been paid
[35:58] for your your sins were painful Health
[36:00] Body and Soul
[36:03] and he said I have a thought for you a
[36:06] touch of Peace not to give you to give
[36:08] us unexpected and not an evil thought
[36:10] so God's thought to us as his genuine
[36:13] thought it's a good thought it's a great
[36:16] thought amen the thought is God's word
[36:19] expressed words the gods were expressed
[36:21] so you are free tonight
[36:24] don't live here with anybody on your
[36:27] heart as we go into the new year it
[36:30] doesn't matter what you did in last year
[36:32] it doesn't matter what you are off it
[36:34] doesn't matter what mistake you did
[36:37] once you confess it with God's fear of
[36:39] forgetfulness don't even think about it
[36:42] because I said that a seed of God cannot
[36:45] even sin
[36:46] God will not impute it against his own
[36:49] self because you are part of God
[36:53] so you cannot even sin
[36:55] so why are you worried tonight
[36:57] everything is paid for
[37:00] I'm free My New Day Has Come amen
[37:04] nothing you are free tonight
[37:06] so don't let nothing hinder you or don't
[37:09] get so much um
[37:12] discouraged or disturb or anything
[37:15] whatever you have God has paid it on the
[37:20] cross on Calvary that's why he came to
[37:24] die that's why he was born to shed his
[37:26] blood for you and me so sickness has no
[37:29] hold on you tonight
[37:31] amen hallelujah
[37:34] thank you Jesus amen our God is awesome
[37:38] God
[37:39] praise God thank you so this word of God
[37:43] is so real to you and me
[37:46] and on Calvary everything was peaceful
[37:50] and if you check
[37:52] the next 2 000 years
[37:55] that's when he's coming back
[37:57] for his bride
[37:59] is that right
[38:00] amen he's coming for us by the next two
[38:03] thousand years the six thousand years
[38:06] and it's one day with God Is Like A
[38:08] Thousand Years
[38:09] so that people think that he's not
[38:12] coming and I'll read maybe second Peter
[38:15] 3 and then we go for it with that
[38:18] scripture second Peter chapter three
[38:28] in second he said that verse 3 knowing
[38:31] this first
[38:32] that they shall come in the last days
[38:34] scoffers
[38:36] walking
[38:37] after their own lusts and saying where
[38:41] is the promise of his coming
[38:44] but once God has said his coming is
[38:46] coming
[38:47] and I believe that we are living in a
[38:49] borrowed time
[38:50] because if you look at the way things
[38:52] are happening in the time of the program
[38:53] he's told us that in the first world war
[38:56] if God himself has not stopped the world
[38:59] 11 hour 11 minutes 11 sin is to God move
[39:03] on right into a millennium so what time
[39:06] are we living and said I believe you are
[39:08] living the borrowed time in the time of
[39:11] first Exodus he gave them 30 years extra
[39:14] amen so we are living the borrowed time
[39:17] I don't I can't say when it's gone but I
[39:20] know it inspires you he's coming I don't
[39:24] like it or not amen they will go for the
[39:26] bread is coming for they say that
[39:28] fathers fell asleep all things
[39:30] continuously well from the beginning of
[39:32] the creation that's the skeptic they
[39:34] don't know what they are talking about
[39:35] amen for this they really are ignorance
[39:40] of that the word of God the heavens were
[39:45] of old and have standing out of the
[39:49] water and in the water
[39:51] whereby the world that then was being
[39:53] overflowed with water perish but the
[39:57] heavens and the Earth which are now by
[40:00] the same word are kept in salt reserved
[40:04] unto the fire against the day of
[40:06] judgment and perish of ungodly men
[40:10] by beloved be not ignorant of this one
[40:14] thing
[40:15] that one day is with the Lord as a
[40:17] thousand years and a thousand years as
[40:19] one day the Lord is not luck
[40:23] concerning his promise
[40:26] as woman men can't let the bed is
[40:29] long-suffering towards us
[40:32] not wearing that any should perish
[40:35] whether they should come unto us
[40:38] repentance
[40:40] so he's coming
[40:42] he's coming
[40:44] it's past you
[40:46] so you just have to make your your your
[40:48] thing ready because the marriage of the
[40:51] wife the minds of the Lamb has come and
[40:54] his wife had made herself ready so you
[40:58] are the wife of Christ you have a path
[41:01] to play your part is to be ready like
[41:05] the the boss son she made herself ready
[41:07] so the Boston when she went to marry
[41:10] while looking for the bride when you
[41:12] promised that bride he's he's coming for
[41:15] her he she made herself ready amen
[41:19] praise God so the coming of the Lord is
[41:22] at hand
[41:23] Hallelujah
[41:25] our God is awesome God
[41:28] amen I didn't like it or not he's coming
[41:32] you have to be ready he's coming for his
[41:34] bride and that bride is what it's a
[41:37] spotless bride
[41:38] that bride has the mind of Christ that
[41:42] bride is part of him amen the head has
[41:45] come to us to cut the body amen so God
[41:48] is in the pride now you're doing the
[41:50] exact same because the people are always
[41:52] pointing back but it's always our
[41:54] movement of Revelation and the
[41:57] Revelation is the what is that the
[41:58] Rapture hallelujah our god is the rest
[42:01] of God
[42:03] hallelujah praise God so whilst I'm
[42:07] talking about the seven days you have to
[42:08] type it back and forth you are Justified
[42:11] you're sanctified
[42:13] then God filled about the Holy Ghost
[42:15] enter into the Holy Ghost himself come
[42:18] to work cap everything which is God
[42:20] himself living He will burn every trace
[42:22] of sin inside of you that's the same
[42:24] three steps for for the Earth too for
[42:27] God to redeem the Earth
[42:31] by sanctification and then the next six
[42:36] thousand is gonna abandon is that right
[42:38] but then in between
[42:40] when he comes for the bride and then he
[42:43] comes back with the bride there's going
[42:44] to be a millennium which is what the
[42:47] Thousand reign of God but in that
[42:49] Millennium is arrest
[42:51] is not 100 rest because in the
[42:54] Millennium you're going to work
[42:57] you're going to plant
[42:59] you're going to build
[43:01] that's that that's the rest but it's not
[43:04] a full rest the full rest comes on the
[43:06] everyday you come back the seventh day
[43:08] when he comes back for the Judgment when
[43:10] it comes after after white Throne
[43:12] judgment after a white 200 when it comes
[43:15] to a white Throne judgment we go to rock
[43:17] the he said I'll make a new Earth a lot
[43:20] a new Heaven that one is done by God
[43:24] himself
[43:25] so like the Eighth Day you have the
[43:29] um the seven churches the Lord this
[43:30] church is Lord these are the seventh
[43:33] Church age we are in now that was that
[43:35] time that we are all physically in that
[43:38] time at that time was like a law
[43:41] we made our mistake don't do this don't
[43:43] do that don't do that don't do this
[43:44] don't do that but in the end which is
[43:47] the Eternal Church age when it comes the
[43:50] Mind recognize that it's not him anymore
[43:53] is that man Son of God God himself in
[43:56] the bride doing things himself so that
[43:59] nobody can touch it it's God himself in
[44:03] the bride so it's not your works anymore
[44:06] there's no man can touch it anymore I
[44:09] stole your heart if that's what nobody
[44:10] touch it it's him doing it that's the
[44:13] Eighth Day come back to us come back to
[44:16] the eighth the seventh the first day of
[44:19] the week converted the holy convocation
[44:20] is going to leave it because 23 just by
[44:23] congregational holy convocation it comes
[44:26] by the eighth day comes back to eternal
[44:28] so that's why we are in now the tenor
[44:31] Church age amen praise God it's so
[44:34] simple it's so easy why can't people say
[44:36] it Hallelujah I'm going to read this
[44:39] quotation to pack it up
[44:43] I can see it everywhere you saw all over
[44:46] the place
[44:47] says for you it is giving for them it's
[44:49] not giving so that you can know
[44:52] Hallelujah
[44:55] yeah I said that
[44:57] paragraph two three six
[45:00] and we live through all these types in
[45:02] here but when you hit the eighth you go
[45:05] on into eternity
[45:08] you don't come by loss and rituals and
[45:11] others so it's not your works anymore in
[45:13] the eight day you come by predestination
[45:17] if you are not president you can't go
[45:19] you have to have a representation you
[45:22] were in God's thought before the
[45:24] foundations of the world if you are not
[45:26] installed you can't do it I mean there
[45:29] is a genuine holy convocation see and we
[45:33] are ending the seventh Church age the
[45:36] Pentecostal age
[45:38] that has ended so physically
[45:41] you are bodies on the seventh chamber
[45:43] your soul is on the eighth day he said
[45:46] that your subject didn't even change you
[45:49] are living in Heavenly places in Christ
[45:51] Jesus
[45:53] amen so everything inside it's not you
[45:55] anymore
[45:57] it's Christ who is taking care of
[45:59] everything he's in charge of my soul is
[46:02] the child of everything amen the devil
[46:04] can work they can kill your body they
[46:06] can hurt your spirit my soul is in
[46:09] Christ amen that soul is in Christ
[46:12] nothing can touch Untouchable it's part
[46:15] of God is God part of God himself and
[46:18] God cannot kill himself amen you cannot
[46:21] deny himself
[46:22] so you are part of that amen hallelujah
[46:26] and then
[46:28] improving the sweat he said but the
[46:31] Rapture is going to the wedding supper
[46:34] when the world here you dress with the
[46:37] person and they do become one and then
[46:40] what does it do then it manifests the
[46:43] son of man again not the church
[46:45] theologians the son of man the word and
[46:48] the church becomes one whenever the son
[46:51] of man done he was the word the church
[46:53] does the same thing as a pastor I've
[46:56] taught the soldiers look there's a
[46:59] reference or the son of man again in the
[47:02] bright form
[47:04] that's what Christ is doing now
[47:06] amen
[47:08] Hallelujah so the Rapture inside the
[47:11] world it's just around the corner
[47:14] so very soon we're gonna live from this
[47:18] pest house Brad Danny
[47:19] oh man no wonder when it was revealed to
[47:23] Abraham and the rest they said that we

[51:23] upon their forehead dressed in Raymond

[51:32] meeting in the air
[51:34] nobody can escape there's not going to
[51:37] be any Thief over there the one that
[51:39] came through the window he was cast out
[51:41] if you don't have the wedding garment
[51:43] you are not coming there
[51:45] amen praise God
[51:48] so what is it what am I saying zebra
[51:50] Philip
[51:51] I'm trying to say that
[51:55] God
[51:57] is taking us back
[51:59] to what to the first Adam
[52:03] the condition that Adam was in
[52:06] there was no one God was everything was
[52:08] in harmony
[52:11] Adam could said these three move over
[52:14] here because remember when Adam was
[52:17] naming all the animals and everything
[52:19] everything that Anna Adam name God was
[52:22] pleased with it why because he was
[52:24] thinking God's thoughts
[52:27] hey man so God was pleased with it
[52:30] amen so
[52:32] God was missing everything he did and
[52:36] he could tell that tree move over here
[52:39] this move over here this book don't want
[52:42] to access Christ that if you have faith
[52:45] and do not doubt but believe
[52:48] you can say to this mountain be thou
[52:50] removed
[52:51] and it was come to pass because God gave
[52:55] us that Authority
[52:57] everything gets to Adam he restoring
[52:59] back to us now
[53:01] amen so he said if thou can't believe
[53:04] all things are possible
[53:08] is there anything hard for the Lord
[53:11] he's given us everything
[53:14] we just have to attack on the word
[53:17] not only the intellectual conception
[53:20] this word has to make manifest
[53:23] when the word mismatch manifests is the
[53:25] interpretation of the word
[53:28] but the people don't have nothing to do
[53:31] with it
[53:32] they just always intellectualizing it
[53:36] so what am I saying I'll just encourage
[53:39] you think about those place you are
[53:42] going there won't be any gray hair
[53:44] debraham Mike
[53:45] no no gray hair
[53:48] no headache no pain
[53:51] no stress
[53:54] it's a beautiful place he said I am
[53:57] going to prepare a place for you where I
[53:59] am there you shall also be
[54:02] that place is a good place
[54:06] wow the lamb and the Wolf they all stick
[54:09] together
[54:11] the animals they're not gonna be scared
[54:13] of anyone
[54:14] all those 15 is gone because remember
[54:17] God is going to gonna destroy all the
[54:20] atmosphere of sin
[54:22] all that country around there is gonna
[54:24] destroy it and make a new Heaven A New
[54:27] Earth
[54:28] so is him coming back again and what
[54:31] making us on this Dimension to enjoy
[54:34] this again but
[54:36] that to that one in that form of what he
[54:40] wanted it to be a perfect one
[54:43] everything was perfect
[54:46] does nothing like jealousy oh hatred or
[54:51] Miley so none of those things were there
[54:54] it was all pure love of God
[54:59] man you can't even explain it's a
[55:01] measureless
[55:02] and I encourage that people fall in love
[55:05] with God
[55:06] when you fall in love with God then the
[55:09] word becomes what it becomes a life
[55:12] affair
[55:13] because when you talk to your wife you
[55:15] have to have certain secrets you can
[55:17] just understand things on written part
[55:19] so when you fall in love with God those
[55:21] are written by because you can catch it
[55:24] that without you having the love of God
[55:26] you have died him in you a couple part
[55:29] of him and you you can't catch it
[55:31] because you're not in love with him
[55:33] you are not part of him but if you are
[55:37] presented of him
[55:38] when you fall in love with him
[55:40] everything becomes clear
[55:42] amen because you don't hide those
[55:45] secrets from you they revealing secrets
[55:47] to you
[55:48] yeah he's gonna let all his Secrets it's
[55:51] God
