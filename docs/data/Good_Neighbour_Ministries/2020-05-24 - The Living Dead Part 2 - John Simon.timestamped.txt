[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] good morning friends it's good to be in
[0:17] the house of God on this marvelous
[0:20] wonderful sunny Sunday morning in God's
[0:25] house with God's people giving glory to
[0:28] his wonderful and marvelous name let us
[0:34] pray
[0:35] our gracious Heavenly Father we ask thy
[0:39] blessing upon this a bread of life we
[0:44] ask that you will send it forth to be a
[0:48] blessing to all those that will hear it
[0:52] we commit ourselves to thee for service
[0:56] Lord may a great holy spirit rest upon
[1:00] us and walk upon the water once again
[1:04] and take glory honor and praise in Jesus
[1:09] name Amen and amen
[1:13] god bless you friends brothers sisters
[1:16] in Christ we are again speaking on the
[1:21] second part of the subject the Living
[1:25] Dead oh praise be to God the Living Dead
[1:30] and as we read out of the scriptures
[1:34] first Timothy chapter 5 verse 16 for
[1:38] she's at limit in pleasure is dead while
[1:45] she liveth now this scripture is
[1:50] speaking of wanton widows loose living
[1:55] widows living for the pleasure and
[1:58] enjoyment of sin and we told by the
[2:02] scriptures that she is spiritually dead
[2:09] while yet physically alive
[2:13] and by this scriptural understanding we
[2:17] know that anyone who lives a life of sin
[2:21] for the enjoyment of sin is one of the
[2:26] Living Dead I want to leave your old way
[2:31] of life I want you to make a change I
[2:36] want you to be able to say I'm turning
[2:40] around my entire life and I'm going into
[2:44] a different direction
[2:46] today I want you to come out from among
[2:50] the dead and walk in God's purpose and
[2:56] plan for you now we mentioned how that
[3:02] All Saints Day and Halloween night are
[3:06] really pagan worship and celebrations of
[3:11] the physically dead who can never return
[3:15] to us ever again
[3:18] now we know friends that the worship of
[3:24] ancestors the worship of these so-called
[3:28] dead relatives and frames is totally
[3:33] unscriptural and against the Word of God
[3:36] for no dead person really ever comes
[3:39] back it is Satan and his armies of
[3:43] Darkness who have exploited a loophole
[3:47] in religious teaching of today these
[3:52] demonic entities are impersonating
[3:57] people's loved ones and getting people
[4:01] to believe that their loved ones have
[4:04] returned to them that's a lie from the
[4:08] pit of hell that's a lie from Satan now
[4:12] you of my friends what time is it it's
[4:16] midnight
[4:16] darkness covers the land and gross
[4:20] darkness and blindness is upon the
[4:23] people who cannot recognize that we have
[4:26] because of the confusing array of
[4:30] denominations and different thought
[4:33] processes that are propounded and placed
[4:36] out there and so men and women are
[4:39] walking and doubt not recognizing what
[4:43] direction they should take it is
[4:47] spiritually dark so dark so dark as it
[4:51] was in the land of Egypt it is the
[4:55] church age of Leticia where we go from
[5:01] walking in bright moonlight right on
[5:08] through the ages predicted to walk into
[5:12] this age of Leticia of a total brat
[5:16] black out of truth understanding wisdom
[5:20] and the light of God now during this
[5:25] darkness these evil demonic walking
[5:30] corpses are everywhere roaming the earth
[5:35] spiritually dead on the inside capable
[5:40] of any action and physically there are
[5:46] life spiritually dead but physically
[5:51] alive a walking corpse roaming the earth
[5:55] they may be all dressed up with a
[5:59] beautiful dress beautiful woman
[6:02] beautiful man beautiful suit handsome
[6:05] man like that animated by a spirit of
[6:09] enticement and seduction and blind it to
[6:13] the Word of God unbelieving people
[6:16] unbelieving people like in North Day and
[6:20] like lots they we're like this all
[6:23] friends look into the Word of God where
[6:26] Jesus himself said as it was in the days
[6:31] of Noah so shall it be in the days when
[6:36] the Son of Man is being revealed again
[6:40] and make no mistake friends the
[6:43] manifestations of these invisible
[6:46] invaders are here among us they have
[6:51] moved from those primitive days where
[6:55] our of people falling on the ground
[6:57] foaming at the mouth and long
[7:01] fingernails and long hair and drooling
[7:05] and dripping right on down to appearing
[7:09] like Angels of Light and of
[7:11] respectability and acceptability also
[7:16] that I tell you the book of Revelation
[7:19] chapter 9 speaks of them graphically and
[7:24] describes these horrible and
[7:27] unimaginable evil things that are coming
[7:31] upon the earth
[7:32] read your Bible book of Revelation
[7:35] chapter 9 it tells of them all kinds of
[7:39] locusts all kinds of scorpion-tailed
[7:42] animals insects and monsters looking
[7:47] like women with hit with tear like women
[7:50] and acting like evil beasts o
[7:54] friends it's coming upon the face of the
[7:58] earth and a part of it is already here
[8:02] run I would say run people running to
[8:05] Jesus Christ and ask him for the
[8:08] salvation of your soul
[8:10] repent of your sins and be baptized in
[8:14] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he
[8:17] will forgive you cleanse you and accept
[8:20] you as one of his own let us face it
[8:24] without Jesus Christ in your life you're
[8:29] living in a nightmare this world is like
[8:33] a nightmare and you are living in it
[8:37] right now
[8:38] sweating and screaming and one day
[8:43] you'll wake up with a shout
[8:47] because you find your way slipping and
[8:50] sliding down into a glowing fiery devil
[8:56] spit of him right now
[9:01] he'll parts of Hell has opened up a part
[9:06] of him is manifesting itself on earth
[9:09] now by the actions the activities the
[9:15] display of the inside to the outside you
[9:19] can see hell manifesting itself and we
[9:25] are living in the middle of a living
[9:28] huge asylum here upon the earth it has
[9:35] been said by the prophet of Malachi 4:5
[9:41] shall come to pass that the entire world
[9:44] will go insane people will be insane
[9:48] everywhere 1964 when their eyes were
[9:54] opened listen we are living in a
[9:59] complete insane institution 1965
[10:04] communion yes sir
[10:06] the entire world has become like a
[10:10] complete insane institution with the
[10:14] people on the merry-go-round of madness
[10:17] and all kinds of ungodly unseemly
[10:23] perverted poisonous and evil things
[10:27] taking place around us and the devil has
[10:31] so proliferated it that is now becoming
[10:35] normalize ungodly acts ungodly things
[10:43] being done right openly and it's
[10:47] accepted as a norm era seems to sit upon
[10:51] the throne lies seem to reign and the
[10:56] truth seems to be on the streets a
[10:59] crying
[11:00] all my brothers my sisters back to the
[11:04] Bible back to the Word of God search the
[11:07] scriptures and see it been same you will
[11:10] see the truth don't just take what I say
[11:13] what the priests say what the Pope says
[11:17] or what the superintendent says take
[11:19] God's word for the Bible says that every
[11:23] man's work be aligned and my word be the
[11:27] truth that is how we should approach it
[11:29] brothers and sisters
[11:31] no this entire world is a pond of golf
[11:35] strain and that ghost train is speeding
[11:40] its way right to the last stop by life
[11:48] and by our nature we are displaying that
[11:55] we are on that train or when we're off
[11:57] that train I can tell you I'm not on
[12:01] that train I've left that train already
[12:03] I got off of it many years ago I gave my
[12:08] life to the Lord Jesus Christ and now
[12:10] I'm on the gospel train I'm on the glory
[12:14] train I'm headed home to glory but this
[12:19] other train is going in the opposite
[12:22] direction it's Satan ghost train and
[12:26] many people wrongly or rightly find
[12:31] themselves on that train by some mistake
[12:35] and they don't know how they get off oh
[12:38] stop the world stop the train I want to
[12:41] get off and it seems as if the train and
[12:44] the world keeps going around and they're
[12:47] handing up on it and that train makes
[12:50] stops along the way to pick up many
[12:54] other passengers and around that time is
[12:57] possible that a person if they're aware
[13:00] of what's happening they can get off
[13:02] that's happens junctions in our lives
[13:05] comes trials troubles opportunity comes
[13:10] and we must know by the gray
[13:13] of God when we are to get off of that
[13:17] train that we are on many call it the
[13:22] rat race many call it the race of life
[13:26] but that's that that's the human race
[13:29] that's on that kind of a train and you
[13:33] are on a train that's going from stop to
[13:36] stop giving you opportunities while
[13:39] you're getting lying to get off of that
[13:41] train but if you do not get off that
[13:44] train the last stop is going to be held
[13:49] hell is your last destination that that
[13:53] train
[13:54] ladies and gentlemen says the conductor
[13:56] the last stop coming up now and the last
[14:00] stop is called hell my friends you're
[14:04] headed for a town or a city that's
[14:06] called him and so we use the term tail
[14:10] bound help and there you are you bought
[14:14] your ticket by your actions by your
[14:17] nature listen a person can make mistakes
[14:21] and ask God for forgiveness and go on
[14:25] and God will wash them in his blood
[14:28] forgive them for their wrongdoing
[14:30] cleanse them from their sin like anyone
[14:33] else and my friends but then there are
[14:37] so many that it is their nature to sin
[14:40] not sin by a mistake but the nature the
[14:45] the desire is in them the unstoppable
[14:48] urge to sin is in them and so they are
[14:52] called a sinner not one that just sins
[14:55] and then ask God Oh Lord I made a
[14:57] mistake
[14:58] forgive me Lord I'm here I want to be
[15:01] your child your son and your daughter ah
[15:03] I slipped up I messed up Lord I'm
[15:06] turning around I'm coming to you Lord
[15:08] forgive me of my sins that's totally
[15:11] different than one who sits on that
[15:15] train and loves the view and loved them
[15:20] loves the pleasure love all those things
[15:23] and the train knowing many times for
[15:26] well knowing that train is hell bound I
[15:30] heard a man just today saying oh yes I'm
[15:35] gonna enjoy my life and even if I die
[15:38] this way then at least I lived well I
[15:41] don't I don't think that's really life
[15:43] you actually are dead while we were yet
[15:46] living if you're gonna be thinking like
[15:49] that so that train is bound to its last
[15:53] and final stop which is him and many
[15:58] others are on that train and really
[16:02] don't know that they're on that train
[16:05] they got on the train by making a
[16:09] mistake and here we find them Revelation
[16:13] chapter three verse 17 that the Bible
[16:18] tells us clearly that many say I'm rich
[16:23] I'm increased with Goods but the Lord
[16:28] says but knowest thou not in other words
[16:32] but you don't know you don't realize no
[16:35] it's now not my friends that were blind
[16:38] you miserable and the spiritually naked
[16:44] look warm if you're even a church member
[16:47] and don't even know it and know it it
[16:51] not you're on that train and don't
[16:55] realize that you're on a train that's
[16:58] held bound honestly to Satan's pit now
[17:04] in his mission series Oh H Ren the
[17:08] author mentioned that we are at war with
[17:12] the armies of darkness you know the
[17:16] scripture clearly tells us we are we do
[17:21] not fight against flesh and blood but
[17:24] against principalities and powers and
[17:26] spiritual wickedness in high places
[17:31] yes sir we are at war against the powers
[17:34] of darkness and the god of this evil age
[17:39] the book of Revelation chapter 12 the
[17:43] Bible tells us here in the Word of God
[17:46] chapter 12 verse 7 and there was war in
[17:51] heaven and Michael and his angels fought
[17:55] against the Dragon and the dragon fought
[17:58] with his angels and prevailed not he
[18:04] lost neither was their place found any
[18:07] more for him in heaven and the Great
[18:11] Dragon was cast out the old serpent
[18:16] called the devil and Satan which
[18:22] deceiveth the whole world he was cast
[18:27] out into the earth and his angels were
[18:33] cast out with him all of these devils
[18:38] and demons another part of the scripture
[18:41] tells us this was one third of the
[18:43] angels that he was able to persuade
[18:47] right
[18:49] came with him down to this earth to
[18:53] infest to to possess to control the
[18:58] minds hearts and the bodies of men to
[19:02] live in them and to commit demonic acts
[19:05] there all friends that is why the term
[19:09] was used we are living in an insane
[19:11] asylum
[19:13] surrounded by these walking corpses
[19:17] anointed and inspired by the devil and
[19:21] all of his evil works but thanks be to
[19:25] God we find out that he is a loser
[19:29] because in the book of Isaiah chapter 12
[19:33] we discover in the Word of God that
[19:39] Lucifer who became Satan that
[19:43] the evil one that old serpent speaking
[19:48] of his ancient wisdom was kicked out of
[19:51] heaven
[19:52] thanks be to God God kicked him out of
[19:54] heaven he will not put up with his
[19:56] actions as lies he will not put up with
[19:58] him with his evils hit with all of his
[20:01] uh subverting God's kingdom and his
[20:05] great conspiracy God kicked him out and
[20:09] you never right if you can believe God's
[20:12] Word
[20:13] whoever you are no matter how humble
[20:16] your life is or how mighty your life is
[20:18] no matter her accomplishments you have a
[20:21] right to kick him out of your life in
[20:24] the name of Jesus Christ and claim a
[20:27] complete victory over him for the Bible
[20:30] says they fought but they prevailed not
[20:34] and they were kicked out where were they
[20:37] kicked up up cast down upon the earth
[20:40] so we rather now right here among us
[20:44] these invisible invaders in a way a
[20:48] further part of that chapter it calls
[20:51] him 200 200 million horsemen 200 million
[20:57] deep monic horsemen upon the face of the
[21:00] earth attacking the entire human race
[21:03] true Envy because God claims them blames
[21:08] them that they are his children
[21:10] and he created them and placed them here
[21:13] and replaced him as the one that should
[21:16] be in charge now you must understand
[21:18] that Satan actually the right from first
[21:24] being called Lucifer when he was in
[21:27] heaven and we know that Lucifer
[21:33] according to the Bible read Isaiah 14 as
[21:37] we said he was the Light Bearer this
[21:41] main name means Light Bearer oh he was
[21:47] also the leader or worship leader up
[21:50] there in heaven he led the chorus he led
[21:54] every all the singing
[21:56] worship of Almighty God but after what
[21:59] got jealous of the worship God was
[22:03] receiving and then he began to create an
[22:09] evil conspiracy against the Most High
[22:12] God and by telling mom
[22:17] tales which we call lies with his long
[22:21] tail he was able to pull in one turn of
[22:28] the excerpt of the Angels on his side
[22:31] and there with that third of the angels
[22:35] this evil one began to try to offer
[22:42] throw the kingdom of God but the Bible
[22:46] tells us and there was warned in heaven
[22:49] and Michael fought with his angels and
[22:54] defeated Lucifer and his angels and so
[22:59] when he was kicked out his nature
[23:04] changed his name got changed
[23:07] it wasn't Lucifer anymore he wasn't
[23:10] bearing any light anymore but he was now
[23:14] the Prince of Darkness
[23:16] he was now called Satan he was called an
[23:20] evil one he was called that great dragon
[23:24] he was called that old serpent yes sir
[23:28] and a Bible said he was kicked out he
[23:31] was cast out no wonder jesus said in my
[23:35] name if thou cats believe in my name you
[23:39] cast out devils your lay hands upon the
[23:42] sick and they shall recover oh yes so we
[23:46] as believers have the right to cast out
[23:50] the devil anywhere he rares up his head
[23:53] and we can recognize it we have the
[23:56] right to cast him out oh praise God
[23:59] forevermore
[24:00] that evil one that Prince of Darkness
[24:04] uh-uh
[24:05] I also want to draw attention to another
[24:08] one of
[24:09] names he has many names dosa those are
[24:12] just names him so here it is he's also
[24:14] called Beelzebub no Beelzebub
[24:19] which means Lord of the dung heap or
[24:25] translation Lord of the Flies that's
[24:29] inspired many things in this modern day
[24:31] but that is the name of Beelzebub right
[24:36] which means Lord of the dung heap or
[24:40] Lord of the Flies or lord of demons
[24:46] Beelzebub and he was cast out in the
[24:51] name of Jesus Christ thank God
[24:54] we are not of his army but we are of the
[24:59] Lord's posts we are of the armies of
[25:03] light I am of the army of light I trust
[25:08] you are of the army of light I want to
[25:12] ask whose army are you in in Romans 13
[25:18] in Galatians 5 Paul describes the works
[25:23] and the lifestyle of those who have
[25:27] membership in this army of Darkness he
[25:34] says in Romans chapter 13 listen closely
[25:44] verses 12 the night is far spent and the
[25:54] day is at hand let us therefore cast off
[26:00] the works of darkness and let us put on
[26:06] the armor of light works of darkness let
[26:11] us walk honestly as in the date time not
[26:17] in writin and in drunkenness not in
[26:22] chambering
[26:23] whirring and in wantonness not in strife
[26:27] and in Envy envying but put on the Lord
[26:32] Jesus Christ and make no provision for
[26:36] the flesh and the book of Galatians Paul
[26:41] continues to describe the activities of
[26:45] this army of Darkness check yourself to
[26:49] see when whether you are a member of
[26:52] this army whose side are you on Joshua
[26:58] was asked the question and he said I am
[27:01] on the Lord side I trust you will say
[27:04] the same today Paul speaking now the
[27:08] works of the flesh are manifest which
[27:12] are these adultery fornication
[27:17] uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry
[27:23] witchcraft hatred variance emulations
[27:31] wrath strife seditions heresies all mine
[27:39] praise God
[27:40] envyings murders drunkenness revellings
[27:46] and such lake of which I tell you as
[27:52] before I have also told you in times
[27:55] past that they which do such things
[27:58] shall not inherit the kingdom of God my
[28:04] friends there is late the coming of the
[28:08] Lord is at hand and the entire world is
[28:12] deceiving itself the world is in a
[28:18] terrible state and trying to console
[28:23] itself in this modern age by science by
[28:29] technology trying to console itself that
[28:33] everything is all right never mind
[28:37] the signs in the climate never mind the
[28:42] signs in the heavens above never mind a
[28:47] signs upon the earth beneath earthquakes
[28:51] Wars rumors of wars nation against
[28:57] nation Kingdom against Kingdom as Jesus
[29:00] said in Matthew 24 pestilences striking
[29:05] the earth everywhere and still
[29:07] disobedient man refuses to listen to the
[29:13] voice of God and to the science he spoke
[29:16] of over two thousand years ago that they
[29:21] will come upon here and when you see
[29:23] these things know that my coming is
[29:26] there look up lift up your head for your
[29:29] intentions right now think about it but
[29:33] the world keeps consoling itself with
[29:36] parties with all enjoyment with
[29:38] money-making with in every manner of
[29:42] distraction that Satan can provide their
[29:45] den going in two different directions
[29:48] away from the Word of God trying to say
[29:52] everything is on right some will say oh
[29:56] brother Satan it's my life
[29:58] leave me alone I just want to live my
[30:01] life and have my way but be careful
[30:05] don't you be like a frightened little
[30:12] boy whistling in the dark and trying to
[30:17] convince himself that he's not afraid
[30:21] I'm not afraid I'm not afraid but he is
[30:24] whistling as loud as he can he is
[30:28] playing his boom box or his music as
[30:31] loud as he can and if possible he'll put
[30:36] Stoppers in his ears so that he can't
[30:39] hear the voice of God speaking to him
[30:43] but in reality you're whistling in the
[30:47] dark it is a very sign of
[30:50] fear it's the sign that something inside
[30:54] of you is telling you something is
[30:57] fixing to happen and you need to be
[31:01] prepared and get ready for the scripture
[31:04] says prepare to meet thy God and after
[31:09] death the judgment Oh rather sister you
[31:13] say about brother Simon you're
[31:14] old-fashioned
[31:15] all that preaching about handling and
[31:19] going into a fiery pit it's all imagery
[31:22] it's it's not really it's just a
[31:25] pictorial Bible language it's not true
[31:28] I'm here to tell you friends to late
[31:32] will to late will be the cry you take
[31:36] that chance to leap in the dark close
[31:40] your eyes and step into the dirt beyond
[31:43] with no one there to greet or meet nor
[31:47] shining light to welcome you will be a
[31:52] horrible experience for you I warn you
[31:55] in the name of Jesus Christ give your
[31:59] life to Him while there is yet time to
[32:01] give your life and be not a member of
[32:05] this army of the Living Dead give your
[32:09] life to Jesus Christ oh yes the young
[32:12] boy going through the graveyard trying
[32:14] to you know prove to everybody else
[32:18] around I'm not afraid I'm not a rape
[32:20] Fred but it's whistling so loudly but
[32:23] you're really afraid of what lies ahead
[32:26] of you you're really afraid of the
[32:30] unseen that's in the dark you do not
[32:33] know what next is going to happen and I
[32:37] want to say this is that something I'm
[32:39] making up because as a boy I experienced
[32:46] this in my own hometown I went to the
[32:52] cinema at night and - I went to see the
[32:57] movie
[33:00] congratula and that was in
[33:04] neighbouring town I forgot I totally
[33:09] forgot that after seeing such a horror
[33:13] movie I had to get back to my town at
[33:20] late at night and I had to walk through
[33:26] a dark unlit winding country road that
[33:34] made its way of all places through a
[33:39] graveyard
[33:41] that was 1 mile long graveyards
[33:46] on both sides of this pitch-black dark
[33:51] country road and there I was as a little
[33:59] boy inside trembling but not wanting to
[34:05] anyone to know that I was afraid I was
[34:11] whistling away whistling away because I
[34:16] was afraid to walk through that
[34:18] graveyard
[34:19] well this world is a graveyard if you're
[34:22] not afraid if you're not recognizing
[34:24] what's going to this happening to this
[34:27] world how its heading down the the
[34:30] greasy pole right to you right my
[34:34] friends right down to a hill right now
[34:36] we need to take a stock of ourselves and
[34:40] ask the Lord Jesus to have his way with
[34:42] in our lives and so there I was in the
[34:47] darkness walking through this graveyard
[34:50] acting as if I was unafraid but very
[34:55] soon that was going to change because
[35:00] suddenly in the dark I heard such a
[35:04] blood-curdling screaming and screeching
[35:08] coming from a bombs of tombs that was
[35:13] enough for me and with the fleet feet
[35:16] and running
[35:18] that you can only get from a little boy
[35:21] I ran I ran non-stop until I got home
[35:31] with my beating something heart I got
[35:35] home and I want to say my friends don't
[35:40] you deceive yourself don't just live
[35:47] blindly in the darkness of this age
[35:52] don't try to convince yourself that
[35:57] because you're well-off or maybe because
[36:02] you're rich you're fashionable that you
[36:06] have no fears of your future don't
[36:13] deceive yourself because you have a good
[36:17] job a wonderful education and so you
[36:25] have no fear for your future please
[36:31] don't allow yourself to be captured by
[36:34] such thoughts or captivated by such
[36:38] thoughts don't allow yourself to be
[36:41] captured by these armies of darkness and
[36:46] to become a slave to the dark side of
[36:48] life your secret dark side hidden from
[36:55] everyone but known only to you and on
[36:59] 1-liter him are the dark hidden secrets
