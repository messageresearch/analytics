[31:52] thank you brother Bill
[31:55] praise God
[32:01] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[32:03] tonight
[32:04] I'm trusting that um
[32:06] you've all had a good week up until now
[32:11] and that it's just going to get better
[32:12] from here on in
[32:14] by the grace of God because when we get
[32:17] together in the house of the Lord every
[32:19] single time
[32:21] that you gather Yourself In God's
[32:23] Presence under this type of ministry
[32:28] atmosphere
[32:29] where you're under expectation that the
[32:32] word of God is going to speak to your
[32:34] needs then you will leave much better
[32:37] than you came in and you'll be blessed
[32:40] and you'll you'll understand things
[32:42] better you will grow in the Lord you
[32:46] won't understand why it is that you
[32:48] continue to overcome but it's as a
[32:50] result of you feeding on the word of God
[32:53] and and whether you're here or whether
[32:57] you're there at home watching on YouTube
[33:00] if your faith is to receive something
[33:04] from God you're going to get it it's
[33:06] just as simple as that amen because
[33:09] we're not living in the hour where it's
[33:11] man that's feeding you this is the hour
[33:14] where God is feeding you it's always
[33:18] been that way for the true Sons and
[33:20] Daughters of God they expect to hear
[33:23] from God receive from God Be
[33:25] strengthened by the word of God and
[33:27] overcome by the word of God Amen praise
[33:30] God so tonight we're going to be um
[33:34] we're going to be continuing uh on a on
[33:36] a series that we've started
[33:39] um he's calling my name
[33:41] amen He's Calling My Name I know that
[33:44] you know that uh he's been calling your
[33:47] name otherwise you wouldn't even be here
[33:51] it's it's it's it's a supernatural thing
[33:54] you know this this call Upon Our Lives
[33:57] it's not because we decided to join that
[34:01] church because all the pastor seems to
[34:03] be you know a really good pastor and you
[34:06] know he he really knows how to preach
[34:07] the word
[34:08] that's great that's wonderful if you
[34:11] want to belong to a denominational
[34:13] church but if you're belonging to the
[34:15] body of Jesus Christ
[34:17] it's because something supernatural has
[34:19] taken place in your life
[34:21] and that you know now that you are not
[34:24] in a a membership of a church body but
[34:29] you're actually a part of the mystical
[34:31] body of Jesus Christ amen praise God and
[34:35] so tonight
[34:37] we're going to be um
[34:39] uh looking at uh a thought here next
[34:44] slide uh
[34:46] you can't see it there I guess I don't
[34:48] know why in mine it's it's all blue but
[34:51] for some reason
[34:53] it's oh I see it's not really coming
[34:55] through properly
[34:57] for some reason but that's okay
[35:00] um
[35:00] the thought is on progressive revelation
[35:04] okay that we have been you know when you
[35:07] actually were called of God is because
[35:11] God called you by revelation
[35:14] and so let's just go to uh prayer and
[35:17] then we're going to get into the word
[35:18] amen father
[35:19] we are so grateful tonight Lord
[35:22] that we can assemble knowing that your
[35:25] spirit your presence is with us here
[35:28] tonight Lord and will take control lift
[35:31] us all up into Heavenly places and speak
[35:35] to our needs so that we can leave here
[35:37] different than we than what we were when
[35:40] we came in father that is our desire
[35:42] Lord
[35:43] granted tonight Lord remember our pastor
[35:46] remember the saints that are at home
[35:49] that
[35:50] have needs tonight Lord remember all
[35:53] those that are sick and Afflicted Among
[35:56] Us Lord and won't you just raise them up
[35:58] father all these prayer requests that
[36:00] have come through Lord that child that
[36:04] um that that that fell in in Trinidad
[36:06] Lord I pray that you'll remember that
[36:09] child tonight Lord that your spirit is
[36:12] ministering we know that you're
[36:13] ministering there right now and that you
[36:15] will raise that child up in the name of
[36:17] Jesus Christ Lord we just we just commit
[36:20] all things tonight into your hands Lord
[36:22] we love you we appreciate you we thank
[36:24] you Lord anoint the word speaker and
[36:27] hearer father For Your Glory in Jesus
[36:30] name amen praise God
[36:35] so let's look at the first scripture
[36:39] very familiar scripture
[36:44] okay that that's looking better
[36:46] next slide
[36:52] okay
[36:54] so there may be an issue with the um
[36:56] with the actual file but I'm going to
[36:58] read the scriptures
[37:00] so the scriptures from Hebrews chapter
[37:02] 11 verses 1 to 11.
[37:06] familiar scriptures
[37:07] but I want you to pay attention here
[37:09] while I'm reading the scripture I want
[37:11] you to keep in mind
[37:13] about the thought that we have here
[37:15] tonight that that Revelation is
[37:18] something that is Progressive in our
[37:20] lives amen the progression of Revelation
[37:24] is what we as Sons and Daughters of God
[37:27] are inspired by
[37:29] you can't continue to serve god with
[37:33] passion and with with Zeal and uh you
[37:38] know with with that with that uh
[37:39] motivation
[37:41] uh unless God is inspiring you unless
[37:45] God is revealing himself more and more
[37:47] to you amen and and this whole uh um
[37:51] experience that we're having is leading
[37:54] us into the Rapture and the Rapture
[37:56] itself brother Brown said the Rapture
[37:58] was a revelation
[38:00] but within that Revelation there is
[38:03] progression
[38:04] and the and the progression of the word
[38:07] is never going to stop and wait for
[38:10] anybody
[38:11] it's not going to wait for you
[38:13] you will notice that that uh you know as
[38:16] the word progresses you're going to see
[38:19] some that are just going to be left
[38:21] behind
[38:22] it's it's not because uh you know uh
[38:27] you are better or or any different than
[38:30] anybody else but it's just because you
[38:33] have an attribute of God within you that
[38:36] allows you to receive Revelation to
[38:39] progress into the fullness of the
[38:42] rapture
[38:43] this is not about uh joining a certain
[38:47] church and if you belong to that church
[38:49] you're going to go in the rapture no
[38:51] it's an individual walk with God
[38:55] so pay attention here uh verse one now
[38:58] Faith is the substance of things hoped
[39:01] for the evidence of Things Not Seen
[39:04] always replace the word faith with
[39:07] revelation
[39:09] okay it's a substance it's something
[39:11] real it's something that that you know
[39:14] that that you don't see it
[39:16] but there's evidence by it living in
[39:20] your life through your life and allowing
[39:22] you to continue to walk this walk with
[39:24] God
[39:26] buy it the elders obtained a good report
[39:33] through faith we understand that the
[39:36] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[39:40] that things which are seen were not made
[39:43] of things which do appear
[39:46] we understand that the word of God has a
[39:49] supernatural power
[39:51] to frame the worlds
[39:54] to frame your world
[39:57] to frame your life to give you
[40:00] everything that you have need of in
[40:03] order to overcome in this Dimension and
[40:05] this walk that you're walking that
[40:08] you're overcoming listen you all have
[40:10] battles every single one of us has
[40:13] battles that we need to overcome
[40:17] we wouldn't be an overcomer if there
[40:19] wasn't something to overcome amen by
[40:23] faith Abel offered unto God a more
[40:27] excellent sacrifice than Cain by which
[40:30] he obtained witness that he was
[40:31] righteous
[40:33] God testifying of his gifts and by it he
[40:38] being dead dead yet speaketh
[40:42] God Vindicated by giving a revelation to
[40:46] Abel exactly what it was that was
[40:48] required
[40:49] as the sacrifice
[40:52] and through that experience God was
[40:55] vindicating that Abel had revelation of
[40:59] what he was doing
[41:01] and in the same thing in your life when
[41:04] you offer up your gift
[41:07] your walk
[41:10] your ministry whatever it is that God
[41:12] has placed upon you that when you when
[41:15] you offer it unto the Lord and you're
[41:17] offering it because God has revealed to
[41:19] you your ministry God has revealed to
[41:22] you what he requires God is
[41:24] progressively revelating you to move on
[41:28] with him it testifies that God is in
[41:31] your life
[41:32] and that you're on the right track and
[41:34] it also inspires you to know that you're
[41:36] on the right track
[41:38] perfect Faith listen perfect Revelation
[41:42] is when you can recognize your part in
[41:46] the word
[41:47] and actually see it being fulfilled in
[41:51] your life
[41:52] that's the element that the whole church
[41:54] world out there
[41:56] can't recognize
[41:58] that's not something that they can
[42:00] receive
[42:02] only the attributes of God can actually
[42:05] receive this kind of faith and this kind
[42:09] of perfect faith
[42:11] by faith Enoch was translated that he
[42:15] should not see death and was not found
[42:18] because God had translated him
[42:22] for before his translation he had this
[42:25] testimony that he pleased God
[42:29] now we we just read right at the
[42:31] beginning of Hebrews 11 that with that
[42:33] well you're going to see it that without
[42:35] faith it's impossible to please God
[42:38] amen
[42:40] he had a testimony that he pleased God
[42:42] why did Enoch please God
[42:46] because he had the ability to receive
[42:48] faith in his life and actually live it
[42:52] speak it back to God
[42:55] speak it back to the body of Christ
[42:57] that's how you are a nourishment to the
[43:00] body of Christ that's how it is that you
[43:02] edify the body of Christ is when you're
[43:04] able to receive divine revelation of god
[43:07] of what he requires of you to do in the
[43:11] body and then when you do it and you
[43:13] actually act and you because you're
[43:16] hearing you're recognizing now you're
[43:18] acting
[43:19] right it shows that that God is in you
[43:24] because this is not the hour where where
[43:27] man is going to interpret God's word no
[43:30] God is his own interpreter God will make
[43:33] it plain God is going to show exactly
[43:35] what he's going to do
[43:37] because without faith here's the next
[43:39] scripture without faith it is impossible
[43:42] to please him for he that cometh to God
[43:45] must believe that he is
[43:48] and that he is a rewarder of those who
[43:51] diligently seek him
[43:54] you know these scriptures they just keep
[43:56] coming to life
[43:57] they just never stop uh you know uh
[44:01] unleashing that progressive revelation
[44:03] that that we are feeding on on a daily
[44:06] basis
[44:08] he that cometh to God must believe that
[44:10] he is you need to know that greater is
[44:12] he that is in you
[44:14] that he that is in the world
[44:16] you need to know that you need to
[44:18] recognize that otherwise you you'll
[44:19] never overcome in this hour
[44:22] because this is the most deceiving hour
[44:25] on the face of the Earth
[44:30] next scripture by faith by Revelation
[44:34] Noah being warned by God of things not
[44:38] yet seen moved with fear
[44:42] fear of God
[44:44] because he came into a real true
[44:46] experience with God and when you have
[44:49] that real true experience with God you
[44:52] will have a fear of God knowing that God
[44:54] knows your life
[44:55] God's watching you God God knows your
[44:57] whole you can't you can't hide
[45:01] he requires that he he requires for you
[45:04] to know that there's nothing that that
[45:06] you should hold back from him there's
[45:09] nothing that you should keep from him
[45:11] there's nothing that that you should be
[45:12] ashamed of
[45:14] if you make mistakes you overcome you
[45:16] you seek re you repent and you seek the
[45:19] Lord and you move on
[45:21] this is how we overcome
[45:24] this is the hour that that that you're
[45:27] you're Justified
[45:30] there's never been a time like this time
[45:34] how are we going to go in the Rapture
[45:36] how are we going to have rapturing faith
[45:38] if if we've got condemnation all around
[45:41] us all the time oh I shouldn't have said
[45:43] that I oh boy I made a big mistake no no
[45:46] just deal with it and get on with your
[45:48] walk
[45:50] deal with it you're this is the hour of
[45:52] maturity where you come into the
[45:54] maturity of the word where you recognize
[45:56] that this is not about play church this
[45:59] is listen there's world events that are
[46:01] taking place right now all around us
[46:03] that are leading us into a tribulation
[46:06] this world is going into Great
[46:08] Tribulation whether you like it or you
[46:10] don't like it it's just the way it is
[46:13] the scripture said that this is where
[46:15] we're headed
[46:16] and so we can't change that
[46:19] so this is this is a time where you need
[46:21] to really know who you are
[46:26] moved with fear prepared an ark
[46:29] for the saving of his house by which he
[46:32] condemned the world and became heir of
[46:35] the righteousness which is by revelation
[46:41] it's not going to come any other way
[46:45] you know I I often think about like
[46:48] lord it's it's incredible
[46:50] how
[46:52] that passion and that desire
[46:54] and that Zeal for the word of God it's
[46:57] it's it's it's it's there it's a fire
[47:00] it's in my life but it but I come to
[47:02] realize that it's because he keeps
[47:04] giving revelation
[47:06] he's progressively giving Revelation to
[47:11] overcome on a daily basis everything
[47:14] that we face amen this is how you know
[47:18] that you are an attribute of God
[47:21] is because it's not something you do
[47:24] all you do is you you know you you
[47:26] overcome by coming to church by reading
[47:30] the the word by listening to the word by
[47:33] you know by by doing the things that you
[47:35] know are going to feed your relationship
[47:37] with God when you do that God does the
[47:41] rest
[47:41] brother Burnham says that when you go to
[47:43] church Jesus Christ is waiting there for
[47:47] you
[47:47] he's already there waiting for you to
[47:50] come into His presence so that he can
[47:53] speak to you so that he can feed you and
[47:55] give you everything that you have need
[47:57] of so that you can overcome and feel
[48:00] confident as a Son of God feel feel uh
[48:04] uh encouraged by the word of God and
[48:07] know that you are a son or a daughter of
[48:10] God and that you will overcome
[48:12] there's nothing that can take you down
[48:16] not in this hour this is the season
[48:18] where God's going to interpret his word
[48:21] and all he's looking for is yielded
[48:23] vessels that recognize that that have
[48:25] come into perfect revelation of who he
[48:28] is amen praise God by faith verse 8
[48:31] Abraham
[48:33] when he was called to go out into a
[48:36] place which he should later receive for
[48:39] an inheritance obeyed
[48:42] and he went out not knowing whether he
[48:44] went
[48:48] think about it Saints
[48:50] you don't know everything that
[48:53] tomorrow holds
[48:56] you don't know that
[48:57] you're gonna go to work next week and
[49:00] and maybe there's going to be a big
[49:01] layoff
[49:03] you don't know that
[49:04] but because you started this walk with
[49:07] God
[49:08] by Revelation and you know that you know
[49:11] that you know that that he's the author
[49:13] and the finisher of your faith
[49:16] that he is Jehovah Jireh that's going to
[49:19] provide all of your Finance
[49:23] you know that
[49:26] you're going to be you've got the same
[49:28] faith that Abraham has
[49:30] when you walk with God in that way and
[49:33] you trust God that much
[49:35] I don't care if you go to work next week
[49:38] and you get laid off God has a better
[49:40] job waiting for you
[49:43] [Music]
[49:44] amen
[49:46] there's nothing too hard for God is
[49:49] there anything too hard for the Lord
[49:52] praise God
[49:54] he didn't know where he was going but by
[49:56] faith verse 9 he sojourned in the land
[50:00] of promise as in a strange country
[50:03] dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and
[50:06] Jacob The Heirs with him of the same
[50:10] promise
[50:12] the same promise
[50:14] you are experiencing the same promise
[50:17] for he looked for a city which hath with
[50:21] hath foundations whose Builder
[50:23] and maker is God
[50:26] everything that that we are working
[50:30] towards
[50:31] and I'm talking about the things here on
[50:34] this Earth
[50:35] all that you do all that that that
[50:38] concerns you your your family
[50:42] your home
[50:44] your job
[50:46] your relationships all those things
[50:50] are being molded and shaped by God
[50:55] for you as an attribute of God
[50:59] you're living in this world
[51:01] but you're not of this world
[51:04] you know it
[51:06] you know for sure how many have been
[51:09] recognizing that more and more you look
[51:11] out there you look at the conditions you
[51:13] look at the situations you look at
[51:15] what's going on around you you know
[51:18] you're not of this world
[51:20] foreign
[51:22] but your world
[51:24] is being controlled
[51:27] and molded and shaped by God
[51:32] by his word
[51:35] we read the scripture
[51:37] the worlds were framed by the word of
[51:39] God everything in your life is Being
[51:41] Framed by God's word
[51:44] you can you can have confidence to know
[51:46] that everything works for good
[51:49] you know that you you go do certain
[51:51] things you build certain things and you
[51:53] make a mistake it's okay
[51:55] it's going to work for good
[51:58] it's got actually going to work for your
[52:00] good how many can look back on their
[52:01] lives now and see all the trials and all
[52:04] the situations and the things that that
[52:07] we've gone through and look back now and
[52:09] see that you know what God has done in
[52:11] your life the character that he's
[52:13] developed in your life the wisdom that
[52:15] he's given you and to know that God
[52:18] worked all those things for good
[52:24] through faith
[52:26] verse 11.
[52:28] and this is a type of you and me
[52:31] Sarah herself received strength
[52:35] conceived seed and was delivered of a
[52:38] child when she was past the age because
[52:40] she judged him faithful who had promised
[52:46] praise God forevermore
[52:48] you can believe for for
[52:50] Supernatural things to take place in
[52:53] your life
[52:54] if sickness comes into your life or
[52:56] comes into your home or comes into your
[52:58] family if God can can reverse Sarah's
[53:02] organs to the point where she can give
[53:04] birth to a child why can't God heal your
[53:07] organs or heal your body or heal your
[53:10] son or heal your daughter or heal your
[53:13] mother or heal your why can't he
[53:17] it's simple
[53:19] why because we are faithful to believe
[53:23] the promises of God Amen praise God
[53:26] and our our next scripture
[53:29] is um
[53:31] is from uh Ephesians chapter 3
[53:34] verses three to six
[53:38] it says how that by revelation
[53:41] he made known unto me the mystery as I
[53:45] wrote a four in few words whereby when
[53:47] you read you may understand my knowledge
[53:51] in the mystery of Christ
[53:53] which in other Ages was not made known
[53:56] Unto the Sons of men
[53:58] as it is now revealed unto His Holy
[54:02] Apostles and Prophets by the spirit
[54:07] that Gentiles should be fellow heirs
[54:10] that's you and me
[54:13] and the same body and partakers of his
[54:16] promise in Christ
[54:18] by the gospel
[54:20] praise God forevermore
[54:23] listen
[54:26] something must take place now we're
[54:29] talking about progressive revelation
[54:32] things something has to take place in
[54:34] order for something else to take place
[54:37] that's how things work
[54:39] and if you look back this whole Bible
[54:42] from Genesis to revelation
[54:44] is God giving progressive revelation
[54:47] that's going to lead us into the Rapture
[54:50] in this day and in this hour we need to
[54:53] recognize the season of the word
[54:57] we're not looking for Moses we're not
[54:59] looking for for Jeremiah or Isaiah or
[55:04] John the Baptist no no no we are looking
[55:06] for the rapture
[55:08] we are in the season of The Rapture
[55:11] after the Rapture we are three and a
[55:14] half years in Fellowship
[55:17] with the Lord and the Saints for three
[55:20] and a half year honeymoon but guess what
[55:23] we got to come back
[55:25] and there's going to be another thousand
[55:27] years of time
[55:31] ouch
[55:32] but not for you and me
[55:35] yeah we have to come
[55:37] but we will be in Eternal bodies
[55:39] it'll be a lot different than
[55:42] the way we are right now
[55:45] it's been a progression of Revelation
[55:48] coming down from Genesis
[55:50] all the way down
[55:52] to this day and this time and this
[55:55] season
[55:56] and so
[55:57] you're either in progression or
[56:00] regression
[56:05] your walk is either progressing with God
[56:08] or you're standing still
[56:11] or you've gone back
[56:13] this is the hour where the word is
[56:17] moving on the truth is moving on and you
[56:21] have to recognize that you're in that
[56:23] progression
[56:25] that you're in the Rapture by Revelation
[56:27] and you're waiting upon Revelation lying
[56:31] upon lying precept upon precept when you
[56:34] come into the house of the Lord you are
[56:36] receiving Supernatural strength by the
[56:39] word of God to be translated your your
[56:42] cells are being changed you are now in
[56:46] the state of transformation you are
[56:49] going to be changed this Mortal shall
[56:51] put on immortality
[56:54] that can only happen by the supernatural
[56:57] word of God
[56:58] people talk about the Rapture but you
[57:01] have to be in it you have to be
[57:04] experiencing it by the word you have to
[57:06] be a part of the body of Christ you've
[57:09] got to belong to a church where you know
[57:11] that you are feeding on divine
[57:14] revelation that you're being revelated
[57:16] and inspired and you're receiving the
[57:19] stimulation that comes from the
[57:21] Revelation that's what that's how you
[57:24] know that you know that you know that
[57:25] you're being changed that you're not
[57:28] just a church member you're not just by
[57:30] by tradition you're you go to church
[57:33] once a week or twice a week or whatever
[57:35] it is this is not tradition this is
[57:38] Supernatural change that's taking place
[57:40] right now in the body of Christ
[57:43] every single person on Earth has a place
[57:47] in the word of God
[57:49] including the atheist
[57:53] there's everything that that that that
[57:55] that we know
[57:57] that we read in the word of God we're
[57:59] seeing it being manifest and being
[58:01] fulfilled in the world around us
[58:05] as the word progresses everyone's
[58:07] placing in the word becomes evident
[58:12] your progression in the word you're
[58:15] walking with God and your your personal
[58:18] experience with God shows where you are
[58:23] in the season of the word
[58:27] that's why we have to take inventory
[58:29] every now and then that's why you know
[58:31] uh it starts right here in the house of
[58:33] the Lord where God speaks to us and gets
[58:35] us to do a checkup
[58:37] you know and it's not a checkup like the
[58:39] doctor it's a checkup from the neck up
[58:42] what's going on inside here and what's
[58:44] going on inside there
[58:46] to find out where you really are where
[58:48] like
[58:50] where's your experience with God how
[58:53] real is it to you do you know that
[58:55] you're being changed you know that
[58:57] change is taking place in your life do
[58:59] you know that that that that that that
[59:01] you're progressing in the word of God
[59:06] only attributes of God can recognize
[59:09] this
[59:12] this is the thing that is a bit of a
[59:14] paradox
[59:16] as an attribute of God you will
[59:18] recognize the supernatural element
[59:21] that's taking place every time you feed
[59:24] on the word of God
[59:25] every experience that you your walk is
[59:27] is is every day all the everything that
[59:31] you're doing as an attribute of God you
[59:34] are conscious of God
[59:36] you are conscious of God this is is lazy
[59:40] this thing here it'll it'll pull you in
[59:44] directions that you don't want to go
[59:46] it gets tired it gets angry it gets you
[59:49] upset before you know it you've got you
[59:52] you get into little you know little uh
[59:54] struggles with with uh with your friends
[59:57] with your family sometimes with your
[59:58] brothers and sisters
[1:00:00] and and and you wonder you know like but
[1:00:02] that's this
[1:00:03] that's that's understanding the
[1:00:05] difference of of what it is to be a Son
[1:00:08] of God to be a daughter of God and what
[1:00:10] it is to be a human being
[1:00:13] we need to be you know spiritually
[1:00:16] minded but we also need to be Earthly
[1:00:18] minded
[1:00:20] we can't be all spiritually minded
[1:00:23] you can't be totally 100 spiritual and
[1:00:28] live in this earth
[1:00:30] you'll be miserable
[1:00:32] you'll be fighting constantly people
[1:00:34] will be looking at you and they don't
[1:00:36] want to be around you because all you
[1:00:38] talk about is Jesus this Jesus that oh
[1:00:40] you know you need to change this you
[1:00:41] need to change you're condemning people
[1:00:43] all the time you don't sin in your life
[1:00:45] there's sin here that's in there
[1:00:48] it's the grace of God that you are where
[1:00:52] you are tonight
[1:00:55] you didn't do anything to deserve
[1:00:57] revelation
[1:00:59] it's God that gives Revelation it's God
[1:01:02] that gives faith
[1:01:04] it's him that gives you the ability to
[1:01:07] progress and to look at tomorrow and
[1:01:10] overcome tomorrow and deal with next
[1:01:13] week and next year and everything else
[1:01:16] that you've got to deal with
[1:01:18] amen
[1:01:21] you can react to the word
[1:01:23] but there is a huge difference to
[1:01:25] reacting whether it is by fear
[1:01:29] or whether it is by faith
[1:01:33] some people react by fear
[1:01:36] some people are living you know and and
[1:01:38] and and all their decisions are based on
[1:01:41] fear
[1:01:44] as Sons and Daughters of God if you're
[1:01:47] going to fear anything fear God
[1:01:50] but don't fear anything else
[1:01:54] do not fear what man can do
[1:01:58] but fear what God can do
[1:02:01] and know that God can make all things
[1:02:03] possible
[1:02:04] to them that believe
[1:02:07] it's one thing to be able to recognize
[1:02:09] the word of God and act upon the word of
[1:02:12] God and then there's one and then
[1:02:14] there's people that that that that will
[1:02:17] recognize the word of God and react
[1:02:20] to the word of God
[1:02:21] there's two different things
[1:02:24] acting is knowing what to do with the
[1:02:27] word
[1:02:28] reacting is fear
[1:02:31] oh I don't know how how am I going to
[1:02:33] deal with this how am I going to deal
[1:02:34] with that
[1:02:36] pray
[1:02:39] one knows what to do with the word the
[1:02:41] other one guesses
[1:02:43] and is wondering
[1:02:46] we we're not Wanderers
[1:02:50] praise God Amen Hallelujah
[1:02:54] this is this is the time in the season
[1:02:56] where
[1:02:58] the revelation of the word and you know
[1:03:00] we've been feasting these last you know
[1:03:03] well it just it's just constant you know
[1:03:06] we're we're blessed that we have the
[1:03:08] ability to to Feast on the word of God
[1:03:11] under a pastor that that is inspired
[1:03:14] that that comes here yields himself sets
[1:03:17] himself aside and then you having faith
[1:03:20] you start pulling on that word and and
[1:03:22] and we recognize how it is that we are
[1:03:25] being uh uh revelated by the word of God
[1:03:28] to overcome the situations that we're
[1:03:31] dealing with on a daily basis
[1:03:33] and you know there's you know there's
[1:03:35] many uh controversies that are going on
[1:03:38] right now even within the message you
[1:03:41] know about you know like situations
[1:03:44] where oh you can just belong to a tate
[1:03:47] Ministry actually you should just belong
[1:03:49] to a tape Ministry you should only be
[1:03:51] listening to the prophet
[1:03:53] that's nonsense
[1:03:55] we listen to the prophet
[1:03:58] we hear the the we quote the prophet
[1:04:04] listen here's a quote right now in front
[1:04:06] of me here God is his own interpreter
[1:04:08] now remember you Christians were his
[1:04:12] thoughts before there was a world and
[1:04:14] you are the manifestation of his
[1:04:16] thinking before there even was a world
[1:04:20] you were in Christ amen in God in the
[1:04:24] beginning that makes you then you see
[1:04:27] his subjects and the whole thing is God
[1:04:31] himself materializing himself tangible
[1:04:35] so he could be handled seen and so forth
[1:04:39] and that's what God is the whole thing
[1:04:43] and that's from 1964 God is his own
[1:04:46] interpreter
[1:04:48] and she and people want to what want to
[1:04:51] tell us and say that all you just you
[1:04:54] just you just you just push play and you
[1:04:56] only listen to the prophet and you don't
[1:04:58] need to be under a Ministry
[1:05:01] so all of a sudden
[1:05:03] God is only
[1:05:06] speaking through tapes
[1:05:11] no
[1:05:13] and that's the thing that's that's
[1:05:15] that's where like
[1:05:16] it doesn't even make sense to me
[1:05:19] God took a mule
[1:05:22] and spoke through a mule to Balaam
[1:05:27] and so now all of a sudden God is only
[1:05:30] speaking through the tapes
[1:05:33] that's not my experience with God
[1:05:37] I hear God speaking through people that
[1:05:40] I just first meet sometimes
[1:05:43] you will hear God speak in all aspects
[1:05:48] of your walk
[1:05:50] you know
[1:05:52] um I was listening to you know uh uh you
[1:05:55] know I was listening to a testimony on
[1:05:56] the voice of God
[1:05:58] and the testimony was a was about a
[1:06:00] brother in the Congo
[1:06:02] and he he's a pastor of a tape Church
[1:06:06] now I want you to catch what I'm saying
[1:06:09] here okay I'm not putting anything down
[1:06:12] I'm I'm bringing a thought and a point
[1:06:14] here that that really blessed me when
[1:06:17] when God revealed it to me
[1:06:19] he's a pastor of a tape Church in a
[1:06:22] small City in the Congo
[1:06:24] and what happened was he had ruptured
[1:06:26] blood vessels and needed immediate
[1:06:28] surgery
[1:06:30] and so
[1:06:33] they went that he could not get to the
[1:06:36] church for the immediate surgery so a
[1:06:38] bunch of Believers got together and they
[1:06:41] put on the message uh um a message from
[1:06:46] 1961 faith
[1:06:49] and they all anointed him with oil
[1:06:52] and
[1:06:53] after the tape they listened to the tape
[1:06:56] they anointed him with oil they prayed
[1:06:58] over him he was healed and it was a
[1:07:00] wonderful testimony praise God
[1:07:03] of course God can do that
[1:07:06] why can't God do that
[1:07:09] God honored their faith God showed that
[1:07:12] he was present because he meets Faith he
[1:07:16] gives Revelation to the individuals if
[1:07:19] he wants to heal that person he gives
[1:07:21] them a revelation of their healing and
[1:07:23] they're healed yeah
[1:07:25] did it have to come through the tapes
[1:07:28] absolutely not
[1:07:30] because it's God
[1:07:32] God could do it through the tapes is the
[1:07:36] tape Ministry fine sure it's fine if
[1:07:39] that's what they want to do but if
[1:07:41] somebody raises up in that Ministry that
[1:07:43] gets the anointing on them to preach the
[1:07:46] word and to quote the pastor then
[1:07:48] there's absolutely nothing wrong with
[1:07:51] that
[1:07:52] because that is the mystical body of
[1:07:54] Jesus Christ and we cannot put a
[1:07:58] boundary on that so that when so if
[1:08:00] somebody comes to me and says no brother
[1:08:02] no no you you don't need to be under and
[1:08:04] it's happened
[1:08:06] somebody has actually said that to me no
[1:08:08] no no you need to be listening to the
[1:08:10] tapes you should not be under a pastor
[1:08:12] I said what
[1:08:16] I said
[1:08:19] what are you gonna do
[1:08:21] you get to sit and argue with them I
[1:08:24] said well brother I you know I
[1:08:26] understand that that's your
[1:08:28] interpretation on it but I'm doing just
[1:08:30] fine
[1:08:32] because because God feeds me I listen to
[1:08:35] brother Branham every day every single
[1:08:39] day I listen to brother Branham and I
[1:08:42] feed on it and he speak and God speaks
[1:08:44] to me through those messages all the
[1:08:46] time
[1:08:48] but I go to church I got a I got a
[1:08:51] pastor I'm a part of the body of Christ
[1:08:54] I'm receiving perfect faith in my walk
[1:08:57] with God because I'm experiencing God in
[1:09:00] my personal walk in my day the day that
[1:09:03] I'm living in I don't need I I don't
[1:09:06] need other people's experiences I'm
[1:09:08] having my own
[1:09:10] I know God in the power of his
[1:09:12] resurrection and that's what's taken me
[1:09:14] in the rapture
[1:09:16] I don't got time to to argue with people
[1:09:19] and to spend time telling them well this
[1:09:21] is no brother you you know you're wrong
[1:09:24] you're this you're that not this that's
[1:09:25] not the hour for that
[1:09:27] we've gone way beyond that God doesn't
[1:09:29] want you to get caught up into those
[1:09:31] things
[1:09:32] if you want to have fellowship with them
[1:09:35] you want to share what's on your heart
[1:09:36] give them your testimony if the Holy
[1:09:39] Spirit wants to speak to them he's going
[1:09:41] to change them turn them around and and
[1:09:43] put them right on the right track it's
[1:09:45] not it doesn't mean that they're lost
[1:09:47] it just means that they're in a certain
[1:09:49] time and in season and condition in
[1:09:51] their lives and they need to progress
[1:09:53] because there's progressive revelation
[1:09:56] that will take you out of that kind of
[1:09:59] that kind of of confusion
[1:10:02] amen absolutely
[1:10:04] we can't stay in that kind of confusion
[1:10:07] we support the voice of God
[1:10:10] we support the tablets we support that
[1:10:14] work it's a it's a fantastic those
[1:10:16] tablets are fantastic
[1:10:18] I rejoice in them that are receiving
[1:10:21] them because God can speak to them and
[1:10:24] God can lead them and direct them and if
[1:10:25] that's where their faith is and that's
[1:10:28] all that they have need of in order to
[1:10:30] be raptured off this Earth
[1:10:32] I'm not telling God what to do
[1:10:35] you can't tell God what to do
[1:10:37] God has every single son and daughter of
[1:10:41] God chosen from before the foundations
[1:10:43] of the world you can't change any of it
[1:10:46] you can't do nothing to change any of it
[1:10:49] so all of a sudden now you've got to
[1:10:51] have only a certain way that that that
[1:10:53] that the message has to go out and no no
[1:10:58] we will not come under that kind of
[1:11:00] confusion but we need to understand it
[1:11:03] we need to understand why there is that
[1:11:06] these things are happening right around
[1:11:08] us
[1:11:09] but if we're walking with the Lord and
[1:11:11] we want to we want to be uh you know
[1:11:14] walking with confidence
[1:11:16] we want to know where we stand
[1:11:18] we need to know where we stand and that
[1:11:21] we are not going to be uh told how we
[1:11:25] are going to receive the word and how
[1:11:27] that we are going to receive the baptism
[1:11:29] of the Holy Ghost and how that we are
[1:11:32] going to no
[1:11:33] God is his own interpreter
[1:11:35] [Applause]
[1:11:37] amen
[1:11:41] in 1962 brother Branham says now this is
[1:11:44] the house that God dwells in not a
[1:11:47] building with a big Bell on top of it
[1:11:49] and a high steeple see but a body thou
[1:11:53] has prepared me a body that God can
[1:11:56] dwell in
[1:11:57] God can walk in God can see in God can
[1:12:03] talk in God can work in amen living
[1:12:07] instrumentally of God
[1:12:11] this is the hour that we are living in
[1:12:15] this is what we are feasting on this is
[1:12:18] the progressive revelation that is
[1:12:21] giving us the overcoming power and the
[1:12:24] ability to overcome amen hallelujah you
[1:12:28] can't put
[1:12:30] listen
[1:12:32] if you come into a situation where
[1:12:35] you're talking with somebody and they
[1:12:37] believe oh it's just take this ministry
[1:12:39] or whatever and they want to put you
[1:12:40] outside the circle don't worry just draw
[1:12:43] the circle a little bigger and say
[1:12:45] brother I'm going to make it bigger and
[1:12:47] I'm not drawing you outside because I
[1:12:48] believe that revelation will take you
[1:12:51] exactly where you need to go
[1:12:54] amen I'm gonna love you I'm gonna pray
[1:12:57] for you I'm gonna believe that God is
[1:12:59] able because this is the season of the
[1:13:02] Capstone Ministry Saints
[1:13:04] we are not living in the days of man
[1:13:07] where where it's it's all about the
[1:13:09] missionary and getting out there and and
[1:13:11] going into the it's it's being done God
[1:13:14] is doing it regardless God has his way
[1:13:17] of reaching and and we are a part of
[1:13:19] that we're doing it we're we're actively
[1:13:22] involved in those things amen praise God
[1:13:24] but this is the hour where God is
[1:13:27] becoming real to individuals amen praise
[1:13:30] God God is living in us hallelujah
[1:13:33] praise God forevermore
[1:13:36] so I'm not going to put anybody outside
[1:13:39] I don't want that kind of a spirit
[1:13:42] I don't want to have that kind of a
[1:13:44] spirit that's going to put people
[1:13:45] outside
[1:13:47] no
[1:13:49] we need to understand
[1:13:51] that God gives revelation
[1:13:54] God reveals in his time and season and
[1:13:57] he makes all things beautiful in his
[1:13:59] time and season amen praise God glory to
[1:14:03] God how can we limit God in any way he
[1:14:06] is the he is only obligated to his word
[1:14:10] and Revelation cometh by hearing the
[1:14:12] word not hearing with your physical ears
[1:14:15] because almost everyone can hear
[1:14:19] but it's a different thing when you can
[1:14:20] hear and recognize
[1:14:22] the ministry
[1:14:24] and the mysteries of God
[1:14:27] unto you it has been given to know the
[1:14:29] Mysteries
[1:14:30] can you see now how important it is
[1:14:34] to recognize that you have an attribute
[1:14:39] that you have a receiver
[1:14:41] it's the attribute that receives
[1:14:43] Revelation by the way
[1:14:45] did you know that
[1:14:47] it's the attribute that the Deep call to
[1:14:50] the deep that that that that that
[1:14:52] responds
[1:14:54] your conscious mind is only conscious
[1:14:58] of what's going on
[1:15:01] but it's the attribute
[1:15:04] that connects and receives the word
[1:15:07] and overcomes in you that's the greater
[1:15:10] that is in you
[1:15:12] he that is greater than he that is it's
[1:15:14] the attribute
[1:15:16] that's what's overcoming every sin every
[1:15:18] situation
[1:15:20] sin cannot stay on you
[1:15:23] sin cannot be imputed upon you
[1:15:26] blessed is the man whom God doesn't even
[1:15:29] impute iniquity that was a revelation
[1:15:31] that David received that that Revelation
[1:15:34] and realized oh my God
[1:15:37] nothing can separate nothing can
[1:15:41] separate us from the love of God
[1:15:43] yeah
[1:15:44] praise God forevermore
[1:15:48] so I looked up we're going to be closing
[1:15:51] here in a couple minutes so I looked up
[1:15:55] what it is
[1:15:57] a definition of progressive revelation
[1:15:59] and this is what I found
[1:16:01] progressive revelation is the doctrine
[1:16:03] in Christianity it's they call it a
[1:16:06] Doctrine
[1:16:08] because this is off the internet that
[1:16:10] the sections of the Bible that were
[1:16:12] written later
[1:16:15] contain a fuller revelation of God than
[1:16:19] the earlier sections
[1:16:21] there's a lot of Truth in that
[1:16:25] because there's revelation
[1:16:28] you're wondering how in the world is
[1:16:31] this body going to be changed
[1:16:33] how is it going to be
[1:16:35] you know
[1:16:36] changed from Mortal to immortal
[1:16:42] you know
[1:16:44] It's Supernatural you can't really quite
[1:16:47] put
[1:16:49] a mental scientific explanation on it
[1:16:56] but revelation
[1:16:58] changes everything
[1:17:01] Revelation makes all things possible all
[1:17:04] God has to do is change your body
[1:17:07] all you have to do is give you a
[1:17:09] revelation
[1:17:10] of the body change and in a moment
[1:17:12] that's why it's going to be in a moment
[1:17:14] in the twinkling of an eye
[1:17:16] because it's going to be a revelation
[1:17:18] that's going to instantly change your
[1:17:20] body
[1:17:21] you see what I'm saying so uh so they
[1:17:25] believe that God didn't tell people his
[1:17:28] entire plan all at once as they would
[1:17:30] not be able to handle it
[1:17:33] and that's why this Progressive walk
[1:17:37] with God and God had it this way that
[1:17:41] that
[1:17:42] the word
[1:17:44] when when we go back to Genesis right
[1:17:47] from the very beginning and look at even
[1:17:49] in the days when Jesus came on the earth
[1:17:51] and and what he was revealing and what
[1:17:54] he was doing and manifesting amongst the
[1:17:57] people and now here we've been
[1:18:00] progressing from the you know through
[1:18:02] the through the seven Church ages and
[1:18:04] and and come down all the way to this
[1:18:07] time and season we can see that that God
[1:18:10] has progressively been feeding you and I
[1:18:14] in this day and in this hour to take us
[1:18:18] fully through to the rapture
[1:18:23] it's a supernatural event
[1:18:27] glory to God Amen Let The Musicians come
[1:18:33] so without a receptor in you
[1:18:36] sorry
[1:18:39] you're not going to be changed
[1:18:42] it's as simple as that
[1:18:45] but can I tell you that you've got one
[1:18:47] or that you don't have one
[1:18:49] that's not up to me
[1:18:52] that's up to God
[1:18:55] had a plan
[1:18:57] it's called The Plan of Redemption
[1:19:00] all that the father hath given me Jesus
[1:19:02] said will come not one of them is going
[1:19:05] to be left behind
[1:19:07] every single son and daughter of God my
[1:19:11] sheep will hear my voice and it's not a
[1:19:14] literal voice but it is revelation that
[1:19:18] is constantly being given for us to
[1:19:21] overcome
[1:19:22] from day to day to day
[1:19:27] you know
[1:19:31] while brother branham's message
[1:19:34] was taking place
[1:19:36] and brother Branham was preaching
[1:19:39] and talking about
[1:19:41] the calling out of the Bride
[1:19:44] and
[1:19:45] you know talking about that that that uh
[1:19:49] this day this scripture is being
[1:19:51] fulfilled before their eyes
[1:19:53] talking about God meeting
[1:19:57] a type with Abraham and then lot and his
[1:20:02] wife and his children coming out of
[1:20:04] Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:20:05] all
[1:20:07] everything that he was saying the world
[1:20:10] the church world was hearing all of
[1:20:12] those things
[1:20:14] and yet
[1:20:15] there was still a Billy Graham on the
[1:20:17] Earth
[1:20:18] there was still an Oral Roberts on the
[1:20:20] Earth
[1:20:21] but yet God was showing in 1963 when he
[1:20:26] came down that time would be no more
[1:20:30] time would be no more
[1:20:33] for those types of churches
[1:20:37] but not for the bride
[1:20:40] actually we've got time like I said
[1:20:41] we're going to be coming in here for
[1:20:43] another Thousand Years
[1:20:46] and we're going to be in that element of
[1:20:48] time but we'll be in Supernatural bodies
[1:20:51] but the whole thought here is that
[1:20:53] everything is going on around us
[1:20:56] things are still happening around us
[1:21:00] but the word is taking
[1:21:05] the church out of the world
[1:21:10] supernaturally taking one here taking
[1:21:12] one there everything is still going on
[1:21:15] time shall be no more
[1:21:18] we're living in a in a time and in a
