be seated we thank god for you amen i'm glad that you you all made it back i praise god a little earlier it's really windy tonight isn't that right really windy and rainy so i'm thankful to those of you who are here i thought i'd be here preaching to maybe the people on the band you know brother danny and a couple of others and uh but thank god for you that are here amen and that's the whole thing people don't understand the church is going through a process of the shakedown now god says i shake the heavens i'm going to shake the earth and you know the farmer collects the grain he puts it in the in the thing and then he shakes it so that it could come down and level to where he wants it to level and that's going on in the church now and uh sometimes you're surprised that some people get shaken or they're shaking out but we just surrender to god's will praise god but i'm happy that i can be here in the house of the lord and as someone was saying here tonight it's a greater battle in this hour that we are in we are fighting more devils than we ever fought before all around us we are surrounded by chaos a corruption we are surrounded by every devil you can describe that satan the pits of hell are open and the devil is flying around everywhere let me tell you i i'm saying that because i i can feel the increase of his evil suggestions to my mind it's more than it was before and they're coming to your mind because there's a lot more things out there for you to see and hear that never existed before but they're there now and you can't avoid them and he's trying to pull you into his system of living and his way of living and you just gotta watch yourself ask god for grace we know the elect is gonna make it through but that doesn't mean as i've always said that we lay down and die or we lay down like dead logs and and float on the on down the stream of time and say well god is gonna take care of me my you're gonna bump into a whole lot of things on the edges of the river before you get down and you may even hit some rapids but the thing is we've got to do our best right don't don't try to be somebody else just be yourself be yourself be your best self that's all you can do right praise god and i'll tell you right now even when i make mistakes or anything you know but of course i go to the lord and say lord i'm sorry shouldn't have said that i shouldn't have done that but the point is uh even in your flawed state even in your condition that because none of us here is thinking that we are perfect let me get that straight first well we all know that uh even though that nobody else outside of this vessel right will know it you in your soul and in your spirit on the inside talking to yourself you know it and uh once you know it that's what god wants as long as you know it and he knows it that that's good but the point is that you can come to him and said lord this is all i have to offer this is the vessel that you you place here with a purpose with a plan and eve even even my mistakes or your mistakes it's all in god's mind already you can't make a move you can't do anything you can't spit on the ground without him knowing you can't do nothing without him knowing so don't worry about anything just go about your life go about your business praise god uh when this message began to break and i began to understand more and more the concept of the liberty that is in christ oh my goodness friends no more works praise god like for instance here tonight you're not here tonight because of obligation at this point on stage in the message you're not here because of conduct an order and doctrine even though it's the truth but you are here because something within your own heart has moved you uh and caused you to want or desire to be here in the house of god praise the lord because it's all right we can turn this into an internet service uh you know it's easy we can go online and make it an internet service praise the lord and that'll be nice you can be in your home and on a cold night like this you'll not have a hot chocolate and no but i'm telling you the truth you mightn't say that but that's what you would do praise god they got chocolate and you sit there in the comfort to your home the warped you know of your home and you watch the sermon praise the lord and that's fine but there's has to be a reason why god said forsake not the assembling of yourselves together as the manner of years because this age was coming these challenges were coming all these things god already knew it and fellowship doesn't come from people uh talking at a long table like this building and i'm at one end and you're in the other end uh that's not really fellowship but god is saying you have to come together and the word assemble yourselves together right which means you got to come uh in close contact with each other talk with one another and have a great time in the presence of the lord hallelujah of course he's talking about you copying what he would do or what he has done with his people right so that's all we do is come together and you'll find when you come together with like saints of like precious faith revelation and you begin to talk the word of god uh the great magnet begins to come down and before you know it you you break into eternity you start lose sense of time you you start losing sense of time right it's not just talk it's actual fact you lose the sense of time and for oh my goodness you mean uh two hours gone yeah but that's the way it is now friends and uh i thank the lord for it but i know that the um whole thing like any person that's cooking knows that the the meal or the the food that you're cooking doesn't remain heaped up in the pan like that with the heat and the pressures and everything else it starts going down it starts going down is that right praise the lord hallelujah well tonight you know we spoken a lot of people wanting to diagnose themselves and the problems that they have physically is that right and then you have a lot of pseudo doctors with the electric oil sales men and women that will come and advise you to drink this or drink that or drink the other eat this eat that or rub yourself with such-and-such or you better know who you're taking your advice from you better know you know because it's very important because this is one fellow i'm just talking with you there's one fellow i know he he was he went into the jungle several times uh prospecting for gold and he he was successful a couple of times and so he took his younger brother with him this next time and a younger brother happened to be a member of the church in guyana south america and so he took him with him and as they were going through the jungle um you know it's very hot in under the canopy of those trees it's not cool because the leaves literally come together and block out the sun and it's dark on them there there almost as night except when you come to a spot where some sunlight might come true and so it's hot and you're perspiring and walking and trekking and he got hot oh my goodness i'm thirsty and we run out of water where are we going to get water from this brothers he said i know you have never come through the jungle before but let me show you something you need to have some of this and he just walked to a vine took his knife cut it immediately water was in that vine and the brothers stand back because you've never seen it before you drink you go ahead any drink you know track is filled because you know the vines on the trees catch the the rain when it falls then allowing it to come down to the rest of the plants they catch it and store it up there and everything else so it collects in some of these vines and he knew which one to cut and he drank from it however you got to be careful if it's caught in the vine and it's fresh and you drink it it's no problem but if it's been in the vine for a couple of days or weeks he drank it he was running to the bathroom as often as you can think so you see you got to be careful whose advice you take and who you listen to and don't just have some self-diagnosis or diagnosis from somebody that's not a real doctor but a pseudo scientist like that right and uh once you have uh come to the place that that's it i'm not worried about all these self-diagnosis i need to have a real doctor well this is we spoke on the next topic of god's diagnosis because you may have your point of view but what is god's point of view you may have your idea but what's god's thoughts about it uh so god we spoke about that and god gave his thoughts about this as we spoke uh last week praise god and now we are here to talk about the final counsel of the ages because we are coming down to the ending of the gentile dispensation we're coming to the ending of uh my friends the close of these church ages we're coming to the end of the even western civilization it's going back east the sun is going back to the jews and it's leaving the gentiles to return back to the jews we must be aware of that and we prepared for it so now we are here receiving or to receive god's advice god's counsel and our scripture tonight is found in revelation chapter 3 verses 18 to 19. i counseled thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes off that thou may see as many as i love i rebuke and chase him be zealous therefore and repent amen father we just ask for you to stop a while and visit with us and just talk with us as we come together like this and to thee be all the glory father may the holy spirit of the living god witness to us and warm our hearts by the fires of the word to your glory and praise and honor in jesus name amen the scripture gets right to the point look you can be seated please be seated god says i counseled thee i counseled thee uh now um you know what what is it to counsel is to advice right if you're gonna counsel somebody it means you're gonna advise and god says i counseled thee the body of me uh more formally when you use the word counsel you're really speaking about the lawyer right you're talking about a lawyer usually in the courts they will say the judge will even say counselor counselor right so because he's an advocate right he's an advocate that is rise the titles of jesus christ would you'll find uh titles like that are advocate our consular i think it's isaiah 9 somewhere in there 9 6 where he says his name shall be called wonderful consular amen remember are greater than solomon is here and solomon's wisdom could not compare with him and his name shall be called counselor amen and now this great counselor is telling the people come to me for your counsel get your advice from me don't go off somewhere else looking for advice because there is no one wiser there is no one that has more wisdom matter of fact in the book of isaiah he says all your kings and your counselors together if you were put to put them in a bucket he said they are just like a drop of water in a bucket to me they are nothing their wisdom can't compare him with his wisdom for he is the mighty counselor amen praise god hallelujah so he directs the church to himself he's saying your only hope to get out of this dilemma that you're in this religious dilemma is to come to me for counsel so you can get out of this dilemma right i am in other words i am your only hope there's no one wiser there's no other specialist no other doctor nobody else that can get you out of this dilemma that you are in and therefore your hope is in me amen praise god so he says come to me and by come to me and by praise god god calling them pointing them to himself hallelujah but sad to say we are witnesses to it because we are living now in this laodicean church age and the the nominal church is not coming to him to buy uh oil or buy gold or buy precious the precious things of spiritual life you're not coming to him to buy by uh they're not coming to him for the real as i quote from the church age book they're not coming to buy god's spiritual products but they're going off somewhere else to buy their spiritual products now i won't get into all of this but you can write down uh if you want to or it's going on a tape anyway uh king a has in second kings chapter one he went for counsel up to some false god by the name of beelzebub and elijah met him and he's coming back and said how dare you you go up to seek after blc bob when we have jehovah the true and the living god that you can go to and ask for help amen why do you think i'm here amen because he already knows and i've come here and he delivered the prophecy from the presence of almighty god amen you'll find in jeremiah 46 11 and 12 2nd chronicles amen 16 12 jeremiah 8 22. those are some scriptures you can follow up to show you how uh through the ages right on down to the time of jesus that these spirits religious spirits were rejecting god's uh uh diagnosis his advice and the answer to it and they would not come to him for cancer they would not comfort him to to him for healing but they will search every other place no wonder the one prophet said is there no bomb in gilead is there no healing in gilead you know but thank god we know that there is a great physician we know his name is jesus christ we know he is the mighty counselor amen the mighty god and the everlasting father to him they should have come to get their answers amen praise god hallelujah so he directs them to himself the word that's where he goes to the church right instead of them running to this theologian searching out this wise man of many years ago that was studying the bible and wrote a big thick volume or whatever that's good but you're going to study that when now is the edge when you can come directly to him there by faith and he can give you the answers that you seek amen so he directs them come on to me and buy of me gold and me he's talking about is himself the word so you come to the word hallelujah praise god now we find the church is in a situation where instead of their actions their motives and desires being spiritual now their motives and desires becomes transactional everything they do has to have like a transaction a form of business you've got to transact something amen praise god and in doing so they even think they're spiritual they think they're being as they the word wise is cast around all the time but that's not the real wisdom of god that's not the real wisdom that god wants you to have praise god amen amen hallelujah i tell you god says god in you willing and doing of his own good pleasure philippians 2 13 hallelujah praise god but quoting the prophet he says but you know god is not in them for as long as they are of denominational seed and spirit not the seed of god and the spirit of god then they god is not with them amen by of me gold tried in the fire that you may be rich praise god brother could you take down that clock correct the timing if it's not is it right it's correct okay just want to be sure that's not the hour ahead it just it just suddenly struck me how hour behind i mean praise the lord hallelujah praise the lord anyway praise god now these people had a lot of gold and you know the church has a lot of gold but my fact they own most of the gold of the world already is the rest of the world don't yet know it what we are seeing with this war in ukraine i kind of jump there but you'll understand why is because the world is in a fluxes ready to change from the iron curtain to the purple curtain because as the prophet tells and the prophecies of the bible tells you that the great dragon and the bear has to come together which is china and russia and the bible tells us they have to come down to israel to take the oil that is up there and the rest of it is not going to happen of course it's not going to happen during our time but prophecy tells us what is fixing to happen so the groundwork for all these prophecies being fulfilled it's been set in order right now so out of conflict and chaos and death and everything else god is literally creating the atmosphere to fulfill his word prophet said watch russia king of the north he says oh watch russia king of the north but he says no it's not fascism not nazism it's not going to be the bamboo curtain it's not going to be the iron curtain but watch that purple curtain when it comes in amen that's the one you ought to keep your eyes on praise god they say oh why should i watch a church something a lamb spirit but speaking like a dragon right because it presents the harmlessness to the the people who i have eyes but see not it appears harmless so timid so nice and so controlled like like a lamb but what it's teaching and speaking is like a dragon right so there we see it friends that this actually has most of the gold in the world and this trial or test we see going forward to see how control over gold and money in this world can control everything else of course except the true seed of god but it controls everything else right they just put russia in a corner there box them in and uh there'll be even more sanctions on them and then we'll see where they're at but that is just a display because now mr babylon can see once they have the majority control over that goal they know they got the whole thing in the grasp like that [Music] because then they just pull back their gold and say go ahead do whatever you want but but you're not going to have any of this what are you going to do and then they give orders to the other people and says you buy from them and we pull it back from you too and nobody is going to want to do anything else you see what's coming you have an idea of what's taking place so these people have plenty of gold one of the employees actually in the vatican while i was there we got kind of chummy because um i'd gone through the vatican quite a few times and the rest of them were walking around and i was kind of tired so i just stood there and you know i just talked i like talking talking to people so i started talking to him and we're talking to him and said wow this is marvelous my goodness it must be a lot of um funds coming in for the holy church you know this and that well he automatically thinks i'm a catholic too he says oh yeah uh the at least every every day is over 96 or 100 000 that comes in you know that um from just buying the trinkets and stuff like that that has nothing to do with the masses and this and that and that the other like that so the gold is pouring in non-stop it's pouring in day and night then i go down further and there was a lot of these bosses right uh and uh you know all ritually dressed but you can tell these these men got all kinds of money and they were there and they were giving to the priests huge amounts right praise god but in any case gold is in the church like you will not believe it everywhere but the wrong kind of gold they don't have the right kind of gold because the goal that he is talking about is the gold of your character you can have all the gold outside and you don't have the gold of his character or you don't have a piece of him on the inside my friends that gold is worthless it's worth something in this world but you understand when this body is all decayed and taken up by worms and you are no more what is it usually a gold with you i agree with the lady whose husband say when i'm going you're not getting any of my money put it all inside there with me and bury it with me and so they're burying him and she and her son is there crying and everything else your father is all gone and stuff like that you know and son said yes did you bury the money yes she said i bury all that he owns with him i wrote him a check and they buried it with him right oh yeah so she buried him with all this money and there they are they are trafficking and doing transactional things with the gold that is not of god they are buying men's souls they are buying men's lives literally i seen how they will take money and give to people or give them loans and everything else just to obligate them to the church or relate them to themselves amen and those people feel obligated because of all that money right so that is what they're doing and causing the goal to warp uh men's personalities and character and and twist their minds to start thinking they what way they want them to think but the scripture tells us the love of money is the root of all evil right the love of money not money itself that's an in animate object right so the love of money is the root of all evil amen revelation 18 1 to 14. i won't read that you can read it but parts of it says is babylon the greatest fallen has fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every found spirit in the church amen right praise god because satan has nowhere this is his last hand right right he has to come in the church to oppose the word right in the church he knows the denominations are under his power you don't have to worry about them you don't have to worry about nobody else but he has to come in the churches or church or groups that have really received the word of god for this day and for this hour and for that he has to bring his forces right here and to attack the minds and the lines of god's people but thank god that we have with us the overcomer thank god we have jesus christ amen she has become the hold of every foul spirit and the cage of every uh unclean and hateful bird kings of the earth have committed fornication with her merchants of the earth are wax rich true abundance of our delicacies and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of our plagues and that you receive not of her plagues amen praise god i want to thank god for the scripture because way back since i'm a young man come out of her mind people and the spirit of god says see as wicked as they are as rotten as foul as evil as it is i have some people in there and you need to call them out amen praise god call them out because i have them in there why would i say come out if there wasn't people in so he says call them out amen praise god hallelujah and i thank god there's one sitting over there praise god is the one sitting over there and there's others here praise god called out by the grace of god hallelujah uh brother sister when you think of it you know in the initial sense you look and say oh my god has to use a vessel i come in that service and brother simon was preaching but it wasn't brother simon really that talked to you that supernatural thing that you come in contact with was the holy spirit even i who was preaching at the time i knew that the holy spirit was sending out the message but i didn't know the extent of what the holy spirit was doing praise god but i give him glory and praise amen praise god you see they were they're giving people gold to buy their loyalty right by their loyalty this is what brother branham was talking about oh when you were in trouble and you didn't have any food in your house who came to your house with a basket with good things the kind old priest says when your mother was dead you didn't have money to bury her whatever from the society burial society who came to help you your kind old priest well after all these various acts the prophet mentioned do you think that person you can ever get that person to actually leave that church because they obligated them they use their wealth to create a false loyalty not based on the word of god amen you see oh that's what they do and it's coming because now how you gonna like brother branham said what are you gonna say to them about that kind of priest you're gonna go and tell them the priest is the devil and when you do that it it'll backfire and make you look like the devil a good old man like that that lived his whole life for the priesthood and gave this and helped my mother like that you see it turns the other way so it's a very cunning and deceitful plot that the devil has put forth there praise god oh i'm gonna jump over that that the rest of that scripture because you have read it and i know you can read it again hallelujah god says come out of her my people hallelujah praise god remember when this is said at that time and i see i have a mark here remember this is the happen the rapture has not yet taken place that's why i'm telling you that is now that is us here right now come out of her my people right you see i was so vigorous about it at times and i went around about doing it brother peter and those brothers were going to those catholic churches and putting there i had written the track um the track about mary and whatnot and and they were giving out that and going and waiting for the catholic church to be over and giving giving the people until the priest had to go to the police and make reports to the city you know because they're on fire with god and got to come out call them out wherever they are everything else like that you know praise god now of course god used that but that was a wrong approach going uh uh you know on their property and going to their front door and sticking it even when they didn't have church we would take sister charlotte and all those things and stick it on the on the you know on the handle of the church there so that when they come to open it it will be there and stuff like that it was adventurous but it was not the right thing to do god would call out his own people by his own grace amen hallelujah that's all the church today has the worldly gold gold that will melt and perish amen it'll melt and perish away uh you know i like to tell these little stories as they come to me this one is this man that went into the uh us desert with a partner and the two of them went there looking for gold they finally found a lot of gold and uh they went to bed that night and he was thinking that you know it'll be better if i take off with this set of gold and you know the gold that we have here and i'll be rich for the rest of my life and so he ups and he kills his partner and he grabs the water container puts it on his annual and takes all the gold and heading across the desert back to civilization and of course the sun is hot hot hot and when he gets to the point where he's really thirsty he takes the bottle and he does and instead of water he had picked up the bottle full of wine and you know you can't you can't uh substitute water for wine and the wine is going to get you thirstier and you have nothing else to drink the story is he died what could he do he couldn't get the gold out he died of thirst trying to get the gold out and that's what's a lot of people they want to hang on to this world's gold and they don't care about god and the word of god and all that sort of stuff and they won't quench their thirst that they the ever-present what is from the rock of the living god amen hallelujah and the church today is putting the emphasis on uh wealth and affluence uh being the standard of whether you're spiritual or not whether you're blessed or not amen it's how much gold you have show us how blessed you are if that's the case jesus i don't know you know didn't own anything not even a pillow to put his head have to put his head on rocks and everything else and yet he owned the whole world but now they have that as the standard that if you want to be successful uh uh you you've got to be affluent you've got to be rich you've got to be this nothing is wrong with being rich with being affluent with god blessing you in every possible way but they are placing that now as the evidence of god's blessing just as much as they misplace the whole thing with the evidence of the holy spirit they're just placing it here with the evidence of what it is to have god's blessing amen yes sir what's clearly praise god and the correctness of the doctrine of that certain certain church is based on how many rich people are within that church tells you how correct the doctrine is these are sensible people you can't just preach just anything and they're going to believe it and if all they are smarter than me all of them got companies making money and they're going to that church if i get in the midst of that don't you see somehow god will give me wisdom or an idea will come from one of them and i also will go upwards and gravitate and and get rich also that's that's the thinking and they know that when they create that atmosphere that is what they're going to have but god says buy of me gold but the gold that is tried in the fire gold tried in the fire amen and then you will truly be rich that's when you're really going to be rich when you have the gold that is tried in the fire praise god hallelujah brother branham said at this point are we getting it are we really getting it listen to me friends naked we come into the world and naked spiritually we will not leave it amen no we are going to take something with us hallelujah you're going to take something with you right i can't take your money with you you can't take the other uh guy that loved to play the piano i forgot whatever his name is said man i love the piano when i when i'm going i'm taking my piano with me bury me with my piano but you can't take it with you your bones are going to rotten there everything else yeah they surround you with all your millions of dollars it will all perish it doesn't matter it'll go with you amen but there's one thing you can take with you praise god hallelujah and that's your character amen your character will always be there with you and you can't leave that behind hallelujah right before god the prophet says we will take our character that is what we will take with us what kind of character will you will you take with you will it be his will it be his amen that's what we want that's what we want to always have and that is the knowledge that is keeping us here today and nothing in this present world with all the storms of life that are coming with all the chaos with all the look you see the increase in propaganda you you understand the uh the assault of lies and lying becoming normalized and commonplace with even ordinary people until they think just everybody lies it's just a normal thing and life look you got to have the holy spirit keeping your mind straight and it's by being in the word that it keeps your mind straight he'll do everything to tempt you bring something close to all you got to do is say yes when you know it's no more my god help us what an hour that we're living in all you leodycian people you're so soft and character-less oh it's up to each one of us in that day every man will bear his own burden now this city of ledicia of course you know was a city that had a lot of wealth a lot of gold in it and it flourished and they had a two-headed coin that was very much desired by everybody two-sided coin uh that was desired by every body and we have that same thing with the church today because the church um as i've called it many years ago and still call it uh we have entered into a phase of stock market religion where um you buy yourself in or pay yourself or pay for your entrance into the church and the richer you are is easier and faster you can pay yourself into the church uh like that and um and then you are you're allowed to buy yourself out of sin you're allowed to so we have a stock market religion you buy in right and then you can sell out quick right like that right the prophet says we can now buy ourselves out of sin and try to also encourage by them by yourself into heaven see but god doesn't say that the churches own such phenomenal wealth and at any given time she can take over the entire world system she can take over the entire system of commerce she can be the leader and will be the leader of the world council of churches amen and we know that the leader of the world consular churches has openly prophesied in public that the church in the foreseeable future what she could do and what she will do and the golden tower of babel will fall and only the gold tried in the fire shall endure amongst them amen i'm going to stop in a few minutes here but just let me finish commenting on this next paragraph what has the church constantly done through the ages prophet said what has the church done she has done what she has always done from eve right on down always she left the word and go off on her own she just left the word see and see and taken her own creeds our own ideas her own darkness and joined herself to the world and that's what the church has done through the ages absolutely see and god is saying now that you are found naked and now i'm going to judge your lewdness amen and the only way for you to escape this dreadful situation is to come back to the word of god amen come out of her my people and be not partakers of her plagues praise god friends you uh i i i stop here now but you realize what's going on uh i don't know this is not here in this text or anything else we're coming down the doors shutting you understand the thing is almost shut all the prophet said you're looking for now is one if you find that one last elect and when whoever does it in any part of the world when that happens and that last one comes in the whole thing goes up you're insane while we're still here we know the last one hasn't come in yet because when that one comes in he said you have to know when they come in right but when that last one comes in the whole thing goes up praise god so when you see what is happening in the church in the world all the events all the things put them together you realize the door is slowly closing amen and that is why you hear a lot of brothers are already preaching redemption is over nobody else can come in but not my bible didn't tell me that and uh the events and the prophecies of the prophet didn't actually tell us that he just talked about the door being shut amen at a certain time the door being shut and you talked and of course there's a lot of quotes that they use about uh noah preaching in the art door right but the door was behind noah and it was still open that's why he was preaching right it's when he went in the bible says and then god shut the door and when the rapture goes out takes us out of here then god shuts the door but while we are still here let's work till jesus comes while we're still here let's preach the word till jesus comes while we are still here let's carry the message as far as we can and the best we can amen look when this rapture comes if somebody heard the message from you and they haven't ripened to the point to recognize they are one elected seed or they're in a remnant leave that alone god will deal with the rest of the grain that isn't fully ripe yet right you just go into the bonds and let the grace of god take hold of your life but pray for them pray that god will lead you to some of his elect or his grain pray that god will use you in every possible way as the prophet said remember with the wise and the foolish virgins some were wise say some were foolish but all of them were virgins the woman that cut the pattern he says the plot over here in the squad is the same thought you just happen to be elected to be within the confines of that pattern and that is why we got to give glory and grace to god why am i in and he is out why why am i in and she is out why is she in and this one is out that's the grace and mercy of the love of god god rich in mercy is why we are here tonight giving praise and all because you look at yourself sometimes praise god and you say no good thing dwells in me amen only the grace of god can take us through friends so rest on his love his mercy and his grace while the musician comes rest on that praise the lord and let's pray one for the other don't look back all the days we had um wonderful sweet days when we would gather in our homes and fellowship together break bread together eat together playing the guitar singing and talking and talking around the world and everything else those days are not coming back it's gone to another phase now and god helping us um if you'll allow me then i'll talk we'll talk about that on sunday by the grace of god may god bless every one of you praise the lord everyone another generation is coming and we got to prepare them right we got to do that by god's grace brother brother bill uh you know i thought about it even while i'm preaching i'm saying praise god god bless this brother all the way was but your tongue again from welland in this rain and wind and everything else don't you think it was easy for him to just get a hot toddy and but he's here tonight and that is really an example for every single one of us praise god god bless you god bless every one of you we'll go to your homes now and may god keep you and we'll see each other again uh this sunday here in the house of god and let's give him praise on your glory pray for me i'll be praying for you and you pray for me praise god i feel god's grace and transforming power moving within me and moving within the church unto him
