[5:24] about how you know we came from eternity
[5:26] and you know that we can't sin and and

[5:31] just excites my soul and Revelation just
[5:33] starts breaking forth and it's just so
[5:36] exciting amen I I just don't know how
[5:40] you can
[5:41] get bored or tired in any way shape or

[5:50] know if you get bored here then there's
[5:53] no way you can go there amen it's just
[5:55] that simple because Revelation is
[5:57] eternal you're just going to be
[5:58] rejoicing Paul says eyes have not seen
