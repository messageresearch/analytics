TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] with joy we draw waters from the well of salvation i'm very happy to be here december 31st the ending of our year 2020 and we are on the brink of our entry into the new year 2021 may god richly bless you and keep you as we approach the word of god at this hour and time we would like to take our scripture from matthew chapter 2 reading from verses 1 to 12. in particular i would like to take verse 12. we find here now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judea in the days of herod the king behold there came wise men from the east to jerusalem saying where is he that is born king of the jews for we have seen a star in the east and are come to worship him when herod the king had heard these things he was troubled and all jerusalem with him but when he had gathered the chief priests and scribes and of the people together and he demanded of them where christ should be born and they said unto him in bethlehem of judea for thus it is written by the prophet and thou bettly him in the land of judah are not the least among the princes of judah for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people of israel when herod then herod when he had privileged called the wise men inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared and he sent them to bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when we have found him bring me word again that i may come and worship him also and when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the east went before them and till it came and stood over where the young child was when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy and when they were come into the house they saw the young child with mary his mother and fell down and worshipped him and when they had opened their treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh and being warned of god in a dream that they should not return to herod they departed into their own country another way praise be to god for the reading of his word let us pray a gracious father we thank you so much for the written word that you have given us a record of things that have taken place from which we can draw insights uh wisdom revelation from this through your great holy spirit we pray you'll help us today bless us today father as this year of 2020 it's now winding down we thank you for the wonderful songs and testimonies the great efforts of the saints of god oh lord the various victory victories the praises and honor and glory that was given to your name just before i brought this message father and i'm asking you to bless everyone all of them that participated that give their hearts their lives their talents their all to give glory and honor and praise to you lord bless us here now we pray in the name of our lord jesus christ we ask it amen and amen praise the lord praise god brother branham speaking from who do you say this is he says we are living in a marvelous time the the greatest of all the ages we're living to win time can cease and eternity can blend right in with it and go on the ages of all the prophets and the sages look forward to we ought to be every hour on our guard watching for his coming oh we are in a critical hour the world is but the real church not the denomination is ready for the greatest triumph it has ever made the coming of the groom to the bride oh what a day one an hour is now wonderful the coming of the groom to the bride at this time not four but two praise the lord he is here too and when that talk coming to her as a revelation changes and goes into a rapturing condition then they go out of here but praise be the god that i'd like to speak on the subject of the wisdom of the wise men for if they were called wise men by god himself in the bible then they must be wise and first of all we understand that these wise men were indeed wise for under the inspiration of a balaam the prophet his message that out of jacob would rise a great star amen out of jacob out of him will rise the star that will come up that will be a governor and a ruler over god's people israel they got a revelation from him and so they were watching for a star they were waiting for the appearance of a star for the star to appear and when that great star did appear as you know these wise men were astronomers they were astronomers maybe also astrologers because in those days back then before the torah was even written god's first bible was in the skies using the moon stars and sun as signs to show times and seasons and and so on so the patriots of of their day actually read god's bible in the sky now we know that god has moved on from that torah came along and then the fullness of the word where jesus came on the scene and it was written of him and then god revealed to paul the rest of the new testament of which now we have bought both old and new testament but these men at that time watch for the stars in the sky and when they saw it thank god they recognized it you see you see what you're looking for oh my praise god they recognize the star because they were watching for it thank god and they followed the star from their different countries from which they came their different nations from which they came uh today we'll say well you know they came out of different nations i believe india hindustan you know and persia what other country i don't know whether it's turkey or wherever but the three wise men traveled following the star from their different nations and we are here today by the grace of almighty god because we have come out from our various dynamic nations led by god's star of the hour and we have recognized god's star and we have followed god's star amen hallelujah and as far as i know and believe and have received and witnessed in my heart life and ministry that he has led us to the perfect light now we know that these three wise men represented the three sons of noah shem ham and japheth and so is speaking about the entire human race being under the influence of this great marvelous star hallelujah now as you know we have just had the conjunction of two stars coming together jupiter and saturn and forming one shining star within the night sky after hundreds of years this star has appeared two stars but in the day of jesus when the wise men followed that star we understand from historical writing records we understand that it's act in fact it was three stars and these three stars merged moved and they came into a conjunction they came into a union and when they were close together from the earth looking to them or at them there were seen as one great bright star within the sky glory to god hallelujah amen possibly jupiter saturn and venus that's possibly that's the names of those uh individual stars at that time now we understand that stars actually represent times according to god saying in genesis he puts them there for the signs and for seasons and also stars represents of course parts of the zodiac represents the spirits of men that are on the earth here so as these three stars moved in the heavens these three wise men from different nations in our davidson in different denominations were traveling towards the truth searching to find the fullness of the word of god's truth and as they were traveling individually on the earth and moving in the heavens above the stars were moving also moving into a union and a conjunction until they came into a state of oneness to shine forth the light of god blessed be his holy name and so praise god those three men even though they never knew each other their paths crossed at bethlehem's gate where the star came together as one and thank god looking at god's seventh church age star messenger that he sent up on this earth following that ministry it has led us to the gate of the lamb of god bethlehem's gate praise be to god hallelujah and we have come together to do what to see the birth of the newborn word all glory to god hallelujah is led us to the new born word of god for this hour now back in the days of jesus when the three stars appeared three being the number of of perfection it spoke about the headship the coming of the head of the body of christ and he jesus is the head of the body amen and so it spoke about the headship praise the lord and he came as what the son of man for now god was in flesh appearing god had condescended and was in the flesh appearing upon your earth praise god in our day two stars have appeared two stars hallelujah representing my friends not the coming so much of the headship but the coming of the body the coming of the head to the body a uniting time a supernatural natural conjunction typing and speaking of a spiritual supernatural conjunction of the head christ coming to his body which is his bride his wife amen hallelujah and praise god we find it here friends the presence of his body here on the earth united together by the opening of the word of god hallelujah fulfilling this this scripture of luke 17 that in the days of sodom how that day son of man that would be revealed again but now we know he is being revealed again but not in the form of the head he is now being revealed or is revealing himself to us in the bride form or in the form of a bride or as the manifested word of god for the age the word and flesh appearing god making himself manifested to this day this age and this hour oh my oh a great hour of the manifestation of the children of god the great liberty of the children of god which we enjoy at this time the liberty the freedom oh praise god deliverance from our past deliverance from bondage deliverance from fear and doubt deliverance from maybe so and presumptions into a state of being satan of god knowing who we are where we come from and where we are going for his glory praise god hallelujah and as the wise men of old the bible says they came to worship him they came to bring glory and honor to his name and to exalt his name and to say come let us adore him christ the lord and we are here today to worship him and to adore him and magnify him and the bible said the rejoice with exceeding great joy when they saw that star and it came and hung over where the young child was i'm telling you today we ought to rejoice we have to give god glory we ought to give him praise we ought to give him honor we ought to magnify him that he gave us eyes to see ears to hear and to our hearts to believe and to glorify his wonderful and marvelous name oh glory to god hallelujah amen thank god that they came to worship him as their savior amen as the true light amen praise god and worship him as their lord and we are here in our day after looking at the twinkling star amen of this message that led us to the perfect understanding and revelation of our day seeing being led not by a star in the heavens but led by a seventh star church age messenger amen spoken of in revelation chapter 3 revelation chapter 10 verse 7 led by that twinkling shining wondrous star of god the light of revelation emanating from his message and from his ministry has led us right now my friends to the perfect light of god for this hour thanks be to god and some will say brother simon what you are saying i don't see it i don't understand it i don't know what you're talking about but it's just like it was back then the wise men saw the star but many others didn't or could not see the stars my god they didn't see it and now we have people in our day that do not see the star don't recognize the star don't understand the message the ministry of that star and what sign what does it mean who is this they do not understand who this is but god by his holy spirit has blessed us and revealed to us and caused us to know who this is and we give god the glory and the honor for it praise god hallelujah now you must realize herod and his wise men didn't see it or they would have had the answers for the wise men the rabbis the jewish rabbis who speak from childhood to manhood and into ancient man studying the scriptures day and night did not see that star in the skies they did not recognize what god was doing in this hour oh watchmen what of the night the morning cometh and what of the night oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah o praise god but the wise men they were able to see the star because that star was given specifically for them to see for unto you it's given to know the mystery of the kingdom but unto them it is not given god predis elected and predestinated those wise men of that day to recognize that star messenger leader and they followed the star and the star led them to jesus christ hallelujah even so in our day and in our time we were being chosen elected predestinated by god to be come to the word of this hour and to understand and follow by supernatural revelation right to the christ of god himself amen hallelujah glory to god notice that took their eyes off of that star for a brief period of time and when they took their eyes off of that star they were blinded for a brief while by the glare of man the glare of the glory of herod the glare of the glory of religious dignitaries they were distracted and temporarily misled by these religious popular dignitaries and religious leaders and this happened because they uh believed or thought to themselves that since these were learned leaders in the written scriptures of the day the written message of that day that they should know when this star or where the star has appeared and we know friends that they did not know they knew the scriptures they knew the scriptures said it that the star would rise from jesse they knew it would come around bethlehem ephrata they knew that from writing but by revelation they had no idea that the star had already appeared and the wise men were being already led by that star to the christ they knew the scriptures but they did not know him many in this message in this day and in this hour mighty men of god mighty leaders great dignitaries great man oh no god no his word nor the scriptures but i'm not conscious of god to be aware of the supernatural occurrence that has taken taking place and is taking place as the book is unfolding god revealing himself and interpreting himself in this day and in this hour and making himself known they know the courts they know the scriptures they know the word they'll they'll tack you to a wall with that but they have no idea they're skimming around close to it but they're not really into it not just by lining up quotes lining up scriptures comparing texts and stuff like that but coming under the inspiration of the mighty angel of revelation 10 1 coming under the power of the supernatural covenant of god the great holy spirit moving within the heart of the true believer and making himself known and interpreting his own word through them for his glory and for his honor oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah those men were so convinced as we are convinced that those of us would caught the genuine core heart ingredient of the last prophets message and pressed our way into the kingdom hallelujah holding to god's unchanging word and there we are those men were convinced even though they had never seen anything of this sort in their lifetimes or heard of any such a thing they followed the star according to the word of prophecy that was revealed and made known to them they followed the star and they did it regardless of circumstances over hill and over dale over deserts and over mountains over hunger thirst over the objections of their family friends wives husband the hell to the promised word of the day the message of the hour the message of malachi 4 5 turning not to the right nor to the left but keeping their eyes upon the star keeping their eyes upon the word of god looking away to jesus and following in the footsteps of their lord oh blessed be the name of the lord nor praise god imagine their friends must have come to them and said malkiar what madness are you caught up in what type not even the normal church not even the same sensible wonderful ministers message ministers that follow claim they're also watching for that star and following that star don't see what you're seeing they're not they don't have uh what you're talking about what what you're talking about and and so they made him into an oddball and they friends family would begin to question their integrity their understanding and their revelation oh my god hallelujah yes sir and these men maybe were known men maybe they were famous in their own lands and their own countries their own nations and among their own people men of fame maybe they were rich but they counted all it all down and ash that they might win the christ that they might find the perfect light the word of god for the day and for the hour hallelujah none of those things stop them and none of this should stop you none of it should give us a halting a hindering or a hesitation but to press into the kingdom of god but to press on and hold to god's unfolded word of god for the fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly purge his floor amen yes sir they gave up all to follow that star or praise god that's our story this is my story this is my song oh i'm following my savior all the day long oh praise god they gave up all to follow him wherever you are in this day in this hour at the ending of this year this time this season this age that we are in give up your all my friends and lay yourself at the feet of jesus and follow him and follow him and he will lead you into the perfect light praise god oh my why because they will convince it's thus saith the lord hallelujah balaam spoke it but yeah recognize not the man they recognized the voice that was speaking through him that that was god saying that that star would arise out of jesse out of jacob amen hallelujah oh brother sister thank god for esther at the time of purim hallelujah she said if i perish let me perish but i'm going to see the king why did they have why did she have this kind of dedication because revelation the book revelation chapter 4 not in the bible but the uh revelation series chapter four book three 31 after the wise men saw him in the heavens after the wise men saw his star in the heavens they became ministering spirits here upon the earth those are the words of the prophet of this hour when they saw the star recognized it saw what it meant understood by revelation what it meant and where it was leading and started to follow it oh praise god they became living testimonies they became ministering spirits here upon the earth my brother my sister in christ oh praise god for his wonderful name god has blessed us in this hour to open our eyes on our heirs to see and recognize what he has done and is doing through the life ministry and message of the great messenger he sent upon the earth and now that has transformed all of us into ministering spirits some of us preachers others prayers others givers others with a testimony others all praise god with different facets of the great diamond the brilliance and the supernal and superlative presence of god splendid uh presence of the living god flowing out of our lives shining the light of the gospel in this end time and in this hour to lead and bring men to attention of the word of god and to jesus christ they may say i don't see nothing about that message i don't believe william branham or what he said but just look around you look what it's accomplishing he's long gone and what's taking place now it's not about him it's what the god that set him is doing hallelujah elijah isn't here but he like ja elijah him and her hallelujah now the bride's ministry has begun in the power of god the fire the holy spirit flowing in abundance and rivers of power and rivers and streams and fountains of signs oneness miracles and opening of the word to bless the people and to bring them out of their spiritual conditions and bondage that they were in yes sir i fought perish let me perish i am persuaded that this is the saiyan the lord i am persuaded that he jesus christ is able to keep that which he i have committed unto him against that great jubilee rapture day oh glory to god hallelujah amen so i'm following jesus one step at a time i'm following him brother sister and giving glory to god hallelujah amen those wise men came to find the great king a great mighty general a deliverer just like when we came out of pentecost coming to this message the prophet's ministry looking for another great outpouring and a powerful uh end-time revival of that nature we were looking for that because that's what we've seen in the past not realizing that what god was going to give on his giving is in a different way to accomplish the same goals and more than that amen glorifying his people not just creating squirrels but translating and changing people from glory onto glory and placing them right into the rapture generation to come into the presence of the living god hallelujah amen they're getting all kinds of digital information we are getting supernatural revelation by god's broadcast through the holy spirit coming into the crystal the gene within your heart within your soul and inspiring you and filling you with the glory divine hallelujah amen yes sir hallelujah when those those great wise men they were so wise they followed the star but when they came contrary to what is being taught the myths that they're taught and the religious lies that are propagated those wise men never went to any manger they never found joseph and mary in the manger the bible tells us if you will read matthew 2 where i just read says they found the child and his mother in a house and he was not an infant and at this stage the message since 63 has come out of its infancy or praise god and is growing now standing on its own two feet but old and new testament it's walking for itself and beginning to talk for itself god is now in his bright form revealing his own word and interpreting his own word by his holy spirit for when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth and show you things to come blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah praise god amen when they found that child he was haunted by these other nations he was hated by the great dignitaries he was misunderstood by even the religious people of that day an hour and some were even questioning the circumstances surrounding his birth about an angel coming and speaking and saying things like that they were questioning the circumstances of his birth hallelujah thank god years have passed since this message has struck the earth and it's come to this stage now hallelujah where the revealed word of the hour is no longer within the manger of the heart of the prophet william branham the message is now standing on its own two feet the revelation is making itself known and interpret god interpreting his own word hallelujah thank god and speaking for himself through his word glory be to god amen yes sir listen except a man be born again he shall in no wise he shall in no wise he won't be a wise man oh praise god hallelujah brother sister thank god for his blessed work he won't be able to enter the kingdom of the living god the entry point into the kingdom oh the way to glory or the portals of god the way the truth the life into christ hallelujah glory to his name hallelujah thank god wise men are usually hungry for the word that's why they chase after it they follow it till they find it in every way blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled glory to god hallelujah friends the wise men were truly wise they were wise because they brought to him their gifts which means that before they left their land their nation their country they already had whether you wanted to call it a fuzzy revelation but they had some kind of a revelation each one had an individual revelation because one saw him bringing gold to represent that he saw him reveal to him as king king and the other one had a revelation of him and he saw him as the great high priest hallelujah lord of god oh my praise god the last one saw him amen he saw him he brought mer and he saw him by his revelation that he was the true lamb not the substitute animals but the true lamb that was supposed to die and become their savior and that he was born to die and so he brought myrrh to represent that my friends so we see them bringing gold frankincense and myrrh represented re representing kingship deity on divinity frankincense representing his intercessory ministry and priesthood and his mediatorship oh glory to god hallelujah murr representing his death oh my and his post and position as redeemer to bring redemption for the entire world that the people who sat in darkness shall see a great light and the glory of god has sprung up i rise awake and come to the light for them for the praise god the light is reason and the word is giving us light for this day and for this hour hallelujah oh praise god god came in flesh as his own prophet to make himself known thank god in this hour may we be wise like the wise men and come to god and give to him all of our talents all of our gifts that he has given us let us give our lives as not dead animal sacrifices back there but give your life as a living sacrifice living and sacrificing for this message and the things you may and must go through as a living sacrifice for the glory of the living god hallelujah amen praise god hallelujah also let us give him our gifts of our lives today let us magnify and glorify him by the way we live today let us adore him magnify him by the lies we show we express to the world everywhere for his glory and for his honor praise god now after they have given to the christ in actual fact to his spirits hallelujah after they had given the appropriate gifts amen that reflected who he was his birth his life and his death they left and began to return back to their own country but there were sought out by herod and i must tell you when you have caught this revelation they may not understand what you are saying everything you're saying but they're recognized you caught something and they would like to know where that came from and how can we get it what mean it this how men and brethren what shall we do to get it can we buy it can we question you and ask you about it amen so they were sought out by herod and his people because herod didn't catch the revelation the rabbis didn't catch it his wise men his astrologers didn't catch it at that time but he wanted to have an intellectual knowledge or understanding of that revelation of who this christ was this anointed word was this king god king word king of righteousness king of peace if he wanted to have an understanding of what was going on in his kingdom and what did they really find out what did they discover or he wanted an explanation what was it what is it that's revealed to you let me know this amen hallelujah and the wise men knew this what was made known to them by god himself being warned of god in a dream i know better said the servant and prophet of god to go tell you a revelation of what god has made known to me until it's already in progress and it happens and then it's too late satan can do nothing oh praise god being warned in a dream said the bible matthew chapter 2 verse 12 their return to their own country the bible says another way that did not go back the same way they came and if you come listen recognize and this revelation strikes your heart you'll never return the same way that you came in i'm not just talking about uh a sinner in the street a homeless person or some body out there that knows uh nothing about the god right in this message hearing all the courts reading all the scriptures reading all the texts following it for many years but never really caught the true light that shine it in this hour but if you open your heart if you are one of those elected seed you will truly see but that is the identification of the spoken word bride of christ giving you eyes to see an ears to hear others sitting right there beside you will not understand not one thing they'll understand the english but they won't understand they circle the fullness of the word of god that is being known in this day and in this hour we are in the same position my eyes have seen the coming of the glory of the lord oh he is tripping out his vintage the grapes of wrath of sword oh praise god forevermore hallelujah amen i've seen the king brother sister i seen the lord of hosts in the word of god said that isaiah i say the same thing i see the lord high and lifted up before me and his train fills the temple praise god forevermore once seeing him you can't remain the same you're going to go back another way you're going to return not the same way you were but you're going to return a different person because your eyes have seen the lord of hosts your eyes have caught a glimpse appear pierce the veil beyond the veil and looked into glory and recognize the man that's passing on the rock oh glory god hallelujah amen yes sir oh praise god they went back a different way they did not return by those gates by which they entered in they did not go back to their denominational gates they did not return to ask questions of herod the wise men the rabbi the learned man the religious leaders the dignitaries oh my god the bible says being warned of god in a dream they went around and went out by a different way all glory be unto god hallelujah amen oh my friends i tell you things are different now since i gave my heart to jesus this understanding of the word has opened up a different way yes said the prophet now that the word has opened up this bible has become a new bible to me lord of god a different way has opened up hallelujah oh my glory to his marvelous wonderful name that we have seen here in the word of god hallelujah by which we must escape quickly escape quickly run for your life hallelujah come here quickly flee for the mountains fleet to the mountaintop lord of god hallelujah i was in israel some time ago and while there they pointed out to me a great pillar of salt standing by the shores of the dead sea where sodom and gomorrah lies buried beneath the dead sea and there on its backs stands that pillar of salt which is thought to be lot's wife oh my friends flee into this capstone revelation of this day and of this hour don't look back don't look back to those seven church don't look back to the wonderful things that happened over there but place your eyes upon god's word for this day and for this hour hallelujah don't lust long or desire for all the wonderful things that were in the seven church ages as soon as the street miracles signs wonders all manner of things that would astonish your mind and your heart put your trust in the true and in the living god and don't lust for those things you say what are you talking about it was there in pentecost it was there under the genuine pentecost of acts 2 4 but i'm telling you keep your eyes on the word ask god for wisdom revelation of the word like solomon did and when you have caught that all these other things will be added on to you all the other things you did not ask for all the signs all the wonders all the miracles all the supernatural all the divine graces and powers and presences and anointings of the living god will just follow your life and follow you amen praise god because like solomon you're asking god for the wisest greatest things that's wise why i take the wisdom of the wise men and i pray you'll take the wisdom of the wise men also praise god hallelujah or praise god may god give you all that your heart desires may he reveal to you his greatest good even though you did not ask for riches fame fortune lusted after the things that were in those ages yet god will grant to you the things your hearts desire for behold a greater than solomon is now here may god bless you i tell you happy new year a happy and a blessed and prosperous 20 21 good neighbor ministries welcomes you every time to this broadcast and wishes

presence and the stimulation of the blessed holy spirit of the living god and to give him glory and honor amen now in our past year 2020 a plague struck the earth as it did in egypt and once again god's people are caught in the midst of the enshrouding darkness but we're given the same command you must have the token you must have the token are you going to do it you cannot earn it you cannot work yourself into it but you can ask god to reveal to you whether or not that token seed charm gene attribute of god lies buried within your heart they're the seed of life this word creative word of god speaking life to it saying come forth let it be for the glory of god may the spirit of almighty god deep calls to the deep and the deep must respond hallelujah yes friends it's a dark day perilous and chaotic times it's dangerous but thank god it's jubilee time it's jubilee time 2021 3 multiplied by 7 equal 21 perfection of perfection perfection of redemption could this be the time of total deliverance could it be they are of juba spiritual jubilee upon us oh i believe friends we are right in the season rapture time lord of god i believe it's rapture time i believe the holy spirit is drawing nigh to pull up people out glory to god hallelujah amen yes sir time for total deliverance all bondages all habits all things that try to hang on cling on or hold on to you must let go and set you free in the name of jesus christ for his glory and for his honor amen amen so friends i want to thank all of you for your faithfulness to the word of god as taught by the holy spirit through the ministry of malachi 4 5 and through me saying what i see in that same word of malachi 4 5 hallelujah i want to thank you for your loyalty to the lord jesus christ the living word the living one who lives and walks among us i want to thank all of you in the midst of this chaotic madness that's going on around us the plague swirling everywhere with maddening rapidity spreading everywhere and yet my friends i want to thank you for your unfailing unflagging and unfaltering financial and moral support thanks be to god i also want to thank you for your various prayers for me personally for the church i want to thank you for your emotional strength for even when jesus was in the garden of gethsemane the bible says and angels came to straighten him i ask god that he will use some of you your lies your ministry to be a strength and encouragement to me and to all the other ministers everywhere who are preaching the word of god with all their heart and all their soul may the spirit of god bless them use them and use you to be pillars in the temple of my god blessed be his name lord of god forevermore yes sir praise god friends because of the presence circumstances because of the shutdowns that we are experiencing we are not able to meet in our tabernacle face to face and to enjoy one another's presence fellowship we can do that on the phone and do it through media but that's good but it's not the same as when we meet and talk and fellowship together around the world and assemble for his glorious name on the lord's day and open up the lord's book to give glory to the lord's name my friends this is a testing time 2021 a testing time a year of testing a time of testing it's a sifting time it's a time where god is proving his word because god is trying to prove us us to our faithfulness to his revealed word of this hour our action to reaction how do we react to the circumstances and to his word amen will we wonder about the word because of these dignitaries rabbis and uh men out there that claim they can read the stars also they have some understanding of the messenger are we to begin to cause them to say things that will make you wonder and then after you start start wondering will they cause you to wander away from the message of the hour the word of god given for this day and for this time will you become a piece of dry duck a dried up driftwood card away on the tides of time oh my brother my sister look to the word of god look to the lamb of god hallelujah don't allow in this hour for god is doing it he has put every one of us on an individual basis away from pastor away from this away from church away from that one away from the other one that he might personally try you and prove you as to your personal faith not that you are propped up like a tomato plant not that you are held up together but god wants to see your faith in his word and he is now proving his word and testing you in the wilderness of this day and of this hour just in you as to our meeting to worship friends let me say to you it's now all up to you it's up to you each must answer for him herself or himself you can decide to go back to or into denominationalism
