praise God it's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight trusting everybody's having a good week praise God and do we have power here we go praise God so we're going to be continuing on the thought of perfect unity in Christ though we started back on June the 4th and tonight we're going to just dig a little deeper into it by God's grace so we're going to turn to our first scripture this evening is John Chapter 13 Verse 34 and 35 before we do that let's just bow our heads in prayer father we're grateful this evening Lord that every Wednesday night you're here before we even get here you're waiting you're ready your soul just willing to bless and and anoint the atmosphere so that we can enter into Heavenly places with you and receive everything that you would have for us this evening Lord many thoughts are pondering Upon Our Hearts every day we think of the dealings of this life and all that concerns our future and Lord there's this wonderful Revelation that burns within our hearts that says that our future is clear because you have made a way for us and so tonight we ask your anointing to come and just take control and just bless us this evening Lord walk with us tonight speak with us tonight Lord and do something that Lord we can leave just a little better than we came in Lord a little more of you in our lives granted we pray in Jesus name amen praise God John 13 34 says a new commandment I give unto you that ye love one another as I have loved you and ye also love one another by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another God bless you Saints you may be seated brother Branham speaking here in uniting time and sign 1963 we read this quote back on June the 4th and I just want to open up with it again here tonight just to kind of bring us back into the thought God is uniting his bride she is coming together from the East and the west and the North and South there is a uniting time and that's on right now what is she uniting for the Rapture amen God getting her ready yes sir uniting what is she uniting with with the word for all heavens and earth will pass away but my words shall never pass away she's uniting herself with thus saith the Lord regardless of what any denomination or anybody else says she's uniting herself she's getting ready why she's the bride that's right and she's uniting herself with her bridegroom see and the bridegroom is the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and the church and the bride and the word is becoming so one until the very word itself is working out the works of the bridegroom amen you see it are uniting not no more join the church not more of this but flee from everything and tied to Jesus Christ see it's the uniting time God uniting his bride together bringing it back just exactly uniting the words of his promise second Thessalonians second chapter it says rather fifth chapter says the saints that are asleep in the dust of the earth will awaken and then we will Unite with them the living ones with the ones that's being dead will unite before we even get up there because the bride now listen here the bride because the bride will be complete when she gets there the ones that's living that's uniting themselves with the word and those that are gone already did that and it all comes together makes one great Union of the uniting before going up there amen amazing praise God forevermore Hallelujah next slide Matthew chapter 5 verses 38 to 45. you know we're talking about this bride coming together brother Branham made it very clear that when he went to the other side and he went beyond the curtain of time he made it very clear that nothing but perfect love could enter into that place he was in the he was in the presence of perfect love and so we look at the um you know at the at the Capstone and the pyramid and we see the ages that we've come through and we know now exactly where we are we know the age that we're living in and we know that we've crossed that Chasm we know that we've gone from church age to Eternal Church age we've gone you know that's why there's that Gap there between the the Capstone and and the actual Church ages themselves it's because the Holy Spirit himself is the only one that can take you into that place into that Capstone into that perfect place where there's a perfect Unity where there is no division there's no separation there's only separation in this flesh the only thing that that causes division amongst us and amongst human beings is because we see things with the flesh we see things with the carnal mind we interpret things with our carnal mind and because we're human we get weak and all of a sudden the enemy knows that we're weak in our conscious carnal State because he can inject negative thoughts into us he can turn us one against the other he turns people against one another and and look at the world and look at the condition of the world it's total chaos there's Division and and every area he's Satan is just trying to divide the people but not this bride she's being united with him our uh if we have anything in common it's the one thing that we have in common is that we are attributes of God other than that you were born in this country born under this nationality born under this uh you know family under this certain environment and you've got all kinds of things that go against you in this Dimension and because of that we carry all these scars and we carry all these weaknesses and and we can't help it we get we we get into these battles most of the time the greatest battles are right here right in our own minds because we believe certain thoughts that the devil will try and and put between us because listen this is the time that we unite there's a perfect Unity that's coming together in the bride this is what we're working towards here right now as the Bride of Jesus Christ so let's let's read here Matthew 5 38-45 you've heard that it hath being said and I for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you that you resists that that ye resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man will will will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him two miles next slide uh verse 43 you have heard that it hath been said that ye shall love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth forth Reign on the just and on the unjust praise God forevermore aren't you glad to know that God has given you a revelation of of what all this world condition division separation War the the the purpose behind it all the evil that's behind it but yet God is telling you no you're not a part of that you're not to unite with that you're not to to to get you know a lot of people they want to watch the news and they want to feed on the news and they want to feed on all the garbage that's constantly being you know sent over the Airways into the media so that they can get the people talking negative and getting them into the into Satan's program which is a program of division he's come to divide he's come to to separate he's come to destroy that's his that's his whole purpose but Jesus given us a revelation saying no don't allow what he's saying in this scripture is is don't allow that same Spirit to come upon you that's why you know I explained to people sometimes about you know the understanding of turning the other cheek when somebody you know comes in and and says something against you and you turn the other cheek it's he's saying don't allow that same Spirit of Revenge don't allow that same Spirit of of you know spite to come upon you so that you would react in the same way because that spirit's looking for a way to jump on you and to get you into a defeated condition praise God brother Brown speaking he says love one another above everything love one another don't no matter what the devil tries to say now you're all one great big sweet group right now but remember my warning see Satan won't let that stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything he has to bring somebody in to make his Target he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in set him down and cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things then he will shoot that guy with some kind of a poison stuff and he'll start through the church with it amen don't you take sides with it you know we're talking about perfect unity in Christ and you know the things we're going to look at this evening it's Bible study right we're going to look at certain things and you know these things are are how the enemy tries to infiltrate the church how the enemy tries to divide the people here we are at a time where God is doing a great work in our midst that we're in a transition time we're we're in a time where we're between uh Earth and Heaven we're being transitioned into Heavenly places we're being transitioned into our Eternal bodies this is the time this is the focus this is what we should be focused on we're we're in the rapture but remember the enemy is going to try and attack in so many ways he'll attack right in your own home you'll attack you at work he'll attack you in so many different ways and so we want to just you know refresh ourselves and fortify ourselves with with the with the word of God that's been given to us he says don't you take sides with it don't you have nothing to do with it anything else you stay right loving and sweet and kind to one another pray for that man that he'll be saved to or that woman ever who it is just pray for them and stick one with another and stay with your pastor see he's the shepherd and you give him respects he'll lead you through and cause and and cause he's ordained of God to do so hallelujah praise God God has a provided way for us amen God has placed Us in this church here under this ministry for protection a lot of people don't understand that people don't realize that when you when you find your your position in the church where God has placed you do you realize that you are placing yourself and your family under the protection of the Lord as a member of that church do you realize the power of God through the authorities that God has placed that's why you know they don't want a lot of people say oh you don't need the five-fold ministry in that five-fold Ministry are pastors and God placed them there for a reason God has anointed them to Shepherd you as his sheep and and for that very purpose God has placed an anointing and a protection around his sheep and people want to rebel against the pastor they want to talk and they want to murmur about the pastor in the background they don't realize what they're doing they don't realize that they're actually breaking down their own protection God has a provided way within the ministry God has Deacons God has placed them there for a purpose where you know we're talking about the body of Christ here and the way God has designed it it's designed to protect you it's designed to nourish you it's designed to bless you and prosper you in whatever it is that you're doing because as a member of this ministry and this particular Body of Christ and God calling you to this ministry there's a reason and a purpose for it it's so that this ministry can prosper and so that you can prosper not talking about financial prosperity here we're talking about uniting the bride for the rapture we're talking about bringing the people together in one Faith one Unity One baptism one God you know having an understanding that we are a part of the mystical body of Jesus Christ and that we nourish and edify one another when we are positionally placed and know our position it gives strength to the whole Ministry this strength this this ministry can can be completely fortified because of you being in your position and everyone recognizing that allows the Holy Spirit to move through every office nourish you edify you correct you when you need it give you uh wisdom and understanding through through your deacons and and through the ministry of the word when you come every Wednesday every Sunday to assemble yourself there's a supernatural protection that comes with being a part of the body of Jesus Christ and not just being apart but being under subjection to it Hallelujah now do you remember now you remember that the enemy will come and when he does just cling that much closer together and the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you that's all don't never Clan among one another talk make yourself clannish We Are One I couldn't say left hand I'm mad at you I'm going to take you away because you're not a right hand he's my left hand I want him to stay there even the little tip of my finger I want it to stay right there every little part of my body stay right there and God wants us as a body of Believers to stay right exactly with one another right it with one another Hallelujah glory to God Amen God wants us to recognize that we need one another I need you and you need me it's as simple as that when we understand how powerful it is to be a part of the body of Jesus Christ and that God is now bringing us together for the Rapture and only perfect love can be in that place we need to understand one another we need to see one another as human and understand that we have weaknesses every one of us there's nobody in this church here tonight or out there that's listening in that's perfect as long as you're in this human flesh you you have weakness in you you're actually in a body that's against God your your mind your carnal mind is that enmity with God that's scriptural the things that you should be doing at times you're not doing it you entertain the thoughts of the enemy but we're not we're we're moving on we're we're moving on brother halleluia sister we're going in the rapture that's why we join this church I remember when I first came into this ministry and I caught a revelation of the Rapture I never knew about any kind of a Rapture I thought I thought what you mean we're going to actually be translated our bodies are going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye we're going to escape all the chaos of this world we're gonna we're gonna be able to leave this place and and and we're going to go for for an absolute reunion that that eyes have not seen years have not heard nor has it even entered into the heart of man what God has in store for are you kidding me I remember when that was breaking on my heart and I thought wow you mean this is this is not everything because at that time I got I had a lot of problems we we all we we all had a lot of pro and some of us even still got problems but I'm telling you something you're gonna be going in a rapture you're going to be translated from this place amen praise God we're not going to be staying here hallelujah glory to God but we need perfect love go to the next slide First Corinthians 13 though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity I am become as a sounding brass or a tingling symbol and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not love charity loved there's a supernatural Revelation behind that word love it's called God's love it's called it's called God's revelation of love God's interpretation of Love towards you it's a love that that supersedes human understanding that's why Gifts of Prophecy Gifts of knowledge knowing the mysteries of the word we could know all the Mysteries you know we could we could preach on every mystery in the opening of the word and the so and the the half hour of silence and everything else and yet we could be as miserable as miserable can be because the enemy is constantly bombarding our minds and trying to divide us and separate us no more no more and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not love it prophetth mean nothing and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is love amen next slide and that's why it's so important now to understand the function of the five-fold ministry and why it's so important for us to understand that being a part of the body of Christ supernaturally is one thing and then being a part of a local Ministry is just as important because that's where it all comes together that's where we all unite that's where we get corrected that's where we get delivered we come into the house of the Lord so that because judgment starts in the house of the Lord fail not to assemble yourselves even more so as that day which day the Rapture Day the day that we depart from here Hallelujah we need to assemble ourselves and we need to understand that Ephesians 4 verses 11 to 13. is is a very vital aspect of this body of Christ coming together uniting together edifying one another and building up for the perfection of the church and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers what for for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ we are a part of the body of Christ we are being united for the rapture perfect Unity is is something that we will achieve as the members of the body of Jesus Christ we need to enter into that by revelation God is going to give us this revelation of perfect Unity as we feed on the word of God because it's required for us to be changed amen praise God till we all what come together until we all come in the unity of the revelation and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man a perfect revelation of who God is unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Jesus Christ this word just you know it just never stops unveiling itself I mean you've probably read this a hundred times well I just got I just got more faith out of reading that last little line there that says unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ we need the fullness of his love we need the fullness of his of his uh understanding of who we are in the body of Christ his understanding of who we are our understanding of who we are we get confused because we listen to the carnal mind too much we listen to the lies of the enemy that tells oh but you're you're such a weak Christian no no let me tell you something when you're at your weakest Point that's when you're the strongest because you allow the fullness of God to take control over your life over the circumstances over the situations you see you can turn it around and send it right back to the enemy when he tells you you're weak you tell them good when I'm weak you're defeated because now you can't you you can fight me and you can try and defeat me but you can't defeat the one that's in me that's greater than me and greater than you because there's a fullness of Jesus Christ that we are entering into praise God forevermore go to the next slide we've read we've seen this we've we've we've we look at it but you know what there's all these aspects that are in there they're all aspects of Christ it's not you trying to put on perfect faith not you trying to put on virtue oh I got virtue oh brother when I you know when I when I go into a room you know the people they they get blessed because I'm in the room and they feed off of me because I'm full of God I've got so much Revelation and are you kidding it's Christ in you your hope of glory it's not oh I've studied so much that I can I can quote every quote and I know the Bible from from Genesis to Revelation good for you the letter killeth you need the spirit of God to give you a revelation of who you are and your part in the word of God Amen you need the knowledge of who you are not the knowledge of God the knowledge of who you are because once you come to realize that you'll realize that you're a part of God Hallelujah Temperance patience oh I got to be patient I got to be more patient yeah these are things that that that that take place and when you know when you get tested and the enemy comes in and tests you and he's pushing you and he's getting you to try and blow your fuse it's at those times that you that you dig deeper into Christ that's where the scripture says be still and know that I am God be still and know that I am still your Defender I'm your keeper I'm the one that's going to stand there and deal with this situation that you're that you that you think it's going to take you you think you're done you think you're finished you're not finished you're not you've only just begun I'm doing this work I have spoken it I will perform it it's godliness is not something that we put on oh I'm going to be Godly I'm going to be holy you you you you want to please the Lord by your attitude your attitude should be to please the Lord not to please others when you please the Lord and your uh your attitude towards one another is is with the right motive and and you you you're looking at him and you're saying Lord help me to be more compassionate towards this situation more sincere towards these situations you're seeking the inner aspect and the depths of God that's that that that that's what's perfect Hallelujah glory to God for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ really it's if you got the Holy Ghost if you've got the spirit of God in you then you've got a chance I want to um just bring out uh seven effective ways on how to preserve unity in the church these are practical things but these are things that we need to be reminded of and there's there's ways that we can you know um preserve the unity Focus number one focus on what we have in common not on our differences that's the thing that's why I said at the beginning the thing that we have most in common is the attribute of God is the fact that Jesus Christ lives in us that's that's what gives us Fellowship I wouldn't have never known you brother Philip I would have never known any of any of you and probably would not be you know um I'd probably be you know like living in the world like most of us with our own people nationalities you know birds of a feather they usually flock together right but here we are and what you just look around you and you see a multi-colored uh bouquet of God you know faith in different aspects being reflected in different ways different gifts being reflected for the body of Jesus Christ gifts being offered for the purpose of of edifying and building the purpose and the plan of God of Jesus Christ so that we can bring the rapture bring bring the faith of the Rapture into the hearts of the people amen no two heads are the same no two thumb marks are the same understand and accept that we all have different personalities but we have the mind of Christ isn't that amazing that you know that that there's one thing that you'll never argue when it comes to the revelation of God's word when you've got the mind of Christ you may have your own opinion and some people like to really Express their opinion and they want their opinion to be heard and their opinion if you don't if you don't accept their opinion then they don't accept you that's a spirit that's a spirit of pride that's what that is but not in the body of Christ we need to understand that there are different personalities different aspects and we need to see the good in one another God has a way of correcting the bad God has a way of dealing with the situations that need to be dealt with within the body of Christ he's made a way amen but there's different personalities different backgrounds different races nationalities tastes and preferences God is a god of variety we have one Lord One Faith one baptism working for the same goal or purpose amen focus on what we have in common not on our differences conflict is the destroyer of unity we need to be conscious we need to be aware you know sometimes our attitude and our opinion because we want to express it and we want to be heard when we come together whether it's in a meeting or whether it's in fellowship or whatever it is our attitude and our approach to situations will bring conflict in the way that we communicate things I mean I'm learning that more than ever with my kids and the people of this I you know I have a lot of employees that I that I deal with and nowadays you've got to be careful how you talk to people because you know you you ask them to do something you're expecting them to do something and if you tell them in a way that it's a little bit too sharp right away it's like you get the attitude are you verbally abusing me I mean everybody's looking for a way to sue somebody somehow some way you know but this is the situation that this is the kind of atmospheres that we're living in now and if we're not careful and if we're not sensitive to it we can get caught up into it ourselves and all of a sudden our attitudes and our ways of communicating start to bring uh conflict which destroys Unity conflict is a sign that your focus has shifted from Christ to other carnal issues we need to keep the focus what is the reason the purpose of the discussion or the situation or the circumstance the Bible admonishes us to look unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith number two personal criticism must be avoided there's a way to to uh Nobody's Perfect and so we don't need to look you know because we're all Sinners and we're all saved by the grace of God it's kind of preaching's a little different right but it's down to earth it's down it's you know it's where the metal hits the the roads where the rubber hits the road kind of situations right because you're out there working every day I'm out there working every day we're rubbing shoulders with the world and the situations that we deal with every single day you know I had somebody just the other day had full-blown road rage on me completely lost it and it was absolutely totally unnecessary there was so much you know I just came in got into the lane and the person was behind me and you know because I came into the lane that person just didn't like it that I that I pulled out in front of him you know tons of room no potential for an accident no nothing he completely lost it followed me all the way home all the way home and I thought hmm because I pulled in and I purposely didn't go in where I normally go in I said this guy has lost his mind because people they they they they they they just they lose it out there because they're under a lot of pressure and he was there with his wife too and you know you just and you know so I thought oh man you know so I just went in and I parked my truck and I got out of my truck and I just stood there and I knew he was coming I said he's come yeah so I just stood there and I waited and I and and he came around the corner and he looked at me and I guess maybe he saw something that he didn't like you know six foot and I can give a look I'm not gonna I'm not gonna just let somebody just you know come in and just you know come in and take a shot or whatever I would do what I have to do you should do whatever you have to do you know what I'm saying to protect yourself we turn the cheek that's that's that's something that that we that we apply but if somebody's gonna come up and take a shot and try to take a swing at you you need to duck anyway he pulled up and he put down his window and he just unloaded himself on me and I just stood there and I watched him and he completely carried on and left the parking lot okay now you know I could have gotten just as Road rages but I had a smile I had because I'm not going to buy into that I'm not going to allow that Spirit to take control when you allow the spirit of God to take control in your heart in your mind that you know that you're you're a Son of God you're a daughter of God if you know where you stand you have nothing to fear you have nothing to fear you don't have to uh step out and and be the aggressor or or or you know give your opinion on the whole situation avoid so nobody is perfect we're all Sinners God came to save us all other believers might disappoint you but they are still your brothers and sisters never be an idealist avoid too high expectation for others understand that everybody has weaknesses and strengths amen praise God number three choose to encourage rather than to criticize in other words you know like and so like you know I'm learning those things you know you you read these things and you you start to apply them in in your life right you know so when you see you know something like if for example if I see an employee and he's doing five things right and he's doing 13 things wrong I'm gonna first emphasize on the five things that he's doing right so that I can encourage him and then show him how he can improve and this is how you can improve this instead of doing it like instead of telling them you're doing this all wrong you did this wrong that wrong dot wrong well this here okay you did okay now how is that going to encourage that person you've started right away with a discouraging thought and you've you've you've criticized them right off the bat and they're not going to feel encouraged and they're not going to be motivated to work for me anymore or to work for you or to work together with you right let us not compare with nor judge others Romans 14 4 who art thou that just judges another man's servant to his own Master he standeth or falleth yea he shall be holding up for God is able to make him stand Romans 14 13 let us not therefore judge one another anymore but judge this rather that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way in other words don't criticize him don't give him something that he's going to stumble over give him something that he can step up and over and say you can you can leave that behind you can that that thing that was that was tormenting you in the past and had control over you and your life in the past God has given you faith that you can overcome this thing you don't have to stay that way you don't have to continue that way that's not who you are encourage and do not criticize number four refuse to listen to gossip oh yeah it starts out as oh brother sister you know did you hear this did you hear that did you see this did you see that it's gossip gossip is the passing of information when you are neither part of it you're neither part of the problem nor the solution so why should you know about it God has his provided ways of dealing with those things that's why you have an issue go to your deacon now you're going to somebody that holds the solution amen or if you're you're strong enough you can go directly to the brother and say or the sister and say hey let's sit and reason let's talk about this let's communicate and let's let's let's get this devil that's trying to separate us amen and put in put him where he belongs and let's get to where we belong which is in the body of Christ United together for the Rapture of the church Hallelujah that's what we're called to do that's what that's why God called us you've been called to this ministry because you've been called to the Rapture of the church that's why you've been called into the body of Jesus Christ of course you have a position the Bible says Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor people who gossip to you will also gossip about you they can't be trusted all of a sudden you know if you listen you know if they're saying that about them and I see them the way they oh hi God bless you this and that and then the next minute they're talking how can you trust that it doesn't work that way that's not Christ that's not perfect Unity that's not the way to refuse to listen to gossip James 3 5-6 says even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth and the tongue is a fire that it defileth the whole body and is setteth on fire the course of Nature and it is set on fire of hell First John 3 15 whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him the prophet said if you can't say anything good about a brother or a sister don't speak at all hallelujah praise God number five resolve conflict according to the Bible Way let the word of God if you place the word of God into your conflict and you allow the word to be the the the the the the the mender and you know Matthew 18 15 to 18 says moreover If thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him privately in the love of God with a desire and a revelation to deliver him and you because the enemy is is against him and you and he's going to try and put you against him him against you and so when you do it if if ye shall he if he shall hear thee thou has gained thy brother Hallelujah but if he will not hear thee then take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three Witnesses every word may be established and you would do that through the Avenue of the deacons of the church that's where you would rely on the spirit of God and when you have this kind of desire and understanding to submit yourself to the word of God all things are possible I don't care how difficult it might look or how it might feel God can take those feelings out God can supernaturally remove those things once your heart has become pure towards the whole situation God will completely deliver you you'll be set free and it'll never torment you no more Hallelujah glory to God if he shall neglect to hear them tell it unto the church but if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a publican these are things of the word number six support your leaders first Thessalonians 5 12 and 13 and we beseech you Brethren to know them which labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you and to esteem them very highly in love for their Works sake amen praise God everybody that labors in the house of the Lord needs to be respected those that are the leaders that direct and guide and God has given to anoint them to to protect and and watch over you they need to be recognized and highly respected and loved amen praise God Hebrews 13 17 obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they that must give account to they that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you the Bible says it's unprofitable for you that if you are not supporting your leadership you're not getting behind that position fully supporting it whether it be through your tithes through your offerings and through your cooperation making yourself available giving yourself of time if the pastor or you know the the cleaning committee or the the women's fellowship or the men's fellowship every time they have an event nobody shows up how does that encourage the leaders it discourages them we should be doing all that we can to admonish and encourage one another amen support our leaders and finally number seven seek the good of others not merely your own good look to see how this is going to work for good to the whole body of Christ for the whole in the First Corinthians 10 24 let no man seek his own but every man another's wealth look for ways to bless and to prosper amen glory to God now here's five major hindrances to Unity hypocrisy legalism bitterness taking advantage of others and false Doctrine there's a lot of things that are that are that are moving right now in the Realms and the ranks of the message that I can say is false Doctrine man's own interpretations man's uh you know absolutely trying to make it you know that that's the word of God no God is his own interpreter amen praise God legalism people say no this is how it has to be this is the only way that it has to be Jesus Christ is his own interpreter he is the one that's making it plain in this day and in this hour we must allow the Holy Spirit to have his way amen praise God glory to God Amen we're going to wind this down here let's go to the next slide 2nd Thessalonians 3 10. keep going there we go on work and responsibility being responsible second Thessalonians for even when we were with you this we commanded you that if any work not would not work neither should he eat for we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly working not at all but our busy bodies First Timothy 5 8 but if any provide not for his own and especially for those of his own house he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel you know sometimes we got to be careful that that we take full responsibility on ourselves to work and to do whatever it is whatever position we have in the body of Christ this is what we're talking about here but it but it but it but it starts you know in our own personal lives that we we must have a desire to do what we must do as individuals to work and to and to uh provide for our homes and our families and not be relying upon you know relying on the ministry relying that you know oh well you know I can go and ask for you know no that doesn't strengthen the church it's important for us to understand that we all have a part and that we all must take responsibility for the work that God has given us whether it is you know being you know a secretary in a committee or being part of the youth ministry the position that you know that God has placed on your heart you know the things that God has given you do it work take responsibility don't don't shun it don't look for the easy way out amen praise God hallelujah next slide debt oh no man anything you're thinking like what are we talking about these things for uh you know like these things are practical things in our lives I'm not talking about where it's wrong to have a mortgage or where it's wrong to you know to to have a loan for a vehicle or or or whatever because you're working and you're responsibly paying for those things I'm talking about where we we allow certain though you go borrow money from a brother or a sister and you just nonchalantly you don't think you you that you that you need to they may not say anything they may not come to you and ask you for it but if they gave it to you in the way that when you came to them and they asked for it and you did it to assist them then you borrowed that money and you should be responsible enough to think that at some point in time it should be paid or somebody comes and does work for you and they do a certain work for you and they're supposed to get paid for that work and you allow that debt to linger no sir those things are gonna still hang around your life and you're going to wonder why certain aspects and certain things you can't move forward in certain areas in your life you just find yourself stumbling when it comes to you know getting ahead in certain ways is because you're allowing certain things to linger and to hang on you oh no man nothing that's the lingering debts that you could pay pay them you don't that's owing no man nothing it doesn't mean my we owe our rent our telephone bill we and what more we we owe those things and we pay them but an old lingering debt that you could be paying on pay it pay on it if you can't pay it all pay on it continue to work on it so that eventually it's out of the way and you and you will see that you'll actually be set free to be who you are supposed to be in the body of Jesus Christ pay it off see now don't go with anything hanging on you like that glory to God and so let's just go to the final slide here and we're going to end it right here Romans 12 be kindly affectionate one to another with Brotherly Love in honor preferring one another not slothful in business fervent in spirit serving the lord rejoicing in Hope patient in Tribulation continuing instant in prayer Distributing to the necessity of saints given to hospitality don't be afraid to bless the body of Christ do it in the right spirit do it unto the Lord and let the Holy Spirit bless and prosper Hallelujah bless them which persecute you bless and curse not rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep be of the same mind one towards another my not the high things but condescend to Men of law estate be not wise in your own conceits Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't eternal life eternal life is living for others it proved that when he came in the Lamb of God he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for of others brother Branham that day on Calvary let the musicians come praise God hallelujah we're living in a uniting Time uniting time listen to this uniting time for the church oh my uniting every word that's been scattered all abroad by these organizations ever since at niacia Rome when they organized the first church and they've organized Luther they've organized Wesley they've organized all the rest of the churches and doing that they had to adopt a Creed and then when God sent something else they could not receive it therefore it was not possible until now aren't you glad God sent us a prophet to restore and God promised in the last days that the faith of the fathers would be restored back to the bride again that it would be this way and it couldn't be no other time but this time look what a sign from Heaven as a pillar of fire hanging Among Us and with signs and wonders of the Lord Jesus Christ and while he speaks to us it never fails to be perfectly on the dot amen then we see where we're standing uniting time he says we see Nations uniting we see world uniting we see communism uniting we see the churches uniting we see God uniting himself with his bride Hallelujah until he and the church is the same thing Hallelujah like the pyramid there right uniting themselves together God uniting why never before since the early church age was the pillar of fire ever among the people never before since the early church age did they ever see the things that we are seeing today and this was only made possible when God sent the Seven Seals and give us a Sign by it and sent seven angels down out of heaven and come to bring back that scattered word in them denominations you know that scattered word it's you it's me we were scattered all over but God is uniting us God is bringing us back into the body God is delivering us setting us free from the bondage of this world so that we can be liberated into the rapturing faith that he has prepared for us amen and tie it back into the word of God again to bring down his holy spirit glory to God Amen what a time we're uniting Saints aren't you aren't you glad that God has called you to unite into this mystical body praise God forevermore Hallelujah thank you Jesus you have a song for us brother [Music] Hallelujah [Music] bind us
