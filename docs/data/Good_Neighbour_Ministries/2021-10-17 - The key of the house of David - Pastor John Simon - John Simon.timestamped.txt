[43:34] he brought me
[43:44] oh
[43:50] [Music]
[44:04] somebody say amen

[44:08] [Applause]
[44:11] [Music]
[44:22] oh
[44:27] [Music]
[44:55] thanks be to god
[44:57] may the lord bless us all here today in
[45:00] his presence please be seated
[45:03] thank god
[45:05] we're now in the fall of the year
[45:08] and all the trees are beginning to as i
[45:11] usually say are beginning to show their
[45:14] true colors
[45:18] and
[45:19] as we come to this time when the lord is
[45:22] harvest time and
[45:24] dying for thanksgiving day in heaven and
[45:29] collecting and harvesting his fruits
[45:32] then every tree
[45:34] will show its true color
[45:36] every believer
[45:38] will show their true colors
[45:41] of what was hidden
[45:43] underneath what looked like just green
[45:48] but the true colors are starting to come
[45:50] out gradually
[45:53] and that's the way god planned it all
[45:56] and so therefore
[45:57] as a minister as a pastor
[46:00] i am a shepherd
[46:03] and the shepherd doesn't chase
[46:06] after sheep
[46:09] sheep naturally follow the shepherd
[46:12] even when they don't understand
[46:15] they don't even know where the shepherd
[46:16] is going
[46:17] they just follow the shepherd
[46:20] what goats they know so they run ahead
[46:23] they just run ahead of the shepherd
[46:25] they're jumping they're scampering there
[46:27] doing all kinds of things
[46:29] now the shepherd doesn't chase goats
[46:33] he just walks and the sheep follow him
[46:38] because their faith in the shepherd is
[46:40] what does that mean and that's all he
[46:42] has praise the lord
[46:45] so i thank the lord for his grace for
[46:47] his love and his mercy
[46:50] be given praise and glory to give glory
[46:53] to god i believe in uh
[46:56] by next week you should be entering
[46:59] into a study
[47:01] of the 40 days what is it brother danny
[47:06] 40 days of prayer
[47:08] many years ago we did 40 years
[47:12] days of purpose
[47:14] but now we're going to be doing
[47:17] 40 days of prayer praise the lord are
[47:21] you ready for this
[47:23] you believe it's going to be a blessing
[47:25] i believe it's going to be a real
[47:28] blessing
[47:29] as the lord will give
[47:31] our brother or brothers wisdom
[47:34] in how to bring this forth of course we
[47:37] know the format there's a lot of people
[47:39] in this matches are so idiotic
[47:43] i'm sorry i've used a word like that but
[47:46] um
[47:47] it's just
[47:48] they think that
[47:50] all
[47:51] this person did that they are in a
[47:53] denomination so i can't use that this
[47:55] but
[47:56] brother branham gathered up the lost
[47:58] things
[48:00] and as i'm standing here i'm telling you
[48:02] i find many places
[48:05] in various persons dr ironside this one
[48:08] that one in different denominations some
[48:11] didn't believe in no denomination
[48:14] and he gathered up whatever he extract
[48:17] what was the truth
[48:21] and then he took it all together
[48:24] amen i find where he could i can tell
[48:27] where he found uh uh
[48:30] what's the script there they crucified
[48:32] him
[48:34] that was that was men wise men
[48:38] holy man anointed by god had some of
[48:41] those stuff already
[48:43] but the way he brought it with the
[48:45] revelation on it they didn't get there
[48:47] but they got the thought
[48:49] and it just laid there for years waiting
[48:52] for prophet to come were there things
[48:54] laying out there for us
[48:57] right
[48:58] and god used these people
[49:01] in many ways to to present these things
[49:05] and so uh god bless blessed to your
[49:10] hearts as we applied from the point of
[49:13] view of the message of the sow
[49:16] right
[49:18] representing it from the point of view
[49:20] of the message of this hour
[49:23] amen anything that is a a
[49:26] pit or a stone or something else that's
[49:30] going to be spot out like brother
[49:32] brandon said you eat the cherry but what
[49:34] you're worried about that stuff you got
[49:36] discernment now to be able to
[49:38] discern the stuff so what you're
[49:40] worrying about
[49:42] hey man you know you know what to spit
[49:44] out my butt bones to throw aside and
[49:47] what to eat so

[49:53] something is wrong with you
[49:56] you know praise god so the hour is here
[49:59] upon us

[50:58] but
[50:59] there is a separation
[51:01] and when that separation comes
[51:04] we feel it in our hearts
[51:06] but one day
[51:07] there will be no more sea
[51:10] no more separations
[51:13] anymore but will be together again as
[51:16] one in christ
[51:18] amen praise the lord the love of god
[51:22] fills our hearts
[51:24] and the love of god reaches out to all
[51:28] wherever they are
[51:29] that are in that kind of tragedy at this
[51:33] particular time we know brother coffee
[51:36] is over there at his mom's funeral
[51:39] as they are laying her to rest may god
[51:42] be with him sister mary bring them back
[51:45] safely
[51:46] under the grace of god
[51:48] hallelujah and the the
[51:52] preacher
[51:53] whose church i preached in washington dc
[51:58] just so happens he sent a message
[52:01] and giving greetings and everything else
[52:04] and he will be listening
[52:06] to the broadcast
[52:08] now that he knows it's on youtube
[52:11] because he is now the assistant to the
[52:14] vice president
[52:15] of the nation there
[52:17] and he remembers very much
[52:20] and he's just saying
[52:22] you know he wants the truth and he's a
[52:24] believer the message anyway so he will
[52:26] be listening to this uh this broadcast
[52:30] so may god bless you friends and we
[52:33] thank the lord for his goodness and his
[52:35] grace
[52:36] because it's growing
[52:38] it's a blessing
[52:40] some of these sermons
[52:42] that go out when i started you would
[52:45] have maybe the views of the congregation
[52:47] but now sometimes one hour after i'm
[52:50] done there's over 800 on something
[52:53] people that have watched or listened in
[52:55] some way or the other so if it's just
[53:00] that the lightest god is spreading out
[53:02] there
[53:03] and the hunger of believers who are not
[53:06] hearing the fullness of the word or the
[53:09] truth as they should receive it
[53:11] uh they are tuning in and let's trust
[53:15] god that he will continue to bless them

[56:12] for an entire year
[56:14] here going all the time by the grace of

[56:28] here for a while of course if i'm needed
[56:31] i'm you know i'll be right there but we

[56:35] opportunity so um
[56:38] i don't know what my wife and i are
[56:40] going to do but we're going to take a
[56:42] little pause and let the holy spirit
[56:44] refresh and refill so that i can be a
[56:47] blessing to you
[56:55] now today we have a marv marvelous and
[56:57] wonderful subject
[56:59] and
[57:01] i must say i was preparing something
[57:03] completely different
[57:05] and while i was preparing that
[57:09] i had to put it aside
[57:11] because
[57:12] three words just kept coming and so what
[57:16] is this what is this
[57:18] and
[57:19] i just then went
[57:21] to the bible the scriptures and then i
[57:23] went to the message and then
[57:26] i really realized
[57:29] what it is of course i knew what it is
[57:31] but
[57:32] not in not to take it and expand on it
[57:35] and i want to thank the lord for that
[57:37] because the message comes directly
[57:41] from the lord
[57:42] hallelujah so i want you to know that
[57:44] right
[57:45] praise the lord all right let's turn to
[57:48] our scriptures
[57:50] and that is found in matthew 25 1 to 13
[57:54] and that is about the 10 virgins
[57:57] after
[57:58] which we will read from revelation 3 7.
[58:04] okay
[58:07] then shall the kingdom of heaven
[58:10] be likened onto ten virgins
[58:14] which took their lamps
[58:17] and went forth to meet the bridegroom
[58:21] five of them were wise
[58:24] and five
[58:26] were foolish
[58:28] they that were wise
[58:31] took their lamps and took no oil with
[58:34] them but the wise
[58:37] took oil in their vessels with their
[58:39] lamps
[58:41] while the bright room carried
[58:44] they slumbered
[58:46] and slept
[58:48] and at midnight
[58:50] a cry a shout
[58:52] was made
[58:54] behold the bridegroom cometh going out
[58:57] to meet him
[58:59] then all
[59:00] those virgins arose and trim their lamps
[59:04] and the foolish said unto the wise
[59:07] give us of your oil
[59:09] for our lamps are gone out
[59:12] but the wise answered saying not so
[59:16] lest there be not enough for us and you
[59:19] praise the lord hallelujah amen
[59:23] now i i i don't want to break in on this
[59:26] but you see there's a little thing there
[59:28] about given
[59:29] where god is showing you yes give all
[59:32] you can but don't give to the point
[59:35] where you're endangering
[59:37] your own survival
[59:40] you see it there
[59:41] you see where it's right there
[59:44] not so
[59:45] right
[59:47] because there is not enough now
[59:50] for us and you
[59:52] you should have been gathering those
[59:53] times but now you didn't
[59:58] and the wise said not so lest there be
[1:00:01] not enough for us
[1:00:04] and you
[1:00:05] see they're willing to share but there
[1:00:08] wasn't enough now
[1:00:10] but goyi rather to them that sell and
[1:00:12] buy for yourselves
[1:00:14] and while they went to buy the
[1:00:17] bridegroom came
[1:00:18] and they that were ready
[1:00:21] went in
[1:00:24] with him
[1:00:25] to the
[1:00:26] marriage and their door
[1:00:30] was shot
[1:00:32] hallelujah
[1:00:34] afterwards came also other virgins
[1:00:36] saying
[1:00:37] lord lord open to us
[1:00:40] but he answered and said
[1:00:42] verily i say unto you
[1:00:45] i know you
[1:00:46] not
[1:00:49] speaking on the church ages i explained
[1:00:51] that already
[1:00:53] right the virgins
[1:00:55] they will be in the second resurrection
[1:00:57] but you were not for known
[1:01:00] to be in the bride
[1:01:03] i i don't know you
[1:01:06] watch therefore
[1:01:08] for ye know neither the day nor the hour
[1:01:11] when the son of man
[1:01:13] cometh
[1:01:15] okay
[1:01:16] revelation 3

[1:02:42] i have set the open door
[1:02:45] i have set the open door and i have the
[1:02:49] keys
[1:02:51] i am the only one that can open it
[1:02:56] in other words
[1:02:58] i am the only one that can reveal it
[1:03:04] for i
[1:03:05] have the keys
[1:03:08] no man can come to me
[1:03:11] except my father draws him
[1:03:14] and all that the father has given me
[1:03:17] shall come to me
[1:03:19] amen praise god no church
[1:03:24] no organization
[1:03:26] no

[1:03:30] none
[1:03:31] can open
[1:03:33] none
[1:03:34] can shut you out
[1:03:36] only jesus christ
[1:03:39] for he alone
[1:03:41] holds the key
[1:03:42] he is the only one that can
[1:03:46] hold what
[1:03:47] the keys of david
[1:03:50] amen
[1:03:51] see
[1:03:52] for he
[1:03:54] is
[1:03:55] the one that will sit on the throne of
[1:03:58] david
[1:03:59] david
[1:04:01] oh no wonder he said i have the keys of
[1:04:04] david i'll open this door and nobody can
[1:04:07] shut it when i open it aren't you happy
[1:04:11] amen and nobody can shut it see
[1:04:15] oh my
[1:04:16] you see
[1:04:17] what is he speaking of anointed once at
[1:04:20] the end time he that abideth in me
[1:04:24] in other words he opens to him
[1:04:27] that was in my root
[1:04:30] at the beginning
[1:04:32] that's the reason jesus is brought root
[1:04:37] and offspring of david
[1:04:40] for he is
[1:04:42] before david
[1:04:45] he was in david
[1:04:47] and he is after david
[1:04:50] he has bought the root and the offspring
[1:04:53] of david
[1:04:54] brought the root and the fruit
[1:04:57] rose of sharon
[1:05:00] morning star
[1:05:02] lily of the valley
[1:05:03] alpha and omega father son holy ghost
[1:05:08] amen he is the fullness
[1:05:11] of the godhead now bodily amen praise
[1:05:15] god amen so what he is saying
[1:05:19] he that is of my elected life
[1:05:25] the
[1:05:26] predestinated life that is in me
[1:05:30] amen
[1:05:32] that he is the word
[1:05:35] from the beginning
[1:05:37] when he comes forth
[1:05:39] then he or she will bear my fruits
[1:05:44] but then others
[1:05:47] will live by the same thing same message
[1:05:52] same word amen
[1:05:54] and they will even call themselves
[1:05:57] christians
[1:05:58] and even
[1:06:00] that they are
[1:06:01] believers
[1:06:03] but remember not all them that say it
[1:06:07] unto me
[1:06:08] lord lord will enter him
[1:06:11] not all that come in the message and say
[1:06:13] their believers are going to enter in
[1:06:15] let's start facing the facts
[1:06:17] this is my election
[1:06:20] this is not by my being the pastor i'm
[1:06:22] sympathetic with with sister so and so
[1:06:25] so i'm going to pray and ask the lord to
[1:06:27] give her a pass
[1:06:29] that she might go in it doesn't work
[1:06:31] that way
[1:06:32] no it's come down to the individual now
[1:06:36] it's not group no more it's individual
[1:06:39] god is dealing with amen hallelujah
[1:06:43] now
[1:06:44] this that i'm speaking of
[1:06:47] is to take place
[1:06:49] and to be
[1:06:51] manifested in the last days
[1:06:54] now he's talking prophecy here now
[1:06:57] he's saying this what i'm talking about
[1:06:59] this
[1:07:00] is going to be manifested
[1:07:03] in the last days at the time when the
[1:07:06] mystery of god
[1:07:08] should be finished
[1:07:10] right when the mystery is being made
[1:07:13] known and finished
[1:07:15] to those people those elected that come
[1:07:18] from his roots
[1:07:20] amen praise god
[1:07:22] that time when that happens it will be
[1:07:25] made manifested in the last days oh
[1:07:30] praise god aren't you happy amen
[1:07:33] i trust you can you can see that by him
[1:07:36] opening up the word of god of course i'm
[1:07:39] speaking about the key of the house of
[1:07:41] david
[1:07:42] hallelujah think about it right amen
[1:07:46] your god you must they never use the
[1:07:50] right key because back then he said even
[1:07:54] david
[1:07:56] having an anointing on him
[1:07:59] having a desire for god
[1:08:02] but not taking the run of the scriptures
[1:08:07] nor having the key
[1:08:09] listen the key of revelation
[1:08:13] amen
[1:08:15] all of them were anointed too along with
[1:08:18] him
[1:08:19] and they were doing a good thing
[1:08:22] shouting together praising god for a
[1:08:26] wonderful thing amen praise god and it
[1:08:30] looked exactly right it looked like they
[1:08:33] were bringing back the word see
[1:08:37] oh back to the house of god
[1:08:40] but you see
[1:08:41] god dishonored the whole thing with all
[1:08:44] the shouting all the praising all that
[1:08:48] god disordered the whole move because
[1:08:51] they never used the right key to begin
[1:08:54] with david included
[1:08:56] they didn't use the right key
[1:08:58] to get in to the door
[1:09:01] amen
[1:09:02] the door just did not unlock at that
[1:09:05] time
[1:09:07] because it was not the right key he says
[1:09:10] now
[1:09:11] remember that what i say and keep that
[1:09:14] in mind
[1:09:16] are you going to remember this
[1:09:18] are you going to keep this in mind
[1:09:20] he's speaking about the key
[1:09:22] of the house of david
[1:09:25] and i'm not talking about the gold key
[1:09:28] or brass key or whatever key he used on
[1:09:31] his palace
[1:09:33] but that was only a symbol or a type
[1:09:37] to the key of revelation
[1:09:40] that opens the door to the word of god
[1:09:43] the power of the holy spirit prophecy
[1:09:47] all these major things in the bible it
[1:09:50] opens up the entire world when you have
[1:09:52] caught the genuine spirit of revelation
[1:09:57] hallelujah and this is what god wants me
[1:10:00] to tell you
[1:10:01] amen because i didn't plan to speak on
[1:10:04] this
[1:10:05] i had my my own thought but then all of
[1:10:08] a suds key of david
[1:10:10] the key of david
[1:10:13] why is that bothering me so of course i
[1:10:15] went and started to
[1:10:17] pray and search the word praise the name
[1:10:20] of the lord amen hallelujah think of it
[1:10:24] now that key
[1:10:27] think of it the key of david he
[1:10:31] the one that has the key of david
[1:10:35] remember this remember it
[1:10:37] he
[1:10:38] that is true
[1:10:40] it brings him to him
[1:10:42] christ the perfect realization
[1:10:47] amen
[1:10:48] contrast that
[1:10:50] with them with partial realization here
[1:10:54] it is
[1:10:55] moses was a prophet of god
[1:10:57] like unto uh you see there he was now
[1:11:01] what he's trying to say here i won't go
[1:11:03] over all that but that you had all these
[1:11:05] prophets prophets and god use prophets
[1:11:07] but it's not the prophets it's when
[1:11:10] jesus himself come on the scene who is
[1:11:12] the god of the prophets
[1:11:14] and he wants you to recognize this that
[1:11:17] you had messengers and messengers and
[1:11:20] the last messenger was a prophet like
[1:11:22] unto moses but thank god the word
[1:11:26] himself is on the scene revealing
[1:11:30] himself for christ
[1:11:32] is the mystery of god
[1:11:35] being revealed amen
[1:11:37] christ himself
[1:11:39] being revealed hallelujah praise god
[1:11:43] amen amen think of it
[1:11:47] my friends key of the house of david
[1:11:51] isaiah 22 22
[1:11:54] he says remember
[1:11:56] it tells us
[1:11:58] that the key
[1:11:59] in the house of david
[1:12:01] would lay upon his shoulder
[1:12:05] and so he shall open
[1:12:07] and none shall shut
[1:12:09] and he shall shut
[1:12:11] and none shall open it doesn't matter
[1:12:14] who hold triple keys in front of them
[1:12:18] and it looks so impressive and symbolic
[1:12:21] it doesn't matter how many millions
[1:12:24] believe that somebody can shut you out
[1:12:27] of heaven
[1:12:28] or cast you down to hell
[1:12:31] jesus is saying no man no bishop no
[1:12:35] superintendent
[1:12:36] no pope no pastor nobody can shut you in
[1:12:40] or shut you out i am the only one that
[1:12:43] can do that for i hold the key of david
[1:12:47] in my hands
[1:12:49] amen
[1:12:50] i open and no man shut your
[1:12:53] understanding anymore
[1:12:55] i open and no man can blind you anymore
[1:13:00] when i shut your understanding none can
[1:13:03] open it they can't do it it's impossible
[1:13:06] for them to do it
[1:13:08] hallelujah
[1:13:09] now the spirit
[1:13:11] uses this old testament reference
[1:13:14] concerning jesus christ
[1:13:17] amen and his ministry in the church he's
[1:13:21] saying what talking about the key on the
[1:13:23] shoulder of dave of of of his servant uh
[1:13:27] how that that is a symbol or type or
[1:13:30] prophecy of jesus christ and his
[1:13:33] ministry within the church
[1:13:36] now you see what the key of david
[1:13:39] quoting him
[1:13:41] signified at that time
[1:13:44] was just a mere shadow
[1:13:47] of what it is now
[1:13:50] right
[1:13:51] for it is fulfilled in jesus christ
[1:13:54] standing in the midst of the lampstands
[1:13:58] it has to do with our lord
[1:14:01] after his resurrection
[1:14:04] oh my you see a lot of people say oh i
[1:14:07] know jesus oh i met jesus i know i met
[1:14:11] the lord i had an experience and so on
[1:14:13] so dave that's fine a lot of people met
[1:14:17] him in his form of his word form when he
[1:14:21] was here on earth brother branham putin
[1:14:23] he said some were so close they act with
[1:14:26] him they fished with him they slept with
[1:14:29] him every day he said but they still
[1:14:33] didn't know him didn't have a revelation
[1:14:35] yet of who he was
[1:14:37] amen praise god see
[1:14:40] but my he says but this has to do not
[1:14:45] with him before his resurrection
[1:14:48] but after his resurrection
[1:14:51] praise god years ago and i remember
[1:14:54] brother a brother by the name of brother
[1:14:56] robinson wherever he is now i don't know
[1:14:59] but he preached a message yes you say
[1:15:01] you met him but have you met him since
[1:15:04] he's risen
[1:15:06] have you met him since he's changed his
[1:15:09] form
[1:15:10] has you met him in his glorified fashion
[1:15:14] amen and that's the question with a lot
[1:15:16] of people you know i know the word i
[1:15:18] know the bible i know this i know that
[1:15:21] but have you met him hallelujah
[1:15:25] and when he was resurrected you couldn't
[1:15:27] just go and meet him he came and
[1:15:30] appeared wherever he wanted to appear
[1:15:33] he appeared to who he wants to appeal to
[1:15:36] he just come and make himself known
[1:15:39] display himself peace be unto you glory
[1:15:42] to god hallelujah it's the same thing
[1:15:45] now
[1:15:47] what is supernatural form
[1:15:50] amen think about it
[1:15:53] after his resurrection
[1:15:55] not during his earthly pilgrimage
[1:15:58] see
[1:16:00] but what does the key signify
[1:16:03] the answer lies in the position
[1:16:06] of the key
[1:16:08] the key is not in his hands
[1:16:12] it is not worn around his neck
[1:16:17] it is not placed into the hands of other
[1:16:22] men
[1:16:24] amen for he said
[1:16:27] he alone has the use of that key
[1:16:31] for he alone opens and shots
[1:16:35] and no man
[1:16:37] no matter who he is
[1:16:39] has the right
[1:16:40] to that key
[1:16:42] but jesus
[1:16:44] himself
[1:16:46] right
[1:16:47] but where is the key
[1:16:49] it is on his shoulder
[1:16:52] what does this shock what does he do
[1:16:54] with it on his shoulder
[1:16:56] isaiah 9 6
[1:16:58] and the government
[1:17:00] shall be
[1:17:01] upon his shoulder
[1:17:04] what government
[1:17:06] upon his shoulder now here comes
[1:17:09] this this view from the wedding ceremony
[1:17:14] of the east you see how everything is
[1:17:16] coming now into focus
[1:17:18] you see how the holy spirit is bringing
[1:17:20] everything for us to really
[1:17:22] understanding if we're elected to him
[1:17:25] he's gone from the key on the shoulder
[1:17:27] to our wedding right now let's see the
[1:17:30] connection
[1:17:31] now
[1:17:32] comes the wedding ceremony of the east
[1:17:35] when the bride has been committed to the
[1:17:37] groom
[1:17:39] she takes off her veil
[1:17:42] and she
[1:17:43] places it over the groom's shoulders
[1:17:48] signifying
[1:17:49] that she is now under
[1:17:51] his leadership
[1:17:54] she has transformed her rights
[1:17:59] to him
[1:18:00] and he is now
[1:18:02] her head
[1:18:04] see
[1:18:04] but also that he has responsibility
[1:18:10] for her care
[1:18:12] amen
[1:18:13] and that he and he alone no one else
[1:18:17] no other man
[1:18:19] no other power
[1:18:21] has any right or responsibility
[1:18:24] or
[1:18:25] beloved the key of david god is
[1:18:30] sovereign hallelujah
[1:18:32] by divine decree he knew who would be in
[1:18:35] his bride
[1:18:38] and he chose her
[1:18:40] she did not choose him
[1:18:43] he called her
[1:18:46] she did not call him
[1:18:48] but she came on her own
[1:18:51] he died for her he washed her in his own
[1:18:54] blood he paid the price for her she
[1:18:57] belongs to him
[1:18:59] and him alone
[1:19:00] she is only committed to him
[1:19:03] and he accepts
[1:19:05] the obligation
[1:19:07] he is her head for christ is the head of
[1:19:11] the church
[1:19:13] praise the lord now
[1:19:16] listen carefully here
[1:19:18] for he just says it and the rest is
[1:19:21] unwritten
[1:19:22] so believe me listen
[1:19:24] she lays
[1:19:26] her veil on his shoulders
[1:19:29] right
[1:19:30] for the government
[1:19:32] is upon his shoulder
[1:19:34] but in isaiah we read
[1:19:36] that the key was on his shoulders
[1:19:40] but then what really happened is this
[1:19:43] because you know brothers have come and
[1:19:44] said we have no choice
[1:19:46] because he chose you from before the
[1:19:48] foundation of the world
[1:19:50] and if the spirit doesn't guide you you
[1:19:52] would think that they're right even with
[1:19:54] reading this you didn't choose him he
[1:19:56] chose you
[1:19:57] right
[1:19:58] but he still as i've taught before had
[1:20:01] to come to you and give you the
[1:20:03] opportunity to accept him
[1:20:06] accept his choice
[1:20:08] see arrest we wouldn't be given
[1:20:11] um what's the word
[1:20:13] a free moral agency
[1:20:16] god didn't want robots
[1:20:19] program somebody to love him
[1:20:22] he want them to do it out of their own
[1:20:24] heart
[1:20:25] so there had to be an acceptance of his
[1:20:28] choice
[1:20:30] is that right
[1:20:31] okay so to accept his choice she takes
[1:20:36] her
[1:20:36] veil that she had
[1:20:39] amen remember the word the veil before
[1:20:42] her face the foil that was over her eyes
[1:20:45] she took it off and placed it on his
[1:20:47] shoulders
[1:20:49] my
[1:20:51] she letting him see her
[1:20:53] in her fullness of our beauty
[1:20:56] is that right
[1:20:57] her eyes are now open
[1:21:00] the veil that she had
[1:21:02] when she looked tried to look through it
[1:21:03] at the word she couldn't see as clearly
[1:21:05] now as she as she can see now
[1:21:08] because she take off the veil
[1:21:11] you gotta accept revelation in other
[1:21:13] words you can't drive it away and say no
[1:21:15] that can't be god that
[1:21:17] i didn't read that in the bible so
[1:21:18] that's not
[1:21:20] i didn't read the prophet quote that so
[1:21:22] where does he get that from where did
[1:21:24] that come from see
[1:21:25] then you have a problem you don't have
[1:21:29] faith
[1:21:31] amen you don't recognize him when he's
[1:21:34] speaking
[1:21:36] right you recognize everybody else but
[1:21:37] you don't recognize his voice
[1:21:40] oh my but remember
[1:21:43] she throw the veil on her on his
[1:21:46] shoulders showing that she accepts his
[1:21:49] choice
[1:21:51] but what is not written there
[1:21:53] is that he turns her wrong and gives her
[1:21:56] the keys that he had with the key that
[1:21:58] he had on his shoulder the key of
[1:22:00] revelation
[1:22:01] because he now gives her the key
[1:22:04] amen
[1:22:05] because she is his queen
[1:22:08] and every wife is a queen
[1:22:11] in her house and to her husband
[1:22:14] and as a result of that he takes the key
[1:22:17] of his whole house and give her the key
[1:22:20] you got the key to my whole house now
[1:22:24] you're in control
[1:22:26] i open up the door of the world to you
[1:22:28] by revelation
[1:22:30] and you got the key to the door you let
[1:22:33] the key to all of the world you may not
[1:22:36] understand what is in every room but
[1:22:38] year after year month after month as you
[1:22:40] go through the house you're going to
[1:22:42] find out what i got stored up in there
[1:22:45] oh praise god hallelujah i'm so happy
[1:22:49] for the key of the house of david
[1:22:53] it was on his shoulder but now it's in
[1:22:55] my hand
[1:22:56] lord of god hallelujah remember the key
[1:23:00] of the house of david
[1:23:02] is the master key
[1:23:05] it's the master's key
[1:23:08] and he gives her the master key to every
[1:23:11] revelation every prophecy every thing
[1:23:14] hid in the word she gives her the master
[1:23:17] key brother
[1:23:18] oh blessed be the name of the living god
[1:23:21] hallelujah
[1:23:23] but back then
[1:23:25] men didn't used to store sheep
[1:23:28] and cow
[1:23:29] and wheat and corn and and
[1:23:32] goods and food stuff in their house
[1:23:36] they they had to have a big huge
[1:23:39] storehouse
[1:23:40] and in that storehouse they would store
[1:23:43] up everything they need within that
[1:23:47] storehouse
[1:23:48] so when he gave her that key it was not
[1:23:51] just a key for the house
[1:23:53] but the a key for the storehouse
[1:23:56] hallelujah that she can take out any
[1:23:59] goodies that she wants in that
[1:24:02] storehouse and make up a good meal with
[1:24:05] it and rejoice hallelujah christ be to
[1:24:08] god i'm happy that we have the key to
[1:24:11] god's storehouse
[1:24:13] i'm glad he sent a prophet that left the
[1:24:16] storehouse
[1:24:18] and i'm glad the storehouse is filled
[1:24:21] with a lot of good things green stuff
[1:24:24] apples beautiful stuff that's all inside
[1:24:27] of the storehouse but you've got to have
[1:24:29] the key before you can go in the
[1:24:31] schoolhouse
[1:24:33] hallelujah and the key that was on his
[1:24:36] shoulders that key goes to his bride
[1:24:39] it goes to the queen it goes to his wife
[1:24:42] she can now open the front door and go
[1:24:44] out and come in where they shall go out
[1:24:46] of the prophecy said and come in
[1:24:48] whenever they like because they have the
[1:24:50] key amen that they can go out and come
[1:24:53] in whenever they want hallelujah praise
[1:24:57] god hallelujah
[1:24:58] now remember
[1:25:00] in
[1:25:02] how in the key to the door
[1:25:04] philadelphia church age message of grace
[1:25:07] anointed once at the end time paragraph
[1:25:09] 22
[1:25:10] now remember
[1:25:12] how that an angel
[1:25:15] in revelation
[1:25:18] he said it's 13 or 19
[1:25:20] and uh
[1:25:21] see
[1:25:22] coming with a great key within his hand
[1:25:28] notice
[1:25:30] the purpose of a key
[1:25:32] is always to unlock something
[1:25:36] to open up something
[1:25:38] that's been locked up for years
[1:25:41] oh thank god the secret hit for ages and
[1:25:45] generations things the angels desire to
[1:25:49] look into and now here comes an angel
[1:25:52] from heaven with a great key that can
[1:25:55] unlock every door and open everything
[1:25:57] for the glory of god
[1:26:02] hallelujah
[1:26:04] but one foot on time and one on eternity
[1:26:07] and said time shall be no more your
[1:26:10] changes are over back to the lord back
[1:26:13] to christ go back where you come from
[1:26:16] amen
[1:26:17] glory to his marvelous wonderful name
[1:26:20] think about that a key
[1:26:23] is always given with a purpose
[1:26:27] amen
[1:26:28] not all it is should it lock
[1:26:31] something that is locked up can be
[1:26:34] unlocked
[1:26:35] but it can also lock up something if it
[1:26:39] wants to
[1:26:40] amen now i wouldn't pause here but let
[1:26:42] me just throw this out there's the
[1:26:45] church having the power of binding and
[1:26:47] losing
[1:26:49] and a key is given
[1:26:52] amen now she just got the key but now
[1:26:55] he's talking now about why a key is
[1:26:57] given
[1:26:58] is given with a purpose
[1:27:00] now remember there are many kinds of
[1:27:02] keys how many knows that some of us
[1:27:04] right now maybe have a bunch of keys
[1:27:08] right
[1:27:09] anybody here have a bunch of keys take
[1:27:11] it out let me see right praise god
[1:27:14] praise the lord hallelujah amen i'd like
[1:27:17] to take it out for my own inspiration
[1:27:23] because we have many uses for kids
[1:27:26] right
[1:27:27] you're always locking up things at the
[1:27:29] end of this he says why would you need a
[1:27:32] key if something isn't worthwhile
[1:27:35] if something is worthwhile or valuable
[1:27:38] that's when you lock it up
[1:27:40] right and then you go back and you
[1:27:41] unlock it when you need it
[1:27:43] right praise god you don't take your
[1:27:46] money and put it on a cart by the
[1:27:49] way side
[1:27:51] no you take it home lock it in the safe
[1:27:54] or put it in the bank or something right
[1:27:56] and then when you're ready to use you
[1:27:58] unlock it because now you're ready to
[1:28:01] use it and he puts that key in the hand
[1:28:03] of his queen his bride to lock and
[1:28:06] unlock whenever she wants to lock and
[1:28:09] unlock thanks me to god the word is now
[1:28:12] with in the bride and she knows what to
[1:28:15] do with the word
[1:28:16] she knows what to do with it amen
[1:28:19] hallelujah think of it now remember
[1:28:22] there are many kinds of keys
[1:28:25] and many uses
[1:28:27] of keys
[1:28:29] he says now remember
[1:28:31] he says remember this
[1:28:34] there is keys
[1:28:37] that you must use for this storehouse
[1:28:43] and there is keys
[1:28:45] that you must use to go home to your own
[1:28:49] house
[1:28:51] right
[1:28:53] and there's a key
[1:28:57] for transportation
[1:29:00] he says buy an automobile
[1:29:03] my goodness a key for the storehouse
[1:29:07] a key for your own house and the key for
[1:29:10] your transportation
[1:29:12] he's talking about revelation here
[1:29:14] you've got to have a revelation of how
[1:29:16] to go in that storehouse
[1:29:19] amen not anybody can walk in the
[1:29:21] storehouse
[1:29:22] is that right and to get back to heaven
[1:29:25] in the rapture you've got to have a
[1:29:27] rapture revelation to be able to go into
[1:29:30] your own house
[1:29:32] is that right and for the transportation
[1:29:35] to get to go there you better have a
[1:29:37] revelation
[1:29:39] to be able to be transported back where
[1:29:41] you come from hallelujah so that's
[1:29:44] useless for keys
[1:29:46] and there's a use for this key of the
[1:29:48] house of david
[1:29:50] oh blessed be the name of the lord think
[1:29:52] of it he says but watch it now be
[1:29:55] careful
[1:29:57] because there are them who have keys
[1:30:00] also
[1:30:03] that can be
[1:30:04] made and what
[1:30:07] we will call a skeleton key
[1:30:12] that word skeleton
[1:30:14] my
[1:30:15] see
[1:30:17] no it's not the real key
[1:30:19] it's a skeleton key
[1:30:22] now he's talking about satan now he's
[1:30:23] going to copy the word
[1:30:25] i'm going to presume he's going to try
[1:30:27] all kinds of stuff to be able to get in
[1:30:29] the storehouse to get into heaven to get
[1:30:31] in the wedding supper without the robe
[1:30:33] right robe and so on he's alluding to
[1:30:36] all these things while he's talking amen
[1:30:40] how you know that well he didn't say it
[1:30:42] in the word but i know that
[1:30:45] amen but watch here
[1:30:48] think of it
[1:30:50] they can be duplicated
[1:30:53] what we call the skeleton key
[1:30:56] it's a key that's made with levers
[1:31:00] act on it and a key that has
[1:31:04] a lot of twists
[1:31:07] in it
[1:31:10] a skeleton key it's always twisting the
[1:31:12] word telling you they got the key to the
[1:31:14] word and the key to the word but they
[1:31:16] got to twist it
[1:31:18] right they gotta they always twist in
[1:31:20] the word put a twist on the word but
[1:31:22] we're not here to twist in the word
[1:31:24] since we put the key the lock opens the
[1:31:26] lord of god because we have the real key
[1:31:28] of god the key to the house of david
[1:31:32] spiritual house of david
[1:31:34] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:31:36] hallelujah
[1:31:38] see
[1:31:39] it's just a frame
[1:31:41] amen
[1:31:42] they tried to say it can unlock any door
[1:31:46] in other words it's in opposition to the
[1:31:48] real key tell you they can open any door
[1:31:51] you say you lock it and you you you're
[1:31:53] the only one can shut it and open it
[1:31:55] well i got a skeleton key here it can
[1:31:57] open up any door right
[1:31:59] see
[1:32:01] it can only open but almost any door
[1:32:06] call the skeleton key it's just a frame
[1:32:10] it can be unlocked that way
[1:32:12] they can use it just on houses
[1:32:14] automobiles things like that can be
[1:32:16] duplicated amen
[1:32:19] but you see friends
[1:32:21] let's get down to it a key cannot open
[1:32:25] anything unless it's used by a hand
[1:32:29] it's got to be placed in somebody's hand
[1:32:32] for them to use
[1:32:34] and then they can use the key are you
[1:32:35] following me here
[1:32:37] praise god
[1:32:38] are you really quiet today we praise god
[1:32:41] but i can sense that quietness is not
[1:32:44] the normal quietness of disinterest but
[1:32:47] of real interest
[1:32:48] amen praise god
[1:32:51] but the key is of no use until it gets
[1:32:54] in somebody's hand i'm so glad you got
[1:32:56] it in your hand
[1:32:58] you got the power in the name of jesus
[1:33:01] it's in your hand brother sister the
[1:33:04] revelation of the word you didn't claim
[1:33:07] it but it struck you by the grace of god
[1:33:10] and you are here by the grace of god
[1:33:12] hallelujah and he has made known himself
[1:33:15] to you amen
[1:33:16] to you it looks so easy
[1:33:19] but to them trying to get in there it's
[1:33:21] a lot of work
[1:33:23] we got to study all night i studied for
[1:33:26] 40 years you know 30 years i've been in
[1:33:28] this message brother brother glenn oh my
[1:33:32] god oh my praise god amen hallelujah and
[1:33:35] they're boasting and talking about all
[1:33:37] the sins that don't mean nothing to god
[1:33:41] because he set it up in such a way
[1:33:43] that the person can come in at the last
[1:33:46] hour
[1:33:48] last our workers and he decided to pay
[1:33:51] them the same pay like you getting
[1:33:54] what are you going to do about it glory
[1:33:56] be to god hallelujah
[1:33:59] amen
[1:34:00] revelation can strike anyone and right
[1:34:03] where we are we're waiting for that last
[1:34:05] one to come in
[1:34:07] we're waiting for the last worker we're
[1:34:09] working for the last sea we're waiting
[1:34:11] for it to come by the opening of the
[1:34:13] word of god
[1:34:15] hallelujah amen yes sir think of it you
[1:34:20] got to have a key and the key cannot use
[1:34:22] its own self
[1:34:24] it's got to have something in her hand
[1:34:28] he says now just like a microphone
[1:34:32] he says the microphone is here
[1:34:34] he says but the microphone cannot speak
[1:34:37] of itself
[1:34:39] it can't do it
[1:34:41] if it's speaking
[1:34:42] it's got to be somebody or something
[1:34:45] speaking through it
[1:34:47] it's just a microphone
[1:34:50] it's the voice
[1:34:52] that's behind that microphone that is
[1:34:55] transmitting an airwave
[1:34:58] that you can hear
[1:35:01] now that's the way it is
[1:35:03] we ourselves as ministers we are not the
[1:35:07] gospel
[1:35:08] hallelujah we are not him
[1:35:12] right
[1:35:13] we are only
[1:35:14] transmitters
[1:35:17] that transmit the voice of god
[1:35:21] amen through our agency
[1:35:24] of man
[1:35:26] and being men humans to the hearers
[1:35:30] they're able to hear the wave the sound
[1:35:33] but it is not the microphone it's the
[1:35:37] voice behind the microphone i usually
[1:35:40] say listen for the voice behind the
[1:35:43] voice
[1:35:44] amen that's what you must listen for see
[1:35:48] if so that's the way it is praise the
[1:35:51] lord praise god the hand unlocks the the
[1:35:56] door with the key so it's got to be in
[1:36:00] hand and the only hand that will be
[1:36:03] allowed to hold this key is the hand of
[1:36:07] faith
[1:36:09] faith is a what
[1:36:12] that's the only hand that can hold this
[1:36:15] you got one tiny inkling and then it
[1:36:18] takes you to the bigger thing and it
[1:36:20] unlocks the whole thing before you
[1:36:23] it's got to be in the hand
[1:36:25] now think of it
[1:36:27] many will take another key the key to
[1:36:30] knowledge
[1:36:32] they want to go in the door too
[1:36:34] so they take the key of knowledge
[1:36:37] and then man
[1:36:39] what do they do
[1:36:40] trying to accumulate
[1:36:43] knowledge
[1:36:45] they think by getting all accumulation
[1:36:48] of human knowledge they're gonna find
[1:36:51] out the truth they're gonna find out the
[1:36:52] secret they're gonna find out the
[1:36:54] mystery they're gonna break into the
[1:36:56] half hour silence by study they're gonna
[1:36:59] do it they're gonna accumulate by
[1:37:01] knowledge see you say there's the key
[1:37:04] see they're trying to use that key of
[1:37:07] knowledge hallelujah he'll go there and
[1:37:10] he'll get himself lots of books get
[1:37:13] himself learning but he cannot
[1:37:16] for no one can learn this
[1:37:20] is that the truth
[1:37:22] no one
[1:37:23] hallelujah the only way it can be done
[1:37:27] he himself has got to catch that key
[1:37:34] that's something that something
[1:37:37] is there that will unfold or reveal to
[1:37:41] him
[1:37:42] that knowledge
[1:37:43] of what he is really seeking
[1:37:46] hallelujah oh my praise god you can't
[1:37:50] even put that to words you can see here
[1:37:52] he can't even put it to work but because
[1:37:55] you have entered in you are
[1:37:57] understanding what he's saying but you
[1:38:00] say that to somebody else they think
[1:38:01] you're going a
[1:38:03] cuckoo or something
[1:38:05] my something is going after you he says
[1:38:07] it's the same thing
[1:38:09] praise god
[1:38:11] many others
[1:38:12] will try
[1:38:14] to play a piano or to music or music
[1:38:19] they want to have the key to music
[1:38:24] you see they want to enter in because
[1:38:27] one person has to play music and if they
[1:38:30] don't have a script in front of them
[1:38:34] they're lost
[1:38:36] it's gone
[1:38:38] but there's another guy
[1:38:40] he never read one script or maybe a few
[1:38:42] scripts or little scripts
[1:38:45] but after a while he realized it's not
[1:38:48] just the script you got to go by the
[1:38:50] script but it's not really the script
[1:38:52] and then the next thing that i start to
[1:38:53] innovate and the guys start to play
[1:38:56] the next thing you know you say oh he
[1:38:58] playing my air sound
[1:39:02] he's innovating and a man like other
[1:39:04] woman the master you want to know where
[1:39:07] is he or she getting that from
[1:39:09] where is it coming from they caught the
[1:39:12] key
[1:39:14] like brother branham said that unseen
[1:39:16] unknown something that you can't learn
[1:39:20] nobody can teach it to you he said they
[1:39:23] catch that something amen and once they
[1:39:27] caught that their break into it
[1:39:29] hallelujah because it's the holy spirit
[1:39:32] of the living god moving on the soul of
[1:39:34] the individual
[1:39:36] see many tried to play piano or music
[1:39:39] hallelujah
[1:39:40] but they still don't know just how to do
[1:39:42] it amen the teacher might give them
[1:39:46] lesson after lesson after lesson
[1:39:49] and they never could learn it never
[1:39:52] catch music but they're never really
[1:39:54] catching that key that essence that
[1:39:56] takes them to another level
[1:39:59] right
[1:40:00] think of it right
[1:40:02] you see
[1:40:03] they just cannot hold that key they're
[1:40:07] trying to find the key to that mystery
[1:40:10] of rhythm and the sounds of tuning and
[1:40:14] so forth that rings out it takes a key
[1:40:19] to do that amen and that's what he's
[1:40:22] saying some try to come by knowledge
[1:40:24] some try to come by music you know we
[1:40:27] got a lot of people like that out in in
[1:40:29] the world out there and even
[1:40:31] christianity they're singing they're
[1:40:32] jumping they're doing all kinds of
[1:40:34] things they think that's gonna break
[1:40:35] them and all of a sudden there's gonna
[1:40:36] be a supernatural something
[1:40:39] no no no no no you don't get it that way
[1:40:41] hey man god
[1:40:44] reveals himself to whomever he will amen
[1:40:48] the teacher he says can you give you all
[1:40:49] the lessons you like but until you break
[1:40:53] into that unseen something amen that
[1:40:56] only god can give that's why if a man
[1:40:59] lack revelation he lacks wisdom let him
[1:41:02] ask of god
[1:41:04] who will give liberally
[1:41:07] to whomever he will
[1:41:10] he will give liberally praise god
[1:41:13] whenever you see you're an elected seed
[1:41:15] and you're asking him man praise god he
[1:41:17] makes it long praise the lord if you're
[1:41:20] not you're not
[1:41:22] i don't know i i'm not here to judge but
[1:41:24] to tell you that he says some
[1:41:26] will try to come by the way of
[1:41:28] mathematics
[1:41:33] they think if they're going to bind us
[1:41:34] in laws
[1:41:35] a thousand years like a day therefore
[1:41:37] one hour is equal to
[1:41:40] you trying to approach the word from the
[1:41:42] point of view of mathematics
[1:41:45] or you uh try to cycle through the bible
[1:41:47] using how many chapters in the bible and
[1:41:49] how many this and that and you go
[1:41:51] through the physics and the calculus of
[1:41:52] the bible trying to put it together like
[1:41:55] that in mathematics he says yes there's
[1:41:58] even a key to mathematics but
[1:42:01] that's that's just a skeleton key that's
[1:42:03] not the real key that can get you into
[1:42:06] the presence of almighty god
[1:42:08] hallelujah see what he's showing you
[1:42:10] here there's a key to the house of david
[1:42:13] but the devil has people trying to enter
[1:42:16] into the wedding supper through windows
[1:42:18] through doorways with all kinds of
[1:42:20] different robes on all kinds of things
[1:42:23] on and they're using all kind of
[1:42:25] skeleton key
[1:42:26] to defy god that you say you're the only
[1:42:29] one with the key well i got a key too
[1:42:31] and i i'm gonna get him there whether
[1:42:33] you like it or not whatever and god is
[1:42:35] saying no none can enter there
[1:42:38] none i open and when i open
[1:42:42] all i open to you and you can enter if i
[1:42:45] shut the door none can enter here
[1:42:48] oh my and that that's the greatest mad
[1:42:51] level thought continues on amen okay and
[1:42:55] then he switches to talking about how
[1:42:57] atoms and so on like that and praise god
[1:43:01] and now he says but you see
[1:43:05] when men and women have something in
[1:43:07] their hand
[1:43:08] that they know they can do
[1:43:11] then that's something amen
[1:43:14] now when polio struck the nation of
[1:43:17] course i wasn't studying for this i just
[1:43:19] going along and it comes right in with
[1:43:22] what's going on right now amen
[1:43:25] and we're all com we were all commanded
[1:43:29] to go and get the vaccine
[1:43:34] so that
[1:43:36] we can stamp it out as a nation
[1:43:41] now i was with a doctor driving along
[1:43:44] the road a doctor from louisville
[1:43:46] he said i remember when the great plague
[1:43:50] hit louisville
[1:43:52] i saw 57 respirators on them people at
[1:43:57] one time
[1:43:59] men women boys girls paralyzed with that
[1:44:02] disease that called polio
[1:44:05] there was nothing we could do about it i
[1:44:08] never want to see that again
[1:44:10] i never
[1:44:12] he said so what happened
[1:44:14] good man science begins to fight
[1:44:18] they begged on the streets
[1:44:20] they begged for money they bummed
[1:44:23] and begged
[1:44:24] done everything they could
[1:44:26] trying to find the key that will unlock
[1:44:30] that door
[1:44:31] oh my
[1:44:32] finally god raised up a christian
[1:44:35] gentleman man by the name of dr salk
[1:44:40] and he found the vaccine
[1:44:43] right so we know it's god send the
[1:44:45] vaccine
[1:44:47] right
[1:44:49] why why was that it
[1:44:51] because it was evil
[1:44:53] it was evil
[1:44:55] but in the land at stake
[1:44:57] it was a killer
[1:45:00] amen
[1:45:01] there was a key
[1:45:03] that could then unlock see
[1:45:06] and sulk
[1:45:07] vaccine
[1:45:09] was the great treatment
[1:45:12] amen
[1:45:13] oh
[1:45:14] what that key can do that vaccine was
[1:45:17] brought forth and now by the vaccine is
[1:45:20] stamping out polio
[1:45:23] with that vaccine
[1:45:25] because my friends
[1:45:28] i tell you
[1:45:29] if there ever
[1:45:31] sometime
[1:45:33] when there is an evil in the land
[1:45:36] such as polio
[1:45:39] bacteria
[1:45:40] smallpox
[1:45:42] yellow fever
[1:45:44] tetanus
[1:45:47] and so forth see evils
[1:45:51] amen
[1:45:52] science
[1:45:55] fighting day and night to find an
[1:45:59] inoculation for them and they are doing
[1:46:02] so because it's fighting evil
[1:46:07] right it's evil and it's a killer
[1:46:11] right
[1:46:12] how much more
[1:46:14] if they are seeking a vaccine for men to
[1:46:18] end
[1:46:20] that
[1:46:20] should we
[1:46:22] seek for the key to salvation for man
[1:46:26] that's in satan's prison house of sin to
[1:46:29] bring them out by unlocking the door
[1:46:32] with the key to the house of david
[1:46:35] amen
[1:46:36] god giving back to his church the power
[1:46:39] of binding and losing
[1:46:41] hallelujah the key is being in your key
[1:46:44] being in your hand that you can rebuke
[1:46:47] satan you combine satan amen you can
[1:46:50] lose a person from a certain ailment or
[1:46:53] certain thing oh praise god hallelujah
[1:46:57] and the key works when it turns the lock
[1:47:01] find the key it's got to if you find a
[1:47:04] real true key it's got to be some
[1:47:06] treasure back there
[1:47:08] amen
[1:47:10] something worthwhile or you won't even
[1:47:12] bother to lock it up see
[1:47:15] so my it unlocks something worthwhile
[1:47:18] but when you find that what happens now
[1:47:22] he's coming back to today
[1:47:24] but today in our churches you start with
[1:47:28] that in the church
[1:47:30] you know what you'll find that will
[1:47:31] happen
[1:47:32] they'll show you the door
[1:47:35] right
[1:47:36] see
[1:47:37] the very master key
[1:47:41] the thing they should have
[1:47:43] right
[1:47:45] that very master key is the thing that
[1:47:48] they left out
[1:47:51] they left the corner stone
[1:47:54] the key stone
[1:47:57] which the builders did back there
[1:48:00] amen
[1:48:02] hallelujah one great preacher by the
[1:48:04] name of parker said remember the bible
[1:48:06] says builders
[1:48:08] he says to be a builder is not the
[1:48:10] carpenter the carpenter can use the
[1:48:12] hammer and do that but the builder has
[1:48:14] to be a specialist
[1:48:16] he has to know the everything about the
[1:48:18] house to be able to build a house
[1:48:21] and these men were specialists they were
[1:48:24] theologians they were scribes they were
[1:48:26] pharisees they were knowledgeable but
[1:48:28] they messed the case down that missed
[1:48:31] the cornerstone that threw him out he
[1:48:34] was the rejected stone
[1:48:36] oh praise god hallelujah amen think of
[1:48:40] it they cut him out
[1:48:43] amen and put him out now those of you
[1:48:46] who can see
[1:48:48] do you see why i'm i am
[1:48:50] interdenominational
[1:48:53] oh my
[1:48:55] oh my
[1:48:58] those of you who a masonic lodge i don't
[1:49:00] know if there's any of the mess those of
[1:49:03] the maisonic lodge in here and so forth
[1:49:08] once are you who know the order of
[1:49:10] course i am from the order of
[1:49:11] melchizedek all of you know that right
[1:49:16] now
[1:49:17] he says
[1:49:19] those of you who know
[1:49:22] the order
[1:49:24] and how the order teaches how they cut
[1:49:26] out the stones
[1:49:28] and hauled them to joppa and so forth
[1:49:32] and did it by an ox cart
[1:49:35] right taking them down
[1:49:38] now we know according to that the
[1:49:39] levites should have had it on their
[1:49:41] shoulders carrying it down but they
[1:49:44] added the ox cart now because it seemed
[1:49:46] faster and better and whatnot
[1:49:50] and the tall cedars of lebanon how they
[1:49:53] cut so forth and brought them down and
[1:49:56] the sound of a hammer and saw was not
[1:49:59] heard for the space of 40 years
[1:50:04] here comes a stone
[1:50:06] cut this way another one cut that way
[1:50:09] and one cut this way one that way and
[1:50:12] they found that every stone just when
[1:50:15] they try to put them together slip right
[1:50:17] into its place
[1:50:19] amen let me tell you friends all god's
[1:50:22] gifts are going to find their
[1:50:23] appropriate places
[1:50:25] and they're going to have to fight to do
[1:50:27] it you'll find your place
[1:50:29] and for those whom the scripture and
[1:50:31] there was no place found
[1:50:33] for them
[1:50:35] that will also be fulfilled
[1:50:37] for water goes down to its rightful
[1:50:39] levels wherever that is and that's where
[1:50:42] the word will take every one of us it'll
[1:50:45] raise you up or it'll take you down to
[1:50:47] whichever level you're supposed to be in
[1:50:50] amen they may not you may not just like
[1:50:53] to be like the other person
[1:50:56] but see it's the same way with believers
[1:50:58] in god every one of us has a place in
[1:51:03] this building of god
[1:51:05] i'm not talking about this church but in
[1:51:07] the building of god
[1:51:09] amen
[1:51:10] hallelujah
[1:51:12] we are not just you are not and may not
[1:51:15] just be like the other one
[1:51:18] but we have got a place in here we got a
[1:51:22] place in god's body in god's building in
[1:51:26] god's kingdom we got a place that's why
[1:51:28] paul said if you compare yourselves
[1:51:31] among yourselves is you're not wise
[1:51:34] because each stone got different
[1:51:37] and it's got to fit a certain place
[1:51:39] and nobody else can do your job or
[1:51:42] whatever because they're not made for
[1:51:44] that even if they try to do it they're
[1:51:45] going to do it differently they can't do
[1:51:47] it like you because you are made
[1:51:49] separate
[1:51:50] amen
[1:51:52] everyone a born-again christian you got
[1:51:55] a place there and them builders
[1:51:59] running back over and over looking at
[1:52:02] the stone and they said no i can't see
[1:52:05] the stone being any good it's a freak
[1:52:07] stone
[1:52:08] amen what we caught here is just a freak
[1:52:11] brother
[1:52:12] that's what some of them thinking it's
[1:52:13] going to pass
[1:52:15] it's going to pass away but this ain't a
[1:52:17] freak this isn't something eternal this
[1:52:19] is going to take us from art to glory
[1:52:22] it's going to take us out of here we
[1:52:25] know we got a hold of the something real
[1:52:29] and something true
[1:52:31] according to the word of god hallelujah
[1:52:35] amen oh my now they have kicked the
[1:52:39] stone
[1:52:40] into
[1:52:41] over there in the weed files
[1:52:44] amen they call it false doctrine
[1:52:48] amen
[1:52:50] even in this message some say oh
[1:52:52] you're going too far now
[1:52:55] i don't understand that i don't see that
[1:52:57] i don't know where's that they don't
[1:52:59] understand god doesn't change
[1:53:01] he's still the mighty god
[1:53:03] he's still sending forth his word you
[1:53:06] think it stopped right there god is
[1:53:08] marching on
[1:53:10] amen and the word is pouring out all the
[1:53:12] time
[1:53:13] but it must be in line with the written
[1:53:16] word
[1:53:17] hallelujah praise god now think about it
[1:53:21] now
[1:53:22] the search then asserts threw away the
[1:53:25] real stone and what does that do
[1:53:30] it took them
[1:53:32] to a halt
[1:53:34] they had to stop their building
[1:53:37] because
[1:53:38] they don't have the keystone the
[1:53:40] cornerstone
[1:53:42] they couldn't go any further
[1:53:45] because the very stone they thrown away
[1:53:49] was the chief cornerstone was the
[1:53:52] keystone that threw that away
[1:53:55] and that's where it is today
[1:54:00] brother sister
[1:54:02] instead of the
[1:54:05] cornerstone listen he says that we have
[1:54:08] taken theology
[1:54:13] we have taken schooling
[1:54:17] we have taken
[1:54:19] education
[1:54:22] i use the word knowledge just to make it
[1:54:25] try to come in by knowledge some try to
[1:54:27] come in by religious knowledge some try
[1:54:30] to come in
[1:54:31] by all kinds of means
[1:54:34] right that way
[1:54:36] hallelujah they're trying to enter god's
[1:54:39] storehouse of his word to enjoy the same
[1:54:44] things you are enjoying
[1:54:45] without coming in by the official way
[1:54:48] they want to come in their own way
[1:54:51] or or some way that they are making up
[1:54:54] amen he said now listen education is
[1:54:58] wonderful
[1:55:00] it's but it's been the greatest
[1:55:02] hindrance
[1:55:03] to the gospel that it's ever had
[1:55:06] i am not saying that you should be
[1:55:08] ignorant or something
[1:55:10] you don't have to be ignorant
[1:55:13] and you should put everything you should
[1:55:16] get education
[1:55:17] but brother but people are putting their
[1:55:20] everything on education and theology
[1:55:25] which is what the devil did with eve he
[1:55:27] tried to give her
[1:55:29] knowledge
[1:55:30] intellectual knowledge
[1:55:33] when we use this word intellectual we
[1:55:35] are thinking of high intellect like
[1:55:38] einstein and these people before we
[1:55:40] think intellectual
[1:55:41] but that's not it as long as you are
[1:55:44] approaching it from the point of view of
[1:55:46] your own human resource and accumulation
[1:55:50] of books and knowledge and so on through
[1:55:52] years and time and so you are missing
[1:55:55] the mark completely
[1:55:59] you can have a man that's been there
[1:56:02] doing every possible thing and one day
[1:56:04] he just sit down by himself and just
[1:56:07] like that
[1:56:12] and you maybe was preaching against this
[1:56:13] guy and telling me lost you're going to
[1:56:15] hell
[1:56:17] i don't know who's going to hell
[1:56:20] i don't know nothing
[1:56:23] if you know you step but i don't know
[1:56:26] so i'm here just to preach the word of
[1:56:28] god and let the holy spirit take his own
[1:56:31] people his own and place them and do his
[1:56:34] separation and do his guiding let him do
[1:56:37] that that's my business my abilities
[1:56:38] preach the word
[1:56:41] [Applause]
[1:56:42] and that's why they don't understand oh
[1:56:45] you want to welcome people into the
[1:56:47] church all well dressed beautifully
[1:56:50] write down long dresses
[1:56:53] beautiful suits and men with nice
[1:56:57] pants and shirts and whatnot
[1:56:59] if somebody walks in that dress right
[1:57:02] they don't look right according to
[1:57:05] church standards
[1:57:07] right away you getting worked up i don't
[1:57:09] let people like that in my church
[1:57:13] what nonsense you're talking about
[1:57:15] those are the people he wants to come in
[1:57:20] [Music]
[1:57:25] you don't know what's behind that
[1:57:28] you don't know what's hiding behind
[1:57:29] there you don't know you can look like a
[1:57:31] jacob and
[1:57:33] you know
[1:57:34] and behind that being a jacob could be a
[1:57:37] man that will go and fight with the
[1:57:38] angels
[1:57:39] and another one coming looking like a
[1:57:41] gentleman with suit and everything else
[1:57:42] so you can be crooked as a dark side leg
[1:57:46] right so so let god do that
[1:57:49] praise the name of the lord see a lot of
[1:57:53] preachers that's what they want to do
[1:57:54] they want to have a church full of clean
[1:57:58] nice fish
[1:58:01] right since they put their hook in the
[1:58:03] water
[1:58:04] oh my god i got a fish the fish is ready
[1:58:06] clean scaled slimed off everything else
[1:58:09] done
[1:58:12] that's not how it works
[1:58:14] you got to they come and then you have
[1:58:16] to do
[1:58:17] preach the word for them to be cleaned
[1:58:18] up and scaled up and everything else
[1:58:21] right
[1:58:22] praise the lord but they want to have
[1:58:25] everything else like that but anyway
[1:58:27] praise the lord amen think about it they
[1:58:30] want to use education or knowledge as
[1:58:33] the key to open up the truths
[1:58:36] within
[1:58:38] the word of god and he says no
[1:58:41] i open
[1:58:43] and no man can shut up your
[1:58:45] understanding
[1:58:47] when i loose you from chains of darkness
[1:58:50] none can take you back to that spirit of
[1:58:52] blindness and ignorance that you are in
[1:58:55] you're free by the grace of god and by
[1:58:57] the power of the gospel of jesus christ
[1:59:01] hallelujah just let me preach some more
[1:59:03] brother and sister praise the name of
[1:59:05] the lord brethren

[2:02:48] man i may even have the book somewhere
[2:02:50] still where t.l osborn you know how he
[2:02:53] met brother branham and stuff started on
[2:02:54] his ministry and he wrote a marvelous
[2:02:58] book
[2:02:59] that's lost today
[2:03:01] is called three keys to the book of acts
[2:03:04] and in there he identified when reading
[2:03:07] the book of acts he noticed the word the
[2:03:09] word the word the word
[2:03:12] and then he said oh that's one key and
[2:03:14] then it goes on and they use the name
[2:03:16] right through the book of acts the name
[2:03:19] and that's another key right and the
[2:03:22] holy spirit they keep mentioning the
[2:03:24] spirit made me go the spirit led me the
[2:03:26] spirit this that that so the three keys
[2:03:28] to the book of acts the word the name
[2:03:31] and the spirit but we know by revelation
[2:03:34] is really one key
[2:03:35] but god bless him he saw something and
[2:03:38] it was a blessing to him and still a
[2:03:40] blessing amen for anyone that would read
[2:03:43] that book by t.l osborne called three
[2:03:46] keys to the book of acts now remember
[2:03:52] god holds the keys to the key to this
[2:03:56] revelation
[2:03:57] not keys but the key to this revelation
[2:04:01] amen of christ
[2:04:03] now schools of theology may try but they
[2:04:07] can never ever find it
[2:04:10] jesus said so
[2:04:12] amen
[2:04:13] hallelujah
[2:04:15] oh praise god in matthew 11 25-27
[2:04:20] or thank me father you hit this from the
[2:04:23] eyes of the wise and the proven but you
[2:04:25] have revealed it
[2:04:27] the babes such as would learn
[2:04:30] scholars of that day jews pharisees
[2:04:33] sadducees herodians whatever else might
[2:04:35] have been their big organizations he
[2:04:38] told every one of them
[2:04:40] you're blind
[2:04:43] and you're trying to lead the people and
[2:04:45] you are blind years you're here to hear
[2:04:49] and you hear not eyes to see but you see
[2:04:52] not amen praise god think of it you are
[2:04:56] doing just like eve did back there you
[2:04:59] are accepting the intellectual side and
[2:05:03] not of the
[2:05:05] holy spirit revealing the word of god
[2:05:08] think about it brother sister amen
[2:05:11] the dynamic national he said the blind
[2:05:14] leads the blind they'll fall into a
[2:05:16] ditch
[2:05:17] national dutch
[2:05:19] amen
[2:05:20] house of hell gates of hell shall not
[2:05:23] prevail against the church of the living
[2:05:26] god for god himself alone holds the key
[2:05:31] what does the man say i the son of man i
[2:05:34] am he asked amen hallelujah let me say
[2:05:38] this the great master of all he holds
[2:05:41] the key
[2:05:42] he holds the master key
[2:05:44] for he is the master to the whole thing
[2:05:47] and he has the key within his hands
[2:05:51] blessed art thou he said to peter
[2:05:54] blessed art thou simon
[2:05:57] flesh and blood has never revealed this
[2:05:59] to you
[2:06:00] by my father which is in heaven
[2:06:03] and upon this
[2:06:05] revelation
[2:06:07] remember when you read it everywhere
[2:06:09] else it will say rock rock rock but he's
[2:06:11] making it plain here upon this
[2:06:13] revelation alone i will build my church
[2:06:18] and the gates of hell will never prevail
[2:06:21] against this revelation it will never
[2:06:23] prevail against it my brother sister
[2:06:26] lord of god and when i say that
[2:06:29] there is no school can do it
[2:06:33] no theologian
[2:06:36] no teachings
[2:06:38] of the bible school
[2:06:42] they know nothing about this
[2:06:45] they cannot know nothing about it
[2:06:48] it's impossible for them to know
[2:06:51] anything about it
[2:06:53] because god
[2:06:54] has already hidden their senses of
[2:06:58] knowing
[2:06:59] from getting to it
[2:07:01] he's hidden from all them elected
[2:07:04] them
[2:07:05] elected teachers and everything else out
[2:07:08] there and it has now come that this is
[2:07:13] now a personal
[2:07:15] individual
[2:07:17] affair of christ with that person
[2:07:21] revealing himself to them
[2:07:24] [Music]
[2:07:26] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[2:07:28] you say oh yeah he's been real to me
[2:07:31] then the life that was in that is in
[2:07:34] christ that is produced here in the
[2:07:37] bible that's the same life in there if
[2:07:40] it does not produce itself again in you
[2:07:45] you got the wrong revelation
[2:07:48] amen
[2:07:49] think of it
[2:07:50] the key
[2:07:51] given to me therefore
[2:07:54] for the messenger of each age
[2:07:58] that is the same key
[2:08:00] that might now be called
[2:08:02] the keystone of the entire bible the
[2:08:06] keystone of the bible it's the
[2:08:09] revelation that god
[2:08:12] never ever
[2:08:13] changes i'm closing now and when the
[2:08:16] last elected member
[2:08:19] of the body of christ comes in
[2:08:22] then
[2:08:23] the lord
[2:08:24] himself
[2:08:25] will appear oh blessed be the name of
[2:08:28] the lord brethren i've said what i can
[2:08:31] say of course there is much more that
[2:08:33] can be said if one were to uh like go
[2:08:37] and do an intensive study and there are
[2:08:40] many angles avenues
[2:08:43] and openings of which one can take and
[2:08:45] go in different directions with the word
[2:08:48] of the living god may the great holy
[2:08:51] spirit bless these thoughts to your
[2:08:53] heart
[2:08:54] and may the word of god
[2:08:56] be opened up to you in every possible
[2:09:00] way blessed be the name of the lord god
[2:09:02] bless you i'm looking forward to the
[2:09:04] beginning of the 40 days of prayer and
[2:09:09] trusting that we know prayer changes
[2:09:13] things and that there is power and
[2:09:15] prayer
[2:09:16] musicians singers are coming worship
[2:09:18] ladies are coming praise god hallelujah
[2:09:22] amen
[2:09:23] yes sir i tell you i thank god
[2:09:26] it gives me comfort and peace of mind to
[2:09:30] know
[2:09:31] that he has given us the key
[2:09:34] and that i don't have to really think
[2:09:36] about anything but i just go on with my
[2:09:38] bible
[2:09:40] or open up a message book
[2:09:42] and you know i can't these days i can't
[2:09:44] get very far
[2:09:46] by the time i read one or two sentences
[2:09:48] so much stuff begins to break
[2:09:52] i can't do nothing and you know i was
[2:09:56] telling some of you and i'm just talking
[2:09:57] now
[2:09:59] that i can see
[2:10:01] how that a lot of these preachers and
[2:10:03] teachers if not this message
[2:10:06] if they have no revelation they can only
[2:10:08] go so far
[2:10:10] and after that
[2:10:11] they're going to have to manufacture
[2:10:13] we can't go further
[2:10:15] i quoted you where i actually find where
[2:10:18] brother brown said they're gonna come to
[2:10:19] a halt
[2:10:21] they got nothing else
[2:10:23] nowhere else to go
[2:10:25] they'll go back to like a dark black
[2:10:27] twist vomit they'll go right back to
[2:10:29] their intellectuals they go back to
[2:10:31] their old church teachings or back to
[2:10:34] pentecost or back to luther back to
[2:10:37] some other age
[2:10:39] and they miss
[2:10:41] the key to the house of david that opens
[2:10:45] up everything
[2:10:47] what are you talking about
[2:10:49] what you talking about see
[2:10:51] that's only god can do that because it's
[2:10:53] by grace
[2:10:54] and by grace alone none can boast
[2:10:58] none can boast
[2:11:00] because only god
[2:11:02] can reveal his word
[2:11:04] for he is his own
[2:11:07] and he will make it
[2:11:10] ah
[2:11:11] he
[2:11:12] will make it plain come brother anthony
