[4:02] work McBride authorities had heard amen
[4:09] thank you lord now in the morning as he
[4:13] returned into the city he hungered and
[4:16] when he saw a fig tree in the way he
[4:20] came to it and found nothing thereon but
[4:23] leaves only and he set out to it let no
[4:26] fruit growth on the head sport for ever
[4:29] and presently the fig tree withered away
[4:34] and when the disciples saw it they
[4:38] marvelled saying how soon is
[4:41] big tree withered away jesus answered
[4:44] and said unto them verily I say unto you
[4:49] if ye have faith and not ye shall not
[4:54] only do this is everybody listening
[4:58] which is done to the fig tree but also
[5:01] if you shall say unto this mountain be
[5:04] thou removed and be cast into the sea it
[5:08] shall be done those are his words all
[5:15] things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer
[5:18] believing ye shall receive and when you

[6:13] we know like the scripture says my
[6:16] people perish for lack of knowledge
[6:19] really done in this day and age we
[6:22] really love God as good as they teach
[6:24] what has been spoken these scriptures
[6:27] come alive to you and reveal to you who
[6:31] you are
[6:32] Luke 6 9 when Jesus went with them and
[6:38] when he was not far from the house a
[6:43] Centurion of the Senate print to him
[6:46] saying unto Him Lord trouble not thyself
[6:49] for I am not worthy that thou should
[6:52] enter under my roof
[6:54] wherefore neither thought I myself
[6:57] worthy to come on too deep is another
[7:01] jet that the bride of Jesus Christ but
[7:04] see in a word and my servant shall be
[7:08] healed
[7:09] for I am a man under Authority having
[7:12] with under me soldiers and I say unto
[7:15] one pole and he goeth and another come
[7:19] and he cometh and to my servant do this
[7:22] and he doeth it
[7:24] when Jesus heard these things he
[7:27] marveled at him and turned him about and
[7:31] said unto the people that followed him I
[7:34] say unto you I have not found so great
[7:38] faith no not in Israel amen pray father

[8:33] of your brides a day showing who she is
[8:36] and who you are father grandfather take
[8:41] everything subject to the Word of God

[9:00] glorified in Jesus name god bless your
[9:03] seated amen the authority of the spoken
[9:11] seed Word of God Jesus say here if you
[9:18] had faith and doubt you should not
[9:23] believe do this which was done to the
[9:25] fig tree but also used to sing up to
[9:29] this mountain be thou removed and cast
[9:32] in the sea and it shall be done and we
[9:37] see the the Gentile I see it is
[9:41] unworthiness to the Word of God
[9:50] recognizing the authority recognizing by
[9:53] faith who this man was and said Jess
[9:56] speak just say
[9:58] and my service shall be healed she did
[10:01] not only recognize Jesus but he
[10:03] recognized the authority that Jesus had
[10:06] and recognize that he was God in flesh
[10:12] and that's what we are here today
[10:15] recognizing that God is in flesh and the
[10:18] word is becoming flesh again what a
[10:23] transition but you don't come to this
[10:26] place you know come to this position
[10:29] overnight as we talked on Wednesday amen
[10:34] Chrissa harvest time there's a lapse in
[10:36] time of sees of the word not amen
[10:41] and if we don't plant those seeds of the
[10:44] word of God in us field got hearts right
[10:50] on top of the roof amen and Charles up
[10:58] contrives to be an adult he tries to do
[11:00] certain things and it always messes it
[11:03] up and that's the same process that we
[11:06] do in our box amen that
[11:09] sow the seed in into our hearts and it
[11:14] takes time for harvest we have to wait
[11:17] for the harvest that come to maturity a
[11:21] melody was spoken and done when the
[11:24] Prophet was here well here we are
[11:27] [Music]
[11:54] [Music]
[12:26] this is the English you need to meet
[13:18] Christians who believed US intervention
[13:21] in their lives but we're being
[13:23] frustrated with our results is because
[13:26] they are missing the see conception they
[13:30] know God's work in mark form the word
[13:34] pot three parables Illustrated that the
[13:37] worker is to the kingdom of God by the
[13:40] natural seed is to the artists first
[13:45] these parables and the stories of the
[13:48] sword is the key to unlocking mark 4:13
[13:55] and we don't understand these truths
[13:57] Jesus said you won't understand without
[14:00] parables they are baby like cheese and
[14:04] truthfully these parables but one fact
[14:08] must be understood to get a full benefit
[14:12] of his teachings the Lord uses the
[14:15] the word to the law of nature that is
[14:18] not changeable not an administration of
[14:22] men here's what I mean you get cheese or
[14:28] nearly all systems in this world that
[14:31] man created the legal system can be
[14:33] beaten let the guilty go free
[14:37] our education system can be beaten
[14:40] past the students that really didn't
[14:42] earn or learn the material but you can't
[14:45] change seed time and harvest I see the
[15:07] sea and cry

[16:59] years before and here's what a
[17:01] predestinated vessel and the angel of

[17:07] because she was the one who spoke
[17:17] something that wasn't real that wasn't
[17:20] natural to the human minded and to this

[22:12] know Jesus didn't play Church with the
[22:21] fearsome sizes look at this life he came
[22:24] to bring forth the word came to manifest
[22:27] the worthless nothing
[22:28] amen he didn't he didn't not compromise

[23:21] life that it takes time and it cannot be
[23:26] avoided in the second error while I'm

[24:03] verse 14 that ground is our hearts our
[24:07] hearts were created by God to bring
[24:10] forth fruit when his work is planted and
[24:13] there as the seed has to remain in the
[24:19] ground over time to germinate - upon the
