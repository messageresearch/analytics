having an election and uh the Trump supporters down there let me tell you they are as zealous as you as a son and daughter of God about their leadership and about their leader and uh they will die for their leader let's just put it that way and so we've got a land that's very much divided but you know these are um scriptural prophecies that are being fulfilled right before our very eyes and so for

I trust that the Lord will uh speak to uh your needs and and meet something for you that you can leave here and know that hey God said something to me God spoke something to me today that that I can take and um it can it can change my my life from this day on Amen let's read from the scripture we're going to read from St John 11 verses 37 to 44 amen and the scripture starts and and and some of them said could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should not have died Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the Grave it was a cave and a stone laid upon it Jesus said take ye away the stone Martha the sister of him that was dead saith unto him Lord by this time he stinketh for he hath been dead four days Jesus said unto her said I not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou should us see the glory of God then they took away the Stone from the place where the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I thank thee that thou has heard me and I knew that thou hearest me always but because of the people which stand by I said it that they may believe that thou Hast sent me and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice Lazarus come forth and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with grave clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin and Jesus saith unto them loose him and let him go may the Lord add His blessings to the word please be seated so we're entering into the Easter season and we all know that the next you know in the next three weeks next two to three weeks uh right at the end of the month will be um in the Easter weekend and so uh the Lord has just led me you know into a small series here um of roll away the stone and um so today as we um look at this we're going to be uh just kind of seeing how it is that this you know relates to us how it is that you know that that here we are you know we're we're Christians we're going to church we're living Our Lives we're we're believing the word of God we're trusting the Lord Jesus and and and it's all based on one thing it's all based on the fact that the Lord Jesus rose from the dead amen it's all based on the resurrection our whole experience is based on the fact that Christ came and died for our sins took them to the Cross nailed everything to the Cross when he nailed himself to the Cross we were in him he nailed all of our sins to the cross amen and so when he died for us by us accepting Jesus Christ as the the the the sacrifice and taking place taking our place for our sin we walk free amen praise God and so today um you know I'm saying this is a call to action this is a call to recognize our role as Christians as sons and Daughters of God and what it is that God has given us as a part of this Plan of Redemption our part we have a specific part to play why does God call people he's calling them into his body when he calls them into his body he's calling them to take their positions it's a call to reach the Lost amen it's a call to recognize that Christ is in us through US reaching other others that's what Christianity is all about and you know it was said by the preacher Charles spur Spurgeon once he said every Christian is either a missionary or an impostor y amen wow what a statement Jes what a statement praise God you know a lot of people oh I'm a Christian oh yeah I go to church it's more than saying you're a Christian it's more than saying I go to church it's allowing Jesus Christ to become Lord in your life it's allowing him to come in and transform you change you take you out of a life of unbelief and place you into a life where all things are possible amen glory to God a call to reach the lost a call to recognize that Christ is in US amen praise God this is a supernatural call it's an individual call this is not like oh I'm going to join a church and if I join a church then I'm going to be saved salvation does not come as a result of you joining a church salvation comes as a result of Jesus Christ coming into your life possessing Your Vessel and you saying he is Lord he is absolute there is nothing between me and the Lord this is a call where you become totally yielded and surrender to God Amen and when you do people know it it's a supernatural call it's a personal revelation to recognize what God is doing in your day too many people are putting things off into the future but we need to recognize the resurrection is now amen praise God hallelujah we want to explore the powerful message of res of Resurrection today and our role in in this Plan of Redemption and this Resurrection because I believe we're on a another walk on another road to another Resurrection Lord amen we want to explore the powerful message that's that's behind the word Resurrection our main idea centers around understanding our part that we have a part in this we're not just church members we're sons and Daughters of God we're anointed of the spirit of God to to to produce Miracles not to not for us to make Miracles but for the Lord to operate through US knowing that he can do all things through them that believe in Christ to them that are that are called according to his purpose and what his Spirit possesses and takes control everything is possible we are the key players in in the unfolding plan of God's grace amen praise God we're not just recipients of God's grace but we're conduits of God's grace when we go to work when we go to school when we when we fellowship with our families we're conduits of God's love and God's grace when we know it and and and we we we believe it and we and we know that you know sickness it only comes to give God glory and so when we're with friends or with family and and we see them we we become compassionate and knowing that God doesn't want them to stay that way God wants to heal them God wants to raise them out of their condition God wants to bless them amen and we're the conduits that God has chosen in this day to be to be those that that can be his his feet his hands his voice praise God we're not just bystanders we're key players praise God we're not just saved but we're sent glory to God Amen we are the church body who are on their way to another Resurrection amen hallelujah Jes do you believe that amen glory to God do you know that uh we're we're uh destined for the Rapture do you know that the message of this hour is that God is going to Rapture you out of this Dimension into another dimension amen you know if you look at the word rapture it means caught up in 1 Thessalonians 4 it says we will be caught up we which are alive and remain shall be caught up to meet the the Lord in the air we which are alive shall shall not hinder them that sleep the dead in Christ shall rise first praise God there's going to be a general resurrection and we're on that road right now we're walking to the resurrection amen praise God it's an exciting time and so we're going to look at um at uh St John chapter 11 and we're going to read from verses 1 to 24 you can go to the next slide amen so we're going to be looking at experiencing the resurrection all right so we know the scripture that we read and and what happens what the the ultimate outcome is Lazarus raises from the dead and Jesus says loose him but I want to look at what's happening while and before they reach that place and we're going to draw some things through this you know scripture that we're going to be reading and I want you to picture yourself and as we're identifying and we're reading through the scripture we've got two special individuals that we're going to be looking at here Martha and Mary and as we read that I want you to kind of identify I want you to kind of see where you compare where you uh you know you might type where you might be in your walk amen and where you are in this walk to the resurrection cuz they're headed to a resurrection they didn't know it they didn't realize who was actually with them they knew that he could heal the sick they knew that he could do all the things that that they they had seen him do in the they knew that he could even raise the dead he had already done it but yet you know sometimes you're in a situation in your life and you're walking with God for so many years and you've heard of all the things that God can do and you know what God can do but yet you find yourself in a situation and you might find yourself discouraged let's read St John chapter 11 from verse one now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany the town of Mary and her sister marra it was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was sick therefore his sister sent unto him saying Lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick when Jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God let me tell you I don't know what you're facing right now I don't know if there's a sickness in your life I don't know if there's a need in your life I don't know if there's a relationship that's kind of breaking apart and you know you've got certain situations that you're dealing with let let me say this it has come into your life for the glory of God if you believe hallelujah praise God and when Jesus heard that that's what he said he says that God might be glorified thereby now Jesus loved Mary and her sister and Lazarus when he had heard there for that he was sick he Abode two days still in the same place where he was then after after that he saith to his disciples let us go unto Judea again let me insert this we know that from what we just read here that Jesus had spent time near the Jordan River prior to the death of Lazarus he had received the news two days on the day that he received the news Lazarus had probably died they didn't they you know his disciples didn't know that but Jesus knew he knew exactly what was going on Lazarus was sick unto death Jesus stayed where he was for two more days oh boy let me tell you Jesus just doesn't answer me you know he just takes his time you know we wonder sometimes if Jesus really cares oh let me tell you he knows all about it he knows all about it seems apparent that Lazarus had died the same day that he received the news that he was sick and then after two days Jesus tells his disciples to prepare to return unto Judea and he affirms that Lazarus was dead he told he told the the the the we're going to read that while the situation was very desperate for Mary Martha and particularly Lazarus Jesus had purposely waited to return I tell you God I tell you the Lord Jesus knows exactly when he he needs to be in your situation he knows exactly what the right time is amen praise God hallelujah there are times in our lives when it seems we have passed a point of no return you might think oh this is not going to work out I mean imagine you find out that Lazarus is dead your brother's dead you knew that Jesus could heal him but yet he didn't come he took his time he had something else in mind amen we assume our situation will never improve and maybe even think that the Lord has chosen to do nothing I'm telling you I don't care if there's a situation in your life that started 15 years ago and you keep going to the Lord you say Lord why has this not changed he knows the right time he knows when he needs to call you he knows when he needs to place you he knows when he needs to position you in the word of God because he has a purpose for every son and daughter of God hallelujah we will soon find out that that he's never too late Hallelujah even in a situation of extreme death he's still not too late your situation may be beyond the point of no return the doctors have given you the final notice Hallelujah but not with Jesus not if it's listen the lord giveth and the lord taketh blessed be the name of the Lord amen hallelujah Jesus was told that Lazarus was sick unto death and they wanted him to come immediately to pray for him they knew Jesus could do it yet Jesus took his time why he was going to show them that they would have an active role in what was going to happen they didn't know it yet but God had something in mind for them God had a place for them in this whole Redemptive plan amen everything is a type and a shadow we need to see all of this that's taking place because this is the last major event before Christ actually goes into Jerusalem to be crucified right it was after this miracle that the Pharisees and and all of those had realized that wait a minute here this is this is too much this is a little bit too much there's no way that uh this can carry on we're going to have to for the sacrifice of one man for for for all we're going to have to we're going to have to put this man to death but that was all part of his plan too amen and so his disciples say to him we're going to read on now verse eight master the Jews of late sought to Stone thee and goest thou tither again because Jesus said let's go back let's go back to Bethany and they knew that wait a minute you can't go back there there but Jesus answered are there not 12 hours in the day if any man walk in the day he stumbleth not because he seeth the light of this world but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because there is no light in him if you're looking to hide and you're looking to to to you know not allow the spirit of God to do what it is that he's promised that he's going to do listen Jesus knew that nobody could touch him amen if he was in the service of God and he was under the anointing of the Holy Spirit God had showed him that he was going to raise Lazarus amen and there was nothing that was going to stop it because Jesus knew what the Lord had what the spirit his Spirit had showed him now we're not talking about two different gods here we're not talking God the Father and Jesus on Earth remember Jesus Christ was the word made flesh he was God in human flesh flesh he created himself a body but when he says I do nothing less the father shows me is because he is under subjection to his own plan it was the father's Plan of Redemption and Jesus would only do that which he had seen that the father had shown him because he was in a human vessel just like you and me it's a miracle that that that God is in you and and in me yeah amen we don't understand that but that's a supernatural element that that that that God is in you and that God can show you things God can use you speak through you give you a vision and reveal things in your life and in others lives and use you as an instrument well Jesus was displaying that in his own human body that he created for himself the word was made flesh and it dwelt among us and so there was nothing that Jesus Jesus is Walking In The Light according to the knowledge and the will of his father he listen his actions are only as dangerous as God intends them to be and your actions if you're called as a son or a daughter of God into this Revelation that you are a Christian a Christian is one whom Christ dwells in and you've surrendered and you've given your life and you've you've you've made him Lord in your life there is nothing that can harm you there is nothing that can stand between you and the purpose of God and what God has in store for your life you can walk with confidence that Jesus knows all about it and that he will make away in whatever situation you're dealing with am no devil in hell can stop stop God's plan in your life amen because you're ordained you're an attribute of God you're a Son of God you're a daughter of God you can't even sin Hallelujah you can't even sin because sin is when you disbelieve the word of God and even when you are trapped and you're caught in unbelief you're looking at that unbelief and you know you're trapped you know that that that it was a trap of the enemy because you don't believe that you believe God is greater than that you believe God can deliver you from that God has already delivered you from that you know that that that that in your mind in your heart you cannot deny the word of God if you are an attribute of God Amen true these things sayith he now verse 11 he saith and after that he saith unto them our friend Lazarus sleepeth but I go that I may awake him out of sleep then said his disciples Lord if he sleeps he shall do well they thought he was just saying that you know well he's resting and they were figuring oh the Lord knows all about it he's resting now this is great he's resting Lord we don't need to go how be it J Jesus spake of his death but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep then said Jesus unto them plainly Lazarus is dead oh listen you you know sometimes you'll hear a statement and you'll hear oh this is this is done this is over but listen what he says he says and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there my goodness you wonder Jesus was not there Jesus wasn't there when that situation took place I got into that car accident my car was destroyed why didn't Jesus help me why wasn't he there because God is working something out in your life God is going to give you faith that when you look back onto those situations you will see that there was something happening there was a transformation taking place in your life amen he says I was glad I was not there to the intent that you made believe nevertheless let us go unto them unto him now listen you got these guys around you all the time too then said Thomas which is called dimus unto his fellow disciples let us also go that we may die with him he figured you know he figured oh boy if Jesus goes there they're going to Stone him they're going to kill him you know he didn't believe what Jesus actually said you know you'll tell people about the power of God that he can transform that he can deliver you that he can set you free and there's going to be those that are going to be around that are just not going to believe they're going to need to see to believe but blessed are you that believe and have not seen am because greater is going to be the victory when when it takes place in your life and greater will be the faith that you experience when you see God doing the impossible God doing doing great things amen Thomas he did not believe Jesus would raise Lazarus this not only puts down Thomas but emphasizes to you know to the readers that you know because John I want you to recognize something when you read the book of John you're going to see things and read things that that all the other you know APO disciples never recognized you know you read in Luke you read in Mark and and Matthew but John he had he had some special revelation God allowed him to see certain things amen and so he would bring them out in his writings he was the one that that that that Jesus showed you know at the Last Supper that it was Judas that it was him that was going to dip you know his bread he told it to John amen there was things that you'll see in the Book of John so when you're reading John this is something that you know that that I came to realize and and I I heard it and then I started to experience it and here it is you know and John will pick up on on things that you know that that other uh disciples did not pick up on Amen praise God he just he just thought you know that uh it would be an impossible thing Thomas you know he just didn't believe and you're going to have those that are around you that are going to not believe but that's where you're going to have to stand you're going to have to stand on the faith that God has placed within your heart then when Jesus came he found that he had laid in the grave 4 days days already now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem about 15 furlongs off and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met him but Mary sat still in the house H interesting observation you know if you look at Martha and Mary you will see that there are differ Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming went and met him but Mary sat still in the house why would Mary stay home you know there's times you know she was the one that was constantly at jesus' feet she was the one that was feeding on his words just listening to him you know pouring ointment on his feet you know expensive ointment some some have said that that ointment could be worth3 or $35,000 in in today's you know cost of this special ointment that she was pouring on his feet she had come to realize that that this was the Messiah she couldn't she just wanted to Feast at his feet constantly Martha she was the servant she was the one that was constantly preparing the foods you know doing things to to uh you know to be hospitable because it was the tradition back then that when somebody of importance would come into the town you would invite them into your home you would wash his feet you would you know prepare Foods you would prepare like uh you know a gathering and you would do things and Martha she was a worker but Mary she was the one that was you know very very delicate and very just wanted to hear his words constantly but yet when Lazarus died she didn't want to go meet him you know things happen in our lives sometimes and you know situations don't go exactly the way we want it we get discouraged we don't want to go to church because when you go to meet Jesus that's going to church you know you go through a situation and all of a sudden you just you know like it just didn't work out the way you wanted it to work out and so you get you know very discouraged it doesn't change who you are it doesn't change the fact that you're still a Believer and that you've got faith great faith amen but you get so discouraged that you don't even want to go meet Jesus praise God hallelujah Mary was Martha was hurting and grieving of the loss of her brother but she went out to meet him what's unusual is that Mary didn't accompany her Mary is the one who was always found at his feet amen but in that moment of grief and pain she chose not to go how do you find yourself sometimes you find find yourself discouraged you find it that you know it's hard sometimes to to go and meet Jesus to go and spend some time with him praise God even the strongest Believers struggle at times when faced with devastating situations this does not imply that Mary had abandoned her faith but it does appear that she had kind of died to defeat her world was shattered and she was having difficulty coping with the reality of the situation there's situations that we will face there are realities in our lives that we must deal with but I want you to know that you can you can get back up because Jesus is calling for you amen Jesus knows all about your situation we all face these times where our faith is tested we all face these times when when we're tempted to resign to defeat I'm not going to church you'll look for every possible excuse not to assemble because you're in a state of defeat and you can't get back up Jesus is saying get back up Hallelujah the difference between Martha and Mary Martha was a worker she was constantly preparing food to host the visitors when Jesus would come by their home you know Jesus would go by their home regularly you heard it Jesus loved Martha Mary and Lazarus yes he knew all about them he knew all about their situation he knew all about their life he knew that Lazarus was going to get sick unto death he knew all about them God knows your situation God God didn't start uh you know your your your walk with him 15 20 even 30 years ago to leave you behind he started that work he's going to finish that work you can trust him you can know that he's going to finish the work that he started in your lives amen praise God you know Martha was was a worker and sometimes we get so caught up in working whether it's our jobs or whether we're working in the in the house of the Lord and we don't even we don't even come into the service because we're too busy doing things that are that are around the church you know like you know oh I got to prepare this and I got to do that and you know and you're missing the time like Mary where she just sat at his feet and just feeding on the word of God we've got to have that balance you know Martha was was was was a was a daughter of God but she was too caught up in the works Mary she was she was uh she wanted to be there she wanted to to hear the word she wanted to listen to what he had to say Amen she was a worshipper constantly At His Feet which sister do you compare to sometimes we got to you know because Martha she's like a type of the Old Testament Mary type of the new Martha the law Mary Grace you know that you know Martha got so upset one time she you go back and read it in Luke chapter 10 and she got upset she went to Jesus and she says Mary's not helping out here you know like here we are we're gathered we're you know we're having some nice fellowship and you know we're preparing the food but Mary you know she's too busy there hanging out at jesus' feet like you know she's right there come on Lord like you know listen to what Jesus said to her Jesus answered and said unto her Martha Martha Thou Art careful and troubled about many things you know sometimes we get too caught up and and and we get so caught up with the the things of our life and business and work and and family and this problem and that problem and oh we got to get this done at the church and we got to do this at the church and you know and and and all those listen that's great that you've got that Zeal that you want to be in the service of the Lord but you need to balance your walk amen you need to have a balance with Christ you need to be willing to go and sit quietly at jesus' feet get into your closet spend some time you know you'll spend two three hours hours in front of the tube but you won't spend a half an hour with Jesus hallelujah praise God we're all guilty of it you know we're in a world where we're constantly bombarded with with all kinds of distractions and everything's constantly hitting us from the right and the left and and and we're being distracted by work and you know by you know that you know you look into the mailbox and you see that bill that you know is the the Visa bill you you know and you just see it throw it on your desk you know or you know that property tax bill and oh man is it that time again you know and and and we get you know we get we get but listen you should be the H we should be the happiest people on Earth we we should be the the most grateful people on Earth because when you surrendered unto Jesus Jesus said I will be with you even in you until the end of the age I will never leave you I will never forsake you you can you can place your whole being on that amen praise God look what he says Martha Martha Thou Art careful and troubled about many things but one thing is needful and Mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her let me tell you when you get into the presence of the Lord when you assemble yourself around the word of God and you come with expectation and God speaks to you personally I don't know I I know God's going to be speaking to some of you here today I know for a fact because this is this is how God this is the foolishness of preaching this is how the Holy Spirit Faith cometh by hearing and by hearing the word of God and I'm not bringing any deep things here today God didn't show me to bring any deep things here today amen he says keep it simple amen he says people need to roll some stones in their lives there's some stones of unbelief there's some things that that are hindering them from giving All to Jesus from from allowing Jesus to let them walk out of that grave out of that condition that they're in because you know the grave those there's a lot of graves out there amen praise God there's only one truth and that is the word of God there is no two 3,000 different interp interpretations on God's word there's only one interpretation and the interpretation can only be given to you as an individual by the Holy Spirit that's the only way that you can say truth not because a man says it not because listen Paul says you follow me as I follow Christ he only spoke that which was in the word of God Amen we're only bringing to you those things that are in the word of God glory to God she chose the better things it's not that Martha was not a daughter of God but she was caught up in the works Hallelujah glory to God but Mary she was she was just floating in Grace she loved the grace of God you didn't deserve God's grace you didn't deserve him to come into your life deliver you from your unbelief deliver you from your addictions deliver you from from your your your own self we are Our Own Worst Enemy at most times and God delivers us from those stinking thinking thoughts that we constantly allow to nest in our minds we got to kick them out and replace them with the word of God replace those thoughts with God's word God's promises says I'm the Lord that Health Thee the the devil's going to tell you you got cancer the Lord says I am the Lord that Health thee which one are you going to believe do you know that he gives and he takes you can't leave this earth unless God allows it so where are you going to put your trust you might as well lay it right at the feet of Jesus just like Mary did Hallelujah you can get discouraged like Mary did but watch Mary was after the better things while Martha was doing the good things both are important and we need to find our balance Hallelujah please note Christ did not say Martha had chosen the wrong things he didn't say that he said he said and Mary had chosen he didn't say and Mary had chosen the right things no no he said we can make choices that are better the fact that you chose Jesus that's the foundation then you can start making choices in your life to experience better things constantly by making better choices making better decisions Hallelujah the things which Martha had been doing Hospitality were good things but it was a lesser thing than that at the moment of sitting at the feet of Jesus and so you know you you could choose to go down downstairs and you know well I got to prepare my Sunday school lessons and you know what I'm going to have to take time on Sunday because I won't have time during the week no no you need to be in the house in the sanctuary feeding on the word of Goden you need to allow Jesus to give you the strength to overcome and then the Lord will provide all of those things that you have need of amen glory to God when you are supposed to be you know uh feeding on the word you're doing other things but you need to be here don't make your Works more important than feeding on the word of God hallelujah simple things were being reminded now verse 21 then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou had been here my brother had not died now she wasn't she wasn't saying to Jesus that you know like mad that you know you should have been here no no she just she knew that if he had have been there he wouldn't have died it's not like she she didn't believe she still firmly believed amen but I know that even now by this statement look but I know that even now whatsoever thou Willl ask of God God will give it thee Jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again but Martha said unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day listen we're talking about the resurrection now we need to come into the you know a lot of Christians you know they're heading into the Easter season and they've been doing lent and they've been you know sacrificing certain things you can't even find lent in the Bible you need to sacrifice every day by by serving God by praying reading his word they won't do that but they'll just decide that they're not going to go on their cell phone on Instagram for 40 days but they'll still go on Facebook it's ridiculous there's no such thing there's only faith and when you've got faith in Jesus Christ you you you all those Works you've put aside all those Works Jesus said I am the Sabbath when he came he was the Sabbath if you receive Christ in your life there's no certain day of the week Yes We Gather on Sundays yes we we gather around the word of God because we are to assemble ourselves even more so as the day approaches but you can assemble on Wednesday we like we do you can assemble on Saturday I don't care what day you want to assemble but when you make that day a law to assemble and that somebody that assembles on a different day they're lost sorry you want to you know like brother brandham says you want to you want to write me you want to put me outside the Circle I'm just going to draw a bigger Circle and bring you right back in I'm going to say that that that if you want to put me out that's fine that's what you believe but I'm going to put you right back in because Jesus Christ is our Sabbath he is our rest once you've come into him you've rested from all things and so people are headed towards Easter and they're and they're not realizing and recognizing they will come to Easter Sunday and they will like literally on on Good Friday they will they will act so sad because you know Good Friday was the day that he was put to death and so they will get so emotionally attached to that and they will they will they will have to sacrifice in some way and they'll be so sad and they'll exess listen we should be the Glad people sure we know that that Good Friday what it represented but Easter Sunday was the Resurrection Day that Resurrection is not going to happen on March the 31st it already happened 2,000 years ago and he's resurrected in you and I today and everything that I'm reading here we're we're reading it as a context to see how we fit into the word of God and how this word pertains to our lives today in type form amen but Jesus Christ has not changed listen to what he says he says um but I know that even now she says that whatever you ask God will give it thee Jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha said yes Lord in the resurrection at the last day Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and I want you to note he didn't just say I am the resurrection he said I am the life amen when Resurrection took place he placed his life in you am that life is eternal he's the only one that can give you eternal life Hallelujah and the resurrection he said I am it's now it's present glory to God and he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this sir Hallelujah she sayith unto him yeah Lord I believe that thou art the Christ the son of God which should come into the world she knew that he was the Messiah she knew that he was Jehovah of the Old Testament had been made flesh she knew that it was him she realized that it was the it was Jehovah himself that had come the word was made flesh was standing right before she knew that all things were possible amen hallelujah but yet she made the statement said but if you had been here Lazarus would not have died you see she was caught up into a future event like a lot of people they looking at the Rapture and they're placing it off into the future you know that the Rapture is already in progress you've already been changed you've already been snatched out of the world your family and your friends listen my family my friends I love them dearly and they love me dearly but a lot of them think you're different yeah you take this a little too far you're a little bit of an extreme you know in in in your in what you believe call it extreme call it whatever you want listen if you had have been here 2,000 years ago when Jesus was walking on the earth there was only a dozen people that were actually following him brother Gabe okay but your own family doesn't even believe what you believe your own friends don't even believe what you believe but that doesn't matter that's not up to me or you to make them believe the word of God is something that God reveals personal it's something personal I know when you first come to the Lord I did the same I made the same mistakes I got so zealous I wanted to drive everything down the people's throats you got to believe this you got to believe this word you got to believe this message and then I realized Jesus sitting back there and saying I open yeah and no man shuts I opened your understanding I haven't opened theirs yet yet that's the way I see it that's entirely up to him when he wants to unveil himself make himself real open that word to where they look into the word and they say wait a minute you mean I was baptized as I wasn't baptized I was baptized as a baby how could I understand how could I believe anything you see I fell under that tradition and when when when our eyes are open to see the word of God the first thing you want to do is you want to get to that tank not because it saves you it doesn't save you you could go in a a a dry Sinner and you're going to come out a wet sinner if you have not repented and have not received the spirit of God into your heart to open your understanding to say Amen to every word of God Amen let the let the word of God be truth and every man's word be a lie Hallelujah you're not going to be blinded by the traditions of man but first communion this that children's those are all traditions of man that's not the word of God and so if you know people you know you're too zealous for the word yeah but but if God is going to judge us listen don't tell me we're not in the last days don't tell me Israel is not in her Homeland and fighting a battle don't tell me that these wars that are taking place with with with Russia and Ukraine and and and and a divided country the US of America so bankrupt it has never been as bankrupt financially as it is today but yet because of man's ways and man's listen Satan is the God of all governments amen I'm just gonna tell it straight okay he's the one that went to Jesus in the 40 days of Temptation and said you see all these kingdoms they're all mine go read your scripture he says I'll give them to you if you bow down to me Imagine The Creation telling the Creator to bow down he said get behind me Satan you Jesus you you've got a part to play thank you Jes your part is being played out that's all God God has a plan where do you fit into the plan are you on your way to the resurrection have you already been resurrected Hallelujah glory to God and whosoever he says yay Lord I believe let so then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou been here my brother would not have died I don't think Martha intended any disrespect there she knew what he could do and you know what God can do but you have to you have to sub you you got to submit to God's time and God's season and God's will for your life hallelujah praise God I am certain we all have felt that way oh if Jesus had have been there but no doubt we come to realize and I don't want to be the bear of bad news but I'm going to tell you that these situations will continue in your life where you will find yourself Lord why Lord Lord why this Lord why that he's going to answer it Hallelujah we've all stood at the crossroads in life but like it says in Psalms 121 I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help and it's my Help Cometh From The Lord which made Heaven and Earth Hallelujah glory to God Jesus said thy brother shall rise again Hallelujah and there's nothing that would stop it death had invaded their home but it would not be something final you may have got a doctor's report but I'm telling you it's not final glory to God because if you're a son or a daughter of God death has no sting over you if the doctor gives a report and says in three months you're going to die and in three months you do you can you can know that you're you're just absent from the body present with the Lord amen you see death had no more sting over Paul he had a re he had a revelation that he was an eternal son or daughter of God and so he did not fear death he did not he did not you know listen as human beings we all fear that that that word you know we all hate to see it when it happens but recognize that there is a time for all things scripture says there's a time to be born and there's a Time to die I love my family my my my my loved ones my my parents my dad's 94 years old couple of weeks ago I had to rush to the hospital and you know he was in a bad he was in a bad situation and I just went there and I laid hands on him and I said dad I'm going to pray for you right now he says okay and I prayed over him and I said Lord whatever I had to say and I pronounced him made whole in the name of Jesus Christ but yet I said said your will be done not my will your will be done and God's will was that he was going to raise up three four days later and he's he won a he won a a a a tournament the other day they were sending me pictures while I'm on vacation shuffle board tourn tournament him and his partner I said yep the last time I was there the same tournament was on and they had won that round and they had moved up they even asked me the time that I was there they said oh we need somebody to play is anybody want to volunteer because this one didn't have a partner said I'll play I'll try I did terrible I couldn't keep one on the table they were 94 my dad there just nice shot Dominic what is it it's the grace of God hallelujah God has a time and a season for all things and when you live in a way that you're free that you're satisfied to know that you're in the hands of God and that God has your back God has your Finance God has your health God has all things in control God has your mate God has somebody for you to meet you don't have to fear if it's in you just got to wait for God's time because when it's in his time it's beautiful it works out marvelously amen hallelujah death had invaded their home but it was not something that was Final Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life amen praise God Hallelujah the resurrection now she didn't realize that he was talking about right now we're going to go raise Lazarus right now where have you laid him praise God put up that quote there slide number five now even to this day Slide Five now even to this day that same holy spirit that has lifted us up from a life of sin where we once lived and we've and we've already we're dead in Christ buried and raised with him in his resurrection now and setting right now in Heavenly places with him amen watching him work Among Us why why I why a i out yonder among the denominations because it's those that are dead and buried in him and have raised with him in his resurrection and now not we will be you see all a lot of churches they they talk about the resurrection and they're going to put it off into a future event and not and not just claim all the benefits of being a son or a daughter of God right now sure we have problems sure we have the same s situations sure we get sick from time to time but God is our backbone God is our absolute God is now God can resurrect the situation now I believe he can change it right now he says not will be but we are now in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus looking back to where we once come from a direct evidence that we received part of it because we are dead and our life is hid in God through Christ and already raised again in the resurrection with him amen oh my we're already resurrected we're already changed we're already snatched out of the world we're already in the Rapture it's already in progress and you know the final moment of the Rapture read it it's in the moment in the twinkling of an eye a lot of people think they can just go on live any way they want I'm a Christian I went to church when I was young that's good enough well what are you going to say you can't say nothing you got to let the Holy Spirit have his way praise God you got to know where you stand in the word of God you got to know where you are you got to make sure your calling your ction amen praise God hallelujah and when she had so said verse 28 now go to verse 28 and when she had so said she went her way and called Mary her sister secretly saying the master has come now she had caught something and the enthusiasm that was in Martha was now conveyed unto Mary you know you need to be like Martha sometimes you need to convey that hey the Master's here hey Jesus can help you Jesus can change your situation he can he can transform that situation in your life wow I still got another hour and a half it's only 11:30 he can change those circumstances in your life praise God he's he's now the Lord needs more Martha calling testifying that Jesus is calling for you amen when Mary heard that she immediately went running right away oh something some excitement was taking place something was going to happen amen the Lord wants us to take an active role in that way praise God Hallelujah in sharing the message of this hour this word that God has sent a prophet of in and fulfilled Malachi 4:5 and Revelations 107 a man by the name of William Branham just like people talk about Billy Graham just like people talk about about you know great ministers Oral Roberts and and you know John Wesley and Martin Luther you know William brandham he was a reformer but he was one that was anointed with the ministry and a prophetic Ministry to restore the word of God back to the original Faith amen and so you need to go back and search the scriptures because the Reformation is still in progression and you need to realize what the word is doing in your day we don't we don't worship William brandham we don't follow a man we follow the word if there's anything that he said that was not in the word we would not believe it but everything he said you got to you got to for yourself you need your own Revelation you need to you need to read for yourself you need to search and listen to the messages you need to go back and listen to William bram's message on the rising of the sun you need to go back and listen to Christ the mystery of God revealed you need to listen to those things because just like Martin Luther had a revelation to break away from the Catholic church because he had caught his own Revelation that the just shall live by faith Wesley caught a revelation that you need to be Sanctified Pentecost caught a revelation of gifts William bram's Revelation was I want to introduce you to Jesus Christ the original word because you've taken all of your traditions and you've made the word of God of none effect he came to deal with the churches glory to God hallelujah so Mary Rose quickly now Jesus was not yet come into the town but was in that place where Martha met him the Jews then which were with her in the house and comforted her when they saw Mary they that she rose up hastily you know she must have received something and she got excited and went out followed her saying she goeth unto the grave to weep there then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw him she fell down at his feet saying unto him Lord same thing that Martha said if thou had us been here my brother had not died when Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in his spirit and was troubled and said where have you laid him they said unto him Lord come and see Jesus wept then said the Jews behold how he loved him aren't you glad that Jesus loves you Let The Musicians come we're going to continue on Wednesday night we're going to finish a few minutes early today but aren't you glad glad that Jesus loves you that he's there for you that he's mindful of your situations that he is the resurrection and the life that he can resurrect

praise God we will continue this on Wednesday night I'm looking looking forward to it because we're going to get into some really good stuff amen we're going to roll some Stones Hallelujah there's some stones that uh we need to roll away praise God we need to recognize that God has called us to roll Stones away from our lives and also to roll stones in other people's lives hallelujah praise God

gracious father Lord Jesus we're so grateful today Lord as we're entering into this season of Easter father and a Time Lord where the resurrection is emphasized Lord we're emphasizing that you are
