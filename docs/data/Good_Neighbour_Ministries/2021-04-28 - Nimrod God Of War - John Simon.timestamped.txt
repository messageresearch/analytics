[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] it's good to be back
[0:16] with you on another
[0:19] wednesday night here is our bible study
[0:23] and may the lord bless us together
[0:27] as we enter into the word of god
[0:31] for these brief moments
[0:34] our scripture is found in genesis
[0:37] 10 verses
[0:41] 18 8.
[0:49] begot nimrod
[0:53] he began to be a mighty one
[0:57] in the earth he was a
[1:00] mighty hunter before the lord
[1:05] wherefore it is said even
[1:08] as nimrod the mighty
[1:12] hunter before the lord
[1:16] and the beginning of his kingdom
[1:20] was babel and
[1:23] eric and akkad
[1:27] and kalne in the
[1:30] land of shinar
[1:35] our subject today is nimrod
[1:38] god of war
[1:42] let us pray gracious father we ask your
[1:45] blessing upon this
[1:47] the word of god that we bring to your
[1:50] people
[1:50] to thee be the glory to thee
[1:54] be all the praise we lift you up father
[1:58] we
[1:58] exalt and adore you we magnify you
[2:03] by your words by our lives by everything
[2:07] we do and say
[2:09] may you be glorified father we humble
[2:12] ourselves in your presence
[2:15] that we may be used of of you
[2:19] as sons and servants of the living god
[2:23] captives to the word of god in jesus
[2:27] name we ask it amen
[2:31] and amen praise god hallelujah
[2:36] now nimrod god of war
[2:41] uh in doing this teaching we must
[2:45] touch briefly on history
[2:51] and we must must touch in particular
[2:54] on the history of nimrod himself
[2:58] the origins of polytheism
[3:03] the belief in many gods
[3:06] and the origins of
[3:10] mary olitree uh like you would say
[3:14] idolatry mary olivery
[3:19] and we will touch
[3:22] on the origins of ancestor
[3:26] worship ancestor washing now
[3:34] the neaness
[3:39] of history is the nimrod
[3:42] mentioned in the bible genesis
[3:46] chapter 10.
[3:50] now one pompeus
[3:54] speaks now nina's king
[3:57] of assyria quoting from history
[4:00] pompeus speaking
[4:05] nina's king of assyria
[4:08] changed the ancient
[4:11] moderate ways of life
[4:14] by a desire for conquest
[4:19] or war
[4:23] he was the first
[4:27] who carried war against
[4:30] his neighbors of course the first person
[4:33] for war was satan
[4:35] in heaven and now he's found
[4:39] some of his lineage on the earth
[4:43] one nimrod whom he is going to use
[4:46] and will be the first and is the first
[4:50] to start war and conquests of war
[4:53] on the earth
[4:56] now there it is he conquered all
[5:00] nations from assyria to libya
[5:05] as these men for these men
[5:08] pompeo is speaking he conquered for
[5:11] these men knew not the
[5:14] arts of war you see he attacked
[5:17] nations who did not know how to
[5:20] organize they did not know how to
[5:24] arm themselves with all
[5:27] manner of uh knowledge of
[5:30] warfare uh but uh
[5:33] so they were at a disadvantage and he
[5:36] attacked them and was able
[5:38] to conquer them another historian
[5:42] speaking theodorus
[5:45] ninus was the most ancient of assyrian
[5:48] kings
[5:49] mentioned in history being
[5:53] of a war-like disposition
[5:58] he trained young men
[6:02] rigorously in the arts
[6:06] of war he brought
[6:10] babylonia under him
[6:14] while yet there was no city
[6:18] of babylon you see now
[6:22] this nina started out to be
[6:25] great uh see he started out to be great
[6:30] now he built the city
[6:34] the the bell babylon or babel
[6:39] he's the one who built that city
[6:43] to that extent and
[6:46] you see he became great
[6:50] and became its king genesis 10
[6:56] speaking of nimrod in the beginning of
[6:59] his kingdom
[7:00] and the beginning of his kingdom was
[7:02] babel
[7:04] and eric and acted on khalna in the land
[7:07] of shinar okay
[7:11] now we found out certain things here
[7:14] nimrod develop arts of war
[7:19] or strategies of war
[7:23] now recognize this that we know in
[7:26] history there are
[7:27] others like um
[7:31] the chinese general great a man
[7:35] who wrote a great book on the art and
[7:38] strategy
[7:39] of war but the original
[7:44] of all warfare all
[7:48] strategies and later on we will find out
[7:51] he started to
[7:52] invent evil things
[7:56] or weapons of war
[7:59] back then and you will understand what
[8:02] why
[8:03] for the bible calls him
[8:08] that he was
[8:11] a mighty hunter
[8:14] a mighty hunter before the lord
[8:18] now watch carefully now i believe
[8:23] that nimrod gathered
[8:26] his arts of war
[8:30] from satan who inspired him
[8:34] and the inspiration might have gone
[8:37] along these lines
[8:39] oh uh nimrod you are the most skilled
[8:43] hunter on the earth you know the
[8:46] strategies
[8:48] and the ways of animals how to trap them
[8:52] how to find them how to kill them
[8:55] you know the ways uh to do that
[8:59] and then the devil switched his thoughts
[9:03] think of it nimrod if you can
[9:06] capture animals in their dens
[9:10] if you can kill them by hunting them
[9:14] don't you see if you hunt
[9:17] men you will be just as successful
[9:21] i will make you a successful man
[9:24] if you will hunt men
[9:29] and the thoughts seem to make sense
[9:32] to nimrod because he knows the
[9:35] strategies already
[9:37] all he has to do is switch it over
[9:42] into the hunting of men
[9:45] so he began to apply all the principles
[9:49] and
[9:50] knowledge that he had from hunting
[9:53] and turned it towards hunting
[9:56] men through his arts of war
[10:00] and that is how big he became a god
[10:04] of war or the god of war
[10:07] upon the earth because later he was
[10:09] worshiped
[10:11] as a god and that is the reason why
[10:14] i took this as a topic nimrod
[10:18] god of war and he is the originator
[10:22] he is the evil inventor and creator
[10:26] of war he was the first
[10:30] to ever gather multitudes of
[10:34] young men and begin to bring them
[10:38] like an army he formed the first army
[10:41] and disciplined them by
[10:44] it said by drilling he started
[10:48] drilling and going through parades
[10:51] practice of various uh
[10:54] ways of defense and attack uh
[10:58] various arts of war and
[11:01] there through his drilling
[11:04] uh his training he instilled discipline
[11:09] and began to form squads and troops
[11:12] later on as you know we have battalions
[11:14] and so on but he
[11:16] started all of that and started that
[11:19] uniformity
[11:21] and militarism the spirit
[11:24] of war that dropped from heaven
[11:27] from satan inspired men of the earth
[11:31] and he then took that kind of
[11:34] evil inspiration and began to
[11:38] use it for his benefit to enrich himself
[11:42] to empower himself
[11:44] to elevate himself to godhood
[11:47] where he could have man following him
[11:51] and worshipping him
[11:54] there he is nimrod
[11:57] god of war
[12:00] of course babel
[12:03] was not yet a city
[12:07] babylon was not yet a city and from
[12:11] bay belt he built the kingdom
[12:14] of babylon and later became
[12:17] king of babylon
[12:21] the realize nimrod
[12:24] was the son of cush
[12:28] who was the son of ham
[12:32] and there in egyptian
[12:36] culture
[12:39] bell is called hermes
[12:44] and hermes is crush
[12:47] let me go back over that in egyptian
[12:51] culture
[12:54] bell is called hermes
[12:59] and hermes
[13:02] is cush
[13:06] and the bible tells us
[13:11] that cush begot
[13:14] nimrod now hermes
[13:18] means son of him
[13:21] and cush was the son
[13:25] of him now according to
[13:28] further history hermes
[13:34] was called that
[13:37] which means son of him
[13:40] he was the ancient prophet
[13:43] of idolatry he began to
[13:47] insert or uh instill
[13:52] the practice of idolatry on the face of
[13:56] the earth
[13:57] for before that time
[14:00] there was the knowledge of only one god
[14:05] one eternal self-existing being
[14:10] called god the eternal elohim
[14:14] and so he was
[14:18] with the spirit of rebellion broke away
[14:21] from the things of god
[14:23] and began to teach the people
[14:26] differently
[14:28] that there is not just one god there is
[14:31] many gods and these three are the most
[14:35] premium or prominent gods
[14:39] that you should worship and so he
[14:42] instilled
[14:42] idolatry and from that
[14:46] it produced the doctrine that we know
[14:49] today as the doctrine
[14:51] of the trinity
[14:55] on all forms of satanic worship
[15:00] that flowed from that
[15:04] now the hermes is interesting
[15:08] you see after god
[15:12] confused the languages
[15:15] of men at babel hermes
[15:19] or cush the father of nimrod
[15:23] made it his great effort
[15:28] to unite those languages in rebellion to
[15:31] god
[15:33] he told the people how he could he he
[15:36] could
[15:36] unite their languages cause them to
[15:39] understand
[15:40] each other uh right and when they
[15:43] understand each other
[15:45] they can continue their building of this
[15:48] great babel
[15:49] right to the sky regardless of what
[15:52] elohim said to them
[15:56] and there we understand that in fact was
[16:00] a
[16:00] cunning attempt of satan
[16:03] working through cush to
[16:07] uh get the people to rebel against
[16:11] god and the way of god god divided their
[16:15] tongues
[16:16] and now he is telling them it's a good
[16:18] thing like he told eve
[16:20] it's a good thing if i can unite you
[16:23] so you can understand each other and we
[16:26] can
[16:26] bring you into a unity but it's a false
[16:30] made unity which is not of god
[16:34] this is what is happening to the
[16:36] denominations
[16:38] this is the great division of tongues
[16:43] god cause allowed that to happen
[16:46] but he know in our modern age
[16:49] is forming a world council of churches
[16:53] and his attempt is to unite the tongues
[16:56] the united nations unite these demon
[17:00] nations
[17:01] and get them to speak
[17:04] or say the same language in other words
[17:07] we will put one doctrinal statement
[17:10] and everybody will have to ascribe to
[17:14] that statement
[17:15] and therefore we will be speaking as one
[17:19] of course they're not saying they will
[17:22] not stand for
[17:23] anyone else to disagree
[17:27] and tell them that's not the truth the
[17:30] truth is there is one
[17:32] god and his name is jesus christ
[17:35] same yesterday today and
[17:38] forever amen we know
[17:42] friends god started
[17:45] one original church
[17:48] one original faith
[17:52] and as in genesis so is it in the new
[17:55] testament
[17:56] that one original church was divided
[18:00] up into nations denominations
[18:05] and cause religious chaos
[18:09] and confusion for every one of those
[18:12] denominations
[18:14] are speaking different tongues different
[18:17] languages
[18:18] different doctrine different teachings
[18:21] contrary
[18:22] to each other but now he is telling them
[18:26] he's going to bring them into a unity
[18:30] he's going to use the world council of
[18:32] churches to do that
[18:35] you see he unites them by discipline
[18:40] by uh trying into jail all those
[18:44] who will not say what he is saying what
[18:47] he is teaching
[18:49] see god unites by the revelation of his
[18:53] word
[18:55] unites by
[18:59] his discipline and rigor
[19:03] and false sense of unity arising
[19:07] from his denomination denominationalism
[19:11] yes my friends and he does it
[19:15] just like nimrod did
[19:19] why do you nominational discipline
[19:22] i remember many years ago as a young
[19:26] man uh getting into a denomination
[19:30] and hearing them saying don't you
[19:33] mix and mingle with those other churches
[19:36] out there i or don't you speak
[19:39] to them don't do this and don't do that
[19:44] but god's hand was upon my life already
[19:47] and so i didn't care about that i was
[19:49] friendly with
[19:50] everybody but when it came to what i
[19:53] believed
[19:54] i told them what i believe and some
[19:56] turned away from me
[19:58] and others still good friends of mine
[20:01] but they
[20:02] know what i stand for and i'm not
[20:05] pulling any punches i tell them what's
[20:07] the truth
[20:08] and praise god there's a way you can
[20:11] tell
[20:11] people the truth with love paul said
[20:13] speak the truth in love
[20:15] you don't have to be obnoxious and
[20:17] overbearing
[20:19] amen we can disagree but you don't have
[20:22] to be
[20:23] disagreeable you just have to have the
[20:27] love of god in your hearts and realize
[20:30] that the
[20:30] people in themselves they themselves
[20:34] have been led astray by these
[20:37] teachings of man contrary
[20:40] to the word of god yes
[20:44] so they give them religious training
[20:46] training for baptism
[20:49] training for uh confirmation
[20:53] training for this and training for that
[20:56] discipline for this and discipline for
[20:59] that
[20:59] drilling this and drilling you into
[21:02] bible verses and drilling
[21:03] drilling drilling drilling all the time
[21:06] until
[21:07] everybody becomes into a uniformity
[21:11] and saying the same thing
[21:14] amen listen my friends one god
[21:19] and the true prophets will say the same
[21:21] thing
[21:22] but they're saying it not because it was
[21:24] drilled into them
[21:25] but they receive it by revelation from
[21:28] the presence of god
[21:30] and because god cannot change his word
[21:34] his first revelation is the original
[21:37] revelation
[21:38] founded in the word of god amen
[21:41] so we find out
[21:44] armies who history also
[21:48] calls mercury
[21:51] bell and he was also called
[21:55] uh janus these are all names
[21:59] of of the one person see
[22:02] cush who had these
[22:05] names in various uh cultures
[22:09] like that and so he introduced himself
[22:13] of hermes also means interpreter
[22:18] of the gods or interpreter of the words
[22:22] of god
[22:23] so he introduced himself that he is
[22:26] going to
[22:26] in interpret god's word
[22:29] for the people bell now
[22:34] court which is cush the father
[22:37] of nimrod was the ring leader
[22:42] that led the people away from the true
[22:45] god
[22:46] and encouraged the people to see him
[22:51] as the interpreter of
[22:54] the gods he is the one who encouraged
[22:58] them
[22:58] to go ahead with the building of the
[23:02] tower
[23:03] of babel and initiated
[23:07] all of that building but his son was the
[23:10] one that
[23:10] actually built the city of babylon
[23:14] he also encouraged the confusion
[23:19] and division of men
[23:22] at first so hermes meaning
[23:27] confuser and
[23:30] interpreter so on one hand he seems to
[23:34] interpret
[23:35] on the other hand he seems to be
[23:37] confusing
[23:38] this is very much from which the word
[23:42] came called hermeneutics
[23:46] hermeneutics which is something
[23:49] i studied while in the denominational
[23:53] uh college yes that is what they're
[23:56] teaching to
[23:57] this day in the religious universities
[24:01] and colleges
[24:02] hermeneutics teaching man
[24:05] how to be interpreters right
[24:09] and you see my friends god is his own
[24:13] interpreter
[24:14] he will make the word of god plain and
[24:17] clear
[24:18] to you if thou canst believe
[24:21] all things are possible to them
[24:24] that believe praise god made this
[24:28] study from history and
[24:32] the facts that we are seeing make sense
[24:35] to you and
[24:36] lay a foundation for what next
[24:39] we will be studying in the future
[24:44] now friends this is what the theologians
[24:48] of today
[24:50] are uh presenting themselves as
[24:54] that they are the interpreters of the
[24:56] word
[24:57] and uh if they can interpret any which
[25:00] way they want to interpret it
[25:02] but god's word does not change
[25:06] it remains the same you cannot interpret
[25:09] it differently
[25:11] but you stay with the word for god's
[25:14] word is not a private interpretation but
[25:17] by the holy
[25:18] spirit bringing the word to ca
[25:21] pass so kush now
[25:25] named hermes carl bell also named janus
[25:31] yes he actually
[25:34] was the originator and father of this
[25:37] polytheistic
[25:38] system which nimrah took
[25:42] up and expanded it
[25:45] for it was only one place in the earth
[25:49] but nimrod through war and true
[25:52] going to the various nations was able to
[25:56] expand it
[25:58] yes clearly friends
[26:01] we see here this confounder
[26:04] of the nations this one
[26:07] who destroyed the people by his
[26:11] strategies
[26:12] of warfare that he used
[26:16] now janus one of his names
[26:20] means two-faced
[26:23] so he is the two-faced god and that's
[26:26] what satan is
[26:28] religious on one side and the devil and
[26:32] ungodly
[26:32] on the other side and you'll find that
[26:35] in his children
[26:36] also very hypocritical because
[26:39] on one hand act like a christian
[26:42] move like a christian then go out
[26:46] amen like i say to my people singing the
[26:49] songs in the church
[26:51] reading out of the bible praising god on
[26:54] a sunday
[26:54] and then go out and live like a devil on
[26:58] the monday
[26:58] tuesday wednesday thursday come back
[27:01] again
[27:02] to be like a christian be like an angel
[27:05] on the sunday and go back to being a
[27:08] devil
[27:08] on the monday my god have mercy but that
[27:12] is what we
[27:13] face in our world today
[27:17] so this two-face janus
[27:20] this hermes this thief and liar
[27:26] this one who loves warfare and thank god
[27:30] we fight not against flesh and blood but
[27:32] against principalities
[27:34] powers and spiritual wickednesses in
[27:37] high places
[27:38] my god thank god forevermore
[27:41] amen so here we find out
[27:46] that it is said that he
[27:49] constantly rebelled against
[27:53] the one true god now believing in one
[27:56] god is called
[27:59] monotheism mono
[28:05] m-o-n-o-t-h-e-i-s-m
[28:06] which is completely opposite to
[28:09] poly theism right
[28:12] so he was rebelling against
[28:17] one god and the doctrine and teaching
[28:21] of one god so this
[28:24] worship of many gods
[28:27] we find out where it came from it came
[28:31] from
[28:31] kush nimrat's father
[28:34] was in babel which
[28:38] nimrod came later and turned into a
[28:40] magnificent city called
[28:42] babylon and went out from
[28:45] which was the beginning of his kingdom
[28:48] went out from there with his arts of war
[28:52] which he learned the techniques and
[28:54] strategies
[28:55] from his hunting days of hunting animals
[28:59] and turned his hunting abilities to
[29:02] hunting men and killing
[29:06] men and therefore he conquered
[29:09] everywhere that he went
[29:12] and by starting that religion of the
[29:15] worship of many gods
[29:18] then he became known as father
[29:22] of the gods because he started
[29:25] that religion so he is the father or
[29:28] elder or ancestor of that particular
[29:32] religion of polytheism
[29:36] now there we find out friends
[29:40] from there came ancestor washington
[29:44] because they began to worship him
[29:48] from there came the communion of saints
[29:51] because their worship their ancestors
[29:55] even after their dead of course we know
[29:58] in our bible
[29:59] for you to speak to the dead or pray to
[30:02] the dead the bible calls it
[30:04] necromancy it's witchcraft
[30:07] it's called necromancy and the biggest
[30:10] witchcraft operation we have today
[30:13] is praying to the so-called saints
[30:17] which are dead and we are not to pray to
[30:20] the dead somebody says oh
[30:22] well brother simon jesus died how come
[30:24] you pray to him
[30:25] well he said i am he that was dead but
[30:28] behold i am alive forevermore
[30:32] so he is not dead he lives forever more
[30:35] it's as much as saying you can kill god
[30:37] you can't
[30:38] god is not dead jesus christ is not dead
[30:42] and god can't die it's impossible so we
[30:46] pray to him who the eternal one
[30:49] and bless his holy name every other man
[30:52] you will read it in the bible and he you
[30:55] he lived for so many hundred years and
[30:57] he died
[30:58] so and so was great in the land and he
[31:01] did this
[31:01] this there's a history about and he died
[31:04] and you will read that throughout the
[31:07] bible
[31:08] come into human history you read the
[31:10] same thing
[31:11] and he died and over and over again he
[31:14] was a great warrior he was a great
[31:16] general
[31:17] he was a great king and he did this and
[31:20] he accomplished that
[31:21] and he died but of jesus christ
[31:25] hallelujah that killed him at calvary
[31:28] but behold he rose from the dead
[31:32] and says i am the resurrection and the
[31:35] life
[31:36] he that liveth and believeth in me
[31:38] though he was dead
[31:40] yet shall he also live
[31:43] oh praise god i'm so glad we serve a
[31:46] mighty god
[31:48] an ever living god an eternal god
[31:51] to him be all the praise the honor
[31:55] and the glory it was crushed
[32:00] who first introduced the belief
[32:04] in three gods a triune god
[32:09] or a god in unity tree
[32:13] gods in unity each
[32:16] equal to one another so they called it
[32:21] almost with of the same substance
[32:25] together the one god now
[32:28] that's what they he introduced
[32:31] and he taught that a father
[32:34] son and spirit he taught it in the form
[32:37] of
[32:37] father son and spirit of course now we
[32:41] have it
[32:42] as the father the son
[32:45] and the holy ghost but back then when he
[32:48] started it
[32:49] it was father son and spirit
[32:53] right and then
[32:56] he also knew about the seed of the woman
[33:00] promised by god in genesis
[33:03] chapter 3 i believe verse 18.
[33:08] and so something had to come out of that
[33:12] he had to have a representation and a
[33:15] picture of that
[33:16] well it came to pass that nimrod
[33:20] with all his so-called greatness died
[33:24] and his wife as we said before
[33:28] was semiramis
[33:32] and samuramas made herself
[33:36] mother of the son
[33:39] mother of cush's son
[33:42] that is her claim of course she was
[33:45] married to that son
[33:46] but now she says she is the mother of
[33:50] that son that means she
[33:54] became and elevated herself to the
[33:57] position
[33:57] of mother of the gods because
[34:01] cush who was the father of the gods
[34:04] was now dead nimrod the son
[34:07] of the gods was now dead and now here
[34:11] she comes
[34:12] mother of the gods
[34:15] exactly as we see
[34:19] churches today are propounding
[34:22] and defying mary
[34:26] and claiming that mary was without sin
[34:31] and that mary is the mother
[34:35] of god and claiming
[34:39] that she is the one
[34:43] that was actually uh caught
[34:46] up into the heavens supernaturally
[34:50] and therefore we look back
[34:54] and see the contrast with the bible
[34:59] and see how the doctrine of the holy
[35:02] assumption
[35:03] of mary being assumed into heaven it
[35:06] didn't come from the bible it came from
[35:08] babylon
[35:10] it came from the ancient past
[35:13] thousands of years ago in the darkness
[35:16] of idolatry and paganism
[35:18] here comes this evil doctrine now
[35:21] accepted in the modern
[35:22] times paganism has intertwined itself
[35:26] into christianity
[35:27] until christianity is now bastardized
[35:32] and it's been infiltrated and polluted
[35:36] by the sins of man and
[35:39] sins rooted in the idolatries
[35:43] of the past of course
[35:47] soon they have her as the one trampling
[35:51] on the serpent's head
[35:53] and the bible says he the messiah
[35:56] will trample on the serpent's head but
[35:59] if you were to go
[36:00] searching a lot of the history books and
[36:02] look at the pictorials different places
[36:04] you will find they have mary stamping on
[36:08] the serpent's head
[36:10] contrary to the word of god but in
[36:12] agreement with babylonian history
[36:15] and depiction they called her
[36:20] queen of heaven samurais
[36:23] was called queen of heaven today
[36:26] they have mary she is called queen
[36:30] of heaven they made semiramis divine
[36:36] today they're preaching talking that
[36:40] mary
[36:42] is divine and are so blasphemous to say
[36:47] that she is the mother of god she is
[36:51] not the mother of god how could god have
[36:54] a mother
[36:55] the eternal being the eternal one
[36:58] amen god has no mother
[37:01] no sir we will not discuss that now
[37:05] but that is contrary to the word of god
[37:08] amen mary who was the mother of jesus
[37:12] the body that god
[37:14] used to express himself
[37:17] they have now elevated uh
[37:20] mary
[37:24] and they said mary has immortality
[37:27] in other words she has eternal life just
[37:30] like jesus or
[37:31] god god has they made her immortal
[37:38] and she i think it was september 1964
[37:43] they were discussing that to confer
[37:46] think about that man is going to confer
[37:50] on other humans immortality
[37:54] oh just think about that my friends
[37:57] then they
[38:00] call her mary the media tricks
[38:04] the media tricks now we know the bible
[38:09] tells us there is only
[38:10] one god and one mediator
[38:13] between god and man and his
[38:17] name is jesus christ amen
[38:20] and amen praise god hallelujah
[38:24] mary the mother so-called
[38:28] of all believers and now she is also
[38:31] called
[38:32] mary the mother of the church
[38:37] if there was ever a such a thing as
[38:40] babylonian
[38:42] ancestor worship going on in religion
[38:46] it is right now in the religion
[38:51] that issues forth from rome
[38:56] not only was ancestor
[38:59] worship originated in babylon
[39:04] but so also was the worship of nature
[39:07] mother earth mother nature
[39:10] father nature uh you know
[39:13] they began to worship nature and people
[39:16] began to worship trees and animals and
[39:19] different things of that nature and many
[39:22] gods the soon the sun the moon
[39:24] were identified later on as gods
[39:27] worshipped by egyptians and
[39:29] other cultures begin to worship them
[39:33] and so here it was friends
[39:36] when the sun began to be worshipped
[39:40] an egyptian called the sun ra
[39:43] and then we find he was called
[39:48] beal according to ancient
[39:51] history the sun god
[39:55] was baal right you will read of him in
[39:58] the bibles
[39:59] in your scriptures and you'll read it
[40:02] there
[40:03] and there it is friends and finally
[40:07] satan's heart's desire was fulfilled
[40:11] to be worshiped as a light giver
[40:16] reaching his light is not the true light
[40:19] but the light he gives
[40:21] is darkness in the hearts of man
[40:24] when he seduced the whole world
[40:28] like he seduced eve now he is using
[40:31] those same
[40:32] lies and rumors and darkness to seduce
[40:36] the entire earth in which we live
[40:41] now how did pergamos become the seat
[40:44] of babylon the seat of satan
[40:49] now babylon fell after a while
[40:53] militaristically it fell
[40:56] and when it fell at that time
[40:59] they had a the new king was attolos
[41:04] atulos and he was the
[41:08] pontifex maximus
[41:11] which means to say priest king
[41:15] or king and priest
[41:18] pontifex maximus anatolus
[41:23] who was the king of babylon the
[41:27] pontifex maximus of babylon
[41:30] or shall we say the priest king
[41:34] of babylon he fled
[41:37] to the borders of rome
[41:40] and fled with his pagan
[41:44] priests and with all their
[41:48] writings and so-called sacred
[41:52] mysteries and set up his kingdom
[41:55] just outside of the roman
[41:58] empire and tribed under the care
[42:04] of the devil right there
[42:07] my friends in conclusion
[42:11] we found out the origins of satanic
[42:16] warship
[42:18] we have discovered who
[42:22] how christian nimrod introduced
[42:26] the various idolatry
[42:30] the arts of war the strategies the
[42:33] drilling
[42:34] how to set up an army it was nimrod
[42:38] that first did it according to the bible
[42:44] we found also the origins
[42:49] of polytheism and science and invention
[42:54] what the bible tells us about the
[42:57] inventors
[42:58] of evil things
[43:02] the origins of polytheism or the trinity
[43:05] doctrine
[43:06] we also found the origin
[43:10] of ancestor worships today it's called
[43:13] communion of saints dead saints
[43:17] now think of it you should not pray to
[43:20] the dead
[43:20] we should not talk to the dead oh
[43:24] well that's for them to bring up
[43:25] different things in the bible that's
[43:27] another matter of discussion
[43:29] but jesus is alive thanks be to god
[43:32] amen they introduced meditative worship
[43:36] on the earth
[43:37] all these religions with meditative type
[43:40] of of worship
[43:42] on the earth they introduce
[43:46] the worship of mother earth
[43:49] and the worship of nature
[43:53] they also most importantly introduce
[43:57] woman worship the worship of
[44:00] women and this is what satan did
[44:04] by placing samurais who
[44:07] later is now called
[44:10] mary they are equating her
[44:14] to mary and worshipping semoramus
[44:18] under the giants of worshipping mary who
[44:22] is not to be worshipped
[44:24] only jesus christ is to be worshiped for
[44:27] if i be lifted up i
[44:29] will draw all men unto me
[44:32] there's only one god on the side me
[44:35] there is no other
[44:37] the only one god to be glorified
[44:40] and magnified but the introduced or
[44:43] there
[44:44] in putting in the minds of men by and
[44:47] women or people by worshiping mary
[44:50] subconsciously people are made
[44:53] to worship women or to worship
[44:57] a woman and come to that place
[45:00] where they can now place her in a
[45:02] position of rulership
[45:04] and dominance like that
[45:07] in that way also we learned
[45:11] how their worship
[45:14] of the red dragon the worship of
[45:16] serpents
[45:17] as we saw in the temple in pergamus
[45:22] that they literally were worshiping
[45:25] a living serpent in bergamos
[45:30] this is a lot of history here but i
[45:34] hope that you have noted these things
[45:40] and that they have laid in your hearts
[45:42] some
[45:44] foundations that we
[45:47] might understand the rest of the church
[45:50] ages
[45:53] and the times in which we live that we
[45:56] will be able to understand it better
[45:59] and some of the things around us may the
[46:02] lord
[46:02] bless you thank you for your time
[46:06] thank you for receiving into your heart
[46:09] the word of god for this day and for
[46:13] this
[46:13] hour we will be back next week
[46:16] to continue our study
[46:19] in the church ages trusting that god
[46:24] will bless us together as one in
[46:28] jesus christ and may god
[46:33] bring us to a place where we will begin
[46:36] to study how
[46:37] god denounced pergamos
[46:41] and the unbelief that was in pergamos
[46:45] where satan's seat was
[46:48] god bless you real good and let us come
[46:51] once again
[46:52] next wednesday around the word of god to
[46:56] continue
[46:57] our study of the seven
[47:01] church ages god bless
