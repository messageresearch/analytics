this dedication that these parents have come and they are offering their child to the lord before the child is conscious of anything they are placing the child in the hands of god doesn't mean the

real good our gracious heavenly father we thank you for these two parents who have surrendered their lives to thee we pray in the name of jesus that you will first of all bless them keep them provide for them father and keep them in the way of the war word so that they may be able to protect provide and guide these children in the pathway of life we commit now the child into your hands and as your representative holding this child before this congregation i pray that the great holy spirit of living god will come upon this child at this time and the child will become familiar with this presence

she was in germany and she's come back bless you god bless you praise the lord you know you know ladies they don't like those kinds of things it's kind of sensitive draw attention to themselves but

well it's good to be here again isn't it thanks be to god we're so happy that we can be in the house of the lord on the lord's day i am so excited to come back into god's house yesterday i was online and uh they were taking not taking part but just observing the um passing on the funeral of a dear brother brother chico damon of guyana one like i said one of my early converts i come i checked the time i was 20 years old and uh he was converted in a ministry and god dealt with him you know he did the very things the brothers are doing now playing to get to our bless help he was a real good guitarist well known in the country for playing the guitar and he was supportive of the ministry and was a you know leading the worship sometimes playing the songs there were several of them so he was just one but finally he became the pastor of his little church back in the very village where he was the only con convert from that village and he went back there started a church and god blessed him now i looked look back and i see the pictures of what he actually did there built a new church and it's nice and painted up and nice and to see the amounts of people and the grandkids and kids and god blessed him with a very with a tribe of children and i say that because he had about 12 of them so um you imagine the amount of grandchildren from that and so it was a real representation to see some of the other older ministers that were there brother greene was on there and brother nelson was on there and others were there bearing witness to the walk and testimony brother lee was there of this brother's life and what god used him to do and we give god glory for him praise the lord i would like to for us now to turn our attention to a ver very familiar scripture which we all know in revelation uh chapter 12 verses 7 to 12. revelation 12 7-12 hallelujah let us read together and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not well you think in light of gates of hell shall not prevail against the church and neither was their place found any more there's a that is happening right now while we speak that many there's no place found for them as the bible says judas went out and hanged himself because there was no place for him couldn't find his position or place because he he didn't fit in the body he started started to show now amen manifesting time where we stand from the inside out and the great dragon was cast out the old serpent that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accused of our of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death therefore rejoice you heavens and you that dwell therein woe unto the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knew it that he had but a short time amen god bless the reading of his word father we commit ourselves to you as we have read the word now we pray he will apply the word apply the token of the word of our to our hearts that we may rejoice in thee and live now and forevermore in jesus name amen and amen praise the lord god bless you i want to thank god for you who are here in the house of the lord to identify yourself with the message of this hour because it's becoming more and more difficult for you to do so uh for you to carry the reproach for the word uh you see you apply that to the word back there preached by jesus which is true you apply that to the word preached back there by the prophet which is true you must make a reproach for the word but you realize jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever so you have to bear the reproach for the word that you are even receiving now you got to carry the reproach for of for that word you are hearing now amen because as you know we've been preaching on the eternal church age we've been talking about the capstone ministry and we've been talking about how if you have an eternal church age then you have to have an eternal messenger to that age now of course we know god only let the prophet use that term because for you human to us humans to understand um when you say age you know that that's a period of time but this eternal and age the two words going together god just had to allow that right because one speaks of time and the other one speaks of eternity but for you to understand because you come through seven ages so he just said eternal church age at the end of the seals that's when people are going to start to go back and stuff like that i'm starting to preach but that's good because here to get in the spirit before you do anything before you accomplish anything for god you must get in the spirit amen today i'd like to talk about this great angel of the covenant the angel of uh in exodus 32 33 34 whom jesus said my angel is set to lead you he will lead you and guide you and protect you we know that same angel was the pillar of fire we know that same angel had the covenant over his head and the bible calls him the angel of the covenant revelation 10 1 mighty angel came down with a rainbow around his head and his feet were like pillars of fire the spirit of god so surrounded him that when he came down the book which was in the hand of god on the throne that was shut up with seven seals and the lamb took the book but when we see the lamb in his other roll we see him coming down as the angel of the covenant because here it comes with the book not closed but the book is now open and it's in the hand not of the lamb that you saw there but in the hand of this angel of the covenant it's the same one just changing his roles just changing his title amen so this angel of the covenant is come back to us and prophesied according to revelation 10 1 to 7 malachi 4 5 and luke 17 30 and 31 amen how that the word would come back to us in the last day especially the word would be restored back to god's people and he's telling you in what form what shape what it's going to and morph itself and then reveal itself back to us it'll come back to us in the form of this mighty angel of the covenant hallelujah of course the covenant is the agreement that god and pro and promises god has between himself and his people that is to say the angel of the word angel of the covenant just means angel of the word and the word of course brother branham says you know angel there is angels of earth which are man and there were angels of heaven right this mighty great angel he's not a man of the earth but he is the lord from heaven come down he said that was the second that was the coming of christ himself hallelujah therefore this mighty angel that we look at this great covenant angel he says and the word angel really means messenger so when you say angel of the covenant you are saying messenger of the word messenger of the word hallelujah praise god just just remember these things that for seven ages god sent prophets he sent various uh men reformers to bring his word but brother branham said in the end god became his own prophet hallelujah god become his own messenger god became the one speaking for himself but let's go back before time began let's go back before the beginning where the bible tells us in this book of revelation and there was war in heaven what was it like in heaven before the beginning absolutely we find out as isaiah tells us if you will search the book of isaiah you will find in there him telling this telling about how lucifer was there how he was a beautiful angel powerful angel how he was a great singer and worship leader and how he led the pipes when he let the flutes and he led all the instruments well you can see when revelation genesis begins to tell us his descendants from the time they hit the earth they start to create instruments all kind of instruments and organs and this and that they come begin to create it they were great anyway that's he was the leader over all of the worship and he describes heaven with all the beautiful precious stones and everything else like that of course we find out that he used his position instead of using to worship and glorify god he was doing it but while he was doing it he had deceit in his heart because he started a whisper campaign he is one of the whisperers spoken of in the bible for psalms proverbs uh over there in some of the prophets speak of these people that like to peep and whisper and mutter right like that and then he refers them to like the necromancers and the wizards and witches loving to whisper and so on like that whisperers which god doesn't like whisperers if you got to say something say it plain if you can't say it in front the person shut up don't go behind us whispering and so he started a whisper campaign as we say on earth behind god's back there's no such a thing no you're going to get behind his back but he thought he could get behind god's back and start to miss which means showing that he really really believe that god is who he says he is omniscient omnipresent knowing all seeing all whatnot and you know everything like that he's not really believing the depths of his heart and his beauty outside was just a mask to cover up the evil that was in him right and we see that everywhere right so he started this whisper campaign and this whisper campaign was made up of uh rumors usually when you try to track them down you don't know where it started you don't know who first said it because it's just a rumor that went out there and the rumor is based on innuendo which it's not somebody come out plainly and say something no uh it's just a little hint it's another word you can use there they just give you just a little hint or or inference or an intimation some kind of a suggestion right it's just suggested in that way behind the scenes and when that all that start to accumulate and you've seen some of this over in the united states if i might frankly speak it start with one little tiny inference and just go on and start to build and build and build until it grabs a hole of the consciousness of the people and then it comes out as a big lie but before he tell the big lie he told some tiny tales that's why brother branham said a lot of people think that the devil has tails like they're seeing those pictures he got a fork tail like that he said but it's not those tails that me he told tales in heaven he told little lies until their lies accumulate and build up amen and then he could he could uh openly now start to tell a lying story but he started with those behind the scenes things and fabrications that he started to make up and now you're going to find a lot of false religions are made up of a lot of mythology full of mythologies when you read them it's just tales it's things that uh satan inspire some man or somebody to write about something they saw and it ends up being some man-made tales made by man not a one of them is based on the fullness of the word of god if it was then they come to this world amen and they'll know him in the power of his resurrection hallelujah amen yes sir so he start to tell this little lies you know if you know god is dead god if they had even thought about it god dead how do the two things go together that god could die but he told that lie god is dead right then you tell this other lie it's all in the bible there is no god right not was he just like us we all the same thing oh we all gods so there's no real god sure so he says there is no god the bible said the fool says in his heart that there is no god then for those ones that still want to go on believing that there is a god he says yeah well even if there is a god he's a god of judgment he's a god of he has no mercy he'll send you to hell burn you in the pit of fire without any mercy whatsoever and not only that he brings hurricanes he brings earthquake he brings sickness he brings virus and disease and even kill your your loved ones god kill them and take them away from you how can you say god is love meanwhile they're listening to one of the biggest criminals the world has ever seen one of the biggest liars the world has ever known amen when he is the one that lights the fire turn around and says god light the fire and i'm going to put it out so i can look like a good guy right that's what he does so he brings the hurricanes he the bible the prophet said ten thousand devils stirred up that storm that wanted to take down the boat that jesus was in he said you could hear them howling in the winds you could hear them screaming even you might be able to hear them sometimes during the winter when that wind begins to scream and how and there it was the devil bringing all these hurricanes earthquakes disaster pain heartaches grief death killing the people destroying them and then he turns around and he wants to blame god and say god is the one that is really doing that amen of course he is the one that started the war that in heaven you know but and there was war in heaven who started the war satan amen satan started the war and that is why his worship as the god of mars which meaning god of war right he started all wars to this minute and let me throw in all wars start in heaven as such either in the literal heaven or in this one right this part here it's got to start here first before it becomes physical altercation any anger anything it's a war in your mind and it has to start there before it translates into physical action right always the case like that amen so he is the god of war hallelujah and when god was ready god of course had to respond to his actions of subversion he started to subvert the kingdom of god hallelujah many years ago i preached a message on that subversion of the kingdom of god and showing that the devil and his actors usually come in the church and try to subvert the word and the messenger whoever he is in the house of god the representative god they want to subvert that and and subvert the power in the kingdom and tear it down with his strategy of strike the head and all the sheep will be scattered always the case of satan pulling that trick amen and so god was now going to act against what satan was doing and the bible reads and there was war in heaven for for there to be war you gotta have two contestants one just can't go warren with himself like paul said you know you fight and abuse and and and bite and envying and strife among your own cells and you know the devil spirit is like that even the devils without us preaching the word they're constantly fighting one another they're constantly cursing swearing they're constantly killing and abusing one another they don't need you to do that that's the nature to do that they're evil they're wicked amen and when they get somebody innocent believing god then they find a mutual uh a mutual person or thing that they can all come like wolves and attack that individual right but their nature is to be like that and they're fighting one another amen so this war there was war in heaven the war was a war of supernatural beings supernatural beings and in that war we know the bible tells us lucifer was defeated hallelujah you see brother brown said if god did something once he has to keep doing that same thing all the time so we are assured no matter where satan raises his head whatever he tries to do the bible said he was kicked out of heaven he was defeated by the holy spirit and every time he raise your his head whether in society within your life your family he is defeated by the word of god in the name of jesus christ he said god can't do something one time and don't continue to do that same thing all the time every time right back to eternity it has to be that way because god is perfect in everything he do so the devil is defeated what happens with because we are human we have this mental thing we have to deal with and we we have to deal with the truth the truth doesn't change the devil is defeated but the devil will play in your mind oh you know but i see this lump still on my hand even though the word tells me i'm healed oh i i feel this playing on your five senses i'm not going to preach on that i'm just past passing by this yeah he's going to play on those he's a master of playing on those five senses then he'll go and he'll give you an imagination either that you're already sick and laying in your bed or an imagination that you can't walk he throws that on your mind so strong that your mind tells your body and your body can't do it no more amen tells you i can't see tell your ears you can't hear oh it looks like you're losing your hearing amen the devil and tell you oh looks like you're losing your mind and so and the moment you start believing and receiving that of course it starts going into effect that's not my topic today i just happened to be passing by there but he kicked out to heaven and the bible tells us there were the devil and all the angels that followed him were kicked out upon the earth in jesus said and i looked and i saw satan fall from heaven like lightning amen jesus is testifying that this literally happened and satan was kicked out and cast out that's not a story that's not mythology that is the word of god that he was kicked out of heaven light lightning and fell to the earth hallelujah the moment he fell to the earth woe to the to you on the earth for the devil your has come down and he knows he has what a short time amen praise god remember a thousand years is like a day to god and the devil being up there in heaven so seven thousand years it's just like a week to him right so he just go on like that right so here we do he knows his time is short and whatever evil he has to do he has to do it quick right he has to do it fast and that's why the devil and his people always like to be moving fast moving moving where you come from satan from going to and fro throughout the earth he is not omniscient and omnipotent like god he only can be one place at one time so he has to be quick all over the place so he can see and know everything so be able to yeah right he got to make it up with speed and running around and rushing around and god turns around and tells people don't worry about rushing around i'll tell you what to do be still and know be still and i'm going to let you know right and once you know you'll know how to act you have to rush and then after you rush around for days then you'll find out and then you're going to go and act no stop and ask him because he knows everything and let him talk to you hallelujah but the w think when he dropped down here he stopped fighting the war never ended the war now gone into another level because he dropped to the earth and he started to deceive the human race and of course at that time the human race was two people adam and eve and he looked for the weakest link in the chain the weakest weakest point so he knows that the man's weakness is his wife because he loves her and if he threaten the wife the man is going to do what he tells him because he want to save his wife and so he went and deceived uh eve hallelujah and true eve he started to blind the entire human race to the word of god he started to blind them and by blinding them he was start he he was able to put his coils and wrap around them and bind them so they were blinded and then they were bound and then after they were bound he was able to take them and cast them into his prison all right the whole human race imprisoned in satan's dungeons of sin dungeons of sin and later we will later on speak of those oh my as it was up there in heaven when the bible says and there was war in heaven and satan and his angels began to fight against god and the bible tells us god sent forth whom michael the archangel and michael with the rest of the angels fought against lucifer the great dragon called satan the old serpent fought against him and his angels and there were defeated and cast out of heaven amen hallelujah once again brother the war is here on earth and look i tell you we can easily sing the song michael roll the ball to shore hallelujah praise god michael roll this boat ashore we're floating down the stream of time we have not long to stay amen but praise god war in heaven war again on the earth once again michael comes on the scene with the angels of the living god to fight against the devil and all of his angels amen praise god michael take care of that problem genesis 3 verse 15. god said but the seed of the woman was going to bruise the serpent head all to the same problem you create i'm going to bring a savior i'm going to bring a deliverer i'm going to bring a root and a branch that's going to defeat you again in the name of jesus christ hallelujah amen hallelujah that seed is going to be known as the redeemer he's going to be known as the messiah he's going to be known as your savior praise god to deal with your invasion of sin he's going to deal with it hallelujah so friends we are now engaged in this part in the engagement of the greatest battle that was ever fought we are just in another stage of the same battle that we are in and we are soldiers in the armies of the lord praise god where we come from you come not from time but from eternity because you are the seeds of god you are in god you are in the mind of god you know the scripture where were you when this morning star sang together and the sons of god shouted for joy but where were you when the war took place in heaven whose side were you on when you were up there who did you fight with when you was up there did you fight on god's side did you fight on the side of the world did you fight along with michael to defeat the devil and his angels hallelujah your actions down here shows exactly what he was doing up there because if you were a part of him up there you're going to be a part of him down there if you believed him up there you're going to believe him down here if you're fought in the war up there when you're confronted by the same old serpent the ancient old enemy again you're gonna fight against him again the same way you did as it was up there hallelujah praise god amen praise the lord well my friends since that fateful day in eden with eve in eden satan has spent thousands and thousands of years from that time and all they are engaged in is nothing good but evil because their thousands of years is spent with blinding the human race to the word of god blind you so you can't see it binding the human race and imprisoning the human race in his prisons of sin but thank god after thousands of years the bible tells us then jesus came praise god hallelujah then jesus came you know the song one sat alone beside the highway begging his eyes were blind the light the word he could not see what thy god jesus came open the eyes and made him to see the fullness of the word of the living god satan came again and on the earth defeated satan at every point and time that he met him to prove to your eyes to those who are instilling their five senses that i defeat him up there let me show you how and he does the same thing again here upon the earth that you might know that's thus saith the lord this is not some story was told how he was defeated in heaven and dropped down here because look i'm defeating him now i'm defeating him right in front of you i'm defeating him now praise god hallelujah you know he's being defeated now while i'm preaching in hawaii the prophet said don't you know it's not just the healing of the sick it's not casting out to the devils and seeing that that's good and that's supposed to happen but he says the real victory for casting out the devil is casting out unbelief from the hearts and minds of god's people that is the real victory amen praise god amen hallelujah the preaching of the revealed words sets the captives free it loses your mind it brings you out of the prison house it sets you free and it casts out the spirits of doubt and unbelief and fear out of your life out of your mind out of your family out of your existence that you might walk in the light of the world amen praise god hallelujah amen defeated satan and he is so mad you know praise god mad with his insane fury he start like forgetting himself he starts hissing around he start roaring like a like an old lion you know you know that a young lion don't have to be roaring roaring every minute he just stays in the grass and when he knows the prey passing he jumps out grabs a hole of it but the old lion already lost his teeth he lost his claws he don't have any means of being able to catch some animal so he has to roar when he keeps that noise the animals get confused and they run and sometimes they run right into him and that's how he get to feed himself he grabbed a hold of whoever runs to him and he eats that praise god so your adversary the devil goes around like a roaring lion an old roaring lion that lost his teeth lost his claws lost the means of being able to defend and so he has to go around roaring he's already defeated so here he is hissing and i've seen it casting all the devils i've seen the spirit of the devil on the people they fall on the ground and they start twisting and moving like a snake and out of their mouth comes the hissing carrying on like that amen sometimes they're snarling barking like a dog hear them barking turn on uh just the other day watching the tv and they said look the people don't even recognize what's happening they come to pass the whole world going in saying amen the devil possessing the people yeah is this person roaring and and spitting and snarling and turning on like an animal what was it it was demons and it's devils that do that on the people in them roaring you have seen them casting out them they're forming at the mouth you're foaming foaming foaming it's the devil mad and insane that again he's being kicked out that again he's being cast out again he got to go look for another new house he got to get somewhere else and so he is mad and he doesn't like it whatsoever amen yes hallelujah but this devil is a man of strategy and he knows when he try a frontal war an assault against jesus he's being defeated every single time so he takes another approach and he come to jesus master we know you're a teacher sent from god right oh my you know how he start with trying to play up on jesus's pride and position he's trying to play up like that and oh praise god any man of god knows that the devil does that oh brother simon i know you know the word and when i was a younger minister he said you know i wanted to ask what do you think about this and being a young minister you're not thinking and then you just say oh well i think so so so so the next thing you know you're in hot water because it's spread over you know i asked brother simon this and he said that he said this he told me this and he told me that and he told me this is all right i never did you just asked me something and i said well maybe it could be this it could be that could be the other but you making it a positive thing now he said this so they're asking jesus that to kind of trap him right of course i after a young preacher you get caught in that once twice how many times are they ever going to catch you with that you learn you know see you learn the hard way right right you pay it to learn praise god you gotta pay the head master pay the teacher or the principal before he admitted through that school of experience and life all right so the devil come back now they come to jesus he said master we know the word the teacher sent from god well what do you say about this and what do you see about that and jesus the bible says and jesus knowing in their heart actually who it was and what they were doing he answered them and stopped them and shut them out because they can't say nothing he said why are you asking me did not isaiah already say so so don't fight with me fight with isaiah right praise god and some of them come and say well they mark my mouth they mark his mouth and like i told you the holy spirit said that marking doesn't mean they just remember he said the scribes or those pharisees and sadducees were actually writing down what he said so that no matter how long after they can compare it and they can be able to accuse him so they're marking my mouth too now i'm saying that that not to tell you don't take notes like i explained it's the motive with which you are taking those notes right but here it is that even my mouth is marking praise god because you know i get the calls not from near here far away from here i stayed here on sunday but before you know it i'm hearing it way or somewhere else or something else right and totally different from what i actually say oh i don't believe that i don't believe there's no such thing as an eternal george age they know such a it's right there the prophet said that it's not me saying it i just repeat what he said i have my way of how i say things but did he say it or didn't he say it well i do the same thing that jesus did jesus said why you asking me did not isaiah the prophet say amen that he he was wounded he was afflicted he opened not his mouth did he not say that amen and i can say the same thing did not the prophet say page 6 that was a perfect man did he not say that he's waiting for that mad woman that man that will come to enter into that eternal church age it begins where at the ending of the seals they're going to be redeemed the man the woman that's going to be redeemed hallelujah i'm not going to preach on that because you know the real redemption is the resumption by revelation the real rapture is rapture by revelation of the word which i can't give you i'm only here preaching praise god but i can't give you you've got to have that spirit of revelation on you and you can't have it unless god give that to you in your spiritual dna your genes amen your seed life that you come from god in the beginning you come from god you're going back to god and it's embedded in you [Music] it's only now god woke up because of the spirit of almighty god hallelujah amen they're praising him with their mouth but really they were trying to embarrass him by trying to catch him with a hard question brother bran said in taking sides with jesus they use every means the devil knew he couldn't come with a frontal assault every time he'd be cast out defeated and and whether it's dead or sick they raised up the sick healed so he still continues doing that but he come with this next strategy and approach of trying the prophet said now he's going to blacken his name and they try to blacken his name and say by the way who really is your father um god the father god the holy ghost or or or the son which one is your father father son or holy ghost do you know who's oh my they're trying to tell him like i tell you they start with rumors and whispers before they come and tell an outright lie they're telling him that he's bastard born that's what they're telling him you just hear me don't even know who your father is but jesus answered them of course i and my father are one the father that dwelleth me it dwelleth in me he do at the works i'm not doing of myself he said i don't speak of myself but i speak what the father tells me to speak hallelujah praise god hallelujah so all of his attacks proved unsuccessful praise god hallelujah amen and then they had a conference in hell i know many preachers have tried to describe this conference and hell in the old days they used to even have plays about it in the churches of how the devil going to hell with this little black demons and will all and they're having their little conference in hell and their discussion in hell was well we tried the frontal assault we couldn't defeat him we try the rumors and they we try all these hints and suggestions that we can't beat him therefore you know let's try a new strategy if you can't beat him let's join him right so he sent out judas you say oh you know that well the bible says and judas that son of perdition son of hell son of satan is that right satan was he was a son a satan and you know what sonship is the father that dwelleth in me he do at the works i am the son and the father dwells in the sun and so if the sun comes and is there as a inside of jesus congregation and the father that was there before the foundations that already defeated satan in jesus is the two contestants meet up again juan and judas and one and jesus and there is a great contest taking place here again not up there in heaven but now it's right down here upon the earth amen hallelujah praise god so the conference decided now they're going to take a religious approach of faith and they're going to infiltrate and subvert the church of god claiming to have the same faith you got and that we are all one and the rest of the story you know the rest of it how judas as one of jesus's congregation one of his church members sold out the savior for gold and he sold them out for the money my oh my and he was jesus of course was crucified dead and buried and first peter if you turn in his bibles right there chapter 3 verses 18 and 19. you know the scripture but i want us to read it again hallelujah praise god hallelujah let's read for christ also had once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to god being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison i don't see here that he went and while he was going down he first had to pass through a place called purgatory it doesn't say that in here that he first had to pass through a middle ground which is being told that lie has been told to a lot of people you first have to pass through purgatory before you get right into hell right and so um if you were to pay enough money they'll be able to pray for you and so you can pass freely through purgatory bible tells us nothing of that it says he went right down into hell and the same way with heaven too absent from the body present with the lord is that right the bible says it is given unto man wants to die and after death the judgment hallelujah you're going straight on there's no delay anywhere amen praise god so stop paying for your old mother or your dad stop praying for them to to get out of that awful place because that is not the truth you're being told lies the bible says he went down uh he went and preached unto the spirits in prison which sometimes were disobedience when once the long suffering of god waited in the days of noah while the ark was a preparing wherein few that is its souls were saved by water amen praise god hallelujah look there's so many things one verse i just reading the verse and i get an arrested because you see you have you see how that verse ended up eight souls were saved by what you know someone i'm preaching that you saved by water baptism and they use the scriptures like that i'm just passing over stuff like that but that's how when you don't have revelation they go off on all kinds of things right in that nature amen so the devil can't beat so let's join them and he joined jesus's church then sold him out but jesus of course went right down to the great battle in death valley amen went down into hell and the battle continued hallelujah because the bible tells us yes i'm taking my time because this here is going to lead us to something else something else something else so here we are brothers the battle went down into hell and jesus the bible says he rose up said he only died in the flesh amen but raised and went to glory in the spirit hallelujah and how that he came back down in the form of the holy ghost and now not a one-man body but a many-membered body dwelling in the apostles christ in the apostles working through them praise god hallelujah and the battle continued you read it throughout the book of acts prison doors shake devils cast out sicknesses were healed lame crippled walks again it's the battle going on and then it tells us right there how one day paul met this woman with a spirit of divination and she came with the same old trick we know you who you are you are the servant of the most high god oh if you got pride you got all you lack any of those virtues you don't have him in you then you say oh praise god she recognized who i am and so on and you drop your guard no but the bible says paul just left leave her and leave her to go on and he's just waiting on the spirit and on the day that the spirit of god spoke to him he called the devil out of her and she had the spirit of a fight python the spirit of the devil a snake spirit a serpent demon controlled her and she was divining and speaking things from off of that spirit and they were making money off of that right off of that psychic gift that she had they were making money right and therefore once the devil casts out she can't do it no more and they got mad at paul amen and and so the battle continued from the first church h messenger right through the seven church ages it continued right through luther wesley right down into pentecost the battle between truth and era true and false the word of god versus the lives of satan right until this last day when the great messenger came on the scene and you've seen the great battle all those healing meetings what do you think that was just god showing you that he can heal he knows he can heal he don't have to prove that to you but the battle was now on earth and it was raging right in front of you that devil bring in the worst cases to him just like he did to jesus if you if you if the son of god come off the cross if you disheal yourself if you're that do this you bring a dead man let me see if he's a real prophet uh bring some blind person bring somebody that did something way back way back and the prophet will just stand there and look at them oh he says when you were a child you were under a tree i see you looking towards the west and you were thinking you didn't even talk it but i see you when you were under that tree the same one that tell nathaniel i saw you before philip even called you i saw you when you were under that fig tree and when you were telling them boys this this this that and tell him what he said and here comes a prophet stands again and say yeah yeah yeah you you you were under that tree and you were looking towards the west and you were thinking and there you were thinking this this this and at the same time you were eating corn and you started eating but you ate too much and that trouble started right then from that time and it just followed you to this point and time but in the name of jesus christ you're healed by the power of god amen hallelujah the battle continue and the devil bring up every case every case theological problems you know scriptural problems problems of sickness disease trouble death whatever it was thousands and thousands of time and to prove who it was that was in him never once wrong not one time and the voice kept trying to tell them this is not william branham this is not william branham saying this thus saith the lord hallelujah they didn't even understand who really was speaking they they they were thinking that this william brother brilliant branham standing there and just telling them well well you're healed or or this or that they didn't realize who it was where he sometimes have to say well well what did i say what did i really say he didn't even know because it wasn't him it was god speaking through his vessel the spirit speaking through the prophet defeating the devil at every point that he tried to raise his head hallelujah and so he fought against the devil and his hosts and all sad to say it but he fought alone just like jesus had to go to the garden of gethsemane and fight alone until he dripped with drops of blood fighting against the devil in every step of the way that prophet fought every step of the way hallelujah he even said i look and see my end it's coming hallelujah i have to go two of us can't be on the earth at the same time amen why because it's the coming of christ oh hallelujah oh the mighty angel of the covenant is about to come on the scene and two of us can't be here at the same time i must go i must say decrease he might increase hallelujah so he fought against the devil until he come to the crowning of his ministry the crowning time of the opening of the seven seals hallelujah the greatest privilege that mary ever had is that god had prophesied she was to be the carrier of the word in her day amen that was the crowning of our life until this day she is crowned with that honor and that blessing that she was chosen to carry the word and saw was brother branham's ministry crowned that he was the messenger promised by the word of god to carry the word and to bear the reproach for the word in this our day our time and in this age oh and he carried it boldly he carried it without shame without fear without fable amen my friends and he came to the crowning time when he was able to bring forth the seven seals remember mary did not produce christ amen he christ the word only passed through mary she was a predestinated instrument to carry the word of god in time for a time and then the word came to its own manifestation and later maturity and so was brother branham the lamb hallelujah when those seals broke we were not conscious of it then but we should have recognized that every night we were given a display that not brother branham but some body was there with brother branham and brother branham true brother branham supernaturally drawing the seven church ages on the walls showing the end time for the gentile church age now also writing on the wall that it was the lamb that broke the seals through him to the glory of god let me repeat william marian branham did not and could not of himself break open the seven seals it is written in the scriptures there came a bloody lamb that broke those shields hallelujah the lamb took the seals and broke it and here we see it replayed before our human eyes how that the lamb has broken the seals and the last seal that was broken and is being still being broken amen hallelujah because as i have said and say to you yes the seals have been broken publicly for everybody can read the books right hallelujah but saying that the seals are broken doesn't mean that it's being revealed to you that we know they're open but is it revealed to you and then if you claim oh i got the revelation then it's supposed to know prove and identify itself by making itself manifested through you broken revealed and now manifested it must manifest itself through you and that's not something that we can put on like a religious cloak or satan can go and impersonate and put it on because the third pull cannot be impersonated or copycatted because it's god testifying of his gift god testifying it's him it's me i'm in here i'm here i'm doing this i'm the one that's living in there praise god hallelujah so we're thankful to god amen hallelujah and so we are happy now praise the lord for this coming of the lord jesus christ what is the seventh seal it's he said it it's the coming of the lord himself hallelujah this is not the prophet running between the lord and the bride carrying the message no but the lord himself has descended with a shout with the voice using the voice of the archangel and the trump of god hallelujah amen praise god and his seed would be alive at this time because the bible already promised he shall see with his generation amen praise the lord god hallelujah amen of course the seventh seal you know the prophet said i'm starting to wind up now hallelujah i can't continue right now but we will as i told you a fourth time that this is going to lead from one thing into another thing right i'm following the angel i'm following the covenant on the angel i'm following the spirit of almighty god hallelujah praise god satan has taken us let me don't go ahead of myself let me finish this up and then we'll go on praise the lord hallelujah but the lord is not a man of earth he's seven m church h messengers seven of them he said them there were angels man of earth angel of the church of ephesus angel he said there were men of earth but this one he said it's the lord from heaven hallelujah this is the angel of the covenant the angel of the word himself is now here the angel of the covenant the messenger of the word hallelujah according to revelation 10 1 to 7 the angel of the open book the mighty angels this great one the messenger i repeat to the eternal church age that we are a part of praise god physically we are here in time but we are not from time we come through time and we are on our journey back to eternity the boss's son is here you believe that i believe our bridegroom has come our bright room has come and he is now whispering in our heirs he is now speaking to us and bringing his word to us hallelujah the capstone age that we are now partaking of is not in time but it is of eternity it is not of the church ages but it is of the eighth day spoken of by the prophet of malachi 4. the mighty angel uttered his voice hallelujah the prophet of malachi 4 5 has spoken amen the seven seals are open and the seven mysterious thunders of revelation are now sounding out hallelujah everywhere and once again praise god hallelujah all my friends read first seal paragraph 64-77 i'll touch upon that but not now but praise god the bridegroom's voice is once again this only the song worshipers and leaders can come now praise god once again the bridegroom's voice is once again being heard in the land hallelujah you know something anybody else's voice you can hear it that wife that girl that young woman that engaged lady she can hear everybody else's voice but when she hear that special man's voice she doesn't know we don't know what is in it but there's some sound something coming out of that voice hallelujah that trills our soul and the songs of solomon's it tells us the bridegroom's voice is heard in the land once more arise my fair one my love and come away that same voice is saying come up either come into the perfect word come into another dimension and walk in the light of the day hallelujah the war continues for the seals are open hallelujah and since i'm here opening up the word to you then let me tell you the war is still here and the war continues to this very day and to this very hour hallelujah praise god and i point you back to the word just like the prophet did hallelujah and telling you that the seven church ages are over hallelujah and that is stirring up the devil again to let you know that the seven church ages are officially announced by prophet of malachi 4 5 over and over again search it in your own bible in your computer the seven church ages are over hallelujah amen and eternal church age or the eighth day has already begun how many believe that the eternal church edge messenger is the same covenant angel that led the children of israel back there in the wilderness but here he is to guide us in the midst of this wilderness of unbelief and conflicting chaos of voices he is in the midst of it all to guide us into all truths amen go spread the tithings round the comforter has come the holy ghost from heaven oh my the father's promise that was given go and spread the titans wrong the bridegroom has come the comforter has come the word of god is on the scene the eighth day is here praise god hallelujah i haven't even come to any other quotes whatsoever i just leave them here and we'll continue on as the spirit of god will lead us and guide us for his great name oh spread the tidings wrong the comforter has come how what is the comforter supposed to do according to john the gospel of john and when he the comforters come he will guide you into all truth that means that the comforter will come in his fullness when all truth has been restored [Music] hallelujah then when all truth has been restored and it's all accumulated and brought together then this comforter comes and guides you into all truth he puts together scattered pieces of truth that was left by the prophet of malachi 4 5 he just gathered them up he just put them in the storehouse but now the angel of god comes and he says you need that for this vitamin you need that for this vitamin you need that for this vitamin you need that that and he puts together your whole seven course meal and he provides it prepares it as the great mighty chef he brings us into a seven course meal that we can partake of it and that our bodies hallelujah if you're going to go up into one of those spacecraft and you're going to go into outer space they put you inside of some tanks and some places and pressurize your body and prepare you for the journey and the same god takes us hallelujah and pressurizes you and prepares you and gives you the necessary nutriments and sustainment you need before you can be pressurized for your journey may god bless every one of us here today may the great holy spirit anoint to bless you and use you in the days that are ahead god bless you we're going to talk next week sometime god blessing us about the devil's prison house that the devil tried to put the whole human race in praise god but thank god he put me in he put you in but i'm so glad he brought me out to the my clay and put my feet on the rock to stay and i'm here to shout glory hallelujah brother god bless you god bless
