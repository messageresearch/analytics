[0:00] amen and each one of these offices have
[0:05] a few things in
[0:07] common and I think your meeting should
[0:10] meeting should not be
[0:14] together each one should meet and
[0:17] discuss in their own
[0:20] office right
[0:23] because the deacons have nothing to say
[0:26] to the
[0:28] trustees unless they've got business to
[0:31] present to
[0:32] them by say Mery the trustees have
[0:37] responsibility over the finance and the
[0:39] things of the
[0:41] building but they have nothing to do
[0:44] with the deacons for the deacons are the
[0:47] policemen of the
[0:48] church and the assistance to the
[0:52] pastor the trustees
[0:55] hold and and maintain all of the proper
[1:01] and but they have nothing to do with the
[1:04] spiritual end of it and the deacons
[1:09] likewise have nothing to do with the
[1:13] financial end of
[1:15] it therefore that's the way it must
[1:20] be the Sunday School Superintendent is
[1:23] over his Sunday school see he says I've
[1:27] got it all wrote down here
[1:30] and that ought to be wrote down typed
[1:33] and put on a bulletin
[1:35] board and we and we are also going to
[1:39] put in a frame the doctrines that this
[1:43] church stands for do you think we should
[1:44] be doing something like
[1:46] thaten amen we should put that the
[1:52] principles and the doctrines the church
[1:54] stands for for to be a church you've got
[1:59] to have doctor you got to have a doctor
[2:03] amen praise the Lord but The Minister's
[2:06] place he's got a duty to stand and
[2:09] preach the unsearchable riches of Christ
[2:12] without compromising if he's called to
[2:15] be a preacher then he will be a man that
[2:18] wouldn't spare one thing for even one
[2:20] person if he's a genuine called preacher
[2:23] amen of the word of God that's right
[2:25] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[2:28] amen uh 1 minute
[2:32] left out of the message called pergamus
[2:35] Church
[2:36] age the true
[2:38] church never been ruled by HS and has
[2:43] never changed its
[2:45] attitude not to be ruled by a church
[2:50] board I think that's page
[2:53] 60 of the pr Church age old form amen
[2:57] hallelujah
[3:00] so people today go to the church so
[3:04] wrapped up in their
[3:06] denominational till they take a trusty
[3:08] board or a de board and turn a pastor
[3:12] and twist him any way they want him to
[3:14] go but one thing they can't turn God
[3:19] that's one thing for sure for God will
[3:23] remain God forever more amen amen
[3:26] hallelujah they welcome their friends
[3:28] their politicians
[3:31] they ought to welcome Christ amen praise
[3:35] the Lord hallelujah amen the Lord do you
[3:39] glory to God uh you you you won't
[3:43] believe it but it
[3:47] wasn't just uh maybe a half an hour or
[3:51] so before I left to come to the church

[4:52] Father how thankful we are to be one of

[5:12] government and and it kind of bothers
[5:14] their Spirit they don't know how to

[5:20] God and the protection of a pastoral
[5:23] Ministry the covering of a pastoral
