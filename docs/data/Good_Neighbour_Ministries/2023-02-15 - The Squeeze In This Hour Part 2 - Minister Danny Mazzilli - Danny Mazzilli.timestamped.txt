[30:33] each and every one
[30:35] we're certainly happy to be here tonight
[30:39] every opportunity that we have to be in
[30:43] his presence
[30:47] and to invite him to come and minister
[30:50] to our needs
[30:52] is always a very special occasion
[30:55] and I trust that you have come with
[30:57] expectation in your hearts tonight
[31:00] amen getting a bit of a ring
[31:03] praise the Lord
[31:05] I spoke to Pastor Simon just a little
[31:08] while ago and he sends his greetings he
[31:11] will not be here this evening
[31:13] he says the winds are quite active he
[31:17] doesn't feel like coming over the bridge
[31:19] so he'll be listening in from home also
[31:23] brother Glenn letting us know that he'll
[31:26] be staying home with his mother keep her
[31:29] in prayer you know as she's aging and
[31:32] feeling the pressure and brother Glenn
[31:35] of course is feeling a lot of pressure
[31:37] too
[31:38] so we certainly want to keep them in
[31:40] prayer
[31:42] so first of all I like to say that I
[31:45] want to thank everybody for
[31:47] the nomination sister Jennifer and I uh
[31:51] you know are quite
[31:54] um
[31:55] surprised that uh this change is coming
[32:00] upon us
[32:01] uh we realized though that everything
[32:04] has a time and a season by the grace of
[32:07] God
[32:08] we also realize the amount of change
[32:10] that it will require
[32:13] should it be the Lord's will
[32:15] for us to be placed in that position
[32:18] it's going to take a tremendous amount
[32:21] of change in our lives
[32:22] but we also know that we're dealing with
[32:24] a living God
[32:26] that is more than able to do
[32:28] whatever he needs to have done in our
[32:32] lives I'm sure brother Tim and sister
[32:34] Deborah are quite aware of that also
[32:37] um
[32:38] we are by the grace of God
[32:41] willing
[32:43] to submit and allow the Holy Spirit to
[32:46] have his perfect will in our lives
[32:50] that's the only desire that we have
[32:53] we realize it's a
[32:56] it's a place of great responsibility
[33:00] and so we cannot take it lightly we take
[33:03] it very very serious and so we covet
[33:07] your prayers
[33:09] and trust that the Lord will have his
[33:12] way
[33:13] and I know that
[33:15] he's going to work everything out
[33:17] and it'll all work together for good
[33:20] because we love the Lord
[33:22] amen praise God we'll also be praying
[33:26] for you brother at the end of the
[33:28] service okay
[33:30] and so let's just go to prayer before we
[33:33] go to this uh to the word of God Amen
[33:36] father we're so grateful tonight
[33:39] that we as human beings
[33:42] can come into your awesome presence
[33:46] where all things are possible to them
[33:49] that believe
[33:50] and tonight Lord we come
[33:53] bringing your word reading your word
[33:57] reading the quotes of our precious
[33:59] prophet
[34:00] Lord but it's going to take your spirit
[34:02] to give it life
[34:04] and to minister to our hearts our needs
[34:08] Lord we realize the supernatural element
[34:12] of your calling upon each and every one
[34:15] of our lives
[34:16] we rely upon your instruction
[34:19] and your faith and we know that Faith
[34:22] cometh by hearing the word of God and so
[34:25] tonight we welcome you great spirit to
[34:28] take control anoint hearer and speaker
[34:32] and may you receive all the praise the
[34:35] glory and the honor in Jesus name amen
[34:39] praise God
[34:41] so we're going to continue
[34:43] um
[34:44] we uh we we ministered a message back on
[34:48] January the 4th I believe it was
[34:51] um on The Squeeze
[34:54] in this hour
[34:55] and so tonight we want to continue with
[34:58] that
[34:59] um there's there's so much that that we
[35:02] can draw from the scriptures and from
[35:05] the quotes that we'll be reading tonight
[35:08] um let us go to the scripture
[35:11] Hebrews chapter 11.
[35:15] verses 36 to 40.
[35:19] and others had trial of cruel mockings
[35:22] and scourgings Yea moreover of bonds and
[35:26] imprisonment
[35:28] they were stoned
[35:29] they were Sana Sunder were tempted
[35:32] we're slain with the sword they wandered
[35:36] about in sheepskins and goat skins being
[35:39] destitute Afflicted and tormented
[35:42] of whom the world was not worthy
[35:46] why
[35:48] because these were attributes of God
[35:51] these were the sons and daughters of God
[35:53] that had come down to the Earth
[35:56] in order to fulfill the purpose and the
[35:59] plan of God
[36:00] and God needed vessels
[36:05] that he could possess that he could
[36:07] anoint
[36:08] that he could prove to the world that he
[36:11] was a living God Amen praise God
[36:15] they wandered in deserts and in
[36:17] mountains and in dens and caves of the
[36:19] Earth
[36:20] and these all having obtained a good
[36:24] report through faith by revelation
[36:28] receive not the promise
[36:32] so there was something that God was
[36:34] building up that God was
[36:37] doing condescending down and bringing
[36:41] each and every one of these attributes
[36:43] of God each and every one of these
[36:45] individuals for a great purpose
[36:48] and here we are in the last days
[36:51] culminating all of this
[36:53] allowing the Holy Spirit now to minister
[36:56] to us and through us
[36:59] to bring the word that will take us
[37:02] in the rapture
[37:04] because the promise
[37:07] is the rapture for us
[37:09] that's the promise the great meeting in
[37:12] the air they which are are dead shall be
[37:16] raised up first
[37:18] and we which are alive and remain shall
[37:20] be caught up together with who with all
[37:23] of them
[37:24] so that we can rejoice and have that
[37:26] meeting
[37:28] that Plan of Redemption to be fulfilled
[37:31] but notice here God having provided some
[37:34] better thing for us
[37:36] that they without us should not be made
[37:41] perfect
[37:42] praise God you may be seated
[37:51] we look back through the scriptures
[37:53] right from Genesis and we see the move
[37:56] of God
[37:57] and how God was condescending down to
[38:01] bring himself eventually to where he
[38:04] would reunite with his sons and
[38:07] daughters because we know that this
[38:09] whole plan was something that he planned
[38:11] from before the foundations of the world
[38:14] so this is one of the things that you
[38:16] know
[38:17] we we can never we can never forget that
[38:20] this was all part of God's plan you know
[38:23] I was with some friends today
[38:25] and uh you know we had lunch together
[38:27] and there was a priest and there was you
[38:30] know a Catholic priest and then there
[38:31] was you know a couple of my good friends
[38:34] um who I you know business associates
[38:36] that I love and appreciate and you know
[38:39] we get to talking uh on the word you
[38:42] know eventually it leads they lead into
[38:44] it and then of course I'm gonna say my
[38:46] part and you know they were talking
[38:48] about how you know one of them was
[38:51] talking about how the world you know
[38:52] like can you can go back like hundreds
[38:55] of thousands of years and how things you
[38:57] know have happened you know first for
[38:59] eons of time millions of years I mean
[39:02] the dinosaurs all the we know all those
[39:04] things right and then I sat back and I
[39:07] let them say all those things and you
[39:08] know and and the priest you know he's
[39:11] from India
[39:13] and you know he was talking about how
[39:14] you know when you really go back you
[39:17] know thousands of years everything
[39:18] really started in India right and and
[39:21] it's interesting because you know if you
[39:24] talk to certain people from different
[39:26] nations you know they'll give you their
[39:29] understanding of how it originated you
[39:32] know this originated all right back
[39:34] there in Israel if you talk to the Jews
[39:36] and if you talk to the Italians they'll
[39:38] tell you well you know a lot took place
[39:40] in Italy and you know so and and so I
[39:44] got to talking at the end and I said you
[39:46] know
[39:48] all that you're saying and everything
[39:50] that you're that you're bringing here
[39:51] it's all very possible
[39:55] and I don't doubt it at all
[39:58] because you know like for example you
[40:01] know the Catholic priest being from
[40:03] India they're you know like the world
[40:05] power has gone from from this country to
[40:09] that country and there's been a a moving
[40:12] of power and a transforming of power
[40:14] that's been going from country to
[40:16] Country well
[40:18] Hebrews chapter 11 verse 6 says that the
[40:21] worlds
[40:23] plural
[40:25] were formed by the word of God
[40:30] and so there could have been many worlds
[40:33] and I said but we're not in those other
[40:36] worlds we're in this one
[40:39] I said what does the word of God say for
[40:42] us
[40:43] this is what we need to be concerned
[40:46] about
[40:47] we need to be tuned in to the plan of
[40:50] God because I said God has given this
[40:53] world
[40:54] 7 000 years of time and and Joseph the
[40:59] priest says yes that's correct
[41:01] I said and that 7 000 years of time
[41:04] we're just about done 6 000 years or
[41:08] we're actually over
[41:10] if you look at the calendars but we
[41:13] can't put an exact time on all of that
[41:17] I said so what's important is to realize
[41:20] that God has a plan for this world
[41:24] we're in a world and so whenever
[41:28] I study the word or I Fellowship on the
[41:31] word
[41:32] I want to know the present stage
[41:36] of God
[41:37] what is he doing right now because
[41:41] that's what concerns me
[41:43] that's what concerns the world we can
[41:46] look at all the prophecies and all the
[41:48] events that are taking place in the
[41:51] world and We Know by fact when we look
[41:55] into the word of God
[41:57] we see that we're in the last days
[42:00] we see the prophecies that were written
[42:03] in the Lamb's Book of Life
[42:05] being manifested in our lives because we
[42:09] are hearkening to the call of God in
[42:12] this day
[42:13] you see we need to recognize where we
[42:17] fit into the now I didn't get into all
[42:19] this of course
[42:20] all I said was we need to recognize what
[42:23] it is that God is doing in our day
[42:26] and how it pertains to us
[42:28] because we know that the world is going
[42:31] to get worse and they said oh yeah they
[42:35] see that the you know the conditions of
[42:37] the world we're in the midst of of a
[42:39] World War potential three
[42:42] right now
[42:44] and you know and Joseph the priest he
[42:47] says something significant is going to
[42:50] happen in March next month
[42:54] that could trigger
[42:56] and send us into World War III I said
[42:59] that's very possible
[43:02] in my mind I'm saying I'm fully prepared
[43:06] I understand that these prophecies are
[43:08] going to take place I realize the hour
[43:11] that we're living in and I'm I'm just
[43:14] blessed that God has allowed us
[43:18] to be a part of it
[43:20] I'm just thankful that the Lord has
[43:23] given us faith and Revelation to
[43:27] recognize what it is that we must do as
[43:31] Sons and Daughters of God to overcome
[43:34] the pressure that's coming down
[43:37] in this age
[43:40] let's go to the next slide
[43:43] when I finished off in uh
[43:46] uh in January on this on the 4th of
[43:49] January I finished off with this quote
[43:52] and I want to read it again
[43:54] from Christ The Mystery of God
[43:57] Christ is the mystery 1963
[44:00] oh the devil's howling about this
[44:03] the manifested truth of the promise of
[44:06] the word in her alone
[44:10] now listen we did not deserve
[44:15] any
[44:17] thing special
[44:19] we were born into this world
[44:22] born in sin
[44:24] shaped in iniquity
[44:26] speaking lies
[44:28] we're no better than anybody else
[44:30] but God when he says my sheep hear my
[44:34] voice
[44:35] that's something that we have no control
[44:38] over
[44:39] when I heard this message
[44:42] and I recognized his voice
[44:45] because it was his voice that I
[44:48] recognized I didn't recognize brother
[44:51] Branham
[44:53] I didn't I didn't know who brother
[44:55] Branham was
[44:57] but when he started to deal and pull
[45:00] upon my heart
[45:02] by the word of God
[45:05] there was something in me that could
[45:07] respond and identify and recognize and
[45:13] it brought a power
[45:16] now we're going to be looking at this
[45:17] this is only we're we're just we're just
[45:20] going to touch the surface but as we
[45:22] move into this series you're going to
[45:24] see things that that because I want to
[45:27] bring the word in such a way that even
[45:29] the little children can understand it
[45:31] that when we come to realize that when
[45:35] we receive Faith by the word of God
[45:38] and it's meant for you to receive it
[45:41] you're one of the sheep my sheep
[45:45] my chosen ones
[45:47] not one of them will be lost all that
[45:50] the father hath given me will come he
[45:53] didn't say might
[45:55] he said we'll come
[45:57] doesn't matter where they are it doesn't
[45:59] matter how young how old
[46:01] when the word of faith drops into their
[46:04] hearts it brings a power
[46:08] into your life individually to overcome
[46:12] whatever it is that you're dealing with
[46:15] in your life
[46:17] so if you're a young child and you're in
[46:19] school
[46:21] and your mother's bringing you here into
[46:23] the house of the Lord to receive the
[46:25] word of God
[46:26] and you're meeting certain challenges
[46:28] because there's bullies at church or
[46:31] there or at uh at school and there's you
[46:34] know situations in the in the school I'm
[46:38] using an example for our young people
[46:40] you know you might have a job or you
[46:42] might have a boss that you don't like or
[46:44] that's nasty or whatever
[46:47] when you come into the house of the Lord
[46:49] and you receive the word for your day
[46:52] remember the word for your day is Christ
[46:55] speaking and ministering to each and
[46:58] every one of us including the minister
[47:01] and when that word gets accepted into
[47:04] your heart that's why Jesus said
[47:06] only believe
[47:08] only believe
[47:10] all things are possible
[47:13] a power a strength
[47:16] and the spirit of God comes into your
[47:18] life
[47:19] and you even unconscious
[47:23] will start to be delivered from those
[47:25] situations that are around your life
[47:28] that's why Jesus said seek first the
[47:31] kingdom everything else will be added
[47:34] we want to keep it simple we want to be
[47:37] able to recognize that faith will come
[47:41] in due season and to each and every one
[47:44] of us is given a portion of faith
[47:48] we cannot all be the same God has
[47:52] a many-membered body but the body is
[47:55] designed in such a way that it edifies
[47:57] itself
[47:59] your body is designed in such a way that
[48:02] when you get sick it starts to work from
[48:05] the inside to push that sickness out
[48:08] while the Holy Spirit when he comes in
[48:11] you and you receive the word of God it
[48:14] starts to deal with the sickness the
[48:17] oppression the chains of the enemy the
[48:20] things that are holding you that are
[48:22] oppressing you that are keeping you down
[48:25] to be cast out
[48:28] to be broken
[48:30] and for you to be liberated by the
[48:33] spirit of God
[48:36] and so Satan doesn't like that
[48:40] he doesn't
[48:41] understand it
[48:43] because revelation
[48:45] is something that is sovereign
[48:48] it's only given if God decides to give
[48:51] it
[48:51] he can't receive it
[48:54] all he can do is fight it
[48:56] that's why when we look back at all
[48:59] those that had to go through the things
[49:02] that they went through
[49:04] they were given an anointing listen
[49:06] Abraham Abraham was a pagan of all
[49:10] pagans
[49:11] he was sacrificing children
[49:14] they were they were Idol worshipers
[49:18] but when the spirit of the Lord came and
[49:21] spoke to him
[49:24] he heard that voice
[49:26] something came into him that gave him
[49:29] the power to overcome all of his Kindred
[49:33] Folk
[49:35] everything that was that that that had a
[49:38] hold on him that had held him by
[49:40] tradition all the the the influences of
[49:44] his family of his children God says get
[49:47] up and go
[49:51] that's all he that's all he gave him
[49:53] he had to overcome
[49:55] all the testings that came with get up
[50:00] and go
[50:02] I remember when God called my life and
[50:05] my family and and I realized my God
[50:10] how am I gonna you know get rid of all
[50:12] this unbelief around my life
[50:15] because you you come to realize that
[50:17] when the word of God comes to you
[50:20] all you can see is is unbelief
[50:24] everybody around you your own family
[50:26] your friends everybody's cursing and
[50:28] swearing and taking the name of the Lord
[50:30] in vain and it's like you know stealing
[50:33] and cheating and this it was just a part
[50:35] of life
[50:37] but all I can say to you is that God
[50:40] put Faith
[50:42] into my heart and it overcame
[50:47] and here we are 30 years later
[50:50] believing this word like never before
[50:53] because we know that the way that he
[50:55] started that work
[50:57] is how he's going to finish it and take
[50:59] us right out of here
[51:03] so the word in her alone they don't have
[51:06] the answer
[51:07] when Jesus come why didn't those
[51:10] Pharisees he said if I cast out Devils
[51:13] by the Finger of God who do you cast
[51:16] them out by
[51:17] they had no idea they thought they knew
[51:20] God
[51:21] they thought they understood the word
[51:23] but then when the word stood right there
[51:25] in front of them just like us
[51:29] they you know we didn't realize we
[51:32] thought that the priest knew the word we
[51:35] figured oh well if we need to know
[51:36] anything about God we should go talk to
[51:37] the priest
[51:38] they should know but then God gives you
[51:41] a simple Revelation on the baptism in
[51:43] the name of Jesus Christ and you talk to
[51:45] the first person that you talk to and
[51:47] you find out that 98 of the world
[51:50] believes in the trinity
[51:53] that there's three in one
[51:57] and you're sitting there you can see as
[51:59] clear as a bell that Jesus Christ was
[52:01] the word made flesh he was God Emmanuel
[52:05] God With Us
[52:08] the word was made flesh and dwelt Among
[52:11] Us in the beginning was the word so if
[52:13] the word was in the beginning and the
[52:15] Word was God and the Word was made flesh
[52:18] and dwelt Among Us Then Jesus Christ was
[52:20] God
[52:22] it's as simple as that
[52:23] but it goes right over their head and
[52:25] you're sitting there and going
[52:27] wow how is it because my sheep hear my
[52:32] voice
[52:34] he stood alone and you've got to stand
[52:37] alone
[52:39] as a young person as an old person
[52:41] Wherever You Are
[52:43] you don't have to be
[52:46] a person that stands alone and makes
[52:48] everybody know that you know and that
[52:51] they don't know you know by the grace of
[52:53] God
[52:54] but where you stand alone is in your
[52:56] faith that you can't disbelieve the word
[53:00] when you see unbelief you can't believe
[53:02] unbelief because your attribute your
[53:06] your your representation in the word
[53:08] cannot deny the word
[53:10] and so you see the word clear
[53:16] and his church stands alone
[53:21] she's not hooked with nothing
[53:24] but he was identified by guys talk Jesus
[53:27] was identified by God being the body
[53:31] that God dwelt in and the church is
[53:34] identified by his body doing the same
[53:37] thing
[53:38] she is his body the manifested truth of
[53:43] his promised word for the last days and
[53:46] she and she alone stands by it
[53:52] you're a minority
[53:55] it's just the way it is
[53:58] that's why the devil is howling
[54:02] these great organizations set up
[54:04] something to close her up they'll never
[54:07] do it she'll be taken up not closed up
[54:14] so next slide
[54:20] we come to realize that you know
[54:23] you can go back and you know listen we
[54:25] could talk about so many of the
[54:29] the the Warriors and the and the uh the
[54:33] true Sons and Daughters of God that God
[54:35] chose all through the Old Testament we
[54:38] think about David we think about uh
[54:42] yeah
[54:43] it Rahab there's there's so many types
[54:46] and so many you know Shadows there that
[54:49] that we can look at and and all we can
[54:51] see is when we read about them we see
[54:53] that Faith had to come for them to
[54:57] overcome look at David
[55:00] was you know when when God sent Samuel
[55:03] into into David's house you know and
[55:06] it's called the father and says I need
[55:08] to find the king he's here he's one of
[55:11] your sons God didn't choose
[55:14] the ones that they thought
[55:17] God chose David I got a son you know you
[55:20] got to have one more he says I got one
[55:22] that's out in the field he's always you
[55:24] know hanging out with the Sheep he
[55:26] stinks you know surely it can't be him
[55:29] bring him
[55:31] and when he came that was God's choice
[55:34] and God poured oil all over him because
[55:38] it was a sign that the spirit of God was
[55:41] going to come upon his life
[55:43] and that he would be the one he would be
[55:45] the one that would lead Israel he would
[55:47] be the king of Israel and when he stood
[55:50] in front of Goliath
[55:53] he had already had experiences with God
[55:57] he knew that God could deliver him and
[56:00] you need to think and and put yourself
[56:02] into that position today because I know
[56:05] that many of you have been walking with
[56:07] the Lord for many many years and you've
[56:09] got goliaths in your life
[56:11] but I want you to look back at what God
[56:14] did for you that brought you thus far
[56:16] David remembered he says one one time a
[56:20] lion came and tried to take one of my
[56:22] sheep
[56:24] and I I destroyed that sheep he killed
[56:27] the sheep and then another time a bear
[56:30] came and tried and I killed that bear
[56:34] why he had an experience with God he
[56:36] knew what was possible with God and so
[56:39] you should know that there's nothing
[56:41] impossible amen whatever circumstance
[56:44] whatever situation you're dealing with
[56:46] in your life right now you need to
[56:48] believe that that same God that
[56:51] delivered you that called you and
[56:53] brought you thus far will take you the
[56:54] rest of the way
[56:56] you will need to overcome
[57:00] David stood there in front of the king
[57:04] of Israel
[57:06] and looked at that Goliath who stood
[57:09] about 10 feet tall
[57:11] a lot of people they thought there's
[57:13] just no way we can kill this giant but
[57:16] David Knew by experience
[57:19] he wasn't coming
[57:21] he says you come with your own strength
[57:23] you come with your own ability but I'm
[57:26] coming in the name of the Lord and he
[57:28] stood before that Goliath and he said
[57:31] today with your sword
[57:34] I'm going to take your head off
[57:38] and he did it
[57:41] but here we are
[57:43] recognizing that God was condescending
[57:46] God was showing through all of those
[57:48] attributes of God that he was going to
[57:52] fulfill his promise that he was going to
[57:55] get
[57:57] to the end of the road
[57:58] and that every son and daughter of God
[58:00] would be redeemed back
[58:04] to where we came from
[58:07] so here we know God sent us a prophet
[58:11] thank God that the prophet of God came
[58:14] thank God that he brought his message
[58:16] without his message we could not be
[58:19] where we are today
[58:21] but we need to also realize that it was
[58:24] the voice of God
[58:27] the voice of God not the voice of
[58:30] William Branham
[58:32] so when they rejected brother Branham
[58:36] they were rejecting the word
[58:40] and the pressure was coming down imagine
[58:42] brother Branham all those years you know
[58:46] you know I'll read some quotes
[58:48] he says here
[58:50] and that's the way of the world today
[58:52] it's got plenty to eat plenty to wear
[58:54] find churches big places fine educated
[58:57] ministers and so they don't need nothing
[59:00] but you don't know that the scripture
[59:03] said you're naked miserable blind and
[59:05] don't know it
[59:07] don't know it and you can't tell them no
[59:10] different they continually weighed right
[59:13] on down that line and failed to let the
[59:16] word of God influence them to believe
[59:19] Jesus Christ is raised from the dead and
[59:22] alive today the same yesterday today and
[59:25] forever they're just simply dead
[59:28] brother Branham came
[59:30] and brought a word that was rejected
[59:34] he brought a word that brought all of
[59:38] the churches
[59:39] into the second crucifixion and they
[59:43] were indicted for the second crucifixion
[59:45] of Jesus Christ because they had
[59:47] rejected the word
[59:49] and it was because he had brought the
[59:52] word no matter what nation you're in
[59:55] wherever you're at whoever you are let
[59:58] it wake you up hours come and go the
[1:00:02] first thing you know you'll be saying
[1:00:03] well I thought they were supposed to be
[1:00:06] this happened before the rapture
[1:00:10] there might be a voice come back like it
[1:00:12] did one time it's already happened and
[1:00:15] you didn't know it you'll be all
[1:00:17] anchored off in church somewhere saying
[1:00:19] I'm just as secure as I can be and the
[1:00:23] first thing you know the Rapture will be
[1:00:25] gone
[1:00:26] I'm going to it's going to be a secret
[1:00:28] sudden going nobody know nothing about
[1:00:31] it
[1:00:31] look the world will keep right on going
[1:00:35] like Noah went into the ark you remember
[1:00:38] after Noah went into the ark he sat
[1:00:41] there seven days after God closed the
[1:00:43] door God closed the door and Noah sat in
[1:00:46] the ARK for seven days before anything
[1:00:49] happened and the door of Mercy will be
[1:00:52] closed in your face and might already be
[1:00:55] and just thinking of it the people go
[1:00:58] right ahead preaching people thinking
[1:01:00] they're getting saved putting their
[1:01:02] names on the books joining churches
[1:01:04] shouting jumping up and down that's from
[1:01:07] the message influence 1964.
[1:01:12] so brother Branham we know that in 1906
[1:01:16] brother Branham was born and that was
[1:01:18] the beginning of the last Church age
[1:01:27] 50 years later brother Branham
[1:01:29] was was approaching
[1:01:32] his Jubilee
[1:01:34] he was 50 years old
[1:01:40] and he said that his message would
[1:01:44] either be accepted or rejected
[1:01:46] amen the religious systems had
[1:01:50] recognized and witnessed brother
[1:01:51] branham's Ministry and they were all
[1:01:54] happy to bring him in when he had the
[1:01:56] first sign which was the first pull was
[1:01:58] the sign on the hand the second sign was
[1:02:01] the discernment of their spirits of
[1:02:03] their of their conditions they'd be able
[1:02:05] to tell them the you know the secrets of
[1:02:07] their hearts and everybody was opening
[1:02:09] the doors and walking him in he would
[1:02:12] have meeting after meeting he went
[1:02:13] across the world seven times and and
[1:02:15] people that the crowds were in the
[1:02:17] thousands sometimes tens of thousands
[1:02:20] would go to his meetings
[1:02:22] but yet in 1963 there was a
[1:02:27] dispensational change that took place
[1:02:30] and this was a a very significant time
[1:02:34] for the church
[1:02:37] it was the time where God
[1:02:40] was going to now change
[1:02:43] a dispensation and go from
[1:02:46] a man on the Earth
[1:02:49] to the mighty Angel come down
[1:02:52] and manifest himself in the five-fold
[1:02:55] ministry
[1:02:56] to call all those whose names were
[1:02:59] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:03:02] there came the opening of the word
[1:03:04] that's what that was
[1:03:06] in 1963 when brother Branham started to
[1:03:10] minister on those Seven Seals it was God
[1:03:13] coming down to release the Mysteries
[1:03:16] that were in the word of God
[1:03:19] and and those Mysteries are sitting here
[1:03:22] tonight
[1:03:24] because
[1:03:25] he came and he was the lamb that could
[1:03:28] was the only one that could take the
[1:03:30] book
[1:03:32] there was nobody else that was able to
[1:03:35] take the book that was sealed with Seven
[1:03:37] Seals
[1:03:38] that's why for people to say oh brother
[1:03:40] Branham opened the Seven Seals no he
[1:03:42] didn't
[1:03:44] it was the lamb that opened the Seven
[1:03:46] Seals
[1:03:47] no man was found worthy in heaven or on
[1:03:50] Earth only the bleeding lamb after he
[1:03:53] had done the sacrifice
[1:03:55] because everything was fulfilled from
[1:03:58] before the foundations of the world
[1:04:00] and so we need to recognize when this
[1:04:03] dispensational change took place it sent
[1:04:06] the whole religious world into a chaos
[1:04:10] all of a sudden all the doors started to
[1:04:13] shut down to brother Branham and to his
[1:04:16] message because now it was like Jesus
[1:04:19] Christ when he you go back and you read
[1:04:22] Saint John chapter 6 you know start at
[1:04:25] verse 26 and go right through right down
[1:04:28] into verse 66 where it says they walked
[1:04:30] with him no more
[1:04:32] because he was unveiling himself before
[1:04:35] the people
[1:04:36] he was making himself known before the
[1:04:39] people that was his seventh seal
[1:04:41] Revelation before the people that was
[1:04:45] his third pull Ministry amongst the
[1:04:47] people and he was telling them if you
[1:04:50] don't eat my word and if you don't drink
[1:04:52] my blood if you don't receive the spirit
[1:04:54] of God there's you will have no part of
[1:04:57] me
[1:04:58] and it was hard for them to accept that
[1:05:02] and when brother Branham was preaching
[1:05:03] on the opening of the word and and the
[1:05:06] Seven Seals and was was exposing the
[1:05:09] power of the enemy Satan everybody
[1:05:11] thought the white horse rider was Christ
[1:05:15] meanwhile it was that Deceiver
[1:05:18] that was moving in the churches
[1:05:21] constantly trying to squeeze the word
[1:05:25] out of the people to get them to
[1:05:27] disbelieve God's word
[1:05:31] remember God doesn't change
[1:05:34] and Satan doesn't change
[1:05:36] his ways are the same
[1:05:40] and so here in later in 63 brother
[1:05:43] Branham after he realized that he had
[1:05:46] been rejected
[1:05:48] he realized what took place there in
[1:05:50] Revelations 10 1-7
[1:05:52] when God said that he put his foot on
[1:05:54] the right hand on on the scene on the
[1:05:56] land and he said time shall be no more
[1:05:58] he realized that the time had run out
[1:06:03] now we know that
[1:06:05] the Angel and the dispensational change
[1:06:08] of the messenger went from an Earthly
[1:06:10] time Messenger to an eternal messenger
[1:06:13] which is Christ now in the five-fold
[1:06:15] ministry
[1:06:16] but we also need to see the types and
[1:06:20] the shadows and the and the and the
[1:06:22] physical applications of the word that
[1:06:25] took place in 1963 when he said time
[1:06:29] shall be no more and then he goes on to
[1:06:31] be rejected and then he goes on to
[1:06:34] preach a message I indict this
[1:06:36] generation for the second crucifixion of
[1:06:38] Jesus Christ I can show you quotes in
[1:06:41] the word I'm going to read some of them
[1:06:42] here
[1:06:44] where where brother Branham talks about
[1:06:47] uh that you know that they basically
[1:06:51] had rejected the word of God and that
[1:06:54] their time had basically run out as a
[1:06:57] nation
[1:06:58] as Nations as denominations God is not
[1:07:02] dealing with denominations anymore
[1:07:06] God's not dealing with with countries
[1:07:09] anymore
[1:07:10] God sent you know uh Moses into Egypt
[1:07:14] because God was bringing judgment onto
[1:07:17] Egypt
[1:07:19] but God is now dealing with you and I
[1:07:23] individually
[1:07:25] calling each and every one of us into
[1:07:28] our position as Sons and Daughters of
[1:07:31] God
[1:07:33] listen to brother Branham here
[1:07:36] recognizing your day
[1:07:39] 1964 down in your heart you feel the
[1:07:42] Holy Spirit dropping tears Jerusalem Old
[1:07:45] Jerusalem how oft would I have hovered
[1:07:48] you
[1:07:49] but what did you do you killed the
[1:07:52] prophets that I sent to you you murdered
[1:07:55] them and the messages has been sent to
[1:07:58] the churches today has been murdered
[1:08:02] foreign
[1:08:04] dogmas
[1:08:07] scripture has been murdered by their
[1:08:09] dogmas Jesus said if you'd only knowed
[1:08:12] your day but it's too far now it's too
[1:08:15] late now so it's so it is with the
[1:08:18] churches
[1:08:20] they accept it and they're going to
[1:08:22] accept the World Council of churches
[1:08:26] when Jesus was on the Earth
[1:08:28] and they brought Jesus up to be judged
[1:08:30] for crucifixion they took a murderer by
[1:08:33] the name of Barabbas
[1:08:35] instead of accepting the word of God
[1:08:39] so what they're going to do is they're
[1:08:41] going to develop and are have already
[1:08:44] developed the World Council of churches
[1:08:46] and their purpose is only one thing
[1:08:49] and that is to try and snuff out the
[1:08:52] true word of God
[1:08:55] they're accepting a system listen to
[1:08:57] brother Brown what shall we do
[1:08:59] with Jesus 1963 he says and what if the
[1:09:03] churches desired a murderer of the word
[1:09:06] one who takes a system if the system is
[1:09:09] contrary to the word then it's a
[1:09:11] murderer to the word and they desired a
[1:09:15] denominational tradition instead of the
[1:09:17] true word being manifested
[1:09:20] and proved that it's God amongst the
[1:09:23] People by science through pictures light
[1:09:26] the same Angel of the Lord the pillar of
[1:09:29] Fire
[1:09:31] that was God vindicating to the people
[1:09:34] in that day when that Supernatural was
[1:09:37] taking place all around brother
[1:09:38] branham's life it was God vindicating
[1:09:41] and saying here I am
[1:09:45] but his sheep heard
[1:09:48] my sheep
[1:09:49] will hear
[1:09:52] same thing's taking place today
[1:09:54] we're going to lead into how it is that
[1:09:57] God is speaking to us and how the
[1:10:00] squeeze is actually good for us
[1:10:03] because it's going to produce the word
[1:10:06] when they crucified Christ and they sent
[1:10:09] them to the Cross they thought that they
[1:10:11] had gotten rid of him no they didn't
[1:10:14] they allowed a multiplied form of many
[1:10:17] Christ's Sons and Daughters of God to
[1:10:20] come back on the earth and be filled
[1:10:23] with his Spirit to overcome and fulfill
[1:10:25] the Plan of Redemption
[1:10:28] that's what we're doing we need to keep
[1:10:31] that as a center focal point of Our
[1:10:33] Lives
[1:10:34] you see the reason why we preach this
[1:10:37] message
[1:10:38] and we Minister on this revelation
[1:10:42] on the present stage of the ministry of
[1:10:45] Jesus Christ is so that the last one
[1:10:48] that's to come in because he said all
[1:10:52] that the father hath given me will come
[1:10:54] not one will be lost
[1:10:56] those whose names were written in the
[1:10:58] Lamb's Book of Life from before that all
[1:11:01] the names are written there that's why
[1:11:02] when the lamb took the book and he
[1:11:04] started to unveil the Mysteries as the
[1:11:06] Mysteries were being unveiled and you
[1:11:09] know I remember I remember when I first
[1:11:11] read the seven seal book
[1:11:13] I started reading that book I could not
[1:11:15] put it down I was eating it up like it
[1:11:17] was like food it I was getting so much
[1:11:20] stimulation I encourage you to go back
[1:11:22] and read that again
[1:11:25] after this series is done because that's
[1:11:27] where I'm drawing a lot of the
[1:11:29] information and a lot of the inspiration
[1:11:32] is coming right out of that because that
[1:11:35] pertains to us
[1:11:37] we need to recognize our day and the
[1:11:40] message that's come for our day
[1:11:43] and the message came and started in 1963
[1:11:47] and it pertained to you and me
[1:11:51] that even Rhymes 1963 pertains to you
[1:11:54] and me Hallelujah
[1:11:56] when you hear those Mysteries being
[1:11:58] preached you're hearing your name being
[1:12:01] called
[1:12:02] you're recognizing the word and it's
[1:12:04] it's positionally placing you into a
[1:12:07] position of perfect Faith to recognize
[1:12:09] that the word is being fulfilled in my
[1:12:12] life in your life that you're actually
[1:12:14] one of God's attributes
[1:12:18] but it's going to be rejected
[1:12:21] it's not going to be accepted easily
[1:12:24] the language we speak is like a foreign
[1:12:27] language to most people
[1:12:29] but revelation
[1:12:31] when God gives you the understanding you
[1:12:34] can't
[1:12:36] you can't explain it you just understand
[1:12:39] it
[1:12:40] you see it as clear as clear can be
[1:12:44] in recognizing your day here 1964
[1:12:48] and just remember
[1:12:50] if time no sorry
[1:12:52] 19 yeah recognize it National Force put
[1:12:55] Israel in her Homeland National Force
[1:13:00] put the church in the world Council of
[1:13:03] churches
[1:13:04] but the power of God will put the people
[1:13:07] in The Bride
[1:13:09] remember Faith cometh by hearing
[1:13:11] remember what we were saying
[1:13:13] and remember this message is the only
[1:13:16] message that pulls
[1:13:19] the Sons and Daughters of God
[1:13:23] into the body of Christ
[1:13:26] we're going to be looking at a lot down
[1:13:27] the road here I've got a lot of notes
[1:13:29] there's no way we can cover it tonight
[1:13:30] but we're going to be looking at the
[1:13:32] first pull the second pull the third
[1:13:34] pull and the effect of the third pull
[1:13:36] and why it's so
[1:13:38] powerful in in in your life right now
[1:13:41] you're gonna you're gonna see things
[1:13:43] that you never saw before you're going
[1:13:45] to realize that you are truly an
[1:13:46] overcomer God's power
[1:13:49] is what puts the people in The Bride the
[1:13:52] world forces this way and the world
[1:13:55] forces that way but God forces upward
[1:13:58] the spirit of God which is the word of
[1:14:01] God my spirit my word is spirit and life
[1:14:04] will put the bride in her place
[1:14:09] because she'll recognize her position in
[1:14:13] the word
[1:14:14] then she's in Christ
[1:14:19] will put her in her place no National
[1:14:22] Force will do it
[1:14:25] but the National Force will drive Israel
[1:14:28] to the Homeland
[1:14:31] it was National forces God used National
[1:14:34] forces to force Israel back into her
[1:14:38] Homeland because we know that the next
[1:14:40] stage
[1:14:41] that when the Rapture does take place
[1:14:44] and the bride is removed from this Earth
[1:14:47] God's attributes are taken then
[1:14:50] everything focuses back on to Israel and
[1:14:53] the Holy Spirit is going to send his
[1:14:55] Messengers Moses and Elijah into Israel
[1:14:59] and they're going to be preaching the
[1:15:01] same Revelation that we are preaching
[1:15:03] here tonight
[1:15:05] they're going to preach the revelation
[1:15:07] of Jesus Christ
[1:15:08] they're gonna
[1:15:10] they're gonna realize that they actually
[1:15:12] had their visitation of Messiah but it
[1:15:16] wasn't their time
[1:15:18] it was our time
[1:15:20] that the Gentiles should be
[1:15:23] spoken to should be called
[1:15:26] Hallelujah
[1:15:29] and so
[1:15:30] he'll put her in her plate no National
[1:15:32] Force will do it but the National Force
[1:15:34] put Israel in her home the National
[1:15:36] Force forces of the Council of the
[1:15:38] churches will drive every organization
[1:15:41] into it but the power of God will raise
[1:15:44] the bride into Glory
[1:15:47] out of it
[1:15:48] and just remember
[1:15:50] if time moves on we're not going to have
[1:15:53] this privilege very long
[1:15:57] this is you know here brother Branham
[1:15:59] was speaking back in 1964
[1:16:02] about you know
[1:16:04] the Rapture he thought would happen that
[1:16:07] night
[1:16:08] next week
[1:16:10] he was under full expectation that there
[1:16:12] was nothing left that had to be done why
[1:16:15] because he had fulfilled his portion of
[1:16:19] the word
[1:16:20] he had come into perfect faith
[1:16:23] and revelation of what it was that God
[1:16:26] had given him in the scripture to
[1:16:29] fulfill
[1:16:30] and that's why he never you don't you
[1:16:33] you can go back you never really ever
[1:16:35] hear Brother Branham talking about
[1:16:37] Revelations 10 8 to 11.
[1:16:40] where it talks about us
[1:16:42] taking the book and eating the book
[1:16:44] and prophesying again
[1:16:46] because that was the continuation of the
[1:16:49] word to bring us into this dispensation
[1:16:54] we've we've preached on on that many
[1:16:56] times on calling the resurrection that
[1:16:58] the bride now has the word she
[1:17:01] prophesies but she's not repeating the
[1:17:04] same things that have already been said
[1:17:08] those names that were called under
[1:17:10] brother branham's dispensation
[1:17:12] were called under his dispensation and
[1:17:15] the bride and the attributes of God that
[1:17:17] were under his dispensation recognized
[1:17:20] heard the word and came
[1:17:23] well there's a new dispensation
[1:17:26] and now we carry the prophecy which is
[1:17:29] Christ in us to speak and to call the
[1:17:33] resurrection of the Saints right out of
[1:17:35] whatever condition that they're in not
[1:17:38] our voice but the scripture and brother
[1:17:42] Brown said she'll have the final voice
[1:17:46] the final voice will be in the bride
[1:17:51] his voice
[1:17:52] not your voice not my voice we can get
[1:17:56] excited sometimes and we we look at
[1:17:58] situations and we want to just
[1:18:01] in the name of Jesus Christ let this
[1:18:04] lottery ticket win this Friday night
[1:18:11] it keeps falling because it reminds me I
[1:18:13] need a drink
[1:18:20] it's not applying the word in that way
[1:18:24] it's recognizing that the voice is in
[1:18:26] the bride
[1:18:27] and that unconsciously things will
[1:18:30] happen listen to brother Brown he says
[1:18:33] now just remember
[1:18:35] if time moves on
[1:18:38] another 10 minutes
[1:18:40] if time moves on we're not going to have
[1:18:42] this privilege very long see remember
[1:18:44] something will take place either the law
[1:18:47] will stop us
[1:18:49] or Satan will move among you and Scatter
[1:18:52] you
[1:18:54] well guess what the law didn't stop
[1:18:55] brother Branham or his people
[1:18:59] but Satan moved in
[1:19:02] amongst us
[1:19:03] because that's what the scripture said
[1:19:06] he would do
[1:19:08] and to do what scatter
[1:19:12] Force
[1:19:14] get you to disbelieve the word of God
[1:19:16] he's your enemy he's going to constantly
[1:19:19] try to bombard you with unbelief
[1:19:23] now these things has got to come to pass
[1:19:25] in this day just as he promised that he
[1:19:29] would do it
[1:19:31] listen identified Christ of all ages the
[1:19:33] presence of Jesus Christ which ought to
[1:19:36] illuminate the church to know that in
[1:19:38] this last days where Creeds and
[1:19:40] denominations and isms and everything
[1:19:43] has got the word all smothered out
[1:19:47] and Jesus the word on the outside of the
[1:19:50] church remember in laodicea he was
[1:19:52] knocking because he was put out of the
[1:19:54] church
[1:19:57] but it was for individuals now to invite
[1:19:59] him in
[1:20:02] it's not churches anymore
[1:20:04] it's the individuals that are maybe
[1:20:07] caught up in some of these churches like
[1:20:09] some of us were
[1:20:11] in the last days
[1:20:14] and he come back among the people and
[1:20:17] identified himself as he promised in the
[1:20:19] last days when the son of man is being
[1:20:21] revealed he was revealed in the baptism
[1:20:24] he was revealed in Divine Healing and he
[1:20:28] is in his last attribute
[1:20:31] in his last
[1:20:34] now there's many attributes but the last
[1:20:38] attribute is the body of Christ is the
[1:20:41] eve the restoration of Eve you know in
[1:20:45] type form he's here he was remember that
[1:20:49] was the last thing that Abraham saw
[1:20:51] before fire fell and judged the Gentile
[1:20:55] world and before the promised son came
[1:20:57] on the scene Isaac this is the last
[1:21:01] thing that the Christian church will see
[1:21:03] in sign of Miracle until the appearing
[1:21:07] of Jesus Christ if God has given me
[1:21:10] favor before you you believe me in the
[1:21:12] name of the Lord there's nothing else
[1:21:14] left in the Bible to be done but take on
[1:21:17] the mark of the beast and you
[1:21:20] have the Seal of God
[1:21:23] so brother Branham was living in 1960
[1:21:27] uh for their scene that everything had
[1:21:31] been fulfilled because all that he was
[1:21:34] to accomplish everything that he was to
[1:21:36] do he had finally fulfilled it and he
[1:21:40] saw all the types and shadows in Abraham
[1:21:43] and how you know Abraham stood there
[1:21:46] with the angel of the Lord and the angel
[1:21:48] of the Lord turned his back to Abraham
[1:21:49] told him the thoughts and intents of
[1:21:51] Sarah's heart did all that Supernatural
[1:21:54] did all those things and showed that
[1:21:57] that there was judgment now coming to
[1:21:59] the Earth all in types and shadows
[1:22:02] and brother Branham had fulfilled all
[1:22:04] those types and shadows but the people
[1:22:07] when he preached it when he brought it
[1:22:09] to the people they rejected it
[1:22:15] but yet it was the last sign
[1:22:21] I'm not going to go any further because
[1:22:23] it we're going to be moving now into
[1:22:25] another aspect of
[1:22:29] the opening of the word
[1:22:31] and how it's so important for us to
[1:22:34] recognize what took place in 1963.
[1:22:38] to realize the first the second and the
[1:22:41] third pull and how it's actually giving
[1:22:44] us the overcoming ability to meet the
[1:22:47] challenges of this day and of this hour
[1:22:51] but we need to realize that this squeeze
[1:22:53] in this hour
[1:22:55] this unbelief that will try and and get
[1:23:01] you to disbelieve the word remember it
[1:23:03] would be so deceiving in the last days
[1:23:06] that even the very elect would be
[1:23:09] deceived if it were possible
[1:23:11] that level of deception there is
[1:23:13] absolutely no way you as a human being
[1:23:16] can overcome that
[1:23:19] you will be deceived without the Holy
[1:23:22] Ghost
[1:23:23] without the spirit of God in you you
[1:23:26] cannot see you cannot recognize and
[1:23:29] that's why the progression of the word
[1:23:31] that keeps taking place in your life
[1:23:34] every time you come into service every
[1:23:37] time you feed on the word every time you
[1:23:39] listen to the prophet every time you you
[1:23:42] get down and pray
[1:23:44] there's progression taking place in your
[1:23:46] life but it brings rejection
[1:23:51] so we got to just keep
[1:23:54] pressing on Saints
[1:23:56] we need to keep feeding on the word of
[1:23:58] God
[1:24:00] it is more important now than it's ever
[1:24:02] been for us to assemble
[1:24:04] and feed on the manifestation of Christ
[1:24:08] in this day in this hour in the
[1:24:10] five-fold ministry
[1:24:12] amen praise God let the musicians come
[1:24:21] we need to realize that
[1:24:24] when we talk about the squeeze it's it's
[1:24:27] really a spiritual application to the
[1:24:30] bride that she's coming into her
[1:24:32] position
[1:24:34] to recognize who she is in the word of
[1:24:37] God
[1:24:38] and the pressure is going to come
[1:24:40] against you
[1:24:42] but it's actually Christ in you your
[1:24:45] hope of glory
[1:24:46] it's so Supernatural Saints but it's
[1:24:50] what's happening it's what's taking
[1:24:51] place we can't fight it we can't allow
[1:24:56] ourselves to to be caught by the
[1:24:58] unbelief and try to compromise on on
[1:25:01] this message there's no compromise on
[1:25:03] this message that God sent us
[1:25:07] God sent us a prophet everything that
[1:25:10] that Prophet preached on all those
[1:25:12] messages you need them you need to feed
[1:25:15] on them you cannot leave the prophet out
[1:25:18] because by leaving the prophet out
[1:25:20] you're leaving out 1963 which was the
[1:25:23] coming of the mighty angel
[1:25:25] he had to decrease so that the mighty
[1:25:28] Angel could increase
[1:25:30] so we cannot possibly leave brother
[1:25:33] Branham out of the equation
[1:25:35] but to put him as the only aspect and
[1:25:39] the only way that you're going to go in
[1:25:41] the Rapture is to press play
[1:25:44] and just listen
[1:25:46] without receiving the supernatural
[1:25:49] element that comes through the five-fold
[1:25:51] ministry in order to perfect the church
[1:25:55] you cannot be perfected
[1:25:58] you need the five-fold ministry you need
[1:26:00] to recognize the ministry for today
[1:26:03] praise God let us pray father
[1:26:06] we thank you tonight Lord for your
[1:26:08] goodness
[1:26:09] and your grace Lord and uh
[1:26:12] just speaking to us tonight in the
[1:26:15] simple way that you that you make us
[1:26:17] understand your word Lord we don't know
[1:26:19] any other way Lord
[1:26:22] even in 1963 when you came and you stood
