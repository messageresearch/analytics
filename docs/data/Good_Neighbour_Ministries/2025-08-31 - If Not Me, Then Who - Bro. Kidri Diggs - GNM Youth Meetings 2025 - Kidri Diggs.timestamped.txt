[55:14] Thor girl
[55:18] As she made her way to Jesus,
[55:24] she stumbled through the tears that made
[55:28] her blind.
[55:34] She felt such pain.
[55:39] Some spoke in anger.
[55:42] Heard folks whisper.
[55:45] There's no place here for kind.
[55:50] [Applause]
[55:53] Still on she came
[55:56] through the shame that flushed her face
[56:01] until at last
[56:03] she knelt before his feet.
[56:11] And though she spoke no words,
[56:15] everything she said was heard
[56:20] as she part her love for the master
[56:24] from her box of alabaster.
[56:29] So I've come to pour
[56:35] my praise on him
[56:38] like oil
[56:40] from Mary's
[56:42] at a pastor box.
[56:47] So don't be angry
[56:50] if I wash his feet with my tears and I
[56:55] dried them with my hair.
[57:01] My hair.
[57:04] So you weren't there
[57:08] the night it found me.
[57:12] You did not feel what I felt when he
[57:17] wrapped his love all around me. And you
[57:24] don't know the cost
[57:26] of the oil in my alabaster
[57:31] bar.
[57:34] [Music]
[57:40] I can't forget
[57:43] the way life used to be. Cuz I was a
[57:47] prisoner to the sins that had me bound.
[57:56] And I spent my days
[58:00] poured my life without measure into a
[58:04] little treasure box. I
[58:08] thought I found
[58:13] until the day when Jesus came to me and
[58:19] healed my soul with the wonders of
[58:25] his touch.
[58:27] So now I am giving back to him.
[58:32] Oh, the praise is worthy of I've been
[58:36] forgi
[58:38] and that's why
[58:40] I love him so much.
[58:46] And I've come too for
[58:51] my praise on him like oil from Mary's
[58:58] alabaster box.
[59:03] Oh, don't be angry.
[59:06] If I washed his feet with my tears and I
[59:11] dried them with
[59:14] my hair,
[59:17] my hair,
[59:20] you were there.
[59:23] In the night Jesus found me. You did not
[59:29] feel what I felt when he wrapped his
[59:33] loving arms around me. And you don't
[59:38] know the cost
[59:41] of the oil.
[59:44] Oh,
[59:46] you don't know the cost of my bra.
[59:54] You don't know
[59:59] the cost
[1:00:01] of the oil
[1:00:04] in my
[1:00:08] bure.

[1:02:09] looking good. I ain't going to lie.
[1:02:11] Arrows flying, devils trying to make me
[1:02:14] think I'm going down this time. You
[1:02:17] might think I'd be afraid. Running
[1:02:20] scared with a shaking faith. The God I
[1:02:23] know says it ain't over. The God I know

[1:14:31] That's one thing that the true church of
[1:14:34] the living God knows
[1:14:36] is who they believe.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; The word for the day, the word for the
[1:14:42] hour. Praise God. And you are all here
[1:14:46] manifested word in your day. Did you
[1:14:50] know that
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; you are God's interpretation
[1:14:54] of his word in this hour?
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. that can praise him, that can
[1:14:59] recognize him. Like, you know, when he
[1:15:02] came to the earth, there was only a
[1:15:04] handful that actually recognized him.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he was hidden to the wise
[1:15:10] and the prudent.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; But he was made known unto babes such as
[1:15:15] these. Simple. Praise God. Forever more.
[1:15:19] You can rejoice to know that your name
[1:15:23] is written in heaven. Praise God. Glory
[1:15:26] to God. What a wonderful, wonderful
[1:15:29] weekend we've been having here this
[1:15:31] weekend. Uh, you know, I I was I was
[1:15:35] scared coming into this weekend. I I'll
[1:15:37] be honest with you, okay? Because I I I
[1:15:41] know God can do anything.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and you know, like as the as
[1:15:46] the the pastor of the church, you know,
[1:15:48] there's just, you know, you just can't
[1:15:50] help it. You feel the weight of the
[1:15:52] whole event upon you. And boy were we
[1:15:54] praying.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; We were praying. We had a special prayer
[1:15:58] meeting on Wednesday night. Let me tell
[1:15:59] you, I knew after that.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; All is well.
[1:16:05] All is well. Amen. Glory to God. And
[1:16:09] he's proven it over and over and over
[1:16:12] again. Amen. And so I want to welcome
[1:16:15] every one of you here this weekend. We
[1:16:18] are honored truly to have you uh to be a
[1:16:22] part of this wonderful event. It's been
[1:16:24] I'm going to say about 28 or 29 years
[1:16:28] that um we've been holding this uh youth
[1:16:32] camp. We've had it in many different
[1:16:34] venues and different ways. You know,
[1:16:36] several years ago, um you know, I
[1:16:39] attended a a special event in Oakville,
[1:16:43] which was a a golf tournament which our
[1:16:45] company supported for many many years
[1:16:48] and I would attend that that event every
[1:16:50] year and one year it landed right on our
[1:16:54] youth camp weekend and so I was having
[1:16:57] lunch with the organizers because we're
[1:17:00] good friends and I said hey I'm not
[1:17:01] going to be able to make it this year
[1:17:02] but we're going to be supporting it
[1:17:04] regardless and they said oh why Dan you
[1:17:06] know what do you mean you can't I said
[1:17:08] well you know I've been my wife and I
[1:17:10] and Good Neighbor Ministries we've been
[1:17:12] running a a a youth camp for many many
[1:17:14] years and it landed right on that
[1:17:16] weekend and we're going to be there. He
[1:17:18] said, "Oh, that's fine. We understand
[1:17:19] that." A couple months later, he asked
[1:17:21] me, he says, he says, "Um, tell me a
[1:17:24] little bit about this camp that you know
[1:17:26] that you run." And I told him a bit
[1:17:27] about it. And and then a couple months
[1:17:30] later, he says, "Dan, we've decided that
[1:17:32] we're going to uh make your youth camp
[1:17:36] one of our uh fundraisers as part of our
[1:17:41] fundraising event." And I said,
[1:17:43] "Really?" He says, "Yeah." He says, "We
[1:17:46] think it's a wonderful thing that you're
[1:17:47] doing for our young people." And so, so,
[1:17:51] uh, they they decided that they were
[1:17:52] going to make us, um, you know, one of
[1:17:55] the, uh, receivers. They've run this
[1:17:58] event for over 45 years. They've raised
[1:18:01] hundreds and hundreds, possibly over a
[1:18:04] million and more in in funds to support
[1:18:08] different various unique organizations.
[1:18:11] And I just thank God that that that the
[1:18:14] Lord laid it on their hearts to support
[1:18:18] this ministry.
[1:18:20] Praise God forever more. Don't you ever
[1:18:23] underestimate anybody. You got to be out
[1:18:26] there as a light shining in the midst
[1:18:29] and letting them know that God is a
[1:18:31] reality. That God is first place in your
[1:18:34] life. That the Lord is that you're that
[1:18:36] you're you're you're a happy Christian.
[1:18:39] you're you've got the joy of the Lord in
[1:18:42] your lives to serve God. Amen. And when
[1:18:44] people see that, they'll get behind it.
[1:18:46] Even if they're not a part of it,
[1:18:48] they'll still become some way somehow
[1:18:51] God can use them. Amen. And so, I want
[1:18:53] to acknowledge the Oakville Invitational
[1:18:56] Golf Tournament that they've been
[1:18:58] running in supporting Good Neighbor
[1:19:00] Ministries young people events for many
[1:19:04] years in a very significant way. And
[1:19:06] that's how we've been able to, you know,
[1:19:09] to do these things and do them to the
[1:19:11] best of our capacity. Amen. Praise God.
[1:19:14] Along with your support, of course.
[1:19:18] Amen. So, I want to acknowledge here
[1:19:21] this morning, and I want to give our
[1:19:23] former pastor, John Simon, a minute to
[1:19:27] come and just say hello. This is our
[1:19:31] founding father here of Good Neighbor
[1:19:34] Ministries.
[1:19:36] He's he's our our our backbone for many
[1:19:39] many many years. Still supports us
[1:19:42] dramatically and and significantly with
[1:19:46] his spiritual support. I call him the
[1:19:48] chairman of the board. God bless you,
[1:19:51] pastor.
[1:19:54] Very exciting.
[1:19:56] Greetings to all of you. I'm very happy
[1:19:59] to be here this morning trusting that
[1:20:02] God will bless us each and everyone.
[1:20:06] And in everything that you do, remember
[1:20:08] to be in prayer for these meetings. Even
[1:20:12] while the preacher is in preaching, pray
[1:20:15] for him and pray for the congregation.
[1:20:20] Anything can happen.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Anything can happen.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Nelson knows this. I know this.
[1:20:29] Just been talking to people like this
[1:20:31] and all of a sudden a guy coughs up a
[1:20:33] cancer. What's that? The devil's scared
[1:20:37] of this kind of atmosphere.
[1:20:40] You've got to realize God is a reality.
[1:20:42] We're not imagining this faith. This is
[1:20:46] the unfailing reality of the living God.
[1:20:50] And uh praise the Lord. We're in the
[1:20:52] midst of it of the the uh I should say
[1:20:56] we are enveloped by the Holy Spirit.
[1:20:59] That is why we are here today because it
[1:21:02] struck our hearts and we thank God for
[1:21:06] the reality of this. Well, my time has
[1:21:08] passed. Actually, my time and brother
[1:21:10] Nelson's time has passed.
[1:21:14] We we we are old men now and our our
[1:21:20] swords are not dull, but they're still
[1:21:23] pretty sharp. But uh the fact is
[1:21:26] sometimes they are a little too sharp.
[1:21:29] And uh you see, but God had to use us to
[1:21:33] chop down the big trees,
[1:21:36] chop down all the bushes that were
[1:21:39] around so that uh the young brothers and
[1:21:43] evangelists of apostles and so on,
[1:21:46] teachers that they can plant the seed on
[1:21:49] good ground. But we had to deal with all
[1:21:52] the snakes and the spiders and
[1:21:56] everything else. Praise the Lord. And so
[1:21:59] God had to use us for that purpose. So
[1:22:02] sometimes we appear to our congregation
[1:22:04] to be rough. We appear to be direct. We
[1:22:07] pray to be this way, that way. And
[1:22:10] sometimes you know what people thinking
[1:22:12] of you, but they don't understand. So
[1:22:15] you just let it go. But just so you
[1:22:17] know, I'm saying it plainly now. I'm
[1:22:20] fully conscious that God use us as Acts
[1:22:24] 238s,
[1:22:26] you know, to be able to go with the axe
[1:22:29] to the roots.
[1:22:32] And if you're a modern, use 238 on you.
[1:22:35] So, uh, praise God. So,
[1:22:39] we thank God for all these wonderful,
[1:22:42] uh, brothers. We thank God for Brother
[1:22:45] Kid Diggs. uh and God bless his
[1:22:48] ministry. Of course, I watched the
[1:22:51] services every service and prayed for
[1:22:54] him that God will use him. And uh the
[1:22:58] today as we gather here and we are here
[1:23:01] together, I believe God has something
[1:23:03] special for you.
[1:23:13] And if you'll open your heart and look
[1:23:16] into it, let the word come in and he'll
[1:23:20] take control and God will let something
[1:23:23] break out in our midst. Amen. God will
[1:23:26] let it break out in our midst. And and
[1:23:29] you you you you don't think of how God
[1:23:32] works. We don't know how. But God breaks
[1:23:37] out in our midst.
[1:23:39] Some years ago, we are preaching and
[1:23:42] while we're preaching, somebody take the
[1:23:44] picture and the pillar of fire is in
[1:23:46] that tree of life.
[1:23:49] We still have the picture. The pillar of
[1:23:51] fire is in the tree of life. So, don't
[1:23:53] take anything for granted. The Holy
[1:23:57] Spirit moves softly and quietly and he
[1:24:01] just doesn't. You know what I'm saying?
[1:24:03] I'm not saying brother Dick should move
[1:24:05] like that. I'm just telling you the Holy
[1:24:07] Spirit moves like that.
[1:24:10] No, I just feel some people's thoughts,
[1:24:13] right? So, God bless you. Anyway, God
[1:24:16] bless.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother John. It's uh really
[1:24:25] been a tremendous honor to serve with
[1:24:29] him, next to him as a soldier of this
[1:24:33] revealed word for this day. I truly am
[1:24:36] honored. And so with us today also we
[1:24:38] have uh Pastor Lewis Nelson of Perfect
[1:24:42] Love Tabernacle. Let's give him a round
[1:24:44] of applause. God bless you.
[1:24:47] Amen.
[1:24:52] Amen. We've got Assistant Pastor Miguel
[1:24:55] Santana all the way from Quebec,
[1:24:57] Montreal.
[1:24:59] Montreal, Quebec. and and uh I'll tell
[1:25:01] you if um you know if you haven't

[1:26:35] brother Emmanuel saying how happy they
[1:26:37] are that they're, you know, most of
[1:26:39] their siblings are together here this
[1:26:41] weekend rejoicing around the word of
[1:26:44] God. So, we certainly um
[1:26:49] are grateful for that. Amen. Praise God.
[1:26:51] And you know, I want to get all the
[1:26:53] thank yous out of the way and I guess
[1:26:54] because we're going to go right to the
[1:26:55] word after this, but I want to thank
[1:26:58] Good Neighbor Ministries leadership and
[1:27:01] events coordinators. They have done an
[1:27:05] absolutely outstanding. They've gone
[1:27:08] beyond.
[1:27:10] Amen.
[1:27:12] Praise God.
[1:27:13] [Applause]
[1:27:15] you know, we've got a couple of young
[1:27:18] people, you know, and many of the young
[1:27:20] people were involved, but there's always
[1:27:21] those that have to, you know, they got
[1:27:23] to be the ones that are willing to take
[1:27:25] that first step, right, and move and
[1:27:27] move forward to do things that need to
[1:27:29] be done. And Michelle Brennan and um and
[1:27:32] Matteline and uh you know uh many of the
[1:27:36] other young people, but you see all
[1:27:39] these unique things. We've got our own
[1:27:41] ice cream parlor. you know, these are
[1:27:43] things that they they came up with and
[1:27:45] um they're just so creative in the way
[1:27:47] that they've they've organized these
[1:27:49] things. They've um they've uh supported
[1:27:51] in the marketing and getting the the
[1:27:54] message out to the young people and
[1:27:56] they've spearheaded in many ways. I want
[1:27:58] to acknowledge them and I want to thank
[1:28:00] them both.
[1:28:01] Amen. Thank you very much.
[1:28:07] Glory to God. uh brother Alvin, brother
[1:28:10] Mike Brennan, and sister Elaine and
[1:28:13] Sister Amanda, you know, they are
[1:28:16] tirelessly working behind the scenes to

[1:28:23] have done it with precision. Amen. May
[1:28:26] God bless and and prosper and bless each
[1:28:30] and everyone. all the cleaning
[1:28:33] committees, those that have been
[1:28:34] cooking, Sister Elizabeth behind the
[1:28:37] scenes directing and guiding the the the
[1:28:40] cleaning and the uh you know, there's so
[1:28:42] much that goes into these events. And
[1:28:44] and you know what? They have recognized
[1:28:48] that to do that and to do it out of the
[1:28:52] service unto the Lord, they're just
[1:28:54] heaping blessings upon their lives. They
[1:28:57] can't help it. Not that they're doing it
[1:28:59] because of that. No, they have a
[1:29:01] revelation. It's the same thing of, you
[1:29:03] know, when you give unto the Lord,
[1:29:04] you're tithing and everything else.
[1:29:06] You're robbing yourself when you don't
[1:29:08] get into your position and allow God to
[1:29:11] use you as a son or a daughter of God
[1:29:14] the way that he should. Amen. Praise
[1:29:15] God. So, I want to thank everyone from
[1:29:18] the the ushers to the to the doorkeepers
[1:29:21] to the to to the sound and engineering
[1:29:25] and and the musicians that have, you
[1:29:27] know, uh been there and the singers.
[1:29:30] Praise God. I just want to say thank you
[1:29:33] Lord for a wonderful wonderful team and
[1:29:37] local body of Jesus Christ. Amen. Praise
[1:29:40] God. Amen. Well, at this time we want to
[1:29:43] change the order of the event. Um, we
[1:29:46] are going to be having baptisms at the
[1:29:49] end of the service. And so at this time,
[1:29:53] we're going to sing word of God speak.
[1:29:56] We're going to ask the Holy Spirit to
[1:29:58] now take control of the atmosphere, take
[1:30:01] control of our dear brother Kyrie Diggs,
[1:30:04] who's come to be with us once again.
[1:30:07] anytime he has been here with us, the
[1:30:10] Lord has really been so good through his
[1:30:13] ministry and we are appreciating that.
[1:30:16] We are acknowledging his ministry. We
[1:30:18] are grateful for it and we will continue
[1:30:21] to support it and pray for him. Amen.

[1:33:02] quick. Amen.
[1:33:04] I can't I can't um go forward without
[1:33:09] giving my peace, saying my peace, but uh
[1:33:13] as as Pastor Danny said, uh
[1:33:18] God has been good. Amen. Amen.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; And I also want to pay homage to the
[1:33:25] pillars.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:28] Pastor Nelson, Pastor Simon,
[1:33:32] you know, I've been around a pretty long
[1:33:35] time by the grace of God,
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; sitting in those seats where you are.
[1:33:40] And those two brothers have been a
[1:33:42] blessing to me. Amen.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; You know, I can remember,
[1:33:47] and I'm pretty sure brother Pastor Simon
[1:33:49] may remember this, but him coming to the
[1:33:52] States and preaching at our church and
[1:33:54] preaching in the area. Back in those
[1:33:57] days, we used to follow the word,
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; you know what I mean? He he didn't just
[1:34:01] have to come to our church. We would go
[1:34:03] to the other churches, too.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; That's that's how bad we I mean, we love
[1:34:07] the revelation,
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; you know? So he would maybe come to
[1:34:10] Colombia and preach at four churches.
[1:34:13] We'd be at all four.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; But it was one particular message he
[1:34:19] preached called Beyond the Veil.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:23] Church. And we wind that tape and wind
[1:34:26] that it was tapes then. Hallelujah. Kind
[1:34:28] of telling how old I am.
[1:34:31] But it was it was tapes. And we would
[1:34:33] wind that tape and wind that tape. We
[1:34:35] actually popped the tape listening to it
[1:34:37] so much. But it was God speaking to his
[1:34:41] people. Amen.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; And I appreciate the gift within him and
[1:34:46] how much of a blessing he was. And and
[1:34:49] Pastor Nelson, me and him met in
[1:34:52] actually in the States and we've been
[1:34:55] friends ever since. Actually, Brother
[1:34:56] Nelson's is the first church I ever
[1:34:59] preached at in Canada.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Way back in the early 2000s. So, uh, I
[1:35:07] thank God for these two men. They've
[1:35:10] definitely been a blessing to me. And
[1:35:12] when you see young men like me, we're
[1:35:14] standing on their shoulders.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; We're standing on the thing that God did
[1:35:20] through them. Like, like Pastor Simon
[1:35:22] said, the battles they had to fight, we
[1:35:25] ain't got to fight.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? I mean
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; being called serpent seed and all all
[1:35:32] kind of stuff, you know, for the gospel,
[1:35:35] we certainly appreciate them. Amen. And
[1:35:38] uh I I thank God I have a pastor back
[1:35:41] home. I thank God for my pastor also.
[1:35:43] He's like their peers, Pastor Charles
[1:35:46] Anderson. So, uh, when you see pillars
[1:35:49] like that, you ought to be thankful,
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; you know, cuz it was something real
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; because they still here.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, we uh definitely
[1:36:02] appreciate them and and brother Danny.
[1:36:04] Amen. Brother Miguel. Amen. Brother
[1:36:07] Danny, he's special to me cuz soon as we
[1:36:10] get together, it just started clicking.
[1:36:13] Amen. It starts to clicking. you know,
[1:36:14] things that I'mma preach. He started
[1:36:16] talking about it. So, I so I know I'm in
[1:36:18] the will of God. Amen.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; And I hope you as a young person don't
[1:36:23] take this lightly, but this is something
[1:36:25] God is doing.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; It's not Yeah, we're vessels and God is
[1:36:30] using us, but it's him.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; It's his spirit. Hallelujah. God put
[1:36:35] this together. Amen.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; So, I'mma I'mma I'mma try to preach
[1:36:39] today using this this lapel. So, y'all
[1:36:42] pray for me. Amen. Uh, let us all stand
[1:36:45] to our feet. Amen. I love coming to
[1:36:48] Canada. You know, a friend of mine, like
[1:36:51] I said, I've been coming here a long
[1:36:52] time. A friend of mine called me and
[1:36:54] asked me, "Uh, are you going to be in
[1:36:58] town this weekend?" I said, "No." He
[1:37:00] said, "Where you going?" I said, "I'm
[1:37:01] going to Canada." He said, "Brother
[1:37:03] Diggs,
[1:37:04] only thing left for you to do in Canada
[1:37:06] is buy a house."
[1:37:10] Anybody want to help me out?
[1:37:15] Amen. I love it. You know, uh I love the
[1:37:18] people of Canada. One time, a funny
[1:37:21] story, one time I came to I was uh
[1:37:24] passing through customs and you know,
[1:37:26] they grab your passport.
[1:37:28] It's a lot more tech technical now, the
[1:37:31] pictures and all this stuff, but they
[1:37:32] would stamp your passport. And the guy
[1:37:35] was looking at my passport and flipping
[1:37:38] through it. He saw all those Canadian
[1:37:41] stamps.
[1:37:43] and and he didn't even stamp my my
[1:37:45] passport. He gave it back to me and say,
[1:37:48] "Welcome home."
[1:37:53] So, I love you. I hope you love me.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we we we count it a privilege
[1:37:59] to be here. We thank God for all that
[1:38:02] the Lord is doing. Amen. Let's just uh
[1:38:05] bow our heads. I hope we don't have the
[1:38:07] Holy Spirit on the time clock today.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just pray and and expect God
[1:38:16] to do what he's always done.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; You know, I believe that the pillar of
[1:38:20] fire is moving right now.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; I believe it's in this room. Somebody
[1:38:24] ought to challenge God and say, "Lord,
[1:38:26] show yourself."
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, I know you here. Show yourself.
[1:38:30] Pull your camera out. Take a picture.
[1:38:32] Show yourself, God. That's how real He
[1:38:35] is.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's Let's pray. Let's raise our
[1:38:38] hands to the Lord. Lord, Father God, we
[1:38:40] give you all the glory and honor. For
[1:38:44] truly you are worthy, Lord. Lord,
[1:38:47] there's nothing else we could say,
[1:38:48] nothing else we could do except but give
[1:38:51] you the honor, Lord.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; Lord, because if you don't do anything
[1:38:55] else, you've done enough, Lord. We're
[1:38:57] here under the merits of your spirit and
[1:39:01] your grace, Lord, in our right minds,
[1:39:03] Lord, with the blood atoning over our
[1:39:06] lives, Lord. and you made us a brand
[1:39:09] plucked out of the fire.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; And Lord, you see those situations that
[1:39:13] stand before you, Lord. I I even have my
[1:39:16] hand raised, Lord God, to put my need
[1:39:20] before you, Lord.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; And Lord, you see all the other needs in
[1:39:23] this room. But Lord, we want to desire
[1:39:28] that of your perfect will
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; and that alone. So Lord God,
[1:39:34] keep the potter's hands upon us and mold
[1:39:37] us into the image of your mind. And
[1:39:39] Lord, be with us in this service. Lord,
[1:39:42] forgive us for anything that's not like
[1:39:44] you, Lord. And let the blessings of the
[1:39:46] Holy Spirit dominate this service. In
[1:39:49] the wonderful name of Jesus Christ, we
[1:39:51] pray. The church say, "Amen."
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:39:56] If you um have your Bibles,
[1:40:00] let's turn to Isaiah chapter 5.
[1:40:08] Isaiah chapter 5. Y'all know I I I
[1:40:12] really don't plan on being long, but you
[1:40:16] control the gift. Amen.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Isaiah chapter 5.
[1:40:33] I really do appreciate what the Lord has
[1:40:35] done here this weekend
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; and what he's going to do today.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's worthy.
[1:40:42] Isaiah 5 and I mean I'm sorry Isaiah
[1:40:45] chapter 6.
[1:40:48] Isaiah 6. And let's start reading at
[1:40:50] verse one.
[1:40:54] The Bible says in the year that King
[1:40:57] Uzziah
[1:40:58] died. I saw also the Lord sitting upon a
[1:41:02] throne high and lifted up and his train
[1:41:07] filled the temple. Above it stood the
[1:41:10] seraraphims. Each one had six wings.
[1:41:13] With twain he covered his face, and with
[1:41:16] twain he covered his feet, and with
[1:41:19] twain he did fly. And one cried unto the
[1:41:23] other, and said, "Holy, holy, holy is
[1:41:26] the Lord of hosts. The whole earth is
[1:41:29] full of his glory."
[1:41:31] And the post of the door moved at the
[1:41:34] voice of him that cried, and the house
[1:41:37] was filled with smoke. Then said I, woe
[1:41:41] is me.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Now this is how we ought to feel in the
[1:41:46] presence of the Lord.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; That when God's glory come in.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We ought to stand in awe and
[1:41:56] say, "Lord,
[1:41:58] to you be all the glory and honor."
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; He says, "Woe is me, for I am undone
[1:42:07] because I am a man of unclean lips, and
[1:42:10] I dwell in the midst of a people
[1:42:13] of unclean lips.
[1:42:16] For my eyes have seen the king, the Lord
[1:42:19] of hosts. Then flew one of the
[1:42:22] seraraphins unto me, having a live cold
[1:42:26] in his hand, which he had taken with the
[1:42:30] tongue from off the f off the altar. And
[1:42:33] he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo,
[1:42:37] this have touched thy lips, and thine
[1:42:40] iniquity is taken away, and thine sin
[1:42:44] purged. This is what happens when the
[1:42:47] Holy Ghost fills you.
[1:42:51] Also I heard a voice of the Lord saying,
[1:42:55] "Whom shall I send and who will go for
[1:42:59] us?" Then said, "I here am I. Send me."
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Let's go to 1st Samuel chapter 17.
[1:43:15] 1st Samuel 17.
[1:43:18] Just to make the reading short,
[1:43:22] let's start at verse um 26.
[1:43:28] 1st Samuel 17 and 26.
[1:43:36] Ah, I love that sound pages.
[1:44:00] shall be done.
[1:44:03] Let me let me Yeah. What shall be done
[1:44:07] to the man that kleth this Philistine?
[1:44:11] And taketh away the reproach from
[1:44:13] Israel.
[1:44:15] For who is this uncircumcised Philistine
[1:44:19] that he should defy the armies of the
[1:44:23] living God?
[1:44:25] And the people answered him after this
[1:44:27] manner, saying, So shall it be done to
[1:44:30] the man that kleth him. And Eliab his
[1:44:34] oldest brother heard when he spake unto
[1:44:37] the men. And Eliab anger again was
[1:44:41] kindled against David. And he said, Why
[1:44:44] camest thou down hither, and with whom
[1:44:48] hast thou left those few sheep in the
[1:44:51] wilderness? I know thy pride and thy
[1:44:55] naughtiness
[1:44:56] of thine heart, for thou art come down,
[1:45:01] that thou mightest see the battle. And
[1:45:04] David said,
[1:45:06] What have I now done? Is there not a
[1:45:09] cause?
[1:45:11] Amen. May the Lord add a blessing to the
[1:45:13] reading of his word. You can have your
[1:45:15] seats.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord,
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; church. This morning,
[1:45:27] I want this message to be real personal
[1:45:29] to you.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we we we said last night,
[1:45:36] what good is it for us to have these
[1:45:38] meetings and nobody get closer to God?
[1:45:42] What good is it to have these meetings
[1:45:45] and you walk out of here with the same
[1:45:48] struggles, the same problems,
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; you know? And
[1:45:54] my thought this morning
[1:45:56] for all of us is
[1:46:00] if not me, then who?
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; If not me,
[1:46:08] then who?
[1:46:10] That's why I want you young people to
[1:46:12] ask that question.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; If not me, then who?
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; We believe that we're in the last days.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; We're in the last church age.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; There's nobody coming after us.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; So whatever God promised in his word, it
[1:46:30] has to be fulfilled by a people.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; So I'm saying today, if not me,
[1:46:38] then who? Hallelujah. If not us,
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; then who? Hallelujah.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; If the power of God in full
[1:46:46] manifestation is supposed to move on
[1:46:48] this earth through our young people,
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; if not you, then who?
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; The scripture says, hallelujah. And we
[1:46:57] heard it through a vindicated prophet.
[1:47:00] If there is another book of Acts, it'll
[1:47:03] be just like it was in the book of Acts.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; So if not you, then who?
[1:47:09] [Applause]
[1:47:11] It has to be us.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; Every church, every group of young
[1:47:21] people
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; before you,
[1:47:24] they had God revelation by measure.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; But unto us, we have the fullness of
[1:47:32] God.
[1:47:35] Yes, sir.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; We know everything it takes to get to
[1:47:40] heaven.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; We had a prophet who came and he didn't
[1:47:46] preach in part. He preached perfect
[1:47:49] faith,
[1:47:51] [Applause]
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; perfect love,
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; divine healing.
[1:48:02] So I'll say church if anybody hallelujah
[1:48:08] should be able to step in perfection
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; it should be us
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; if anybody
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; by the grace of God
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; should be able to demonstrate all that
[1:48:28] God is
[1:48:30] all that he said he should do.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; It should be us.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; If not me,
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; then who?
[1:48:39] [Applause]
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; If not you, then who?
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; You young people?
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; This is your day.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; This is your time.
[1:48:54] Hallelujah.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; If anybody should be able to look the
[1:48:59] devil in the face
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; and say, "I know my God.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; I know who he is.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; I know what he's capable of.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; If not me, if not you, then who?
[1:49:22] See, the Holy Spirit is already moving.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; It don't take 30 minutes of preaching
[1:49:27] for your prayers to be answered.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:33] It don't take 45 minutes of church for
[1:49:37] God to bless your heart.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If not now, then when?
[1:49:44] [Music]
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:48] But church, I want you to understand,
[1:49:50] oo, I'm feeling lightfooted this
[1:49:53] morning.
[1:49:55] You know a boxer before he fight, he
[1:49:57] feel lightfooted. Hallelujah. He starts
[1:50:00] to bounce around a little bit.
[1:50:02] Hallelujah. Because he remembers his
[1:50:05] technique. Hallelujah. And he starts to
[1:50:08] get lightooted before the battle.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; Church, it's time for us. Hallelujah. to
[1:50:15] stop babysitting the gifts inside.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; We have people right here in this
[1:50:25] building.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; They have supernatural testimonies.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Supernatural testimonies.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; You see this young man right here?
[1:50:35] Hallelujah. The devil tried to kill him
[1:50:37] while he was in Portugal. A professional
[1:50:40] football player. But God
[1:50:49] If not you, then who? Come on. Come on.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; You think God saved you for death just
[1:50:56] to sit around in church? No. There's
[1:50:58] something God want you to do.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. Come on.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; And to every young person in here,
[1:51:09] you're hearing this thought because God
[1:51:11] got something from you. Amen.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; He got something for you.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; But church, hallelujah.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; Look church, if we ask that question,
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; if not me, then who?
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says, Hallelujah. When
[1:51:29] the seventh angel begin to sound,
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; the mystery of God
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; will be finished.
[1:51:39] Come on.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; So, if we're at the finish line,
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; somebody should be showing me something.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There should be
[1:51:52] evidence that you're in first place.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; We're not in the back of the race.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; We're in the front.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; God put us out front.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Cuz remember, church, hallelujah, it was
[1:52:05] the seventh seal that revealed the first
[1:52:08] seal. So the seven seal had to open
[1:52:11] first.
[1:52:14] [Applause]
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Stuff they're still debating about. But
[1:52:23] God said, hallelujah, through a prophet
[1:52:26] that he'll raise up young people
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; that'll live this message
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; and make it come off the pages.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But I want you to understand
[1:52:39] something. Hallelujah. What you're
[1:52:41] seeing,
[1:52:43] what you're looking at
[1:52:45] is the fulfillment of prophecy.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:49] Prophecy is a fortold future event.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; It's something that seemed hallelujah
[1:53:00] that will come to pass.
[1:53:03] And just to give you a little insight,
[1:53:05] I never wanted to be a preacher.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; I wanted to be a football player.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; Go Cowboys.
[1:53:13] [Applause]
[1:53:17] Hallelujah.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; But church, God had other plans.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; So you know, after he allowed me to get
[1:53:25] cast in my brain, there was a purpose.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You say, "Oh, the devil, you
[1:53:31] did this." I hate even mentioning the
[1:53:33] devil's name in church.
[1:53:39] Hallelujah. Only time I like to talk
[1:53:42] about spirits is to cast them out.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; But what we do too often in our
[1:53:47] Christian journey, young and old, we
[1:53:49] talk about what the devil is doing.
[1:53:50] That's right.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; The devil did this. The devil did that.
[1:53:54] The devil messing with my children.
[1:53:56] Devil made me lose my job. Devil broke
[1:53:58] down my car. Everything ain't the devil.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Some things God do just to awaken you.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Something God do. Hallelujah. It's the
[1:54:13] process of stripping away your spiritual
[1:54:16] amnesia.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:19] [Applause]
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; And church.
[1:54:24] Hallelujah. God allowed me
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; to get cancer in my brain.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; And for those of you who don't know me,
[1:54:31] you would have never known that if I
[1:54:33] would have told you.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; That's how good the grace of God is.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; When God do something, he really does
[1:54:42] it.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when I talk God, Amen. I don't
[1:54:52] talk especially healing. I don't talk
[1:54:54] about, you know, uh, I'm in remission. I
[1:54:58] ain't in no remission.
[1:55:01] [Applause]
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; If God ever heals you, it's done and
[1:55:07] over.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; It's over.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; It's over.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; I ain't looking for cancer to come back.
[1:55:22] It can't come back
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; because now, hallelujah, there's a
[1:55:26] greater power living in this body.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; But God would allow you to go through
[1:55:33] things just to what God does. You be
[1:55:37] minding your own business and he bump
[1:55:38] into you.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; I was minding my own business, playing
[1:55:43] football. Football. Hallelujah.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Not soccer. football.
[1:55:50] [Applause]
[1:55:52] That's me in his thing. Hallelujah. But
[1:55:54] you know, church, I was minding my own
[1:55:56] business and God bumped into me and he
[1:56:00] allowed,
[1:56:01] let me say this. If you going through
[1:56:04] anything,
[1:56:06] look at what you going through. Could it
[1:56:08] be that God wants to get glory out of
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Come on now,
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; I can't stop this. I can't stop that.
[1:56:20] But when God comes on the scene,
[1:56:23] [Music]
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; and he takes it from you,
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; he did that
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; so he could get glory.
[1:56:35] [Music]
[1:56:38] God will let the devil loose.
[1:56:41] Hallelujah. Just to hold him in a cola
[1:56:43] and say, "Don't you move until I tell
[1:56:45] you to."
[1:56:48] [Applause]
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Look, cancer in my brain. I ain't going
[1:56:55] to go through the whole testimony. Y'all
[1:56:56] done heard it. But church, what was it?
[1:57:01] God knew
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; that I was a seed.
[1:57:05] He knew he put something in me.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; But his thing was,
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; how do I awaken it?
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; I need to awaken it.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; I need to awaken it in such a way that
[1:57:20] he'll know it was nobody but me.
[1:57:24] [Applause]
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; I need to do something in his life that
[1:57:31] nobody else will get the credit but me.
[1:57:34] I need to do something in his life.
[1:57:36] Hallelujah. No matter what he go
[1:57:38] through, he'll never forget what I did.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah,
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; church. So, he allowed me to get canc.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, I'm going I'm not going
[1:57:55] to go through all the healing, the
[1:57:56] supernatural things that God did. Oh,
[1:57:58] and it was supernatural.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If God does anything,
[1:58:03] hallelujah, he'll do it by his
[1:58:05] attributes.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; God is a healer. He can't help himself.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; He has to be that. Hallelujah.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; But the question is, will you put him in
[1:58:15] position to be that?
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You make him what he is.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:22] You make him a healer.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Somebody had to be sick for him to be a
[1:58:26] healer. You make him a deliverer.
[1:58:29] Somebody had to be bound so he can be a
[1:58:32] deliverer.
[1:58:33] You make him a savior. Somebody had to
[1:58:36] be lost,
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; church. I was lost, but I made him
[1:58:47] savior.
[1:58:49] [Music]
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I feel like having a praise
[1:58:55] break. Hallelujah.
[1:58:58] I feel like having a praise break. I
[1:59:00] feel like having a praise break. I feel
[1:59:03] like having a praise break. I feel like
[1:59:06] having a praise break. I feel like
[1:59:08] having a praise break. I feel like
[1:59:11] having a praise break. I feel like
[1:59:14] having a praise break.
[1:59:17] I feel like having a break.
[1:59:22] I feel like having a praise break.
[1:59:28] Is he good? Is he good? Is he good? Is
[1:59:33] he good? I feel like having a praise
[1:59:36] break.
[1:59:40] Hallelujah.
[1:59:42] Hallelujah.
[1:59:44] Hallelujah.
[1:59:46] Hallelujah.
[1:59:49] Come on, somebody.
[1:59:52] Has he been good to you?
[1:59:57] church.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; We we we sing a song back home and it
[2:00:03] says, "Don't wait till the battle is
[2:00:06] over.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; You ought to shout now."
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Church, I got a song in my
[2:00:16] heart right now and it says, "I'm going
[2:00:20] to see a victory.
[2:00:22] I'm going to see a victory
[2:00:26] for the battle belong to the Lord.
[2:00:31] I'm going to see a victory.
[2:00:34] I'm going to see a victory
[2:00:38] for the battle belong to the Lord. How
[2:00:43] many of you got the victory?
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; How many got the victory?
[2:00:48] Hallelujah.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; Church,
[2:00:52] I stand here because I'm a product of
[2:00:55] victory.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; Let me let me let me calm down a little
[2:01:01] bit.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; I know. I know some of you saying,
[2:01:04] "Well, where he going to preach?" My
[2:01:06] life is a message.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; God's been good to me. Hallelujah. The
[2:01:17] prophet of God will say, "Hallelujah.
[2:01:19] You could preach me a sermon, but I'd
[2:01:20] rather you lift me one."
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Church, think about it. Canceling my
[2:01:27] brain. What was happening? God knew that
[2:01:31] there was a seed inside.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; And I know some of you, you may be here
[2:01:35] visiting loved ones or this is your
[2:01:37] first time on this side of the world or
[2:01:39] different things. You're from different
[2:01:41] churches. But let me tell you something.
[2:01:43] It's not by coincidence.
[2:01:46] Come on now.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; That you are here.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; Because God is bumping into you.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; He wants to wake up that life inside.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I come to visit some
[2:02:03] friends." And here comes God. Boop.
[2:02:07] Here comes God. He bumps into you. What
[2:02:09] does he do? He gets your attention.
[2:02:11] Yeah,
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; I never felt that before.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But church, God bumped into
[2:02:17] me. He allowed the enemy, hallelujah, to
[2:02:21] send his imps loose, canceling my brain.
[2:02:24] Hallelujah. But I had an angel with me.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; It wasn't Gabriel. It wasn't Michael. It
[2:02:32] was mama.
[2:02:34] [Applause]
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; I didn't have the Holy Ghost, but she
[2:02:40] did. Hallelujah.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, she stood in the gap.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; She came in my room. She said, "Son, you
[2:02:47] don't have to accept this because God
[2:02:49] has already healed you."
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something, church. What
[2:02:54] you're looking for God to do, he's
[2:02:56] already did it.
[2:03:02] If not now, then when?
[2:03:06] Hallelujah, church. So, Hallelujah.
[2:03:09] Cancer comes. But what is the purpose of
[2:03:12] cancer or the trial? Cancer was the only
[2:03:16] thing that could awaken a revelation
[2:03:18] that was in my seat.
[2:03:21] [Music]
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; What did it awaken? Hallelujah. Cancer
[2:03:25] was the only thing that could wake up.
[2:03:28] Hallelujah.
[2:03:29] I'm the Lord thy God
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; that health thee from all thy diseases.
[2:03:36] So God let cancer come my way just to
[2:03:40] awaken Jehovah
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; Rafa
[2:03:45] just to awaken.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; Just to awaken. Hallelujah. There's
[2:03:49] something in you that God is trying to
[2:03:51] awaken this morning.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And once Jehovah Rapha, the
[2:03:57] revelation of who he is was awakened, it
[2:04:00] was over.
[2:04:03] Hallelujah.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; It was over.
[2:04:07] &gt;&gt; The devil was done.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; Because the seed started to come to
[2:04:11] life.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; And everything that was in that seed
[2:04:15] start to push out.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; What did that God bumping into me?
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; See, amen. We give the devil too much
[2:04:25] credit.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; We say, "God, God, the devil did. The
[2:04:29] devil did that." And we go into prayer
[2:04:31] talking about the devil.
[2:04:35] Oh God, the devil's been fighting me.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; Oh God,
[2:04:41] the sickness is I don't know if I can
[2:04:44] take it. The devil. Oh, he's ranting and
[2:04:47] raging. Oh God, it's the same old devil.
[2:04:54] And this is your prayer.
[2:04:58] God is sitting there like going like
[2:05:04] Are they talking about me yet?
[2:05:11] &gt;&gt; There's no one like Jehovah. There's no
[2:05:13] one like Jehovah. There's no one like
[2:05:16] Jehovah. And they talking about me yet.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; You ain't going to get his attention
[2:05:22] talking about the devil.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; But he says if I be lifted up.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:31] Hey, hey, y'all better get it together
[2:05:34] cuz they pulling hard over here.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; This side pulling hard over here.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost is moving
[2:05:42] over here.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; I don't know what the rest of y'all
[2:05:45] going to do, but y'all better come on.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; But church, fast forward now. I'm in the
[2:05:54] ministry. Hallelujah. Still a young man.
[2:05:57] I'm still a young man.
[2:05:59] [Applause]
[2:06:02] I got a promise.
[2:06:04] You know, some people don't believe in
[2:06:05] youth meetings. Hallelujah. They don't
[2:06:08] believe in Thessalonians then.
[2:06:10] Hallelujah. Cuz the Bible says that the
[2:06:12] sky is going to crack and we'll be
[2:06:14] changed in a moment of a twinkling eye.
[2:06:17] That's going to be the biggest youth
[2:06:19] meeting ever.
[2:06:30] That's going to be the biggest youth
[2:06:32] ever.
[2:06:34] I said ever.
[2:06:37] Ever. Ever. That's going to be the
[2:06:40] biggest youth beat ever.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; The Bible says we'll be changed in a
[2:06:50] moment of a twinkling of an eye.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; And they don't believe in youth.
[2:06:54] meetings. Well, let me say it like this.
[2:06:57] If not me,
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; then who?
[2:07:07] If not me, then who?
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; If not me, then who? If not you, then
[2:07:16] who?
[2:07:18] [Applause]
[2:07:22] They just He just be He just be exciting
[2:07:24] the young people, man. Shut up.

[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; Ain't going to be no seats in heaven.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Come on.
[2:07:41] Come on now.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; You think you going to be in heaven
[2:07:46] controlling your emotions?
[2:07:52] [Music]
[2:07:52] [Applause]
[2:07:57] And some of you won't even raise it
[2:07:58] high.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; God don't see that praise.
[2:08:07] You think the glory of God. Hallelujah.
[2:08:10] You know I love talking about heaven.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; Let's go to heaven for a second.
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; Does anybody want to go to heaven for a
[2:08:16] second?
[2:08:18] Let's go to heaven first.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; Let's go to heaven first.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; Church, think about it. After we've
[2:08:26] hallelujah, come out of Latinia. I don't
[2:08:29] know about you, but I'm already out.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; I'm already out.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; I'm in a bright age.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Church, think about it. Now we're in
[2:08:43] heaven. Hallelujah. What is it going to
[2:08:46] be like? It's going to be worship.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's going to be some
[2:08:53] worship.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; Y'all think Maverick City wrote them
[2:08:56] songs for them? No. They wrote it for
[2:08:59] the pride.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; I can't be quiet. My God is alive. How
[2:09:06] can I keep it inside?
[2:09:09] I won't be quiet. My God is alive. How
[2:09:13] can I keep it inside?
[2:09:16] Praise
[2:09:20] the Lord, oh my soul. Everybody say,
[2:09:27] "The Lord of my soul."
[2:09:31] Think about it, church.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; See, you feel that
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; some of you, it's hard for you to get in
[2:09:39] that channel. Trust me, you better do it
[2:09:41] down here. Cuz
[2:09:44] the prophet said whatever you are down
[2:09:46] here is what you going to be over there.
[2:09:51] And if you can't give God praise down
[2:09:53] here
[2:10:05] meat.
[2:10:15] [Applause]
[2:10:26] Ah, brother D. Brother D just so
[2:10:28] emotional. Yes, I am.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; Prophet say if your religion ain't got
[2:10:34] no emotion in it, you need to bury it.
[2:10:38] [Applause]
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; You need to bury it.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelu. We fight. Why don't we fight
[2:10:44] against the young people having a good
[2:10:46] time?
[2:10:48] If they can't have a good time in
[2:10:50] church, where can they have a good time?
[2:10:54] Huh?
[2:10:56] Huh? If we can't praise the Lord in
[2:10:58] church, where can we praise the Lord?
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; If I can't act a fool in church, why
[2:11:06] can't I act a fool?
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:13] Brother, that was that was just a lot of
[2:11:15] streaming. It was just emotion.
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; What makes it emotion?
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; The messenger said he said when the Holy
[2:11:26] Spirit
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; comes,
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; come on now.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; He brings in emotion.
[2:11:37] [Applause]
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; You say, "Really, Brother Diggs?" Yes.
[2:11:43] Because the Holy Spirit is a person
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; and any person without emotion is dead.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; So if God if the Holy Spirit is a person
[2:11:54] that means that person is alive,
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; my experience is a lie.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; Your experience is a lie.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; Devil say you know that's just emotion.
[2:12:09] What makes an emotion is if you scream,
[2:12:12] shout, dance, kick, holler, scream,
[2:12:15] hallelujah, and then the next day you
[2:12:19] live contrary to what you did, that was
[2:12:22] just emotional.
[2:12:26] But if you kick up,
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; you dance, you shout, hallelujah, and
[2:12:31] you leave this meeting next week, you
[2:12:33] still dancing, you still shouting. That
[2:12:37] wasn't emotion.
[2:12:39] That was coming into his presence.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:12:44] [Applause]
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; Oh my Oh my church.
[2:12:48] Now I'm preaching.
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; I ain't talking about right now.
[2:12:53] I'm talking about my life
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; now. I'm preaching and God comes.
[2:13:00] God comes and he says to me,
[2:13:03] "Hallelujah.
[2:13:06] I had to take some services
[2:13:09] in another pastor's church. My young
[2:13:11] guy, not even out preaching much."
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But he called me to do a
[2:13:16] youth meeting.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; Call me to do a youth meeting.
[2:13:22] Pastor Jackson. Hallelujah. So church,
[2:13:26] we get there and we start having some
[2:13:29] church. They start singing and
[2:13:31] worshiping a powerful anointing.
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; Like how these young people was handling
[2:13:35] these gifts this morning. That's what I
[2:13:37] love.
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; I love to see young people that's going
[2:13:39] to worship.
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; Don't get up here tonight.
[2:13:44] [Music]
[2:13:51] That girl handled that thing just
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; the same thing. God
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; The the the Bible says Hallelujah. Amen.

[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. and your ministry. Hallelujah. You
[2:14:19] are to fully dedicate it to God.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; Don't come up G. Don't come up giving up
[2:14:25] a half voice. Give We want the full
[2:14:27] voice.
[2:14:29] &gt;&gt; We want that voice when you at home in
[2:14:31] your mirror
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; and you bringing it down and it's
[2:14:34] coming. Hallelujah. That's what we want.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; We want all of you. Amen.
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; But church, now I'm in this church.
[2:14:43] Hallelujah. I'm in this church and we
[2:14:46] worship Holy Spirit moving like it's
[2:14:48] doing right now.
[2:14:51] [Applause]
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; Like it's doing right now.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; And her sister was sitting on the front
[2:15:00] row. She said she started seeing
[2:15:02] something.
[2:15:04] She said and she thought it was an evil
[2:15:07] spirit and she thought it was something
[2:15:09] she was doing. So she got up and ran to
[2:15:12] the bathroom.
[2:15:14] And when she went in the bathroom,
[2:15:17] she started repenting. She said, "Lord,
[2:15:20] forgive me. I don't know what's going
[2:15:21] on, but if there's anything I'm doing,
[2:15:23] Lord, please forgive me. Forgive me for
[2:15:26] my sins." Hallelujah. Because of what
[2:15:28] she was seeing. So, she said, "God
[2:15:30] speaks to her and say, "Hey, go back out
[2:15:32] there. There's something I want to tell
[2:15:34] I want you to tell my servant."
[2:15:36] Hallelujah. And while I'm preaching, she
[2:15:38] comes back and sits on the front row.
[2:15:41] Now, I'm telling this because this is
[2:15:43] her testimony,
[2:15:45] &gt;&gt; but I'm a part of it.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; Just like you are a part of my
[2:15:50] testimony.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; And when I finish this testimony, you
[2:15:54] going to see what I'm talking about.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; But church, she said she sit on the
[2:15:58] front. She see me.
[2:16:00] She said, but while I'm preaching, she
[2:16:03] sees two of me.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She said, "This me right
[2:16:08] here steps into this me behind the pull
[2:16:11] pit."
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And this me begins to preach
[2:16:16] and then it steps back out
[2:16:18] and then it steps back in and preach.
[2:16:22] She said, "Every time this me stepped
[2:16:25] into this me, I will speak to the
[2:16:27] church." She said, and she was watching
[2:16:30] that and seeing and she was like, "Lord,
[2:16:32] I don't know what's happening. What's
[2:16:33] going on with me?" She He said, "Sit
[2:16:35] still." He said God, she said God be to
[2:16:37] minister to her and say remember the
[2:16:40] prophet said that there are supernatural
[2:16:43] beings right in this room right now.
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; He said but the natural eye can't see
[2:16:47] it.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; Your healing is in this room right now.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; The angel of healing is in this room.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; The angel of deliverance is in this
[2:17:03] room.
[2:17:05] The angel of joy
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; is in this room
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; and the minister of faith is in this
[2:17:13] room.
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; You ain't going to be able to see it
[2:17:16] with your natural eye.
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; You have to tap in by faith.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; She said, but as she was watching it,
[2:17:22] hallelujah, God be to take her back what
[2:17:25] she heard on books and tapes.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said the Lord said to
[2:17:32] her, he said, remember that dimension is
[2:17:36] just a little bit faster than the
[2:17:37] natural eye.
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; And saying what you're watching is his
[2:17:42] theophony.
[2:17:43] [Applause]
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; He said God told her his theophony is
[2:17:49] giving the word to him and then he
[2:17:52] preaches what the theophony gives him
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; and the theophony keeps stepping. What
[2:17:56] is a theophony? It's a word body.
[2:17:59] It's your representation in heaven.
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, she was watching my
[2:18:05] representation. Hallelujah. Give me a
[2:18:07] word for the people.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; But the only way my word body would give
[2:18:13] you a word is only that you got
[2:18:16] representation too.
[2:18:20] Amen.
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; You were in heaven also.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; That's the only way God would minister
[2:18:31] to you. You also had to be there,
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; church. So, she's watching my theophony.
[2:18:40] Hallelujah. Give this body, my flesh
[2:18:42] body, a word. Hallelujah. For the
[2:18:44] people. And then she said that God told
[2:18:47] her, "Hallelujah,
[2:18:49] I want you to tell him
[2:18:52] that I called him." Hallelujah.
[2:18:55] [Applause]
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, I didn't come out of a
[2:19:00] time where, you know, I Oh my, I'm I'm
[2:19:03] studying and I think I'm a preacher. No.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Mm-m.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; Vindication,
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; waiting on God,
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; not moving until you get to say so.
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; You know, nowadays, people feel like
[2:19:19] they can because they can read the same
[2:19:20] quotes and and all this stuff that they
[2:19:22] can tell the preachers what to do
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; cuz they reading the same thing. What
[2:19:26] you fail to realize, there's a gift
[2:19:28] there.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's not by knowledge. It's
[2:19:32] a gift there. Hallelujah. She says, "I
[2:19:35] want you." He said, God says to her,
[2:19:37] "And look, I'm not lifting myself up."
[2:19:39] Hallelujah.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; But I'm telling you this because he's
[2:19:42] still the same God.
[2:19:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; Look, she says, God said to her, say,
[2:19:48] look, I want you to tell him that I
[2:19:50] called him. Hallelujah. I called this
[2:19:52] ministry and I'm going to take his
[2:19:54] ministry in places that he could only
[2:19:57] imagine.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to bless him.
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:03] Amen.
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; At that time, I didn't know Pastor Simon
[2:20:09] or Pastor Nelson.
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; But I've been to Canada countless times.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; Fulfillment of what? Prophecy.
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Take me in places I can only
[2:20:22] imagine.
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; Last Christmas, I was in the
[2:20:25] Philippines, me and some brothers, and
[2:20:27] we were and I had no desire to go there.
[2:20:29] We were going to the Philippines. The
[2:20:31] brother asked me, he say, "Brother
[2:20:32] Diggs, have you been to all the
[2:20:34] continents?" And I was like, "Huh?
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; Geography wasn't my strongest part."
[2:20:42] Continent.
[2:20:46] Only continent I know of is Africa.
[2:20:58] But then I say, "What? What? What kind
[2:21:00] you talking about? They said, "I'm in
[2:21:01] the seven seven continents." And they
[2:21:03] started to naming them. Say, "Yeah, been
[2:21:04] there." Name another. I said, "Yeah,
[2:21:06] I've been there." See, I can't even name
[2:21:08] them back to you.
[2:21:12] Yeah, I've been there. Yeah, I've been
[2:21:14] there. Yeah, I've been there.
[2:21:16] Because
[2:21:18] I'm a fulfillment of prophecy.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; I've been to six of the seven
[2:21:23] continents.
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Preaching God's word.
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; Come on. But it ain't because I got deep
[2:21:29] pockets.
[2:21:32] [Laughter]
[2:21:34] &gt;&gt; It's a fulfillment of prophecy.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; And the only reason why I'm here today
[2:21:39] is because it's also a fulfillment of
[2:21:43] prophecy.
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; And you are a part of that prophecy.
[2:21:51] You are a part of what God is doing in
[2:21:54] this last day.
[2:21:57] Hallelujah
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; church. So everywhere I preach,
[2:22:02] hallelujah, outside of my home is a
[2:22:05] fulfillment of prophecy. The only place
[2:22:07] I hadn't been is Antarctica and got no
[2:22:11] desire to go there.
[2:22:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; But church, it's something God is doing.
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; So you have to ask the question, if not
[2:22:24] me, oh my
[2:22:34] You know what this reminds me of? The
[2:22:37] ice cream parlor.
[2:22:39] [Applause]
[2:22:44] Let me move forward church. So you let
[2:22:47] me say this. Prophecy will find you
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; young people. But if God got something
[2:22:53] for you, can't nobody else do it but
[2:22:55] you.
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; So you need to be like Isaiah.
[2:23:00] Isaiah said, "Woe is me." God say, "Who
[2:23:03] shall I send?" Isaiah said, "Lord, here
[2:23:06] am I. Send me.
[2:23:11] I will go."
[2:23:13] Once Isaiah got touched by the fire,
[2:23:17] nothing could stop him from going. Amen.
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; Now, the question is, have you been
[2:23:22] touched by the fire?
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Come on.
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Church, listen.
[2:23:32] I want to use a Bible character real
[2:23:35] quick as I'm condescending. Hallelujah.
[2:23:39] Cuz I'm way up there right now. Way up
[2:23:41] there. H. And all of us, we way up there
[2:23:44] right now.
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; But let's meet in the middle.
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm talking about
[2:23:49] supernatural things taking place right
[2:23:51] now.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; But church, let's look at David for a
[2:23:55] second.
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; I love David's life.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; David made many mistakes.
[2:24:02] &gt;&gt; Some things premeditated.
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; But whenever David was confronted by
[2:24:07] God, he didn't make excuses.
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; Many of times David say, "Lord, I have
[2:24:14] sinned." Amen.
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; And because David was honest, God always
[2:24:20] gave him mercy.
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; So I say to you, if you got things in
[2:24:26] your life, don't try to hide it from
[2:24:28] God. He see you.
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; He know what you doing.
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; He see you. He know what you watching.
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; He know what you listening to. So when
[2:24:43] the word of God comes and step on your
[2:24:45] toes, don't try to act all super

[2:24:53] &gt;&gt; Lord, have mercy on me.
[2:24:56] &gt;&gt; That's what David said. David say, Lord,
[2:24:59] I have sinned. What was that?
[2:25:00] Hallelujah. That was an illustration of
[2:25:04] a man that had the heart of God.
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; Even though he made mistakes.
[2:25:10] Hallelujah. There was something in
[2:25:12] David's heart that always wanted to be
[2:25:15] right with God.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; Through all of his mistakes, and I'll
[2:25:22] say, hallelujah. If God did that for
[2:25:24] David, Hallelujah.
[2:25:26] Why not me?
[2:25:29] &gt;&gt; Why not now?
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; And if not me, then who?

[2:25:42] told Samuel, "Everybody all right?"
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; See, by now we should be feeling the
[2:25:47] charge.

[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; First, David. Hallelujah. The prophet
[2:26:20] comes down to this house because God
[2:26:22] told him the next king is down there

[2:26:38] First of all, everybody was afraid when
[2:26:41] a prophet came to town

[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; And you didn't play around with God's
[2:26:49] prophet.

[2:26:52] on today.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But church, hallelujah.
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; Samuel tells Jesse, "Hey, God told me to
[2:27:00] come here
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; and I got an anointing oil."
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. because he says the next

[2:27:43] get refreshed." So, you know, the oldest
[2:27:46] brother come out. Hallelujah. And he

[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; Next brother comes.
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; You got rejected, huh? Okay, my turn.
[2:28:26] He ain't learned a lesson from his
[2:28:28] brother.

[2:28:30] attitude. Yes.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:29:58] ain't you."

[2:30:03] house.

[2:30:49] try it.
[2:30:54] [Applause]
[2:31:02] [Music]
[2:31:07] &gt;&gt; Talking about some boots on the ground.
[2:31:13] So he feeling he feeling he feeling like
[2:31:15] a king. He like, "Oh my, here it is.
[2:31:20] I've been waiting on it." And then he
[2:31:22] looked back at his brothers and they
[2:31:23] like, "Can't be can't be you. Can't be
[2:31:27] you.
[2:31:34] Nothing.
[2:31:36] Go on ahead. Go on back." And Samuel
[2:31:39] says,
[2:31:40] "Come on, Jesse. God don't make
[2:31:43] mistakes.
[2:31:44] [Applause]
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; God don't make mistakes.
[2:31:56] God don't make mistakes." Hallelujah.
[2:31:59] &gt;&gt; If God brought the messenger to your
[2:32:01] house, it's because your message
[2:32:03] material.
[2:32:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:07] If God brought the anointing to your
[2:32:09] church, it's because you can bathe in
[2:32:11] his presence.
[2:32:13] &gt;&gt; God don't make mistakes.
[2:32:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; And for those of you who are in an
[2:32:19] identity crisis, God knew what he was
[2:32:21] doing when he put a woman in a woman's
[2:32:24] body.
[2:32:25] &gt;&gt; God knew what he was doing when he put a
[2:32:27] man in a man's body. The only one
[2:32:29] confused is you.
[2:32:37] had a young sister tell me one time,
[2:32:39] hallelujah, she said came in prayer
[2:32:41] line. She said, "Oh, D, the devil's
[2:32:43] telling me that I'm a lesbian.
[2:32:47] That's how it starts.
[2:32:49] Devil start talking to you."
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; And what he starts to do is pervert
[2:32:53] natural feelings.
[2:32:56] And what he what he did to her, he said
[2:32:58] to her, he said, "Look, he said, "Look,
[2:33:00] every time you get in a a court stage
[2:33:03] with a boy, he ends up leaving you and
[2:33:06] getting somebody else." See, you're
[2:33:08] supposed to be with a woman.
[2:33:12] &gt;&gt; She says, she says, she's telling me
[2:33:14] this. She said, "Enemy tell her say
[2:33:16] every relationship never worked out, but
[2:33:19] every time you get depressed or you go
[2:33:22] through a relationship and you're all
[2:33:24] alone, your girlfriends are always there
[2:33:28] and they're there to love on you." See,
[2:33:31] you're supposed to be with a woman.
[2:33:34] I say, "Sis,
[2:33:37] [Music]
[2:33:39] &gt;&gt; come on now.
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; I was gentle."
[2:33:44] I said, "Sis, the devil is lying to
[2:33:46] you."
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; I say, "That's what good friends are
[2:33:49] supposed to do."
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; They're supposed to help you come out of
[2:33:53] your depression.
[2:33:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:33:55] &gt;&gt; They're supposed to be there when
[2:33:57] anxiety is ranting and raging. You're
[2:34:00] not supposed to fall in love with them.
[2:34:02] &gt;&gt; They're supposed to be there and be a
[2:34:04] help for you. But let the bigger
[2:34:06] question is, let me ask you something.
[2:34:08] Do you want to be married to a man? She
[2:34:10] says, "Yes." I said, "Well, dig on your
[2:34:12] answer."
[2:34:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I said, "Digle your answer.
[2:34:16] Satan is lying to you." Amen. Amen.
[2:34:20] Sisters. Amen. Let me tell you
[2:34:21] something. Hallelujah. God, he will
[2:34:24] never be mocked. Amen. He knew right
[2:34:26] where you wondering if you a woman, am I
[2:34:28] really a woman in this body? Go in the
[2:34:31] mirror and look at yourself and answer
[2:34:32] that own question.
[2:34:36] &gt;&gt; There's certain things about you that
[2:34:37] only a woman got. A man ain't got it.
[2:34:41] if you know what I mean.
[2:34:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:46] &gt;&gt; God made you that way. Put you in a
[2:34:48] woman. Uh-oh. Somebody needed that.
[2:34:51] [Music]
[2:34:53] [Applause]
[2:34:57] &gt;&gt; Ain't no lesbians in the kingdom of God.
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; Ain't no homosexuals in the kingdom of
[2:35:04] God.
[2:35:06] [Music]
[2:35:08] Amen. But sons and daughters,
[2:35:13] &gt;&gt; brothers and sisters,
[2:35:15] &gt;&gt; Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.
[2:35:24] &gt;&gt; And normally when I talk to people who
[2:35:27] are making that decision, first thing
[2:35:29] they try to do is you you try to God is
[2:35:32] love. Yeah, he love. I said, but let me
[2:35:35] ask you something. Is God all knowing?
[2:35:39] &gt;&gt; Is God perfect?
[2:35:41] &gt;&gt; And if they say yes, it's over.
[2:35:46] &gt;&gt; Because I say, how can a perfect God put
[2:35:49] the wrong person in the wrong body?
[2:35:52] &gt;&gt; That mean he's not perfect.
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; How can God be perfect? Hallelujah. And
[2:35:59] make a mistake to put a woman in a man's
[2:36:02] body.
[2:36:05] If that's the case, hallelujah, a a a
[2:36:08] elephant is a lion.
[2:36:11] [Applause]
[2:36:14] And this stuff is getting so ridiculous.
[2:36:16] Hallelujah. In the States, somebody got
[2:36:18] pulled over and the police are trying to
[2:36:20] talk to him and the woman say, "I'm a
[2:36:23] cat.
[2:36:39] [Applause]
[2:36:45] You see the enemy always go too far.
[2:36:50] [Applause]
[2:36:52] Oh my. Let me get back what I was
[2:36:55] talking about, honey.

[2:37:10] this. I wanted to read it but go back
[2:37:12] and read. Hallelujah. 1st Samuel 17.

[2:37:18] brothers they didn't got rejected.
[2:37:22] &gt;&gt; Jesse says hey do you got one more? You
[2:37:25] say God said the son come out of your
[2:37:27] house. You got another son?
[2:37:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; Man,
[2:37:50] you want me to go get him? Amen.
[2:37:54] &gt;&gt; Samuel said, "Man, God said
[2:37:57] &gt;&gt; the next king in your house,
[2:37:59] &gt;&gt; and I ain't leaving till you go get him.
[2:38:03] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about what people say.
[2:38:06] &gt;&gt; If God called you,
[2:38:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:38:09] &gt;&gt; He got something for you to do."
[2:38:15] &gt;&gt; If not me, then who? Amen.
[2:38:19] &gt;&gt; But look, church, David ain't had time
[2:38:22] to go get refreshed like everybody else.
[2:38:25] &gt;&gt; David came fresh from his ministry.
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; Stinking, smelling like sheep.
[2:38:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ain't had a chance to wash
[2:38:34] his clothes, take a bath, none of that.
[2:38:36] David came straight out of the field
[2:38:38] stepping under the anointing.
[2:38:41] Soon as David got there,
[2:38:46] &gt;&gt; the face started to move.
[2:38:51] Soon as David got there, the atmosphere
[2:38:54] started to change.
[2:38:57] Samuel say, "We got one. We got one. We
[2:39:02] got one.
[2:39:04] We got one.
[2:39:06] We found him.
[2:39:08] We felt God's anointed
[2:39:13] &gt;&gt; and David just standing there.
[2:39:17] &gt;&gt; David got anointed. Went on back to the
[2:39:20] wilderness.
[2:39:22] &gt;&gt; He ain't bragged. He ain't talk junk to
[2:39:25] nobody. He went on back to the
[2:39:27] wilderness.
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; And when he went back, hallelujah, maybe
[2:39:30] a couple days later, hallelujah, a bear
[2:39:33] came in. And the bar ain't realized,
[2:39:36] hallelujah, that there was a different
[2:39:38] anointing on the shepherd now.
[2:39:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[2:39:48] different anointing.
[2:39:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[2:40:18] somebody to take back what God put in
[2:40:20] your possession.
[2:40:22] &gt;&gt; Take back what God put in your
[2:40:24] possession. Church, David, take it back.

[2:40:42] came. Bear stood up on David.

[2:41:12] testimonies.

[2:41:49] to go take your brother some Chipotle."

[2:41:57] brother some Nando.

[2:42:45] don't know what it is.
[2:42:49] &gt;&gt; The king himself came down and became a
[2:42:52] servant to you and I.
[2:42:56] &gt;&gt; Now, let me ask you something. Are you

[2:44:23] &gt;&gt; If not me, then who? Come on. Come on.
[2:44:26] &gt;&gt; Abraham created a ram. Hallelujah.
[2:44:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So church, I went to God. I
[2:44:32] said, "Lord, I'm ready to move. I'm
[2:44:33] tired of paying rent. I want me another
[2:44:35] house." Hallelujah. But I said, "Lord, h
[2:44:38] I don't want just any house."
[2:44:40] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[2:44:43] [Applause]
[2:44:48] &gt;&gt; I don't want just any house.
[2:44:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I ain't going to describe it
[2:44:52] to you cuz you might try to copy.
[2:44:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:44:56] Hallelujah.
[2:44:57] &gt;&gt; And then God be saying, "Well, I got to
[2:44:58] bless him before I bless you." And but I
[2:45:02] say, "Lord, I don't want just any house,
[2:45:04] but I want a house." Hallelujah. That I
[2:45:08] don't owe nobody nothing on.
[2:45:17] &gt;&gt; That ain't my God. My God is a big God.
[2:45:22] &gt;&gt; He's a big God.
[2:45:24] And if he don't do it, if if he can't do
[2:45:26] it for me, then who?
[2:45:30] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen.
[2:45:32] &gt;&gt; I ain't looking to have no monthly
[2:45:34] payment, no nothing. H
[2:45:36] &gt;&gt; living in the blessings of God. Holy.
[2:45:38] &gt;&gt; And see, right now, that's challenging
[2:45:40] some of y'all faith.
[2:45:42] &gt;&gt; You sit back thinking, man, I don't need
[2:45:46] I don't need nothing like that. Well, I
[2:45:48] got something for you. Who told you
[2:45:50] that?
[2:45:53] [Applause]
[2:46:02] Who told you God couldn't do it?
[2:46:06] Who told you God couldn't bless you?
[2:46:09] &gt;&gt; Who told you you couldn't be debtree?
[2:46:13] &gt;&gt; Who told you that?
[2:46:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then he gave me
[2:46:19] scripture to back it up. Hallelujah. I
[2:46:22] was reading in I think it was
[2:46:23] Deuteronomy or Exodus somewhere in
[2:46:25] there. And the scripture said God said
[2:46:27] to them, he said, "Hey, hallelujah. You
[2:46:29] going to live in houses that you didn't
[2:46:31] build."
[2:46:34] Hallelujah.
[2:46:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You going to
[2:46:38] have vineyards you didn't plant.
[2:46:46] &gt;&gt; So you believe what you want to believe.
[2:46:48] I believe in the word.
[2:46:55] Oh my.
[2:46:57] Let me wind this down. Hallelujah. David
[2:47:02] now he comes with the food. He comes
[2:47:04] with the food and his brothers are like
[2:47:08] he come. The Bible says he start talking
[2:47:10] to his brothers and then he hear
[2:47:12] something.
[2:47:14] Bring me a man.
[2:47:18] No, it wasn't like that. The devil don't
[2:47:20] come peaceful.
[2:47:22] He know you've been looking at the wrong
[2:47:23] thing. He know you doing something
[2:47:26] wrong. So he loud as can be.
[2:47:29] &gt;&gt; Bring me a man.
[2:47:35] &gt;&gt; He been screaming at some of you while
[2:47:37] you've been here in service. You better
[2:47:39] not shout, "You know what you did
[2:47:40] yesterday."
[2:47:42] &gt;&gt; You better not shout, "You know you got
[2:47:44] a boyfriend.
[2:47:50] Please don't turn the blood hound loose.
[2:47:54] But then church, hallelujah. David
[2:47:57] talking to his brother here, Goliath. He
[2:47:59] said, "Hey, hey, who that is?
[2:48:02] Who that is? What y'all heard about? Who
[2:48:03] that is?" And Elab says, "David,
[2:48:08] I know your pride.
[2:48:10] &gt;&gt; I know you come down here to see the
[2:48:12] battle."
[2:48:13] &gt;&gt; Now, let's understand something,
[2:48:15] Pastor Simon.
[2:48:17] First of all, Elaz was speaking out of
[2:48:20] turn
[2:48:22] &gt;&gt; because unto that moment,
[2:48:24] &gt;&gt; there was no battle.
[2:48:30] &gt;&gt; There was no battle.
[2:48:32] &gt;&gt; Everybody was afraid.
[2:48:35] &gt;&gt; Was nobody fighting.
[2:48:37] &gt;&gt; So he's telling Dave like he David like
[2:48:39] he a big shot. You come down here to see
[2:48:41] the battle. David should say, "Man,
[2:48:43] you're a chicken.
[2:48:46] Ain't none of y'all fighting. Everybody
[2:48:48] standing on the sideline while this
[2:48:51] uncircumcised Philistine coming in a
[2:48:54] message church.
[2:48:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:49:01] Coming in the church of the Lord Jesus
[2:49:03] Christ.
[2:49:04] &gt;&gt; And y'all won't cast him out.
[2:49:08] &gt;&gt; And you better set up.
[2:49:10] &gt;&gt; He said you can David say, "Is there not
[2:49:12] a cause?
[2:49:14] &gt;&gt; Is there not a cause? Yeah.
[2:49:16] &gt;&gt; Basically, David was saying, "If not me,
[2:49:20] &gt;&gt; then who?"
[2:49:22] &gt;&gt; Y'all ain't going to fight him.
[2:49:24] &gt;&gt; If I don't fight him, who going to fight
[2:49:25] him?
[2:49:26] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:49:27] &gt;&gt; So, David started to ask questions.
[2:49:29] David said, "What's the reward?" See?
[2:49:31] Hallelujah. David was built different.
[2:49:33] Hallelujah,
[2:49:34] &gt;&gt; church. He started asking questions and
[2:49:36] he didn't stop until he got in front of
[2:49:38] Goliath.
[2:49:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. David told everybody
[2:49:45] if not me.
[2:49:48] &gt;&gt; Go back and read it. He went to Saul and
[2:49:50] he said, "Hey, don't let nobody be
[2:49:52] afraid.
[2:49:53] &gt;&gt; I'm here."
[2:50:00] &gt;&gt; When your friends are going through, you
[2:50:01] need to tell them, "Come over my house.
[2:50:02] Let's pray."
[2:50:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:50:06] &gt;&gt; Let's fast and pray. Let's get together.
[2:50:08] Hallelujah.
[2:50:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's get together and burn
[2:50:11] this devil up. Hallelujah.
[2:50:14] &gt;&gt; Church,
[2:50:15] &gt;&gt; David. Hallelujah. David went to Psalm
[2:50:17] said, "Look, let me tell you something."
[2:50:20] He said, "A bear came." Hallelujah. Now,
[2:50:23] David begins to tell his testimony.
[2:50:28] &gt;&gt; This is the reason why you went through
[2:50:30] all that stuff. Hallelujah.
[2:50:32] &gt;&gt; Because there was a greater battle. But
[2:50:34] this battle, hallelujah, was not only
[2:50:36] going to put you in a certain place, but
[2:50:38] it was going to deliver everybody else.
[2:50:42] [Applause]
[2:50:44] &gt;&gt; If not you,
[2:50:46] &gt;&gt; then who?
[2:50:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:47] &gt;&gt; Look, church, now David says, "Hey,
[2:50:51] David says, "Hey, I fight him. Don't let
[2:50:54] nobody don't let nobody's heart melt.
[2:50:56] Don't let nobody be afraid. I fight
[2:50:57] them." And here come one of the elders,
[2:51:00] Saul.
[2:51:03] you know, they think we're too radical.
[2:51:06] We don't act like that in Canada.
[2:51:10] &gt;&gt; He says, "Hey, we don't sing them kind
[2:51:12] of songs in church."
[2:51:17] At the cross, at the cross where I first
[2:51:23] &gt;&gt; I love them songs, too.
[2:51:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:51:28] &gt;&gt; But when God start moving, I want to
[2:51:30] move with him.
[2:51:32] Amen. Amen.
[2:51:34] &gt;&gt; I ain't afraid to go back where I come
[2:51:36] from.
[2:51:37] &gt;&gt; But when Look, church.
[2:51:40] Oh my. Let me leave that alone cuz some
[2:51:43] of y'all looking to start a ruckus in
[2:51:44] church.
[2:51:47] Brother Dig said, "Ah, don't use my
[2:51:49] name. Don't put me in. Do what your
[2:51:51] pastor say.
[2:51:54] As for me, I'm free."
[2:51:57] Look church, David talking to Saul. Saul
[2:52:00] start to lift up the enemy.
[2:52:03] &gt;&gt; David, you just a youth.
[2:52:05] &gt;&gt; He been a warrior since he since he been
[2:52:07] a youth. David said, "Man, I don't want
[2:52:09] to hear all that." Look here. A lion
[2:52:12] came, I dealt with him.
[2:52:14] &gt;&gt; A bear came, I dealt with him.
[2:52:16] &gt;&gt; And this uncircumcised Philistine gonna
[2:52:19] be just like that lion and just like
[2:52:21] that bear.
[2:52:24] &gt;&gt; Saul's like, "All right." Okay, if that
[2:52:27] what you want to do, all right, let me
[2:52:28] dress you up. He put it all on him. He
[2:52:31] put the anointing on from yesterday
[2:52:33] year.
[2:52:38] [Music]
[2:52:39] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you what God did in the
[2:52:40] prophet. You know, he was out there
[2:52:42] hunting and he shot this and he shot
[2:52:45] that. Testimonies are yester year.
[2:52:48] [Music]
[2:52:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah, they good. But what is he doing in
[2:52:52] your life?
[2:52:54] Hallelujah.
[2:52:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:52:58] &gt;&gt; My testimony of this message is what God
[2:53:00] did in me.
[2:53:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:53:04] &gt;&gt; He's a person, a living person.
[2:53:09] &gt;&gt; He didn't die in 65. He ain't in the
[2:53:12] rocks in Arizona. He ain't in a grave in
[2:53:15] Jeffersonville. But he's living in a
[2:53:17] body of believers.
[2:53:24] church. Give me about Give me about 10
[2:53:27] more minutes out here.

[2:53:42] &gt;&gt; So he start to lift up the enemy and say
[2:53:44] all this stuff about David and fighting
[2:53:46] this. David said, "Man, let me tell you
[2:53:47] my testimony." David tell him testimony.
[2:53:49] He want to dress David up with his old
[2:53:51] experience. David said, "No, man. I'm
[2:53:53] good. I got my own.
[2:53:56] &gt;&gt; I got my own. I got my own. God been
[2:53:58] good to me.
[2:53:59] &gt;&gt; I got my own."
[2:54:01] &gt;&gt; Y'all think I'd be talking about a house
[2:54:03] with no payments. If God hadn't already
[2:54:06] moved like that before.
[2:54:10] &gt;&gt; So I stand back and say, "Lord, if not
[2:54:13] me, then who?
[2:54:14] &gt;&gt; If you going to bless somebody, if not
[2:54:17] me, then who?
[2:54:19] [Music]
[2:54:21] church.
[2:54:22] &gt;&gt; David said, "Man, I can't wear all that
[2:54:23] stuff. I got my own testimony."
[2:54:26] &gt;&gt; Then Goliath screamed out, "Bring me a
[2:54:29] B."
[2:54:30] [Applause]
[2:54:31] David walk out there.
[2:54:43] &gt;&gt; Y'all know David had real swagger.

[2:55:09] be. We should be enjoying the anointing.
[2:55:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't get don't lose sight of
[2:55:18] what's happening. This is an atmosphere
[2:55:21] where anything is possible.
[2:55:24] Hallelujah.
[2:55:25] &gt;&gt; I said anything.
[2:55:27] &gt;&gt; I said anything.
[2:55:30] I said anything. I said anything.
[2:55:34] I said anything. I said anything.

[2:55:45] Today, church, David walks out there. He
[2:55:50] bring me a man.
[2:55:52] &gt;&gt; David walks out there. I told y'all the
[2:55:53] other night, God got a sense of humor.
[2:55:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "Bring me a man." God sent a
[2:55:58] boy out there.
[2:56:04] &gt;&gt; What was he What did he do that? Because
[2:56:06] he knew he was going to expire a prophet
[2:56:08] for our day to send out a quote that say
[2:56:12] the weakest Christian on their knees.
[2:56:15] Amen.
[2:56:16] &gt;&gt; Can defeat the devil
[2:56:18] &gt;&gt; anytime.
[2:56:20] &gt;&gt; Any place,
[2:56:22] &gt;&gt; anywhere,
[2:56:24] &gt;&gt; if not me,
[2:56:26] &gt;&gt; then who?
[2:56:31] &gt;&gt; David comes out there. Goliath say, "You
[2:56:35] send me a boy?"
[2:56:37] He said, "I'mma put him on the edge of
[2:56:38] my spear and feed him to the birds."
[2:56:41] And David said, "I'mma cut your head
[2:56:44] off."
[2:56:46] [Applause]
[2:56:50] &gt;&gt; Goliath got all this armor on, all this
[2:56:52] stuff. Let me tell you something. The
[2:56:55] devil presents himself like he's
[2:56:56] untouchable,
[2:56:58] &gt;&gt; but he is.
[2:57:00] &gt;&gt; And and in some of y'all lives, he need
[2:57:02] to be touched this morning.
[2:57:05] &gt;&gt; He needs to be touched.
[2:57:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:57:09] &gt;&gt; But you throw it. Let God guide it.
[2:57:10] Hallelujah. So, hallelujah. When it came
[2:57:14] time, now David said the mystery behind
[2:57:16] all that is David was operating under
[2:57:18] the spoken word.
[2:57:20] &gt;&gt; David said, "I'm going to cut your head
[2:57:21] off." And you know what? David didn't
[2:57:23] have a sword.
[2:57:26] [Music]
[2:57:28] &gt;&gt; If not me, then who?
[2:57:33] &gt;&gt; Everybody else was afraid, but David was
[2:57:36] prophesying the battle.
[2:57:40] You need to speak over yourself.
[2:57:42] &gt;&gt; Speak over your life.
[2:57:45] &gt;&gt; Tell the devil what you want him to do.
[2:57:58] Guillotine didn't have nothing but a bag
[2:58:00] with some rocks in it.
[2:58:04] &gt;&gt; Goliath got all this stuff and he stood
[2:58:06] out there. The Bible say David ran to
[2:58:09] him.
[2:58:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:58:12] &gt;&gt; Y'all y'all adults remember we used to
[2:58:14] watch the Bondic man.
[2:58:20] [Music]
[2:58:24] David runs out there. He winds it up.
[2:58:28] And he says in the name of
[2:58:31] &gt;&gt; it's over.
[2:58:32] &gt;&gt; He throws it and then he sayowmen.
[2:58:42] &gt;&gt; The B the Bible say he fell
[2:58:45] &gt;&gt; face
[2:58:46] forward.
[2:58:52] &gt;&gt; All everybody else in the army watching.
[2:58:57] Everybody else watching.
[2:58:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:59:00] &gt;&gt; Goliath goes down.
[2:59:02] &gt;&gt; They still afraid cuz they don't know if
[2:59:04] he going to get up.
[2:59:06] &gt;&gt; The Bible, this is the part I love.
[2:59:10] And if y'all don't mind, Hallelujah. If
[2:59:13] you got a spirit bothering you, I want
[2:59:15] you to do what David did.
[2:59:17] &gt;&gt; The Bible say David ran on Goliath and
[2:59:20] stood on top of him.
[2:59:22] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[2:59:23] &gt;&gt; Somebody need to stand on top of their
[2:59:25] devil this morning.
[2:59:28] [Applause]
[2:59:32] Stand on top of your enemy.
[2:59:37] I said stand on top of your devil.
[2:59:43] Stand on top of your prophet.
[2:59:46] Stand on top of you.
[2:59:48] &gt;&gt; If not me, then who?
[2:59:55] &gt;&gt; Stand up.
[2:59:57] &gt;&gt; I said stand up.
[3:00:05] David stood on top of him. David took
[3:00:08] the enemy own sword
[3:00:11] &gt;&gt; cuz he said he was going to cut his head
[3:00:13] off.
[3:00:14] David took what the devil been doing to
[3:00:15] bother everybody else. Took it out and
[3:00:18] cut his head off.
[3:00:21] &gt;&gt; You need to cut your Goliath head off
[3:00:23] again.
[3:00:29] If not me, then who?
[3:00:32] [Applause]
[3:00:37] And once David cut his head off,
[3:00:40] everybody that was afraid, they got
[3:00:43] courage. Hallelujah. And because of
[3:00:46] David, everybody else drew faith and
[3:00:48] they
[3:00:51] [Applause]
[3:00:54] because of you.
[3:00:56] &gt;&gt; I said because of you.
[3:00:59] I said because of you,
[3:01:01] &gt;&gt; your church is going to be better.
[3:01:04] &gt;&gt; Because of you,
[3:01:05] &gt;&gt; the worship is going to be better.
[3:01:08] &gt;&gt; Because of you, demons are going to be
[3:01:11] cast out.
[3:01:13] &gt;&gt; If not me, then who? If not me, then
[3:01:17] who? If not me, then who?
[3:01:25] [Applause]
[3:01:29] [Music]
[3:01:30] David cut his head off
[3:01:35] when everybody rushed the fight.
[3:01:37] &gt;&gt; David took the head of Goliath and put
[3:01:39] it in a bag.
[3:01:42] Hallelujah. And I can imagine Pastor
[3:01:43] Nelson, Amen. You know the devil don't
[3:01:45] like to give up. He don't like to be
[3:01:47] defeated. So David, Hallelujah, went to
[3:01:50] the next battle. Hallelujah. When you
[3:01:52] get the Holy Ghost, that's when you
[3:01:54] really begin to fight.

[3:01:57] &gt;&gt; And what you need to do is, hallelujah,
[3:01:58] like David, David, hallelujah, went to
[3:02:00] the next battle. Amen. He looked at the
[3:02:03] the Philistines. Hallelujah. He said,
[3:02:06] now he got sarcastic like Goliath. He
[3:02:08] said, "Hey, ain't no need for y'all to
[3:02:10] die."
[3:02:12] &gt;&gt; He said, "But if y'all want to fight,
[3:02:15] let me show you something.
[3:02:22] I want everybody to hold their hand up.
[3:02:25] &gt;&gt; I want you to hold your Goliath up. Hold
[3:02:28] your testimony up.
[3:02:30] &gt;&gt; Hold your testimony up.
[3:02:32] &gt;&gt; I want you to hold your testimony high.
[3:02:35] Hold your victory high.
[3:02:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[3:02:43] who?
[3:02:50] [Music]
[3:02:57] When they saw the head of their
[3:02:59] champion, everybody started to run.
[3:03:04] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said,
[3:03:06] "Hallelujah." He said, "Hey, remember
[3:03:08] the maniac? The maniac that fell before
[3:03:10] his feet." Hallelujah. The prophet of
[3:03:12] God said in that moment, the devil
[3:03:16] challenged God. He said, "And when you
[3:03:18] see the chief enemy, the chief spirit go
[3:03:22] down," he said, "then everybody can have
[3:03:26] what they ask God for."
[3:03:29] [Applause]
[3:03:33] &gt;&gt; If not me,
[3:03:34] &gt;&gt; then who?
[3:03:37] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you a testimony. I'm going
[3:03:38] close, church.
[3:03:43] I was in another part of Canada doing a
[3:03:45] youth meeting like this couple years
[3:03:48] back and the Holy Spirit was moving.
[3:03:51] Hallelujah. And it was such a powerful
[3:03:54] atmosphere like it is right now.
[3:03:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To at the end of that
[3:03:59] service, one sister jumped up and just
[3:04:02] started worshiping and it went through
[3:04:04] the church like a whirlwind.
[3:04:07] young people. And we sat in there and
[3:04:10] worshiped, called out on God, spoke in
[3:04:13] tongues, prophet, I mean, everything was
[3:04:16] moving. Hallelujah. For about an hour
[3:04:18] and a half.
[3:04:20] Hallelujah. That same spirit is here.
[3:04:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:04:24] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to manufacture anything.
[3:04:26] &gt;&gt; I'm just telling you what the natural
[3:04:28] eye can't see.
[3:04:31] &gt;&gt; Angels are in this room.
[3:04:33] &gt;&gt; And if angels are here, God is here.
[3:04:36] church. Hallelujah. So, uh, it was a
[3:04:40] young man, hallelujah, streaming the
[3:04:43] services in China.
[3:04:47] In China, he was watching the service.
[3:04:50] He wanted to be there so bad, but he was
[3:04:53] watching it. Church, after that meeting,
[3:04:56] he got inspired. He went on the street
[3:04:59] corner and started preaching.
[3:05:03] &gt;&gt; What you going to do when you leave the
[3:05:04] meeting?
[3:05:06] But then he went on the street corner
[3:05:07] and started preaching. Hallelujah. He
[3:05:09] said, "And as he started preaching, 20
[3:05:12] people came." He kept going. At that
[3:05:15] time, it was illegal to preach on the
[3:05:17] street.
[3:05:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Or have a religious
[3:05:22] gathering. Hallelujah. With more than
[3:05:24] certain amount of people. Hallelujah.
[3:05:27] But he kept preaching. He couldn't stop.
[3:05:29] 20 turn into 30. 30 turn into 50. 50
[3:05:33] turn into 60.
[3:05:35] 60 turned into 100.
[3:05:38] He said he couldn't stop. He kept
[3:05:40] preaching. Hallelujah. And he wasn't
[3:05:42] even in the service.
[3:05:48] &gt;&gt; He kept going. He said by the time he
[3:05:51] looked up, it probably was about 150
[3:05:53] people on the street corner listening to
[3:05:56] the word of God worshiping. Hallelujah.
[3:05:59] And at that time, hallelujah, he was
[3:06:02] thinking, I need to stop before the
[3:06:04] police come. But he couldn't stop. What
[3:06:06] was happening? If not you,
[3:06:09] &gt;&gt; then who?
[3:06:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[3:06:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So church, God was using
[3:06:13] him. And he kept preaching. All those
[3:06:16] people out there that was worshiping and
[3:06:18] and just having such a experience with
[3:06:20] God because a young man was inspired by
[3:06:24] a youth service he saw online.
[3:06:29] church. And by that time, the police
[3:06:31] came
[3:06:33] in two cars. He said at that time he was
[3:06:36] preaching about the baptism.
[3:06:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:06:40] &gt;&gt; Water baptism. Hallelujah. And he was
[3:06:43] preaching about hallelujah repentance
[3:06:46] and giving your life. As the police were
[3:06:48] coming up, they were hearing him talking
[3:06:50] about giving your life. He was looking
[3:06:52] at him come, but he couldn't stop.
[3:06:56] Hallelujah. God was taking over.
[3:06:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:07:01] &gt;&gt; God was taking over.
[3:07:04] &gt;&gt; If God call you, he will make sure
[3:07:07] you're fully equipped,
[3:07:10] &gt;&gt; church. And he kept going. Hallelujah.
[3:07:13] And then the police comes up in the
[3:07:15] moment where he's talking about
[3:07:16] Hallelujah. being baptized. And he said,
[3:07:20] he said, "Who want to be baptized?"
[3:07:24] Six people raised their hand,
[3:07:28] but it was also a seventh person.
[3:07:31] And the seventh person
[3:07:34] was a female police officer.
[3:07:45] the police officer who came there to
[3:07:47] arrest him, she got saved
[3:07:51] &gt;&gt; and they said, "Hey, we need to go
[3:07:54] someplace, get to the water, get
[3:07:55] baptized, but how we going to get
[3:07:57] there?" Both police officers with their
[3:08:00] cars, they say, "Hey, everybody get in
[3:08:02] our cars.
[3:08:04] [Applause]
[3:08:11] If not you, then who?
[3:08:14] &gt;&gt; If not me, then who?
[3:08:19] &gt;&gt; Church, between the two police cars,
[3:08:22] they put all seven people in those cars,
[3:08:24] went down to the lake and got baptized.
[3:08:31] In my closing, I was in Florida
[3:08:36] preaching in a service. Hallelujah. They
[3:08:39] were going to have a homegoing service
[3:08:41] for one of the saints after that
[3:08:43] service. And this particular person who
[3:08:45] was going on to their reward, his family
[3:08:48] was in church and they wasn't believers.
[3:08:51] Hallelujah. But they came to church that
[3:08:54] morning. Remember I said to you, you
[3:08:57] being here today is not a coincidence.
[3:09:00] &gt;&gt; And you might think, man, this is a long
[3:09:02] service. Not according to God,
[3:09:05] [Music]
[3:09:08] &gt;&gt; church. Hallelujah. So, I was preaching.
[3:09:11] I saw a young sister. Hallelujah.
[3:09:14] Although she wasn't a sister at that
[3:09:16] time, she was sitting on the front row
[3:09:19] and she couldn't take her eyes off me.
[3:09:22] She follow me left and right. left and
[3:09:24] right. She had a nose piercing,
[3:09:27] &gt;&gt; a eye piercing, her ears piercing, and
[3:09:30] probably any other kind of piercing you
[3:09:32] can name.
[3:09:34] Hallelujah. She had tattoos on her neck,
[3:09:37] tattoos on her arms and everything. But
[3:09:41] in that moment, she was following the
[3:09:43] word.
[3:09:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:09:47] &gt;&gt; So, you know what I did? I started
[3:09:49] preaching to her. Amen.
[3:09:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:09:51] &gt;&gt; I forgot about everybody else.
[3:09:53] &gt;&gt; I say, "Hey, it's just me and you."
[3:09:55] Hallelujah. You know that you are a
[3:09:57] child of God. You know that you're here
[3:09:59] for a purpose. That God wants you,
[3:10:02] hallelujah, to fall into your position.
[3:10:05] And the more I preach, the more she
[3:10:07] opened up. Hallelujah.
[3:10:08] &gt;&gt; The more I preach, she realized that she
[3:10:12] was that woman at the well.
[3:10:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:10:20] church. She came in the prayer line and
[3:10:23] she said, "You know what? I want to give
[3:10:25] my life to the Lord."
[3:10:26] &gt;&gt; I want to get baptized. Hallelujah.
[3:10:29] That's why yesterday I said, "There's a
[3:10:31] baptism coming."
[3:10:32] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[3:10:33] &gt;&gt; And it's more than one person.
[3:10:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Church, we went outside. The
[3:10:38] pastor got in the water. Hallelujah.
[3:10:40] They had their pool outside. The sister
[3:10:42] said, "Hey," she had on pants.
[3:10:44] Hallelujah. Earrings. The whole nine
[3:10:46] yards. She say, "You know what? I ain't
[3:10:48] waiting on a a a change of clothes. I'm
[3:10:51] ready to get in the water right now."
[3:10:58] &gt;&gt; If not you,
[3:11:00] &gt;&gt; then who church? Hallelujah. She took
[3:11:03] her sandals off, walked right down in
[3:11:05] that water. Hallelujah. Tattoos,
[3:11:07] pierces, everything. Hallelujah. Got
[3:11:10] baptized, came back out raising her
[3:11:12] hands, giving God praise. Hallelujah.
[3:11:14] One of her family members saw that. They
[3:11:16] say, "I want to get baptized."
[3:11:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:11:21] The next one, Hallelujah.
[3:11:26] The next one say, "Hey, I don't need no
[3:11:28] clothes either." Went down straight in
[3:11:30] the water. Hallelujah. Came back out
[3:11:32] worshiping God. Another family member
[3:11:35] say, "Hey, I want to get baptized." And
[3:11:37] they went down in the water. Hallelujah.
[3:11:40] Hallelujah. And she came out raising her
[3:11:43] hands. Another one saw that. Hey, I want
[3:11:45] to get baptized.
[3:11:52] &gt;&gt; By the time God was finished,
[3:11:56] &gt;&gt; seven to nine people got baptized that
[3:11:58] day.
[3:11:59] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[3:12:02] &gt;&gt; Because one person was obedient.
[3:12:05] &gt;&gt; Come musicians.

[3:12:54] souls?
[3:12:57] &gt;&gt; Will you go back? How did David defeat
[3:12:59] Goliath? Not by his strength,

[3:30:39] come to realize.
[3:30:41] He's come to a place where he's had
[3:30:44] enough.
[3:30:46] &gt;&gt; He's had enough.
[3:30:48] He doesn't want this in and out anymore.
[3:30:52] &gt;&gt; God's been preserving him for this day,
[3:30:56] &gt;&gt; for this time in his life.
[3:30:58] Amen. Jesse, have you come here today
[3:31:02] because you you you've you've changed.
[3:31:04] Something's changed on the inside of
[3:31:06] you. You want to let go of everything.
[3:31:10] You want this world left behind.
[3:31:14] &gt;&gt; You renounce the enemy from this day
[3:31:16] forth.
[3:31:17] &gt;&gt; You give your life to the Lord Jesus
[3:31:20] Christ, one and only absolute true God
[3:31:24] to you. Do you renounce Satan and all of
[3:31:27] his control over your life, every
[3:31:30] demonic influence?
[3:31:33] Say it.
[3:31:35] &gt;&gt; I'm free. I'm free.
[3:31:38] &gt;&gt; I will no longer
[3:31:42] &gt;&gt; bow to the enemy.
[3:31:43] [Applause]
[3:31:47] &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Father,
[3:31:50] &gt;&gt; your anointing, your spirit is here,
[3:31:52] Lord. There's no doubt.
[3:31:55] And Lord, Jesse has confessed it with
[3:31:57] his own lips. Lord, he wants you and
[3:32:01] only you, Lord. He wants to make you his
[3:32:04] absolute.
[3:32:06] And Satan, you've heard also. And we
[3:32:10] come against you, joining our faith in
[3:32:14] this house.
[3:32:16] In the name of Jesus Christ, we bind
[3:32:19] every demonic influence and power that
[3:32:22] had any influence on this son of God.
[3:32:25] &gt;&gt; And in the name of Jesus Christ, your
[3:32:28] power, your chains, they're now broken.
[3:32:33] permanently. Satan,
[3:32:35] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ's name,
[3:32:39] &gt;&gt; Jesse, upon the confession of your
[3:32:42] faith,
[3:32:44] I baptize you in the name of the Lord
[3:32:48] Jesus Christ.
[3:32:54] [Applause]
[3:33:03] Fill them with your
[3:33:05] [Applause]
[3:33:06] fillus.
[3:33:24] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[3:33:29] [Applause]
[3:33:35] Don't let anything hold you back from
[3:33:36] getting baptized. Now is your time.
[3:34:02] [Applause]
[3:34:08] We have with us here Sarah Hope
[3:34:12] who has
[3:34:14] confessed that she wants to be baptized.
[3:34:19] Now, we know that something has to
[3:34:21] change on the inside
[3:34:24] and that baptism is an outward
[3:34:26] expression of something that has taken
[3:34:28] place on the inside.
[3:34:32] Sarah, is that the case?
[3:34:36] &gt;&gt; Something has changed.
[3:34:39] You want the Lord Jesus to replace every
[3:34:42] desire of this world
[3:34:45] 100%. She says,
[3:34:56] So you've come here today freely.
[3:35:00] The Lord spoke to your heart.
[3:35:03] Amen. Praise God.
[3:35:07] Let us pray. Our gracious father,
[3:35:12] Lord, you've heard the confession of our
[3:35:13] dear sister Sarah Hope. Oh God,
[3:35:17] she's come to realize, Lord, that you're
[3:35:20] a reality,
[3:35:22] that you're not somebody that mom and
[3:35:25] dad talks about or that she hears about
[3:35:28] in church. She's been around for many
[3:35:31] years, Lord. She was born in this
[3:35:34] church,
[3:35:37] but yet there's a time and there's a
[3:35:39] season for everything, Lord. and she's
[3:35:42] come to realize if not me then who?
[3:35:48] Lord,
[3:35:50] thank you for Sarah
[3:35:55] and Satan. You've heard her confession.
[3:35:58] Your power is broken. Your influence
[3:36:01] from this day shattered by the word of
[3:36:04] God that's been spoken.
[3:36:07] And in front of many witnesses,
[3:36:11] you are defeated in the name of Jesus
[3:36:15] Christ.
[3:36:20] Sarah hope according to your confession.
[3:36:26] I baptize you
[3:36:29] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[3:36:46] Father Jesus
[3:36:56] every
[3:37:02] spirit
[3:37:03] in the name of Jesus
[3:37:06] and only for your glory. May she be a
[3:37:08] wonderful testimony in a generation of
[3:37:11] young people.
[3:37:13] Oh God, in the name of Jesus Christ,
[3:37:16] give her victory after victory.
[3:37:18] &gt;&gt; Lord, let her walk with confidence to
[3:37:21] know that you are a reality in her life.
[3:37:24] Let her give the testimony of your
[3:37:26] spirit and your anointing in her life.
[3:37:29] Let her know you as her. Deliver her in
[3:37:33] the name of Jesus Christ for your glory
[3:37:37] and fill her with the spirit of
[3:37:38] revelation in Jesus name. Amen.

[3:44:50] &gt;&gt; We've had a wonderful weekend.
[3:44:53] I trust that everybody has been
[3:44:55] immensely blessed and they've taken
[3:44:58] advantage of his presence in the
[3:45:01] services
[3:45:03] and have allowed him to have absolute
[3:45:08] preeminence in whatever situation
[3:45:11] he would have brought. your
[3:45:15] condition and your situation, whatever
[3:45:17] it is that's blocking
[3:45:20] that
[3:45:22] perfect walk with God. Not perfect life.
[3:45:26] We're not looking for a perfect life.
[3:45:28] He's the only perfect life.
[3:45:31] But a walk where you can walk with God
[3:45:34] and and that power of condemnation that
[3:45:38] that tries to that demon of condemnation
[3:45:40] that constantly comes and whacks you
[3:45:42] down every time you start to feel good.
[3:45:46] You should be free of all of that. You
[3:45:47] should you should have come to a place
[3:45:50] through this weekend's teaching on the
[3:45:52] word and and and moments of deliverance
[3:45:55] and opportunity to just say, "Lord, I
[3:45:58] surrender." Amen. Praise God.
[3:46:02] I trust that you've drawn from this
[3:46:05] weekend
[3:46:07] immensely in the way that we have. I've
[3:46:09] been immensely blessed by the word of
[3:46:12] God. I thank God for a wonderful gift in
[3:46:16] our precious brother Kyrie.
[3:46:19] We are so blessed. Amen.
[3:46:23] May God continue to bless you, brother
[3:46:26] and prosper you and meet every desire of
[3:46:29] your heart. This bride is going to leave
[3:46:32] with great substance. And the revelation
[3:46:35] has to come upon her to receive it, to
[3:46:39] accept it, and to believe it.
[3:46:43] If not me, then who?
[3:46:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God.
[3:46:49] You noticed
[3:46:51] the Lord led me yesterday when he was
[3:46:53] preaching on that seed and he kept
[3:46:54] looking at that seed and the Holy Spirit
[3:46:57] was telling me, "Go and get two
[3:47:00] peaches." I said, "Should I get three?"
[3:47:03] He said, "Two peaches." I said, "I'll go
[3:47:05] get two peaches."
[3:47:08] And I brought him and I put him here and
[3:47:10] I said, "Brother,
[3:47:12] God's doing something. Maybe maybe
[3:47:15] there's going to be some fruit from this
[3:47:17] weekend.
[3:47:19] Praise God. We had two baptisms.
[3:47:24] [Applause]
[3:47:29] &gt;&gt; God's word will never ever return unto
[3:47:32] him void. Never. He'll honor his word
[3:47:37] above everything.
[3:47:39] And that's why when you receive the Holy
[3:47:41] Ghost, it's the word. It's actually the
[3:47:44] purpose and the nature of God coming
[3:47:46] into your life so that he can fulfill
[3:47:50] his purpose and then everything in your
[3:47:53] life. That's why you wonder why this
[3:47:55] time. Why now? Because it was your time.
[3:48:00] It was your time now to to manifest
[3:48:03] his word, his portion, his purpose in
[3:48:08] you. And everything that's not of him
[3:48:12] that's in your life, he just pushes it
[3:48:16] out. He says, "Now I'm in control. I
[3:48:21] take possession. I have spoken it. I
[3:48:24] will perform it. Say the Lord." Amen.
[3:48:26] Praise God. So, so, so we're under great
[3:48:29] expectation for our young people. I
[3:48:32] believe there was a lot of lives that
[3:48:33] were changed this weekend. It'll come.
[3:48:37] It'll manifest. God will vindicate
[3:48:39] because he's his own interpreter. Amen.
[3:48:42] Praise God. At this time, I'm bringing
[3:48:44] this service to a close. We are going to
[3:48:47] be having some refreshments outside.
[3:48:49] We're going to pray. We're going to ask
[3:48:51] the Lord to just bless and continue.
[3:48:53] Listen, this anointing is all over. It's
[3:48:56] people walking by must be feeling it.
[3:48:59] because it's it's all over. It's all
[3:49:02] over. Stay in it. Keep your fellowship.
[3:49:07] Keep your desire for God.
[3:49:10] Share with one another as you break
[3:49:13] bread together and rejoice in his
[3:49:17] wonderful presence. Let us pray. Our
[3:49:21] gracious heavenly father,
[3:49:25] Lord, what can we say?
