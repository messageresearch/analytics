by God's grace you have able to come out tonight and I want to thank the Lord and thank each and every one of you because we have to come out because the hour is late uh whether we like it or not the time is at hand we are in the last hour we all know we are in the last hour because God is speaking to his wife and he will not stop speaking until the last one comes in because when the last one comes in guess what we meet him in the air that's his hard desire that we should that should be our heart desire praise the Lord I won't keep you standing long God bless you take your Bible and go straight to Matthew chapter 28 verse sorry Matthew 24 chapter 20 vers Matthew 24 verse 28 and goes to revelation 22 16 to the end okay brother what's your name brother Emmanuel wonderful can you pray yes can you come and lead us in prayer before we we perceive okay I think is it okay let's pray precious Lord we thank you oh God for this moment father Lord we are grateful to be assembled once again in your house tonight Lord as your servant would stand behind the sacred desk Lord yes Lord father Lord God we've come that you might use this vessel of clay oh God and speak to our hearts Lord yes

down every barrier Lord Jesus yes Lord and anything Lord that would stand in the way Lord in the name of Jesus Amen we bring down every stronghold father Yes Lord Lord I just pray that you'd use him even as he consecrates his mouth Lord to thee yes Lord take a hold of every aspect of him Lord yes Lord and meet the needs Lord of your children tonight yes Lord in the mighty and precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen God bless you brother thank you all right everybody has opened the scripture Matthew 24 verse 28 it's just a common scripture that everyone know for wheresoever the carcus is there will the Eagles be GA together that's the first scripture and we turn to Revelation I said Revelation 22:16 you read to the sorry revelation 22 sorry revelation 22 verse 16 that's what I said we read to the end I Jesus have send my angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root and the of offspring of David and the bright and morning star and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that he say come and let him that is test come and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely for I testify unto every man that Hearth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto this things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of of This Book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book he which testify these things says surely I come quickly amen even so come Lord Jesus the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all amen may the Lord add his Blessing to what we have read please sit down even why we read this scripture what is the scripture saying to us straight I see God is the one that interpret his own word he's telling us that if you add it to his word your name will be taken out right and he also said where the Kaka is there the eagle will be gathered together because what is the carcass the carass is the flesh word of God and only him can give us the carcass no man can give it to you when I said no man I'm not saying a man can preach the word of God if he is ordained by God to preach then God will give him the flesh ccass then when he speak it won't be be a man speaking because it will be God taking the man heart as he has ordained him and speaking through him because otherwise man will speak his own mind and the days of man are over even the day of man trying to interpret God word with his own IDE are over but when God is hiding in a man and the man is speaking the man doesn't have his own ideas the ideas come from where God because God is his own interpreter when brother Abraham came we all saw it because God was in The Man by name 1963 the seals were open God has come down to be his own interpreter taking the prophet and speaking through the prophet after he done with him he says I must decrease he must increase right so God took over then the five4 ministry we have come to H to take over the word word the true 5-4 Ministry not everybody preaching is a five4 Ministry but those that God has ordained before the foundations of this world God will hide in them because it's not by education you can preach the word of God we all know it the denomination has done that and has failed man has tried with his own ability his own ideas all have has fail why because God is his own interpreter and even the 54 Ministry as a man God will say that it will come to a time we must decrease I was fellowshipping with brother uh brother Mike my own precious brother and he brought that and right away I says to him brother you are right because you know why because God says is H God says he's his own interpreter is not man that will interpret the word is he himself so the 54 Ministry we are coming to a time that we going to be decreased you may not like it but it's the truth we're going to be decreased but because if we don't decrease then it will be man but I am take it rightly I'm not saying man won't preach the gospel man will be preaching but the holy spirit is the one that interpret the word that's what I'm trying to say you understand M dayses of taking the word and studying and and putting things together here there there there a cracking their brains is over because God is his own interpreter God will take over the seed that he has ordained and when the man stand here God will come and speak the way he wanted to speak the man may not know what even he have to preach but as soon as he's standing in the pulpit the holy spirit will pick him up and say things that he wanted to say then the people will know their heart will bur within them that this is not a man speaking this is God speaking because when the prophet was here we all saw things that were manifested in him it was not William Braham that was doing the miracle it was not William Braham that opened the seals then it will be a man right it will be a man then the glory will go to who man but God has come down for a reason that he wanted to break his own way to his people that the people will know is not a man it's he himself the goes to God let me tell you I believe that I don't even when brother brother might speak I said brother let me tell you I know I says as soon as I don't I says when I was in school I was not good but when it comes to the word of God as soon as you speak something in me wake up and he catches it I don't know how I catches it but I know it's the truth nobody have to explain to me or nobody have to H I mean kick me you know the eagle eat the ccass because I am part of that carcass that have to made manifest for this day you are part of that carcass that have to made manifest what is the ccass the ccass is the flesh word of God and it's you that have to made manifest because you are part of God oh God you are so good I told him myself said brother you was God is so good he has opened our eyes to ex understand even we who are nothing the least in the kingdom of God now I understand the Bible says the least in the kingdom of God is greater than John the Baptist why because it is the Mondays are over people may not accept it but it's the truth M days of preaching the word of God with their own ideas their own ability is over but God has come down hiding in the wife his own seed bringing the word and you have to catch it like our old Pastor used to say Pastor John Simon he says when the word Abel was born and Cain was born where was the written way how did Abel know how to offer the lamb there was no book for him to co 30 or something something to write he offer it by what Revelation it was what the beginning we are what at the end so shall it be so all man knowledge have to come to an end so that they as able offer a better sacrifice unto God and God accepted it the wife of Christ at this hour we are going to offer what sacrifice unto the Lord not by you using the letter to the letter yes the letter is good that's why the Bible says what the letter kill it but the spirit gave life so the spirit will lead you to say things that if they don't have the seed of God they will never know what you are talking about it will be like to them is you are insane because you know what it's written but it's not written for your natural eye to see to go read it you understand it's not written for your natural eye to go read it and and speak it but you led by the spirit and when you speak it those that have the seed of God will will know this is God this is my father because when Jesus was here that's what you know the Pharisees were trying to use the same Bible to tid him up they're using the letter to tie Jesus up but forgetting that he was the word the things he was speaking Moses has spoke and said the Lord your God will raise a prophet like unto me whom soever will not hear him when he come will be cut off and here he was revealing the word but because it's not written physically the Pharisees couldn't cease it he says destroy this temple in three days I will raise it up he was speaking what exactly like us able offer a better sacrifice than King and those that were elect saw it and follow him but those that were not elect couldn't cease it brothers and sisters we know a prophet has come on the scene this 20th century he the Seas has open but our God is what marching on the holy spirit is what marching on because what when God move the devil move when God moved the devil move he tried to catch everything that God is making or God is speaking to his children so God what he has done is he has taken man away and he himself is here he's here and giving the word by what he spoken word is what the oral what seed so he's bringing his own spoken word and his own elect will catch it we will catch it by what by Faith by Revelation because it's flesh Cass is the flesh word of God because Eagles doesn't eat no dead meat when you kill it today and leave it for tomorrow eagle eat it he want the flesh ccass that blood is in then he will eat it that make the eagle strong and I want to tell you the true bride of all every day they want flesh ccass week by week not just C you're going to stick with the quot and quot and quot and quot and after the C quot sorry after the quote then what quote of the prophets are good to back your word but if there is no life coming out I tell you get away from that you need the life the flesh ccass coming out from the world because if you are sick you don't need to th000 years what Jesus heal and Jesus can't heal you today then what is he good to you you you see what I'm saying what is he good to you you need Jesus Christ that will heal you today Jesus Christ that's why the scripture says Jesus Christ is what the same yesterday today and forever so if he does it today then you know your God is alive with you then you take him as real then that will make you it give you what faith confidence Assurance truthfulness then you are willing to even if there is dead you don't care you are willing to die for it otherwise you are just serving God on the wall because you are not sure am I telling the truth or not am I telling you the truth or I'm lying to you because let me tell you the god that the word that we receive here look at me you all know me some of you sister Vanessa brother Brian sister Rosemary uh Philip sister brother Mike wife they know me sister El know me okay and look at me even bringing the word like this I went to Ghana by bringing the word and I can tell you the spirit of God I preach the message I brought here on Genesis chapter 7 I spoke here for indeed have I seen righteousness before me the same thing I testify what the Lord did with me and I preach it for about 1 hour I'm ready to stop the pastor was sitting jumping on the back get up I was I wanted to give him the mic he said no you haven't finished continue as soon as he give me back the mic God is my witness I was say what am I going to say as soon as I hold them out the Lord put into my heart call the people those that have the problem they should come up front I don't want to know believe me to my surprise people were crying even young young boys young some of them young girls and I said Lord wow I'm so shocked I'm so surprised like what did I say that here is the people coming to hear your voice but it's not me it's God God coming out even the testony that how God has dealt with me how I I was sick my pastor came and prayed for me with his wife and I saw God sitting in the chair and I came back to life raising me up and here I'm standing in front of them preaching the gospel I cannot do it God is the one and I was typing to them what do you think this is the sign of Abraham God showing Abraham a last sign before Sarah and Isa came God visit Abraham and design Sarah I said that thing I have seen it I am not talking by God on the wall or God just on hidden on the book I have seen it in reality God Is Ring My Soul now I don't care what whoever spoke I know my God is real I'm talking because I am eyewitness of that you have to be an eyewitness of that otherwise I told them I said listen me I believe what all the prophet preach I may not able to preach it like my brothers or some of the brothers preach God bless them God use them my heart I pray for them but one thing I could know God is real to me God is so real to me that I don't take him for granted because his word is in my heart his word he has revealed to me and says Kofi you are my son you are one of my wife you are one whom I love I came to Calvary to die for you I came to Calvary to for so that you could know that yes I'm alive forever more and I'm in you the people so many of even believers they go to church but this thing is hidden from them I'm just speaking my heart it's hidden from so many we shouldn't take God for granted not so many have seen Jesus Christ is the truth we are just so many are in the message but they never seen Christ Christ has never visit them only few individuals because salvation is an individual and not everybody preaching is 54 Ministry but few that are hidden inside that God is visiting so if God has visited you and let you know you are one of the of the few you have to rejoice you have to give him praise you have to give him thanks let me tell you the prophet William Braham when God visits him he says the Bible has become a new Bible to me why because he know now he's in his office not just in his office he know he God's son to be a God Son the world is over 7 billion how many people are are God's children take this message to people they tell you you are cucko as our pastor was saying like you are insane but you know and I know God is real God is in our soul the Cass we eat here is building us every day drawing us closer every day you getting closer to what God every day you getting closer to what to to see your oh my to meet your maker every day is getting you closer one of these days this word that you eat here will take you to bust you in the air to meet the Lord the Bible says we will meet the Lord what in the air you'll be cut off and yet a lot of people wherever the gospel is preached like this people want to stay home people I says let let me tell you if God is in your heart no matter what happened to you there's no sadness no sadness yes I'm not saying you not be quiet but you you as soon as somebody talk about Christ your heart just lift up because you know why God has done something great thing for you God has done something great thing for you 33 years when God has revealed himself to me and I'm not tired yet I am not tired yet let me tell you I thank him every day of my life this is greater than anything in the world greater than the whole world money even let's say I was rich like H this Tesla Guy what's his name I I don't I forgot the name El M he is the richest man on the Earth right but can he have this Joy can he have what I have let me tell you I'll rather take this and give up all his money because take the word and give up everything even if God just G give you air to breed and you struggling for food don't worry trust him he knows why trust him he will make a way when there's no way why people are tsed about you TOS about because you have no faith but if you have faith glory to God I said glory to God he's real our God is real brother and sisters what Jesus let me tell you he's not dead he's not dead when he open your eye the time I was sick and he came and he begin to let me smell the air smell the tree oh I will see him on the sky on the tree on my room on my bed on everywhere I was seeing him it was so real to me joy joy joy praise be to the Lord I said praise be to the Lord a lot of people they take God as a religion oh going to church no you don't need to go to church you need to go to Christ if you are a Believer watching me and your heart is H backsliding get that backsliding Spirit be in the house of the Lord some people they go to work they come like 5:30 oh the weather is bad I can't come to church tonight the weather is this I'm tired you tired you're not serious you got to take your clothes wear your clothes be there rain or Sunshine When God house door is open once you are not at work sometime I remember the old days when I was coming to church I'll be eating in the car from work straight I used to come to church go all the way to downtown brother uh brother Vis used to bring me go I was I renting a house was difficult that time I had Paul living in shelter tough life and when I go I have to eat orange and sleep because the food that I'll get there is gone and I'll still coming to church take train and come into church when God know you are serious like that a time will come you will do something for you he open the windows of heaven and pour out his Blessing upon you because you know you have confidence in him am I telling the truth all life let me tell you time for us to be serious you know why I don't know why I'm like that but when I was a kid from 11 years I live with soldiers my uncle was a soldier as soon as they hear the Trum trumpet sound every trumpet means something and when a soldier hear a trumpet you will see how they react they don't joke because sometime the trumpet mean they coming after you the soldiers because there is a coup they have overthrow the government in Africa in here I don't know but in Africa so when you he hear the trumpet you have to get your rifle ready your dress your clothes within a few second you have to dress up your gun have to be sharp because if you joke the enemy will take your head off you from Africa brother you know how it is the cool the soldiers Nigerians Ghana Bina for all those areas so when a soldier there here the trumpet they know they have to react and as a believer in Christ we are living in the last hour the trumpet is sounding every day it's almost getting time to close we don't know when the last one will come only God knows so while the trumpet is sounding we should do everything to get into God Ark and the Ark is the word of God is the Cass for this day for you to eat so that it will fortify you for the journey because this journey we not going on this Earth we meeting him in the air and you need everything in your heart so that it will Quicken you when plane is about to take off you heit up with high speed otherwise it cannot go it will stay on the ground we not born to stay on the ground we that are the wife of Christ in this last days the Pentecost they were born to stay on the ground the John Wesley they were born to stay on the ground because they were going to what in the grave but they they will come right but we we are not born to stay on the ground we are born to meet him what in the so you need a quicking power you catch what I'm trying to say you need a quicking power you need every every word of God so that it will fortify the seed of God in you to Quicken you to meet him in the otherwise you are going to be left behind because this is not working on the A and you going to say oh I have time so I can play I have time there's no time for you sister no time for you brother because the engine is warming up every day as the word preach God is releasing the Revelation he's releasing the word the Cass that you need to eat that you don't need to worry how the Lord will bring the word you don't need to worry I'm sorry to say so many of the message people but it's the truth are too much intellectual they have packed knowledge knowledge knowledge knowledge knowledge knowledge knowledge but they don't want to allow the the quicking power to quick that knowledge that they have pack there's a time that we used to pack knowledge but the knowledge days are what over now we have to turn to Quicken power now you have to let the Holy Spirit Quicken that knowledge that you have take so that you know that God is on your side then you have confidence in him let me tell you when a man married a woman sometime they don't know where the future will bring to them but that woman put his faith in the man and that man put his faith in the woman and they says honey we're going to make it thick or cold or hot right am I telling you sisters or brothers that have married wrong or truth it says thick or cold or heart we going to make it right you coming to Jesus he has chose you you have come to him put your life in his hand wherever you want to lead you so be but sometime oh my life is with Jesus Jesus I give you 50% of my life but that 50 I control you understand understand I control this is mine they don't say it but their action will speak better than what w the Lord wants all of you all you have within you put it before the table and say here Lord I am take as I am do with me as you want do with me as you will and you watch you watch then greater things you will see in your own life greater things the Lord will use you greater things that it will shock you think about it how did John the Baptist a literate could preach and saw Christ coming and identify him what make him do that because all he was he gave it to Christ when Christ called him all he was at the age of nine the Lord told him go into the Wilderness he went right he didn't trust his own mind brother brah was not trusting in his own mind but let me tell you you compare listening to the T me I can't read the books by listening to the tape but let me tell you the whole world if you check the knowledge that or the wisdom that come from that man and put all this their PHD this that that people to me he have sense more than all of them you may say k why are you saying this you are you are ignorant that's fine for me but I'm telling you the truth because God wisdom is good knowledge but the wisdom of the Lord the world is foolishness unto the Lord don't you know that so if a man or a woman you don't have the wisdom of God all the wisdom you have is what foolishness unto the Lord and who is stronger than God God wisdom is wiser than Humanity am I telling the truth or lie because since his wisdom created this world I will challenge any scientist he shouldn't take one leave and make me one leave not taking what God has done they call it nature but that nature God made it yes you have to take this and mix with this Miss with that and get this and you say you are s this God didn't take nothing he just spoke it and he came you understand and that's what God is getting you and I to that his word we will surrender and speak it and it will happen because we are am mature God when we speak we we have our characteristic is like our father right and when we speak it it happened right that's what the Lord want us to get into we lose the mind of this world even though we have to go to work we have to eat we have to uh sleep if you are manager you are manager this but don't put your heart into those things Brothers I always tell my son don't put your heart into this trust God move by faith talk by faith walk by faith those things are real the things your eye cannot see because that's what our father Jesus is trying to get us into that's why sorry to say we the uneducated people when we see something that we like we just give our heart when God speak and we like it he says oh I see this is God they we we go with our heart it's just like a woman find the man he love they don't care they go that woman will go with his heart that man will go with his how to love the woman same thing there's no education between right brother Bill you remember when you you saw your honey you went with your heart there was no okay oh here he is laughing you go with your heart no education between it the heart and me when I saw this message that brother Brown brought the Bible begin to open up wow when Pastor Salon preached I said that's it that's it for brother Kofi you may come in Dy literate this it does not matter to me but in my soul it is thus say the Lord when the prophet William Brown preach with I listen to the tape all I can see in my heart I don't understand everything but it does say the Lord and it will take me to meet the Lord in the air so my heart is open so that every word of God if it is not good Lord take it away those things that are good Lord help me to know more and more help me to eat more and more and let me tell you once you are like that you don't raising the word god recognize this is my beloved Son in him I'm well pleased to dwell in him I'm not talking about Jesus only you are part of that then God can use you God can manifest through you God can do greater things in you but most of all the times we human being even though the Lord is to us we become lazy I'm number one God have to come and give us w w w w son wake up what are you doing you sleeping have you forgot what I do for you you want me to always open your mouth and ping open your mouth and ping it's time for you to go and eat the food I brought the food I've given you the tapes I've given you the books I've given you the preachers I'm sending my word every day to you eat it eat it don't reason about it and don't worry about it how it going to come out how even do you know sometime God will allow you to criticize me by the way I bring the word you criticize me oh brother kof says this says that that me why you don't know what God is doing with me don't worry about it he didn't as you to check me he as you to eat the book eat it be like a cow when you are a cow your master has put you into the fail what do you do the cow do eat the grasses how you going to produce me the cow no no the cow just eat the glasses by next year he produce milk be like that when it's not good that's why he have his Pastor there you call me behind and say kof you says this okay move it this way move it that way I will listen me I'm not here for popularity God don't call me to be popular he called me to be humble God didn't call you to be popular he called you to be humble right oh yes he call us to be humble too many Believers I seen some girls some ladies they wear long dress long the the close here but the spirit in them hasn't changed the spirit in them hasn't changed one bit it's not what God want is the heart the mental the heart is the heart clean heart God want humility God humility not man humility then God can use you God can possess you because the ccass he's given to you the word is opening up and once the word is open up he want you to eat that's why it says the spirit of Jesus Christ the spirit of the Bride are what one if you are testing come and drink let's say you walking on the Arizona desert and you are test you there's no water and somebody has brought you drop PL passing and dropping water for you are you going to scrutinize the water oh this is clean water this is that water this is this you have no time I remember 1998 1983 I was in Nigeria and they deported ghans were about 1 million people deported and let's see all of us to have to pass Buffalo so many of us some even stay in the bush no water to drink this that the only thing you could get is you see a helicopter running on the sky very hot and dropping blood and water people were going crazy and look at me now around that time I was so skinny and so small right the life was so tough we hustling to go to Better Life another country but when you get that one water people running and fighting and doing everything to get water to drink people have live in the bush for three 4 days I was inside but by God's grace when you get that water you don't check oh the water have worms and this and that no you drink it you don't drink it you die if you don't hear the word of God what are you going to do that's why even sometime Believers become weak they become sick you see them they come here once in a two months 3 months then you wonder how can he even how is he surviving naturally when you don't eat don't you know you get sick so when the food is cooked every day the pastor is taking his time let me tell you don't take it for granted it's not just we wake up and come and stand here and then we close the Bible and we go home no you don't know why you were sleeping I was thinking oh God what am I supposed to bring for my brothers and sisters which way you want me to say what do you want me to say to them Lord I don't have knowledge to speak but I'm trusting in you I'm laying my heart to you have mercy on me so that I I won't speak my mind I'll speak your mind to them I'll speak what you want that they will receive it and it will be a blessing to them I believe every five four Ministry that stand here do that so you the congregation pray for the pastor pray for everyone that stand here it's not easy Once you come in to preach you are not sleeping you may be on bed my mind is thinking this way that way and the devil is fighting this you try to to try to bring the word right you you you you want your mind to channel to God so that y all of a sudden you see the Devil comes in and he show you all kinds of scriptures and he doesn't tied up and you says oh God then you realize hey Lord I am nothing without you but last minute you'll find out that something will be cooking then you know that hey if I come here the Lord is with me so he will feed his children brothers and sisters I really appreciate you so much I love this good neighbor Ministry I love the people that you are in you are my brothers and sisters you are you are my uh I say I'll be with you in eternity with God so you are my real sisters and brothers I'm not joking I am not I speak from my heart I love you in Christ and I will always love you if I do something wrong or you see something wrong Don't Be Afraid point me to the right way even if I don't cease it and it's trueth God will show me and I will obey once God show me I will obey because without him I am nothing that should be your attitude and be willing to subject to the pastor whatever the pastor says to you obey and follow don't do your own things obey the pastor because everything God wanted to do it go through the pastor first and if you obey you get blessing if you obey the holy spirit in the past that some will broke and come to you why do you think look at me God will put me here I came to the church I my heart I want a clean always I want a clean sometime I'm cleaning Pastor Simon that time everybody is not there I'm alone you come and hold the broom trying to clean with me and I wish I could divide myself into two so that I hold half he hold half and we clean the I clean I hold half and the Half of Me Hold the broom from his hand and we clean the church God saw that and I'm not saying for poity take it the right way right because when you do those things God somehow whatever you doing not just cleaning alone do with all your heart for the Lord you'll get blessed the Lord won't forsake you he will bless you e let your eye first go in the ccass what is the ccass the word of God for your day everything you doing if your eye don't go on the word and you are clearing and you are doing works then it become a hypocrite but when your eye go in the word first before anything add up God is pleased because Jesus said I honor my word above my name is that not right so once the word is first absolute in your heart then the works follow then the words to you do it with all your heart then God will bless you God will honor you God will let the people even cease it those that have ey to see that oh this brother have the Holy Spirit they will know they will know God will show you to them that yes I'm in my servant I'm in him regardless what you think I am in him so when he speak hear him it's not him speaking it's I the Lord speaking hear him because he said I honor my word above my name because those that are not his when they speak they speak worse but those that are his he honor the word you know it's the Lord you have confidence why the word is coming and I believe in here we are so blessed we are so so blessed that we we don't realize it when I go some place and preach I see how God even I'm let's say I'm in montre and some are calling me let's say Oakville here I'm in montre preaching preaching over there some are calling me in Oakville to come and preach for them a Mery church not a a even Den Nation they calling me to come and preach for them why they because they think I'm here what is that you say you brother K yes God is my witness I don't lie and I don't do but I'm not a I don't want to be popular I don't if it is popularity then let me sit down and let Brothers preach to me I I accepted it but God will show that is not coffee coffee has nothing to do with it but it's him doing everything so let us love one another bind our heart with God love because God loved this good neighbor Ministry the people every single morning have been seeing that God's spirit is is moving through our beloved pastor and you those that are spiritual that have eye we can see how the word is coming forth let us keep on praying for him praying for his wife praying for his family because in times like that the devil will always attack him the word says smash the shepherd and the Sheep will scatter it but once the the shepherd is there right he can't smash him then no sheep is going out right no sheep cuz all the Sheep has bound their head together and the shepherd take the touch and lead us you take the word of God and lead us and we follow whether rain or Sunshine we follow God bless each and every one of you I won't keep you long I am done brother anony you come and I would love to sing one song because he live I can face tomorrow then
