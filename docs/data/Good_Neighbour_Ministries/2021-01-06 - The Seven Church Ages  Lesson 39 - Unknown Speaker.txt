TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good evening friends another glorious time that we can spend in the presence of the lord may the lord bless you real good and may the great holy spirit take the time to step aside out of the bushes and speak with us and show us the light for of his word may god bless us together as we do this study uh and commentary on the seven church ages uh speaking from revelation chapter 2 verses 8 and 9. and unto the angel of the church in smyrna right these things set the first and the last which was dead and is alive i know thy works and tribulation and poverty but thou art rich and i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are of this synagogue of satan may the lord jesus be with us let us pray a gracious god and heavenly father be ask thy blessing upon thy word may we receive from you lord your truth your light your word and way take all the glory honor and praise in jesus name we ask it amen and amen praise be to god hallelujah friends it's all over the revival that proceeded from or stemmed from the 1906 outpouring out the holy spirit at a souza street that fell upon the saints of god to bring about a restoration of the baptism of the holy spirit which brought in the restoration of gifts and then the restoration of the word of god that revival is now over the fires of revival have died out all we are left with are hardly even any embers the coals the light are gone out here and there there may be little sparks other than that we are left with nothing whatsoever many today with names upon their uh doors and on their signboards claiming that they are this or that or or the move of revival or pentecost the power of god my friends they have a name that they're living but they are dead in other words picture a man or or woman trying to ride a dead horse the horse is dead it doesn't matter how much you try to whip it up it doesn't matter what you use to try to get that animal to stir itself it can't because you're riding a dead horse outside of its time it's time is over it's dead the seventh church age is dead the messenger has come and gone and is dead and gone on and now the greater than solomon is here and now god is his own interpreter the holy spirit working in and through the lives of truly anointed believers elected sons and daughters of god using them for his glory but what has happened what caused the great fires of god to die out what caused this revival to be over what is it that caused its time to be up they threw cold water on that revival through their their means of trying to conserve contain control and to can god's spirit of revival in order to preserve it but god already told us don't try to keep the manna don't you put it in a box or hide it in your bed or or wrap it in a in a piece of cloth trying to protect it god himself is the defender of his own word and of his own fate for he watches over his word to see that it performs exactly what he says but nevertheless man true wisdom knowledge theology and so on has inserted himself within the plan of god and telling and announcing to god that he or they will now be the heroes or defenders of his fate it is his faith but we are going to defend his faith in other words we're telling him we can do it better than you can so we're going to stand here and defend your faith and they failed and they are failing and by organizational systems and the methods and minds of men they have thrown cold waters icicles upon the great movement of god and the great burning fires of the holy spirit and has caused it to cool off completely while they're talking about the holy spirit they were actually quenching the holy spirit yes sir they were actually blaspheming against the holy spirit and they were actually denying the holy spirit and the power of god thereof my friends and here we find ourselves with the the revival dead died out gone uh uh finished it's over with amen hallelujah but they're trying to whip a dead horse they're trying to use a various methods maybe formaldehyde injections i don't know but they're trying to revive something that's already gone you can not revive that dead animal that you try to use to produce your products and here we find them now trying to revive it by saying that talking about the evidence of the holy spirit my friends oh how towns is the evidence of the holy spirit and of course we know my friends that the devil can talk in towns maybe even better than you or i can uh for god has anointed me with that gift and there are others also but let me say this my friends tongues cannot and is not the infallible evidence of the presence of the holy spirit within a life that evidence according to the word of god is when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth and show you things to come there is the evidence according to the lord jesus christ himself that the holy spirit illuminating enlightening inspiring anointing you with the opening of your eyes opening of the heart to receive the word of god for your day the message of the word for your day and giving you divine understanding to know what the word the written word the spoken word what it is saying or what he is saying through those instrumentalities oh blessed be the name of the lord amen my friends they thought they could use the power of organization as their pathway to using the power of god without his will without his permission they are going to take the power of god and use it anyway whether god likes it or not and they're they intended to do that through the instrument of organization and god would not allow it they speak of this evidence the evidence of the holy spirit being in tongues absolutely false it is contrary to the word of god they use the pictures or they use the what we read in acts 1 2 3 they read that and use that and pervert that to take your mind away from the genuine evidence is that they caught a revelation of what jesus was trying to tell them for three and a half years and they got so excited by what they heard the evidence was that they received finally a breakthrough in their understanding and of the revelation of the word that came to them that they are so excited it caused them to speak in towns because they became so thrilled so aesthetic overcome with joy that they they could hardly talk and towns came out of them tongues was not the evidence it is an evidence and evidence eh that they they express but it's the reception of the revelation of the word that was accumulated in them over the time they spent with the message of their day and their hour who was none other than the lord jesus christ and may i say he is the same yesterday today and forever glory be to god hallelujah instead of tongues being the evidence of the holy spirit they don't understand that tongues is the evidence of confusion you go back to babel back to the beginning we see the seeds planted right back in they were all talking with towns but it produced what confusion it was a bay bell and the tower of bay beltran organization is raising up again a great tire to the glory of satan and here friends they call that the holy spirit misdirecting misleading the people who claim to be the people of god and once again here is satan here is man my friends using the profusion of towns not realizing that this profusion of towns is the evidence of the end time a sign of the end time yes sir uh it's the very same thing we can see clearly in the word of god amen hallelujah man trying to tell god what he should anoint and who she should anoint and who is failed and who is not by giving that kind of an evidence that we will not accept or believe that that this man or woman is filled with the holy spirit unless they speak in towns unless we see the piercings in your hand and and all in your sight we won't believe it we would receive it but god in his word said when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth and show you things to come my friends the handwriting is on the wall think of it oh my a sign of the end time yes calling themselves full gospel proud with their pentecostal pride filled with pentecost but let them prove it oh yeah they want to prove it by signs and wonders not by the word of god not by divine revelation not by constant present tense activity of the holy spirit working within their lives amen my friends at pentecost the fire came in the form of a cloud and broke itself up and the town separated itself and it fell upon each of them amen but where is the fire to today where is that supernatural evidence of the fire of god oh may god help us hallelujah amen they spoke in towns at pentecost hallelujah but when they spoke in towns the people of different languages and nations understood what they were saying even though they were speaking in an unknown town as it may appear that i am doing right now oh my friends that language that they were speaking were on this was understood by supernatural anointing and revelation the people understood what they were saying while they were speaking in terms yes they said we have the evidence but back then all the people that received the holy spirit acted and moved together as one family instead what do we have a perversion calling itself the genuine while it is the false because pentecost and the present day world system is more divided than it has ever been before next they claim they're the original but of the original not anyone could just come and join the church or become a member of the church or associate with the church for the bible clearly tells us there's no man joining them himself to them except the lord was to permit him oh my friends hallelujah and so we end up with many goats a lot of goat spirited believers spirited all right but it's a spirit of a goat jumping air and jumping there and dancing here and dancing there and running the floors over here but it's the spirit of a goat contrary to the word of the living god they claim to be full of the holy ghost and can't really prove it the empty of the genuine real power of god amen they don't have that genuine real power of god amongst them amen if they're so full of the gospel as they claim match your doctrine match your teaching against the word of god and see where it leads you oh not true septility not true manipulation and imaginations of man but by the revelation of the holy spirit moving through the believer lord of god hallelujah singing about uh what a great change what a great change yes there's been a great change with a change for the worse because we find men and women feel themselves amen oh praise god denying the power thereof while talking about the power denying the power talking about the holy spirit fighting against the holy spirit denying the very holy spirit they're claiming to worship that's the way of satan that's the way of cain while claiming faith claiming religion actually rebelling against the word of god and against the genuine holy spirit they have a name they're living but they're dead as i've said before riding a dead horse tongues is not the evidence of revival my friends it is the evidence of spiritual death let me repeat towns speaking in towns which the present-day pentecostals claim to be the evidence of the holy spirit it's actually the evidence of spiritual death that's the evidence my friends that the seventh church age is over it's gone oh think of it in the old testament when they thought they were having a great revival oh ichabod is written against the church names ichabod upon the doorpost ichabod i am this i am that i'm that and and have all these denominational names and god said it's all curse the glory is departed you have a name that you're living and you're dead right where you are for the spirit of god has taken its light and gone my away from where it was amen no the dove could not land upon dead carcasses the dove had to land upon a fresh grown olive branch that same holy spirit today must land upon jesus who is the branch the word of god made manifest for this day and for this hour praise the name of the lord all glory to his marvelous and wonderful name think of it ichabod written on your doorpost you think that name you took it's a blessing it's a curse upon you the glory of god is departed looking backwards like a frog looking back to some great thing back there and letting that big influence to use that to give you credibility and influence and power but that day is past we are living in the present tense of the word of god amen amen once down in babylon down in the land of confusion where the various nations were brought into natural captivity today its spiritual captivity of spiritual babylon the harlotry the sale of religion the buying and selling of faith my god think of it babylon again and once again we see the hand writing on the wall many men there you farsen oh you're waving the balances and found wanting oh friend this is not the evidence of the holy spirit it's the evidence of the sign of the end sign of the end of the gentile dispensation yes sir the jed the gentile dispensation is over now the entire spirit and word and truth and light of god as the sun all moves westward it rises these sets in the west and then when that edge dies or sets in the west then the new day the new day the sun rises again but where does it rise from it went down in the west but it rises again in the east oh oh friends we are on the borderland we are right where this is going back to our jewish brothers and sisters this is going back to israel this is going back to the house of david the holy spirit is lifting up his righteousness his truth his light and the great eagles of jehovah the great eagle jehovah is flying over his people and covering them with his wings and protecting them with his wings for this is going back to his people at this hour glory to god and many like myself are announcing that and telling you that for it is the truth of the word of the living god hallelujah oh blessed be his name listen friends tongues the evidence of the end of the ideas and the fruits of the mind of man god will not put up with it any longer man inserting himself into god's plan and trying to tell him they have a better way of running his church his people of administrating and leading and guiding them better than he has in his word oh wake up people of the living god wake up check yourself against the promises of this day and of this hour to see what god is doing oh praise god the organization on organizing man oh a better way of being able to streamline god's church and place it from being a rag tag group rough human preachers and refund simple humble believers into a streamline system how we can actually move people from being out there in the world and clean them up by step one base one base two base three base four it is all nice and good and oh well sounding to the ears and beautiful on the eyes and moving to the mind but friends that's not the word of god god has his own way his own system and his own uh way of doing things amen here we see them trying to organize uh until we have an invasion of the pulpit invasion of the pulpits that's just a topic of its own but the pulpit the true genuine holy ghost pulpit of the living god has been anointed by all kinds of bugs and germs and and so viruses have invaded the pulpit of god and we find demons hiding behind scholarship devils hiding behind religious knowledge and claiming like satan did in the garden to preach to eve and to tell her did not god say and he'll tell her exactly what was there and he may even be a better scholar than you are and yet it's not the holy spirit but satan hiding behind the disguise of that which looks like a human may god help us everyone this mary stand against this invasion of the pulpit men without the genuine call of god upon them they'll spread all kinds of myths and stories of this or that the sciences that they're taking in them sciences of illustration sciences of of of uh of preaching sciences of how to give and all to call the science of how to do an introduction the science of how to pres a presentation of the body part of a talk and all these this system of ties and placed it all together them like that because they they they're against their random spontaneous anointed floyd free-flowing word of the living god because then satan cannot trace track or understand what god is doing and what next he'll say true that genuine servant or daughter of the living god whoever he may be using whether in preaching or testifying or talking satan it sends him crazy he can't understand that back to the word people wake up to yourself come to yourself and see your true and living god within your life and within your heart oh glory to god amen amen my friends they invaded the pulpits self-styled man of god oh no more men of god like what's in the bible most of them rugged men men come off of a mountain or wearing some kind of a camel skin and wearing on some goat skin or sheepskin smelly my god out from the wilderness men that would chop down trees kill snakes in the wilderness men that had even their talk uh their words were just rough hewn wasn't smooth hissing like a serpent but there were men that were not that come out like that because that's the way god wants this veil to hide behind that kind of a veil so you might despise it you might not recognize it meanwhile it's god behind skin god hiding behind badger skins and unveiling his word in in this day and this hour as it was in that hour god did not take man of perfumed lace-hand kerchiefs god did not take man my friends with beautiful robes of purple and and so on and and that type of thing god did not take man from in the rabbinical schools that were going forth nothing wrong with the schools nothing wrong with the rabbis but friends god chooses of his own choosing not by the head rabbi or the head pope or the head supervisor and superintendent choosing who is and who will not be ordained but god ordains by his own choosing through the blessed holy spirit of the living god amen oh my here we are friends them not having confidence in the five-fold ministry of ephesians 4 and 10 to 13 13. they're literally by setting up their own orders and their own ways of doing things they are saying in a backhanded way that god has failed in properly setting up his church so we will now give you proper order and we will set it up in such a beautiful way like kane we will set it up in such an orderly way like yes his altar we will do it and we will let you see what it really should be not knowing that they're fulfilling prophecy you're fulfilling prophecy amen and they are going to game saying of course they're coming against god's word amen and not even realizing it amen they don't even know their fulfilling prophecy and blindly preaching human experience instead of having access to the truth which is only given by the holy spirit not by human minds and a comparison of human uh topics and and resource and research and whether by computer or whatever it's not given by that it'll bring you very close and you can even cause some people to believe that you have it when you don't have it you got it somewhere some by your accumulation of knowledge and the sharpness of your mental abilities and agility and uh but it's still contrary to the word of the living god oh my lord help us think of it amen what are the qualifications then first genuine spiritual leadership friends i'm here to tell you it's not having power and prestige power from the prestige of having a lot of money and that's where a lot of leadership gets their power and their prestige from it's from oh i can prove to you i'm a success or i'm successful and i i know what to do in this natural world to get things done i have to make things move and therefore here i am now in the spiritual world and i'll use those capacities and abilities and potentials to be able to to to recreate the same thing but that sounds good but it's not of god god doesn't need your wisdom god doesn't need your ability he does not need your knowledge who will teach him who will counsel him who will advise him he is his own god his own interpreter you need his wisdom he said can all the wisdom of this entire world with all his princes he said it's nothing but a drop of bucket uh dropping a bucket to me oh think of that which would you rather have the wisdom of men which is a drop in the bucket or access to the unlimited unfailing endless wisdom knowledge and revelation of the true living god just be sure that his presence living presence is in your life and let him flow through you as the sun said flow through me holy spirit flow through me amen that he might flow through your life and be a blessing to the world true spiritual leadership is not being a real good social leader uh oh they want the leader to have pure real social skills of how to talk like a prince to people to be a real religious politician to know how to slink around and how to move around obstacles uh how to wind themselves around situations my friends god didn't call us to be politicians religious politicians uh like that no sir he called us to be man of god the access led to the roots amen high places full of pride are brought down to the ground and low prices are raised up by the power and presence of the living god hallelujah yes sir no true spiritual leadership the qualifications for it my friends is not for one to have religious maneuvering and all type of things of that nature business abilities amen all manner of uh using sheer mental prowess the the power of their minds sharp oh and use that to be a substitute for the power of god the penetrating power of hebrews 4 12. it's so close that the devil wants it to seem as if that was the holy ghost and it is not the holy ghost from that amen amen those things do not qualify a man amen for spiritual leadership or give him weight in the word of god in the world that's how satan and in christianity and in religion that's how he seeks to create credibility around persons and dignitaries and even normal people taking the ministry not knowing from what angle they're taking it and he gives them weight and credibility through those kinds of qualities but god gives a person amen their credibility comes from the revealing of the word or the word itself revealing itself through the individual and bringing glory and honor to his mighty name god bless his real wonderful leadership that god has placed within his church amen that are not there by human materialism they're not there by human values of course we care what people think of us but as men of god we are exactly that not just man of the people but we are men of god we are yes we are here to serve and help the people but our master we are servants of the living god so we serve god first and we are on our knees kneeling before god day night but on our feet before men and women like ourselves for we carry in our vessel the word of this hour and of this day to bring glory to his name amen praise god hallelujah now remember friends i'm not speaking about real elders genuine god sent elders i'm talking about these fake elders that are really not anointed by the holy ghost and all they're about is monkey business monkey see and monkey do we are we're not for that we are here in the word of god for the real word to be made manifest god made you a different way made me a different way cause me to be able to express himself and the word in in the way he has made me and it made disrupted my interrupted might cause some people uh to become mad some sad some glad but but that's the purpose of god god has you in his way to to sound very reasonable and well-placed and soft-spoken then he asked me another way we are all shining lights from the same diamond to bring glory for his name hallelujah i'm just bringing the truth the way he shows me and the way he reveals it through me not of myself or for myself but for his glory and for his honor god bless the name of jesus christ look a real elder might be one of the poorest men in your midst and he is an elder not by his wealth but by the presence of god within him i tell you friends i accept and believe a man can be an elder he may be the poorest man yet he's the elder he may be one of the richest man but he's not to be despised because he's rich for god can use any man who regardless of who he is and what he has as long as he doesn't allow those things to be before his eyes and before his face and allow god to be the number one in his life and to seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all other things will be added onto thank god hallelujah oh yes that's really my friends to have the genuine spiritual qualifications of a man whether he be an elder or a deacon amen is to allow god to have first place and to move by the holy spirit amen praise god what a day we're living in when the people my friends are spiritually rich but spiritually impoverished and poor in this laodicean age and which we are in no wonder he says i know your poverty amen and that poverty is linked to satan's synagogue because that's what satan synagogue does it'll impoverish those people that are within them suck out vacuum out pull out all their giving their money money money money money money money and their god being mammon all they will be able to talk about is money instead of the master and instead of the glory of the name of jesus christ and leaving the rest of him and he'll work it out not to send a soldier into war and not to give him the arms and give him whatever is needed for him to carry out that spiritual warfare to glorify his mighty name amen amen all they want is to get their organization rich and powerful the membership may be in another state but they don't care as long as their organization is rich and powerful and god is still here moving in the hearts and in the minds of men amen oh praise god when jesus died did he leave buildings great buildings great properties gold and silver precious stones and crowns and everything else did he leave that did he leave the princes and this of his discipleship behind and that made them leadership of the church no he did leave no such a thing my friends he did not come riding in a pink cadillac to preach the gospel he came upon a donkey he came on a poor simple beast to show you in simplicity humility that god takes his word oh blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah all praise god friends it's always the little flock that's pushed aside and loses out against these big organizations and then where do they have to go my friends they look down the pawn but they have to scurry and find some place they can rent or hide in a basement in a house in some kind of a rented place just like they had to hide in the catacombs it's here today still but in another form not being pierced with literal swords and spears but with the criticisms accusations assassinations of character that's going on may god help us everyone here today may god help us amen but why do they do it it's because that little elected flock of god is a rebuke to the generation they are a rebuke and they're a comparison to the world looking over here and looking over there they see the true and the false the real and the unreal oh my friends amen that is why uh we stick out like sore thumbs we stick out like oddballs because of his life moving and working within the believer and before the wicked the righteous intent them no harm no hurt whatsoever but they seem to always was some assume the worse and feel that we are up to no good and so we have to be dealt with like herod dealt with john the baptist who told him the truth that he was committing adultery with his brother's wife oh my god hallelujah oh the shame the embarrassment to a person in my position how can the preachers preach like that and speak like that but friends that's what a preacher a genuine preacher is he looks not to the right nor to the left or for the favors of man or whether there will be rich powerful or poor he just looks to the glory of god and he looks to his master for his reward and he preaches the word of god the way god gave it to him amen hallelujah my friends the same sinister evil force this fiend this evil being that was behind herod that inspired him to shut out the voice that was preaching and speaking the truth to him which truth he did not want to hear my friends and the only way he thought he could do it is by shutting up john the baptist voice not knowing that that voice will rise again and some other individual some other person somewhere else and god will raise up for he never leaves himself without a witness and he uses his witnesses for his glory and for his honor hallelujah and there is still such a force in the world today we know my friends satan is that sinister force oh he is the force behind these kinds of people that are truly void of conscience the spiritually deaf spiritually dumb amen my friends and spiritually without a conscience these people honor me with their lips my friends but not with their hearts think of it this is the day we're living in may the holy spirit take the word spoken here today what happened in those church ages were a picture of what was to happen and is happening in our day and at our time and we are in the midst of it now take heed lest you perish and may the holy spirit be with us all in this hour and in this day our gracious heavenly father we ask thy blessing upon this your people pour out of your holy spirit with understanding and the wisdom and revelation of this hour and causes all to see understand and know the day in which we live on the lord god whom we serve to your honor and glory in jesus christ's name amen and amen god bless you and god be with you all we'll see you on sunday where we will speak again my friends touching on these two mysterious trees that came from the garden of eden and their branches are stretched out right down through the ages in time and prophecy right to our day and still the fruits are there let us make our choice in jesus name god bless you [Music] you
