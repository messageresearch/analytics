[17:47] over 200 and something or whatever but i
[17:51] i tried to collect as many as i could
[17:54] that pointed directly to our topic i
[17:59] just want to read one verse out of acts
[18:01] chapter 25
[18:03] i believe it's verse 16.
[18:07] it says paul answering them after
[18:10] telling about his wonderful life
[18:13] to the king he said
[18:15] where upon o king
[18:17] agrippa
[18:19] i was not disobedient
[18:23] unto the heavenly vision
[18:25] i want to praise and thank god
[18:28] that
[18:29] i may be able to say that
[18:32] that through my life from
[18:35] boyhood to this time
[18:37] i have not been disobedient
[18:40] to the heavenly vision praise god i
[18:44] didn't see a light at midday
[18:46] but
[18:47] we saw a light
[18:49] around midnight
[18:52] right and we i give god praise honor and
[18:55] glory for that

[32:23] bailey was there
[32:25] and
[32:26] it took root in him
[32:28] since he's young
[32:30] and so
[32:32] when the father wanted him to take over
[32:35] the church that the father had which his
[32:37] brother is running that now
[32:39] he said no

[32:42] father said what why you're so young how
[32:44] could you be telling me but he did and
[32:46] the result is he's pastoring the present
[32:49] church that god helped him to raise up

[33:18] he's an original that was there along
[33:20] with brother
[33:22] hing
[33:22] brother greg samaru
[33:25] uh is his name greg samaru and i thank
[33:28] god for him hallelujah next one
[33:35] this
[33:36] is brother
[33:38] peter
[33:39] in guyana not the one you know up here
[33:43] but this is brother peter in guyana
[33:46] and
[33:47] they give him the name of son son
[33:50] son son they call him
[33:53] he is the son
[33:55] of brother mustafa
[33:57] muhammad
[33:59] who is the brother
[34:02] that that when myself and others
[34:05] shared books but i did the same thing
[34:07] here we walked the streets up at bruce
[34:09] deal and gave out books and tracks and
[34:12] stuff like that and some people throw
[34:14] them away they don't want it they don't
[34:16] want to receive it
[34:17] so
[34:18] this brother mohammed he found the book
[34:20] in the garbage
[34:22] but how do we know the story
[34:25] because myself and another brother who
[34:27] was working with him
[34:30] we went to his home together as this
[34:33] brother's friend just
[34:35] you know talked with him
[34:37] and while talking with him
[34:39] we thought we would start to witness to
[34:41] him about the message
[34:44] and he said may not believe nobody but
[34:46] prophet brahman
[34:52] so we are shocked now
[34:54] we go to witness to him and he's telling
[34:57] us
[34:59] how do you know about
[35:00] uh branham how do you know anything
[35:03] about him and then he told us the story
[35:07] how many you know i don't want to go
[35:09] into that parlance
[35:11] how he found this book in the garbage
[35:15] and how you read the book
[35:17] and he as a muslim didn't need nobody to
[35:21] convince him
[35:23] and look it's not easy for any you know
[35:26] that muhammadans don't walk away from
[35:29] their fate like that
[35:32] and when you see no man was there only
[35:35] god and he
[35:37] read that book out of the garbage can
[35:40] and was converted
[35:42] but he needed to be baptized and he knew
[35:45] it
[35:46] but he didn't know who he knew
[35:49] that could do it none of them around
[35:51] there would do it but here he comes in
[35:53] contact with us by the hand of god and
[35:55] he realized that's the supernatural
[35:58] operating there
[35:59] and we had a good time of hugging and
[36:03] laughter and fellowship and his wife
[36:06] went and
[36:07] you know

[44:14] we trust the lord for his great grace
[44:16] but we're heading out
[44:18] now you see how long the road is until
[44:20] it it's going up hills and
[44:23] valleys little valleys like that anyway
[44:26] but look how narrow
[44:28] right
[44:29] but that's what i'm talking about when i
[44:31] left there
[44:32] that was not even a pitched road
[44:36] those were just
[44:38] sandy roads that you just drive on it
[44:41] but they did that
[44:44] and now that they're able to do more
[44:47] they're looking now to widen all those
[44:49] things
[44:50] and and carry it as far out as possible
[44:54] next
[44:58] we're still going
[45:02] it's starting to rain that's why you see
[45:04] the foggy business
[45:08] okay we turned off the road to head to
[45:11] his farm and now
[45:14] this is way out in of the city in the
[45:16] countryside country
[45:18] and now we headed to his farm and all it
[45:21] is is a
[45:23] dirt road you don't expect to have pitch
[45:26] road going into your farms and stuff
[45:29] like that there
[45:31] next
[45:34] i'll show you how the road is winding
[45:36] we're going in
[45:40] and there he is on his farm
[45:43] right
[45:44] rather duncan
[45:46] he's all
[45:47] talked up
[45:50] praise god

[45:53] as i'm getting out of the van
[45:57] okay next
[46:01] that's the house that they are in
[46:05] he bought all the land and
[46:08] the house included so it's just him and
[46:11] his sister
[46:12] and the other sister
[46:14] had just
[46:16] gone back from canada
[46:19] to live now in guyana
[46:22] and so she is there with them

[46:47] simon beside them
[46:50] and those
[46:52] black containers you see there are you
[46:55] know they are set there to hold water
[47:00] and the water coming down
[47:02] creates its own pressure to be able to
[47:05] push it through your pipes and things
[47:07] within your house so that's what that is
[47:11] next
[47:18] okay that's just a
[47:20] scene of the some of the land you know
[47:23] the farm
[47:24] land that's there

[49:39] type of buildings
[49:45] but those this is the bridge again a lot
[49:47] of those british old buildings are now
[49:50] being torn down
[49:52] and people are encouraging them to keep
[49:55] some for history's sake you know
[49:59] very important
[50:01] now
[50:02] crossing that bridge again
[50:06] let's go i think here we may be going to
[50:09] s equivalent or something but anyway
[50:14] this is a one mile wide bridge
[50:18] this is
[50:20] um okay this is on the west coast
[50:24] you have to go through here first
[50:26] next
[50:29] we're going on to the ferry
[50:32] right the ferry is right ahead
[50:35] and we're going we're driving
[50:38] right into it
[50:40] next
[50:43] okay we are in it now with our vehicle
[50:50] now this is just part of the river
[50:53] and those is not that's not the other
[50:55] side those are huge islands where you
[50:59] have maybe a couple of thousand people
[51:02] are living on them right they're
[51:04] occupied they got
[51:06] buildings and everything on them right
[51:08] and farms and everything else next
[51:16] move on
[51:20] these are smaller craft
[51:23] smaller craft
[51:25] right
[51:26] um
[51:28] that um
[51:30] there can be fishermen they can be
[51:32] people transporting people up the river
[51:35] down the river
[51:36] things of that nature
[51:38] next
[51:44] okay
[51:45] we're out in the river and i told you
[51:48] before it's 22 miles wide
[51:51] right
[51:52] and these are islands occupied islands
[51:56] but we're just passing
[51:58] through them or beside them
[52:02] next
[52:05] that's another
[52:07] smaller ferry
[52:10] that's going to another area
[52:19] next
[52:23] okay we're near nearing the shoreline
[52:28] and
[52:29] i was kind of worried because this big
[52:31] ferry is going so close to the island i
[52:35] said it might go aground
[52:37] said no
[52:38] they already know that the channel the
[52:40] waters made the channel right there if
[52:43] you go out in the middle where it looks
[52:45] he said there's a lot of sand banks and
[52:48] things and the captain knows what he's
[52:50] doing
[52:51] so
[52:52] he brought the ship along there next
[52:56] this is just a scenery of inside so you
[52:59] understand it's big enough for several
[53:02] trucks and cars and vehicles
[53:08] next
[53:09] we're coming out of it
[53:13] we're now in s equivalent
[53:22] thanks

[53:39] trick quarter of an hour drive at this
[53:41] point we are thirsty and
[53:44] you know
[53:44] a little
[53:46] thirsty so we said we'd stop
[53:48] at this chinese supermarket
[53:51] that's there
[53:54] and so they went in to get some things
[53:57] and i just sat outside
[54:00] because remember um
[54:03] that's a warm country that's warm all
[54:05] the time
[54:06] so they don't have to make allowance for
[54:08] winter or anything like that

[54:40] picture
[54:41] of this place
[54:45] next

[54:49] china supermarket
[54:52] right it's a big supermarket
[54:56] right
[54:57] next
[54:59] okay
[55:00] then we drive another hour
[55:03] up the coast from there and um
[55:08] this
[55:09] is the home
[55:11] of
[55:12] a believing couple
[55:15] right

[55:17] and john
[55:19] and as i told you i call him big john
[55:22] right and
[55:24] we call her jenny brothers and sisters
[55:26] in christ believers of the gospel
[55:29] and
[55:30] going down part of the road
[55:33] it's not pitched
[55:35] and it's the same red
[55:37] dirt like you have in africa
[55:41] right
[55:41] and but on the inside what you see it's
[55:45] not concrete
[55:47] it's pure white sand
[55:50] there's a lot of that there on the
[55:52] ground pure white sand and when the rain
[55:54] falls
[55:55] that makes it settle down and becomes
[55:57] like concrete or it becomes
[56:00] packed on the ground
[56:02] right and we had
[56:04] lunch with them
[56:06] we fun with them

[56:36] god
[56:37] hallelujah amen next slide
[56:43] now
[56:45] i think i mentioned
[56:46] they would have to leave their house
[56:49] go out to the main road
[56:52] walk a long way to get to the next
[56:56] road that goes for
[56:58] four or five miles into
[57:01] the bush
[57:03] and that is usually dark because there
[57:05] is no lights
[57:07] and they would have to walk down that
[57:09] road all the way to get to this
[57:13] church
[57:14] right
[57:16] and by the grace of god
[57:19] you see

[58:52] this is part of the road
[58:55] and notices only the car light caused
[58:57] you to see the road
[58:59] you can look and see it's pitch black
[59:03] right pitch you don't know what you're
[59:06] stepping on
[59:09] you don't know what could spring out the
[59:11] bushes
[59:13] whatever it's there but this is highly
[59:16] unlikely because the animals and things
[59:19] they keep away where they know human
[59:21] beings are
[59:23] maybe if you're walking alone in the
[59:25] quietness of late in the night nobody
[59:28] else is around then you may have a
[59:30] problem but usually
[59:33] they're not there but i want you to see
[59:35] the conditions and what it is what
[59:37] believers
[59:39] are daring and doing by faith to be able
[59:42] to worship and praise god
[59:45] hallelujah
[59:47] and and and we
[59:49] we complain a little bit about the rain
[59:51] we complain a little bit of snow we come
[59:53] and we have a car that we're driving
[59:55] it's not you walking through
[59:57] you're driving through the snow heated
[59:59] on the inside cooled in the summer
[1:00:03] and everything else and these people are
[1:00:05] walking
[1:00:07] praise god like you know
[1:00:10] while he was taking
[1:00:12] us in some work men usually walk that
[1:00:16] four or five miles
[1:00:18] which is
[1:00:19] to people who are in those conditions
[1:00:22] that's nothing
[1:00:24] because when i was in the sudan
[1:00:26] people walk for two weeks
[1:00:29] to get to the meeting
[1:00:31] and it wasn't 10 or 100 people it was
[1:00:34] like 3 000 people
[1:00:37] right
[1:00:38] so so you can understand the
[1:00:40] mindset um
[1:00:43] they're built
[1:00:44] to
[1:00:45] survive there
[1:00:48] right you are built to survive hair you
[1:00:51] understand this system you understand
[1:00:53] that you understand what to do now if
[1:00:56] they just come like that
[1:00:58] when they immediately come they don't
[1:01:00] understand it and then they will be
[1:01:02] confused and disoriented and don't know
[1:01:05] how to get on a bus how to use a token
[1:01:07] what is a token and all this and after a
[1:01:10] while they'll pick it up and they'll
[1:01:12] start to survive too but same way with
[1:01:15] you if you're to go there you're gonna
[1:01:17] have to ask questions and things and
[1:01:19] things like that so you know how to
[1:01:22] protect yourself and survive right
[1:01:24] so there's the road but that's that's
[1:01:26] just a smooth part of it
[1:01:28] next slide
[1:01:32] okay
[1:01:34] you start seeing
[1:01:35] what's going on there and you can't
[1:01:38] really fully see it because you
[1:01:40] understand
[1:01:41] that vehicle
[1:01:43] is rocking
[1:01:45] it's going
[1:01:47] you know
[1:01:48] and it's no use you're saying on a dodge
[1:01:51] pothole
[1:01:52] because they are everywhere on on that
[1:01:55] road right
[1:01:57] amen
[1:01:58] next
[1:02:02] okay
[1:02:04] we are now
[1:02:06] at the camp
[1:02:08] that the brother the church is like two
[1:02:11] and a half miles in
[1:02:14] about let's say two miles
[1:02:16] and this
[1:02:17] camp
[1:02:19] is about four or five miles in
[1:02:24] next
[1:02:27] next slide
[1:02:30] it's got water tanks there for
[1:02:33] for water and those things are called
[1:02:36] water coconuts
[1:02:39] and
[1:02:40] next slide
[1:02:43] sister simon and i just drank these and
[1:02:46] then he split them open and
[1:02:49] got some spoons
[1:02:51] i wouldn't explain about cutting off the
[1:02:53] end and getting a piece and then
[1:02:55] scooping it out and whatnot but
[1:02:58] we at the white flesh you saw there it's
[1:03:00] soft and the water and that it's not
[1:03:03] water it's not just water it's sweet
[1:03:06] right because they pick it right off the
[1:03:08] tree and brought it to us
[1:03:10] nice i know you're feeling thirsty now
[1:03:12] that i'm talking
[1:03:15] next slide
[1:03:17] praise god
[1:03:18] there's the brother and there's the
[1:03:20] sister
[1:03:21] and there are two brothers that live
[1:03:26] right across from the church they live
[1:03:29] there on the farm there and the other
[1:03:32] one works cutting wood to
[1:03:35] make um coal
[1:03:37] right
[1:03:38] and so they keep an eye on the church
[1:03:41] and
[1:03:42] i mean the camp
[1:03:44] because one building in there is a
[1:03:46] little church building but it can no
[1:03:48] more hold
[1:03:49] when
[1:03:50] all the people go call people coming
[1:03:52] from trinidad
[1:03:54] people are coming from suriname
[1:03:56] people are coming from brazil
[1:03:59] people come from america
[1:04:01] um
[1:04:02] different parts of america and go down
[1:04:05] there
[1:04:06] and um
[1:04:08] you know
[1:04:09] participate praise the lord next
[1:04:13] praise god airmen join my coconut
[1:04:20] that's part of the yard there's a good
[1:04:23] scene
[1:04:24] you get an idea
[1:04:27] next
[1:04:28] there's a little building
[1:04:30] that they first built as
[1:04:34] a small church building
[1:04:36] but of course it's still there but
[1:04:39] they've outgrown it when
[1:04:41] you know the whole camp is filled and
[1:04:45] young people are
[1:04:47] tents are
[1:04:49] pegged there all around the place they
[1:04:51] usually tense and stuff of course
[1:04:54] brothers are there to patrol in the
[1:04:56] night and that sort of thing amen
[1:05:00] next
[1:05:03] this is a coconut tree
[1:05:06] that one i can climb
[1:05:09] you know why i say that because the real
[1:05:12] ones are way
[1:05:14] up
[1:05:17] next
[1:05:23] what
[1:05:26] next
[1:05:28] behind this assignment
[1:05:31] as you can see is a huge lake
[1:05:35] now that is what the scientists from all
[1:05:39] over the world germany britain different
[1:05:41] it's called a hot
[1:05:43] and cold lake
[1:05:45] and half of the lake is hot
[1:05:48] and you go in the next half and it's
[1:05:49] cold
[1:05:51] or
[1:05:52] your brother said you can be standing in
[1:05:54] the lake and the water is warm and nice
[1:05:57] and then all of a sudden
[1:06:00] freezing cold water
[1:06:03] right so the mystery of that is what the
[1:06:06] scientists are looking at but god give
[1:06:08] the young give i call him young man he's
[1:06:10] not a young man with grandson but
[1:06:16] vision and before the government could
[1:06:19] come to itself
[1:06:22] he bought up some of the land on the
[1:06:24] shores of that lake when nobody would
[1:06:26] hardly go there
[1:06:28] now they're encouraging tourists to go
[1:06:31] there
[1:06:32] and they are hurrying now to see if they
[1:06:34] can build a road to go there right like
[1:06:37] that so we thank god that he's a man not
[1:06:41] only preaching the gospel but thinking
[1:06:45] right greatly influenced by brother
[1:06:47] dionna raine ojar
[1:06:50] because
[1:06:51] he moved a lot with him uh when he was
[1:06:54] as a young young boy
[1:06:56] praise god next
[1:06:59] raise the lord
[1:07:03] the same is of the camp but you've seen
[1:07:05] the extent of the how big it is
[1:07:08] how much land surrounding it next
[1:07:16] there he is
[1:07:18] got a full picture of him
[1:07:21] and the sister
[1:07:24] next
[1:07:26] praise god we're fixing to leave
[1:07:30] now he says that vehicle that red one he
[1:07:32] has two of them that one is like an
[1:07:35] all-terrain
[1:07:36] vehicle the tires are made for
[1:07:40] you know the bush and stuff like that so
[1:07:44] he would not go in there with the with a
[1:07:47] real good vehicle because you know
[1:07:50] next
[1:07:52] oh we're back on the ferry again
[1:07:55] see i i left that picture of the truck
[1:07:58] so you can understand it's not a little
[1:08:01] boat
[1:08:03] it holds
[1:08:05] several of those and cars in it
[1:08:08] to cross over
[1:08:10] so
[1:08:11] little you or me being on it it's not
[1:08:13] much weight
[1:08:15] and then there's another upper floor
[1:08:17] with the canteen and chairs and stuff up
[1:08:20] there um for viewing
[1:08:22] next
[1:08:26] we're leaving
[1:08:30] back to
[1:08:32] we're still in lesser quibble but we're
[1:08:34] headed back
[1:08:40] all right we come over on the other side
[1:08:43] and we're coming off the ship
[1:08:46] that that's the front of the ship just
[1:08:49] goes like that
[1:08:51] right
[1:08:52] and hits the pier and then the cars are
[1:08:56] able to drive off
[1:08:59] so here we go
[1:09:00] next
[1:09:03] back to those
[1:09:05] locals making their living fishing
[1:09:08] transportation
[1:09:10] whatever else you know
[1:09:15] that's a that's the
[1:09:17] that's the ferry
[1:09:18] right there
[1:09:20] far away from it though
[1:09:23] now we are outside back on the street
[1:09:26] from the ferry
[1:09:27] and people of course got their wares
[1:09:30] everywhere trying to sell
[1:09:32] and hawk and
[1:09:34] call you and
[1:09:36] i have a cheaper and no
[1:09:38] my stuff is better quality and
[1:09:41] one
[1:09:42] right
[1:09:43] next
[1:09:46] oh the bank of nova scotia
[1:09:49] oh
[1:09:50] when i saw that as
[1:09:52] bank of nova scotia and the country
[1:09:56] spice kitchen oh
[1:09:58] my another restaurant there local
[1:10:03] next
[1:10:06] and that's the guyana bank
[1:10:10] republic bank they call it anyway next
[1:10:14] this that is in
[1:10:18] um the city called parika
[1:10:21] and i had preached there when i was like
[1:10:24] 18 years old
[1:10:26] and had a an indian family were
[1:10:29] converted
[1:10:30] and we were having meetings
[1:10:32] in there
[1:10:33] not many people maybe about five or ten
[1:10:37] and then afterwards i left and i never
[1:10:40] knew what happened
[1:10:41] but there's a church there now by the
[1:10:44] grace of god
[1:10:45] and
[1:10:47] next slide
[1:10:49] brother lee sitting there
[1:10:52] next slide
[1:10:53] and there is the pastor brother kusinat
[1:10:56] kusi not i should say but praise the
[1:10:59] lord next slide
[1:11:02] amen a real understanding of the message
[1:11:06] too
[1:11:07] not just preaching but he understands
[1:11:09] what i have been preaching what i
[1:11:11] understand
[1:11:12] they caught that same spirit amen
[1:11:16] and um
[1:11:19] if i might pause here a bit right look
[1:11:21] how time flies
[1:11:23] that um
[1:11:25] i always wondered why
[1:11:28] when there was a revival mini revival
[1:11:32] going on
[1:11:33] while i was there that lord will
[1:11:36] pick me up like philip and
[1:11:38] move move you in the middle
[1:11:42] but
[1:11:43] this brother max he didn't know he was
[1:11:44] explaining that to me but he was just
[1:11:46] talking and saying but brother you know
[1:11:48] it's so strange that
[1:11:50] when after you left
[1:11:53] most of those original brothers that
[1:11:56] were there
[1:11:58] they also left
[1:12:00] i didn't know that
[1:12:02] but they all left
[1:12:04] and the ones that didn't leave he said
[1:12:07] they all died
[1:12:09] so
[1:12:10] they were left
[1:12:12] with nobody to tell them anything
[1:12:16] and they got to go directly to god and
[1:12:19] the holy spirit and the bible and the
[1:12:20] message
[1:12:22] so what they have is not from me
[1:12:26] it's not from you it's not from anybody
[1:12:29] it's from the holy ghost
[1:12:32] amen
[1:12:33] but they're saying the same thing i have
[1:12:35] been preaching here
[1:12:37] even though we have not had contact
[1:12:39] whatsoever praise god hallelujah next
[1:12:46] is the pastor's wife there now he he has
[1:12:49] this
[1:12:52] he has this
[1:12:54] uh place that he's running and it's a
[1:12:56] lot of employees in there and stuff like
[1:12:59] that you know we praise god we're
[1:13:02] this uh this place is not his
[1:13:06] but this is a very wealthy man
[1:13:10] that put
[1:13:11] all his wealth in his hands like joseph
[1:13:15] and close his eyes he don't even worry
[1:13:18] and let him run it as a matter of fact
[1:13:21] that man
[1:13:22] allowed them
[1:13:24] give them permission build the church do
[1:13:26] whatever you want
[1:13:28] and
[1:13:29] that's what it is so
[1:13:31] but he is actually
[1:13:33] the boss there for everything that goes
[1:13:35] on all the trucking all of this all of
[1:13:37] that anyway
[1:13:39] praise the lord next
[1:13:43] oh we are back
[1:13:45] that's all seen in the hotel that's just
[1:13:47] a hotel kitchen
[1:13:50] next
[1:13:52] that's a scene from the hotel's window
[1:13:56] looking down
[1:13:59] you've got to pass the guard house that
[1:14:01] little blue
[1:14:02] circular building
[1:14:04] the security guards there
[1:14:06] and you can't even come to the hotel
[1:14:10] unless you go by them
[1:14:12] and
[1:14:13] the reason for that is also
[1:14:16] the there are a lot of conferences going
[1:14:18] on i met some canadians from bc that
[1:14:21] were having a conference there because
[1:14:23] of you know all the
[1:14:25] money that's coming in now everybody
[1:14:27] wants a piece of it
[1:14:28] so
[1:14:29] and the president is always there
[1:14:32] meeting delegates the vice president is
[1:14:34] always there me so there's always secret
[1:14:36] service there's policemen there's
[1:14:39] always uh there you might not be aware
[1:14:41] of it but they're always there day and
[1:14:43] night amen
[1:14:46] and that's why i actually chose that
[1:14:48] hotel to be honest because i'm going
[1:14:50] back the first time i don't know the
[1:14:52] conditions yet so i said let me go it
[1:14:56] might be a little bit expensive but let
[1:14:58] me go
[1:14:59] and
[1:15:00] use that and after i see how things are
[1:15:03] then i'll know how to
[1:15:05] really conduct myself but i don't want
[1:15:07] to you know i want her protected i don't
[1:15:09] want to endanger her in any way right
[1:15:12] okay this is a few government buildings
[1:15:15] nearby the hotel we took the pictures
[1:15:18] off
[1:15:20] with the river in the background
[1:15:24] praise the lord you understand me now
[1:15:26] brother anthony when i went to trinidad
[1:15:28] and
[1:15:29] and brother kedar says uh now we're
[1:15:32] gonna go up the river
[1:15:34] so i said where's the river
[1:15:38] because you know the river is not even
[1:15:40] the size of one of the creeks right
[1:15:44] right okay this is a mall
[1:15:46] and this is just the
[1:15:49] what's called food court
[1:15:51] in the mall built by
[1:15:53] you know trinidadians for rich guyanese
[1:15:56] who have the money to be able to do
[1:15:58] those things
[1:15:59] but they brought in
[1:16:01] trinidadian
[1:16:03] engineers and builders
[1:16:05] and this is just a food court now here
[1:16:07] is some of the local food next slide
[1:16:12] just hold that a bit there
[1:16:15] long enough until you feel your mouth
[1:16:18] dribbling one is duck and one is lamb
[1:16:22] mutton as you could see there look it's
[1:16:24] right in the front
[1:16:26] and chicken and so on there's different
[1:16:29] things there all right next
[1:16:36] take it easy take it easy
[1:16:42] okay
[1:16:43] i want you to see the size of the food
[1:16:45] court so you understand it's not just a
[1:16:47] little thing it's not as big as what we
[1:16:50] have but
[1:16:51] for them that is
[1:16:53] huge
[1:16:54] next
[1:16:57] back to church
[1:16:59] and
[1:17:00] um i believe this is
[1:17:03] now i know the last sunday

[1:17:10] this young man i can't
[1:17:12] we can't bring him up closer
[1:17:15] but
[1:17:16] he is the son
[1:17:18] of a
[1:17:19] lady i knew
[1:17:22] that never
[1:17:23] married till she's about

[1:17:33] met one of the brothers there and he had
[1:17:35] a school
[1:17:36] on himself
[1:17:38] and she had her school in another part
[1:17:41] of the country but anyway they met and
[1:17:43] stuff like that but i was able to meet
[1:17:45] him and be introduced to him

[1:18:13] they're not inside of the building
[1:18:16] they had to make like a shed above their
[1:18:19] outside to be able to hold
[1:18:22] the people
[1:18:23] this young man
[1:18:26] that's sitting in the front
[1:18:28] he is the son
