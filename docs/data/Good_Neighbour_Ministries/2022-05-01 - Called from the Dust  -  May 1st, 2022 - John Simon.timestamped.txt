[30:24] he's somebody that uh deals with
[30:26] satellites and all kinds of stuff but he
[30:29] is
[30:30] we both drove all the way along with
[30:33] francois lippy from switzerland
[30:37] we were just young men and we drove a
[30:40] truck with all this stuff inside
[30:43] and we drove it all the way up to
[30:45] edmonton there
[30:48] and
[30:49] when we drove up brother
[30:51] we drove right up from arizona right
[30:53] through the whole us
[30:55] um
[30:56] from bottom right up to the top
[30:58] and um
[31:00] brother perry green flew
[31:02] in after we got there
[31:06] but
[31:07] before he could
[31:09] talk to any of them and introduce me and
[31:11] say well look there's a young minister
[31:13] whatever
[31:14] a funeral he got a sudden call and he
[31:16] had to go back
[31:18] really fast
[31:20] so he just turned around got on a plane
[31:22] and
[31:23] took off so we were left there
[31:25] and so i
[31:27] just began helping to put up the tent
[31:30] on the shores of lake edmonton where
[31:32] they were going to have the meeting
[31:34] and
[31:35] their
[31:36] brother don babblitz i met there
[31:39] um and we were
[31:42] helping with this tent all together and
[31:44] i got to meet the brother hildebrandt at
[31:47] that time you know
[31:49] in the
[31:50] pink of his life strength and youth and
[31:53] everything else you know a little older
[31:55] than myself but uh he was just a man of
[31:59] vigor and vision
[32:01] and god used him in a mighty way we want
[32:04] to thank god that
[32:06] he
[32:07] is an apostle to africa
[32:11] for god used him
[32:14] to raise up and to assist
[32:18] brothers that were raising up churches
[32:20] in all almost every single country in
[32:24] africa
[32:25] has been touched by his life
[32:28] and
[32:29] by his
[32:31] financial support
[32:34] and i'm not talking about uh
[32:37] ten dollars here fifty dollars there i'm
[32:39] talking about hundreds of thousands if
[32:41] not millions of dollars
[32:44] uh going out from the church in edmonton
[32:49] starting all these great works
[32:52] i also i'm not going to make this much
[32:54] longer also had the opportunity of
[32:56] ministering also with him in africa
[33:01] and we had marvelous wonderful meetings
[33:05] in malawi
[33:08] and other places we thank the lord for
[33:10] that
[33:12] i've also was able to minister in the
[33:14] church here
[33:16] a blessed god for him
[33:18] and the faithful ministry that he has
[33:20] had
[33:21] and the millions of
[33:24] believers that are beneficiaries of
[33:28] the great work that he has done
[33:31] may the lord rest his soul
[33:39] [Applause]
[33:41] of course he was a very jovial man
[33:44] as a man very jovial
[33:47] always as a minister uh you know making
[33:50] a lot of nice jokes with his friends and
[33:53] like that very light he never carried a
[33:56] heavy ministerial atmosphere
[33:59] that will intimidate people it was
[34:02] always outgoing
[34:04] and as a husband um he was a very
[34:09] uh feeling supporting
[34:12] a man that god made him to be a blessing
[34:15] to his
[34:16] entire family
[34:18] praise the lord
[34:20] uh god god really blessed him in every
[34:23] way as a man as a minister as a husband
[34:27] as a servant of god very surrendered to
[34:30] god and to his perfect divine will
[34:34] i um
[34:36] i i thank god i have a belief
[34:39] one or two of his messages that he
[34:41] preached
[34:42] some of them are classics
[34:45] that are
[34:47] desired by ministers all around the
[34:49] world and i've heard ministers quoting
[34:51] from some of his
[34:53] his messages that he has preached that
[34:55] god used him in a wonderful way and we
[34:59] thank god for that the last time i saw
[35:01] him
[35:02] was when i was passing through
[35:05] edmonton just about
[35:08] two years ago
[35:10] and preached in the church
[35:13] and i was preaching on abel um
[35:16] abel or having the revelation of god how
[35:19] revelation comes not by the written word
[35:22] but by the logos of god amen because
[35:26] abel had no bible he had nothing but how
[35:29] did he know right that it wasn't a fish
[35:31] or a horse but he knew directly that it
[35:34] was a lamb so it had to be revealed and
[35:37] he was just
[35:39] shouting and jumping up the best he
[35:41] could at the but the time and rejoicing
[35:44] and they were looking at him strange
[35:46] because they were what he's he's
[35:48] supposed to be this a great older
[35:50] minister and he's jumping up so
[35:53] but he knows what he was seeing
[35:57] and he knows why he was rejoicing like
[35:59] that and i thank god for him
[36:02] and his wife who now remains who are
[36:06] behind with the children
[36:08] god bless her heart she's been faithful
[36:12] she's been true she's been strong
[36:15] under various uh pressures
[36:18] and we are so happy that god has helped
[36:21] them both to overcome
[36:24] and so they are a testimony to the
[36:27] entire bride
[36:29] of jesus christ
[36:31] to god be the glory
[36:33] shall we stand just for a moment of
[36:36] silence
[36:37] for another soldier has gone home
[37:08] god
[37:09] rest his gallant soul
[37:11] as brother branham would say
[37:14] god bless you
[37:16] and now we will turn our attention
[37:19] to the word of god
[37:23] we will look into genesis
[37:26] chapter 3
[37:28] verse 17
[37:32] to 19.
[37:46] and now that you have found it
[37:49] let us read out of the word of god
[37:54] and unto adam he said
[37:57] because thou has heartened unto the
[38:00] voice of thy wife
[38:02] and has eaten of the tree of which i
[38:06] commanded thee saying
[38:09] thou shalt not eat of it curses the
[38:12] ground for thy sake
[38:14] in sorrow shalt thou eat
[38:17] of it all the days of thy life thorns
[38:20] also and sisles shall it bring forth to
[38:24] thee
[38:25] and thou
[38:26] shalt eat the herb of the field praise
[38:30] god in the sweat of thy face thou shalt
[38:35] eat bread
[38:36] and now this is the foundation of what i
[38:40] will speak on
[38:41] till thou return onto the ground
[38:46] for out of it
[38:48] was thou taken
[38:51] for dust thou art
[38:55] and unto dust
[38:57] shalt thou
[38:59] return
[39:00] may god bless us here today father we
[39:03] thank you for the reading of thy word
[39:06] and we ask that the great holy spirit
[39:08] will minister to us
[39:11] everyone individually
[39:13] that portion that we need
[39:16] that will lift us up lord
[39:18] break all the shackles from around us
[39:22] take away
[39:23] every
[39:24] contrary
[39:26] spirit lord that may lurk around us
[39:31] let all the darkness disappear
[39:35] and let the sun shine in
[39:38] as we surrender ourselves
[39:41] into thy hands
[39:43] for divine service to thee be the glory
[39:46] and the honor and the praise father
[39:49] in jesus name amen amen god bless you
[39:57] now in this book of
[40:00] genesis
[40:01] chapter 13
[40:04] verses 14 to 16
[40:07] god
[40:08] told abraham
[40:12] that your seed shall be like the dust of
[40:15] the earth
[40:17] they're going to be numberless like the
[40:20] dust of the earth
[40:23] of course you know abraham
[40:26] was a type of god or that god was typing
[40:29] himself
[40:31] in
[40:32] the character of abraham
[40:36] so when he was speaking and saying
[40:38] abraham i promise you
[40:41] that your children will be a number less
[40:44] like the dust of the earth
[40:47] he was speaking about his seed
[40:50] because the natural seed of abraham
[40:52] speaks of
[40:54] the royal seed of abraham which is the
[40:58] seed of god
[41:00] and then
[41:02] in genesis
[41:04] 15
[41:05] 5 to 6
[41:08] god declares that those same seeds that
[41:12] will be as the dust of the earth
[41:15] he said to abraham
[41:17] i will take them from the dust to the
[41:20] stars
[41:22] they'll be numberless like the stars of
[41:24] heaven
[41:25] praise god
[41:27] so here these seeds
[41:30] that are of the dust are going to go
[41:32] from the dust back to the stars
[41:35] amen praise god
[41:37] hallelujah
[41:39] first timothy 2 12
[41:42] and 13
[41:43] you know
[41:45] that jesus came as a man
[41:48] in other words he came as dust
[41:51] himself
[41:53] and there
[41:54] later
[41:56] we know
[41:57] he shows
[41:58] and displays
[42:00] our pathway
[42:02] he who came as man as flesh as dust
[42:07] went right back
[42:08] to the stars where he came from through
[42:11] his divine
[42:13] ascension amen
[42:15] hallelujah
[42:16] oh praise god
[42:18] so we must do the same
[42:21] because just as much as eve came out of
[42:25] adam
[42:26] then
[42:28] and how his wife came from him
[42:31] so jesus went to
[42:33] calvary or golgotha really
[42:37] so that his wife could be taken from his
[42:40] side
[42:42] but understand clearly
[42:44] before he went to galgata she was still
[42:48] in him
[42:50] she was still in him
[42:52] and we will talk about that as we go
[42:55] along
[42:56] now i i cannot and will not complete
[42:59] this message here today
[43:01] um but i will speak on it as much as i
[43:05] can without
[43:07] trying to rush it along so that i can
[43:10] finish the entire text it's more
[43:12] important that you receive the truth
[43:16] of the word
[43:17] rather than me finishing what i have
[43:20] here i will let the lord determine that
[43:23] and with that my eyes on the time and
[43:27] the time of this holy spirit uh then i
[43:30] will conclude it but for now let's just
[43:33] talk about this for a while
[43:35] let's talk about the subject of
[43:38] called from the dust
[43:40] and this is the season where we are
[43:42] being called from the dust
[43:45] right because jesus came into this flesh
[43:49] which is dust
[43:50] and went back where he come from
[43:54] now
[43:56] uh that was all prophecy of course
[43:58] promise and prophecy
[44:01] but we want to
[44:04] uh talk about the prophet of malachi 4 5
[44:08] because we know
[44:10] that under the first and the second poll
[44:13] that he said a lot of things
[44:16] before the opening of those seals how
[44:19] many knows that
[44:22] praise god
[44:23] and what he has said
[44:26] confused and still confuses
[44:29] a lot of people
[44:32] they're still confused to this very day
[44:36] while we are here they're confused of
[44:38] things that he has said
[44:41] but
[44:42] it was for a reason
[44:46] as he himself said you know the quote
[44:48] unveiling of the mighty god that some
[44:50] might go out some may come in some may
[44:52] be confused some may wonder
[44:55] right it was done all for a reason
[44:59] it doesn't mean that he was consciously
[45:02] putting out these things to confuse
[45:04] people
[45:06] but the holy spirit in him was causing
[45:10] him to act do and say certain things
[45:13] like that
[45:14] to confuse the minds of
[45:18] the devil
[45:21] right uh the enemy who was watching
[45:25] waiting whispering searching every way
[45:28] if the princes of this world knew see
[45:31] trying to find out what god's redemptive
[45:35] plan was all about
[45:37] so god had to hide it
[45:41] from the wise and prudent
[45:44] and reveal it only to those
[45:47] that were willing to learn not just
[45:51] naturally spiritually
[45:53] they're going to learn after they come
[45:55] out of their amnesia where they come
[45:57] from and how to get back to the will and
[46:00] purpose and plan of the living god amen
[46:05] so it was for a reason listen to brother
[46:07] branham speaking here out of the message
[46:10] feast of the trumpets
[46:12] one day i was up in sabino canyon
[46:15] and while up there
[46:18] i stood there
[46:20] praying and a sword came into my hands
[46:25] it was just natural
[46:27] as my hand is
[46:29] and there it was
[46:31] not knowing what it meant
[46:34] and then i heard a voice saying this is
[46:37] the king's sword
[46:40] then later when the angel of the lord
[46:44] revealed
[46:46] it was the word that was put in
[46:50] my hand it was the word
[46:53] for the age for the elect that was now
[46:56] put in his hand
[46:58] hallelujah
[47:00] now he said immediately after the angels
[47:02] of the lord appeared and told me of the
[47:06] seven seals and i was to return back to
[47:09] jeffersonville
[47:11] and to preach those seven seals
[47:15] let me say this i have never said
[47:18] anything
[47:20] that was
[47:21] this
[47:22] inspired it was in that
[47:26] where the angel of the lord met us
[47:32] and then the
[47:34] entire bible opened up and become a new
[47:39] bible to me
[47:42] and there it opened up
[47:44] when it re opened up revealed all the
[47:48] things the reformers had left out
[47:52] it was the complete revelation
[47:56] of jesus christ
[47:58] all together new to us
[48:01] but perfectly exactly with the
[48:03] scriptures
[48:05] that was the word
[48:07] which has always been
[48:11] hallelujah but now being inspired and
[48:14] directed for what the restoration of the
[48:18] bride tree amen the word came to him
[48:22] that the bright tree might be restored
[48:26] oh hallelujah oh praise god now let's
[48:29] get into some things here i am just
[48:32] excited like a kid ready to eat
[48:34] chocolate as much as you
[48:37] now
[48:39] listen carefully we see
[48:42] the attribute sons
[48:45] of the spirit
[48:47] have not yet entered into their word
[48:51] form body
[48:54] a theophany
[48:56] this body
[48:58] is one subject to the word
[49:02] and in earnest
[49:05] waiting for the earnest
[49:08] change of the body
[49:11] amen you see on look
[49:14] i tell you i can't finish today because
[49:16] change of the body we're taking
[49:20] just of this body here changing
[49:23] not understanding these talking they're
[49:25] waiting for the change of the body
[49:27] moving from this to that
[49:30] right that's the change of the body he's
[49:33] talking about
[49:34] not this body here changing
[49:38] but changing out of this body
[49:41] changing your body and going into that
[49:43] one that's why he's saying here them
[49:46] attribute sons of the spirit
[49:50] the eternal spirit
[49:51] the elohim spirit
[49:54] hallelujah see oh my
[49:57] you see they have not yet yet entered
[50:01] into that ward form body as yet
[50:05] that theophany
[50:07] this body that body is subject to the
[50:11] word
[50:12] they are waiting for the earnest
[50:16] the change
[50:17] of the body
[50:19] amen but if you don't have this
[50:21] revelation you wouldn't understand that
[50:24] he's talking they're waiting on the time
[50:26] when they're gonna move from this one
[50:28] moving day when they're gonna move out
[50:30] of this one into that one and you don't
[50:32] necessarily have to die because paul
[50:34] made it plain some of us gonna be alive
[50:38] hallelujah but if you're dead you're
[50:40] still going to be changed
[50:41] but if you're alive you shall be changed
[50:45] you're changed you're caught up by the
[50:47] spirit of the living god
[50:50] oh
[50:50] my praise god can we be alive
[50:54] and and still be inspired and operating
[50:58] from the leadership preeminence and
[51:00] point of view of our
[51:03] theophany body with which we have
[51:06] already come in contact by a revelation
[51:09] of the holy spirit that god will be able
[51:12] to use you praise god not of your own
[51:15] thinking of your own will but when you
[51:18] are not even thinking are you not even
[51:20] anything whatsoever
[51:22] unconscious godliness strikes your soul
[51:25] moves you out and around you know
[51:27] nothing about when you come back to
[51:30] yourself in a moment of time you wonder
[51:32] what did i say what did i do what
[51:34] happened there what happened here what
[51:35] happened there it's not you that live
[51:38] but christ that lives within us
[51:40] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[51:43] lord you see
[51:45] now
[51:47] we are different there's a difference
[51:50] between him and you
[51:53] praise god you know you he says when you
[51:58] caught the revelation of the word the
[52:01] true revelation of the word
[52:03] you have come in contact or heard from
[52:07] your theophany
[52:10] is that right
[52:11] so every single one of us that's a true
[52:14] believer
[52:15] who has really caught the revelation of
[52:18] the word opened up a new world
[52:22] right
[52:23] you are actually
[52:25] getting inspiration for your theophany
[52:28] but because another place he says your
[52:30] theophany is really part of the holy
[52:33] spirit it's the holy spirit is your
[52:35] theophany
[52:36] right and that portion they got pieces
[52:39] pieces pieces but but that part that is
[52:42] your part
[52:44] that part that is inspiring you now
[52:47] leading and guiding you now
[52:49] hallelujah that's how you are led by the
[52:51] pillar of fire not the bread big old
[52:54] pillar of fire but that same portion
[52:56] each one of them god leads them
[53:00] and guides them whatever they do by the
[53:02] spirit of god
[53:05] so
[53:06] don't make up yourself like you're super
[53:09] spiritual and you you're going to do
[53:11] this you're going to do that you just
[53:13] need to relax and be yourself and live
[53:16] the way god wants you to live so that
[53:19] the holy spirit of almighty god might
[53:22] direct your steps might order your steps
[53:25] that you might be sons and daughters of
[53:27] god led by the spirit of almighty god
[53:31] hallelujah not by our
[53:34] because we want to be holy because we
[53:37] want to be recognized because we want to
[53:39] be real no not our will no more not of
[53:44] the will of man
[53:46] not of the will of anybody not of any
[53:48] religious person but by the will of god
[53:51] and by the blood of christ hallelujah
[53:54] amen this is happening the difference
[53:56] between him and you as sons
[54:01] see
[54:02] he was at the beginning
[54:07] already the word
[54:10] he was the word
[54:12] but we know the the word the word not a
[54:15] word the word was god
[54:19] right he was
[54:21] in the beginning the word
[54:24] he was in an and morphe body
[54:28] a body that he himself
[54:30] brought right transformed brought
[54:33] hallelujah it came that end morphe body
[54:37] it came and lived he came and lived in
[54:41] that
[54:42] in the person
[54:44] called mel cassidy
[54:47] then later
[54:50] as you know the process and morphine and
[54:52] morphed changing from glory to glory
[54:55] we never heard suddenly no more of
[54:57] melchizedek you never heard that he died
[55:00] on the bury him you never heard nothing
[55:02] melchizedek seems to just disappear
[55:07] but we became
[55:09] aware
[55:11] of jesus
[55:13] for he
[55:15] melchizedek
[55:17] became christ
[55:20] melchizedek was the priest
[55:23] but now he became jesus christ
[55:26] praise god hallelujah
[55:29] oh
[55:30] priests redeem us savior and king oh my
[55:34] lord now
[55:35] you see now
[55:37] you bypass that
[55:40] you and i bypass that
[55:43] because in that form
[55:46] he still knowed all things even though
[55:50] he was in that
[55:53] form or in morphe as melchizedek he knew
[55:57] all things see
[56:00] because he was in that form
[56:02] and you now and i have never been able
[56:08] to know that
[56:10] then hear how he says it at the end
[56:13] yet
[56:15] right
[56:16] you haven't
[56:18] gotten to know that yet
[56:21] so you're going to go back to that state
[56:24] and condition
[56:26] sometime now or in the future
[56:29] where you're going to be just like him
[56:32] knowing all things as a conscious aware
[56:37] part of god that has lost all the
[56:40] spiritual amnesia that we suffered when
[56:43] we come down here by the grace of god
[56:46] hallelujah oh my praise god hallelujah
[56:52] oh my now we know the opening of the
[56:55] word
[56:57] just like when it opened up
[56:59] in
[57:00] uh matthew
[57:01] it corrected the church
[57:04] it corrected its own mother
[57:06] uh that it came out from
[57:09] you know it was only young but yet it
[57:12] corrected the mother
[57:14] right now in us as believers it's doing
[57:16] the same thing
[57:18] and when the prophet came on the scene
[57:21] on the malachi 4 5
[57:23] and i told you
[57:25] that uh and you know it under the first
[57:28] and the second pull he said and did a
[57:32] lot of things
[57:34] um uh without um complete understanding
[57:38] because he himself hadn't come into he
[57:40] had to grow even in his life and
[57:42] ministry and he hadn't come into all of
[57:45] this so he was saying all kinds of
[57:49] different
[57:50] different things amen
[57:52] but once that
[57:54] uh
[57:55] bible become a new bible by revelation
[57:59] then
[58:00] his teaching and his understanding
[58:03] changed
[58:05] and
[58:06] when it changed
[58:08] the glory days of the first ball
[58:11] and the second pull
[58:14] he started to bring
[58:16] not forceful and second full teaching
[58:18] which was glorious and wonderful
[58:21] but the glory of the latter house was
[58:24] greater than the former
[58:26] house
[58:27] you know we live in a house so so the
[58:30] glory of his latter house was greater
[58:34] than the former house
[58:36] because now he was teaching and
[58:39] preaching
[58:40] and inspiring
[58:42] oh praise god from under that third pole
[58:46] oh amen hallelujah which we know
[58:51] that the third paul ministry and
[58:54] revelation
[58:56] took him
[58:57] one octave higher
[58:59] it took it
[59:00] is taking us
[59:02] an octave higher
[59:04] it is lifting us on a higher into a
[59:07] higher dimension
[59:09] a higher realm of revelation and
[59:12] understanding
[59:13] oh yet so simple
[59:16] that many bypasses it
[59:19] praise god look i know god built me in
[59:22] certain ways where i do certain things
[59:24] say certain things and sometimes i can't
[59:27] see a thing because god is doing it
[59:29] through me or with me and whatever and
[59:32] it's causing such reactions and certain
[59:34] people and everything but it's for him
[59:37] not for me it's not for me but for him
[59:40] i can't say well oh
[59:42] don't do that don't say that because
[59:45] this
[59:46] it sounds almost sometimes like i'm
[59:49] wishing some people bad
[59:52] but it's not me wishing anybody anything
[59:56] bad
[59:57] the word says certain thing if you do
[59:59] certain thing you say certain things
[1:00:01] this is going to be the reaction
[1:00:04] so when you when i turn run i say that
[1:00:08] then it looks like you are criticizing a
[1:00:11] church criticizing a denomination or
[1:00:13] you're saying something against somebody
[1:00:16] but it's not that it's the word itself
[1:00:20] that's doing that
[1:00:21] hallelujah that's what they were telling
[1:00:23] him when he was here you were
[1:00:25] criticizing the priest he criticizing
[1:00:26] the tabernacle you're criticizing moses
[1:00:29] law this that the other you're talking
[1:00:31] out against everybody else you must
[1:00:33] think you were the only one right at all
[1:00:36] this is what happens
[1:00:38] and god does that on one side and but he
[1:00:41] does it on the other side to humble you
[1:00:44] to break you down because you gotta shut
[1:00:46] up you gotta stand everything take
[1:00:48] everything swallow everything and uh
[1:00:51] open up your mouth and just go on for
[1:00:54] the glory of god hallelujah amen but now
[1:00:59] it's gone one octave higher
[1:01:01] praise god
[1:01:03] which means the attraction has gone away
[1:01:06] from the gifts
[1:01:08] of power gifts of power that god gave
[1:01:12] but the attraction has gone away from
[1:01:15] the gifts of power
[1:01:17] hallelujah
[1:01:18] the attractions has gone away from the
[1:01:21] discernment
[1:01:22] it's gone away from just visions
[1:01:26] it's gone away even from prophecy
[1:01:29] the devil made sure that he moved in
[1:01:32] whole bunches of so-called prophets
[1:01:35] bunches of people that screamed they're
[1:01:37] seeing this and seeing that and having
[1:01:39] visions of the new world war and this
[1:01:42] and the other all kinds of people
[1:01:45] claiming to have discernment and
[1:01:47] everything else trying to create chaos
[1:01:49] and confusion with god's plan for the
[1:01:52] end time
[1:01:54] oh my but god already moved on from that
[1:01:58] and leave him to play around in the
[1:01:59] sandbox while god has moved on to the
[1:02:04] perfection of the world
[1:02:07] and the attraction to the true bright
[1:02:10] believer is to the word the plain simple
[1:02:15] word
[1:02:17] isn't the track them what what they
[1:02:19] don't see nothing what's there you see
[1:02:22] if you look the types and you see is it
[1:02:25] rebecca
[1:02:26] when uh eliezer went to her and gave her
[1:02:30] all them gifts of diamonds and gold and
[1:02:34] rubies and pearls and everything else
[1:02:37] and when she he she asked him about the
[1:02:40] bridegroom and he started talking about
[1:02:42] isaac and the bible said she took all
[1:02:44] the jewels and give them to her cousins
[1:02:46] and friends who and she's done listening
[1:02:49] to him
[1:02:50] she accepting words from
[1:02:53] a prophet from a messenger
[1:02:56] rather than grabbing all them jewels and
[1:02:59] holding them
[1:03:01] you can't help it women like jewels
[1:03:06] they love jewels and these churches they
[1:03:09] love jewels
[1:03:11] they love the gifts they love all them
[1:03:13] shiny sparkly monkey business stuff
[1:03:16] they just love it
[1:03:18] oh my and they cooperated but not her
[1:03:22] sheep gave them away to them and kept
[1:03:25] your eyes on eliasa and listened to what
[1:03:29] he was saying about the bridegroom
[1:03:33] that's what the church needs today
[1:03:35] keep your eyes on jesus keep your heart
[1:03:38] on jesus keep your love for jesus keep
[1:03:42] your desire for him hallelujah she
[1:03:45] hadn't even seen him yet
[1:03:47] amen oh praise god have you seen him you
[1:03:51] you haven't seen him yet you only see
[1:03:53] him by understanding through the word
[1:03:55] but a prophet came and say one day the
[1:03:58] one you feel in your heart will come
[1:04:01] personalized right before your praise
[1:04:03] god hallelujah oh
[1:04:06] you'll see him face to face and tell the
[1:04:08] story save my grace oh praise god
[1:04:12] hallelujah amen
[1:04:14] yes sir
[1:04:15] so
[1:04:16] praise god so
[1:04:18] he started teaching
[1:04:20] the third poll
[1:04:22] but you must understand for a second
[1:04:25] pull
[1:04:26] that can go out to all peoples
[1:04:28] everywhere
[1:04:30] but the third pole
[1:04:32] was towards abraham's royal seed
[1:04:36] that was hidden up all among this dust
[1:04:40] did all in the dust everywhere
[1:04:44] and so
[1:04:45] that was to them
[1:04:48] remember now
[1:04:51] you didn't come like him
[1:04:54] because you know he came
[1:04:56] with that and morphed body knowing all
[1:04:59] things
[1:05:00] but
[1:05:01] you come like adam
[1:05:03] you come like me
[1:05:06] you came from the attribute
[1:05:10] but you went right to flesh
[1:05:13] not to the and morphe theophany body
[1:05:18] he said you came from that attribute
[1:05:21] there
[1:05:22] right to the flesh
[1:05:25] hallelujah
[1:05:27] and
[1:05:28] that saw
[1:05:30] you could be tempted
[1:05:33] god way before had his desire to be a
[1:05:35] savior and a redeemer
[1:05:37] all right
[1:05:38] he already ha as a father you have sons
[1:05:43] but now he wants to be redeemer he loves
[1:05:46] all these things
[1:05:47] and
[1:05:49] he wants to do it in people like you and
[1:05:51] me
[1:05:53] he displayed in job
[1:05:55] make him sick
[1:05:56] and he still encouraged god
[1:05:59] bring him trials
[1:06:01] and he still didn't get rid of god uh
[1:06:04] break up his business
[1:06:06] this big trucking empire that he had
[1:06:08] with camels and stuff moving things
[1:06:10] across the desert god break the whole
[1:06:12] thing up
[1:06:13] and he still bless god hallelujah glory
[1:06:16] to god amen
[1:06:18] a real type of the believer the elect
[1:06:21] believer what they will be like when
[1:06:25] they get here to the end what shape and
[1:06:28] form they're supposed to be displaying
[1:06:30] so they can be identified
[1:06:32] praise god no matter what
[1:06:36] amen even if he's slay me he says i'll
[1:06:39] still trust him
[1:06:41] i'll still believe his word in every
[1:06:44] possible way so but you see you come
[1:06:47] like adam you come like me
[1:06:50] you come down from that attribute to the
[1:06:54] flesh
[1:06:55] to be tempted
[1:06:57] see
[1:06:58] amen so
[1:07:00] now you let me give you a picture now
[1:07:03] the point is
[1:07:05] that there is god
[1:07:07] with all his sons his daughters his
[1:07:10] children in him
[1:07:12] his attributes
[1:07:14] in him his genes in him they're all in
[1:07:17] him
[1:07:19] and there they were fellowshipping and
[1:07:22] rejoicing with god in every possible way
[1:07:27] so we come from being in
[1:07:29] elohim
[1:07:31] that's why the word is plural
[1:07:33] it's not singular but it's plural yet
[1:07:37] speaking of one person yet it's a plural
[1:07:39] word because we were all in him
[1:07:43] right oh my oh thanks be to god
[1:07:47] we were in that great eternal spirit as
[1:07:50] part of it we won't even discuss why you
[1:07:53] know you are eternal already even though
[1:07:55] you're not fully aware and conscious of
[1:07:57] what that means we know according to
[1:08:00] this word that we are eternal as a part
[1:08:03] of him
[1:08:04] and you had to leave
[1:08:07] for him to be the savior now he had to
[1:08:10] have
[1:08:11] somebody or something he could rely on
[1:08:14] that when he sent it down here you have
[1:08:16] confidence that if he make it sick if he
[1:08:18] do this if he does that to it if he do
[1:08:21] that to it do that to it doesn't matter
[1:08:23] it's not going to curse him it's not
[1:08:24] going to do that to him it's going to go
[1:08:27] through the entire cycle of life and go
[1:08:30] right back where it comes from
[1:08:32] and god chose you god chose me that god
[1:08:35] places confidence in you that you're
[1:08:38] going to be one of them that will ride
[1:08:40] the tides of time and return back into
[1:08:43] the presence of your heavenly father
[1:08:46] amen praise god
[1:08:49] so
[1:08:50] he moved you
[1:08:52] and i from being attribute sons you can
[1:08:56] never stop to be that
[1:08:58] but he put the attribute sons
[1:09:00] down into flesh
[1:09:03] and they become flesh man
[1:09:07] now remember that inside
[1:09:09] gene
[1:09:10] attribute that ain't changed one iota
[1:09:15] but outside the facade
[1:09:18] that they're wearing is a flesh man like
[1:09:21] everybody else
[1:09:23] but everybody else doesn't know
[1:09:26] that
[1:09:27] these
[1:09:28] uh have an eternal element an ingredient
[1:09:31] in them
[1:09:32] and the devil don't know who is who or
[1:09:35] what is what either
[1:09:37] that that is
[1:09:39] somebody that he really can't kill
[1:09:42] right uh in the sense
[1:09:44] like the prophet said here about jesus
[1:09:47] how are you going to kill god
[1:09:49] god
[1:09:50] death cannot kill god
[1:09:53] amen and he knew death couldn't kill him
[1:09:56] that's why he said i rise again in three
[1:09:58] days what are you going to do about it
[1:10:00] see they can't do anything about it and
[1:10:02] we are a part of him
[1:10:04] and so we know death can't really kill
[1:10:07] us
[1:10:08] it will kill off what it produced
[1:10:11] it'll kill back off this flesh man
[1:10:15] but we only come into this realm and
[1:10:18] this flesh man to use it that god might
[1:10:22] go proving his word
[1:10:26] that he might show forth his glory
[1:10:29] and his power
[1:10:31] and we are a part of that great
[1:10:33] undertaking right now
[1:10:37] when this life is finished
[1:10:40] but when this life is finished
[1:10:43] after that attribute has been tempted
[1:10:46] trying tested whatever else he said when
[1:10:49] that life is finished here
[1:10:53] remember you have a promise
[1:10:56] if this
[1:10:58] this earthly tabernacle
[1:11:01] that you're wearing now
[1:11:03] be dissolved
[1:11:05] remember your teopony you have another
[1:11:08] one waiting
[1:11:10] you got another one waiting
[1:11:12] right
[1:11:13] then jesus a body has now prepared me
[1:11:18] praise god hallelujah we have the same
[1:11:21] thing we have a prepared body that we're
[1:11:25] going to that's why we preached the
[1:11:26] other week on believers
[1:11:29] have another body
[1:11:32] you leave this one you go to that one
[1:11:35] all you're doing is the body change
[1:11:38] all you're doing is changing bodies
[1:11:42] from one to the other you understand
[1:11:44] what i'm saying about the body change
[1:11:47] what it really is oh praise god
[1:11:50] hallelujah we have another one that's
[1:11:53] there
[1:11:54] already waiting
[1:11:56] praise god uh to go back with all the
[1:12:00] word the revelation that the inspiration

[1:12:04] with it and you know it's real it's just
[1:12:06] waiting to receive you praise god that's
[1:12:11] where you go to

[1:12:19] hallelujah the word
[1:12:23] you're going back to the original when
[1:12:25] it was all word
[1:12:27] and go back to your position in that
[1:12:30] word
[1:12:31] praise god
[1:12:33] then
[1:12:34] hallelujah
[1:12:36] when
[1:12:37] you go back like that
[1:12:39] you can now look back and see
[1:12:43] all them things that we've done and
[1:12:45] whatever else now you're going to
[1:12:47] understand even why some of the things
[1:12:49] you've done and and why i've done this
[1:12:51] and why i'd run that you know you never
[1:12:53] could understand why i act that way why
[1:12:55] say this why did that why did that why
[1:12:57] didn't i you see but he says when you go
[1:13:00] back it's just like the seals uh

[1:13:08] god not only break this seven seals but
[1:13:11] he broke the seals on your life
[1:13:16] and the seals were broken what happened
[1:13:20] the church could look back now
[1:13:22] and see where it come from and the
[1:13:25] history of it right on up to this time
[1:13:28] and from there they shouldn't they
[1:13:30] should know how to act
[1:13:33] to for the rest of the journey that
[1:13:35] might take the trip
[1:13:36] with the bright room
[1:13:39] the really let when the seals are
[1:13:42] brought from across your life hallelujah
[1:13:45] god allows you to look back on
[1:13:48] everything
[1:13:50] how he protected you some of the evil
[1:13:52] you've done some of the right things
[1:13:54] you've done some of this some of that
[1:13:55] whatever ways of thinking those things
[1:13:58] are coming off of your mind of your life
[1:14:01] everywhere delivered by the power of god
[1:14:04] and the holy spirit allows you to look
[1:14:06] back he says and see
[1:14:09] understand
[1:14:11] and see

[1:14:20] oh my we have never
[1:14:24] become the word you never become the
[1:14:27] word
[1:14:28] whoever you have become the word
[1:14:30] oh no because you always were the word
[1:14:34] right so you say we never become the
[1:14:37] word see
[1:14:39] oh my
[1:14:40] no what we become flesh man
[1:14:45] not the word
[1:14:47] look
[1:14:48] you will never be the word
[1:14:51] unless you was a thought in him before
[1:14:54] the beginning
[1:14:57] amen
[1:14:58] that proves the predestination of god
[1:15:03] you can't be the word unless you were
[1:15:07] his thought you are a thought of god see
[1:15:11] you had to be in his thinking first
[1:15:14] praise god
[1:15:16] now
[1:15:17] you see what you see in order to stand
[1:15:20] temptation
[1:15:22] he had to let you bypass that theophany
[1:15:27] is that right
[1:15:30] you had to come down here
[1:15:33] and be in this flesh
[1:15:35] praise god
[1:15:37] oh my
[1:15:39] oh praise god to be tempted
[1:15:42] by sin

[1:15:53] to me
[1:15:54] the word
[1:15:56] and i'll raise him up
[1:15:59] at the last day hallelujah so you see
[1:16:04] you had to be the first
[1:16:07] to be raised up
[1:16:09] at this last day
[1:16:12] right now another place the prophet says
[1:16:14] you see what he means when he says the
[1:16:16] last shall be
[1:16:18] first because you have to be in him you
[1:16:21] have to be forced this flesh man is not
[1:16:23] first this flesh man come afterwards but
[1:16:26] the first shall be last to be the last
[1:16:29] man standing brother
[1:16:31] praise god
[1:16:32] hallelujah oh i wish old pete was here
[1:16:35] brother he'd be jumping in shouting and
[1:16:37] screaming
[1:16:38] amen he said he'll take you back from
[1:16:41] the dust back to the stars where you
[1:16:44] come from beyond the stars where you
[1:16:46] come from
[1:16:47] then you see
[1:16:50] coming down the regular line
[1:16:53] from attribute
[1:16:56] before the foundation of this world
[1:17:00] see
[1:17:01] oh my
[1:17:02] he come down like that
[1:17:04] before the foundation
[1:17:07] and do you know his name
[1:17:10] is put on the lamb's book of life
[1:17:13] oh my
[1:17:15] see the book of all living things
[1:17:19] all living things
[1:17:21] the lamb's book of life eternal life
[1:17:25] amen
[1:17:27] and eternal life and you know that
[1:17:28] breaks down the various degrees of
[1:17:31] persons that have will receive eternal
[1:17:34] life somewhat we don't expect them so on
[1:17:36] god will still granted by his being rich
[1:17:39] and mercy will grant that eternal life
[1:17:42] you see but that's why he says his name
[1:17:45] shall be called jesus
[1:17:47] right there you see his name on the book
[1:17:51] of life right amen see
[1:17:55] then
[1:17:56] he become known
[1:17:58] the word
[1:18:01] see
[1:18:02] the theophany
[1:18:04] that could appear and disappear
[1:18:07] but you see now he could do all those
[1:18:09] things but under a flesh bill named
[1:18:11] jesus
[1:18:13] right he was doing that under a flesh
[1:18:15] veil named jesus
[1:18:17] hallelujah praise god he could appear
[1:18:20] and disappear they tried to take him to
[1:18:22] the to a cliff and throw him over and
[1:18:25] the bible says and he just
[1:18:27] passing through the midst of them went
[1:18:28] this way
[1:18:29] just leave them with their foolishness
[1:18:31] you know walk through the middle of them
[1:18:33] and he's gone
[1:18:35] right because he still had the element
[1:18:38] of the
[1:18:40] ability of the theophany in him but
[1:18:43] inside of a veil of flesh and he was
[1:18:46] conscious of it praise god hallelujah
[1:18:49] now
[1:18:50] he become flesh
[1:18:53] and returned back there again
[1:18:57] resurrected the same body
[1:19:00] in a glorified condition
[1:19:04] but you see you you bypass that
[1:19:08] theophany
[1:19:09] and you and i we come here become flesh
[1:19:13] man
[1:19:15] i repeat to be tempted by sin
[1:19:18] god proven his word that that person
[1:19:21] there is his word
[1:19:23] and his word can't fail can't lie can't
[1:19:26] come back void it can't it will always
[1:19:29] he said return back to me it will return
[1:19:32] to him and it won't return void it will
[1:19:35] fulfill its mission it will do what it
[1:19:38] was set down here to do amen
[1:19:40] praise god you see
[1:19:42] oh my
[1:19:44] now
[1:19:45] to become flesh man to be tempted by sin
[1:19:48] hallelujah or praise god but while they
[1:19:52] know they're going through all these
[1:19:53] things they're not worried why he says
[1:19:56] here because they know if this earthly
[1:20:00] tabernacle this flesh man be dissolved
[1:20:03] back to dust
[1:20:05] we have one already waiting
[1:20:10] hallelujah
[1:20:12] so you have another you have a body
[1:20:14] waiting for you
[1:20:15] we have bodies waiting for us
[1:20:18] so you see why we don't fear what they
[1:20:21] call death
[1:20:22] what they call death
[1:20:24] because that death is no death for us
[1:20:28] who are real believers the attribute
[1:20:32] suns the
[1:20:33] the spirit man that god has in there
[1:20:37] praise god you see but we have not yet
[1:20:41] got those bodies
[1:20:43] but they are waiting amen hallelujah
[1:20:48] praise god
[1:20:50] when this body receives the spirit of
[1:20:52] god
[1:20:55] the immortal life
[1:20:57] inside of you
[1:20:59] throws this flesh this body
[1:21:03] into subjection
[1:21:05] to god hallelujah
[1:21:07] he that is born of god does not commit
[1:21:10] sin
[1:21:11] now
[1:21:12] we've taught on that that john talked
[1:21:14] about it that the seed of god can't
[1:21:17] commit sin
[1:21:18] because i see this part of god himself
[1:21:21] it can't commit sin but the devil's
[1:21:24] strategy through the ages
[1:21:26] is that he does he goes
[1:21:29] causes you to lie yes you can't say no i
[1:21:32] didn't lie
[1:21:33] it was the seed
[1:21:37] no
[1:21:39] no but he he does use you to lie
[1:21:43] he lose you to cheat he used you to do
[1:21:45] whatever evil wrong or whatever
[1:21:49] but
[1:21:50] he he's not letting on that you know he
[1:21:53] is the motivator brother george smith
[1:21:56] said it from this pulpit he goes and
[1:21:59] uh
[1:22:00] eggs you on to go light a fire
[1:22:04] and then when the moment you light the
[1:22:06] fire he's the first one to run and go
[1:22:08] call the police
[1:22:10] see look what he did look what he did he
[1:22:12] liked to fire his burning down that
[1:22:13] person's house but he is the instigator
[1:22:17] he is the accuser of the brethren
[1:22:19] he is the one doing those things
[1:22:22] but god has woke us up by a prophet of
[1:22:26] malachi 4 william marion branham and by
[1:22:29] this revelation the seed of god cannot
[1:22:33] commit sin for she is part of him the
[1:22:36] word and more than that she is justified
[1:22:41] hallelujah she had never done it in the
[1:22:44] first place it wasn't her it wasn't him
[1:22:47] it was the devil back there motivating
[1:22:50] instigating and stirring things up
[1:22:53] because he wants to see how many of them
[1:22:55] he can take to hell and he can't take
[1:22:58] none for he said i will lose none that
[1:23:01] will place within my hands not a single
[1:23:05] one hallelujah lord of god amen amen
[1:23:09] praise god forevermore
[1:23:11] praise the lord oh my
[1:23:14] therefore we know
[1:23:16] there is therefore
[1:23:17] no condemnation
[1:23:20] them to them that are in christ jesus
[1:23:23] for they walk not after the flesh
[1:23:27] that they're living in in other words
[1:23:28] and and the motivations desires and
[1:23:31] nature of this flesh they're living in
[1:23:34] amen see oh praise god they walk not
[1:23:38] after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:23:41] there you are
[1:23:43] see
[1:23:44] that
[1:23:45] causes you to throw that body into
[1:23:48] subjection to the world
[1:23:51] hallelujah oh praise god you don't have
[1:23:55] to say oh
[1:23:57] no more you don't have to say oh if i
[1:23:59] could just quit drinking

[1:24:04] this
[1:24:05] oh if i could only quit drinking if i
[1:24:08] could only don't say this if i could do
[1:24:10] that if i don't do this oh my
[1:24:14] oh all you've got to do is recognize and
[1:24:17] get into christ
[1:24:19] you get into christ and it's all gone
[1:24:22] because you're all gone doesn't mean
[1:24:26] it's gone but it's all gone because it's
[1:24:28] passing away god means passing away
[1:24:31] right it's passing away there you see
[1:24:34] because your body becomes subject to the
[1:24:36] spirit and them things are now dead
[1:24:40] they're dead your sins are buried you're
[1:24:43] a new creation who can say that
[1:24:47] i'm a new creation
[1:24:49] i'm a brand new man i've been born again
[1:24:52] hallelujah thanks be to god you see your
[1:24:56] body becoming subject to the spirit
[1:25:00] and it causes you to try to live a right
[1:25:04] kind of life
[1:25:07] you just try to live
[1:25:09] why because in other places he talked he
[1:25:12] said but we're still inside of this
[1:25:14] flesh body
[1:25:15] we're still going to be tempted we're
[1:25:16] still going to be tested we're still
[1:25:18] going to have all kinds of things come
[1:25:20] across our thoughts and minds and
[1:25:21] everything else but you are aware you're
[1:25:24] in this body but you're trying to
[1:25:26] overcome those things and you may never
[1:25:29] overcome them every one before the
[1:25:32] rapture but god knows your intents of
[1:25:34] your heart he knows every desire of your
[1:25:37] mind he knows all that is in you praise
[1:25:40] god it's not trained to think that you
[1:25:43] are going to
[1:25:44] grow up in a monastery and bring
[1:25:46] yourself to perfection
[1:25:48] no
[1:25:49] the perfection dwells within you and
[1:25:52] you're trying to work it out every day
[1:25:54] you're trying to work out your salvation
[1:25:57] oh praise god forevermore oh my just
[1:26:01] think of women claiming they got the
[1:26:03] holy ghost
[1:26:06] and going out wearing shorts
[1:26:09] and things on how could you do that
[1:26:12] how could that be the spirit of god in
[1:26:14] you and it let you do such a thing as
[1:26:17] that certainly it's he's not a filthy
[1:26:21] spirit
[1:26:22] he is the holy spirit
[1:26:26] when you become subject to the spirit
[1:26:28] that troubles your whole being
[1:26:30] subject to him
[1:26:32] the spirit hallelujah
[1:26:34] is nothing in the world but this same
[1:26:38] seed may manifest in you quickened
[1:26:42] hallelujah quicken hallelujah and now
[1:26:46] made alive
[1:26:48] oh praise god so them seeds that were
[1:26:51] laying in the dust there
[1:26:53] waiting for three thousand years like
[1:26:55] that wheat seed that what they found in
[1:26:57] egypt and when they go and put some
[1:27:00] moisture on that we see to their shock
[1:27:03] and surprise the seed began to blossom
[1:27:07] and grow again oh praise god to produce
[1:27:10] another loaf of bread oh praise god

[1:27:22] word seed made manifest in you or
[1:27:27] quickened hallelujah it's man alive
[1:27:31] praise god
[1:27:32] when the bible
[1:27:34] then says to you don't do this the body
[1:27:37] quickly has to turn to it and answer
[1:27:39] there is no question for the spirit that
[1:27:42] is in you is that word
[1:27:45] praise god in other words you can't deny
[1:27:47] yourself
[1:27:49] right oh you're going to deny your own

[1:27:53] earnest of your resurrection

[1:28:00] because it's already started
[1:28:03] it was once subject to sin to maya the
[1:28:07] corruption but now it's got the earnest
[1:28:10] inside of it it's turned it's turning
[1:28:14] heavenly now that's the earnest you're
[1:28:17] going in the rapture hallelujah oh

[1:28:42] that quickening power
[1:28:44] what praise that is from who is this
[1:28:46] melchizedek praise the name of the lord
[1:28:49] this is from the rising of the sun
[1:28:53] now notice this quickening power
[1:28:56] bringing the word
[1:28:58] or the mind
[1:29:00] that was in christ in you
[1:29:05] amen let me say that again
[1:29:08] this quickening power
[1:29:10] bringing the word
[1:29:13] the mind
[1:29:15] that was in christ
[1:29:17] in
[1:29:18] to you
[1:29:20] i'm trying to show you that that when
[1:29:24] you are raised
[1:29:26] god raised jesus from the dead
[1:29:29] but he raised you up also
[1:29:32] also quit into life with him
[1:29:36] you are now quick to life although then
[1:29:40] you were but an attribute still in his
[1:29:44] thoughts
[1:29:48] when he
[1:29:49] was on the cross
[1:29:52] i
[1:29:53] was on
[1:29:54] his mind
[1:29:56] yes he
[1:29:57] yes he knew
[1:30:01] yet he loved me
[1:30:05] oh praise god you you see do you see
[1:30:08] clearly
[1:30:10] when he was on the cross he was thinking
[1:30:12] of all of his
[1:30:14] that's why
[1:30:16] isaiah said he shall see his seed
[1:30:20] he shall come and see his generation
[1:30:23] oh praise god hallelujah amen
[1:30:28] oh my
[1:30:30] quicken to life
[1:30:32] see
[1:30:33] with him
[1:30:35] but
[1:30:36] then you were only an attribute in his
[1:30:40] thoughts
[1:30:42] but god saw all of them in him
[1:30:48] at the finished
[1:30:50] praise god hallelujah amen
[1:30:54] so
[1:30:56] what the prophet is saying is that when
[1:30:58] jesus came
[1:31:00] and he was here
[1:31:02] they look and they see the one man jesus
[1:31:05] but we were still in the starts
[1:31:08] that's like the wife still being in
[1:31:10] adam's side
[1:31:12] and he is doing all these things but he
[1:31:14] said the prophet is saying don't you
[1:31:16] understand don't you know what it means
[1:31:18] when he was walking and doing all them
[1:31:21] things going on the cross dying and
[1:31:23] going in the grave overcome death
[1:31:25] already and raise up and you were you
[1:31:28] were in him don't you understand it's
[1:31:31] talking about you because you overcome
[1:31:33] them things already you're waiting now
[1:31:36] for the manifestation of it and the holy
[1:31:39] spirit has come as an earnest to your
[1:31:41] resurrection that you've got to be in
[1:31:43] that number
[1:31:45] he said because when god looked down
[1:31:48] upon that body he said all of them in
[1:31:52] him
[1:31:54] hallelujah you didn't see him alone but
[1:31:56] he said all in him he's our husband and
[1:31:58] wife in other words
[1:32:00] husband and wife together
[1:32:03] the spirit left him in the garden of
[1:32:05] gethsemane
[1:32:07] for yet to die as a man
[1:32:10] remember friends god anointed that flesh
[1:32:13] which was only human flesh
[1:32:17] if he that went up there as god
[1:32:21] he would have never died
[1:32:23] they couldn't kill him
[1:32:25] see
[1:32:26] because you can't kill god
[1:32:30] so
[1:32:31] he didn't have to do it but he did
[1:32:35] remember
[1:32:36] he went there when he went there he went
[1:32:40] there
[1:32:41] with you in him
[1:32:45] praise god
[1:32:47] uh paragraph 242 rising of the sun he
[1:32:50] says remember
[1:32:52] he went there
[1:32:54] with you in him
[1:32:56] praise god
[1:32:58] i i make a note here in order for him to
[1:33:02] redeem us he went there with us
[1:33:07] already in him
[1:33:10] god had never separated yet the bride
[1:33:14] from the groom
[1:33:16] like adam and eve
[1:33:18] when he took her
[1:33:20] from adam's what
[1:33:22] side
[1:33:24] amen
[1:33:25] but with jesus the prophet is saying
[1:33:27] here at this point god had not yet taken
[1:33:32] the the bride from in the groom she was
[1:33:36] still in him
[1:33:38] that's why he says you're identified
[1:33:40] with christ
[1:33:42] everything he did you already done it
[1:33:45] he overcame you overcome
[1:33:48] in your flesh you may be struggling but
[1:33:51] really the man inside the you guarantees
[1:33:54] you to overcome and that you are an
[1:33:57] overcomer already because you overcome
[1:33:59] he said how by him that is in you that
[1:34:02] has already overcome
[1:34:04] oh praise god hallelujah amen so when
[1:34:09] god looked down
[1:34:10] upon the body of christ then
[1:34:14] looking down
[1:34:16] he was he saw
[1:34:18] both male and female
[1:34:22] hallelujah
[1:34:23] for the bride
[1:34:25] was still in the groom
[1:34:29] so when it redeemed it was all redeemed
[1:34:34] in
[1:34:35] that one body
[1:34:38] it was all redeemed
[1:34:41] that's why
[1:34:43] they are one and the same
[1:34:47] word
[1:34:50] this same word that spoke of the groom
[1:34:54] speaks of the bride
[1:34:57] hallelujah when it speaks of the groom
[1:34:59] it speaks of the bride oh how can the
[1:35:02] bride come and fail to manifest
[1:35:05] everything that was spoken of concerning
[1:35:08] him
[1:35:09] see
[1:35:10] and the groom come
[1:35:11] and when he come again
[1:35:15] he wouldn't be
[1:35:17] the bride
[1:35:18] his own bride
[1:35:21] so the bride
[1:35:23] manifesting the word
[1:35:25] is actually
[1:35:27] crap the lord jesus christ come back by
[1:35:29] the seventh seed this is the coming of
[1:35:30] christ but now he's come in the bright
[1:35:32] form
[1:35:34] he's come as his own bride
[1:35:38] let me repeat it again read it again
[1:35:41] how can the bride
[1:35:43] remember
[1:35:44] the word that spoke of the groom speaks
[1:35:46] to the bride they're one
[1:35:48] how can the break come and fail to
[1:35:51] manifest everything that was promised of
[1:35:54] him
[1:35:55] and how can the groom come
[1:35:58] and wouldn't
[1:36:00] be
[1:36:01] the bride
[1:36:04] hallelujah
[1:36:05] that's too much
[1:36:08] oh praise god sister sheila god bless
[1:36:11] your soul oh praise god he's a marvelous
[1:36:14] wonderful god

[1:36:24] it by raising himself up from the dead

[1:36:33] the very same thing
[1:36:36] amen praise god have to be exactly he
[1:36:40] says that's what the word said she would
[1:36:43] be in the last days don't you have to
[1:36:46] return through malachi 4
[1:36:49] hallelujah in other words you referring
[1:36:50] to the angel that come down and rule

[1:37:05] uh and seminaries they add you in
[1:37:09] and then you're able to come out into
[1:37:11] the glorious liberty and recognize
[1:37:14] who you are

[1:37:21] the days of sodom

[1:43:32] rainbow of promise oh
[1:43:34] god asks us to believe his word
[1:43:37] then
[1:43:38] we believe it he sends the holy spirit
[1:43:41] to energize that word
[1:43:44] praise god when he falls into it the
[1:43:48] word when the word is being preached the
[1:43:51] holy spirit brings the word he energizes
[1:43:54] that and then
[1:43:56] he flashes the same light

[1:46:06] amen
[1:46:07] not by might nor by power but by my
[1:46:12] spirit said the lord
[1:46:14] not by your wisdom not by knowledge not
[1:46:17] by denomination
[1:46:19] but by my spirit i will energize my word
[1:46:23] hallelujah the disciple he had sowed it
[1:46:26] into them disciples
[1:46:29] when the spirit come

[1:46:35] saying this the word that was already in
[1:46:37] them
[1:46:38] what the holy spirit does
[1:46:41] the holy spirit doesn't bring out
[1:46:44] what you're not
[1:46:45] it brings every seed must bring forth
[1:46:49] after its kind
[1:46:51] and the true baptism holy spirit
[1:46:54] comes to
[1:46:56] quicken that seed that was
[1:47:00] buried in the dust of the earth
[1:47:03] and make it start to
[1:47:05] wake up
[1:47:06] no matter if it was sleeping for 3000
[1:47:08] years it starts to wake up it starts to
[1:47:11] recognize who it is where it come from
[1:47:14] where it's what's supposed to do and
[1:47:16] where it's going back to amen
[1:47:19] remember now that's wisdom versus faith
[1:47:22] amen oh my pre see oh praise god
[1:47:26] now remember
[1:47:29] you remember i've told you some time ago
[1:47:31] just before jesus come the devil is
[1:47:34] cunning and a sly and wicked before

[1:47:39] whole bunch of false messiahs came on
[1:47:41] the scene
[1:47:42] they were trying the devil was trying to
[1:47:44] confuse and confuse and mix up the minds
[1:47:47] of the people so all of a sudden you
[1:47:49] start to get a whole bunch of them
[1:47:51] tagging us judas macabre so this one
[1:47:54] that one coming and saying dear the
[1:47:56] messiah until that problem wrong
[1:47:59] you know uh before the real messiah
[1:48:02] jesus christ come on the scene well if
[1:48:04] it happened to him the bright room
[1:48:07] what's the happen to the bride

[1:48:25] but there has got to come one
[1:48:30] there has got to come forth a real bride
[1:48:33] praise be to god but this false one's
[1:48:36] got to come first
[1:48:38] this false will not go out there but
[1:48:40] that only lets you know the real one is
[1:48:43] on the way
[1:48:45] hallelujah
[1:48:46] one that's not only got mechanics
[1:48:50] she not only got a
[1:48:52] building of beautiful church buildings
[1:48:55] no
[1:48:56] but the dynamics of it makes the church
[1:49:00] live
[1:49:01] and move under the power of the
[1:49:03] resurrection
[1:49:05] hallelujah no matter how much the
[1:49:07] mechanics prove to be right it has got
[1:49:10] to be the dynamics to make it work don't
[1:49:13] matter how you build a church building
[1:49:15] no matter
[1:49:17] how you got your life in order with all
[1:49:19] kind of church teachings
[1:49:21] you got all your mechanics you got it
[1:49:24] right
[1:49:25] none of that means nothing unless the
[1:49:27] holy spirit comes to quicken those
[1:49:30] mechanics he says that is what easter
[1:49:34] actually proved he wasn't only the word
[1:49:38] he was god himself
[1:49:40] the dynamics in the world
[1:49:43] oh praise god hallelujah that made the
[1:49:47] body of jesus christ called stiff dead
[1:49:50] in the grave shake into life and rise
[1:49:53] again praise god you know praise god i'm
[1:49:56] running ahead of myself but i will get
[1:49:58] to that another week
[1:50:00] he says
[1:50:02] it's not the
[1:50:03] seed itself that just
[1:50:05] comes to life and start to grow
[1:50:08] you see
[1:50:11] when the rain falls he says there have
[1:50:14] to be
[1:50:15] an invisible life in that sea yes
[1:50:19] and that's what the rain
[1:50:21] come to putin
[1:50:23] to let it grow and live praise god
[1:50:26] hallelujah oh my so i'm so grateful to
[1:50:30] god that in the sea of god
[1:50:33] that there is

[1:50:47] [Music]
[1:50:56] [Music]
[1:51:02] oh my praise god forevermore think of it
[1:51:06] oh my
[1:51:08] oh my see
[1:51:09] the dynamics
[1:51:12] in the word
[1:51:14] that's what made the body
[1:51:17] of jesus christ the body of jesus christ
[1:51:20] but the dynamics was in the flesh man
[1:51:23] jesus
[1:51:24] and made that rise up hallelujah no
[1:51:27] matter if the moon said he was dead son
[1:51:29] said he was dead star said he was dead
[1:51:31] all nature could even say he was dead
[1:51:34] but the whole world may recognize now
[1:51:36] that he's alive again i am he that
[1:51:39] levitan was dead but i'm alive
[1:51:41] forevermore praise god he was not only
[1:51:45] the mechanics of the world but he was
[1:51:47] the dynamics to prove the word prove it
[1:51:50] praise god hallelujah
[1:51:52] he being the groom then
[1:51:55] the bride
[1:51:56] has to come forth
[1:51:58] because she spotted him
[1:52:00] and if he come forth she has got to come
[1:52:03] forth
[1:52:05] oh my it can only be the manifestation
[1:52:08] of the fulfillment fulfilling of all the
[1:52:12] revelations
[1:52:14] any others have spoke about the bride
[1:52:17] now it can only be made manifest
[1:52:21] praise god if it does something
[1:52:24] different from the groom
[1:52:26] then that is not the original bride
[1:52:31] because she is flesh of his flesh
[1:52:36] amen
[1:52:37] bone
[1:52:38] of his bone
[1:52:40] natural flesh of his flesh bone of his

[1:52:50] just like your bone soldier body as a
[1:52:52] foundation the spirit of god she is
[1:52:56] part of him bone of his
[1:52:59] bone praise god hallelujah oh my she
[1:53:04] can't manifest to do something different
[1:53:06] than the group she's got to go according
[1:53:09] to the word hallelujah she is life of
[1:53:12] his life power of his power
[1:53:14] she is him
[1:53:16] let me repeat again
[1:53:18] she is him
[1:53:21] as men and women are one
[1:53:25] the woman taken from his side
[1:53:28] she had taken a spirit or the feminist
[1:53:32] spirit taken from him
[1:53:34] amen
[1:53:36] praise god we are the bright spirit
[1:53:37] taken from him the flesh from his side
[1:53:41] made both mechanics and
[1:53:44] dynamics
[1:53:46] their wife hallelujah
[1:53:49] praise god that's little there but you
[1:53:51] see what they're saying too
[1:53:54] god allow us to come down here
[1:53:56] to become in these flesh bodies
[1:53:59] that he can come back
[1:54:01] and be the dynamics
[1:54:03] in these mechanics
[1:54:05] to manifest himself true
[1:54:08] and make the word real to the world
[1:54:11] hallelujah praise god put it together
[1:54:15] and this the spirit in him
[1:54:18] to put him and
[1:54:19] the wife together the spirit of him and
[1:54:22] by the flesh of him the word and put it
[1:54:25] together
[1:54:26] making both mechanics and dynamics
[1:54:30] praise god forevermore hallelujah i'm
[1:54:34] gonna i'm gonna pause here
[1:54:36] and we're gonna pick this up
[1:54:39] hallelujah
[1:54:40] amen
[1:54:42] two more quotes short quotes quickly
[1:54:45] for if the spirit that raised christ
[1:54:48] from the dead
[1:54:49] now dwells in you
[1:54:53] will it not also quicken your
[1:54:56] mortal body
[1:54:58] your flesh body that you're in
[1:55:00] if it's the same spirit that was in
[1:55:02] jesus christ in you
[1:55:04] amen praise god it also quickens your
[1:55:08] mortal body
[1:55:10] now how we flesh of his flesh and bone
[1:55:13] of his bone because
[1:55:16] we are yet mortal sinners by the flesh
[1:55:20] mortal that part ready to die these
[1:55:24] bodies ready to die
[1:55:26] you see
[1:55:27] but the spirit
[1:55:29] quickens
[1:55:31] brings to life the spirit that wants
[1:55:34] light to drink
[1:55:35] run around commit adultery all these
[1:55:37] things it's quicker than this body that
[1:55:40] you're living in why you see it's quick
[1:55:44] in it
[1:55:45] that thing now
[1:55:47] hallelujah

[1:55:50] amen
[1:55:53] and you are now resurrected
[1:55:56] praise god oh my
[1:55:59] i thought you're going to resurrect
[1:56:01] um
[1:56:02] i don't know how many years you are
[1:56:04] going to live or whatever i thought
[1:56:06] that's when your body gonna rise up out
[1:56:08] of the grave like like that you see
[1:56:11] those are pentecostal delusions
[1:56:14] and paintings
[1:56:16] that they
[1:56:17] visualize that that's how it's going to
[1:56:19] be
[1:56:20] but god says no that's not how it's
[1:56:22] going to be you are you you're being
[1:56:25] spiritualized right now for the rest of
[1:56:28] this journey
[1:56:29] amen right now and your the first stage
[1:56:33] of the process of resurrection it
[1:56:35] started already because the spirit has
[1:56:37] already quickened you to the word
[1:56:41] oh my and we gotta be like captain kirk
[1:56:44] where all the atoms got to kind of move
[1:56:47] around a bit before it
[1:56:49] forms the whole thing and you go back to
[1:56:52] being where you were but god by his
[1:56:54] spirit hallelujah
[1:56:56] amen prophecy is being fulfilled
[1:57:01] therefore your bodies
[1:57:04] now
[1:57:05] are just the temple
[1:57:07] for the dynamics
[1:57:10] who is the dynamics him
[1:57:12] praise god so don't you see
[1:57:15] there is your resurrection there
[1:57:19] he's telling us what the resurrection is
[1:57:21] not what this pentecostal saying is the
[1:57:23] resurrection
[1:57:24] and god even believers that following
[1:57:26] this message years of that drumming in
[1:57:28] their head they're still looking for
[1:57:31] that kind of resurrection not realizing
[1:57:34] it's a supernatural resurrection that's
[1:57:36] going on now
[1:57:38] but time to come to that
[1:57:41] one moment
[1:57:45] your god
[1:57:46] hallelujah
[1:57:48] if you're dead you'll be changed
[1:57:52] that change will be completed amen
[1:57:56] from this body
[1:57:58] praise god by the grace of god i'll end
[1:58:00] this now therefore your body is a
[1:58:03] technology dynamics
[1:58:05] from the beginning
[1:58:07] you
[1:58:08] are a part of the mechanics
[1:58:12] there is your resurrection
[1:58:14] there is the church in the resurrection
[1:58:17] with him these bodies right now
[1:58:21] right now i say are quicker
[1:58:24] see
[1:58:25] you heard
[1:58:27] you believed
[1:58:29] and it changed you

[1:59:26] spirit spoke for him and said but they
