[2:51] when people were happy to come to church
[2:53] you don't know what next going to happen
[2:55] God the presence of God broke up last
[2:58] night with only two of us there but all
[3:00] the P walk
[3:02] the wow my my my to God hallelujah I
[3:07] believe amen is that right amen I
[3:10] remember when we were in the all white
[3:12] church sometimes the Devils walk off the
[3:15] street come in and they sit down in the
[3:17] congregation and daring and in the
[3:19] middle of the preaching when the Holy
[3:21] Ghost begins to fall they can't take it
[3:22] anymore they scream and run up
[3:25] Hallelujah bang the door and run right
[3:28] out amen the ones that really want
[3:31] Deliver us and we pray for them pray for
[3:32] them the Lord J you believe that can
[3:34] happen
[3:35] again you believe God can send another
[3:37] way
[3:40] theen in
[3:42] Africa I'm sorry it's happening in India
[3:45] brother said it looks like this North
[3:47] America he say been SED out it's like
[3:50] you fish out the whole thing and there
[3:52] AR many fish there praise the Lord until
[3:55] the people don't blame the people but we
[3:59] understand that because all these
[4:01] evangelists went all over the place
[4:03] carrying on some of them are fi some of
[4:05] them carrying on all kinds of tricks and
[4:07] everything else like that the poor
[4:09] people have gotten so uh you know sick
[4:13] of seeing all that stuff that that when
[4:15] the real comes along they don't know if
[4:17] it's
[4:18] real amen hallelujah so we have to
[4:22] understand that praise the Lord but
[4:24] brother BR himself said that he said it
[4:27] looks like he's moving more and them
[4:29] farther land he says if the sermon I
[4:33] preach here was preached over there he
[4:35] says thousands would be delivered right
[4:38] now amen amen praise the Lord my God
[4:42] have mercy praise God may the Lord Jesus
[4:45] help us amen praise God but I believe
[4:48] that God can even give Samson one more
[4:52] once more
[4:53] Lord you know he was preaching by the
[4:55] United States of America and how they
[4:57] fail God that's really the type for the
[4:59] shadow that he had there how they fail
[5:02] God
[5:03] absolutely and walked away didn't keep
[5:05] his their Covenant with him right and
[5:08] they didn't keep the Covenant and so
[5:10] they're they put in this position where
[5:12] they're blind and bound and made the
[5:16] grind uh like that and uh you see and
[5:20] and they're given up praise the Lord
[5:23] somebody said brother said it's not
[5:26] going to there no more Revival in the
[5:29] United state of America she's finished
[5:32] she's gone but people do not understand
[5:36] prophecy just like Elisha went and said
[5:39] to Hezekiah prepare for tomorrow you die
[5:44] put your house in order it wasn't
[5:46] Prophecy from the prophet put El in
[5:48] order for tomorrow you die but my God
[5:51] the sincere prayer of
[5:54] Hezekiah God come back and tell the same
[5:57] Prophet that told him you're going to
[5:59] die go back and tell him you're going to
[6:01] live am praise the Lord hallelujah the
[6:05] devil condemn you so you're going to die
[6:08] but God says you're going to
