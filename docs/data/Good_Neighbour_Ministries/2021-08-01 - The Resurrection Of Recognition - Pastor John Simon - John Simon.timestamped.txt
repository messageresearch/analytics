[1:00:06] in the name of jesus christ
[1:00:08] amen praise god god bless you please be
[1:00:12] seated
[1:00:20] i'm going to try something here that i
[1:00:22] don't normally try
[1:00:24] and that is using trying to see if i can
[1:00:26] use a tablet uh
[1:00:28] i'm trying to swing around to see if i
[1:00:30] can start using these newfangled things
[1:00:33] but uh i'm not like brother chris that's
[1:00:36] cerullo he's just uh
[1:00:39] he's just i
[1:00:42] praise god hallelujah my sheep
[1:00:45] know my voice now you know that the
[1:00:47] bible from
[1:00:48] genesis to revelation is really the
[1:00:51] story of redemption
[1:00:53] it's of how god transformed
[1:00:57] himself from unseen
[1:01:01] spirit being right on
[1:01:04] down to a visible
[1:01:07] being of flesh that we could know
[1:01:11] in the form and in the name of jesus
[1:01:14] christ
[1:01:15] now we know that the
[1:01:18] second adam who is jesus christ
[1:01:22] is now expressing or manifesting himself
[1:01:26] through the first adam who was the
[1:01:30] man that was flesh so spirit
[1:01:33] is now manifesting itself through
[1:01:37] flesh amen uh you'll find
[1:01:40] first corinthians 15 44 to 48
[1:01:44] the first adam was earthy he was a flesh
[1:01:48] the second adam is the lord from heaven
[1:01:51] his spirit
[1:01:52] he is the quickening spirit that
[1:01:54] quickens everything
[1:01:56] amen so the gene of god
[1:01:59] the un unseen gene of god
[1:02:03] is here to express itself
[1:02:06] through visible flesh that has your name
[1:02:09] on it
[1:02:10] so the gene is expressing itself through
[1:02:14] us who are made of flesh
[1:02:17] so god in his great
[1:02:21] uh as i explained before how that god
[1:02:25] created man and man was
[1:02:28] first a spirit man but then
[1:02:32] in genesis 2 he says he formed man
[1:02:37] and so he took the spirit man adam
[1:02:40] who could not yet kill the soil and put
[1:02:44] him
[1:02:44] into the flesh man so that he could
[1:02:47] till the soil and so
[1:02:51] we find out that god
[1:02:55] sent the gene down here but then
[1:02:58] he had to form a body
[1:03:02] for that gene so he
[1:03:05] used our dabs and moms to
[1:03:08] form that body that
[1:03:11] that gene would come to
[1:03:15] we find in isaiah 44
[1:03:19] 1-4 and you can write it down
[1:03:23] he said to isaiah i formed thee
[1:03:27] from the womb and in
[1:03:30] psalms 139 13 1
[1:03:33] to 16 he david said i was
[1:03:37] curiously wrought or formed
[1:03:40] right and wondrously
[1:03:44] made in the otherwise part of the earth
[1:03:48] then into jeremiah 1 4-5
[1:03:52] he said jeremiah i form
[1:03:55] thee in the belly and i knew you
[1:03:58] before i formed you praise god
[1:04:01] god knew you before you were even formed
[1:04:06] hallelujah amen so
[1:04:09] i brought that to bring to your
[1:04:11] attention
[1:04:12] that the gene of god that was set
[1:04:16] down here amen
[1:04:19] is now searching to find
[1:04:22] its body
[1:04:26] now in you maybe it's found this body
[1:04:29] but it's searching to find
[1:04:32] its natural body amen
[1:04:36] and even so as your gene had
[1:04:40] to search to find your natural body
[1:04:44] the holy spirit as the great jehovah
[1:04:47] eagle
[1:04:48] is searching now to find the genes that
[1:04:52] he sent down here
[1:04:55] he is now here searching to find
[1:04:58] those genes amen you know brother
[1:05:01] branham's eagle's story
[1:05:03] that we know he told a story but it was
[1:05:06] really a story he was trying to
[1:05:07] illustrate
[1:05:08] something how that god the great eagle
[1:05:11] has come to earth and is searching to
[1:05:15] find
[1:05:15] his very own let me make the statement
[1:05:20] eternal life knows its own
[1:05:26] and eternal life knows its own body
[1:05:31] praise god hallelujah now
[1:05:34] about 800 years before
[1:05:38] mary got here on the earth
[1:05:42] mary i'm talking about the mother of
[1:05:45] jesus
[1:05:47] 800 years before isaiah the prophet
[1:05:51] stood up and said behold
[1:05:54] a virgin shall conceive and
[1:05:57] bear a son and his name shall be called
[1:06:01] emmanuel
[1:06:02] amen praise god and so
[1:06:05] praise the lord i'll get by past that
[1:06:08] back then the virgin conceived today i
[1:06:10] don't know if the church
[1:06:12] modern church can conceive the word in
[1:06:15] this day
[1:06:16] an hour in which we live hallelujah
[1:06:20] praise god so when that
[1:06:23] prophet spoke the word
[1:06:26] god said my word runs swiftly throughout
[1:06:29] the earth
[1:06:30] and it will not come back to me void
[1:06:34] until it's accomplished what i sent it
[1:06:36] forth to do
[1:06:37] so that word the spoken word from the
[1:06:40] mouth of god
[1:06:41] went out and when it went out for
[1:06:45] 800 years that
[1:06:48] word of god started
[1:06:52] brooding over the waters as in the
[1:06:55] beginning
[1:06:56] but this time the waters of the people
[1:06:59] it started searching in other words
[1:07:02] to find that body find mary
[1:07:05] wherever she was i'm sure
[1:07:09] a lot of denominations presented
[1:07:11] themselves that maybe they are the
[1:07:13] virgin
[1:07:14] and it searched maybe there was a lot of
[1:07:16] virgins in the land
[1:07:18] but the holy spirit bypassed every
[1:07:21] single one
[1:07:24] he bypassed them and came
[1:07:27] right straight to the he had to wait for
[1:07:30] the time
[1:07:31] and the season before he could
[1:07:34] find the exact virgin that god
[1:07:38] already had in his mind because you know
[1:07:41] we are made in the image of god
[1:07:43] and if you say chair right away you you
[1:07:45] visualize chair
[1:07:47] uh you you can see the chair you can see
[1:07:49] the eagle or whatever
[1:07:50] and god is the same way god spoke the
[1:07:53] word and right then he already knew who
[1:07:55] the virgin was
[1:07:57] so the holy spirit went out searching
[1:08:00] to find that virgin that was spoken of
[1:08:04] in the word of god hallelujah and the
[1:08:08] lord
[1:08:08] kept searching and would not stop
[1:08:11] until mary was born
[1:08:15] hallelujah and because the
[1:08:18] eternal spoken word of god
[1:08:21] always knows its own body
[1:08:24] that word went right straight to mary
[1:08:28] the virgin that was predestinated
[1:08:31] to receive that word and to hear it for
[1:08:34] her day
[1:08:35] and for her time and for our hour
[1:08:38] praise god amen you'll find brother
[1:08:41] branham making that statement
[1:08:43] in questions and answers on the seals
[1:08:46] paragraph 96 where he is the one
[1:08:50] that said eternal life knows its
[1:08:54] own body and it will find its own body
[1:08:58] wherever that is is such till it finds
[1:09:01] that body
[1:09:02] right there praise god so we are
[1:09:04] thankful to god
[1:09:06] that the lord found me i'm glad the word
[1:09:10] found you
[1:09:11] i'm glad he found all of us amen
[1:09:14] we are here not because we were
[1:09:18] searching
[1:09:18] for god but god searched for his own
[1:09:22] and he found his own amen and we are
[1:09:25] here because he has found us
[1:09:27] and he has identified himself with us
[1:09:31] praise god amen the word
[1:09:34] will always know the word
[1:09:39] if the word is in you then the word
[1:09:43] in you will always know and
[1:09:46] recognize the word
[1:09:49] amen praise god and
[1:09:52] we see here uh that word
[1:09:56] let me bypass that praise god
[1:10:00] these two attributes or
[1:10:03] these two thoughts of god that came out
[1:10:06] of the mind of god
[1:10:08] let's say jesus and mary
[1:10:11] that came out hallelujah
[1:10:14] there in the mind of god they were
[1:10:16] identified together
[1:10:18] right because he knew that jesus had to
[1:10:22] come through mary so before the
[1:10:25] beginning
[1:10:26] before the beginning in the mind of god
[1:10:28] these two
[1:10:29] attributes were together and so
[1:10:32] is it with you and i
[1:10:36] that you and i were identified
[1:10:39] in the mind of god with this message
[1:10:42] and this word of god that one day
[1:10:46] somewhere this word and you
[1:10:49] will come together by the will and
[1:10:52] purpose and plan of god because
[1:10:55] this is what he had in his mind from
[1:10:57] before the foundation
[1:10:59] of the world hallelujah so
[1:11:03] we find that this body of truth
[1:11:07] that we call or know as the message
[1:11:11] had to be here so that we could identify
[1:11:16] with it praise the lord and
[1:11:19] we were ordained by god
[1:11:22] to recognize each other the message will
[1:11:25] recognize you
[1:11:27] and you will recognize it and there will
[1:11:30] be
[1:11:32] a resurrection of recognition
[1:11:36] and that's what i'm talking about
[1:11:38] briefly here today
[1:11:39] by the grace of god and i wish those in
[1:11:42] the back
[1:11:42] will take note of that and place the
[1:11:46] name of this sermon on the internet when
[1:11:49] this goes
[1:11:50] up by the grace of god the resurrection
[1:11:53] of recognition praise god
[1:11:57] hallelujah oh praise god
[1:12:00] now that is why
[1:12:05] all of our life even before we were
[1:12:08] christians
[1:12:09] we were always finding ourselves
[1:12:11] different
[1:12:13] or we were searching and we didn't know
[1:12:15] what we were searching for
[1:12:18] no matter what we did we
[1:12:21] we never could feel satisfied
[1:12:24] we couldn't feel fulfilled because
[1:12:28] something in us that we were unconscious
[1:12:31] of
[1:12:32] was searching to find something that
[1:12:35] will
[1:12:36] bring satisfaction bring fulfillment
[1:12:40] to us and we could never find it
[1:12:43] now i won't go down the list because you
[1:12:45] know you have other preachers can do
[1:12:47] that
[1:12:47] and say you know you were into drugs you
[1:12:49] were into this you were into that you
[1:12:51] tried that you tried this you tried the
[1:12:52] other
[1:12:53] your spirit is searching everywhere
[1:12:56] but there it is my friend that we
[1:13:00] were there searching to find this great
[1:13:04] word amen hallelujah
[1:13:07] now what it was was just this message
[1:13:10] and the moment that i found this true
[1:13:13] message of god for this
[1:13:15] hour my it's just like i let off the
[1:13:18] pressure
[1:13:20] hey man praise god now let me make this
[1:13:23] straight
[1:13:24] not when i first came in the message of
[1:13:26] course i was like everybody
[1:13:28] i was just slinging rocks and slashing
[1:13:32] with my sword and chopping everything in
[1:13:34] sight
[1:13:34] and fighting the devil and doing
[1:13:37] whatever i have to do
[1:13:38] like that but then as the spirit of god
[1:13:41] began to teach you
[1:13:42] mold you and everything else you'll find
[1:13:45] out that
[1:13:46] you only use the sword when god tells
[1:13:48] you to
[1:13:49] you don't do anything unless he tells
[1:13:51] you to
[1:13:52] other than that you just hold to god's
[1:13:56] unchanging
[1:13:56] hand amen now in the mind of god
[1:14:00] these two thoughts of you and the
[1:14:03] message
[1:14:04] knew one another before you even got
[1:14:08] here
[1:14:09] you knew each other back there in the
[1:14:12] very
[1:14:13] mind of god and you were searching
[1:14:17] and you didn't know what you were
[1:14:19] searching for hallelujah
[1:14:21] because the body was searching for its
[1:14:23] head
[1:14:24] and you were searching to find the word
[1:14:27] that would lead you enough preeminence
[1:14:29] over you and to be able to guide you
[1:14:32] through your life
[1:14:32] amen hallelujah you don't you were
[1:14:36] unconscious of course
[1:14:37] because none of us knew what we were
[1:14:39] searching for what we were longing for
[1:14:42] and what we were watching for
[1:14:45] hallelujah but thank god we found the
[1:14:48] the message found us or brother branham
[1:14:52] puts this this way
[1:14:53] your theophany found you amen
[1:14:56] your theophany found you but you see
[1:15:00] once i heard this message maybe the same
[1:15:02] with you
[1:15:04] i don't know what it was but i could
[1:15:07] sense
[1:15:08] something different i could sense
[1:15:11] a connection i could sense
[1:15:15] something there within me
[1:15:18] it seems like i had heard this
[1:15:21] before it seems as if i had
[1:15:25] seen it before but i don't know where
[1:15:28] it seems to me brother sister
[1:15:33] that i could sense an unconscious
[1:15:37] affinity with what i was hearing coming
[1:15:40] out of the prophet
[1:15:42] it connected in other words with
[1:15:45] something inside of here
[1:15:47] and i couldn't put it into english or to
[1:15:50] be able
[1:15:50] to explain it to you what i'm telling
[1:15:53] you here
[1:15:54] now um maybe others have said it but i'm
[1:15:57] telling you what the holy spirit has
[1:15:59] been speaking to me over this past week
[1:16:02] and and putting into my soul here and
[1:16:05] i'm just bringing that to you here now
[1:16:07] by the grace of god hallelujah an
[1:16:09] unconscious
[1:16:10] affinity within me that's why the
[1:16:14] prophet said when
[1:16:15] there the true seed hear this message he
[1:16:18] said they'll take to it like a
[1:16:20] duck to water because it's their nature
[1:16:23] it's just their nature they can't avoid
[1:16:25] it hallelujah praise
[1:16:27] god amen praise god let's look at this
[1:16:31] word
[1:16:32] recognize and
[1:16:35] you know you can see today i'm a little
[1:16:37] slower
[1:16:38] and i'm deliberately being slower
[1:16:41] i looked on the dictionary.com on
[1:16:44] the internet and it says
[1:16:48] to recognize is to identify
[1:16:53] something someone
[1:16:57] or somewhere that was
[1:17:00] previously seen or
[1:17:03] known by you the individual
[1:17:07] or you could not recognize it
[1:17:11] amen you had to know it before
[1:17:14] you had to see it before you had to be
[1:17:18] in that place
[1:17:19] before or else you could
[1:17:22] not recognize it do you recognize
[1:17:26] your day and the message for your day
[1:17:29] do you recognize this christ hallelujah
[1:17:33] amen amen praise god we were
[1:17:37] there in the mind of god and we
[1:17:40] had some affinity with this word already
[1:17:44] but we did not recognize it for a reason
[1:17:48] which i will further touch upon now
[1:17:51] in biochemistry
[1:17:54] recognize means
[1:17:58] to bind two objects together
[1:18:02] to unite with
[1:18:06] recognized means one substance
[1:18:10] recognizes the other substance
[1:18:13] that they would fit together
[1:18:16] and thus are of two molecular
[1:18:20] shapes or structures will be
[1:18:23] able to fit and bind and
[1:18:26] they have the word there and cleave
[1:18:29] together
[1:18:30] praise god oh my
[1:18:33] your nighting time praise god amen the
[1:18:37] invisible union of the pride
[1:18:40] when this g inside of you recognizes the
[1:18:43] word
[1:18:44] it brings about the union praise god
[1:18:47] because something in you recognizes the
[1:18:50] word for your day
[1:18:51] and a message for your day hallelujah
[1:18:55] and there is beyond the chemical
[1:18:57] reaction
[1:18:58] amen because that's another things here
[1:19:02] they said some something
[1:19:05] that all of the same substance
[1:19:09] that will fit hallelujah
[1:19:13] recognize each other
[1:19:16] and those substances are able to
[1:19:20] blend together as one they can blend
[1:19:23] together
[1:19:24] me and jesus we got a good thing going
[1:19:27] oh my
[1:19:28] praise god god in christ christ in the
[1:19:31] church
[1:19:32] amen the kingdom coming back together
[1:19:35] again
[1:19:36] by the grace of god oh may god give us a
[1:19:39] resurrection
[1:19:40] in our hearts us recognition
[1:19:44] of him the word of god for this day
[1:19:47] and our amen so with all those remarks
[1:19:53] i have been saying that to say that for
[1:19:57] you to
[1:19:58] recognize something you have had to
[1:20:01] or somebody or recognize a place
[1:20:05] or somewhere you had to have seen it
[1:20:08] before
[1:20:10] you have had to have been there before
[1:20:13] you have to have heard it before
[1:20:17] or not beforehand hallelujah
[1:20:20] or be familiar with it or you won't be
[1:20:23] able to recognize it
[1:20:25] or praise god you say how do you know
[1:20:28] that because i got a garden shed in the
[1:20:30] back of my house and in that shed
[1:20:33] i got shovels i got forks
[1:20:38] i got uh a pick and other things in
[1:20:42] there i got saws for
[1:20:43] cutting branches on trees it's all there
[1:20:46] but now here you come
[1:20:49] you don't know anything about any of
[1:20:52] those tools
[1:20:54] and i'm outside with you and we're
[1:20:55] talking and everything else and i just
[1:20:57] turned around and said
[1:20:58] oh don't get me a shovel there and i
[1:21:01] keep working keep working when i look
[1:21:03] around
[1:21:03] you come up to me and you got a fork in
[1:21:05] your hand
[1:21:07] so what are you doing with the fork i
[1:21:08] sent you for a shovel
[1:21:11] right but you see that person doesn't
[1:21:14] know
[1:21:15] what a chef list to begin with so how
[1:21:18] they're going to recognize it
[1:21:19] even if they see it
[1:21:22] when you look what do you see
[1:21:26] what do you recognize you're looking at
[1:21:28] the same word i'm looking at but what do
[1:21:30] you
[1:21:31] recognize because of something the gene
[1:21:34] whatever is in you it's never been there
[1:21:38] it doesn't know the person it's not
[1:21:40] familiar with the place
[1:21:42] so how could it recognize now here
[1:21:45] even if the thing is right in front of
[1:21:47] you right in front of you
[1:21:48] you will recognize it because you are
[1:21:51] not there to begin with jesus said
[1:21:54] no man can go up to heaven unless he
[1:21:57] first came down from heaven
[1:22:00] you can't do it it's impossible praise
[1:22:03] god
[1:22:04] amen oh my brother sister
[1:22:07] how will you know what
[1:22:10] the gene of god in you is
[1:22:14] looking for amen i want to
[1:22:17] ask you how did nathaniel
[1:22:21] know what his soul
[1:22:24] inside was really looking for
[1:22:28] amen because when he came in contact
[1:22:32] with jesus
[1:22:33] something about jesus seemed familiar to
[1:22:37] him
[1:22:38] his spirit he in him was familiar with
[1:22:42] what he was hearing what he was seeing
[1:22:45] oh may god help you to recognize what
[1:22:48] you are hearing
[1:22:49] what you are seeing and just don't look
[1:22:52] at me but
[1:22:53] look at the word of god
[1:22:56] hallelujah amen praise
[1:22:59] god amen i tell your friends
[1:23:03] you remember brother branham's life
[1:23:05] story he said when he was a boy
[1:23:07] he was fetching water to go to the house
[1:23:10] and he's going to pass a
[1:23:12] a big pine tree and out of the branches
[1:23:15] of the tree you know he heard a voice
[1:23:19] speaking and the voice speaking and
[1:23:22] telling him
[1:23:23] not to defile yourself don't you smoke
[1:23:26] nor drink
[1:23:27] for i have great work for you to do
[1:23:30] amen many many years later now he's
[1:23:34] praying
[1:23:35] in his prayer room in his house
[1:23:39] and while he's praying there praying
[1:23:41] there
[1:23:42] all of a sudden a light appeared
[1:23:45] above him in the room and he's wondering
[1:23:49] to know what it was
[1:23:51] and then the light grows bigger and
[1:23:53] bigger and bigger
[1:23:55] and out of the light steps a man
[1:23:58] right and you know a lot of people will
[1:24:01] think those things that these things
[1:24:03] brother branham told her like stories
[1:24:06] but i'm going to insert myself in here
[1:24:08] and whatever you want to think about it
[1:24:10] that's up to you
[1:24:12] but when i heard about this message just
[1:24:14] about 18 years
[1:24:16] old and i started to preach it
[1:24:19] in the town where my wife is from
[1:24:23] and the holy spirit began to move and
[1:24:25] revival broke out
[1:24:28] oh we would be fellowshipping late in
[1:24:32] the night myself and the brothers
[1:24:34] standing on a bridge and we're talking
[1:24:36] and there's a bush behind them and i'm
[1:24:38] facing them and we're talking
[1:24:40] and out of that bush comes up
[1:24:43] light about 18 inches across like that
[1:24:47] and it's moving slowly it's not in no
[1:24:50] hurry it's moving slow
[1:24:52] and i i'm just wondering maybe because
[1:24:55] we
[1:24:55] read about the message so much in here
[1:24:57] about the prophet
[1:24:58] i'm i'm seeing this so this
[1:25:02] so i didn't tell them i just turned i
[1:25:04] said brothers just
[1:25:06] step back a little bit and look tell me
[1:25:08] if you see anything
[1:25:09] and they when they turn around oh what
[1:25:11] what what is that
[1:25:13] they were they were seeing it too but
[1:25:15] then i thought i said well all of us
[1:25:17] believe the message maybe because we
[1:25:19] read it and we study it and we talk
[1:25:20] about it so much
[1:25:21] we're imagining things so my
[1:25:25] aunt's house was like where the
[1:25:27] neighbor's house is
[1:25:29] and i went over there to to them and
[1:25:31] this was like midnight
[1:25:33] uh and i knocked on the door bang bang
[1:25:35] bang and they came out in their night
[1:25:37] clothing you know
[1:25:39] five six of them said what's the matter
[1:25:41] boy what's what's wrong
[1:25:42] i said can you look and tell me if you
[1:25:45] see anything
[1:25:46] amen and they looked and when they look
[1:25:48] like oh my god what is that
[1:25:50] what is that so the five six of them who
[1:25:54] don't believe the message they are
[1:25:56] nobody convinced by nothing
[1:25:59] right and they could see it
[1:26:02] and apparently this being and i call it
[1:26:06] a being
[1:26:07] because once it was moving slow and
[1:26:10] waiting and once they come
[1:26:11] out and they could see it that's just to
[1:26:14] get me confident
[1:26:15] and for me to know this is just saith
[1:26:18] the lord
[1:26:20] once they became aware of that that
[1:26:22] thing suddenly went
[1:26:24] and went up into the heavens and just
[1:26:27] went up
[1:26:27] among the stars and disappeared and that
[1:26:30] was the end of it
[1:26:31] so i am not talking about this just
[1:26:33] because i read it
[1:26:34] in the book i am telling you because it
[1:26:38] is the truth
[1:26:40] and because i personally experience it
[1:26:43] but brother branham heard that voice
[1:26:47] in the bush and years later when he's in
[1:26:51] a man
[1:26:52] he's a man out of this light steps a
[1:26:55] person a man hallelujah
[1:26:59] said and his face and picture
[1:27:02] had no beard not like the one they have
[1:27:05] pictures of jesus
[1:27:07] but he stepped right out of the light
[1:27:10] and said fear not i'm set from the
[1:27:13] presence of almighty god
[1:27:15] to tell you that your peculiar life and
[1:27:18] ministry and he began to
[1:27:20] declare to him he said the moment that
[1:27:23] angel began to speak i recognized
[1:27:27] that it was the same voice that called
[1:27:29] to me from within the bush
[1:27:31] when he was a boy he recognizes the same
[1:27:35] voice
[1:27:36] hallelujah praise god it's the same way
[1:27:39] brother sisters
[1:27:41] no matter what form it comes in wherever
[1:27:44] you are
[1:27:44] how long it takes when you hear that
[1:27:47] genuine real voice
[1:27:49] you know it's thus saith the lord as the
[1:27:52] voice of god in these last days
[1:27:55] nobody has to convince you and i'm not
[1:27:57] here to convince anybody
[1:28:00] amen my struggling is over because
[1:28:03] god keeps his own god speaks to his own
[1:28:07] god straightens his own hallelujah and
[1:28:10] we just teach the word of god here
[1:28:12] by the glory of god hallelujah amen
[1:28:15] yes sir oh praise god now
[1:28:18] we go back to the scriptures john 10
[1:28:23] jesus said my sheep know my voice
[1:28:28] hallelujah and a stranger they will not
[1:28:30] follow
[1:28:31] well the sheep never met him until he
[1:28:34] came down to earth
[1:28:36] those few sheep that he had back there
[1:28:38] they only met him when he came to work
[1:28:40] how are they going to know him if they
[1:28:42] never met him before
[1:28:44] but you see he said in another place i
[1:28:47] had joy with you
[1:28:48] before the foundations of the earth
[1:28:51] before you even knew it i knew you
[1:28:55] and i had joy with you praise god so
[1:28:59] my sheep now he's not talking only of
[1:29:01] those 12 that were back there
[1:29:03] throughout the rest of the ages they're
[1:29:05] gonna know my voice
[1:29:07] why they're gonna know my voice because
[1:29:10] the resurrection of supernatural
[1:29:14] recognition within them is going to take
[1:29:17] place
[1:29:17] and they're going to recognize they
[1:29:20] didn't just come now
[1:29:22] but that they were back there before the
[1:29:25] foundations of the world
[1:29:26] that's why they could hear it recognize
[1:29:29] it see it
[1:29:30] and know what it is amen and that's why
[1:29:33] you are here today
[1:29:34] not because of me but you are here
[1:29:36] because of something in your soul
[1:29:39] look after i'm gone from this place
[1:29:42] praise
[1:29:43] god by his grace i thank god for
[1:29:45] excellent help that god is keeping me
[1:29:49] and i i'd like to boast a little bit on
[1:29:51] my age i'm 76
[1:29:54] uh 70 yes i'll be 76 in a few days
[1:29:58] and uh then i'm on on the road praise
[1:30:02] god
[1:30:02] but let me tell you something praise god
[1:30:06] about the time that i am going to and
[1:30:08] you better prepare yourself and pray
[1:30:10] about this
[1:30:11] i'm going to have to hand over the
[1:30:13] leadership
[1:30:14] and reigns of this church you don't want
[1:30:17] me
[1:30:17] to keep preaching until i'm old and
[1:30:20] decorated
[1:30:22] and and they have to wheel me up in a
[1:30:24] wheelchair
[1:30:26] and i'm saying and the lord said
[1:30:30] no you don't want that to happen
[1:30:34] amen praise the lord so i'm going to
[1:30:37] have to place this responsibility on
[1:30:40] somebody else's shoulders
[1:30:43] in my mind let me say that way right now
[1:30:47] i believe it's going to fall on brother
[1:30:49] uh danny missy
[1:30:52] i believe it's going to fall on his
[1:30:53] shoulders now if god wants something
[1:30:56] different that's in god's hands
[1:30:57] but i'm just telling you what i think
[1:31:00] praise the lord
[1:31:02] so brothers this whole thing is not
[1:31:06] built on me
[1:31:07] this is built on him the word
[1:31:12] and i'm just saying that long after
[1:31:15] i am gone which i'm not hustling to go
[1:31:18] away too soon
[1:31:20] let me say because you got to watch what
[1:31:22] you say these days
[1:31:23] i don't want god to take me at my word
[1:31:26] lord
[1:31:27] you know a lot of christians do that you
[1:31:29] know lord i'm ready to go
[1:31:32] oh you're ready okay
[1:31:36] i'll call you tonight oh no no
[1:31:39] everybody wants to go to heaven nobody
[1:31:41] wants to die
[1:31:43] how are you going to get to heaven right
[1:31:46] see so
[1:31:46] we we just just understand what i'm
[1:31:49] trying to say
[1:31:51] praise the lord brother sister
[1:31:55] that how will the sheep know his voice
[1:31:58] the sheep will know my voice
[1:32:02] now because of a shock
[1:32:06] that the human race had through a
[1:32:09] spiritual
[1:32:10] car crash is the way i'd like to uh
[1:32:13] visualize it you know people get car
[1:32:16] crashing they get their
[1:32:17] neck and their back and different things
[1:32:20] happen to them
[1:32:21] some lose their mind they lose their
[1:32:23] memory
[1:32:25] everything else well the human race went
[1:32:27] through something like that
[1:32:29] and because of that shock amen
[1:32:33] our memories have been darkened
[1:32:38] brother branham said it in the future
[1:32:40] home of the heavenly bride
[1:32:42] and bridegroom he said only jesus
[1:32:45] was the only person because he was god
[1:32:49] when he come down here he knows full
[1:32:51] well
[1:32:52] everything that happened from before the
[1:32:54] foundation of the world
[1:32:55] right on down but the rest of us he said
[1:32:58] our minds were darkened
[1:33:02] we're not allowed to remember
[1:33:05] what took place before the foundations
[1:33:09] of the world right but if you are a part
[1:33:13] of
[1:33:13] his people or you are part of him and
[1:33:16] you are
[1:33:17] in him then you were there but it was
[1:33:20] not it's not time
[1:33:22] for you to remember because the sin of
[1:33:25] adam and eve
[1:33:26] so shocked us that it caused us to go
[1:33:29] into that state
[1:33:30] which is called spiritual amnesia
[1:33:36] back again listen amnesia
[1:33:40] the loss of a large
[1:33:43] block of memories
[1:33:47] it is a complete or partial
[1:33:51] loss of your memories
[1:33:54] caused by some shock
[1:33:58] or brain injury we can't even remember
[1:34:02] who we are some of us came in the world
[1:34:05] and we said we'll drink the ramen throw
[1:34:08] in the bottle
[1:34:08] and enjoy ourselves with the high wine
[1:34:12] and
[1:34:12] enjoy ourselves with the johnny walker
[1:34:14] whiskey and everything else
[1:34:16] because we want to act like a pig
[1:34:19] act like the world dance like the world
[1:34:21] carry on like the world
[1:34:23] because that's who we thought we were
[1:34:26] because we were in a state of spiritual
[1:34:27] amnesia
[1:34:30] and that's what we thought we were and
[1:34:32] we carried on
[1:34:33] that way amen we can't even remember
[1:34:37] when we finish enjoying ourselves and
[1:34:39] everything else and we want to go back
[1:34:40] home
[1:34:41] we don't even know where our home is
[1:34:44] we go wandering all around the streets
[1:34:47] wondering where is your home
[1:34:49] right like that and we end up many of us
[1:34:51] end up in the gutters
[1:34:53] we end up in all kinds of places
[1:34:55] unseemly places
[1:34:57] at the time it seemed okay in your mind
[1:35:00] and
[1:35:00] in your mind's eyes uh like that
[1:35:04] you you pass by all friends that you
[1:35:08] used to have fellowship with
[1:35:10] and joy with amen before the foundations
[1:35:14] you walk right past them you don't
[1:35:16] recognize them anymore

[1:35:20] amnesia

[1:36:40] and bring to your remembrance but the

[1:49:57] [Music]
[1:50:02] praise god we're happy to be here today
[1:50:06] for this marvelous and wonderful
[1:50:09] dedication and it is my prayer
[1:50:13] that the great holy spirit will bless
[1:50:16] not only the child
[1:50:18] but the entire family
[1:50:21] after this maybe in
[1:50:24] a week's time you'll be able to receive
[1:50:27] a
[1:50:28] dedication certificate okay
[1:50:31] [Music]
[1:50:34] as you of course god has used you to
[1:50:38] bring this
[1:50:39] child in to the world but that only
[1:50:42] proves that you're a man
[1:50:44] and that she's a woman that is different
[1:50:47] from being a mother
[1:50:49] and a father that's another
[1:50:52] part of the entire journey that we have
[1:50:55] on this earth
[1:50:56] that that's the protection the provision
[1:50:59] and so on
[1:51:00] all those various things amen
[1:51:03] so we pray that god will help you to
[1:51:06] take
[1:51:07] the now parental responsibility
[1:51:11] that we all must take uh for
[1:51:14] for our journey here on earth
[1:51:18] the dedication of this child is not
[1:51:21] to dedicate the child and then
[1:51:24] you are bond on the child because i i
[1:51:27] place the child in god's hand so now god
[1:51:29] is going to take care of it
[1:51:30] no we don't a bond on the child we place
[1:51:34] the child in god's hand
[1:51:35] because we're asking for his help
[1:51:38] because if
[1:51:39] in no other day or in no other time
[1:51:43] in this time that we are living in
[1:51:46] every parent including myself we need
[1:51:50] help
[1:51:52] we need god's help because we are not
[1:51:55] able to
[1:51:56] raise these kids by of by ourselves
[1:51:59] you cannot watch them 24 7.
[1:52:02] you can't know what is in their thoughts
[1:52:05] the times are changing
[1:52:07] the age is changing
[1:52:10] sometimes we don't even know what
[1:52:13] they're thinking
[1:52:14] because they don't think like us anymore
[1:52:17] everything is
[1:52:17] changed so we must ask for god's
[1:52:21] help and so this great
[1:52:24] uh experience here at this altar
[1:52:28] is asking for the direction of god
[1:52:32] to come upon the child but don't forget
[1:52:35] you are the trainer you are the coach
[1:52:39] you are the example you are the one
[1:52:43] that the child will be looking up
[1:52:46] looking on
[1:52:47] and taking their imprint in their mind
[1:52:50] and mentality
[1:52:51] their whole character and their
[1:52:53] environment is going to shape
[1:52:55] them and so we must take
[1:52:59] that responsibility that we will do the
[1:53:03] best we can we can only do the best
[1:53:05] we can and with god's help
[1:53:08] that he will help us to be what we are
[1:53:11] supposed to be
[1:53:13] we can't escape from that amen
[1:53:16] and the bible tells us proverbs 22 6
[1:53:21] train up a child in the way he should go
[1:53:25] and when he is old they will not
[1:53:28] depart from it that is supposed to be
[1:53:31] old-fashioned
[1:53:32] the modern way is to leave them in the
[1:53:34] school teach them
[1:53:35] psychology and and let them have their
[1:53:38] way
[1:53:39] but i am sorry i was raised the
[1:53:41] old-fashioned way with the old switch
[1:53:43] named john and when my father said
[1:53:46] bring me john from off the wall there
[1:53:49] you know what's going to happen
[1:53:51] so therefore with that old-fashioned
[1:53:54] training i don't think it
[1:53:56] spoiled me or did me anything or damaged
[1:53:58] me mentally or in any way
[1:54:00] right never mind the bible doesn't tell
[1:54:02] us to abuse
[1:54:03] but he says we need to discipline we
[1:54:05] need to train
[1:54:06] these children up in the grace
[1:54:10] of god hallelujah amen
[1:54:14] jesus when he was young said to mary
[1:54:16] wish you
[1:54:17] not i must be about my father's business
[1:54:21] amen praise god and so
[1:54:24] god is asking you to engage yourself
[1:54:27] in a tax-free job of
[1:54:31] child rearing you're not going to be
[1:54:34] paid for this
[1:54:35] financially paid for it but
[1:54:38] um every seed draws to itself its own
[1:54:42] blessing
[1:54:43] just a natural seed goes in the ground
[1:54:46] you know it pulls like they said about
[1:54:48] about six feet away that seed starts
[1:54:50] pulling nutrients to itself
[1:54:52] spiritually speaking every child
[1:54:55] literally
[1:54:56] does the same thing it begins to draw
[1:54:59] to the parents blessings
[1:55:03] not for the parent's sake but for that
[1:55:05] child's sake it starts
[1:55:06] pulling it and drawing it to itself so
[1:55:08] that the parents are able to sustain
[1:55:11] raise and grow that child in the fear
[1:55:14] and grace of god it's a full-time
[1:55:18] job and it's really going to tax your
[1:55:20] patience
[1:55:22] praise the lord hallelujah
[1:55:25] i hope you're not in a hurry because we
[1:55:27] live in a day where everything got to be
[1:55:28] quick fast quit
[1:55:29] russia rush the rest there but the god
[1:55:32] doesn't work that way
[1:55:33] right isn't that true right
[1:55:37] bible tells us foolishness is bound up
[1:55:41] in the heart of a child
[1:55:43] but the rod of correction
[1:55:46] shall drive it far from them
[1:55:50] so we need discipline from time to time
[1:55:55] look i was watching the tv and some
[1:55:58] homeless kids down in toronto some of
[1:56:00] them were crying to the reporter
[1:56:02] and saying oh when i look at my friends
[1:56:05] when their parents come and find them in
[1:56:07] the street and take them back home and
[1:56:08] crying over them
[1:56:10] oh i i wish my parents would come and
[1:56:13] correct me
[1:56:14] and and come and pull me or what they
[1:56:17] actually want the parent to correct them
[1:56:21] they actually want the parent to tell
[1:56:23] them right
[1:56:24] even when they might act like they don't
[1:56:26] want to hear but they're still
[1:56:28] listening you just have to share with
[1:56:31] them
[1:56:31] what you know and then let god do the
[1:56:34] rest
[1:56:34] as i tell the church here do your best
[1:56:38] and then let god do the rest that's all
[1:56:40] you can do
[1:56:41] is to do your best right so god
[1:56:45] spirit is actually wanting you to
[1:56:48] go through a training course of your
[1:56:51] life here
[1:56:52] um and to train this child
[1:56:56] by his grace so you brought this child
[1:56:59] to the
[1:56:59] this altar for dedication
[1:57:02] and you must be conscious through divine
[1:57:05] revelation
[1:57:06] of god's purpose and plan not just
[1:57:10] for the child but for you amen
[1:57:13] and that god will raise you all
[1:57:16] up listen john 16 he will show you
[1:57:19] things to come
[1:57:21] he will glorify me he shall receive of
[1:57:25] mine
[1:57:26] and show it unto you all things that the
[1:57:29] father had
[1:57:30] our mind therefore said i he shall take
[1:57:33] of mine
[1:57:34] and show it unto you
[1:57:37] amen praise god thank god
[1:57:40] god knew like i just finished preaching
[1:57:42] that this child would be here
[1:57:44] and god just used you to bring that
[1:57:47] child
[1:57:48] here right but before this child was
[1:57:51] there physically
[1:57:52] it was in god spiritually but he had to
[1:57:55] get it here and he had to use somebody
[1:57:56] to get it here
[1:57:58] but it's here now and he's saying while
[1:58:00] it's here
[1:58:01] this is something that i want you to
[1:58:03] take care
[1:58:04] of amen praise god hallelujah
[1:58:07] so brother sisters recognize this
[1:58:11] amen god said to abraham
[1:58:15] i know abraham that he will
[1:58:18] command and train his children and his
[1:58:20] household
[1:58:21] after him and they shall keep the way of
[1:58:24] the lord
[1:58:25] to do justice and judgment
[1:58:29] amen the privilege of parenthood
[1:58:33] i say privilege because lots of people
[1:58:36] that i know of
[1:58:38] spend their whole life wanting one
[1:58:41] one grain we say one child
[1:58:44] and they weren't able to get it right
[1:58:48] so it's a privilege of parenthood
[1:58:52] when god could bless you that way it's
[1:58:54] also our honor
[1:58:56] that god would select you to do that
[1:59:00] amen and also
[1:59:03] their wits for you great rewards
[1:59:06] at the end of the road because the your
[1:59:10] greatest
[1:59:10] legacy is if you grow
[1:59:14] old enough like me let's say that
[1:59:17] you know you get all like me and you end
[1:59:19] up having children and grandchildren
[1:59:22] then you can look at them with pride
[1:59:26] you can look at them and say well you
[1:59:29] know
[1:59:30] like myself i know i made a lot of
[1:59:32] mistakes i could have done things better
[1:59:35] but what is done is done but the best
[1:59:38] that i did
[1:59:39] i did the best i could the rest is in
[1:59:41] god's hand
[1:59:42] nothing else i can do about it but now i
[1:59:45] can pray for them at least
[1:59:47] i can advise them if they want advice
[1:59:49] but it's really all
[1:59:51] in god's hand amen praise the name of
[1:59:54] the lord
[1:59:55] and god will reward you moreover it is
[1:59:58] required in stewards
[1:59:59] that a man be found faithful
[2:00:03] amen and god said that he
[2:00:06] you will give account of your
[2:00:08] stewardship for
[2:00:10] thou mayest be no longer assured
[2:00:13] amen so it's important that god bless
[2:00:16] you
[2:00:17] that god sanctify your walk
[2:00:20] and that god will sanctify your home
[2:00:23] god would sanctify your union god will
[2:00:26] sanctify
[2:00:26] the child god will bless the entire
[2:00:29] family
[2:00:30] because a family is a support system
[2:00:32] it's a blanket support system
[2:00:35] telling you without speaking you're not
[2:00:38] on your own your daddy is here your
[2:00:40] mommy is here
[2:00:42] you know your uncle you you're on
[2:00:44] they're here
[2:00:45] they're not saying it but by their very
[2:00:48] presence they're telling you
[2:00:49] we are a support system so you have a
[2:00:53] problem don't keep it by yourself
[2:00:56] just talk about it you know praise god
[2:01:00] uh choose somebody in the family you
[2:01:01] know you could have personal talk with
[2:01:04] and
[2:01:04] share what's in your heart and then pray
[2:01:07] together
[2:01:08] and god will make a way somehow right so
[2:01:11] i commit you as pastor into the hands of
[2:01:14] god
[2:01:15] and that god would lead and guide both
[2:01:18] of you and strengthen you
[2:01:19] in your divine walk of course let me
[2:01:22] give you the name of the child
[2:01:24] malaya siree moore
