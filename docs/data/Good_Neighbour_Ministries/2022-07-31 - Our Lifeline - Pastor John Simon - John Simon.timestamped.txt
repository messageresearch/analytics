[45:53] by your presence and by your spirit
[45:57] i pray lord
[45:59] that day
[46:01] earnestness
[46:02] the sincerity
[46:04] the genuine love and
[46:07] revelation
[46:08] from out of the word of god
[46:11] will sweep over our souls
[46:14] and carry us away
[46:17] into the great beyond
[46:19] may you take glory and honor in jesus
[46:21] name amen praise the lord god bless you
[46:24] real good please be seated
[46:36] now we have all been made aware
[46:40] that the great holy spirit
[46:44] uh has
[46:47] brought us out
[46:49] of our spiritual amnesia
[46:54] and made us aware
[46:56] uh by revelation
[47:00] that we didn't just got saved on this
[47:03] particular day in this certain year in
[47:06] this time in this age
[47:08] but that we were already in him
[47:12] before the foundation of the world
[47:16] we were always in eternity but we only
[47:20] now
[47:21] found out
[47:23] we only now found out
[47:25] uh that we were already in him
[47:28] we were taught we were thinking or we
[47:31] were taught
[47:32] that we now have to do something
[47:35] religious to be able to get in him
[47:38] to get in his graces
[47:41] to get into his love
[47:43] to come into his presence
[47:45] we had to do something religious some
[47:48] act some work some something to show
[47:52] that uh you know
[47:54] it's now happening but i'm here to tell
[47:57] you that it's not now happening he has
[47:59] now made us aware that we were already
[48:03] in him
[48:05] we're already in him
[48:07] before the foundation of the world that
[48:11] is let's say let's use a human term
[48:14] eternity past there's no such thing but
[48:17] i use that so you can understand in
[48:19] eternity past we were always in him from
[48:23] before the foundation of the world
[48:27] but now he is bringing us out in another
[48:30] phase of coming out of that spirit uh
[48:34] spiritual amnesia
[48:37] that not only has he brought us
[48:40] uh the revelation that we were already
[48:44] in him
[48:45] uh we were always there in him
[48:48] but he is now wanting to emphasize to us
[48:53] that not only that but we
[48:56] now
[48:57] have him
[48:58] in us
[49:00] the whole god of eternity
[49:03] in us
[49:05] now how can your mind understand that
[49:08] that god in you
[49:11] praise god and i'm so thankful
[49:14] that we
[49:15] are happy that he is in us praise god
[49:20] before there was a world before there
[49:23] was a moon before there were any stars
[49:26] before there was anything
[49:28] we were already in him and we had the
[49:33] word of god
[49:35] in us praise the lord it's not now
[49:38] coming in either it was always there
[49:41] within us praise god hallelujah and
[49:45] coming into that realization
[49:47] we are now able to manifest that word
[49:51] through our lives
[49:53] or the word can manifest itself that it
[49:57] is alive once again in us making itself
[50:01] known hallelujah
[50:03] and he
[50:04] by that manifestation
[50:07] is identifying you
[50:10] and i that you and i are a part
[50:15] of his great body
[50:18] that you are one little portion in this
[50:21] age
[50:22] that he has made aware of who you are
[50:26] and he is identifying you
[50:29] by showing that you have an ear to hear
[50:33] by your
[50:34] reception of revelation
[50:38] and that reception of revelation
[50:42] shows that you are a part of the body
[50:46] you're a brick in solomon's temple
[50:49] natural pointing that you're a part of
[50:52] the body
[50:54] spiritual
[50:55] but now that the body has come to
[50:58] realization of who and what it is
[51:02] it's now finding its place in the temple
[51:05] it's finding its place in god
[51:09] and being positionally placed by the
[51:12] holy spirit
[51:14] praise the lord now before we used to be
[51:17] taught many things that you have to know
[51:20] you have to know your position you have
[51:24] to be placed here place in this position
[51:28] now we're telling you or i'm showing
[51:30] from the word of god the word of god is
[51:33] telling us we don't have to do that
[51:37] we just come to know who we are
[51:40] we just get a revelation of god's
[51:42] program
[51:44] and that he is now placing us
[51:46] positionally where we are supposed to be
[51:52] and that's why a true son or daughter of
[51:54] god knows regardless of what the
[51:56] conditions are around you
[51:59] you are
[52:00] where you are because that's where
[52:02] you're supposed to be for this time it
[52:05] may change you may take you out to that
[52:06] and put you in another position but it's
[52:09] moving the holy spirit is moving all the
[52:12] time and fulfilling his word
[52:15] now
[52:16] listen closely remember
[52:19] think of it
[52:21] the people born of his spirit
[52:24] in a day like this just stop there do
[52:27] you
[52:28] a day like this a sodomite
[52:31] day
[52:33] a day of gomorrah
[52:35] a day like noah had
[52:38] that anything could be born again in a
[52:40] thing like that
[52:42] was that not just like when jesus was
[52:44] born can anything good thing come out of
[52:47] nazareth
[52:48] can anything good come out of that issue
[52:51] what can come out of this wicked and
[52:53] evil generation that we are living in
[52:57] but god for purpose that he will have a
[53:00] bride
[53:02] it's not what the bride does to take
[53:04] herself out but he already planned and
[53:07] purpose it that i'm gonna have a bride
[53:10] regardless of corrupt how wicked how
[53:12] messed up and muddled up and insane the
[53:16] age becomes i'm gonna bring out a bride
[53:19] that's pure without spot without wrinkle
[53:22] blameless justified in my presence by
[53:26] the word of god hallelujah amen
[53:30] people born of a spirit in an age
[53:35] like this
[53:36] in this great denominational age we are
[53:40] living in the distinction there is the
[53:42] age we are living in natural and the
[53:45] spiritual age we're living in that's so
[53:48] filled with denominational religious
[53:50] pollution
[53:52] and yet you are able to become out
[53:57] changed and freed and washed by the
[54:00] blood of jesus christ to live an upright
[54:02] life to live a righteous life to live a
[54:05] life that god wants you to live
[54:08] hallelujah
[54:10] amen you see
[54:13] it's the living god
[54:15] taking his living word
[54:19] you and me that's what he's talking
[54:21] about
[54:22] and vindicating it personally
[54:26] see
[54:26] this life
[54:29] that's in you
[54:30] that's in the word see
[54:33] is a germ
[54:35] it's a seed
[54:37] that was placed in that word
[54:40] and that makes it the living word for
[54:42] the germ is in the seed
[54:45] and the word is that seed that the sewer
[54:50] went forth to sow
[54:52] and the life that's in there is the life
[54:56] of christ
[54:58] see
[54:59] in the word personally and it
[55:03] vindicates
[55:04] itself something that you cannot do
[55:09] but he will do that in you
[55:12] because you can't ah do that but he will
[55:15] vindicate himself in you praise god that
[55:19] he may receive all the glory
[55:22] and no man can glory in his presence
[55:26] oh lord i work hard for you lord i
[55:29] sacrifice lord i pray so many hours oh
[55:33] lord i studied their night and i read
[55:35] all the books i listened to all the day
[55:38] that's wonderful and good but he wants
[55:40] to make it clear that he would share his
[55:44] glory with nobody he wants all the glory
[55:47] and all the praise and he is the one
[55:50] that's doing all of it and we are just
[55:52] yolk fellows that are cooperating with
[55:55] him obediently as we walk win the word
[55:59] of god hallelujah amen
[56:03] who praise god
[56:05] you see he is proving himself
[56:09] that it is not you
[56:13] that is doing that in there this is
[56:16] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[56:18] praise the lord he is speaking here
[56:20] hallelujah and you can't do it yourself
[56:24] see but it's him he repeats again
[56:28] because you and him have become one
[56:32] can you say amen
[56:35] amen
[56:37] you and him have become one you're in
[56:39] agreement
[56:41] you are in oneness
[56:43] you are an invisible union
[56:46] you're united
[56:47] you're married to jesus christ
[56:50] you're married to the word of the living
[56:52] god hallelujah oh praise god i want you
[56:56] to understand friends listen it's not
[56:59] him
[57:00] but
[57:02] you and him have become one
[57:06] that makes you a loved slave
[57:09] some of you didn't know it but you're a
[57:10] love slave
[57:12] is that right
[57:14] because you you can't get away from the
[57:16] word amen
[57:17] why
[57:18] it's not because the pastor is keeping
[57:21] you
[57:22] it's just like parents they send a turn
[57:24] to school
[57:25] but you can't watch over them 24 7.
[57:29] so you put them in the hands of a higher
[57:31] power
[57:32] who who doesn't sleep
[57:34] and he sees all and he knows all and he
[57:37] he can protect all his all in all his
[57:40] everything
[57:42] and that's where our fate rests in the
[57:44] being like that the mighty god you have
[57:47] a lasting father the prince of peace
[57:50] hallelujah jesus christ amen lord of god
[57:54] you become a love slave to him
[57:59] him
[58:00] the word
[58:02] to become a bride
[58:04] hallelujah praise god
[58:07] and what is the word
[58:09] the word is life
[58:11] not natural life the word is spiritual
[58:13] life
[58:14] hallelujah that no matter if this
[58:16] outside man dies the the germ that he
[58:19] puts in there
[58:21] continues to live forever it can never
[58:24] pass away it can never die or anything
[58:27] like that but satan wants to tell a lie
[58:29] to the world by the outside man dying
[58:32] that's the end of him and he tried to
[58:34] tell that lie with jesus that's the end
[58:36] of him it wasn't the end of him because
[58:39] it what was in him the father that
[58:42] dwelleth in him did the works and now
[58:45] the gene that lives in you manifests
[58:48] itself and does the work that he that
[58:50] liveth and believe it on me though he
[58:53] were naturally dead yet shall he live
[58:56] praise god because the holy spirit of
[58:59] the living god working moving takes that
[59:02] gene and uses it for his glory and for
[59:05] his honor amen praise god amen
[59:09] hallelujah so we understand you always
[59:12] had eternal life how many knows that
[59:15] amen
[59:17] go back to brother branham's fundamental
[59:19] teaching
[59:21] the words the bible's fundamental
[59:23] teaching
[59:25] eternity eternal means without the
[59:28] beginning and without an end
[59:32] that alone tells you you cannot
[59:36] now
[59:37] receive eternal life
[59:39] to begin on a certain day a certain
[59:41] month a certain year
[59:43] you had to be in the original mind and
[59:46] plan and planting of the great sower of
[59:50] seeds upon the earth you have to be
[59:52] already there before you can be here
[59:56] amen you have to be there before you can
[59:58] be here we can twist that backwards and
[1:00:01] go back to my old message on where were
[1:00:03] you when the morning stars sang together
[1:00:06] for joy and show that you're fighting
[1:00:08] god's word down here just like you
[1:00:11] fought against michael uh are up there
[1:00:14] you're doing the same thing down here
[1:00:16] you're resisting you're fighting the
[1:00:18] word you're doubting the word you're
[1:00:20] coming against the lord in the same way
[1:00:23] praise god hallelujah amen somebody says
[1:00:26] oh you know if i was in the days of
[1:00:28] jesus i would have never pierced him in
[1:00:30] the side i would have recognized no you
[1:00:33] know you reject the word of god it's
[1:00:36] just as much as we in the west in jesus
[1:00:39] say we are joking him
[1:00:44] piercing
[1:00:46] pierce him in his side but you do that
[1:00:48] by your doubts you do it by your fears
[1:00:51] you do it by your rejection of his
[1:00:53] people because now it's not god the word
[1:00:56] only being understood but god
[1:01:00] god misunderstood in his word his living
[1:01:04] word his people his children today
[1:01:07] he's being misunderstood because their
[1:01:10] actions are so
[1:01:11] uh out of the system their actions is
[1:01:14] out of the
[1:01:16] church system their actions are not in
[1:01:19] sync with the religious systems even in
[1:01:22] this message it's not in shape they're
[1:01:24] in sync with the word
[1:01:27] they're in sync with his life
[1:01:29] they're moved by his life by his spirit
[1:01:32] praise god you're not moved by brother
[1:01:34] so brother so you're not even moved by
[1:01:36] me you're hearing me but if i only say
[1:01:40] something that's not there god will show
[1:01:42] it to you and that's why we we're
[1:01:44] talking to eagles
[1:01:47] hallelujah
[1:01:49] we're not talking to chicken hawks or
[1:01:51] talking to
[1:01:53] all kind of what you call those little
[1:01:55] canaries
[1:01:56] when a great eagle
[1:01:58] or a young eagle can fly up and soar in
[1:02:02] the heavenlies of the word of god
[1:02:04] hallelujah what what you're going to do
[1:02:07] with a canary you can't even rise as
[1:02:08] high as the treetop much less
[1:02:11] what you're going to tell them amen or
[1:02:14] back to the word of god
[1:02:16] back to the holy spirit
[1:02:18] oh praise god forevermore glory to god
[1:02:22] amen hallelujah so
[1:02:25] uh uh let me make some statements here
[1:02:29] that uh if you listen close i want you
[1:02:31] to understand you're really
[1:02:34] never
[1:02:36] was saved anywhere down here on the
[1:02:38] earth
[1:02:39] the land was already slain before the
[1:02:41] foundation of the world
[1:02:43] you are now manifesting that salvation
[1:02:47] you're letting the rest of the world
[1:02:49] know what happened up there
[1:02:52] by
[1:02:53] doing what you're doing down here in
[1:02:55] other words jesus had to come back and
[1:02:57] go to the cross the lamb was already
[1:03:00] slain
[1:03:01] before the foundation
[1:03:03] but human being senses can't pick them
[1:03:06] up they don't know nothing about that so
[1:03:08] he has to come on the earth and
[1:03:10] dramatize what he already done
[1:03:13] and what i'm telling you is that we are
[1:03:17] here
[1:03:18] living out and manifesting what we
[1:03:21] already done you were always saved
[1:03:24] you were safe way back there right down
[1:03:27] right now
[1:03:28] right down to the present time praise
[1:03:30] god
[1:03:31] hallelujah amen
[1:03:34] can god lose anything
[1:03:37] so then how were you lost
[1:03:41] you see what i'm
[1:03:42] saying that word when it's used and when
[1:03:46] it's used even in the bible it's for the
[1:03:49] people to understand but for you
[1:03:51] yourself you know that god can't lose
[1:03:55] anything
[1:03:56] you can't lose anything so he really
[1:03:59] didn't lose you
[1:04:01] amen but in the eyes of man how he's
[1:04:04] going to express that to them without
[1:04:06] telling him all his secrets before the
[1:04:08] time yeah he can't do that so he said oh
[1:04:11] they're lost i i gotta i gotta bring
[1:04:14] them back i've got to save them yeah you
[1:04:17] see because they but they were already
[1:04:20] saved but god has expressed it that way
[1:04:22] can't let nothing out before this time
[1:04:25] i'm telling you now we're telling you
[1:04:26] now but this couldn't be said before
[1:04:29] because the devil is always there
[1:04:31] listening looking to copy and corrupt
[1:04:34] and uh undermine the kingdom of god saw
[1:04:37] the secrets of the princes of this world
[1:04:40] knew the things of god that would not
[1:04:42] crucify the lord of glory
[1:04:45] amen they fulfilled their part in the
[1:04:47] whole drama
[1:04:49] and didn't even know they were
[1:04:50] fulfilling their
[1:04:52] part as far as that goes amen praise god
[1:04:56] hallelujah i'm glad about that praise
[1:04:59] god aren't you happy about that
[1:05:02] [Music]
[1:05:03] god
[1:05:04] was really
[1:05:06] redeeming a part
[1:05:09] of himself
[1:05:11] out of the pawn shop the devil's spawn
[1:05:14] shop
[1:05:15] the devil
[1:05:16] only had temporary use of you
[1:05:20] until god
[1:05:22] was the came back through jesus christ
[1:05:26] to bring the
[1:05:27] ticket
[1:05:28] the tag
[1:05:30] the token
[1:05:32] and take you out
[1:05:34] of the pawn shop praise the lord and i'm
[1:05:37] glad
[1:05:38] that that tells me that god so loved me
[1:05:42] that that a portion of himself could
[1:05:44] never be left in the devil's spawn shop
[1:05:48] and he made a way to bring me out bring
[1:05:51] you out praise the lord god hallelujah
[1:05:54] and not only i'm finding out and i'm
[1:05:57] understanding now not only um
[1:06:01] did i always have eternal life
[1:06:05] let me say it because it might sound
[1:06:07] radical but listen
[1:06:09] but you are eternal life
[1:06:12] because you are a part of that original
[1:06:15] life i don't mean you are all of it but
[1:06:17] you're a portion of it
[1:06:20] and so you
[1:06:21] are a living part of eternal life
[1:06:25] living on the earth in other words
[1:06:27] eternity already broke into time
[1:06:30] in you and it's walking on the earth now
[1:06:33] they talk about aliens and they're
[1:06:35] looking for all kinds of paul already
[1:06:37] tell us you see you are aliens and
[1:06:39] strangers
[1:06:41] from the coming from god's commonwealth
[1:06:43] of grace and they don't even know that
[1:06:45] we are already here praise god because
[1:06:48] we are walking around with human bodies
[1:06:50] just like everybody else so we just
[1:06:52] human bodies but paul said we're really
[1:06:54] not from here
[1:06:55] we didn't even come from here
[1:06:57] when this is all over we going back to
[1:06:59] where we come from and then we're going
[1:07:01] to be known as we are alone we will be
[1:07:04] recognized of who we really are by the
[1:07:07] grace of almighty god
[1:07:09] hallelujah
[1:07:11] amen praise god hallelujah
[1:07:15] it's his presence
[1:07:18] in the individual
[1:07:20] with personal
[1:07:22] vindication of himself
[1:07:26] expressing himself
[1:07:29] through them the living word
[1:07:32] that's promise
[1:07:34] for the day
[1:07:36] whatever
[1:07:37] promise was for this age that's what
[1:07:39] he's going to manifest through you
[1:07:42] restored
[1:07:44] the word restored a vindication
[1:07:47] of the great revelation of god
[1:07:50] look
[1:07:51] he will look
[1:07:53] only in an individual
[1:07:56] never in a group
[1:07:59] an individual
[1:08:01] not in a group
[1:08:03] his
[1:08:04] identification is with an individual

[1:08:19] love in this room all of you have the
[1:08:21] stature of the perfect man i can't say
[1:08:24] that you individually must receive that
[1:08:28] revelation from god
[1:08:30] now in the church age book at remember
[1:08:32] page where brother branham said
[1:08:35] the importance of revelation
[1:08:39] to the true believer you cannot over
[1:08:42] emphasize
[1:08:44] the importance of revelation to the true
[1:08:47] believer amen praise god but
[1:08:51] i would just like to put this word which
[1:08:53] he has already here
[1:08:55] the which
[1:08:56] the importance
[1:08:58] of individual revelation
[1:09:02] not only to recognize the great
[1:09:04] revelation came forth by the seven seals
[1:09:08] amen but for you to have individual
[1:09:12] revelation on that
[1:09:14] because that is what he was saying that
[1:09:17] upon this rock i'll build my church
[1:09:20] and the gates of hell will not prevail
[1:09:23] against it
[1:09:24] amen praise god he wasn't talking to the
[1:09:27] group he said thou art peter and upon
[1:09:31] this rock what rock the rock of
[1:09:34] revelation amen individual
[1:09:37] revelation is of supreme
[1:09:40] importance praise god hallelujah praise
[1:09:43] god and we don't so our struggles are
[1:09:46] over right
[1:09:48] because everything is based on him and
[1:09:51] he has already overcome and i thank god
[1:09:55] for this great overcomer in my life
[1:10:00] uh christ is a mystery of god revealed
[1:10:05] all hell
[1:10:07] is against this teaching
[1:10:12] everybody's talking about revelation
[1:10:13] revelation any group you go to
[1:10:16] even message group you know the national
[1:10:18] group they're talking about revelation
[1:10:19] revelation revelation
[1:10:21] revelation most of the time they mean to
[1:10:24] have a better intellectual understanding
[1:10:27] of what you're hearing
[1:10:29] not that something one day you've been
[1:10:32] listening for a long time but one day
[1:10:34] something strikes your heart
[1:10:38] and a light
[1:10:39] bursts within you
[1:10:42] a bulb goes on
[1:10:45] amen and you recognize who you are
[1:10:48] by the grace of god
[1:10:51] hallelujah
[1:10:52] i want you to know that my brother
[1:10:54] sister all hell
[1:10:57] is against this teaching
[1:10:59] what teaching
[1:11:01] the teaching
[1:11:03] of people becoming aware not the church
[1:11:06] telling you they have a revelation
[1:11:09] and for you to be saved you believe the
[1:11:11] church
[1:11:13] you believe the group
[1:11:14] and then you get saved but you are saved
[1:11:18] or come to the knowledge that you are
[1:11:20] saved
[1:11:21] by your
[1:11:23] individual revelation of who you are
[1:11:27] and what god has done for you amen
[1:11:30] through the ages glory to god hallelujah
[1:11:33] all hills against this teaching grace
[1:11:37] god what teaching praise the lord that
[1:11:40] what teaching the teaching of god's word
[1:11:43] because you catch the revelation it
[1:11:45] brings you from way up in glory right
[1:11:49] back into glory and i'll tell you about
[1:11:52] lucifer
[1:11:53] and how he
[1:11:55] was in heaven
[1:11:56] and how he started a war in heaven how
[1:11:59] he start rumors and gossips and heaven
[1:12:01] lies in heaven how he started all these
[1:12:04] things and how he was kicked out
[1:12:07] the lucifer was kicked out
[1:12:10] and now he's come down here to do the
[1:12:12] same thing
[1:12:14] raise up
[1:12:18] a counterfeit church
[1:12:20] that's anointed by fallen angels
[1:12:25] to
[1:12:26] come amongst the people
[1:12:28] and to spread
[1:12:30] rumors of false doctrines
[1:12:33] blacken the name
[1:12:35] of jesus christ of the world
[1:12:38] to confuse the issue
[1:12:40] and to subvert the kingdom
[1:12:42] of the living god hallelujah and so that
[1:12:47] false church that he has
[1:12:49] there are things that are right in this
[1:12:51] bible they don't want you to know
[1:12:55] they don't want you to know that god is
[1:12:58] really one god
[1:13:01] and that all they were teaching all
[1:13:03] these years about blessed trinity and
[1:13:05] holy trinity is absolutely false and not
[1:13:09] found in the bible
[1:13:12] it's not found in the bible you'll never
[1:13:14] find paul or any of those apostles
[1:13:16] praying in that way or saying anything
[1:13:19] like that they will use terms like
[1:13:21] father son and holy ghost but jesus
[1:13:23] mentioned clearly to them who was the
[1:13:25] person that is the father the son and
[1:13:28] the holy ghost amen so
[1:13:31] that's the devil doesn't want you to
[1:13:33] know that there's one god because that
[1:13:35] brings your eyes start to focus now the
[1:13:37] baby's eyes start focusing
[1:13:40] it's not scattered vision now the vision
[1:13:42] is coming just by recognizing you begin
[1:13:45] right there one god
[1:13:48] and that's the teaching that the devil
[1:13:50] doesn't want the people outside to know
[1:13:53] let's not take it for granted how simple
[1:13:56] that sounds to you
[1:13:57] but that's earth chattering to people on
[1:13:59] the outside
[1:14:01] hallelujah that there is only one god
[1:14:04] and take it further his name is jesus
[1:14:06] christ
[1:14:07] [Music]
[1:14:08] i said his name is jesus christ
[1:14:11] and there is only one god hallelujah
[1:14:15] they don't even want you to know
[1:14:17] that jesus christ is that god that was
[1:14:21] in the old testament and is right now
[1:14:23] here with us the same yesterday today
[1:14:26] and forever
[1:14:28] they don't really want the people to
[1:14:30] know what rarely happened in the garden
[1:14:33] they'll tell them lies upon lies upon
[1:14:35] lies once it was an apple then it was a
[1:14:38] pair then it was something else then
[1:14:41] this it was this it was that none of
[1:14:43] them will come and tell the people the
[1:14:45] truth
[1:14:47] amen it was sexual sin in the garden
[1:14:51] and twins came forth from it
[1:14:54] cain and abel and the world got
[1:14:57] populated that way and spiritually the
[1:15:00] world already is populated that way
[1:15:03] praise god they don't want you to know
[1:15:05] that
[1:15:06] they make it sound like it's so of color
[1:15:08] so we can't preach that we can't say
[1:15:10] nothing about that we have to lead that
[1:15:12] we can expose to you what really eve did
[1:15:16] in the bible oh no they will tell you
[1:15:19] that that's what one of the things they
[1:15:22] don't really want you to know
[1:15:24] they don't want you to really know the
[1:15:27] trail of the serpent
[1:15:29] all his whole history from heaven right
[1:15:32] down in the garden right down to this
[1:15:35] hour and how he's going to end up in the
[1:15:38] bits of hell amen and the lack of fire
[1:15:43] the mystery of inequity they don't want
[1:15:46] you to know about that they don't want
[1:15:48] you to know the mystery of god through
[1:15:52] the ages when i say the mystery of god
[1:15:54] the mysteries that were in the word they
[1:15:57] don't want you to know that the bible as
[1:15:59] it is you can read it all right but it's
[1:16:02] a book that is filled with mystery and
[1:16:04] unless god interprets his own word to
[1:16:07] you you don't know what you have you
[1:16:09] just got it in your hand but you don't
[1:16:11] know what to really have until god
[1:16:14] begins to interpret his own word to your
[1:16:16] heart and to your life
[1:16:18] [Music]
[1:16:19] they don't want you to know
[1:16:22] the unveiling of god
[1:16:24] was done in our generation
[1:16:27] by a 20th century prophet
[1:16:30] a modern-day prophet not a must not
[1:16:32] ezekiel not isaiah
[1:16:35] the devil always wants you to look back
[1:16:37] on which is okay we go back to all those
[1:16:39] prophets but god sent us a present-day
[1:16:42] prophet
[1:16:43] 20th century prophet
[1:16:46] william marian branham
[1:16:48] praise god hallelujah oh my and he
[1:16:51] didn't come here to bring some new
[1:16:53] gospel or add to the word all he came
[1:16:57] was to magnify the word that's already
[1:17:00] here
[1:17:01] jesus said i didn't come to get rid of
[1:17:03] the word or to exchange i come to
[1:17:05] fulfill and the word there in the greek
[1:17:07] is magnify in other words i want to see
[1:17:10] it clear i want it to become so big that
[1:17:13] you can't miss it that you're going to
[1:17:14] see it that's what the prophet came is
[1:17:17] to make the word of god clear known to
[1:17:21] us praise the name the lord hallelujah
[1:17:23] but not only is the prophet was used to
[1:17:26] unveil god the word but now what is
[1:17:29] taking place is the unveiling of the
[1:17:32] bride
[1:17:34] for she she the bride before the coming
[1:17:38] to her bridegroom she always had to wear
[1:17:42] a veil so she was hid amidst all the
[1:17:46] rest of the people hid amongst humans
[1:17:48] him amongst the people but thank god god
[1:17:52] is now taking the veil off of the bride
[1:17:56] for them to recognize what he has done
[1:17:58] what he is doing in this day and in this
[1:18:01] hour don't tell me i shouldn't be
[1:18:03] excited oh brother simon calm down you
[1:18:06] shouldn't get so excited i'm excited
[1:18:08] because this is the hour this is the day
[1:18:11] this is the time when god is taking his
[1:18:14] people out of here
[1:18:16] oh his beloved bride his elected few
[1:18:20] his speckled bird
[1:18:22] praise god you know that in the in a lot
[1:18:25] of the uh weddings in the east the the
[1:18:27] young man can't see the bride he's not
[1:18:30] allowed to really see her he sees her
[1:18:33] form and that sort of thing but her face
[1:18:36] you don't know her face until he begins
[1:18:39] to lift the veil
[1:18:41] then when he lifts the veil you see her
[1:18:43] face clearly oh praise god and i'm glad
[1:18:46] he's lifting the face lifting the veil
[1:18:49] off of the bride to recognize that the
[1:18:53] is right amongst you right now she is
[1:18:56] just human like you amen but the word is
[1:18:59] what makes a difference
[1:19:02] amen the word makes the difference
[1:19:05] praise god hallelujah and now we thank
[1:19:09] god they won't want you to know this
[1:19:11] they want you to know that you got to
[1:19:14] have all kinds of
[1:19:16] priesthoods and this and that they don't
[1:19:19] want to recognize that the leadership
[1:19:21] has now changed the pillar of fire
[1:19:24] it's changed to joshua
[1:19:27] joshua is the one that's leading at this
[1:19:29] time
[1:19:30] the holy spirit is the one that's
[1:19:33] leaning at this time but they don't want
[1:19:35] you to believe that because uh how how
[1:19:39] you're going to move like that you got
[1:19:41] to have certain codes of conduct you got
[1:19:44] to have certain fundamentals laid out
[1:19:47] clearly that you are to act by but
[1:19:50] that's exactly what they did
[1:19:52] they give the people a primer
[1:19:55] on how to be a christian
[1:19:58] and they are to take those rules and
[1:20:00] live by those rules
[1:20:02] but god put the
[1:20:04] his law within our hearts
[1:20:07] so my friends it's the holy spirit
[1:20:09] leading i'm just watching myself there
[1:20:11] before i don't want to go off on this or
[1:20:14] that but stay right in the center there
[1:20:16] that praise god forevermore that we are
[1:20:20] led by the holy spirit and we are led by
[1:20:22] joshua the holy spirit amen
[1:20:25] praise god amen there it was that once
[1:20:29] it was
[1:20:30] moses obeying the pillar of fire
[1:20:34] leading them through the wilderness but
[1:20:36] when the children came through the
[1:20:38] wilderness
[1:20:39] moses had to die on as you know and his
[1:20:44] body was carried away and what happened
[1:20:48] joshua took them across the river
[1:20:52] hallelujah
[1:20:53] praise god i'm not pillar of fire
[1:20:56] later on was seen by joshua as the
[1:20:59] captain of the lord's hosts
[1:21:02] amen praise god we're right in that
[1:21:06] phase right now where the purifier
[1:21:09] working amongst the people of god unseen
[1:21:12] but recognized by the true believer
[1:21:15] hallelujah praise god forevermore oh
[1:21:19] praise god amen
[1:21:21] wow where are we at praise god when they
[1:21:25] don't want you to know that true what
[1:21:28] baptism is not father son and holy ghost
[1:21:32] but true water baptism is in the name of
[1:21:35] jesus christ
[1:21:37] for that is the name of the person who
[1:21:40] is father who is the son who is the holy
[1:21:43] ghost and that's the name in which we
[1:21:46] are to be baptized and of course they
[1:21:49] don't want you to know that a baptismal
[1:21:52] holy spirit is not speaking in towns you
[1:21:56] see how coming now that you can
[1:21:58] understand and see the word of god see
[1:22:00] how cunning the devil is one little
[1:22:02] twist here
[1:22:03] and he changed the thing
[1:22:06] on the book of acts
[1:22:08] that it's really a revelation they
[1:22:10] received that got them excited
[1:22:13] and that caused them to speak in towns
[1:22:15] but he take the emphasis off the
[1:22:18] revelation and put it on the tongue
[1:22:20] speaking
[1:22:21] down here speaking in tongues is the
[1:22:24] evidence of the holy ghost no and then
[1:22:26] devils start to creep in
[1:22:28] amen and then devils start speaking in
[1:22:31] tongues too do you know devils speak in
[1:22:33] tongues
[1:22:34] do you know they speak in tongues better
[1:22:36] than some of the people that claim they
[1:22:37] speak in towns
[1:22:39] they got them up in toronto there and
[1:22:41] some of them fall on the ground they're
[1:22:43] quacking like ducks they're
[1:22:45] bringing like jackasses they're barking
[1:22:47] like dogs and everything this is not a
[1:22:50] joke i'm seriously because i personally
[1:22:53] hear it in my own little life of casting
[1:22:56] out devils
[1:22:58] and seeing them moving on the ground
[1:23:00] like serpents and everything else and
[1:23:02] speaking in tongues and
[1:23:04] claiming that that's the holy ghost amen
[1:23:07] god already showed me since i'm a
[1:23:09] teenager that was not the holy ghost
[1:23:12] uh that that is all mixed in there you
[1:23:14] can't differentiate it the only thing
[1:23:17] that can discern the spirits is the word
[1:23:19] of god hallelujah and the word of god
[1:23:22] descends the spirits amen you recognize
[1:23:26] what those spirits are doing amen all
[1:23:29] hell
[1:23:30] is against this teaching
[1:23:33] all hell he repeats is against this
[1:23:36] truth
[1:23:38] so this teaching is the truth
[1:23:41] it's the word of god hallelujah because
[1:23:44] he repeats because it is the truth
[1:23:48] praise the lord glory to god but you see
[1:23:52] his mystery
[1:23:53] is only
[1:23:55] revealed to his beloved bride and she's
[1:24:00] the only one that can see it
[1:24:04] amen it's the truth but they're not
[1:24:05] going to be able to recognize and see
[1:24:07] that it's the truth but this beloved
[1:24:09] bride she will recognize and she will be
[1:24:13] able to see that is the truth of the
[1:24:15] word of god hallelujah now you say well
[1:24:19] well brother branham how do you know
[1:24:21] that's right
[1:24:24] you say something and a lot of believers
[1:24:26] would even say that to you how you know
[1:24:28] that's right he said how do you know
[1:24:31] that's right well you see
[1:24:33] he the word
[1:24:35] is vindicated
[1:24:38] praise god he stopped right there but
[1:24:40] let me take it and so he didn't want to
[1:24:43] expand because he would have to talk
[1:24:44] about himself he's trying to tell them
[1:24:47] the word has already been vindicated
[1:24:50] why because he the word vindicated
[1:24:54] himself through the ministry of brother
[1:24:56] william marion branham amen
[1:25:00] when jesus came let me let me go
[1:25:02] backwards when jesus came on the earth
[1:25:05] and he said the father that dwelleth in
[1:25:07] me
[1:25:08] my father and i said what father what
[1:25:10] are you talking about amen like that and
[1:25:13] he said well the father dwelleth in me
[1:25:14] he do at the works it's not me doing
[1:25:16] these signs wonders miracles and all
[1:25:19] these things it's not me that's the
[1:25:20] father
[1:25:21] manifesting himself proving that he is
[1:25:23] in me and that he's there working in me
[1:25:25] amen he all he wants to do is to make
[1:25:28] you conscious of his presence here is
[1:25:30] that right but they couldn't see it they
[1:25:32] were blind they couldn't recognize that
[1:25:35] it was god and christ but brother
[1:25:38] branham said the time will come when
[1:25:40] christ is in the church
[1:25:42] then he says the kingdom is coming back
[1:25:44] amen wow into oneness glory to god amen
[1:25:48] that's what i'm talking about now
[1:25:50] hallelujah about the word being
[1:25:53] vindicated
[1:25:55] it vindicated itself
[1:25:58] through the ministry of william marion
[1:26:01] branham
[1:26:02] when jesus was here they said no man can
[1:26:05] do these miracles except god be with him
[1:26:10] if they had a revelation they would have
[1:26:11] said in him
[1:26:14] oh my and now in our day god sent a
[1:26:18] genuine prophet that none of them can't
[1:26:22] denounce they can't they can't find a
[1:26:25] fault there's a lamb without splat but a
[1:26:27] wrinkle
[1:26:28] amen they can't he says you find one
[1:26:32] thing wrong and i'll put a sign on my
[1:26:34] back and you call me a false prophet and
[1:26:37] lead me through the streets
[1:26:39] they can't do it not through his whole
[1:26:41] lifetime
[1:26:44] amen
[1:26:45] and no man could do all those miracles
[1:26:48] except god be with him
[1:26:50] and in him
[1:26:52] and what was that was that william
[1:26:54] branham that's why he kept trying to
[1:26:56] tell of you it's not me
[1:26:57] it is this is not about me if i can only
[1:27:00] get myself out of the way so that
[1:27:02] william branham is not even sought of
[1:27:05] and you can recognize who is doing these
[1:27:07] things
[1:27:08] who is bringing the word who is
[1:27:10] interpreting the word to you it's not
[1:27:12] william branham the god is an
[1:27:14] interpreter of his own word
[1:27:16] there is a man here that can turn on the
[1:27:19] light
[1:27:20] and they're always keep thinking he's
[1:27:21] talking about william branham they don't
[1:27:23] understand he was talking of jesus
[1:27:25] christ who was there revealing himself
[1:27:28] through that that that that prophet's
[1:27:31] body amen that veil that he was using
[1:27:34] there for the glory of god hallelujah so
[1:27:39] we can see clearly by the man's life
[1:27:43] by his acts
[1:27:44] by the signs and wonders that god used
[1:27:48] him hallelujah and most of all the
[1:27:51] restoration of the full word hallelujah
[1:27:56] and god is proven his own word he is
[1:28:00] proving that is his word
[1:28:02] that came through that man he is dead
[1:28:04] and gone but this will never die this
[1:28:07] message won't end until we are taken out
[1:28:10] of here in a rapture hallelujah
[1:28:13] and even when we are gone this message
[1:28:15] will still be fulfilled because he
[1:28:17] already talked about the coming of the
[1:28:19] two witnesses he talked about uh you
[1:28:21] know jesus coming putting his foot on
[1:28:23] mount zion he talked about russia and
[1:28:26] china attacking israel for their oil we
[1:28:29] talk about all these things hallelujah
[1:28:31] so long after we're gone we're gonna see
[1:28:34] the lord will continue to fulfill itself
[1:28:36] hallelujah because god takes the man
[1:28:39] amen oh my but he don't take the spirit
[1:28:43] and the word will continue to fulfill
[1:28:45] itself amen
[1:28:47] because it's not a man's word it just
[1:28:49] came through a man but it was not a
[1:28:51] man's word it's god's word speaking for
[1:28:54] the spirit speaks through the prophet
[1:28:57] glory to god hallelujah amen so
[1:29:01] she only his beloved bride see it's
[1:29:05] revealed to her and she's the only one
[1:29:08] that can see it amen hallelujah oh what
[1:29:13] is the son of man being revealed
[1:29:16] hallelujah revealing himself through a
[1:29:20] son of man
[1:29:21] the son of man revealing himself through
[1:29:24] a son of man that we might know
[1:29:27] that he is here
[1:29:30] a greater than solomon is here
[1:29:33] the herald already announced the
[1:29:37] presence of the king
[1:29:39] and telling us he is here but it's not a
[1:29:42] king that you can see with your eyes but
[1:29:45] he's letting you know if you're a
[1:29:46] believer and your heart lets you know
[1:29:48] that the king word the king of peace the
[1:29:52] king of righteousness is here by the
[1:29:55] opening of the word of god hallelujah
[1:29:58] thanks be to god glory to his wonderful
[1:30:01] name oh my thank god i recognize that
[1:30:05] you know the first time i read one of
[1:30:09] brother branham sermons after two books
[1:30:11] were placed in my hands while i was
[1:30:14] still in the assemblies of god
[1:30:16] denomination in their bible
[1:30:19] college there and in the third year and
[1:30:23] then these two books came into my hand
[1:30:25] when i read them
[1:30:27] i don't know because
[1:30:30] right away
[1:30:31] i can tell
[1:30:32] what this man is saying
[1:30:35] that is
[1:30:36] the voice of god speaking
[1:30:40] and i'm i'm believing it though i don't
[1:30:42] know at the time i didn't understand it
[1:30:44] but something in here bore witness that
[1:30:47] that's right
[1:30:48] hallelujah i have held to it to this day
[1:30:51] to this hour i'm holding to the lord and
[1:30:54] the word is holding to me amen
[1:30:56] because it's the truth
[1:30:58] no matter how foolish i might have seen
[1:31:01] through the years no matter how foolish
[1:31:04] or apparent to some people like a dummy
[1:31:07] you could have made a whole lot of money
[1:31:10] going this way you could have had fame
[1:31:12] if you'd done this you could that you
[1:31:14] could have been a big person if you
[1:31:16] don't this you don't and then what is
[1:31:20] naturally the devil want to tell you
[1:31:21] you're foolish you're stupid because
[1:31:23] no
[1:31:24] no you just walk away you walk away from
[1:31:26] this you walk away from that you walk
[1:31:28] away from everything else and separate
[1:31:30] yourself to the word of the living god
[1:31:32] hallelujah amen oh my you didn't have
[1:31:36] listen to like i said in the early days
[1:31:39] when the message started there wasn't
[1:31:41] even one
[1:31:43] thought
[1:31:45] or even an inclination in the message
[1:31:47] that you can get in the message to
[1:31:49] become a pastor
[1:31:51] and you can maybe get some tithings
[1:31:54] there wasn't
[1:31:56] anybody the people that were coming in
[1:32:00] there was no tithing
[1:32:03] most of the time they were needy so you
[1:32:05] took care of them
[1:32:07] so
[1:32:08] uh
[1:32:09] a real men of god
[1:32:11] they come and they take the word not
[1:32:13] because they see something that they can
[1:32:16] get but they see what the word is saying
[1:32:20] to them out of that word and they get up
[1:32:23] and they follow it like abraham did
[1:32:27] amen they follow it praise the name of
[1:32:30] the lord hallelujah praise god are you
[1:32:32] with me
[1:32:34] amen glory to god hallelujah oh my
[1:32:39] see
[1:32:40] how do you know
[1:32:42] it is right
[1:32:43] how do you know
[1:32:44] because he the word is vindicated
[1:32:49] because and he repeats he the word
[1:32:52] properly vindicated
[1:32:54] showing himself to be the head ship of
[1:32:57] the church
[1:32:59] that he is the leader
[1:33:02] he is the one in other words he is the
[1:33:04] husband
[1:33:05] of the church he is the real leadership
[1:33:09] of the church amen praise god just just
[1:33:12] let your mind run through all those
[1:33:13] messages leadership this respects that
[1:33:16] that that he was already signaling
[1:33:19] without coming right out and telling us
[1:33:21] he is here now and you he's taking the
[1:33:25] leadership away from me and i got to
[1:33:27] decree so he might increase amen
[1:33:30] praise god glory to god amen yes sir so
[1:33:37] now
[1:33:38] you see
[1:33:39] praise god
[1:33:42] it will now be the headship itself
[1:33:46] listen close
[1:33:47] being recognized
[1:33:50] by personal identification
[1:33:54] that it's in the body
[1:33:57] amen
[1:33:58] personal identification be headship
[1:34:00] itself recognizing the body by personal
[1:34:02] identifications identifying himself
[1:34:06] proves the headship to the body amen the
[1:34:10] headship to the body so praise god that
[1:34:13] he has come in and by the life that is
[1:34:16] being lived by the word in you by the
[1:34:19] supernatural identification what i'm
[1:34:22] talking about let me slow down here
[1:34:25] is
[1:34:26] no more
[1:34:27] do you have to think like the
[1:34:29] denominations believe uh
[1:34:32] signs and wonders will follow them that
[1:34:34] believe
[1:34:36] but they are going out thinking that
[1:34:38] they have to go out and do all kinds of
[1:34:40] signs and wonders
[1:34:42] to prove that they believe
[1:34:44] but it didn't say that it says signs and
[1:34:46] oneness will follow
[1:34:49] if you believe
[1:34:51] it's something that will follow
[1:34:54] in other words you won't have to go
[1:34:56] thinking you're a miracle man or a
[1:34:57] miracle woman but you pray amen by faith
[1:35:01] amen and you leave it alone amen
[1:35:05] is that right
[1:35:06] you can't tell anybody that that this is
[1:35:09] the way it's going to be that's unless
[1:35:10] god tells you you got to leave it alone
[1:35:13] amen is that right
[1:35:15] and signs and wonders will just follow
[1:35:17] you it must be so normal let's be so
[1:35:20] natural
[1:35:21] some people might think that
[1:35:23] oh um
[1:35:25] that just happened
[1:35:27] it just happened but the fact is that
[1:35:29] keeps happening over and over and over
[1:35:32] and over and over again
[1:35:35] and you still think that's just
[1:35:37] happening
[1:35:39] well that's up to you or whatever you
[1:35:43] think but that's not the way it is it's
[1:35:45] just god working that way behind the
[1:35:48] scenes because it's no more the time of
[1:35:50] pentecostals
[1:35:52] where
[1:35:53] he's gonna do miracles around a certain
[1:35:56] man or woman for people to start oh
[1:35:58] there's a miracle man there's a miracle
[1:36:00] woman oh that's a godly no he wants them
[1:36:03] to recognize him
[1:36:05] not you
[1:36:07] so you go about your business
[1:36:09] live your normal life
[1:36:11] just be ordinary yes
[1:36:13] didn't he say that in the sales he said
[1:36:15] just don't go up with your head stuck up
[1:36:17] in the air walking with a big bible
[1:36:20] to show that you're religious and all
[1:36:22] these things he says just be simple
[1:36:26] be humble
[1:36:28] be reverent
[1:36:30] and god will bless you
[1:36:33] that's what all god's asking for
[1:36:35] simplicity humility
[1:36:37] and your christianity is not an act
[1:36:39] anymore
[1:36:40] again another quote and you can find it
[1:36:43] many places he said it becomes automatic
[1:36:46] said the sheep doesn't the sheep don't
[1:36:49] have to do nothing all it's got to do is
[1:36:50] eat and the wool just comes out
[1:36:53] and all them virtues come out they don't
[1:36:55] have to do nothing
[1:36:56] it just keeps coming out
[1:36:58] they keep adding wool but not in the
[1:37:00] sense of how you think like they find a
[1:37:02] piece of wood and stick it on themselves
[1:37:04] or they add other feather to become an
[1:37:06] eagle no
[1:37:07] but because they're eating the food
[1:37:10] there's the feathers come out the wool
[1:37:11] comes out the oil comes out everything
[1:37:13] comes out and they're adding from inside
[1:37:16] out they're working out their salvation
[1:37:19] with fear and trembling they're trusting
[1:37:22] in the word of the living god
[1:37:24] hallelujah amen praise god hallelujah
[1:37:29] amen hallelujah i'm so glad that uh we
[1:37:33] are in that lifeline
[1:37:37] i'm glad we're in that line lifeline and
[1:37:40] when i'm talking about the lifeline here
[1:37:41] which i'll touch on it for just a little
[1:37:43] while the lifeline we used to sing the
[1:37:46] old hymns how many remember that old
[1:37:48] hymn throughout the life line across the
[1:37:51] dark wave there is a brother whom
[1:37:54] someone could save
[1:37:56] somebody's brother oh then well dare to
[1:38:01] out the lifeline
[1:38:03] his peril to share amen oh praise god
[1:38:08] well really
[1:38:10] throwing out the lifeline as we
[1:38:13] understand it now or should understand
[1:38:15] it
[1:38:16] is his life is the lifeline
[1:38:21] and living your life in line with his
[1:38:25] life
[1:38:27] amen
[1:38:29] backside and front sight lined up
[1:38:32] your life with his life all lined up
[1:38:35] that is really the lifeline to the
[1:38:38] people
[1:38:39] what saves or pulls the people out of
[1:38:42] their amnesia is when they see him in
[1:38:45] you
[1:38:47] that is the line
[1:38:49] that is
[1:38:50] the lifeline that they can grab onto and
[1:38:54] hold on to
[1:38:55] and be pulled into the kingdom of god
[1:38:58] hallelujah not just you going about
[1:39:00] saying i'm a christian
[1:39:02] like the young man that came to brother
[1:39:04] branham when he was sitting in his car
[1:39:05] and gave him a truck and
[1:39:08] do you know jesus and
[1:39:10] about going to heaven he's talking to
[1:39:12] the prophet of the age and he gave him
[1:39:14] on the track and when brethren turned to
[1:39:16] him so that's very nice young man that's
[1:39:18] wonderful that's fine but you know did
[1:39:20] god tell you to do this praise the lord
[1:39:23] the lord and this and then he began to
[1:39:25] talk to him but he was illustrating
[1:39:28] how that is just not like that those
[1:39:31] days and those ages for that have passed
[1:39:34] and you're trying to go back in the age
[1:39:37] when they were just printing books and
[1:39:39] printing getting the word of god out and
[1:39:41] doing those things that's the way they
[1:39:43] had to give the word out but now the
[1:39:45] word is going out as living epistles
[1:39:49] the word is going on as living words
[1:39:52] the word is going out as wonderful words
[1:39:55] of life
[1:39:57] hallelujah the word of god is expressing
[1:40:00] itself amen god expressed in his own
[1:40:03] people
[1:40:04] in his own word
[1:40:06] recognized by him and identified before
[1:40:10] the foundation of the world praise the
[1:40:12] name of the lord hallelujah amen praise
[1:40:16] god so the lifeline we have to trout is
[1:40:19] to show his life
[1:40:21] that is in us
[1:40:22] for the glory of god amen praise god and
[1:40:26] we know i i will just pass by some
[1:40:28] things there that another place he said
[1:40:31] the lifeline
[1:40:32] is really his bloodline
[1:40:36] is that right
[1:40:38] are you in his bloodline
[1:40:40] are you one of his generations
[1:40:43] are you showing to the world that you
[1:40:46] are in the bloodline of jesus christ
[1:40:49] amen and that his
[1:40:51] the life is in the blood
[1:40:54] amen and so on you can take that and
[1:40:56] run with it praise the name of the lord
[1:40:58] praise god so we find out here um
[1:41:03] that he spoke clearly um about uh
[1:41:07] joshua the scripture we read joshua too
[1:41:10] about uh rahab the harlot throwing the
[1:41:13] scarlet line outside of our house this
[1:41:16] is what the lifeline is is to show it
[1:41:18] outside your house
[1:41:20] it's for the people to see
[1:41:22] the the scarlet cord outside your house
[1:41:25] is for them to see
[1:41:27] his life expressing through you
[1:41:31] not in the bible only that's written but
[1:41:34] to be expressing itself as living word
[1:41:37] in and through you
[1:41:38] not by putting on a
[1:41:40] but being yourself
[1:41:42] just walking if the word starts to
[1:41:45] control you maybe it doesn't have full
[1:41:46] control over you and maybe now you're
[1:41:48] going to mistake you're going to say
[1:41:50] things you're going to act certain ways
[1:41:51] you're going to do this
[1:41:53] and people will see that and want to
[1:41:54] hide
[1:41:55] you know hang you high but the fact is
[1:41:58] you are pressing on the upward way and
[1:42:01] allowing god to have his way in your
[1:42:03] life you are allowing god's power to
[1:42:05] transform to change you glory to glory
[1:42:09] is changing us glory to glory is
[1:42:11] changing you
[1:42:13] changing means changing all of us by his
[1:42:15] grace amen praise god hallelujah oh
[1:42:20] praise god so that's it my brother
[1:42:23] sister is to make sure that we are part
[1:42:27] of his bloodline
[1:42:29] and you are part of his bloodline then
[1:42:32] you want to show that lifeline outside
[1:42:35] you want to throw the card out the
[1:42:37] window praise god hallelujah we'll talk
[1:42:40] about that another time but watch there
[1:42:42] clear carefully the scripture continues
[1:42:45] that i think in page 78 of christ is a
[1:42:48] mystery of god revealed nations are
[1:42:51] breaking
[1:42:53] israel's awakening
[1:42:56] the signs that the prophets foretold
[1:43:00] gentile disnumbered with horrors and
[1:43:04] cummer return or dispersed to your own
[1:43:09] for the day
[1:43:11] of redemption
[1:43:13] is near
[1:43:14] very near man's hearts
[1:43:18] are failing for fear
[1:43:21] oh be filled with god's spirit
[1:43:25] you're lamb streamed and clear
[1:43:29] look up
[1:43:30] your redemption
[1:43:33] is near
[1:43:35] he is saying here nations are breaking
[1:43:38] israel's awakening you see what i mean
[1:43:43] he has now begun
[1:43:46] to give life
[1:43:48] into his body
[1:43:51] praise god quickening power he has begun
[1:43:54] to give life
[1:43:56] into his body which is the bride so the
[1:43:59] bride now uh just before the rapture
[1:44:03] life starting to come to her life
[1:44:06] starting to come in this brain
[1:44:08] hallelujah i don't know about you but i
[1:44:10] am i've got it all over me praise god i
[1:44:13] got it inside me i got it outside me
[1:44:15] praise god and i trust that somehow the
[1:44:18] holy spirit will help me to transform
[1:44:20] some of what that is in me on me and
[1:44:23] opening up itself that you will catch
[1:44:26] that hole to god's unchanging hand that
[1:44:28] will press you right through amen
[1:44:32] amen oh praise god how do you express it
[1:44:35] other than how they always used to
[1:44:37] express it something has got a hold of
[1:44:39] me
[1:44:41] i don't know about you but i know
[1:44:43] something real got a whole of me
[1:44:45] and not only can i spiritually believe
[1:44:48] it
[1:44:48] but i am starting these days to feel it
[1:44:52] all over me i can't get away from it
[1:44:54] there's nothing i can do about it i just
[1:44:56] feel it all over me around me everywhere
[1:44:58] praise god hallelujah and i thank god
[1:45:01] for it amen oh bless his holy name
[1:45:05] he has begun to give life into his body
[1:45:08] hallelujah praise god amen is giving
[1:45:12] life to the whole bride wherever she is
[1:45:14] around the world whether she's in
[1:45:16] namibia south africa
[1:45:21] wherever she is life is going out
[1:45:24] it doesn't mean all the churches or
[1:45:27] because remember
[1:45:29] god doesn't deal with groups
[1:45:32] he deals with individuals
[1:45:35] just like when billy paul he asked him
[1:45:38] after he had preached
[1:45:40] thousands of people he says billy how
[1:45:42] many people do you think really
[1:45:44] understood what i said he said well oh
[1:45:48] praise god he said you know i i think
[1:45:50] they all understood that's why they were
[1:45:51] rejoicing and everything else he says
[1:45:54] billy
[1:45:56] how many do you really
[1:45:59] unders
[1:46:00] believe understood what i said he said
[1:46:03] well
[1:46:05] uh
[1:46:06] i i really don't know and then brother
[1:46:08] branham said
[1:46:09] not that
[1:46:11] money
[1:46:13] in a crowd of thousands
[1:46:16] only about five
[1:46:18] really caught the revelation at that
[1:46:20] time
[1:46:22] of what he was saying
[1:46:24] that's what i'm talking about so oh
[1:46:26] forget the denominations the bride may
[1:46:29] be in her we don't know who she is she
[1:46:31] can be in the message a lot of people
[1:46:33] think the bride is only in the message
[1:46:36] but she's everywhere
[1:46:39] just like when elijah thought that oh
[1:46:41] i'm the only one lord i'm the only one
[1:46:44] that stand up for the lord of hosts and
[1:46:46] god says no no no no no
[1:46:48] i got some hidden up
[1:46:50] and they're still in the denomination
[1:46:53] they're still in the eating from decibel
[1:46:55] table
[1:46:56] is that right they're right they're
[1:46:58] still in the nomination but i got them
[1:47:00] there for a reason
[1:47:02] i got them there for a purpose
[1:47:04] and later on elijah understood why they
[1:47:06] had to stay in there before they're
[1:47:09] called out or brought out but they had
[1:47:10] to stay in there for a reason for a
[1:47:12] certain time
[1:47:14] and i believe that's right now even
[1:47:16] amongst the denominations god has his
[1:47:19] bride
[1:47:20] out there amen and they're hidden up
[1:47:23] praise god and this power this life
[1:47:26] that's going out it's going to reach
[1:47:28] them wherever they are even if they're
[1:47:30] in the
[1:47:31] bowels of africa down in india if
[1:47:35] they're in the middle of the sahara and
[1:47:36] nobody else is around god can still talk
[1:47:39] to them like he talked abraham god can
[1:47:42] still meet his seed just like he did
[1:47:44] back in the bible days he is still god
[1:47:47] and he still fulfills the word of the
[1:47:49] living god
[1:47:51] amen praise god oh praise god look if
[1:47:54] you feel like getting a glass of water
[1:47:57] and you want to get the glass of water
[1:47:59] and come back that's all right
[1:48:01] you want to get up while i'm preaching
[1:48:03] and stretch so that
[1:48:07] no i'm saying it real praise the name of
[1:48:09] the lord because you know a real proper
[1:48:11] public speaking you speak only for about
[1:48:13] 30 minutes
[1:48:15] or 45 minutes at the most
[1:48:18] and that's the if you get into all the
[1:48:20] psychological things and the mental
[1:48:22] things uh the proper time to speak is so
[1:48:25] many minutes and you should end it there
[1:48:27] and so on so that's the truth that's for
[1:48:30] natural but when you get the spiritual
[1:48:32] things and you begin to preach and teach
[1:48:34] the word of god because i i spoken uh
[1:48:38] there in africa and while i'm speaking
[1:48:41] there the people sit there from mourning
[1:48:43] midday
[1:48:45] there's tilted in there and i'm telling
[1:48:46] you they don't have a roof now they're
[1:48:48] on a big tree and the sun comes down and
[1:48:50] everything else is still there and going
[1:48:52] on and everything else and uh i said no
[1:48:55] no no i gotta stop
[1:48:56] you're gonna kill me
[1:49:01] i can't take this i gotta stomp oh my oh
[1:49:04] my when i stopped brother
[1:49:06] another brother get up when he started
[1:49:08] to speak the people didn't move
[1:49:12] no all of them didn't get the revelation
[1:49:14] but i'm sure a lot of them were getting
[1:49:16] it praise the name of the lord well
[1:49:18] praise god hallelujah a similar thing
[1:49:21] has happened right here in uh
[1:49:24] america down in the southern parts amen
[1:49:27] praise the lord hallelujah but now he's
[1:49:29] talking about israel awakening
[1:49:32] now
[1:49:33] you see this is what we're talking about
[1:49:36] brother branham didn't say what i'm
[1:49:38] going to say here in the word
[1:49:40] but it's like when i read that i can
[1:49:42] literally like see what he
[1:49:44] was thinking
[1:49:46] and what he would what he couldn't say
[1:49:48] it's too much for him to put all them
[1:49:50] things and tell the people at that time
[1:49:53] why are you talking about this aaron's
[1:49:54] rod
[1:49:57] that was left in the temple there
[1:49:59] somebody cut down a stick and made a rod
[1:50:02] for iron
[1:50:05] and a rod that was a healthy growing
[1:50:07] tree type of the bright thrift grows and
[1:50:10] uh things like that
[1:50:12] that thing dried up after a while
[1:50:15] but then when they brought it back
[1:50:18] and they put aaron's rod in the holy
[1:50:20] holies in front of the arctic covenant
[1:50:23] and stick it there in the ground
[1:50:25] when they go back
[1:50:27] the things start budding
[1:50:30] out of this dry stick this dry wood just
[1:50:33] like the bright tree comes out of a
[1:50:35] stump that was chopped down in the
[1:50:37] ground and everybody thought it was dead
[1:50:39] and everything else all of a sudden the
[1:50:41] thing starts blooming again the bible
[1:50:44] tells us and there how errands rod not
[1:50:47] only budded and bloomed it start to bear
[1:50:50] almonds they start to bear fruit almonds
[1:50:55] amen well what is talking about there
[1:50:57] when you see israel waking up top life
[1:51:01] coming into the bride in this hour that

[1:51:19] she going to bring forth almonds like in
[1:51:21] the time of no she is going to bring
[1:51:23] forth the original life
[1:51:27] because that should come from the
[1:51:28] original seed your original life is now
[1:51:31] blooming blossoming and coming forth for
[1:51:34] the glory of the living god amen praise

[1:51:50] come through all these ages and now the
[1:51:53] life coming to the body brings her into
[1:51:56] a time when she began to bud she's come
[1:51:59] through that amen and she can always go
[1:52:02] through that when another person sees it
[1:52:04] just begin and just born into it and
[1:52:06] sees it hallelujah and then she begins
[1:52:09] to blossom praise god but i believe for
[1:52:13] believers who have caught the word for
[1:52:16] some time she is now ripening amen the
[1:52:19] fruit is ripening right there on the
[1:52:22] vine hallelujah and she has now entered
[1:52:25] into her harvest time
[1:52:27] praise god she come from root to blood
[1:52:30] to blossom back to the fruit amen time

[1:52:36] the living god comes on the scene to
[1:52:39] harvest his own word fruit from his own
[1:52:42] word fruit from his own fig tree
[1:52:45] fruit from his own vine for the glory of
[1:52:47] god hallelujah what a lifeline
[1:52:52] you can't even get rid of it
[1:52:54] that's not a lifeline that you can bust
[1:52:57] and break and and the person it breaks
[1:53:00] and and goes out like that praise god

[1:53:36] forever
[1:53:38] is to have eternal life

[1:57:57] you're young you're old you're just
[1:57:59] start to recognize you just came to know
[1:58:02] it hallelujah but or if you've been in
[1:58:05] the message since 65 or 50 whatever

[1:58:11] spiritual complex of anybody because
[1:58:14] they oh i've been in the message now you
[1:58:16] should be listening to me because i've
[1:58:18] been here for 50 years i've been here
[1:58:20] you should have no complex
[1:58:23] none whatsoever

[1:58:30] stand on the ward
[1:58:32] stand on his promise and hold to god's
[1:58:35] unchanging hand amen hallelujah oh
[1:58:38] praise god amen how wonderful now that
[1:58:42] part that is eternal is god and it
[1:58:46] cannot die
[1:58:49] the word the bible is eternal
[1:58:52] because that is god in word form
[1:58:57] see
[1:58:58] oh my but what is in god was in god in
[1:59:03] his thoughts before there was any
[1:59:07] were spoken word
[1:59:10] all of it was god
[1:59:12] amen it was god
[1:59:15] hallelujah let me go back over that
[1:59:18] the part that's eternal is god
[1:59:21] and cannot die
[1:59:22] now the word the bible is eternal
[1:59:26] because it is god
[1:59:29] in word form
[1:59:31] and what was in god in his thoughts
[1:59:34] before there was any spoken word or
[1:59:37] before god spoke it
[1:59:40] it was all god
[1:59:42] hallelujah amen
[1:59:44] oh my praise god
[1:59:47] what is in you
[1:59:48] you
[1:59:51] all that is in you is you

[1:59:55] fingernail it's you
[1:59:56] uh whether it's your eyebrow it's still
[1:59:59] you
[2:00:00] whether it's a stranded hair it's you
[2:00:03] you see anything that was in god at the
[2:00:07] time when it's taking
[2:00:10] even though it was not even spoke as yet
[2:00:13] because a word is a thought
[2:00:17] is that right
[2:00:19] then when the thought is spoken the
[2:00:21] thought becomes spoken word
[2:00:25] and when the spoken word is believed and
[2:00:27] comes into a person a believer
[2:00:31] and they begin to live that word it
[2:00:33] becomes the
[2:00:34] living epistles living word
[2:00:38] but go back
[2:00:40] don't let it blow your mind
[2:00:43] where did all this word or the life line
[2:00:46] the line of life you followed now
[2:00:49] where did it all come from it was in god

[2:01:08] amen and so we are parts of him
[2:01:12] that
[2:01:13] are eternal amen i thank god and now you
[2:01:16] can sit and listen to hear the rolling
[2:01:19] thunder
[2:01:21] and the thunder roll from out of the
[2:01:23] word of god and you're not scared of the
[2:01:25] thunders now because you recognize a

[2:01:54] you better start paying attention to
[2:01:55] those seven thunders
[2:01:57] you better start going in and all the
[2:01:59] brothers start studying and looking into
[2:02:02] those things and it woke the whole
[2:02:03] bridal
[2:02:05] it woke him up praise the name of the
[2:02:06] lord but then he fulfilled his purpose
[2:02:09] amen praise god but you see those seven
[2:02:13] thunders didn't come to give us more
[2:02:15] eternal life the seven thunders just
[2:02:19] came to sound out and wake up the seed
[2:02:23] that was already laying there to make it
[2:02:25] come awake look i don't know if the
[2:02:27] doctors still do it now
[2:02:29] but back in the old days when a baby was
[2:02:32] born the doctor would grab the baby by
[2:02:35] the two feet pick it up
[2:02:37] and give that baby a slap on the bum pow
[2:02:41] and

[2:02:56] seven thunders
[2:02:58] give that baby life did the slap give
[2:03:02] the baby life
[2:03:04] or that slap only
[2:03:07] allowed the baby to manifest that it has
[2:03:10] life
[2:03:12] it just woke up and come to life
[2:03:16] and prove that it it's a thing is the
[2:03:19] life thing is in it

[2:04:36] that was predestinated
[2:04:39] that
[2:04:41] was predestinated
[2:04:43] was the thing
[2:04:45] that was
[2:04:47] with god
[2:04:48] in eternity
[2:04:50] what
[2:04:51] that was predestinated the thing that
[2:04:54] was in god in eternity
[2:04:57] the oh my
[2:04:59] what was the thing
[2:05:01] that was with god
[2:05:04] way back in eternity the germ
[2:05:07] the gene
[2:05:09] praise god now let's go and expand on
[2:05:11] that a little bit more you you remember
[2:05:14] when the angel came to mary he says the
[2:05:17] holy thing that will be born of thee
[2:05:22] amen brother brethren saying now this
[2:05:25] predestinated thing amen praise god so
[2:05:29] we got some predestinated things
[2:05:33] some sacred things of god hallelujah in
[2:05:37] this hour
[2:05:38] born from the word of god holy things of
[2:05:42] god that were in god and set down here
[2:05:45] to fulfill purpose praise god god bless
[2:05:48] you all today and i want you to just
[2:05:51] quickly recap here because i said a lot
[2:05:53] of things
[2:05:54] and i want you to
[2:05:56] pick them in your heart and remember
[2:05:59] them and grow by them amen so today what
[2:06:03] we talked about really is that god
[2:06:06] is not only we were in him but he is in
[2:06:10] us
[2:06:12] we spoke furthermore on
[2:06:15] the word
[2:06:16] of life
[2:06:18] amen for the word gives life
[2:06:22] we touched on the supreme importance
[2:06:26] not just of revelation but of individual
[2:06:30] revelation
[2:06:32] then we touched
[2:06:35] on
[2:06:36] why all hell
[2:06:38] is against this teaching
[2:06:41] of individual revelation and of all the
[2:06:44] other things
[2:06:45] that they
[2:06:47] uh corrupt controve church doesn't want
[2:06:50] you to know
[2:06:51] and we touched on certain things god
[2:06:53] being one god jesus being the christ
[2:06:55] water baptism being in the name of jesus
[2:06:58] and the origin of sin and so on praise
[2:07:02] the lord of god hallelujah
[2:07:04] and then we touched on
[2:07:07] the headship
[2:07:09] of the word of god
[2:07:11] the word the revealed word is the
[2:07:13] headship
[2:07:15] over the his body
[2:07:19] the word of god wants to take
[2:07:21] preeminence of our lives
[2:07:23] so that he might manifest himself as the
[2:07:27] head of the entire body
[2:07:31] then we touched upon the lifeline and
[2:07:34] what it is
[2:07:36] a little bit
[2:07:38] that it's the bloodline
[2:07:40] that we're in a line
[2:07:42] of his life living our life in line with
[2:07:45] his life
[2:07:46] proving that we are in his bloodline
[2:07:50] and that we are of his generation for
[2:07:53] the prophets already prophesied
[2:07:55] and he shall see his generation right so
[2:07:59] we are proving that by living the word
[2:08:01] of god hallelujah the great bloodline
[2:08:05] and we touched also and emphasized that
[2:08:09] you always had eternal life
[2:08:13] you always had eternal life you can't
[2:08:15] get more of it
[2:08:17] you can't get less of it you can't be
[2:08:19] taken out of it whatever but you
[2:08:23] always had eternal life just like a son
[2:08:26] can't get his father's blood out of his
[2:08:29] veins he can't do it anymore
[2:08:32] he's just a son what's he going to do
[2:08:34] about it he can be a bad son he can be a
[2:08:37] wicked son he could be a disobedient son
[2:08:40] but he is still a son
[2:08:42] it is not his condition you have to
[2:08:44] worry about it is his position
[2:08:47] because his positions of sonship his
[2:08:50] condition might be sinful his condition
[2:08:52] might be error and what not but he's
[2:08:55] still a son of the living god hallelujah
[2:08:58] amen and then lastly we just touched
[2:09:02] on recognizing you're a part or you have
[2:09:07] a part of that holy thing
[2:09:10] in you
[2:09:11] that holy thing being the germ the gene
[2:09:14] of god within your heart
[2:09:17] is that right
[2:09:19] we have an anchor that keeps the soul
[2:09:22] what is that anchor
[2:09:24] and we just imagine like you got an
[2:09:26] anchor and you you throw it up there in
[2:09:28] heaven and and it hook on to something
[2:09:31] and you're going to escape this world by
[2:09:33] climbing up that rope no the lifeline is
[2:09:36] in you
[2:09:38] the haven of rest is right there
[2:09:42] you you come to a blessed assurance you
[2:09:44] come to us peaceful rest because you
[2:09:46] know the germ
[2:09:48] the gene
[2:09:49] the attribute
[2:09:51] is in you
[2:09:53] and that is what is your blessing the
[2:09:55] show runs
[2:09:57] that you are going to make it open on
[2:09:59] the other side
[2:10:02] hallelujah
[2:10:03] and so
[2:10:05] i thank god
[2:10:06] that in this hour the great eagle
[2:10:10] is once again passing over the barnyard
[2:10:13] as we have said it before
[2:10:15] and when he looks down
[2:10:17] and he looks at us
[2:10:19] he sees
[2:10:21] a
[2:10:22] small
[2:10:23] token
[2:10:25] of god
[2:10:26] in you
[2:10:28] a portion of god that's what he sees
[2:10:32] in you
[2:10:33] and by seeing
[2:10:35] that token in you
[2:10:38] he comes to claim that token
[2:10:41] is that right
[2:10:42] that's why the holy spirit baptizes you
[2:10:44] into himself into himself who is work
[2:10:47] is washing all over you
[2:10:49] right see because he sees that and he
[2:10:53] waters that by the grace of god and
[2:10:56] quickens you
[2:10:58] and what does he do
[2:11:01] brings you all to the world
[2:11:03] brings you from the flesh brings you
[2:11:05] from the influence of the devil what i'm
[2:11:07] saying he brings you out of the devil's
[2:11:09] pawn shop
[2:11:10] [Music]
[2:11:12] and while you were in that pawnshop the
[2:11:13] devil had temporary control
[2:11:16] but now thank god you're free
[2:11:19] you're a new creation
[2:11:22] [Applause]
[2:11:24] that god has only now come to claim
[2:11:27] his own property
[2:11:29] it was always his property
[2:11:33] he just left it in the world he let's
[2:11:35] allow it to go in the pawn shop
[2:11:37] hallelujah but but he has a token
[2:11:41] and and there's a token that's in there
[2:11:43] and that's token is there so he comes
[2:11:45] the holy spirit comes part of the token
[2:11:48] and he looks for the other part of the
[2:11:51] token to see if they're going to fit
[2:11:54] and when they fit the deep calls to the
[2:11:57] deep
[2:11:59] and a deep response
[2:12:01] and there comes an invisible union
[2:12:04] a perfect realization
[2:12:07] a recognition of who
[2:12:10] you really are praise god may the lord
