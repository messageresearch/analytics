[0:17] [Music]
[0:18] What then?
[0:21] When the great book is open. What then?
[0:28] And the ones that's rejecting
[0:32] this message
[0:34] today
[0:36] will be ask to give a reason.
[0:41] [Music]
[0:43] Our gracious God and heavenly father,
[0:47] I've done my part. I minister the word
[0:51] of God to your people.
[0:54] all these that are under the voice of
[0:57] God or the influence of the sound of the
[1:01] gospel.
[1:04] Father,
[1:06] may your great spirit go forth to this
[1:08] congregation and speak into the heart of
[1:11] someone that has been thinking about it
[1:14] and knows that they need to turn their
[1:17] life around.
[1:19] They know that they need to be baptized
[1:21] the right way. Not in Father, Son, and
[1:23] Holy Ghost, but in the name of the Lord
[1:25] Jesus Christ. One God, one name, one
[1:30] baptism, one faith, one fellowship.
[1:33] Father,
[1:35] young people that have been struggling
[1:37] with temptation,
[1:40] trouble, trial,
[1:43] tested by their friends.
[1:46] Oh God,
[1:49] speak to them today. Call them by this
[1:52] message.
[1:53] Just before I hand over to the worship
[1:56] lady, Father, I want to pray for them
[1:59] and with them.
[2:02] Lord Jesus, give them the strength to
[2:05] resist the devil who is going to try to
[2:08] block and stop them and tell them you
[2:10] don't have to do that. Father, give them
[2:12] the opportunity, Lord, to overcome the
[2:14] law of gravity and raise even one hand
[2:17] so that I can have an idea that I need
[2:20] to pray for them in this congregation.
[2:23] Now, those of you who are here today and
[2:25] somehow God's spirit has spoken to you
[2:27] that you need a closer walk with God or
[2:30] you need to know him in a in a
[2:32] relationship with him. Would you slip
[2:34] your hand up right now while I say a
[2:36] word of prayer? I see hands up
[2:38] everywhere. Amen. Praise God. I'm glad
[2:41] we're not ashamed of him. I'll never be
[2:44] ashamed of him. Father God, I thank you
[2:47] this today, this this day for these
[2:50] hands of the rough raised a dozen or
[2:53] more.
[2:54] Father, it's not the raising of our
[2:56] hands, but it's the obedience to your
[2:59] word and the acknowledgment that there
[3:01] is something that this soul needs today.
[3:05] And I ask that your great Holy Spirit
[3:08] will minister to them right now whatever
[3:11] that need is and speak to that need.
[3:14] Father, help that young person. Deliver
[3:18] them. Father, break any habit.
[3:22] [Music]
[3:23] Heal every one of us. Whether the deed
[3:27] is natural,
[3:28] spiritual, supernatural,
[3:31] Satan, come out from amongst the people.
[3:35] Amen. Lose their lives and stop trying
[3:38] to shackle them so that they can't
[3:41] hardly even repent. They can't hardly
[3:45] give their life to God because you
[3:47] you're trying to stop their fountain,
[3:49] stop their their their inclination when
[3:51] they know they need to change their
[3:53] lives. Father, I call upon you today in
[3:57] the name of Jesus Christ. This may be
[4:00] your last chance.
[4:03] This could be your last autumn call.
[4:07] We had somebody in here just a few weeks
[4:10] ago sitting right in the back. God
[4:13] blessed her heart. She was a believer.
[4:16] We all rejoiced together. We talked. I
[4:19] went out. I had supper with them. Left
[4:22] and came back not knowing that was the
[4:25] last time I was ever going to see them
[4:28] or see that person. Let me tell you, God
[4:31] has no respector for a person. You see
[4:33] your wife young. Uh let me tell you,
[4:36] grace come in all sizes. And when you
[4:39] hear God speaking to you and you don't
[4:40] obey the voice of God, God will set your
[4:43] field on fire.
[4:45] God will bring affliction. God will
[4:48] bring signs. He'll bring things in your
[4:50] life to let you know that you are
[4:52] resisting his will and not responding to
[4:55] the Holy Spirit of Almighty God. And I'm
[4:58] here as a servant to warn you. Amen. And
[5:01] those of you who are here backst from
[5:04] the word back to the word. Hallelujah.
[5:06] Your place is in church. Your place is
[5:08] in the house of God. Hallelujah. Amen.
[5:12] Amen. And those who should have been
[5:15] here this morning and they're not here.
[5:16] When we're here discussing, you
[5:18] recognize God is speaking to you and
[5:20] calling out to you. Back to the word,
[5:23] back to your position. Yes, Lord. You
[5:26] want to be baptized in water,
[5:31] not just to believe,
[5:34] but say, "Lord, I now want to belong.
[5:38] I want to know truly that this is my
[5:40] home church.
[5:42] I want to support it with my presence. I
[5:44] want to support it in every other way.
[5:46] Whether it's be with my faith, prayer,
[5:48] finances, whatever, I want to support
[5:51] it." Then acknowledge it. Don't be
[5:53] ashamed. Acknowledge it. And if you feel
[5:56] God is speaking to you and you want to
[5:58] be baptized in water, say, "Lord, I want
[6:01] to be changed and I want to be baptized
[6:04] in water." And seal myself in to say, "I
[6:07] have one of them." Praise the Lord.
[6:09] Hallelujah. Then see one of the deacons
[6:13] or trustees and say, "Brother, I have
[6:16] made this decision. I want to be
[6:18] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[6:21] Christ." Amen. And God knows your heart.
[6:25] I'm not a pre Catholic priest that you
[6:27] have to come and confess to me. But
[6:29] there's a great high priest here. His
[6:31] name is the Lord Jesus Christ. And you
[6:33] can speak to him from in the closet of
[6:35] your heart and he will hear you and he
[6:39] will answer
[6:41] your prayers and give you the desire of
[6:45] your heart. You know, praise the Lord.
[6:48] I'm waiting. You know why I'm waiting?
[6:50] until the Holy Spirit tell you to stop
[6:52] because he's pleading here for somebody
[6:54] that's in this congregation here today.
[6:56] And I hope you will obey the voice of
[6:58] God in this hour. Amen. Praise be to
[7:02] God. Once in the stillness
[7:07] of a late midnight hour,
[7:10] I felt the sweet presence
[7:14] [Music]
[7:15] of the Lord's saving power.
[7:20] I fell on my knees
[7:24] and I cried to him there.
[7:28] Oh merciful Savior,
[7:31] [Music]
[7:33] hear a lost sinner's prayer.
[7:37] Well, every hour
[7:41] [Music]
[7:42] and every day,
[7:47] in every moment,
[7:51] in every way,
[7:54] I'm leaning on Jesus.
[7:58] He is the rock of my soul.
[8:03] I'm singing his praisees.
[8:08] Wherever
[8:12] once in the stillness of a late midnight
[8:14] hour
[8:16] might be a midnight hour for you
[8:18] friends. I don't know. But we we serve a
[8:22] God that can bring you leftour
[8:24] deliverance and take you out of your
[8:27] situation just before the devil tries to
[8:30] swallow you alive.
[8:32] come while there is yet time to come and
[8:36] surrender your heart to him now.
[8:40] Father, I pray for these that should
[8:43] obey your word and may still be
[8:46] resisting.
[8:48] For those who raise their hands and obey
[8:50] the spirit's call, I pray that you will
[8:54] honor their faith. For those others that
[8:57] are in between, may the great Holy
[8:59] Spirit continue to deal with them and
[9:03] convict and haunt them long after
[9:06] they've left this place. May they hear
[9:08] the voice of God speaking in their ears.
[9:11] You know
[9:13] that you should have obeyed that call.
[9:18] You know that you should have repented.
[9:22] You know that you should have changed
[9:24] your life.
[9:26] to walk the right way and separate
[9:30] yourself from the things of the past.
[9:34] Oh God, may your spirit continue to
[9:38] speak
[9:39] and deal with them
[9:42] long after I've left this pulpit and
[9:44] they've gone away from this place and
[9:46] trying to forget it. Oh God, seal it
[9:49] away in their soul. Father, let them
[9:52] know the power of apostolic faith and
[9:55] power.
[9:56] Not by might nor by power, but by your
[10:00] spirit, say the Lord. Thank you, Father.
[10:03] Take all the praise and the honor and
[10:06] the glory from this service here today
[10:09] in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. And
[10:13] amen. God richly bless every one of you.
[10:18] I want to know that my heart and my
[10:21] hands are clean.
[10:24] Because the Bible says, son of man, if
[10:26] you warn them and they don't heal, then
[10:29] their blood was on their own head.
[10:32] But if you don't warn them, their blood
[10:34] is going to be on your hands. I warned
[10:37] you, young and old, high and low, rich
[10:40] and poor. are warned you according to
[10:43] the word that God seems like he was
[10:45] giving at last the call to somebody here
[10:48] today. He warning and obey the call.
[10:53] Amen. God bless you.
[10:56] God bless you.
