[17:10] Applause yeah before we even start I
[17:13] just want to encourage everyone that is
[17:16] here that in the time of winter when you
[17:20] making that sacrifice to come that's
[17:23] when I believe that God blesses us um I
[17:26] know it's not a easy sacrifice
[17:29] but in every time when the people made a
[17:32] sacrifice God blessed them and it's not
[17:36] about the majority said where two or
[17:38] three are gathered in my name I'll be in
[17:41] your midst if you remember the story
[17:43] that I think talk about DWI Med that
[17:46] when that man when the lady was sing the
[17:49] tracks nobody showed up but one person
[17:54] that led to his conversion and recently
[17:57] something that was on Google about David
[17:59] Livingston they also talk about in the
[18:02] time of winter when the missionary went
[18:06] back to home Church to tell them to kind
[18:09] of um get people to go to Africa but he
[18:14] he preached and there was only Ed people
[18:16] it was a winter time but he was with the
[18:20] organist and he converted from that and
[18:23] became a missionary for the gospel of
[18:25] God so anytime sometime when you don't
[18:28] even feel like coming that's when you're
[18:30] going to get your blessings so you have
[18:32] to fight through and be here because do
[18:35] not forsake the Assembly of yourself
[18:37] even as the time appears amen so you can
[18:41] sit down Pastor Danny can you please
[18:43] lead us in prayer amen praise God let's
[18:46] pray father what an honor and what a
[18:49] priv tonight be here to receive your
[18:53] word to be in your presence Lord you
[18:55] were waiting for us even before we arve
[18:59] and now we know that you'll speak to our
[19:00] hearts because you'll an your word your
[19:04] minister brother Phil this evening Lord
[19:07] to just build yourself and allow you to
[19:10] speak to our hearts and our needs and I
[19:13] pray that you'll just pour out a bless
[19:15] father will
[19:17] not pra
[19:20] glory
[19:25] lordes amen okay I think the L scripture
[19:29] but I'm going to cut it off somewhere
[19:30] along the line um it's m 2 Kings 6 8-23
[19:36] I might cut up I don't want to I won't
[19:38] let you stay for too long 2 Kings
[19:41] chapter 6 verse 8 to
[19:44] 23 I think I'll cut it up
[19:48] somewhere yeah
[19:57] okay then the king of Syria W against
[20:01] Israel and took counsel with his
[20:04] servants saying in such and such a place
[20:10] shall be my camp and the man of God sent
[20:14] unto the king of Israel saying
[20:19] beware beware that thou pass not such a
[20:23] place
[20:25] for th that the Ser are come down
[20:29] and the king of Israel sent to the place
[20:32] which the man of God told him and warn
[20:34] him off and saved himself thereof and
[20:37] not once or nor twice so so many times
[20:41] therefore the heart of the king of Syria
[20:43] was so troubl for this
[20:46] thing and he called his servants and
[20:48] said unto them will ye not show me which
[20:51] of us is of the king of
[20:53] Israel and one of his servants said n my
[20:57] Lord oh oh King but elishah the prophet
[21:02] that is in Israel tell the king of
[21:05] Israel the words that speakers in thy
[21:09] bed
[21:11] chamber verse 13 and he said go and spy
[21:16] where he is that I may sent and fetch
[21:19] him and it was told him saying behold
[21:21] he's in Doan here our former pastor
[21:24] always talk about it that how can you go
[21:26] and look for somebody who knows what is
[21:28] happening in your
[21:29] chamber yeah and when the servant of the
[21:34] man of God was risen early and gone
[21:38] forth behold and host Compass the city
[21:41] both with horses and CHS and the servant
[21:44] said unto him alas my
[21:47] master how shall we do and he answered
[21:51] fear not for they that be with us are
[21:57] more than they that be with
[22:00] them and Elisha prayed and said Lord I
[22:03] pray thee open his eyes that he may see
[22:08] and the Lord opened the eyes of the
[22:10] young man and he saw and behold the
[22:13] mountain was full of horses and cheros
[22:16] of fire R about Elisha um just let's
[22:21] Isaiah 651 and2 if our title the title
[22:25] is um the opening of the spiritual eyes
[22:28] of the bright the opening of the
[22:29] spiritual eyes so Isaiah 651
[22:39] and2 I am s of them that ask not for me
[22:43] I'm fond of them that sought me not I
[22:47] said behold me behold me unto a nation
[22:52] that was not called by my name I have
[22:56] spread out my hands all the day onto the
[22:58] rebellious people which work in a way
[23:01] that was not good after their own
[23:04] thoughts Heavenly Father
[23:06] please bless the reading of your word in
[23:10] Jesus name amen please be
[23:12] seated yeah so um my title is the
[23:16] opening of your spiritual
[23:19] eyes
[23:21] because um we see from our heart but not
[23:26] from our
[23:27] eyes sometimes
[23:30] um we have to forgive some people
[23:32] because sometime maybe somebody will be
[23:34] looking right in your face but his heart
[23:37] is not even right there so they might
[23:39] not even greet you or ignore you and
[23:41] going to be angry but maybe that person
[23:44] heart is not even there so we see
[23:47] through our heart not our eyes our eyes
[23:51] is good God gave us our eyes to
[23:54] contact um our five senses but when it
[23:59] comes the word of God you
[24:01] cannot see God through only your natural
[24:04] eye it's like um reading the Bible you
[24:08] can read this Bible from A to
[24:10] Z from Genesis to Revelation 20 times a
[24:14] year but if God has start open your
[24:17] spiritual eyes it's just worse it's just
[24:20] letters because the Bible said that the
[24:22] letter kth but the spirit giveth life
[24:26] amen so we always need to ask Lord for
[24:29] the opening of our spiritual eyes that's
[24:32] why the the word said that our eyes of
[24:34] understanding he has open up at last so
[24:38] we as Believers we are blessed that by
[24:41] the grace of God God has opened our eyes
[24:44] of understanding the story we talking
[24:46] about G ha his natural eyes were 100%
[24:50] open but all that he could see was those
[24:56] enemies around them but Elisha been
[24:59] typee of the Bride he
[25:03] saw beyond what the servant was seeing
[25:07] and he prayed and said oh God Open the
[25:10] Eyes of the young man and when his eyes
[25:13] was open then he can see what elishah
[25:16] was saying was seeing so the god of God
[25:20] the Lord has called us to this reveal
[25:23] word of God Amen and you
[25:27] cannot let somebody see it
[25:31] unless God open that person eyes then he
[25:34] can see like you are
[25:36] seeing other than that you can just do
[25:42] what you can just
[25:45] try
[25:46] sorry you can just try to convince the
[25:50] person and braad Des always said if I
[25:52] have the power I can just open your head
[25:56] like that and put the word in
[25:59] no one can do that it's only given by
[26:02] God and it's h no one can open
[26:07] anyone's Blind Eye so what this young
[26:11] man failed to know is that the scripture
[26:16] said the angel of God encamp around
[26:18] those who love him so um being the love
[26:23] of God Elisha loving God Angels were
[26:26] around him all the time so is you and me
[26:30] some of us would have been dead for long
[26:32] long time but the grace of God has kept
[26:36] as this far the angel of God encamp
[26:39] around us even on the street driving how
[26:43] many times last week I was driving I
[26:45] would have even had a big accident I was
[26:47] just on my Lane somebody just coming
[26:50] from um I was just um like merging and I
[26:55] haven't even tried to merge and the
[26:57] person in in the last Lane was just
[27:01] moving towards to where me I was merging
[27:04] there crazy people around but the spirit
[27:06] for God and Camp around us it protect us
[27:10] every day every morning he is the one
[27:13] protecting us that's why the Bible say
[27:15] greater is he that is in you than he
[27:18] that in the world the world the god that
[27:20] lives in you is greater than any
[27:22] circumstances you may encounter because
[27:25] he's the same yesterday today and
[27:28] forever he's there for you it doesn't
[27:30] matter what the spirit of God encamp
[27:33] around those who love him and M of us
[27:36] would have been dead already but by the
[27:39] grace of God and God has kept it all
[27:42] this to the end of all the consumation
[27:45] he will never leave you nor forsake you
[27:48] even though sometimes your natural eyes
[27:51] will prove something different but don't
[27:55] look at what you are seeing with your
[27:57] eyes because Faith goes beyond what you
[28:00] see it goes beyond what your eyes see
[28:03] and without faith it's impossible to
[28:06] please God and faith is a revelation and
[28:09] having a new birth is what Jesus Christ
[28:12] revealed himself personally to you will
[28:15] give you that new birth without the new
[28:17] birth you can't please God because he's
[28:19] the same yesterday today and forever
[28:23] amen and what is happening now is that
[28:28] in Revelation
[28:30] 3:17 I think I read it
[28:35] shortly in Revelation
[28:38] 3:17 it says that because thou sayest
[28:42] I'm rich and increase with goods and
[28:46] have need of nothing and knowest not
[28:48] that thou are what wretched and
[28:51] miserable and poor and blind and naked I
[28:55] canel Thee to buy of me gold try in the
[28:58] fire that thou may be rich and white
[29:01] rment that thou may be clothed and that
[29:03] the shame of thy nakedness do not appear
[29:06] and they anoint thy eyes with I love
[29:09] that thou made what see so the promise
[29:13] of this age Lord this AG the people are
[29:16] what blind naked miserable but because
[29:21] they are natural eyes they don't see
[29:23] that they are
[29:24] blind and they are naked and they don't
[29:27] even see nothing so they need the
[29:29] opening of their spiritual eyes to see
[29:32] God and without that your spiritual eyes
[29:35] being open you can never see God you can
[29:39] never please God but we are blessed that
[29:44] by his grace he has opened our eyes of
[29:47] understanding and in every age in every
[29:51] time the True Believers for that age God
[29:56] opened their
[29:58] spiritual eyes to see what he is doing
[30:03] Amen in the time of he said that the
[30:05] true worshippers must worship me what in
[30:09] truth and in spirit so in the time of
[30:14] Luther when the truth and the spirit was
[30:17] revealed to him he was able to please
[30:20] God because they were pleas recognize
[30:24] what was doing what God was doing in
[30:27] that Time by their natural eyes their
[30:31] eyes being their spiritual eyes being
[30:32] open to know the spir the truth and
[30:36] spirit for their age in the time of
[30:39] Methodist exact same thing God opened
[30:42] those people spiritual eyes to see that
[30:45] what John Wesley was truth and they all
[30:47] really what behind him and serve God
[30:51] because they have the truth and spirit
[30:53] for that age and Pentecost exact same
[30:57] thing when their eyes their spiritual
[30:59] eyes open they understood and and what
[31:03] was able to please God and God send us
[31:06] William myON Braham to fulfill Malachi
[31:10] 456 Revelation 10:7 to restore all the
[31:14] truth for the eyes of understanding of
[31:17] those who are God's children to receive
[31:20] the word for that day and their eyes
[31:23] were open but now is Elijah and Elisha
[31:27] now the spirit of God God has taken his
[31:30] Prophet but the same spirit that was in
[31:33] the prophet is here it's like double
[31:35] portion Elijah Elisha amen and what is
[31:38] leading us to is revealing himself to US
[31:41] Open our eyes of understanding every day
[31:45] that we comeing here he's revealing
[31:47] himself to us slowly slowly until we be
[31:50] caught up to meet up the Lord in the end
[31:52] that is the promise that is the word for
[31:54] the day that is what we are here to
[31:57] fulfill we are the ones to fulfill the
[31:59] Rapture there's no one else there's no
[32:02] any other age but the bride of Christ we
[32:05] are here to fulfill the Rapture and that
[32:08] is the Fulfillment of our day that's we
[32:11] have the truth and the spirit for the
[32:14] day so when God reveal himself to you
[32:18] and make this clear to you because your
[32:21] first revelation that's when you what
[32:23] the Rapture started but it's going to
[32:25] lead goes on onto what the final thing
[32:28] so we are blessed that our eyes of
[32:32] understanding God has opened it at last
[32:36] the original life yes is grace and grace
[32:39] that's why in
[32:40] Isaiah 65 ver1 and 2 I think I read it
[32:44] again it says that I am s of
[32:47] them
[32:52] who I'm s of them that ask not for me
[32:55] I'm F of them that sought me not I said
[32:59] behold I unto that was not called by so
[33:03] in other words you did not see
[33:05] God God was what seeking after you just
[33:10] like the eagle story it was that mother
[33:13] Eagle looking for that egg that he left
[33:16] somewhere so it's you and me that Papa
[33:19] Eagle God himself was on was looking for
[33:22] you he said that you have not chosen me
[33:26] I chose you before the foundation of the
[33:28] world why did God chose you because of
[33:31] election because of elected seed you are
[33:34] part of him so before the foundation of
[33:37] the world he being god with his full
[33:40] knowledge know that you're going to
[33:42] accept him so you not wait for you to
[33:44] accept him first but he made a provision
[33:47] and a way for you so in our own ways we
[33:50] were running away from him our life
[33:53] everything nothing none of us thought
[33:55] God but God came after
[33:58] because we are part of him of him so
[34:01] it's based on what election it's
[34:04] elective love that has brought us all
[34:08] here and that same God is here he's the
[34:11] same yesterday today and forever it's
[34:14] not by
[34:15] W of righteousness by his grace and
[34:18] grace alone and is based on what is
[34:22] based on elective love amen and the eyes
[34:27] of understand because listen even the
[34:29] Jews in um Romans 11:25 they were what
[34:34] blinded so that you and I can be what
[34:37] drafted in and I believe that if we wake
[34:41] up every morning and recognize that God
[34:44] has opened our eyes of understanding in
[34:47] the midst of the age where people are
[34:49] blinded as blind as blind can be we have
[34:52] to give God thanks every morning every
[34:55] day wake up for the revelation of this
[34:57] he has given to us it's beyond
[35:00] everything
[35:01] Revelation more than anything
[35:05] else that's what we are Holding On by
[35:08] the grace of God his elective love he
[35:12] has chose you he has chosen me before
[35:14] the foundation of the world and he he
[35:17] been s he's been seeking us all this
[35:19] time it doesn't matter what but God
[35:22] loves you he cares for you so that love
[35:25] of God imagine like
[35:28] if
[35:29] you that has received the word of God
[35:32] for the day if you have been transported
[35:34] back the time of Noah you could have be
[35:37] part of Noah's family that eight people
[35:40] that received the Revelation for the day
[35:43] just think about that out of millions of
[35:46] people and now out of
[35:49] billions God by his grace has elected
[35:53] you and me that's the greatest thing
[35:56] that could ever happened to anyone of us
[35:59] because he sought to us he looked for us
[36:02] he came for us he chose us and he ordain
[36:06] us Amen to this gospel to this Truth for
[36:09] our age amen he's the same yesterday
[36:13] today and forever amen and this thing
[36:18] you cannot buy it he gives and remember
[36:22] someone like
[36:24] Nicodemus he knew the scriptures
[36:28] A to Z from those times he was a
[36:32] master and he came the Lord Jesus Christ
[36:36] but because his spiritual eyes was
[36:40] closed and it was not open he couldn't
[36:43] even understand to be born again and he
[36:47] was asking how can I be born again I
[36:49] have to go back into my mother's womb to
[36:51] be born again he was blind spiritually
[36:54] he couldn't see nothing but he was a
[36:56] master
[36:58] so it's not how much you know the letter
[37:03] the letter kill it but the spirit giveth
[37:06] life amen this thing is based on
[37:08] elective seedr said somewhere that
[37:11] king after God told him to go and make a
[37:15] good sacrifice he couldn't make it
[37:17] because there was a wrong seed over
[37:19] there how can he make a perfect
[37:21] sacrifice with the wrong seed it will
[37:22] not work but Abel with a good seed a
[37:26] right seed in him he was was able to
[37:28] make a sacrifice that God testified of
[37:31] it so before God will testify of your of
[37:34] anything from you you have to have that
[37:36] good seed you have to be part of him so
[37:39] that when you do it he will reveal it to
[37:41] you and when you do it it will be a
[37:44] pleasing unto him with those with the
[37:46] wrong SE they cannot do it like K they
[37:49] will try to make it look more beautiful
[37:51] on the outside big Cathedral and it it
[37:55] it all go to your s and everything but
[37:57] God is not in it amen he is in his word
[38:01] for the day and without him revealing
[38:04] the truth to you you can't say it you
[38:07] can be the the they call them themselves
[38:10] the bishop or Cardinal or whatever they
[38:13] going to call you without the grace of
[38:15] God that God reveal himself to you your
[38:18] worship is in vain and say in vain they
[38:21] what they worship me doing what the
[38:23] Commandments of of of men and traditions
[38:27] they have added a lot to this Bible and
[38:29] bring all kind of manner Traditions
[38:31] baptizing them the name of the father
[38:33] Son and Holy Ghost and ly men to pre
[38:36] doing everything contrary worse than
[38:39] when he was here the first time when
[38:41] they were exchanging and buying things
[38:43] in the church and now they have make it
[38:46] a what moneymaking scheme when brah
[38:50] explained in the Simplicity um I think
[38:53] in
[38:54] the the seven6 when you read the first
[38:56] part god in Simplicity when you come to
[38:59] church you have to come to reverence
[39:01] even the in the in the in the Cent
[39:04] nobody have to talk unless it's
[39:06] absolutely necessary become reverent and
[39:10] expect God God will show up because you
[39:13] have what as um we have obeyed that word
[39:17] because in token said that total
[39:19] obedience to the full word of God
[39:22] entitles you to token you can't come in

[42:18] he will never lose a patient amen
[42:21] hallelujah he's God he's on time God
[42:25] Amen he never changes hallelujah praise
[42:28] God I I think I'm going to read another
[42:30] scripture Bible Bible said this you
[42:33] don't
[42:35] mind me reading a lot of
[42:41] scriptures Matthew chapter 13 verse
[42:50] 11 he answered 11 to 17 is that right he
[42:54] answered and said unto them because it
[42:56] is given unto you to know the mysteries
[43:00] of the kingdom of heaven but to them it
[43:03] is not
[43:05] given for whosoever had to him shall be
[43:08] given and he shall have more abundance
[43:10] but whosoever had not from him shall be
[43:14] taken away even that he had therefore
[43:18] speak I to them in Parables because they
[43:22] seeing see not and hearing they hear not
[43:27] neither do they understand and in them
[43:31] is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaias
[43:35] which said by hearing ye shall hear and
[43:38] shall not understand and seeing ye shall
[43:42] see and shall not perceive for this
[43:46] people's heart is what is wor gross and
[43:50] their ears are dll of what hearing and
[43:54] the eyes they have closed let's at any
[43:57] time they should see with their eyes and
[44:00] hear with their ears and shall be what
[44:03] understand with their heart and should
[44:04] be converted and I should heal them
[44:08] verse 16 but blessed are your eyes thank
[44:12] you for they see and your ears for day
[44:16] here we have to give God thanks because
[44:19] blessed are your eyes that you shall see
[44:23] amen you didn't make yourself like that
[44:25] you can't even help God sometime reveals
[44:28] so many things to you we didn't do
[44:31] nothing but it's so clear maybe the next
[44:33] person that out there doesn't know what
[44:35] is going on and God can make you design
[44:38] so many everything is going on but the
[44:40] next person don't even have a clue that
[44:42] is what's going on it's not what you
[44:44] work for this is by grace and grace and
[44:49] somebody why did God do that he's a
[44:51] sovereign God and they ask why did God
[44:54] allow this why did God allow that is God
[44:57] having pleasure that's why in the end is
[44:59] God having pleasure so you are great you
[45:04] are privilege that for his pleasure we
[45:09] were created so for this cause Pharaoh
[45:13] was created that God's glory will be
[45:17] what
[45:18] glorified he was had was
[45:22] Harden so that God's glory could be
[45:25] glorified remember
[45:28] there
[45:29] arose I think I'm going ahead of that's
[45:32] fine there arose a pharaoh who did not
[45:36] know
[45:37] um who did not Jo Joseph but before that
[45:42] Pharaoh get to the power God was also
[45:47] dealing with Moses is that right and
[45:49] Moses was also in the wilderness and God
[45:52] was dealing with
[45:53] him and that pharaoh who came with not
[45:57] know Joseph persecute the children of
[46:02] God he P put persecution on them so it
[46:06] is in our time there is going to be a
[46:09] pharaoh who do not know freedom of
[46:12] religion and they're going to put
[46:13] persecution on the True Church of God
[46:16] but remember as fair rameses was growing
[46:21] up Moses was there God dealing with
[46:24] Moses so he came to br a
[46:27] clash and that Clash Moses won God in
[46:32] Moses have the victory so is you and me
[46:37] when the time comes which is closer than
[46:40] closer when the Pharaoh is around and
[46:43] they take away that a freedom of worship
[46:47] God is going to raise a standard amen
[46:49] and he's going to do a quick work
[46:51] through us and very soon you're going to
[46:53] go home so do not scared of anything
[46:57] just worship God the best that you know
[46:59] because you are an eagle a son or
[47:02] daughter of the Living God and he
[47:05] promise he will never leave you nor
[47:07] forsake you he's with you even in you
[47:10] now because the said it goes wherever go
[47:14] um it the wind blow where it's listed
[47:17] and if you've been led by God then the
[47:20] devil cannot track your moment because
[47:21] one time you can't be going to the
[47:23] spirit of God will lead you and go to a
[47:25] different direction amen and to surprise
[47:27] because he can't detect you you can't
[47:29] know your movement because you being led
[47:32] by the spirit of God Amen and we are the
[47:34] children of the what the most high amen
[47:37] so I'm still basing my thought on the
[47:40] natural on the spiritual eye
[47:44] open remember someone like
[47:49] Samson when he became naturally
[47:54] blind when he was captured
[47:58] and he was blinded didn't see anywhere
[48:01] naturally he was blinded is that right
[48:03] but at that time his spiritual eyes got
[48:07] what open and he began to repent in his
[48:11] heart talk about it he began to cry to
[48:14] God and ask for forgiveness so is you
[48:18] and me if you've done anything wrong got
[48:20] to make it right because the Bible said
[48:23] that if your heart condemns you not then
[48:25] ask whatever you are but if your heart
[48:27] condemns how can you go to God and ask
[48:29] him anything so Samson make all things
[48:31] right even with his natural eye
[48:35] closed he made things right that that's
[48:38] why they ask um cross whatever that
[48:41] songs he said I don't want your millions
[48:44] of dollars they said that how can you
[48:46] know him with your ey blinded mind said
[48:49] I shall know him I shall know him by the
[48:52] footprint in his hand amen that
[48:54] inspiration C what cist him that even
[48:57] though he's blind he will still see him
[49:00] there naturally blind but the spiritual
[49:03] eyes was open so he have that confidence
[49:06] that even though his nice is blind
[49:08] naturally he shall also see God Amen so
[49:13] it's not the your natural eye that is
[49:16] important to be open but the most
[49:19] important that your open of your
[49:21] spiritual eyes amen because blessed are
[49:24] your eyes for they shall they
[49:27] see amen how God is Awesome Hallelujah
[49:32] he so good and so wonderful amen Samson
[49:36] his dying
[49:38] moment when he was blinded the Bible
[49:40] said that he killed
[49:43] more with the blinded eyes that when he
[49:46] has a natural eye because he made things
[49:48] right so you and me will have more
[49:53] Victory when you make things right with
[49:55] God we set your heart as our pastor is
[49:58] preaching set your heart guide your
[50:00] heart make sure everything is right and
[50:03] God in his own time whatever portion
[50:07] that he wants you to fulfill he going to
[50:09] make you fulfill it because remember
[50:12] unless God is finished with you no one
[50:15] can take you away nothing can take you
[50:18] away from this Earth
[50:21] job in this
[50:23] time the devil said God you put a hedge
[50:27] around him that's why I can't touch him
[50:31] is that right so as a son or daughter of
[50:33] God and God gave him permission because
[50:36] he knew what job was made up of Amen so
[50:40] all the trials that the devil triy him
[50:43] none of them because his heart was on
[50:44] Christ his the spiritual eyes was open
[50:47] and in the midst of his try when
[50:50] everything seemed blank and all hope was
[50:53] gone his friends those miserable
[50:55] comforters saying everything that they
[50:57] want to talk about him then his eyes got
[51:00] open and he said I know my redeemer
[51:02] liveth even in my flesh I shall worship
[51:06] Him amen that same God is here opening
[51:10] our spiritual understanding every day
[51:12] then hallelujah amen so the main thing
[51:15] is it's not it's good to have positions
[51:19] at your work or in the church or it's
[51:22] all good don't get me wrong but everyone
[51:25] of them will come to an end the most
[51:27] important position for you to know that
[51:29] you a son or daughter of God is
[51:32] important than anything else everything
[51:35] will pass away but that position will
[51:38] never pass away amen because the heaven
[51:41] and but his word shall never pass and
[51:43] you are part of that word amen so if you
[51:47] are part of that word you shall not pass
[51:49] away you can never perish like God going
[51:52] perish because you can't be perished you
[51:54] are part of him so that position in
[51:57] Christ is very important essential it's
[52:01] the most vital thing in life and what
[52:05] the devil is trying to do is that he
[52:08] comes and because you are here through
[52:11] Amnesia sometime you don't know who you
[52:14] are sometimes but God is constantly
[52:17] reminding us for you to recognize who
[52:20] you are when you fully recognize who you
[52:23] are that the devil cannot touch you
[52:25] anymore because can Shake him off amen
[52:28] because greater is he that's in you than
[52:30] he that's in the world recognizing who
[52:32] you are is the most important thing
[52:35] because it's your position not your
[52:38] condition your condition can change that
[52:40] inter your position never change amen so
[52:44] he's the god of the H Mountains and the
[52:47] god of what of the valley amen so when
[52:50] you are even down in the valley remember
[52:52] he's with you the same way you up in the
[52:55] high is of you down in the valley is
[52:57] still with you only thing you have to
[52:59] recognize is who you are if you
[53:03] recognize who you are fully in every
[53:06] circumstances you walk out with your
[53:08] chest out because know that all things
[53:11] not some things all things work together
[53:15] for good to them that love God so
[53:19] everything will work for your good it
[53:22] doesn't matter how bad it might sin it
[53:24] doesn't matter how the situation will
[53:26] look for it will work for your good so I
[53:30] encourage everyone tonight never give up
[53:33] everything work for your good it doesn't
[53:36] matter what our God is awesome God he's
[53:39] the same yesterday today and forever he
[53:42] will provide all your needs he will
[53:44] fight your battles he'll do everything
[53:46] for somewhere in Psalm
[53:49] 44 let me see Psalm 44 over here
[54:02] in Psalm 44 he said that verse two how
[54:06] did thou drive out the Heathen with thy
[54:09] hand and plant them how them how this
[54:13] ack the people and cast them out for
[54:16] they got not the land in possession by
[54:20] their own
[54:22] salord neither did their own arm save
[54:25] them but thy right hand and thy arm and
[54:31] the light of thy countenance because
[54:33] thou H has favor unto them
[54:37] amen for vers vers for I will not trust
[54:41] in my B neither shall my sword save me
[54:45] but thou H has saved us from our enemies
[54:49] and has put them to shame that he Us in
[54:51] other words it's not your B it's not
[54:54] your sword it's not your power
[54:57] said not by by power but by not by power
[55:00] but not by power or by might but by mind
[55:04] spirit says the Lord is the spirit of
[55:07] God that is doing not your own wisdom
[55:10] not your own H your own power or how
[55:14] powerful you are or how the knowledge
[55:16] you have on your job or anything but
[55:19] it's a arm of God the hand of God that
[55:22] is following you he is the one leading
[55:26] us
[55:26] he's the one guiding us he's the one
[55:28] giving us the
[55:30] inspiration you said that dream yourself
[55:33] a dream you can't dream yourself a dream
[55:35] how can you dream yourself a dream you
[55:37] you cannot even add a Str to your heart
[55:40] you can't do nothing he knows even the
[55:41] ha on your head even right now he knows
[55:44] every thought that is going through your
[55:47] heart he's a wonderful God so the more
[55:53] we relax and let go and let him have
[55:57] remnance the better it
[55:59] is because sometimes a human being want
[56:02] to take control you want to control
[56:05] things but you should just leave
[56:06] everything in his hand and he going to
[56:09] let everything happen in his own time
[56:12] and get things done the right time amen
[56:15] because he the same yesterday today and
[56:18] forever our God is
[56:21] good he's also of God he doesn't change
[56:25] he hasn't change and you will never
[56:27] change he's the same yesterday today and
[56:31] forever amen praise God
[56:35] hallelujah hallelujah and one other
[56:38] thing our spiritual
[56:41] eyes can only be opened by what faith
[56:46] and faith is a
[56:48] revelation only by the word of God bro
[56:51] so faith is a revelation
[56:54] without God open your spiritual High you
[56:57] cannot do
[56:59] anything like Jo Joshua and
[57:04] Caleb they went with the 10 other
[57:07] spies naturally their eyes saw the the
[57:12] enemies were
[57:14] giants with all the 10
[57:17] spies but their spiritual eye were so
[57:21] enlightening that they didn't see how
[57:24] tall those Giants are there spiritual
[57:27] eye went to the promise of God and that
[57:29] promise said I've given you the land
[57:32] everywhere your foood stop is given to
[57:34] you so they didn't care how high the
[57:37] giant those enemies are their confidence
[57:40] was in the word of God and that gave
[57:43] them the victory that let them stood out
[57:45] of the 12 out of the two out of the 10
[57:48] and have and now they were the only one
[57:50] that was saved in the time of Moses
[57:52] because why they didn't look at the
[57:54] things with their natural eye they cut
[57:57] it through their spiritual eye and that
[58:01] what gave them the
[58:03] confidence that those people who be C
[58:06] for person we are able more than able to
[58:09] conquer them why because they believe in
[58:11] the word of God and faith is based on
[58:14] the word of God your base has to have
[58:17] foundationu and that Foundation should
[58:19] be on the word of God anything contrary

[58:28] if that does not line up with the word
[58:30] of the Lord of God for today run for
[58:33] your
[58:34] life that faith has to have a
[58:37] foundation and that Foundation is in the
[58:39] word of God that's why Joshua and Caleb
[58:43] could come out what Victorious that's
[58:46] why there were only two who could stand
[58:49] in the midst of 2 million people and you
[58:52] are one in a million out of billion 6

[1:01:49] lions that he were going to put him in
[1:01:51] his spiritual eyes were so open to such
[1:01:54] an extent that he went there freely the
[1:01:57] Lion's then and God shut the lion's
[1:02:00] mouth the Hebrew children their
[1:02:03] spiritual eyes were open and they said I
[1:02:06] like that when I first got the Bible I
[1:02:08] was so blessed he said that we
[1:02:11] know our God is able to deliver us but
[1:02:16] even if you chose not to we are not
[1:02:18] going to bow down to that ad amen that's
[1:02:22] what that spiritual did to them they

[1:03:14] understanding he has opened up at last
[1:03:16] amen um can you please uh Grace put this
[1:03:20] quotation for me Third
[1:03:22] Exodus paragraph 242
[1:03:27] yeah I I think I um I paraphrase but I
[1:03:31] want to read it too he said well if
[1:03:34] Joshua and Caleb could call those
[1:03:39] amalekites and heiti and jebusite as
[1:03:43] though they wasn't there yet twice or
[1:03:46] three or four times their size and the
[1:03:49] natural mind at kisia when the spice
[1:03:52] went over ah we can't do it
[1:03:56] they are too much well we are like
[1:04:00] grasshoppers side of
[1:04:02] them but Caleb and Joshua seen God's
[1:04:05] promise said we are more than able to do
[1:04:09] it why they are they were looking God
[1:04:13] said I give you the land see the Canan
[1:04:18] might don't get it the spiritual mind
[1:04:22] fix it up and why want to ask ask you
[1:04:26] something why didn't Egyptians see these
[1:04:28] things because they were not
[1:04:31] elected God told Abraham before it
[1:04:35] happened get it you sleeping
[1:04:38] church God told abam your seed will so
[1:04:41] in Egypt for what 400 years and I'll
[1:04:44] bring them out that's the reason they
[1:04:47] seen it because they were elected to see
[1:04:51] it they are the election Israel was
[1:04:54] elected to see the the sign of God and
[1:04:57] they went out of Egypt where the
[1:05:00] unbelievers perished and today God is
[1:05:03] calling his elected the spiritual Seed
[1:05:06] of Abraham by faith that he had in the
[1:05:11] word of God don't you see the spiritual
[1:05:14] seed today congregation says amen that
[1:05:18] don't see the intellectual Church it
[1:05:20] sees the word and it's been called from
[1:05:23] those big denominations and in the
[1:05:25] presence of Jesus Christ amen was that
[1:05:27] clear did you get it all right we go
[1:05:31] further they elected only Dr DL P they
[1:05:35] never see it they wasn't elected so it's
[1:05:39] based on Election thank you amen and we
[1:05:44] are the elected seed of God and because
[1:05:49] we have that electing of God our
[1:05:52] spiritual eyes are what open th I
[1:05:56] believe that when Paul when his
[1:05:59] spiritual eyes were open he saw that
[1:06:02] Pillar of
[1:06:03] Fire but some said the people of that
[1:06:07] didn't see it but he saw it because it
[1:06:10] was for him amen that same God is here
[1:06:15] he has opened our eyes of understanding
[1:06:19] so he's the same yesterday today and
[1:06:23] forever and in conclusion
[1:06:26] just going to wind up over here um Peter
[1:06:31] and the rest of the
[1:06:33] Apostles they when they went for that
[1:06:37] fishing the Bible said that they toil
[1:06:40] all night nothing was happening but when
[1:06:43] the Lord Jesus Christ told because their
[1:06:45] natural eyes they know that they have
[1:06:48] done this they've done everything that
[1:06:51] they have to do but they not when they
[1:06:53] did that when they the Lord met them and
[1:06:57] said cast your net on this side even
[1:07:01] though they could have said that you
[1:07:02] have done all night we're not going to
[1:07:04] do it but I believe that the their
[1:07:06] spiritual eye got kicking and they said
[1:07:09] that you have to all night but at the
[1:07:12] word PR do it so I'm trying to say to
[1:07:16] that it doesn't matter what you've done
[1:07:19] God's word believe it and it will what
[1:07:22] come to pass and when they obey it they
[1:07:25] got more than they have done for the
[1:07:28] whole the whole night and he said I'm
[1:07:30] even ashamed and he cried unto God and
[1:07:33] that same God is here tonight he's able
[1:07:36] to give you all your needs no Mary also
[1:07:39] said the same thing when she said that
[1:07:43] at Thy
[1:07:44] word Lord if you were to be here she
[1:07:48] would not have died but at TH word said
[1:07:51] believeth thou they said as th word and
[1:07:54] his her brother came back he raised she
[1:07:57] raised his her brother back why her
[1:08:00] spiritual eye got open amen so the
[1:08:04] opening of the spiritual eye it make
[1:08:07] things impossible become possible there
[1:08:10] was a story that braam talk about um a
[1:08:15] young man who was sick at the hospital I
[1:08:17] think everyone has heard it before and
[1:08:21] then he was going to visit that hospital
[1:08:25] and they said they won't let him go
[1:08:26] because he has a children he said if the
[1:08:28] Catholic priest came to come they would
[1:08:31] allow him to go and they allow him to go
[1:08:34] and then pray for the person but the
[1:08:36] nurse told the parents of the children
[1:08:39] that we haven't seen this case anyone
[1:08:42] ever come back to life so the chart
[1:08:45] shows that your son is going to die but
[1:08:49] the man responded and said that all that
[1:08:51] you can see is the chat but I'm looking
[1:08:54] at the promise of God
[1:08:56] amen and when he believed that his
[1:08:58] spiritual eye got open he believed the
[1:09:01] word of God his eyes his stand God
[1:09:04] healed the prophet prayed for him he got
[1:09:06] healed and the next time said became a
[1:09:08] missionary and married with three
[1:09:10] children why the that spiritual eyes pop
[1:09:14] open amen so God opened his spiritual
[1:09:17] eyes and he
[1:09:19] believed things that was not possible in
[1:09:22] the eyes of the doctors and the nurses
[1:09:24] and that same God is here tonight has
[1:09:27] open your eyes for you it is given to
[1:09:31] know the kingdom of God Bron you can you
[1:09:33] please come but to them it is not given
[1:09:37] so you are blessed and he hold the key
[1:09:39] of
[1:09:40] David when he open no one can shout and
[1:09:44] when he shut no one can open but that
[1:09:47] key he's given to is what the key of
[1:09:50] Faith it's a revelation it opened all
[1:09:53] doors
