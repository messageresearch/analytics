certainly uh see that the weather kind of turned today and we're feeling that um that little chill in the air praise God but um I hear that we're expecting um to have not so uh bad a winter by God's grace they're saying that we're um experiencing somewhat of an El Nino and uh ELO thank you and uh they're saying that southern Ontario will not be experiencing so much of a winter as they would normally so it's going to be a little bit on the milder side a little less snow significantly less that's good how many is okay with that praise God Amen unless you're young and vibrant you like to ski well then um you'll have to go and uh maybe visit Quebec and Mont trbl there there's some good skiing there praise God so tonight we're GNA just continue um with the uh series that we've been ministering on and tonight we're going to read from 2 Corinthians Chapter 13 Verse 5 2 Corinthians chapter 13 and verse 5 they could bring that up amen it says examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith prove your own selves know ye not your know ye not your own selves how that Jesus Christ is in you except ye be reprobates let us pray father we're so grateful tonight Lord that we can have this opportunity it's a Wednesday night Lord and it's an opportunity to study your word and to look into the aspects of your word and Lord we're just asking that your spirit and your anointing will come and uh take control of the service Lord anoint us to speak your thoughts and your desire and your needs for your people and anoint the people to receive it Lord because a word spoken not received or believed will not have any effect for you said that all things are possible to them that believe Grant it we pray tonight remember our pastor that's uh traveling into Africa the brothers Desmond coffee sister Desiree Lord I pray your protection and your leadership and your guidance will be over them and watching over them and providing all of their needs Lord as they enter into that uh Ministry there in Africa over these next couple of weeks take control father we love you and we appreciate you father in Jesus name amen praise God tonight we're going to look at examining ourselves self-examination in the mirror of God's word amen we've been looking at uh you may be seated we've been looking at um you know seeing yourself in the word of God and how important it is to recognize that God has uh placed you in the word that you have a position and a placing in the word of God there's a reason why you've been called uh to this day and to this this hour thank you brother there's a reason and a purpose in um you recognizing the word for your day the identity um the the the very fact that you've recognized your identity in the word of God shows that you've recognized the re the word of God for your day amen that's the that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost remember people are looking for the evidence of the Holy Ghost in so many different ways sence and wonders and and and miracles but the evidence of the holy spirit is when you can recognize what God is doing in your day apply that word in your life and live it you become the living manifestation of the word of God for your day and you become the word made flesh in this day and in this hourl praise God it's it you know uh when we talk about Christianity and we we look back at all of our experiences um growing up you know in our religious Realms you know some of us brought up Catholic Presbyterian Baptist Pentecostal whatever all of our experiences and all of our um ways of looking at the word and looking at God was based on what we were taught the Traditions that we were um exposed to uh you know going to church and certain um uh you know if you were brought up in a Catholic Church well then you were taught that you had to go through certain sacraments and you know your first communion first of all you're baptized as a baby which is not scriptural then your your first communion which is not scriptural if there is a First Communion it's the first time that the Holy Spirit reveals himself to you amen and you come into a literal Supernatural communion with God personally amen that's that's a true communion but you see we get taught all these different sacraments and different teachings and and and we we we look at the word and the whole you know the whole world um of religion around us is is what influences us and gives us certain interpretations on the word of God and we come to realize that when you do receive the new birth and you are awakened to the word of God it was not even close to what you thought or what you were taught that's the incredible aspect of being awakened in this day and in this hour to recognize who you are amen and so tonight we just want to look at self-examination looking into the mirror you know a lot of times you look into the mirror and you might see some flaws you know you're looking there and you you see you know especially if you're a woman you're constantly looking in the mirror to make sure that your hair is perfect that your you know that that your your your eyebrows are perfectly done and you know like all the things that you know you you you realize that you know that you're relying so much on you on on your own Beauty but when you look into God's word God's looking at the beauty in you in your character he's looking to see how your your your um attitude is um when you look into the mirror of God's word he's looking to see uh what your attitude towards his word and what his word requires for you in this day and in this hour amen and so many of us you know we go for yearly checkups you know we'll go to the dermatologist to know the importance of you know what this scar is over here or what this Mark is over here it's self-examination and the doctor may see a spot and tell you to keep an eye on it he may tell you that it that it's Chang that if it changes color it becomes more irregular then that could be a problem you see and everything that we look at in perspective of the doctor's report it's all carnal it's all physical it's all you know the outward God looks at you and says examine yourself to to see if you're in the faith to see if you're walking right to see if you've caught what God wants to do in your life and what he's requiring of you and what he's looking for you to do in in in positioning yourself in the word of God so self-examination is important when it's when it's in in the service of the Lord a lot of times we get our own ideas and our own interpretations on things and you know we want to do things our way we have like you know a way of of um doing things because you know that's just the way I am and this is the way I do it and so this is the way I want to do it but yet when God tells you to examine yourself he's saying examine yourself according to the word don't let your interpretation of how you are supposed to live lead you and guide you but let the word of God lead you and guide you in the way that you should live amen praise God and so self-examination can be a life or death experience you know we go to the doctor for a physical every year and we want to know you know that uh there's no growth you know on our bodies there's nothing wrong in our in our bloodstream we got to get our blood tests and we we we get all those things checked because we're worried that you know that we could get something and die well God's telling you to examine your faith examine yourself because you could be walking in such a way that it's not going to produce life but it's going to produce death we need to examine our thoughts we need to examine the way we think about everything around us amen praise God Scripture repeatedly calls us to examine ourselves and we see that in our text in verse 5 when the Apostle writes examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith test yourself amen or do or or or uh do you not realize this about yourself that Jesus Christ is in you this is the greatest revelation of this day to know that Jesus Christ is in you that he's the one that wants to fulfill his word in you this is not your work this is the hour where you recognize the word and you come under obedience to the word and the word takes control in your life it starts to examine all of your your your previous understandings your upbringings your environments and it starts to purge and clean it's the attribute coming into its fullness it's it's Christ coming into his fullness Christ wants to live and manifest through your life so that he can take out all the things that you don't need anymore you know one of the things about the Rapture is that there's there's there's there's a lot of things you're not going to take with you amen amen praise God there's nothing here that's going to go in the Rapture other than you and your character you and your ability to recognize the word of God and to live the word of God and to manifest the word of God before the people amen praise God this is the hour where the body of Jesus Christ is coming together in the unity of the faith like we were talking about on Sunday it's all about you recognizing that you are a part of the body and that you are important to the body Christ wants you to recognize that he's in you in love he's in you that's why you know you you read the scripture and it talks about um until we all come into the fullness of Christ the fullness of Jesus Christ and when you look at that word fullness it's actually the Perfection and the maturity Perfection is maturity is to become mature in Christ and to recognize that you are a part of the body that that God needs to use God wants to make sure that you know that he wants you to examine yourself to know that it requires that you come into into contact with your higher self the the the the the one who you really are in Christ the attribute of God Amen praise God that attribute is what God has called in this hour he hasn't called your flesh every time we come into the house of the Lord and we assemble ourselves and we feed on the word of God that's where we come to we we we come to realize more Who We Are God's telling us and lifting the spiritual Amnesia on our lives that's why the most important part of coming into the house of the Lord is getting into the service and receiving the word you can't you you don't come to church listen we we have offices we have positions we have things that we have to do that are important around the house of the Lord but yet there's one purpose that we come into the house of the Lord every Sunday and Wednesday and that is to feed on the word by the supernatural element of the preaching of the word of God Amen when we come with that expectation and we come into the house of God for that reason then we are in the house of the Lord we're in the service the moment that the service starts we're in the sanctuary feeding on the word participating because we we are a very important part in the word household of God you're an important part and when you are in here and you're saying amen praise God hallelujah that's the amen the Deep calling to the deep and the Deep responding it's it's Christ perfecting and molding and shaping and and edifying each and every part that's in the word of God it's where listen judgment starts in the house of the Lord so it's where we examine ourselves where we we we check our attitudes we check our motives we check our desires amen praise God God wants us to examine ourselves we are an important part of the word of God and he wants us to come into the unity of the faith self-examination it's not an easy process in the process of self-examination we find many hindrances everybody's got hindrances everybody's got the you know their own ways of seeing things and sometimes the way we see things is a hindrance because we're not looking through the word we're looking through our own own ideas we're looking at things through our own eyes we're seeing things too naturally and we're not seeing enough spiritually Hallelujah often when we examine ourselves we come up with questions and in the self-examination process we sometimes begin to wonder whether we are even truly saved everybody experiences that every everybody goes through those those moments in their lives where they get you know where where where you know you start to look at everything in your life you start to all of a sudden you look at this situation and you see that it's completely not going the way that you want it to go you see this child and you think my God I raised this child in the way of the Lord and it's going completely in the other direction then you look at this job and you know you thought that it was going to be your career and you can't stand going to work it's all kinds of of things that that that that we find ourselves being hindered by because of our attitude and our priorities the priority is the word for your day your priority is not to be watching CNN 2 47 to see what's going on in Israel and get all caught up in all of that even though it is a terrible thing that's going on there the lives that are being taken the circumstances around it all it's terrible Saints it's absolutely um heartbreaking to see the the scenes of of families that are being destroyed children that are being killed families that are being broken and destroyed it's a terrible thing but we also need to recognize ize that this is also prophecy that's being fulfilled and if we look back into the scriptures we can read and look back into history and look at the wars that took place and everything that happened here on the earth if we look back at all those things we will see that there was a lot of Heartache a lot of Destruction it's all part of the prophecy that stands behind salvation and that's why sometimes times if we get caught up into those things and we get so down and and and discouraged we start to you know wonder why am I feeling so bad why am I you know have I really been saved because if I've been saved I'm supposed to have the joy of the Lord why is it that you know it's because you're allowing the hindrances of your carnal mind and your attitude toward 's situations and circumstances to get in the way of who you really are as an attribute of God you should be the happiest people on Earth because you know who you are according to the word of God and Christianity is all based on salvation what do you mean salvation Salvation from what is going on in the world everything that's happening all the the the conditions of the world the the weather circumstances the tsunamis that are hitting other places the the the the moral corruption in in in look at in politics you know there the the Democrats in the US are are winning in certain ways because they're pushing abortion they they want people to be able to you know have abortions they you know you should if you have a child you you shouldn't you should be able to decide whether you want to have a child or not if they were anywhere near the word of God in Christianity they would know that marriage is is something that's sacred and something that should be instituted before you enter into sexual activity where you start to produce children you see if if you put things in their proper perspective and we realize that we've come into a world now where sexual um conduct it's becoming like like it's it's normal for the young people now you know like before they you know you talk to some young people and you you read about certain things and and it's like are you kidding I would never get married to that person if I didn't know how they were sexually that's what it's come to it's come to where if the you know if the if the if if the sexuality isn't right then the mate is probably not right and what happens is they start going through one Experience One relationship after the other and they get used and abused and before you know it they don't even know what true love and affection and bringing children into the world and the purpose of it and that it's all part of a God's blessing when he gives you children when you do things in the right way but the world has gone into such immorality and the laws around it are supporting this ridiculous conduct that we find our young people caught into he she they they can be you know uh all kinds of different different identities not knowing that is a form of insanity yes when you don't know who you are and you can't recognize whether you are male or female there's something that has taken place in the mind that they need to be healed they need they need real Supernatural healing to be brought back to their to the foundations of who they actually are but what the word of God does is it tells you who you are it tells you that you are not of this world you are temporarily in this world you're in a in a in a human body but that's not who you really are who you really are as a son or a daughter of God is a spirit Soul attribute of God that came from God and is going back to God this Dimension that we're living in is a Time Dimension it's only for a period of time people get so caught up they think that all there is because they don't have a revelation of God they don't know that there is true salvation true salvation is to know that you are going to something a billion times better than this and it'll have no end to it because you are Eternal having no beginning and no end and so when you've got that revelation of Salvation your life and your perspective on life and the way that you see life should be a lot different than the way this world wants to mold and shape you and what it wants to turn you into aren't you glad that you've been awakened to know who you really are and that this life is only only temporary praise God forever more Hallelujah I thank God for that I thank God of the Revelation on salvation it's something that that just never you know stops amazing me because when you get caught into those days where you're not feeling good and you're feeling a little frustrated and you know things are just not going right and you know and it's not something that that because we have like you know um because we have mental health issues that we can't handle life everybody has mental health issues everybody has issues that they're trying to deal with circumstances that they're trying to overcome it's all a part of overcoming this life that's why we're to put on the mind of Christ amen that's why we're to think on on the right things we're to read the word of God feed on the word of God every single day get into the house of the Lord and let the word of God pour into you through the supernatural element of preaching faith comes by hearing the word of God a lot of people you know they don't realize that that that correction starts in the house of the Lord how does it start in the house of the Lord because the word comes and corrects the word comes and and and speaks to your situation and when it speaks to your situation it's because it's delivering you from that situation when you come in here and you've been dealing with a certain you know maybe a relationship issue and then the the minister gets up there and he starts speaking on and he starts to you know uh you know discern the whole situation you're wondering man how does he know all of that he doesn't know all that it's God that knows all about it it's God that wants to set you free and when God speaks to you when you come into the house of the Lord and he starts speaking directly to that circumstance or that situation it's because he wants to deliver you from it you that's why when when when you should you should be like like rejoicing when God discerns that situation in your life and it could be something that you know is is sin it's total unbelief you know you shouldn't be doing it it's iniquity and you realize that it is but then the Holy Spirit starts to speak to you you know that's God's mercy to you you know that's God not speaking to your situation and saying you don't need to remain that way anymore I release you from that situation right now but then sometimes when the minister starts to speak and starts to discern the situations and you don't have the right attitude and the right Spirit you start to Rebel you think oh he knows about my situation and he's just using the pulpit to deal with my situation God help any Minister that'll do that amen praise God the minister does not look into personal situations and lives he is led by the spirit and when the Holy Spirit brings that to his mind and starts to minister to those situations and starts to zoom in and and and and hone in on your situation if you say Amen praise God Lord help me I receive it you will be delivered but if you say no I'm not accepting that and you get an attitude towards it guess what things get worse because the enemy says I can stay because they want me to stay they're holding on to a rebellious spirit that rebellious spirit is me that's what listen anything that is against God anything that is Antichrist anti- word is anti- spirit it's Satan in some form it's a demon in some form it's as simple as that if you got a smoking Spirit on your life that's a demon and God wants that demon to loose your life but when God comes and exposes it and you turn around and you go right back out there and you continue to smoke guess what you're going to get worse because you're allowing that Spirit to have his way and stay you see these are simple things you know sometimes we don't realize now I'm using those examples of smoking but you could have a rebellious Spirit on you and a rebellious spirit is something that just disagrees when it gets corrected just disagrees instead of you know just sitting back and allowing the Holy Spirit based now correction must come in the right form and in the right way God has his offices his positions he's got deacons he's got trustees he's got all the offices that's what we were talking about God gave to the church all these offices and positions for the edification of the church for the uniting of the church for the equipping of the church and so these offices are anointed of God to do certain things to correct certain spirits to to set free certain individuals that's why we always tell you if there's a situation that you're dealing with that you are finding yourself frustrated in any way shape or form see your Deacon talk to your Deacon because that Deacon he may not have the answers but the holy spirit will honor your obedience to the word of God and somehow someway God will anoint that Deacon to either get together with other deacons get together with the pastor and talk about the situation and allow the wisdom of the Holy Spirit to come in so that it can be dealt with exactly the way God wants to deal with it am and when God deals with it he does it in such a way that it unites it doesn't separate it will unite because remember this is the mystical body of Jesus Christ this Ephesians church and the Ephesians church and what God has given to the Ephesians church is for the perfecting the equipping the edifying the uniting the bringing into the fullness of maturity into the one full body of Jesus Christ in female form this is where Jesus Christ this hour it's Christ again on the earth a lot of people are are failing to recognize that remember he's already come a lot of them are going to be looking for him in the cloud he already came in the cloud he came in 1963 in the cloud but the world missed it but not everybody missed it not those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life they recognized the word but he came for a purpose he came the head that's why the cloud when you turn it it it was the shape of the head of Christ it was coming to the body it was coming to unite with Eve with the female attribute with the with the female aspect of Jesus Christ remember Adam and eve were both they were one they were one Eve was just as much Jesus Christ as Adam was it's just that Eve had to fulfill a certain aspect of the Plan of Redemption something had to fall in order for something to be redeemed and so Eve is Jesus Christ in the female aspect and Eve is now being restored back to her fullness again the church the body of Christ amen she and he are the same person in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and if you are the word made flesh in your day then you are God manifesting the female aspect of Jesus Christ which is always been known as the bride and the bride in the church is known as a woman and the woman is known as the church and so all of the ingredients that are required every single attribute of God is coming into its place and its position in the body of Christ and God is going to perfect you God is going to mold you and shape you so that you fit just perfectly fine into the word of God Amen praise God hallelujah so so we come to a place where we recognize that you know hindrances hindrances hinder us constantly and you know we we need to uh allow ourselves to be examined constantly by the word of God by coming into the house of the Lord you know Satan constantly attacks our thoughts he attacks every single one of us and as that Temptation repeatedly comes into our thoughts reoccurring time because that's that's how he gets you Satan will come and continually put that negative thought into your mind constantly constantly bombard you with with with thoughts against your boss or or or thoughts uh you know about immorality you know as young men and young women there's a constant bombardment in the mind constantly about immoral acts because they're constantly taking place around us to the point where it's becoming commonplace and we are constantly being bombarded and if we don't block our thoughts and replace them with the word of God we find ourselves becoming creatures of habit before you know it you know because you're constantly seeing you know you young men you know you're you're constantly looking at Billboards and the women are constantly half-dressed and before you know it you're looking you're looking you're looking then all of a sudden you're browsing the internet and then all of a sudden boom you know especially if you're if you're you got to watch those those Instagrams and and all those different um apps that that that they're constantly I see them flipping all the time because once in a while there's there's there's there's pornography boom just right hits you right in the face and if you're not careful you're going to get caught by that and you're going to take that second look and then you're going to look for more because the enemy uses your mind he's bombarding your mind to try and get you to you know to to leave the word of God to to uh you know disbelieve God's word amen but when we replace those things with the word of God instead of going and flipping through Instagram and all those things day all day long flip through the word of God Amen and read about the things that are pure and the things that are true and the things that are just and the things that are going to strengthen you and and perfect you so that you can take your position in the word of God and be a strong soldier in Christ it's not easy especially in this hour to overcome that power of social media that is constantly bombarding our minds but I'm telling you that if your heart and your desires are for the word of God God will raise a standard around you you come into the house of the Lord for the purpose that you want you want to be strengthened by the word of God the word will strengthen you you will find yourself stronger you'll go out you ever notice I'll tell you I challenge you read the word every single day get something out of the word and you will find yourself wanting to read more listen to the tapes you listen to them and you know and you do it in a way where you steady your mind you sit long enough it's like I said on Sunday you know like the Holy Spirit was saying that people will not sit long enough to listen to the word and and actually uh you know search the scriptures to see if they are actually mirroring the word of God when it comes to Salvation you can look into the book of Acts and you can see baptism in the name of Jesus Christ it's very clear right there in the scripture in Acts 238 repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit and it's right there it's clear you don't have to read the whole Bible that's where you know you could start right there because it's clearly says that you need to repent and you need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is the attribute is the word of God in you awakened to recognize truth and if you stay there long enough and you do those simple things you will find yourself motivated you'll find yourself strengthened you'll find yourself wanting to get to the to the baptismal tank but when somebody tells you and you just don't want to search and you don't want to take the time to stay there and allow the word to permeate you and and fill you and give you the strength that you need in order to get to that tank you're going to get pulled right back into the world that's where you must overcome the Bible says to them that overcome some people think I don't have to do nothing everything is taken care of Jesus said he's the author and the finisher of my faith so I don't need to do nothing I can just go and do what I want every single day that's not the way it works no sir you need to overcome the devil is there the enemy is right there when you get up in the morning you put your foot on the floor he's already at the punch clock and he's clocking in and he says all right let's deal with this one today let's see how much they can overcome and by the end of the day if you haven't got the devil frustrated and upset and and to the point where he just leaves because the scripture says resist him and he will flee resist him and he will flee so when the enemy comes to you and says say to you hey Daniel you know we're going to a bar tonight you know you want to come and check out you know the the the band you know they got a live band there it's supposed to be really good you don't have to turn around and say that's Satan no way I ain't going there no he just say no thanks I'm good that's it that's resisting the devil it's as simple as that no thank you you go have a good time I'm going home actually I got church tonight it's Wednesday I get a lot of people that call me and say Danny you want to come here you want to do that you said on a Wednesday night you know we got a meeting this that I said no that's Wednesday night and now they don't even call me anymore they know Wednesday Danny's going to church Sunday Danny's going a church it's as simple as that because I know I get strength here I know this is where I get fed I know this is where I I I I fellowship with my brothers and sisters in the spirit in Heavenly places when we are in here and the word is coming and speaking to our situations and speaking to our needs and we're together and we're and we're saying Amen brother amen sister hallelujah praise God and you hear that sister saying amen glory to God and you know you've been praying for that sister amen the brother says and you know you've been praying for that brother and the Holy Spirit now comes and speaks directly to that situation because you know that you you you you were you were standing in the gap for them you were believing that God would give them what they had need of and you and you were trusting that the Holy Spirit would know about it and that he would take the minister and use the minister to speak to that situation so that that individual could be set free and then you witness it you see it don't you see how you get edified how you get strengthened because you know you were praying and then you see that person and then you see them get delivered you see this is how the body of Christ operates one you know sometimes you don't see certain individuals but they're praying here and they're coming into the house of the Lord on certain nights of the week when you don't know about it I know about it I happen to be in a position where I know when anybody comes into this church because I'm the head Deacon and I and I keep an eye on the premises anybody opens that door enters a code I know about it within 30 seconds and so God has it that way because this is our house and we and we need to protect it and God has his proper positions and offices in their places to protect and those individuals when they're coming into the house of the Lord and they're getting on their knees for an hour praying for the services on Wednesdays on Sundays or coming early into the house of the Lord on Wednesday nights to pray those hidden parts are very important parts that we need to recognize and be thankful for because it it's what makes these Services effective and Powerful for each and every one of us it's not the only element but it's an important element one is fasting the other one is praying sometimes you feel led sometimes to just fast well it's because maybe God has another person in the body that's praying and praying and praying and you're fasting and they're praying and it's and it's edifying and it's strengthening and it's adding the the the the the energy that we need within the church in order for the church to function and be effective and Powerful and have you become effective and Powerful in your own daily lives you are walking with Christ Christ is walking in you he says I'll be with you even in You Until the End of the Age praise God Amen Hallelujah so the evil one is always looking for an opportune time to tempt you he's looking for temptation to place Temptation in front of you over and over and over again for what purpose to distract you from the word of God to distract you from your true position as a son or a daughter of God you're needed in this local assembly I want you to know that each and every one of you you are an important part and you are needed in the body of Jesus Christ and God wants to mold you and shape you and and and deep deal with the with the natural hindrances in your life but in order for us to truly overcome we need to examine ourselves we need to take a look and examine where we're putting all of our time you know there's times of rest there's times of vacation there's times to work there's there's a time for everything the Bible says a time for all things and God makes everything beautiful in its time and so we need to recognize that God requires us to search our time examine our time and examine where we're putting most of our efforts amen praise God [Music] hallelujah amen in Psalms 19 David prayerfully asked who can discern his errors declare me innocent from hidden faults keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins let them not have dominion over me then I shall be blameless and innocent of great transgression Psalms 19: 12 and 13 you know David had a revelation that he needed God on a daily basis to help him to overcome the circumstances that he had to deal with in his life because the Paradox like we were saying on Sunday is that you're a human you're weak you get tired you get angry you get miserable you get frustrated and yet you are a son of God and before God you you can't even sin you're an attribute of God the Bible says a Son of God cannot even sin which means disbelieve the word and that's the battle that we constantly fight between those two Realms of natural man and human man and and the elements of of you know and that's why it's important to get your rest it's important to get proper rest people don't realize that as a human being we need rest we need to be able to take our rest and and and and feed our bodies in the proper way so that we can be effective and be you know in in the right mood when we come into the house of the Lord a lot of the people that don't get into the house of God is because they're not properly timing their their their days and their weeks to prepare to get into the house of the Lord you know that you need to prepare if on Wednesdays you know that you know Wednesday you you're you're you you want to be in the house of God and I believe that every single one of us should try to be in the house of the Lord every time there's a service I believe that with all of my heart I believe that from the very beginning there are times when we can't be here because of work because of shifts that's completely understandable but other than that we should be timing and and and using our time properly if you need to get a rest on Wednesday during the you know maybe you know as soon as you get home you don't eat as much maybe A light meal and lay down for half an hour 20 minutes to half an hour do you know that a 20 minute nap can recharge you for the whole night I had a 20 minute nap before I came to to the service tonight and it helps it refreshes you and you just you just you know and and when you do it with the intention that you want to be a aware and awake and you want to receive everything that God has for you God anoints you to be awake God anoints you to receive what you need you come to church on Wednesday nights and on Sundays because you want something from the Lord I hope you I I hope you're you're you're you know if if you're not having that kind of attitude that's why preaching Faith cometh by hearing and by hearing of the word of God and sometimes we need to be reminded of these things of why we come into the house of the Lord we don't come here to do all the other duties and all the other positions that we have to do unless you're coming early to do it like we have Sunday school the Sunday School teachers come early they do their thing then they then there's some that come to the to the platform because they're part of the worship team they do their thing they realize that you know that they've got other duties after the services they do those things but the prime the the the the primary goal is to get into the worship so that you can receive and get into Heavenly places where Christ is going to speak to you and speak to your needs and speak to your circumstances so that you leave here better than when you came in you leave here strengthened by the word of God you've got another line upon line another precept upon precept something that's going to give you the strength to get to work on Monday morning and and do more and be more and be a testimony for Jesus Christ this is the hour where listen it you know we're Leo deia is blending okay we that have recognized the word for our day we realize that we've we've we've we've actually transitioned out of Le oysa but the effects of Leo deia are on here and they're lazy they're their lazy Spirits constantly wanting to be stimulated by TV and constantly wanting to be stimulated by the things of the world instead of getting stimulation from the revelation of God's word amen but nothing is more powerful nothing is is going to give you more strength than when you feed on the word of God and you receive what it is that you have need of Amen Let The Musicians come praise God hallelujah you know when we think about presumptuous sin you know David just got trapped made mistakes and we all make mistakes every single one of us as long as you're still in this human realm here you are going to make mistakes know that but the blood of Jesus Christ that you accepted when you received the power of the spirit of God when you repented and when you were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus you received his Spirit he gave you that spirit so that he could keep you his Spirit not only speaks to you feeds you it keeps you it's there you know there's there's so much that we could look at and we're going to be looking at a lot more about what God is going to do and how he's going to do it in our lives and how he's using each and every one of us Amen to fulfill our part in the word of God but just know this if you make a mistake get up repent and move on God will not remember it if you have truly repented he places it under the blood in the sea of his forgetfulness and only you only you can bring it up and allow the devil to use it against you because the devil uses your memory oh you did it don't tell me you didn't do it yeah you might have repented and you might have I seen some tears coming out of your eyes but you still did it and if you're not if you're not feeding on the word and reading the word where God is telling you that I don't remember your sins no more when you read about David and David cries out and says the mercy of the Lord endureth forever Mercy is when when mercy comes into your life it's because you deserve to be punished you deserved to get whipped you deserved to to uh to lose certain things you make mistakes on investments and and you did it because you you you you were just doing it out of the wrong motives and you you were doing it in the form of gambling instead of actually doing it as an investment and doing your proper research and looking into it and then you lost your money and then you and then you know you get all upset you got to realize that those things will happen but when you truly repent and God shows you and you come back to God's provided way it never happened in the first place and you can start fresh and have a brand new day amen praise God God bless you Saints I trust those few words will encourage you to keep pressing on praise God I'm going to leave this right here because we're going to definitely need it and I like it I like it warm I'll put it in the office actually thank you brother Bill God bless you brother his strength is perfect all [Music]
