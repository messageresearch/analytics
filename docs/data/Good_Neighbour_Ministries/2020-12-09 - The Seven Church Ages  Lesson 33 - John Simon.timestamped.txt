[1:18] planted
[1:20] may god to god be the glory
[1:23] as we read our scriptures for today
[1:27] and begin upon this
[1:30] part of our teaching our scripture is
[1:34] found in the book of revelation
[1:37] chapter 2 and verse
[1:41] 9 i know thy works
[1:47] and tribulation
[1:50] and poverty
[1:53] but the word rich and i
[1:57] know the blasphemy of them
[2:00] which say they are jews
[2:04] and are not but are
[2:07] of the synagogue of
[2:10] satan this is our topic for today
[2:16] synagogues of satan
[2:19] let us pray our gracious
[2:23] god our most
[2:26] righteous heavenly father
[2:29] rained down upon us the blessings
[2:33] of the great holy spirit
[2:36] send to us angels
[2:40] food manna from on high
[2:44] break the shoe bread before us lord
[2:47] and show us the word reveal to us the
[2:52] things we
[2:52] need to know the strategies of
[2:56] satan his activities lord
[3:00] that we may be able to avoid or
[3:03] protect ourselves in these
[3:06] perilous and dangerous times
[3:11] to thee be all the glory and the praise
[3:13] as you infuse us
[3:15] with your spirit that we may
[3:18] speak as man of god
[3:23] anointed for your glory and honor
[3:26] we ask it in the name of jesus christ
[3:28] our lord
[3:31] amen and amen well
[3:34] as you know my dear friends brothers and
[3:37] sisters in christ
[3:40] last week we spoke on this
[3:43] fact that in this scripture
[3:47] god says i know
[3:50] and last week we showed that no matter
[3:54] what
[3:54] trouble trial tribulation or
[3:57] problems the believers in the smyrna
[4:00] church
[4:01] age were going through it was a
[4:05] comforting word of god
[4:09] to them that no matter what you may
[4:12] suffer from my name for my word for my
[4:16] testimony i know
[4:19] oh how precious that is to a believer
[4:23] to know that our lord knows
[4:27] that he is saying he cares
[4:32] and he is showing that he watches
[4:35] over his own but
[4:38] not only does our god know about our
[4:42] trial our tribulation our tests
[4:46] and our faithfulness which he will
[4:48] reward
[4:50] but he is also acutely aware
[4:55] of the blasphemy
[4:58] the unbelief of
[5:02] those who say they are jews
[5:05] and are not
[5:09] now we realize that irenaeus
[5:12] was the messenger to this mernian
[5:16] church age himself
[5:20] and the believers that were in this age
[5:25] were confronted by a great problem
[5:30] and that problem was the subversion
[5:34] of the pure faith of god
[5:38] by counterfeit christians
[5:42] a counterfeit church and counterfeit
[5:46] or false preachers with the word of god
[5:52] i'm i believe and i'm aware
[5:55] and i want you to be aware that we
[5:58] are confronted with the same problem
[6:02] in our day and my aim
[6:07] is to help you to
[6:11] distinguish or differentiate
[6:14] between the counterfeit
[6:18] and the real or
[6:21] true now
[6:24] here we find god saying
[6:28] i know the blasphemy of
[6:31] them which say they are jews
[6:37] and are not but are of the synagogue
[6:41] of satan now the word
[6:45] synagogue means place of meeting
[6:50] or meeting place
[6:53] the greek means
[6:56] place of assembly or assemblage
[7:01] now praise god hallelujah now let's
[7:04] engage in this study in god's word
[7:08] to find this answer how we might be able
[7:12] to
[7:13] by the word of god distinguish or
[7:17] differentiate between these
[7:20] two classes good and evil
[7:25] counterfeit and real true
[7:30] and false or praise
[7:33] be to god so many so-called
[7:36] christians everywhere so many that
[7:40] say today that they're christians
[7:43] and they are not but instead
[7:47] they are possessed by satan or
[7:50] synagogues
[7:51] of satan know you not that your body
[7:55] you are the temple of the holy ghost who
[7:58] dwells in you
[8:00] or praise god on the other side
[8:04] it's the opposite by by
[8:07] by taking in unbelief by taking in false
[8:12] doctrine
[8:13] by feeding on vulture food
[8:16] people become synagogues of satan
[8:21] knowingly or unknowingly
[8:24] they become possessed by him led by him
[8:28] controlled by him manipulated by him
[8:32] to do and carry out his
[8:35] evil works and his satanic will may
[8:40] god help us today once we look into
[8:44] the word of god to show this
[8:47] differentiation god said i know your
[8:50] works
[8:51] you're not hidden from me you're hidden
[8:54] from
[8:55] maybe the people on the earth
[8:58] that can't see behind the scenes but i
[9:02] know
[9:03] i know what you're doing i know all your
[9:06] activities
[9:07] that you're carrying out and the
[9:10] blasphemy of that
[9:11] activity of you for you are
[9:15] going around telling a lie saying you
[9:18] are a jew
[9:20] or you're a christian when you are
[9:23] not but you are a tool of satan
[9:27] a part of that synagogue
[9:30] of satan that meeting place
[9:34] that uniting of those uh
[9:37] satanic influences you are
[9:40] part of that great movement of that
[9:45] system in other words you're a hypocrite
[9:48] in other words you are a uh a book
[9:51] that has on the wrong cover
[9:55] the cover says christian but when
[9:59] your the book is opened up and
[10:02] a discerning reader looks at it
[10:06] and begins to read from it he realizes
[10:10] that
[10:10] outwardly it has the sign
[10:13] or title of christian but inwardly
[10:18] it's foul it's evil
[10:21] it's satanic and so
[10:24] my friends they recognize
[10:28] what is hidden underneath that cover
[10:31] and satan does use the term
[10:34] i'm a christian in many people who claim
[10:37] to be christians
[10:39] millions who claim to be christians he
[10:41] uses that as a
[10:43] cover to hide
[10:46] and camouflage his activities
[10:50] his strategies his attacks against the
[10:55] true believer that rest their
[10:58] faith upon this word of the living god
[11:02] now to begin with the word
[11:06] jew does not describe
[11:10] the religion of the jewish people
[11:14] it really only refers
[11:17] to the people
[11:21] of that were of judah of the tribe
[11:25] of judah oh my
[11:29] think about it friends they were making
[11:32] a claim
[11:34] that they were jews because they were
[11:38] born
[11:39] in let's say israel
[11:43] you know they say oh i'm a jew i was
[11:45] born in israel
[11:46] being born in israel or being in israel
[11:50] doesn't make you a jew
[11:54] being in the jewish homeland
[11:57] does not automatically make you a jew
[12:00] even if you were born there it doesn't
[12:03] make you
[12:04] into a jew oh my
[12:08] i tell you friends hallelujah
[12:11] not even joining the jewish
[12:14] religion doesn't really
[12:17] make you a jew you had to be jewish from
[12:21] your genes
[12:23] amen and then you go on to display it by
[12:27] your faith
[12:29] but here it is my friends
[12:32] you find that being born in china
[12:37] doesn't make you
[12:38] chinese you can be a caucasian
[12:42] or an african that was born in china
[12:47] it does not make you chinese to your
[12:51] core
[12:52] you maybe call yourself chinese by
[12:56] nationality but by
[12:59] race you are not chinese
[13:03] you are caucasian you're african or
[13:06] whatever else you
[13:07] are oh my god it's the same as if
[13:10] a pig was born in a manger
[13:15] he may try to act like a lamb talk like
[13:18] a lamb
[13:18] move like a lamb but it doesn't turn him
[13:22] or transform him or make him into a lamb
[13:28] he'll still want to eat his slop and
[13:31] filth
[13:32] and evil but go but
[13:35] while going ahead and claiming that he
[13:39] is a lamb yet he has the nature
[13:42] of a pig feeding on the
[13:46] foul and evil things of this world
[13:50] and of the pig pen of which he is
[13:53] really from and made for
[13:57] oh my think about it hallelujah
[14:01] amen praise god hallelujah
[14:05] or thank god our parentages from above
[14:09] our parentage or our parent is not of
[14:12] this earth
[14:14] remember we were not born on this earth
[14:16] this that
[14:17] or the other in uh this church that
[14:20] church i'm of this army that or the
[14:22] other
[14:23] but we are born from above
[14:26] born by the blood of christ
[14:29] our dna our genealogy is
[14:32] of jesus christ our lord who
[14:36] died for us hallelujah and we were
[14:39] in his the loins of his mind
[14:42] from before the foundations of the world
[14:46] and now made manifest in this age
[14:50] and in this hour that we may display his
[14:54] great
[14:54] uh characteristics display
[14:58] his personality make known his
[15:01] testimony and re let them come back to a
[15:05] remembrance of his

[15:10] son you are christ's child you are
[15:13] christ's
[15:13] daughter you have the resemblance you

[15:20] talk like him you walk like him
[15:22] he is in you and flowing through you and
[15:26] those who are outside recognize
[15:29] you are of that family because you have
[15:32] the family
[15:34] uh uh characteristics and traits
[15:37] and you can't help it it's what you are
[15:40] oh my you are not of those who just
[15:43] say they are christians but are not
[15:47] oh but you are though you are of that
[15:50] group
[15:51] who were made christians who were made
[15:54] the children of god
[15:55] from before the foundation of the world
[15:59] the seed of god was laid the foundation
[16:02] stone was laid in you
[16:05] before the foundation of the world and
[16:08] the seed of god
[16:09] was in you from before the foundation
[16:13] hallelujah praise god hallelujah
[16:16] here you were before the foundation now
[16:19] you
[16:20] are here after the foundation
[16:23] still a son still a daughter still a
[16:26] child of the king we came from him
[16:29] and we're going back to him by the grace
[16:33] of god oh hallelujah

[16:46] praise god give him the glory
[16:48] give him the honor and thank god that he
[16:52] included you
[16:53] and that he placed you in that group
[16:56] which he says my sheep hear my voice
[17:00] and a stranger they will not follow
[17:04] hallelujah amen
[17:08] think of it
[17:12] satan trying to deceive true
[17:16] believers by using
[17:19] people who claimed to be a part
[17:22] of the true church to try to deceive
[17:26] them
[17:27] but thank god for the pro our lord's
[17:31] promised
[17:33] that every name not written in that book
[17:36] of life
[17:37] that will be deceived
[17:40] except the elected will
[17:43] not be deceived and even they would be
[17:47] elected
[17:48] amen would be deceived if not for the
[17:52] fact that they were
[17:53] elected by god before the foundation
[17:58] and cannot be deceived for the seed of
[18:02] god dwells in them and the seed of god
[18:07] does not commit sin does not
[18:10] commit unbelief and not
[18:13] be deceived oh my god i don't say
[18:17] momentarily they may not be thrown off
[18:19] this way or that way
[18:20] but in the or in the in this true sense
[18:23] of the word
[18:24] and the final analysis they cannot
[18:28] will not be deceived hey thanks be the
[18:32] god hallelujah
[18:33] amen praise god these
[18:36] ones that were deceived
[18:40] blinded and taken away by
[18:43] carried away by satan into mystery
[18:46] babylon
[18:47] my friends they are really and truly
[18:51] of the false mind they're carried away
[18:56] they're not the true church
[18:59] but they are of the false church
[19:03] for god says you are
[19:06] of this synagogue of satan
[19:11] oh my god help us
[19:14] now we know synagogue is not the same
[19:18] word
[19:19] as church for synagogue means the
[19:24] meeting place
[19:26] or a meeting place
[19:29] but the word church means
[19:33] called out once the word
[19:37] church means the ones
[19:41] that were summoned the ones that were
[19:45] invited oh praise
[19:48] god only those whom the father has
[19:51] invited
[19:52] can come only those who were
[19:55] brought in by his voice
[19:59] into the mystery into the revelation of
[20:02] himself
[20:03] only those can come
[20:06] the others may make claims they may make
[20:10] wonderful claims but those claims are
[20:14] without foundations they are
[20:17] bottomless and unrecognized
[20:21] in the presence of god but the true seed
[20:24] of god
[20:26] are the invited ones that were invited
[20:30] to receive the the revelation the
[20:33] message
[20:35] the the revelation of the message of
[20:38] this day and of this hour or whatever
[20:42] age or hour or time that they were
[20:45] placed in
[20:47] in the book of psalms we read
[20:51] blessed is the man
[20:56] thou choosest
[21:00] whom thou chooses he chooses
[21:04] and causes to approach
[21:08] unto thee so god does the choosing
[21:12] then god makes the way for
[21:16] the approach into his presence
[21:21] listen that they may dwell
[21:24] in thy courts hallelujah glory to god
[21:28] so the man the woman the person whom
[21:32] god has chosen and then
[21:35] decides who in which age he will call
[21:38] them
[21:40] bring them out separate them and then
[21:44] cause them to draw nigh or to approach
[21:48] unto himself oh blessed be the name of
[21:51] the lord
[21:52] i believe in this age there are called
[21:55] out people
[21:57] in this age there are people chosen by
[22:00] god and blessed by him through his
[22:04] boundless and endless grace to approach
[22:07] unto him to worship glorify and
[22:11] magnify him with clear understanding
[22:14] knowing who their worship and worshiping
[22:18] with
[22:18] revelation fellowshipping with
[22:20] understanding
[22:22] singing with the understanding praying
[22:24] with the understanding
[22:26] doing all with the understanding by
[22:29] given to them
[22:30] by the holy spirit the blessed teacher
[22:34] of john 14 whom the lord himself
[22:37] spoke about when he has come he will
[22:40] guide you into all
[22:41] truth and show you the things to come
[22:44] thank god he is showing it in this hour
[22:47] thank god he is
[22:49] opening the book not just the pages of
[22:52] the book
[22:53] but revealing and making known the
[22:56] unwritten word of god hallelujah
[22:59] the unspoken word of god
[23:03] it's in the book yet it's not written
[23:06] but it must be revealed and understood
[23:10] by the holy spirit oh blessed be the
[23:13] name of the lord
[23:14] thank god hallelujah amen oh glory to
[23:18] god hallelujah
[23:19] yes sir the word synagogue
[23:24] of course means assembly or
[23:27] gathering or meeting place
[23:30] so we gather
[23:34] in the fellowship or the revelation
[23:38] of this fellowship of the mystery of god
[23:43] being made clear and plain
[23:47] as it was prophesied in the word of god
[23:51] it will come in a day when shall not be
[23:54] day or night but at evening time it
[23:58] shall be light oh glory to god
[24:01] light again oh praise god so we
[24:05] fellowship together synagogue means that
[24:08] they
[24:09] gather together they assemble together
[24:14] but their assembly is not of god
[24:19] their assembly is not to his glory
[24:23] and to his honor because assembling
[24:26] could be good or bad
[24:30] the word synagogue doesn't it has
[24:32] nothing to do with
[24:34] bad for a synagogue or a gathering
[24:37] can be either good or bad
[24:42] a tree of good or of evil
[24:45] or of it or a tree of good and evil
[24:48] so here we are friends as they are
[24:52] assembling
[24:53] assembling not of god but
[24:56] they're assembling under their own
[24:58] wisdom
[24:59] and knowledge assembling of
[25:03] themselves isaiah the prophet spoke
[25:07] behold thou shalt
[25:11] surely gather together but
[25:14] not by me gathering together
[25:18] but not drawn together by the holy
[25:20] spirit
[25:22] brought together by some common uh
[25:26] teaching that they received but not
[25:29] brought together by the blessed holy
[25:32] spirit
[25:33] let me illustrate what i mean
[25:36] peter was taught by the lord jesus
[25:38] christ himself
[25:40] peter caught the revelation on the day
[25:43] of pentecost
[25:45] and it so excited and anointed him and
[25:47] the rest of the believers
[25:49] it made them speak with towns and give
[25:52] glory to god
[25:54] the emphasis not on the speaking of
[25:56] towns but that there received the
[25:58] revelation
[25:59] of who jesus was that is what caused
[26:03] them
[26:04] hallelujah so it's the receiving of
[26:07] the revelation of who jesus is
[26:10] that gives one the holy spirit speaking
[26:13] in tongues is just an offshoot
[26:15] it's just uh uh something that that may
[26:18] come
[26:19] oh praise god i'm glad that
[26:22] some of us have caught the revelation
[26:25] for this day
[26:26] and for this hour oh praise god
[26:29] hallelujah yes sir now we find out
[26:32] that we are gathered like peter
[26:36] was he was drawn by the holy spirit
[26:41] now paul
[26:44] called out chosen to be an
[26:47] apostle by the blessed holy spirit
[26:52] after an experience with the great
[26:55] pillar of fire
[26:57] same one that was with israel
[27:01] in the wilderness now met him
[27:04] on the road to damascus knocked him off
[27:08] of his high horse of humans
[27:10] wisdom and knowledge and pride and
[27:12] arrogance
[27:14] brought him down to bite the dust of
[27:17] shame
[27:18] and humility and to be able to look up
[27:22] and say my lord
[27:25] who art the lord and the voice answered
[27:29] i
[27:29] am jesus and it still will answer you
[27:32] the same who are you lord who are you
[27:35] god
[27:36] and the voice will still answer i am
[27:39] jesus
[27:40] whom thou persecuted paul went into the
[27:43] wilderness
[27:45] and spent five years in the presence of
[27:49] almighty god being taught by the lord
[27:52] himself for you know in first
[27:54] corinthians chapter 11
[27:55] he said as was delivered to me by the
[27:59] lord himself that on the night he was
[28:02] betrayed and he began to tell what
[28:04] happened
[28:05] in that room where they were eating but
[28:08] he said
[28:08] it was revealed or given to him by the
[28:11] lord
[28:12] himself he had a visitation from above
[28:15] he had a personal private uh you know
[28:20] conference with god visitation of the
[28:24] holy spirit
[28:26] came out to the wilderness began to
[28:29] preach and teach the word of god
[28:32] and when it was found later on
[28:36] peter said paul the things you are
[28:40] teaching my god hallelujah
[28:42] they are so deep that even i have a
[28:46] time with them but what the point i'm
[28:49] trying to make
[28:51] is that peter had not yet met paul
[28:54] but when they did come together peter
[28:58] was
[28:58] teaching the fullness of the truth of
[29:00] the word of god
[29:02] and paul who had never met him
[29:05] was also teaching and preaching
[29:08] the fullness of the word of god and even
[29:11] more
[29:12] than what peter had at the time
[29:15] and it happened not by
[29:18] them going to a theological school
[29:22] not by paul going to a rabbinical school
[29:26] in jerusalem
[29:27] not by going to some monastery
[29:31] that they had set up somewhere but by s
[29:34] being in the presence of god and got him
[29:38] being his own interpreter
[29:40] revealing his word to paul so that
[29:43] when they came together
[29:47] under the fellowship of the
[29:51] revelation of that mystery they were
[29:54] both saying the same thing
[29:58] they were both preaching one god
[30:02] baptism in the name of the lord jesus
[30:05] christ
[30:06] all that you do do it in the name of
[30:09] jesus christ
[30:11] they were both preaching the same
[30:14] doctrines
[30:14] and glorifying the same god jesus
[30:18] christ the same yesterday today and
[30:22] forever
[30:23] glory to his wonderful name hallelujah
[30:25] amen
[30:26] praise god hallelujah yes sir
[30:30] gathering together but not by him
[30:36] one drawn together
[30:39] by the opening and revealing of the word
[30:42] of god
[30:45] and others gathering together
[30:49] drawn by the dead
[30:52] works and the dead
[30:56] teachings of man
[31:01] think of it back then
[31:06] there were already an invasion
[31:11] perpetrated by satan a subversion
[31:15] of the kingdom of god of multitudes of
[31:19] people
[31:20] entering into the framework
[31:24] of the church of the living god
[31:27] calling themselves jews
[31:31] and there were not
[31:35] you see the reason is because there were
[31:39] liars
[31:43] and when one is a liar
[31:48] a liar can make any
[31:51] claim that they wish
[31:56] for a lie has no foundation
[32:01] it has no truth no
[32:04] button to it
[32:08] they say whatever they wish
[32:12] amen they state their lie
[32:16] as if it's a fact then they repeat it
[32:20] over and over and over again
[32:23] and disseminated everywhere
[32:26] and until it begins
[32:30] to be received and repeated
[32:33] and rumored and spread
[32:37] as a fact
[32:41] but even if the multitudes begin to
[32:44] accept it as a fact
[32:47] it does not change its origin
[32:51] that it all began with a
[32:54] original lie
[32:58] and we know that lying is a bottomless
[33:02] pit as i've said
[33:03] there's no foundations to a lie nothing
[33:07] of the sort
[33:08] and shall we read from the book of
[33:10] revelation chapter
[33:12] 21 verse 8 listen to the voice of god
[33:16] listen to the word of god in this hour
[33:19] not my word but
[33:20] god's word liars no
[33:24] foundations they have no
[33:27] they don't have to have a proper reason
[33:30] or proof or evidence
[33:34] of whatever they're saying but once you
[33:37] start to lie
[33:38] you've opened a doorway to the pits of
[33:40] hell
[33:41] you have opened the doorway to the
[33:44] bottomless pit
[33:46] and you are liable to say anything
[33:48] without evidence without proof
[33:51] amen without any proper reason
[33:54] or reasoning and as the word of god says
[33:58] here
[33:59] listen but they're fearful
[34:04] and unbelievable
[34:07] the abominable and
[34:11] murderers and hormones
[34:15] and sorcerers and idolaters
[34:20] and all liars
[34:24] shall have their part in the
[34:28] lake which burn it with fire and
[34:30] brimstone
[34:32] which is the second death
[34:36] may god have mercy on that
[34:40] lying rotten dirty lying
[34:43] filthy bunch which god says he'll
[34:47] place into the lake of fire
[34:51] because what they state what they claim
[34:54] what they expound or teach has
[34:58] no bottom to it it is a
[35:01] bottom left spit into which you will
[35:04] keep
[35:04] falling and falling on falling and
[35:07] falling and
[35:08] falling endlessly my friends
[35:12] into something that you cannot find
[35:15] any place to stop your falling for their
[35:19] entire foundations
[35:21] is based upon a lie
[35:24] now with this thought in mind
[35:29] this is what caused groups to gather
[35:33] together
[35:35] the pharisees were drawn together in the
[35:38] like manner
[35:40] based on a lie based on lies
[35:44] a profusion of lies baskets and
[35:47] bucketfuls of lies
[35:49] nothing to these liars lying
[35:52] liars here it is and satan
[35:56] is the father of liars jesus said so
[36:00] when he spoke to the pharisees you are
[36:02] of your
[36:03] father the devil for he's a liar from
[36:06] the beginning
[36:08] and the pharisees were drawn together by
[36:12] these by lies the sadducees
[36:16] were drawn together by lies
[36:19] the herodians were drawn together
[36:23] by such lying lies the epicureans
[36:28] the stoics and the libertines
[36:32] all blinded and
[36:35] gathered together attracted to one
[36:38] another
[36:39] by this propensity to
[36:42] lie and to tell lies
[36:45] and if you tell one lie you'll tell too
[36:49] if you tell one lie you open the doorway
[36:52] to the pits of hell
[36:55] think of it
[36:58] the end the early church
[37:01] was almost entirely
[37:04] composed of and made up of jews
[37:09] they were like the original members of
[37:12] the body
[37:14] the twelve apostles themselves were
[37:18] jews the later apostles were either
[37:22] of jews or of proselytes
[37:25] that came to jewish faith
[37:28] thus we find that for people to swear
[37:34] with pride that there were jews
[37:38] would help to give them a claim of
[37:41] prominence and of originality
[37:45] for remember the original apostles were
[37:48] jews
[37:50] so now to say i i'm jew
[37:53] i'm a jew when there were not was
[37:56] blasphemy
[37:58] but there satan was now covering his
[38:00] tracks
[38:02] in intertwining himself as a vine
[38:06] into the framework of the true church
[38:10] by claiming originality
[38:13] and telling this lie and telling it over
[38:17] and over again
[38:18] until that lie begins to stick
[38:23] oh my he doesn't care about the facts
[38:28] he doesn't care about the real fact
[38:32] of history a liar ignores facts
[38:37] a liar ignores history
[38:41] a liar ignores reality and just
[38:44] lies lies lies lies lies a
[38:47] bottomless pit of lies that originates
[38:51] from
[38:52] their father who is the devil and the
[38:55] father of lies
[38:58] in other words they are operating and
[39:00] moving on the satanic
[39:02] influence power and inspiration
[39:05] rather than the holy spirit
[39:08] the pure clean holy spirit
[39:12] of the living god oh may god help every
[39:16] one of us here today my friends
[39:18] oh my oh what a day we're living in
[39:23] we find out this is the same power that
[39:26] was used by the communists
[39:28] to espouse to preach teach propagate
[39:32] some teaching or some evil
[39:35] saying and repeat it over and over again
[39:39] until they got all their people to start
[39:42] believing
[39:44] in communism and so it was it
[39:48] hitler did the same thing lies lies lies
[39:51] lies
[39:52] until he got all the people to believe
[39:54] his lie
[39:56] as truth and
[39:59] many other despots authoritarians
[40:04] and people of that nature
[40:07] to entrench their positions have lied
[40:11] and lied and lied and
[40:13] lied over and over again lying
[40:16] against the purpose plan and will of god
[40:22] oh my do you see something here my
[40:26] friends
[40:27] isn't that the same spirit in the church
[40:30] here today
[40:31] when they lie like that it gives them
[40:35] that originality like i said the
[40:38] original
[40:38] uh believers in the church were all jews
[40:42] they came after them they were not
[40:45] jews but by being in the church they
[40:48] start to make a claim
[40:49] that they were jews and that
[40:53] gave them a sense of arrogance and of
[40:57] originality amen and
[41:00] exclusivity and then that begin to
[41:03] foster religious hatred
[41:07] religious envy religious jealousy
[41:11] just like it did between cain and abel
[41:16] think of it my friends this is the power
[41:20] of satan
[41:22] operating within the framework of the
[41:25] body of the church whoa
[41:29] that same spirit is here in the form of
[41:31] organization
[41:33] in the midst of the church of god
[41:36] and where the same group is claiming the
[41:39] same thing
[41:40] vultures called together by what
[41:45] by their smell are their need
[41:49] they're drawn together by dead meat
[41:52] they're drawn together by dead teachings
[41:55] dead
[41:56] doctrines around some dead
[41:59] animal all these are they
[42:02] who gather around a religious
[42:05] lie who emphasizes death
[42:09] instead of life emphasizing
[42:13] suffering and dying rather than
[42:16] emphasizing
[42:17] resurrection rapture and the day when
[42:21] our lordship
[42:22] shall return to earth again oh
[42:26] my lord god help us amen
[42:30] think of it claiming originality
[42:34] in the true church and claiming that
[42:38] salvation
[42:39] is only found in them because
[42:43] they are the original
[42:47] false original according to the word of
[42:49] god
[42:50] for the intertwine and sinuously
[42:53] in between into the framework and body
[42:57] of the church
[42:58] and began to make that claim which was a
[43:01] lie
[43:01] and still is a foul and evil lie
[43:05] being perpetrated thousands of years
[43:08] later
[43:09] and is still here among us that spirit
[43:12] that kind of a church with that
[43:15] personality
[43:16] is still here with us and it was a lie
[43:19] then and it is a religious lie
[43:23] now according to the word of god they
[43:26] claim they have the keys of the kingdom
[43:29] which they received from peter
[43:34] they even claimed that peter was the
[43:36] first pope
[43:39] they further claim that peter
[43:42] lived and resided in rome
[43:46] when it is a historical fact
[43:52] that peter never did
[43:58] their most educated intelligent
[44:02] annoying followers and adherents
[44:06] believe these lies
[44:10] oh my friends it's astonishing
[44:14] but we can see it they are a synagogue
[44:18] of
[44:18] satan and if satan be our father
[44:23] if she be the descendant of satan
[44:28] who is her father and he
[44:32] is the father of lies then she is the
[44:36] mother of religious lie spouting lies
[44:39] spewing lies out of her mouth according
[44:42] to the book of revelation
[44:44] and spreading the stream of foul
[44:47] sewage of lies everywhere
[44:50] spraying it and covering it all over the
[44:53] peoples of the earth
[44:55] so it is not strange that we have with
[44:58] us today
[45:00] a synagogue of satan or
[45:04] people indwelt by satan
[45:07] the church itself a synagogue of satan
[45:12] its adherence its people
[45:15] synagogues of satan indwelt
[45:19] inspired and and moved by him with his
[45:22] hatred and jealousy
[45:23] of the true church of god amen
[45:27] think of it god said that's blasphemy
[45:31] amen and in this case they were not
[45:34] blaspheming god
[45:36] but they were bearing false witness of
[45:38] the true church
[45:40] or blaspheming the true church
[45:44] so that the world would expect the true
[45:47] church
[45:48] and it gave a false impression of who
[45:51] the true church is and what she would be
[45:54] like
[45:55] so they were blaspheming against the
[45:58] true
[45:58] church amen hallelujah jesus
[46:02] and justice kane persecuted
[46:06] and killed abel because
[46:10] he came john
[46:14] 1st john i believe it's chapter 3
[46:18] he came was the son of that
[46:22] wicked one not of adam
[46:26] but the son of the wicked one
[46:29] and of the false vine and he tried to
[46:33] destroy his brother abel
[46:36] that same spirit is in this false church
[46:40] who tries to uh destroy
[46:45] by inquisitions by by all manner of
[46:48] torture uh whether physically
[46:52] or spiritually or as
[46:55] assassination of character murder
[46:58] spiritually and naturally taking out
[47:02] or taking away the true believer the
[47:05] true
[47:06] church trying to destroy it
[47:09] so that the people will not have a frame
[47:12] of reference
[47:13] to recognize the true from the false
[47:17] whatsoever destroying the christians
[47:21] in the first few years of that first age
[47:24] and now this same false
[47:27] vine group is still here today
[47:30] and even more strongly attempting
[47:34] to destroy the true believer in this
[47:37] second
[47:38] age and in all the other ages to come
[47:42] even to this day and i'm going to close
[47:44] by saying this
[47:46] the antichrist spirit is still here with
[47:49] us
[47:50] and it is growing and growing
[47:54] every day until one day
[47:57] he will put in his personal appearance
[48:00] but until then my friends let us serve
[48:03] the lord
[48:04] true and faithful serving him every day
[48:07] giving glory and honor to his to his
[48:10] perfect
[48:11] will way and word amen until we come to
[48:15] receive our reward
[48:17] when we come to the last mile of the way
[48:20] may the lord jesus bless you real good
[48:23] and cover you under his precious blood
[48:26] and protect you from the assaults of the
[48:30] mind and of the soul
[48:32] from this evil synagogue of
[48:35] satan god bless you we'll meet again
[48:39] around the word of god amen
[48:42] and amen
[49:03] [Music]
[49:18] you
