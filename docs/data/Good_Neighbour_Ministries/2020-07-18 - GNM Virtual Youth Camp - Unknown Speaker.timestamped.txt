[57:21] service and we thank God for the
[57:24] wonderful U song speci tonight amen and
[57:29] uh
[57:29] now this is the main reason why we came
[57:35] is to receive his word to hear what he
[57:38] has to say for us
[57:41] tonight uh yesterday we received a
[57:44] tremendous message of how the
[57:48] Watchmen is living in US directing us
[57:52] and guiding us and warning us and and
[57:56] moving us in our lives from situations
[58:00] that um we sometimes find ourselves
[58:04] in but you know the wonderful part about
[58:08] serving the lord in this day and in this
[58:11] hour is knowing that he started the
[58:15] work he started your
[58:19] journey he started the Deliverance in
[58:21] your life you didn't know you needed it
[58:25] but he knew exactly what you would need
[58:27] he knew the time and the season that
[58:29] he'd have to draw you out from all the
[58:34] let's call it Amnesia you didn't know
[58:36] who you really
[58:38] were but then when he opens the
[58:41] understanding all of a sudden you start
[58:42] to see wait a minute you mean I don't
[58:45] have to be
[58:48] trapped in the anxieties and the fears
[58:51] and in the doubts that this world you
[58:53] know tries to trap you in all the time
[58:56] making you think that this is who you
[58:58] are this is your life take it or leave
[59:01] it that's what the devil wants you to
[59:03] believe but that's not what God has for
[59:06] you I believe tonight we've got our
[59:09] brother Boaz who's anointed by the
[59:12] spirit of God is going to continue and
[59:15] give you exactly what you need to hear
[59:17] tonight I want you to be

[59:23] your whole life when he makes his word

[59:30] same and your friends are going to know
[59:33] it amen praise God and so at this time I

[1:02:10] it is a privilege to be back with you

[1:02:15] Fellowship uh not many times we hear the
[1:02:18] term it is around the word but now we
[1:02:21] can say that now that word is living in
[1:02:23] our hearts and that's the the greatest
[1:02:26] joy that a Christian can experience amen
[1:02:29] so if you uh have your bibles if you can
[1:02:32] turn with me there uh to the Book of
[1:02:35] Luke chapter 15 verse
[1:02:38] 17-9 and I'm going to share here uh my
[1:02:42] uh screen so you can see it as well you
[1:02:44] can follow with me uh in in these
[1:02:47] scriptures that we're going to be
[1:02:48] reading here so book of uh The Book of
[1:02:51] Luke chapter 15 verse uh 17-9
[1:02:56] and it reads like this and when he came
[1:02:59] to himself he said how many higher
[1:03:02] Servants of my fathers have breed enough
[1:03:06] and to spare and I perish with hunger
[1:03:10] and he said listen to what he saying
[1:03:12] here and I will arise and go to my
[1:03:14] father and I will say unto him father I
[1:03:17] have sin against heaven and before Thee
[1:03:21] I am no more worthy to be called thy son
[1:03:24] make make me as one of thy higher
[1:03:27] servants now we can turn to the book of
[1:03:30] Colossians chapter 2 verse 13- 15 and it
[1:03:35] says and uh you being death uh in your
[1:03:39] sins and the in circumcision of your
[1:03:41] flesh had he quickened together with him
[1:03:45] having forgiven you all all trespasses
[1:03:49] blooding out the handwriting of
[1:03:51] ordinances that was uh against us which
[1:03:54] was contrary to us and took it out the
[1:03:57] way nailing it to the cross and having
[1:04:00] spoiled principalities and Powers he
[1:04:03] made a show of them openly triumphing
[1:04:07] over them in it amen so you you may have
[1:04:10] your seats right now so as as I said it
[1:04:13] is certainly a privilege and once again
[1:04:15] uh uh I'm grateful for this opportunity
[1:04:18] that we have given to speak to you all
[1:04:21] and um you know in seeking God's mind
[1:04:23] and as we were talking yesterday about
[1:04:25] that Watchman and yesterday we said
[1:04:27] something and it's like certainly there
[1:04:30] are some times where you know you find
[1:04:33] yourself in in in situations where uh
[1:04:37] you have made the wrong choices you have
[1:04:39] made the wrong decisions but even in the
[1:04:42] middle or in the mid midst of that God
[1:04:45] has Mercy or has had mercy over your
[1:04:48] life and and he is a god of a second
[1:04:51] chance but today by God's grace we're
[1:04:53] going to keep uh you know with that that
[1:04:56] we talk we were talking yesterday about
[1:04:57] that Watchman and brother Dan he said
[1:05:00] something talking about Amnesia and I
[1:05:02] was like well stop there brother Dan
[1:05:03] because we're gonna focus a little bit
[1:05:05] on that and in a few more o other things
[1:05:08] so we're so grateful that we are in the
[1:05:10] same channel and and the one thing that
[1:05:13] I just want is that this that you see
[1:05:16] here or you are seeing on your screen is
[1:05:18] is just is just a human being standing
[1:05:21] but what we want we want his Spirit we
[1:05:24] want his presence we we want want uh the
[1:05:26] father we want him to speak through US
[1:05:29] amen because if I'm going to be giving
[1:05:31] you my idea if I if I'm going to be
[1:05:33] giving you my concept that won't work it
[1:05:36] won't change anything in your life but
[1:05:39] if it is the holy spirit going through
[1:05:41] this a screen going through these lips
[1:05:44] of Flesh you know it will do something
[1:05:46] in your life and that's what we want we
[1:05:48] want that quickening power that changing
[1:05:52] power that can come and change our lives
[1:05:55] amen so now as we just read here in the
[1:05:58] Book of Luke chapter 15 and if you have
[1:06:01] had the opportunity to read this uh this
[1:06:03] chapter specifically so here is Jesus
[1:06:05] talking and he's talking about uh you
[1:06:07] know different pares and uh one of them
[1:06:10] is the Lost ship and the other one is a
[1:06:12] lost coin and then he talks about the
[1:06:15] the prodigal son so today by God's grace
[1:06:18] let's focus a little bit and think about
[1:06:20] about the prodical son you know um if if
[1:06:25] we think a little bit about this this
[1:06:27] guy this let's say this guy um he had a
[1:06:30] good Watchman if we can if we can see it
[1:06:32] from that perspective his parents were
[1:06:35] Godly Parents were a parents that were
[1:06:37] always praying because the prophet of
[1:06:39] God said that the the the the parents
[1:06:42] were always praying for for his two
[1:06:44] their two children you know that God
[1:06:47] will protect them that God would lead
[1:06:49] them that God will be over them you know
[1:06:52] but you know as as we said uh when you
[1:06:54] have good wife judement sometimes we
[1:06:56] despite or or we kind of we take for
[1:06:59] granted what the Lord has provided in
[1:07:01] our lives amen so as we can say here you
[1:07:05] know he had Godly Parents that feared
[1:07:08] God and that gave the best instruction
[1:07:10] they could give to their two children
[1:07:13] but if we we find something here that uh
[1:07:17] this younger son he is that is
[1:07:19] surrounding himself by the wrong company
[1:07:21] you know he started having the the the
[1:07:23] wrong uh influence amen so therefore if
[1:07:27] we can say it this way the opinion of
[1:07:29] his parents you know the parents were
[1:07:31] like watch this don't go don't go to
[1:07:35] this specific location or this don't
[1:07:38] associate yourself with that people but
[1:07:40] you know what it seemed that he was
[1:07:42] going through here and and leing from
[1:07:44] and leing through here amen so what
[1:07:47] happened and uh you know he he had he he
[1:07:50] made a lot of new friends and and
[1:07:52] everything was good for him because you
[1:07:54] know he was feeling good he was being
[1:07:56] accepted in in in in the in the circle
[1:07:59] of friends that he had they they they
[1:08:01] were being a bad influence to him but he
[1:08:03] didn't see it amen he was despising the
[1:08:06] the the if we can say it that way the
[1:08:09] the advice from his parents amen so if
[1:08:12] we can focus a little bit on on on on uh
[1:08:15] he he did a few things that uh kind of
[1:08:19] we consequences of of his choices uh
[1:08:22] that we we want to talk or or we want to
[1:08:24] focus on right now and if we can focus
[1:08:27] on them we'll be three of them amen so
[1:08:31] let me put it here again on the
[1:08:41] screen number one and and this is for
[1:08:45] you young people it's like the the the
[1:08:48] gr company will bring Disobedience to
[1:08:52] the authority amen think about that one
[1:08:54] for a second the wrong company will
[1:08:56] bring Disobedience to to uh to the third
[1:09:00] and uh you know and and that's the
[1:09:02] reason you know one of the first things
[1:09:04] as as I said he started associating
[1:09:07] himself with the wrong people and that
[1:09:09] wrong that and that people was telling
[1:09:11] him you know what you don't have to go
[1:09:12] you don't have to go to the synagogue or
[1:09:14] you don't have to uh to go with your
[1:09:16] parents to the synagogue like that's
[1:09:18] that's for all people like that that's
[1:09:20] kind of out of fashion and you know just
[1:09:24] come with us let's do this let let's
[1:09:25] break the Sabbath and and you know all
[1:09:27] this the the Traditions they had you
[1:09:29] know and as I said the first thing you
[1:09:31] know the wrong company will bring
[1:09:33] Disobedience to the authority and and
[1:09:36] and he started doing that and little by
[1:09:37] little was kind of every single time the
[1:09:39] parents will tell him something it will
[1:09:41] seem that he didn't care amen but that's
[1:09:44] why the Bible speaks about about about
[1:09:46] your children or about the youth people
[1:09:48] in in in general everybody you know
[1:09:51] honor that your parents that that you it
[1:09:54] may be well with with the and you have a
[1:09:57] long life on Earth amen and uh and we
[1:10:01] can say this way as well like same thing
[1:10:03] happens with Christians when they start
[1:10:06] associating the themselves with the
[1:10:08] wrong company it will bring as a result
[1:10:11] discouragement Amen Let me let me put it
[1:10:13] this way you know if uh when you go to a
[1:10:16] camp uh you know if you're like uh doing
[1:10:19] some camping out or like you go camp a
[1:10:22] to to have some little camp out and you
[1:10:24] know when you're going to start a fire
[1:10:27] and and and all we all have seen the
[1:10:29] fire and and and then uh you know when
[1:10:33] they have all all the all the wood and
[1:10:35] and they start the fire while everything
[1:10:38] is a stick together you're gonna have a
[1:10:40] good fire amen so what's what what
[1:10:44] happens when when somebody uh suddenly
[1:10:47] removes a piece of that fire and put it
[1:10:49] on the side that that little little
[1:10:52] piece of wood is going to start dying
[1:10:54] because it's is not around the the rest
[1:10:57] of the fire amen so that's the same
[1:11:00] thing with a son of God with a daughter
[1:11:02] of God when you start kind of drifting
[1:11:05] apart or separating yourself from the
[1:11:08] fire of God or from the good company
[1:11:10] that you have from the good friends from
[1:11:13] from the from the right fellowship and
[1:11:15] this is what happened with this young
[1:11:16] man you know the the the the the parents
[1:11:19] will always tell him hey don't don't do
[1:11:21] that don't don't go with that people
[1:11:22] don't don't don't go don't do that but
[1:11:25] he as I said he was not listening he was
[1:11:28] just making one choice after one after
[1:11:30] another and and all the choices that he
[1:11:33] was making they were wrong amen so uh as
[1:11:37] I said as a result there there was
[1:11:40] discouragement or or in a Christian in a
[1:11:42] Christian uh let's say uh young lady or
[1:11:45] young men there will be discouragement
[1:11:47] because now what are you going to be
[1:11:49] talking to the with the people that that
[1:11:52] is not believing the same thing as you
[1:11:54] believe
[1:11:55] then you start dist distancing yourself
[1:11:57] from other Christians you know you start
[1:11:59] being discouraged you start you start
[1:12:01] distancing distancing yourself from
[1:12:03] other Christians and but what happened
[1:12:05] and that's what happened with this with
[1:12:07] this young man you know that was the
[1:12:09] first thing he started distancing
[1:12:11] himself from from other Christians and
[1:12:13] then the next thing you know a few a few
[1:12:16] days later he made a choice and he he
[1:12:19] said I will go to my father and I will
[1:12:21] ask him for the portion of my
[1:12:23] inheritance so the first thing he start
[1:12:25] associating himself with the wrong
[1:12:26] company and now he's gonna say you know
[1:12:28] I need to go and ask my father for my
[1:12:31] inheritance and he if you read your
[1:12:34] Bible and if you think about inheritance
[1:12:36] he had a right for that inheritance but
[1:12:38] maybe not maybe but it wasn't the time
[1:12:41] for him to receive that inheritance you
[1:12:44] know because he was not ready to receive
[1:12:46] that that that inheritance amen uh and
[1:12:50] now if we can think about about another
[1:12:53] thing that that he he he was uh going
[1:12:56] through you know we can say that he was
[1:12:58] making choices without praying and
[1:13:01] seeking for the correct advice anden and
[1:13:06] we and we can say that the when when
[1:13:09] you're going through through things like
[1:13:11] that let me put it again here on the
[1:13:18] screen so making choices without praying
[1:13:22] and seeking for the correct advice will
[1:13:25] bring temporary
[1:13:26] contentment certainly you
[1:13:30] know the the what the world has to offer
[1:13:34] is just for temporary contentment and
[1:13:37] that's it nothing else amen so what
[1:13:41] happened
[1:13:43] here if we if we can say it this way you
[1:13:46] know how wrong he was because he was
[1:13:49] just leaving the moment without thinking
[1:13:52] that his present decisions will have
[1:13:55] impact in his future so think about it
[1:13:58] think about it if you're making a
[1:14:00] decision right now is that decision is a
[1:14:04] decision that you are making Holy Ghost
[1:14:07] LED because that's gonna have an impact
[1:14:10] in your future you know because if you
[1:14:13] think about planting seeds you know what
[1:14:16] seeds am I planting right now that later
[1:14:19] on I will reap the fruits or I will get
[1:14:22] the fruits of those decisions or or the
[1:14:25] seeds that I am planted amen and uh what
[1:14:29] I can say may we today make the right
[1:14:32] decisions that will have an eternal
[1:14:35] impact in my life if today I'm making
[1:14:38] the decision to follow Christ that's
[1:14:41] gonna have an eternal impact in my life
[1:14:45] amen how many can say Amen you can say
[1:14:47] Amen there there where you are seated
[1:14:48] amen so and we can we get blindsided
[1:14:52] that we don't realize that our decision
[1:14:55] s will bring will bring us many problems
[1:14:59] when you make the wrong decisions or or
[1:15:01] or the wrong choices they will bring you
[1:15:04] a lot of
[1:15:05] progress how many how many times we have
[1:15:08] made decisions that later on we regret
[1:15:11] and say I should have listened to my
[1:15:13] parents I should have listened to my to
[1:15:15] my pastor I should have listened to my
[1:15:18] friend but guess what God as I said it
[1:15:21] at the beginning of of of of this sermon
[1:15:24] God is God that can give you a second
[1:15:26] chance because as I said if you are
[1:15:28] finding yourself right now that you have
[1:15:30] made a wrong choice there is a still
[1:15:33] Grace for you and there is still that
[1:15:35] opportunity for you that you can take it
[1:15:38] and God as I said God is a god of Second
[1:15:41] Chances amen so now once he got the
[1:15:47] portion of his of his inheritance he
[1:15:49] went uh to another city you know that's
[1:15:52] what the scripture says that he went to
[1:15:54] another city
[1:15:55] and and and he started uh spending or or
[1:15:58] he started living the good life amen let
[1:16:02] me share my screen again here and he
[1:16:04] started Living a good life you know
[1:16:05] because he he had money and and and he
[1:16:08] had he had good things you know he had a
[1:16:11] lot as I said he had a lot of friends
[1:16:14] you know but the first one as we said he
[1:16:17] started associating himself with the
[1:16:19] wrong company the second one he he he he
[1:16:23] uh made choices to have a temporary
[1:16:25] contentment but he wasn't looking at the
[1:16:27] long term and the third one he separated
[1:16:30] himself from his uh you know he he uh
[1:16:33] from his family as we're saying here
[1:16:35] family separation you know he left his
[1:16:38] family and spent all his inheritance in
[1:16:42] the wrong living why because that's what
[1:16:45] that's the that's that's the thing that
[1:16:47] he knew and he was not listening anymore
[1:16:49] to his parents because that's what
[1:16:51] happened with a lot of a lot of with
[1:16:54] this generation now they don't want to
[1:16:56] listen to the parents they want to do
[1:16:58] their own thing because they they think
[1:17:00] that they know everything you know but
[1:17:03] the Holy Spirit if we can bring it back
[1:17:05] again the holy spirit is is is is back
[1:17:09] or is here with you to uh uh to make you
[1:17:13] do the right choices or or to put it in
[1:17:16] to put in your heart to make the right
[1:17:18] choices amen so as we can see here he
[1:17:21] left his family and spent all his
[1:17:23] inheritance in
[1:17:25] wrong you know he lived the best life as
[1:17:28] if there wouldn't be a tomorrow and I
[1:17:30] can tell you remember young lady young
[1:17:33] man you know the so-called friends will
[1:17:36] be available only when they can take an
[1:17:39] advantage on you amen and that's the sad
[1:17:43] part you know because when when when
[1:17:45] somebody sees that they can get
[1:17:47] something good out of you they will they
[1:17:49] will be around you but as soon as you
[1:17:51] have nothing the So-Cal friends won't be
[1:17:54] there anymore and that's what happened
[1:17:55] with this young man you know he didn't
[1:17:57] have his he didn't have his family he he
[1:18:00] didn't have money anymore and now where
[1:18:03] was
[1:18:05] he what can what can we say this to this
[1:18:08] amen so every decision we can say right
[1:18:11] now this this point or we can bring this
[1:18:13] point every decision that he
[1:18:16] made in in in in simple words it was
[1:18:20] bringing him let's say to a prison in
[1:18:24] other words The Watchman was telling him
[1:18:26] if you're going that path you're going
[1:18:28] to prison and what he did he went that
[1:18:31] path and he went to prison and and I'm
[1:18:34] talking about a spiritual prison I'm
[1:18:37] talking about a circumstance that he was
[1:18:39] going and he was his own choice amen it
[1:18:42] was not that the parents sent him to go
[1:18:44] there it was not that that the the good
[1:18:47] friends sent him to go there but it was
[1:18:50] his own choice amen my desire My pray
[1:18:54] here tonight is that we by the Holy
[1:18:57] Spirit by that Watchman we will make the
[1:19:01] right
[1:19:02] choices Amen in other words as I said he
[1:19:06] became a prisoner of his own
[1:19:08] circumstance he became a prisoner of of
[1:19:11] his o of his own decisions amen we can
[1:19:15] say another thing here that our
[1:19:17] decisions either will set us free or
[1:19:20] will make us
[1:19:22] prisoners amen he and we can think a
[1:19:25] little bit about more more more about
[1:19:27] him you know he he he his parents were
[1:19:29] Godly Parents as I said and there one
[1:19:32] one more thing here you know after he
[1:19:35] didn't have any money after he didn't
[1:19:37] have any friends after he he didn't have
[1:19:40] a way to go back home what
[1:19:43] happened the Bible says that he went to
[1:19:47] a place and he and he and he went to to
[1:19:50] a to to a let's say to a farmer and he
[1:19:53] asked him and and he told him hey can
[1:19:54] work there and the farmer was like you
[1:19:56] know what I don't have anything to any
[1:19:59] any work for you oh you know what he
[1:20:01] said I have something for you you go and
[1:20:04] take care of the pigs go and take care
[1:20:06] of the
[1:20:07] swine let me tell you one thing
[1:20:09] according to the to the Hebrew law
[1:20:12] according to the to the to the
[1:20:14] Commandments that God gave to the to the
[1:20:16] Hebrew children in that time in those
[1:20:18] days the the to be around around the
[1:20:22] swine or around the pigs what was AB
[1:20:25] Abomination before the Lord so can you
[1:20:29] think about it that every single
[1:20:31] decision he made BR brought him so to
[1:20:35] such a low state that all the laws all
[1:20:39] God's God's uh requirements God's
[1:20:41] principles he broke them he wrote the
[1:20:44] Commandment of honoring his parents he
[1:20:46] wrote the Commandment that now that he
[1:20:48] was you know with with the with the
[1:20:51] hidden and now he was you know taking
[1:20:53] care of the pigs
[1:20:55] you know and that was a that was
[1:20:57] something humilate humiliating if we can
[1:21:00] say it that way but guess what as I said
[1:21:05] there is a God of second Chan and if
[1:21:08] today you may find yourself in a low
[1:21:12] estate Psalms
[1:21:14] 13623 says who remember us in our low
[1:21:19] estate and for and then the Bible says
[1:21:22] for his mercy endureth forever and also
[1:21:26] the scripture says that his mercies are
[1:21:28] new every morning so if if if do they
[1:21:33] you need one of those mercies you can
[1:21:35] say your mercies Lord are new every
[1:21:38] morning I want one of I want that Mercy
[1:21:41] or I want that promise that says that I
[1:21:44] can be forgiven I have I I want that
[1:21:48] promise that that says that you love me
[1:21:50] I want that promise that you can give
[1:21:53] joy on speak
[1:21:55] and full of Glory that is his promise
[1:21:58] and you have that right once you have
[1:22:01] repented once you have say Lord I'm so
[1:22:03] sorry the Lord can come and give you
[1:22:06] those mercies every single day amen
[1:22:10] because that's why this Bible is here
[1:22:12] for us that every day we can go here and
[1:22:15] say Lord your mercies on you every
[1:22:17] morning what do you have to tell me this
[1:22:20] morning and he says repent and be
[1:22:22] baptized and honor thy father and thy
[1:22:24] mother you know for sake not disembl
[1:22:28] together you know those are mercies that
[1:22:30] we can receive every day of Our Lives
[1:22:33] amen so we're so happy to hear all these
[1:22:37] things that Lord even in the middle of
[1:22:39] his worst circumstance Lord you bring
[1:22:41] him out of
[1:22:44] there and let me tell you one thing and
[1:22:47] we have some parents that have join this
[1:22:49] this this uh this uh Youth
[1:22:52] Camp the prophet of God tells us
[1:22:55] that his parents never sto praying for
[1:22:59] him his parents they had a promise that
[1:23:04] they that no matter how lost or how low
[1:23:07] their son will be he was going to return
[1:23:10] back to where he belonged so parent
[1:23:14] father or head of the family if you have
[1:23:16] a son or you have a daughter that right
[1:23:19] now is is is in Amnesia I can tell you
[1:23:22] that if you keep praying and and in in
[1:23:25] in Pro in in taking that promise that
[1:23:28] says that that none of the ones that you
[1:23:31] have received they will be lost you keep
[1:23:33] praying and saying Lord if I have
[1:23:36] applied the token in my home this my son
[1:23:39] that is lost is gonna be is gonna is
[1:23:42] gonna be fun this my my son that was
[1:23:45] that that is dead is gonna become to
[1:23:48] Resurrection amen because it doesn't
[1:23:51] matter the circumstance H as long as
[1:23:54] that son or that daughter are on the
[1:23:57] under a promise you can claim them
[1:24:00] today think about this time didn't
[1:24:04] matter how it didn't matter the hour
[1:24:08] didn't matter to them what matters to
[1:24:10] them was that they had a promise so if I
[1:24:14] can tell you tonight if you are claiming
[1:24:17] or or you are you you are in need of
[1:24:20] something time how when where it do
[1:24:24] doesn't matter you will come to pass
[1:24:27] because that is what he has promised in
[1:24:29] his word amen now if you find yourself
[1:24:33] in such a state either uh you you can be
[1:24:37] in this condition like this man was or
[1:24:41] or or as I said or or a mother or or a
[1:24:44] father are in this situation just keep
[1:24:46] praying just keep just keep claiming
[1:24:50] what the Lord has already promised to
[1:24:52] you amen no
[1:24:56] let me let me let me put this uh another
[1:25:00] one another thing
[1:25:04] here listen what brother randam says
[1:25:07] about
[1:25:09] Amnesia and then can keep talking a
[1:25:12] little bit here I hope you you guys are
[1:25:16] getting my point here but my desire my
[1:25:19] my my my aim or like what I want to
[1:25:21] bring here is that it doesn't matter in
[1:25:24] the circumstance or the situation that
[1:25:26] you can find yourself even though at
[1:25:29] first you didn't listen to that watch
[1:25:31] man but that Watchman is giving you a
[1:25:33] second chance amen so now now listen to
[1:25:37] what the prophet of God says he says now
[1:25:39] this Amnesia we're told is uh is you
[1:25:42] you're that you know you you it caused
[1:25:46] you to be to a place where you cannot
[1:25:49] identify
[1:25:51] yourself and then he said a little bit
[1:25:53] later in in in in in in that quote it
[1:25:56] says now worry sometimes causes that
[1:26:00] amnish amen and and and and another
[1:26:03] thing that causes Amnesia people is
[1:26:06] getting between two opinions that will
[1:26:09] cause Amnesia and it get you it gets you
[1:26:12] to a place you know that what you have
[1:26:14] that what you've done you you've lost
[1:26:16] your reasons you've lost your mind you
[1:26:19] can make you you don't know who you are
[1:26:22] you can't identify yourself you can walk
[1:26:26] around and eat and everything but you
[1:26:29] still can't identify
[1:26:32] yourself how interesting that is you
[1:26:35] know this man we think about it again he
[1:26:39] he he was uh you know he didn't know who
[1:26:41] he was he lost his identity and that's
[1:26:44] what the enemy wants in your life he
[1:26:47] wants you to lose your identity he he
[1:26:49] doesn't want you to listen to God he
[1:26:51] doesn't want you to listen to The
[1:26:52] Watchmen he doesn't want you to listen
[1:26:54] to your parents he doesn't want you to
[1:26:56] listen to your
[1:26:57] pastor why because he wants you to lose
[1:27:01] your identity he wants you to lose who
[1:27:03] you are in Christ but I can tell you if
[1:27:07] you can uh think about it and you can
[1:27:09] think in the promises of God that you
[1:27:11] can say I am a Son of God I am a
[1:27:14] daughter of God and it doesn't matter if
[1:27:16] I'm in in such a low estate I know that
[1:27:18] he will bring me up he will bring me
[1:27:21] through he will bring me to uh to heaven
[1:27:24] only places because that is his promise
[1:27:26] amen now brother renom he says he he he
[1:27:30] he he talk about a story and he was
[1:27:33] talking about uh you know this uh this
[1:27:36] guy that he was brought as an slave you
[1:27:40] know and he was there in the plantation
[1:27:42] and
[1:27:44] uh when uh when the Masters they they
[1:27:47] went and they wanted to buy some his
[1:27:48] slaves they saw this man and and they
[1:27:52] saw him and the man was there you know
[1:27:54] he was standing and and he didn't have a
[1:27:57] sad face he he he was you know like you
[1:28:01] know owning where he was you know he was
[1:28:04] standing he was I'm here and I'm gonna
[1:28:06] be the best and then uh people as as the
[1:28:11] you know the the Masters as the the as
[1:28:14] the broker and ask him hey we want to
[1:28:18] buy that one and and the broker said no
[1:28:21] that's not for sale and and they were
[1:28:23] like why he's not for sale and he's like
[1:28:26] do you feed him the same and the and the
[1:28:29] broker said yes he eats beans he eats uh
[1:28:32] water he eats hard bread he eats exact
[1:28:37] same thing and then so then uh they ask
[1:28:40] him so why is he in that position
[1:28:43] knowing that he's he's bound with chains
[1:28:46] and with chains and and and stuff like
[1:28:49] and he's like well one time I asked him
[1:28:51] the same thing because he was wor
[1:28:54] working and and he was doing everything
[1:28:56] you know with a good attitude and and
[1:28:58] all those good things and and I asked
[1:29:00] him why are you acting that way and and
[1:29:04] and and and the bro and that is like
[1:29:07] here reply you know what because I know
[1:29:11] that I have been brought to this place
[1:29:13] as an slave but I know that where I come
[1:29:16] from I am the son of a
[1:29:19] king and that even though I'm here like
[1:29:23] bound with with these chains here with
[1:29:26] whatever you want to bind me here I know
[1:29:29] that I am a son of a king so that's why
[1:29:33] the broker told the Masters that's why
[1:29:35] he's not for sale so I can tell you that
[1:29:38] the same for you tonight you know
[1:29:40] sometimes the enemy can can bind you but
[1:29:43] you know and that's as I said it when he
[1:29:46] as we're talking here about Amnesia when
[1:29:48] when the enemy kind of he he he makes
[1:29:51] makes you believe that you are are that
[1:29:54] you are not a child of God then what's
[1:29:56] going to happen then he's going he's
[1:29:58] going to bring you to that Amnesia but
[1:30:00] once you have recognize that you are a
[1:30:03] child of God that it doesn't matter the
[1:30:05] state where you can find yourself but
[1:30:08] you know that you're a Son of God you're
[1:30:10] gonna come from from that prison into
[1:30:13] freedom in Christ amen because where you
[1:30:16] come from where I come from I know that
[1:30:19] I am a son of the king amen so that's
[1:30:22] the greatest promise that we can have
[1:30:24] today that I am not just the son of a
[1:30:27] king I am a son of the king of kings the
[1:30:29] Lord of lords amen amen so what else can
[1:30:34] we say here you know we think we keep
[1:30:36] thinking about this prodal son God's
[1:30:39] grace is such is so amazing that even in
[1:30:43] in that state this son he was awakened
[1:30:47] from his admission he was awakened from
[1:30:50] from his nightmare that he was he was
[1:30:53] leeping
[1:30:55] so as I said by God's grace we know now
[1:30:59] that we are children of the allm mighty
[1:31:02] God we have been Washed by the Water of
[1:31:05] the word we have been forgiven we have
[1:31:08] been Justified we have been restored we
[1:31:11] have been redeemed we have been
[1:31:14] delivered from anything in our lives and
[1:31:17] now we know that we are the children of
[1:31:21] God because that's his promise that's
[1:31:24] the gift of God that was given to us and
[1:31:27] we don't have we didn't have to pay
[1:31:29] anything it was a free gift for
[1:31:32] us amen then here he
[1:31:36] said the prodical son again how many
[1:31:39] higher Servants of my fathers have bread
[1:31:42] enough andare and I perish with hunger
[1:31:46] and I'm here in this
[1:31:49] CH you know
[1:31:58] how many of you can say that in in in in
[1:32:01] the middle or in the midst of your
[1:32:03] mental chaos there God open his door of
[1:32:07] love and compassion just to tell you
[1:32:10] that that is not your place that you are
[1:32:14] his son that you are his daughter that
[1:32:17] that he cares for
[1:32:20] you I can tell you one thing once the
[1:32:23] enemy push you out of your position it
[1:32:26] will be easier for him to attack you
[1:32:29] that's why you know when when when the
[1:32:31] flock or when the ship when they are
[1:32:32] together like it's hard for the W the
[1:32:35] Wolves to come and attack them because
[1:32:38] this is what happened and that's that's
[1:32:40] an interesting thing to see you know
[1:32:42] when when when when that Wolf come in if
[1:32:46] the Sheep are together they will just
[1:32:49] kind of walk together and they will
[1:32:51] squee him and they will kill that wolf
[1:32:54] amen but what happen if there's one ship
[1:32:57] like far from the flock when the Wolf
[1:32:59] come the Wolf come he going to come and
[1:33:01] he's going to kill it amen that's why if
[1:33:04] we can say it this way when the enemy as
[1:33:06] I said it the enemy find you by yourself
[1:33:09] he's gonna come and attack you and if
[1:33:12] you are not with the right company
[1:33:14] you're are not with the with the right
[1:33:16] with the W uh with the the right
[1:33:18] Fellowship he's gonna come and he's
[1:33:20] going to try to kill you amen
[1:33:28] now let's bring this son or let's bring
[1:33:33] this prodal son out of the
[1:33:36] prison because we can say that even
[1:33:40] though he was in in in in that in that
[1:33:43] prison you know it was not a physical
[1:33:45] prison it was a mental prison as we said
[1:33:48] he was in a big an Mission he didn't
[1:33:51] know who he was he didn't know he he he
[1:33:53] he didn't remember who he was amen but
[1:33:56] suddenly he he recognized and he said
[1:33:59] you know what I am a son I am a son of
[1:34:03] of a king as well I am a son of a master
[1:34:06] that I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna
[1:34:08] tell him father I have sin against
[1:34:11] heaven and against you I am no longer
[1:34:14] worthy to be your
[1:34:15] son but let me tell you one thing it
[1:34:19] doesn't matter again I can tell you
[1:34:21] young people it doesn't matter in this
[1:34:23] state that you find yourself today what
[1:34:26] matters is if you come out of that and
[1:34:30] you recognize who you are in Christ
[1:34:32] that's what we wna tell you today don't
[1:34:35] forget who you are in Christ amen now
[1:34:41] look I would like to give you some
[1:34:43] things here that I have learned in my
[1:34:45] Christian Journey you know in when you
[1:34:48] find yourself in a prison don't think
[1:34:50] that that prison is going to be forever
[1:34:53] because when you are a child of God the
[1:34:56] Bible says and they shall know the truth
[1:34:59] and the truth will set them free amen
[1:35:04] what is the truth is a revealed word of
[1:35:07] the hour that is the truth for us so
[1:35:09] this truth is gonna set me free amen
[1:35:13] now let's share our screen here
[1:35:19] again very quick
[1:35:25] in the message he cares do you care the
[1:35:27] prophet of God
[1:35:29] says the trouble is that in our case we
[1:35:33] won't take that that we we we won't take
[1:35:36] what the remedy says to do he said we
[1:35:40] got the remedy but we won't take it we
[1:35:43] say we do because we can read it but to
[1:35:47] to really take it we don't do it in
[1:35:50] other words you have the word of God in
[1:35:53] other words you you have the message of
[1:35:54] the hour you have the sermons of your
[1:35:56] pastors but it is up to you to take care
[1:35:59] or not that's the remedy for all your
[1:36:01] problems there is nothing else that
[1:36:03] could be a remedy but the word of God
[1:36:05] the revealed message of the hour that's
[1:36:08] the remedy that we have for us to live
[1:36:10] in this neurotic age amen
[1:36:14] now the remedy or solution to get out
[1:36:18] out of our circumstance was and as I
[1:36:21] said it will always be in need is our
[1:36:24] Lord Jesus Christ there is nothing else
[1:36:26] there is not any uh denominational idea
[1:36:28] or Creed or a Dogma or anything the only
[1:36:31] thing that can set you free is not
[1:36:33] brother boas here speaking to you this
[1:36:35] this evening no is Christ in you the one
[1:36:39] that can set you free amen now as I
[1:36:44] said we can we can present this as
[1:36:46] principles that that I have learned in
[1:36:49] my Christian Life that can help you
[1:36:51] today if you're finding yourself in pre
[1:36:53] and that you can say you know what I can
[1:36:55] apply that principle that's fine but
[1:36:57] this is just what the Lord had placed in
[1:37:00] my in my heart amen
[1:37:04] now let's see here
[1:37:07] again if you ask yourself how do I get
[1:37:10] out of my Prison number
[1:37:15] one we have to an knowledge that we are
[1:37:20] wrong you know this is very important
[1:37:23] important why because this require
[1:37:27] humility and willingness to change if
[1:37:30] you're going through a through a
[1:37:32] situation in your life acknowledge that
[1:37:35] you have done wrong why because when you
[1:37:38] acknowledge that the Lord is mindful of
[1:37:41] your of your acknowledgement it's like
[1:37:44] let's let's put it this way when we're
[1:37:46] talking about acknowledge something is
[1:37:49] to realize oh I've done it wrong oh I
[1:37:51] have to mend this thing you know you
[1:37:53] know it where can we find that Luke 1518
[1:37:56] through1 19 it says these young man said
[1:38:00] I will get up and I will go to my father
[1:38:03] and I will say to him father I have
[1:38:06] sinned against heaven and in your sight
[1:38:11] I am no longer worthy to be called your
[1:38:13] son just make me like one of your higher
[1:38:17] servants but I can tell you when you're
[1:38:19] a child of God it doesn't matter if you
[1:38:21] as I said if you're in a low state or
[1:38:24] like no estate at all it doesn't matter
[1:38:27] if you are his son once you acknowledge
[1:38:29] once you recognize that you have done
[1:38:31] wrong he is willing to forgive you he's
[1:38:33] willing to bring you up from that low
[1:38:36] lowest State then Psalms 325 it says and
[1:38:40] I acknowledged my sin to you and my
[1:38:43] iniquity I did not hide I said I will
[1:38:47] confess my transgressions to the Lord
[1:38:49] continually unfolding the past till uh
[1:38:53] uh all is so then you instantly forgave
[1:38:57] me the guilt and in iniquity of my sin
[1:39:02] in other words we can say here uh when
[1:39:05] you're acknowledging acknowledging
[1:39:08] something or when you're recognizing
[1:39:10] something this is not just once but like
[1:39:13] every day every hour every minute every
[1:39:16] second you have to say Lord if I have
[1:39:18] done something wrong please forgive me
[1:39:21] amen now
[1:39:24] and we have some other scriptures if
[1:39:25] you're going to take note of them but
[1:39:27] this is very important if you find
[1:39:29] yourself in a situation where you need
[1:39:31] God's forgiveness I will say one first
[1:39:34] thing that you can do is acknowledge
[1:39:36] that you have done
[1:39:40] wrong amen and we have another one you
[1:39:44] know and if we think a little bit about
[1:39:47] it and we go back to the to the prophets
[1:39:49] in the in in the Old Testament every
[1:39:52] single time they will have to go and and
[1:39:55] request something from the Lord even
[1:39:57] though they were they were not uh they
[1:40:00] have not uh kind of done anything wrong
[1:40:02] against the Lord they will always say
[1:40:04] Lord we have sinen against you we are
[1:40:06] living in a way that you don't want us
[1:40:09] to leave we come here to acknowledge our
[1:40:13] fault amen Jeremiah we we had it there
[1:40:16] Jeremiah 313 it says only know and
[1:40:20] understand and acknowledge your iniquity
[1:40:22] and guilt that that you have rebelled
[1:40:24] and transgressed against the Lord your
[1:40:26] God and have scattered your favors among
[1:40:29] strangers on their every Green Tree and
[1:40:32] you have not obeyed my voice says the
[1:40:35] Lord in other words the Lord is telling
[1:40:36] you acknowledge recognize that you have
[1:40:38] done something wrong what happened with
[1:40:41] this young man he went he he when he was
[1:40:44] you know with the in in the in the in
[1:40:46] the mighty in the mighty place or with
[1:40:49] the with the swine he was recognizing
[1:40:51] you know what I have to go back and I
[1:40:52] have to my father I have sinen against
[1:40:54] Heaven I have sinen against God and I
[1:40:57] have sinen against your side father
[1:40:59] forgive me that's what he said did did
[1:41:03] did the father rejected him no not at
[1:41:05] all so first thing we said you have to
[1:41:09] acknowledge second
[1:41:17] thing
[1:41:20] repent and ask to be forgiven why
[1:41:24] because many people they just
[1:41:26] acknowledge and they stay there they
[1:41:29] don't ask for forgiveness they they they
[1:41:31] they they think that if they have done
[1:41:33] something wrong they don't have to be
[1:41:34] they don't have to ask for forgiveness
[1:41:36] but God is telling us if I if I if I
[1:41:39] have acknowledged something I have to
[1:41:41] repent and ask and I have to ask for
[1:41:43] forgiveness amen now the prophet of God
[1:41:47] says Jesus said
[1:41:49] repent every one of you and Peter did
[1:41:53] and I mean Peter did it on the on the
[1:41:55] day of Pentecost repent and be baptized
[1:41:58] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:42:01] remission of your sins and you shall
[1:42:03] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost when
[1:42:05] you have TR truly repent and believe on
[1:42:09] the
[1:42:10] Lord now if we see here in the Book of
[1:42:14] Luke
[1:42:15] 5:32 and and is saying here I have not
[1:42:19] come to Rouse and invite and and call
[1:42:21] the righteous but the Airing ones in
[1:42:24] other words Jesus is talking and he
[1:42:27] saying I had I didn't come to the to the
[1:42:29] heal I came to the to the sick ones amen
[1:42:32] those not free from sin and what is he
[1:42:34] what has he come to them for to
[1:42:37] repentance to change their minds for the
[1:42:40] better and and hardly to amend their
[1:42:43] ways with a abhorrence of their past
[1:42:47] sins that is what the Lord wants he
[1:42:50] wants you to repent as we said the first
[1:42:52] one is to acknowledge the second one is
[1:42:54] that we have to repent and then acts
[1:42:57] 3:19 it says so repent change your mind
[1:43:01] in purpose turn around and return to God
[1:43:05] that your sins may be erased that times
[1:43:08] of refreshing and uh of a Reviving with
[1:43:12] fresh air we can see here may come from
[1:43:15] the presence of the Lord so in other
[1:43:17] words every single time that we repent
[1:43:19] brother Paul was preaching he's like
[1:43:21] when the Lord is coming with this refesh
[1:43:23] pring times in when he's coming to give
[1:43:25] you rest is when you you can enter into
[1:43:28] into into a rest with Christ and and and
[1:43:32] again I'm talking to you young people
[1:43:34] because now the situation or how things
[1:43:37] are are are going on you know like the
[1:43:40] the enemy is coming constantly and he's
[1:43:43] attacking your mind is is is bringing
[1:43:46] you know those thoughts is bringing
[1:43:48] those ideas that that go uh that they go
[1:43:52] against against against the word of God
[1:43:55] and that's we're talking about these
[1:43:56] things that you know every single time
[1:43:58] that that we that we uh make a m say we
[1:44:01] we make it right amen because if God had
[1:44:05] mercy on the on the prodigal son he had
[1:44:09] he can have mercy on you if you're going
[1:44:11] through a situation today
[1:44:15] amen now in the Book of Revelations
[1:44:19] 3:19 It also says here
[1:44:23] when he's giving the message to the last
[1:44:25] Church AG or like to one of the church
[1:44:29] ages here here he says to Those whom I
[1:44:31] dearly and Tenderly love I I tell their
[1:44:35] faults and convict and convince and
[1:44:38] reprove and chasen I discipline and
[1:44:41] instruct them so be enthusiastic and in
[1:44:44] Earnest and burning with Zeal and repent
[1:44:48] change your mind and attitude
[1:44:53] so what do we say we have to acknowledge
[1:44:55] first first the second thing we have to
[1:44:58] repent and ask for forgiveness and and
[1:45:01] and it but if it has to be like
[1:45:04] something that is coming from your heart
[1:45:06] that you say Lord I didly sorry I didn't
[1:45:09] mean it I didn't want to do it that way
[1:45:11] but you have to be honest amen
[1:45:15] now we said the first one was
[1:45:17] acknowledge and second one was repent
[1:45:21] and then there's another one that is
[1:45:23] hard for many
[1:45:25] people
[1:45:27] because it requires to confess your
[1:45:31] fault I'm going to tell you this this is
[1:45:33] beautiful because once your fault has
[1:45:36] been confessed it doesn't have power
[1:45:40] over your life confession sets you free
[1:45:45] it is one of the greatest things that
[1:45:47] could happen to a person a load is taken
[1:45:51] from you the
[1:45:53] doesn't have power over you anymore how
[1:45:57] many can say and rejoice on that that
[1:46:00] once you have confessed your fault
[1:46:03] nothing there will be any anything you
[1:46:06] know it's like let me put Let me give
[1:46:08] you this example you know some of you
[1:46:10] may like your chocolate chip cookies
[1:46:13] right so let's say your mom cooked them
[1:46:16] and and she said but you are not
[1:46:17] supposed to have them after you have had
[1:46:20] dinner right and then
[1:46:23] what happened you know as you love
[1:46:25] sweets and and you love those cookies
[1:46:28] then you're going to be like okay I have
[1:46:29] to wait I have to wait but then suddenly
[1:46:31] you know there is something that you
[1:46:33] start you know what I'm gonna eat it and
[1:46:36] when you were little you ate that cookie
[1:46:39] and your mom knew that you did it but
[1:46:41] she was like who did it who did it and
[1:46:43] everybody were like no we don't know and
[1:46:45] you were like no I don't know I don't
[1:46:47] know and then suddenly there was
[1:46:49] something in your little heart when you
[1:46:51] were a child and you were like you know
[1:46:53] what it was me Mom and what would your
[1:46:56] mom what would she do she wouldn't kind
[1:46:58] of say oh you did it oh no she will say
[1:47:01] you know what that's fine or sometimes
[1:47:03] mom will give you a a little a little
[1:47:05] bit of Fellowship amen but at the end of
[1:47:08] the day if I asked you today how would
[1:47:10] you feel after you confess
[1:47:12] it was there was there some Freedom that
[1:47:15] you were like oh I was able to confess
[1:47:17] it well that's the exact same thing that
[1:47:21] the Lord is in inviting us to do today
[1:47:24] that we can confess and that we can come
[1:47:27] and say Lord I have done this wrong I
[1:47:30] ask your forgiveness you know that's
[1:47:34] very important that we can come to the
[1:47:37] Lord with a with a sincere heart because
[1:47:39] it's what the Bible says that that a
[1:47:41] sincere heart uh he will not reject amen
[1:47:46] now in the message he cares do you care
[1:47:49] listen what the prophet of God says he
[1:47:52] says I think one of the things that's
[1:47:54] that keeps our people from being healed
[1:47:57] is the lack of confession is the lack of
[1:48:00] sincere of sincere confession and then
[1:48:04] he said God's provided way is repentance
[1:48:07] confessions and showing the results
[1:48:10] bringing forth fruit meat for repentance
[1:48:14] showing
[1:48:16] sincerity amen so what can we say here
[1:48:21] this world and he said it in this in in
[1:48:24] in in in this quote but it's a little
[1:48:25] bit lengthy so that's why I didn't put
[1:48:27] it here but he said in in in in this
[1:48:30] quote the prophet of God says you
[1:48:33] need this world needs repentance this
[1:48:38] world needs to repent because this is
[1:48:41] what is causing so many trouble but we
[1:48:43] know that this already finished that the
[1:48:45] Lord is just finishing his work in us
[1:48:48] but if people will really repent if
[1:48:50] people will really confess in people
[1:48:52] really be honest the Lord can use that
[1:48:55] honesty and bring something greater in
[1:48:59] that people amen so to you as a young PE
[1:49:03] as a young girl or as a Young Man the
[1:49:05] Lord is telling you if there is
[1:49:07] something that you've have found
[1:49:09] yourself again in a prison you know as
[1:49:12] as we have been saying here that W man
[1:49:15] if you didn't obey the first time the
[1:49:17] Lord is Mindful and he's telling you you
[1:49:19] know what the one thing that you have to
[1:49:22] do here if if you can do it you
[1:49:24] acknowledge you uh you you repent you
[1:49:28] confess and and and I can take that
[1:49:31] confession and set you
[1:49:33] free would you like to receive that
[1:49:36] today I believe that the Lord is mindful
[1:49:38] mindful o of your confession he he's
[1:49:42] close to those that are are are are are
[1:49:45] crying out to him and are saying Lord
[1:49:47] I'm sorry I didn't mean it I didn't want
[1:49:49] to do this I didn't I didn't want to do
[1:49:52] that but forgive me and he's able to
[1:49:55] forgive you
[1:49:57] amen
[1:49:58] now we if we look here there's another
[1:50:02] scripture that I would like to give you
[1:50:04] today the Book of Proverbs chapter 28
[1:50:07] verse3 it says he who covers his trans
[1:50:11] transgressions will not
[1:50:13] Prosper but whoever confesses and
[1:50:16] forsakes his sins will obtain Mercy how
[1:50:20] many one obtain Mercy you can read that
[1:50:23] scripture and you can practice this
[1:50:24] principle confess your your your
[1:50:27] mistakes to the Lord and say Lord I have
[1:50:29] not done it the right way please forgive
[1:50:32] me we have another scripture 1 john9 and
[1:50:35] it says if we freely I'm reading from
[1:50:38] the Amplified version so if we freely
[1:50:41] admit that we have sinned and confess
[1:50:44] our sin our sins he faithful you know
[1:50:47] the Lord as the Bible says even when we
[1:50:51] ar faithful he remains faithful that's
[1:50:55] that's that's the the the greatest thing
[1:50:57] you know that even that we have done
[1:51:00] what we have done in our past but we
[1:51:02] have repented we have confessed we we
[1:51:05] have acknowledged it then he remains
[1:51:08] faithful a amen he's faithful and just
[1:51:12] true to his own nature and promises and
[1:51:15] he will forgive our sins and he just
[1:51:18] don't forgive but he forgets he places
[1:51:20] your sins in the Seal of forget
[1:51:23] forgetfulness amen he cleans us from all
[1:51:26] unrighteousness everything that is not
[1:51:29] in Conformity to his will in purpose in
[1:51:33] thought and in action that's his promise
[1:51:36] that's his gift and then James 5 5:116
[1:51:41] says confess to one another Therefore
[1:51:45] your faults your sleeps your false steps
[1:51:48] your offenses your sins and pray for one
[1:51:52] another that you may be healed and
[1:51:55] restored through a spiritual tone of
[1:51:57] mind and heart the earnest heartfelt
[1:52:00] continued prayer of a righteous man
[1:52:02] makes tremendous power available and and
[1:52:06] we can say dynamic in its
[1:52:10] working what are we saying here that
[1:52:13] somebody if somebody here can be sick or
[1:52:17] or is is dealing with something but if
[1:52:20] there is something hidden there that
[1:52:22] that hasn't been con confessed the Lord
[1:52:26] cannot work in your
[1:52:28] life the prophet of God gives us an
[1:52:30] gives us an example of of a of of a
[1:52:33] couple you know this sister she was so
[1:52:35] sick and and the prophet of God will
[1:52:37] pray for her and she will get delevered
[1:52:40] but a little bit later she will get sick
[1:52:45] again and they were wondering why is she
[1:52:49] getting sick again every single time
[1:52:53] then the prophet of God one of the times
[1:52:55] he he he the angel of of the Angel of
[1:52:58] the Lord came and visit visit his home
[1:53:01] and what happened he then they they
[1:53:03] called the sister she came and the Lord
[1:53:06] God revealed some things or something
[1:53:09] that she she had H uh seen uh or in in
[1:53:15] like a few a year or a few years before
[1:53:18] but that she she she said I have them in
[1:53:20] my heart and I have I have asked for
[1:53:22] gift
[1:53:23] you know but the prophet of God says but
[1:53:27] sister uh when when he's talking about
[1:53:30] these things is like at the end of day
[1:53:32] the main purpose of how the prophet is
[1:53:33] telling us is that if you have seen or
[1:53:35] if you have done something again uh your
[1:53:38] your your your brother or your sister
[1:53:40] you have to go and make it
[1:53:43] right in this case after this sister
[1:53:46] made it right what happened the Lord set
[1:53:49] her
[1:53:50] free and that's what he wants for us
[1:53:53] today if there is something that needs
[1:53:55] to be confessed that we can say you know
[1:53:58] what Lord I'm so sorry I confess Lord if
[1:54:01] I have done something against my sister
[1:54:03] or again my against my brother against
[1:54:05] my father against my mom I'm gonna go
[1:54:07] and tell them to forgive me amen now
[1:54:13] listen let me share my screen again here
[1:54:15] very
[1:54:18] quick this is what the prophet of God
[1:54:20] says that UNC conf best sin and and they
[1:54:25] could he says like they could pour for
[1:54:28] our you know for uh oil on on your head
[1:54:32] till they got a gallon on there they
[1:54:34] could Stomp and kick and snort and run
[1:54:36] across the platform and screening holler
[1:54:39] but that devil will stay right there
[1:54:42] he's got a right to and as long as he's
[1:54:45] got a right to stay he will hold his
[1:54:47] grounds in other words when that devil
[1:54:51] is not exposed when that thing that you
[1:54:53] have to confess is not exposed the enemy
[1:54:56] is is going to have a hole in your life
[1:54:59] amen so you want to live a Victorious
[1:55:01] life if you have done something wrong
[1:55:04] just go and say Lord I'm sorry and if I
[1:55:07] done it against my brother against my
[1:55:09] sister God can can can come in and and
[1:55:12] bring that you know that that freedom to
[1:55:14] you and then this is the end of the
[1:55:17] quote and they confess their sins and uh
[1:55:21] they they came back you know with their
[1:55:23] arms around one another coming up and
[1:55:26] and um and then I I I wanna I want to
[1:55:29] focus here and I said
[1:55:33] now it is different now by God's grace
[1:55:38] and by the authority of God's word Satan
[1:55:41] will have to leave you that's right and
[1:55:45] and then the prophet of God says then
[1:55:47] there he left and she is the happiest
[1:55:49] little woman there in new oven Indiana
[1:55:52] she's testifying everywhere her and her
[1:55:55] husband both live a victorious
[1:55:59] victorious life that's what you want for
[1:56:02] your life today as I said before first
[1:56:05] thing we have to acknowledge second
[1:56:08] thing we have to repent the third thing
[1:56:10] we have to
[1:56:11] confess but don't stay there don't stay
[1:56:14] just in in in let's say in those three
[1:56:16] steps or whatever but the Lord is
[1:56:19] telling us to go to to go to press to
[1:56:21] keep going forward to keep to keep
[1:56:23] pressing on Amen so
[1:56:26] now we can write down or if you're
[1:56:29] taking some notes Here There is one more
[1:56:32] thing that the Lord is inviting us to do
[1:56:35] today he is asking us to press on and to
[1:56:39] go forward to don't dwell in your
[1:56:42] mistake you know because that's where
[1:56:45] the enemy always always will try to get
[1:56:48] you when you have made a mistake and and
[1:56:52] he will always come in because that's
[1:56:54] what the Bible says that he is the
[1:56:56] accuser of the Brethren amen but we have
[1:56:59] a a a high priest that he's always
[1:57:02] interceding for us but and now he's
[1:57:05] inviting us and he's telling us don't
[1:57:07] dwell in your mistake if you have
[1:57:10] acknowledged you have repent you have
[1:57:13] confessed just keep pressing on keep
[1:57:16] pressing on
[1:57:18] Amen now John 811 it says talking to the
[1:57:24] woman you know that was cut in in in the
[1:57:26] the act of sin it says she answered no
[1:57:29] one Lord and Jesus said I do not condemn
[1:57:32] you either go on your way and from now
[1:57:36] on sin no
[1:57:39] more as I said if you have made a
[1:57:42] mistake or if you have done something
[1:57:44] wrong don't dwell in that mistake
[1:57:46] because that's where the enemy can get
[1:57:48] can get you and that's where the enemy
[1:57:51] that's what he did with with that prodal
[1:57:54] son you know one mistake led him to
[1:57:56] another and another mistake and there
[1:57:59] where he found himself at the end of the
[1:58:01] day he found himself with the swine
[1:58:04] there with the with with the with
[1:58:06] everything was was was nasty can you
[1:58:08] imagine that but out of that the Lord
[1:58:12] had mercy on his life and he made him go
[1:58:16] back to his mind and say how many how
[1:58:19] many higher servants are in My Father's
[1:58:21] House and I am here he said I will go
[1:58:25] and and I will ask him to forgive me and
[1:58:28] I will I have a knowledge I have
[1:58:30] repented I have confessed and I'm gonna
[1:58:33] press forward that's what the Lord is
[1:58:35] inviting you to do today if there is
[1:58:37] something it doesn't matter the age that
[1:58:39] you are in it doesn't really matter what
[1:58:43] matters is if daily you can come to the
[1:58:46] Lord and say Lord forgive me Lord I have
[1:58:49] not done the right thing Lord I have
[1:58:51] lied to my parents I I have I I have
[1:58:54] watched the wrong website Lord please
[1:58:56] forgive me the Lord is willing to
[1:58:59] forgive you but don't as I said it here
[1:59:03] don't dwell in your mistake because if
[1:59:07] you dwell in your mistake every single
[1:59:09] time the enemy is going to get you
[1:59:13] amen
[1:59:16] now another scripture Deuteronomy 5:33
[1:59:20] and it says you shall walk in all the
[1:59:22] ways which the Lord your God has
[1:59:25] commanded com commanded you that you may
[1:59:28] leave and that that it may go well with
[1:59:31] you and that you may live long in the
[1:59:34] land with which you shall possess and
[1:59:37] then John
[1:59:39] 812 it says Once More Jesus addressed
[1:59:43] the crowd and he said I am the light of
[1:59:46] the world he who follows me will not be
[1:59:50] walking in the dark but we have the
[1:59:54] light which is
[1:59:56] life would you like to have that in your
[2:00:00] life that is what the Lord is inviting
[2:00:02] us today and what we can say here if we
[2:00:05] can bring this to an
[2:00:08] end and if you can if we can see we can
[2:00:11] say this that even how he didn't hear
[2:00:15] his Watchmen and the warnings God is
[2:00:18] still gave him a second chance and I can
[2:00:22] say tonight that you still have an
[2:00:24] opportunity to M your way he is the god
[2:00:29] of Second Chances don't forget that he
[2:00:32] is the god of a second
[2:00:35] chance but what can we say here how can
[2:00:38] I get out of my prison I will
[2:00:40] acknowledge Lord I will repent I will
[2:00:43] confess my fault and I will press on
[2:00:47] Amen so if you have something today if
[2:00:51] you have something in your heart that
[2:00:53] you want to ask the Lord to forgive you
[2:00:55] he's willing to forgive
[2:00:57] you
[2:00:59] amen if I can as I can if I can say it
[2:01:02] this way from a personal experience by
[2:01:06] applying these principles the Lord has
[2:01:09] given me a Victorious
[2:01:12] Life from experience and I can tell you
[2:01:16] if you just yield your heart to the Lord
[2:01:19] you just tell him Lord please is is
[2:01:22] there something that I have to ask you
[2:01:23] forgiveness for I want to repent I want
[2:01:26] to confess I want to acknowledge it Lord
[2:01:29] and I want to go forward because that's
[2:01:32] what the Lord wants us today he wants us
[2:01:36] to keep pressing on Amen we all can
[2:01:40] stand there where you are and if you can
[2:01:43] build an
[2:01:44] altar in your heart

[2:07:03] [Music]
[2:07:05] you man thank you brother boas for that
[2:07:08] word amazing amen God bless you
[2:07:21] [Music]
[2:07:26] praise God forever more God bless you my
[2:07:29] brother amen what a wonderful wonderful
[2:07:32] word of God
[2:07:33] tonight I believe uh the Holy Spirit has
[2:07:37] made it quite clear to
[2:07:40] us that he's a god of Second
[2:07:43] Chance and that he is looking beyond
[2:07:47] your mistakes beyond your conditions
[2:07:51] Beyond uh the circumstances that you may
[2:07:53] be facing right now in your life uh you
[2:07:56] need to look to the word of God you need
[2:07:58] to look to the blood and you know we
[2:08:02] heard very clearly tonight about
[2:08:05] confession and I know a lot of people
[2:08:08] all of a sudden they start to think oh I
[2:08:09] got to confess and I've got to go and I
[2:08:12] got to confess to this person or that or
[2:08:14] who do I where where do I
[2:08:16] confess there is one mediator between
[2:08:19] man and God now if you've done something
[2:08:22] and you know it's very obvious and it's
[2:08:25] a brother or a sister or a friend or
[2:08:27] your mother your father or whatever it
[2:08:29] might be then you need to
[2:08:33] go and speak with
[2:08:35] them and let them know that that because
[2:08:39] but before you go to them I hope you've
[2:08:42] gone to God I hope you've gone to that
[2:08:46] to that Fountain to know that this is a
[2:08:49] personal walk that it's not about you
[2:08:51] you you know displaying your confession
[2:08:54] God is looking at your heart and God is
[2:08:57] looking at the sincerity of your heart
[2:09:01] that you go directly to him and that you
[2:09:06] enter into that relationship personally
[2:09:08] with him and then I can tell you it'll
[2:09:11] be a lot easier to go and
[2:09:14] confess to that person that you may have
[2:09:17] done wrong because God will work on that
[2:09:20] person too
[2:09:22] you know that's the beauty that we're
[2:09:24] dealing with a living Supernatural God
[2:09:28] you you don't have to worry that you're
[2:09:30] going to be uh oh I'm going to be
[2:09:32] ashamed I'm G to be uh
[2:09:35] embarrassed
[2:09:36] no God works in such ways that when you
[2:09:41] are sincere and you go to him
[2:09:45] first he'll make all things brand new
[2:09:49] he'll change the hearts of your friends
[2:09:52] your your your your family those that
[2:09:54] you've hurt those that you've made
[2:09:57] mistakes to or even the hurts and the
[2:10:01] scars and the anxieties that you've got
[2:10:04] to deal with as a young person because
[2:10:06] of the scars and the situations that
[2:10:08] you've had to deal
[2:10:10] with this is the god that we serve I
