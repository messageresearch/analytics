God that he came into each and every one of our lives at an appointed time God bless you Saints thank you so much wonderful worship this morning I walk into this wonderful atmosphere of Liberty knowing that the spirit of the Lord is interested in us he wants to fellowship with us this morning he loves and adores each and every one of you I want you to know that amen because his his mercy and his love endureth forever and ever and ever once you've come to a realization that you are an attribute of God that you are not somebody that started on this Earth so many years ago Gabe you might have started 65 years ago I started 61 or two years ago can't remember right now but you know everybody knows when they started here on this earth right they've got a birth date I want you to know that you started much earlier than that that you had actually no beginning and you will have no end because you're an attribute you're going through an Earthly experience you're experiencing this Dimension and you know sometimes it gets really rough it just gets really rough amen but then then you come into this then you come into a realization of who you really are then you come into the house of the Lord and this morning we're just excited about being in the house of the Lord we have a word from the Lord amen that's why we come into the house of the Lord as a minister of God we know that we've been you know by God's grace God calls us right we didn't choose our calling God chooses Our Calling he says I'm the author I'm the finisher so we believe in that calling we believe in the power of God to move through the body of Jesus Christ we believe in the Supernatural listen if it wasn't for the supernatural you wouldn't even be here look at just look around you look around you you see you see from the east from the west from the north from the south you see people from all different parts of the planet assembled Here For What for what what what what is it that's drawing your attention here this morning this is the Living God it's the presence of the Living God it's healing in your lives it's Deliverance in your life we're going to be looking at a lot of things this morning as we go to the word uh we certainly want to remember our pastor amen he's uh in Montreal I believe he's going to be ministering this morning at a church in Montreal so uh you know we've been praying for him I'm sure you've all been praying but let's just pray that the Lord will be a great blessing wherever he is and let the word go forth and bless them the way that we've been getting blessed amen praise God it's just it's just an anointing on a servant of God in this day and in this hour somebody that's caught the current stage of the ministry of Jesus Christ and our pastor has been a leader in that way he's always received that divine inspiration from the Lord and we've been the beneficiaries of that in that we've you know by God's grace we just receive it fresh all the time amen I'm expecting fresh this morning glory to God we're going to read a lot of scriptures that we've all read and you know maybe read many times over and over and you've heard but the Holy Spirit it is a living God amen praise God I've been so blessed by the word of God that's been coming forth yes I've been away physically but I have not been away spiritually you could never ever get rid of me I'm in the body of Christ there's just no way the devil tries to get rid of me every single day he can't do it so you ain't got a chance praise God but I appreciate the word of God that's been coming forth from these brothers you know we've been so blessed brother Christopher you know it brought a wonderful message God has the answer let me tell you he has it before you even ask praise God and and that was a real blessing Amen brother Tim you know walking deeper with the Lord moving forward you want to you want a greater walk with I've always believed that you want a greater walk with God then you need to go deeper you need to you you need to do your part you need to do what you know you can do and then God just automatically he's always there he's always there waiting for you to walk with him amen we just need to go deeper sometimes and we need to get out of our our Conformity we need to get out of our you know idle conditions and so forth It's been a real blessing brother Desmond you know he he got into a thought there on Wednesday night on thirst and it's funny because I was actually working on a message thirst for this Sunday and and I was you know I was listening to the message this week with brother Branham you know on the message thirst and I was but then all of a sudden it just kind of left me and that's the way it happens and I was wondering and then the Lord led me into this this morning where we're going to be but then I come Wednesday night and brother Desmond says thirst and I thought oh my praise God you know that's the body of Christ amen that's the way the body operates you know you're just moving by the spirit of God and You're Expecting you know to receive something from the Lord and you know you're just walking every day and it's simple keep walking in Simplicity Saints praise God and what a time we've been having with our pastor uh that that the word has been just wonderful so let's go to the word this morning amen let's go and see what the Lord has this morning it's going to take all of us together to really benefit this morning from the presence of the Lord and what he has for each and every individual from the youngest to the oldest if you've got expectation in your heart this morning I promise you God will meet a need for you this morning amen that's his desire that's his will that's why we assemble we're going to be looking at all these things let's put up the first slide amen this morning we're going to be looking at um perfect unity in Christ it's all part of the rapturing faith series that we've been on we want to stay there because I believe there's a faith that's coming to this church that the reason why we gather every single Sunday every Wednesday every time you go into a prayer meeting every time you get on your knees is because you're under expectation for the rapture for the body change for the transition for the great next stage of Our Lives it could happen today it could happen in 100 years from now we can't put any interpretation on God's timing but we believe as the Revelation comes to us that we're getting closer and closer amen let's look at our scripture our first scripture reading is from Hebrews chapter 10 verse 23 to 25. and he says let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised if there's ever a time that you gotta stand it's right now amen and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is you know a lot of people just don't think they need to go to church anymore as long as we're here on this Earth the body of Christ we need to edify each other amen amen we you try and just sever your arm yeah you can still live but you're not going to be the same you remove an organ from your body you can still live but you're not going to be whole amen well Jesus his body is perfect and this and if we're going to take a Rapture then we're going to need to be in perfect Faith perfect Unity amen praise God next scripture and like it said so much more now we need to assemble so much more as that day approaches what day this day Colossians 3 12-15 says put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of Mind meekness long-suffering for bearing one another and forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye don't hold anything don't hold anything and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectedness Imagine without that love if you're not projecting love into every situation I don't care what it is it can't be perfect we're talking about perfect unity in Christ we're part we're talking about rapturing faith we're talking about getting to a place where that faith in us becomes so real and we become so one and so perfect with it that the change is just going to automatically happen and let the peace of God rule in your hearts to the which also ye are called in one body one body and be ye thankful next scripture the last one before we sit down Jesus prayed to the father now pay attention here we're talking about perfect unity in Christ I pray for them I pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me for they are thine and all mine are thine and all thine are mine and I am glorified in them and now I am no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to thee Holy Father keep through thine own name Those whom thou has given me that they may be one As We Are One you may be seated father we ask your blessing upon this word this morning Lord we want to enter into that perfect Faith perfect Unity perfect love Lord this is the hour where Lord if those things your Prophet said it very clearly nothing but perfect love can enter into that place Lord I know we cannot as human beings fathom it at times Lord because we get into situations we get into heartaches we get into arguments we get into this uh breakups and discrepancies within our whole with our homes within our our workplaces our daily lives Lord but still there is a love that supersedes and Lord that is what we've experienced when you called us you've brought us thus far and we know you're going to take us the rest of the way bless and prosper your service this morning have the preeminence Lord speak to the needs of your people this morning Lord that we can just Rejoice knowing Lord that we've arrived in a special place granted we pray remember our pastor anoint them use him wherever he may be Lord let the word freely flow into the hearts of the people and may they be liberated under the liberty of Christ in Jesus name amen praise God halleluia listen to The Prophet here God and this is from the message uniting time if you get a chance uniting time and sign you want to listen to that a lot of inspiration was drawn from that message I believe that we're living in a wonderful it just caught my attention in a miraculous way uniting time and time you know so here now God is uniting his bride she is coming together from the East and the west and the North and the South there is a uniting time and that's on right now what is she uniting for the rapture amen God's getting her ready yes sir uniting what is she uniting with with the word for all heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away she's uniting herself with thus saith the Lord regardless of what any denomination or anybody else says it doesn't matter what anybody else says out there there's a lot of teaching going on listen this is the hour where it would be so deceiving it would deceive even the very elect and let me tell you you probably know by experience the kind of things that you come across and and the kind of uh you know discussions you might have with friends with family with people around how people are interpreting the world and the condition of the world and there's you know God is a universal God and and you don't have to believe that Jesus Christ is God God is just in the universe and you can live you can live your life because God is in you God is God is in you you can live any way you want this is the teaching that's out there that's why the world is in the mess that it's in and you've got families broken families like like never before in the history of time families are broken all over the Earth you've got all kinds of interpretations on genders and all these things that that it's all because they've left the word of God and the world has gone into an absolute chaos and you can talk with these people and they'll they've got psychology degrees they've got doctorates they're people that are wealthy and successful and and and very very popular and you know they could be movie stars there's all kinds of you know people that influence other people and if you're not careful you can easily be influenced by what they say because of the way that they've been successful here on this Earth Success is Not popularity success is not more money than you can burn success is not those things to have a hundred different relationships 15 different marriages and all kinds of uh that's not success that's death that's that's a World's condition that allows the people to live any way that they want and we've gotten to such a place that if you're not careful you're going to hear these things right in your own homes writing your own families amongst your you know your families because they've they've dropped the bar they've allowed the world's teachings and and Science and and the Doctorate Degrees and the psychologists to override the word of God I say the word of God is our absolute unless you hold the word of God as your absolute you will move into a level of deception you will be deceived you don't want to be deceived you don't want to be caught in this in a situation where everything is progressing in the word of God and you all of a sudden start to decide that you're going to take on the teachings of the world there's a lot of teachings that are good I'm not saying that it's all wrong but if it doesn't line up with the word of God then there's something wrong and it does not lead to life it does not lead to eternal life and so he says here uh um she that that what any denomination or anybody else says she's uniting herself she's getting ready why she is the bride she is the real truth uh the the church that's right and she's uniting herself with her bridegroom see and the bridegroom is the word see that's the thing that a lot of people don't realize what are you joining why are you assembling going to church so often why do you you know assemble yourself so often why do you feel that you need to go to church in order to to live a balanced life because we're uniting with the word and the only thing that's going to stand like he says here Heaven and Earth is going to pass nothing else is going to stand but the word of God so why not join with the word I mean Amen in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us now listen and the church and the bride and the word is becoming so one until the very word itself is working out the works of the bridegroom you're coming to a place where he is going to so possess your life because of your surrendering that you will see things happen in your life that you did not have to make an effort to make it happen all you did was you stayed true to the word you stayed loyal to your calling you continued to serve the Lord the best that you knew how amen glory to God you see it a uniting not no more join the church this is not about joining Church we're not trying to get members we're trying to seek out God's sons and daughters they're in that they're in the world they're in denominations they're in different churches but when the word is shined up upon their life and the word is spoken through your testimony or you talking to somebody and there's representation in them remember you didn't you didn't choose this I never chose this we didn't choose to be a part of this church God chose us God called us God supernaturally delivered us God took me out of drug addiction God took me out of the bondage of of of this world and and lust of this world and showed me real life amen and showed you real life you you're seeing at a uniting not join the church not no more this but flee from everything and tied to Jesus Christ see it's the uniting time God uniting his bride together bringing it back just exactly uniting the words of his promise second Thessalonians second chapter it says uh this fifth chapter says the saints that are asleep in the dust of the Earth will awaken and then we will Unite with them the living ones with the ones that's being dead will unite before we even get up there because the bride will be complete when she gets there everything that God needs to do in your personal life right now in order to prepare you for the rapture is going on that's why we're here this morning we're going to look at some things we're going to get you know into areas of Our Lives to see what our real motives are are we uniting with Christ or are we still United with the world she gets complete she's when she gets there the one that's living that's uniting themselves with the word and those that are gone already did that all the previous ages all the attributes of God all the sons of God that United under Luther Wesley the Pentecostal age brother branham's dispensation they've all received what they had need of in order to be perfected for their for their part in the word but we've got a different part we come under this dispensation now which is being being perfected by the Holy Spirit himself the mighty Angel perfecting Our Lives dealing with all the little imperfections not your your carnal imperfections it's your carnal thinking those imperfections are going to be on you but you're thinking your your your your faith has to be perfected it needs to become rapturing faith in order for you to be prepared for the Rapture amen glory to God the one that's living that's uniting themselves with the word and those that are gone already did that and it all comes together make one great Union of the uniting before going up there amen praise God hallelujah bless the Lord amen next slide Colossians we're talking about God's elect here it's only God's elect that are actually perfectly United with Christ perfect Unity cannot come unless you are an elected attribute of God hard thing to for a lot of people to take they said what do you mean God God elects yeah God elected from before the foundations of the world he's God he knew what was going to take place and he knew that you were going to choose him there's a lot of people that they've just decided I don't want Jesus I don't believe in God I am an atheist they'll tell you right to your face and there's nothing you can do about that because that's what they are you can't change them the Bible talks about the fact that we've got sons of God and we've got children of the world okay you can't change that so in Colossians 3 12 and 13 it says put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of mine meekness long-suffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another you wonder brother Danny why are you bringing these scriptures these are simple scriptures that we've all read there's people that have unforgiving hearts right here there's people that are dealing with things Scars From the Past Experiences from the past elements that they just don't want to let go of no matter how much they try it keeps the devil keeps coming back and throwing it in your face bringing up the past showing listen when God forgives he forgets our problem as human beings is that we have trouble forgetting we're we're stuck in this carnal realm where we keep replaying these these battles over and over and over in our minds and we find ourselves in a defeated condition God doesn't want to leave you that way God wants you to be liberated set free so that you can live a liberated life in Christ victorious in Christ have a have a happy you should be one of the happiest people in the world knowing that Christ has given you Eternal salvation that is something that's been revealed to you that you were always a son of God you were Justified before you made your mistakes God already Justified you he had the answer before the question Oh Glory to God that's one of the things that I remember when I came to the Lord and I had so many questions in my mind and all those questions were about my sin my unbelief the things that I that that had me chained they were chains of circumstance you know who held those chains it was my own carnal thinking that kept me under the bondage of those chains because I would believe the devil's lies it's time to to disbelieve the devil's lies it's time to be set free from those those chains of bondage so that you can live a Victorious Life Next slide Ephesians chapter 1 verses 4 to 5 according as he hath chosen us remember you didn't choose Christ this is not something that you did this is not oh I chose I decided to join Good Neighbor Ministries you didn't choose to join Good Neighbor Ministries if you're here it's because God invited you and sometimes people get invited and they don't last long because the word of God will disinvite them because if they can't stay with the word they get left behind and they automatically just dissipate away and all of this is part of the scripture this is the thing that you know we need to realize and understand we are compassionate we love one another I love each and every one of you I I you're you're the real family you're you're our real family okay we've got natural family and I love them dearly too okay but my faith in the word of God and and the spirit of God and the Holy Spirit in in our lives it's what really bonds us as true uh true family because it's Eternal yeah this Earth we're here for so many years and I will love and I will honor my mother and my father all the days of my life here on this Earth and I believe that God has a special place for them all those that I love all those that love me I I I believe that God is going to do something special in their lives but when they can't accept this word that we believe the reason why we assemble every Sunday the reason why we come together and we Fellowship you know and we we go to the park and people might see us there and you'll see African Jamaican Filipino Italian Portuguese like it's a full mix of people what is it that brings these people together that they can have such Unity it's Christ it's the Holy Ghost it's the power of God what he did listen nobody can tell me that God didn't use that man right there God had to use that man and nobody can tell me that it wasn't brother Desmond that God used to get to that man there and it's all God's plan it was all part of God's purpose I could not see the things that I see and believe the things that I believed and loved my brother Chris and love my brother Bill and love my brother I could not possibly do those things unless there was something deposited or or brought out of me to experience that kind of love this is what true unity in Christ produces so according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundations of the world it's hard to explain that to your to your friends and your family you know I was a Son of God before I came to this earth because the Bible says I was chosen before the foundations of this world I'm not telling you something that that I'm making up here I'm showing you by the word of God and then something resonates in me constantly over and over and over again that it's the truth because something keeps coming and whenever battle comes my way no matter what the devil throws at me no matter how hard he knocks me down something inside keeps getting me back up you've got that experience you're still walking with the Lord something keeps holding you something keeps bringing you back something keeps pressing you towards the mark of the High Calling which is in Christ Jesus that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love how can you be holy it's impossible it's the Holy Ghost In You that that expresses the Holiness of his spirit that's that's the Paradox Saints as long as we're in this Dimension and we're in this flesh you're going to see things on me that you know you're going to see The Human Side and then you're gonna see the god attribute from now from time to time that's the paradox that's the thing and we understand that and that's why we can still be in the world and not of the world understanding by Revelation that we were Sons and Daughters of God before we came here but we got to deal with the things here we gotta we still gotta work we still got to move with our friends and our neighbors we still got to project the love of God if God doesn't want them in your life God will remove them from your life amen you will make certain choices at times that will remove you from those situations because God is leading you don't worry God is doing this God is perfecting having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to his good pleasure and whose will was it your will oh I decide I'm going to go and join Good Neighbor Ministries I'm going to go there I'm going to be a deacon you got people like that you know they join the church I'm going to be this and I'm going to be that and before you know it I'm going to be looking for a new church because this is a supernatural body this is not just I'm gonna join Church we want to fill the house of the Lord we want to fill the house of the Lord everybody is welcome into this place everybody okay if God could call you in the condition that you were in while we were yet sinners ye what he died and he loved us amen and so nobody nobody is is discounted never nobody everybody is welcome into the house of the Lord the word will deal with them Sometimes they come in for one service and you never see them again sometimes they keep coming and all of a sudden you start to see things falling away from their lives things liberating them being set free that's what the house of the Lord is for that's why we need to assemble ourselves the more so now as that day approaches because it's perfecting time he's going to take out those little foxes that spoil the vine all those little things all those little imperfections amen Romans look at the next scripture Romans 8 30 moreover whom he did predestinate and this is beautiful I love this then he also called so when it's your time for God to call he's going to call you he chose I I asked him all the time Lord why did you wait 33 years so call me I because there was a lot of people that were that were like you know giving me the word of God saying hey Danny you need to read the Bible you need to come to my church for years that went on but no call there was no call there's a difference when God calls you you know the difference because not only does he call he visits he comes to your home he starts to deal with the circumstances he's still doing that amen he's still dealing with all those little circumstances in your life it's just that you've gotten hurt you've gotten hard in your in your condition you've gotten you know to a place where where you just you know you're you're getting impatient you you need to get that patience back you need to get you know where be still and know that I am God you need to come into those times because I'm telling you by experience I'm I'm I've been tested on being I'm being heavily tested and the only thing I can do is be still sometimes and just say Lord I know that you're God I know I I've got no words I've got no I've got no no no interpretation for this I can't put an interpretation on this and you're going to face those kinds of situations and the reason why is because he's perfecting you now understand that those things are coming for a reason you're being set free when you get to a place where you just don't know what to do you're at the weakest point you just don't know there's no answer coming to you you're just literally like like like stunned and you're sitting there and you're just waiting for the answer waiting for something to happen God will do it in his time he cannot leave you he cannot forsake you that's his promise it just it just so them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified so I don't care what you've done I don't care what sin you you've been carrying and what what kind of luggage you're still holding this morning I'm telling you you can be set free because he already set you free [Music] before you got into that condition he had an answer he had the answer he says you're Justified and if you look up Justified it means you never did it in the first place something possessed Your Vessel something possessed your lips you said things that you knew you shouldn't have said don't worry you're Justified if you need to make it right with that person whoever it was you need to you know get set free from that because in the flesh we still deal with this human emotion we still gotta look at one another we still got to pass one another we still got to have those experiences with one another and and it's hard sometimes this this nature of the Flesh and all the scars of the past and generational spirits and things that that our parents put upon us our friends put Upon Us bad emotional experiences put upon you and you are judging your life through those experiences no more no more today you can be justified as though you never did it in the first place and all you've got to do is accept it receive it and believe it and walk with God and whom he justified them he also will bring in the rapture and we'll glorify you and we'll change you in a moment in the twinkling of an eye it's not going to be something that you're going to need to do amen praise God next slide listen this is our time this is our time I said I said when I was listening to brother Brown he says uniting time and sign I said Lord there's a sign for the Sons and Daughters of God there's a time and a sign and a season for all things everything works in God's time and season brother Philip we don't have to worry that you know that lawn situation there was a time and a season for you to deal with that you've been living there for a few years but God knew the time in the season and when God does something he does it right and that's how we got to believe that when God is going to heal that situation in your life when God is going to amend you when God is going to restore you he doesn't half-heartedly do it he does it it's done hallelujah it's blue it's done so you know when when we look at the word Unity just leave that slide there for now we're going to just talk for we're going to look at a few things when we look at the word UNIF Unity it's defined as a common goal a common denominator do we have a common denominator this morning hallelujah oh I'll send you the comforter which is the Holy Ghost and he will guide you and lead you into all truth how can the Holy Ghost In You bring you to Jehovah Witness when the Holy Ghost In Me is bringing me to the word you see it cannot be the holy spirit is one Jesus we read the scripture Lord they are thine and and they are mine as they are mine and you are mine and we are one as they are one and we are all one it's the body of Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost there is no possible way listen I know this sounds simple but you got to get it and keep it straight in your mind the Holy Ghost that's in you that's awakened in you cannot sin it cannot disbelieve the word of God it can't go against the word so the moment I say to somebody you got the Holy Ghost they go yeah oh yeah I got the holy ghost man I had a such a sensation I said praise God how are you baptized I was baptized in a tank I said how oh in the name of the Trinity the name of the father and the Son and the Holy Ghost I said that's not scriptural the Holy Ghost would never do that the holy spirit is not a trinity the holy spirit is God it's the power it's the anointing it's the presence of God Amen it's not three in one it's all one Jesus coming to the Earth was the word made flesh in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God so if we know that the Word was God then then then there's no two different gods or three different gods and Jesus when he's talking about the harmony between him and the father he's talking about Harmony between him on Earth as a human being being expressed the word made flesh with the will of the Father which was him in his one Almighty Elohim existence self-existent one all he did was Project himself and so he projected now into you his spirit and there's got to be Unity by that one common denominator the minute that there's two different teachings it separates how can two walk together lest they agree and the biggest denominator for us is the Holy Ghost I remember when I came to this Revelation and I went to Pastor Simon I said I want to be baptized he says that's I said I I want I want to receive the Holy Ghost I want to receive the Holy Ghost because I realized that was the power of God that was the thing that that that that you know would would be like the supernatural element in my life that's how I believed it he looked he says brother you got the Holy Ghost I do he says yeah he says you got the Holy Ghost but you're you're expressing it now by by like the scripture says you're being baptized because it's an outward expression of something that you've come to realize within you and so this common denominator can never ever be compromised it can't there's no compromising on the Holy Ghost amen it's Oneness of mind there's a Harmony when the Holy Ghost is in the midst of your fellowship there's a Harmony there there's a Harmony what happens sometimes we get into fellowship and and you know we start to put our own interpretations on things and if our own interpretation doesn't exactly sound the same way as the other individual that's speaking we gotta immediately make sure that our interpretation is made clear and it's this is it take it or leave it that's not the Holy Ghost when that kind of attitude comes in I'm not talking about listen when I say common denominator and you and you know that you got the Holy Ghost you will also know when somebody denies the word they're not awake yet they're either not awake yet or they'll never have it it's as simple as that you can't change that you can't alter that that's God's choosing I chose you from before the foundation I didn't chew Jesus himself said to his disciples when they came to him says Lord how come they're leaving why are they leaving he says he looked at them he says unto you it's been given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom but unto them it has not been given you can't change that you can't alter that so don't try and make somebody something that they're not when True Fellowship and understanding of the unity of being perfectly United with Christ allows you to sit in the midst of it and be still and allow that person even if they're wrong they should still feel a love coming from you they should still feel that that that there's that there's something in you that that desires good for them amen that's you know like we need to check ourselves sometimes pride is a terrible thing wants to make us be the the absolute our our interpretation is the way it is no other way no God is his own interpreter God will make it plain God can open their eyes God can do whatever he needs to do and if God needs to remove them from your life he'll remove them you don't need to get into that huff and that puff and that and that that battle that comes with this carnal Realm because it's tough those bottles are hard we want to be set free from all of that that's what that's what we're we're looking at this morning amen it's it's Oneness of mind there's a Harmony there's an agreement there's a teamwork there's an edification because the purpose and the plan is all about God's purpose all God's plan God's will we know what the scripture says it's it's the totality of combining all parts into one whole God is calling in those last few he's bringing them into the body how he does it that's what makes him God that's what makes him so great and in unity there is an absence of division there's an absence of varied thinking there's an uh there's no there let us reason the Bible says let us reason together right let's let's let's come together in a way that when we Fellowship we reason with one another and we we show the love of God and and and and and put on patience and put on those things that that God because listen this is the time where we're getting perfected and if you're coming into this church and you're assembling yourself is because you want to be set free from those things that are holding you back am I right I mean I mean is that not the purpose in US joining and and why like why do we go to church there's reasons why we go to church and one of the reasons is to celebrate God's love you're celebrating the fact that God loves you and God loves me and has brought us together in in this Unity that that that brings Harmony that brings strength you know two together can cast out ten thousand imagine what a group together that that have the same understanding and the same revelation of unity in Christ what can be achieved in that body we come to thank the Lord for life and life's blessings I mean these are simple things but you know what God is blessing us God is blessing you God is keeping you God Is providing your needs and when we come together we come to give thanks for the blessings that God pours out upon our lives and we give thanks for one another amen we come to feed on the word of God so that the word sets us free the word liberates us we come to worship God in spirit and in truth okay we're not here just to you know oh they're good song Services they're more than just good song Services their preparation to get us into the presence of the Lord to get us into Heavenly places where I can be set free from a disease that's trying to take my life from a heartache that's trying to break my family from a a broken relationship from a from a financial disaster that might be taking place for whatever it is you've come because you know that the supernatural can happen you believe in it you believe that God can do those things in your life you believe that either you believe it or you don't I won't like why would you be here I'm here because I need the Holy Spirit to help me perfect and get through this time in my life and the situations that I'm dealing with we all have them regardless Hallelujah to fellowship with your family in Christ that's why we come and we come to minister our gifts one to another I love a great gift of sin it blesses it edifies it encourages when that singer is singing by Revelation and in their heart they've had an experience it comes through by the spirit and it meets the needs of the people I love that gift of edification when I need to be edified some brothers they can edify some brothers they can discern it's all part of the it's all part of the body of Christ all for a purpose so that we together can be set free and liberated in Christ all for that one purpose everyone needs to have a home Church listen to the prophet he says every man ought to have a church home you ought to have a place not just to float around from Pillar To Post a lot of people they're going to this church because they don't like the way the pastor talks about Tides too much and then they'll go to this church because they like to worship and then they might go to this church because you know they don't like a certain brother or sister you know the one that's often talking about the problems is the problem even you ought to have a place not just to float around from Pillar To Post but have somewhere that you go to church and you call it your church that's my church that's my family that's my that's my ministry that's where God has placed me it's a supernatural church every Sunday the spirit of God comes and anoints the ministry and I get fed I get encouraged I get edified I get delivered from the sin that that so easily tries to pull me here and pull me there I get set free and then when I'm free I'm free indeed I'm free like it never happened in the first place I've got a revelation of justification I don't go out there and try to sin so that I can come to service on Sunday so I can be set free that's not the way it works we don't take Grace and make it a disgrace but I also know that you as a human being have flaws I got flaws we all got flaws we're all going to make mistakes we're all going to say things that we don't want to say we're all going to do things that we wish we never done Paul said oh Wretched Man that I am my God he says the things that I should do I don't do the things that I shouldn't do I do what is it it's this flesh it fights us every single day but then he said but thanks be to Jesus Christ thanks be to God the holy spirit that keeps coming back over and over and over again Hallelujah we should have somewhere that you go to church and you call it your church somewhere you pay your tithe and somewhere that you help support the cause amen glory to God hallelujah take your choice but then don't never disfellowship the other man because he don't belong with your group you see there's there's the balance you know what I mean just because they don't come to your church that don't mean that you disfellowship them no listen what he says see discern his spirit and see if he's got the same purpose in heart then you've got Fellowship one with another you're working for one great cause that's the cause of Christ I think that that is absolutely true amen a real born-again man or woman that's got discernment of the Holy Ghost will find his place in church worshiping crying out and doing all that is in his life to try and bring Sinners to Christ living that life allowing the spirit of God to move and deal with your life to to to change you like listen we need to be changed we need to have more compassion for for others we need that we've got to be careful of this bride Pride this this this you know I've got a revelation if they don't got the Revelation they're going to hell no what is that you you don't know who's going to hell and you don't know who's going to heaven all you know is that you're serving God by the grace of God and you keep getting into trouble and he keeps getting you out that's what you're that's what you're grateful for you've you've you now belong to Something Real you belong to a real Church body something that strengthens you when you come into the house of the Lord you should be leaving the house of the Lord strengthened encouraged you should feel encouraged by your brothers and your sisters you should feel the love of God you should feel that that you're appreciated and then you should be showing appreciation one for the other this is what's going to bring that perfect love this is what's going to cap us off so that we can be complete in Christ Jesus Hallelujah I'd rather you belong listen to brother Brown he says I'd rather you belong to a church and be a sinner than to not go to church at all right so don't be afraid about bringing your friends to church okay if they don't if they don't want to be here that's fine then let them go but invite them don't be afraid don't you know tell them listen you don't want to go to church that's okay brother Gabe he called me I don't know how many times you want to go to church I got no time for church I said well how often you go he goes Tuesday Thursday Sunday I said what he says I can pick you up any one of those days but what was that it was God's time it was God's choosing it was God's it didn't matter God says don't worry just get him there something was on him to get me there why now we know it's all we can do but we believe that God knew because when I was there I didn't want to be there the first few I was wondering what in the world am I doing here but God had a purpose God had a plan and God still does that don't underestimate anybody there's nothing too hard for the Lord I look at situations and I see certain situations and I tell them well I'm going to pray for you I'm going to pray about that situation in your life oh really I go yeah I'm a minister I believe in the power of prayer really yeah I said I'm the evidence of the power of prayer somebody was praying for me at some point and I got delivered and I believe it I know it it's the truth and I believe you can do the same for you if you'll just accept it he says thank you thank you pray for me okay but when they turn around they say I don't need prayer you say that's fine God bless you anyway what can I say this is this is this is not something you chose I'd rather you belong to church and be a sinner than not go to church at all you're doing well with that what you're doing but now why not come and be a real Christian why not get that real love of God in your heart oh boy let me tell you when that love of God pierces your heart you can never be the same you'll never be the same you'll never look at anybody the same way oh you'll you'll get upset with the devil oh yeah you'll get upset with the devil I get upset with the devil all the time he's taking shots all the time he's taking him on you all the time that's his job I tell my wife every day you know she'll call me and say oh this is going on this is going honestly yup that old Devil's up to his work he punched in this morning he's doing his job but I said but you make sure you're doing yours when you need to pray you get down and pray when you need to bind those Spirits I said let's pray right now when we're right while we're on the phone I said let's bind that thing right now two hours later it was like it never happened because God is God God can still deliver God can still deal with those situations in your life don't you accept those things when when those things come around speak the word no matter how weak you might feel all you do just go say Lord I believe your word and in the name of Jesus Christ I bind this enemy right now it's trying to take my mind it's trying to remember the greatest battle is right here eh that still has not changed you will fight this battle every single day of your life until you leave here but understand that there are two sides to the coin and if you're listening to that Devil he's going to have you down and out but if you listen to the promises of God's word you'll keep getting back up again it'll just happen you'll just keep getting back up again I don't know there's many rise up and go out and say oh I don't need to go to church anymore praise God the Holy Ghost has come he's the teacher when you get that idea you're just wrong when you think that you don't you've been going to church long enough and now you don't need to go to church you're wrong you need to go to church you need to be a part of the mystical body of Jesus Christ you need to receive the supernatural spirit that comes out of this Pulpit every Sunday every Wednesday you need to be a part of The Prayer Ministry you need to have those balances in your life because those are the things that you get victory over that's how the victory comes you wonder wow you know like this situation looked really bad and all of a sudden somebody made a way out the Lord made a way the Lord moves in mysterious ways because you've been praying because you're there on those Friday nights and you're praying about those situations and you're down on your knees and you're praying every day and every morning God hears all those things God hears your heart God knows your desires God knows the pain that you're going through when you go to him with a sincere and broken contrite heart sometimes you're broken when you're at the weakest Point remember he's the strong element in your life praise God the Holy Ghost has come he's the teacher when you get that idea you're just wrong for why did the Holy Ghost set teachers in the church if he was going to be the teacher see there are first apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors and the Holy Spirit set teachers in the church so he could teach through that teacher what is church it's a place of refreshing and rest it's a place where you can get liberated you can be set free it's a place of healing and forgiveness these are simple things but I want to remind you this morning that these are all available to you you can be forgiven you can be healed you can be restored this morning and you can go out and be victorious for the rest of the week it's a place of restoration it's a place of Celebration we celebrate the grace of God in our lives we celebrate the victories we celebrate the victory reports when when one of our brothers or sisters are Weeping we weep with them when they when they Rejoice we Rejoice with them that's what unity in Christ brings us together it's a revelation of who we really are and once we really know who we are there's no this one's better than that one or this one's better or he's better than me or she's better than me it goes beyond all of that that's all things of this world we don't operate by that Hallelujah glory to God you can't stay home and and and and not and get strengthened you can't stay home and do that you need to be a part of the body you need to assemble you need to come together you need to be more and more one with Christ and your brothers and your sisters why because we need one another more than we ever did need each other it's right now that we need one another especially right now what we're going through in our ministry the transition that's taking place right now in the ministry God is doing something it's it we're all kind of just in in expectation we're all just waiting on the Lord to vindicate his plan his purpose his will so that this program so that his will can can continue and so that our lives can move on God doesn't listen God isn't the author of confusion you got nothing to fear God is going to take absolute control of the whole situation and everything that you have need of God is still going to provide it he's going to do everything that he needs to do in order to place perfect mold and shape and and prepare all that needs to be prepared in the leadership of this church I have no doubt in my mind I have no fear about it there's no fear attached to this because he's always been the leader of the church when did he change when did Christ change being the leader of this church he's still the leader of the church he's still going to feed you he's still going to speak to your needs he's still going to heal you he's still going to deliver you he's still going to prepare you for the Rapture he's going to give you rapturing Faith regardless of your condition he's going to set you free liberate you and prepare you for a great work because even though we go in the rapture we got to come back here for another Thousand Years so he's doing a lot to prepare and get us ready Hallelujah when you get yourself singled out from the rest of them making yourself just a little different you don't want to associate with them because they believe this and they don't want to associate with that you're getting on Dangerous Ground right then keeping away from church find the one find the one of your choice and remain there and be a Christian brother to all of them be a Christian sister to all of them that's the way a real Christian then we've got Fellowship protection people love you and pray for you you know that this is your place of Refuge you know the scripture said he's a mighty tower that you can run into the righteous run into it you know that he's a shelter in in the time of storm and when you when when you decide that you don't need that shelter anymore you're gonna you're gonna face some storms and I I don't want to face the storms alone I already know I'm going to face storms so I but I don't want to face them alone I don't want to go out there and and and and make myself you know put myself to the side because I disagree with this or I disagree with that I agree with the word of God I agree that the word of God can deal with whatever it is that he needs to deal with it's his body it's not my body I'm a part of that body I'm in there to be strengthened to be edified to be healed to be restored and to be a blessing to my brothers and sisters that's that's my purpose that's my goal that's why God has placed me into the body of Christ Hallelujah Christianity is not a competition it's teamwork amen we encourage we don't discourage if you got something that you want to say to your brother or your sister if they're innocent look for something that will encourage them out of that discouragement don't add to the discouragement we edify we don't crucify glory to God we gotta watch we gotta watch how we talk about one another how we talk about our brothers and sisters Even in our discussions that we're having any discussions that you might be having about your deacons or your trustees or your pastor or whatever it is you've got to be careful you've got to be careful you you're treading in areas because those are God's anointed positions in the body of Christ we need to be very mindful of those things and be fearful of the Lord when it comes to those areas because God is a jealous God is going to protect his word over everything else god listen God's looking at the pureness of your heart blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God you will see God when you repent and you sincerely don't want to have any malice in you you don't want to have anything in you that's going to bring any kind of division in the body of Christ in any way shape or form God is looking at that and when God sees that he's going to use you he's going to make you a healing bomb in the midst of the fellowship he's going to make you a healing in the midst of the church he's gonna he's gonna cause you to be a blessing in the Church of God Amen praise God we pull each other up not pull each other down amen praise God why because we are family we are one body in Jesus Christ First Corinthians go to the next slide 12 21. let me have a quick drink we're winding it down and the eye cannot say unto the hand I have no need of Thee nor again the head to the feet I have no need of you I need you you need me we need one another we need to acknowledge that we need to say it I need you I need you you need me we are the body of Christ we've come together for a purpose we're in unity we want we we've got the same goal in mind we're going into Rapture the purpose we come together is to receive rapturing Faith so that we can fulfill that portion of the word that's the next big event Saints the world goes into tribulation but we get translated into that other dimension even science is already starting to poke into those other dimensions they realize that their realities that they're that it's real they're they're playing with with all the Witchcraft and they're and they're they're seeing it that's why they're justifying and saying that we know what's going on we understand that there are other dimensions we know all these things astrology all those things they they've they've tapped into those things but they are all part of God's plan it's all part of God's purpose his his design everything comes under subjection to the plan of God gravity is a part of God's plan here on this Earth there are certain elements and boundaries that this Earth is bound by and people are tapping into those things but they are making their understanding the absolute instead of allowing the word of God to be the absolute Hallelujah we need one another next slide it says you know we should not be clannished we got to be careful of that because clanish is is not by revelation we got to be careful of our of our understanding and and and how the body works and edifies itself you edify me I edify you you have a position in the word you have a placing in the body you you you you you're an usher in the Church of God do it with faith you're a deacon do it with faith you're a trustee do it by Revelation you're a cleaner do it by you're a singer do it by Revelation when you're doing those things and you're operating by faith it just automatically edifies the body of Christ you look at brother Eugene when he's vacuuming you get strengthened from that because you know that there's somebody there that's doing it by faith when you see these things happening around you you get edified you get encouraged because the body is working now now this I say that every one of you saith I am of Paul and I have Apollos and I have cephas and I have Christ is Christ divided was Paul crucified for you you see you got to be careful that you're not putting people in certain positions and relying on the people instead of relying the Holy Ghost in that person in that position it's going to have to be the spirit of God in each and every position in every office in the body of Christ in order for this body this local Ministry to continue to grow and to continue to strengthen and be a lighthouse in this city of Burlington amen we're not looking to a man we're looking still to the supernatural spirit of God to direct to guide and to lead this church amen and John answered and said Master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and we forbade him because he followed not with us and Jesus said unto him forbid him not for he that is not against us is for us so there's the other side of the coin you don't have to be worried about being clannished you don't have to be worried about people that are going to do certain things and be Christian in in the best possible way that they can everybody's got to live by faith everybody's got their own Revelation and there's no way you can live higher than the Revelation that God gives you amen Hallelujah glory to God we need to be good to one another try to be good to one another try to shake hands and be friendly and nice simple things tear down all the walls of partition around you that's malice and different ungodly tear it down keep doing good to one another every time you meet one another make yourself be good to one another and the first thing you know it'll grow around you till the bundle of love will wrap you up Hallelujah that's the marking of God let the musicians come we're going to continue this I trust that there were some things this morning that just brought us back to reality just bringing us back to reality of of Why We Are Who We Are why we are a part of this ministry we're not trying to make anybody anything that they're not don't you try to be anybody that you're not just be yourself let grace abound in you let Grace be expressed through your life overcome the things that constantly try to make you different indifferent try to pull you away try to separate you take you off and put you on your own and think that you can do it on your own no we need one another we absolutely need each other if there was ever a time this is the time let us pray father this is a reality Lord we did not choose you chose you called you Justified you started to work and there's many here this morning Lord including myself that still needs a lot of work but we realize it and we're asking you to take control and do that work Lord put more compassion in our hearts for one another Lord let that agape love become so real that we can look at our enemy and still love them they choose to be our enemy we choose not to be theirs we choose to allow your grace to be extended in whatever circumstance and the situations that we're dealing with each and every day Lord we got to go to work we gotta we gotta meet with our families we've got to deal with the financial burdens and and sickness in our lives and our friends and our families but Lord we're going with a with an understanding that you are God and that you are able and that you you don't change Lord if we stand upon your word and we believe and we just keep moving in the name of Jesus Christ and we pray for one another and we believe we will see Miracles take place in our lives it's as simple as that Lord we don't want to make this any bigger or any some Supernatural understanding we want to keep this simple you are God you're the Lord God that healeth all of our diseases you're the Lord God that meets all of our needs you said I will never leave you I will never forsake you and that we will hold and keep and so father we place each and every single individual here and on the Airways this morning may your power Lord may this word be Vindicated in their lives in some way may they experience something Lord that will confirm
