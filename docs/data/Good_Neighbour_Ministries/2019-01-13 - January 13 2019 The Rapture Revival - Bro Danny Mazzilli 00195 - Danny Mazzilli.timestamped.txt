[3:50] the air on the bride
[3:53] [Music]
[4:01] [Music]
[4:21] is addressed we too have to merely pray
[4:25] for me Bibles forgetting that it is for
[4:28] us to stir into play as a city or you
[5:00] know that each and every one of us
[5:02] there's a theory
[5:05] but yes you know that God put out there
[5:08] please God being different for a purpose
[5:12] there is not one of us Isis that's I
[5:16] think that's the same not one of you God
[5:20] had a purpose for that that's why each
[5:22] and every one of us in the body has the
[5:25] purpose
[5:26] none of us to sing into it I hope you
[5:34] catch
[5:47] his prosperity if it's mine
[7:04] [Music]
[8:08] [Music]
[8:26] positionally placing sons and daughters
[8:29] of God holy is now setting in all the
[8:47] [Music]
[9:00] [Music]
[9:11] [Music]
[9:39] [Music]
[9:58] [Applause]
[10:01] [Music]
[10:10] [Music]
[10:43] [Music]
[11:09] [Music]
[11:29] [Music]
[11:45] [Music]
[12:00] [Music]
[12:30] you said Jesus Christ my life but you
[12:33] never receive the Holy Ghost coming it's
[12:38] never too late you'll know you will know
[12:42] that you will know if you have the name
[12:46] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[12:49] the scripture says repent and be
[12:52] baptized repent not proceeding to repent
[12:56] repent means they turn away from what
[12:59] you thought was the truth just break it
[13:04] up
[13:27] [Music]
[13:36] [Music]
[13:46] [Music]
[13:59] she's not the same you need to be
[14:03] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[14:06] Christ because he is the core of the
[14:10] church the hospital gives his name to
[14:14] the bride and a bride that refuses to
[14:16] take her husband's name is not really
[14:19] truly married in her hospital she's
[14:21] staying independent
[14:23] [Music]
[14:25] yeah cyclically and that the Bible says
[14:35] in acts 2:38 you shall receive the gift
[14:39] of Jesus ascension which is the Holy
[14:50] Ghost into all truth
[15:00] you see how simple it is now once you
[15:04] come God provided with a complicated
[15:07] Network
[15:08] [Music]
[15:10] it just shows that there's an attribute
[15:12] that responds to was written in the
[15:16] Lamb's Book of Life the reason why you
[15:18] know your names right there's because
[15:20] you're here
[15:39] [Music]
[15:58] [Music]
[16:16] this is the book of Ephesians in this
[16:29] position you put back and beat the book
[16:32] of Joshua we'll see everything in the
[16:34] book of Ephesians
[16:36] positionally placing the body of Christ
[16:39] into their land giving them their
[16:41] portion of land Joshua he told them you
[16:43] take this part you take that part is
[16:45] because of his positioning and then
[16:47] there was perfecting this position
[16:54] because in craftiness
[17:14] even Christ seems I will see her there
[17:17] you don't want to get caught up in all
[17:19] these cutting practice they've got all
[17:25] these things in Egyptian pyramids and
[17:28] balsam cities across people are missing
[17:32] the extraterrestrials all that stuff
[17:34] it's got nothing to do with you and you
[17:39] were not back there you want to look at
[17:42] the history look into his name and find
[17:47] yourself next slide now what that Sun
[17:56] was placed position into the penalty he
[18:00] was joint-heir he was Detroit air to go
[18:04] back by the Sun because back to do is
[18:07] the father would give the subtler tool
[18:10] and we'll place that Sun under that
[18:13] Twitter and that Pluto would have to
[18:15] come back and let the the master know
[18:17] what the Sun is doing and how has
[18:19] happened and how is living if he's out
[18:21] there the women every night full of
[18:23] money that that that's waken if he's out
[18:26] there or what he's doing he wants to
[18:27] know this son has the right character to
[18:31] take his position as a joint heir in the
[18:35] kingdom and so he was just as much an
[18:39] authority
[18:43] because in the into the church in the oh
[19:48] this is going to preach that that can't
[19:50] I gotta pee
[19:52] oh it's only brother soldiers
[20:03] that's currently especially is next
[20:22] [Music]
[20:33] [Music]
[20:48] in the comes into the church
[20:56] [Music]
[21:20] [Music]
[21:32] [Music]
[21:43] [Music]
[21:45] adopted into the family of God
[21:49] [Music]
[22:07] Thanks
[22:12] if the programs not also relatively
[22:17] small
[22:24] they're all sponsors
[22:35] is that it
[22:39] Oh
[22:46] next one
[22:55] we've got a ministry company that's just
[22:58] exactly like the lion Christ
[23:01] what does that this verifies the when
[23:07] this ministry comes into its fullness
[23:09] because the price is fully processing
[23:12] and the people are say oh he's coming
[23:30] [Music]
[23:36] because we place in the headship the
[23:45] body's perfect
[23:47] [Music]
[23:51] that's the oh that's the that's that's
[23:56] the actual return of Christ
[23:59] but he's the body of creation is waiting
[24:18] for the church to positionally find its
[24:21] place Oh would the weak yourself know
[24:32] when they'll stop secrets
[24:34] cancer bill some disease that's what
[24:37] we're striving for now to get in and be
[24:39] position we placed into the kingdom of
[24:42] God before these horrible plagues
[24:46] because the tribulation is coming in the
[25:15] Perkin urban interchange brother proud
[25:30] he says in these last days the true
[25:35] bride church christ seed will come to
[25:39] the headstone and she will be the super
[25:42] church a super race as she nears him
[25:49] they the bride will be so much like air
[25:52] that they look even be in his very image
[25:56] we are taking on the image of christ
[26:01] having the same abilities have the same
[26:06] unworthy though underestimate what
[26:10] you've heard the testimonies if you
[26:12] really missed if you miss Wednesday
[26:14] night service
[26:14] you missed a fantastic wonderful service
[26:17] because Desmond Ron you need to listen
[26:20] to that he brought some testimonies of
[26:22] how God is moving in his life through
[26:26] the supernatural healing of people and
[26:29] individuals that he's come into contact
[26:32] with
[26:32] you see each and every one of us all
[26:34] have different parts of the body of
[26:37] President
[26:38] remember and when you come to recognize
[26:41] what your position is I'm happy I'm
[26:46] always happy I got the joy in the Lord I
[26:49] feel I used to do it God that is his
[26:53] right do you know that God placed that
[26:56] in there because what people see him
[26:59] when people come into his presence and
[27:01] he's got that revelation with God all
[27:04] things are possible
[27:05] places having other people he tells them
[27:08] I believe God can you in the name of
[27:10] Jesus people come people and that people
[27:24] get back you see we all have a part of
[27:29] this ministry each one of us has
[27:34] something we need to allow Holy Spirit
[27:38] to use just that but you're not I've
[27:59] seen how it all fits together because we
[28:02] are all in a certain position we all
[28:05] have to operate as God has given us baby
[28:08] operated our positions and not the
[28:11] swapper to do asks us to do
[28:18] in this bowl
[28:25] or the rather speakin in the message to
[28:27] super Simon said he came to be the seal
[28:30] Abraham that he might show a super race
[28:34] now Abraham had a seed naturally not
[28:40] super see does full of supers to
[28:46] remember and Abraham had superseded in
[28:50] Jesus came that he might redeem the
[28:53] super seed of paper has raised you see
[28:57] how Abraham see if you've got the faith
[28:59] of Abraham and you are Abraham's seed
[29:03] then you are part of that super race you
[29:06] are part of that that that I've
[29:08] collected son and daughter God that God
[29:11] needs to positionally place in this
[29:13] thing at this hour so that you can fill
[29:16] your part in God super race the
[29:19] superseded Arab race but is sure to do
[29:22] it race with supernatural sides of a
[29:26] supernatural sons and daughters of God
