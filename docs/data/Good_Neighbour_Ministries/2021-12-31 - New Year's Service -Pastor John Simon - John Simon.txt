we plan things in our lives and we the way we want it to go we have it mapped up in our minds but sometimes that's not the way god wants it to go i plan to go to the states to be a witness to my family my sister no children and i have been waiting for them to sit around the table and then tell them give them the word of god and tell them about being born again and talking to them about the lord jesus you see we all grew up as catholic and my sister is very dedicated and so was i i was a very dedicated one but to every time somebody's home somebody's not home i waited i couldn't get the group around a table and i said lord don't let me have to go back and i don't get to talk to them so i've been waiting and waiting anyway the day came for my sister to celebrate her 80th birthday and um at the hall there was about 50 people so they asked me to bless the table and i did and after i gave a tribute to my sister and i started off by telling her that i love her and i love each one that's gathered here tonight to celebrate with her and telling her out of 11 children six girls five boys i'm the third girl and the fifth child but my sister was the first so i'm letting her know leaving home it was pounded into us you were born a catholic you're going to die a catholic so while i was doing the the tribute to my sister i started telling them of my testimony i said anyone anyone wants to hear how god got a hold of me i said i was in my dying bed and he reached down and got me i said i love you all daily and most of them was catholic in that hall i said but we must be born again i said we must repent and turn to the lord that says as a baby we cannot repent a baby can has nothing to repent to and i said i'm telling you all this you may be mad with me but because i love you all and i love my sister and family so i'm telling you all today i was amazed the room was so still and quiet no music no talking and i kept on talking i said anyone wants to hear my testimony of how i was in a dying bed in the hospital and god got hold of me i'll let you know but i thought i was good and i'm on my way to heaven but i was on my way to hell because where i was and

somebody somewhere and may the lord bless her and use her for the glory [Music] [Music] so god bless you saints nervous that's me tonight anyways uh so i guess a lot falls on me tonight when i was asked to do this i said to myself oh no not sure if i want to say yes but then these words came to me we overcome our enemy by the blood of the lamb and the word of our testimony and here i am tonight my friends amen i stand here tonight by the grace of god so i give him all the honor the glory and the praise thank you for those who do not know me i am farida fallon i was born in trinidad to a muslim family muslim ancestors we are seven siblings i'm the middle child i worked in the trinidad government service for 12 years with the ministry of health and with the ministry of education as a registered teacher prior to migrating to canada i thought i would pursue teaching but i ended up in banking the royal bank and i'm still there for 25 years so from teaching to banking but i believe god had been there for a reason and a purpose so that's me in a nutshell now for my most important part of my life my spiritual conversion and work in christ all started through the great influence of my mom my dad was a wealthy well-known businessman but you know the three things that brother branham spoke about money women and popularity well that was my dad so for my mom it was during these difficult times of trials and tribulation she was introduced to the lord and to the message of the hour it was only then she found peace and a purpose in life so i was exposed to the message at a ten day age of nine she would take us to church and would be and and she would open her home for ministers and ministers like brother finn and others would be preaching at our home even then i did not accept the lord i would sometimes go to parties and disco in those days and wanted to experience the life out there thinking that the christian thing is for old people not me i was still young and i still can enjoy life and i was saying to myself when i get older maybe later on in life i will accept the lord in my head i know i would preserve myself as a lady that's what that was me and that was my mentality then one day coming home from work on the highway a vehicle suddenly ran off the road on the other side coming towards our vehicle it spun around it hit another vehicle and it was coming towards us the other occupants in the vehicle were screaming i shouted my lord oh my this is it i'm done the vehicle stopped right in front of me without hitting us everything happened so quickly that in a matter of seconds i could have been gone my life was spared this really shook me up it jolted me god spared my life it was a wednesday when i got home i told my mom i am going to church with you tonight this time she didn't have to force me to go that night i stood up and i gave my first ever testimony of how god saved my life of how he saved me from this serious accident i said god i could have died not knowing where i would have ended up in heaven or in hell i told the church it was a scary thought yes my mom has been praying for her children day and night and pleading the blood over us but my work was not one to warrant going to heaven i said no more parties no more waiting until i get old this thing is real i know now i have to make a change in life i had to surrender or my all to him to the one who died for me i call this a spiritual awakening for me i looked over the pews and i saw my mom sitting there in tears her prayers were answered so my brother who is now a minister an assistant to brother greene and i we both got baptized on the same day on 14th of july 1985. my spiritual birthday my new booth this was the best thing that ever happened to me the best decision i have ever made my this for wanting to know more of god and reading the prophet's messages grew and have truly found my first love going to church now both for my brother and i without being forced and it was more for joy than a burden praise the lord a couple of months later a gentleman in the church approached me and asked my mom for my hand in marriage this is what my mom said reply she's of age she can speak for herself i of course was taken by surprise and thought i could not say yes until i know for sure this is what god wants for me now i have a serious decision an important one to make so i took three days off from work and i fasted and prayed and spent the time praying and asking the lord i said god i was not looking for this right now i do not know the answer you know everything you know my future i want your perfect will in my life and i was really honest to the lord i said lord please show me before the third day i got the confirmation from the lord i said yes my mom was very happy because she would be telling us about being unequally yoked about the pains of marriage when spouses are not spiritually on the same field and she was so happy to know that it was someone with the same belief the message and so within six months we got engaged we got married the lord blessed us with tree precious gem candace sarah and ariel i thought to myself i could have said yes to unbelievers who would have which definitely would have been outside the perfect will of god and face the consequences but thank god for his guidance and leadership to reap the benefits of marrying a believer as a result amen i had to write this because i know nervousness will take over sorry yes we had our struggles and we were faced with challenges along the way but god was first and foremost in my life and when and we would gather together as a family with our three children and call upon his name we know with full assurance he will see us through praise the lord we fellowship that brother nelson and for a couple of years and then later move on to brother john dankwa we were quite active in the church hosting ministers and unbelievers and so forth enjoying fellowship with our family and the family of god alan being a deacon and a sunday school superintendent and my being a sunday school teacher to the youth was a great joy quite often we would be the last ones to leave the compound and uh alan having to take care of the things in the kingdom of god sometimes our kids would be tired and hungry and i remember him saying to the children kids we have to take care of the things that pertain to god and it's only what you do for god will last and they would say yes daddy so my life during this time was based on the things of god growing up our children and the fear and admonition of the lord training them and doing the best we can as parents first spiritually and next given them their education to equip them financially my life was more or less maintained in a balance with church wife mother and work with god being the leader and center of our life then the breaking point came it was on the 31st of july 2012. i got up as usual everything seemed fine the girls were off to universities so my but they were off on vacation so alan took a week off with them before i left home to go to work i just kissed goodbye and alan said darling when you get home we will take a walk well little did i know the walk never came later that day at work i received a call my manager drove me to the hospital and when i arrived there i saw sarah and her dad and i knew right away it was serious i got two minutes with him and they whisked him away that was it he died um of a brain aneurysm no signs nothing the news pissed my heart felt total devastation sarah was with me all broken up and crying and i said say don't cry baby all is well god is in total control my two girls candace and uriel were brought to the hospital and they too were broken up they were around the dad weeping i can hear them say daddy no don't go daddy you can't go don't leave us i'm too young to be without a daddy i could hear them saying come back daddy please don't go daddy hard as it may seem painful as it was crying out i knew i had to be there for the girls for a moment i told my life was shattered i said no god this cannot be real i said god no you cannot take my husband away from me you cannot take my best friend my companion for 25 years lord god you cannot take my children's father then i heard a voice said to me be still i know that i am god then suddenly a peace came over me and in the midst of his mom and others weeping i found myself started singing and softly whispering to the lord brother john danko and the other saints and ministers were also around the bed at the burial i know i had to find composure knowing that my girls and i will no longer see him that was the last with tears i looked up in the sky it was a very hot day and as if i saw in the clouds the lord and allah not his side then i i saw my entire 25 years just flash across from the day we got married to this day i said thank you lord for allowing me 25 years blissful years with your son and i said to alan go my dear go reap your reward your reward awaits you then i looked down and saw the body was being placed in the ground and i said to myself this is not him he is in a better place the lord gave me a measure of peace for those moments i thank you lord when we came home reality struck i could not do this alone our home was not the same our life was not the same god had to come in and fill that void and i said to god alan was the head of the home you were ahead of him now you have taken him away you have to beat ahead i felt like it was incumbent on me to take the mantle i challenged the lord i said lord i will serve you all the days of my life but you are obligated to take care of my girls and i through the journey ahead it was painful days and weeks and months heartaches and dark valley days or nights but through all this every day i would take my girls and together we would read the bible and pray and draw strength from him to face the day ahead he would give us a scripture to hold on to for the day scriptures like james 1 6 with faith and not wavering then we would get home from school and work and we would get together again in the evening thanking him for taking us through today and asking him for a wood and strength and comfort to face the night and the next day ahead my three girls went university and they needed that extra strength to stay focused it was a hard road yes we cried together there were times us four felt so all alone desperation stepped in and i spoke out loudly to the lord and i said lord we are not here just four of us but five you are the fifth person here with us god you promise not to leave us nor forsake us since this was the test and time all the things i've learned all the scriptures all the word now the test the true test is here my fate was put to the test test to claim all his promises i said grieving is painful lord but only you can help us through and take us through and now sains and you know what he held to his end of the bargain he did not fail us he carried us through the journey sometimes there were only one set of footprints thank you lord the next chapter of my life stepped in so my plan was to live the rest of my life for the lord to reminisce on the 25 blessed years of marriage be there for my children and when grandchildren comes along be there with them until the lord is ready to take me home well clearly this was not so much god's plan a couple years later another proposal stepped in i was deaf i definitely had to take this one to the lord throughout the year it was a lot of prayers and asking the lord for his direction and leadership and guidance in making this decision i said lord this was not my plan but this same time the lord i do not want to disobey you and face the consequences of disobedience help me show me if this is really part of your plan i need to know if this is your perfect will in my life i need you to vindicate this to me lord it took a year to say yes i will to this blessed man and servant of god call christopher augustus for long and here i am and the rest you see and can attest to after five years of this union of marriage i thank the lord for six children and eight grandchildren with another on the way i want to thank the lord for all his goodness and his mercies and his grace upon my life for his blessings more than i could have ever imagined for his faithfulness towards me i owe it all to him my aim and goal is to continue to press toward the mark for the price of the high calling of god in christ jesus amen i trust this was a blessing to you to god be all the glory and honor and praise [Applause] love you all in jesus name may god bless you happy new year to you and your family from my family and i thank you [Applause] [Music] whatever

quiet but here i am you know you can't get away from it no matter what you do amen like brother mike was saying um i wanted to say something but i was going through what am i going to say and i guess that's what i'm going to say oh my you know i was just talking there's so many miracles that god has done and every year he keeps doing so many miracles in fulfilling his word in our lives but i remember when god called me i was in a bad place a dark place and uh that pacific night a couple brothers came down to our place and started testifying to us and i just felt the pull to come to service wednesday night service and on jane street it was a little upper room we call it the upper room you know and um that night me my brother went there and um i uh we we walked into the door and we were going up the stairs and i heard this singing i come out of a catholic church too right and you don't sing like that in the catholic church it's all proper and quiet and respectful and i hear just singing clapping and shouting and that i'm going what you know i you know my brother stopped and he froze and something inside of me just pushed him up the stairs hey let's go i don't know you know i i get in the get into service and i see some people sitting around it's nothing to look at it's nothing just like the bible says there's nothing desire of him right you know and i look around and go what in my mind i'm thinking what am i doing here who are these people right but there's something inside on the on the outward i was in a mess i was in a carnal state i was i was being a you know possessed by many spirits at that time that were taking me to and fro and i i sat down and uh a little black man come walking out to the pulpit and i'm sitting there and i'm waiting i didn't know what to expect and next you know he starts preaching and boy can he preach whoa i'm going what is this what's going on here why is he screaming so loud you know what's going on here you know and and and then my head started pounding and and and then you know things were being stirred up inside of me and i didn't realize at the time that i was being delivered you know the word was coming forth and it was healing me and deliver me and set me free and i'm sitting around i'm looking at certain individuals i'm seeing a a light and that was a testimony last night about the light amen he's the light of the world and the light had come and that was my time where the light came to me and i i'm sitting there and a word is coming forth and something is lightened up inside of me that i have no words to explain what that light is but it was lighten up inside of me and the darkness was slowly starting to flee and flee so this is running through my thoughts i'm seeing light on people's faces in the service and i'm going what is this light remember i was in a mental state there seeing psychiatrists and and and things at the time and and i'm going you know start playing on my mind what is this like and then as i was leaving the the service i i seen a light like it was like a a spotlight shining on the wall and i kept seeing this light i'm going what's going on here i get in the car my brother is uh you know driving us home and um and i see this light following us on on the buildings hitting the buildings hitting the bills hitting the buildings i said you see that light you see that light and he says no i don't see no light he says you're you know i i thought man i'm going crazy you know and and i got home but the confirmation was when i got home and i walked through the door my wife lived with me for three and a half years while i was going through this dark depression time and when i walked through the door unconsciously i just walked through the door and she's sitting right there and she said what happened to you and i said i don't know what happened to me she goes i see a light around your face and that was just the light of god and that's when god came and the first service i went to the first time i heard the word of god from a man of god the light of god came amen amen and and i'm still receiving that light and i'm going to receive it tonight again amen god bless you saints [Applause] let's all stand [Music] so one more time as we invite our pastor to come for the last time [Music] [Music] [Music] come all you saints of light proclaim jesus the light

everybody in here even looks like children on cell phones is that right wow but you know on your cell phone on your tablet on your uh ipad or your iphone you can find an hourly or daily uh reminder and a minute by a calendar that will show you days and then hours in the day and some of them will go right down to the minutes of the day right and in that way you can keep your life organized and uh you have your daily schedule in that wonderful tablet or laptop wherever and you'll find a to-do list you'll find a task manager you'll find uh six-year calendar two-year calendars one-year calendars depends on what you want uh or if you're planning into the future you might have that and then it'll come right down to one year monthly and then a weekly and then your daily calendar which will break itself down into hours and minutes amen now with the help of google how many hair knows google i'm not going to preach about google but i'm preaching about jesus christ but google has so taken over the world that most if not all of our information flows through the tunnels of their of their uh information technology and so um we find that google has timelines and they say they they're not but they can literally give you a timeline on your life from the first time that you logged on to google right even on my tablet they will come up with the pictures that i took five years ago 10 years ago and they have it all lined up that they can line up your whole life from when uh computers started and google came into existence they have kept that stuff and they can show you things and tell you things in your life from since way back within and uh and then they can even point you into your future in the terms of things you might have referred to while you're phoning somebody or talking to somebody you know with key words that they they can pick up they can tell you literally almost what you're thinking for now and what you're thinking to do in the future right so when you're thinking like that and along with those tools those uh tools of technology they're giving you a virtual assistant my and now we have them on amazon we have them on this that that there is virtual assistants everywhere where um your phone is talking to you your tablet is talking to you my god if that happened many years ago people would run for cover thinking this witchcraft or or some kind of thing taking place okay how how could you have a thing talking back to you you know so it looks to them as if it's like witchcraft they call it science now of course but then we find out my friends that the virtual assistant will help you to manage your time so organize your day and things like that and all those tools that we have uh especially if you're in university or if you're in college your time you gotta you gotta be there you gotta be for that class you gotta be there for time well it keep you on track with things and it'll help you to remember it'll help you very much to remember it'll make you remember things that you have to do it will make you remember places that you have to be or what to be as long as it's there it will remind you and tell you about that it will also remind you of people you have to meet brother praise god it'll remind you of people that you have to meet uh like that it's amazing that despite all the the great technologies that we have despite all of these aids that we have on assistance that we have we still sometimes forget you have all these things and we still forget and basically the human being is a flawed uh being or person and we all tend to forget things to a lesser or greater degree they claim as you get older you you forget more things when you're younger you remember better but regardless we uh to a lesser or greater degree we forget things no matter how you how smart you are or how retentive you think you are you will tend to forget certain things amen and basically we we all forget full of people and we forget full of names sometimes somebody just talk to you and they walk away and when they walk away they turn back and then you you don't know how to address the person because you forgot the name already and you're you're caught in that because we tend to be forgetful right and we also forget full brother of birthdays god help you if you forget anniversary right when you forget full of anniversaries and on top of that you're forgetful of very important appointments unfortunately as i said before we unfortunately forget people and i want to begin here by saying that is the main reason why jesus instituted the lord's supper which we call communion it is really a memorial feast it is something to cause you to remember him and in order for you to remember him he instituted this so that we might do it over and over that we might remember here now in genesis chapters 40 and 41 you will find the story of joseph and in the what the chapters you rem of the butcher and the baker when he was in prison and you know how god gave them dreams and then how god used him to interpret those dreams and he interpreted the dream of the baker and telling him that he he is going to be hanged he's going to die right and the butcher how he would be exalted and go back to his original position well the one was hanged and the other one was elevated back to his original position what years uh sometime went by not years but time went by and the story goes and it tells us how the pharaoh had a dream and now it was time to interpret the king's dream [Music] the wise men couldn't do it nobody could do it pharaoh himself had no answer he searched the kingdom far and wide to have someone to interpret the dream oh and no one could but then suddenly the bible tells us the butcher remembered the butcher remembered joseph oh my praise god if you will look you'll find that in genesis 40 23 the baker failed to remember joseph actually the bible said he forgot joseph he forgot joseph he failed to remember him but this butcher he remembered joseph what joseph told him and did for him and so he referred joseph to the pharaoh and pharaoh was happy to have such a man and you know the rest of the story how that joseph came to pharaoh interpret the dream and himself was exalted to pharaoh's right hand i won't go into those types and shadows of jesus christ being the greater joseph son of prosperity dead buried put in the pit raised up elevated put at the right hand of power amen and so on but in the book of psalms chapter 20 verses 6-7 it says now i know that the lord saveth his anointing he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand some trust in chariots and some in horses but we will remember the name of the lord oh hallelujah we will remember the name of the lord remember jesus that is what i'm talking about remembering jesus now the lord's supper that we are going to partake of is a meal of remembrance let that be something that you retain and that you really do remember luke 22 19-23 reads thus he took the bread and he gave thanks and said gave it to them saying this is my body given to you do this in remembrance of me so this meal is particularly he instituted it so that all of those that would ever believe on him or in his name would remember him because he knew a lot of voices a lot of distractions a lot of things will come into the world that will take your mind and your thoughts away from him and from his word and he wanted to be sure that there was something that can draw your attention back and call you to attention that you might remember jesus and especially in these times of sodomy and these times of violence days of law are upon us darkness of lord this year upon us trail of the serpent mystery of iniquity the darkness of babylon is upon us the powers of sin satan and demonic enticement is now flooding the world [Music] clouds of darkness are billowing in my friends all around us when you look for a sliver of light you can hardly see it because it seems that we are in the lands of egypt spiritually again and the light and the sick darkness is so much that with your eyes closed you can feel it all around you and we are living in that day this day the bible spoke of it but we are now in it praise god remember this now i want you to know he do this in remembrance of me because it will be hard to remember him the pleasures of this world all around you oh trying to track your attention as the old uh song said of the pilgrim that was racing to the stairways of heaven when it says the songsters in the harbor that stood beside the way they attracted his attention inviting his delay but his watchword being onward he stopped his heirs and he ran and he shouted loud hosanna deliverance will come amen jesus will come the rapture will come we're going out of here we only have to stand it for a while but the lord has promised i will not leave you nor forsake you i go to prepare a place for you that where i am you may be also it's not going to leave you and that's my brothers and sisters but he will take it with him listen in the same manner after the supper he took the cup saying this cup is the new covenant in my blood which is poured out for you but the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine two vines right the two vines with their branches and you know the twine it's right down through the bible uh you know you know that baby uh abel and kane and jacob and esau and joseph and uh moses and jamborees and that spirit of satan coming right down right down until it's there with judas and jesus right in the same church right and so on and right there amen yes my brother and but the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine is he in my group he's in my church he is right here with me and his hand is working along with me outwardly but right really he's not with me he's with me physically outwardly but really spiritually you're really not with me but outwardly look like his hand is with nine right oh my on the table the son of man will go as it has been decreed but woe to the man who betrays him and they began to question among themselves which of them might be who would this be who would it be amen oh my friends let us all remember you say well what are we to remember this is we got to remember first of all the grace of god because as i've said and will say again his grace is greater than our faith because faith has to have something to believe it and grace was before faith and provided the object for faith to believing it's jesus christ is the grace of god to us and then we can now believe in him so his grace is greater than our faith amen praise god and i thank god that this marvelous grace is given to all believers who truly believe in him and receive jesus christ within their hearts with all sincerity and love that grace of god is in them and upon them for his glory hallelujah amen and the day his dress came the world become a new world your world become a new world when his grace come to your life your world become a new world your bible become a new bible your life become a new life everything changed when the grace of god came to your soul oh my hallelujah amen the rejected stone became the headstone when jesus went to the cross he was rejected stone before the cross but after they crucified him that stone that was rejected became the head of the corner he become the one to change the age from lord to grace he became the head the turning point of that dispensation and of that marvelous corner hallelujah amen yes sir when jesus died on the cross you realize what happened times changed and to this day we have bc before christ that's the way time is divided and annual domini which is after christ right here we are friends that this mighty one times change with his coming amen hallelujah and now we thank god in these last days that the headstone has come to us crying grace grace grace grace grace god's grace to the human race all that will believe on him he promised him that he would forgive their sins cleanse them and raise them up at the last day by his promise according to his word through jesus christ god shall that he is not us a god like that put him a god of christ the judgment curse the judgment no he showed that he is a god and the god rich in mercy and love and grace oh hallelujah oh my i'm glad that i am a recipient of that grace i'm glad that we all sit here tonight as bennis fisheries of that grace which we have received by the blood of jesus christ hallelujah thank god for the blood of jesus christ washed away my sins washed away everything and placed me here today and thank god i'm rejoicing night and day hallelujah because we no longer have to live under legalistic rules regulations we don't have to live under laws whether you old testament synagogue laws or church laws or denominational laws or you know government law we don't have to be bound by legalistic laws and rules and regulations of that nature we are not bound by rituals anymore amen listen according to this bible there's nobody has the right to tell you one thirteen candles and your sin is going despair there is no one anywhere you can read in this bible that can tell you that if you bring so many thousand dollars i can grant you a piece of paper called indulgences and your sins will go up in smoke oh my amen i'm glad i live in a world i live in an atmosphere i live in a pocket of grace where his grace has set me free i am not on the bondage amen no way i'm not under bondage but i am set free because whom he sets free is free indeed and i now enjoy the glorious liberty of the sons of god hallelujah oh praises marvelous and wonderful name remember we all remember his mercy we all remember his grace but let us also remember his betrayal and you and i we all should better remember how quickly we can betray him somebody will tell you something somebody will say something and before you know it before you can think you already betray him because you say something that's not right not according to the word not according to the spirit oh my not of the spirit of christ you you don't have to look scraggly with with long teeth and and all of that to be a judas the spirit of judas can anoint you and cause you to do things not even according to your own human will the difference with a sinner is that his nature is the sin so he'll go right on but the believer something will stop him and he'll stop he or she or that young person will stop and say oh dear lord forgive cleanse me lord forgive me of my wrong doing you say oh but this one hears this sin that i did is so big i will never be forgiven for that oh no the bible says that he forgives all our sins is that right paul was a murderer that killed not regular people he killed christians and he didn't kill one or two the bible said he really chased them he searched for them he hunted them down and he slaughtered them but when god in his mighty grace choose to call him out god said you are going to be a light to the gentiles i'm going to use you for my glory and for my honor hallelujah and god forgive him of all his sins that's why he said i am the chief of sinners and i want you to know brother sister because you know you say oh i'm a believer i'm a christian but let me tell you things from your life can still haunt you even though you're a believer oh but the blood of jesus christ is to cleanse us from all of our sins if we commit ourselves to him if we surrender completely to him if we ask him wash me cleanse me make me the way you want me to be father amen i'll cast all my sins upon you because you care for me lord of god hallelujah it's so easy to betray him easy for us to betray him easy for us to betray what we know today not just as the the written bible but the living word the word has come alive again in the lives of men and women in this day and in this hour it's god walking around on two feet god behind human skin not bad your skin back there on goat skin that was hanging in the temple but you your body the temple of the living god and god living in you and expressing manifesting himself making his word real praise god so that man could today could have a present tense manifestation amen of christ in you the hope of glory amen hallelujah i thank god for the living word i thank god that this word is important for us hallelujah just as much as his grace is important it is also important you remember his betrayal because it's mentioned in all four of those gospels he didn't just mention it and push it aside he wanted to remember but the example of judas we know he's condemned but you also got to pay attention that you don't get influenced by that spirit and betray the lord jesus from time to time amen as we come together to partake of the lord's supper let us remember those who are beside us brothers and sisters that behind us brothers and sisters that are in front of us you don't have to wait until this service is coming to an end to pray for them you say but i always pray but tonight you have another opportunity to actually project your prayer from where you are to where they are even if they cross this building they cross the world you have the power of faith through the presence of the holy spirit within your life to project your prayer for when love projects grace takes over and the spirit of almighty god will bring it to pass for his glory do you believe this amen praise god hallelujah i want you to know friends we are not the only ones having the lord suffer on a night like this but tonight many are taking the lord's supper many brethren some with revelation some without the understanding without the revelation some without the applications not knowing fully what it is about or what it's supposed to do uh what is his purpose and stuff like that around the world on this night people are taking the lord's supper and they're doing it as a remembrance now if you know there are certain cultures where if their ancestors die every year around the time when they die they bring a large life science a picture of that person and they put it up and they have either a celebration a party or something whatever or a service even a service and they eat and they drink and it's all been done in remembrance a memorial we say they do that in remembrance of that person jesus instituted this communion this lord's supper so that we may partake of the bread and the wine that we may actually remember him not just remember him just thinking oh he was a good man but to remember what he has done for you who he is what he is still doing for you your family your home your children your grandchildren oh praise god for you let him go through your heart your soul he wants you to remember him we are to always be remembering jesus hallelujah amen no matter what you do make sure that you remember jesus and we come in a service like this we try to focus and we want to if we possibly can make ourselves specialists in remembering jesus if we forget everything else if we can't remember nothing else if we get so old that our mind slipping and we can't remember anything else remember jesus hallelujah and listen friends i've seen that i've seen people gotten so old they lost their voice they lost their sight and then they start slipping their memory slipping but you you going there and you're just talking with them and you just mention jesus all of a sudden they turn around and say what to say boy what you say son what they remember jesus you see because they they walked with him that talked with him that followed him they lived their life for him they surrendered their all to him that gave their whole being over to him hallelujah and so when his name is called they always remember jesus somebody's amen somebody said praise the lord sir thank you jesus say thank you lord blessed be the name of the lord we remember jesus no matter what happens we want to remember him we know according to the old testament how that god led the churn of israel through the wilderness just as much that was naturally spiritually we are now being led through the wilderness of this present world and as he led them how did he lead them by a great pillar of fire by night on a crowd by day and that pillar of fire led them and brought them to their promised land jesus was with the disciples until they came to the day of pentecost the bible tells us that he rose from the dead went back into glory [Music] left that a physical body there on the ultra sacrifice came back down in the form of the holy spirit and the spirit of almighty god came down in the form they saw it hallelujah in the form of fire but this fire this pillar of fire began to divide itself up into little licks of flame showing that no more is this going to be in one man named christ jesus but now that corn of wheat that fell into the ground has now multiplied and come back and now the great holy spirit is going to come back now and dwell within his people all praise god forevermore that he will live in them when the great fire fell upon them hallelujah i want to thank god that we are sitting in heavenly places in jesus christ we not in heaven but we are in a heavenly atmosphere is that right we are in a heavenly atmosphere in the presence of the living god oh thank god forevermore every one of us here i don't know about you but i am enjoying the warmth from the fire of the holy ghost amen i don't want to be oh you're not warming myself from some painted fire oh not from a picture of the past all night but i want to be right into the presence of the unfailing realities of the living god i want to have perfect realization of what god has done and what god is doing in this day and in this hour blessed be the name of the lord the bible tells us cloven towns like as a fire came down and sat upon each one of them and it just set their hearts burning with the fires of god hallelujah i trust the night that the holy spirit will set your heart of fire your soul affair that you can start the new year with the grace of god and the light of god shining on your face shining through your life that you can be one of the lower lights and that your light can be burning that you can be a shine so that some shipwreck life some brother some sister somebody by the side of the way we'll see the light we'll see the life hallelujah and will point them back to jesus christ the haven of rest the harbor of safety may that great holy spirit do that for you tonight praise god forevermore i tell you it's a wonderful time we know praise god that when we come to this marvelous wonderful table we know that is his stable it's not mind stable but it is his table that he instituted and he commanded us to keep this in remembrance of him in obedience to him hallelujah and when we come together like this we come together to commune with him usually the word communion comes from east from the east where people sit down and they break bread and have some soup or something else and while they're talking they call that communion right so that term is coming from that but when we come here we just didn't come to talk to people we come to talk and commune with the person of our sovereign god who is in our midst here tonight that is what we are here for to commune with him and him with us so that we can have fellowship with him like adam and eve did in the morning time of the world he came down and talked with them in the cool of the day and now when it is evening time we want to come together under the great inspirations of the holy spirit and to have communion with him once again no wonder zechariah said at evening time it shall be light you'll praise god it shall be light again on the standing revelation of who god is and what he wants to do in your life is here upon us again blessed be the name of the lord oh i thank god that when we come and sit around like this it's like we have entered in to the oasis of the holy spirit when we have caught the revelation the the word when the word begins to unveil itself to us you you've come like a man who living in a world that is like a desert and you find an oasis flowing with fresh water oh my oh praise god forevermore praise god just to think that god for the steps of the righteous are ordered of the lord ordained to the lord and god has guided you here tonight to a spring and oasis of fresh water hallelujah in the midst of a hot sinful dusty and devilish world that we are living in and that we are traveling through hallelujah but thank god there is a spring there's an oasis here where weary travelers can come and can drink and quench their thirst amen that their god-given thirst and refresh themselves hallelujah and then they look back and they remember how they got here you start to remember how you got here i noticed tonight the various believers testifying how they were out in the world how they were going about doing their own lives their own things like that and somewhere along the line they are testifying of how god brought them to the oasis of himself of his word amen and refresh them give them a new life a new marriage and you walk in your existence oh praise god forevermore we're not getting here from tradition we're not getting here from ritual we're not getting here by law but we are gathered here under the canopy of the grace of almighty god through the blood of christ our savior amen hallelujah amen thank god god led us right through amen through this desert of denominational churches with all kind of teachings on scriptures amen in every way brother sister hallelujah praise god let me tell your friends it's almost like god's spirit doesn't lead you and you've got to be able to is that right you better know let his hand be on you you can't do that by yourself he has got to lead you that's why he sent the holy spirit to lead you and guide you into what all truth not some truth partial truth but all truth of the word of god oh my lead you all to this desert that we have here of all these thousands of churches all claiming to have the truth where you don't have three thousand truths you only have one amen death comes in thousands of ways but there's only one life there's only one god hallelujah amen think about it friends here we serve with all kind of thousands of modern-day gospel preachers amen saying all kinds of things amen having all kinds of motives motivations inspirations and everything else and on top of that here comes waves and waves of sin rolling out to the ocean of hollywood rolling out new fashions rolling up new walks new talks new actions that captures the mind of the young people and even all the thought are caught by this [Music] where old grandmothers are putting on skin tight pants oh my buying all the creams they can afford thinking that will turn back the clock they've found a fountain of youth they've found somewhere they can drink where they will never die but jesus said they're not a natural fountain you can drink from where you will not thirst again and where you're not gonna die but if you drink from this fountain if you drink from me you'll never die you'll never thirst again he is the water of life the christ of god the mighty living one hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord and those waves are sent from hollywood they're not sweeping over the world they're now creeping right into the church they're creeping into the church and taking over from pulpit right down to the pew where one people's desire is to be seen to be known and to be recognized there is no more supernatural spiritual fruit of god that's willing to hide and ripen in the shade but they want to be in the light and that may be all right but god may not want you there god may want to sweeten you and ripen you up in the heat of the shade oh my corrupted the church of god being corrupted denominated dished up all men ridiculous my friends it's only the holy spirit to keep your mind right keep your soul straight keep your thoughts right that you might stay right upon the word of god only he can do that amen but let's remember jesus and let me tell your friends whether herod likes it or not he gonna remember jesus whether jesus like it or not he's gonna remember jesus oh yeah going to remember that herod especially going to remember he had a great time of opportunity that he could have given this life over to christ but instead he invited entertainment wanted to dance with the devil we're not here to dance with the devil we're not here to have a game with the devil to say leave me alone and i'm gonna leave you alone no we are on the charts we are soldiers of the cross we are children of the most high god the sword is in our hand and we are here to take off the devil's head for the glory of god amen amen hallelujah i believe maybe when herod come down to its dying day he remembered jesus i believe while he's well dick was rattling in his troll he was remembering jesus remembering what he said remembering what he did and instead of him asking for forgiveness for cleansing or anything like that he was asking for entertainment you know that's happening right now in the churches religious entertainment religious singing oh my voices like angels that they think is going to take them into heaven listen listen god listen to voices beautiful more than that up in glory these voices we got down here with earthly things maybe your voice might come on the edge of something like one but the real thing is over there oh my but here we find that the devil is scripted you said what are you talking about i told you before that i was still a young man preaching the gospel casting out devils much prayer much faster and so much sometimes i'd walk in the church and people start falling down devils start screaming and coming up and here was a mighty man from from england come down a great opera singer well-known amen and oh he entertained he's a belief a christian and singing and everything else and after a while the service is over got close to him got close to him and start talking with him oh my and then the devil began to manifest i didn't cast them out but god wanted me to know showing and teaching me what's back there you don't go by those things sweet voice greatness the the greatness of man and positions and power and authority and money to give you credibility and all this type of things no no no no no go by the word by the holy spirit working and moving supernaturally they don't even believe that anymore they believe you must have some trick like just like herod believed that jesus had a trick and then he could just entertain them like that amen but don't let's be like that because you you you if you you better remember him now because you're going to remember him you're going to start remembering him when your soul begins to travel to the regions of the lost come to those dimensions of the damned on your soul begin to scream and cry out as it passes through a nightmare of this life you can't even go in the presence of god you can't even come back because your time is up you're obtained to die and after death the bible says the judgment the great white throne stands before you and there is the judgment is next oh my i trust that the young people will take notice of this and give it serious thought serious thinking repent get baptized in the name of the lord jesus not because of mommy or daddy telling you but because you something struck your soul and you recognize what god is saying to you in this hour amen so give the serious thought now don't give it serious thought when you come to the end of your life and the end of your way amen yes sir don't do that oh may god help every one of us to remember jesus brother brother tim brother mike let's remember jesus i know we've heard this preached before but oh i feel the inspiration of the power of the holy spirit remember the lord jesus christ i shall never have i can remember him when he hung on the cross for our sins wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his chance we are healed you're healed if you believe it right now you're healed right now if you believe it i remember him and i remember what he's done for me many times he saved me before i was born again before i knew him i knew there was some i call it something was always there with me and i went up on a cousin of ours owned a company that had great big machines in it and great wires coming in the main wires bringing in voltage and everything else flying my kite on an easter time and the kite goes up and the tail goes around the wire and boy you know you hide from them not to see you going up and go into their house and and climb through the window and go up there where the connection was and put my hand to take off the the kite wire there and then all of a sudden [Music] but in the midst of all of that i felt like something and i left i was left sitting there stunned i didn't know who that was what that was because there wasn't anybody there but obviously i had a job to do had work to do believe it or not another time another easter again going with my kite but this time now look how short i am at my age now can you imagine when i was 10 or 12 and then you know short men love to buy big motorcycle i don't know because they want to appear big so i had a big kite and i'm going with the kite and i come to the corner of the street where the road goes by cars are passing and already the car is right there and again i felt that hand grabbed me and pulled me back like that i have to remember jesus don't tell me to forget him because before i was born again that happened so when i got saved then i'd start to get understanding why all that was happening there's work that you have to do oh my brother sister let's remember jesus i'm telling you my story but many of you sit right here got many things like that in your own life your own walk your own experience some of you almost drowned some of you almost dying car accident some of you always were poisoned some of you almost died in the hospital in various ways but by his grace god changed you robbed you and you're

glory will i be able to fully worship and adore him and then we will know as we are known amen hallelujah i remember when he washed away my sins and remember when he cleansed me and made me into a new creature hallelujah praise god and have me in heavenly places where he can now have fellowship with him [Music] we know god is a spirit but he's not just a spirit or any spirit he is the sovereign god he he is a living personality when we come together like this like when the disciples were on the road of it to ambulance and they started talking about him the bible says and jesus drew near oh my when we talk about him like this he draws nigh again the spirit of the resurrected christ he's raised up he's not dead he's alive forevermore oh my oh i don't know why i'm referring to these things i uh will myself and bishop patterson were invited to cast the devil out of a insane man they have to lock him in the house the police don't even want to go in he's so mad he'll kill a murderer whatever big strong man but the thing about it because god was using us they didn't tell us they just said oh there's a man in there that needs prayer and we all fired up with the holy spirit pushed the door and walked in when we walked in here comes this man from one of the rooms in this house nobody else in the house and they said who are you blokes who are you guys do you know who i am he says and the guitar that was in the corner started playing there was not a single soul in there and the devil won't play with the mind think i'm making up a story and i'm telling you i'm just someday but look it

at last some will remember children and the sound of their footsteps hollowing the past some will remember snowflakes hollow off on the ground some will remember sunlight just a little glimpse of sunlight shining on a fence some the breath of blossoms after rain some will remember twinkling glimpses of the stars on all of those some will remember the one who said i if i be lifted up i'll draw all men onto me and when those kinds those latter ones come to die they'll have their face dead faces lifted towards eternity calm and untroubled with their eyes like children hastening to receive their glad surprise may god bless us everyone as he comes again as a thief in the night god bless you let us prepare ourselves to have the lord's supper as you prepare that i'm just gonna go in and
