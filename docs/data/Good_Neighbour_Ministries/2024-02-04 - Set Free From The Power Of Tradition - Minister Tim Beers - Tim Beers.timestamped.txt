[38:02] so the Lord made a way that uh you know
[38:04] we were able to fix the the problem in
[38:07] the basement it's fully um you know it's
[38:10] not completely all done we still got to
[38:11] repair the the ceiling and so forth but
[38:14] that'll all be done but the actual leak
[38:16] and everything's been identified and
[38:18] brother Alvin you know did a wonderful
[38:21] job in doing that the Lord led him and
[38:23] directed him and uh so we thank God for
[38:26] that and then we also had um you know
[38:28] this problem with the roof and so we
[38:30] said that we wanted to get somebody to
[38:32] come in and so uh I had a friend of mine
[38:35] who's a contractor and owns many
[38:37] buildings in Oakville and I said Tony
[38:39] come on down and you know have a look at
[38:40] this these two problems and so he was
[38:42] here with me on Friday we went up on the
[38:45] roof we looked at uh you know the
[38:47] situation there on the roof and um you
[38:50] know and he says you know what Dan he
[38:51] says call this person um he's somebody
[38:54] that I know he's reliable and I believe
[38:57] he can take care of this problem for you
[38:59] and I said okay wonderful so we called
[39:01] him he came right away within a couple
[39:04] days uh went there he looked at the
[39:06] whole situation he saw everything he
[39:09] says yes we can repair this and you know
[39:11] over the years we've had you know many
[39:13] different quotes and all I can say is
[39:15] that the Lord
[39:17] supernaturally is doing this for us at a
[39:20] price that is very affordable and it's
[39:24] going to be done and over with and we
[39:25] want to give God the
[39:27] glory it'll probably be done you know
[39:31] within the next two weeks also which is
[39:33] good so the Lord just continue to give
[39:36] us this beautiful weather I thank God
[39:38] for the sunshine this morning are you
[39:40] glad for the sunshin amen you don't
[39:42] realize how much you miss it until it's
[39:44] gone for about a month or two right and
[39:47] you know all of a sudden you go out
[39:48] there and boy you just absorb that sun
[39:51] and it lifts your spirits praise God
[39:53] because we know that it's a perfect type
[39:55] of Christ
[39:57] when Christ is not in our lives things
[39:59] can get pretty gloomy amen but when he
[40:02] shines upon your life and he starts to
[40:04] allow his Spirit to move in and through
[40:07] you it lifts you up it perks you it
[40:10] gives you Vision it gives you uh hope it
[40:13] it starts to give you confidence and and
[40:16] so we thank God for that amen praise God
[40:19] and so also I'd like to um you know
[40:22] correct something that that took place
[40:25] here on Wednesday night
[40:26] um you know uh brother Chris was here
[40:29] Wednesday night and he started a
[40:31] wonderful new series on women of the
[40:35] Bible and you know it's um something
[40:37] that you know it sparked something
[40:39] within me right away and uh so I'm
[40:41] certainly looking forward to that series
[40:44] as brother Christopher would bring it on
[40:45] our Bible study nights on Wednesday
[40:47] nights and so this
[40:49] Wednesday while he was ministering you
[40:52] know uh you know near the beginning of
[40:54] the service he made a statement and the
[40:56] statement was that you know Eve is and
[41:00] was the mother of all
[41:02] living and nowhere in the Bible does it
[41:06] say that Adam was the father of all
[41:09] living and so when he made that
[41:11] statement something now call it what you
[41:14] want you can say I had a senior
[41:16] moment okay or or a a hard drive froze
[41:21] up but all of a sudden all I could see
[41:23] was wait a minute Adam is the the father
[41:27] of all living in my mind this thought
[41:30] came into my mind and I went to the
[41:31] scripture in St Luke chapter 3 and I saw
[41:35] the lineage and all that was in my mind
[41:37] was the lineage of Christ that's all I
[41:41] could see and so I I I made some notes
[41:46] and I gave it to brother Christopher and
[41:47] I said brother uh you know just some
[41:49] notes Here a correction that Adam is the
[41:52] father of all
[41:53] living and then that was absolutely
[41:57] wrong Adam is not the father of all
[42:00] living brother Christopher's statement
[42:03] that Eve is and was the mother of all
[42:06] living was absolutely correct and that
[42:09] Adam is not the father of all living is
[42:11] absolutely correct so brother
[42:13] Christopher was 100% correct I was 100%
[42:18] wrong okay so that night when I went
[42:21] home I was just falling into my sleep
[42:25] and
[42:26] I Heard a Voice is clear in my mind and
[42:29] it said Adam was not the father of all
[42:34] living Eve is was the mother of all
[42:39] living He said the serpent placed a seed
[42:43] in
[42:44] Eve and it was like I jumped out of my
[42:48] bed and I looked at sister Jennifer I
[42:50] said brother Christopher was 100% right
[42:54] the Lord just released me from this
[42:56] blockage in my mind it can happen Saints
[43:00] I believe God had a purpose in it and so
[43:03] I immediately contacted brother
[43:05] Christopher at 11:30 on Wednesday night
[43:07] and I told him and he responded and he
[43:09] says brother praise God I I'm so
[43:13] grateful that the Lord has cleared up
[43:15] this situation and I was rejoicing amen
[43:20] praise God now we need to understand
[43:24] that Eve was beguiled by the
[43:28] serpent beguiled means she was defiled
[43:32] okay and it wasn't an apple that she ate
[43:35] it was adultery that took place in the
[43:37] Garden of Eden and she was beguiled and
[43:40] Cain's seed or or the serpent seed
[43:43] placed uh in Eve brought forth Cain and
[43:47] when she went and participated with Adam
[43:50] there was a seed there for Abel okay and
[43:54] Abel killed his brother it was a perfect
[43:57] uh you know clear understanding and then
[43:59] the Holy Spirit you know and then in
[44:01] Genesis 3:15 it says and I will put
[44:04] emity between thee and the woman and
[44:07] between thy seed and her seed he was he
[44:09] was talking to the serpent there amen it
[44:12] shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[44:14] bruise his heel in 1 John 3:12 it says
[44:17] not as Cain who was of that Wicked one
[44:22] and slew his
[44:23] brother and wherefore slew he him
[44:27] because his own Works were evil and his
[44:30] brothers
[44:31] righteous the serpent seed brother
[44:34] brandham preached on the serpent seed in
[44:38] 1958 but you know that in
[44:40] 1957 he made a statement and he said
[44:43] this he said in questions and answers
[44:48] 1957 and I had actually brought this
[44:50] quote up on Wednesday night too and this
[44:52] was part of the blockage that was going
[44:54] on in my mind and when when I read the
[44:56] quote I read it and said that after the
[44:58] flood in the Tower of Babel when they
[45:00] began to scatter out that's when they
[45:03] taken their colors and so forth they're
[45:06] all come from the same tree that's
[45:09] exactly right Adam and Eve was the
[45:12] father and mother Earthly of every
[45:16] living creature of human beings that's
[45:19] ever been on the earth that's right
[45:22] black white pale Brown yellow whatever
[45:26] color you might be that's absolutely the
[45:29] place that you live in and that's the
[45:32] way now you look at that quote and you
[45:35] think well wait a minute here but you
[45:38] see progressive revelation was even
[45:40] happening in the prophet and that's why
[45:43] we cannot say in this day that you only
[45:46] play the tapes and you only listen to
[45:49] what and what exactly what the prophet
[45:51] said repeat only what the prophet said
[45:54] that's thank God that we have the holy
[45:56] ghost that can come and correct us am
[45:58] amen and correct the word and and
[46:01] progress his Revelation because it
[46:03] wasn't until 1958 that brother brandham
[46:05] preached the serpent seed and brought
[46:08] forth all Clarity and Revelation on the
[46:12] word of God and so I want to thank God I
[46:16] want to thank God for brother
[46:17] Christopher I want to thank God for all
[46:19] the ministers that that are around this
[46:22] ministry praise God the Lord had a
[46:25] reason in allowing this to take place on
[46:28] Wednesday night it's for somebody this
[46:30] is a learning moment amen praise God
[46:32] it's a learning moment for each and
[46:35] every one of us not one of the ministers
[46:37] that was here on Wednesday night came to
[46:41] me after the service and said brother
[46:44] what about this what about the serpent
[46:46] seed nobody it just somehow it was just
[46:50] supposed to be and we let the Holy
[46:53] Spirit work it all out and here now now
[46:55] he comes right back around and I believe
[46:58] somebody needed to hear this amen praise
[47:01] God thank you hallelujah amen thank you
[47:05] Jesus so at this time let's just change

[50:56] Hallelujah and then we're going to
[50:58] continue in The Prayer in the Bible
[51:00] studies and get a little deeper into it

[51:04] Foundation this morning hallelujah we're
[51:07] going to go to Mark
[51:10] 71 and we're going to be talking about
[51:12] set free from the power of
[51:14] tradition
[51:17] Hallelujah my lord it's about setting us
[51:20] free it's always been about setting us
[51:22] free from day one Hallelujah when when

[51:33] redemption of setting us
[51:36] free are we are are you believe we're
[51:39] totally free this morning yes we are
[51:41] totally free in Christ yes we are but
[51:43] are you manifesting that freedom in
[51:46] fullness no we're not that's the reality
[51:51] because that's his word and his word has
[51:54] come so that you may
[51:56] recognize like like you said it's a
[51:57] progression of faith that is happening
[52:00] in our lives in our experience and as
[52:02] that Faith Comes amen we get set free
[52:06] more and more and more Hallelujah and
[52:09] God wants to break everything that is
[52:12] not of him off our lives amen hallelujah
[52:15] we hold on to so many things we don't I
[52:18] I know I hold on to things I didn't even
[52:19] realize I was holding on to things until
[52:22] he comes and we want him to come and
[52:24] speak to our hearts amen not brother Tim
[52:27] but we want the spirit of God to speak
[52:29] to our hearts open your heart to his
[52:32] spirit this morning Hallelujah Mark
[52:38] 71 Jesus talked and preached a many
[52:41] sermons in Parables but he said to the
[52:45] those it's given to you to know the
[52:47] mysteries of the Kingdom it's given to
[52:50] you to know so if this may sound like a
[52:52] parable this morning this message but
[52:54] it's given to the elect to know what
[52:56] he's speaking and what the spirit is
[52:59] saying then came together unto him the
[53:02] Pharisees and certain of the scribes
[53:06] which came from
[53:07] Jerusalem and when they saw some of the
[53:10] disciples eating bread with
[53:13] defiled that is to say with unwashed
[53:17] hands they found
[53:20] fault for the Pharisees and all the Jews
[53:23] expect they wash the their hands off eat
[53:27] not
[53:28] holding eat not holding the traditions
[53:31] of the
[53:32] elders and when they came when they come
[53:35] from the market expect they wash they
[53:39] eat
[53:40] not and many other things there be which
[53:44] they have received to hold as their
[53:46] washing of Cups and pots Brazen vessels
[53:51] and of
[53:53] tablets then
[53:56] the Pharisees and scribes asked him why
[53:59] walk not thy disciples according to the
[54:02] traditions of the elders but eat bread
[54:05] with unwashed
[54:07] hands he answered and said unto
[54:10] them well had Elias prophesied of you
[54:14] Hypocrites as it is written this people
[54:18] honor me with their lips but their
[54:20] hearts are far from me Hallelujah
[54:25] Look what Jesus answered
[54:28] them here was the the the scribes and
[54:31] the Pharisees with all the
[54:34] traditions of the
[54:36] law coming against Jesus the god of the
[54:42] law and telling him think about it
[54:45] telling
[54:46] him and look at Jesus's
[54:50] response how bit in vain do they worship
[54:54] me teaching the doctrines and
[54:56] Commandments of men for laying aside the
[54:59] Commandments of God ye hold the
[55:02] traditions of man as the washing of pots
[55:05] and cups and many other such things you
[55:09] do many other different things Jesus is
[55:13] saying that you do and that you follow
[55:16] other words it's not of me he's
[55:19] saying and he said unto them full well
[55:23] ye reject the Commandments of God God
[55:25] that ye may keep your own
[55:29] traditions for Moses said honor thy
[55:32] father and thy mother and whoever
[55:34] whosoever cth father or mother let him
[55:38] die a death but ye say if a man shall
[55:41] say to his father or mother it is cin
[55:46] that is to say a gift by what by
[55:50] whatsoever thou mightest be profited by
[55:53] me he shall be free and ye suffer him no
[55:58] more to do ought for his father or for
[56:01] his
[56:02] mother making the word of God of none
[56:06] effect through your Traditions which you
[56:09] have
[56:10] delivered and many such things like
[56:14] things do
[56:16] you let us go to John
[56:20] 8:31 lots of things he's
[56:23] saying he's pointing else something here
[56:26] but many different
[56:28] Traditions
[56:30] Hallelujah John
[56:32] 8:31 then Jesus
[56:35] said then said Jesus to those Jews which
[56:39] believed on him if ye continue in my
[56:43] word then you are my disciples
[56:47] indeed and ye shall know the truth and
[56:51] the truth shall make you
[56:53] free they they answered him we be
[56:57] Abraham's
[56:58] seed and we were never in bondage to any
[57:03] man you see the
[57:09] response how sayest thou ye shall M be
[57:13] made
[57:14] free Jesus answered them verily verily I
[57:17] say unto you whosoever committed
[57:20] sin is the servant of sin and we know
[57:24] sin is UN
[57:25] belief and the servant abideth not in
[57:28] the house forever but the son abideth
[57:32] forever if the sun therefore shall make
[57:35] you

[59:20] God bless you as you're
[59:21] seated you Hallelujah
[59:31] glory to
[59:34] God Amen you know I was thinking uh
[59:38] about this
[59:40] um message and it came to me the power
[59:43] of
[59:45] tradition and it's been with me for a
[59:47] long
[59:48] time and then I was just thinking about
[59:52] it and putting some things
[59:55] together and then God gave me the
[59:57] opportunity I got a call from Brother
[59:59] Dany and said you'll be up this
[1:00:03] Sunday so I was thinking about it in bed
[1:00:05] I said Lord I got this thought here but
[1:00:08] what
[1:00:09] direction because I can preach on
[1:00:11] anything I can put anything together at
[1:00:14] this stage of my walk now and preach on
[1:00:17] it but we want the mind of the Lord amen
[1:00:21] we want what we know that when we're in
[1:00:23] his mind and his will then he comes amen
[1:00:27] and that's all I want to be is a a
[1:00:29] surrender vessel to him so I was
[1:00:32] thinking you know about this and then
[1:00:34] this song came into my
[1:00:37] head and I remember this song by in the
[1:00:41] world by the band
[1:00:44] Queen and when when when I heard this
[1:00:46] song all the time in the world it always
[1:00:49] struck me and I just got so
[1:00:52] excited and I want to read the lyrics to
[1:00:55] you and it just kept going over and over
[1:00:58] in my head and he starts singing and
[1:01:02] this man that was the the lead singer of
[1:01:04] Queen he was in bondage to a homosexual
[1:01:07] lifestyle but when you hear him singing
[1:01:10] you can hear something coming out of his
[1:01:12] voice especially this song and I believe
[1:01:15] all of them inside all of them that are
[1:01:18] in sin have a cry inside of their hearts
[1:01:22] to be set free and and the lyrics goes I
[1:01:25] want to break
[1:01:27] free I want to break
[1:01:29] free I want to break free from the lies
[1:01:33] amen and I put in this that the devil's
[1:01:35] put on me Hallelujah he goes and then he
[1:01:39] goes God knows I got to break
[1:01:42] free God knows I got to break free God
[1:01:45] knows I want to break
[1:01:48] free oh only God knows
[1:01:52] me only God knows you this morning

[1:03:13] Hallelujah brother Brandon speaking here
[1:03:16] in the greatest battle ever
[1:03:20] fought but do you
[1:03:23] realize that there's really only two
[1:03:26] powers in all the
[1:03:30] universe out of all the differences
[1:03:33] between
[1:03:34] nations differences between each
[1:03:38] other there's only two powers and two
[1:03:43] kingdoms all the rest the little minor
[1:03:47] things are connected to either one of
[1:03:50] those
[1:03:52] powers are we listening this morning yes
[1:03:55] thank you Jes and those Powers is God's
[1:03:59] power or Satan's
[1:04:04] power so we're only dealing with two
[1:04:06] Powers this
[1:04:08] morning not any other power and and
[1:04:12] Satan's power is the flesh the carnal
[1:04:17] mind which is our greatest
[1:04:20] enemy not one
[1:04:23] another but our greatest enemies
[1:04:26] ourselves and then God's power is the
[1:04:29] word of God that is plac within us the
[1:04:33] attribute of God hallelujah amen and
[1:04:37] those are the two Powers within you this
[1:04:39] morning that are at
[1:04:42] War and it's like the old saying is
[1:04:45] who's going to win this
[1:04:47] war it's whoever you feed the most amen
[1:04:51] whoever you accept the most
[1:04:54] you're going to continue to accept the
[1:04:57] devil's lie and traditions of man and
[1:05:01] works of man or you going to accept the
[1:05:03] word of God truth when it
[1:05:06] comes because he said you'll know the
[1:05:09] truth and if you accept that truth it'll
[1:05:12] set you
[1:05:13] free
[1:05:16] Hallelujah Jesus said who the son of man
[1:05:19] sets free is free
[1:05:23] indeed Matthew
[1:05:25] 28:18 and Jesus came and spake unto them
[1:05:29] saying all power not
[1:05:32] some all power is given unto me in
[1:05:36] heaven and in
[1:05:37] Earth in the spiritual and in the
[1:05:41] natural don't let the devil lie to you
[1:05:44] and say he has any power over you that
[1:05:48] he has any right to control you and tell
[1:05:51] you what to do cuz Jesus said all power
[1:05:55] is given unto me now he conquered at
[1:05:58] Calvary he shed his blood and we got the
[1:06:01] blood this morning amen behind us behind
[1:06:05] our words this morning behind our lives
[1:06:09] this morning to claim the victory that
[1:06:12] we can walk out of here
[1:06:16] free
[1:06:18] indeed
[1:06:20] Hallelujah and Jesus came and spake unto
[1:06:23] them saying all power is given unto me
[1:06:25] in heaven and earth Jesus sets us free
[1:06:27] from all
[1:06:29] sin all
[1:06:31] sin Hallelujah
[1:06:34] listen I'm not what I used to be and I'm
[1:06:37] not what I'm supposed to be but to this
[1:06:40] morning Hallelujah I'm at a place now
[1:06:44] where I believe I'm going to be what he
[1:06:47] wants me to be I believe that with all
[1:06:50] my heart do you believe
[1:06:52] that every every time I every day I wake
[1:06:56] every time I hear that word of God I
[1:06:59] expect the word to speak to me and speak
[1:07:01] to my life and change me
[1:07:05] amen hallelujah because in
[1:07:09] reality there's no sickness there's no
[1:07:12] bondage there's no change no tradition
[1:07:15] no devil can overcome the bride because
[1:07:18] it's promised to her perfect faith not
[1:07:21] just Faith to overcome but perfect Faith
[1:07:23] to overcome perfect
[1:07:26] realization perfect clarity in the word
[1:07:29] that what God has promised he'll do it
[1:07:32] God is making clear to the bride he's
[1:07:35] saying what I have said what I have
[1:07:37] spoken in this hour I will do it I will
[1:07:40] perform it and when that becomes a
[1:07:42] reality in your heart that's perfect
[1:07:45] Faith thank you Jes that's perfect faith
[1:07:49] not just Faith see they had Faith back
[1:07:53] in the p
[1:07:54] Pentecostals they had Faith back in the
[1:07:57] the Luther Wesley days but it wasn't
[1:07:58] perfect Faith because they didn't see
[1:08:00] all the word they didn't see the
[1:08:03] promises in the fullness God did not
[1:08:05] make it clear to them that what he said
[1:08:07] he was going to do because that's why
[1:08:10] Luther he was set free by the just shall
[1:08:13] live by faith that was a great
[1:08:14] Revelation that was Freedom that was the
[1:08:17] Holy Ghost but he still smoked the pipe
[1:08:19] and did all these things see all the
[1:08:22] word wasn't made clear because God God
[1:08:24] did not make it clear to them in that
[1:08:26] day but God has hidden nothing from us
[1:08:28] in this day amen all the Mysteries the
[1:08:31] Seven Seals are open everything is
[1:08:34] revealed to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:08:36] he's made known all his word so all the

[1:08:44] God do this if he said it he'll do
[1:08:47] it if he said it in this hour he'll do
[1:08:50] it no question no doubt no no reasoning

[1:17:33] God
[1:17:35] Amen
[1:17:39] Hallelujah God has always been about
[1:17:43] setting this people free from Adam and
[1:17:46] Eve right from the beginning when the
[1:17:48] sin happened in the garden he came down
[1:17:52] with a s sacrifice a lamb Hallelujah
[1:17:57] he's always been about he used Moses to
[1:17:59] set the Israelites free from slavery
[1:18:02] from Egypt Jesus died to set the world
[1:18:05] free from sin which is the worst bondage
[1:18:08] of all and when he sets us free he
[1:18:12] empowers us to help others find Freedom
[1:18:15] in Christ as
[1:18:18] well he didn't set you free just to be
[1:18:22] there
[1:18:23] he set you
[1:18:24] free to go and take that
[1:18:29] freedom and speak that freedom to other
[1:18:32] people and set them
[1:18:34] free I don't care what it's from God
[1:18:38] that's that's the mystery in this hour
[1:18:42] where God and his bride are becoming one
[1:18:44] and the same you'll know in that day
[1:18:47] that I'm in the Father the father in me
[1:18:50] I in you and you in me I don't care what
[1:18:53] they say that there's you know there's
[1:18:54] so many doctrines out there so many
[1:18:56] teachings that these people who preach
[1:18:59] God in in in that God is in us and that
[1:19:02] we are the same as God is well we're not
[1:19:05] the God but if God birth me amen any
[1:19:10] animal that births its own kind brings
[1:19:13] forth of his own kind Hallelujah and
[1:19:16] you're born again by the spirit of God
[1:19:18] you can only bring forth a part of God
[1:19:20] Amen and that God and inside of you amen
[1:19:24] God could have called The Rapture way
[1:19:27] back there but he didn't because he
[1:19:29] wants to manifest and this morning we
[1:19:32] are here because God wants to manifest
[1:19:35] in us hallelujah he wants to express
[1:19:39] himself in us the problem is we're in so
[1:19:42] much of the
[1:19:43] way Hallelujah I'm laying a foundation
[1:19:46] here I'm not getting into it yet a lay
[1:19:48] the foundation we're getting so much
[1:19:50] ourselves in the way but when we we come
[1:19:53] to understand that we move out of the
[1:19:55] way by faith and God reveals To Us by
[1:19:58] faith how to move out of the way then
[1:20:01] God steps on the scene and he starts
[1:20:03] doing what he
[1:20:05] says oh I don't see God doing this I
[1:20:07] don't see God he said this he said that
[1:20:09] he said that I pray I pray I pray I pray
[1:20:11] I pray this I pray that doesn't happen
[1:20:13] it doesn't
[1:20:15] happen there something wrong with God
[1:20:18] automatically yeah there there's
[1:20:20] something wrong with God be honest
[1:20:23] there's something wrong with
[1:20:26] God when we when we think that we never
[1:20:30] think to ourselves there's something
[1:20:31] wrong with me but when you come to a
[1:20:33] place of maturity in God you realize
[1:20:37] Lord Lord you said this Lord you
[1:20:41] promised this so what's in the way
[1:20:44] father in my life because we hate
[1:20:48] surrender oh we just sing about it I
[1:20:51] surrender all
[1:20:54] I give all my life to Jesus Take It All
[1:20:57] Lord whatever you
[1:20:59] want but when he asks us for something
[1:21:02] little small like that my God don't want
[1:21:05] that what does he want with
[1:21:14] that okay
[1:21:17] amen
[1:21:19] hallelujah yes sir and when he says us
[1:21:22] free empowers us to set others free he
[1:21:25] gave us a prophet a pillar of fire a
[1:21:27] sacrifice lamb to deliver power we are
[1:21:31] free to set other people free Paul
[1:21:33] explains it well in Galatians 5 listen
[1:21:37] to what he says it is for Freedom that
[1:21:40] Christ sets us free stand firm then and
[1:21:43] do not let yourselves be burdened again
[1:21:47] by the Yoke of
[1:21:50] slavery Hallelujah
[1:21:53] going back to our old
[1:21:56] ways going back to the ways of the
[1:22:00] flesh going back to
[1:22:03] Traditions that God has broken off our
[1:22:06] lives didn't the Lord God say I got no
[1:22:10] pleasure in a soul who turns
[1:22:13] back God Don't Look Back he looks
[1:22:18] forward he goes forward he walks forward
[1:22:22] those bloody Footprints didn't go for
[1:22:24] backwards it went forward right up to
[1:22:28] Glory that's what God does you don't
[1:22:31] look
[1:22:33] back don't look back
[1:22:35] Saints don't listen to the lies of the

[1:23:56] lifestyle it's a believer's lifestyle
[1:23:59] that we live we wait upon God for faith
[1:24:04] we pray in situations we pray in P
[1:24:07] Pinnacle points of our lives and
[1:24:10] decisions we have to make and we wait
[1:24:13] upon
[1:24:14] faith upon God because the justs wave
[1:24:19] upon Faith the just live and walk by
[1:24:23] Faith
[1:24:24] Hallelujah not by
[1:24:27] sight not by other men's
[1:24:30] opinions that's why I don't like giving
[1:24:32] my opinions a lot I I I discern the
[1:24:36] questions that are asked me and if it's
[1:24:39] a question that you should be taken
[1:24:41] before the Lord and waiting upon God for
[1:24:44] God to speak to you unless he gives one
[1:24:47] of the ministers a
[1:24:49] word you wait upon God amen
[1:24:54] hallelujah
[1:24:59] amen the first verse is one of the most
[1:25:02] powerful in the scriptures for it is the
[1:25:05] freedom that Christ has set us free
[1:25:08] stand firm then and do not let
[1:25:10] yourselves be burdened again with the
[1:25:12] Yol of slavery some preachers say that
[1:25:15] this is a center message of a
[1:25:17] Christian's life it is the key verse to
[1:25:21] the entire book book of
[1:25:23] Galatians and it was the message that
[1:25:27] fueled Martin Luther's protest
[1:25:31] Reformation but what does it
[1:25:33] mean it is freedom that Christ has set
[1:25:36] us free
[1:25:39] Hallelujah that's what burdened that's
[1:25:41] what empowered Luther in his day just
[1:25:45] imagine coming out of the Catholic
[1:25:47] Church you talk about coming out of
[1:25:50] tradition Breaking Free from that
[1:25:53] bondage of tradition while he had to
[1:25:56] break free but imagine how powerful that
[1:25:59] Revelation when it struck him what did
[1:26:01] he see when he said the just shall live
[1:26:03] by faith he seen Freedom he seen God
[1:26:07] setting them free from the bondage of
[1:26:10] slavery bondage of man's traditions we
[1:26:13] can look back and see that amen but
[1:26:16] remember we're going to get into
[1:26:19] the I'm just going to pass over but all
[1:26:22] the church ages Blended right down into
[1:26:26] this
[1:26:27] age and even the seven Church age
[1:26:30] messenger
[1:26:32] hallelujah oh even the seven Church age
[1:26:36] messenger was under a lot of those
[1:26:38] Traditions but there came a place there
[1:26:42] came where the Bible became a new Bible
[1:26:44] to him and he spoke a lot
[1:26:47] different and remember he said a lot of
[1:26:50] things he said I I have a lot of things
[1:26:53] I cannot tell you I cannot say because
[1:26:57] he knew the Holy Spirit would go to the
[1:27:01] individuals to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:27:04] and personally reveal it to
[1:27:09] them
[1:27:12] Hallelujah last week in Matthew 24 it
[1:27:15] was the most deceiving age of all ages
[1:27:21] this age

[1:28:06] hour and people are all messed up
[1:28:10] confused don't know where to go
[1:28:15] why

[1:28:44] going to be a lot of things around the
[1:28:46] Bride of Jesus Christ that will deceive
[1:28:49] her temporarily or put her in a state of
[1:28:51] this being in deceit but the holy spirit
[1:28:54] inside of her will be constantly
[1:28:56] revealing the word and breaking her free

[1:32:01] and grace and the Theology of man and
[1:32:04] their intellect intellectual
[1:32:06] interpretation of the word of God with
[1:32:09] the power of the traditions of man will
[1:32:11] kill any church any life any
[1:32:18] walk because we're we're
[1:32:20] removing
[1:32:22] the one main thing which is him that's
[1:32:26] why Jesus constantly rebuked the
[1:32:27] Pharisees and Sadducees think about
[1:32:31] it I don't want to get ahead of myself
[1:32:33] but think about it here was God himself
[1:32:36] the god of the law God who wrote the law
[1:32:39] coming to fulfill the
[1:32:41] law and because the Pharisees and
[1:32:43] Sadducees just think are we going to
[1:32:45] think this morning yes the Pharisees and
[1:32:48] Sadducees because of all the hundreds
[1:32:52] and there's literally hundreds of
[1:32:53] traditions that they made up with the
[1:32:56] law if they were to just stay with the
[1:32:59] law that was their portion Israel's
[1:33:01] portion is to stay with the law not the
[1:33:03] Gentile church if they would have just
[1:33:06] stayed with the
[1:33:08] law they would have recognized him but
[1:33:11] they made up so many hundreds of
[1:33:13] different traditions and
[1:33:15] rituals that of manmade that they were
[1:33:19] looking they were when they when Jesus
[1:33:21] was speaking speak and speaking to them
[1:33:23] and speaking the word to them and saying
[1:33:26] isn't it written isn't it written they
[1:33:28] look back and and and call them be
[1:33:31] called them this called them
[1:33:34] that when he was pointing out the word
[1:33:37] because all they were looking at was
[1:33:38] their
[1:33:40] Traditions
[1:33:44] oh you know brother Bram seen the
[1:33:49] devil like a serpent
[1:33:52] coming right into this message and he
[1:33:54] said I tried to get it he said I tried
[1:33:57] to get it but it just snuck right
[1:34:01] in snuck in that
[1:34:06] Spirit
[1:34:09] Hallelujah listen to
[1:34:12] me God permitted Israel to take the law
[1:34:15] in Exodus
[1:34:17] 19 when Grace already had given them a
[1:34:20] prophet a pillar fire a sacrificed lamb
[1:34:23] to deliver the delivering power but they
[1:34:27] cried out for the
[1:34:31] law it wasn't God's
[1:34:34] will but it was
[1:34:37] injected now listen it was injected
[1:34:40] because man wanted
[1:34:43] it it wasn't God's Will and Jesus
[1:34:48] said let thy will be done
[1:34:52] not my will but thy will be done even
[1:34:55] Jesus himself as a man said not my will
[1:34:59] but thy will be done he recognized that
[1:35:03] he wanted to inject
[1:35:05] something father remove this cup from me
[1:35:07] but he said
[1:35:09] nevertheless because the word can't be
[1:35:13] deceived he knew because he was the word
[1:35:16] and it answered right back and said not
[1:35:19] my will but thy will be done but man
[1:35:22] will wants these
[1:35:26] things
[1:35:28] injected we don't have to inject nothing
[1:35:31] in our walk we don't have to help the
[1:35:34] spirit of God for nothing he does
[1:35:38] everything we just got to be youi that
[1:35:40] surrendered vessels unto him he knows
[1:35:44] what he's doing he knows why we're going

[1:36:57] times in the past many different
[1:37:00] Pinnacle times in my life he has spoken

[1:37:05] brother Brandon when he he knew that
[1:37:06] voice when that voice spoke to mother of

[1:37:55] behavior such as religious practice or a
[1:37:59] social
[1:38:01] custom a belief or a story or a body of
[1:38:05] beliefs or stories relating to the past
[1:38:10] that are commonly accepted as
[1:38:13] historical though not able to be
[1:38:17] checked you listening to be checked or
[1:38:20] demon rated or to be accurate or
[1:38:24] justified by the word of
[1:38:28] God if the Pharisees only
[1:38:32] knew
[1:38:34] that the things that they were saying to
[1:38:37] Jesus were not
[1:38:39] accurate they weren't
[1:38:42] checked they weren't with the word of
[1:38:46] God they wouldn't have crucified him
[1:38:49] they wouldn't have but we know they had
[1:38:57] to got it that's the
[1:39:00] Bible it says study yourself approved
[1:39:04] and to those who know their God shall do
[1:39:06] great things you know the Bible says
[1:39:08] that study yourself
[1:39:10] approve oh I I I read my Bible 10
[1:39:12] minutes a day I listen to a tape here
[1:39:15] and there maybe two or three times a
[1:39:17] week that's not what the Bible's saying
[1:39:20] that's not studying yourself approved
[1:39:22] there's a different spirit that God
[1:39:25] anoints you with when you come and study
[1:39:27] the word it's not only for the preachers
[1:39:29] to study the word it's for you every
[1:39:33] individual Paul said it he says I praise
[1:39:36] you for taking the things I say and
[1:39:40] going back and studying in the word of
[1:39:42] God and seeing that they're in there
[1:39:47] amen that's when God opens up our
[1:39:50] understanding even greater I listened to
[1:39:53] tapes I read my Bible for many many
[1:39:55] years but then when I started studying
[1:39:57] God started bringing because I'm not a
[1:39:59] studier okay my my my uh my education is
[1:40:03] not great my ADHD helps me to not be
[1:40:07] focused right so I'm not a great studier
[1:40:11] but God I started praying for many years
[1:40:13] Lord I want to study more and study more
[1:40:16] your word hallelujah and he started
[1:40:18] helping me study and I'm telling you
[1:40:21] things that were coming out that God was
[1:40:23] revealing is a lot more richer you talk
[1:40:27] about uh this plastic food out there the
[1:40:29] SP food food out there you know some of
[1:40:32] you sisters you know how to cook those
[1:40:33] spices up and cook for hours a dish man
[1:40:38] that that tastes
[1:40:40] good that is not good that's what
[1:40:44] studying does that's the difference
[1:40:46] between
[1:40:48] studying hallelujah what is tradition
[1:40:52] on the other hand is a more specific
[1:40:55] term it's often used to describe an
[1:40:58] individual event or practice such as
[1:41:01] removing your shoes when you enter your
[1:41:03] home Traditions are ideals and beliefs
[1:41:07] passed down from one generation to the
[1:41:11] next from one Church age to the
[1:41:14] next oh
[1:41:17] my where's the heart of all these TR
[1:41:20] Traditions these doctrines these dogmas
[1:41:23] come
[1:41:23] from right from the Catholic Church the
[1:41:27] mother
[1:41:28] itself passing down how many times has
[1:41:30] brother Simon said to us amen you come
[1:41:33] in the message but you carry a lot of
[1:41:36] your Traditions you carry a lot of your
[1:41:40] beliefs that were taught to you back
[1:41:42] there but you got to die out to those
[1:41:44] things do you understand you got to die
[1:41:48] and let go of a lot of things for from
[1:41:51] the past because that's the very thing
[1:41:54] that's hindering the holy ghost in your
[1:41:56] life from doing what it wants to
[1:41:59] do Paul says I Die
[1:42:03] daily well brother Tim I thought you're
[1:42:05] supposed to build my faith you know to
[1:42:07] make me a real Christian you don't die
[1:42:10] there's no
[1:42:12] life you don't die there's no life you
[1:42:15] don't let go there's no letting
[1:42:17] God bottom
[1:42:19] line amen
[1:42:22] hallelujah amen like that uh saying
[1:42:25] what's that saying that you said with
[1:42:26] the
[1:42:30] beliefs yeah I like that I like that
[1:42:34] because I was studying this and that
[1:42:36] forms a belief around
[1:42:38] you
[1:42:40] amen that's the Holy Ghost forms a
[1:42:43] belief around you and anything that
[1:42:46] comes that is different than that belief
[1:42:49] even though you know true you talk about
[1:42:52] powerful you talk about deception even
[1:42:55] though you know it's true even though
[1:42:58] you know it's God speaking to you and
[1:43:00] revealing to you the truth in your life
[1:43:04] oh it's hard to break through that it's
[1:43:06] hard to let go of that because you you
[1:43:09] believe that's your foundation that's
[1:43:11] the only thing that's holding you
[1:43:12] together but God is saying let it go let
[1:43:16] it
[1:43:17] go I want to set you free I want want to
[1:43:21] take you higher this very thing that
[1:43:23] you're holding on to is holding you down
[1:43:25] he keeping you down from growing in
[1:43:31] christall you got to break that if you
[1:43:34] got to fast you got to pray some come up
[1:43:38] by fasting and praying you got to break
[1:43:40] that demon upon your
[1:43:45] life when I say you you just got to get
[1:43:48] a place and be available for the Holy
[1:43:52] Spirit and that's your fasting and
[1:43:55] praying you don't mind if I take a
[1:44:04] drink brother Bill gave me two of these
[1:44:06] up

[1:44:17] vision listen I don't know when God's
[1:44:19] going to take any one of us home

[1:44:54] gets sweeter and more simpler I just
[1:44:56] need to hear his voice well
[1:44:58] done you know what that will mean all
[1:45:01] the struggles that we go through
[1:45:04] especially the ministers that we go
[1:45:07] through that Satan hits us on levels of
[1:45:10] discouragement lies you're nothing

[1:45:14] through to the people you are you you
[1:45:16] know you're uneducated all these things
[1:45:18] that we fight at every sing single level
[1:45:21] and God gives us the grace to press
[1:45:23] through and to stand up here and the
[1:45:26] battles that we go through before and
[1:45:29] the battles that we go through
[1:45:30] afterwards why just to please him to

[1:47:46] part two with the N of Rome we want to
[1:47:49] bring and and expose a lot of the
[1:47:52] doctrines a lot of the traditions and
[1:47:54] see where we are in the message
[1:47:56] today and what we're doing today
[1:48:00] Hallelujah glory to God Amen look the
[1:48:03] scribes of the old created an oral
[1:48:08] law now think about it
[1:48:10] here an attempt to protect the Jews from
[1:48:14] breaking the Mosaic law so God gave them
[1:48:17] the Mosaic law but they created the aura
[1:48:21] law to protect the
[1:48:24] people from breaking the Mosaic
[1:48:28] law oh my do you see
[1:48:34] anything such efforts not only don't
[1:48:38] work but the results of applying the
[1:48:40] oral law often directly contradicts the
[1:48:44] Mosaic law isn't that their government
[1:48:47] today they they pass a law and then they
[1:48:50] they got to create another law to to to
[1:48:53] to guard that law and then because that
[1:48:55] law needs another law to guard that law
[1:48:58] and it just goes on and on the next
[1:49:00] thing you know you don't even know what
[1:49:01] you're doing you don't even know what
[1:49:03] law to believe or what law to
[1:49:05] follow isn't that the truth out there do
[1:49:08] you do you know your government do you
[1:49:10] know the the laws of the land or you
[1:49:13] just you know caught up in the upper
[1:49:14] room every
[1:49:16] day
[1:49:17] Hallelujah well that's the way it is in
[1:49:19] Christian ity not in Christ but in
[1:49:23] Christianity these churches out there
[1:49:25] that's why there's so much confusion oh
[1:49:28] this truth that truth this truth that
[1:49:30] truth this doctrine that Doctrine this
[1:49:33] belief that belief this way that way
[1:49:37] Jesus said I am the way I am the truth I
[1:49:40] am the life not any of these
[1:49:45] things hallelujah hallelujah glory to
[1:49:49] God
[1:49:51] amen the oral law listen is a Code of
[1:49:55] Conduct in use in given culture religion
[1:50:00] or Community application by which the
[1:50:03] body of rules of human behavior is
[1:50:08] transmitted by the human behaviors of
[1:50:12] people of body is transmit it humans
[1:50:16] transmit it man transmit it not God
[1:50:23] that's why the Bible says examine

[1:50:44] what you
[1:50:45] believe you know if you're alive you'll
[1:50:48] know that so you examine
[1:50:51] yourself do we examine a lot of the
[1:50:55] thoughts do we examine a lot of the
[1:50:58] behaviors in our lives our actions day
[1:51:01] by day whether you're at work wherever
[1:51:03] you are do we examine those things by
[1:51:06] the word of God do we take those things
[1:51:08] back into the word Lord show me my
[1:51:12] behavior is it in there is it pleasing
[1:51:16] to
[1:51:17] you no we just accept it this is me this
[1:51:21] is who I
[1:51:24] am and you wonder why Where's
[1:51:28] God always the question comes up why are
[1:51:32] you blessing other people's and not me
[1:51:34] Lord what about
[1:51:40] me because that person there is doing
[1:51:43] one thing that you're not doing they're
[1:51:45] examin themselves they're examin their
[1:51:47] actions back in the word of God and
[1:51:49] they're seeing because God is revealing
[1:51:51] to them and they're letting it go
[1:51:54] they're surrendering and they're dying
[1:51:56] out to
[1:51:58] it listen the bride is being judged
[1:52:03] now the house of the Lord is the
[1:52:07] beginning of
[1:52:09] judgment we judge ourselves now amen
[1:52:12] because he can't judge us
[1:52:15] there we're being judged here now so we
[1:52:19] must judge ourselves
[1:52:22] now not Let It Go not Loosely and
[1:52:27] laziness and lackness and believe the
[1:52:30] devil's lie or you're okay one minute he
[1:52:33] tells you you're not okay and the next
[1:52:35] minute he comes back and says oh you're
[1:52:37] okay he always tells you let me tell you
[1:52:39] when he tells you you're okay is because
[1:52:42] he doesn't want to let
[1:52:44] go he knows when he's losing power over
[1:52:48] an individual power power over your life
[1:52:51] power over your mind he'll come and tell
[1:52:54] you you're okay you don't have to go
[1:52:57] that far Grace will cover you but God is
[1:53:00] saying something different and your
[1:53:01] heart is saying something different we
[1:53:04] need to get in contact with our hearts
[1:53:06] with our souls more than ever in this
[1:53:09] hour and be truthful to
[1:53:13] that I thank God for your works I thank
[1:53:17] God for your faithfulness so is the
[1:53:19] pastor we thank God for your your giving
[1:53:22] we thank God for all these things well
[1:53:24] let me tell you one
[1:53:26] thing you're going to thank God when you
[1:53:30] surrender that to
[1:53:33] God and then you're going to be a
[1:53:35] blessing not a
[1:53:37] burden not a burden upon the
[1:53:40] ministry oh the Lord wants this train to
[1:53:43] move faster he wants his progress to go
[1:53:46] faster my brothers and sisters he wants
[1:53:49] his mature mat to grow I believe this is
[1:53:51] the hour who are you brother Tim who are
[1:53:55] you brother Danny in this hour to take
[1:53:57] this to the Rapture well who was who was
[1:53:59] brother Simon who was uh brother uh
[1:54:03] anybody brother Brandon who was anybody
[1:54:06] in God's eyes in Man's eyes in your
[1:54:11] eyes you judge who's equipped and who's
[1:54:14] not equipped but God doesn't if you look
[1:54:17] back at the prophets and you study all
[1:54:19] the prophets and all the man of God they
[1:54:22] all had
[1:54:23] weaknesses they all had failures in
[1:54:26] their lives they all made
[1:54:28] mistakes but God choose to use who he
[1:54:31] wants to use to bring his word and God
[1:54:36] regardless if you like it or not God is
[1:54:38] choosing raising up man in this hour to
[1:54:41] bring this to the resurrection to bring
[1:54:44] this to Total
[1:54:48] Deliverance
[1:54:57] hallelujah amen I'm going to try to wind
[1:55:00] it down
[1:55:03] here you see this was something that the
[1:55:06] Jewish
[1:55:08] rabbis came up with over
[1:55:12] time listen they studied the Old
[1:55:15] Testament and came up with a list of
[1:55:18] hundreds of Commandments
[1:55:20] that are not found in the Old
[1:55:24] Testament these were what they ought
[1:55:28] were reasonable applications of the Old
[1:55:30] Testament so they studied the Old
[1:55:33] Testament they knew the Old Testament
[1:55:36] but they still came up with hundreds of
[1:55:37] things isn't that the Catholic church we
[1:55:39] are the church the pillar and founder we
[1:55:42] are the church so we have a right to
[1:55:45] change we have a right to change the
[1:55:47] word of God God does more than what the
[1:55:49] Bible says I heard I heard a priest say
[1:55:51] that God does more than what the Bible
[1:55:53] says and I believe that
[1:55:55] too but God said don't add or take
[1:56:00] away see everything I do sayeth the Lord
[1:56:04] will reflect in the word of
[1:56:06] God you'll see my character in the word
[1:56:09] of God you don't need to add
[1:56:13] nothing I don't need you sayeth the
[1:56:16] Lord I have promised I will perform
[1:56:20] sayeth the
[1:56:23] Lord
[1:56:25] hallelujah Isaiah's prophecy about the
[1:56:28] Commandments of men in Mark
[1:56:31] 7:6 Jesus did not correct his
[1:56:35] Apostles in the washing of
[1:56:38] hands when the Pharisees approached him
[1:56:41] he did not correct
[1:56:43] them but he pointed out the
[1:56:46] Pharisees and their wrongs and rebuked
[1:56:49] them
[1:56:51] them Isaiah rebuked the Jews of his
[1:56:54] generation for honoring God with their
[1:56:56] lips yet having their hearts that were
[1:56:59] far from
[1:57:03] God they did worship God but they
[1:57:07] worshiped their worship was in
[1:57:10] vain wow this is deep my brothers
[1:57:14] sisters vain worship is empty worship to
[1:57:18] take God's name
[1:57:20] in vain is to use it in any empty way to
[1:57:24] worship god with your words while your
[1:57:27] heart is a million miles away from him
[1:57:30] is vain
[1:57:33] worship your heart are million of miles
[1:57:36] away from him other words when God
[1:57:38] speaks into your heart you have no
[1:57:41] intention of obeying
[1:57:43] it is that you this morning
[1:57:48] no God knows I
[1:57:51] don't God
[1:57:55] knows I Isaiah said that the reasoning
[1:57:59] of your hearts were far from God and
[1:58:01] they worshiped in vain because their tra
[1:58:04] because of the traditions of
[1:58:06] men there are many traditions in
[1:58:09] Christianity Today that are deeply
[1:58:12] ingrained Christians have been
[1:58:14] influenced by our churches Christian
[1:58:18] authors preachers church history culture
[1:58:22] schools the press the
[1:58:25] movies how do we decide which Traditions
[1:58:27] are good which Traditions are bad if a
[1:58:30] tradition contradicts the word of God
[1:58:33] then it's bad and should be rejected
[1:58:36] because we know that there traditions of
[1:58:37] the fathers it's in the Bible the
[1:58:40] apostles talked about traditions of the
[1:58:42] fathers but it never contradicted the
[1:58:45] word it never added anything to the word
[1:58:49] so there is
[1:58:51] Traditions that don't add or take away
[1:58:55] from the word of
[1:58:57] God and those are the Traditions that he
[1:59:00] wants us to keep like come together at
[1:59:03] the Lord's Supper
[1:59:05] pray all these great Traditions that we
[1:59:08] have but it doesn't contradict the word
[1:59:10] of God legalism may be good intentions
[1:59:15] but is laying aside rejecting and
[1:59:17] nullifying God's commands
[1:59:20] the Bible makes it very clear that we
[1:59:22] should discern God's guidance regarding
[1:59:25] each tradition in our lives 2
[1:59:28] Corinthians 13:5 examine yourself and
[1:59:31] see whether you be in the faith or not
[1:59:36] hallelujah amen let us examine ourselves
[1:59:40] you know the
[1:59:45] Lord woke me up this
[1:59:48] morning
[1:59:51] for a
[1:59:55] reason and I'm going to talk to you
[1:59:57] sisters he woke me up this
[2:00:00] morning and you sisters
[2:00:02] know those sisters that know me how I
[2:00:06] encourage
[2:00:08] you how I pray with
[2:00:11] you how I love you in
[2:00:14] Christ the lord woke me up this morning
[2:00:17] and put thoughts in my head
[2:00:19] and said
[2:00:21] speak speak to that
[2:00:25] spirit and that spirit is a preaching
[2:00:29] Spirit now my sisters God has gifted you
[2:00:34] and blessed you with gifts in your
[2:00:37] life he uses you but he only uses you
[2:00:43] according to the word of
[2:00:45] God there's a
[2:00:47] circle there's there's a guidance of
[2:00:50] circle that you are free and you are
[2:00:52] free and this ministry is
[2:00:55] always allowed our sisters to be free
[2:00:59] I've been to other churches and I look
[2:01:02] and I fellowship with many other
[2:01:04] churches in private fellowships and
[2:01:06] those sisters are in bondage they're in
[2:01:10] slavery and I've listened to a lot of
[2:01:12] testimonies of sisters who have left the
[2:01:15] message saying that they wish they were
[2:01:17] born a man because man in this message
[2:01:21] have everything well we don't believe
[2:01:24] that we believe that you are gifted we
[2:01:28] believe that this world if they're going
[2:01:30] to see an influence of Christ in this
[2:01:32] hour it's going to be in you it's going
[2:01:35] to be in your
[2:01:37] life do you understand what I'm

[2:01:52] the world man has given authority to
[2:01:55] women in the world to preach but God has
[2:01:57] never given you authority to preach he's

[2:02:19] wife with all of our wives they are a
[2:02:24] Powerhouse but that Spirit of

[2:08:03] principalities against Powers against
[2:08:05] rulers of Darkness of this world against
[2:08:08] spiritual wickedness in high places
[2:08:10] therefore take unto you the whole armor
[2:08:13] of God that you may be able to stand
[2:08:16] take the word of God that's the the only
[2:08:18] way you're going to stand in this evil
[2:08:20] day and having done all the stand taken
[2:08:23] that word and stand there just stand my
[2:08:26] brothers and sisters just stand on that
[2:08:29] word when you're in a situation wherever
[2:08:31] you are in your walk in your life right
[2:08:33] now stand on that word don't move from
[2:08:36] it stay on that rock oh it's happening
[2:08:40] the miracle is happening when you stand
[2:08:42] on that word it's coming to pass God can
[2:08:45] do nothing but honor that the voice of
[2:08:47] the Bride
[2:08:49] Grom is the final voice to the
[2:08:54] bride I know it's a long service I know
[2:08:56] our minds can only take so
[2:08:59] much the voice of the
[2:09:02] bridegroom not the voice of
[2:09:05] men not my voice not any man's voice
[2:09:07] behind his fo bit but the voice of the
[2:09:10] bridegroom the bride
[2:09:13] hears is a voice to the bride in this
[2:09:15] hour the first family failed because
[2:09:18] they listen to the voice of the serpent
[2:09:20] through the woman or the wife they
[2:09:23] welcome another voice into their home
[2:09:27] don't welcome any other
[2:09:29] voice into your home they listen to that
[2:09:33] and obey the Serpent's voice and stay
[2:09:36] instead of staying with the voice of the
[2:09:38] bridegroom
[2:09:40] only only let's
[2:09:43] stand you Lord
