[37:53] went toward Herod
[37:57] and he lighted upon a certain place and
[38:01] carried there all night because the sun
[38:04] was set and he took off the stones of
[38:07] that place and put them for his pillows
[38:10] and laid down in that place to sleep
[38:14] and he dreamed and behold a ladder set
[38:17] up on the earth and the top of it
[38:20] reached the heaven and behold the angels
[38:22] of God ascending and descending on it
[38:26] and behold the Lord God stood above it
[38:29] and said I am the Lord God of Abraham
[38:31] thy father and the god of Isaac the land
[38:35] we are in our lies to thee will I give
[38:37] it
[38:38] and to thy seed amen praise the Lord and
[38:44] thy seed shall be as a dust in the earth

[39:02] thee in all places without goeth and

[39:16] praise the Lord may God bless everyone
[39:19] today please be seated
[39:28] oh yes thank you sir
[39:34] praise God what a mighty God we serve
[39:38] amen we are living in great days we
[39:42] thank God that we are people who have
[39:44] come to this Earth with um Blessed
[39:47] Assurance already built in uh and we
[39:50] thank God for that that uh he did that
[39:53] so that our thoughts don't have to be
[39:55] filled with worry filled with fear doubt
[39:58] or anything else because even if you did
[40:01] nothing uh even if your heart condemned
[40:04] you you still have that Assurance you
[40:08] still you're still certain of God you're
[40:12] still able to know that you will make it
[40:15] through not by your will not by your
[40:18] mind not by the blood of man not by the
[40:21] will of man but by the purpose of God
[40:24] which he said I am going to see all that
[40:28] I have spoken will be done
[40:32] amen praise God of course
[40:36] coming to a present time we're living in
[40:39] difficult times
[40:40] we're living uh as Timothy said in
[40:43] perilous times
[40:44] uh we're living in chaotic times that we
[40:48] are in here today and the word in
[40:52] hearing recognizing acting on the word
[40:55] of God I'm just quoting now we are fully
[40:58] acquainted we people who search the
[41:02] scriptures day and night and read out of
[41:06] papers and hear the news commentators
[41:10] that the world is now standing in the
[41:15] grip of two great spiritual forces
[41:20] and there are both very religious forces
[41:27] you didn't think Satan was huh
[41:29] but but he is religious too right so the
[41:33] real the real test and the real
[41:37] um deception will be
[41:40] within the religious realm this is It's
[41:43] just telling you that in a nice way
[41:45] religious realm because both forces
[41:48] operate in the religious realm now and I
[41:52] believe that these two great forces
[41:56] are soon coming to a head
[41:59] and both of these forces were
[42:03] represented in these two sons of Isaac
[42:07] how that God in his infinite wisdom has
[42:11] foreshadowed all things to us
[42:13] that we might by these things know of
[42:17] certain
[42:18] what lays before us
[42:22] made it so plain God his word nature his
[42:27] Universe also perfectly arranged
[42:30] together
[42:32] so that even The Sinner can see
[42:35] something is fixing to take place
[42:39] and therefore no one is without excuse
[42:45] is that right in other words you don't
[42:48] even have to read the Bible just look
[42:50] around you
[42:51] just look at what's happening in the
[42:53] world look at the events around your own
[42:57] life and you recognize something strange
[43:01] is going on
[43:02] it's just chaos everywhere and therefore
[43:06] we are to take a note of such things
[43:11] now the spiritual seed of the Living God
[43:16] has always been a Sojourner as you've
[43:19] seen with Jacob
[43:21] Jacob had to go hiding and traveling and
[43:25] sojourning everywhere that he went
[43:28] and that goes on with the true seed of
[43:31] God until it Finds Its position
[43:35] it's adjourning it's traveling it's
[43:38] searching it may go to this church that
[43:41] church it may ask this person talk with
[43:43] this person because it's hungering and
[43:46] thirsting to find the very truth it's
[43:49] hunger and thirsting for God to fill its
[43:52] heart that's what it is now the
[43:55] spiritual seed of God now
[43:58] it has to be a Sojourner it has to be a
[44:02] rambler and that always causes a
[44:06] separation
[44:07] amen you see
[44:11] Isa did not last very long with Jacob
[44:16] for as soon as Jacob obtained that book
[44:21] right praise God right then is the time
[44:26] it called for a separation
[44:28] amen I'm showing you the time of
[44:31] Separation he says the time of
[44:34] separation is from the moment that Jacob
[44:38] obtained that but right Hallelujah now
[44:43] you say well brother Simon what really
[44:46] is the birthright what really is the
[44:49] birthright we fling around these phrases
[44:51] and these terms and we need to
[44:54] understand what is the birthright
[44:57] now we we see the bird right in clear
[45:02] plain language is the holy spirit
[45:04] himself
[45:05] you have a right to the Holy Spirit
[45:08] within your life now that is only in a
[45:12] generalized way but as we go deeper we
[45:15] understand that in John 16 13 I believe
[45:19] where the Bible tells us that when he
[45:22] the spirit of truth will be a spirit of
[45:25] Truth when he comes he will guide you
[45:29] into all truth in other words he'll open
[45:32] your understanding he'll give you a
[45:34] revelation he will even show you things
[45:37] to come he'll he'll let the word of God
[45:40] come alive when the spirit of God comes
[45:44] and fills your life it's not just to
[45:47] make you twiddle your terms and you know
[45:49] shout and dance or speaking tongues or
[45:53] do what these are wonderful things but
[45:55] that is not his man purpose his main
[45:59] purpose is to guide you into all truths
[46:03] from the word of God Amen in in other
[46:06] words he is the spirit of Revelation
[46:10] Hallelujah he is the spirit of
[46:13] Revelation now go again the moment Jacob
[46:18] obtained that word right it called for a
[46:24] separation amen the word right
[46:28] or the right to receive the Holy Spirit
[46:32] of Revelation the right to receive
[46:35] Revelation the ability to be able to
[46:39] receive Revelation and you cannot
[46:43] receive Revelation from God unless the
[46:47] seed of God the gene of God is in you
[46:51] God's life is already in you so when the
[46:55] Holy Spirit comes he's coming to those
[46:59] who have the ability to receive this
[47:02] Revelation when he speaks amen for the
[47:06] Deep will only call to the Deep
[47:09] one
[47:11] and the Deep must be able to respond
[47:14] Hallelujah they must have the ability
[47:17] within them to respond use the word
[47:20] ability it sounds like it's something
[47:22] you're going to do but it's not really
[47:24] something you are going to do he already
[47:27] predestinated this will be in our lives
[47:31] that when we hear certain parts of his
[47:34] word immediately
[47:36] there's a man here that can turn on the
[47:39] light
[47:40] and you understand that you don't know
[47:42] why because it's so simple
[47:44] and it opens up your understanding to
[47:47] the word of God right see praise God my
[47:51] the book right the Seal of God God
[47:55] showing this is mine
[47:58] This one belongs to me praise God
[48:02] hallelujah yes sir the Holy Spirit has
[48:06] come only to the ones that are
[48:10] predestinated to receive him praise God
[48:14] because they are from the thoughts of
[48:16] God they're the genes they're the life
[48:19] of God in praise God hallelujah and they
[48:24] have in them that quality to receive
[48:28] Revelation they are receptors of
[48:32] Revelation they have this spiritual
[48:35] using the term Crystal to be able to
[48:39] pick up the Unseen sounds
[48:43] they're unworked by the human ear sounds
[48:47] they have the right to do it praise God
[48:51] so we come into the world with the right
[48:54] to receive revelation
[48:56] in the Bible we read Jeremiah 1 verse 8
[49:01] before I formed you in the womb before
[49:06] you were in your mother's womb you were
[49:08] way back in the eternities in the
[49:11] presence of God
[49:13] and he says before I even formed you in
[49:17] the womb I already knew you
[49:21] I already knew you you're not doing
[49:24] something new that God didn't know you
[49:26] were going to do God already knows you
[49:29] your every action your every thought
[49:32] everything he already knew you and I
[49:37] ordained you
[49:39] to be a prophet
[49:42] amen who does the word of God come to
[49:44] who does the revelation of the word of
[49:47] God come to the word comes to the
[49:49] prophet
[49:50] and therefore I I ordained you to
[49:54] receive revelation
[49:56] so that the holy spirit will bring the
[49:59] word to you and you'll be ready to
[50:01] receive it and then you'll go and speak
[50:04] it
[50:06] so he was predestinated to receive the
[50:10] word of God
[50:12] and all of God's believing Sons and
[50:15] Daughters comes with that same Spirit if
[50:19] we were to take that from the individual
[50:22] Jeremiah and expand it out to every True
[50:26] Believer it's really the same calling
[50:30] amen not to be a major prophet like he
[50:34] was but to have that that ability to
[50:40] receive the word for your age when the
[50:43] word comes you are willing and ready to
[50:45] receive it
[50:47] praise be to God hallelujah how
[50:50] wonderful to know that he is the same
[50:53] yesterday today and forever I don't care
[50:57] what church you belong to
[50:59] is that right God doesn't care what
[51:02] church you belong to it's us human
[51:04] beings that jump around and and fasten
[51:08] oh I believe this and you believe that
[51:10] so what amen you for all you know we got
[51:13] a hold of the same thing but you are
[51:15] looking at it from a different angle
[51:17] right as I've always told you about the
[51:20] man with the elephant one holds the tail
[51:23] and he he he he's just adamant it's a
[51:26] rope
[51:27] and the next one has the ears and he
[51:30] says what rope well your nonsense it's a
[51:33] fan and the other one says the two of
[51:36] you ah you just make me laugh because
[51:39] it's a post he's got a hold of the leg
[51:41] the next one said ah nonsense what are
[51:46] you guys talking about it's a horse he
[51:48] got a hold of the the elephant's nose
[51:51] you see what I'm saying all of them had
[51:54] a hold of the elephant
[51:56] but they only had a part and they were
[51:59] adamant that that's it but God doesn't
[52:01] care about that he cares about opening
[52:04] your eyes to see the whole picture
[52:08] not a piece of it he doesn't want you to
[52:11] be like that but you see if a person
[52:14] does not have that work right they
[52:17] become carnal
[52:19] they become Colonel and they run around
[52:22] they play around they rush to their
[52:25] parties and uh they're filled with all
[52:27] Spirits are lost and lies and cheating
[52:30] and robbery and uh stuff of that nature
[52:34] they think that that makes them smart
[52:37] because they can calculate and scheme
[52:40] and plan and trick others as such and
[52:44] that's their belief they are in total
[52:46] control amen now when you obtain this
[52:51] book right
[52:53] there is something in your heart that
[52:55] causes a hunger amen and when you hunger
[53:00] for him like that that calls again for a
[53:04] separation
[53:06] you want to separate and come out from
[53:09] amongst them come out from the midst of
[53:11] that see that's what it calls for oh my
[53:15] it calls for separation praise God
[53:19] hallelujah now if we're to look at
[53:22] brother Branham while he is here while
[53:24] he is speaking we understand clearly
[53:27] amen that he goes on here let me say
[53:30] this first now you see when that happens
[53:35] the church settles down
[53:38] it because at that point it cannot go on
[53:44] Esau was a good type
[53:47] but it cannot go on because once uh
[53:51] Jacob the Jacob said have received that
[53:55] but right they're scheming they're lying
[53:59] and their deceptions at that level can
[54:02] is no more effective
[54:05] because the Jacob group has caught the
[54:10] revelation of the word of God and it can
[54:13] clearly see what God is wanting to do
[54:17] hallelujah amen now when brother Branham
[54:22] said the church settles down you must
[54:25] understand that he was standing in the
[54:29] seventh Church age
[54:31] and he was looking forward at the church
[54:36] age that was coming
[54:37] and he was telling what what's going to
[54:40] happen when that age starts when you get
[54:44] into that age by that time the church
[54:47] will settle down
[54:49] amen and so
[54:53] while he was in the seventh Church age
[54:56] he is calling for separation
[55:00] and we know that every age had a
[55:02] separation because Luther separated from
[55:06] Catalyst Catholicism Wesley separated
[55:10] from methodism uh as such a an
[55:14] anglicanism he separated and Pentecost
[55:18] separated from methodism and these other
[55:21] things there always is a separation in
[55:25] every age
[55:28] but I'm talking about this age that we
[55:30] are in
[55:31] that separation is again in this age
[55:35] Hallelujah and we know that the
[55:39] separation comes when when the Jacob
[55:43] group receives the birthright
[55:47] and recognize that oh I have the ability
[55:51] to receive Revelation I'm seeing
[55:54] something that that they're not seeing I
[55:57] I I don't want to do it if I didn't
[56:00] bring it on myself but it's here and I
[56:03] receive it and the moment they receive
[56:06] that it creates a atmosphere of
[56:11] Separation hallelujah amen now you must
[56:15] understand when I say separation I'm not
[56:18] saying separation necessarily from
[56:20] people
[56:22] I'm not saying separation from groups
[56:25] I'm not saying you walk away from people
[56:27] because now you believe something
[56:30] different or you're seeing something
[56:31] more no that's not what I am talking
[56:35] about whatsoever you don't have to do
[56:37] anything about separation word itself
[56:40] will make that separation and that's
[56:43] what I'm telling you the time of
[56:44] separation is here amen it's not the
[56:48] wheat goes to separate from the shock
[56:50] the shock just pulls away from the weak
[56:54] because it can't stand it anymore
[56:57] it can't stand the wheat anymore so it
[57:00] pulls away from it so there's really
[57:02] nothing that you have to do in pulling
[57:06] away yourself it's the word does that
[57:09] because just being around you with that
[57:13] word of God in you because the world
[57:15] being quick and sharp you don't
[57:18] recognize it the word Discerning the
[57:20] word exposing the word revealing the
[57:23] word opening up manifesting itself
[57:26] through you and in you it is just
[57:29] something that irritates them and they
[57:31] don't know why yes
[57:33] yes it bothered Cain it irritated him he
[57:37] didn't know why but that's because the
[57:40] word was working mightily in his brother
[57:43] amen and when the word begins to work
[57:46] mightily in your heart it does the same
[57:49] thing
[57:50] oh praise God comes that time of
[57:54] Separation see because the church will
[57:58] settle down and I believe here the
[58:02] message has settled down
[58:05] I believe it has come true a time where
[58:09] when the message the prophet everything
[58:12] was right here that's wonderful but all
[58:15] the years now have passed it has settled
[58:20] down
[58:21] amen yes praise God and now we find out
[58:26] that this Spirit of Esau was there with
[58:31] the church through the church ages but
[58:35] now I spoke of you of how the
[58:37] accumulation of his wisdom his evil his
[58:41] knowledge his come to a peak
[58:44] and that Spirit of Isa was what they
[58:48] fought or we had to fight during the
[58:50] church ages but we are not now in the
[58:54] church ages
[58:55] that spirit is at a higher dimension
[58:58] it's in the highest stage of its
[59:01] manifestation
[59:02] we are now facing this Judah spirit
[59:07] or the spirit of Judas working within
[59:11] the Church of the Living God hallelujah
[59:14] because Esau typing you know he was only
[59:19] a natural brother to Jacob
[59:22] but now he's having to deal my friends
[59:26] with the Judah Spirit which was only a
[59:29] spiritual brother
[59:31] to Jesus and the rest of those disciples
[59:35] and that's where the separation is and
[59:38] the deception is
[59:40] and that's where we are we don't want
[59:42] the public say it but it's right in the
[59:46] midst of the church right in the midst
[59:48] of the message it's where the deception
[59:50] is not the natural brother but the
[59:53] spiritual brother
[59:55] that we have to deal with so we are
[59:58] facing those in spiritual Brothers amen
[1:00:01] and the battle now is between the spirit
[1:00:05] of Judas fighting against the spirit in
[1:00:09] the bride the Spirit uh the bright
[1:00:11] spirit
[1:00:13] fighting against the bright spirit that
[1:00:16] is on her anointing her and using her
[1:00:19] amen praise the name of the Lord Lord of
[1:00:23] God think about it my friends they have
[1:00:26] settled down and therefore we know they
[1:00:31] can't really overcome them things of the
[1:00:34] world out there amen they still have
[1:00:39] that Spirit liking their carousing on
[1:00:42] their dancing
[1:00:44] there still may be religious outwardly
[1:00:46] they still may come to church do
[1:00:48] everything perfectly but they got that
[1:00:51] thirst they got the taste for the for
[1:00:54] the dancing of the world and the
[1:00:56] carousing of the world he's saying when
[1:00:59] he's telling us what will happen in this
[1:01:02] age while standing in the seventh Church
[1:01:05] Edge he's saying the church will settle
[1:01:09] down
[1:01:10] and when it settles down it will be
[1:01:13] carnal
[1:01:14] and because they don't have the book
[1:01:17] right they will have these Tendencies to
[1:01:21] have the spirit of carnality
[1:01:24] wanting to do their dancing see and
[1:01:27] their manicure all their makeups
[1:01:31] amen Christina they are here wearing
[1:01:35] their little old shorts and clothes
[1:01:39] and men liking to go to pool rooms
[1:01:43] smoking cigarettes telling their dirty
[1:01:47] jokes and still claiming to belong to
[1:01:52] the church amen praise God listen there
[1:01:57] will never be able to overcome those
[1:02:00] things
[1:02:02] why he could he say to emphatically they
[1:02:06] don't have the birthright
[1:02:08] amen they don't have the birthright
[1:02:11] they'll do everything but they can't do
[1:02:14] it they'll never be able I tell you he
[1:02:18] repeats there will never be able to
[1:02:21] overcome those things neither could Esau
[1:02:24] and yet there will be religious
[1:02:28] amen amen you see he had to settle down
[1:02:33] and when he settled down he had to hold
[1:02:37] on to an intellectual conception
[1:02:41] so that he could still fight against
[1:02:44] Jacob
[1:02:45] and that is what's happening in the
[1:02:47] church world right now
[1:02:50] the message has settled down
[1:02:53] and various ministers
[1:02:56] and Men Women
[1:02:59] they're going into intellectual
[1:03:02] conception
[1:03:04] and there many of them don't even
[1:03:07] realize they're doing that but they're
[1:03:09] going into intellectual conception like
[1:03:13] that see my under settle down into an
[1:03:18] intellectual conception amen oh that's
[1:03:23] the same thing don't you see even now
[1:03:27] they have the feeling
[1:03:30] we will become an organization
[1:03:35] that spirit is in the message right now
[1:03:38] we will become an organization
[1:03:41] do you want to be able to have this kind
[1:03:44] of religious power you have to be
[1:03:46] organized do you want to have this uh
[1:03:49] benefit you need to be organized you
[1:03:51] need to have this then they want to
[1:03:54] become an organization amen hallelujah I
[1:04:00] want you to know friends
[1:04:02] that the Judas Spirit has moved up from
[1:04:05] its babyhood stage and now it's come to
[1:04:09] its adult stage of maturity here among
[1:04:13] the people amen praise God and God knew
[1:04:18] in our day and in our time now
[1:04:21] even we as Believers with our
[1:04:24] intellectual our natural Minds will
[1:04:28] never be able to see or detect that
[1:04:31] difference
[1:04:33] because it will be evil spirits
[1:04:35] operating in the religious Realm
[1:04:39] amen and doing those things amen
[1:04:42] hallelujah oh my you'll go along and you
[1:04:46] shake the hand of those things or these
[1:04:49] things and you'll have to call it
[1:04:51] brother
[1:04:52] you'll have to say God bless you brother
[1:04:54] God bless you Sister don't you think
[1:04:57] Abel had to do the same thing
[1:05:00] don't you think that he knew what was
[1:05:02] happening but he still had to do the
[1:05:05] same thing and he wasn't saying it with
[1:05:08] any kind of feeling because it was
[1:05:10] actually the fact it was his brother it
[1:05:14] was his brother but yet he knew that
[1:05:17] spiritually something was out of whack
[1:05:20] there
[1:05:21] amen he recognized it as such and so he
[1:05:26] had to shake his hands and say that
[1:05:29] praise God oh God bless you brother why
[1:05:32] they're in the message
[1:05:34] am I right they're in the message
[1:05:37] so I believe the prophet oh yeah I
[1:05:40] believe the prophet I believe the
[1:05:42] message I believe the word amen praise
[1:05:45] God so you have you can't go and judge
[1:05:49] somebody or just claim no you guys God
[1:05:52] bless your brother you got to go right
[1:05:54] with that because that thing is going to
[1:05:56] prove itself it's going to uh manifest
[1:06:00] itself somewhere in your walk in your
[1:06:03] talk or in your conversation with it
[1:06:05] it's going to show itself and sometimes
[1:06:07] it shocks you
[1:06:09] because you don't expect it to come from
[1:06:12] certain places uh like that amen praise
[1:06:15] God of course you know that some have
[1:06:18] followed the prophet many years amen
[1:06:22] they followed him and they can write
[1:06:25] books and they can make tapes and they
[1:06:28] can tell stories of how they or are they
[1:06:32] hunted with him and when they were
[1:06:35] hunting this Supernatural happened and
[1:06:37] that Supernatural happened and wonderful
[1:06:40] marvelous things happen and it's good
[1:06:43] and we love to hear that but they hunted
[1:06:46] with him they act with him they slept
[1:06:49] with him they even joked with him he
[1:06:52] even was a man that always was funny and
[1:06:56] he made jokes and stuff like that and so
[1:06:59] on Hallelujah they saw them signs
[1:07:02] wonders and miracles of that marvelous
[1:07:05] and wonderful gifts amen praise God but
[1:07:09] I believe and I tell you we would have
[1:07:12] never seen the closeness of this
[1:07:16] deception except for the Holy Ghost
[1:07:20] that is why
[1:07:21] I preached
[1:07:23] walking on the razor's Edge
[1:07:27] because that's where we are right now
[1:07:30] we are walking right on the edge of that
[1:07:34] the the king's sword
[1:07:36] amen where Hebrews 4 12 says he is quick
[1:07:40] and sharper than a two-edged sword amen
[1:07:44] it's so sharper than a surgeon's knife
[1:07:47] that will divide right down divide your
[1:07:51] soul your conscience your motivations
[1:07:53] and your intentions and God will be able
[1:07:57] to work it out like that so they're
[1:08:01] settled down and they'll begin to talk
[1:08:03] about become become we'll become an
[1:08:07] organization that's me saying and
[1:08:09] they'll begin to talk but he says we'll
[1:08:12] become an organization
[1:08:15] we'll put ourselves together
[1:08:17] we'll make a clan or a clique or
[1:08:21] something like that that's the way the
[1:08:25] church moves today and the spiritual and
[1:08:28] the colonel are still the same do you
[1:08:31] believe that
[1:08:33] it has not changed and it will never
[1:08:36] change it will go on that way amen
[1:08:41] praise God let me say quote this again
[1:08:45] the church
[1:08:47] settles down Hallelujah you see why does
[1:08:52] it settle down it can't go on
[1:08:56] the church ages are over
[1:08:58] the spirit of Esau that was working
[1:09:02] through not Church age it cannot go on
[1:09:05] it doesn't have the ability to go on you
[1:09:11] see for Esau was a good type of the
[1:09:14] colonel believer today he's speaking in
[1:09:18] the seventh Church age amen never able
[1:09:22] to overcome the world Amen praise God in
[1:09:26] other words let me put it naturally this
[1:09:29] way you're Believers that I knew in the
[1:09:32] message from early days to this day
[1:09:36] and they either went off on some little
[1:09:40] thing this way and you meet them again
[1:09:42] after 20 years
[1:09:45] and you know what
[1:09:46] they're stuck
[1:09:48] at the same place
[1:09:50] that's what really is talking about here
[1:09:52] they're stuck on things but they're
[1:09:56] still preaching about clothes
[1:09:57] they're still preaching about smoking
[1:10:00] and not that those things are right but
[1:10:03] that's their major the the clothesline
[1:10:06] religion you know
[1:10:09] they're still preaching about here and
[1:10:12] and and all these things and and
[1:10:14] televisions and so it's this the truth
[1:10:18] but the major thing is people to receive
[1:10:21] the word and they will do them things
[1:10:23] themselves by the revelation of the Holy
[1:10:27] Spirit and God's time and God season
[1:10:29] when he wants them to do it not when I
[1:10:32] want you to do it or somebody else wants
[1:10:34] you to do it but when the Holy Spirit
[1:10:37] begins to move on the individual in
[1:10:40] their heart they themselves are their
[1:10:42] own selves these things will fall off
[1:10:44] drop off they will just go away from
[1:10:47] them because it's God in their lives
[1:10:49] working it out
[1:10:51] they're stuck right there and a lot of
[1:10:54] them ministers end up preaching a
[1:10:56] glorified Holiness Doctrine
[1:10:59] rather than the revelation of the Holy
[1:11:02] Spirit but how can some of them do it
[1:11:04] when they don't even have it they can't
[1:11:06] do it that's what he's saying they will
[1:11:08] only go so far and after that what
[1:11:11] they're stuck
[1:11:12] there's nothing that can't go on right
[1:11:15] now let's move to another level here
[1:11:18] this message of brother William Marion
[1:11:21] radham has been studied to death
[1:11:24] I tell you they are studied it to death
[1:11:28] it has been searched out for every
[1:11:32] little German gem uh by mechanical
[1:11:36] means like by computerized and digital
[1:11:40] means there is not a verse a chapter a
[1:11:45] jot or a title that is hidden from them
[1:11:48] as long as they have a computer
[1:11:51] amen they're against it's being searched
[1:11:55] out let me use another term here uh it's
[1:11:59] been sanded out
[1:12:01] amen the dragon saying in the pond and
[1:12:05] every living thing that was in that pawn
[1:12:07] is coming up on the shore right they
[1:12:10] send out the message but they don't
[1:12:13] realize that there are other things in
[1:12:16] there was made in such a way not to be
[1:12:19] saying now oh my God place it there for
[1:12:22] his glory and for his honor hallelujah
[1:12:25] amen and when they're saying it out
[1:12:29] it settles down
[1:12:32] because the pond is now empty we got
[1:12:35] everything there's no nothing the
[1:12:38] prophet said that is hidden no more it's
[1:12:41] all of them before our eyes and so he
[1:12:44] says that church settles down this
[1:12:48] message has settled down but when they
[1:12:51] settled down they're settled down with
[1:12:54] partial understanding and when they
[1:12:57] settled down like that they go into
[1:12:59] intellectual conceptions because they
[1:13:03] have no Revelation so they have to take
[1:13:06] their conceptions and they settled down
[1:13:09] upon that in that way see oh praise God
[1:13:14] Amen oh yes quote brother Branham
[1:13:18] everything he ever said they can do it
[1:13:21] they can quote the quotes of brother
[1:13:23] Branham every part of it hallelujah amen
[1:13:27] to the point now that they have begun to
[1:13:31] preach and teach Christian psychology
[1:13:36] amen
[1:13:37] Hallelujah
[1:13:40] how that you can as a well-known person
[1:13:43] and I just use this so you can
[1:13:45] understand what I'm talking about not
[1:13:47] talking of him but I'm talking to the
[1:13:49] prevailing Spirit you can live your best
[1:13:51] life is that right
[1:13:54] it's all true
[1:13:56] but that's is the word has gone way
[1:14:00] above that sort of thing it's not you
[1:14:02] going to try and live your best life the
[1:14:04] best life is Christ and he is going to
[1:14:07] live his life through you so you're not
[1:14:09] worried about such stuff but they have
[1:14:12] to preach those kinds of things in the
[1:14:15] message it won't be said that way but it
[1:14:18] will be said that you need to be more
[1:14:21] consecrated you need to be more holy you
[1:14:23] need to do this you need to stop that
[1:14:26] you need to stop this you need to stop
[1:14:28] that you need to do this and don't do
[1:14:31] that and don't do the other but when a
[1:14:34] Believer is a real True Believer they
[1:14:37] don't have to think about not doing this
[1:14:39] or not doing that because they have a
[1:14:41] witness in them the Holy Spirit and them
[1:14:43] will guide them into all truth and he
[1:14:46] will teach them of these things that are
[1:14:49] to come if they are sincerely Sons and
[1:14:52] Daughters of the Living God now they're
[1:14:55] preaching psychology now I'm going to
[1:14:57] bring you the sermon today of how to be
[1:15:00] a real Christian
[1:15:02] are you going to give me now a blueprint
[1:15:06] of the dramatic arts of Christianity
[1:15:10] of of all the rules of how to be an
[1:15:14] actor
[1:15:16] are you going to give me the the wording
[1:15:20] the pacing the this the that and my
[1:15:24] goodness you should be wearing this you
[1:15:26] should be at this time you should be
[1:15:29] talking like this you see that's
[1:15:31] creating an atmosphere when it's coming
[1:15:34] down to the point where you can every
[1:15:36] person come to that particular Church
[1:15:38] they give them a curriculum
[1:15:41] Christian curriculum you want to be a
[1:15:44] member in this church you have to do
[1:15:46] this you have to do this you have to do
[1:15:47] that you're not pointing them to God and
[1:15:49] God will help you to do that
[1:15:52] even me as a preacher I'm only here as a
[1:15:55] Shepherd to guide you and say oh no
[1:15:58] you're going a little too far this way
[1:15:59] come back and come back in the center
[1:16:02] and everything will be fine but the rest
[1:16:04] of it is God speaking in your own heart
[1:16:06] it's God speaking in your own life I
[1:16:09] know all of this sounds very simple but
[1:16:11] you think about it amen praise God
[1:16:14] hallelujah amen praise God now
[1:16:18] I want you to be able to have a real
[1:16:22] Christian lifestyle
[1:16:24] see they're going to preach on those
[1:16:26] things and with the terminology it's
[1:16:29] going to sound like they're still
[1:16:31] preaching the message or preaching the
[1:16:34] word but they are already off of it
[1:16:37] because they don't have that Gene germ
[1:16:40] seed of God to give them that spirit and
[1:16:43] ability of Revelation right and that's
[1:16:46] where the problem comes from praise God
[1:16:49] hallelujah you see you the spirit can
[1:16:52] only go that far
[1:16:55] Hallelujah you know that he just went
[1:16:58] that far to Calvary and can talk about
[1:17:01] the blood and and Jesus and and and and
[1:17:04] seeing about the blood or how it flowed
[1:17:07] and Calvary but when you want to take
[1:17:09] him up to the real Pentecost no he don't
[1:17:14] want to go all the way because of all
[1:17:17] the ways to walk into the pillar of fire
[1:17:19] and he doesn't want to be there amen
[1:17:22] because he'll be this minor brain will
[1:17:25] be burnt up to a crisp so he stays away
[1:17:28] from that because it's got nothing to do
[1:17:31] with human conception praise God
[1:17:34] hallelujah amen oh praise God my just
[1:17:39] think of it they'll settle down to an
[1:17:43] intellectual conception
[1:17:46] the same thing the church does today
[1:17:50] we'll become an organization do you know
[1:17:53] that that's happening already
[1:17:55] in this message I'm not talking about
[1:17:57] the churches out there they're open
[1:17:59] organization that's not our deception no
[1:18:01] more that plane oh man we wake up in the
[1:18:05] days of the prophet and recognize that
[1:18:06] that's why we come out from that because
[1:18:08] that's open that's not our deception
[1:18:10] this is right here in in within the very
[1:18:15] message Hallelujah
[1:18:17] some of them in this message
[1:18:21] I'm not talking about being registered
[1:18:23] with the government so the government
[1:18:24] knows that you are operating as a church
[1:18:28] I'm talking about literally going
[1:18:31] and forming a small denomination
[1:18:37] do you know you can form a small
[1:18:38] denomination
[1:18:40] and you alone and your church could be
[1:18:43] that denomination
[1:18:44] and and then if any other minister comes
[1:18:50] uh or any other Church wants to come and
[1:18:54] associate with you you can bring them
[1:18:57] into that organization
[1:18:59] and then you end up with a lot of
[1:19:01] churches around you and then you start
[1:19:05] growing into a public open denomination
[1:19:08] but for years you can operate single as
[1:19:12] a single person owning or having a
[1:19:15] denomination necessary for you to know
[1:19:17] these things because that evil is behind
[1:19:19] the scenes working day and night working
[1:19:23] and the prophet says it's playing it's
[1:19:25] going to push every one of us out
[1:19:29] is going to push you out because you
[1:19:31] don't have the right to do this anymore
[1:19:33] because you are not in that particular
[1:19:37] group amen praise God hallelujah yes sir
[1:19:41] and so uh let's do the spirit can only
[1:19:45] come this far and another reason as I
[1:19:50] said it can't go any further because
[1:19:52] Jesus said it it's really the same
[1:19:54] reason
[1:19:55] Upon This Rock I'll build my church
[1:19:59] Revelation and the Gates of Hell will
[1:20:03] not Prevail against it building his
[1:20:06] church what on spiritual revelation of
[1:20:10] the word of God hallelujah praise God
[1:20:13] and the Judah Spirit has come this far
[1:20:17] hiding within the ranks of this present
[1:20:22] day message
[1:20:23] of this Prophet that God has sent amen
[1:20:27] and they're now coming to their end
[1:20:31] and they are now coming to their
[1:20:33] exposure and I want to thank God for
[1:20:35] that Hallelujah because they come forth
[1:20:40] and they operated and manifested
[1:20:44] in that way for so many years hallelujah
[1:20:49] praise God they're going to continue
[1:20:51] saying it is written
[1:20:55] it is written in the message
[1:20:58] I have it right here on the pages of the
[1:21:02] spoken word the prophet said it and it's
[1:21:06] written over there but when you have a
[1:21:09] conversation with them and you they you
[1:21:12] tend to go beyond the written word not
[1:21:17] differ from but go beyond the written
[1:21:21] word right there amen and show them the
[1:21:25] revealed word they just will tell you
[1:21:28] then you see that Spirit exposed they
[1:21:31] can't accept it
[1:21:33] they cannot accept it but your which are
[1:21:35] naturalized you're looking at a
[1:21:37] religious woman or a religious man that
[1:21:43] you literally could naturally admire an
[1:21:47] associate with but spiritually
[1:21:51] you can detect that thing that will not
[1:21:56] accept the truth of the word of God not
[1:21:59] according to me but according to the
[1:22:01] spirit of the Living God hallelujah they
[1:22:04] can accept it Hallelujah because
[1:22:07] they would have to have the spirit of
[1:22:09] Revelation on them to be able to accept
[1:22:11] it
[1:22:12] and when the word goes out they can't
[1:22:16] accept it
[1:22:18] I'm not saying momentarily they can't
[1:22:20] understand it
[1:22:22] you as a Believer will know that when
[1:22:24] you're talking to somebody like that
[1:22:26] that momentarily you know when I say
[1:22:29] moment there to me oh it might be a week
[1:22:31] it might be months it might be so but
[1:22:33] you know there's something there but
[1:22:35] right now they can't accept it but there
[1:22:37] are other ones adamant right away push
[1:22:40] that off they they can't have it they
[1:22:42] don't have the spirit of Revelation to
[1:22:44] be able to receive it praise God we're
[1:22:47] having a conversation here today and I
[1:22:49] trust the word of God gets true to you
[1:22:51] amen praise God hallelujah amen yes sir
[1:22:55] so we're living in this crucial hour of
[1:22:58] this last day deception praise God and
[1:23:02] it's very sad to me to see every day
[1:23:05] people believing this message and
[1:23:09] they're rubbing shoulders with eternal
[1:23:11] life
[1:23:12] just like Judas did they're rubbing
[1:23:15] shoulders with eternal life they're
[1:23:18] walking
[1:23:19] with eternal life
[1:23:21] they're taught in you and me they're
[1:23:24] talking with eternal life amen just as
[1:23:27] Judas was he was so near to eternal life
[1:23:31] Walking With Jesus every day the Lord of
[1:23:34] eternal life and he's rubbing shoulders
[1:23:37] with it God now has made it into a
[1:23:40] bright form and eternal life lives in
[1:23:43] his children in his people and their
[1:23:46] rubbing shoulders with it talking with
[1:23:49] it every day that they're going along
[1:23:51] while it's in God's elect and yet they
[1:23:55] are standing right there deceived and
[1:23:59] standing in religious era
[1:24:02] my
[1:24:04] Hallelujah
[1:24:06] we'd better be prepared
[1:24:08] because it's going higher and higher and
[1:24:12] higher until we get out of here
[1:24:15] amen and it's all around us hallelujah
[1:24:19] it's getting so bad Satan is starting to
[1:24:22] throw a lot of his Superman into this
[1:24:26] message
[1:24:27] you know some Satan Supermen are coming
[1:24:31] in this message Hallelujah is just as it
[1:24:35] was in the Old Testament when they
[1:24:38] entered the land they had Giants already
[1:24:41] in the land
[1:24:42] is that right Giants were in the land
[1:24:45] where you know we will call them
[1:24:47] intellectual Giants we'll call them
[1:24:49] message Giants we'll call them you know
[1:24:51] you can tip a fight anywhere you want
[1:24:53] but the Giants are here in the land
[1:24:58] and those giants in the Old Testament
[1:25:00] were what there there were the Bible
[1:25:03] says particularly and the Giants were
[1:25:07] like the the children and the generation
[1:25:10] of the brothers of Goliath of gas
[1:25:15] is that right it's the same spirit that
[1:25:19] was over there but it's come in here
[1:25:22] infiltrate the land and now it's
[1:25:25] multiply itself and it's moving with the
[1:25:28] spirit of spiritual Giants
[1:25:32] but God is not looking to that that was
[1:25:35] for a season God's looking at the humble
[1:25:38] and the lowly
[1:25:39] amen praise God hallelujah what do you
[1:25:43] think those those are brothers of
[1:25:45] Goliath of God were therefore in the
[1:25:47] land to fight against thee those who
[1:25:50] crossed in the promised land it's the
[1:25:52] fight against them why do you think
[1:25:53] they're hearing the message today it's
[1:25:55] the fight against the bride class the
[1:25:58] bright people the spirit of the Bride
[1:26:00] that's in this message of this hour
[1:26:04] hallelujah praise God hallelujah I'm so
[1:26:08] glad that uh that uh as while Goliath's
[1:26:12] brothers are over there in the promised
[1:26:14] land uh you know uh the spirit of David
[1:26:18] is here
[1:26:19] David's greater son spirit is here
[1:26:23] praise God and and he's ready to wield
[1:26:27] some stones again because the bride has
[1:26:31] a lot of stones
[1:26:33] and she got a lot of little rocks that
[1:26:36] she can sling away at him and I'm glad a
[1:26:40] part of that praise God that God has
[1:26:43] given us the rock revelation of the word
[1:26:46] of God that can take apart his entire
[1:26:49] being amen hallelujah amen praise God
[1:26:53] now I'm switching from that to talk a
[1:26:56] little bit about Hitler
[1:26:59] I know it sounds funny
[1:27:03] but you know
[1:27:06] um when Hitler during the last war
[1:27:09] whenever his troops got in trouble
[1:27:12] whenever he looked as if he's going to
[1:27:16] be losing to the Allies he would call
[1:27:19] for his Stormtroopers
[1:27:21] crack Storm Troopers
[1:27:24] that they would do a blitzkrieg that
[1:27:27] they will just say these were guys that
[1:27:29] were like you know suicidal they just
[1:27:33] don't care you know they carry out this
[1:27:36] work and most of the time they were able
[1:27:38] to win and overcome their uh opposition
[1:27:42] in every possible way amen hallelujah
[1:27:47] whenever he got the problem and I tell
[1:27:50] you he got a problem now and that is why
[1:27:52] I'm telling you he's calling up his
[1:27:54] Stormtroopers that's why I'm telling you
[1:27:56] he's bringing out his Giants that is why
[1:27:59] he's bringing out all his Supermen
[1:28:01] because they have to come against uh
[1:28:05] revelation
[1:28:07] and he has to bring out all of his
[1:28:09] Acumen all of the heights of his wisdom
[1:28:12] and knowledge through the years to fight
[1:28:15] against the elected seed of God
[1:28:18] hallelujah so he is uh standing here
[1:28:22] today he is standing here today in our
[1:28:25] midst with his intellectual wisdom and
[1:28:28] knowledge and he is imparting it to all
[1:28:32] those message ministers that are open to
[1:28:37] receive it
[1:28:39] amen
[1:28:41] and this men are sincere
[1:28:44] they are not they're not evil evil or
[1:28:48] bad man or anything like that
[1:28:51] amen praise God but it's just they don't
[1:28:55] realize what they're doing
[1:28:57] they don't realize what they're doing
[1:29:00] and I make it a little clearer to you do
[1:29:03] you know that came
[1:29:06] felt that he was just as much a servant
[1:29:08] of God as Abel
[1:29:11] he didn't think he was any left
[1:29:13] he didn't think he was wicked or he was
[1:29:16] evil he thought he was a good man
[1:29:18] uh just a gentleman and this rough
[1:29:23] crooked rugged guy goes with a rock and
[1:29:27] uh you know and he kills this nice
[1:29:31] white lamb and smashed the head and the
[1:29:34] blood flow out how could he be a servant
[1:29:37] of God he felt that he was much more a
[1:29:41] man of God even more than ever
[1:29:44] absolutely amen hallelujah I say to you
[1:29:49] this way do you know that Cain did not
[1:29:54] know
[1:29:55] that he was the serpent seat
[1:29:59] stop and think about it I never really
[1:30:02] thought about it uh you know he didn't
[1:30:05] know he was
[1:30:07] the serpent seed so he believed that he
[1:30:10] was just as much right as Abel has to be
[1:30:16] a man of God Amen and that is what the
[1:30:20] spirit that he came in hallelujah praise
[1:30:24] God and that is why he got angry because
[1:30:27] he felt he had just as much right to
[1:30:31] receive God's blessing and God's
[1:30:34] approval as much as in Allah
[1:30:38] he felt that so much hallelujah amen but
[1:30:43] when he brought his fruits of his labors
[1:30:46] and he brought all the flowers of his
[1:30:51] labor and
[1:30:54] um
[1:30:54] the fruits of his lips and bring them to
[1:30:57] God hallelujah
[1:30:59] his offering was rejected
[1:31:02] rejected by God outright and he just got
[1:31:07] fighting mad imagine that a man got mad
[1:31:10] with God you know a lot of people still
[1:31:13] get mad with God
[1:31:15] a lot of people get mad with God and
[1:31:17] they get mad with God first of all there
[1:31:19] is no God then when they get in real
[1:31:21] trouble all of a sudden there is a God
[1:31:23] because they're mad with God
[1:31:28] right I told you man I was just I just
[1:31:31] started preaching the message this
[1:31:33] gentleman owned a great big you owned
[1:31:36] the store and you own the store and the
[1:31:39] Man in the in the village or the town
[1:31:41] would come out and they they would play
[1:31:44] dominoes and drafts in front there and
[1:31:46] ordered their drinks and drink and play
[1:31:50] and then they would making jokes and
[1:31:52] they would talk and uh they see me
[1:31:54] coming up and say oh here's the preacher
[1:31:57] and uh what are you talking about
[1:32:00] telling these people about God and all
[1:32:01] this stuff there is no such a thing as
[1:32:03] God and this and that so I turned him
[1:32:05] and said no there is a God and he's this
[1:32:08] true Living God and it's one God and he
[1:32:11] says Ah nonsense he turned to walk away
[1:32:13] and they were fixing the road and there
[1:32:15] was a rock projecting
[1:32:17] and he went bang ah oh God
[1:32:24] I said I thought you said there was no
[1:32:27] God
[1:32:28] right but that's what happens the
[1:32:31] cryotan called to this God that they
[1:32:34] said doesn't exist then all of a sudden
[1:32:37] they cry out and call to him amen see
[1:32:41] that's the way it is my friends but you
[1:32:44] see brother the spirit in this message
[1:32:47] today
[1:32:48] it's like the spirit of Judas I want to
[1:32:51] be where I'm conscious of that so that
[1:32:54] you are not naive
[1:32:57] so that any and everybody that comes
[1:33:00] along I said I'm in a message
[1:33:02] I believe the prophet I I follow the
[1:33:06] word
[1:33:07] that you don't just swallow that
[1:33:10] I have been deceived by that spirit
[1:33:13] uh no doubt you met it too but you don't
[1:33:16] let that kind of spirit deceive you
[1:33:20] whatsoever amen hallelujah and all they
[1:33:24] were walking Judas Walk With Jesus was
[1:33:28] so that he could impersonate him
[1:33:31] whatever he was doing looking to see if
[1:33:35] he had a trick
[1:33:37] there's something to it a guy is smart
[1:33:41] oh my goodness he's looking for
[1:33:45] something
[1:33:47] thinking that Jesus was this is that so
[1:33:49] he could learn it and he can all of a
[1:33:52] sudden he can impersonate Jesus but it
[1:33:55] was not anything he could learn there
[1:33:57] was a life standing in front of him
[1:33:59] there was a person standing there and
[1:34:02] that you can't impersonate whatsoever
[1:34:05] amen hallelujah oh my think of it that
[1:34:10] colonel
[1:34:12] and spiritual will ever be the same it
[1:34:17] hasn't changed and it will never change
[1:34:22] praise the Lord amen praise God
[1:34:25] hallelujah
[1:34:26] now I want to point out something to you
[1:34:28] about separation separation in time
[1:34:33] in time
[1:34:34] was foreshadowed by
[1:34:37] Esau and Jacob
[1:34:41] separation again in time was God wanted
[1:34:46] us to know
[1:34:47] to be fight in Abraham
[1:34:50] and lot
[1:34:52] right
[1:34:54] it was also shown to us
[1:34:56] in Cain
[1:34:59] and Abel that there must come a time
[1:35:03] once that Birthright is received or like
[1:35:07] Abel did you received the revelation of
[1:35:11] the word of God
[1:35:12] showing that you are his amen
[1:35:15] but in our day
[1:35:18] God is you know that God goes with the
[1:35:21] times he doesn't change his word but he
[1:35:24] manifests himself with the day or the
[1:35:27] time we're in
[1:35:28] but we can see the day of Separation in
[1:35:33] the rocket ships that they're sending up
[1:35:36] into the moon and the space and
[1:35:39] everything else amen praise God and you
[1:35:43] know uh that this message has been
[1:35:46] fueled by The Prophet's message is what
[1:35:49] empowers it and fueled it how many of
[1:35:52] you have seen the rocket ship I'm
[1:35:54] talking about in Florida there how it
[1:35:57] goes up and the fire behind it and a
[1:36:00] long Pillar of Fire behind it and it
[1:36:02] goes up right in to the heavens amen
[1:36:06] praise God and when it goes up way up
[1:36:09] then all of a sudden one part begins to
[1:36:12] drop back to the Earth coming more
[1:36:14] carnal and coming more you know worldly
[1:36:18] slowly drop back towards and the other
[1:36:21] part takes off and goes to its
[1:36:24] destination that it has to go to right
[1:36:27] so I'm saying the rocket ship there is
[1:36:29] actually a type of our separation in
[1:36:32] this day and in this particular time
[1:36:36] amen praise God hallelujah praise God
[1:36:40] and I'm glad you know when the message
[1:36:42] came it got me all fired up
[1:36:46] yeah it got me all fired up my eye was
[1:36:50] on fire and anything that was near me it
[1:36:53] was just lighting fires everywhere
[1:36:55] spiritually speaking like that praise
[1:36:58] God and that thing just blasted me off
[1:37:01] as it did you and put you into another
[1:37:03] dimension amen you're blasted often you
[1:37:07] go into another dimension take off time
[1:37:10] countdown time praise God and it took
[1:37:13] you into this next Dimension praise the
[1:37:16] Lord glory to God but then after this uh
[1:37:21] this great tank of fuel uh typed the
[1:37:25] seven Church ages oh praise God oh it
[1:37:29] goes up that is what took you up if we
[1:37:32] didn't read understand or talk on the
[1:37:37] seventh chart changes what happened the
[1:37:39] mystery iniquity the mystery of
[1:37:41] godliness all these things coming up
[1:37:43] through the church ages it could not
[1:37:46] have put you into another dimension like
[1:37:48] that but take God he used that to take
[1:37:51] you there but the time comes amen when
[1:37:56] all of a sudden you see that cone
[1:37:59] amen it just separates from them ages
[1:38:04] it absolutely separates from the ages
[1:38:07] because what it's headed for Glory now
[1:38:11] amen the separation time takes place
[1:38:14] praise God hallelujah Up Up Up and Away
[1:38:18] praise God hallelujah and now it's not
[1:38:22] just those astronauts in the thing that
[1:38:26] decide it's the time to separate it's
[1:38:29] mission control and I want to tell you
[1:38:31] our mission control is saying get ready
[1:38:35] because separation time is here it's
[1:38:37] near be on your guard because it's time
[1:38:41] for the separation to start taking place
[1:38:44] it's already taking place but it will
[1:38:46] become so apparent that what you are
[1:38:49] saying what you are doing and how you
[1:38:51] are living which is not so much uh
[1:38:54] impressive to them now after a while
[1:38:56] they'll recognize it when the Gap starts
[1:38:59] to
[1:39:00] widen
[1:39:02] they think you're just the same yeah oh
[1:39:05] it's the same thing oh we all in the
[1:39:07] message but watch that Gap is widening
[1:39:10] and when that Gap starts to whiten then
[1:39:13] they'll realize oh my God we're left
[1:39:15] behind
[1:39:17] oh God have mercy left behind why oh
[1:39:22] praise God and now the mission control
[1:39:25] is the one that does that what we look
[1:39:29] at it's beautiful because brother sister
[1:39:31] something we didn't select ourselves to
[1:39:34] become astronauts
[1:39:37] we were predestinated hand-picked and
[1:39:41] then God trained God called you know we
[1:39:45] were pressurized we take all kind of
[1:39:48] tests in the water tank in the air tank
[1:39:51] and all kinds of pressure to see that
[1:39:54] you are really one of those amen
[1:39:58] hallelujah and that started to separate
[1:40:02] you from the rest of the fact amen but
[1:40:05] thank God that we were called out by the
[1:40:10] grace of God for this time that is here
[1:40:14] upon us praise the name of the Lord and
[1:40:17] we must real I'm going to close now we
[1:40:19] must realize it brother sister all the
[1:40:21] Simplicity of this that we are now
[1:40:24] fighting the Judas spirit
[1:40:26] right in the message
[1:40:29] fighting against the bright spirit
[1:40:32] that is in the bride
[1:40:34] and the bright Spirit of course is the
[1:40:36] holy spirit for the spirit and or in the
[1:40:40] bride says come
[1:40:42] and let him that is a thirst come
[1:40:46] you're thirsty come you're hungry come
[1:40:49] whatever it is the spirit is calling and
[1:40:54] identifying the hour that we are living
[1:40:56] in and what is happening in this hour
[1:40:59] aren't you glad you're a part of the
[1:41:01] word of God
[1:41:06] thank you
[1:41:08] musicians come print please praise the
[1:41:11] Lord
[1:41:14] Hallelujah
