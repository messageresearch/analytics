amen hear a word from the Lord this tonight amen I always get nervous and I thank God for that because if you lose that nervousness then you lose your Edge hallelujah thank God for uh we know it's a Wednesday night and evening time our bodies are a little bit you know but we're here to hear the word and get what we can amen and then we can go back we can go back on YouTube there our brothers sisters do a great job and putting it on YouTube go back and you know my brothers and sisters if a cow can eat food chew it up spit it out and bring it back again and chew it again we can take the word of God and keep eating it over and over and over again amen so we know you know I'm up here and uh I had you know I read this little quote there and it said uh coffee keep your mind sharp and clear and ready to go so I said you know what I'm going to try it I'm going to have my coffee about 5:00 and that's that's pretty late if I do have it so I'm trusting that uh that statement will come true tonight I know I'm feeling a little jittery but amen hallelujah but get what you can tonight by the word of God hallelujah and uh go over it amen and you you out there in uh YouTube land subscribe you know go over it you know the more they say that the more hits that we get on all our ministers and as the word of God Goes Forth that more that the YouTube will spread it out we want this word to be spread out amen cuz we believe that there's something special taking place here amen we believe that there's a good word of God coming out of here we are not the only church amen hallelujah I may sound like when we preach that we are but we're not the only church or the only group of uh Believers that are believing the word of God I believe God is revealing to the bride all around the world I don't think she's a majority though amen but I believe she's all over the world and God is calling her out amen hallelujah last time I preached I uh on the Sunday there I was going through a lot of different things in my body and I'm still going through some things I woke up this morning I sent a text to a couple Believers last night and I said you know if I wake up in the morning without any pain then I I might think that I'm dead so I sent that out yesterday and I woke up this morning and I pulled a muscle in my back and uh my hip I don't know what happened there I couldn't get out of bed I was like like Jacob you know like I was limping I'm going oh man what's going on here so I just went I said I'm going upstairs I'm going to study and see what the Lord does and uh I'm here I'm standing here amen and uh you know what we got to we got to press through Sometimes some things amen and we got to pray one for another amen especially in this hour we need to move this word on Hallelujah we have seen some you know the word on Sunday was was great we can see how God has transferred like Elijah the double portion down the anointing is here amen it doesn't matter about man amen it's God it's the anointing and he's here because of you because of me amen because he has a purpose and a plan to bring forth his word so I want to finish I didn't finish it there because at that time I was feeling really bad I was getting used to new medication and and I thought I was going to pass out here that's why I rushed off the pulpit if anybody remembers and um so I want to you know I had a little bit to finish so God just made it into a message so I want to read tonight out of Revelations 10:8 Jeremiah 3311 we want to talk about the voice of God and where it is today and what his voice is amen what his voice is and where it is today because it's not in a day past it's here it's got to be here because all the scriptures and even the prophets prophecies and what he have spoken said it will be here so I hope we identify ourselves with the voice of God tonight and where it is at my title is the Manifest of the voice of God in the bride in the bride Hallelujah that's where it's prophesied to be in this hour and brother Bram says I don't know who it is but I know there's going to be a bride hallelujah amen and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which is open in the hand of the Angel and we believe in this day we got to bring it to today we believe that those seals are open today they're open they're not closed they're open so God's word is open and available to manifest in our lives which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give give me the little book Hallelujah Lord give me the little book that should be our desire and our hunger and our thirst and he said unto me take it eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand Hallelujah there's the bride and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I ate it it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings Hallelujah let us go to Jeremiah 3311 I believe that's the bride in this hour and in this day Hallelujah but you know the bride said give me that book and the bride took it and she ate it the word it was sweet in her mouth I mean this Revelation is sweet when it strikes you amen but oh man if you just let it sink down and let it take control and let the Lord the word be the Lord of your life it gets a little bitter Jeremiah 33:11 the voice of Joy the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the Bride the voice of them that shall say praise the Lord of hosts for all for the Lord is good for his mercy endureth forever and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord and that's what we've been hearing bring your praise bring your shout here this morning tonight amen amen shake off the tiredness give him the praise that deserve to his name he is worthy amen hallelujah for I will cause to return the captive of the land at as at the first sayeth the Lord or he'll deliver his people he'll deliver you tonight if you can only believe and ENT enter in let us pray father thank you for the reading of your word oh your word is everything help us tonight father Lord put us behind the cross let when you look down at us tonight Lord look through the red blood of Jesus Christ the Lamb of God oh God look through the blood tonight father and bless us and speak to our hearts in Jesus name amen you may be seated Hallelujah glory to God speak in here brother Bram 1963 we're going to take some scriptures his Bible study tonight and we're going to try to line up the quotes with the scripture amen we're going to see tonight that you know the word came first like we know what came first the church or the word the word came first Hallelujah and what came first the message of the hour or the word the word came first and the prophet always point us back to the word and sometimes it's a sad thing but we know more of the quotes than we do the word of God and that's why people misinterpret the word of God because they take the quotes and they put their own interpretation on it we are to take the message of the hour and filter it through the word of God and when the word of God and the message line up then we got a perfect shot we're taught that we've been taught that by our former Pastor amen the word comes first and always is back not back to the quotes but back to the word the voice is the word of God Amen now the voice of God in the last days and God had promised to meet the need of the hour he always does that and we need the voice of God today now not back there but today this is our quote not 1963 but 2024 we need the voice of God today to meet the need of the hour oh my a present day God a present voice of God you know people are getting drugged up in this hour to look back at the voice there and not recognizing the voice today a delusion a deceiving power has been released to make people look back and not see what what God is doing today it's all prophesied it's all given to us in the word clearly laid out for the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and after he promised it we can rest assure that he will keep his promise that's the confidence that a Believer has in his maker that he promised to meet the need and today one reason that the church is in the condition that it's in is because there's so many voices and so many other voices to attract the church from the voice of god wow wow and a lot of these other voices and a lot of these other strange voices we call the voice of God but it's distracting the people of away from the true voice of God let us get into it and we'll see where the Lord leads tonight until it's very doubtful that many would hear the voice of God though it's spoken right in their midst they perhaps would even understand it because it wouldn't it would be foreign to the a foreign thing to them they have gotten themselves so much centered on the voices of the day and if we notice in our scripture reading that the voice of God was foreign to them and it become that way today that the voice of God there are so many other voices and then if God promised he would give us that and if other voices are contrary to the voice of God then it must be the voice of the enemy confusing us that we would not understand the voice of God when it's spoken wow you talk about deception remember with in the Garden of Eden Satan took the word he took the word and all these other strange voices are taking the word and trying to interpret it voices let's talk about voices for a minute so I can lay a background so you may understand where I'm going a voice is a tool that transports us into the future and we can see that everything that's been spoken Jesus would have not come if there wasn't a prophet back in Isaiah that spoke and said a virgin shall conceive his name Shall be Called Emmanuel God With Us so the voice is always speaking the future into existence and what God has spoken if you know your God you'll see what he has spoken in these last days that those words that were spoken by a prophet is for the future it's for now today Hallelujah glory to God a future has more possibilities and more solutions a voice is a tool that can be used for we're standing up for what is Right rather than what is easy a voice gives you opinions a platform and gifts gifts you with the opportunity to have a prospect and knowledge on things that matter no two voices are the same each voice has something different to say we know that the body is many different parts and each is given a Measure of Faith to speak the word in our lives in and in the world and in a world that needs to represent freedom and democracy a voice is a powerful symbol of this and it is what has allowed people to protest in Justice to sing for Freedom or simply speak the truth a voice can be a source of Hope in difficult times using your voice for truth is important to create a better world everyone's voice matters and I believe that today are the Bride of Jesus Christ every voice matters and that's where Satan will tried to shut you up amen take that voice away from you when God is revealing things to you your life is a voice your actions is a Voice Hallelujah glory to God Amen and it is H Allelujah create a better world for every voice matters it is important not to let yourself become silent because when a voice is not used it prevents the opportunity for True democracy where each voice is valued in a peaceful manner voices carry Impressions and feelings and passion and excitement voices can transport anything whether it's a Feeling or a place or an idea that's how powerful a voice is Amen in a way voices are superpower if you know how to use it just like James says amen your tongue is a powerful thing and we must take the tongue our voice the words and use it in the right way Hallelujah a Amen brother Bram said what did he say go create your world speak your world and go live on it your atmosphere Hallelujah your Victory your your overcoming amen it's going to come by faith and and and when it comes by faith then you got to speak it Hallelujah let us move on here voices can be used to create change now I hope you're typing this put your spiritual thinking caps on type this back to our calling and our position in Christ people can take anything or any material thing from you but they cannot take your voice or they cannot take your faith Satan could do what he wanted to job and take what he wanted from job but when it came down to it just like brother Brandon when it came down to it blessed be the name of the Lord he giveth he taketh blessed be the name of the Lord H shall not the judge of the earth do right he's the Creator Hallelujah glory to God amen hallelujah voices are meant to encourage other voices are used to unite some to support each other one of the most powerful things someone can do is use their voice hallelujah amen again in John 1613 Jesus speaking here how bit when he the spirit of Truth the word is come he will guide you into all truth Thy word is truth and he shall not speak of himself but who whatsoever he shall hear the word of God that shall he speak the word this is you this is me he says you'll know in that day that I'm in the Father the father in me and I am in you God is testifying of his word amen that he is in you Hallelujah glory to God and he shall show you things to come oh yes the spirit bringing the word of Prophecy I want you to note very carefully that Jesus did not say that the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues interpretations prophecies or shouting or dancing he he said the evidence would be that when you would be in the truth you would be in the word of God for your age you would catch the Revelation what God is doing today that is the evidence of the Holy Ghost because he can only lead you to fulfill what he's given us in this day oh my there are so many that are fulfilling a day gone past so many that are living in the prophets day Pentecostal day Baptist day Luther Day claiming to be Christians claiming to have the word of God but today is a different age it's a different day it's the bride's day Hallelujah do we know the prophecies that God has given in this hour Hallelujah because he the spirit of Truth can only lead you to what he is fulfilling in this hour he'll never lead you to another age never that's another voice those are strange voices but the voice of God in this hour will lead you to the word that is being fulfilled today hallelujah amen evidence has to do with receiving That Word pergamus Church age Hebrews 3:1 he is the high priest Upon Our confession Upon Our confession he is the high priest what are we confessing what are we speaking I'm not just talking about you know speaking stupid or foolish things I'm talking what are we saying when we speak the written word what what are we saying that's been revealed to us in this hour our life speaks our fellowship speaks you can't help but what's inside of a man or a woman will come out in your voice and what's revealed to you he's the confession Mark of 11:24 whatever you desire speak and it will be given do not confess negative thoughts in your mind rather Speak life the life for the age to every situation around you Hallelujah everything around you I mean we should be at that place of maturity in this hour that where we recognize when the enemy comes in and then we take the word of God and we deny him we reject him we resist him by what by speaking the truth the word in this hour I've seen him so many times attack and I just sit there instead of oh lean into fear lean into doubt lean into to this Comfort or that comfort I recognize what's going on and I said no I don't want this this is not part of me this is not part of the word of God and I rebuke the thing and if I have to stay there like the the the shotgun with in the rabbit's hole and stay there amen thus sayeth the Lord thus sayeth the Lord I'll stay right there until that thing moves I mean I prayed for an hour sometimes when a devil's attacking me and I prayed for an hour and and I stay right there until it moves and speak that word oh he attacks you in your mind and tries to put doubt but you need to take that word and speak it Hallelujah Proverbs 3:20 I mean 3032 speak good to your spouse your children your brothers and your sisters and you will see the fruits of it germinate Hallelujah the Bible says that we when we declare a thing it shall come to pass if we continue to believe in job 22:28 if we continue to believe what we speak what we declare around our lives it will come to pass when we don't know unless God reveals it but we stay right there on our confession because he is the high priest of our confession he looked at what you said you say unto this mountain you speak to the rock you speak to the situation and he is the high priest upon your confession and what you're speaking it's not for us to figure out how he's going to do it when he's going to do it it's us to believe believe that he's going to do it because he's already done it like I always said when God reveals something it's already here it's not coming amen it's here the Rapture is not coming it's here it's manifesting here right now and when this Dimension starts breaking and the scales start lifting off your eyes amen and your heart heart starts receiving the word because your life is getting into position you'll recognize that the Rapture is here that's what's going to move us into the translation the angels are here the cloud of witnesses are here tonight because this flesh amen blocks us from seeing it but God said your soul will see it have you noticed in Revelations 22:7 and he said the spirit and the bride say come and let him that hear it say come see the bride speaks the same word as does the spirit she is a word bride proven she has the spirit in every Church age we hear these words he that had an ear let him hear you see everyone in the message will hear the word they will hear words they will understand words but Jesus is saying here he that had an ear let him hear so there's something different than what the ministers are saying there's something different that's being revealed to the Bride of Jesus Christ that is opening up to her heart remember Jesus said flesh and blood has not revealed it unto you man cannot reveal it theology cannot reveal it to you but my father the spirit has revealed it unto you and he's saying he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying I believe the spirit is saying something Hallelujah glory to God what the Spirit say to the churches the spirit gives the word if you have the spirit you will hear the word for your age and those true Christians took the word for their age now we always when we listen to this we always think in our minds I heard the word for my age I heard brother brandham I heard brother brandham that's the word for my age and then they live contrary to the word of God they're not producing the word of God no like we said at the beginning God provides the voice for every hour and he meets the need of the hour this is a different age this is the bride age so what are you saying brother Tim the the message is different than what God's revealing now no it's not different God is revealing his word to this age and the portion of word that he spoke remember Jesus in his ministry did he fulfill everything no he didn't fulfill everything he fulfilled what he needed to fulfilled and the rest was left off for the church to fulfill did the prophet fulfill everything no it was left off for us the bride in this age to fulfill and that's what I'm talking about there ain't no great man there ain't nobody coming with some great Revelation it's what God has released through the opening of The Seven Seals that are here and he the spirit of Truth is taking it and revealing it to us as individuals that's what's taking place he that has an ear to hear the spirit the voice of God for this day Ephesians 4:29 let no corrupt communication proceed up to your mouth but he but that which is good and use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearer and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed until the day of your Redemption Hallelujah we always think oh grieve not the holy spirit let no corrupt communication come out of your mouth so we think oh we're talking about this we're talking about that or we're cursing or we're swearing yeah those things are bad the Holy Ghost won't allow you to say those things amen or he'll deal with you but he's not talking about that here hallelujah he's talking about don't speak another word for another age keep silent until you see the word for this age in this hour and God will reveal it to you what he's doing doing if you are in the word and you're listening to the word he'll reveal it to you he promised it I can't bring up all the scriptures that around it if you're in the Bible and you know your Bible oh you must more more people know the quotes more people know what brother Bram said than what Jesus said and what the word said what the Apostle said just like when brother Bram said more more know about Santa Claus than Jesus Christ and shame on them but shame on the message when you know more about the quotes than you know about him it's KN him that's life you say oh brother Tim the message is the Bible my brothers wake up wake up we have to take the quotes and not preach preach and put our interpretation on the quotes those quotes when you preach got to line up with the word and the word got to testify of it because we know as we've heard and I'm bold to say it because it's been spoken already as Paul said I'm bold they were bold to speak and we've heard Hallelujah that brother Brandon had to grow oh my he had to grow in faith Hallelujah even himself said that I know for sure in the token message go back to it I know for sure that this token message that God gave me those seals in those Church age were directly from the from God himself all the other things were just inspired you know what all the other things were just a man of God growing into his position and recognizing his position did he not say could this be the Malachi 45 and then he saysure down the road sure looks like Malachi 45 and then when he came to the end he said this is Malachi 45 so there was a progression of faith that was taken place oh my listen tonight Hallelujah hear the word of the Lord amen Proverbs 18:21 our words have the power to build up people and to give them life or tear people down and bring them to death spiritual death the words we speak can Inspire or encourage others while the same sentence can deflate discourage and Destroy and that's not just using negative words to them that's taking the word of God without a revelation and speak in death into them oh my no wonder I go through so many battles you know I get these messages and I get these things in my and I said Lord Jesus help me Lord I feel like I'm you know I feel like it maybe it's not to you that you know you're just so hard and you know but I can't be anything that I'm not I got to be who I am and let let the chips fall as they say we Falls let it falls James 1:19 Hallelujah my dear brothers and sisters take note of this everyone should be quick to listen slow to speak oh my we don't even listen but we speak so quick listen and slow to become anger because human anger does not produce the righteousness of God's desires when your anger comes forth it blocks your thinking and what you're speaking that's why they say never speak out of anger shut your mouth go for a walk husbands wives shut your mouth and go for a walk Hallelujah Matthew 12 3637 but I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken for by your words you will be acquitted and by your words you'll be condemned Hallelujah the voice of God will always always Echo his word amen always Echo his word the voice of the Lord is powerful the voice change his voice changes everything David said in the Psalms 19:14 May these words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing unto you Hallelujah When what when you're quoting scriptures no God is looking for you to the father is looking for you to speak back amen the revelation of the hour Hallelujah he that has an ear let him hear speak back what the spirit is sp saying in this day when you recognize this is the age of great recognizing who you are recogniz people are recognizing izing people are realizing out there people are seeking amen for higher truth higher spirituality they're looking to find themselves out there well it's only a perversion of what God is doing in the bride she's seeking more of him in her and that's what's pleasing to God when you pray not empty words but when you pray to the father saying father I recognize what you're doing in this hour I recognize what you're speaking to me like Jesus prayed he says father Hallelujah I know what you want done for me Hallelujah not my will but thy will be done I see it father Hallelujah glory to God the voice of the Lord splits splits the mighty Cedars Hallelujah God's voice can pierce the hardest of Hearts the voice of the Lord strikes with bolts of lightning God's voice will bring conviction not condemnation not fear not doubt not guilt but conviction why when brother BR seen the bride getting out of line he screamed out get back in line that's the conviction when the word comes forth my son my daughter get back in line walk in line with the word the revelation of who you are in this hour in this day I am doing a work my word won't return void but it will accomplish what is set forth to do oh my we got to shake ourselves amen are we part of this word are we part of this Redemption are we part of this plan in this hour get to a place where you settle it for sure Hallelujah glory to God when I pray for the minister I don't pray for the minister God give him a good message I pray for the minister because I want the minister out of the way and I want to hear the voice of God that's why I pray I've recognized that in this hour that no man could help me if I can recognize that I'm no good in myself and I can see that I'm here tonight not because anything I've done my God I can see it when when Paul said that oh Wretched Man that I am who's going to save me my God hallelujah now listen the voice in the beginning was was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made human flesh and dwelt among us and we behold his glory as the only begotten of the father hallelujah amen the voice of God is the word of God the word of God is God before the beginning was the word of God and God his voice are one him and his voice and the word are one very important Matthew 4:4 this is account of temptation of Jesus in the wilderness when he was tempted he to turn the stones into bread he answered it is written he didn't say look at me who I am do you know who I am he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every Rema word word that comes from the mouth of God hallelujah and I turned to see a voice that spoke with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks like one like the son of man clothed with his garments down to his foot and gir about with paps with a golden grit Revelations 1 12-13 the voice of the alpha the beginning in Genesis is the same voice of the Omega the end in Revelation is the same voice the same word

brandom after he preached a token and a token must be applied in your life you must have that token we forget about those messages we don't want to preach those messages you must have the token and after he preached that he said you must get desperate once desperate a he said and I quote a constant state of desperation oh my my brothers I know every waking moment that I have I'm in a constant state of desperation does it put me in fear I'm not talking about that I got peace like a real I got joy unspeakable but there's something inside of me the word of God is saying I must fulfill I must accomplish I must amen overcome and that's what's inside of me that is greater than me that pushes me it's the life inside of me that is in constant desperation hallelujah oh where did the time go this just flying by for me I don't know about you glory to God I'm on page six and I got I'm going to have to preach another message here hallelujah obstacles of hearing God's voice Mark 43:7 listen

fell on thorns and grew up and they were choked out and plants so that they did not bear grain oh my my brothers and sisters to keep that ground tilled that's what we're talking about desperation keep

Hallelujah the word of God is being planted the seeds are being thrown out man Oh my Jesus in this hour Lord Jesus Hallelujah no soil God's word cannot be heard theology God does not speak today unconfessed sin anger Rebellion towards God that's no soil rocky soil obstacles where God's word cannot take root doubt why would God speak to me it's still here it's still here people are still struggling with that why would God speak to me it's because his word was planted in you not because of you he said my word return void I plac something inside of you Hallelujah I I I I I'm thankful when that Revelation revealed to me it Set Me Free I know I'm no good I know that that this flesh if it was left alone where what it would do where it would go you seen the testimonies I got a testimony too you got a testimony too and that testimony was God Awakening the attribute the seed inside of you and taking you out of that life you and bringing you into this so will God speak to you yeah speaks all the time all the time to you fear afraid of what God might say will have to do something difficult distraction too busy to take time to make a space of time to listen to God compromise soil God's word is choked circumstances difficulties or confusing experiences others the voice of others become louder than the voice of God hallelujah brother Brown speaking here in 1964 the voice of the sign the voice that follows the sign must be the voice of God speaking from the word for the age do you understand it there is a crisis of ignorance listen to what he's saying the greatest enemy of knowledge is not just ignorance but it is also the illusion of knowledge a thing that is or likely to be wrong perceived or interpreted by the senses a false ideal or belief people splicing selecting quotes together in a way that is not established in the scriptures we must not follow a human voice John said I am the f I am in the father and you in me John 14:16 I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide in you forever not for a time but your sealed to the day of your Redemption forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and he shall be in you Hallelujah I will not leave you comfortless comfortless but I will come to you oh glory to God there are traditional voices religious voices false Doctrine voices satanic voices false believed voices the power of tradition Jesus said you and your Traditions make the word of God of none effect that's a message in itself the power of tradition that we keep in our lives we're not to take the word like the Pharisees and Sadducees where was the Pharisees and Sadducees in the Old Testament where were they they're spoken of by Jesus but God did not set them up they were man-made Traditions rabbis were man-made Traditions if you go back in history a lot of man-made traditions chrans amen we take from the church ages and we bring it in here now and Jesus is saying you and your Traditions I'm not talking about Christmas traditions and all the Traditions that you have I mean when the word of God and the Holy Ghost and the new birth comes in your life it does it automatically it starts speaking to you it starts dealing with those traditions and taking those desires of the world your family your natural family all those things that he is not pleasing to him for the word that is in set inside of you to fulfill anything that gets in the way of that word that's inside of you he deals with it and separates it from you we're all different just like in a high calling he'll let other people get away with this but not you get away with it he'll let other people Prosper but not you but he'll he'll He he'll it's pleasing to him to supply your needs every day day by day it's according to the way God in his mind has planted and that's what the Revelation when it comes to you and what's pleasing to God Amen that when you recognize that and then at the end of The High Calling how many thousands of ways that God chooses to deal with you that may puzzle you Hallelujah do we still get puzzled in the things that happen and the way God deals with us but when you come to a place where you are pleased just imagine you wonder why the Bible says Rejoice through your trials and trouble oh my getting to that place I'm telling you there's great Victory happening when you can Rejoice through your trials and trouble where you can be pleased way the god deals with you Hallelujah sometimes he deals with you really rough to get you to that place Place Hallelujah brother Bram speaking here going to just pick and choose here as we're getting ready to wind her down and um the LEC in church age yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it's its own mouthpiece I wonder if the message has got to that place the message got to that place I'm not talking about the bride I have a clear Revelation and it's getting clearer and clearer that there's a difference between the bride and the message and I believe what I see my opinion and I have a right to my opinion I believe when brother brand said go back to your denomination and be a light I believe that's being fulfilled right now in the message where the bride is in that denominational spirit nickan Spirit go study what the nickan spirit is and that denomination spirit and what it really does and how it operates and where it came from brother bradam had to be the seven Church age messenger he had to come to them that was his calling but his life his Revelation never joined with them his Spirit never never joined with them but he tried to pull as many as he could in he was a light outside of that he was a light to the denominations hallelujah oh glory to God Amen yes it is for it says in the last chapter of Revelation 17 the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear directly from God as it did Pentecost now he has cried out in this last age you have the word you have more Bibles you have all the quotes all the tapes but what are you doing you're not doing anything about it but you're taking the word and dividing it and hacking it into pieces taking what you want and leaving out what you want and what you don't want you're not interested in living it but debate in it my Lord Jesus I don't got time to debate I never had that in my spirit to argue with somebody I would sooner you be cold or hot if you were cold or hot hallelujah amen let me just pass over a few things here then I heard a loud voice shouting across the heavens it has come at last salvation and Power and the kingdoms of our God and the authorities of his Christ for the accuser of the brothers and sisters have been thrown down to the Earth the one who accused them before God day and night Revelations 1210 Hallelujah God's words are wise Beyond human wisdom for he is the sour source of all wisdom but that doesn't mean that his words always make sense according to human wisdom or will be popular in the world's eyes spiritual truth is understood spiritually through the work of the Holy Spirit and sometime God's word sounds foolishness to those who don't know him people who are aren't spiritual can't receive these truths from the spirit it sounds all foolishness to them and they can't understand it for those who are spiritual can understand what the spirit means those who are spiritual can Elevate all things but they themselves cannot be elevated by others for who can know the Lord's thoughts who knows enough to teach him about his word think about it 1 Corinthians 2:14 for just as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts higher than your thoughts Isaiah 599 Hallelujah I think one of the main fears Christians have is that they will miss the call of God we need not to be afraid of that God himself has promised to those who seek Him will find him and those who belong to him will hear his voice Hallelujah those who seek Him in desperation every Wicked moment of your life in your heart you're seeking the Lord my thoughts my heart is not programmed it's not legalistically put on God oh man there's a life inside of me that's moving every minute there's a life that is growing inside of me oh my my brothers don't we believe that we can believe that the devil anoints people out there and lives in them out there why can't we believe that the same God has a desire to live and possess and have preeminence in the in our vessels oh my oh Lord the Holy Spirit helps us in this task as long as we are striving to know God intending to obey him and listen for his call we will hear God's voice when he speaks my sheep recognize my voice and they come to me he calls his own Sheep by name and leads them out oh he'll call you by your own name hallelujah oh you all got a name Hallelujah in his heart and he's calling you by your name name Hallelujah we've heard it many times when the word's being preached and it strikes your heart amen it's revealing something to you he's calling your name answer the call Hallelujah glory to God Amen Hallelujah and leads them out and after he has gathered his own flock he walks ahead of them and they follow him oh those bloody good friends my brothers and sisters he's watching he's walking ahead of you the Holy Ghost amen the word of God that is around your life that's prophesied around your life is going before you every day he's going up before you he's removing every trap every snare every that the devil's put in front of your place H Allelujah just walk by faith believe and walk by faith never doubt when you say father you are with me you'll go up before me today you'll do this you'll do that Hallelujah glory to God amen amen he walks ahead of him and they follow him because they know his voice they know his voice they won't follow a stranger a strange voice they will run from him because they don't know that strange voice John 10 3-5 my sheep listen to my voice and I know them and they follow me John 10:27 the evidence of a Spirit-filled Christian believer is to produce the truth the word and to receive the truth the word and to O and believe and Obey it have you noticed in the revelations 22:17 and the spirit and the bride say come I'm saying this over and I put it there for over and over and repeat it over Hallelujah and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth come see the bride speaks the same word as does the spirit she is the word bride Pro it she has the spirit the spirit gives the word for you have the spirit you will hear the word for your day your age and those true Christians took the word for their age oh they took it my brothers and sisters we got to take it too it's us it's not them it's us here tonight that's why we're gathered here to take the word for our age to allow the spirit of God Speak speak my Lord speak and I will be quick to answer thee Oh my glory to God Hallelujah the spirit gives the word and if you have the spirit you will hear the word for your age Hallelujah each age has its own elect and that elected group always hears the word and receives it and proven that they have the seed in them Hallelujah John 8:47 and he that is of God heareth God's word ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of God hallelujah the voice of the Bride there are many voices in this present generation there is the voice of human reason there is a voice of innocent blood the voice of of politicians and even the voice of the martyrs however the one voice that has not yet been heard in its fullness or entirety now listen is the voice of the Bride Revelations 1823 States the light of the lamp will not shine in you any longer and the voice of the bridegroom and the bride will not be heard in you any longer for the merchants were the Great Men of the Earth because all nations were deceived by the arts practice or the Spells of persons who are supposed to exercise Supernatural Powers through the aid of evil spirits this P this passage clearly outlines a season of time in which the voice of the bridegroom will distinctly Express clearly efficiently through the bride and a certain time for it to cease oh my where are we where are we throughout the Earth there is religious and politician spirits that the Bible identifies as mystery Babylon nevertheless in the midst of this ungodly system the holy spirit will release great praise and worship expressions of God's cre creative ability and distinctions of his true voice in the word bride today oh he will she will seek clearly his voice she will not be deceived if it were possible it would deceive the very elect where where just think about it where would it be possible Hallelujah come on musicians my last quote here actually I got two quotes here one one came inspired to me and the other one is brother bradam just give me a few minutes more and we'll be done perfect faith is not on the tapes no perfect faith is in the word of God and his word is in the bride of Christ and because she has the revealed word of God in her she becomes comes the voice of God for this rapturing age it is the word of God made flesh again today she is the final voice and God will reveal all the truth that will bring a body change to her and in her it is now the spirit of God in her speaking and crying out come out of her my people be not partakers of that Nicko and denominational spirit in the churches today has taken up the spirit of organism systems setting up their churches to duplicate and leaving the power of God in the word remember Satan said brother Braham said that Satan will try to make the church powerless formal lukewarm that's his goal and nothing down Through the Ages has killed brother Braham says the church but when they denominate oh we can never denominate don't be dis received recognize that Spirit now remember this Christ in the true church is the continuation of the book of Acts the book of Acts not any other book but the Book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukew formal powerless it exposes Satan revealing his works his attempt destruction of on God's people and discrediting the word of God right down to the time he's cast into the Lake of Fire so he's doing it now he's doing it today and where is he brother brah said he's seen it and he tried to cut that devil's head off that snake but it sneaked right in right down to the time he cannot stand it he knows now listen he knows that if the people get a true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be Invincible Army and they that get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church it's here it's already been spoken and prophesied we've heard it throughout the years Satan will be powerless before her he will be as a defeated warp today as Christ with stod every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell the Gates of Hell protect us the Gates of Hell the Revelation the Gates of Hell will not pre Prevail against the Revelation goes here goes here there's the Gates of Hell will not Prevail in your life will not Prevail you will not go down you will not be defeated you will overcome you will

stand Hallelujah the voice of God the manifestation of the voice of God in the bride today is when she gets to that place when she recognizes Hallelujah who she really is and I believe it's happening I believe it's happening but as the scripture as the as the prophet said there it's not in his fullness yet it's coming the time is coming my brothers and sisters you know what's happening tonight you know what happens every time the word of God's going forth the spirit of God is doing something in the Supernatural real the Unseen R and he's preparing her and he's getting ready for that time
