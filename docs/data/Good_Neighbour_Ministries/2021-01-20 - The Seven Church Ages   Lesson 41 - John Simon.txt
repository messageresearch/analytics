TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] what then what then when the great book is open what then when the ones that's rejecting this message today will be asked to give a reason what then yes my friends what then we will all have to make our choices now the question is being asked heaven or hell christ or chaos i ask you tonight as i come in the name of the lord that you will receive the word of the lord of course we are teaching on the doctrine of hell and the topic is is hell really eternal i shall now read from the book of revelation chapter 2 verse 11 he that had an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death amen gracious father we thank thee for the reading of the word and we ask that you will direct her thoughts in the streams of thought and channels where you desire us to be we surrender ourselves to the for service and those that should be online listening watching or perchance clicking on this broadcast may the great holy spirit capture their attention to the word take all the glory honor and praise in jesus name amen praise god hallelujah he that had an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches he that overcome it shall not be hurt of this second death now this is the spirit of god speaking this is the great holy spirit speaking and he is not speaking just to our age but he is speaking to saints of all the ages all of the church ages are included in this statement and this uh saying is to give us comfort in this time back then they needed it in our day right now we need it we need comfort we need his strength we need his guidance and we need to know that he is standing near with us he is saying to us don't you fear don't fear the second death in other words there is no hell in your future if you are a true believer a genuine born-again son or daughter of god a child of the king there is no hell whatsoever in your future don't even think of of hell it is now out of the picture he has blotted out every handwriting of every ordinance every guilt every shame and you are made justified by the grace of god and now you're headed to your father's house where there is joy and peace forevermore hallelujah of course we know the second death is the lake of fire remember jesus made the great statement don't you fear him that can kill your body but oh fear him that can kill both body and soul so he is speaking of the second death he's speaking of the death of a soul he is sticky he's speaking of the expiry of a soul the extinguishing of a soul this is what he's speaking you will not be able to be extinguished you will not be your life will never be able to be ended your soul cannot be wiped away by this second death it can't be burnt up it there's nothing that satan can do that can destroy your soul if you are a child of god there is no hell in the future of the true believer blessed be the name of the lord revelation 20 14 and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death you see because the grave claimed your your natural body and here your soul is claimed by those hellish nature and it's all thrown into hell death and hell thrown into the lake of fire or praise god hallelujah amen friends i tell you this is marvelous we can stand there for uh tonight upon the infallible unchanging authority of the word of god and say the believer does not go to an eternal hell to burn there eternally may i repeat this the believer does not go to an eternal hell to burn there eternally it is not in your future it is not in the book it can be found nowhere in the word of god amen in the first place hell itself is not eternal i repeat hell itself is not eternal or the lake of fire is not eternal it can't be eternal for it has a beginning it is written in matthew chapter 25 verse 41. how that hell everlasting fire was prepared for the devil and his angels this is not for the children of god not for the sons and daughters of god not for his beloved it is not for his elect it is not for the ones whom he loves and cares for it is for the devil and his angels were all his unbelieving associates hell was prepared for the devil and all of his own now we know that if it was prepared then it had a beginning it had to have a beginning and therefore hell cannot be eternal for the bible says it was prepared it had a beginning and if it has a beginning it follows it must have an end amen well some some will rise up and say well brother simon that sounds uh very uh simplistic and and you can say that and i can say something else and we can all have our own truth but we are not here to have our own truth we are here to believe god's truth god's word the only truth that will stand forever and stand the tests of time for heaven and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away amen now some will say the word everlasting really also me means eternal but you see everlasting only means ages to ages times and times and times that is what it means ages and ages you see because in first samuel god told samuel he was going to judge the house of eli forever but we know that doesn't mean that he will be there forever eternally at the house judging over the house of eli second kings 2 27 the solomon trust out the last descendants of eli from the priesthood and that was like four generations later that that actually took place so the word everlasting does not mean eternal neither does it compare with the word eternal for eternal means without a beginning and with no ending amen now if you want to come back to the real meaning of everlasting it means to the vanishing point amen in other words the god will deal with them until they have vanished away completely gone now another word that is brought up is the word destruction ii thessalonians 1 9 who shall be punished with everlasting destruction now everlasting destruction has nothing to do with the eternal for as i have said everlasting means for ages and ages but there is an ending to that means from ages to ages now in the greek the word destruction does not need destroying destruction not destroying constantly burning destroying burning and destroying like that but destruction in the greek means annihilation so it doesn't mean destroying see destroying means until the point of decay or to be completely destroyed and so on it means it doesn't mean that it keeps being annihilated keeps being destroyed over and over and over again see so the word is used everlasting ages to ages destruction to the vanishing point or in other words you will be destroyed maybe over a period of so many ages but you will be destroyed to the vanishing point fear not him that can kill the body but fear him that can kill both body and soul o praise god when the word eternal is used it always and should apply to god for god is the one without the beginning without an ending and he is elohim the eternal one the great eternal spirit that created all things the one with love serve and worship elohim he is eternal nothing else like hell is eternal oh praise god forevermore all glory to his name therefore friends since everlasting destruction does not mean being destroyed over and over again and tormented over and over again then we understand that there is no uh no purgatory there is no such a thing in your bible search the scriptures in them you think you'll have eternal life there is no such a thing as purgatory there uh therefore there is no need for indulgences there is no need for you to uh pay some a man a religious man a person to pray you your way out of purgatory therefore there is no place as purgatory in this bible it's not in the scriptures and it is a figment of man's imagination and a creation of the perverted religious minds that has brought such a doctrine on the face of the earth no need for indulgences if that was the case then the richer a man got then if he had enough money he could buy bribe or pay his way out of hell he could just pay for the right prayers and he would get scot-free so then the world would be in chaos every man will do what is right in his own sight uh believing that at the end of the way he has enough money and so he'll be able to pay uh the preacher pay the priest or pay the the the clergyman uh enough money and and he can say prayer and pray you out of hell or purgatory my friends there is no one trapped in an intermediary state at this present time so we must understand there is no intermediary state where people are burning and burning in a boiling pot of lava and screaming and crying and then as uh john spoke to martin luther and said oh if you can see your beloved mother burning in the fire and screaming but oh just if you were to give some coppers as soon as the coin hits the bottom of that pot a prayer goes up to god and your mother rises up out of hell what kind of uh fantastic religious fairy tales are being told in the name of christ there is no one burning burning burning burning in an intermediary state in a place called hell and having to be prayed out of there neither can anyone pay their way out neither can anyone bribe their way out none can buy their way out only by the grace of god only by salvation now you choose this day whom you will serve this is the hour this is the time this is the day we must choose make up our minds make our choice go down in humility to the valley of decision and ask god to forgive you of your sins cleanse you make you whole go and get baptized or come and get baptized in water in the name not in the titles of fathers and holy ghosts but in the name of the lord jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises on to you and unto your children and unto your children's children even as many as the lord our god shall call oh blessed be his holy name amen hallelujah think of it friends when we talk of the eternal life we speak of the words eternal life we are really speaking about god and when we speak about having eternal life in us we are speaking about the eternal god coming into our lives and making us his dwelling place listen this is the record that god has given us eternal life and that life is in his son he that at the son at life amen oh praise god you see only the children of god has eternal life for to have eternal life is to have a part of god in you which will then make you as eternal as god is eternal of course your flesh is not eternal but your soul is eternal then you wake up to the fact to recognize that if you have eternal life or you claim you have eternal life now then there uh you now come to the consciousness of it but it means that you eternal means without the beginning and without an ending amen and so the one that is in you is the spirit of almighty god the same one that moved on the face of the waters and called for the earth to come forth called for the the the birds the the animals the fish the sea the sun or to comfort at his word that same spirit of god has come dwells in your life and is calling forth fruits of the spirit from this tree o praise god and here we are bearing fruits of that spirit that lives in us by the rivers of living waters oh glory to god hallelujah amen glory to god oh my i'd like to make another point here if hell is eternal then the sinner will then have to be eternal to suffer eternally in an eternal hell that means he has the same kind of life in him like the true believer has oh my so then we will then reduce the second debt to punishment and place place and punishment but to my understanding by the bible eternal life means you go to heaven eternal punishment means you're going to hell and if that is so and such a doctrine is being taught by great exalted uh scholarly uh intellectual smart doctors of divinity theologians phds all kinds of degrees teaching doctrines like that of men and women people going to a sinner's hell to burn their eternity then if we had to take that thought then hell will only be a place uh the difference will be of geography because let me say this again here is the christian having eternal life given by god to live in heaven and then here is the sinner with eternal life to burn eternally in hell my friends this is the thought then if that was the argumentations of our exalted theologians then we see it's nonsense for it makes hell uh and heaven just a matter of geography and not of the state and condition of the heart and soul of that person fear not him that can kill the body but fear him that can kill both body and soul just take so many theologians teach such a false doctrine that hell is an eternal place where uh a wicked person goes to burn eternally then you would have to have eternal life to burn in an eternal hell as such but that is unscriptural for only god is the author of eternal life and he only gives that life or has given that life to his children who are a part of him oh glory to god hallelujah and we know that eternal life it's not a matter of geography but eternal life is in fact is a person the tree of life is a person and the name of that person is the lord and savior jesus christ oh blessed be his marvelous and wonderful place i'm so glad eternal life is not a matter of place it's not a matter of geography for wherever i am that life lives in me god lives in you thanks be to god that he lives in our hearts forevermore amen praise god so it's not a matter of a place it's the matter of a person in your heart and in your life it's not being in the cathedral it's having christ in you oh praise god hallelujah it's not being at the altar it's not taking the host it's not any of those things it's having the person of christ living in you oh praise god forevermore my friends if you are not certain that christ lives in your heart by faith no other person none other doesn't matter how holy how blessed they are or whatever only one person can give you and is eternal life and that is jesus christ our lord whom we need within our hearts and our lives god is eternal and he lives in us by faith and because he lives we live because he is eternal we are eternal praise be to his holy name amen glory to god i don't know how long the lake of fire will last i don't know but revelation 21 8 says that if all sinners will have their part in the lake of fire now the true interpretation of that word english we say they will have their part in the lake of fire the true interpretation says they will have their time in the lake of fire so the wicked will be cast into hell my friends there is no cert doubt about that that's a fact the wicked will be turned into hell amen and then hell will be cast into the lake of fire a place of separation from god what a horrible place to be what a thing to contemplate when your end will come and you're gasping for breath when you could hardly move my friends be sure your soul will sail away to the right place i know for the christian paul has said we have this assurance absent from the body we're present with the lord all glory be to his name he said i am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that wonderful and that marvelous day oh glory to god hallelujah amen amen praise god the righteous has no hell in the future they don't fear hell they overcome that second death already because god lives in them and they he that live it and believeth in me though he die in his flesh yet shall he live in his soul wow for he is a lie forever more glory to god hallelujah and we don't have to fear because we've been redeemed by god we've been loved by god we've been redeemed by god and we are in his bosom and that makes us more than conquerors through him that loves us lord god hallelujah when we sinned are we were sinners we had a great gulf fix but thank god jesus christ came into our life and became the bridge of life and he bridged the gap and brought us back into sweet fellowship with god in the evening time oh glory to god forevermore we who were afar off are now made nigh through the precious blood of our lord jesus christ thank god as the song says he ran trump me he ransomed me yes jesus has ransomed us now the word ransom is just like saying redeemed he ransomed or redeemed me now when some years ago i was in the southern sudan and that was a time where people were caught many hundreds and thousands were caught and enslaved however there were wonderful men of god here in north america uh one of them carl brumback and uh from the great crossroads uh meeting place and others many other evangelists in the united states that pooled a lot of money and went over into africa and hazarded their lives to go into the uh jungles or deserts and meet the captors meet these people bargain with them and paid the ransom or paid the redemption price and brought those poor people out of their captivity and of their enslavement oh thanks be to god my brother my sister we were in the same position and condition we were enslaved by sin we were enslaved by habits we were bound by vice we were bound by our own sake and everything else but thank god then jesus came and when jesus came oh all our troubles he began to wipe away he bought us he paid for us he redeemed us out of the devil's pawn shop he redeemed us from captivity to the devil and his evil arts thank god we are redeemed by the blood of christ no wonder the old samus said in the book of psalms oh when the lord turned again our captivity from from babylon oh we were like them that dreamed then was our heart filled with singing and our soul rejoicing hallelujah for the lord had done great things for us we're off we are glad all my friends i am overjoyed i am glad i hope you are overjoyed i hope you are glad i hope you are very happy i hope that you understand clearly and that it is settled in your heart that if you come to christ or if you are a christian and you have confessed your sins your faults to god surrendered your life to him and asked him lord please come in to stay come into my life cleanse me wash me make me into a child oh praise god forevermore and he comes to your heart my friend to live in it then there is no hell in your future and you are the happiest man or woman or person upon the earth of course you'll pass through your tests your trials tribulation so that god can shape you and make you take you down to the potter's house and mold you and make you into what he wants you to be but the end result my friends you'll turn from a piece of coal into a shining brilliant diamond reflecting the life and character of your lord and master and savior the lord jesus christ may the lord bless you my brothers and sisters may god bless you and
