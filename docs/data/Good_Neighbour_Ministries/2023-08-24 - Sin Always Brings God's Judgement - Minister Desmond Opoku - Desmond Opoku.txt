second time and they did it the second time and he said do it the third time and they did it the third time and the water ran round about the altar and he failed the trench also with water and it was and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came there and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac and Israel and of Israel let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel and that I am thy servant that that and that I have done all these things at Thy Word hear me oh Lord hear me that these people may know that thou are the Lord God and that thou has 10 and thou has turned their heart back again then the fire of the Lord fell and consume the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust and lick up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it they fell on their face and they said the Lord is the god the Lord he is the god he is the God hallelujah may the Lord add his Blessing to the reason of his word you babysitting Hallelujah our Lord is God Hallelujah he never changed yes he never changed our God is full of grace and mercy he always tried to bring us in line with his word but we remember being I always seemed like we are stubborn in our sinful way people always put God in the way in a way to bring judgment on us we instead of doing the writing we always find our own way that's suitable for us but God is God he has his word and nobody can change his way his word is the same yesterday today and forever nobody can change it it doesn't matter how you are how handsome you are how late you are how intelligent you are hard knowledge you have you cannot change the word of God it's the same thing the same day that he brought Adam and Eve on the Garden of Eden and he gave the word to them that word is the same he never changed his word hallelujah thank you Lord the scripture we really hear the children of Israel are the people of God their own heart the people of God's Own Heart that he brought them from Egypt is slavery he told them to stay away from the people that they are the life from the land that they are going there there were people there worshiping others and these others were worshiping they were worshiping Egypt he want to separate them from these adults God don't want no others he's a jealous God he said I am jealous even we human being you have your own wife that you love so dear aren't you jealous for your wife and the wife jealous their husband when they got it they embrace them they don't want nobody to touch their wife and their husband no God is jealous of you you are the children of his heart Hallelujah you know we see we have so many young people here I'm telling you today God is God I knows every one of you future Hallelujah don't rush yourself wait and see the hand of God in your life so find us you take God as your God in your heart are you working with him there is no fear Hallelujah have confidence in God hallelujah you want a wife you get a wife you want a husband you get a husband be what we're talking you're gonna see you you know okay I don't want to rush go ahead of myself Hallelujah I know when I say like that the young lady the young man they are happy they smile inside so God have something somebody for us yes he has somebody for every one of you Hallelujah Bureau was the same we were once the same when we came to the message we were the same like you we go to the youth meeting oh we had a great Fellowship Hallelujah brother Mike Glory sometime I tell you sometimes you go to brother brother Samuel house he used to live in Winona and we all find ourselves we are young people not young but we we were there why is you not married you're young around 29 30. that's where we are right at that time we go to the bush and cut woods and break the bread Simon put Brothers at my house for the for the winter we never we we always happy all what we have is to Worship the Lord so what I'm telling you today just worship God and God gonna provide every knee that you desired in your heart but stay with the word of God Hallelujah listen to your listening to the elders your parents they've been through there is no place you've ever been that we parents have not been there so when we tell you something listen Hallelujah God did for us he gonna do for you I don't know why I'm telling I'm saying this that's not my message right there I don't know but I think they need it glory to God amen when God gave them this instructions about about that that shall not worship any other gods before me when they went to the the the the the the the they crossed the land there was they started doing things that they're not supposed to do God told me not to do so they have one time they have a king his name is aham you know Ahab was was Israelite how he became a king as you are here we are all Christians that's what I was telling you about you young people became a king and one day he decided to have a wife instead of him to have a wife in his own town he's so congregation or he's not not congregation around where God dwells in the kingdom of God he went and picked up a wife from Egypt his name was Jezebel and this Jezebel LED Ahab LED through this Jezebel you see when you left the house of God and you go outside without the leadership of the Holy Ghost you think you're gonna bring somebody also uh somebody in your life that you're gonna control or you're gonna convert him to to be a Christian but if it's God didn't lead you and you go over there that's what happened to this King he went and pick up this woman the adult worshiper thinking that you're gonna tell him to be Israelite to be a Christian but it does not work so by the time you realize the woman's adult has overcome him and bow down to the other and what happened he led him astray and what happened not only him he started to bring in this adultery that God told them not to break down to the children of Israel by the time he realized the he caused a lot of children of Israel to worship adults that God warned them Hallelujah you have to recognize Who You Are sometimes good thing people think oh God is a merciful god so anything that I do you have mercy and Grace oh sure his grace is sufficient his Mercy is precious Mercy but it's also a god of judgment Hallelujah so what about you do let the Holy Ghost leads you Hallelujah he's God of judgment he will not allow you to tell his grace to be disgraced Hallelujah you know sometimes people shorten their lives for things that they do because if you're a child of God you're a child of God you cannot change as a child of God but if you disobey the word of God sometimes God will shorten your life to what to not to disgrace his word one time brother Abraham has a friend I forgot his name and this man was a drunker even some time goes to him he want the brother Abraham to buy drink for him one time he saw him so much drunk and after that the following day here that God take his child home he shortened his life so God is God is a god of judgment he won his people to be faithful to his word he cannot go against his word the word of God is absolute you cannot change it Hallelujah young people I'm telling you have faithful have faith in God God gonna provide everything that you need for you stay with this word you know some in the Bible so many people say with the word of God Paul never get married he never married the word of God he's a he's a he know that he's the wife of God the husband his husband is God but we are human God said what he said we have to marry and what reproduction you desire to get married get married but don't rush your life and go and take somebody that is not yours Hallelujah God have your match day he is more than a Matchmaker for you I don't know why I'm preaching this Hallelujah God is a Matchmaker Hallelujah God can see you handsome beautiful and just waited around oh come on God loves you have faith have patience he has a special for you you don't know how gonna be hey you can bring somebody way down from Africa wear them from Egypt weigh them from somewhere you think only here you can find a wife leave that your

something different Hallelujah Hallelujah are you happy tonight let me tell you be happy be joyous for the Salvation God has given to you is more than what you desire Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Hallelujah this Ahab made God angry very angry so when God saw that say okay you love my people did something that they're not supposed to do so he sent his messenger Elijah Elijah went and he shot the whole the whole Earth for three and a half years no rain no rain so I will there will be no rain for three and a half years until I call where the word of God is right now is in you anything that you call by your faith you will receive it Hallelujah this is the time have you seen around what is going on there God is building his children Hallelujah this this afternoon I had India they're killing a lot of Christians they burned their churches Pakistan the same way you see around what is what is going on they are not building the church all the things they do it is coming upon us remember we are we we I'm preaching now we're gonna hear this you have to hold the word of God more than anything that you need you know bro someone preaching what he said you're gonna speak the word and you're gonna get what you want you think it's it's just a joke you are the word remember when Moses was coming to Egypt God instructs him to build the ark and when you build the ark you told him to the bias King around the ark and where was the pillar fire the pillar of fire was hanging there inside there you cannot see through why you know we human being when we lost a child not dead or maybe missing somewhere and you can't find him we have you can pick a toy you can take anything decorate in the room you go there and you cherish that child that choice your daughter or your your son lost somewhere you always have find a symbol to picture your turn God use those barriers came around him so one day his lost children that that he has promised to come and pick them up he put that in there where are those badges King you are the badger skin that was around the pillar the Ark of the Covenant and God came down in the day of Pentecost what happened that Pillar of Fire that was hanging on the Ark of the confidence he gave us a sign in the upper room we came and hang on the top of their head so where is the pillar of fire now it's in you she right in your heart your heart is where the Ark of the confident you are the Badger's King that was surrounded around the Ark of the Covenant and what the purifier is is in your mouth the word of God is fire the whole world the greatest weapon who you know this this world and they said a ballistic message you have the greatest weapon how God destroyed the World by fire and the fire is in you the next time what did you do you use water the the the the water where is there the the water of the word is in you you have the greatest weapon that look our our own place there here you see that fire how people are running that financing you you can speak that word and anything can happen remember Elijah the word of God was in Elijah When the Children was they were bullied he must suffer what did he do he caught a bear to what to destroy them how did he how did he call it by the spoken word this spoken word is in you you are more than what you think you want a husband speak you want a wife speak and describe the shape and everything that you want the beauty the character is in your mouth it's in you Hallelujah so what do you have to fear sisters brothers that I'm talking about the teenagers do not fear if you have a desire to Merit God will give it to you Hallelujah we serve God that the world never see the work of God like this before and this is coming it's coming from her you Hallelujah look to yourself you're sitting down here humbly very humble desire God you are sitting here for what you are sitting here to worship God you think God did not please he praise you he's very pleased this this Modern Age especially you young people is very hard for them to come to the church and sat down Sunday Tuesday Wednesday even your homework will listen to the messages it's not common you see God does not see you see Michelle you're sitting there yet since I know you when you are a little girl both of you come here little girl with a sister Sharon you've been playing this piano so many years you and your sister sing it all the time he said God cannot see that God remember everything that about you you children of God here he never forget Hallelujah God is God he never forget everything I'm sorry I God is taking my message to you young people today hallelujah thank you Lord amen God is pleased with you young people here Hallelujah amen you know when Elijah came you shut down the world for three and a half years and it reach a Time you know when he shutdown they started bringing him they forget because of their sin God shut down the whole Earth Day they are seeing as other worshiping may God angry and shut them down they can't get water no water no food drought because until I call the word of God is in your mouth until you call build yourself there's a Time coming you're gonna see yourself Who You Are you cannot be you cannot do anything for yourself but God is going to build you God is in you but you have to recognize the god that itself is real that's why if you pray with fire fire will burn you don't play with fire if you play on fire fire will burn you you stay away from the word of God God will give you mercy and Grace for a certain period of time but remember you have to repent and come back to him God always give Israelites a chance to repent and come back to him if you read the Bible all the time we forgive them all the time he forgive them all the time he forgive them they do the same thing and go back but now Joshua time yes we are going home we got to prepare no more time Hallelujah if you stay aware that we're gonna leave you there is going home time Brethren this is not a joke this is real Hallelujah so what Elijah did is they blame Elijah said he is the trouble he's the one who caused the trouble that there's no rain and and Elijah said I'm not a trouble you are the trouble because you disobey God so what he did he call All The Jezebel those people worshiping the others he brought them down he want to see the other that they worship if they can help them India is good at all let them prove himself so he gathered them that's why we read the Bible there is what he said he make them he bring the altar he put a sacrifice water wood and everything inside it said put more for you put him off put more water put more you know when you soak wood with water it's very hard to to burn it everybody know if the wood is not not uh it's not dry it's very hard to put a match there to to light the wood so he want to prove them that the adult cannot help them so he did that and when he did it he said if you people can bring the fire can your other can bring a fire to burn this offering I would leave my God and save your God see this is the word eh if you leave God there is nothing out there for you it's death it's death so when that thing happened they couldn't do it they cut themselves they do all kind of thing you see now the churches they do everything thinking that God is there but God is out from their Camp God is here right now he's speaking to his people so a rich important a certain a certain point of time Elijah said okay God told them what to do he said wipe all of them out so it's okay you set aside Elijah wait till the time of sacrifice of God I ran through the cross said you guys done in part and meanwhile he set up the people around them don't let anybody run away from here because they couldn't do what they're supposed to do if you couldn't do what he's supposed to do you have to get a punishment if you go to school and he give you the teacher put a something on the board and he gave it to you that's something that he attacked you before and and you couldn't pass what do you do you give me zero so he has to give them zero so Elijah spoke the word of God and called God and God came down and burned the sacrifice and lick all the water everything they said because he's saving the others the adults go hate he cannot help you while all of them up you took all of them out he white of them so if you stay away from the presence of God what is what what next that so I'm telling you tonight young people stay with the word of God don't think that God never late one day to go a thousand years is God is about maybe how many years one day so he never late how many times how many how old Abraham said I had a baby 90 or 99 so what is the age to you come on don't rush yourself God has something special people for you people especially our men special women they are everywhere you gotta call it out never be discouraged don't be dismayed look look at your faces you young people beautiful handsome you think wow wonderful thank you Lord for these young people hallelujah bless everybody let them give them a hand Hallelujah amen glory to God tonight they took my message away from me Hallelujah glory to God God gave me another direction that is not my notes Hallelujah I have a special message I'm bringing but now I can go Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus you know God does not make mistake God has sent faithful Ministries to what to guide you to lead you if you listen you'll be blessed if you don't listen you have a problem you understand listen to your parents they loves you listen to your elders you need a cancer something that is missing your mind come on your parents if your parents is not a the deacons are there they can help you anything that you need any question that indeed you are our children you are allowance as we are in the loins of God Hallelujah we love you so much dear Hallelujah you see especially a woman you can't teach the man we sometimes we compromise by the woman hold the baby and somebody tried to come and touch that baby a stranger you have a problem in your hands you know one time brother Abraham says something that this old lady very old lady he traveled her son and something happened to the tie and then the sun went down there to fix the tide and the car where he was done the car slipped and the whole car the man the man went down and the car the jack sleep and it fell on the sun this only the 18 year old lady you know what he did he went to the front of the car and lift that car up Hallelujah that's inspiration for women about their children the same thing about God we are God children he said war unto anyone who touched my anointed you are anointed children of God and God is jealous of you Hallelujah you are not just a number of people walking up and down the pillar of fire is in you you can speak the word and things will happen it's coming up God is building his church the whole world is coming after us and we are the bride of Christ and nobody can touch us so God is building us Mighty Army glory to God amen when God give you this work and the people don't listen not nothing left from him to do other than judgment he bring his judgment on you that's not God I think that's not that's not God God problem is your problem he give you a guideline and he'll give you Grace a message but you don't want to tell you don't want you to think Grace to be disgraced Hallelujah he's a consuming fire the fire is in you and if you pray with the fire will bring you Hallelujah thank you Lord you know Satan love to blame us the same way they were blaming Elijah that Elijah was the trouble Elijah was in the trouble because they listened to Satan and they began them so they were fighting if you if that's why I say if you pray with fire fire will bear you Hallelujah don't play with fire you're not gonna get into trouble you have to recognize Who You Are amen hallelujah thank you Lord you know we thank God for brother Abraham this message here without God send the prophet like he said Elijah to that time Ahab where will we be we will not be we cannot be sitting here this message is like remember the same spirit that was Elijah was in brother Abraham Hallelujah the age was in the same condition like the Ahab time just a bit just about killing you know you know how many people have adjustable use Ahab to kill their own people killing their own people taking their properties and everything the same thing Abraham came why do you think they hate this message the same way they hate Elijah the same thing they hate you now there's no different because why we are under Elijah's Ministry and this is the end Hallelujah and the world knew that the power is in you but they cannot get it so Satan is mad so if you stay with the word of God nothing can touch you what sickness cancer yes what do you scare look when the period of fire was around the Ark of the Covenant who can go there only the priests and if the prince goes over there and something wrong they have to draw a thing there to take him back you cannot go there now the pillar of fire is in you who can touch you you are the badger skin that God cover himself around the pillow fire there and the pillar of fire is in you the Holy Ghost is in you so who can come to you Satan is a bluff he's just a blob he has no power over you he can come and tempt you and do all kind of thing but you have to stay on your grounds the Lord Jesus Christ said all what I have I gave it to you why do you what do you want because you speak us John I think John 14 40 say Act and I will give it to you you didn't say you're gonna get I will give ask you don't ask you're not gonna get so you have to do work ask you what I want a wife ask sister one husband ask Hallelujah don't don't sit down this oh man so what shall we do man this man they don't like us and this man she said oh this woman they don't like us everybody separated themselves this was scared this one this one scared this one don't be scared Hallelujah we belongs to one another Hallelujah I saw my wife I asked I get Jeremiah saw his wife he asked he get Hallelujah you know us you're not gonna get this Brother Germany I don't know how he did I don't know what is the phone call or what he got what he does he got Hallelujah why are you crying speak Hallelujah there's a meeting coming hallelujah it's not a husband or wife meeting but everything is together Hallelujah if the dog goes to the water and then and they all floating to each other right I'm not saying nothing but I'm just speaking the word of God I don't know what is going this is not my message Hallelujah the message is for you youngest young Brothers Hallelujah amen thank you Lord so the same thing Elijah did they give him her time because he stayed on the word of God but the people don't want the world they made their own thing they want to Swerve away the same day the same way they Arab decibel he built his kingdom against God the same way the world be their Kingdom against God so God has to send Elijah the prophet William Abraham Hallelujah as Elijah came glory to God and this message we are under this message is powerful this message is life Hallelujah there is no dispute about this message no argument is the spoken word speak and go forward Hallelujah thank you Lord amen this message is not a fashion this message is All Time Gospel from the day of Pentecost where God started working among his people the same way is here now Hallelujah do you remember Brian was baptized in the Ohio River and when he reaches testing point of time the angel of God came down with the word a pillow fire hanging on them as John the Baptist fall around the first coming of the Lord Jesus Christ so your ministry who founded the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ this is real this is not just talking it's a history if you want to see those people who are watching on the line you want to see go and search up Hallelujah such up about William Marlon Abraham Hallelujah the prophet of God of this age the Gentile age what happened when they saw that their Ministry there's no power you know my country when when you killed a snake you chopped the head off the snake would jump and jump and jump and jump and jump and jump I jump taking the head is dead but it's already there so is that this morning church Pentecostals and all of them they'll have no head they are jumping they are dead no power the power God has taken and gave it to you the power is in you the word of God is in your mouth speak and go forward Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord we don't come here and sit down every day every day we sit down here for a purpose God is building us for his kingdom Hallelujah do not fear anything any circumstance that comes your way whether you are walking whether you're in anything we have experienced brother free privacy brother Michael everybody has experience about the the message the hour the church that we are living right now every one of us have experience can you can you do you believe that and God said this this you think oh this is my own imagination then you sit down there singly praying in your heart and you just see God said this this is and you wake up you put the light on you check it out everything that is telling you dot dot dot
