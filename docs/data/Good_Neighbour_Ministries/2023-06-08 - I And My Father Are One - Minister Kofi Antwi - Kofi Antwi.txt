good God is wonderful when we see God what the things the Lord has done for us we have to lift him up because he's a good God the Devil is a bad but God is good all the time God is good I want to hear your voice if the the Trudeau call you into his Palace and says I give you 100 million dollars you won't pay for it is that how you're gonna turn for opening that door for you you will be happy with joy with happiness that come from your heart but when we come to Christ there's no amount of money that can pay for What the Lord Has Done For You and Me so lift up your voice and praise him because he's a good God the Devil is bad there's no good thing in the devil and there's no batting in God our God is real let me tell you we have seen God so much in Good Neighbor since I always said those that have been in the church here for long we have seen the power of God made manifest right in Good Neighbor the time that was Eagle cry God was manifesting the pillar of fire was demonstrating to us that God is real through our precious brother and I always said that if it was not him I don't know God [Music] I in my heart I wanted to see reality of God but when I came in went oh my goodness the White Church I saw God so much and I'm not lying not because he's here his wife is here or anybody is here if you and I always said is if you think I'm just talking about Pastor Simon that's all right with me but let me tell you even in the message message you can't find so many preachers like him and let me tell you we have to praise God for that we have to thank God for that for a man to surrender for God to move him to use him Timber you are eyewitness of that right you see the way Timmy is preaching you see the way Danny is preaching you see the way Crystal I was here before all of them started preaching and I saw everything that God has done through our pastor and through them I have seen it I am eyewitness I speak from my heart I don't know why even God will call it a dummy person like me to come to the pulpit but it doesn't matter whether I'm dummy or I'm right or this let me tell you God is real I know that from the bottom of my heart Pastor you have preached for me to see it I'm eyewitness I've seen I've gone to places even rich people I'm talking with them the power of God in Me pick them up throw them in the ground they cry like a baby in front of me so I know what I'm talking about I know God is real I don't want hypocrisy too many hypocrisy people in the message is the truth too many hypocrisy hypocrisy is not good let's throw away anything that will hinder the Holy Spirit to move to bed witness in our heart in the people that are listening to us the people that we meet recently I was talking to a Muslim who is Imam in my country sorry please be seated I listen and this man I think Daniel have told you about him he was the man that used to take his one plate and feed me I'll preach but I'm coming and the thing that this man did for me in my life I I can't if even if it was me I can do it the man have one plate of rice and he shared with me if he didn't give me I was gonna die I I don't know who in Nigeria so every time I go home I see him but I have nothing to offer him and I was afraid if I tell him the message he won't listen and it will be in my heart pain but you know what God Made A Way not knowing he has become a man and the Lord made a way for me to share the word with him he confessed that Jesus Christ is god with his own lips I use the Quran talking with him let me tell you when you believe the message brother Brown preached and the Bible and you surrender your heart it will bring you to Christ it will lead you to cause it will lead you to the reality of Christ because a lot of people in the message are still in the message as I said last time they know the cause they know that that the Bible but they haven't made the author of The Bible which is Jesus Christ they haven't made that altar even in the message they were long clothes they don't wear earrings and the woman they don't paint their face the men they don't wear shorts they don't do things widely but still they come to church and go come and go come and go come and go but they themselves have never experienced Christ who is our life Christ in reality listen for me if you wanna tell me about the Bible don't just give me quotes cause won't be enough for coffee I need reality and that's what I saw in Pastor Simon that make me stay here when I saw the power of God moved I said if this is not Pentecost then let me I don't know no Pentecost in the Bible but I'm seeing reality of Pentecost right in the church this Muhammad priest I spoke with him told him the churches has failed the Quran on the people has failed but Quran tell us that because I've been in Muslim before people don't know but I was a Muslim too in my life So I says Quran inside Quran Quran says [Music] sorry I says Quran says God is the only one that can create he says yes I want to get into Christ but see the wisdom God gave me and I says to him Christ sorry which is Christ when Muslim call anabisa they mean Christ anybody that has gone to Muslim will tell you and ABI says Jesus Christ I says [Music] took the dust and make the bed he goes that's true then I says to him he says oh I never he said so many things and I said yeah he did a lot of things now I'm bringing him to to show him my what is behind me I said Mustafa who is your Quran says God is the one that can create another took the Das and make a bed since you born and you come to the Muslim your great great grandmother all of them are heavy Muslims and they all bowdy ahead have you ever seen that God that they talking they are Allah that they are talking he goes no I says the Quran says only God can create have you heard Muhammad create no have you heard Buddha create no then I says only annabisa take the bed take the dust and make bed who is an abisa he goes God and says praise the Lord praise the Lord that says you see now I can get something from him he has confessed that anabi says God I was thinking even he was a teacher in the Muslim he says no I'm Imam while I was talking with him they go a lot that their time was time for service he goes all Kofi let's talk I love your talk more than the Muslim talk this is Imam Imam I'm not talking about ordinary person Imam who is going to preach in the in the Mox and I'm taking this message and using the wisdom of God and going to him and he is confessing that Jesus is God why I was talking with him the line was crinkling and cranking and he could I do everything I couldn't get him I said okay thank you Lord now I know it's a seed some seed is there I'm gonna go to Ghana and I'm gonna go to him directly and take this message to him if God if he is succeed he will do a damage to the devil Kingdom brothers and sisters have no fear with this message that you have got the courage the courage defend be strong when God put things in your heart do it don't let us be hypocrite no hypocrisy a lot of churches in the message too much Hypocrites too much intellectuals where is the power of God where is God where is brother Abraham God that he used to talk not as our pastor says a lot of them know God on the wall they have done the same thing Pentecostals used to do the same thing but they don't know God in reality let us move to the reality the god that is just in some people mind just in their mind bring him on the sea to the people that they will know Jesus is real otherwise I don't care how much you call Jesus Is Dead other is dead in your life oh he's not real if he's real bring him on the sea wherever you go bring Jesus on the sin Jesus want to know that you love him more than anything if you love him more than anything he will come on the scene he knows my heart my heart he knows your heart every heart Jesus knew I can fool you but I cannot fool Jesus you can fool me but you can't fool Jesus blessed be the name of the Lord that is the appetite that is the appetite I'm just giving you an appetite I haven't started my message yet that is the appetite I'm trying to give it to you to wake you up if you are asleep you wake up because listen sister Palm has stood behind Pastor Simon sister thank you let everyone that know say thank you sister it's not easy this country it's not easy for pastor Simon to preach sister salmon to be at the back for them to grow like this and they still believe in the message we're still seeing the power of God we still seeing their life oh I don't know what to say but it is the grace of God sister thank you if nobody will say thank you I will send it to you praying before the people listen give honor to whom the honor desired to give it to our pastor has done a work for us he has Brothers if he's not here to Bear Danny Christopher everyone that stand here they preach with their heart you can see Desmond myself whoever God chose let us back him up for the Holy Spirit to do the work because it's the holy spirit is not the man God will move and I believe Pastor Simon has poured his heart and the Holy Spirit in him as it was in Moses as Moses go Joshua took over the Lord says my servant Moses is dead Joshua take the people to the promised land and as our pastor Aid has come the one that will stop in this Pulpit let us all back him up let us all be behind him so that the world will come fast with power and demonstration with reality listen God the way pastors preached to us if we surrender our heart let me tell you Devils cripples blinds any pain can happen here because the Holy Spirit is here the holy spirit will do the job but if we don't surrender the Holy Spirit can do the job God can do the job when we don't surrender so as we go into the the new finding I'll say the new pastor will take over Daniel timbir let us pray for them let us pray that God will chose the right one that he has ordained to be here not a man I don't believe in a man preaching no I Believe In Christ the Lord Christ The Mighty God Christ our savior Christ Our healer Christ that will lead us to the promised land which is rapture he's the only one let us all stand up is look say look 10. 10 25 to 38 okay brother and he just pray before I read we read the scripture amen Saint John my my topic is I give it to the brother I give it to the brother to put it on the board I said I and my father are one that's what I'm speaking Jesus answered them and told you and ye Jesus answered them I told you and ye believed not that the works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of me but ye believed not because he are not of my ship as I said unto you my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I gave unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man plug them out of my hand my father who gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to plug them out of my father's hand I and my father are one then the Jews took up Stone again to Stone him Jesus answered them many good work Have Eyes show you from my father for which of those work do ye Stone me the Jews answer him saying for a good work we strongly not but for blasphemy and because that thou being a man making thyself God Jesus answered them it is not written in your law I said you are gods if he called them gods unto whom the word of God come and the scripture cannot be broken say ye of him whom the father had Sanctified and sent into the world thou blasphemies because I said I am the son of God if I do not the words of my father Believe Me Not but if I do though he believe not me believe the words that ye may know and believe that the father is in me and I in him may the Lord add his Blessing please be seated we all know the scripture that we have read brother you can off some of the light it's too hot for me here I know we all know the scripture that we have read why the Pharisees wanted to Stone Jesus and kill him why the Pharisees were people that know the letter they know the code just like today as I said Lord no brother Abraham quote know the Bible quote but they don't know Christ because it is not given unto them but we who are bright the wife of Christ no matter what we were chosen before the foundations of this world so Christ has given to us before even we were born the seed of God was lying in our hearts that's why when we came here look so many has come here when the world come they cannot take it but ask yourself what make you come back again what make you stay here you think it's yourself is the Holy Spirit that has call you out has chose you before the foundations of this world is Christ in your soul so recognize it allowed him because one point when Jesus was here he said the son can do nothing unless the father shows him so Surrender Your Life for the Holy Spirit to use you the way God has ordained for your life not just the Lord don't call us as pastor of the brother says all the time to warm the people we're not going to be pure warmers because if you check Pentecost was Pentecost and a lot of people sorry to say we become afraid to step out to take the message to the people to let the people know that Jesus Christ is alive Jesus when he was here he did what the father shows him one point he says not my will but the father will right if you are a sheep you hear the voice of God coming out from the pope from fellowship from the street God can use anybody to speak to you because he is God he can do anything he wants in your life commit your heart fully unto him and says father is not my will your will should be done in my life like Esther said if I perish let me perish I'm going to see the king because tomb yourself to the voice of God in this last days because he is speaking a lot of people they thank God like before when I was in Africa and I was small my grandmothers and my mom when they talk about God or something they look in the sky they always think God is in the sky sister brother God is in you the father that dwell in you he will do the works come up to him you will hear his voice and when you hear that voice don't hide in your heart if you had in your heart things will bypass you because the voice of God like Desmond was saying sometimes most of all the time he comes to you like a thought and when it comes to you you act on the thought that coming to you the Bible says think not what you shall say because why when you have yield yourself to the word God will just flow out of you like a river like a sea bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling if you watch the sea it comes with the wave right it's bubbling just coming out like that time to time God will speak to your heart he will show you things never mind you know yourself better than anybody God don't deal with us as a group he speak to you as individual and when he speak you are responsible to act sometimes you are working God will bring somebody to you he wanted you to speak to and some of us because of Canadian cultural is called the prophet said Canadians are called so you are called but get warm the word of God is come to warm you come to bring you to what you don't like what the culture does not teach you they can teach you you gather from your comfort zone so many of us sometimes you know because of this place they call first class and they call Africans the third word the Caribbean third word but let me tell you human being is a human being woman being only the clothes or maybe the hair you make the style because of money you have you you have right you are able to buy nice clothes nice perfume nice house nice car but let me tell you whether you go in Africa jungle log Caribbean some Bush there the human beings and you are the same thing they think the same thing they think the same thing yes the only difference is the close but the culture the devil has put into US oh these are third world people these are the high class people and they train you to be cultural proper for me I don't believe in that I believe what God teaches me God says be who you are okay be who you are God give you a mouth I watch the way white people go to soccer game or baseball or hockey all the time I love soccer and I watch the way they react damn and we Africa jungle watching soccer there no difference no difference that's the reality in the people watch Canadians in hockey game and come to my Village in soccer games Sister Mary used to have an uncle as soon as the soccer started we have two teams and yeah kotoko is for Ashanti house is for Yuji tribe Accra people he will go on the village with head red random back and forth even the game hasn't started but it's charging for the game all right the same thing like the hockey and and basketball and the football the white song I watch them they take their shirt and they draw their Germany I know England my goodness what do you think we come to church and sometimes even you live nearby with them they says oh the black people make too much noise [Laughter] people and yet they're going hockey all I really don't throw everything that is you there that is the way you react when you come to Christ lose everything let the power of God flow let God come reality in your life shout jump praise him let me tell you Praise Jesus what is the best thing in your life to praise the Lord if you praise him the glory of God will come down let me tell you God love the presence of his people if you won't praise him he can raise up stones and bring them to praise him and if we praise him that's why let me say this you may not like it but it's the truth the little people don't have nothing to lose when they are serving God they have nothing to lose you watch Peter in the Bible that's why you could go to the Lord because he knows he got nothing to hide he throw everything if he's wrong he's wrong the Lord will correct him right but sometimes educated people and one day the Lord let me walk through some people who have pad doctor and so and so in Toronto October Philip I go and I sit down and I watch them they come put their leg and this and I look and I said what is this even I went to a big Abigail graduation it's nice but let me tell you that's not the way God will take it and says if they give me chance on that platform to speak oh my goodness you see how they will run left right oh my God damn glory to God you bless the gospel in front of them tell them root everything up you see how the spirit of God will chain them up and bring those that one Christ a birth does not come easy a true birth does not come easy the Holy Ghost does not move easy if you sit in your comfort zone God doesn't like it I tell you the truth move out of your comfort zone you see the message preach rejoice you give him praise you come out from your comfort zone then the Holy Spirit can pick you do things heal the sick delivering you all your trouble let me tell you I'm Free by the power of Christ don't you know look at me the doctor says I'm sick with cancer days I run to Pastor someone I said brother pray for me I'm still alive today I said I am still alive today and I'm praising God because why the Lord know I am one of the stone that was laying in in the street he brought out inside and I'm gonna give him praise you may think I'm crazy you may think I'm not right but that is the way of God yes sir God the Bible says they that will worship Christ will worship Him in spirit and Truth the churches they don't want worship of God they don't want men that will speak the truth they don't want the Holy Spirit that's why the Pharisees don't want her to kill Jesus but what they fail to recognize he was the storm that they need to build their churches he was the stalled that they need in their life to make themselves good if you want to look good let me tell you none of us look good only Christ Lord God so if you are allowed Holy Spirit to take your life inside the people seeing the people you're gonna look back but God gonna rejoice God gonna say this is my beloved Son this is my beloved doctor I am well pleased to dwell in him you remember David the Lord took him from a ship fall when he was looking after a ship his own father Jesse even didn't choose him because there was no Beauty to desire of him his own father refused the prophet refused him like he won't choose him but God has chose him when he came and you think David you talk about Christ he gonna sit warm and then look at you with his face like that no say David gonna praise God David gonna dance because he knew what God has done for him he know that God is real to him he know that he have nothing to lose if it wasn't God what is his life we went and look at former brother in the hospital Timber myself Philip and you face when we saw him in hospital bed it was so sad the flesh we are not worried then you ask yourself the earth I live is that if the Lord tells this flesh gonna come to an end like that then if I don't Praise Jesus what have I done you want to be like that we women's we want to shovel things around shovel things around and put Jesus last when is he he's supposed to be number one in our life he's supposed to be the king of King in your home King of Kings in your home he is supposed to be the Messiah the Eternal one that you bow down to look at the heaters the Muslims the Buddha the the Buddhists Muslims they go to Temple they don't know Christ yes they worship in vain but let me tell you that's why when a true Muslim gets salvation you talk about worship you talk about praising God you talk about knowing god the power of God they are not gonna joke they put their hand they want to die for it because the reality has shrugged your heart and let me tell you if reality has struck in your heart you don't take Christ as a second hand like I just bought a second-hand car no sir Christ is not second-hand car is the first car is the priority his everything that's supposed to be in you in reality he's supposed to be all of all of your life then you tomb up to him listen I have seen God does so many things in my life and I'm not just talking for joke when I came to the message I used to if that's what I see I will tell you I used to fast Monday to Friday the time brother I used to come to wawuna I don't even know how to wear better clothes and better chew a better suit when I was in the world I used to dress nice but when the Lord called me I make my heart I give all and I used to fast I used to see God knows my hotel brother Desmond and brother Michael told me no brother you can't do that because the word has come to you live the word God will take care of the rest that time I was not joking because I came from the street and I was looking for God and that time let me tell you this message God is my witness flip is sitting here when I'm talking to somebody on the street whatever I say I remember talking to one man who is a professor now uh no pad I told Philip about him and I was talking the holy spirit says you are lying what I'm talking you don't believe and the Holy Spirit says speak one word in your mind don't tell me I will speak it right away it started he recognized something is going on and I begin to tell him what was in his home going on in his home I didn't know nothing he ran back to tell his wife did you told that guy he says no he says you know I will never seen the guy then he recognized this is God God one time I was praying Driftwood three o'clock the Lord told me wake up take 120 naira sorry dollars neither because I live in Lagos dollars Canadian dollar go to such and such such house drop that money the man is playing he's praying for his son his baby you need break he need a diaper he need food and I went the man was standing in front of the door Early in the Morning by boss and I said the Lord sent me to you you were praying to God you asked the Lord you have checked the amount of money it's 120 dollars Canadian dollar the Lord says here is the money take it the the man says how did you know it before I opened my mouth the voice says stop saying the Lord God Almighty I know things I am that I am sent him I am here that is the gospel brother you have preached me to I have experienced all those things and I'm I'm telling you you can fail me with this fake fake fake intellectual gospel I have come to reality that's happened to me many times so I know let me tell you I know what I'm talking brother Abraham God Is We it's not just coming to church it's more than that you are right brother more than that let us yield ourselves the holy spirit will not take us and demonstrate to the people yes sir who want God who demonstrate in his life who won that who want to see dead race walking branching who want to see that I know all those things will encourage you it's not the absolute the absolute is when you go in the rapture but it's part of the world we need that as individuals we need to see that if you are not seeing that some portion of those things get yourself in prayer I am gonna get myself in shape thank you you told me to slim go more and get Slim because it's true thank you brother it's true we want to eat eat come church and Pastor praise our brothers pour your heart and we go home no no set if God is God let us bring God on the sea in our life you see not you gonna do it but when you surrender you hear his voice what God have for you the part-time that God has ordained for you it begins to fall into places fall into places you yourself Gonna Know that God you and him are one you and him has become reality one for don't you wonder but sometimes we get away from that too much food because Canada have so much food and the cultural boundaries we eat eat eat eat eat we don't want to pray we don't want to fast we don't want to call him on the scene right I am not saying fasting is absolute but sometimes you need it I need it am I lying I'll tell you the truth if I'm lying say coffee you lie I'm telling the truth me I'll preach my heart I will speak my heart listen I go someplace I see the power of God move I preach all the secret in the church come out old lady the preacher has robbed him 85 000. one church I preach he come to me begin to tell me his husband died they told him they were gonna buy church so he should bring that money this that they borrow from him now they says he put it into the the offering they don't want to give it he took them to court all kinds of things brothers and sisters that kind of gospel is price paid Pastor have paid a price we you and I is our time pay the price and see Christ in your life all get up those that who do the job will do it Jesus doesn't care whether two or three or four or five one one is majority when he got hold of something how many did something kill 3 000 Philistines it was the spirit of God in something the church spirit is in you it sounds very that was in something is in you is in me what are we gonna do with that message pray around the importance to the life electric Pole he pointed he says go beyond the camp is that not what he said what is the camp go beyond the message camp the message come when you go beyond you see Christ then he picks you up then you do things that surprise you things that even Church not many knows him not many cc not many will allow themselves to go through that way and when you do those things you know how you're gonna become to the some of so-called Believers sometimes you become like a bomb to them you become like a dog oh these guys dummy he cried too much this guy is he yelled too much this guy think he knows all the quotes he knows everything but let me tell you you are hearing the voice of God when they begin to shut you out Jesus will take you in you want Jesus to take you in all you want the church to accept you then Jesus shut you out salvation is you and Christ just like a wife and a husband a husband and wife you and your husband alone do you sisters that are married do you see your mommy and your husband and you sleep in one bed it doesn't work that way is you alone in Christ and so is it with church if you are with Christ you become wine with him he pick you up and said daughter walk with me walk with me Christ is looking for the people that will walk with him Christ is looking for Souls that are desperate that will move up out of their own way give up the world and take Jesus but when you walk with Jesus you're gonna be eyeball you're gonna be no good because your life gonna be different different walk before you were walking straight like everybody was looking now you're gonna walk sometime like this and sometimes like this sometime like this because Jesus is leading right when he lead you he don't let nobody know is shutting with you and you alone because we are Gentiles we are individuals we are not body it's nice we come together but when you come here bring your the the fire that is in you if you are bright bring the fire that is in you don't think the preacher you're gonna drag the preacher to speak to you you'll come you pray you come you are you tired because when you charge pray for the preachers the brothers pray for our pastor pray for him then the holy spirit is able whoever stand here whether it's done in Timber Christopher Desmond Phillip myself whoever God chose to stand here pray for them it's not easy because let me tell you if God really chose you to be I haven't stepped up to be a pastor and I that part no say in my mind I don't want it no in my life I don't want it because I know I can but it's not easy I respect that's why I respect the brothers nothing I respect you tell my respect you feel it I respect you Christopher wherever you are Desmond Glory I respect all of you because you know why to bring one word you don't know what we go through you may think it's easy the devil fights to bring the word he fights for you to deliver the message and you will see that your heart you want to bring aware that God wants you to bring to the Believers and the devil will be fighting you like crazy he don't want you to do it but let me tell you God whom he has chosen doesn't care when you see that you rejoice you inside your heart then you know you are doing something good you know that you are doing damage to the devil you see there's money preacher a very nice sermon last time test today what he we do we have to pray for him brother Philip told me just pray they call him to pray for this more what is that that devil is attacking because he don't want the word they see that it is there to come out and speak to God's children because this is this church I always had it Pastor used to have the cake now the cake is divided Danny have is Timber Havis Philip Harvest that's one Harvest Christopher Harvest I have mine right Curry have his part the devil is Happy is the same thing going on the same thing like when the prophet was here preaching when the prophet was here he preached then the word goes to a people sometimes when they go home they can't even sleep preachers can't even sleep Pastor is sitting here if I'm lying she'll tell me sometimes the devil want to attack your wife your children my goodness the whole week my leg this leg but let go no leg I'm calling let me tell you Lego no leg pain I'm coming some people they get a little bit headache they want to stay home do you know how much the preacher they go through with this kind of preaching that we get here we go to ask brother darling sister Jennifer you know Sister Deborah you know because you live with the brothers for pasta I won't even go there what they go through and if you're a good preacher God see this in you even the message they don't want you to preach you go someplace they want to shut you back off the door but let me tell you God word will get up this is the hour no matter what they do Judah did everything he took all the money from the treasury right he was a trustee he took all their money but did that stop Jesus because the elect the seed of God is there already before they were born who were chosen before the foundations of this world at the day of Pentecost one day the unwritten part of the word came on them did you saw Judas part of it he was not part of it because that one you can't take intellectual to impersonate it you can't take cause and impersonate it and we are heading to the same thing with the message the prophet William Abraham brought we are heading to the same thing because the devil is Connie we have here had knowledge but God have us here he's hidden in the heart so the devil think he can take the prophet quote slapping back forward and put it together sounds good and they think that's the message no now the message has moved from the written part to the unwritten part is now not in man's hand now it's not anybody has to control the message before people try to use their five sense to control the word of God but now God is saying I had enough I'm coming on the scene myself I'm coming I'll speak to my children I'll speak to the ellipse lips to lips ear to ear heart to heart and they will accomplish what I have spoken my word will never return unto me boy it will accomplish what I have spoken [Music] yes it will accomplish what I have spoken because I am God I tend not I not I am the creator of heaven and that I like not I cannot I will accomplish what I have spoken that is the word of God couldn't can't you see when I was in the prophet
