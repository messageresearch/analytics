[33:36] Yeah, it's good
[33:39] to be back tonight by the grace of God.
[33:44] And tonight
[33:47] I just want to thank the Lord
[33:50] for making a way for me to be here.
[33:52] Sorry I was a little bit delay but
[33:56] you'll be blessed
[33:59] because God is here.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Once the Lord is here that's all it
[34:04] matter. So I won't delay you too much.
[34:09] Uh we take the Bible. I'll use my
[34:13] background Lazarus
[34:16] because I'm going to give a testimony. I
[34:20] am not willing to maybe a little bit if
[34:24] I have time then I speak a little bit.
[34:26] If not the whole thing going to be
[34:28] testimony tonight
[34:30] since I got sick and the Lord has
[34:34] brought me back. I would love to give
[34:37] that testimony.
[34:39] So pay attention and listen because God,
[34:45] our God that we serve is not in the
[34:48] tomb. He's alive.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; He's alive.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; He raised Lazarus. He's still raising up
[34:56] people today. Amen.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; The churches don't know, but you and I,
[35:02] this must be a confidence to us that the
[35:06] Lord once we trust him and obey him and
[35:10] and walk with him, no matter what
[35:14] situation you go through, he's able to
[35:16] bring you out. Unless it's your time
[35:20] that he has ordained for you to go, no
[35:22] matter what. If we as believers have
[35:25] that faith, the Lord can do anything.
[35:29] All things are possible.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; I believe that. So, uh we take our Bible
[35:36] from John chapter 11
[35:40] and I will start from okay let's start
[35:43] from verse 4.
[35:46] When I read sometime I to the praise I
[35:51] want it's all about Lazarus. God raising
[35:54] Lazarus from the grave and says
[35:58] uh his sisters you know I it's too long
[36:02] the time see so I'll cut it off. Okay
[36:06] let us pray. Brother Phillip can you
[36:08] come and pray before we start?
[36:18] Just stand and you want the mic or
[36:25] &gt;&gt; That's fine. Just lift your voice.
[36:43] Yes, Lord.
[36:54] Yes, Lord.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[37:15] [Music]
[37:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:22] uh John 11 verse4 when Jesus heard that
[37:29] he said this sickness is not unto death
[37:35] but for the glory of God that the son of
[37:40] God might be glorified
[37:44] whereby
[37:46] now Jesus loved Martha and her sister
[37:52] and Lazarus.
[37:54] When he heard when he had heard
[37:58] therefore that he was sick, he abide two
[38:03] days still in the same place where he
[38:08] was. Then after that said he to his
[38:14] disciples, "Let us go into Judea again."
[38:19] His disciples say unto him, "Master, the
[38:24] Jews
[38:25] of late sought to stone thee, and go
[38:31] thou
[38:32] tither again?" Jesus answered, "Are
[38:37] there not 12 hour in a day? If a man
[38:43] walk in the day, he stumble not because
[38:49] he said the
[38:53] he he he
[38:55] see the light of the world. But if a man
[39:00] walk in the light, he stumble
[39:05] because there is no light in him.
[39:10] Then this these things said he and after
[39:16] that he said unto them, "Our friend
[39:21] Lazarus sleepeth,
[39:23] but I go that I may awoke him out of
[39:28] sleep."
[39:30] Then said his disciples, "Lord,
[39:35] if he sleep, he shall do well. How be
[39:40] Jesus speak of his death? But they
[39:46] thought that he
[39:49] had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.
[39:56] Then said Jesus unto them plainly,
[40:00] Lazarus is dead,
[40:03] and I am glad for your sake
[40:07] that I was not there to the intent ye
[40:13] may believe.
[40:15] Nevertheless, lest
[40:18] let us go into him. Okay, for the time
[40:23] sake. Then uh verse 21. Let's turn to
[40:27] verse 21. I'm just going to rush. Then
[40:30] said matter unto Jesus, Lord, if thou
[40:35] has been here, my brother had not died.
[40:40] But I know that even now, whatsoever
[40:46] thou would ask of God, God will give it,
[40:52] give it thee. Jesus said unto her,
[40:57] thy brother shall rise again.
[41:02] Okay. Okay. I I'm jumping.
[41:06] Okay. Let's jump to 39. Jesus said,
[41:09] "Take ye away the stone." Matter the
[41:14] sister of him that was dead said unto
[41:18] him,
[41:20] "Lord, by this time he thinkketh, for he
[41:25] has been dead for days." Jesus
[41:30] said unto her, "Said I not unto thee,
[41:34] that if thou wouldast believe, thou
[41:38] should have seen the glory of God." Then
[41:43] they took away the stone from the place
[41:47] where the dead was laid. And Jesus lift
[41:52] up his eye and said, "Father, I thank
[41:56] thee that thou hearest thou has heareest
[42:01] me, and I know that thou
[42:06] hearest me always, because but because
[42:10] of these people which stand by, I said
[42:15] it, that they may believe that thou has
[42:20] sent me. Okay, I'm go on. Please sit
[42:23] down.
[42:25] Right, we all know he he raised Lazarus
[42:30] from the tomb. I that's what I'm trying
[42:32] to say. But because the time
[42:36] I'm trying to rush. Brothers and
[42:39] sisters,
[42:41] let us give glory and honor unto the
[42:44] Lord because
[42:47] let me tell you, you all knew I was
[42:49] about to go to

[44:09] going to bed to sleep. So my wife hasn't
[44:12] finished the laundry. So he went to a
[44:15] big girl womb to keep on folding the
[44:20] clothes and I slept. But while I was
[44:25] going to bed, I put a tablet in about
[44:29] brother Abraham message
[44:31] and I slept.
[44:33] So in the middle of sleeping I woke up.
[44:38] Right that time I could not breathe
[44:42] proper.
[44:44] I realized I need help.
[44:47] So I went to Paul room and knock Paul
[44:53] door. Paul was at sleep and I told him
[44:56] Paul son your father I cannot breathe
[45:00] good so I call your mother
[45:04] and Paul called her mother
[45:08] and the mother came and still I wasn't
[45:12] able to breed good so I told my wife
[45:16] Mary
[45:17] please put water on my head
[45:22] then my wife cold water. My wife's
[45:26] putting cold water on my head and he
[45:29] says, "What is happening? What is
[45:30] happening?" You love to know that one I
[45:33] remember. But the way my breathing was
[45:37] going,
[45:39] I couldn't breathe
[45:42] normal. So my wife was desperate
[45:47] and right away I saw that this thing is
[45:52] serious on me
[45:54] and I tried to breathe but it wasn't
[45:58] coming good.
[46:00] So I lay down in the washroom floor
[46:04] which is the master bedroom
[46:07] and that's all
[46:10] I could remember.
[46:13] not knowing
[46:16] I was
[46:18] during that time pass out or Abigail how
[46:23] do you say that that's why I brought her
[46:25] so many things I don't know come around
[46:28] come around my daughter she knows all
[46:30] the terms
[46:32] I was gone
[46:34] I would say there are things Abi will
[46:37] say for me in in medical terms he knows
[46:42] everything. I don't know the terms.
[46:46] So my wife was crying. Paul was crying.
[46:50] So my wife told Paul to call the uh
[46:54] parameh.
[46:57] So he called the paramedics
[47:00] and while they are coming my wife also
[47:03] called h uh brother Phillip
[47:07] and I think Rose picked the phone. My
[47:11] wife was so crying because that time I I
[47:18] am totally gone. I can't remember
[47:20] nothing or see nothing. But according to
[47:25] my wife
[47:28] and he called brother Phillip. So
[47:30] brother Philip was right away he was on
[47:32] his way coming. He told them that
[47:35] brother Kofi is dying. Brother Kofi is
[47:37] dying and my wife says he saw things
[47:44] while he was in back home. They told her
[47:46] when somebody is dying the way the eye
[47:49] the ball the mouth uh the uh puff uh
[47:54] things coming out. So and those things
[47:58] he could see I was going through those
[48:01] things and before. So he was crying
[48:05] seriously. So brother Philillip just get
[48:08] in his car. Rose was crying
[48:12] and because my wife left the phone
[48:15] crying and Paul is talking with the
[48:18] paric on the line
[48:21] and they came. Thank God about six
[48:25] people because the way Paul was crying
[48:27] and calling them they realized it is
[48:31] serious something really is happening.
[48:34] So about six or seven of them came you
[48:38] know how here it is. When they came,
[48:42] they used the
[48:46] the shock, right?
[48:48] &gt;&gt; They they used the so basically to shock
[48:52] him.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Cardiac arrest.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Okay. Say it loud. Don't don't don't let
[48:56] your mouth small. Say it so they could
[48:58] hear it. I want them to hear it.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; So basically, my dad was in cardiac
[49:03] arrest, which means that his heart
[49:04] stopped and he wasn't breathing. There
[49:06] was no signs of life. So the paramedics
[49:09] came. They had to do CPR and they also
[49:12] um delivered shock to him to get him
[49:16] back.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; So they did what they have to do. Then
[49:19] they get a pulse on me.
[49:22] Then they have to rush me to the
[49:25] hospital. So they told my wife I was
[49:28] playing the during that time they the
[49:31] tablet was playing
[49:33] and the message brother was talking
[49:36] about was Lazarus.
[49:39] Okay. Paul said they told Paul go off
[49:44] the tablet. So Paul went and off the
[49:48] tablet. While he was offing the tablet,
[49:51] Rabbi was talking about the resurrection
[49:53] of Lazarus.
[49:56] So Paul says that gave him a little bit
[50:01] confidence that no matter what this is
[50:04] not dead, my father will rise up again.
[50:08] Amen.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; So they took me to the hospital.
[50:12] My wife and Paul came
[50:16] and once they were in the hospital, my
[50:19] wife asked the secretary in the
[50:23] emergency,
[50:25] my husband,
[50:27] they have brought my husband here, can I
[50:29] please uh see my husband? The lady
[50:33] checked on the computer. My name was not
[50:36] there.
[50:38] So they haven't processed my name into
[50:41] their program yet. Then he told my wife,
[50:43] "Wait, I'm going to uh the counter to
[50:47] find out was the main office to find how
[50:51] things are going." So he went and came
[50:54] back and he says, "Yes, your husband is
[50:56] here." So they uh they told her that he
[51:00] should go to the uh u ICU, right?
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Huh? No. So, um that that time um they
[51:10] brought you into the emergency room and
[51:13] um they they told mom to go they they
[51:15] brought mom to a room and and told her
[51:17] to wait there.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, when my wife was waiting,
[51:22] there was a nurse
[51:24] who came to my wife. My wife asked said,
[51:29] "Where is my husband?" He says, "I
[51:32] cannot tell you.
[51:34] Just wait. there will be a doctor's
[51:38] coming to you to speak to you.
[51:42] So right there that time brother
[51:44] Philillip has called
[51:46] he's almost there. Paul have to go and
[51:49] direct him where to park so that he
[51:51] won't get a ticket and things. So,
[51:54] brother Philillip came in with Paul
[51:58] and while they come in the nurse could
[52:03] my wife says I wanted to see my husband
[52:06] where they have put him. He says no I
[52:09] can't tell you unless the doctors are
[52:13] coming to meet you.
[52:15] So
[52:17] my wife told brother Phillip my wife was
[52:21] so cold desperate because why is it that
[52:26] they have told me my husband is in the
[52:28] hospital
[52:29] but I cannot see my husband what is
[52:33] going on in her mind that's why she was
[52:36] thinking what's wrong if anything wrong
[52:38] they should let me see but this lady is
[52:40] saying no she can't talk to her unless
[52:43] the doctors
[52:44] so my My wife and brother Philillip came
[52:48] with Paul
[52:50] and my wife told brother Phillip,
[52:53] brother Phillip says sister Mary just
[52:56] calm down because he saw the situation
[52:59] says come down sister let's pray
[53:02] everything going to be all right. So he
[53:06] come my wife a little bit they wait for
[53:09] about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Then
[53:14] Dr. Okay.
[53:16] While I was in the hospital,
[53:21] I have already gone
[53:25] that they were discussing the doctors
[53:28] were discussing and the nurses so many
[53:31] of them were discussing that how they
[53:35] going to come to my wife to tell her to
[53:39] get prepared
[53:42] to go and whether they will bury me or
[53:44] whatever they want to M.
[53:47] So
[53:49] while they were thinking like that in
[53:51] the room,
[53:53] all of a sudden they saw brothers and
[53:57] sisters
[53:59] something just creaking in the body
[54:01] again. Life just creek a little bit in
[54:05] the body. Then
[54:08] they started everything. They put life
[54:12] support
[54:13] and put the oxygen oxygen, right?
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Um so um when they found his pulse again
[54:22] um they had to intubate him. So they put
[54:24] a tube down his throat and they put him
[54:26] on a ventilator. So that's the life
[54:27] support.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Life support. And they rushed me
[54:32] and they came the doctor came to my wife
[54:35] and asked her
[54:38] did your husband fall down? My wife says
[54:41] no,
[54:43] but this
[54:45] is serious
[54:48] and
[54:50] we the doctor says
[54:54] I have done the that's the higher doctor
[54:58] in the in charge of the ICU says I have
[55:02] done everything
[55:04] but look to you should look into the man
[55:09] upstairs.
[55:11] I have done all I can do as a doctor,
[55:15] but the rest you have to
[55:19] look to the man upstairs. He have to do
[55:22] his job too.
[55:24] You know how doctors are, they won't say
[55:27] God,
[55:28] &gt;&gt; they won't say the Lord. But you and I
[55:30] know the man upstairs is me. The Lord
[55:32] Jesus Christ.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's calling the Lord Jesus Christ
[55:38] to do his job.
[55:40] Even
[55:42] I'm going to go I'm going to go back to
[55:44] the hospital for them to see what the
[55:47] Lord has done.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; So why the doctor says that brother
[55:53] Philillip was right there too, right,
[55:54] Philillip?
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; So he heard it not my wife alone or my
[56:00] children alone Paul. So they brought me
[56:05] to the ICU which is my the room that
[56:10] they will put me. During that time
[56:15] my breathing
[56:17] was just tiny tiny tiny bit. My eye has
[56:21] closed. I didn't see nothing. My
[56:25] daughter they Paul test her. So she she
[56:28] she
[56:30] took a taxi, one of her officers,
[56:33] pay her taxi
[56:36] and he drove right with taxi from
[56:39] Toronto downtown to Willen Hospital. So
[56:42] he came and saw it. They were talking to
[56:45] her. They told my wife, they were asking
[56:48] my wife, "What has happened to your
[56:51] husband?
[56:52] We we would like to know anything about
[56:55] him." So my wife talked to them about
[56:58] the medicine and things that I was I've
[57:02] have gone through already a kidney
[57:05] problem and uh diabetes
[57:09] medicine this I was already seeing so
[57:12] many doctors before this came.
[57:16] So my daughter explained every medicine
[57:21] that I was already taking to to them.
[57:27] Then they realized the things that they
[57:30] are dealing with. Only God could bring
[57:33] me alive
[57:36] because it looked like there was no
[57:39] hope.
[57:41] But when there is no hope and Jesus
[57:44] still in the boat, brother, keep your
[57:47] head up.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Sister, keep your head up.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; They brought me to the room
[57:56] still
[57:57] drugs that they were using. Abig girl
[58:00] know all the drugs. She could tell you
[58:04] some were serious.
[58:06] My high blood pressure was way overdose.
[58:11] They don't know what to do to a point
[58:13] Abigail was even challenging the
[58:15] doctors. Why are you giving this kind of
[58:18] medicines?
[58:19] Because sick kid is number one hospital
[58:24] for children that are born from birth to
[58:27] 18 years is number one in the whole
[58:30] world. So every
[58:33] medicine, every machine they use for
[58:36] humanity
[58:38] s get it number one
[58:41] is the best for children till they get
[58:44] 18.
[58:46] So they have best doctors, best
[58:48] scientific this that but when God call
[58:52] nobody can stop it anyway.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; So
[58:58] Abbe was
[59:00] H talking to the doctors, the medicine
[59:04] that you are giving to my dad
[59:07] is
[59:09] so strong
[59:11] because he knows all the name says why
[59:14] are you doing this? The doctor says no
[59:16] the situation
[59:18] h I have to do it because the situation
[59:22] is so bad.
[59:24] I have to do in another way. I have to
[59:26] do what I have to do. But uh it's like
[59:31] he is not certain
[59:33] about the situation.
[59:36] But God was there
[59:40] and watch.
[59:43] I think who came first Abby? Pastor
[59:45] Simon or brother Mike?
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Um it was it was pastor Simon that came.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Okay. Pastor Simon came. He have talked
[59:54] with our beloved pastor. They have share
[59:57] ideas and pastor and him because pastor
[1:00:01] was at work. He couldn't make it. So
[1:00:05] pastor Simon came as soon as he get
[1:00:09] there that time I didn't see pastor
[1:00:12] Simon with sister Simon. He came in my
[1:00:16] wife. The situation was so serious to a
[1:00:21] point if you see my wife that time you
[1:00:24] you won't see that that is sister Mary.
[1:00:26] Pastor Simmon look at me
[1:00:30] and said brother Kufi is sleeping.
[1:00:34] She will wake again.
[1:00:37] As soon as my wife says he heard that
[1:00:39] her heart went to rest.
[1:00:43] That's all he said. But he stayed there
[1:00:45] for a little while with his precious
[1:00:49] wife. Pray for me. That time I didn't
[1:00:52] see nothing cuz I was in a coma. Right.
[1:00:58] All right. Okay. So,
[1:01:02] I didn't see nothing.
[1:01:04] Then the Lord,
[1:01:06] our sister, sister Alen, uh, brother
[1:01:10] Mike White, sister Elen,
[1:01:14] I think with his precious husband,
[1:01:17] brother Mike,
[1:01:19] the Lord
[1:01:21] sent them with the word of God,
[1:01:25] Psalm 118,
[1:01:27] to come and read it to me. Why I was
[1:01:32] when he came they came my eye hasn't
[1:01:35] opened I don't know nothing I pass out
[1:01:38] I'm gone
[1:01:40] they came and read and says
[1:01:44] brother Kofi will God will overcome all
[1:01:47] the enemies that are trying to attack
[1:01:52] they read they pray for me they gone
[1:01:55] brother Desmond his precious wife sister
[1:01:58] Elizabeth Okay.
[1:02:01] All that time
[1:02:04] I don't think my my body I could even
[1:02:09] move the body like that. No. Mad Desmond
[1:02:12] was there. He could say he came and he
[1:02:16] entered the room and he says captain
[1:02:21] and first time he says my wife says he
[1:02:26] came and told my wife I shake my body
[1:02:30] then the wife says brother Kovi
[1:02:35] tell my wife
[1:02:37] as you see you'll be wake and preaching
[1:02:41] to the people there
[1:02:43] and they pray they gone.
[1:02:46] So I was there. It took about uh one
[1:02:51] week right a week
[1:02:55] before I could open this eye. But still
[1:02:59] I wasn't seeing clear
[1:03:02] because medicine they give me blood.
[1:03:05] They here they put a a a
[1:03:10] thing that they will take blood from
[1:03:12] here because my ribs are high hard to to
[1:03:16] poke. So they put it here to poke me and
[1:03:20] get blood from me. I have swallow
[1:03:25] whole of my body
[1:03:28] and when my eye open
[1:03:32] they brought blood broad
[1:03:35] to give me blood they says I'm shock
[1:03:38] with broad
[1:03:40] and I'm also h
[1:03:45] I feel one word you says to me they said
[1:03:48] I forgot it anyway
[1:03:52] H is it if like you are hungry and you
[1:03:55] didn't eat and sa
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; so they said I get also they brought
[1:04:00] machine they said they have to seal the
[1:04:04] holes there's a holes in my stomach they
[1:04:06] have to seal it they came with a machine
[1:04:08] seal it and they were saying why I
[1:04:12] wasn't waking up they were saying even
[1:04:15] if I wake up my brain will not function
[1:04:18] good so they have to scan the brain.
[1:04:22] So they took me to go scan my brain
[1:04:28] and my wife have to sign it
[1:04:31] twice.
[1:04:34] they according to the uh medical report
[1:04:37] my brain will not work good
[1:04:40] but
[1:04:42] somehow some somewhere every time they
[1:04:45] check everything was right
[1:04:48] because God was in control
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; and
[1:04:56] I came back
[1:04:59] now I can see my wife my son like you
[1:05:03] visit me I can see my eye can see you
[1:05:06] one point my daughter says when I talk I
[1:05:12] wasn't able to talk even proper because
[1:05:16] I I couldn't see things uh talk like the
[1:05:20] way respond very very good
[1:05:25] but somehow it came back and I was able
[1:05:29] to talk
[1:05:32] But believe me,
[1:05:35] even when my eye open was not easy. I
[1:05:39] couldn't wake up
[1:05:42] lay on my back.
[1:05:44] The IV
[1:05:46] right they put on me somehow went wrong.
[1:05:50] This hand, this hand became like this.
[1:05:54] This hand too has swell up. And every
[1:05:58] time when in the night my wife will come
[1:06:02] in the morning she to stay there to help
[1:06:07] me when is going then I felt sad.
[1:06:11] There's one thing I want to tell
[1:06:13] everyone of you.
[1:06:16] The Lord says,
[1:06:20] "Husband and wife,
[1:06:22] what I the Lord have joined together,
[1:06:25] let no man put a sander because why?
[1:06:28] They are both one fleshed."
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; That was the time.
[1:06:36] Yes, I love my wife and I know all the
[1:06:39] scripture. We are in one flesh. I know
[1:06:41] that. But that time it became reality.
[1:06:46] serious that yes wives, husbands,
[1:06:53] love your wife
[1:06:55] because during that time I tell you the
[1:06:58] truth,
[1:07:00] God used my wife. I really saw that the
[1:07:05] Lord was really using my wife.
[1:07:09] It wasn't easy on her part to a point
[1:07:13] I'm looking at her and tears coming
[1:07:17] because she was going through a lot.
[1:07:21] Even pastor Simon sometime will call me
[1:07:25] oh brother Kofi how is Mary doing? I
[1:07:27] says that time I could talk. I says
[1:07:30] she's doing fine. says okay I know and I
[1:07:35] know she she know what he saw that Mary
[1:07:39] was going through a lot
[1:07:41] it wasn't easy because when he come and
[1:07:45] is going
[1:07:48] my he looked to me I need her I really
[1:07:53] really it's it's like if he is not there
[1:07:58] my eye will close and I'll die
[1:08:01] because That bond
[1:08:05] was so strong I don't know I can't put
[1:08:09] west to it. Then I realize
[1:08:13] my God
[1:08:16] husband
[1:08:17] love your wife.
[1:08:20] Wife love your husband. Clen in two of
[1:08:25] you clink in to be one flesh with the
[1:08:29] word.
[1:08:31] I realized I really need my wife
[1:08:34] because even though nurse will help you,
[1:08:36] I love the nurses. They did their part
[1:08:40] on me but it's not like my wife.
[1:08:45] So
[1:08:47] so many things
[1:08:49] medicine
[1:08:51] drugs to a point sometime the like if I
[1:08:56] make my hand like this the drug they
[1:08:58] will give me is almost full.
[1:09:01] And I have to drink it once. And
[1:09:04] sometime when I drink it, my body is
[1:09:07] still going boom.
[1:09:10] And my my my daughter, my children, they
[1:09:14] crying in the womb. The nurses have to
[1:09:16] come and kick them. And Abigail says,
[1:09:18] "No, the medicine is too much. Not to
[1:09:22] for you uh nurses and doctors to give
[1:09:26] him my my father wants divide it and
[1:09:29] give him little bit little bit but is
[1:09:32] too much but what can he say? Emmanuel
[1:09:38] was so upset when he saw so many
[1:09:42] medicine they giving me. He says, "Oh,
[1:09:44] this they're going to heal my father."
[1:09:46] They and he seen things, but God
[1:09:51] kept me.
[1:09:54] Some nurses after my eye is open, they
[1:09:59] come to me.
[1:10:02] I don't know there.
[1:10:04] They told me Kofi, they will mention my
[1:10:08] name.
[1:10:10] He says, "I was there when you were
[1:10:14] gone.
[1:10:16] I saw it."
[1:10:19] And
[1:10:21] thanks. Some of them are Christians,
[1:10:23] denomination, but not in the message.
[1:10:26] But at least they know that God has done
[1:10:30] a miracle.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; They realize God has done a great
[1:10:35] miracle. Some of them will greet
[1:10:39] will will even come to me, hug me. I was
[1:10:42] in the wheelchair.
[1:10:44] Some will even come rub my head and oh
[1:10:48] talking with me. They says listen I saw
[1:10:51] you when there was no life in your body
[1:10:55] and you came back. I was there.
[1:11:00] They were I not one. So when they are
[1:11:02] talking I'm looking at them
[1:11:04] individually.
[1:11:06] One man that spoke it struck me. His
[1:11:10] name was Latana. He says he live in St.
[1:11:12] Katherine.
[1:11:14] And
[1:11:16] he says he came to the room. He was the
[1:11:19] nurse in charge about me that day. He
[1:11:22] said when he came I wasn't
[1:11:26] breathing good.
[1:11:29] Uh there was like my body was like dead
[1:11:32] silence. He looked into the table. All
[1:11:36] he saw was a tablet and something told
[1:11:39] him to open it. He open it. Something
[1:11:43] tell him press it and he press it
[1:11:48] and he left the womb.
[1:11:51] So when I came back and life and I I
[1:11:55] could talk he told me he says Kofi I
[1:12:01] don't know I realize when I press the
[1:12:04] tablet I know that you are very
[1:12:08] religious
[1:12:10] man so I press that tablet for you
[1:12:14] somehow my wife brought that tablet he
[1:12:17] knows the way I was every night I prayed
[1:12:19] a tablet If you don't have one, get
[1:12:22] wine. When you going to bed, put it on.
[1:12:27] The message, whether it's brother Brown,
[1:12:28] whether it's our pastor, whether it's
[1:12:30] Deson, Phillip, Tim Beer, whoever is
[1:12:34] preaching, put it on and just go to bed.
[1:12:38] You never know what the Lord will use it
[1:12:41] for you.
[1:12:43] So he press it
[1:12:46] and he says Kofi I'm happy that you are
[1:12:50] back alive
[1:12:52] cuz when I came in there your body
[1:12:55] wasn't kicking or nothing.
[1:12:58] And I asked him where does he come from?
[1:13:01] He said I says I love your name because
[1:13:03] his name his name is Lana.
[1:13:07] And he says he's from Polish, Germany
[1:13:11] and English. His great grandparents were
[1:13:14] from Poland. They so they moved after
[1:13:18] the second world war. They move and they
[1:13:21] came here and born him. So I was
[1:13:23] thinking back of my mind now I know why
[1:13:27] this man even he doesn't know that God
[1:13:30] has used him. Could it be a Jew? I don't
[1:13:34] know.
[1:13:36] But that was it. They took me exercise
[1:13:43] do lot of exercise.
[1:13:46] the the day Desimon was preaching
[1:13:51] that time
[1:13:53] my son Paul Ebiguel Dborah that day they
[1:13:57] were going to Ghana they came to church
[1:13:59] here that day that Desmond was preaching
[1:14:05] one of the nurses
[1:14:07] came to me is a Filipino
[1:14:10] lady young lady very skinny and very
[1:14:13] strong lady strong by working very hard.
[1:14:18] She came to me, "Oh, you a Christian?" I
[1:14:22] say, "Yes." "What church you go?" I
[1:14:24] says, "Good neighbor ministry. Where is
[1:14:27] it?" I say, "It's in Benton, New
[1:14:29] Street." Before I knew it, he says,
[1:14:31] "Today I'm going to put you into the
[1:14:33] wheelchair. They have a a a
[1:14:37] incliner, but this one will know
[1:14:40] incliner. It's something incliner chair
[1:14:44] chair.
[1:14:45] So they take machine brought me put me
[1:14:49] in the machine and the machine will put
[1:14:51] me in the chair because I can't get up
[1:14:53] my hand. I can't move it this I can't
[1:14:55] move it that time. They put me in I'm in
[1:14:58] the then they roll me to the the studio
[1:15:02] like the where the nurses their main
[1:15:05] station where they have a big TV on the
[1:15:08] wall. Before I know it, Good Neighbor
[1:15:11] Ministry is on the board like that and
[1:15:15] I'm looking and before I know it, some
[1:15:20] nurses has g around me like that and
[1:15:24] they watching good and they go, "Oh,
[1:15:26] they see my daughter Ebiguel that time
[1:15:29] playing that day and they saw Paul
[1:15:33] playing sassiful. They saw my wife. They
[1:15:35] already know them because of the
[1:15:38] situation.
[1:15:39] They go, "Wow,
[1:15:42] oh now we know you are very very your
[1:15:45] family is so into it and oh that's a
[1:15:49] nice church this that and they were
[1:15:52] working so they couldn't stay there
[1:15:55] long." But you know what? You know what
[1:15:59] came to me?
[1:16:01] It came to me that if the Lord wanted to
[1:16:05] do witness without nobody, you open your
[1:16:10] mouth. When you surrender,
[1:16:13] he will do the job by himself. If he
[1:16:17] have to put you to hospital to be a
[1:16:19] witness to the people, you open your
[1:16:22] mouth and tell them, he will do it. He
[1:16:25] used my sickness
[1:16:27] and nurses were watching good neighbor
[1:16:31] and commending good neighbor and I was
[1:16:34] so happy in my heart right what was
[1:16:38] going on and I said thank you Lord so
[1:16:41] some of them got to know our church the
[1:16:45] whole floor
[1:16:47] people
[1:16:49] that
[1:16:51] I didn't know them I don't know them
[1:16:54] became even friends to me. I show one to
[1:16:57] pastor Simon. One lady I I he became
[1:17:02] friends with me and we talk and I show
[1:17:05] him to pastor Simon.
[1:17:08] So
[1:17:09] let me tell you
[1:17:12] after
[1:17:13] that
[1:17:15] all that
[1:17:17] I went came out come home. Paul Abigail
[1:17:23] Dborah has gone. I am home with my wife
[1:17:28] and Emmanuel. Because of the sickness, I
[1:17:31] could not go to Ghana.
[1:17:35] But when I came,
[1:17:39] I cannot eat.
[1:17:43] So my wife will make me food. When I try
[1:17:47] to eat it, I vomit.
[1:17:49] If he give me food, the food I'll vomit.
[1:17:54] And it was so serious.
[1:17:57] Early in the morning, my wife make the
[1:18:00] food. Says, "Brother Kofi,
[1:18:03] okay,
[1:18:04] and what do you want?" I said, "Go,
[1:18:06] honey, go make tea for me." He went
[1:18:10] downstairs doing the tea and I told
[1:18:13] Eman, Manuel, I need puddy. So, he go
[1:18:15] and get me puddy. And while I was eating
[1:18:18] the puddi, I wasn't feeling good. I told
[1:18:22] him, "Manuel, call your mommy quick."
[1:18:25] The mother came
[1:18:27] sitting on the chair.
[1:18:30] Mother tried to wake me up. I'm gone.
[1:18:35] He can't see nothing. As he tried to
[1:18:39] touch me like that, I just go on the
[1:18:42] ground. Boom. Gone.
[1:18:45] Then Emmanuel told Emmanuel call
[1:18:49] ambulance.
[1:18:51] And my wife
[1:18:53] something
[1:18:55] came on my wife.
[1:18:58] Abig girl had show his mother how to do
[1:19:02] a
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; CPR.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; CPR.
[1:19:06] So my wife put that CPR into practice.
[1:19:11] He don't know but he just failed to do
[1:19:14] it. She was doing CPR. I wasn't me. I
[1:19:19] don't know nothing.
[1:19:21] Doing doing all of a sudden my wife full
[1:19:24] swag wasn't easy. Crying and doing it.
[1:19:29] Crying and doing it. All of a sudden, I
[1:19:33] wake up and I said, "I only my my chest,
[1:19:36] my chest. I feel so much pain in my
[1:19:41] chest."
[1:19:43] And that time the ambulance came and
[1:19:46] they took me
[1:19:49] to the hospital again.
[1:19:51] And while I was in the hospital,
[1:19:56] then they find out there is a I think
[1:19:59] water in my loins, right? Is it my loss
[1:20:04] or the
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; say?
[1:20:07] The first the first time the reason why
[1:20:09] you went into cardiac arrest was because
[1:20:11] there was water in your lungs.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Okay. Sorry to say it was the first
[1:20:15] time. So there was water in my lungs
[1:20:18] which they have to drain out.
[1:20:21] Then they drained the water.
[1:20:24] They took me also to St. Katherine
[1:20:28] and cut here and put something like I
[1:20:32] don't know how you call that.
[1:20:34] It's like a basically
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; camera. It's light small but go through
[1:20:40] here come here go through my heart and I
[1:20:44] lay down flat and they put things on me
[1:20:48] and I look on the TV the doctor in the
[1:20:51] computer made two machines on me and I
[1:20:54] could see my stomach everything. They
[1:20:56] were checking my whole the thing,
[1:20:58] checking my whole body, my whole uh uh
[1:21:03] body to see if they could find maybe
[1:21:05] blood blockage or anything. They
[1:21:08] couldn't see nothing. So they then they
[1:21:11] brought me back to Willing Hospital.
[1:21:13] Then they realized my heart also is low.
[1:21:19] So they have to put a what do you call
[1:21:23] spacer?
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Pacemaker.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Pacemaker.
[1:21:26] That one they have to take me to
[1:21:28] Huntington.
[1:21:30] And they took me to Huntington
[1:21:33] and cut here and put a peacemaker inside
[1:21:38] my chest.
[1:21:40] And I stayed there about
[1:21:44] two days and they says Kofi once we have
[1:21:48] put this time for you to go home.
[1:21:51] And I came home. And when I came home,
[1:21:57] I tried to
[1:22:00] everything they tell me, I tried to do
[1:22:04] it.
[1:22:05] Till the day I came, I was feeling so
[1:22:10] good. I said, "Okay, I'm going to come
[1:22:12] to church." I called pastor, sorry,
[1:22:15] pastor Danny, I forgot. Sister
[1:22:19] Pastor Danny with his wife,
[1:22:22] they came, they pray for me.
[1:22:26] And let me tell you that prayer wasn't a
[1:22:29] joke. When your pastor pray for you, you
[1:22:32] have to believe. If you don't believe,
[1:22:34] it won't take effect.
[1:22:37] He prayed for me.
[1:22:39] And let me tell you, that was the last
[1:22:43] prayer I received.
[1:22:46] And that was the last prayer I came out
[1:22:49] from the hospital.
[1:22:51] Okay? Because I believe
[1:22:55] that he was not just talking. He was
[1:23:00] praying and calling God for me to help
[1:23:02] me. Cuz during the time of my sickness,
[1:23:05] he was at work because he's busy at work
[1:23:08] and he can't leave it. So he communicate
[1:23:11] back and forth with pastor Simon and
[1:23:14] with the deacons. And Philillip
[1:23:17] was a man that the day that I was sick
[1:23:22] stayed there all night till Sunday
[1:23:26] morning he came to church.
[1:23:29] He didn't sleep.
[1:23:32] People don't know to worship God you
[1:23:34] have to pay the price. If you don't pay
[1:23:37] the price you don't get result.
[1:23:40] I can tell you me brother Kofi and I'm
[1:23:43] not saying this you go check me since
[1:23:47] the Lord called me this morning is here
[1:23:49] this morning is more than me here
[1:23:52] the time you don't see me in church
[1:23:55] unless something serious has happened to
[1:23:57] me or maybe something otherwise rain or
[1:24:01] sunshine I'm sitting in the house of the
[1:24:04] Lord and I believe
[1:24:08] all the preaching I hear sister rosemary
[1:24:11] know too
[1:24:13] right I don't take it as joke one time
[1:24:16] me and brother desa
[1:24:18] we drove with sister Elizabeth when we
[1:24:22] were coming the bridge they crossed the
[1:24:24] oak too much snow too much brothers you
[1:24:28] remember those days right we have to go
[1:24:30] under
[1:24:32] right we reach the church and p told
[1:24:35] there's no service we went Right? When
[1:24:40] you are a soldier,
[1:24:42] Christianity is like a soldier on the
[1:24:44] battle front. If you sleep, the enemy
[1:24:48] will kill you.
[1:24:50] So you don't have to sleep. You have to
[1:24:53] wake up with your gun sharp.
[1:24:56] Get ready to shoot the enemy. When the
[1:24:59] Lord know that you are serious like
[1:25:01] that, let me tell you what I went
[1:25:03] through.
[1:25:05] It took Jesus Christ
[1:25:08] to come down to wake me up.
[1:25:12] And if you tell me
[1:25:16] this is not how the Lord raised Lazarus,
[1:25:19] then I don't know. I am eyewitness in my
[1:25:23] time.
[1:25:25] In my time,
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; the Lord has raised me up
[1:25:30] as he raised Lazarus.
[1:25:34] Don't let no I know healing is not or
[1:25:38] raising the dead
[1:25:41] is not the fullness that won't take you
[1:25:44] to the rapture. When h the Lord sent the
[1:25:48] disciples, Judas was among them. They
[1:25:50] cast out devils, right?
[1:25:53] So healing is not the main thing but
[1:25:57] it's part of it. You understand? It give
[1:26:01] us confidence that we have the talking
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; right? It will give you confidence that
[1:26:08] you have the talking.
[1:26:11] If the Lord has done this for me,
[1:26:16] it strengthen me.
[1:26:18] I know, I have confidence
[1:26:21] that the Lord has raised me up.
[1:26:25] Why would he send brother Mike and
[1:26:27] sister to the hospital to come and read
[1:26:30] scripture to me? Why would he send them
[1:26:33] if he if it is not him? Why would he
[1:26:37] even allow pastor and pastor Simon to
[1:26:40] come and to the hospital?
[1:26:44] Why would he allow brother Phillip,
[1:26:46] brother Desmond, Sister Elizabeth, Rose
[1:26:51] to come into the hospital?
[1:26:54] Things
[1:26:56] that I went through, it was not easy.
[1:26:59] One point I told the Lord, I said, Lord,
[1:27:02] if I'm going to die
[1:27:04] and it going to glorify your name, so be
[1:27:08] it. I'm ready to go. But if it is not
[1:27:12] glorify you, then let me come back
[1:27:17] because you talk about pain. You talk
[1:27:21] about pain. My leg was my my leg on the
[1:27:25] floor was like this. One point the next
[1:27:28] when I'm in the bed like that and they
[1:27:32] try to get me up to sit and eat, they
[1:27:35] have to put their hand on my back
[1:27:38] otherwise I'll fall down.
[1:27:41] I couldn't walk. I couldn't talk. Sick
[1:27:46] pain.
[1:27:47] But I hold to the word of God. I say as
[1:27:52] if it is taking me, the sickness is
[1:27:54] taking me to grave. Lord, I'm ready. I'm
[1:27:58] ready to fight and go in.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Because
[1:28:03] we have to be serious with God.
[1:28:08] When you reach that point, my brother,
[1:28:10] no, you have it's you and God. You only
[1:28:15] and him.
[1:28:17] And believe me, he never fail. God, the
[1:28:21] Lord Jesus Christ cannot fail because
[1:28:24] what he he took me through, I'm going to
[1:28:28] I'm going to finish soon.
[1:28:30] Let me tell you,
[1:28:32] I have faith in the Lord. nothing on
[1:28:35] this head
[1:28:38] the way I went through
[1:28:40] even nurses.
[1:28:42] One doctor came to me, he look at me, he
[1:28:46] says, "When you were dead, I was right
[1:28:48] in the womb. I don't know what would
[1:28:51] take your life.
[1:28:53] I He says, "I know everybody will die. I
[1:28:56] know life if if you grow, you're going
[1:28:58] to die. But you I don't know what can
[1:29:01] take your life." And I know why he says
[1:29:04] that. Because for me, I always believe
[1:29:08] my life belong to Jesus.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Only him can take it. Him gave it to me.
[1:29:14] Him can take it.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; So and if the devil going to kill me,
[1:29:20] you have to kill Jesus in brother Kufi
[1:29:22] first. If he cannot kill that God, the
[1:29:26] Lord Jesus that live in me, nothing.
[1:29:31] Have faith in the Lord. He's real.
[1:29:34] Sister Alen, thank you for coming to the
[1:29:37] hospital. I really appreciate it with
[1:29:40] your husband. Brother Desmond, thank
[1:29:42] you. Brother Philip, thank you. Pastor,
[1:29:44] sister, thank you for coming. Thank you
[1:29:47] for all of you praying for me. People
[1:29:51] pray in Africa. People
[1:29:54] pray. People calling me I don't even
[1:29:58] know they heard it. They know some of
[1:30:01] them even sinners are saying we don't
[1:30:04] are you well now because now your mouth
[1:30:06] is is talking big
[1:30:10] you talking because we heard you were
[1:30:13] dead but how come you are alive I says
[1:30:17] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ because
[1:30:20] in Jesus there is no dead
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is the only one Lazarus
[1:30:26] trust in him Lazarus went to grave four
[1:30:29] days he raised him up. Brother, sister,
[1:30:33] have faith in the Lord.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; No matter what happened to you, have
[1:30:38] faith in the Lord. He will He will make
[1:30:41] a way when there's no way. I know God
[1:30:44] made a way for me. He made a way for me.
[1:30:48] This is reality in my soul. It's not
[1:30:51] joke. I have seen it. I'm eyewitness.
[1:30:55] You don't believe me. Come, let's go to
[1:30:58] the hospital. I have deacons, two
[1:31:00] deacons sitting here. I have pastor
[1:31:03] Simon. I have sister here. They saw,
[1:31:06] they came saw the body the way I was
[1:31:09] when my eye was not even open. My
[1:31:12] children were crying. My wife was
[1:31:15] crying. The whole house has turned
[1:31:17] upside down. Even my son Emmanuel, he
[1:31:20] doesn't come to church no more. He know
[1:31:24] God did a miracle for his father.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Emmanuel know the Lord did a miracle for
[1:31:31] his father. Let me tell you is real.
[1:31:34] This gospel brother Baram preached to
[1:31:36] us. Let us hold on. Let us back our
[1:31:39] pastor the best you can. Hold on. Don't
[1:31:44] take it as a joke. Those that are
[1:31:47] listening to me in the line. Jesus
[1:31:50] raised Lazarus. Don't let those things
[1:31:53] stay in the book. Let it come reality to
[1:31:56] you that you could express it. You could
[1:32:00] talk. You could even as I'm going I'm
[1:32:04] going to Ghana. Let me tell you there
[1:32:06] are some believers. One preacher called
[1:32:10] my wife because that time he know I was
[1:32:12] coming and my wife told him I'm in the
[1:32:15] hospital. I die and I rose up. So they
[1:32:19] know brother Kofi was dead and came
[1:32:22] back. When I go there I don't know what
[1:32:25] going to happen. The man that was dead
[1:32:28] is talking like this. Who has done that?
[1:32:30] Jesus Christ.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ has done it. The God that
[1:32:35] brother Brown talked and pastor Danny is
[1:32:38] speaking, Pastor Simon has spoken to my
[1:32:41] soul is real. Is real. Is real. Brother
[1:32:45] sister is real. It's real. is real. The
[1:32:49] gospel is real. I know you may think I'm
[1:32:52] too emotion, but no, this is reality. I
[1:32:56] saw the hands of God. Let me tell you,
[1:33:00] God brought me back. Now, he has made me
[1:33:04] whole. He has made me brand new. He has
[1:33:07] made me perfect. He has made me I don't
[1:33:10] scared of nothing in life. I'm not
[1:33:13] scared of anything because I know my God
[1:33:16] is real.
[1:33:18] Jesus is real in my soul. Let us all
[1:33:22] stand up. Pastor, thank you very much. I
[1:33:25] always back the word and it's so real
[1:33:28] tonight. That's what I have for you. May

[1:33:33] you.

[1:33:40] brother.
