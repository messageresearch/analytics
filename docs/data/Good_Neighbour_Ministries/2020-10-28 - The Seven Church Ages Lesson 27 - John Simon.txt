TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] hello and good evening friends once again we are happy to be together in the house of the lord we enjoyed last wednesday's study and now we enter into the next part of it as we continue we are speaking on the topic of cain son of satan i repeat cain son of satan our scripture reading is found in 1st john chapter 3 verses 11 and 12. let me read the word of god for this is the message you have heard from the beginning that you should love one another not as cain who was of that wicked one who slew his brother and wherefore slew he him because his own works were evil and his brothers was righteous our gracious heavenly father how thankful we are that you have opened the eyes of our hearts may the great holy spirit apply the token of the word granting to us divine understanding and wisdom whosoever you will you open and whosoever you will you shut to thine be the glory honor and praise in the name of jesus christ our lord amen praise god hallelujah so we are speaking about cain son of satan we understand clearly here that cain was of satan he displays this in his very nature he was of satan his origin was of satan for he displays his beastly and animalistic actions by his behavior by doing this through nature through his nature his character and through his actions he proves and displays to us that he indeed is the son of satan and he shows it why that he's a liar of course jesus said you are of your father the devil and he is a liar from the very beginning and all liars find their place in the pits of hell there is a place there is a position for them and it is in the pit of hell now notice carefully he was a liar but when god asked him where is your brother a bell he said i don't know that was a lie see for he had already killed him and disposed of or hid his body and god was letting him know i know all things his blood is crying to me from the ground where you hid him placed him or entombed him so he was a liar from the very beginning not only that he was a murderer for you see how he murdered his brother abel and with anger uh and displayed that quality already next he was a rebel and he was a renegade this is clearly in the scriptures you will find it in genesis chapter 4 verses 5 9 1 13 and 14. he had these inhuman beastly like characteristics and was terrible in actual fact he was a prototype of all of the rest of his generations that will would come from his genealogy or his genes he displays their nature how they will act how they will think what they will do throughout his generations throughout all time now how did an animal how did a beast like this appear suddenly on the scene in the garden of eden at the very beginning of the word the world the bible however you would like to express that when god himself when he looked down the bible records god said oh it is good it is good and suddenly it is bad why with the appearance of cain through the instrumentality of the serpent now let's see where he originated from genesis chapter 4 verse 1 and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bare cain and said i have gotten a man from the lord and she again bare his brother abel now genesis 4 25 says and adam knew his wife again and she bear a son and called his name seth now here are three sons coming on the scene uh by two acts of carnal knowledge by adam now the word of god is perfect there is no mistakes in the word of god like some may may think now three sons born by two acts of adam and we know positively definitely and conclusively that one of these three sons was not of adam or not adam's son now we understand that the truth of the matter is is that eve with her first conception and the first birth was bearing twins kane and abel now we find out france that cain subcaine's conception was slightly previous to a bells but we know that this is possible or if you will read or research this after i'm finished and this uh this broadcast is over you may go and research it how that two men going to one woman having acts with one woman in the same day it is possible for have for her to have twins by these two acts apart in time but yet she bears conception for both and produces twins you may find examples of this in bowman texas 1963 uh you may find uh various uh illustrations of this like in norway and many other countries just search for it on the internet in your encyclopedia you will find conclusive proof that this is absolutely possible now why did this have to be why did this have to happen why did the seed of the serpent have to come this way you see because man was created by god and man was created specifically to be the temple or the resting place of god in other words he would be god's masterpiece and after god is finished with his masterpiece the highest the height the crown of his creation there is nothing else for him to make so he would rest then as the bible said he rested on the perfect day now notice that man was god's temple and supposed to be the place of god's rest now in acts chapter 7 verses 46 to 51 who found favor before god and desire to find the tabernacle for the god of jacob speaking of solomon of course but solomon built him and house how be it the most high it not in temples made with hands i saith the prophet heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool what house will you build me saith the lord or what is the place of my rest had not my hand made all of these things ye and uncircumcised in ears and hearts do you do always resist the holy ghost as your fathers did so do ye now satan has known this all along that god's ultimate place position is to build a resting place for himself and that resting place is in the heart of man nor he not knowing not that you are the temple you are the temples of the holy ghost and god in this last seventh day this age this evil age of leonisia has come to find his places of his place of rest now satan knew this he was fully aware and so he as he did in the garden of eden wants to run ahead of god and and and usurp god's resting place or to indwell man before god can get to that man's heart that woman's heart to speak to them to lead them to guide them to protect them to provide for them preserve them and finally take them into his divine presence satan comes along and tries to mess up make up mix-up in every way that person's life some of us are made aware of this and we are able to come out from his trolldom his spells his charm his sins and walk into the glorious liberty of the sons and daughters of the living god and so he wants to indwell man just as god does but god has reserved that right for himself now let me refer to the fact that this is satan's desire he knows that that's what god created man for and what god desires is to have man to be his resting place this is satan's desire this is satan's highest ambition to find a man a woman that will surrender themselves to him that he might you possess them and use them to create as much evil doings wrongdoings lies murders and corruption in every form possible that he can just as he did in the heavens or tried to do in the heavens it's not possible to deceive god's elect god's angels god's sons god's daughters so he fell to earth and in falling to art you would think that he would repent you would think he would change his behavior but he doesn't change his behavior he actually doubles up his efforts trying to overthrow subvert uh deceive the the kingdom of god in even in the religious realm and not in seducing a physical body but seducing of the spirit by deceptions lies and errors and false doctrines that are so subtly constricted that if one does not listen close enough one's heart is not open close enough one will be led astray and led off of the true foundations of the word of the living god now i know many years ago uh much younger us of course brother donnie reagan a marvelous man of god preached a message called satan's desire satan's desire i can't remember what year but it really struck me satan's ambition is to take god's place to receive worship and praise like god is receiving and to find the resting place that god resting in wanted to resting or wants a desire to rest in that he might come into the temple of god and appear like god and raise and exalt himself as if he was god but we know he was kicked out of heaven he was cast out from the presence of god and as it was then so will it be and so is it for every son and daughter and child of the living god amen if you have the time try to find the message of our dear brother and listen to it it will inspire your soul and lift your spirit satan's desire satan's ambition brother donnie reagan a blessed man of god may god use him and anoint him as he brings the word of god for this hour blessing those god has placed in his care and those under the influence of the sound of his voice by the anointing of the holy spirit now we know that god alone appeared in flesh satan could not appear in flesh because he doesn't have creative powers but he could find a a creature of flesh and indwell it and in that way he can make his appearance his physical appearance and then through that creature he could make his influence his actions and his nature be displayed upon the face of the earth so to accomplish that he had to enter into the serpent there in the garden of eden i've said before i'll say it again the serpent is what they are searching for they're searching for the missing link and the missing link is really the serpent for the serpent was not a snake at that time we find out friends just as satan entered the evil spirits entered into the man from gadara and infested him with evil spirits this is his tried true evil and pernicious metal of being able to indwell possess control and use women and men as his tools for evil and corruption and evil on the face of this earth so he could not have a child directly with eve as god did by mary for god had the child a begotten son jesus christ by his spoken word for he was a creator and he is a creator and by his spoken word was create able to create this holy thing this seed of god that would be made manifest and comfort jesus christ the word made flesh and walk among us and dwell among us but so since satan could not speak his word and create a seed his other option was to end well an already existing animal being or beast and use it to be able to transform himself his influence his nature and so on his characteristics within the bloodstream in other words this is pollution the beginning of pollution we're talking about here how he polluted the entire human race polluted the entire earth and then dispersed his and spawned his evil webs lies of the and of deceit across the entire world so here we are my friends he entered into the serpent and possessed him and began to use him and the instrumentality of his physicality he was able to defile beguile seduce eve and satan my friends by satan's evil act of adultery against adam by his evil act of seduction eve was able to bear his son cain for the serpent as i explained before was not like a uh just looking like a regular animal he was the link between animal and man he looked everything like a man moved like a man talked like a man and had the intelligence utility of a man but he lacked one thing he did not have a soul he didn't have the place for a soul a soul less dead on the inside being an individual dead corrupt decadent everything in there there was no life there was no light there was darkness in him for he was a son of darkness and so satan was able to use the serpent and king came forth bearing uh the the sinful characteristics of his father satan and the animalistic nature the beast like nature sensual and fleshly of the serpent notice carefully the height breathing the spiritual characteristics of certain and in nature the natural physical characteristics of the serpent was all in this evil one now we know there's a definite affinity between man and animal and that physical uh characteristic is still there to this very day now that is the reason why you can see in some men women people around the world many have this beastly nature animalistic nature they'll kill you as a flesh they'll lie just like that you see satan is satan in other words uh satan doesn't sin satan is the ultimate sinner this is nature to sin he doesn't have to sink to sin and his generations are like that uh it just flows out of them like a bilge it flows out of them like a a cesspool it flows out of them like a swamp it flows out of them for they are the swamp they are the cesspool they are the bilge of it all and so he by nature you see now you say oh well uh uh christians uh may may sin uh yes they may sin my act but not by nature and not by nature not by choice but satan is a sinner by nature he has to do nothing he he he's just satan he's just sinful his nature's sinful evil to begin with and all of his generations are and cain and his serpent see children are of the same nature and the same generation they are sinners by nature to begin with but we the true believer and i believe i'm one of them amen they are not sinners by choice we are not sinners by nature but if we sin we have one who has laid down his life to redeem us thanks be to god but of satan's seed he saw sought repentance with tears but he could not find it how could he find it he could not find it for the very seed the very nature that was in him my friends was of satan and it could not be converted chains or anything else for it was satanic to begin with at the very origin we see therefore my friends that there is such an affinity between man and beast it's sad according to science that if one were to eat or to receive the thyroid cells or glands uh of of a hume of a of an animal it will go right to the thyroid uh of a human and let's say they were to take it and eat the kidney cells and it will go right to the human kidneys and so do you realize my friends how tremendous and stupendous this is you can apply it the opposite way from god if we eat god's word what we become the word and so and so on praise god hallelujah isn't it wonderful and stupendous when we see this now some intelligence puts these cells in their rightful places oh praise god so will the holy spirit place every believer in their rightful places to the glory of god amen now we see clearly friends in the word of god that the serpent the bible says was an upright creature he stood upright he walked he talked he reasoned and he was intelligent and to this very day upon this earth in the air in the atmosphere satan is the wisest that is all around us the only wisdom that he cannot handle is the wisdom of god the wisdom that was in solomon that was in jesus christ the wisdom of this open revealed word is the only wisdom he cannot handle other than that which man which woman whoever he be thinks he can challenge satan with his puny intelligence wisdom knowledge no you can't place yourself against this ancient evil being that's been there long before 6 000 years or whatever you want to think he was there the only person he could not overcome was god himself the only person he cannot overcome is jesus christ amen who overcame him defeated him and raised up the mighty conqueror over death held on the grave over sin and suffering praise god he's our healer he's our baptizer he's a thank god and our soon-coming king blessed be the lord glory to his marvelous and wonderful name praise god yes so satan took advantage of the physical characteristics of this serpent being animal or beast that was in the garden and so using the chemical affinity that lies between man and this first this this link that was there he used that to inseminate this woman and brought forth his son cain into manifestation god knowing that this was so wrong so evil god destroyed the pattern that is why they're searching for the missing link because it is no more god destroy that pattern because you know in the word of god it tells you from today on thy belly shalt thou go you see he was not on his belly he was standing upright he was talking he was walking and so from that day god turned the serpent into what we know today as a snake his generations i mean into what we call a snake and so there are snakes and there's still the fear between women and snakes it's still there now we know by friends no other beast can commingle with man but the affinity of that evil uh beast that satan used was the only one and god has destroyed that pattern oh there are things i could say but i'll just continue here with what i am talking about praise god of course that satan using the beast was trying to find a substitute man but there wasn't any other man but adam and he could not use adam so he had to find a substitute man and the only thing he could find was the serpent that looked like a man but was actually animalistic like some men are beastly like some people are or wicked evil to begin with so he possessed him and used him to create to bring about his desire his to achieve his foul ambitions he used the serpent at that particular time let us crystallize our thinking on this subject my friends we see here the necessity of us looking at this serpenty doctrine don't brush it aside don't just dismiss it don't think this is something far out from outer space or something it's in your bible if you are to read the book of genesis reading from chapter one two three and onwards and then by then you should have enough wisdom knowledge and revelation to be able to trace the serpent seed trail of the serpent mystery of iniquity right through the entire bible from genesis to its end in the book of revelation when it is all chained cast into the lake of fire burnt up and destroyed and then shall the righteous walk upon the ashes of the wicked whom god has destroyed according to his divine plan blessed be the name of our living god oh hallelujah glory to god amen yes sir so we see friends god allowed this in his sovereign and divine plan and purpose of redemption we understand that there were two trees in the garden the tree of life which was jesus christ and the other tree of knowledge of good and evil it's a mixed up tree a mingled up a hybrid tree it's got oranges it's got limes it's a mixed up of good and evil it can appear good uh like science it can appear good uh you know and create a car and then the car kills more people uh you know but accidents more than soldiers will kill the war or it'll create a chemical to make you well but it'll make you well in one area and unwell in five six seven eight or nine ten areas of your body and so on oh my friend that's the way it is the tree of life jesus christ the tree of knowledge of both good and evil satan right in the garden because of that came forth we see now in this world the fruits of evil in other words the fruits of the tree of knowledge and this tree this evil tree my friends is here with us today thank god that we can see also the contrast of that tree of knowledge with the tree of life we can see what has come forth from the tree of life none other but eternal life through jesus christ our lord thanks be unto god hallelujah now we know that the word has set forth that before the very foundation of the world how god's purpose was to share his eternal life with man for god already knew by his wisdom and knowledge of satan's ambush satan's ambition and his desire to exalt himself for pride always goes before the fall all right so now satan exalted himself and had to be cast down but before he even did that god had a plan aren't you glad you serve a god with a plan not just jumping around doing all kinds of things but we serve a god with a definite plan of redemption plan of purpose knows what he's doing and acting according to his words and according to his plan next week when we come back again we will talk about god's eternal plan and purpose manifest on the earth today and uh we as true believers are part of that plan we are here displaying manifesting and acting out that part of that plan of god of which we will go into as we search within the beauties of his holiness and the beauty of god's precious word hallelujah thanks be to god may god bless every one of you for this study here today may pique your mind may you search the word may you see whether these things be scriptural i want you to search in the word to see whether these things that i am a profoundly i am preaching to you are true i want to say to you they are true they are just they are revelatory they are according to the word of god and you will find it so when you read your bible open the book and read your bible for yourself you will find it in genesis chapter 2 3 4 5 and so on and see how it digresses and goes right into law the age of violence and evil and so on until to our day and our time may god bless you what a pleasure to have you with us today whether in your home whether in a far-off land whether you are right here within the city and you are listening to the word of god may god bless you real good and we'll meet again next wednesday night god bless you [Music] you
