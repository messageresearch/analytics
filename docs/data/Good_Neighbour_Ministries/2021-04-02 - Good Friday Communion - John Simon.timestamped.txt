[0:24] this good friday evening
[0:29] thanking the lord for what he has done
[0:32] for
[0:32] us which has brought us here
[0:36] together to give glory and honor
[0:40] and to worship his holy name with
[0:44] thankful hearts for what he has
[0:47] done and what he is doing

[1:36] my friends i i would like to make this
[1:40] clear to you that
[1:44] this is not the regular service
[1:48] uh where i will be preaching uh
[1:51] uh an entire sermon
[1:55] but i will make uh a table
[1:59] talk or a meditation
[2:04] something to inspire our minds
[2:09] as we think about the cross on which our
[2:12] lord jesus died
[2:15] and how he shed his blood for our sins
[2:20] rose again for our justification
[2:24] and one day my friends he ascended
[2:28] up into heaven and is soon to return
[2:32] to catch his waiting right away
[2:36] and so we are here today specifically
[2:41] for this service of
[2:44] the lord's supper also called
[2:48] communion and so
[2:51] we will spend that time
[2:54] or this time in the presence of the lord

[3:37] wonderful works to the children
[3:40] of men and again
[3:44] in psalm chapter 24
[3:48] verses 3 and 4
[3:53] who shall ascend into the hill of the
[3:56] lord
[3:59] or who shall stand in his holy place
[4:05] he that had clean hands
[4:09] and a pure heart who had not lifted up
[4:13] his
[4:14] soul onto vanity
[4:17] nor sworn deceitfully

[11:06] million i am one that you have called by
[11:10] your grace
[11:12] and i'm here today giving you thanks and
[11:14] praise o god
[11:16] in jesus marvelous and wonderful name
[11:22] shall we turn in our bibles
[11:27] to exodus chapter 20.
[11:31] exodus chapter 20
[11:37] and we will commence to read
[11:40] from verses 1
[11:43] to 17 it reads thus
[11:49] the lord speak these words saying
[11:54] i am the lord thy god
[12:00] which brought thee out of the land
[12:03] of egypt out
[12:06] of the house of bondage
[12:11] thou shalt have no other gods
[12:14] beside me
[12:18] thou shalt not make unto thee
[12:23] any graven image
[12:28] or any lightness
[12:31] of anything that is in the heavens above
[12:36] or that is in the earth beneath
[12:41] or that is in the water
[12:45] under the earth
[12:48] thou shalt not bow down to them
[12:52] nor serve them
[12:55] for i the lord thy god
[12:59] i am a jealous god
[13:02] visiting the iniquity
[13:05] of the fathers upon the children
[13:10] unto the third and fourth generations
[13:14] of them that hate me
[13:19] and showing mercy
[13:22] unto thousands of them that
[13:26] love me and keep my commandments
[13:32] thou shalt not take the name of the lord
[13:37] thy
[13:37] god in vain
[13:40] for the lord will not hold him guiltless
[13:45] that taketh his name
[13:48] in vain
[13:51] remember this sabbath day
[13:54] to keep it holy
[13:58] six days shalt thou label
[14:01] and do all thy work
[14:05] but the seventh day is the sabbath
[14:09] of the lord in it
[14:13] thou shalt do no work thou
[14:17] nor thy son nor thy daughter
[14:21] thy man's servant nor thy maid servant
[14:25] nor thy cattle nor thy stranger
[14:29] that is within thy gates
[14:33] for in six days the lord
[14:36] made heaven and earth
[14:39] the sea and all that
[14:43] in them is and
[14:46] rested on the seventh day
[14:51] wherefore the lord blessed the sabbath
[14:55] day and hallowed it
[15:00] honor thy father and thy mother
[15:06] that thy days may be
[15:09] long upon the land which the lord
[15:13] thy god giveth thee
[15:18] thou shalt not kill
[15:22] thou shalt not commit adultery
[15:28] thou shalt not steal
[15:33] thou shalt not bear false witness
[15:37] against thy neighbor
[15:42] thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife
[15:51] thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's
[15:54] house nor
[15:57] his man's servant
[16:00] nor his maidservant
[16:03] nor his ops nor his ass
[16:06] nor anything that is
[16:11] thy neighbors now of course
[16:14] the summary of all of this
[16:20] will be found in the words of the lord
[16:22] jesus christ himself
[16:25] when he spoke in matthew chapter 22
[16:30] verses 37 to 39.
[16:36] thou shalt love the lord thy god
[16:39] with all thy heart and with
[16:43] all thy soul and with all
[16:46] thy mind this is the
[16:50] first and great commandment
[16:53] and the second is like unto it
[16:57] thou shalt love thy neighbor
[17:01] as thy self
[17:04] thanks be to god we have come
[17:07] through the seventh day week
[17:11] of the seven church ages
[17:14] we are now entering in
[17:18] or have entered into the eighth day
[17:22] or which is back to the first day
[17:25] we will speak on this measure at another
[17:29] time
[17:30] why the all sabbath
[17:35] naturally speaking is not
[17:38] practiced today and
[17:41] show it clearly from the word of god
[17:46] but for now we give god the glory
[17:50] and praise for what he has given to
[17:53] us listen out of galatians
[17:58] chapter 9 if you have your bibles you
[18:01] can find that
[18:03] verses 19 to 23
[18:10] now the works of the flesh
[18:13] are manifest which are these
[18:18] adultery
[18:22] fornication
[18:26] uncleanness
[18:29] lascaviousness
[18:33] idolatry
[18:36] witchcraft hatred variance
[18:44] strife emulations
[18:49] wrath seditions
[18:54] heresies envyings
[18:59] drunkenness murders
[19:04] revelings and such light
[19:08] of the which i tell you
[19:12] before as i have told you in times past
[19:17] that they who
[19:20] do these things shall not inherit the
[19:25] kingdom of god
[19:27] but the fruit of the spirit
[19:31] is love and joy
[19:37] and peace long-suffering
[19:42] gentleness goodness
[19:46] and faith meekness
[19:51] temperance against
[19:55] such there is
[19:59] no law oh praise
[20:02] be to god amen hallelujah
[20:05] brothers and sisters how wonderful to
[20:08] know
[20:09] this is the god that we serve
[20:15] now in first corinthians chapter 11.
[20:21] we find these words for i
[20:25] have received of the lord that
[20:28] which also i delivered unto you
[20:33] that the lord jesus the
[20:36] same night in which he was betrayed
[20:40] when he had given thanks
[20:44] took bread and break it
[20:48] and said take
[20:52] eat this is my body
[20:57] which is broken for you
[21:00] this do in remembrance
[21:04] of me after the same manner
[21:10] also he took the cup
[21:14] when he had sup saying this cup
[21:18] is the new testament
[21:22] in my blood
[21:25] this do you as often as you drink it
[21:32] in remembrance of me
[21:36] for as often as you eat this bread
[21:40] and drink this cup you
[21:44] do show the lord's
[21:47] death till he comes
[21:50] again wherefore
[21:55] whosoever shall eat this bread
[21:58] and drink this cup of the lord
[22:01] unworthily shall be guilty
[22:06] of the body and blood
[22:09] of the lord but let a man
[22:13] let a woman let a young person
[22:17] let a child let
[22:20] them examine themselves
[22:24] and so let them eat
[22:27] of this bread
[22:30] and of this cup
[22:34] shall we sing a wonderful hymn of praise
[22:37] and glory
[22:38] to god while the thankfulness
[22:43] of worship springs up like a well
[22:47] within our heart i believe a fitting
[22:50] song
[22:51] will be on a hill
[22:54] far away stood an
[22:58] old rugged cross the
[23:01] emblem of suffering and shame

[27:39] yes my brothers and sisters
[27:42] one day soon we'll share his glory
[27:46] together with him as
[27:48] his beloved bride
[27:51] we look to that wonderful day
[27:55] we are watching we are waiting
[27:58] faithfully for the coming of the lord
[28:02] to catch his waiting bride away
[28:05] he who promised in his word i
[28:09] go to prepare a place for you
[28:13] that where i am you may
[28:16] be also if it were not so
[28:20] i would have told you in my
[28:23] father's house there are many mansions
[28:26] praise be to god hallelujah
[28:30] i thank god for this marvelous word this
[28:33] marvelous promise and this great
[28:36] sacrifice that he has made
[28:41] just a brief talk
[28:44] about remember his sacrifice
[28:49] just a little meditation that we can
[28:53] take within our hearts now paul was
[28:56] speaking here to the corinthian church
[29:02] and this church had a lot of problems
[29:07] and one of its main problems was that
[29:11] it was compromising and putting up with
[29:15] sin
[29:17] amongst its members or its membership
[29:24] also they have no problem
[29:28] in treating some people better
[29:31] than others whether by
[29:36] position uh whether by
[29:39] wealth or poverty
[29:43] whether by education or
[29:46] lack of education whether black or
[29:50] white or brown or or yellow
[29:53] whatever they were making a
[29:56] difference amongst the brethren
[30:01] and the lord has taught us we are
[30:04] one in the
[30:07] words of a great uh marvelous
[30:10] um troubadour
[30:13] one love one heart
[30:18] one soul one faith one lord
[30:23] one baptism all one
[30:26] holy spirit within our hearts within our
[30:30] lives
[30:31] oh glory be to god but they were making
[30:34] a difference
[30:36] for god has made of all men
[30:40] one blood that's found in the book of
[30:43] acts
[30:44] god is made of all nations of one blood
[30:48] praise god regardless of your
[30:51] outside color inside we are of
[30:54] one blood we are one people
[30:57] in christ and the love of god
[31:01] fills our hearts and our minds that we
[31:04] see
[31:05] jesus only in our brothers
[31:08] and sisters amen
[31:11] another problem in the church
[31:15] is that they had
[31:18] no there was no restraint
[31:22] upon them with holding
[31:25] food and shelter
[31:29] or clothing or any kind of
[31:32] help from those who were
[31:36] less fortunate they had
[31:39] this kind of a mentality and culture
[31:42] well every man or woman for themselves
[31:47] and uh you do your best
[31:50] and i'm going to do whatever i can and
[31:52] if you would help yourself i would help
[31:54] you
[31:55] that was not so with the true people of
[31:58] god
[31:59] for the bible says in the book of acts
[32:02] they
[32:02] had all things common
[32:05] and they helped the brethren in
[32:09] various ways that they could
[32:12] they reached out to one another
[32:15] and shared the love of god and the
[32:18] bounty and the blessing of the lord upon
[32:22] their lives
[32:24] now that church used to have something
[32:27] called a
[32:28] love feast today we will call it
[32:32] uh a barbecue or a church potluck
[32:36] supper but you see
[32:39] certain members held back their potluck
[32:43] their rich wonderful well-prepared food
[32:48] they held it back from some while they
[32:51] gave to others
[32:53] they had partiality amongst them
[32:56] and they did not share equally and
[32:59] freely
[33:00] whatever they had with the love
[33:04] of god within their hearts
[33:08] amen and paul warned them
[33:12] that whenever you did that you were
[33:15] sinning against god
[33:17] and you need to examine yourself
[33:22] you cannot come
[33:25] to the lord's table with sin
[33:29] within the heart that is why the bible
[33:33] tells us
[33:35] let a person man woman young person
[33:38] child examine themselves
[33:41] examine take a counter account of
[33:45] yourself
[33:47] you'll take your account book and you
[33:48] check on your accounts to see
[33:50] if you're owing or if you are you're in
[33:53] the red
[33:54] you check your comic books let us check
[33:57] our lives
[33:59] let us search our hearts let us take a
[34:03] count
[34:04] to see where we stand with god you say
[34:07] well brother simon i can't take the
[34:09] lord's supper
[34:10] uh today because of this or because of
[34:14] that or
[34:14] i know i done this or i said that or i
[34:17] even sought that
[34:18] or when i was coming to church and i had
[34:20] an argument or something
[34:22] whatever it is listen the bible tells us
[34:27] even if we did something wrong one
[34:30] minute ago
[34:31] but if we come and we confess our faults
[34:35] our sins our mistakes
[34:38] we repent of the wrong we have done
[34:42] oh my praise the lord he says he is
[34:45] just and he is able
[34:48] and willing to forgive us
[34:53] of all our sins and cleanse us
[34:57] in his precious blood oh precious is the
[35:00] flow
[35:01] that makes me whiter snow
[35:04] no other fountain i know nothing
[35:08] but the blood of jesus oh thanks be unto
[35:11] god
[35:12] hallelujah amen now what are the proper
[35:16] elements for the lord's supper
[35:20] of course it is the bread
[35:24] and the wine the bread
[35:28] represents of course his broken body
[35:32] broken for us
[35:35] when this suffer he suffered for
[35:39] us i as isaiah told us as matthew mark
[35:43] luke and john tells us
[35:45] they they hit him with the whips
[35:49] with metal pieces on the end
[35:52] ripped the flesh from his body he was
[35:55] wounded for our transgressions
[36:00] he was bruised for our iniquities
[36:05] the chastisement of our peace
[36:08] was upon him and by his stripes
[36:13] we are healed oh praise
[36:16] god he who knew no sin became
[36:20] sin for us that we may go free in other
[36:23] words
[36:24] the devil would have kept you in his
[36:26] jailhouse
[36:27] but jesus took your place so that you
[36:30] may come out
[36:31] and walk free and whole and saved
[36:35] by the grace of god
[36:38] the wine represents notice i said wine
[36:43] the bible doesn't tell us juice
[36:46] the bible does not tell us pepsi or
[36:50] coke just because it looks like wine
[36:54] the bible does not tell us crackers
[36:57] because it looks like bread
[37:00] oh no the bread of course should be
[37:03] unleavened bread no yeast in it
[37:08] and the wine should be real
[37:12] wine because the wine has stimulative
[37:16] properties
[37:18] and that stimulation represents
[37:22] the activity of the holy spirit
[37:26] upon the word that is in your heart
[37:31] that the holy spirit will stimulate the
[37:34] word that is within your
[37:36] heart oh praise god hallelujah
[37:39] the holy spirit quickens the word that
[37:42] is within your heart
[37:43] this is what the wine represents
[37:48] representing the blood of jesus which
[37:52] the pentecostals don't understand
[37:54] that it's not speaking of red blood
[37:57] that dropped on the ground in israel
[38:00] when he was
[38:00] when he was killed on the cross but the
[38:04] blood the life is in the blood
[38:09] and the wine is a symbol of his
[38:12] life it's a token of his life
[38:15] hallelujah so you're saying lord i
[38:19] i examine myself i repent i cast off my
[38:23] old life i cast off my old habits i
[38:26] break every curse i cast it all away
[38:28] from myself
[38:30] and i take into a and upon me
[38:33] the life of jesus christ may his life
[38:38] hallelujah fill my heart fill my
[38:41] life fill my being right now because i
[38:44] take his life within me
[38:47] of course the wine which represents the
[38:51] blood
[38:53] also look that looks back to the time
[38:56] when they sacrifice animals
[39:00] lambs goats sheep
[39:03] you know in the time of israel
[39:07] the blood of those animals was
[39:10] accepted by god as a covering
[39:14] for their sins so the wine
[39:18] let us look back to that that christ was
[39:21] and is our covering oh
[39:24] praise god hallelujah
[39:28] but my friends now we take him he bear
[39:31] look
[39:32] he has already shed his blood
[39:35] now not only as a covering
[39:39] but his blood is like bleach
[39:43] that cleanses us bleaches out
[39:46] the dark spots in our lives takes away
[39:50] all the oily evil of satan from
[39:53] us and makes us white as snow
[39:58] our hearts and hands and voices
[40:01] lifted up to him in praise
[40:04] and honor and glory
[40:08] and so let us come with the proper
[40:11] attitude to god forbid the proper
[40:15] attitude of reverence
[40:19] solemnity sincerity
[40:24] a brokenness before the lord
[40:28] hallelujah now
[40:33] as we take the lord's supper as i've
[40:36] said and will repeat
[40:40] let us examine ourselves
[40:46] and we should examine ourselves because
[40:50] sin keeps us
[40:53] from the proper relationship
[40:57] and fellowship with god
[41:01] so let us examine ourselves
[41:04] while i'm yet speaking begin to search
[41:08] your heart
[41:10] and begin to ask god search me o god
[41:15] and know my heart today cleanse me o
[41:19] savior from all my sins i pray
[41:24] see if there be any wicked way in me and
[41:27] cleanse me from every sin lord
[41:30] and set me free hallelujah
[41:35] so we come and examine ourselves
[41:39] that we may have the right relationship
[41:44] between us and god
[41:47] and we also coming examining ourselves
[41:50] because we have blessed assurance from
[41:54] him
[41:55] that if you come you confess your sins
[41:59] confess your faults i will
[42:02] forgive oh praise
[42:05] god there's a little old song i love to
[42:08] sing and the saints of god have heard me
[42:10] sing it before
[42:12] and it goes something like this if i
[42:16] have won that sum for soul today
[42:21] [Music]
[42:22] if i have walked in my
[42:27] own will for way
[42:30] o or if i
[42:34] offend some other true
[42:38] the strain dear lord
[42:44] forgive
[42:45] [Music]
[42:47] forgive the sins that i
[42:51] confess to thee
[42:55] forgive the
[42:58] things i cannot say
[43:03] oh god may god forgive us of our sins
[43:07] cleanse us from our inequities and draw
[43:11] us closer to him
[43:12] and bring us into a right relationship
[43:16] with him and there are others
[43:20] despite what i'm saying that
[43:24] who will not examine themselves
[43:27] who will not search their hearts who
[43:29] will not give up their crimes their evil
[43:32] and their faults their habits
[43:36] that they hold to them the bible tells
[43:40] us
[43:40] they will be judged by the living god
[43:43] for it says
[43:44] for this reason some are weak
[43:49] some are sick and others sleep
[43:53] in other words some
[43:56] are made sick and others
[43:59] even die because they will not repent
[44:04] and they will not take the lord's supper
[44:08] they will not turn away from the sins
[44:10] that are plaguing their lives
[44:12] and therefore they suffer the effects of
[44:16] it within
[44:19] their heart my friends
[44:23] let me give you a few moments right now
[44:28] to examine your heart
[44:31] we'll be bar heads we close our eyes
[44:36] will we ask the lord to
[44:39] cleanse us from our sins
[44:42] let us do self-examination now
[44:45] in the quietness in the presence
[44:51] of the lord
[45:29] lift up your heads
[45:32] look up praise god
[45:36] for this moment of self examination
[45:42] of course it's the lord jesus himself
[45:44] this is not a tradition of man
[45:47] man has taken it and tried to turn it
[45:49] into a tradition
[45:52] but we do not do this by tradition
[45:55] we do this by faith by revelation
[45:59] knowing what we are doing
[46:02] we come believing and we go
[46:06] rejoicing hallelujah
[46:09] for in these simple elements
[46:17] represented here before me
[46:26] we in this we see the
[46:30] spiritual element
[46:34] the profundity of the
[46:37] of these emblems
[46:41] the deep representation
[46:44] of them the wine
[46:48] which represents his blood
[46:52] and the bread which represents
[46:56] his broken body
[47:01] friends we are blessed we have
[47:05] these memorials given to us from his
[47:10] own hands saying do this
[47:14] as a memorial unto me do this
[47:17] in remembrance of
[47:20] me and when we come to this table
[47:25] we come to meet with our savior
[47:29] individually as we talk to him
[47:33] within our hearts expressing our more
[47:38] our innermost thoughts
[47:41] fears unspoken
[47:44] things that none other can hear
[47:49] for we are not told in the bible we
[47:51] ought to confess to
[47:52] a a man a priest or person whoever
[47:56] but we are to confess to the lord jesus
[48:00] christ himself hallelujah
[48:03] for he is the only mediator between
[48:07] god and man jesus christ
[48:11] so we come to this table to meet with
[48:15] our savior
[48:17] to look back upon that's his sacrifice
[48:23] and to ask for the cleansing
[48:27] and forgiveness of our sins
[48:31] we come also to refresh
[48:34] ourselves to renew
[48:38] our walk with god hallelujah
[48:42] and if we have fallen away somewhat to
[48:45] restore
[48:46] our face and restore our cells
[48:50] in the presence of the living god
[48:53] and to restore ourselves
[48:57] as part of this body to renew ourselves
[49:02] in the local church
[49:06] and to my friends feel refreshed with
[49:10] our
[49:10] sense of redemption and forgiveness
[49:15] that comes from the hand of god
[49:18] and to revive our hopes
[49:23] on our faith in the return
[49:27] of our lord jesus
[49:31] and the rapture of his beloved bride
[49:34] it is with joy excitement that i await
[49:38] the coming of the lord my friends
[49:42] in the words of god's servant prophet
[49:45] there is no future but the coming of the
[49:50] lord

[49:54] times

[50:00] understand what the
[50:02] evening lights have come oh praise
[50:05] god god's prophet has walked the land

[50:16] light
[50:17] and the light is here our eyes have been
[50:19] opened
[50:20] and we give him the praise and the honor
[50:23] and the glory o praise god
[50:28] now as we
[50:32] come to the lord's supper itself
