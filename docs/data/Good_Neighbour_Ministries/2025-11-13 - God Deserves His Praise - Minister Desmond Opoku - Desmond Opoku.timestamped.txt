[10:39] Where would I [singing]
[10:40] be

[11:05] today?
[11:08] What would I have [music] done [singing]
[11:12] my life?
[11:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's bow our hearts before
[11:16] the Lord. Father, we are so grateful for
[11:18] your grace, Lord.
[11:21] If it wasn't for your grace, where would
[11:23] we be, Lord Jesus? Lord, [music]
[11:25] sometimes we judge oursel based on our
[11:28] merit system that we have in our minds
[11:31] and when we fail and hour or a day, we
[11:34] we we kind of question oursel. [music]
[11:37] But Lord, if it wasn't for your grace,
[11:38] God, we know it's only by your grace
[11:41] that we are making it. Father, there's
[11:43] nothing [music] that we have done to
[11:44] inherit this grace. Father, so we thank
[11:46] you tonight, oh God, as we come into
[11:48] your house with thanksgiving in our
[11:50] hearts for what you have done for us, oh
[11:52] God, calling us and making us a part of
[11:55] you, Lord, before the foundation of the
[11:58] world. We could say, oh God, that
[11:59] [music] we are a blessed people tonight,
[12:01] Father. And that's why we're here to
[12:02] worship you and to to hear from you
[12:05] tonight, Father. Father, as your speaker
[12:07] would come, Lord, you take him, set him
[12:09] aside this night and [music] use him in
[12:11] a mighty way, oh God, [snorts] you know
[12:14] who the speaker is. I don't know, but
[12:15] you know, Lord, what we need is a a
[12:18] total surrendered vessel from you this
[12:20] night, Lord, [music] so you can speak
[12:22] through that vessel tonight, Lord. We
[12:24] came to hear from you. And that's all we
[12:25] want to do is to hear how we can be
[12:27] better. How we can leave this place and
[12:29] walk out there, Father, and to face the
[12:32] challenges of the world. And there are
[12:33] many, Father. There's many, many
[12:35] challenges in this journey, Father, but
[12:37] oh God, you have already made a way for
[12:39] us to come through it, Lord. Through it
[12:42] all, we learn to [music] trust in you.
[12:44] Through it all, we [snorts] learn to
[12:45] depend on you, Father. So tonight, oh
[12:47] God, as we come, we humble ourselves
[12:50] before you, God, to hear from you.
[12:52] Tonight, you set us aside, oh God. Open
[12:54] up our hearts, Lord, as the song said.
[12:56] Open our hearts, Lord, to receive what
[12:59] you have given unto us tonight, already
[13:01] given. We ask this in your precious name
[13:03] we pray. Amen. Amen. You love him
[13:06] tonight. I'm glad to be in [music] his
[13:08] house. Amen.

[26:03] &gt;&gt; We're going to read the book of uh St.
[26:06] Luke
[26:08] chapter 19 verse 29
[26:12] 29-4
[26:17] [snorts] St. In Luke
[26:19] 19:29-4
[26:22] And it came to pass when he was come
[26:25] near to Beth
[26:29] and Bethany at a m at a mount called the
[26:33] Mount of Olives. He sent two of his
[26:36] disciples, saying, "Go ye into the
[26:38] village over against you.
[26:43] In the which acts you are entering,
[26:48] ye shall find a coat tied whereon yet
[26:52] never man shall lose him and bring him
[26:56] hither."
[26:58] And if any man asks you, why do you lose
[27:01] him? Thou shall say, thou shall ye say
[27:06] unto him, because the Lord has need of
[27:09] him. And they that were sent went their
[27:14] way, and found even as he had said unto
[27:18] them. And as they were loosening the
[27:21] coat, the owner thereof said unto them,
[27:25] Why loose ye the coat? And they said,
[27:28] The Lord needed of him. And they brought
[27:31] him to Jesus, and they cast their
[27:34] garment upon the cold, and they set
[27:39] Jesus there on.
[27:42] And as he went, they spread their
[27:45] clothes in the way. And when he saw when
[27:50] he was come near even now at the descent
[27:54] of the Mount Olive, the whole multitude
[27:57] of the disciple began to rejoice and
[28:00] praise God with a loud voice for all the
[28:05] mighty work that they had seen,
[28:10] saying, "Blessed be the king that cometh
[28:13] in the name of the Lord. peace in heaven
[28:17] and glory in the highest. And some of
[28:20] the Pharisees from among the multitudes
[28:23] said unto him, Master, rebuke thy
[28:26] disciples. And he said, and he answered
[28:29] and said unto them, I tell you that if
[28:33] thee should hold their peace, the stone
[28:37] will immediately cry out. May the Lord
[28:40] add his blessing.
[28:42] Um maybe maybe se may maybe be seated.
[28:45] You may be seated.
[28:48] My topic tonight
[28:52] God deserve his praises.
[28:56] God deserve his praises.
[29:00] Hallelujah.
[29:03] &gt;&gt; We have to praise
[29:06] our king
[29:08] &gt;&gt; the Lord Jesus Christ. where the word
[29:11] said even
[29:13] if these people stop rejoicing
[29:17] the soul will rise up every living thing
[29:20] will stand up and praise him because he
[29:23] was God and everything that's around
[29:26] them was created for him.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:28] &gt;&gt; So every everything on this earth has to
[29:32] praise the Lord.
[29:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:36] I believe every believer [clears throat]
[29:40] have to learn to praise the Lord.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; You don't have to the preacher don't
[29:45] have to come and stand here praise the
[29:48] Lord and you stand praise the Lord. That
[29:51] is not real
[29:54] &gt;&gt; to me. That doesn't read that a preacher
[29:57] will come and stand on the pulpit and
[30:00] preaching the mighty gospel that God has
[30:03] given you and tell you praise the Lord.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; That's not right. There's something that
[30:10] is in you have to tell you you have to
[30:11] praise him.
[30:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; Nobody can tell me that I shouldn't
[30:18] praise my Lord.
[30:21] Hallelujah.
[30:22] God deserve his praises from the SAINTS
[30:25] OF GOD ALL THE TIME.
[30:29] &gt;&gt; Not sometime, all the time.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; I love to praise the Lord. It doesn't
[30:38] matter where I stand.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; Even my death, I going to wake up and
[30:43] praise the Lord before I GO BACK.
[30:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[30:47] AND when I believe if the Lord tell it
[30:50] and I I I I even lay down before the
[30:53] time, you're going to see me smiling.
[30:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I will I will squeeze my FACE
[30:58] BECAUSE WHAT GOD HAS GIVEN TO ME
[31:01] &gt;&gt; NOBODY ON THIS EARTH
[31:03] &gt;&gt; CAN GIVE it to me.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; I'M TELLING YOU I AM HAPPY.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; When I say I am happy, I am happy.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. THANK YOU.
[31:14] &gt;&gt; NOBODY CAN MAKE ME HAPPY THAN GOD.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE EVERY MAN CAN FAIL
[31:20] ME, BUT GOD CAN NEVER FAIL ME.
[31:22] HALLELUJAH.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN. GLORY TO GOD. WE THAT'S WHY I
[31:26] ALWAYS SAY WE ARE THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE on
[31:28] the face OF THE EARTH.
[31:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HOW CAN YOU WAKE UP IN THE
[31:32] MORNING? It's God that WAKES YOU UP.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU GO TO WORK? GOD THAT TAKE
[31:36] YOU TO WORK.
[31:37] &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU COME TO CHURCH? GOD BRING
[31:39] YOU HERE.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; Why you BRING YOU HERE FOR? HE BRING YOU
[31:42] HERE TO PRAISE HIM.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; TO GLORIFY HIM.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[31:50] &gt;&gt; I believe there is no limitation
[31:54] &gt;&gt; to praise our God.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; You know every time we come here and the
[32:01] and the and the brother come here to
[32:03] stand there, let your church pass up, WE
[32:06] ARE HERE TO WHAT? TO WORSHIP HIM. WHY
[32:08] GOD TELL DAVID? David is a MAN OF MY
[32:12] HEART.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; DAVID IS A MAN OF PRAISE.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; YEAH. Have you ever checked in the book
[32:18] of Psalms?
[32:20] &gt;&gt; Lord of praises
[32:24] HOW THAT JERICHO FELL DOWN THE PRAISES.
[32:29] They sang, they danced, THEY PUT A
[32:32] tambourine and what and and they have
[32:35] that in the uh what do you the the
[32:38] trumpet?
[32:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they ser and when they going
[32:42] and they dancing and they praising and
[32:44] THEY ARE REJOICING. THE LORD HAS DONE IT
[32:47] ALREADY BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE him that HE
[32:49] HAS ALREADY DONE IT.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; SO THEY REJOICE BEFORE THEY SEE THE
[32:53] ACTION.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE ACTION OF GOD,
[32:56] PRAISE HIM.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; THEN YOU CAN SEE THE ACTION OF GOD IN
[32:59] YOUR LIFE. HALLELUJAH.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; Oh glory. Hallelujah. I'm tell you I'm
[33:04] happy.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; I am excited.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHEN IT COMES TO THE GOSPEL
[33:09] OF THE LORD JESUS CHRIST, I BECAME SO
[33:11] EXCITED. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; THE PEOPLE MAY THINK THAT I'M I'M
[33:15] CUCKOO, BUT THAT'S THE WAY I WORSHIP MY
[33:17] GOD.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HALLELUJAH.
[33:21] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, JESUS.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; I find out even this message, people shy
[33:29] to praise God.
[33:31] SOMEBODY CAN SIT IN THE CHURCH THE WHOLE
[33:34] OF HIS LIFE NEVER AT ONE TIME praise the
[33:36] Lord until the pastor or the minister
[33:38] tell him praise the Lord before he
[33:40] praise God.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; What kind of believer is that? I too
[33:45] HAPPY FOR WHAT GOD HAS DONE FOR you
[33:47] &gt;&gt; on Calvary
[33:50] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE WAS HANGING ON THE CROSS.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN
[33:55] ME? HALLELUJAH. WHO? BECAUSE OF YOU.
[33:58] HALLELUJAH.
[34:00] THANK YOU JESUS. If the Lord Jesus
[34:03] Christ hasn't come where we will be
[34:06] standing today.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; Can you remember where you took from?
[34:20] Where you took me from?
[34:22] &gt;&gt; I was no good. Amen.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; So this one always comes to my heart
[34:27] &gt;&gt; when he reach
[34:30] &gt;&gt; down the side
[34:32] &gt;&gt; for me. If I I don't know I I I want to
[34:35] sing this song but I don't know. Can
[34:37] somebody sing this song for me?
[34:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; Brother, can you sing this song for me
[34:42] please?
[34:45] &gt;&gt; For me.
[34:49] I was lost
[34:51] and done
[34:54] without God.
[34:59] When he reached
[35:02] down his hand
[35:04] for me.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; Yes. When he reach [singing]
[35:15] for me
[35:17] [singing]

[35:28] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU JESUS.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; I WAS LOST. HALLELUJAH. AND DOWN.
[35:35] We are God.
[35:41] When he reach [clears throat]
[35:44] his hand
[35:46] for me.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; One more time.
[35:50] When he reach
[35:53] down his hand
[35:55] for me
[36:00] when he reached [singing]
[36:03] his hand
[36:06] for me.
[36:10] I was lost
[36:13] and undone
[36:16] waiting on God
[36:19] for his son
[36:21] when he reach
[36:27] for me.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[36:34] Without
[36:35] him,
[36:37] WE WERE THE FILTHIEST DEFEAT OF A FITY.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GOD
[36:45] REACHED DOWN [screaming] HIS HAND
[36:47] &gt;&gt; AND PICK YOU UP.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHY CAN'T I PRAISE HIM?
[36:53] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY DAVID PRAISE THE LORD
[36:55] &gt;&gt; AND DANCE.
[36:57] HE IS NOT [screaming] ASHAMED OF
[36:59] ANYTHING THAT'S AROUND HIM.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY HE PRAISE THE LORD.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[37:06] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU JESUS.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; When you go to hospital, how people lay
[37:12] down,
[37:14] &gt;&gt; they can't EVEN MOVE.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; ALL WHAT THEY CRAVING IS FOR LIFE.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; BUT THERE'S NO HELP. ONLY Jesus
[37:24] &gt;&gt; can give that life TO THAT PERSON.
[37:27] HALLELUJAH. THE DOCTORS CANNOT GIVE THEM
[37:29] LIFE.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[37:32] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD HIMSELF. HE SAID, "I AM THE
[37:35] LORD GOD WHO HEAL ALL THEIR DISEASES."
[37:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, JESUS.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; OH, glory to his name.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; What I hate in my life when I see
[37:47] SOMEBODY SUFFERING, I CANNOT PASS BY
[37:50] THAT PERSON WITHOUT THINKING OF HIM.

[45:30] go.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; I I PRESERVE HER TO GLORIFY ME.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; THE SISTER IS not well but she came and
[45:39] stood here and glorify. Aren't you
[45:42] happy?
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Were you not blessed when that sister
[45:46] SUNG THAT SON? I WAS CRYING [screaming]

[45:57] &gt;&gt; OH, glory to God.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, brethren, I'm sorry to scream. I am
[46:04] happy.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; I am happy.
[46:08] If you go Psalm 34:1, his praises
[46:11] continue be in my mouth
[46:16] &gt;&gt; continually.
[46:18] Not sometime, continually.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Psalm 15:23.
[46:25] Who offerth praises glorify me.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Who offer praises glorify who? God.
[46:37] Amen.
[46:39] 66 and 66 says 2,
[46:43] make his praises glorious.
[46:48] Hebrew 13:15,
[46:50] offer sacrifices of praise.
[46:55] Psalm 63:3,
[46:58] my lips shall praise thee.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Your lips shall praise God.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; WHOSE LIPS YOU.
[47:07] YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN PRAISE God
[47:10] &gt;&gt; for him to to BE HAPPY

[47:44] Hallelujah.
[47:46] Thank you Lord.
[47:48] Sometimes all thy works
[47:53] shall praise thee.
[47:57] Isaiah 38:9. There's a lot of excuses
[48:01] about praises, but I just pick up a few.
[48:06] Isaiah 38:19,
[48:08] the living shall praise thee. The
[48:10] living, the living, THAT MEANS THE DEAD
[48:14] CANNOT praise God. SO WE CAN PRAISE HIM
[48:16] WHILE WE ARE ALIVE.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; OH, glory to God.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; WHY THE CHILDREN OF GOD CAN PRAISE GOD?
[48:27] Every time when you read the Bible, you
[48:29] see when the Jewish the the our
[48:31] brethren, the Jewish people when they
[48:34] worshiping and dancing,
[48:36] they form a circle and and singing and
[48:40] go around and dancing and dancing and
[48:44] praising the Lord.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; They know how to praise our God.
[48:50] Let us learn how to PRAISE OUR GOD. THEN
[48:52] YOU SEE the glory of God.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:56] Amen.
[48:58] Acts 2:47.
[49:01] Praising God
[49:05] and having favor
[49:07] with the people
[49:10] and the Lord added to the church daily
[49:13] such as should be saved. Praising God
[49:17] and the Lord have a favor and he added

[49:25] uh such as should be saved.
[49:29] Hallelujah.
[49:30] Thank you Lord.
[49:34] Hallelujah.
[49:37] David was a man of
[49:41] God heart.
[49:44] Why David love the Lord? And when you
[49:49] love the Lord, you have to let him know
