one sinner repented all the Heavenly Host Rejoice today is a rejoicing Day in heaven because Jo David has come to the Lord amen um we all know also that salvation baptism that's not saved but it's an outward expressing what has already taken place in the inside so it's that there something has touched his heart taking place inside his expressing outside for everyone to Bear witness of that so without wasting much time you read our first scripture here it's Mark chapter 16:1 15 it said that and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believed and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and in Luke and in Acts chapter 2 verse 37-39 now when they heard this they were prick in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized everyone of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is onto you and to your children and to them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call is the Lord still calling amen hallelujah okay um Jo so did you came here on your free Accord did you came like your free agency did anybody force you to do it or your own decision your you renounce Satan all his activities you

has come on his own free will to surrender his life to you to live a Christian Life oh God your word clearly said that you hold the keys of David father when you shut no one can open and when you open no one can shut but upon the witness of everyone here father we praying we asking that you reveal yourself to him you open the windows of every open his understanding let the word of God becomes more clear revelation of the word in his life oh God may this word become so real may his life never be the same today Lord we pray that your presence overshadow him that Lord everything has done the past is gone and all his past is gone there comes out a new creature living and giving praise to the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen okay so upon the confession of um Joe David's faith I'm now baptizing him in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus [Applause] [Music] Christ I just want to say um Jesus his timing is precise he's always there there precise that's all [Applause] amen amen timing is right

verse says oh where do I go where there's no one else to turn who do I talk to when no one wants to listen who do I lean on when there's no Foundation stable I go to the Rock I know he able I go to the Rock I go to the rock of my salvation we're welcoming our pastor former Pastor brother John Simon this morning give my hand clap and say thank you Lord round me God bless you rock when I need [Music] amen amen I go to the rock of my salvation the Lord bless you it's so good to be here and to share with you the joy and a life of the Lord Jesus Christ God bless you all we look to the word of God I realize that this is Mother's Day and uh you'd like to get out there and celebrate motherhood and be a blessing to your own mothers right so God bless you we'll look to the word in Exodus chapter 20 open your Bibles you have a Bible if you don't have one just tell the deacons and they'll see about it right okay Exodus 20 and this is a scripture we all should know if we don't know and it reads briefly honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee amen may the Lord bless this scripture words of God to our hearts and Minds today let us pray our gracious God our heavenly father as we enter into thy presence just by speaking about the word of God like the disciples on the road to OS uh when they began to talk about you your presence Drew near we will ask that that will repeat again that while we are thinking and talking and uh worshiping thee and thinking about thee that you will draw near to us in reality that we might not have to imagine it but we shall realize Lord God that not just brother Simon speaking up here but you are here behind us with us around us surrounding us embracing us and showing your great love to us bless us today as we honor mothers we thank you for this opportunity and bless your holy name in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you please be seated I am sure that as Believers as Christians you may know the old song that speaks about the love of God the love of God is greater far than any tongue of P or pen of men can ever tell oh yes God's love is deep God's love is wide indeed and I certainly believe that do you yes well I mentioned that because A Mother's Love is akin to God's love in other words words God portrays himself through a mother's love for her child to reflect his love for his children now he couldn't find like a better uh example to show his steadfast unmoving unswerving love regardless of what circumstances their child find itself in a mother's love is like that now uh our Prophet brother Branham the 20th century prophet and not just our Prophet but he was and the prophet to the 20th century whether you're saved you're unsaved Elijah was still the pastor to the entire all of Israel and there he was and uh brother brandham says plainly his father was a drunkard his father loved to drink and uh I and he but he also worked hard to provide for his family to take care of his own he says I seen my f daddy worked so hard till he would come home his back would be sunburnt until his shirt would be sticking to his back and mother would have to come and clip that shirt loose from his back let me tell you I don't care what he's done he still my daddy he didn't approve of what his father did but he said I don't care what he done he still my dad in simple terms you can't change that fact you can't change the fact of who is your mother or who is your father and so you love them anyhow regardless of what they might have done he says uh today I have if you're fortunate today if you have a daddy and a Mothers still living love them is that right love them honor them for the hour will come when you think you're the they're the greatest people in the world Amen and so one of these days when they go out of the room in a casket filled with flowers you see them Lord in the ground and hear the pastor say ashes ashes dust to dust oh then you won't call him old man then you won't say my old lady then you will want to say oh mother oh mother you'll be ringing your hands and crying that's right while she's living give her flowers is that right in other words don't give them flowers after their dead a casket full of flowers give them flowers now can you say amen amen can you say I will right my goodness you see people die and then they fill up their casket with flowers all around it looks good it's nice but that's not when you should have given them theow flowers you should have given them the flowers while they are alive while they're living while they can hear you and while you can talk to them and express your love your appreciations your respects right or they've done something good and you want to thank them that's the this is the time when we ought to do that amen all right see you love them and now we find you want to give them flow give Mom her flowers give Dad his flowers the but the best flower that you can ever give them is to obey them while they here isn't that the first promise in the Bible First uh commandment uh promise commandment with a promise in the Bible honor thy father and thy mother which will lengthen the days you have upon this Earth that the Lord God giveth onto thee see oh he says you know I looked there I saw my dad he was dying oh I tell you be kind to your mother would you obey that be kind to your mother right and when he was dying he just beginning to gray a bit in the temples laid there in the casket I picked up his head which he dyed right on my arm and I picked up his head his locks of hair fell down and I thought oh Dad I looked at his hand and he had one of his fingers cut off in a shredder from hard work one day I thought of all the heartaches that I caused him while he was alive see oh my that was my daddy I don't care who else what they thought about him he is still my dad amen praise God hallelujah my friends let me tell you this is a reality and those of you who have your mothers with you I don't mean just here in the building but your mother is with you here in uh in this land of the living appreciate them love them show your care for them right they cared for you now you reach out and care for them now here was brother brandham in a prayer line and under discernment he said to a young girl he says you look like a sweet fine healthy girl but you're not I see you have asthma oh my I see you have asthma don't you honey you have an awful time with it you just cough and cough and at nighttime your mother has to get up with you sometime and she has to set up and and you cough isn't that right and I look and I see your mother just working working she's working through the night oh my how many of us don't know that my friends that's a mother's love amen when you're just a baby you're just a child you're sick might be just a cough might be AIC you have a little fever or something and you begin to cough and and you have a little you know some stomach ache or something your mother doesn't care the tiniest thing that happens to you right away she she turns right right away you would think that she is sleeping in the deepest sleep and if that child over there just begin and oh she comes awake I don't know it's a gift it's given to mothers to be that way they come wide awake and their attention goes right straight to that child and that's a part of a mother's love that God gave them the mothers tend to care to take care of the that child and they'll stay up all night without any sleep watching and staying right by that child oh my goodness yes sir I tell you that's something that shows the love of God it displays God's love that if a mother loves her child in that way that her eyes or ears are all tuned to that child all night I don't care how Darkly you may get or any age may get God's eyes are upon you his eyes are on the sparrow and he cares for you he cares for you and I and that's what I would like you to know here today God's love is greater far than any tongue or pen can ever tell and a mother's love just gives you a little idea to show you that he cares do do you care do you care your mother cared for you do you care oh let our love go forth now and express to them what God has done in their life and has done in our lives and we want to share that with them must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free no sir oh yes so you little mothers this morning you mothers that are real mothers I know there are many of you in here but let me tell you something don't you know that you are the Fifth Gospel Matthew Mark Luke John and then mother right he's saying don't you know you are the Fifth Gospel God used uses mothers to display his love the love that he expresses to us God uses them so that is why he always says you don't understand your purpose your purpose may not be to be a speaker to be this to be that he just wants you to be a mother he just wants you to raise up that child you don't know if there's a seed behind that Veil you don't know what life is behind that Veil but he asked you to raise it Faithfully loyally in his name praise God I'm glad that I have a loving wonderful mother amen that loved me and that prayed for me and that Stood Beside Me every step of the way amen praise God I was very young but at the time that thought I was bright at school and as soon as I got out of high school uh and took the first college exam they wanted to give me not wanted to give me I went to to teach in primary school and I started to teach but let me tell you when the call of God is upon you I could not stand it because all was coming to me while you're doing this you could have been speaking my word you could have been teaching the people about me and I couldn't stand it oh I I just lasted for a week or a week and a half and I was out of there I I absolutely and my poor mother that had prayed and prayed for me to get a good job and to advance in life all of a sudden you've got a good job and now you step out of it and they were so disappointed but you see see I have from that time I kept I've been keeping my eyes on the word of God and I believe not believe now but while she was still alive and she could witness and see the mighty hand of God and the Holy Spirit God blessed me enough to lead both mother and father to Jesus Christ and they can see the hand of God they were uh there to witness the Revival while I was was just 14 years old in the in the city that we were in and the church Still Remains there they were able to witness that I believe that she started to get her spiritual reward and more than that receiving this message of this hour both of them were able to receive the message of this hour and I want to thank God and praise him for that and I tell you she just went with the Lord quite ly she was not ill sick you know she had her sight uh she had her mind and still a woman of prayer and a blessing to the local Christian Assembly in New York what a blessing that she was yes sir so remember you mothers you are the Fifth Gospel said let me listen let let me show you something don't you know when Moses was a boy when he was a boy it was his mother who gave him his first instructions do you know in life that is automatic it's the mother that gives the first instructions like that it was mother who gave him his first instruction it was a Godly mother who took this child upon on her knees and said Moses and there she began to teach him the things of God she taught him all that he knew she was his teacher even though he was in the atmosphere that was around pharaoh and let me tell you Pharaoh is still here I mean the spirit of pharaoh is still here and you say oh in this Godless world of chaos all around what what am I going to do you can take your children you you don't have to wait for Sunday school on Sunday you can have uh Sunday school every day every night whenever you want to and take them and teach them about the Lord amen yes sir and she said Moses and she began to speak now these things Moses I see someday you're going going to deliver the children of Israel you are that boy that's going to do that so she began to teach him saying Moses teach him keep yourself pure keep yourself unspotted from the world you are the one amen no place do we have in the scriptures where he went to a seminary yet we know that any teaching that that he got he stayed was from his mother but he stayed right in Pharaoh's Palace yet being taught by his mother amen now we know he went to normal school because they said he was the wisest among those that were there at the particular time but it was his mother in the midst of Pharaoh's Palace in the midst of heathens you talk about heathens we have heathens today you say oh you got to you have to have a bone in your nose and you got to have feathers and you got to have for all over you and a batlax in your hand and then you're a heathen no you can be an educated Heathen a Godless Heathen that knows not the power of God the presence of God knows not the love of God and the Lord Jesus Christ and what he has done for us absolutely we are surrounded by by heathens around us don't you know that can you say Amen oh my don't be afraid and think that the population or the people will turn against you it's the truth it's the word of God amen hallelujah we're surrounded by heathens everywhere pagans like it was back then it's pagans today better dressed but still paganism because it's away from The Lord of word of God Amen she told him she Tau him the precepts of the Lord she told him how he must be holy told him how he what kind of a life he should live how and what God would do for him and you know what it stuck with Moses all the days of his life you know when children are young sometimes we think oh they don't know what we're talking about but something sticks in there you think they don't understand and some but something sticks in there that's why the Bible says teach them and even if they Wonder away doesn't matter it might take years but he you know he says that branch is going to bend and come right back it's going to come back to where it was because that's its origin that's its origin it comes from that origin Paul prays Timothy I see you come from your Godly grandmother Lewis a a and and now here you are today and and he's ordaining him as a preacher amen and to take over the local church that Paul was preaching in he says because I see God rais you up to be a bishop Hallelujah Bishop just really means Pastor preacher right but he raised him up to be that oh because of The Godly influence that come from his mother and from his Mo grandmother I believe that with all my heart God doesn't ask necessarily for that pre for that woman to be a preacher going around in the streets preaching or going anywhere preaching he just wants her to be Godly and holy and moral and pure and live according to his word and God promised that he'll bless you for fulfilling your purpose in life amen God promised that he would bless you for fulfilling your purpose in life glory to God hallelujah amen yes sir and it stuck with Moses all the days of his life any good true loyal mother will take her little babies and instead of sending them to picture shows instead of taking them out to little dances and so forth she'll put them on her knees and teach them about the Lord Jesus Christ Christ amen oh my yes sir the I he's speaking now he said I was speaking with uh a a lady the other day that called on the phone and she said oh brother brandham I want you to pray with me and pray for my son you see he's so wrong one says this about him the other says that about him uh you know they talk about him I don't even know whether he's right or wrong but whether he's right whether he's wrong I love him I am his mother and I love him there you are said God's servant listen listen to this oh see he said this is his mother and she says I love him and he said to her one day mom I've been so deceived I've been deceived I believe you're the only sweetheart in my life that really loves me and sometimes it comes right down to that the whole world turns against them is that right and that's how they feel that the whole world turns against them but no matter if the World Turns against them that's still their mother and the mother still loves them amen I don't care how they curse and swear and carry on and whatever else still God put it in the human heart that they Revere and love still that person that is their mother amen praise God now if you agree with me say an amen praise God hallelujah you can say oh me or oh my if you don't agree right but amen you see that's where it is that's a mother's love the real mother that will put her arms around her baby right right her baby and you know uh somewhere else he said you say I say baby he says but he talks about when he went to another place and there was a 180b man and the mother was still calling him her baby because you in their mind you remain their baby you you get to to be 30 40 you're still there baby amen and the mother still loves her baby can you say Amen Hallelujah yes they still love their baby you can't take it out of them they're built that way no matter what trouble that baby gets into they still love the baby they don't love their actions but they love the baby oh yes that's the way God has built them oh that mother will put her arms around that her baby whether he is right or wrong she goes right on loving him right through and if a mother can think that of her baby I want you to know this how much more do you think God thinks about his own you stay right with him stay right with the word and let me just tell you here that God is one that loves his own just as much as that mother does whether they done right whether they done wrong no matter how far they stray God's love projects and it goes out to reach them wherever they are God loves you Hallelujah that little song says God loves you and I love you and that's the way it should be God loves you and that Mother loves you and that's the way it should be oh absolutely my friends amen glory to God think about it now he says I want you to to know about another mother because there are other mothers and here was a woman called herodias how many knows that name okay she took her daughter and gave her got her lessons of how to tap dance H oh that's where it starts from lessons on how to tap dance and she was so good at it she became popular my oh now see popular because what is the mother thinking if she become the greatest tap dancer she'll make a lot of money become a star and and uh uh everything will be fine with the family like that oh she danced before the king and required the head of John the Baptist we have record of 70 of of this damsel offsprings see that danced before Herod 70 of her offsprings died as prostitute prostitutes in history and the others died on galles right one mother taught her child the things of this world the other mother taught her child the things of God one became a great leader a great conqueror and Immortal among men in the scriptures uh today and the other is De botched and and in hell and taken thousands of people with her right straight to Hell see what I mean bring up that child in the way that it should go Hallelujah see I certainly sympathize with you poor mothers sitting here today oh but if your mother is dead let me tell you there's a heaven where your mother has gone to oh yes if she's a good mother Godly mother there's a heaven that she has gone to where a good oldfashioned mother that live for God probably has passed Beyond the Veil and is waiting for you to come oh praise God forever more she's waiting for you and I to come I know my mom is waiting for me to come at this particular time blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah but right now respect her if she is still here you hear that respect her if she is still here honor her amen if she is still here oh yes honor her not only with red roses right but you know red roses symbolize love or as the young people will say true love they don't even know what true love is but they're talking about emotions and erotic and they're talking about human love they don't know anything about the love of God which is greater far than tongue or pen could ever tell they don't know about that amen oh my respect your mother if you want to do anything for her don't wait for Mother's Day do it 365 days a year is that right is that right praise the name of the Lord right do it like that oh my see that's what you have to do oh when you're CH go get your house keep your house well right keep it well no he's saying go to her house go to her house if you're not living with her spend some time there pray for her he said yes offer Prayer live for God in front of her that's the thing to do and you then bring up your children and when your children will come up they'll call you blessed see after you have passed Beyond the Veil that's the real Spirit of motherhood the real Spirit of Mother's me not this one they try to put on you oh selling flowers hours passing presents the world does all of that you see it passes it now we have Mother's Day but in another 20 years they're going to have uncle's days father's days son's days daughter days grandparent days Uncle days each day to make it into commercialism where they can just make money and commercialize everything but respect for your elders how many would raise their hand and say I agree to that right the co you see they draw you into the commercial world's glamour that's just where it's going and that glamour will take you right to hell as hard as you can go right to destruction it will take you oh my praise God Hallelujah now I want to tell you a story here that is very uh figurative and indicative of a real Mother's Love and brother Bram is telling one time he was in Tennessee passing through and he had to take a plane after his meetings were over to go home and while he was in the hotel room he wanted to go out on the street to post a letter at the post office so he left and uh went out but he said when I got to the crossing I suddenly heard his voice saying stop so he said I stop the voice says turn back turn back so he turned back just keep walking and he turned back and he started walking he said but I didn't know where I was going and what I was doing because the voice told me to go back and uh you see I started out this is The Sovereign Grace of God I was going down the street like any Christian would and I was just singing in my heart I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them Hallelujah one of them he said I was just singing in my heart and walking along as I was going along like that one of them little Pentecostal songs them people sing glad I can say I'm one of them people from everywhere filled with the Holy Ghost in that upper room and I was just rejoicing in my spirit in the Lord see and then as I started to cross again something said to me stop I thought what I said Lord what would you have me do and he says look just as plain not in my mind you know what I'm talking about I heard it and there it was that light was right before me whirling around see we we the Lord's is a light onto our feet and a lamp onto our path amen he is our guide he is our leadership he is our all in all he leads us and guides Us in reality oh when when are believers going to come into the perfect realization of the reality of the presence and the power of almighty God hallelujah oh praise God I'm holding myself not to go really preaching but to bring this word of you in this way amen because he is our guide and he literally guides us it it's not a joke it's not an imagination uh you know he may not always show you a light like he did to brother brandham but he has so many ways that he can tell you that he's leading and guiding you amen every day we leave our homes we don't know if we're going to go back safely every day we come out on the street but God's hand is guiding you you say oh my my god look this guy is in front of me he's stopping my car and you're getting mad with the guy and and then the next thing you know there is a roadblock the cops stop you lights flashing and you got to get to work oh the lights are flashing turn back go down that street you go down that street the next thing you know a horrific accident took place and if that guy was not uh whatever made him do that be deliberately driving slow in front of you you would have been right there just like the taxi driver where that said the um where the ship hit the bridge I think it's in Boston or something like Baltimore and yes she said I thank God and she wasn't Christian she just but I thank God for saving my life I went to pick up this client and the client I got there on time five minutes before time and I'm sitting there waiting and the client still not out the house and then when the client comes out the house it's past the time and because of that when I took off I was just approaching the bridge when the Collision of the ship hit the bridge and I was able to back up and get away from it all so she was thanking God for saving her in that hour let me tell you all things work together for good to them that love the Lord they are called according to his purpose praise God hallelujah oh my so I just kept on walking and walking there it was all I heard was walk and that's all I know was to do to obey and to keep walking amen yes sir oh Hallelujah and that's what we got to do right the devil says oh man give up there too much trials I I got to stop you know I just can't continue this way but let me tell you friends just keep walking am you don't have to see the end from the beginning he sees the end from the beginning all you've got to do is one step at a time follow him amen praise God forever more what is that old song we used to sing amen you got to keep on walking just keep right on on walking walking in the light of the Lord you'll get to he someday if you walk the right way walking in the light of the Lord then it says I sat down to rest for my feet had grown so weary that's what happens with a lot of people they've been in the message so long they followed the gospel so long try s come on every hand and they sit down to take a rest amen oh my but you got to keep on walking oh my and so I kept walking and found myself right down in the lower parts of that District humming the song only believe only believe you see in other words he was humming Christian songs within his heart all the time just like Paul said walk around but you singing in your heart Psalms and praises to God and little prayers here and there and whatever is in your heart at the time he says and I was humming that and there I looked hanging over a colored person's house right down there it was on a whitewashed gate I I got there and all typical Aunt Jima type with a man's shirt tied around her head Hallelujah she was leaning across the gate and oh probably far out I was just kindly humming as I seen her looking at me looking at me I just quit humming and started to pass by and or here she says wipe the tears out of her eyes and she said good morning Parson he said I spun around and now I said you you know up in Tennessee preachers are called Parsons and I don't know whether it is with colored folks here do that but that's the way it was I said how did you know that I was a person how did you know she says and I thought to myself isn't that strange and then something began to move oh my maybe this is what the Lord wanted to me to walk down here for how did you know I was a Parson she said why Parson when I see you coming I know you was a Parson did you ever read the story in the Bible about the shunamite woman how she didn't have couldn't have children and Elijah the prophet came and blessed her and she had a baby I said brother bradam yes ma'am she said well I is that kind of a woman I prayed to the Lord and told her Lord if he'd give me a child when I could have none I would raise it to love him and honor him I is a washer woman Parson she said I wash for a living and but you know when my baby grew up to be a man he's a big boy he got out with the wrong crowd person he took a horrible disease and I didn't know it he gone so far until the doctor says he can't live anymore he's in there in the house and he's been dying since yesterday and says he don't know where he's at he's just groaning and I just can't to see my baby die brother brandham says her baby 180 pound man still her baby I just can't see my baby die remember that was her baby and he she was still his mother no matter what amen that's right no matter what you are it's still your baby if you are a real mother can you say Amen can I say Al loud amen oh it's Mother's Day and we want to praise praise God for them amen and We Want To Praise them too for what they've done for us amen praise God I just couldn't see my baby die in that condition knowing that I promised the Lord to raise him to serve the Lord and so I prayed all night last night Lord what can I do now and the first thing you know I went to sleep and I dreamed the dream and in that dream I seen a man coming up the road see and I seen the man coming and he had a tan suit on wearing a tan hat on and having a briefcase see oh my and I said Lord and the Lord said to me here is my Parson coming to you Hallelujah she said oh that was about 3:00 in the morning morning when it woke me up like that and I came out of the house and I've been standing here since that time waiting on you Parson to pass by amen can you say an amen glory to God hallelujah oh yes so when I went there that poor old thing was still wet with the de on her back see from out where she'd been standing there all night since 3:00 in the morning amen so when I see you coming up the street you was the same man that I saw in my dream and I know you was that person so person won you come in amen she invited him into the house I pray that some of us would invite him into our house I said I pray that some of us would invite him into our house I'm not only talking about your house that you got at home pray you invite him in there but invite him into this house the house of your heart he's knocking he's knocking on the door and he's asking for entry won't you say Lord won't you come in won't you save me now want you keep me now want you preserve me now let him come in she opened up the gate a little chain was hanging on it I walked into the little this colored person's house they had no rug on the floor nothing there just a little old iron bed a little place to cook but I tell you if I ever walked in the presence of God when I entered those doors I did that time there was no pin up pictures on the wall there was a little picture hanging over the door and all it said was God bless our home I looked around and lying on that iron bed was a great big hosy fellow her baby her baby and he had the blanket in his hands going uh H H I said uh good morning young man she said passon he don't know nothing he hasn't know nothing for two days all he talks about is that he's out on a deep dark sea and it's all dark and he's lost and he don't know which way to go and she started crying she said oh if I could only hear him say that Mom I'm saved I'll be willing to give him up so I said well what have the doctors done she said they done all they could do but then they said it's all done eat out his heart and there's holes through his heart and there's nothing could be done for him oh praise God you know while I'm speaking like this if there's anybody out there like that or anybody in here like that the doctors give up tell you there's holes in your heart this can't this can't this can all With God all things are possible only believe for God's word is true Hallelujah they can't do nothing for him they say

George of England Gustaf I don't know which country that is whether it's Sweden or what Austria I've been in some of the best homes in this entire nation but I never was more welcome than I was in that little Shanty home that morning when she made welcome and began to pray hallelujah oh praise God I said Auntie would you lead in prayer and she yes Parson and up that she began to pray that will make the hair on your neck stand up to the back of it hear that poor all sainted godly woman her black cheeks and her tears running down pleading out to God oh God don't let let my baby die let him let me hear him say one time he saved Lord his mommy will then be satisfied glory to God hallelujah I said oh God bless her poor heart oh praise God she raised up and began to wipe her eyes I took my hand and I felt his cold sticky dying feet he kept going it's so dark and I and I laid my hands on that boy's head I said I'll pray now auntie I said Heavenly Father here it is after 9:00 in the morning my plane has done gone from the time I said and I don't know you told me to come down here and the only thing I know to do is to obey and to walk is if this is the place you've said sent me to I pray that you'll hear my prayer and will answer the prayer of this poor woman you know what the moment I said that he began to go oh oh Mommy Mommy Mommy it's getting bright in the room it's getting

Dred a plane in a storm and held it right there until his servants came oh praise God he'll do the same for you he'll do the same for you only believe for all things of are possible he said 6 months later I'm passing through Tennessee now from another place and I pulled in there and I felt hungry he said I just felt like going on the platform and buying a hamburger and I started to walk up the platform and I Heard a Voice a red cap which is a porter saying hello there Parson Bram I said good morning you he said you don't know me do you he said said no sir I I I don't believe I do he says you remember that morning you came down and and led by the Lord and prayed for a boy that lay there dying I said you're not him he said yes I am Hallelujah I ain't sick no more and more than that I a

that saved a Wretch like Me amen oh I once was lost but now I'm found oh praise God I tell you friends God's word is real isn't it praise the name of the Lord amen now we know back then brother bradam speaking you don't mind I taking my time I don't I don't I'm just using uh a you know a one-hot pistol today other days I may use a repeating rifle right but but here it is he says back then it was an honor for a woman to have a baby but today it's a disgrace nearly I'm not balling you people out you see but today it becomes like a dishonor almost it's like a dishonor for them to see a big family right now just think you come and tell them like a gentleman I met in Toronto uh you know I was taken back when he said he have was it 18 children 18 children him and his wife together right oh my and they're all alive and they're helping him with his business right oh my I think you know the man too yes right see but today it's a dishonor right he says my goodness and yet those same some of those women will pay uh a a100 back then now for you to buy a really nice dog you got to be paying a, 800 and something 2,000 3,000 to buy a nice little little sweet nice Chihuahua or or something like that that's just yipping and yapping and whatever they' rather to pay that for a snotting noosed dog and pack it in their hand with dignity and give it the love of a mother and practice birth control right that than to have children of their own see see that's what's going on and then they go hang around B rooms drink play cards laugh run around it's a disgrace the greatest honor a woman can do outside of giving her life to Christ see is to be a loyal wife to her husband and to have a baby amen oh my see what I'm telling you is you might be nursing a little preacher that God sent and you don't know it you may be nursing a girl that God sent for a purpose on this Earth You don't know it amen now see that's right the greatest honor you might be nursing that preacher I know that that's all fashion but it will do for you when you're dying oh my Lord look at the mental conditions in the world today how many knows that the prophet's words are coming to pass it shall come to pass long after I'm gone that the entire world be will begin to go insane is that right all right right going insane see look at it for it's a nervous age that them people are living in see oh it's driving them out of their mind and exactly fulfill what the scriptures said and promised hideous things will come upon the Earth things they coming on the earth Lord look at them in that mental condition deluded conditions and screaming for rocks and screaming for the mountains women who would rather give their mother's love to a dog you see that's what draws them to have a dog right like that and not to raise children to honor you see those that you did give children to and they did conceive them instead of loving them and raising them right they they loose them in the streets to do as they want and to live as they want no wonder you said Lord when you were going to the Cross then they'll cry to the rocks in the mountains to fall on them at that particular time oh my goodness think about it God is God I believe him don't you now this uh here is talking about this wonderful wonderful King George was driving along the street and you know back in the in the old um country that I'm from and lot of other countries that we know the king would come to visit that country from time of time the Commonwealth at that time and he just go around to visit and they'd have him in his beautiful car and out Riders and horse riders with it and and then he would be waving to the children that school would be out they would let you come from school and holding a British flag and waving the flag and shouting God Save the King and that sort of thing and they were waving it like that and there was this little girl after it was all over she was not in a number of kids and the teacher turned back went back and there she was leaning against the wall and she was crying she was crying like that and she says why are you crying she says didn't the king pass by he said yes did you see him yes did he wave towards you yes I did wave he says yes H I did I did he waved towards my Direction but what she expresses that the king is just a general wave he didn't see every individual what he was waving to and so the king could not see me because I was so little right I was so little so small brother Brandman speaking now and this is what I I want you to get but now I want you to know it's different with Jesus no matter how little how small a thing you do in his name he knows all about it it might seem insignificant to you but yet if it is done in his name no matter how little it is amen he knows all about it he once said if you give one one of these my little ones my servants just even a cup of cold water right only in the name of a disciple verily I say unto you you shall not lose your reward amen praise God hallelujah and so I'm glad of that aren't you he sees our the little things we do this little portion of scripture if you can understand and properly receive it he will understand and he will bless you amen praise God honor your father and your mother right the important role that they play in your life especially your mother the role that she plays in your life if you're a real mother stay at home take care of your children she will keep your clothes clean and she'll send you to school and today she'll meet you when the bus brings you back from school all right and there she'll be help you to cross the street oh my and she'll teach you about Jesus you will honor the you should honor that sweet old mother that with all that is in you respect that woman because she is a real mother and real mothers are becoming an endangered species is that right real mothers are becoming an endangered species they talk about oh save the whale and saved of this saved of that they don't look and see that mothers are out there that are Godly faithful helping to save the let's save the Civil the civilization save the children save the soul of the children and being a testimony to the world Amen praise God many of those prophets only prophesied one time and you never hear or read about them in the Bible again and sometimes people think that when there the simple things of God sometimes in this whole life which you think 60 70 50 80 is a lot of time that's not a lot of time and in that span of time God maybe only want you to do five acts of kindness for people out there and you don't even have to know them say oh only I'm going going Jesus said what is it if you do love those that already love you those that already believe like you those that already this what is that that's good but that's not it but it's to reach out to them that that even deceive you that lie against you persecute you say manner of love them show the love of God to them and let that love go out and bless the world because that's the love of God that will project out there and bless the world I'm going to close with this thought here this is another person brother Brandon was called to an emergency room and he rushed into the emergency room and there was a beautiful young woman with dark hair could have been a queen in any man's Palace or home and she and and said to me how do you do and I looked around the rest of them behind her in this room were in straight jackets have you ever been in a room like that and screaming some Screaming in there others cursing a woman another one dipping her hand into the bed pan that was there and wiping it all over her face excuse me for saying that brother bradam says after eating your breakfast coming here me saying that he said but I was in the midst of insanity it was Insanity all around that's you see I I I just don't know where to start Lord and I said it out loud I said I just don't know where to start with this and the young woman that was sitting there said I wish you would start with me I said you're not a patient she said yes sir I am he said well what's the matter she said brother brandham I was raised in a Christian Home listen to this young people everyone as a matter of fact I was raised to honor God and one time I went out with a boy my mother and father warned me not to go with such a boy but I said he was cute and and he had you know that pretty little curl that pretty hair oh my and of course that's that's right he said that's all right too I don't blame any woman looking uh your best whatever be clean look your best that's all right lady that's all right I just hate to see somebody though trying to look their best by disfiguring themselves them women don't even look like human when they're finished you know putting on you know I'm just in my parlament putting on such uh what you call this uh I eyelashes as long as an umbrella over your face oh Lord he says they don't even look human see but you try to look clean and to be a lady right and you men don't be sloppy about yourself oh my place come quiet dead I can drop a pin I can drop a pin like oh my Lord he says men don't you be sloppy with yourself how many of you seen brother Brandon pictures of brother Brandon when he's not hunting or when he's going to preacher when he's out normally he always was dressed sharp you how many knows that you seen pictures of him so always dress clean sharp right Oh my he says don't don't dress Slappy like that and then think that that's being humble I used to think that and do you believe that I I I used to think riding a bicycle and just having a crushed up suit or whatever and not too clean because you're going to start looking too fancy and people not going to believe you and and I was Dr preaching like that and going around like that and when the first the church started and we were down there in the little white building that spirit of God spoke and said no the people are seeing you they're seeing the outside of the church and just like I want you now to paint this church white was gray and very terrible looking do it up so not only do up the church you start dressing better carry yourself with dignity so that the people can respect that he said first the reason why that's the first thing they see right and if their carnal senses can only see and he let them see the best you can be and then you can lead them for right into the things of God but don't go around sloppy looking no and think that that's being humble that's not humble he says that's being dirty that's not me now I say that brother brah said that he says be clean now and try to do that you know it's just you know it it's just don't try to do things uh like other people just be a ordinary brother just be yourself I hate to see anybody try to put on something now this young lady I said what happened and she began to tell me her story right well this boy he first of all he smoked he tried to get me to smoke and I wouldn't do it one night he just gave me a piece of candle while we were sitting there talking that candy had been documented brother brandham said what he meant it was laced with drugs right he says you doctors know how to say that you know what that means I just said it that way right but that candy just a piece of candy not a cigarette not a drink because now he knows that devil on him knows that she ain't going to take that so he bring a simple simple thing just a piece of candy and the candy was laced with drugs she said and so he got me on the wrong road I ate the candy thinking it was all right I woke up the next morning and my morals as a young woman was ruined then I thought what's the difference now so I started drinking and going around and then I joined this church I did everything I went to the good Shepherd's home I went to the Catholic church I joined the Catholic Church thought that would help me didn't do a thing I I became a street walker I became a prostitute I I began to drink alcohol then when I quit that they pick me up again and I served two years in a women's Penitentiary when I come out of there I joined another church thinking it would help me didn't do me one bit of good and then I heard about your meetings oh my yes sir and I thought I'd come down and see if you could help me I looked at her a beautiful woman I thought what she could be the queen of some child evangelist when he comes home she could say darling I know your child tired put her arms around him encourage him you don't know what that does to a man we do when times are going there's no one can take the touch of a real sweet mother think of it God could give a man some couldn't give a man something better you see because here he had done it by giving him a wife what a sweet little thing she would be I was thinking like that amen oh my I I turned to her I said I want to ask you something didn't you ever in your life ever feel like you'd like to have a h a husband and have little babies around you see and be a mother she said sure brother brandham but what would that would be the desire of my heart but who would have me now who would have me now I I couldn't even say speak I feel embarrassed to even speak before a minister I I I I wouldn't be able to express the low down dirty things that I have done and yet there she was a young woman of only 20 I said well we can B our heads now and pray there one thing we can do you can pray she said said yes sir I got down I want to pray you ask God to forgive you of these things I want you to pray and she began to pray I've done so many things it won't work he says you try praying again she got down and she prayed she got back up he says now brother brandham with that prayer I think I'm going to turn a new page here tonight he says no you'll turn it back that page back tomorrow I said that W work turning a new page I want to ask you something you don't want to do these things do you honey she said no I don't and I said this may seem oldfashioned as it would be you join every Church all you done all that he said I want you to know why that has been and why you've come this far this way you were under bondage of a devil causing that in your life causing that to happen those big bright eyes looked up to me and she said Mr brandham I've always believed that something was driving me to do them things I didn't want to do he said that's it it's demon power demon power oh my I said now let's pray again she got down and prayed and prayed I laid hands on her and she she stayed right there and we prayed a little while longer and all that once the fire struck amen yes sir and when it struck she raised up and them eyes had changed how they looked she said brother Bram something happened something happened he said I know it's over now Hallelujah you don't have to join nothing now you don't have to do nothing only believe she's married now she's got children no more drinking and that quote comes out of this message called from that time from that time she walked another road and another life well what I've talked about today is a mother's love the love of her of a mother for her own and in closing I want you to know that he showed that there was a good mother and how she raised the child how she taught the child how she brought down the scriptures the word of God to the child maybe tell them Stories the scriptures in story form how many knows that that's the best way to start teaching children in story form and uh related that way and brought Moses up to the point where he became a great leader and deliverer and an immortal engraved within the scriptures and then the other mother herodias who raised her daughter to be a dancing queen and a model and all that sort of thing and to be the best so that she could make money off of her uh live off of her and there are many stars you know that like that out there and uh and and what came that child became What whose Generations had prostitutes and murderers in them because that's the seed they come from and that's how it went out and then brother brandham tells us about this colored woman and then about this woman um whom in one meeting even wasn't ashamed no more she even got up in one of his big meetings and testified amen it's in the books you know her name is there rosett Ro sister Rosetta and testified about it because she saved God wiped her clean you can talk all you want it's gone it's behind me I don't care that that's that's just a past life amen don't let the devil BG you down with your past amen we're living in the present we're living in the great I am right now we're walking with him praise the Lord glory to God father I thank God for the love of a mother because and I close with this with this thought and it's just me talking about uh my mother a Praying Mother and I remember that in the midst of brother Bram talking of this woman praying for her son and the here standing on the back of your head I I can remember as a child waking up in the night why my mother was praying in the middle of the night and the whole house was taken up with the presence of God not so much the noise of our prayer but the presence that was coming forth from our prayer you couldn't sleep just called to sleep you just had to listen and hear uh like that and that's why like the good songwriter he said oh if I could hear my mother pray again if I could only hear her gentle voice praying again weeping for her sons weeping for her daughters may God help

sister Marca and her all the young people uh Sunday school come up they're going to do a little couple presentations is that okay big day everybody say big day it's a big day but this may be a good time I got a couple of announcements um so listen up okay as they're coming this a distraction but listen to these announcements okay number one uh we do have our retirement dinner for pastor Simon coming up very shortly so you do here here you heard the announcement last week uh or the week before one or the other and uh we are looking for testimonies for the dinner all right so if you have a testimony you want to give during the dinner you got to let us know and uh it's don't wait till the last second also um you know that the dinner part is uh uh going to be held at the uh Burlington Convention Center correct so um now we're not charging for that we're not we're just going to do it but we are accepting any donations anything towards that all right so um in that way please remember that uh speaking of which now listen to this one uh how many people love technology in here oh y all love technology you're right okay but let me tell you something I don't have my phone with me but I could lift my phone that's the one of the part of the tree of good an evil and this and today it's un evil side because uh I was up to late last night trying to figure it out but um so we do you know we have e transfers right and uh some of you give uh your ties and your offerings through R transfers others bring it in uh the other way which is fine either way is fine but um technology has stepped in and has uh blocked all the e transfers that you've sent all this week so if you sent an e transfer on Monday up until uh even right now couldn't get it all right it's not lost it just got blocked all right and we just can't figure out who's blocking it what's going on I I'm dealing with uh Mark s in and and we spent hours yesterday we can see them but we just can't get them so if you've sent an e transfer from last Monday up until now what I would suggest um is go into it and cancel it there's no there's no uh uh security issue it's just that I won't be able to get it all right so cancel it and wait till we get it fixed which should be within a day or so and then we'll send out saying hey we're back up and operating all right and and then you can send it in like that is that clear got it it's a good old technology boy oh boy you know it was after 11 o'clock last night and we're texting back and forth three hours and I'm going oh my goodness Lord what's going on here but anyway that's the way it is it goes sometimes and the last one is that uh next weekend there is the Quebec Youth Camp all right so all those who are going to the Quebec Youth Camp uh can you please meet with us downstairs in the uh the room down there with the big table and we want to have a little meeting about that all right so we're looking forward to that so we have this presentation once again so let the beauty of Jesus be seen in me amen all his wonderful passion and pure oh thou Spirit Divine oh thou Spirit divine all my nature refined till the beauty of Jesus be seen in me [Music] on behalf of good neighbor ministri Sunday school we are grateful for this opportunity to say a very happy Mother's Day to to all mothers today we would like to share a few scriptures and quotes from God's 20th century Prophet brother William brandham our first quote reads I thank mother the good true mother is the Fifth Gospel Matthew Mark Luke John mother mother gets them first that's the one who brings them up first is mother our theme today is Mother The Fifth Gospel we choose to honor our mothers and thank the Lord Jesus for using them for using each of them to teach us about him his word and being an example of God in flesh she is TR truly The Fifth Gospel bless all these these dear mothers sitting here Lord master of Life bless them Lord and may they be blessed blessed too and may their children's memory be as theirs is with their mother if she's gone beyond the veil to a glorious Haven Grant it Lord now there's nothing any sweeter on Earth that we know of than a real genuine mother God bless her Gallant Soul a real real mother God grant this morning that mothers women who are wandered away from God that they will come to themselves this morning and will recognize what the word mother means one who ha begotten may she realize that The Offspring from her Union with her husband has been sacred Little Gems that God hath placed under her care then God will hold her responsible for the rearing of those children and as the scripture says that the good woman and the mother what she is that her children will call her blessed mothers I respect and honor you and if you want to do anything for your mother do it 365 days a year go to our house and offer her a prayer and live forget that's the thing to do and bring up bring up your children and when your children comes up they call you blessed after you have passed beyond the Val that's the spir spirit of motherhood the real Spirit of Mother's Day Mother's Day is 365 day days a year mother would appreciate a whole lot more it's just to sit down and talk to her a little bit write her a line Pat her on the shoulder kiss her on the cheek tell her you love her it'll go a lot farther than the flowers you could buy from the floor that's true mother is first with the child and she is a great responsibility of what the child will be it will be based upon the way that mother starts that child on the path that it must travel mother has the responsibility from God to place that child on the right Road and that's why I think mothers have a special little touch you see when a child listens to its mother some touch a little bit about that mother that a child will listen to it when it's hurt it will go to the mother for consolation before we go to the father because she was first with it you know and there's some gift that God gives a mother to be that way I mean a real mother now I believe that mothers are honorable and golly I think that a mother a mother should be respected every day the same that's right a real mother a real mother is a woman that raised you and you love her and you see her and talk to her all the time mother is so great you know the first one that receives you in this life is your mother no one can touch you because you're conceived and she Bears you under her heart and she is the first to know you and in this life the first to hold you then when you're born she is one of the first hands that touch you and wipes backs back the tears out of your eyes she is the first one to Pat you and to love you and to coup over you in this life is your mother now I think that there is not enough honor that we could give to a mother proverbs 31 verse 10 to 31 who can find a virtuous wife for her worth is far above rubies the heart of her husband safely trust her so he will have no lack of gain she does him good and not evil all the days of her life she seeks wool and flax and willingly works with her hands she is like the the merchant ships she brings her food from afar she Also Rises when it is yet night and provides for her household and is a portion and a portion for her mer servants she considers a field and buys it from her profits she plants a Vineyard she GDs herself with strength and strengthens her arms she perceives that the her merchandise is good and her lamp does not go out by night she stretches out her hands to the distaff and her hand holds the spindle she extends her hands to the poor yes she reaches her out her hands to the needy she is not afraid of snow for her household for all her household is cold is clothed with Scarlet she makes tapestry for herself her clothing is fine linen and purple her husband is known in the gates when he sits among the Elders of the land she makes she makes linen garments and sells them and supplies sashes for merchants strength and honor her are strength and honor are her clothing she shall rejoice in the time to come she opens her mouth with wisdom and on her tongue is the law of kindness she watches over the ways of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness her children rise up and call her blessed her husband also and he Praises her many daughters have done well but you Excel them all charm is deceitful and beauty is passing but a woman who fears the Lord she shall be praised give her the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise her in the gates [Music] for my mom [Music]
