[4:20] hallelujah living voices
[4:26] last sunday as we spoke
[4:30] we were concluding our talk
[4:35] and in this
[4:38] we spoke of the rapture mystery
[4:43] and how the rapture mystery was
[4:47] uh revealed and unfolded by the ministry
[4:51] of this
[4:51] great prophet messenger
[4:55] of malachi 4 5 a messenger
[4:59] or the messenger sent to the seven
[5:01] church ages
[5:03] and here he made it clear
[5:09] that there are three levels or steps
[5:13] in jesus descent
[5:16] for the rapture now we are speaking
[5:21] on on this living voices
[5:25] living in the season and time
[5:29] of the rapture coming
[5:32] of jesus christ this
[5:35] time when he comes
[5:39] is coming for his bride
[5:42] hallelujah right now
[5:45] he is appearing and his
[5:48] appearing is creating moves of god
[5:52] miracles signs and wonders the unfolding
[5:56] of the word
[5:57] the revealing of the word the
[6:00] manifestation of the word
[6:02] changing of hearts changing of lives
[6:05] it's a preparation
[6:06] time when the bride is
[6:09] making herself ready for the
[6:13] for the lord's return to earth again
[6:17] to pick her up and
[6:20] raise her up praise god for paul said
[6:23] we will be caught up to meet him
[6:26] caught up in the presence of the living
[6:29] god
[6:30] and now we see jesus
[6:33] descending from heaven with the shout
[6:38] the voice and the trumpet
[6:42] certainly when we
[6:45] read revelation 10 1
[6:49] we read of that mighty angel coming
[6:52] down from heaven and planting
[6:55] one foot on the land and one upon the
[6:59] sea
[7:01] and the bible says in his
[7:04] hand he had a book and in that
[7:08] book hallelujah the book was open
[7:12] i want you to know it's the same book
[7:16] that was there when the voices
[7:19] voice went out if there's anyone that
[7:22] in heaven and earth that can break the
[7:25] seals
[7:26] that were upon that book the seventh
[7:29] seal
[7:30] book which held the names
[7:34] of all god's elected seed
[7:38] were in that book
[7:41] and john himself
[7:44] knew that his name would be in that book
[7:49] and if the book could not be opened
[7:53] and the names could not be read out
[7:57] then all was lost
[8:00] the whole gods people his children
[8:04] all would be lost but then suddenly
[8:09] they heard the voice then they looked
[8:12] and when they looked they saw a
[8:15] bloody bleeding lamb hallelujah
[8:18] come forth and he took the book
[8:23] from the hand of him that sat upon the
[8:26] throne
[8:27] in other words god changed his
[8:30] he changed his ministry right there
[8:34] he changed his office
[8:37] right there praise god here was the
[8:40] great
[8:41] lion become a lamb and that lamb
[8:45] dying bleeding hallelujah
[8:49] the bleeding bloody word
[8:52] coming down so the book which was closed
[8:56] was taken into the hand of the lamb
[9:00] praise god but now and he took the soup
[9:04] seals
[9:05] from off of that book and now the book
[9:08] was
[9:08] open now in this scene we are
[9:12] seeing him again but now he
[9:15] is in the form of the
[9:19] covenant angel of revelation
[9:22] 10 1 for as you know
[9:26] in the old testament god sent
[9:29] the great covenant angel that covenant
[9:33] angel is different from all the other
[9:37] angels
[9:38] for this one he comes the bible says
[9:42] with a rainbow around his head
[9:46] hallelujah and in his hand he al
[9:50] he has the book now open
[9:53] the book is now open the seals
[9:57] were opened and they were in the hand
[10:01] of this angel with the rainbow
[10:05] about his head the rainbow covenant
[10:08] angel
[10:10] angel of the covenant who is
[10:13] no uh who is well known
[10:16] to be the lord jesus christ himself
[10:20] descending in the form
[10:23] of an angel and the bible says
[10:28] and he placed one foot on the land
[10:31] one upon the sea raised his hands with
[10:35] the book open towards heaven
[10:37] and he shouted with a loud voice
[10:41] and when he shouted with a loud voice
[10:44] when he uttered his voice
[10:46] the bible says seven thunders
[10:49] went forth when he uttered his voice as
[10:52] i made known to you
[10:54] seven is the number of perfection
[11:00] his voice being the word
[11:03] which was now to be revealed
[11:06] or release or uttered amen which he
[11:10] would utter his voice
[11:12] and his voice would become the shout
[11:16] in and through the ministry and
[11:19] message of brother william marian
[11:22] branham of
[11:23] malachi 4 5 of the fulfillment
[11:28] of malachi 4 5
[11:31] and that voice that mighty thundering
[11:35] voice
[11:36] would now in and through
[11:40] the prophet of malachi 4 5
[11:43] revelation 10 7
[11:46] would become or has become
[11:50] the shout the shout
[11:53] the voice the shout the trumpet
[11:57] oh blessed be the name of the lord god
[11:59] hallelujah
[12:01] the shout of course is the message
[12:05] amen the message behold
[12:08] the bridegroom comment going out to meet
[12:12] him
[12:12] trim your lamps amen may your lamps be
[12:15] trimmed and burning
[12:17] oh brother sister if your lamp is not
[12:21] trimmed and burning then you are in
[12:24] trouble
[12:24] and you need to come to god and say
[12:28] lord jesus help me lord
[12:31] let me trim my lamps lord jesus
[12:34] i remember in the old days
[12:38] maybe even now in some some countries
[12:42] people would take a rag
[12:45] and place it in a
[12:48] bottle or can of kerosene
[12:51] and that rag would be sticking out at
[12:53] the top
[12:54] and they would light that rag and it
[12:57] would
[12:58] give them light and then it would burn
[13:01] and burn and it would become so black
[13:03] after a while that unless you trim it
[13:07] and pull it
[13:07] up you won't get any more light and your
[13:11] lamp will go out so this is what the
[13:14] bible is saying
[13:16] we ought to rise up and trim our laps
[13:20] get out of that smokey smoky
[13:24] lip slap shade come out of the situation
[13:29] where your life is so smoky it has no
[13:32] purpose it has no direction
[13:36] it doesn't have a clarity to it
[13:39] and the holy spirit is saying
[13:42] dip yourselves in the blood of christ
[13:45] which will
[13:45] wash away the snow it will turn your
[13:49] life around
[13:50] change your lifestyle change you from
[13:53] the
[13:53] inside to the outside it's not the
[13:56] putting on of religious clothes
[14:00] it's not the putting on of religious
[14:02] actions
[14:04] it's not the putting on of religious
[14:07] talk
[14:08] but it's a change of life when
[14:11] your life is exchanged
[14:15] and christ comes into you and he
[14:18] lives in you then it is not i
[14:21] that live paul said but christ that
[14:25] liveth within me
[14:26] hallelujah and when christ lives within
[14:29] you
[14:29] your life is changed and changing

[14:50] jesus christ within my heart
[14:53] my life did not just change completely
[14:56] like that even now i have not come to
[14:59] perfection in every action but every day

[39:23] where there is no it's going to be built
[39:25] not using saw
[39:27] or plain or any kind of measuring things
[39:30] that
[39:30] man has but built by the hand of god
[39:34] alone
[39:34] glory to god hallelujah and is built in
[39:37] the house now
[39:38] and the house is not made of bricks
[39:42] but we are the stones

[40:27] the reason why the people are angry or
[40:29] why the devil is getting the people
[40:31] angry
[40:32] is because the devil is seeing christ's
[40:34] in you
[40:35] and he's angry not at you but in christ
[40:38] because
[40:38] jesus said if they persecute me your

[41:28] amen you see listen friends
[41:31] let me say this again people don't
[41:35] realize what they're doing
[41:38] this move of god is not a church
[41:42] it's a move of god and it's god himself
[41:47] moving in and among and upon his people
[41:53] oh my listen so
[41:56] when the people are coming against
[41:59] you wherever you are for believing
[42:03] this message and they're talking against
[42:07] the prophet against the message
[42:10] against the church against the uh the
[42:13] pastors against the
[42:14] the believers they are speaking against
[42:19] the christ or god that is in you but
[42:22] they
[42:23] don't know it because they're still
[42:25] seeing you
[42:26] who are just the outer veil now you are
[42:29] the outer
[42:30] veil but the one living in
[42:33] you is the lord jesus christ himself
[42:37] so when they do that they're actually
[42:40] coming against him
[42:41] and then oh how we should pity them and
[42:44] feel
[42:45] sorry for them for they don't know and i
[42:48] believe that's what jesus was trying to
[42:50] say on calvary
[42:52] oh father forgive them for they don't
[42:55] they know not what they do they don't
[42:58] recognize who's living back of this veil
[43:01] and they're they're piercing it they
[43:03] they're criticizing it they're
[43:05] they're they're pushing a spear in it
[43:07] they don't recognize
[43:09] that the same god that they claim to
[43:12] serve
[43:12] that they are piercing him they are
[43:15] sparing him
[43:16] they're they're giving him vinegar
[43:18] calling him all mandarin names
[43:20] and every word that is spoken against
[43:24] him
[43:24] he said after i leave
[43:27] whatever you do it may be forgiven
[43:31] but that comforter coming after me which
[43:34] is the holy spirit
[43:37] when he gets in the people and he begins
[43:40] to move
[43:42] and the spirit of the living god begins
[43:44] to
[43:45] work through them and you begin to come
[43:48] against that
[43:49] and you speak against him he said that
[43:53] will not be forgiven you for it will be
[43:56] what
[43:56] blasphemy oh my lord
[43:59] help us in this day and in this hour
[44:03] in which we live praise god
[44:06] praise god when you live that kind of a
[44:08] life
[44:09] recognizing it's not by my works of
[44:12] myself
[44:14] or doing anything it's not my praying
[44:17] for anybody or praying against
[44:19] anybody amen oh praise
[44:22] god but just let the lord work through
[44:26] you
[44:27] and when the lord begins to work through
[44:29] you oh
[44:30] that is the thunder that shakes the
[44:33] devil
[44:33] the devil can't stand that oh my
[44:36] my friends i've told this story to my
[44:40] own church
[44:42] i remember when i was in old pentecost
[44:46] there was a wonderful saint of god
[44:49] but back then with no understanding of
[44:51] how god works
[44:53] she came to church one sunday morning
[44:57] and she loves to testify and we all
[45:00] should love to
[45:01] stand up and testify and not just be
[45:04] reticent sit in our seats with our mouth
[45:06] like we have locked jaw
[45:08] no sir but we ought to be able to raise
[45:11] up and praise god
[45:13] and be able to testify about his
[45:16] goodness and of his love
[45:18] however she came and she was testifying
[45:22] she said bretwin when i woke up this
[45:26] morning
[45:27] and i went to my foul coop
[45:30] or we say pen foul pen
[45:34] and i looked inside my rooster
[45:39] oh my foul was gone
[45:43] oh my she said when i saw
[45:46] that and i already had my church clothes
[45:50] on
[45:50] ready to come to church and when i saw
[45:54] my rooster was gone
[45:56] i went into the middle of that yard and
[45:58] i lift up my voice
[46:01] and i said listen i am going
[46:04] to my church and i'm going to put down
[46:07] these two
[46:08] knees to before god and i'm going to ask
[46:12] god to bring some kind of a
[46:16] curse on whoever stole my
[46:19] foul cup my rooster somebody
[46:22] belly is going to swell here today
[46:25] somebody's belly
[46:27] gonna swell oh my she said and i
[46:30] prayed like that i told them that i'm
[46:33] coming here
[46:34] and i said by the time i get back to my
[46:36] house
[46:37] that rooster had better be in that pen
[46:40] or somebody as belly or somebody's
[46:44] stomach
[46:45] is going to swell oh my
[46:48] oh so the next sunday
[46:51] she came back she came to church
[46:56] and she said brethren i am telling you
[46:59] we serve a true and a living god
[47:02] you see when i got back there
[47:05] my fall my rooster was
[47:09] locked up in that pen safe and sound
[47:12] and god gave back my brewster and i give
[47:16] him praise
[47:17] honor and glory and si our sister
[47:20] had a good run around the church
[47:22] praising god
[47:24] for what he had done now that was
[47:26] wonderful back then
[47:28] but let me tell you that's not what
[47:30] we're talking about here
[47:32] now we understand that if god allowed
[47:36] that person to take that
[47:38] rooster or that chicken he knows what
[47:41] he's doing
[47:42] if it's a real safe he still knows what
[47:45] he's doing
[47:46] if it's somebody that's hungry he still
[47:48] knows what he is doing
[47:50] just relax rest yourself in his case
[47:53] and say lord you take that away you must
[47:56] be going to give me something better
[47:58] maybe you're going to give me something
[48:00] more you see when you
[48:02] get under the spirit of revelation you
[48:04] don't work up
[48:05] and worry and wonder you trust the lord
[48:08] in all things
[48:10] and you don't go and pray any prayer
[48:13] like that
[48:14] upon people for we are servants of the
[48:17] living god
[48:18] so let me say it in that colloquial way
[48:21] and let me say it in this way let us
[48:24] become living voices
[48:26] to a living man living women living
[48:29] young
[48:30] women living young men living
[48:34] children our life becomes
[48:37] the voice of god to the age in which
[48:40] we are living in oh glory to god
[48:43] hallelujah

[48:57] lightning flash
[48:59] when that sun i don't care who it is
[49:01] when that lightning suddenly cracks and
[49:04] it shines out for the glory of god
[49:06] somebody's
[49:07] begins to shake somebody's scared
[49:10] nervous oh my because it's
[49:13] god speaking oh my of course the
[49:17] scientists
[49:18] say the voice is the winds clashing the
[49:20] clash
[49:21] that's the scientific explanation winds
[49:25] clashing together and they create that
[49:27] cracking
[49:28] sound symbolic of the voice of god
[49:33] amen speaking to his children
[49:36] amen god on the mountain god speaking
[49:40] and thunder and lightning amen praise
[49:43] god forevermore
[49:44] amen praise god brother sister
[49:48] that's the way it is when we put our
[49:50] faith in him and trust him
[49:53] god send us out in life and in love
[49:57] amen speaking to us in every possible
[50:01] way
[50:01] for his glory the voice
[50:06] the voice of the resurrection
[50:10] but that voice of the
[50:13] resurrection with that voice
[50:17] comes within his people brother branham
[50:21] says here
[50:22] not just their voice anymore not just a
[50:25] voice
[50:26] but voices amen hallelujah
[50:30] for god has now multiplied himself
[50:33] god has now reproduced himself
[50:37] and now that voice has now become
[50:41] voices around the world thousands
[50:44] millions of voices that are speaking out
[50:48] and testifying
[50:49] of this message as paul said
[50:52] regardless of their understanding of it
[50:58] their pre some are preaching it may have
[51:01] a great understanding some are mixed up
[51:04] some are tangled up
[51:06] in every way but paul said regardless
[51:09] nevertheless christ is preached
[51:13] amen somebody listen this message is a
[51:16] miracle message it's a mysterious
[51:18] miraculous
[51:19] powerful message not because i am saying
[51:23] it
[51:23] or not because i am speaking in such an
[51:26] animated
[51:27] form amen but just to let you know
[51:30] this is a message of power and the last
[51:33] day
[51:34] glory of god bought former and latter
[51:37] reign
[51:38] falling in these monks the power of god
[51:40] and the spirit of the living god
[51:43] amen over in africa one man
[51:47] amen went one preacher
[51:50] went to preach the gospel and when he
[51:53] went to preach the gospel
[51:55] the people in that part of the jungle
[51:58] were against anybody coming in to preach
[52:02] that
[52:03] the word the gospel they don't know any
[52:05] different they just know their
[52:06] animist beliefs and so they
[52:10] came after him with bow and spare and he
[52:13] started running for his life and he came
[52:17] to a river
[52:18] and he got to get over and there in the
[52:21] river
[52:22] crocodiles on every side oh
[52:25] my my my and he didn't know what to do
[52:29] and he heard the voices of the people
[52:31] coming with their spears
[52:32] and he kneeled down to pray he said
[52:35] lord i'm in this in this place here
[52:39] and they're going if they kill me nobody
[52:42] will even know i'm gone
[52:44] oh and that will be it i'll be finished
[52:46] lord please help me
[52:48] and while he was praying he heard the
[52:51] voices
[52:52] further and further and further away
[52:57] so he opened his eyes to see what
[52:59] happened when he opened his eyes
[53:01] he was on the other side of the river
[53:04] and he don't know how he got there
[53:06] oh my no wonder the old negro spiritual
[53:10] says
[53:11] how i got over my soul looked
[53:14] back and wonder how i got over i don't
[53:17] even know how i got over
[53:19] but god took him over just like he took
[53:22] philip
[53:24] from samaria right into the desert
[53:27] and he doesn't know he doesn't feel
[53:29] anything yet he
[53:30] god did it by his power and by his glory
[53:34] i remember another precious brother
[53:39] that was converted minister
[53:43] converted under uh this ministry that
[53:46] god has given me
[53:49] he heard the word
[53:53] but when he heard it right then he
[53:55] didn't believe it
[53:57] but one day he went out being a member
[54:01] of pentecostal denomination to preach
[54:04] and on his way back the rain began to
[54:07] thunder and lightning and rain begins to
[54:10] fall torrential rains
[54:13] he decided to go under a house
[54:18] in those days houses were built like on
[54:21] stilts
[54:23] and you could go out to the bottom of
[54:25] that house
[54:26] in those old days so he went there to
[54:30] shelter from the rain
[54:32] there was a workbench and so he decided
[54:36] as the rain kept falling and falling
[54:38] longer and longer and he was going to
[54:41] lay there
[54:43] so he laid on the bench unless he's laid
[54:46] there
[54:47] look on the ceiling he noticed that
[54:50] there were creases in the floor
[54:52] and so somebody took paper
[54:55] and pasted it up to block
[54:58] your vision from seeing into
[55:01] the house or into the flow or through
[55:04] the floor
[55:06] and when he looked up he began to read
[55:10] so he he raised up he stood up and he
[55:13] started reading
[55:15] and he started reading and he started
[55:17] reading
[55:18] and the next thing you know brother
[55:20] sister he came and sought for me
[55:23] and told me brother simon i got to be
[55:26] baptized oh praise god i baptized him
[55:31] he got out of that denomination so fast
[55:34] and begin to preach the word and god
[55:37] used him
[55:38] and raised up a couple of churches and
[55:41] he kept preaching
[55:42] the glory of god you say brother samuel
[55:46] what was it that he read you know what
[55:48] happened
[55:49] somebody that was given
[55:52] one of the spoken word books voice of
[55:55] god
[55:57] that took the book in there and tore it
[56:01] and used the pages to paste it
[56:04] under the house just a block out
[56:08] amen the creases the holes in the floor
[56:13] but god allowed that because god already
[56:17] knew a man
[56:18] that he wanted a seed of god a son a
[56:22] daughter of god a son of god was coming
[56:24] and he lay there and on his back
[56:28] and sometimes god gotta put a lot of us
[56:30] on our back through sickness through
[56:32] knocking off of a
[56:33] high horse of pride and accomplishment
[56:36] knock you off whatever horse you were
[56:39] riding on
[56:40] so you can come to your senses and
[56:42] recognize the voice of the
[56:44] true voice of the living god but there
[56:46] it was
[56:47] the voice of god the pages of the book
[56:51] was pasted and he read them and he
[56:54] became converted with nobody else there
[56:56] but he himself i know of another
[56:59] situation
[57:01] where i had taken
[57:04] my church and we had distributed tracks
[57:08] and books
[57:10] in another town from where
[57:14] i was ministering in and you know
[57:18] a brother went to his job
[57:22] and on the job he had a very good friend
[57:24] who was a
[57:25] muslim a muslim man and they were very
[57:29] friendly and so the muslim man invited
[57:32] him to come to his home
[57:35] and so he decided i'm gonna i'm gonna go
[57:37] with him this afternoon and so he went
[57:40] to that man's home
[57:43] and when he got to that man's home he
[57:46] started
[57:47] trying to witness a little bit to him
[57:51] the message or the word of god
[57:54] and then he said and then he spoke when
[57:57] he spoke the word
[57:58] that that muslim man turned to him and
[58:00] said
[58:02] uh me i won't believe any
[58:06] body else except the prophet
[58:10] william branham so the brother was
[58:12] stunned
[58:13] he said the prophet william branham
[58:16] what do you know about william branham
[58:20] he said well what one day
[58:25] i went out to throw out my garbage
[58:29] and when i look in the garbage can
[58:32] i saw a book in there
[58:36] and i took that book a sermon preached
[58:40] by
[58:40] william branham and when i read it
[58:45] the oh it changed my life completely
[58:50] when i come out from being a muslim
[58:54] i change my way of life
[58:57] and commit my life to christ so the
[59:00] brother
[59:01] just got up in the man's home and hug
[59:03] them
[59:04] and begin to shout hallelujah praise god
[59:07] give give god the glory and the two of
[59:10] them he said

[59:23] book he said well
[59:25] well i i took the book
[59:28] and my brother-in-law who lives
[59:31] many miles up the river in the jungle
[59:35] and i gave him the book and he

[59:45] man was
[59:46] and we went into the jungle
[59:49] to that house where that brother what
