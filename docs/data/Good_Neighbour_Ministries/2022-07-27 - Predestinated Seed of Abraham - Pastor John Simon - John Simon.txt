8 genesis 17 verses 7 and 8 praise the lord and it reads us and i will establish my covenant between me and thee god speaking to abraham and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant for as long as time lasts right doesn't have to have a covenant when you're in heaven so this is what he's saying here praise god and i to be got to be a god unto them and to thy seed after thee and i will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and i will be their god amen praise the name of the lord god bless us as we look into his word we realize that uh sometimes the music it moves very slow in an orchestra not a movement it's up another way that it depends on the great sim composer of the symphony and he directs the music and we just fall in step with the music and we give god praise and thanks for him for his word that he is giving to us here tonight may the lord bless us all together heavenly father as we we have read from out of the bible now lord we look to the for the unwritten part of that word we we look for the great white horse rider of the holy spirit of almighty god to descend upon the word and cause that word of god to live again live in our hearts living our beings lord may the great holy spirit father take the word and make it so real so crystal clear to our hearts that we might see lord jesus what thou has done what you are doing and what you will do at the end of this all we give you all the praise the honor and the glory in jesus name amen and amen praise the lord please be seated ah praise god hallelujah amen now we know that jesus was predestinated jesus i'm not talking about the christ i'm talking about jesus the flesh that god was living in while he was here on earth that part was pre-destinated by the father that's why he called god the father and he came as the son or the son with all the other sons and daughters in him he came uh being the royal seed being the original seed being the gods seed word amen he was predestinated hallelujah hallelujah therefore being predestinated he could not help doing and being who he was amen because he was under inspiration of predestination amen but he was and still is the son of god hallelujah amen praise god and so are we in the same way because we are sons and daughters of god there are predestinated by the holy spirit we cannot help being who we are amen because god places here with under divine command hallelujah we are here not by our own will we didn't make a choice uh in this matter that i am going to be this i'm going to be a christian i'm going to be that i'm going to be the other no we are here by the grace of god and true predestination hallelujah amen praise god listen brother branham if you were intended to see the word of god you will see it and believe it hallelujah praise god amen if you were predestinated by god you understand then you will see it if you're in that group if you are in that part of god if you're one of god's genes germs you will see it and you will believe it praise god hallelujah amen and this is when i'm just recapping this part here with his when he says do you see there is something out there have you ever heard of a strain in a family family traits house one son will be like the father or the mother or another child like the grandfather or the great grandmother that's a strain in that family do you believe it you see you heard it amen that's the same thing with predestination and from predestination hallelujah you're supposed to be here in the right way at the beginning hallelujah see you're supposed to be here on the predestination you are supposed to come the way of the spoken word how jesus was born by the spoken word through an angel from the beginning you should have come that way by the spoken word from adam at that time praise god and then we would have come living a life his life through the spoken word and as genes of god as his generation and after his kind we would be like that from the very beginning see oh but now you see because you come the other way you are subject to the fall no man can say he's without sin if you go to paul that's what he's saying here you're subject to the fall being that you are predestinated to hear this word that brings you right back to where you were procrastinated hallelujah what he's saying it reverses the curse satan interrupted the whole thing when you should have gone with a spoken word birth through eve or by eve through adam bringing the word hallelujah this uh seven angel brings back the spoken word to reverse what satan did and bring back the original birth hallelujah bring back the right birth hallelujah a sister uh wright would have said praise god i believe that do you believe in praise god the right work will make you believe it and see it praise the lord hallelujah amen now what makes you believe the word of god and turn down the other things that you are hearing it's because there's something in you do you believe it something in you he says that was there way back way back yonder it was there praise god hallelujah and that's why you reject the other things you're hearing it like everybody else you're seeing it like everybody else but your reaction is coming from the gene that was already predestinated from before the foundation of the world glory to god hallelujah amen praise god oh my yes praise god now all he for knew he called and all he called it justified he was and glorified hallelujah amen you say well brother branham what's the use of him preaching them oh my oh bro there's a crop out there amen hallelujah and the reason why god could manifest through jesus is because he was a predestinated messiah lamb body that was supposed to be there in that age at that particular time for the father to be able to manifest through is that right now we know in the this age brother branham took that place or was given that place that god put messengers in each edge that whenever when he wants to manifest himself when he wants to restore his word he will come to that messenger whoever he was and reveal himself through that person amen oh that's what has happened in our age god revealing himself not god but there looking back at jesus and the devil has got the people looking back and not seeing what god has done and is doing right now in this age to glorify his great name and they're missing it again why god hides in simplicity and reveals himself in the very same thing you see the reason why god could manifest work through jesus he was a manifested son to be the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world praise god hallelujah amen and the reason why god will work through you is because you are predestinated children of the living god amen praise god hallelujah amen glory blessed be his name now you see he did the will of the father and he was the word man manifest when he did the will of the father and every one of the other sons and daughters will have the same manifestation what will there be the word it will be the father working through you it's god making himself manifest not back there that's already happened that's fulfilled amen but we are here to fulfill the rest of the scriptures concerning him praise god so that the holy spirit could use this part of the body to manifest himself in this hour sons and daughters placed strategically by god in this age amen see no no wonder i can't talk about that no wonder paul said even if your heart starts to doubt you god is greater than your heart because god has let this whole plan place itself out there and because you're in this flesh out there you may struggle you may fall you made this you made that but he has got a goal and he said if they're in my hand there's none can take them out none can take them away they're going to press their way through it all amen no matter whatsoever praise god hallelujah amen amen and so you see there's a little group that is that's in every generation that will come up is that right there's a little group in every generation and that group is going to come up the devil can put all the concrete he wants in you he can put all the dirt he wants on you he could give you all the names that he likes on you but god has spoken there's going to be a little group in every age and they're going to come up glory to god hallelujah yes now i tell you friends this word is supposed to be made manifest in every age and the believers that went before us they ran their race and they fulfilled their part of the body of the world they fulfill their part now as the prophets it is becoming unto us to fulfill all of righteousness all of the rest of the world has becoming on us to fulfill the word of the living god amen yes sir and so no matter what happens around us let's fulfill god's word with this this assurance that we are anchored in jesus christ we are and god by the seed word that answers us and change us as prisoners to jesus christ hallelujah amen hebrews 11 listen paul said oh there wonder in sheepskins and good skins they were destitutes some were sick and afflicted and even tormented my of whom the world is not worthy of amen amen praise god so you may have nothing to eat sometimes amen and have to run about and uh digging out here and have to double their persecuted hair persecuted there like them was isaiah and them oh my see that happened but remember isaiah and them were predestinated even before the world began and so were you and he should have come true see the womb of eve by the spoken word of adam but when he came through the womb of a woman then you see god let his spirit come here and be on the earth as a witness so your being is here as a witness no matter what the devil does no matter what corruption what evil what's tense whatever god ensures by being working true and manifesting himself through his believers amen hallelujah my brother sister that their life will be a witness just like job [Music] no matter what he does amen i will not curse god and die i will not put aside this word i will not get rid of this word or this message amen no matter what he slay me i'll trust in him brother brethren it said if he decided to send me to hell then i'll go and i'll still love him praise god because that's what he purposed for us amen glory be to god on high lord of god amen you see jesus also came predestinated for a witness a witness of what death a witness of what burial resurrection all to show that man will die because of what satan did but listen here to show that man will die but they will live again through believing him for he is the seed amen praise god hallelujah all praise god and it has to come up because it's part of that seed amen he came up you've got to come up because you're part of that seed you are in him before the foundation of the world it's not maybe so you're not wondering now you're not hoping that you make it you're not trusting god i escape hell hell is not even in your thoughts anymore your heaven bound with the grace of god the holy spirit will take you nowhere else the pillar of fire will lead you nowhere else the word will light up and guide you and lead you right into the perfect light by the grace of god hallelujah amen i tell you my friends amen you see pre-destinated as he was the word seed was made flesh and now him the seed becomes flesh in you amen in other words you become the flesh of the world another quotation he said the word is becoming flesh and flesh is becoming worse amen praise god amen hallelujah amen surely brother branham you'll say i believe every word oh my that's wonderful then if you believe it don't back up don't slow down oh stare right with that word oh my he said remember i want you to it's by your constant belief in the word amen that life that you live never denying nothing amen the life that you live you see the devil's got them believing the life that you live the the natural life that you live but he's talking about you living the life of that gene that is in you you're letting that the life of the gene which is jesus christ the word in you live out through you and that's the life that you live and you don't go about worrying and wondering about that god promised in this word he's gonna go float through your life amen praise god hallelujah and what when the spirit fell on him what kind of a life did he bring speaking of abraham now remember abraham was predestinated and when the spirit fell on him what kind of a life did he bring he brought forth a faith life can you believe that do you say amen he brought forth a faith life what kind of a life did he bring forth when the spirit fell on him he brought forth a fair life he repeats here but you know faith is a revelation it's not just believing because you got to have something to believe and something has to be revealed to you to know what to believe is that right praise god hallelujah so he brought forth a life of revelation and of believing god that is what abraham brought forth amen praise god now remember abraham believed god's word regardless of the circumstances let me stop a minute here and bring a thought here you say abraham believe god do you know what the bible tells us in genesis uh there how that abraham was with his father in aura of the chaldeas and all that abraham heard was a voice a voice saying abraham rise up leave or if the child is going to the land where i have called you and the bible tells us he rose up not knowing where he went but just following this voice that was speaking to him oh it's so beautiful it's so simple do you realize abraham never read a book do you realize abraham was following what we call the unwritten word [Music] he was following the unwritten word of god because he recognized that voice that was leading him was the voice of god many voices in the world but as we said before you don't listen to those voices but there's one voice when it sounds it strikes something in your soul it strikes the gene within your soul you know it's different praise god hallelujah amen cause him to recognize and believe the unwritten word of that day so the unwritten word is a voice is that right it's a voice it's not written and so abraham believe the voice of god praise god hallelujah amen and why did he believe the voice praise god why why would he believe the voice just hear a voice come out of the atmosphere like that and right away believe the voice because when the voice sounded the voice sounded familiar to him other people might have been scared of that voice but to him the voice was familial and the reason why the voice was familiar because the germ the gene was there with them other sons and daughters of all the other ages singing and shouting and praising and worshiping god up in heaven that's why he asked job have you come out to spiritual amnesia as yet let me ask you where were you when them other sons and daughters of god were singing and shouting for joy where were you when they were praising and worshiping me hallelujah amen that's the reason why abraham recognized the voice when it came out of god is that right let me go a little further i won't go down that line but i just want to show you something here when melchizedek right up on the horse or whatever to abraham and started speaking to him right away abraham said my lord he recognized not the shape the form god can make himself manifest in any form he wants to make himself but he recognized the voice hallelujah of the one that was speaking oh because the deep cross to the deep and the deep will respond hallelujah oh praise god amen glory to god forevermore that my lord don't you understand that's why wha it seems like sometimes when brother brethren is speaking i am speaking some other preachers speak in the word sometimes before they can say it it's already in your heart it's ready in your heart and not only that it sounds familiar like you heard it somewhere else before you don't know how but you know you it sounds i don't know can't remember where but it seems like i heard that you're dead but not on earth your heart is in glory amen you're only set down here to be a witness to the word of the living god amen oh praise god we're in this church we are preaching the word you are believing the word there are other men of god really truly called of god let me tell you something is going on this message is starting to rise into a crescendo it's coming to a place where everything is going up amen praise god we're going up in the first resurrection and the spirit of god is witnessing to it and striking it amen hallelujah amen praise god pray praise god my friends you must believe this or you are lost you say believe what brother branham are you saying we must believe you i've never really seen this before he says must be we have to believe you or you're lost well you know brother brandon he said well no sir not me but but i am saying believe the word praise god i'm saying believe the word and the word in him speaking i believe the word but yet he knows it's not him amen praise god glory to god see oh my the bible says to believe this word and now i'm speaking it and he has confirmed it and he's confirming it praise god that is the same word you had in that bible that is now back here again and is confirming that it's that same word praise god forevermore as you're happy we have the same word the apostles had the same word every one of the sages had not a different word but the same word but it sounds strange to them because their soul never heard that voice before praise god hallelujah amen oh my don't you understand it predestinated as he was he had to be the word seed now the church today the bride today she is predestinated what did god say she would be a bride without spot or wrinkle that's her being predestinated right there already amen you know what he's talking about here i mean he couldn't talk all these things and take up a lot of time but he is talking about when god had a bride in his mind amen of course just like when god said a virgin will conceive god doesn't have to wait for to see mary to know who he's going to be he already knows from the time he spoke the word who the virgin is going to be so when he says there's going to be a bride and that bride is going to be without spot and she's going to be without wrinkle is that right you know what what that is talking about he's already guaranteeing that no matter what the devil tries to do with that bride she is going to come out of this world walk in the world and wait she's going to come out spotless she's going to come out without a wrinkle amen it's got to happen it's going to happen not just by your effort because he spoke it and it has to happen without spotter without wrinkle it's predestinated just as christ jesus christ was predestinated hallelujah amen praise god now when the spirit came on jesus he bore record and testimony of the word of god and when the spirit water falls on this lord seed of abraham all of abraham's faith in god's word it will produce the same kind of crop same kind of manifestation same kind of crop by the grace of god hallelujah amen yes sir and if that seed comes up it will have to be after abraham's kind it'll have to be after jesus christ kind no wonder isaiah says in that day he shall see his generations amen he shall see them praise the name of the lord oh my praise god you believe you're abraham's seed [Music] hallelujah so you got some of the family peculiarities of god believing the word amen you can't help that because it's just natural to you when you're in that family that you just believe the word you you don't have to be trained into it you don't have to be schooled into it you don't have to give enough bibles class to be in it you are just you're just part of the family of god you're part of the spiritually abrahamic family and they behave a certain way and all they know about is to believe god and to follow the word follow the pillar of fire wherever he leads amen genesis 17 gonna read now i will make thee exceedingly fruitful praise the lord and i will make many nations and kings come out of thee and i will establish my covenant now i want you to watch now listen and watch between me and thee that's god and abraham and with thy seed after thee in all their generations that are going to come glory to god god has a covenant with you you believe like abraham you've got a covenant with you praise god so we are covenant people we are covenanted people we're not just walking around like that we are kept by the power of god through faith oh the spirit of the living god moving across the soul moving across your being it bades you the spirit reign of the holy spirit wakes up the life that was in you praise god and brings you back to your original life that you should have had the devil tried to block you from it but our god has made a way amen with dies between me and thee and with thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant is that right praise be to god hallelujah to be a god unto the unto thy seed unto thee now brother bran ask the question now what is the seed of abraham now not abraham's flesh paul already let us know that that the jew outwardly is not a jew it's the jew that is a jew inwardly that is the real jew what is the seed of abraham then now see those that believe the whole word of god regardless of denomination regardless of papa mama whoever whatever anybody else says they don't care they believe the whole word of god amen praise god i'll establish my covenant amen with with thee and with the seed thy seed in each generation that comes after thee that will believe it praise god hallelujah there you are god said i will establish it not just with abraham back there but with this seed in the generations here now praise god you believe that go pray say i am abraham's seed say it again i am abraham seed not my flesh but in my soul i'm a abraham seed pray hallelujah praise god he said let's go now to ephesians paul an apostle of jesus christ or he says here a set one sent here to the saints by jesus christ all by the will of god to the saints amen was it to everybody no sir everybody can hear it but everybody can't take it that's right this was sent to the saints amen praise god so paul came particularly when jesus came you know he came he says to the lost sheep of the house of israel praise god now paul comes and he comes to the saints that are at ephesus now that doesn't just say ephesus there right you'll know that that is speaking of all believers true believers that believe the word of god hallelujah oh my now but that's already in there see that's what i hope you see and understand because i am now talking to this congregation amen this morning those that are already in jesus christ that are faithful in jesus christ amen according as he has chosen us in him praise god according to the word see you were chosen in him now stop and think he says did we choose him but that's what the denominations are teaching that is how the devil is so cunning that will take the very word he'll quote the same scripture but put a different meaning or a different thing on it that the people can't see the truth right but according as he has chosen us and he chose us when we were in him and then you see the scripture goes on before the foundation of the world so so all these little jingles and jangles that they have i took jesus as my savior you take him too oh i oh they'll speak in tongues and they'll say oh i can remember the very night on november there's so so date in a year so and so when i give my heart to jesus and i chose jesus to be my lord and savior and they're sincere when they're doing it but the prophet said sincere has nothing to do with it see it's good you're sincere but if there's no g no germ no seed in there isaac saw what's his name he saw sought repentance with tears but he couldn't find it he couldn't find it because he was not in god's predestinated plan and though jacob appeared like a rogue and a renegade he was the one that was elected and predestinated god is gonna clean him up when he's ready god is gonna shape him up when he wants to god will put him in position once the hour and the time praise the lord are you following me here praise be to god according as he has chosen us in him according to the word you didn't choose him jesus himself said that you never chose me i chose you oh yes when did he choose you when did jesus choose you the scripture said jesus he chose his church before the foundation of the world praise the lord hallelujah praise god oh my just think of it according as he has chosen us in him at the last revival he chose you at the last revival was it oh no no you were chosen before the foundation of the world amen praise god oh i know that i was chosen when dr swan saw when when this great preacher preached and i know i was chosen oh no you were chosen before the foundation of the world just to just to throw this in so your mind could tie some of those things together if you have eternal life now eternal life don't have beginnings it doesn't have endings and you can't say oh you were saved on this night or this day or this hour you are always eternal you are always in him you are always a part of him so he is eternal you are eternal praise god you're only living for a time imprisoned in a body amen hallelujah that this body that's white has to grow old and pass away to release you from these bars of bone on skin veil of press out amen into the presence of almighty god hallelujah oh my yes you might have read such things in some creed or some textbook amen born again on a certain day not in this one you won't find it in this book nowhere certain time again no you won't find it in there therefore he says he let me repeat according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world when were we chosen at the last revival no sir the night we claimed we got saved no sir why when there was why because when there was no world yet no stars there were no atoms no molecules no nothing and you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world praise the lord you know the other parts where he says you are not you are you're not conscious of it now because of the shock from eve sin amen cause you not to remember and to know who you really are but the word of god has come now to bring light to bring truth to bring you back to the familial places that you knew before praise god that you might recognize who you really are amen oh my yes sir chosen in him before all of that chosen to be what to be the bride you were chosen to be the bride mary was chosen to be the mother of jesus to bring forth the word let me let me place it that way so to bring a little more understanding clarity she was predestinated elected predestinated and called that she might bring forth the word by receiving god's spoken word through the voice of an angel so are we here today by the grace of god hallelujah listen that we should be holy without blame before him in love amen according to the good pleasure of his will you were chosen elected and called to be holy without blame in him in his love and by his good pleasure that's what he wants is that right so so think of it no matter what the devil tell you in your mind no matter what anybody calls you no name they put on you god is still saying you're holy god is still saying i when i saw you you're blameless that's why brother branham says when god looks at you now through the blood he can't see all them other things because he sees his original vision of you holy amen without blame spotless without a wrinkle in him in love hallelujah [Music] praise god hallelujah the devil comes and takes some kind of graffiti and paint up your face paint up your body paint up this pick you up paint you to be a bad person paint you to be this kind of person but god sent the savior jesus christ to die shed his blood and the blood washes away all the paints and all them chains the devil tries to pour on you your skin is a fountain filled with blood that can wash your sins away wash your make you clean and make you a son or a daughter of the living god hallelujah amen praise god oh yes when did god do all of this before the foundation of the world amen you see we come by an illegitimate birth through eve's corruption you hear what he called that and illegitimate birth oh my yes sir oh see if we were left that way all of us that made all of our children subject to death amen right true subject to death but thank god the suffering god has made a way to redeem his children out of that [Music] amen for all the father had given me when he gave them to him when they were in him before the foundation of the world is that right and all the father had given me will come to me and no man nobody else in other words can come to me unless my father draws him praise god hallelujah glory to god oh my praise god now i'm going to start to wind this up now praise god yes brother sister oh my see here the sovereign god made a way to redeem his children now there is your great what is the great thing that you think you've done you've done nothing oh i prayed for the whole night i fasted i did this and i did that and now for sure you know the things i've done for the lord i know he saved me oh no it doesn't work that way see oh my what you think you've done you've done nothing more than that you ought to be ashamed of
