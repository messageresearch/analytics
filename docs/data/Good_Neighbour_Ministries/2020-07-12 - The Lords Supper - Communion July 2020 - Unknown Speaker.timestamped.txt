[0:14] brothers and sisters in Christ wherever
[0:18] you are whoever you are I come to you in
[0:23] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may
[0:27] that grow great Holy Spirit bless us all
[0:32] for me truly appreciate him and his help
[0:38] and teaching may the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:43] receive all the glory and the praise
[0:47] blessed be his holy name we are gathered
[0:52] together to partake of the Lord's Supper
[0:58] this we do in remembrance of him as we
[1:04] have been commanded and as the Apostles
[1:08] also practiced made a great holy spirit
[1:13] bless us all
[1:14] let us pray before we read our scripture
[1:18] our gracious Heavenly Father we thank
[1:22] thee for thy word we asked the blessing
[1:27] upon this congregation we ask your
[1:31] blessing upon your called out ones we
[1:36] call your blessing upon the glorious
[1:40] Assembly of God the firstborn from on
[1:45] high take all your glory Lord and speak
[1:50] to your children in the name of Jesus
[1:54] Christ amen and amen
[1:58] reading from 1st Corinthians chapter 11
[2:04] verses 23 to 25 for I have received of
[2:14] the Lord that which also I delivered
[2:18] unto you that the Lord Jesus the same
[2:24] night in which
[2:26] he was betrayed took bread and when he
[2:31] had given thanks he brake it and said
[2:37] take eat this is my body which is broken
[2:44] for you this do in remembrance of me
[2:52] after the same manner also he took the
[2:58] cup when he had supped saying this cup
[3:03] is the New Testament in my blood
[3:09] this know ye as oft as you drink it in
[3:15] remembrance of me now brothers and
[3:23] sisters we are here to talk about the
[3:28] Lord's Supper and together around the
[3:31] Lord's table
[3:34] of course the Lord's Supper tells us a
[3:40] wonderful story it is the story of
[3:44] redemption that we can see in the
[3:49] emblems that the Lord Himself gave to us
[3:54] that whenever we look at them whenever
[3:59] we partake of them whenever we are
[4:03] together in fellowship we do this in
[4:08] remembrance of him because it tells us
[4:13] the story of how a savior came from
[4:17] glory came and died upon the Calvary's
[4:22] cross how he purchased our attention it
[4:27] tells the story these very emblems tell
[4:32] the story if we have the mind and the
[4:36] instruction of God to understand
[4:40] these emblems also point to the person
[4:46] of this story and that person is none
[4:52] other than the Lord Jesus Christ for he
[4:56] is the center of all things he is the
[5:00] wheel in the middle of the wheel he is
[5:05] the one that controls all things and he
[5:10] is the beginning he is the ending he is
[5:14] the same yesterday today and forever he
[5:19] is all in all and the entire story of
[5:24] redemption
[5:26] it just centers around here as he is the
[5:32] central figure of this entire story and
[5:36] the Lord's Supper speaks of him the
[5:43] Lord's Supper also my brother sisters
[5:47] reveals the bride as the purpose of the
[5:53] story why did Jesus come why did he
[5:57] leave this ivory palaces of glory to
[6:01] come the sinful earth what was his
[6:05] mission
[6:06] what was his the purpose of him
[6:09] fulfilling the word it was that he might
[6:13] come and redeem his bride who were in
[6:19] the devil's pawn shop of sin and so the
[6:25] bride is the purpose that made him live
[6:29] the glory of heaven and come into the
[6:34] sin cursed world for you and I I am so
[6:39] happy today that this Savior blessed
[6:43] Jesus this great Redeemer thought about
[6:47] us and came to redeem us
[6:51] his precious blood hallelujah glory to
[6:54] God amen
[6:56] these big limbs points to this great
[7:03] time of the calling out of the bride we
[7:09] are taking the Lord's Supper and as we
[7:12] take it may we meditate upon these
[7:16] things how this we are how privileged we
[7:20] are who on earth we are then the king
[7:24] will come to save Biggers bidders
[7:29] apparently beggars slaves
[7:33] apparently slaves my brothers but
[7:36] underneath that exterior their lives
[7:41] within the human body of chosen one part
[7:48] of the body of Christ
[7:50] the bride of Jesus Christ that called
[7:53] out once the ecclesia of God the real
[7:57] New Jerusalem the bride Church of the
[8:02] Living God in the last day for whom he
[8:06] shed his blood or the father plan to
[8:10] save your bed died and now the Holy
[8:14] Spirit is here executing the plan to
[8:18] bring forth as I say to you now this
[8:22] Lord's Supper also points to the
[8:25] consummation of this story what a
[8:29] beautiful ending story a what a story of
[8:33] love and redemption how the Prince of
[8:37] glory came to redeem a captive bride and
[8:43] to take her out from the prison doors
[8:46] the prisons and the walls of sin and to
[8:50] bring her out and take her back to his
[8:55] father's house for in my father's house
[8:59] there are many mansions
[9:01] and so we see this this this story has a
[9:05] beautiful ending where the bride and the
[9:09] bridegroom the prince of life and his
[9:13] wife the story ends with them living
[9:17] happily ever after
[9:20] within the millennial kingdom of God and
[9:23] after that into the eternity you never
[9:27] end the eternities way beyond tomorrow
[9:31] in the very presence of Almighty God
[9:34] oh what a day what an hour I live for
[9:38] the great hour of the manifestation of
[9:41] the fullness of the word and therefore
[9:46] when we come for this Lord supper we do
[9:50] not come with sadness we do not come
[9:54] with weeping and wailing but we come to
[9:58] have a celebration
[10:00] oh this Lord's Supper is a celebration
[10:04] of his life and of ours his life in us
[10:11] we celebrate this fact that God has come
[10:17] to take his home and his Dominion within
[10:21] our hearts and life aren't you happy
[10:23] aren't you glad that out of a 1 in a
[10:27] million
[10:28] he called you out of the miry clay when
[10:31] a million people perished under the
[10:35] throes of sin Satan and suffering at the
[10:40] same time he brought you out and he
[10:44] unveiled you that you are part of him
[10:48] and actually you are a part of him
[10:52] revealed Oh fake Spirit of God whoa for
[10:56] this marvelous and wonderful deposit

[11:06] because it's eternal in us we can never
[11:11] time for he that liveth and believeth on
[11:13] me shall never die

[11:18] spirit of Almighty God live in our

[11:41] are not here to fast but we are here to
[11:44] feast and when we eat the bread and we
[11:48] drink the wine we think of the
[11:51] supernatural spiritual feast now upon
[11:55] the revealed Word of God and equipment
[11:58] power of the Spirit of God that comes
[12:01] upon that word and makes it live again
[12:04] and that places us also at the great
[12:09] supper time we shall have in heaven with
[12:13] all the saints of all the ages o blessed

[12:19] Florida God so we are here for a

[12:41] Lord God your Savior as merry soul
[12:44] rejoice in the Lord praise his marvelous
[12:48] and wonderful name this Lord supper is
[12:52] also a sacrifice but not because it's a
[12:58] sacrifice where we see him hanging on
[13:02] the cross playing of the cross being
[13:05] pierced on the cross being much scuffed
[13:09] up spot upon why he was on the cross but
[13:13] we have it our open eyes can now see the
[13:16] dot which appeared because remember
[13:19] my brother sister let this symbol my
[13:23] friends we see here this symbol of the
[13:27] sacrificial symbol following all the
[13:30] substitutes until him hanging on the
[13:34] rear as the reality upon the cross to
[13:37] the true believer with open eyes we see
[13:41] as a scene of joy we see it as a scene
[13:46] of victory the Lord's Supper represents
[13:50] his victory his glorious victory in his
[13:55] love the vying for us
[13:57] don't bring us back to himself for God
[14:01] wasn't Christ redeeming the world on to
[14:05] himself glory be to God forevermore
[14:09] hallelujah amen thanks be to God yes sir
[14:13] we know that bliss Lord's Supper also is
[14:18] not a symbol of shame for hanging on the
[14:23] cross in the time of Israel back there
[14:28] back in the old days my friends was a
[14:32] sign of shame it was a sign of being a
[14:36] criminal and a cast from society one
[14:40] that was rejected they were not
[14:43] realizing they were rejecting the chief
[14:46] Cornerstone they were rejecting the
[14:48] Keystone
[14:49] they were rejecting the foundation stone
[14:52] they were for rejecting the capstone
[14:56] whoa praise God
[14:58] the glorious stone that God said I'll
[15:02] lay in Zion a cornerstone a beautiful
[15:07] stone and Jesus Christ is that stone
[15:10] that rock of all ages that ever-present
[15:14] what rock that gives us ever living
[15:18] water life-giving water for the soul of
[15:21] the true believer
[15:22] so this penny on the cross this Lord
[15:26] suffered to us is not a symbol of shame
[15:31] but a great symbol of glory hallelujah
[15:36] it's a symbol of glory it's a glorious
[15:40] symbol praise God hallelujah can you see
[15:44] it it's not shame but its glory praise
[15:47] God hallelujah Lord of God amen
[15:51] so when we look we don't just see
[15:56] punishment punishment on that cross we
[16:01] don't just see that yes yes oh praise
[16:06] God hallelujah according to Isaiah how
[16:11] that the Lord had placed upon him the
[16:15] iniquity of us all
[16:17] and Isaiah said the Lord struck him Amen
[16:21] God struck him he bore our sins God
[16:25] stricken but we do not see just the fact
[16:29] that God struck him and he took the
[16:32] punishment but we see our glorious
[16:35] relief a release because the day he was
[16:39] punished that was the day we were set
[16:42] free for he became poor that we may
[16:45] become rich he becomes sin that we may
[16:49] become the righteousness of God
[16:51] hallelujah oh he went to a devil's hell
[16:55] that we might avoid that praise God he
[16:59] took her place at Calvary so that
[17:02] justice may be able to be fulfilled and
[17:07] the wrath of God can pass over you and I
[17:10] and we can come into the boldly before
[17:14] the throne of God under the blood of
[17:17] Christ
[17:18] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ set
[17:21] free by this great thing that happened
[17:25] upon go gatos hill so the Lord's Supper
[17:29] is more than just seeing
[17:32] brand and the way but it seems a
[17:35] revelation the understanding behind the
[17:39] symbolism of the bread and wine the
[17:44] Lord's Supper hallelujah praise God we
[17:49] see it with our own eyes and realize
[17:52] that is not just seeing the punishment
[17:55] but seeing that precious one that set us
[17:58] free by his precious blood praise God
[18:03] our eyes have been opened of your ways
[18:06] been opened my eyes have been open I
[18:08] believe that our eyes have been open by
[18:12] the revelation of God we have accepted
[18:15] the dopping of the ice-sub across our
[18:20] eyes my prophetic hands that is open our
[18:23] eyes to recognize the Word of God for
[18:27] there are and for this day whether our
[18:30] praise God hallelujah Oh may we look at
[18:34] him hanging on the cross and let me say
[18:39] this we do not only see punishment but
[18:43] we see atonement we see that we come
[18:48] back to pan at one met with God we have
[18:53] come back to oneness with God hallelujah
[18:56] plural in God God and I walking down
[19:01] with life's Road together walking in a
[19:04] fellowship in union once again like he
[19:08] did with Adam and Eve when he came down
[19:12] at the evening time at the cool of the
[19:14] day to have fellowship with them and
[19:17] here at the end of the world hearing
[19:20] comes and can the mighty God in Christ
[19:23] don't have fellowship with his beloved
[19:26] sons our daughters here in the evening
[19:30] time once again this
[19:31] is evening time its leader than your
[19:35] sink and God keeps all of his
[19:37] appointments and here he descends by the
[19:40] opening of seven seals and presents
[19:43] himself to his people that we might
[19:46] recognize that we are a redeemed people
[19:50] we are Atonement of people that have
[19:54] received a torment and we have come back
[19:57] into reconciliation with God the
[20:01] fellowship that was broken has been
[20:04] restored our joy of salvation has been
[20:08] restored our union with him has been
[20:12] restored how happy can we be to

[20:23] souls and bring us light at the may
[20:26] become children of the light to walk no

[20:42] resides and is resident within the
[20:45] hearts of the true believer thanks be to
[20:48] God hallelujah amen this Lord supper
[20:54] also is symbolic and points to the bond
[20:59] of brotherhood of all believers of all

[22:04] invisible union with Christ and with
[22:08] each other and Prescott we have
[22:11] communion with him and we also have
[22:15] communion with each other the fellowship
[22:19] of all the saints of all the ages don't
[22:23] you think the scripture is real where
[22:26] Paul said we are in compassed with my
[22:31] friends a cloud a great cloud of
[22:34] witnesses don't you think when we come
[22:37] together to celebrate and to have a
[22:40] festival of the Lord's Supper that they
[22:44] are observing and watching what we are
[22:47] doing and are happy and rejoicing in
[22:51] heaven that they've got the revelation
[22:53] of the last prophets message they've got
[22:56] the revelation of who Jesus Christ is
[22:59] this the revelation of the truth water
[23:03] baptism this caught the revelation of
[23:06] the opening of the word the calling out
[23:09] of their names they have caught the
[23:12] revelation of the things that are going
[23:15] to be and they're fully aware of the
[23:18] modern offense of causing them to look
[23:21] up for ridiculousness or to recognize
[23:25] modern events being made clear by the
[23:30] vindicated prophecy of the Son of God
[23:33] that he sent as his messenger in this
[23:37] age and in this hour
[23:39] praise the Lord so when we come to the
[23:43] Lord's table let us be conscious and
[23:46] aware we are not alone but we are in
[23:50] compass' by this
[23:52] in narubu host this grit of this great
[23:56] cloud of witnesses oh please God that
[24:01] our rejoicing along with us and we are
[24:04] in fellowship with those sins according
[24:07] to the Word of God shall I read now
[24:10] which up of Revelation chapter 19 verses
[24:16] 5 to 9 and the voice came out of the
[24:21] throne saying praise our God all his
[24:25] servants and ye that fear him books
[24:30] small and great and I heard as it were
[24:34] the voice of a great multitude and as
[24:39] the voice of many waters and as the
[24:42] voice of many thunderings mighty
[24:45] thunderings saying alleluia alleluia
[24:50] for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth let
[24:55] us be glad and rejoice and give honor
[25:00] unto Him where the marriage of the lamb
[25:04] is come and his wife has made herself
[25:09] ready and to her was granted that she
[25:13] should be arrayed in fine linen clean
[25:16] and wait for the fine linen is the
[25:20] righteousness of the saints and he said
[25:24] unto me write blessed are they which are
[25:28] called unto the marriage supper of the
[25:31] lamb and he said unto me these are the
[25:36] true sayings of God hallelujah thanks be
[25:40] to God for being called to the marriage
[25:43] supper of the lamb of which this here's
[25:47] only a prefigure of that which is to
[25:52] come the Lord's Supper that we partake
[25:56] off praise God Oh hallelujah prefigures
[26:00] the marriage supper that is to come
[26:05] great supper of the Lamb praise God
[26:09] so this communion this great fellowship
[26:16] will come to its fullness when we are
[26:21] together again in our father's house now
[26:26] the family of God is scattered here and
[26:29] there plus 1 some writer says but Lord
[26:33] we love them there and wherever they are
[26:37] we love them dearly
[26:39] Oh God we're whichever the so-called
[26:44] pastor denomination church group
[26:47] wherever they are with no salvation it's
[26:51] not a mass event but it is an individual
[26:56] of fear of God speaking to our hearts
[26:58] and our prayer to bathe our work and our
[27:02] mission our zeal and our desire is to
[27:05] find our brothers and sisters your loved
[27:09] ones your hipbones your chosen ones
[27:12] wherever they are father and bring them
[27:16] pretension of your work so that we can
[27:19] go together and meet again in our
[27:23] father's house meet them in the morning
[27:26] by the eastern gate where there will be
[27:29] rejoicing and praising the Lord
[27:32] hallelujah
[27:33] then brother sister we know them with
[27:38] all these truths that the Lord's Supper
[27:43] is a solemn affair it's joyful
[27:47] but it's something Supper and solemn and
[27:55] this observance of the Lord's Supper is
[27:58] not based on the matter of our moves on
[28:03] any certain day well I I have a bad mood
[28:08] I don't feel like taking the Lord's
[28:11] Supper today or I am not feeling well
[28:17] and that happened in my life so today
[28:20] I'm going to take a pass it's not the
[28:23] casual affair you're identifying
[28:26] yourself at Christ regardless of how you
[28:29] feel how you your body feels your mind
[28:32] feels your spirit filled it has nothing
[28:36] to do with your moods or your condition
[28:39] because he can make you whole in every
[28:43] area and every part of your life if you
[28:46] come to him and turn your life
[28:49] completely to him and recognize what
[28:52] these symbols here represents my friends
[28:56] the Lord's Supper is not based upon
[28:58] emotions though it has a lot of emotions
[29:02] in it it is not based as I've said afore
[29:06] upon our feelings or upon our mood but
[29:10] it is based upon their obedience in the
[29:13] worst of Word of God for the Lord
[29:16] Himself has sent unto us this do in
[29:22] remembrance of me so it is a commend it
[29:28] is friends something we must do in
[29:31] obedience to him it is our Christian
[29:36] duty to obey the Word of God it is also
[29:41] a privilege for by doing this but coming
[29:46] to the Lord's Supper you are pointing
[29:49] symbolizing prophetically that you are
[29:53] one that will be sitting at the Lord's
[29:56] table
[29:57] oh praise God in eternity 'he's to come
[30:01] partaking of the marriage supper of the
[30:05] lamb or what a privilege my friends
[30:08] blessed are you to hear the words of
[30:11] this book this is are your ears blessed

[30:17] know him in the power of his record
[30:20] resurrection glory to God hallelujah I
[30:24] want to send you my brother
[30:25] and sisters if your covenant of
[30:28] commitment and of consecration has been
[30:35] broken

[30:39] as the scripture has said Letterman or a
[30:43] woman examine themselves and let them
[30:47] drink it's a counting time take account
[30:52] of yourself take stock of yourself
[30:57] people of God children of the Lord my
[31:01] brothers and sisters wherever you are
[31:04] take account of yourself search your
[31:09] hearts and if you are not certain of
[31:12] your memory of of your ability to set
[31:15] your own heart say search me O Lord and
[31:19] see if there be any wicked way in me O
[31:23] Lord and set me free let this be a
[31:27] prayer praise God hallelujah the Lord's
[31:31] Supper is also a reminder that if we
[31:37] forgotten let us remember that the
[31:40] Lord's Supper is a is the seal of the
[31:44] order covenant of grace that God has
[31:48] given unto us you know it natural life
[31:54] the use and purpose of a seal if you
[31:59] have ever dealt with a lawyer a notary
[32:03] public and you have to have some
[32:05] official document with you and they were
[32:10] the place they are seized on it you
