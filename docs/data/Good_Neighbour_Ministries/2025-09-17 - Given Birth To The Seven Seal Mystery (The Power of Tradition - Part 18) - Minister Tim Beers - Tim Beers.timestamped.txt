[25:03] how we desire, oh God, to hear from you
[25:05] tonight, Lord. Our desire is to know
[25:07] what you have set aside in your portion
[25:10] for us tonight, Lord. Catch that vision
[25:12] that you've set before us, oh God, that
[25:15] we can keep walking in your way, oh God.
[25:18] As your songwriter said, teach us to

[25:44] said, Lord, to be what we have to be on
[25:46] this earth, Lord. what you set us to be,
[25:47] Lord. That's our desire tonight, Lord.
[25:50] As your speaker would come tonight,
[25:51] Lord, where you inspire him, oh God, to
[25:53] move out the way, oh God, and you speak
[25:55] through him, Lord, and each and every
[25:57] one of us would hear, catch a word from
[25:59] you tonight. One word from you, Lord, is
[26:01] all we need. May you grant these things
[26:03] tonight, oh God. We give you thanks. We
[26:05] give you praise. In your precious name
[26:08] we pray. Amen. Can I have a give?

[34:37] the revealed word of the hour. Amen.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, let us turn. We got a
[34:43] couple scriptures reading here. We got
[34:44] Bible study tonight, right?
[34:47] &gt;&gt; So, we got some scriptures and a few
[34:49] quotes here. So, hallelujah. Amen. So,
[34:53] let's turn to John 3:3, then Ezekiel
[34:56] 36:24,
[34:58] then 1 Peter 1:18. Let's read the
[35:01] scriptures. Hallelujah.
[35:04] Jesus answered and said unto them,
[35:05] "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except
[35:08] a man be born again, he cannot see the
[35:11] kingdom of God." Hallelujah. So, there's
[35:13] one one right there. We can't see the
[35:16] kingdom of God. Hallelujah. Nicodemus
[35:19] said unto him, "How can a man be born
[35:23] when he is old? Can he enter a second
[35:25] time into his mother's womb and be
[35:28] born?" We can tell that that's carnal.
[35:31] Allelujah. He wasn't catching the
[35:32] revelation for the time and the age that
[35:35] he was in. Jesus answered, said,
[35:36] "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except
[35:39] a man be born of water and of spirit, he
[35:41] cannot enter into the kingdom of God."
[35:44] So he can't see, now he can't enter.
[35:48] Hallelujah. What is the kingdom of God?
[35:51] They they they said, "When is the
[35:52] kingdom coming to Jesus?" He said, "The
[35:54] kingdom has come." He is the kingdom,
[35:57] the revealed word of the hour.
[35:59] Hallelujah. We need to understand if we
[36:02] can't bring this home, this reality of
[36:04] the word of God home. You're never going
[36:06] to see it. You're never going to
[36:07] understand it. We got to place it today
[36:09] in in our lives.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. That which is born of
[36:14] the flesh is flesh, and that which is
[36:16] born of the spirit is spirit. Marvel not
[36:20] that I say unto thee, you must be born
[36:22] again. Marvel not.
[36:26] Don't be amazed. Don't be shocked.
[36:30] Even today, you must be born again.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[36:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[36:36] The wind bloweth where it listeth, and
[36:37] thou hearest the sound thereof, but can
[36:40] not tell whence it come and whether it
[36:43] goeth. So is everyone that is born of
[36:46] the spirit. Hallelujah. Nicodemus
[36:49] answered and said unto him, How can
[36:51] these things be?
[36:53] Oh my.
[36:55] Jesus answered and said unto them, Art
[36:58] thou a master of Israel,
[37:01] and knowest not these things?
[37:05] Oh my.
[37:07] We don't want the spirit of the Lord
[37:08] saying,
[37:10] "Don't you know the message of the hour
[37:12] and what is spoken, what is said, what
[37:14] is written,
[37:17] and what these things should be."
[37:19] Ezekiel 36:24.
[37:22] Hallelujah.
[37:24] I will take you from amongst the heathen
[37:27] and gather you out of all countries. And
[37:30] I will bring you into your land, and I
[37:33] will sprinkle clean water upon you, and
[37:36] ye shall be clean. From all your
[37:39] filthiness, and from all your idols will
[37:43] I cleanse you. A new heart also will I
[37:46] give you and a new spirit will I put
[37:49] within you.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; And I will take
[37:53] away the stony heart. Hallelujah. Amen.
[37:57] Out of your flesh and I will give you a
[38:00] heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit
[38:03] within you.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; You hear? You hear what he's saying? And
[38:08] cause you to walk in my statutes. I will
[38:11] cause you to walk by my spirit within
[38:14] you, and you shall keep my judgments and
[38:17] do them, and you shall dwell in the
[38:20] land, the land of revelation. Amen. That
[38:23] I give to your fathers,
[38:26] and ye shall be my people, and I will be
[38:30] your God. Oh, hallelujah. Glory to God.
[38:33] Amen. 1 Peter 1:18.
[38:36] Amen. And I can see all this manifesting
[38:39] in the new birth of the hour.
[38:41] Hallelujah.
[38:42] Amen. For as much as ye know that ye
[38:46] were not redeemed with corruptible
[38:49] things as silver and gold from your vain
[38:52] conversations, received by traditions of
[38:56] your fathers, but with the precious
[38:58] blood of Christ as a lamb without
[39:01] blemish and without spot, who verily was
[39:05] fore orained before the foundation of
[39:07] the world, but was manifested in these
[39:10] last times for you.
[39:14] He was manifested in these last times
[39:16] for you.
[39:18] Hallelujah. Who by him do believe in God
[39:22] that raised him from the dead and gave
[39:24] him glory that your faith and hope might
[39:27] be in God. See, and ye have purified
[39:30] your souls in obeying the truth through
[39:32] the spirit unto unferent love of the
[39:36] brethren. See that you love one another
[39:39] with a pure heart fervently, being born
[39:42] again, not of corruptible seed, but of
[39:46] incorruptible by the word of God, which
[39:49] liveth and abideth forever. Hallelujah.
[39:52] Amen. Glory to God. Let us pray. Father,
[39:55] we thank you, Lord, for this thought
[39:57] here tonight, Lord, that you've been
[40:00] burning on my heart. Father, I pray, oh
[40:03] God, the Holy Ghost, I can't do nothing
[40:05] without you, Lord. come and and raise
[40:08] the faith level now in this building,
[40:10] Father, in these hearts of your
[40:12] believers, Lord. Father, I pray a word
[40:15] would be spoken, Lord, that will
[40:18] enlighten and open up the light bulb and
[40:22] reveal. Let there be an awaken, Father,
[40:24] whether it be here or online. Let your
[40:26] presence, let your anointing come, oh
[40:29] God. Lord, we don't do nothing. We can't
[40:32] go anywhere, Lord, without you. Father,
[40:34] we can't take the next step without you.
[40:36] the next breath without you, Father.
[40:38] Come, oh God, and reveal what you want
[40:40] to be spoken here tonight, Father, in
[40:43] Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless. You're seated.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I just want to read um just let
[40:52] you know the messages that I'm getting
[40:53] out because I won't have time to, you
[40:55] know, quote this and quote that where
[40:57] it's coming from. They're just I'm just
[40:59] going to read and that's it. But all
[41:01] these thoughts here tonight or some of
[41:02] them whatever I get will be taken out of
[41:05] the messages on 65 it is the rising of
[41:08] the sun 63 desperation 63 the token 65
[41:13] birth pains 65 invisible union of the
[41:16] bride of Christ and 65 modern events
[41:19] being made clear by vindicated prophecy.
[41:21] Amen. Hallelujah. Glory to God. The
[41:24] bride has a right to the right birth.
[41:28] Hallelujah. Amen. That's that's her
[41:30] right to the right birth. Glory to God.
[41:35] There's always a fight when it comes to
[41:38] a birth. There's always a dying out, you
[41:43] know, as as the pastor said on Sunday to
[41:45] listen to what is the Holy Ghost given
[41:47] for because we're saying that to
[41:49] enlighten you. Amen. So that you can go
[41:52] back and meditate on the word and chew
[41:54] on the word. Hallelujah. Because this is
[41:57] a a day where where Satan is trying to
[42:01] make us so busy and so distracted that
[42:04] we don't feed on the word. And listen,
[42:06] you need to feed on the word of God.
[42:09] Amen. You need to feed on his spirit.
[42:11] Not just the letter, but his spirit.
[42:13] Amen. So go back and listen to the
[42:16] message after this message, birth pains,
[42:19] and you'll see a lot what I'm
[42:20] understanding and what he's bringing
[42:22] forth. A lot of the revelation. Amen.
[42:25] Amen. Because some of it might sound
[42:26] strange to you. Amen. But that's the way
[42:29] it's always been in every age. Amen.
[42:31] Hallelujah. They looked at brother
[42:33] Brandham and they said, "Oh, who are
[42:34] you? You're just a man. You're just a
[42:36] preacher. You got no education." But he
[42:38] was a prophet to the 21st century. Amen.
[42:42] Never been a prophet like that prophet.
[42:43] And I believe him with all my heart. But
[42:46] I also believe that the message him as a
[42:48] prophet, he was a seven church angel
[42:51] messenger. Amen. And the message as
[42:53] whole, part of it is to the Pentecostal
[42:56] church.
[42:58] Amen. Part of brother Brana's message
[43:01] gave birth only to the Pentecostal
[43:04] age and to the church. Amen. Hallelujah.
[43:09] Glory to God.
[43:11] Hallelujah. Amen. What is the meaning of
[43:14] spiritual rebirth?
[43:16] Being born again, spiritually rebirth
[43:19] also describes in the scriptures by such
[43:21] terms as baptism of fire or a mighty
[43:24] change is a spiritual transformation
[43:28] that results in one has actually
[43:31] received the Holy Ghost
[43:34] and experience the remission of sins
[43:36] that follow it. Experience what?
[43:39] Remission of sins. Recognizing, Amen,
[43:42] that you're a sinner. Recognizing that
[43:44] you're in unbelief. Recognizing that
[43:46] that that you know you the way that
[43:48] you're living, the way that you're
[43:50] believing, Amen. the way that you were
[43:52] taught before, Amen. was wrong,
[43:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Was wrong.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:01] Amen. Even if you're brought up in the
[44:03] message, you're born in the message.
[44:04] Amen. Hallelujah. It doesn't matter. You
[44:07] know, you're born in the message, you're
[44:09] hearing preaching, you're preaching, but
[44:11] you're not converted. You're not born
[44:13] again. Amen. So things that are being
[44:15] interpreted to you are different than
[44:18] somebody that's born again and listening
[44:20] to the same message that you are
[44:22] listening to. So you're brought up in
[44:24] the message not born again and realizing
[44:27] that you are getting programmed in your
[44:31] mind by certain thoughts and certain
[44:33] interpretations in your mind.
[44:37] Oh yes, it forms you just like just like
[44:40] a child from a young birth. Amen. when
[44:43] he's grown up, those first five years,
[44:45] whatever atmosphere that that child is
[44:48] in, whatever that they're being taught
[44:50] is forming their character, is forming
[44:53] their spirit is forming their ideal of
[44:56] what life and this life is all about.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[45:01] Amen. We're going to get somewhere soon.
[45:04] What is the biblical meaning of rebirth?
[45:08] The transformation power of faith,
[45:11] revelation
[45:13] in Jesus Christ, the revealed word, the
[45:16] belief in the continuum continuing
[45:20] of life and the possibility of
[45:23] transformation
[45:25] and growth over time. So we can see
[45:27] right there, it's a life. The rebirth is
[45:30] a life. It you give birth to life and it
[45:34] continues. It grows. Amen. It continues
[45:38] to grow. Amen. You tell me you give
[45:40] birth to a child and and that child is
[45:44] a, you know, six months old and and if
[45:46] that child in in 5 years is still 6
[45:49] months old, there's something wrong with
[45:51] that child. Nature tells you that that
[45:54] child after it's born into this world,
[45:58] it has to grow. It's got to feed and it
[46:01] has to grow. Why? It's been given new
[46:03] life.
[46:05] God breathed the life, natural life into
[46:08] that child and that's why it lives. And
[46:11] in its body, its natural body, amen, it
[46:14] has all the things required so that it
[46:17] can grow.
[46:20] So life when you're born again is a
[46:22] continuing growth. Hallelujah.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not I'm not pointing any
[46:28] fingers here, but I'm telling you people
[46:30] I've come across people in this message.
[46:32] Amen. and even out of their own lips. I
[46:34] got no testimony. I got no growth. I
[46:37] don't see God in my life.
[46:42] Hallelujah.
[46:43] People wondering whether they're born
[46:46] again. People wondering whether whether
[46:49] God is in their life or not. Doubting,
[46:51] questioning
[46:53] how can a you know when you when you
[46:55] give life, you notice today, you can't
[46:58] question that you're alive. If you
[47:00] question that you're alive here tonight,
[47:02] then maybe you're insane.
[47:05] Maybe you lost your mind. Amen. We're
[47:08] alive here tonight. Amen. We're at
[47:10] certain ages. We got certain experiences
[47:13] in our life. Amen. Hallelujah. We
[47:16] understand that. We know that tonight.
[47:18] Amen. Well, that's the same way with
[47:20] being born again. You got to know that
[47:22] you're born again by the spirit of God.
[47:24] You got to know that you given birth to
[47:26] this revealed word of this hour.
[47:29] Hallelujah. Amen.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:33] Glory to God. You know, Brother Brandham
[47:36] talking here in in birth pains, he's
[47:38] saying, you know, a an egg, a a chick
[47:42] that's in the egg. Hallelujah. It knows
[47:44] no other way but to keep pecking and
[47:47] keep pecking and keep pecking until it
[47:49] pecks its way out of that egg. Amen.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the way life comes
[47:54] forth, my brothers and sisters. Amen.
[47:56] Hallelujah. That's not being
[47:58] comfortable. Amen. That I'm in the
[48:00] message. I believe God sent a prophet.
[48:02] And people don't realize. They get under
[48:04] that spirit, under that anointing. Amen.
[48:07] And get complacency under the word.
[48:10] Amen. Under programs, under camp
[48:13] meetings, under all these things planned
[48:15] ahead, not realizing that they got to
[48:17] peck their way out. You got to peck your
[48:20] way out of something. What is that
[48:22] something that you got to peck your way
[48:24] out of? It's it's it's sin. It's
[48:27] unbelief. All of us. Amen. Listen, let
[48:32] me tell you. When when when the birth
[48:35] came to me, when the enlightened came to
[48:38] me, Amen. All I know I was in
[48:42] desperation.
[48:43] Hallelujah. We're going to get to it.
[48:44] But brother said the token, he said once
[48:47] that token came on display and we're
[48:50] going to realize what that token is and
[48:51] what it really means in this hour came
[48:53] on display, I went into desperation.
[48:57] Hallelujah. Oh God. Cuz he realized that
[49:00] something just happened. Something just
[49:02] changed. Amen. At that time and he he
[49:06] went into desperation. Hallelujah. Here
[49:09] he was all these years in Pentecost in
[49:11] the ministry of Pentecost preaching the
[49:14] Pentecostal revelation. But then here
[49:16] come a mighty angel and changed
[49:18] everything. Amen. Hallelujah. He got
[49:22] birth.
[49:23] [Laughter]
[49:25] &gt;&gt; What are you talking about, brother Tim?
[49:29] &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? He's got
[49:32] birth.
[49:34] Oh my.
[49:36] People's minds are so so intertwined.
[49:40] We're preaching on the power of
[49:41] tradition still. Amen. Brother Brandon
[49:45] speaking here. It's the rising of the
[49:46] sun.
[49:48] As Christ was the first one to rise from
[49:52] all the prophets and so forth and all
[49:54] the types in many places. He was the
[49:57] first fruit of those that slept in the
[50:00] bride coming of Christ. You hear what he
[50:03] said? In the bride coming of Christ
[50:07] coming out of the church,
[50:10] there will have to be a sheath waved
[50:13] again in the last days.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh my. He says waving of the
[50:19] sheath. What is a sheath? The first one
[50:24] that come to maturity.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to God.
[50:32] It's like that wheat field. They're at
[50:34] different levels. Amen. And you know how
[50:36] you know how this one gets to this one
[50:38] and this one gets to that one? Because
[50:40] they look at each other. Amen. They
[50:42] follow each other. Amen. Hallelujah.
[50:45] They know where they're going. They're
[50:47] going up. Amen. Glory to God. Amen. The
[50:52] first one that proved it was a wheat.
[50:56] That proved it was a sheath. Hallelujah.
[50:59] I'm sure you see it what I'm talking
[51:02] about. But he says it was waved over the
[51:05] people. I'm sure we see it tonight.
[51:08] Those who have been in the message long
[51:10] enough, those have seen the life of
[51:13] Christ through a prophet in these last
[51:15] days. I'm sure you've seen it. It's not
[51:18] just to tickle your ears or fancy you or
[51:21] get you worked up in some kind of
[51:23] emotion. Amen. Hallelujah. There was
[51:26] there was the example. Amen. in front of
[51:29] our eyes being waved over us. There was
[51:32] the path of life that was being waved
[51:35] over us. There is the way that we must
[51:38] walk. Amen. The bloody footprints were
[51:41] being displayed right before us. Amen. A
[51:44] life. He wasn't just a prophet to to the
[51:48] age. Amen. Hallelujah. But he was an
[51:51] example. He was a wave sheet. He was a
[51:54] life that was going before us. Amen.
[51:57] Hallelujah.
[52:00] Amen.
[52:02] And the first time there will come forth
[52:05] for the bride age for a resurrection out
[52:09] of dark denominationalism
[52:11] will be a message that the full maturity
[52:15] of the word has turned back in its full
[52:19] power and being waved over the people by
[52:22] the same signs and wonders that he did
[52:25] back there. Hallelujah. The same power,
[52:28] my brothers and sisters, to what? Is it
[52:31] just miracles? Just laying hands upon
[52:33] the sick? No. The same power that
[52:36] transforms our lives. Amen. The same
[52:39] power that gives us the new birth.
[52:42] &gt;&gt; That's the miracle in this hour. The
[52:45] transformation of the new birth, being
[52:47] born again. Hallelujah.
[52:51] Amen.
[52:54] Now listen.
[52:56] If Moses, Noah, Abraham, David, and
[53:00] Solomon, Ezekiel, and all the prophets
[53:04] messages,
[53:05] unless it lines up with this word in
[53:09] this age, that it is to manifest in the
[53:12] bride, we have to leave it as the word
[53:16] of God in the past age. We can only move
[53:20] on with anything that is said from the
[53:24] past age if it lines up with the
[53:27] revelation of this age, this bride age.
[53:30] Other words, I believe all the message
[53:31] of brother Brandham is true. Just like I
[53:34] believe all the Bible's true. You
[53:36] believe all the Bible's true.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You believe You believe uh
[53:40] Moses was true. You believe Noah was
[53:43] true. David, all of them were true.
[53:46] Amen. But it but if you look at what can
[53:49] you use Noah's message and preach it
[53:51] today can you use Moses's we can only
[53:55] look back and that's what he's saying
[53:56] here we can only look back in type form
[53:59] if it does not type and does not reflect
[54:03] spiritually the message of this age and
[54:06] this hour we have to leave it.
[54:10] We have to leave it just like the
[54:12] message of the hour. The message of the
[54:14] hour has a Pentecostal message in it.
[54:17] Hallelujah. Amen. That Pentec that
[54:20] Pentecostal message is a different age
[54:24] and we got to leave it.
[54:26] Hallelujah. We got to leave it behind.
[54:29] Now listen,
[54:32] when we have
[54:34] a phone or a computer
[54:38] and every once in a while it needs an
[54:40] upgrade.
[54:42] when it gets an upgrade, if that old
[54:45] technology isn't comparable to the new
[54:47] technology, the upgrade then the
[54:50] computer or the phone, it has to leave
[54:53] that old technology behind and move on
[54:56] with the upgraded technology.
[54:58] It's all the word. Amen. But when the
[55:01] word comes into its age and its time and
[55:04] it's spoken, Amen. and it's revealed and
[55:07] it opens up like that Roman candle. It
[55:10] keeps exploding and it keeps opening up.
[55:13] This is the same letter. It's the same
[55:15] written word that we're feeding off of.
[55:17] But the spirit is giving it life.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see what it says? It's giving
[55:22] it life. When it What is life? Life is a
[55:25] continuing manifestation and growth.
[55:29] Amen. It it unfolds. It's like eternal
[55:32] life. It grows. It grows. It doesn't
[55:35] stop. Amen. Life continues.
[55:39] Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[55:42] The word has marched on to the fullness
[55:45] of truth. And now it is time we got
[55:49] Christ himself in manifestation
[55:53] and manifest in what he had in his mind
[55:55] before the foundation of the world. That
[55:57] God and man will become one and the word
[56:00] will become flesh again. Amen. Amen. And
[56:04] he knew that this day, hallelujah, we
[56:07] will be given birth to the fullness of
[56:09] the word.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not in part anymore,
[56:13] &gt;&gt; but the fullness of the word.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; The fullness of Christ. Amen. Has been
[56:18] given to us. Amen. And has been waved
[56:21] over us. Hallelujah. Glory to God. We
[56:24] don't even realize how powerful that is
[56:26] that this prophet was so anointed and
[56:30] brought through and fulfilling the word
[56:32] of God for these last days and waved
[56:34] over us. That that that waving of that
[56:38] prophet of that first one coming to
[56:40] maturity. You know that effect is still
[56:43] here tonight.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; It's in the room tonight. That same Holy
[56:47] Ghost is here tonight. Amen. That was
[56:51] waving back then. We just look at a man.
[56:54] I know that's what you're thinking in
[56:55] your mind. You just look at a man. But
[56:57] it's the Holy Ghost. It's the word of
[56:59] God being manifested in flesh back then
[57:02] waving over the people. Amen. It was
[57:04] Christ in the prophet saying, "Here I
[57:06] am." Hallelujah. Here's the progression
[57:08] of me. Hallelujah. Here I am moving on
[57:12] step by step by step right
[57:14] &gt;&gt; through the prophet's message.
[57:16] Hallelujah.
[57:18] Amen. And we need to recognize where the
[57:21] prophet went.
[57:24] We have to look at where he went. And
[57:27] it's all through the Bible. They always
[57:29] look Amen. where the word was going. And
[57:33] we must recognize by faith. Like Elijah,
[57:37] if you see me going, hallelujah to
[57:39] Elisha. If you see me going, if you
[57:41] catch the revelation, then I'll give you
[57:43] a double portion
[57:45] &gt;&gt; of my spirit.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we have to see where this faith
[57:49] and where the Lord was leading and where
[57:52] it was going. And that's the same thing
[57:54] we follow today
[57:56] &gt;&gt; in our own personal lives.
[57:59] Forget about portions and portions of
[58:02] faith and you know uh our callings, our
[58:06] gifts. This is just a gift to preach.
[58:08] Amen. I have to have a personal walk
[58:09] with Jesus Christ. I have to produce
[58:11] that word just like any one of you.
[58:14] Hallelujah. and be born again, you know,
[58:18] doesn't make me born again because I
[58:20] preach the gospel. No, there's too much
[58:23] in the word of God, amen, that says, you
[58:25] know, about false preachers and false
[58:27] this and false that, false anointed
[58:28] ones. Even be anointed
[58:31] doesn't matter. Being anointed, I know
[58:33] what I'm saying because I know where I
[58:34] stand in my experience. It's not that
[58:37] all these things deceive the people from
[58:39] recognizing the word of God. Satan puts
[58:42] a smoke screen. So many spo smoke smokec
[58:45] screens and so many tools of deception
[58:48] over the people taking the same word of
[58:51] God. Did he do that to Eve? Took the
[58:54] same word of God.
[58:57] Same message.
[58:59] Hallelujah.
[59:00] The prophet was trying to show us that
[59:03] our experience in this hour and by the
[59:06] opening of the seventh seal should be
[59:08] the seed, the weektime experience.
[59:12] Hallelujah.
[59:14] Where the fullness of the word made
[59:17] flesh, being born again by the
[59:19] experience after 1963
[59:23] is with the seventh seal himself.
[59:27] Hallelujah.
[59:30] Glory to God. I don't want to get ahead
[59:31] of myself because I want to lay some
[59:34] things out and explain it a little.
[59:36] experience the word in full capacity
[59:40] in all fulfillment of what has been
[59:44] promised when Christ lives in his bride.
[59:47] This is the hour of total deliverance
[59:49] where the sons,
[59:51] the sons of God, Amen. And the son of
[59:55] man is setting his people free indeed.
[59:59] Where the sons and daughters of God can
[1:00:02] come into full potential of who they
[1:00:04] are. It's no more in part, but it's
[1:00:07] total completion of our experience.
[1:00:11] As Paul said, it's not I that live, but
[1:00:15] now it's Christ that liveth through me.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to God. But it's
[1:00:22] Christ that lives in me, experiencing
[1:00:25] that God is walking in us, living in us,
[1:00:28] speaking through us, expressing his
[1:00:31] characteristics in us like no other age.
[1:00:33] My brothers and sisters, hallelujah. We
[1:00:36] look at the prophet and we see his life.
[1:00:39] Now, don't look at his ministry. Look at
[1:00:42] his life. That's why God allowed him to
[1:00:45] testify and speak so much of his
[1:00:48] personal life on the tapes. And I know
[1:00:50] people take that and they misinterpret
[1:00:53] everything. Amen. But when you see that
[1:00:56] life that he manifested, Amen. that
[1:00:59] Christ was manifesting him on on the job
[1:01:03] outside of church hunting. Amen. Doing
[1:01:07] what he's doing, getting together with
[1:01:09] people, fellowshipping, dinners, all
[1:01:12] these things. Amen. Christ was always
[1:01:14] there manifesting himself. Amen.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, he was.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. When somebody's born
[1:01:21] again, hallelujah. All I know is I want
[1:01:23] to talk about the word. I don't I I mean
[1:01:25] I don't want to I don't want to, you
[1:01:27] know, come to your place and just word
[1:01:29] all night long. Amen. Those who know me
[1:01:32] and come over. Amen. Hallelujah. I'll
[1:01:34] talk about this. I'll talk about that. I
[1:01:36] like to enjoy our company and our
[1:01:38] fellowship. But man, if that word don't
[1:01:40] come, Hallelujah. It's going to come.
[1:01:45] It's going to come because I'm going to
[1:01:47] bring it. Hallelujah. Amen. We got to
[1:01:50] allow him to come in. Amen. We got to
[1:01:52] bring him on the scene. Amen. Amen. We
[1:01:55] want him in our fellowship. Amen. We
[1:01:57] want him in our homes. Amen. We want him
[1:01:59] in our speaking and our talking.
[1:02:00] Hallelujah. We want to experience him to
[1:02:03] the fullness that he has for us in this
[1:02:06] hour. Amen.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; Glory. That's what the birth does in
[1:02:09] this hour. Amen. It takes over and
[1:02:11] possesses the life. Amen. Like I was uh
[1:02:14] trying to preach there on on Friday
[1:02:16] there, praying without ceasing. Amen.
[1:02:18] The thoughts of God. Amen. Amen. We got
[1:02:21] the mind of Christ. Amen. We've been
[1:02:24] born again with the mind of Christ.
[1:02:26] Amen. Every thought that I get is a
[1:02:28] prayer. If I think about you, I'm
[1:02:31] praying about you. Amen. That's the Holy
[1:02:33] Ghost in us. Amen.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:02:38] You We look in the tapes and we see how
[1:02:40] real.
[1:02:41] Is that true?
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; We see how real God became to the
[1:02:46] prophet. We see how real his life was
[1:02:50] manifesting in the prophet's life. If
[1:02:53] you listen to those tapes and you don't
[1:02:55] see that
[1:02:56] just like he said, if you don't see
[1:02:58] Christ in all the Bible, go back and
[1:03:00] read it again. Get on your knees and
[1:03:02] pray. Hallelujah.
[1:03:05] Amen. I wonder about people if they're
[1:03:08] born again or they're still born.
[1:03:13] Hallelujah.
[1:03:16] Amen. The Holy Ghost has been given for
[1:03:19] many reasons. To call you out of the
[1:03:21] world, bring you into a new birth, which
[1:03:24] brings you into the kingdom of God and
[1:03:26] allows you to see God
[1:03:29] and your purpose.
[1:03:31] Hallelujah.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; It will cause you to see and recognize
[1:03:36] God
[1:03:38] and your purpose.
[1:03:42] Is somebody listening to me?
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen. I
[1:03:49] should have that sign up here. Amen.
[1:03:51] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:03:54] Amen. Second, boy. You know I'm on your
[1:03:56] side.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Sometimes the devil
[1:04:01] puts in a thing like this and he he
[1:04:02] attacks me all the time up here. He's
[1:04:04] throwing all kinds of thoughts at me up
[1:04:06] here. Amen. To try to divert my thought.
[1:04:08] Amen. But because he knows somebody's
[1:04:10] going to give it blessed. Amen.
[1:04:12] Hallelujah. So when I hear amen, you're
[1:04:13] saying, "Boy, sick them." Keep sick
[1:04:15] them, boy. Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to
[1:04:18] God. Just keep saying amen until amen
[1:04:21] becomes amen in you. Until amen blesses
[1:04:23] the amen. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Every church age produces a birth
[1:04:28] according to the portion of the word
[1:04:30] that has been revealed to them.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; And when that age is done, now listen,
[1:04:35] that particular birth was not available
[1:04:39] anymore.
[1:04:41] Hallelujah.
[1:04:43] Amen. They had to wait for the word to
[1:04:46] be revealed for the age coming.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; They are now into I into into receiving
[1:04:53] the new birth then. Hallelujah. Think
[1:04:57] about it my brothers and sisters. Glory
[1:04:59] to God. People in this message I'm going
[1:05:01] to just say things plain. People in this
[1:05:03] message believing by and having
[1:05:06] experiences.
[1:05:08] Oh yes.
[1:05:10] Amen, brother Brandham. So you can be
[1:05:11] anointed every day of your life
[1:05:14] and have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:16] every day of your life and still go to
[1:05:18] hell. Why?
[1:05:20] Because they're not born again of the
[1:05:23] word for their age.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; People sitting under this message for
[1:05:28] many, many years. Amen. And not born
[1:05:31] again by this opening of this seven seal
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; revelation.
[1:05:37] Is it something that you, oh, I'm going
[1:05:38] to get the seal book and I'm going to
[1:05:40] read it and then I'm going to be born
[1:05:41] again. No,
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; it's the living God, Christ, when he
[1:05:46] comes and reveals to you the word for
[1:05:48] this day, this age that we're living in.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; He had to do the same thing to the
[1:05:54] prophet,
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; the changing of the age, the changing of
[1:05:59] the dispensation.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. people's experience coming to
[1:06:07] church listening to same preaching
[1:06:09] listening to the tapes but living in a
[1:06:12] past age in their experience in their
[1:06:16] spirit in their revelation.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; That's why you need preachers. Amen.
[1:06:24] that God will will will give them the
[1:06:26] revelation of this hour to speak the
[1:06:29] truth to shake up things
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; so that if you're that chicken in there
[1:06:33] and you haven't come out of your egg
[1:06:35] yet. I don't care how many years God
[1:06:38] don't deal with your years
[1:06:42] in that egg you got a peck.
[1:06:45] A birth is a fight. A birth is between
[1:06:47] life and death. A birth is a struggle.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; It always is.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. When somebody gets pregnant,
[1:06:55] from the time that they get pregnant to
[1:06:57] the time that they deliver, they're in
[1:06:59] travail. Hallelujah.
[1:07:02] That some something is being born inside
[1:07:05] of them. Something is growing inside of
[1:07:07] them. Things are changing in their body.
[1:07:09] Their molecules are changing. Their
[1:07:11] blood is changing. Amen. Everything is
[1:07:14] changing inside of them. Amen. There's a
[1:07:16] birth taking place.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that that that mother wants
[1:07:21] that child to grow. Amen. Grow. So that
[1:07:25] one day it will give birth to it. It
[1:07:27] will see the life that was producing
[1:07:29] inside of her.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Oh more and more of God.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I was I was I believe that
[1:07:39] God gave me the birth and I was moving
[1:07:41] for about two years and I went to a
[1:07:43] meeting. God led me to a meeting. Amen.
[1:07:45] Hallelujah. in Michigan and I was there
[1:07:48] was about I don't know thousand people
[1:07:49] or whatever was there and I was called
[1:07:51] out from way in the back and this
[1:07:54] minister was at the platform and he
[1:07:57] walked right over through all the people
[1:07:59] and he says brother I believe that God
[1:08:04] the spirit of God led me right to you.
[1:08:07] Hallelujah. Just like the Holy Ghost
[1:08:10] Amen and and Simon and Anna led them
[1:08:13] right to the Christ. Amen. The Holy
[1:08:16] Ghost led me right to you. And he and he
[1:08:19] says he says one thing and I I God was
[1:08:22] moving in my life. God w I was I was
[1:08:25] seeing God. I didn't understand
[1:08:26] everything but I knew that change was
[1:08:28] happening in my life. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:08:31] I didn't know if I was born again or
[1:08:33] not, but I know what happened to me was
[1:08:35] different. That I was changed. My
[1:08:38] desires, my heart, everything was
[1:08:40] changed. Amen. I wanted God. Amen. And
[1:08:44] he said a few things and prophesied a
[1:08:45] few things over my life which are coming
[1:08:47] to pass now. Amen. But one of the things
[1:08:50] I want to point out, Amen. He said,
[1:08:53] "You're desiring more of God."
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're desiring more of God.
[1:09:02] Listen, when this birth strikes you and
[1:09:04] it connects with you, I don't care what
[1:09:07] you go through. I don't care what
[1:09:10] experience you have with God. There's
[1:09:12] always going to be a testimony in your
[1:09:14] spirit that you want more of God.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. More. 34 years here today. Amen.
[1:09:23] And I want more of God.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; I want more of this truth that I'm
[1:09:28] preaching to open up and reveal and
[1:09:30] manifest in my life.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; That never stopped. I've been up and
[1:09:35] I've been down. I've been in and I've
[1:09:38] been out. But oh God, this has been
[1:09:41] faithful all the time. Amen. And you can
[1:09:44] realize it has nothing to do with your
[1:09:46] flesh. More of God. The new birth brings
[1:09:50] more of God. More and more and more of
[1:09:54] God. People are dying. Why are you
[1:09:57] dying?
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Why are people dying? We We got the word
[1:10:01] of life.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; We got to live in Christ right before
[1:10:04] us.
[1:10:07] Hallelujah.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:14] Born again.
[1:10:16] Let us move on so we can make sense of
[1:10:19] this.
[1:10:22] The seed has to rot and be buried to
[1:10:25] bring forth new life.
[1:10:28] So does teachings and doctrines from the
[1:10:31] past age.
[1:10:33] Hallelujah.
[1:10:34] Do you know do you realize that when you
[1:10:37] listen to the prophet's message
[1:10:40] that you are actually listening to
[1:10:42] teachings,
[1:10:44] doctrines, opinions from a past age in
[1:10:47] there
[1:10:49] and and and the present age, the bride
[1:10:51] age, the capstone age. Do you realize
[1:10:53] that?
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; If you've been born again by the spirit
[1:10:56] of God,
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; you will recognize that by the spirit of
[1:10:59] God. Not because I say it to you and you
[1:11:02] can understand what I'm saying. You can
[1:11:05] shake your head to the preacher all the
[1:11:06] time and every single preacher that
[1:11:07] comes up here and walk out of here and
[1:11:09] don't know what what you're talking
[1:11:10] about or what what understanding.
[1:11:13] But it's true. When the spirit of God
[1:11:16] comes, it filters.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; It's still the word of God, but it
[1:11:20] filters
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; because why? It has. The word of God has
[1:11:25] been spoken for this age and that age
[1:11:27] has to fulfill. God spoke to Noah. I'm
[1:11:30] trying to make it as simple as possible.
[1:11:32] God spoke to Noah and said, "Build an
[1:11:33] ark. There's a flood coming." That was
[1:11:36] the revealed word for that day.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; And Noah caught that revelation and he
[1:11:43] went and built an ark. He was anointed
[1:11:45] to build the ark.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Hallelujah. And a word's been
[1:11:50] spoken in this day. Hallelujah. and and
[1:11:53] and we're anointed for that word to be
[1:11:58] manifested.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So in this message, you
[1:12:04] can see, listen, teachings, traditions
[1:12:08] of men that keep people from moving
[1:12:10] forward to receiving the revealed word
[1:12:13] for their day. And a lot of people are
[1:12:16] born again by an experience from a past
[1:12:18] age. Not the age that they're living in,
[1:12:22] not the revealed word for this day in
[1:12:25] his fullness was available. That was
[1:12:27] incorruptible seed birth back there.
[1:12:31] Think about it. Incorruptible birth
[1:12:35] without this seven seal revelation being
[1:12:38] revealed to you.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is an incorruptible birth in
[1:12:43] this hour. Hallelujah. Amen. Now listen.
[1:12:48] Hallelujah.
[1:12:50] They are living in when the word opened
[1:12:54] up in 1963.
[1:12:57] Hallelujah. The token life in its
[1:12:59] fullness was available. Now I know you
[1:13:03] say, "Oh, I know the seals were
[1:13:05] breaking. I know the serpent seed. I
[1:13:08] know the church ages were be before 63."
[1:13:11] But you need to recognize that was all a
[1:13:14] process of God moving his word forward.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; But then came the opening of the seals.
[1:13:20] And I'm going to prove it to you by
[1:13:21] brother Brandham. Amen. That the the
[1:13:24] token was not. We must have the token
[1:13:27] today.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the token was not available
[1:13:32] then.
[1:13:33] through all those years of the church
[1:13:35] ages, the serpent seed, all these
[1:13:38] things, the token was not available.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Right? If you know your message,
[1:13:44] hallelujah, then you know what I'm
[1:13:46] talking about.
[1:13:48] Hallelujah.
[1:13:50] But not today. Have it today is
[1:13:53] corruptible seed. God's truth was moving
[1:13:55] forward into per perfect faith. people
[1:13:58] still feeding off of messages before 63
[1:14:01] and believing it's enough today.
[1:14:04] Oh, I you know
[1:14:08] it's very very very you know a born
[1:14:10] again believer
[1:14:12] that's born again by the spirit has come
[1:14:14] to the full maturity can feed off of
[1:14:17] before 63 and get blessed.
[1:14:21] Okay. I know this this when every time
[1:14:26] anyone bruth
[1:14:29] and any kind of seems like any kind of
[1:14:31] change, it's hard on the people because
[1:14:34] people hate change. Whether you believe
[1:14:36] it or not, spiritually speaking,
[1:14:39] religiously speaking, you get content of
[1:14:42] where you're at and what you believe.
[1:14:44] And if the Holy Spirit or somebody comes
[1:14:47] and starts stirring that up in your
[1:14:49] minds,
[1:14:51] it stirs up a spiritual warfare. It
[1:14:54] always does. And then you start
[1:14:56] thinking, "Wow, I've been through it,
[1:14:57] too. Was that that is that right?" But I
[1:15:01] found that every time that something was
[1:15:03] ministered and preached, hallelujah, and
[1:15:06] it stirred my mind, it stirred up my
[1:15:08] belief, what I thought I was believing,
[1:15:10] and it stirred it up. Of course, I go
[1:15:13] back and I study. Of course, I go back
[1:15:14] and I pray, but I always found that God
[1:15:17] was taking me higher. Hallelujah. It's
[1:15:20] like that Roman candle. Boom. Truth
[1:15:21] comes. What? What? What's that
[1:15:22] denominational spirit? You take a truth
[1:15:25] and you stay there. Truth Truth doesn't
[1:15:28] stay. God's truth keeps marching on. It
[1:15:31] goes up. It goes up. It goes up.
[1:15:34] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:15:37] So in saying that, feeding off the
[1:15:40] message before 63 and believing it's
[1:15:42] enough today. Now what do I mean by
[1:15:45] feeding off of it? They could be
[1:15:46] listening to 63 and on.
[1:15:49] They could be, but in their experience,
[1:15:54] in their revelation,
[1:15:56] their faith is still back there before
[1:15:59] the changing of the age.
[1:16:04] Amen. It's enough today. But it's after
[1:16:06] 63 the token life was available. The new
[1:16:09] birth in the fullness of the word. The
[1:16:11] message is in two parts. Coming out and
[1:16:14] going in.
[1:16:16] The token was not available until the
[1:16:19] evening time. Okay. Now, brother
[1:16:22] Brandham said the evening time of his
[1:16:24] message, which is at what? The end of
[1:16:26] his message.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, listen here. End time.
[1:16:32] evening time of the message or the end
[1:16:34] of the message. Brother Brandham said
[1:16:35] since the seven seals opening all the
[1:16:39] messages from the time on was the token
[1:16:43] coming available to the bride of Jesus
[1:16:45] Christ.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; We can see amen when the mighty angel
[1:16:49] came down.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Oh God. Amen. The dispensation changed.
[1:16:55] Brother Brandham's amen commission
[1:16:57] started changing there as being the
[1:17:00] seventh church age messenger amen now
[1:17:03] the mighty angel was here on earth and
[1:17:05] all the message after that was
[1:17:07] displaying Christ is the mystery of God
[1:17:10] revealed greater than Solomon is here
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; we can see a prophet decreasing
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; hallelujah that wasn't a prophet
[1:17:18] speaking those things revealing those
[1:17:21] things after 63 all I see was a prophet
[1:17:25] decreasing and the mighty angel Jesus
[1:17:27] Christ coming into plain view.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. The token coming available for the
[1:17:37] bride that started a new age for a new
[1:17:41] birth of the bride. She can only be born
[1:17:45] by the opening of the seven seals. That
[1:17:47] is the life of Christ being born in her
[1:17:50] to fulfill all that was spoken of her
[1:17:54] being one with him. Now listen, that's
[1:17:58] when brother Brandham said,
[1:18:02] think about it. All the messages that he
[1:18:04] preached before 63.
[1:18:08] And here he comes. When this came, these
[1:18:11] seven seals open, the mighty angel came
[1:18:13] down. Now, brother Brandham said, "This
[1:18:16] is when the Bible became a new Bible to
[1:18:19] me.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; This is when everything became new to
[1:18:21] me." What was he saying, my brothers and
[1:18:23] sisters? Hallelujah. Amen. He knew he
[1:18:27] gave birth
[1:18:30] to the revealed word of the hour,
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; the time he was living in.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:37] Amen.
[1:18:38] Now, he moved into the bride ministry.
[1:18:41] Amen. the same ministry that is
[1:18:44] manifesting here tonight. Hallelujah.
[1:18:47] Glory to God. It wasn't him anymore. The
[1:18:50] seven church age prophet. Amen. That
[1:18:53] dispensation had changed. That that
[1:18:56] office was done away with. Amen. Now it
[1:18:59] was Christ. Amen. Christ living in his
[1:19:02] tabernacle coming into the fullness of
[1:19:04] the word manifesting. Amen. Amen. And
[1:19:08] here comes a prophet now changing and
[1:19:10] transforming into the bride of Jesus
[1:19:12] Christ. Amen.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Coming to manifest. Hey, I'm the wave
[1:19:16] sheep bride in the future. Amen. It's
[1:19:20] going to be the same Christ. The same
[1:19:22] God in me is going to be manifested in
[1:19:24] you now.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:29] Glory to God. Hallelujah. Amen. A new
[1:19:32] Bible. He says everything changed.
[1:19:35] He said it.
[1:19:37] Everything that he understood from
[1:19:39] before changed. Do you realize he said
[1:19:43] that?
[1:19:45] Hallelujah.
[1:19:47] Brother Brandham speaking here.
[1:19:48] Desperations. Now watch. What's coming
[1:19:51] after those seven seals? Think about it.
[1:19:56] What's coming after those seven seals?
[1:19:58] The uniting of the people. The uniting
[1:20:01] signs of the red lights flashings of the
[1:20:04] last days. The signs of women getting
[1:20:06] prettier and men that would they would
[1:20:09] do all these signs of the Holy Spirit
[1:20:12] leading up then come right back here to
[1:20:15] the capping off of all those messages.
[1:20:19] Desperation go look it up for yourself.
[1:20:21] All those messages since the seven seal
[1:20:25] is capping off of this one thing
[1:20:28] the token.
[1:20:32] Hallelujah.
[1:20:34] capping off this one thing of all these
[1:20:36] messages. What did brother Madam say
[1:20:39] outside of the seven seals? What did he
[1:20:42] say that he knew that it was direct from
[1:20:45] God? The token.
[1:20:48] The token message. He said the token
[1:20:51] message changed everything for him. The
[1:20:53] token message put him in desperation.
[1:20:56] Hallelujah.
[1:20:57] In all things. Amen.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. The token birth could only
[1:21:04] come in the evening time. It is the
[1:21:06] token age we are living in. And brother
[1:21:09] Brandham says that that we're living in
[1:21:11] after the opening of the seven seals.
[1:21:14] Then the blood was a token for our
[1:21:16] identification. The blood is the token
[1:21:18] and the token must be applied or the
[1:21:21] covenant is not in effect. If this
[1:21:25] token, this blood is not applied to our
[1:21:28] lives, the covenant
[1:21:31] is not into effect.
[1:21:34] Think about it. You talk about
[1:21:36] desperation.
[1:21:37] Hallelujah.
[1:21:39] Brother Tim, are you in desperate
[1:21:41] always?
[1:21:42] More of God. More of God. You make
[1:21:46] mistakes, Brother Tim. Yes. But more of
[1:21:48] God. You fall. You have tests. You have
[1:21:50] trials. You fail God. But more of God.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:56] More of God. Amen.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I got a revelation that
[1:22:01] this flesh will not inherit the kingdom
[1:22:04] of God. Amen.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So what what is making me
[1:22:10] see Jesus Christ in the revealed word?
[1:22:12] What is making me see the kingdom of
[1:22:14] God? What has caused me to enter into
[1:22:16] the kingdom of God? It's not this flesh.
[1:22:20] It's the attribute, the new birth inside
[1:22:23] of me.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; That's what changes everything for a
[1:22:26] believer.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; That's what brings your faith to another
[1:22:29] level of overcoming in this hour.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:22:36] Still, my God, my brothers and sisters,
[1:22:39] healing is healing. I know that. I need
[1:22:41] healing. Everybody needs healing. Amen.
[1:22:43] I'm grown just like you. But oh God,
[1:22:46] come into a place. We still want to lay
[1:22:48] hands on people. We still want to do
[1:22:50] these things. We still have testimonies
[1:22:53] of a past age. Amen.
[1:22:57] Speaking how you speak about the word
[1:23:00] will either identify you in this age or
[1:23:02] a past age. You know, some people in
[1:23:04] this message when they speak about the
[1:23:06] word, the Bible, they're preaching a
[1:23:10] Luther's message. They're speaking a
[1:23:13] Luther's understanding or Wesley
[1:23:14] understanding, but most of the people
[1:23:17] that have not been born again. Amen. By
[1:23:20] this token, this word are preaching and
[1:23:23] speaking a Pentecostal message. I've sit
[1:23:25] there amongst people and fellowship with
[1:23:28] them. I fellowship with a lot of you
[1:23:30] under the reveal word of the hour, but I
[1:23:32] fellowship with people. And you sit
[1:23:34] there and you talk with them.
[1:23:37] You see, we're inter interdimensional.
[1:23:42] The same person that you're seeing here,
[1:23:44] and I hope it's you, too, is in heaven,
[1:23:46] too. We're in different dimensions at
[1:23:49] the same time here by the revelation, by
[1:23:51] the new birth. Hallelujah. I can sit
[1:23:54] there and talk with some. That's what
[1:23:55] brother Brandon meant. I know people
[1:23:57] take it out of context. People have no
[1:24:00] understanding of it. They think they
[1:24:02] think they work a discernment up. They
[1:24:04] work up something. No, it's by the
[1:24:06] spirit.
[1:24:08] It's by the discerning of the word. The
[1:24:09] Bible says the word of God is quicker
[1:24:11] and sharper than a two-edged sword. So
[1:24:13] when anybody's speaking the word, you'll
[1:24:16] know what they're speaking if you got
[1:24:18] that same spirit inside of you. It's the
[1:24:21] same fellowship. Maybe on different
[1:24:23] levels, but the same fellowship.
[1:24:26] Hallelujah. People preach the word to me
[1:24:28] all the time on on Facebook and all that
[1:24:31] stuff in this message. And I go, "My
[1:24:33] God, that's Pentecostal. They haven't
[1:24:35] caught the revelation of this." And next
[1:24:37] thing you know, they start sending me
[1:24:39] stuff from a Pentecostal church in this
[1:24:41] message.
[1:24:44] It has to manifest.
[1:24:47] Every seed must bring forth of his own
[1:24:49] kind.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:52] Amen. We got to know where we're
[1:24:54] standing and where we're at. Each and
[1:24:56] every one of us as individuals. God
[1:24:58] ain't going to bring my wife because
[1:24:59] she's my wife
[1:25:02] or husband because it's your husband.
[1:25:03] No, you're all going individually.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; God just allowed us to be down here
[1:25:07] because of the flesh and grow
[1:25:10] together in Christ together. But we're
[1:25:12] individuals. Gentiles are always
[1:25:14] individuals. Amen. Hallelujah. Let me
[1:25:17] move on here. Hallelujah. The blood must
[1:25:19] be applied or the covenant is not
[1:25:21] effect. The lamb was killed in the
[1:25:23] evening time. You get it? This is
[1:25:25] brother Brandon speaking here. The token
[1:25:27] never came into existence until the
[1:25:30] evening time until the end of his
[1:25:32] message.
[1:25:36] Oh hallelujah. But we get complacency.
[1:25:40] Now listen spiritually here.
[1:25:43] complacency.
[1:25:44] When deeply entrenched traditions can
[1:25:48] lead
[1:25:50] to complacency where people become so
[1:25:53] accustom
[1:25:55] to exist in methods that they lack the
[1:25:58] time or the energy or consider
[1:26:03] alternatives.
[1:26:06] And that's what this revelation is all
[1:26:07] about when it opens up to you.
[1:26:10] You want to grow in this revelation, in
[1:26:12] this word. Hallelujah. Can't be
[1:26:14] complacency.
[1:26:16] Hallelujah.
[1:26:19] It's difficult to introduce new truth
[1:26:22] into communities bound by traditions
[1:26:25] because traditions provides a sense of
[1:26:28] comfort.
[1:26:30] Oh my.
[1:26:32] I I know the word the way I know the
[1:26:33] word. I believe the message the way I
[1:26:35] believe the message, the way God reveals
[1:26:37] it to me.
[1:26:39] Don't don't shake that comfort up. Don't
[1:26:42] Don't try to shake, you know, my faith
[1:26:46] here tonight that I'm not born again or
[1:26:47] I'm born again. I'm not doing none of
[1:26:49] that.
[1:26:51] That's between you and God.
[1:26:56] and challenge them them to feel like a
[1:26:59] threat to one's psycho psychological
[1:27:02] well-being
[1:27:04] and a disturbance in the statue of your
[1:27:07] status quo.
[1:27:11] Hallelujah. New truths. You see, you
[1:27:15] can't have a new reality, my brothers
[1:27:17] and sisters, with an old mentality. And
[1:27:20] that's the problem. You can't you can't
[1:27:24] see a new age looking back and having
[1:27:26] your mentality not moving with the
[1:27:29] changes of truth. It's always opening up
[1:27:32] and revealing itself. That's why every
[1:27:36] generation fails to move forward
[1:27:39] with truth.
[1:27:41] Just because you're here in 2025
[1:27:45] and we look at the message. Hallelujah.
[1:27:50] It doesn't mean we're moving forward in
[1:27:53] the new age.
[1:27:57] Hallelujah.
[1:27:59] Moving forward with truth. They take it
[1:28:02] for their time and it becomes a reality
[1:28:04] and forms an old mentality.
[1:28:07] You know, I had to break out of in 34
[1:28:11] years, my brothers and sisters. I can go
[1:28:13] back and give you all the experiences
[1:28:15] that I've had and the moving of God in
[1:28:18] my life and the supernatural in my life.
[1:28:21] But, you know, all that time God was
[1:28:23] leading me on and I had to break out of
[1:28:25] old mentalities, break out of, you know,
[1:28:27] truths that I I that was revealed to me
[1:28:29] then. I had to break out of it and let
[1:28:33] it break open and expand.
[1:28:37] I'm not saying deny truth,
[1:28:41] reject truth, but truth opens up. Truth
[1:28:45] constantly reveals itself, unfolds
[1:28:48] itself constantly.
[1:28:50] That's how a baby grows into a human, to
[1:28:54] an adult. Amen. The cells break. They
[1:28:58] they they constantly re regenerate the
[1:29:01] cells. They constantly renew themselves
[1:29:03] all the time. And that's what God's
[1:29:05] truth always does. In order for us to
[1:29:07] grow spiritually into this fullness of
[1:29:10] the word in this hour, truth has to
[1:29:12] constantly be breaking and breaking and
[1:29:14] breaking. But I'm I I'm sorry to say, my
[1:29:17] brothers and sisters, what the problem
[1:29:19] is is that people listen to the tapes
[1:29:21] and listen to the messages and they
[1:29:24] receive truth.
[1:29:26] Yes, they receive truth,
[1:29:29] but they stay right there in that truth
[1:29:31] and they take that truth and they don't
[1:29:33] even realize they're forming a
[1:29:36] complacency around that truth, a
[1:29:38] denominational spirit around that truth.
[1:29:40] Amen.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; If you don't allow God's spirit to march
[1:29:43] on and for truth to move on in your life
[1:29:46] and continue to reveal itself inside of
[1:29:48] you so that you can grow spiritually.
[1:29:52] You don't realize that you denominated
[1:29:54] and you died.
[1:29:57] Hallelujah.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; I see that in the prophet's life.
[1:30:02] I see a progression of faith.
[1:30:05] Amen. Things that he thought over here
[1:30:07] were different over here. Things he said
[1:30:09] over here, he said different over here.
[1:30:12] Things that he thought over here were
[1:30:14] different over here. What is that?
[1:30:18] A progression of faith.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; I know some people out there who left
[1:30:22] the message and all that said he was
[1:30:23] wrong. He's off. No, that's not what it
[1:30:26] is. It's a progression of faith
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; of of the spirit of God moving on. Truth
[1:30:30] marks and on. Hallelujah. God don't
[1:30:33] reveal everything to his prophets all
[1:30:34] the time. He didn't see everything.
[1:30:36] Amen. He's seen it over time as God led
[1:30:39] him through the stages of truth. Amen.
[1:30:42] Hallelujah. I can't see that quarter
[1:30:45] two. There's a there's a kind of like a
[1:30:48] blinding light there now.
[1:30:51] Amen.
[1:30:53] Now, notice, let me get a few things
[1:30:55] here and then we'll just continue the
[1:30:58] next time I'm up. Now notice
[1:31:01] in a seed birth the old seed must die
[1:31:05] before the new one can be born. So
[1:31:08] therefore death is a hard any time. So
[1:31:11] it's painful. It's distressful. That's
[1:31:14] what I'm talking about here.
[1:31:16] Birth is the same because you're
[1:31:18] bringing life into the world and it's
[1:31:20] painful. And that's the reason it is so
[1:31:23] hard for those Pharisees to understand
[1:31:26] our Lord Jesus Christ because they were
[1:31:29] under the law. Now listen. Now listen.
[1:31:33] Hallelujah. And the law was the word of
[1:31:37] God in seed form.
[1:31:40] Are we still listening?
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But when the word was made
[1:31:46] flesh, it become not law but grace.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Not law but grace.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; And people are still in this message
[1:31:57] living under law.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; And producing a legalistic life, a
[1:32:03] legalistic spirit.
[1:32:06] taking the same quotes,
[1:32:10] claiming to believe the same prophet,
[1:32:12] the same Bible, and the same Jesus
[1:32:13] Christ as you. Now listen.
[1:32:18] Hallelujah. Now grace and law cannot
[1:32:21] exist at the same time. Do we understand
[1:32:24] that
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; gra law and grace cannot exist in your
[1:32:28] life at the same time? Law might come
[1:32:31] into your life as a school master. Amen.
[1:32:33] Amen. But then when grace comes in that
[1:32:36] area of your life that that grows and
[1:32:39] matures you, law has to go.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:45] All law has to go out of our lives.
[1:32:48] Amen. That's going to produce that body
[1:32:51] change in us. That rapture, that perfect
[1:32:53] faith, that perfect realization cannot
[1:32:56] come, these things cannot come with law
[1:32:59] in our lives.
[1:33:01] Now, grace and law cannot exist at the
[1:33:03] same time. He's talking cuz grace is so
[1:33:06] far above law that law is not even in
[1:33:10] the picture.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; Law is not even in this token. This life
[1:33:16] of Jesus Christ. Amen. Jesus fulfilled
[1:33:20] the law. He came and fulfilled the law.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; And we are complete in Jesus Christ.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He by his spirit, by his
[1:33:31] life, now he leads us and guide us.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; If you want to say he's our law, that
[1:33:40] satisfies your mind and doesn't stir you
[1:33:42] up too much, then say it. And therefore,
[1:33:45] it's so hard for the Pharisees to die to
[1:33:48] their law so that grace could be born.
[1:33:51] That grace can be born, but it must go.
[1:33:56] He's saying the law must go. The two
[1:33:58] laws cannot exist at the same time.
[1:34:00] There cannot be a law that says that you
[1:34:03] can run this way
[1:34:05] then sending a message the other way.
[1:34:09] And that's what law does between law and
[1:34:12] grace. Law tells you in the message
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; your your interpretation, your
[1:34:17] understanding, it tells you to go this
[1:34:19] way in your life and in your walk. But
[1:34:21] then grace tells you to go this way and
[1:34:24] move in a different direction. the same
[1:34:27] message, the same written word
[1:34:30] being interpreted by the law or by
[1:34:33] grace.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; We know that the old seed must die
[1:34:43] before the new seed can come out. The
[1:34:46] old seed must rot. Absolutely. Not die
[1:34:49] only, but rot after it's dead. We heard
[1:34:53] it a few weeks ago, right? the seed rot.
[1:34:56] My brothers and sisters, not just die
[1:34:58] out to yourself, but those
[1:35:00] understandings and those interpretations
[1:35:02] that you had even as you're growing in
[1:35:05] the message, they got to rot.
[1:35:09] You can't bring them with you. You know,
[1:35:11] like in the Bible, they bring they bring
[1:35:13] all their their God says get rid of
[1:35:15] everybody everything. That's why he told
[1:35:17] Saul, "Kill everything and everybody
[1:35:19] every single thing. Don't take one
[1:35:21] thing." And you know what Saul did?
[1:35:24] when they when they when I forget the
[1:35:26] the story in the Bible where they they
[1:35:28] Achen Hallelujah
[1:35:31] went and took all that stuff not one
[1:35:34] thing my brothers and sisters if we're
[1:35:37] moving on to the rapture we got to leave
[1:35:39] everything when God is revealing new
[1:35:41] things to us we got to leave every old
[1:35:43] understanding behind in in order for us
[1:35:46] to move forward
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; in order for us to overcome
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; in order for new life to come.
[1:35:53] Oh God.
[1:35:56] Hallelujah.
[1:36:00] Hallelujah.
[1:36:02] Never go back. We go forward when you're
[1:36:05] born again. You understand? We go
[1:36:07] forward when you're born again. And
[1:36:09] that's why I think today we have so many
[1:36:12] genuine new births. We don't have so
[1:36:15] many genuine new births. Sorry. is
[1:36:17] because maybe it sympathize with the
[1:36:20] word
[1:36:22] or the person,
[1:36:24] but they don't want to rot away from
[1:36:26] that old system
[1:36:30] that they're in that they were in. They
[1:36:33] don't want to come out of it. Yes, my
[1:36:36] brothers and sisters, this is not the
[1:36:38] denomination's brother Brandham's day.
[1:36:40] This is your thinking.
[1:36:42] This is your understanding. This is your
[1:36:45] experience. that he's talking about
[1:36:47] tonight. You got to judge yourself.
[1:36:50] Hallelujah. Judge where you're at.
[1:36:53] They want to say stay in the old system
[1:36:56] and claimed a new birth or the message
[1:36:59] of the age. It's brother Brandon
[1:37:00] speaking here. We found that under
[1:37:02] Luther Wesley Pentecost and all the
[1:37:04] other ages, they still try to hold on to
[1:37:08] the old system and claim this. But the
[1:37:11] old system age must die and rot in order
[1:37:14] to bring forth a new one. They still
[1:37:17] want to cling.
[1:37:20] Hallelujah. People still in this message
[1:37:23] want to cling to the Pentecostal
[1:37:26] message.
[1:37:29] Hallelujah.
[1:37:30] Amen. What time is it? I can't see.
[1:37:36] Okay,
[1:37:37] we'll just say a couple more things here
[1:37:39] and we'll invite the miss musicians up.
[1:37:41] Hallelujah.
[1:37:43] Like I said earlier, my brothers and
[1:37:45] sisters, this message has a Pentecostal
[1:37:47] birth and it has a new birth of the
[1:37:49] bride age, the capstone age in it.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; It does. Whether you believe it or not,
[1:37:56] whether your interpretation of the
[1:37:58] quotes and all that stuff give you
[1:37:59] something a different out, that's fine.
[1:38:01] I'm just going to hear preaching what's
[1:38:03] on my heart, what God has revealed to
[1:38:04] me.
[1:38:05] invisible union of the bride of Christ.
[1:38:07] You stay right straight in the promise
[1:38:09] of God, the word of God. And that word,
[1:38:12] if it is the word for the age, God
[1:38:14] vindicates it. So, if he doesn't, it's
[1:38:17] not the word for this day. The word that
[1:38:19] fell on the day of Pentecost will not
[1:38:21] work today. No sir. That was for
[1:38:24] Pentecost. This is the bride going home
[1:38:28] of the bride.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; We got something different.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:35] We got something different.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Here's a prophet speaking. We are in a
[1:38:40] bride age. No more than the word of Noah
[1:38:44] would have worked in the days of Moses.
[1:38:47] No more that Moses law would have worked
[1:38:50] in the time of Paul here. He tried to
[1:38:53] tell them, you have to die and be dead
[1:38:56] to that.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; And you cannot have that.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:39:04] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[1:39:08] Let me just find something here to
[1:39:11] invite the musicians up. Hallelujah.
[1:39:16] Hallelujah. Modern vests made are
[1:39:18] clearer made clear by prophecy 1965. See
[1:39:22] a man can say anything but unless God
[1:39:25] interprets that word. But God don't need
[1:39:28] no interpreter.
[1:39:30] He's his own interpreter.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He interprets his own word by
[1:39:34] vindicating it in the age that it's
[1:39:37] purposed for, the age that it's given
[1:39:40] for.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; We're not living, this is brother
[1:39:42] Brandon speaking here. We're not living
[1:39:43] in a Pentecostal age. We're living in
[1:39:45] another age. And I've been trying to
[1:39:47] speak that tonight. Come on.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; After 1963.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; See, we're not living in the Methodist
[1:39:54] age. We're not living in another We're
[1:39:56] living in another age. We're not living
[1:39:58] up here. We're living up here in the
[1:40:00] bride age. the calling out of the church
[1:40:02] and getting it together for a rapture.
[1:40:05] That's the age that we're now living in.
[1:40:07] To my honest opinion, that's the exact
[1:40:10] truth.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; This is the prophet. Amen.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; That's the exact truth. Amen.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; That's what he's saying. This is thus
[1:40:18] sayeth the Lord.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Until the evening time, the end of
[1:40:22] my message when the token became
[1:40:24] available.
[1:40:26] It's the toolken life, the Pentecostal
[1:40:30] life, the Lutheran life, the Wesley. You
[1:40:32] imagine, you imagine uh Luther looking
[1:40:35] at the Catholics going, "My God,
[1:40:39] they have no idea who God is." Then the
[1:40:41] Wesleys look at the Luther. My God, they
[1:40:44] don't move on with us. They don't want
[1:40:45] to move on with us. They're staying in
[1:40:47] their truth.
[1:40:49] We know more of God. They don't know God
[1:40:51] like we know God. And here the Pentecost
[1:40:54] is looking at the the Wesleyans and the
[1:40:57] Weslings get denominated in their mind
[1:40:59] in truth. We got the word God moved in
[1:41:01] our lives. Hallelujah. Glory to God. And
[1:41:04] here they look back. The Pentecostals
[1:41:06] look at them and say, "My God, God has
[1:41:08] moved on and made himself real and
[1:41:10] manifested himself." And here comes
[1:41:13] after 63. Amen. After 63. Amen. The new
[1:41:17] birth became the token birth became
[1:41:20] available. And now the bride age came
[1:41:22] into existence. Amen. And the people
[1:41:24] that are coming now being born again in
[1:41:26] the bride age are looking back at
[1:41:28] Pentecostals. Amen. In this message and
[1:41:31] saying, "Oh, there's more of God." Amen.
[1:41:34] And that's what I'm saying tonight. More
[1:41:36] and more of God. But we got to rot. We
[1:41:39] got to die to the old system. Amen. We
[1:41:43] got to march on with truth.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; God, reveal truth to me. Cry out to God.
[1:41:50] Amen. That's what a baby does. It cries
[1:41:52] out when it wants something. That bird
[1:41:54] pecks and pecks and pecks until it pecks
[1:41:57] way out of it. I'm talking about your
[1:42:00] understanding. I'm talking about the
[1:42:02] revelation, the truth in your mind.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; You don't move forward, you're going to
[1:42:08] be going backwards. You're going to be
[1:42:10] left behind. This thing is moving
[1:42:12] forward.
[1:42:15] And Satan has created such an element
[1:42:17] where everybody I got the message. I'm
[1:42:20] I'm I I I believe the truth. I believe
[1:42:22] the prophet. You're living such a life
[1:42:26] unconsecrated to God, not surrendered to
[1:42:29] God, allowing your life to get so busy
[1:42:32] that you have no time for God. I don't
[1:42:35] care. I'm going to say it anyways.
[1:42:37] Hallelujah. I got to work out my own
[1:42:39] salvation with fear and trembling. Amen.
[1:42:41] I got to work these things out in my
[1:42:43] life to make time for God. Amen. I'm not
[1:42:47] here to explain how for you to make time
[1:42:49] for God. You got to make time for God.
[1:42:51] Amen. Amen. Sitting in this message. Oh,
[1:42:55] we come to church on Wednesday. We come
[1:42:57] to church on Sunday. Amen. We go to this
[1:43:00] fellowship, that fellowship. We believe
[1:43:02] the message. I got prophet uh pictures
[1:43:04] on my wall. But not moving on with God,
[1:43:08] allowing becoming complacency in this
[1:43:10] life. the devil making you lukewarm,
[1:43:13] making your life powerless. And when
[1:43:15] emergency comes in your life, when
[1:43:17] something stirs up your life, you don't
[1:43:19] know where you're at. You don't know
[1:43:21] where God is at.
[1:43:24] Brother Brand, you should be so close
[1:43:26] with God and so prayed up with God. When
[1:43:28] an emergency comes, God is right there.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; He's right on the scene, right at that
[1:43:35] time. There's no question in your heart
[1:43:38] where God is because you are walking
[1:43:41] with God.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:44] Hallelujah. Musicians come.
[1:43:48] Amen.
[1:43:50] Glory to God.
[1:43:53] The token. The last quote here.
[1:43:56] Hopefully
[1:44:00] you're sitting down. I know you're
[1:44:02] tired, but I long day for me. I'm
[1:44:05] sweating. Hallelujah.
[1:44:09] I want to feed too. Amen.
[1:44:13] You must have the token. You say, "I
[1:44:16] believe everything I'm talking about.
[1:44:18] I'm going to read it to you. Yes, I go I
[1:44:21] go to church. I believe the message."
[1:44:25] That is all right. He says, "That is
[1:44:28] good." He says, "But you must have the
[1:44:30] token."
[1:44:32] See, he's identifying something here.
[1:44:36] He's dividing dividing things up here.
[1:44:40] But you must have the token. Do you hear
[1:44:43] brother Brandham talk tabernacle?
[1:44:46] Do you hear tabernacle?
[1:44:48] You must have the token displayed.
[1:44:52] Without it, all your believing is in
[1:44:54] vain. What?
[1:44:56] All you're believing. All you're
[1:44:59] believing in in everything about this
[1:45:01] message if that token life has not been
[1:45:05] birthed.
[1:45:09] Listen, don't get scared.
[1:45:11] Don't get nervous. Get seeking. Get
[1:45:14] praying. Get knocking. Hallelujah.
[1:45:19] You live a good life.
[1:45:21] You listen to what the word says. You go
[1:45:24] to church. You try to live right. That's
[1:45:27] fine.
[1:45:28] But that's not it.
[1:45:32] When I see the blood,
[1:45:34] the blood is the life.
[1:45:36] I want the life of God to manifest
[1:45:39] through my life more than anything. I
[1:45:41] want the life of God. I cry out night
[1:45:44] and day in my spirit. It groans night
[1:45:47] and day for the life of God because I
[1:45:50] know me and myself. Amen. I am nothing.
[1:45:55] I am nothing in the flesh.
[1:45:58] But I cry out for the life of God. More
[1:46:00] and more of the life. I'm more desperate
[1:46:03] today than I was 34 years ago when this
[1:46:06] truth broke open to me. Oh yes, I am.
[1:46:11] And you better get desperate. He says,
[1:46:12] if you're not.
[1:46:14] Hallelujah.
[1:46:16] That's the token. And the token is here.
[1:46:23] Just to come this far.
[1:46:26] come in the message. Believe the
[1:46:28] message. Believe God sent a prophet just
[1:46:29] to come this far. He knows
[1:46:33] the prophet can see in the future and
[1:46:34] speaks in the future. And I say I
[1:46:37] believe the message.
[1:46:39] You obey the message.
[1:46:42] A lot of people misinterpret that
[1:46:44] because they obey the law of the
[1:46:45] message. But listen to what he says.
[1:46:48] Come into Christ.
[1:46:50] Obeying the message. Come into Christ.
[1:46:54] come into this revealed word.
[1:46:56] Hallelujah. You say, "I believe every
[1:46:58] word you say." Brother Brandham, all
[1:47:01] those brother Brandham said, Brother
[1:47:02] Brandham said, Brother Brandham said
[1:47:05] that is good.
[1:47:07] But that's just being able to read.
[1:47:12] Take the message, take it into your
[1:47:14] heart that you must have the token.
[1:47:19] That you must have the token.
[1:47:22] The very life that was in Christ be
[1:47:25] inside of you. This is him speaking now.
[1:47:29] When I see that, I'll pass over you.
[1:47:33] Oh God.
[1:47:37] Oh God.
[1:47:41] Men of God have taken this message after
[1:47:44] the prophet has gone
[1:47:47] to place where the bride today can
[1:47:50] understand this token life in its
[1:47:52] fullness. But as time moves on, the true
[1:47:57] ministers take the message onto perfect
[1:48:00] faith.
[1:48:02] It must keep going higher until perfect
[1:48:05] rapture and faith comes.
[1:48:08] This is me speaking here now. Brother
[1:48:10] Brand, I'm quoting. I was born again in
[1:48:12] 1992 when my awakening came. I was born
[1:48:17] into the seven seal revelation. I didn't
[1:48:19] understand what it was. No.
[1:48:24] But it opened up slow and showed me this
[1:48:28] token life that was changing me over and
[1:48:32] over the years inside like no other word
[1:48:35] from a past age could. In other words,
[1:48:38] the change taking place inside of me was
[1:48:41] not available.
[1:48:43] This change here was not available
[1:48:46] Luther, Wesley or Pentecostal age.
[1:48:50] Only after the seals open I come to
[1:48:52] understand and recognize my birth is a
[1:48:56] seven seal birth that revealed word to
[1:48:59] bring me into rapture and faith
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; for this body change.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:05] That's what I recognize.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; That's what I see manifesting out of my
[1:49:10] life.
[1:49:11] Am I where I want to be? No. Hallelujah.
[1:49:16] Are you where you want to be? No. But
[1:49:19] you must see change. You must see truth
[1:49:23] being opened up. You must see the old
[1:49:25] thoughts, the old ways, the old system
[1:49:28] rotten and dying.
[1:49:30] That's what the spirit does with inside
[1:49:32] of us. It causes everything to die and
[1:49:36] rot. Hallelujah. Let us stand.
[1:49:42] [Music]
[1:49:44] You know, preaching
[1:49:47] is only saying
[1:49:50] certain things a man cannot reveal.
[1:49:55] Only God can reveal. Hallelujah.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; I can't reveal. Even all the words I
[1:50:01] said here tonight, I can't reveal truth
[1:50:03] to you.
[1:50:05] It's between you and God and the spirit
[1:50:07] of God.
[1:50:08] I trust and believe and hope and pray
[1:50:12] with all my heart. That's why I get up
[1:50:15] here or I could be sitting down there
[1:50:17] with you and having eternal life as the
[1:50:19] prophets say instead of going through
[1:50:20] the things that the five-fold ministry
[1:50:23] goes through. Hallelujah.
[1:50:26] each one of us go through
[1:50:30] so that you might be enlightened
[1:50:33] that your awakening might come.
[1:50:36] Hallelujah.
[1:50:38] That God will speak into your hearts.
[1:50:42] Show you something. Even if he showed
[1:50:44] you something so simple tonight, don't
[1:50:47] excuse it. Those are the little things
[1:50:50] that I received. I'm telling you, little
[1:50:54] things that I receive that move me
[1:50:57] forward.
[1:50:59] Hallelujah. We're always looking for big
[1:51:01] revelation, big understanding. It's
[1:51:04] little things.
[1:51:06] If something little was revealed to you
[1:51:08] tonight
[1:51:10] in your life that you got to change or
[1:51:12] you got to move forward or do something,
[1:51:14] whatever it is, take that little thing
[1:51:16] and move on with it.
[1:51:19] It'll take you to the next step and to
[1:51:21] the next step.
[1:51:24] Hallelujah.
[1:51:26] Father, bless your people.
[1:51:30] Oh God, in the name of Jesus,
[1:51:33] this is your people, Lord.
[1:51:36] We are living. We believe with all our
[1:51:39] hearts in the token age, the bride age,
[1:51:41] the capstone age. This is the rapture
[1:51:43] age, Lord. The perfect faith, perfect
[1:51:46] realization of who we are. where the
[1:51:48] bride will recognize who she is and
[1:51:51] she'll catch a body change,
[1:51:54] a transformation in her life. Oh God,
[1:51:57] help each one
[1:52:00] break the chains.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Open the prison doors of their
[1:52:03] understanding and of their minds. Break
[1:52:06] every tradition. Let all the past
[1:52:10] teachings of the doctrines of the past
[1:52:12] age rot inside of them, Lord, and let
[1:52:15] them bring forth new life,
[1:52:18] new revealed word life, the token life
[1:52:21] in this hour. That's the only life that
[1:52:24] God is producing in this hour.
[1:52:26] Hallelujah. Grant it Lord.
[1:52:30] Bless us all, Lord. Bless our pastor,
[1:52:32] his wife
[1:52:34] standing in this position. It's all of
[1:52:36] us as ministers, but to feed the sheep,
[1:52:40] direct the sheep to the green pastures,
[1:52:42] Lord. He can't do it without you, Lord.
[1:52:46] Guide and lead him, Father.
[1:52:49] Lord, that he may be a part to lead us
[1:52:53] deeper into this rapture in faith, this
[1:52:56] token life. Lord, each and every one of
[1:52:59] the ministers here, bless each and every
[1:53:00] one. Open up their understanding more
[1:53:02] and more. I need more light. I need more
[1:53:05] understanding.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Oh God, reveal this truth, this light.
[1:53:09] It's not different. The prophet had it.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Simon had it. But here we are
[1:53:16] moving it on forward, Father. That's
[1:53:18] all.
[1:53:20] Just vessels. Yield it vessels to you,
[1:53:22] Father. Move on your truth, Father. Let
[1:53:25] us just be vessels that you can move it
[1:53:28] through, Father. In Jesus Christ's name
[1:53:30] we ask. God bless you, saints.
[1:53:34] Just what I need
[1:53:37] is more of you.
