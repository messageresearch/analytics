[38:30] the world and they that dwell therein.
[38:34] for he had found it upon the seas and
[38:38] establish

[38:43] into the hill of the Lord? Or who shall

[38:50] clean hands and a pure heart, who had
[38:54] not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor
[38:57] swore unto deceitfully.
[39:00] He shall receive the blessing from the

[39:25] everlasting doors, and the King of glory
[39:28] shall come in.

[39:33] Who is this King of glory? The Lord
[39:36] strong and mighty.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; The Lord mighty in battle.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; He fights your battle tonight.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So don't be
[39:44] discouraged. Amen. He's the one that's

[39:49] Who is this king of glory? The Lord of
[39:53] hosts. He is the king of glory. Amen.
[39:56] Praise the name of the Lord. And as I
[39:59] said tonight, it's only by his grace I

[40:04] ago it could have been a different
[40:06] story.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. I could have been gone. But it's
[40:10] only by his grace that I can stand here
[40:13] and testify of his goodness.

[40:39] because I have blessed assurance that
[40:42] Jesus is mine. Amen.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; I was testifying to a doctor just a
[40:46] couple days ago.
[40:48] You know, have you ever thought about
[40:51] this God that you you say you're
[40:53] serving?
[40:54] Humanly speaking,
[40:57] right? As humans, we think that God is
[41:01] is just something or someone that had a
[41:06] beginning. You know when you talk about
[41:09] when you sit a little bit and ponder
[41:12] right you as a human being you had a
[41:14] mother you had a father. Amen. But this
[41:17] God didn't have a beginning. He's
[41:20] eternal.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; The one that you feel right now as
[41:24] amongst us. You see we're two or three
[41:26] that are gathered in his name. He's in
[41:28] the midst and he's here to bless you
[41:30] tonight.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; And he's the one that chose you. Yeah.

[41:45] your heart, but you got to receive the
[41:47] revelation of what it is. Amen.
[41:50] Hallelujah. Praise God. And I was
[41:54] telling this doctor, I said, "Listen, do
[41:56] you could you analyze God as a doctor?
[42:02] When you look at a human body, it's a
[42:06] marvelous thing
[42:08] how we are formed. The different systems
[42:12] in your body, there got to be a super
[42:15] intelligence
[42:17] out there that form this body. Look at
[42:20] this whole universe. And as our pastor
[42:23] was saying, everything is working in
[42:26] order.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; It's nothing is out of order. Amen. So
[42:31] there got to be a super intelligence
[42:35] that made you
[42:37] &gt;&gt; that placed you here on this earth for a
[42:40] purpose.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; And you got to find your purpose why
[42:43] you're here.

[42:47] find your purpose?

[42:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And those that worship him as our
[42:57] bread must worship him in spirit and in
[43:00] truth. Amen. There's a balance.
[43:03] A bird don't fly on one wing. There is a
[43:07] balance. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[43:10] And the balance for this day is the
[43:12] revealed word of the hour with the Holy
[43:15] Bible.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. Thank you,
[43:20] Lord Jesus. Thank God for his grace in
[43:22] each and one of our lives. Amen. He is
[43:25] the one that chose us before the
[43:28] foundations of this world. Amen. You say
[43:31] you choose Jesus as your savior. He know
[43:34] the choices that you going you going to
[43:36] make when you get here. That's why he
[43:38] put you down in the lamb's book of life.

[43:44] talk about the one that we serve. Amen.
[43:46] Amen. Hallelujah. I don't want to be
[43:48] going on preaching because I got to
[43:50] leave uh some for the other ministers
[43:53] when they come here to share their

[43:58] brought them out. Amen. And share a word
[44:01] of encouragement tonight. You are God's
[44:04] test piece here.

[44:11] test pieces amongst us.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; There's a part of you that cannot be
[44:16] destroyed.

[44:20] you, he cannot destroy you because he
[44:24] said all that he he had given him, they

[44:31] to be lost. So you can't be lost. There

[1:07:47] galaxies are born [music]
[1:07:52] in the vapor [singing] of your breath of
[1:07:55] planets.
[1:07:59] If the stars were made to [singing]
[1:08:02] worship so alive,
[1:08:05] [music]
[1:08:07] I can see your heart and everything you
[1:08:11] have made.
[1:08:15] Every single star, [music] signal fire
[1:08:18] [singing]
[1:08:19] of grace,
[1:08:22] and the nation sings [music and singing]
[1:08:24] your praises. So alive.
[1:08:32] [music]
[1:08:35] So love
[1:08:41] God of your promise.
[1:08:45] [music] Don't speak in vain. [singing]
[1:08:47] Sill empty your voice.
[1:08:57] You are [music] spoken.
[1:09:00] All nature [singing] and science follow
[1:09:02] [music] the sound of your voice.
[1:09:10] And as you [music and singing] speak,
[1:09:15] a 100 billion [singing]
[1:09:17] creatures catch your [music]
[1:09:19] breath.
[1:09:22] evolving in [singing] pursuit [music] of
[1:09:25] what you said.
[1:09:30] If it all reveals your nature so light,
[1:09:37] I can see your heart in everything you
[1:09:41] [music and singing] say.
[1:09:44] Every painted sky, [singing] a canvas of
[1:09:48] your [music]
[1:09:49] grace.
[1:09:52] If creation still obeys you, so will I.
[1:10:02] So will I.
[1:10:18] If the stars were made to worship, so
[1:10:22] will I.
[1:10:26] If the mountains bow in reverence, so
[1:10:30] alive.
[1:10:33] If the [music] oceans roar, your
[1:10:35] greatness, so alive.
[1:10:41] For if everything exists to lift you
[1:10:45] high, so will [singing] I.
[1:10:48] If the wind goes where you send it, so
[1:10:52] will I.
[1:10:56] If the rocks cry out in silence, so will
[1:11:00] I.
[1:11:03] If the song of all your praises still
[1:11:07] fall shine,
[1:11:11] then we'll sing again a h 100 billion
[1:11:15] times
[1:11:28] 100 billion times.
[1:11:34] God of salvation.
[1:11:45] You chased on my heart through all of my
[1:11:48] failure and pride.
[1:11:56] On a hill you created
[1:12:00] light of [singing] the world abandoned
[1:12:03] in darkness to pride.
[1:12:10] And as [singing] you speak,
[1:12:15] a 100 billion [singing] failures
[1:12:18] disappear.
[1:12:22] Where you lost your life
[1:12:24] [music and singing] so I could find it
[1:12:27] here.
[1:12:29] If you left the grave behind you, so
[1:12:33] alive.
[1:12:37] You see your heart in everything you've
[1:12:41] done.
[1:12:44] Every part designed a work of art called
[1:12:49] love.
[1:12:52] If you gladly chose surrender so love
[1:12:59] I can see your heart a billion different
[1:13:03] [music and singing] ways.
[1:13:07] Every precious one, [singing] a child
[1:13:10] you die [music] to save.
[1:13:14] If the grave command to love, then so
[1:13:18] will I
[1:13:22] like you would again 100 billion times.
[1:13:30] But what measure could amount to your
[1:13:34] desire?
[1:13:37] You're the one who never leave the
[1:13:40] [music and singing] one behind.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [applause]
[1:13:49] Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Thank
[1:13:51] you, Lord God.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Wonderful. Um, we said
[1:13:58] we were going to take up an offering.
[1:13:59] So, let's do that before it leaves me.
[1:14:01] This will be the last one be uh the year
[1:14:04] and give you an opportunity to give and
[1:14:06] and get everything in, you know, uh the
[1:14:10] last opportunity of the year to give
[1:14:12] back to him in this kind of a way,
[1:14:14] right? So, let's bow our heads. Father,
[1:14:16] we thank you for this uh time and uh day
[1:14:20] that we're living in and the the funds
[1:14:22] that you've supplied us. you supplied us
[1:14:24] more with with so much, Lord, and and
[1:14:27] we're so grateful. And we know that you
[1:14:30] are a God that uh is a God of abundance.
[1:14:34] So, we're asking you to bless each and
[1:14:36] every person here as they give. And may
[1:14:39] the Holy Spirit just fulfill his word in
[1:14:41] us. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
[1:14:45] You believe God?
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; You know, Sister Amanda wanted to give a
[1:14:49] short testimony. She's the uh actually
[1:14:52] the only one who who uh sent in that.
[1:14:54] Okay, I'll get up and give a quick
[1:14:55] testimony. So, let's hear her right now.
[1:14:57] God bless her. [applause]
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints. I had this
[1:15:06] thought that maybe I should give this
[1:15:08] testimony, but I waited because I said
[1:15:11] perhaps this would be the year that
[1:15:13] Brother Mike would be like, "Oh my gosh,
[1:15:16] it's so much we have to put some off for
[1:15:18] Sunday.
[1:15:21] But then he called and he in
[1:15:22] conversation with my beloved back there.
[1:15:26] He's like the sister Amanda have a
[1:15:28] testimony. Quick short one. So from the
[1:15:32] lamb's book of life, here's a paragraph
[1:15:35] of my life, his life in me. I know that
[1:15:39] this testimony is meant to be a blessing
[1:15:41] because this is the time he chose to
[1:15:44] give it. So for whomsoever
[1:15:48] he has this testimony for through this
[1:15:52] trial that I experienced.
[1:15:55] He let me know that this trial was not
[1:15:58] meant to punish me. It wasn't something
[1:16:01] that I did, but I learned from it. I
[1:16:05] grew from it.
[1:16:07] And that it was meant to be a blessing
[1:16:10] to somebody else who was going through
[1:16:12] something. Whatever that interprets as,
[1:16:16] he's our God. Amen.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; So, we live to give him glory.
[1:16:23] And in this paragraph, this year,
[1:16:27] one of the greatest trials that I had
[1:16:30] was with my health.
[1:16:32] Now, he's been struggling to bring me
[1:16:35] down and put me down with all sorts of
[1:16:38] things.
[1:16:40] And he turned up the heat this year.
[1:16:43] So,
[1:16:45] um, I start having
[1:16:49] heart, my heart racing out of nowhere,
[1:16:52] it would just be pounding really, really
[1:16:55] loudly that I can hear my heart rate in
[1:16:58] my ear.
[1:17:00] And the pews we had before, if I was
[1:17:02] sitting, I would literally be pushed
[1:17:05] off. It was so intense.
[1:17:09] And so it continued. It continued.
[1:17:13] This is the third time that I have been
[1:17:16] asked by my doctor to wear a heart
[1:17:18] monitor.
[1:17:20] And now I was referred this year to a
[1:17:23] cardiologist
[1:17:25] because I got a smart watch.
[1:17:28] And my doctor says it's not always
[1:17:31] accurate, but hopefully the cardiologist
[1:17:34] would be able to help you figure out
[1:17:36] what's happening and if it's real or
[1:17:40] something's happening.
[1:17:43] I went to the cardiologist.
[1:17:45] Before that, they took my blood work.
[1:17:47] Praise God.
[1:17:49] Whenever I've had to do a blood work,
[1:17:51] it's come back a-ok. Okay. Nothing's
[1:17:54] ever been wrong with my blood work. And
[1:17:57] every time I look at that or I hear
[1:17:59] that, I go, Satan, you see, you can't
[1:18:01] take my life. My life is in the blood.
[1:18:04] What are you trying to do? You have no
[1:18:05] roots in there. He's grasping at straws.
[1:18:08] But listen,
[1:18:10] it got real this year. Like really real.
[1:18:15] When the symptoms of the attacks of the
[1:18:18] enemy come upon your flesh, they are
[1:18:22] real and it affects your mind.
[1:18:26] You begin to think and the battle
[1:18:29] begins. Am I going to accept this? And
[1:18:33] what portion am I going to accept?
[1:18:35] Because as he's pushing his thoughts or
[1:18:38] all these things on you, you're pushing
[1:18:39] back because fate's in there. It's
[1:18:44] alive. It's well to tell his story.
[1:18:48] Uh so I had a couple of different series
[1:18:51] of tests done. I wore a mon monitor for
[1:18:54] like 14 days. I had a stress test done
[1:18:57] and then my husband accompanied me four
[1:19:00] to six weeks after for the results.
[1:19:03] Now, this is the cardiologist. We go and
[1:19:06] we sit in his office and he's terribly
[1:19:08] late. We're sitting there for an hour
[1:19:10] past the appointment time. So, now I'm
[1:19:13] thinking, is it that he found something
[1:19:16] and he can't read what it says? So, my
[1:19:19] husband is like, "Don't worry, don't
[1:19:21] worry. He'll get there." We sit there
[1:19:24] and he turns his monitor to the to us so
[1:19:27] we can see what's on his screen.
[1:19:31] and all the medical the medical chart is
[1:19:34] there with the waves and whatever and at
[1:19:36] the bottom there's a technician's report
[1:19:39] and it says um
[1:19:42] it says um pro probability of a blockage
[1:19:47] he says just ignore that this is this is
[1:19:49] the the cardiologist saying just ignore
[1:19:51] that was like wow God's God's at work
[1:19:55] already
[1:19:56] he goes on and he says
[1:19:59] all I can tell tell you is that we
[1:20:02] picked up palpitations.
[1:20:05] So my heart the racing of my heart. They
[1:20:09] last for about a minute but then you go
[1:20:11] back to normal.
[1:20:13] What does that translate to? We don't
[1:20:15] have enough info for you. So here's what
[1:20:18] we're going to introduce you to. A few
[1:20:20] lifestyle changes because as you get
[1:20:22] older in age, women, sisters, I'm
[1:20:24] sharing this with you. um your estrogen,
[1:20:27] your estrogen level goes down and it
[1:20:31] causes your heart to work harder to push
[1:20:34] the blood up and that tends to make your
[1:20:37] heart rate raise. So for me, I got to
[1:20:41] work on building my leg muscles,
[1:20:43] drinking water, staying away from
[1:20:45] coffee, and taking magnesium.
[1:20:48] And I have a choice. I can have him do
[1:20:53] an incision and put in a little monitor
[1:20:55] that he can monitor for himself.
[1:20:59] I was like, not an option for me,
[1:21:00] doctor. What's next? Well, we have a
[1:21:04] portable ECG device that you can carry
[1:21:08] around and whenever you feel it, you
[1:21:11] you let it take a reading and after
[1:21:15] you've taken the reading or such and
[1:21:17] such, you bring it back to us so we can
[1:21:19] better understand what's happening with
[1:21:22] you. That's where that left off. But
[1:21:25] while that was happening, I was having
[1:21:28] memory problems.
[1:21:30] Boy, oh boy, it just keeps getting more
[1:21:33] and more. Now, some of you are hearing
[1:21:34] this for the first time.
[1:21:37] When the pressure came, I was so
[1:21:39] grateful that our deacons and our pastor
[1:21:43] prayed with me because in that moment, I
[1:21:47] know I needed reinforcement.
[1:21:49] It got really bad to the point where
[1:21:53] I don't know, I thought this was maybe
[1:21:55] my time. I don't know.
[1:21:58] But I I praise God for them and for each
[1:22:01] of you. And we didn't put it on the chat
[1:22:04] for everybody to pray because to me I
[1:22:07] felt like the family of God was already
[1:22:10] in their battle. They were enough and
[1:22:13] they are enough. And I praise God for
[1:22:15] each and every one of them. And
[1:22:19] my deacon called every deacon that was
[1:22:22] possible on that Sunday and prayed. And
[1:22:25] I was at rest. And then when the devil
[1:22:28] stirred up, I said to my pastor after a
[1:22:31] Wednesday night, "Pastor, can you pray?"
[1:22:34] And it wasn't the prayer in as much as
[1:22:36] the prayer that he prayed, but he began
[1:22:39] to minister about the fear I had. I
[1:22:43] never told him exactly what he said.
[1:22:47] But it wasn't the fear of dying, but the
[1:22:50] fear of leaving my loved ones that I
[1:22:53] feared.
[1:22:55] And he said, Why don't you worry? You're
[1:22:59] a seed of God. You can't die.
[1:23:02] When he ministered, that was it. I had
[1:23:05] no trouble. I had no trouble.
[1:23:08] Um, from my head injury, I saw a
[1:23:10] neurologist.
[1:23:13] No correction. I did a CT scan on my
[1:23:17] head and I'm awaiting currently a
[1:23:19] neurologist. So the technician of that
[1:23:22] report said,
[1:23:24] "Well,
[1:23:26] in the scans,
[1:23:28] we saw bright spots in your head."
[1:23:33] Thank God for AI that reads medical
[1:23:36] reports. I couldn't understand them.
[1:23:39] Basically, it's the the the bright spots
[1:23:42] are blockages in my nerve endings in my
[1:23:45] brain, which I don't have to rush off
[1:23:49] because it's not brain damage. And so,
[1:23:55] all that being said,
[1:23:58] I if you ask me if I have a heart
[1:24:01] problem, I don't have a heart problem. I
[1:24:04] just love praising the Lord. My heart
[1:24:06] can't keep up. Not by problem.
[1:24:09] Um [laughter]
[1:24:12] and and so I leave it in the hands of
[1:24:15] the Lord. So when I was asked to do
[1:24:17] this, there was something he reminded
[1:24:19] me. He is still the way. He's still the
[1:24:22] truth. And he's still the life.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; And if he got me through it, he's going
[1:24:28] to get you through.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. [applause]
[1:24:32] Hallelujah.
[1:24:35] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:24:40] Amen. He's got it all in control.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [music]
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; So if he's got it all in control, then I
[1:24:47] will praise the [music] Lord.
[1:24:53] Yes, I [music] will praise the Lord
[1:24:59] [music]

[1:26:07] clean." Let's all stand and sing and
[1:26:09] pray. Oh, I will praise him. [music]

[1:26:46] Oh, he's [music] forgiven my
[1:26:49] transgression.
[1:26:52] And he [music] has cleansed my heart
[1:26:55] from sin.
[1:26:58] [music] And I will praise him.
[1:27:04] Praise the [music] lamb for sinners.

[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. He has raised us. Amen. Praise
[1:35:17] God.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Phillip is going to say a few
[1:35:19] words. Another one of our precious
[1:35:21] deacons. Wonderful man.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; God bless [laughter] you.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:35:28] Let's give God an applause.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; And
[1:35:33] I'm just grateful for what God has done
[1:35:36] for of us to bring us through 2025. And
[1:35:41] like myself, our family went through um
[1:35:44] a lot of things, but scripture said many
[1:35:47] afflictions of the righteous and I
[1:35:49] believe that God has brought us all
[1:35:51] through. Amen.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; In all afflictions, he take care of us.
[1:35:54] So I'm very grateful, thankful to the
[1:35:57] Lord for his grace and mercy. And as we
[1:36:00] entering 2026,
[1:36:02] I have a two scriptures, one scripture
[1:36:06] and just a small quotation from Bra. I
[1:36:09] just want to share with the church. I
[1:36:11] hope that it blesses all of us as we
[1:36:13] entering 2026.
[1:36:16] And my scripture is taken from 3r John
[1:36:19] 1:2.
[1:36:22] It says that beloved I wish above all
[1:36:24] things that thou mayest pro prosper and
[1:36:28] be in health even as thy soul prosper.
[1:36:32] As our former pastor has always been
[1:36:34] saying that redemption in three parts.
[1:36:36] So as we entering the year 2026 don't
[1:36:40] accept one part redemption.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; We have to accept all three parts of the
[1:36:45] redemption. And say over here in just
[1:36:48] one more time, Lord. And paragraph 121
[1:36:53] say 3012.
[1:36:56] He said, "And somebody said something
[1:36:58] about divine healing." And they claimed
[1:37:01] it was another day. See, pointing off to
[1:37:05] what was maybe to be over in the
[1:37:09] millennium.
[1:37:10] What do you need divine healing in the
[1:37:12] millennium for when you are immortal?
[1:37:15] Today is the day. This is the day.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; So don't let nobody tells [applause] you
[1:37:22] that you need divine healing over there.
[1:37:23] You don't need over there. Your
[1:37:25] prosperity you need it now.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; You are living with great substance.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; The first they went with great
[1:37:32] substance. We're living back with great
[1:37:34] substance.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:37:38] forever. The same God that spoke to the
[1:37:42] woman at the well. The same God that
[1:37:46] spoke to Moses, the same God that parted
[1:37:50] the mighty Red Sea, that same God lives
[1:37:53] in you and in me.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Just as we entering 2026, I encourage
[1:37:57] everyone remember no matter what happens
[1:38:00] your way, that same God lives in you.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:38:07] forever. That's the little exaltation I
[1:38:09] have. Amen. He's the same God. He has
[1:38:12] the children.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Every praise [music]
[1:38:21] is to our [singing] God.
[1:38:23] Every word of worship in one accord.
[1:38:28] Every praise, [singing and music] every
[1:38:31] praise is to our God.
[1:38:34] Come on now.
[1:38:36] Sing hallelujah [music]
[1:38:38] to our God. Glory hallelujah
[1:38:42] to our God.
[1:38:45] Every praise.
[1:38:48] [music]
[1:38:50] Let me hear one more time. Every praise,
[1:38:53] every praise to our God.
[1:38:56] [music and singing]
[1:38:57] Every word of worship in one accord.
[1:39:02] Every [music] praise.
[1:39:04] Every [singing] praise to our God.
[1:39:08] [music]
[1:39:10] Sing hallelujah.
[1:39:14] Glory hallelujah [music] to our God.

[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every morning, you should get up
[1:40:13] and say, "Yes, he is. He's a He's my
[1:40:15] healer. He's my savior. He's my
[1:40:17] redeemer. He's my help." Amen.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Look in the mirror and say, "My God is a
[1:40:22] a healer this morning." Praise God. His
[1:40:25] word is true.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Are you happy?
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. You serve a God like that. All
[1:40:30] right, you can be seated for a second.
[1:40:31] Sister Bernice here is going to sing a
[1:40:33] song for us
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; and we're moving along. God bless you.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; All my words fall short.
[1:40:50] I've [music] got nothing new.
[1:40:55] How could I express
[1:41:00] all [music] my gratitude?
[1:41:05] I could sing [music and singing] these
[1:41:07] songs
[1:41:10] as I often do,
[1:41:14] but every [music and singing] song must
[1:41:17] stand
[1:41:20] and you [music] never do.
[1:41:24] So [singing] I'll throw up my hands and
[1:41:28] praise [music] you again and again.
[1:41:32] Cuz all that I have is a [music]
[1:41:35] hallelujah.
[1:41:40] Hallelu.
[1:41:42] [music]
[1:41:44] And I know it's [singing] not much, but
[1:41:46] I've nothing else fit for a [music] king
[1:41:51] except for a heart singing hallelujah.
[1:41:59] Hallelu.
[1:42:08] I've got one [music] resp.
[1:42:13] I've got [singing] just one move.
[1:42:17] With my [music] arms stretched wide,

[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; You know, um we got one more special and
[1:45:35] then we're going we have uh the
[1:45:36] testimony [music] of uh Sister Deborah.
[1:45:39] We'll follow that. All right. Sister
[1:45:41] Deborah Beers, she's going to give her
[1:45:43] her [music] personal testimony. But we
[1:45:44] have one more song special. And uh that
[1:45:48] was uh I believe the the only person who
[1:45:52] actually physically called me. Everybody
[1:45:54] else was text. That's which is perfectly
[1:45:56] fine. But when sister Mary [music]
[1:45:58] called me,
[1:46:00] I said, "Oh, of course."
[1:46:04] And it brought tears to my eyes right
[1:46:06] there and at work and I just said, "Oh,
[1:46:08] of course." So she's going to come and
[1:46:10] sing. But first, life is easy
[1:46:15] [music]
[1:46:16] when you're up on the mountain
[1:46:20] and you've got peace of mind
[1:46:24] like you [music] never know.
[1:46:29] But then things change and [music]
[1:46:32] you're down in the valley.
[1:46:37] Oh, don't lose faith. [music]
[1:46:41] For you're never alone.
[1:46:44] Come on. What a God on the mountain.
[1:46:47] [music]
[1:46:49] There's still God in the valley.
[1:46:53] When things go wrong,
[1:46:57] he'll make [music] it right.
[1:47:01] And the God of the good times
[1:47:04] [music and singing]
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, we got to sing the second verse.
[1:47:17] Well, you talk [music] of faith.
[1:47:21] You're up on a mountain, [singing]
[1:47:24] but the dark [music] comes so easy
[1:47:29] when life is [singing] pain.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; But it's down in the valley
[1:47:37] of trials and temptations.
[1:47:41] That's when [music] faith
[1:47:44] is really put to the test
[1:47:48] [music]
[1:47:48] for the God of the mountain.
[1:47:52] He's still God in the valley.
[1:47:57] When things go wrong,
[1:48:01] he'll make it right.
[1:48:04] [music]
[1:48:11] [music]
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:48:18] [singing]
[1:48:23] [music]
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; I want to thank God
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; for what God has done for me and my
[1:48:36] family for this year.
[1:48:41] I pray I I asked God when my husband was
[1:48:46] sick. I promise God say God
[1:48:49] if you heal my husband for me I'm going
[1:48:52] to sing song in my heart
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; and praise you.

[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Well, what a privilege it is to be back
[1:54:56] in the house of the Lord.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Um,
[1:55:01] I just want to say that I'm very
[1:55:02] thankful to be here today
[1:55:06] by the grace of God.
[1:55:09] I want to thank all the saints, Pastor
[1:55:12] Danny, Sister Jennifer, Brother Simon,
[1:55:15] all the saints of God for all your
[1:55:17] prayers through this time.
[1:55:20] But uh I know that God's doing a great
[1:55:22] work.
[1:55:24] It's funny, when I first started um my
[1:55:27] testimony, I actually started writing it
[1:55:29] about 10 years ago.
[1:55:32] And God had me to end it at a certain
[1:55:34] point and put it away and said, "It's
[1:55:38] not time."
[1:55:40] So now he says it's time for me to share
[1:55:44] this with you and I pray it'll be a
[1:55:45] blessing to each and every one of you.
[1:55:48] [clears throat]
[1:55:49] I was born in July 1967
[1:55:52] to Jim and Diane EMTT. I had three older
[1:55:56] brothers.
[1:55:58] My mom actually had two miscarriages
[1:56:01] after my three older brothers and she
[1:56:03] was told no more kids.
[1:56:07] So when she got pregnant for me, she
[1:56:10] said, "I'm keeping it. I don't care what
[1:56:13] I have to go through." Um, she got very
[1:56:16] sick during the pregnancy. Um, I was
[1:56:19] born premature.
[1:56:22] I was born um with a very gastric ill
[1:56:26] stomach. I could not keep food down. Um,
[1:56:29] I had to be put in intensive care for a
[1:56:32] month.
[1:56:34] And lo and behold, as uh brother Tim and
[1:56:37] I connected, we actually connected back
[1:56:40] then because eight days later, Brother
[1:56:43] Tim Beers was born
[1:56:46] almost dying that that night from uh
[1:56:49] fluid on his lungs and he was put in the
[1:56:52] same intensive care as me.
[1:56:55] I you know when we share that story
[1:56:58] everybody's like it's just the grace of
[1:57:01] God that started our journey way back
[1:57:03] then.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful for that.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; Um
[1:57:12] three years later. So I lived on a
[1:57:14] street
[1:57:16] tim and I at the time lived in separate
[1:57:18] areas of Toronto. Three years later,
[1:57:22] after we were born in the same hospital,
[1:57:26] his family moved on my street, right
[1:57:28] across from me,
[1:57:31] and that's where it all began.
[1:57:33] [laughter]
[1:57:35] Um,
[1:57:37] a pinnacle part of my journey was an
[1:57:41] incident that happened to me, excuse
[1:57:44] [clears throat] me, my throat's very
[1:57:45] dry, when I was 14 years old.
[1:57:49] Um, it was a day in October
[1:57:52] 1981.
[1:57:54] I had some friends that I hung out with.
[1:57:57] I w wasn't close close with them, but I
[1:57:59] hung out with them periodically.
[1:58:02] On that particular morning of this
[1:58:04] particular day, one of the friends got
[1:58:07] into a fight with um one of the
[1:58:10] neighbors wives over the a dog that they
[1:58:13] had because she wasn't looking after the
[1:58:15] dog properly and so forth.
[1:58:19] So that same night,
[1:58:22] myself and two other friends were
[1:58:24] standing in front of uh one of our
[1:58:26] friends buildings
[1:58:28] and
[1:58:30] I actually
[1:58:34] So I'm facing my friend's building and
[1:58:37] this is the street
[1:58:39] and it went all the way down to the
[1:58:41] lake.
[1:58:43] And as I was standing there, I sensed a
[1:58:46] person
[1:58:47] that came out.
[1:58:49] And I turned and I looked and I saw it
[1:58:53] was the husband of that wife
[1:58:56] that had the argument with my friend
[1:58:58] earlier that day.
[1:59:02] Instantly, a voice spoke to me and said,
[1:59:07] "Turn around."
[1:59:09] Within seconds,
[1:59:12] I was on the ground.
[1:59:14] I was shot with two bullets.
[1:59:18] One is a quarter of an inch from my
[1:59:20] spine and one in my buttocks and they're
[1:59:23] still in my body today.
[1:59:26] By the grace of God, I should have been
[1:59:30] finished.
[1:59:31] But because that voice that he spoke
[1:59:34] that day to ask me and told me to turn,
[1:59:39] it would have been fatal.
[1:59:41] But God had a plan
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; to go forward in our lives. [applause]
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; I was actually p physically paralyzed
[1:59:51] because when I was on the ground, I
[1:59:53] couldn't move.
[1:59:55] And it wasn't until I got to the
[1:59:57] hospital and things sorted out and God
[2:00:00] gave me back my feeling in my legs. Um,
[2:00:04] he actually
[2:00:07] got me to a place where I just wanted to
[2:00:11] get out. I wanted to move on with life.
[2:00:13] It was a tragedy, but there was
[2:00:16] something inside of me that just wanted
[2:00:18] to press forth and do well and and not
[2:00:23] stay in a, you know, because tragedies
[2:00:25] like that can cause somebody to go into
[2:00:27] a bad sit situation, fear and depression
[2:00:32] and and so forth. But by the grace of
[2:00:35] God, I was back to school in two months.
[2:00:38] I caught up on all my schoolwork. I I
[2:00:41] was successful in school and he just he
[2:00:44] just helped me along the way. Now, to
[2:00:48] that part of it,
[2:00:51] God used it as well because brother Tim
[2:00:54] heard on the radio the next morning that
[2:00:56] I actually had died.
[2:00:59] and he said something in his heart just
[2:01:02] changed
[2:01:04] towards me. We weren't close friends at
[2:01:07] that time.
[2:01:09] Anyway, he found out the truth that I
[2:01:11] was in the hospital. I did survive
[2:01:15] and he came with me to the trial because
[2:01:18] there was a trial and so forth. And he
[2:01:21] was there with me through the whole
[2:01:22] thing. And it was from then that God
[2:01:26] started to bring a friendship between
[2:01:28] us. And then gradually we got married.
[2:01:32] We got married in February of 1989.
[2:01:36] We have three children, Adam, Naomi, and
[2:01:38] Caleb. [clears throat]
[2:01:41] As most of you may know, Brother Tim's
[2:01:43] testimony about his suffering from
[2:01:45] anxiety and depression due to a head
[2:01:48] injury that he suffered uh at work.
[2:01:52] Um I had to live um with
[2:01:57] him in that state for about three and a
[2:02:00] half years before that God called us.
[2:02:03] But in that time
[2:02:07] all I knew I didn't know I didn't go to
[2:02:10] church. I wasn't religious.
[2:02:14] But I said I believe there's a living
[2:02:15] God. That's all that came in my heart
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; every single night.
[2:02:22] Without fail,
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; I said, "God,
[2:02:27] heal my husband."
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; I cried out for three and a half years.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; And then
[2:02:43] it all changed.
[2:02:48] In January of 1991,
[2:02:52] Brother Tim's natural brother Paul Beers
[2:02:56] worked at Campbell Soup
[2:02:59] and he was witnessed to by brother Mike
[2:03:02] Brennan, Brother Gee Clement.
[2:03:07] Paul came home from work that day and
[2:03:11] sat down with brother Tim.
[2:03:15] He goes, "You know, I was talking to
[2:03:16] these brothers today and they're talking
[2:03:18] about God and faith and the Bible and
[2:03:21] this and that."
[2:03:23] He goes, "But there's one thing that
[2:03:24] they said."
[2:03:27] He said, they talked about Acts 2:38
[2:03:31] that you need to repent of your sins and
[2:03:34] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[2:03:36] Jesus Christ.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; Instantly,
[2:03:40] there was an awakening within Brother
[2:03:43] Tim's heart.
[2:03:45] that he never felt. He didn't feel a lot
[2:03:49] during those three and a half years, but
[2:03:51] there was an awakening that took place.
[2:03:53] That was a pinnacle moment in both of
[2:03:56] our lives.
[2:03:58] So, he attended a Wednesday night
[2:04:01] service on Weston Road in Toronto.
[2:04:04] I lived with him
[2:04:06] and I saw his condition.
[2:04:09] I saw the countenance on his face every
[2:04:13] day.
[2:04:15] So him and his brother went to the
[2:04:18] service. I stayed home.
[2:04:21] He got home from that service.
[2:04:26] He opened the door
[2:04:30] and I said, "What happened to you?"
[2:04:35] He said, "What do you mean?"
[2:04:37] I said, "There's a light
[2:04:39] all all around your face, all around
[2:04:42] you, there's a light. What happened?
[2:04:47] And I for the first time I saw that
[2:04:50] darkness leave his face.
[2:04:53] [applause]
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; And I said, Lord, I looked at him and I
[2:04:59] said, I'm going next time [laughter]
[2:05:02] because this is our answer of all the
[2:05:04] years.
[2:05:08] I remember walking up the stairs to the
[2:05:10] upper
[2:05:12] room where we had our services on the
[2:05:14] Wednesday nights
[2:05:16] and all that drew me was the music.
[2:05:21] The just the music was just so peaceful
[2:05:25] that I haven't felt in a long time.
[2:05:28] I got up the stairs. We sat down.
[2:05:33] And I remember looking at the
[2:05:35] keyboardist.
[2:05:38] It was Sister Trudy at the time.
[2:05:41] That same light
[2:05:44] that was on Brother Tim's face was on
[2:05:46] her face. And I said, "Lord, I want I
[2:05:50] want that same light.
[2:05:53] I want that same experience.
[2:05:57] I just you become desperate and then God
[2:06:01] comes and answers.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; I remember the word that came forth from
[2:06:08] our former pastor that night
[2:06:11] and it was just life and all I felt was
[2:06:14] life for the first time in so long.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; And it was just a supernatural
[2:06:21] experience for both of us. He just
[2:06:22] called us and
[2:06:25] from that point on he's done a mighty
[2:06:29] work in both of our lives and he
[2:06:32] continues to do a mighty work in both of
[2:06:34] our lives.
[2:06:36] We, you know, you come to that place and
[2:06:40] you don't realize that he has a great
[2:06:41] work for you to do. and and as you
[2:06:45] continue to walk and you grow and he
[2:06:48] continues to just bless you and and
[2:06:53] it just it was it's just been yeah a lot
[2:06:57] of valleys and ups and downs but you
[2:06:59] know what I wouldn't change it for a
[2:07:00] thing because he draws us closer every
[2:07:03] time.
[2:07:06] Uh we were both baptized that same year
[2:07:08] 198 1991 on April 12th.
[2:07:12] From that moment on,
[2:07:15] it was a dramatic change in both of our
[2:07:17] lives. I just started walking with the
[2:07:19] Lord on my own. I just saw God
[2:07:20] delivering my husband, but I just
[2:07:22] started walking and seeking him on my
[2:07:25] own for my own deliverance.
[2:07:28] And I we I experienced something that I
[2:07:32] know Abraham when when God
[2:07:34] said,"Abraham, just pack up, leave this
[2:07:37] land and follow me." I experienced that
[2:07:41] so strong
[2:07:44] because what I came from and what I
[2:07:47] experienced
[2:07:49] with what I went through in our early
[2:07:51] years of our marriage and and
[2:07:55] this was life to me. He became life to
[2:07:58] me and I didn't know anything else but
[2:08:03] to just surrender my life more and more
[2:08:05] to him. The other thing I forgot to
[2:08:08] mention is during that three and a half
[2:08:10] years of me praying for for Tim,
[2:08:16] I had something in my heart so strong
[2:08:20] that,
[2:08:21] you know, some women might have it hard
[2:08:24] and they might want to leave. I'm just
[2:08:26] being honest with you.
[2:08:28] But there was a supernatural strength
[2:08:31] inside of me that said, "I ain't moving.
[2:08:35] I ain't leaving until I see my husband
[2:08:39] delivered." [applause]
[2:08:40] And that was I know that was God back
[2:08:43] then
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; because it was not a very easy road for
[2:08:47] those for those times.
[2:08:51] Um during um my birth, as I said, when I
[2:08:55] was sick, I was born with many things
[2:08:57] and one of them being, as I said, the
[2:08:59] gastric stomach. So, as we're starting
[2:09:02] to walk with the Lord, I'm just walking
[2:09:04] and feeding and and just not paying
[2:09:07] attention. And one morning, I woke up
[2:09:09] and I I my stomach felt different.
[2:09:14] &gt;&gt; I said, "Wow, that's odd." I usually had
[2:09:16] pain every night and gas and pain. I
[2:09:20] suffered with it since I was born.
[2:09:23] Lo and behold,
[2:09:25] it was gone from that day. [applause]
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; God, he supernaturally just took it from
[2:09:33] me.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; And I just kept walking and it just it
[2:09:38] just increased my faith and I just kept
[2:09:40] walking and walking and believing him.
[2:09:45] Well, through all of these events that
[2:09:47] I've been through and I'm still going
[2:09:50] through, but I know that these are all
[2:09:53] part of the great plan that he has for
[2:09:55] me.
[2:09:56] [applause]
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; He's he's blessed me with many things.
[2:10:01] My husband, my children, my family, the
[2:10:04] wonderful family of God.
[2:10:06] Um he's given me a a wonderful job that
[2:10:10] he gave me over the years. And and I
[2:10:13] know this past m this past month hasn't
[2:10:17] been easy for me in this struggle that
[2:10:20] I'm going through in my health, but I
[2:10:23] know that God's doing something good
[2:10:26] once again in my life.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; So, I'm just looking to see
[2:10:31] the victory at the end of this because I
[2:10:35] know that it's just going to get better.
[2:10:38] Amen.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; It's an honor and a privilege and humbly
[2:10:41] to serve him and walk in his glorious
[2:10:44] walk. I've been through the water.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; I've been through the flood. I've been
[2:10:50] through the fire.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; But it's been all through the blood.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. [applause]
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[2:11:00] Praise the Lord.

[2:14:28] that's a testimony that if you've got
[2:14:29] that kind of a [music] testimony, that's
[2:14:31] all you need to do is just just share
[2:14:34] that with the people
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; and you'll be surprised what God can do.
[2:14:38] Amen. Praise [music] God. God bless you.

[2:16:12] experience comes through the song. Amen.
[2:16:15] And and that's what that's what God
[2:16:17] uses. That's what that's how you know
[2:16:19] God is in the midst. Amen. That's how
[2:16:21] you know that uh uh it it's supernatural
[2:16:25] when a life is transformed and
[2:16:28] delivered. Amen. And so you being here

[2:17:11] your testimonies. Um, they will
[2:17:15] certainly live in the hearts of the
[2:17:17] people um, and remember this night.
[2:17:20] Praise God. Let's go to the word of God.
[2:17:23] I've got a short thought.
[2:17:26] um few scriptures that I'd like to talk
[2:17:29] to you about um here as we leave 2025
[2:17:32] behind. Amen. Let's look at uh Joshua
[2:17:36] chapter 14.
[2:17:39] Um we're going to read a few verses.
[2:17:42] Amen. Before we do that, let's just ask
[2:17:44] the Lord to bless. Father, won't you
[2:17:48] take your word now, Lord, as we
[2:17:51] exit 2025?
[2:17:53] We want to we want to enter 2026
[2:17:57] with a word of victory in our hearts,
[2:18:01] with a a testimony, oh God, that 2025
[2:18:05] was was a stepping stone. And now as we
[2:18:09] move into 2026, Lord, all we want to
[2:18:11] know is your leadership, your guidance,
[2:18:14] your vision, the vision that you have
[2:18:17] placed and given to this ministry that
[2:18:20] started many, many, many years ago.
[2:18:22] Father, Lord, you started this ministry.
[2:18:26] You will take us right through and into
[2:18:29] the rapture. That is what we believe.
[2:18:32] And this is the word that we are feeding
[2:18:35] on in this day and in this hour. It's
[2:18:38] the rapture
[2:18:39] message word of God for this day. May
[2:18:44] you just bless us now as we read your
[2:18:47] word. Inspire our hearts. We love you.
[2:18:50] We appreciate you in Jesus Christ's
[2:18:52] name. Amen.
[2:18:55] Joshua chapter 14
[2:18:57] from verse 6 it says then the children
[2:18:59] of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal and
[2:19:03] Caleb the son of Japun
[2:19:07] the Kennesite said unto him thou knowest
[2:19:11] the thing that the Lord said unto Moses
[2:19:14] the man of God concerning me and thee in
[2:19:18] Kadesh Barnea.
[2:19:21] 40 years old was I when Moses, the
[2:19:23] servant of the Lord, sent me from Kadesh
[2:19:26] Barnea to aspy out the land, and I
[2:19:30] brought him word again as it was in mine
[2:19:33] heart.
[2:19:35] Next slide. Nevertheless, my brethren,
[2:19:39] that went up with me made the heart of
[2:19:42] the people melt,
[2:19:44] but I wholly followed the Lord my God.
[2:19:48] Nevertheless, my brethren that went up
[2:19:51] with me made the heart of the people
[2:19:52] melt. But I wholly followed the Lord my
[2:19:57] God. And Moses swore on that day,
[2:20:01] saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet
[2:20:04] have trotten shall be thine inheritance,
[2:20:06] and thy childrens forever, because thou
[2:20:09] has wholly followed the Lord my God.
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; Next slide. And now, behold,
[2:20:18] the Lord hath kept me alive,
[2:20:21] as he said, these 40 and five years,
[2:20:24] ever since the Lord spake this word unto
[2:20:27] Moses, while the children of Israel
[2:20:30] wandered in the wilderness. And now, lo,
[2:20:33] I am this day four score and five years
[2:20:37] old. He's 85 years old.
[2:20:40] As yet I am as strong this day as I was
[2:20:44] in the day that Moses sent me.
[2:20:47] &gt;&gt; As my strength was then, even so is my
[2:20:51] strength now
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; for war both to go out and to come in.
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; And he goes on and he says next slide.
[2:21:01] How therefore give me this mountain
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; whereof the Lord spake in that day that
[2:21:08] thou that thou heardest in that day how
[2:21:10] the Anakans were there and that the
[2:21:13] cities were great and fenced. If so be
[2:21:17] the Lord will be with me, then I shall
[2:21:21] be able to drive them out
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; as the Lord said. And Joshua blessed him
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; and gave unto Caleb the son of Japun
[2:21:34] Hebron
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; for an inheritance.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; The Lord add his blessings to the word
[2:21:38] of God. You may be seated.
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; Today I want to talk to you and I want
[2:21:46] to title this. Go to the next slide.
[2:21:48] Give me my mountain
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; 2025.
[2:21:55] is over. Yes, sir.
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; But I am as strong today as I was when I
[2:22:02] started this race.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; And I'm not afraid to enter 2026.
[2:22:08] And I want to go into 2026 with one
[2:22:12] attitude, with one vision, with one
[2:22:15] thought. Give me my mountain.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; Give me my possession. Give me my
[2:22:23] portion. Whatever portion of the word
[2:22:26] that you've ordained for me from before
[2:22:29] the foundations of the world, this is
[2:22:31] not a church where you just join today.
[2:22:35] This is where you come and you hear the
[2:22:37] word of the Lord telling you that you
[2:22:39] were with him before the foundations of
[2:22:42] the world, but it's now your time to
[2:22:44] take your part in the word of God.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; It's now your time to take your
[2:22:50] mountain. You know, Sister Jennifer and
[2:22:53] I have come to these watch services for
[2:22:56] many years. This is, you know, the 31st
[2:22:59] year that we've been serving the Lord.
[2:23:02] And we've come to many of these watch
[2:23:04] services. And we all look back at the
[2:23:08] many trials. And you know, every time
[2:23:10] that we would come to the watch service,
[2:23:13] I I remember I' I'd be so excited
[2:23:16] because I wanted to hear what the Lord
[2:23:18] was going to do for us as we enter into
[2:23:21] the next year. And every year
[2:23:24] we thought would be the last year
[2:23:28] &gt;&gt; and we'd be listening to the Lord to,
[2:23:29] you know, to because God was so real in
[2:23:33] our experience. And let me tell you,
[2:23:35] he's just as real and more real to me
[2:23:38] today and I know to you that that have
[2:23:40] experienced him. Amen. He's more real to
[2:23:44] me today than he's ever been.
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; Why? Because his word keeps unveiling
[2:23:50] itself.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; He keeps revealing himself
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; to me.
[2:23:56] not not uh you know showing me you know
[2:24:00] religious doctrines and no I'm talking
[2:24:03] about an experience where you've you're
[2:24:05] walking with God.
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; It's a reality
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; and you're getting stronger in the Lord
[2:24:11] because you know the promises of God.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; You know back in Numbers chapter 13,
[2:24:17] we're talking about Caleb today. Amen.
[2:24:20] And you know that you're a type of
[2:24:21] Caleb. Amen.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; Joshua and Caleb, Christ and the bride.
[2:24:25] Amen. He was under that leadership.
[2:24:28] Caleb goes to Joshua says, "Give me my
[2:24:30] portion of the land." Amen. And that's
[2:24:32] and and and we're and we're in that
[2:24:34] relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:24:36] in this hour. Amen. And but here back in
[2:24:39] Numbers 13
[2:24:41] verse 22 to 24, I just got it written
[2:24:44] here. He says, "Because all those men
[2:24:47] which have seen my now here's um uh
[2:24:52] the scripture verse 22 because all those
[2:24:54] men which have seen my glory and my
[2:24:57] miracles which I did in Egypt and in the
[2:25:00] wilderness and have tempted me," this is
[2:25:03] the Lord speaking now these 10 times and
[2:25:06] have not hearkened to my voice. There's
[2:25:10] people that that that they they just
[2:25:12] don't they can't hear the word of God.
[2:25:15] They rebel against the word of God. But
[2:25:17] I want you to notice something about
[2:25:19] Caleb. Amen. Surely they see surely they
[2:25:24] shall not see the land which I swear
[2:25:26] unto their fathers. Neither shall any of
[2:25:29] them that provoke me see it. Okay? They
[2:25:33] didn't believe God. They didn't believe
[2:25:36] that God that God's prophet Moses what
[2:25:39] everything that he said God was going to
[2:25:41] do.
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; When God told Moses, "I'm going to give
[2:25:44] you the land." God meant what he said.
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; And when God sent us a prophet in the
[2:25:49] 20th century to tell us that he's going
[2:25:52] TO GIVE US BACK our land, that he's
[2:25:54] going to restore our hearts back to the
[2:25:56] word, there was people that that that
[2:25:59] didn't accept it.
[2:26:01] But listen here. He says, he says, "But
[2:26:05] my servant Caleb, because he had another
[2:26:08] spirit with him."
[2:26:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Let me tell you, if
[2:26:13] you can recognize this word for this
[2:26:15] hour, it's because you've got a
[2:26:17] different spirit in you.
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Him will I bring into the land
[2:26:24] where where where into he went, and his
[2:26:26] seed shall possess it.
[2:26:30] That's God's promise
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; because Caleb was was of a different
[2:26:34] spirit. Caleb Caleb followed the Lord
[2:26:37] holy.
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; He fully believed what God said. When
[2:26:42] those spies went into uh you know
[2:26:44] Jericho and they seen all those giants,
[2:26:46] all they could see was the giants.
[2:26:49] But Caleb heard what the Lord had told
[2:26:53] Moses. He said, "I'm going to give you
[2:26:55] that land. That's your inheritance.
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN STOP YOU from
[2:27:02] receiving WHAT GOD SAYS YOU ARE to
[2:27:05] become and you are to possess.
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; You may not have fully possessed it in
[2:27:12] 2025, but you can you can be assured if
[2:27:15] you stay holy
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; and believing unto the Lord, he's going
[2:27:20] to make it happen. HE'S GOING TO GIVE
[2:27:22] YOU THAT MOUNTAIN. AMEN. Caleb did not
[2:27:25] ask for the easy mountain. It was
[2:27:27] Hebron.
[2:27:29] &gt;&gt; Hebron was was the one that that where
[2:27:31] all the giants were.
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; Listen, you might enter into 2026 facing
[2:27:37] some some definite giants.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; But don't look at the giants.
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; You you you you let the giants know I'm
[2:27:45] as strong today. I'm stronger today than
[2:27:48] I ever was because of what God has put
[2:27:50] in me by the word of God of this hour.
[2:27:54] Amen.
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; The Lord knew what kind of spirit was in
[2:27:57] Caleb.
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; That's why he called him. That's why he
[2:28:01] says, "You're going to get your
[2:28:03] possession." Amen. He knew he would have
[2:28:05] to face the end time. He knew that he
[2:28:08] would have to face the fullness of
[2:28:10] iniquity. He knew that he would have to
[2:28:13] face the the the the great giants, that
[2:28:16] he would have to overcome those giants.
[2:28:19] But he knew that God was with him. Amen.
[2:28:22] It was a test of faith and going into
[2:28:25] 2026 will be a test of your faith
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; to accomplish everything that God
[2:28:32] promised you.
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; Everything that he's shown you in the
[2:28:35] word that you are, you will have.
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't want to believe any
[2:28:44] evil reports.
[2:28:47] We don't want to be distracted by the
[2:28:49] evil reports that are that are being
[2:28:51] spoken
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; even in the midst of this message. We're
[2:28:55] not interested in the evil reports.
[2:28:57] We're we're we're we're interested in
[2:28:59] the true report.
[2:29:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. We're not interested
[2:29:04] in the in in being identified with the
[2:29:06] evil reports because what does an evil
[2:29:08] report do? It weakens you. Amen.
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; When you listen to the devil, you listen
[2:29:13] to the lies, you listen to to uh you
[2:29:16] know, all the different interpretations,
[2:29:18] you listen to the word of God,
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; you stay loyal to the spirit of God.
[2:29:24] &gt;&gt; You let the Holy Ghost that led you here
[2:29:27] lead you the rest of the way. Amen.
[2:29:29] Glory to God.
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; God sees differently than we do.
[2:29:35] &gt;&gt; True. you see, you know, giants
[2:29:37] sometimes, cancer or heart failure or OR
[2:29:42] DIABETES OR BUT GOD doesn't see it in
[2:29:44] that way. In the book of Isaiah 40 verse
[2:29:48] 21-23,
[2:29:50] he says, "Have ye not known? Have ye not
[2:29:52] heard? Hath it not being told you from
[2:29:55] the beginning? Have ye not understood
[2:29:57] from the foundations of the earth? It is
[2:30:00] he that siteth upon the circle of the
[2:30:02] earth, and the inhabitants thereof are
[2:30:05] as grasshoppers.
[2:30:08] &gt;&gt; Those cancers, THOSE HEART SITUATIONS,
[2:30:12] YEAH, THEY'RE REAL.
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; BUT ARE YOU GOING to are you going to
[2:30:15] believe the doctor's report? Are you
[2:30:16] going to believe the true report?
[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; You can't leave here unless God says
[2:30:22] you're coming home. Amen.
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that can stop you from
[2:30:27] accomplishing what God purposed in you
[2:30:31] &gt;&gt; from before the foundations of the
[2:30:33] world.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. THAT STRETCHETH OUT
[2:30:38] THE HEAVENS as a curtain, and spreadth
[2:30:40] them out as a tent to dwell in. That
[2:30:43] bringeth the princes to nothing. He
[2:30:46] maketh the judges of the earth as
[2:30:48] vanity.
[2:30:50] We don't need to look at the giants. We
[2:30:53] don't need to be afraid of any giants.
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; We're going to move into 2026 with one
[2:30:59] thing, and that is I believe God.
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; I believe what he says about me is going
[2:31:06] to come to pass.
[2:31:07] &gt;&gt; I believe every promise in the book is
[2:31:09] mine.
[2:31:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not going to let fear
[2:31:12] rob me from my mountain.
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; No, sir. Fear is false evidence. It
[2:31:18] appears real, but it's false.
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Caleb had spiritual strength.
[2:31:24] There's a big difference. There's
[2:31:26] Listen, there might have been a lot of
[2:31:28] people that were stronger than Caleb. He
[2:31:31] was 85 years old, but his strength was
[2:31:34] not so much physical. It was spiritual
[2:31:37] strength.
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; And one man with God is supernatural.
[2:31:42] &gt;&gt; I don't care how weak, you know. Oh,
[2:31:44] brother, I'm getting older. I'm feeling
[2:31:46] weaker. Listen, that's fine. Your body
[2:31:48] might get weaker, but God didn't get any
[2:31:51] weaker.
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; His power is yet the same.
[2:31:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Holy Ghost, he he's the same
[2:31:58] yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:32:01] &gt;&gt; Your strength is spiritual strength.
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; Your strength is in the word of God.
[2:32:05] Amen. At 85, there would there would
[2:32:08] have been many that were stronger, but
[2:32:10] he had a strength believing God. Caleb
[2:32:13] was not afraid of adversity. Why?
[2:32:16] Because he believed God.
[2:32:19] &gt;&gt; We're going into 2026 believing God is
[2:32:22] going to accomplish what he started in
[2:32:24] our lives.
[2:32:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even you even you young people go
[2:32:29] back and read Jeremiah 1 6 to7 and he he
[2:32:35] told the young people that they could be
[2:32:38] victorious.
[2:32:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Does God doesn't look at age.
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; Yes. God's not interested in looking at
[2:32:44] young. God's not interested in looking
[2:32:46] at old. God's interested in knowing
[2:32:48] whether you're going to believe his word
[2:32:51] &gt;&gt; and what he said he's going to do for
[2:32:53] you.
[2:32:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Caleb was of a
[2:32:57] different spirit. He looked back over
[2:32:59] the 40 years of the many children of
[2:33:01] Israel that were falling in the
[2:33:02] wilderness.
[2:33:04] But he had a promise that was still in
[2:33:07] his heart. He was still looking at that
[2:33:09] mountain. He still had his eyes on that
[2:33:12] mountain regardless of those that were
[2:33:14] falling to his left or falling to his
[2:33:16] right.
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; It didn't matter. Listen, there's going
[2:33:20] to be people that are going to come into
[2:33:21] this church and there's going to be
[2:33:22] people that are going to leave the
[2:33:24] church.
[2:33:25] &gt;&gt; But that doesn't change the plan of God
[2:33:27] and the purpose of God. And if you are
[2:33:30] anchored by the revelation of God's
[2:33:32] word, you're not going anywhere.
[2:33:34] &gt;&gt; You're listening for his word.
[2:33:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. Not every
[2:33:41] person will overcome. And we need to
[2:33:43] understand that.
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; God adds to the church such as should be
[2:33:49] saved.
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[2:33:54] But he's still Hebrews 12
[2:33:57] verses 1 to2. Author and the finisher of
[2:34:00] our faith.
[2:34:02] &gt;&gt; So what do we got to do for 2026?
[2:34:05] We need to keep our eyes on the finish
[2:34:07] line.
[2:34:08] We need to keep our eyes on the promises
[2:34:10] of God.
[2:34:11] &gt;&gt; We need to look at 2026 in a different
[2:34:14] way. Amen. Glory to God. Let's go to um
[2:34:18] uh our next slide here.
[2:34:22] Revelations 2
[2:34:25] 17 says, "He that hath an ear, let him
[2:34:29] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[2:34:31] churches.
[2:34:33] To him that overcomemeth will I give to
[2:34:36] eat of the hidden mana, and will give
[2:34:40] him a white stone, and in the stone a
[2:34:44] new name, which no man knoweth, saving
[2:34:46] he that receiveth it.
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; Listen, you are going to have to
[2:34:52] overcome. As long as you are here,
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; you're going to have to overcome.
[2:34:59] And you need to understand the day that
[2:35:02] you're living in.
[2:35:04] &gt;&gt; You need to understand the word that's
[2:35:05] been ordained to your age.
[2:35:09] &gt;&gt; And this is the capstone age.
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; This is the age where Christ comes down
[2:35:16] to meet with his body.
[2:35:19] &gt;&gt; And you recognizing that can only happen
[2:35:24] by spiritual revelation.
[2:35:26] It's not going to come to you by
[2:35:28] knowledge.
[2:35:30] &gt;&gt; That's why overcoming in this hour gives
[2:35:33] you the ability to receive revelation to
[2:35:37] overcome. As you overcome, revelation
[2:35:41] comes because God has started a work in
[2:35:45] your life that he's going to finish.
[2:35:47] &gt;&gt; That's why the scripture says to him
[2:35:50] that overcomemeth will I give to eat the
[2:35:53] hidden mana. What is the hidden mana?
[2:35:55] It's the revelation of his word.
[2:35:58] &gt;&gt; It's what he is going to do in you.
[2:36:03] Hallelujah. And it's a and and and when
[2:36:06] brother Brandham, you know, you you may
[2:36:08] be you might remember when brother
[2:36:09] Brandham uh you know had uh brother
[2:36:13] Junior Jackson come to him about the
[2:36:16] dream that he had about you know they
[2:36:19] were at the top of this mountain and and
[2:36:22] there was a there was a big rock and and
[2:36:25] brother Brandham was standing and they
[2:36:28] were all looking over into that white
[2:36:30] rock but there was nothing written in
[2:36:32] the white shock.
[2:36:35] &gt;&gt; But brother Brham
[2:36:37] was was ordained to bring the revelation
[2:36:42] of what was in that white rock
[2:36:46] &gt;&gt; to the children of God
[2:36:48] &gt;&gt; in this day and in this hour.
[2:36:51] &gt;&gt; And that rock, that white stone is your
[2:36:57] mountain,
[2:36:59] &gt;&gt; is your portion of the word. It's who
[2:37:02] you are in this day and in this hour.
[2:37:06] &gt;&gt; Listen here. He goes on, read the quote
[2:37:09] here. He says in the Pergamian church
[2:37:11] age, it also says here that he is going
[2:37:14] to give the overcomer a white stone
[2:37:19] and in not on
[2:37:22] but the stone a new name
[2:37:26] &gt;&gt; which the owner alone knows.
[2:37:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. The reason why you are an
[2:37:32] overcomer and the reason why you can
[2:37:34] overcome
[2:37:36] whatever you're going to face in 2026
[2:37:39] is because you were written in the
[2:37:43] lamb's book of life. Your name was
[2:37:46] placed there. Amen.
[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; And when that stone
[2:37:51] on the top of the mountain,
[2:37:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:53] &gt;&gt; when
[2:37:56] &gt;&gt; the top was taken off
[2:37:58] and the mighty angel came down in 1963,
[2:38:02] he was coming to call the names that
[2:38:05] were written in those stones,
[2:38:09] &gt;&gt; IN THAT WHITE STONE. AMEN. THAT'S WHAT'S
[2:38:11] THAT'S WHAT'S THUNDERING OUT RIGHT NOW.
[2:38:13] That's the word that you're receiving
[2:38:16] right now.
[2:38:17] That's why that's what identifies this
[2:38:21] church.
[2:38:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:38:22] &gt;&gt; That's what makes us who we are
[2:38:25] &gt;&gt; and who you are
[2:38:27] &gt;&gt; is because your name is written on a
[2:38:30] stone. And the stone is the revelation
[2:38:34] of God's word.
[2:38:36] &gt;&gt; And you're one of those stones that was
[2:38:38] placed into the capstone.
[2:38:42] You're one of the ones that has to
[2:38:44] receive your portion of the mountain.
[2:38:48] &gt;&gt; You're one of the ones that that that by
[2:38:50] revelation, you're going to come to know
[2:38:53] who you are.
[2:38:54] &gt;&gt; And you're going to recognize this
[2:38:56] message because your name is being
[2:38:59] called through the word that's being now
[2:39:03] ministered through the capstone
[2:39:05] ministry.
[2:39:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now listen, he goes on. He says,
[2:39:09] "Now the idea of a new name is a
[2:39:12] familiar one. Abraham was changed or
[2:39:16] Abram was changed to Abraham." Notice
[2:39:19] the change of name. God has a purpose
[2:39:23] when he calls your real name. Your real
[2:39:26] name is under the message of this hour.
[2:39:30] &gt;&gt; That's where your strength lies under
[2:39:32] the message of this hour. It's not under
[2:39:35] a uh you know denominational teaching
[2:39:39] message that's never going to call you.
[2:39:43] That's never going to give you the
[2:39:45] overcoming power that you need to be
[2:39:47] victorious as a son or a daughter of God
[2:39:50] in this day or this hour.
[2:39:52] You're going to need the revelation that
[2:39:55] was that was under those seven seals
[2:39:58] that are being revealed now
[2:40:00] &gt;&gt; in these last days by the preaching of
[2:40:03] the word. And he goes on to say here, he
[2:40:07] says, "Now Abram was changed to Abraham,
[2:40:09] Sarai to Sarah, Jacob to Israel, Simon
[2:40:14] to Peter, and Saul to Paul." These names
[2:40:19] either brought about a change or were
[2:40:22] given because of a change. It it was
[2:40:26] only after Abram and Sarai had their
[2:40:29] names changed by the Lord that they were
[2:40:32] made ready to receive the coming son.
[2:40:36] Until you've heard your name
[2:40:40] &gt;&gt; under the message of this hour
[2:40:43] &gt;&gt; through the opening of the seven seals,
[2:40:46] you are just a churchgoer.
[2:40:51] &gt;&gt; You're not identified as a son of God.
[2:40:55] &gt;&gt; You're not identified as a daughter of
[2:40:57] God.
[2:40:59] only by the revelation
[2:41:01] of you hearing and recognizing what God
[2:41:04] is doing in this day.
[2:41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:07] &gt;&gt; What God has already done in sending us
[2:41:09] a prophet to the 20th century.
[2:41:12] &gt;&gt; You cannot leave out William Brham in
[2:41:15] your experience.
[2:41:17] You need to recognize what God has done
[2:41:21] through William Miriam Branham
[2:41:25] &gt;&gt; because the word that's been coming
[2:41:27] forth is the word that was sealed up in
[2:41:30] the white stone.
[2:41:33] &gt;&gt; It was the unwritten part of the word.
[2:41:36] It was the element that that Satan would
[2:41:38] not be able to impersonate
[2:41:43] &gt;&gt; all THE OTHER LISTEN EVERYTHING ELSE OUT
[2:41:45] THERE THAT YOU KNOW ALL THESE DIFFERENT
[2:41:47] denominational teachings and you know
[2:41:49] it's all impersonations
[2:41:53] &gt;&gt; taking the word of God and making it of
[2:41:55] none effect to the people
[2:41:57] &gt;&gt; but when the real true
[2:42:00] revelation comes into the heart of a son
[2:42:03] or a daughter of God they can never be
[2:42:05] the same.
[2:42:08] &gt;&gt; Their name has been called
[2:42:11] &gt;&gt; and they go through a change.
[2:42:14] &gt;&gt; Abraham, right after his name was
[2:42:16] changed from Abram to Abraham AND SARAI
[2:42:20] TO SARAH, they were now in a position to
[2:42:23] receive the coming son.
[2:42:26] &gt;&gt; And until your name has been changed by
[2:42:29] hearing this word, this message, this
[2:42:31] revelation, hallelujah. Let's read on.
[2:42:35] In Jacob's case, next slide,
[2:42:38] he had to overcome and then he was
[2:42:41] called a prince. In the case of Simon
[2:42:44] and Saul, when they had received the
[2:42:46] Lord, their change came. And today, each
[2:42:50] one of us true believers has had a
[2:42:54] change in name.
[2:42:57] You may not have changed your natural
[2:42:59] name,
[2:43:01] but to your friends and your family,
[2:43:02] when you receive the new birth under
[2:43:05] this revelation,
[2:43:07] you're not the same person. You might as
[2:43:10] well have a different name.
[2:43:12] &gt;&gt; They don't I had people coming to me
[2:43:13] says, "Who are you?
[2:43:16] You're not the Danny that we knew."
[2:43:19] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:43:21] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it was a new birth. Amen.
[2:43:25] &gt;&gt; The old has passed away.
[2:43:28] &gt;&gt; And that experience has to be a reality
[2:43:31] to every single one of us if we're going
[2:43:33] to enter 2026
[2:43:36] with any kind of strength
[2:43:38] &gt;&gt; and and and have the same testimony as
[2:43:41] Caleb. Amen. He says here, he goes on,
[2:43:44] we are Christians. It is a name common
[2:43:47] to all of us, but one day we will have
[2:43:50] another change. We will of certainty
[2:43:54] receive a new name. It could well be the
[2:43:57] name was our true and original name
[2:44:00] written in the lamb's book of life.
[2:44:03] &gt;&gt; You see, that's what you're hearing in
[2:44:05] this message. That's what you're hearing
[2:44:07] when you're when when when you identify
[2:44:09] yourself with this ministry, this end
[2:44:12] time ministry. Oh, people talking that
[2:44:16] God sent a prophet and opening of seven
[2:44:19] seals and uh you know revelation of the
[2:44:22] seven church ages and the church
[2:44:24] history. Yes. All of those things were
[2:44:28] the elements of the mysteries that were
[2:44:31] under those seven seals. Amen.
[2:44:34] &gt;&gt; And when the prophet was told to go to
[2:44:38] Jeffersonville because those seven seals
[2:44:41] were going to be open and he preached
[2:44:43] those seven nights in a row, God was
[2:44:47] unveiling and opening all the mysteries
[2:44:51] that the world they were they were
[2:44:54] talking about it, but they were confused
[2:44:56] in the Godhead. They were confused about
[2:44:58] the white horse rider. All the things,
[2:45:02] all the symbols that were brought out by
[2:45:04] the opening of those those seals
[2:45:07] had to be fully interpreted by the
[2:45:10] opening of the
[2:45:13] &gt;&gt; part of the word that that has your name
[2:45:16] written on it.
[2:45:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. In it.
[2:45:21] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. THAT'S THE PART THAT HAS
[2:45:23] awakened you in this day and in this
[2:45:25] hour. And that's the element that's
[2:45:27] going to give you strength.
[2:45:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the only way that you're going
[2:45:31] to overcome in 2026,
[2:45:35] &gt;&gt; those that overcame in 2025
[2:45:37] recognized their time, their season,
[2:45:41] &gt;&gt; and they're pressing on and they're
[2:45:43] moving on.
[2:45:44] &gt;&gt; They're moving on with the same God.
[2:45:47] &gt;&gt; The same one that's been feeding us all
[2:45:50] over the years going back to when when
[2:45:52] we come when we come under brother John
[2:45:54] Simon under that ministry. He's the same
[2:45:58] God that's still preaching to us today
[2:46:01] &gt;&gt; by revelation.
[2:46:04] &gt;&gt; Calling our names in the white stone.
[2:46:08] &gt;&gt; Our names were written in the lambs. But
[2:46:10] he knows the name but we do not. But one
[2:46:14] day at his good pleasure we will know
[2:46:18] also.
[2:46:20] &gt;&gt; We'll know exactly who we are.
[2:46:22] &gt;&gt; We'll be we'll we'll we'll we'll know as
[2:46:25] we are known. Amen. Praise God. But
[2:46:27] right now, all I know is that I'm a son
[2:46:29] of God.
[2:46:31] &gt;&gt; I am not a a a a churchgoer.
[2:46:35] &gt;&gt; I'm not a denominational uh Christian.
[2:46:39] &gt;&gt; I don't belong to to denominational
[2:46:41] church. I belong to the mystical body of
[2:46:44] Jesus Christ.
[2:46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are sons and daughters of God.
[2:46:49] We've been awakened. Our name has been
[2:46:51] called by the opening of the word. Amen.
[2:46:53] Glory to God. Hallelujah. Here in uh in
[2:46:58] let's go to the next slide
[2:47:01] as we close here. I just you know the
[2:47:05] the thought that I'm trying to bring out
[2:47:07] here tonight is that we are of the of
[2:47:11] the tribe of Caleb.
[2:47:14] &gt;&gt; We are of that
[2:47:17] understanding that revelation. Hebron.
[2:47:19] He was given Hebrron because Hebron was
[2:47:22] the mountain where Abraham that was the
[2:47:24] that was the the the the the the city
[2:47:26] that Abraham was looking for. It was the
[2:47:29] place where God gave him the promises
[2:47:31] and said, "Look at all the stars and all
[2:47:33] the all the ground that you it's all
[2:47:35] yours. It's all your inheritance."
[2:47:39] &gt;&gt; I want us to understand that we are not
[2:47:42] of this world. We are not of
[2:47:44] denominational
[2:47:45] teaching and understanding on the word
[2:47:47] of God. We're not uh you know uh just
[2:47:50] people that that that that are
[2:47:51] churchgoers.
[2:47:54] We are the word for this day and for
[2:47:58] this hour.
[2:48:00] &gt;&gt; We are the word being made flesh
[2:48:02] &gt;&gt; to to 2026.
[2:48:06] &gt;&gt; We are the ones that carry the word. He
[2:48:08] says he says whatever you bind on EARTH
[2:48:11] SHALL BE BOUND IN HEAVEN.
[2:48:13] &gt;&gt; Whatever you loose on earth shall be
[2:48:15] loosed in heaven.
[2:48:17] We're the ones that have been given the
[2:48:19] open book
[2:48:20] &gt;&gt; TO TO TO PROPHESY again
[2:48:24] &gt;&gt; to take that word that was that was
[2:48:26] delivered unto us
[2:48:28] &gt;&gt; by the word of God through a vindicated
[2:48:31] prophet
[2:48:32] &gt;&gt; and we are now the the the voice of God
[2:48:34] in these last days. We're Caleb.
[2:48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48:37] &gt;&gt; We're we're we're of that spirit.
[2:48:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:48:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:48:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48:46] Now, as we close here, I want I want you
[2:48:48] to pay attention here
[2:48:51] in this quote from 1962.
[2:48:56] It was December the 31st.
[2:49:00] And you need to understand William Brham
[2:49:02] at that time had been given the vision.
[2:49:05] Sir, is this the time? This was when he
[2:49:08] had been given the vision to go and open
[2:49:11] those seven seals
[2:49:13] &gt;&gt; that the that he would be the angel on
[2:49:15] earth and the mighty angel Christ
[2:49:17] himself was going to come down to open
[2:49:19] those seals. It wasn't William Brandham
[2:49:21] that opened the seals.
[2:49:23] &gt;&gt; Let me make that clear.
[2:49:25] &gt;&gt; He was the angel, the messenger, the
[2:49:29] voice, the vessel that the mighty angel
[2:49:32] was going to speak through.
[2:49:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. in order to open those seals
[2:49:37] and to release the mysteries that were
[2:49:40] under those seals.
[2:49:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:49:42] &gt;&gt; And then it was to be conveyed into a
[2:49:45] people
[2:49:47] &gt;&gt; that would recognize him and understand.
[2:49:50] That's why in Revelations 10:8 to 11,
[2:49:56] &gt;&gt; John was told to go and take the book.
[2:49:58] John is a type of the bride.
[2:50:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. The mighty angel came down
[2:50:03] with the open book.
[2:50:04] &gt;&gt; It was the book that had been sealed and
[2:50:07] now it had been opened.
[2:50:08] &gt;&gt; He had come to redeem, to call the names
[2:50:12] of the sons and daughters of God.
[2:50:14] &gt;&gt; And so here now he recognizes that
[2:50:17] something is going to take place. And he
[2:50:20] says, "Heavenly Father, as we stand
[2:50:22] here, as many thoughts is dying out in
[2:50:26] our hearts and of the mistakes of the
[2:50:29] last year, and as we're approaching the
[2:50:32] death of 1962,
[2:50:34] you can replace that with 2025."
[2:50:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:50:38] &gt;&gt; And the birth of 1963,
[2:50:41] &gt;&gt; you can replace that with 2026.
[2:50:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh God, may we be one step higher,
[2:50:48] the ladder until we can see Jesus and
[2:50:51] his program.
[2:50:53] &gt;&gt; May everyone here, Lord, in prayer while
[2:50:56] the old year is dying and the new birth
[2:51:00] of the new year is coming in. May the
[2:51:03] old man's sin and unbelief die out in
[2:51:07] our heart and the new birth
[2:51:11] &gt;&gt; come
[2:51:12] &gt;&gt; in with the 1963 like a rushing mighty
[2:51:16] wind. May 2026 come in like a mighty
[2:51:20] rushing wind
[2:51:21] &gt;&gt; into our hearts.
[2:51:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. A new birth like a mighty rushing
[2:51:26] wind that might fill our being and make
[2:51:30] us new creatures in Christ.
[2:51:33] Hallelujah.
[2:51:34] &gt;&gt; Are you looking to to to to press on
[2:51:38] into 2026
[2:51:40] &gt;&gt; and be victorious and have the same
[2:51:42] attitude that Caleb had? Give me my
[2:51:44] mountain.
[2:51:46] &gt;&gt; Give me my portion of the word.
[2:51:49] &gt;&gt; Give me my Give me my promise in the
[2:51:52] word of God. Listen, whatever whatever
[2:51:54] portion of the word you are, whatever
[2:51:56] part that you are under this ministry,
[2:52:00] &gt;&gt; this is our ministry. This is the
[2:52:02] portion where God has placed you. God
[2:52:04] has placed you here under this ministry.
[2:52:08] &gt;&gt; God has placed me here under this
[2:52:10] ministry.
[2:52:11] &gt;&gt; We're here for a purpose.
[2:52:14] &gt;&gt; We're here to fulfill God's plan and
[2:52:17] take this word
[2:52:20] wherever it needs to go so that we can
[2:52:22] be the voice to this last generation
[2:52:25] &gt;&gt; because there's there's there's one more
[2:52:28] out there that that that needs to come
[2:52:30] in. When the last one comes in, we go.
[2:52:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:52:35] &gt;&gt; And he goes on and he he says here in
[2:52:38] the next slide, he says, "Make us fit
[2:52:40] servants."
[2:52:42] &gt;&gt; Forgive our past.
[2:52:44] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:52:45] &gt;&gt; you got to let go of your past.
[2:52:48] &gt;&gt; You got to say, Lord, I I'm I'm leaving
[2:52:51] 2025 mistakes and problems and
[2:52:54] everything I did wrong. I'm leaving it
[2:52:55] in 2025
[2:52:57] &gt;&gt; and I'm moving on.
[2:52:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:53:00] Lord God, with thy mighty hand Jehovah,
[2:53:03] bless these ministers here.
[2:53:06] &gt;&gt; Bless all the leoty, all the visitors.
[2:53:09] Be thou with us, Lord. We are your
[2:53:12] servants.
[2:53:14] &gt;&gt; And we give ourselves holy to you for
[2:53:18] 2026.
[2:53:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:53:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that the power of your
[2:53:24] spirit might have more preeminence
[2:53:27] &gt;&gt; in our life
[2:53:29] &gt;&gt; and in our being.
[2:53:31] &gt;&gt; Help us
[2:53:33] &gt;&gt; help us, God. Forgive us.
[2:53:36] &gt;&gt; Uh and help us, WE PRAY. RAISE UP mighty
[2:53:39] men.
[2:53:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You young men in here,
[2:53:43] listen. God's going to use you.
[2:53:45] &gt;&gt; There's a reason why you're here.
[2:53:48] &gt;&gt; There's a reason why you're hearing this
[2:53:50] message. There's a reason why it
[2:53:52] thunders in your heart.
[2:53:54] &gt;&gt; It's because you're you there's a
[2:53:56] portion OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT'S YOURS and
[2:53:59] you need to say, "Give me my mountain.
[2:54:01] &gt;&gt; Give me my part of the word." Amen.
[2:54:03] Glory to God. Raise up mighty men. Raise
[2:54:06] up mighty warriors
[2:54:08] &gt;&gt; of the faith.
[2:54:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54:10] &gt;&gt; Warriors of the revelation. Amen.
[2:54:13] &gt;&gt; Warriors that are going to take this
[2:54:16] message
[2:54:17] &gt;&gt; and and they're going to have courage to
[2:54:20] stand with this word
[2:54:23] to move on with the revelation of this
[2:54:25] hour.
[2:54:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54:27] &gt;&gt; To allow the word to come and and and
[2:54:30] mold and shape us and and and deal with
[2:54:33] us.
[2:54:35] If you are one of those stones, you got
[2:54:37] to be shaped. You got to be uh you know
[2:54:39] uh molded. You've got to let the the the
[2:54:42] the stonemason work things out in your
[2:54:45] life.
[2:54:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54:46] &gt;&gt; And where does it start? Right here in
[2:54:48] the house of the Lord.
[2:54:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54:52] &gt;&gt; Let 2026 be a year that I'm going to be
[2:54:55] in the house of the Lord whenever I can
[2:54:57] be there.
[2:54:58] &gt;&gt; Because that's where I can receive
[2:55:00] strength.
[2:55:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:55:02] &gt;&gt; By the word of God.
[2:55:04] &gt;&gt; I believe in the five-fold ministry.
[2:55:07] &gt;&gt; I'm going to stand with the five-fold
[2:55:09] ministry. Amen.
[2:55:10] &gt;&gt; I'm going to believe that that God, he's
[2:55:13] he's he's alive. He's he's with his
[2:55:16] people. He's he he's dealing with with
[2:55:19] us on a daily basis. We're not we're not
[2:55:22] going to be playing church.
[2:55:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:55:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:55:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:55:28] &gt;&gt; We're going to go into 2026
[2:55:32] &gt;&gt; differently.
[2:55:33] And he says here, "Open this year, Lord,
[2:55:36] that hidden mana,
[2:55:39] that rock beneath the rock,
[2:55:42] &gt;&gt; that we might see the program of God."
[2:55:45] &gt;&gt; Are you interested in the program of
[2:55:47] God?
[2:55:48] &gt;&gt; You want to know what God's going to
[2:55:50] Listen, he's not stopped. A lot of
[2:55:54] people want to just say, "Oh, you just
[2:55:56] need to press play and obey. Just just
[2:55:59] say what the tapes say.
[2:56:01] just play the tapes in your church. Uh
[2:56:04] that you don't really need, you know, if
[2:56:06] the pastor is going to come up, he just
[2:56:08] needs to comment on what's already been
[2:56:10] said.
[2:56:12] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no. That's not what he
[2:56:14] says here. He says, "Lord, open up this
[2:56:17] year, Lord, that hidden mana,
[2:56:20] &gt;&gt; that rock beneath the rock that we might
[2:56:23] see the program of God." HE SAYS, "CAP
[2:56:26] CAP OFF THE PYRAMIDS in our life."
[2:56:30] There's a part of you THAT FITS INTO
[2:56:34] THAT MOUNTAIN.
[2:56:36] &gt;&gt; And you need to find out what part of
[2:56:37] that mountain you are.
[2:56:40] &gt;&gt; You're not a parrot.
[2:56:44] &gt;&gt; You're a son of God.
[2:56:46] &gt;&gt; You're a daughter of God. You've been
[2:56:47] given the word Christ. HE SAYS, "CAP OFF
[2:56:50] THE THE pyramids of our life, Lord. Put
[2:56:52] the capstone Christ Jesus upon each and
[2:56:56] every one of us.
[2:56:59] It wasn't only on the prophet.
[2:57:01] It's to come on every single one of us.
[2:57:05] May his great, magnificent, holy
[2:57:08] blessings be upon us. May the fire of
[2:57:11] the Holy Ghost come upon us. May the
[2:57:14] power of the resurrection be manifested.
[2:57:17] How's he going to how's the the the the
[2:57:19] power of the Holy Ghost going to be
[2:57:21] manifested?
[2:57:22] BY LIVING THROUGH YOUR LIFE. AMEN.
[2:57:25] &gt;&gt; BY YOU RECOGNIZING YOUR THAT YOU'RE A
[2:57:28] part of the word and that you have the
[2:57:30] word and that you're the voice of God in
[2:57:33] these last days.
[2:57:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. May the power of the
[2:57:37] resurrection be manifested. God, how we
[2:57:40] thank you tonight.
[2:57:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:57:43] &gt;&gt; We are yours.
[2:57:45] &gt;&gt; We give ourselves fully
[2:57:49] &gt;&gt; to you, Lord.
[2:57:51] &gt;&gt; Is that your desire tonight?
[2:57:54] Are you willing to give yourself fully
[2:57:57] &gt;&gt; to him? Let the brothers come. We're
[2:57:59] going to change the order of the
[2:58:00] service. We're going to go into the
[2:58:02] Lord's supper at this time.
[2:58:06] I pray that
[2:58:09] this 2026
[2:58:12] &gt;&gt; will be such a victory year for each and
[2:58:15] every one of you personally.
[2:58:19] &gt;&gt; This is a personal walk. Amen.
[2:58:22] &gt;&gt; This is a personal revelation.
[2:58:26] &gt;&gt; Everything
[2:58:29] about this message. Just just, you know,
[2:58:33] go back on your on your experiences.
[2:58:35] Listen to what sister Deborah was saying
[2:58:36] there. She said that she saw a light on
[2:58:40] her husband that she had not seen ever
[2:58:42] before for the first time. What was that
[2:58:45] light?
[2:58:47] It was the word coming to an attribute
[2:58:50] of God, coming to a son of God, coming
[2:58:52] to a daughter of God at an appointed
[2:58:55] time.
[2:58:57] And the evidence that they are son and
[2:58:59] daughter of God is that they're here.
[2:59:03] &gt;&gt; They're here and THEY'VE GOT THE SAME
[2:59:05] TESTIMONY.
[2:59:07] &gt;&gt; YES, THE BATTLES HAVE BEEN GREAT, BUT
[2:59:09] LIKE CALEB, I'M STRONGER NOW THAN I EVER
[2:59:12] WAS.
[2:59:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:59:14] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE I'M STRONGER IN THE LORD.
[2:59:16] I've seen the victories of God. I've
[2:59:19] seen him oh, deal with my battles. Yes,
[2:59:21] the battles HAVE BEEN GREAT, BUT HE HAS
[2:59:24] given me victory every time.
[2:59:29] &gt;&gt; That's
[2:59:31] a birth.
[2:59:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:59:32] &gt;&gt; That's the revelation of Christianity.
[2:59:37] That's what being a a a part of the body
[2:59:40] of Christ is all about. That's what
[2:59:42] going to church is all about.
[2:59:44] not about traditions of man.
[2:59:47] &gt;&gt; They've made the word of God by their
[2:59:49] traditions of none effect to the people.
[2:59:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let the brothers come.
[3:00:00] Amen.
[3:00:02] This time we're going to change the
[3:00:04] order of the service.
[3:00:06] We're going to we're going to go into
[3:00:08] 2026.
[3:00:11] We're going to have the Lord's supper.
[3:00:14] We're going to take some time to examine
[3:00:16] ourselves.
[3:00:18] We're going to think about
[3:00:21] what the Lord is telling us here
[3:00:23] tonight.
[3:00:26] That you're of a different spirit.
[3:00:29] I've given you Hebron. I've given you
[3:00:33] the promised land.
[3:00:35] That's what Hebron represented
[3:00:38] was God's
[3:00:41] favor.
[3:00:42] It was God's favor
[3:00:45] &gt;&gt; and you are God's favor
[3:00:48] &gt;&gt; and he's given you your portion of the
[3:00:51] land.
[3:00:53] &gt;&gt; Says, "I give it to you,
[3:00:56] but he said, "Give it to me." He had the
[3:01:00] spirit on him. He had that desire
[3:01:04] to move forward with the Lord. Amen.
[3:01:07] Praise God.
[3:01:10] Let's read our scripture.
[3:01:12] in 1 Corinthians chapter 11
[3:01:20] [snorts]
[3:01:22] from verse 23.
[3:01:28] For I have received of the Lord that
[3:01:31] which also I delivered unto you.
[3:01:34] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[3:01:36] which he was betrayed took bread and
[3:01:40] when he had given thanks, he broke it
[3:01:43] and said, "Take, eat.
[3:01:47] This is my body which is broken for you.
[3:01:52] This do in remembrance of me."
[3:01:57] Brother Christopher, would you take the
[3:01:58] bread and give thanks?
[3:02:07] It's okay, brother. You can you can just
[3:02:10] pray.
[3:02:27] Lord,
[3:02:32] this bread [snorts] in my hands, Lord,
[3:02:35] Father, which represents your broken
[3:02:38] body, Lord, Father, broken for us, Lord.
[3:02:42] Lord, as we partake of it, may it bring
[3:02:45] healing. May it bring deliverance. May
[3:02:48] it bring strength, Lord, strength for
[3:02:50] the journey, dear father. Lord, bless
[3:02:53] it, Lord. May you sanctify it, Lord, to
[3:02:56] our bodies, Lord, with thanksgiving in
[3:02:58] our hearts in Jesus name. Amen.
[3:03:07] After the same manner also he took the
[3:03:11] cup, and when he had sucked, saying,
[3:03:13] "This cup is the new testament in my
[3:03:17] blood. This do ye as often as ye drink
[3:03:20] it in remembrance of me."
[3:03:25] Brother Phillip,
[3:03:28] would you give thanks for the wine?
[3:03:31] Oh our heavenly most gracious eternal
[3:03:35] God so grateful to be partakers of this
[3:03:39] because if you not do it not have part
[3:03:41] in you but your grace has brought us to
[3:03:44] be partakers of it. Father as we drink
[3:03:47] the wine that represent the Holy Ghost.
[3:03:51] Father, may that Holy Ghost go through
[3:03:54] every part of our being, our conscious,
[3:03:56] subconscious, every part and do what
[3:03:59] it's supposed to do in our lives because
[3:04:01] you are the same yesterday, today, and
[3:04:04] forever. Bless it, Father, as we partake
[3:04:07] it in Jesus name. Amen.
[3:04:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04:20] The next slide
[3:04:25] says
[3:04:28] in verse 27-31, "Wherefore,
[3:04:32] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[3:04:35] this cup of the Lord unworthily
[3:04:38] shall be guilty of the body and the
[3:04:40] blood of the Lord.
[3:04:42] But let a man examine himself, and so
[3:04:45] let him eat of that bread, and drink of
[3:04:49] that cup. For he that eateth and
[3:04:52] drinkkeeth unworthily eateth and
[3:04:54] drinkkeeth damnation to himself, not
[3:04:57] discerning the Lord's body. For this
[3:05:00] cause many are weak and sickly among
[3:05:03] you, and many sleep.
[3:05:06] For if we would judge ourselves, we
[3:05:08] should not be judged.
[3:05:13] We need to understand here
[3:05:16] that it's important to examine
[3:05:18] ourselves.
[3:05:21] We want to leave 2025 behind.
[3:05:27] We want a fresh start.
[3:05:30] And here we have an opportunity to
[3:05:33] examine our hearts and examine our lives
[3:05:38] and maybe make some
[3:05:42] re renew some covenants with the Lord
[3:05:45] because he's made an unconditional
[3:05:47] covenant with you.
[3:05:52] His righteousness has been placed on
[3:05:55] you. So it's not your own righteousness
[3:05:58] that's going to do it. It's his
[3:06:00] righteousness.
[3:06:04] He
[3:06:06] by the shedding of his blood and by the
[3:06:09] giving of his life
[3:06:12] died for your sins.
[3:06:14] And by you accepting that
[3:06:17] your sin
[3:06:19] is washed away,
[3:06:22] never to be remembered.
[3:06:25] Never to be brought up.
[3:06:29] If you truly believe that, then when you
[3:06:31] go into your examination,
[3:06:35] you will reconcile with the Lord.
[3:06:40] Everything can be made right. Everything
[3:06:43] can be restored. Everything can be made
[3:06:45] whole if you truly believe
[3:06:49] in what he said
[3:06:52] that he would do. So, let us all bow our
[3:06:56] heads and take a couple minutes right
[3:06:58] now
[3:07:00] and examine ourselves before the Lord.
[3:08:22] Amen.
[3:08:25] This time I'm going to ask the brothers
[3:08:28] to go
[3:08:30] let their other deacons take the other
[3:08:33] ends
[3:08:35] and distribute
[3:08:37] the wine and the bread and then just
[3:08:40] hold the bread and hold the wine and we
[3:08:43] will all partake of it together.
[3:09:29] Continue
[3:09:43] to pray. Continue to search your hearts.
[3:09:46] Continue to
[3:09:49] think about the things that
[3:09:53] you've let go
[3:09:55] that you're leaving behind. Think of
[3:09:58] them for the last time.
[3:10:02] Those mistakes, leave them in 2025.
[3:10:06] Don't carry anything with you into 2026
[3:10:10] that's not going to take you closer to
[3:10:12] God.
[3:10:16] Let go of those some things you may have
[3:10:18] to let go. You may have to let go of
[3:10:20] certain
[3:10:22] bad company. you young people, maybe you
[3:10:26] got to let go of some, you know,
[3:10:31] influences in your life at school. Not
[3:10:34] saying you gotta, you know, reject them
[3:10:36] and and, you know, to but separate from
[3:10:40] the unbelief.
[3:10:43] Don't be partakers. Be an example when
[3:10:46] they're using all that foul language.
[3:10:48] You don't need to be using that
[3:10:49] language. It defiles you.
[3:10:55] separate from it.
[3:10:58] Be different.
[3:11:01] We're a lot closer than you think.
[3:11:11] Believe for that new job.
[3:11:16] Believe for that new opportunity.
[3:11:19] Believe that God in 2026 is going to
[3:11:22] open the windows of heaven
[3:11:26] because of your faithfulness
[3:11:30] in paying your tithes and paying in
[3:11:32] giving of your offerings.
[3:11:35] Be under expectation that God is going
[3:11:37] to God is going to pour out
[3:11:40] his promises. He cannot fail
[3:11:46] to fulfill his word.
[3:11:53] It's unconditional.
[3:11:57] But it requires
[3:11:59] our faith. It requires us to believe
[3:12:03] what he's revealed to us and allow it to
[3:12:06] live through our lives.
[3:12:12] Believe the promises. Believe for that
[3:12:14] new job. Believe for that that better
[3:12:16] health. You know, if it means you got to
[3:12:19] start doing some regular exercise,
[3:12:22] you're not going to get healthier by
[3:12:24] just doing nothing.
[3:12:26] But say, "Lord, give me the confidence.
[3:12:28] Give me the courage. give me the
[3:12:30] enthusiasm and the passion to to do that
[3:12:34] extra
[3:12:35] exercise on a on a regular basis that's
[3:12:38] going to make me feel better.
[3:12:41] Maybe you got to let go of certain bad
[3:12:43] eating habits.
[3:12:45] You don't want to carry them into 2026.
[3:12:48] Say, "Lord, help me with my with my
[3:12:50] eating habits."
[3:12:57] Amen.
[3:12:58] simple things, but he's mindful and and
[3:13:02] that's all a part of your promises.
[3:13:06] It's all a part of your mountain.
[3:13:12] Glory to God.
[3:13:27] I see a lot of things in 2025
[3:13:32] that I could have done better,
[3:13:36] but I'm glad that I can see those things
[3:13:40] and I'm glad that I can use them as
[3:13:42] stepping stones.
[3:13:45] And that's what we need to look at, you
[3:13:48] know, our failures. And we're all going
[3:13:50] to have them, our mistakes. We're all
[3:13:53] going to make them,
[3:13:59] but use them as stepping stones.
[3:14:30] Is there anybody else?
[3:14:34] Okay,
[3:14:37] perfect.
[3:14:47] So at this time
[3:14:50] Jesus said, "Do this in remembrance of
[3:14:53] me."
[3:14:55] Remember what this represents. It's not
[3:14:58] his literal body. This is not his
[3:15:00] literal blood.
[3:15:03] But
[3:15:04] remember
[3:15:06] the promises of God.
[3:15:11] This represents his word.
[3:15:15] And you you're remembering now to take
[3:15:17] that word and apply that word in your
[3:15:20] life. It represents the word of God.
[3:15:24] Amen.
[3:15:26] So when you take it,
[3:15:30] understand it as as I feed on the word
[3:15:32] of God every day of my life
[3:15:36] and I'm led by the spirit of God every
[3:15:38] day of my life
[3:15:41] because when he gave up the ghost, it
[3:15:43] was so that the Holy Ghost could come
[3:15:45] back on me. And that's what it
[3:15:48] represents. So let us partake of the
[3:15:51] bread
[3:15:53] with thanksgiving in our hearts.
[3:16:12] As you're taking in the word,
[3:16:14] remember
[3:16:16] the word is your healing.
[3:16:19] The word is your deliverance. The word
[3:16:21] is your forgiveness.
[3:16:25] I'm remembering that when he went to the
[3:16:27] cross, he took all of my unbelief to the
[3:16:30] cross.
[3:16:33] That's why I'm remembering and partaking
[3:16:37] of this supper here tonight.
[3:16:39] And now as you're drinking this wine,
[3:16:43] take it as the revelation and the
[3:16:45] stimulation of his word and the effect
[3:16:48] that it's had in your life and has
[3:16:51] called you out of this world and has
[3:16:53] made you the person that you are today
[3:16:56] and know that you can enter 2026
[3:16:59] under the leadership of his spirit. Let
[3:17:02] us partake of his
[3:17:05] wine
[3:17:08] representing the stimulation of
[3:17:09] revelation.
[3:17:16] Let the musicians come.
[3:17:32] Come ahead, Brother Mike. Let's sing a
[3:17:35] few songs as we we've got about uh
[3:17:39] 17 minutes before we go into the new
[3:17:41] year.
[3:17:45] Let's do a song.
[3:17:50] Then we're going to give
[3:17:52] Brother Tim an opportunity
[3:17:55] to come and say a few words. Amen. He
[3:17:59] had to work tonight, but by the grace of
[3:18:02] God, he's here and he was able to make
[3:18:03] it for the Lord's supper. And we wanted
[3:18:06] to hear from all the deacons. We still
[3:18:07] got about 16 minutes, so I'm going to
[3:18:11] let him take about seven minutes. Okay?
[3:18:15] And then and then I want to hear from
[3:18:16] our former pastor.
[3:18:19] &gt;&gt; And I want him to come and say
[3:18:22] a few words.
[3:18:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. We're we're the family
[3:18:26] of God here today. Amen. One song,
[3:18:28] Brother Mike. Give us one quick song.
[3:18:31] Brother Tim, come on up and prepare
[3:18:33] yourself.
[3:18:38] Amen. [music] Praise God.
[3:18:48] At the cross, [music and singing] at the
[3:18:50] cross, where I first saw the light and
[3:18:55] the [music] burning of my [singing]
[3:18:58] heart rolled away.

[3:21:02] drops [music]
[3:21:03] of grief can

[3:21:40] &gt;&gt; [music]
[3:21:42] &gt;&gt; I receive

[3:21:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[3:21:54] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[3:21:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can be seated.
[3:21:59] I got seven minutes. [laughter]
[3:22:04] &gt;&gt; Anyways, it's good to be here tonight.
[3:22:07] Amen.
[3:22:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:22:09] &gt;&gt; I was expected to be here from the
[3:22:11] beginning and I got called out emergency
[3:22:14] services for the roads and if you're
[3:22:17] going that way, you're you're okay. I
[3:22:20] got the roads. Okay.
[3:22:23] Hallelujah. I had a little thought on my
[3:22:25] heart that I prepared something, but uh
[3:22:28] didn't work out. We're just going to
[3:22:30] make it uh probably a sermon later on.
[3:22:32] But um
[3:22:34] you know first of all I want to thank
[3:22:36] each and every one of you that um this
[3:22:39] year has been there's been a lot of
[3:22:42] things happening this year a lot of
[3:22:44] challenges and um but you know one thing
[3:22:47] I I I realize that's very important
[3:22:52] uh when you go through some challenges
[3:22:55] is the prayers of the saints. Amen.
[3:22:58] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I just have a a different
[3:23:00] appreciation.
[3:23:01] You know, when I hear a prayer request
[3:23:03] come through or I hear somebody's in
[3:23:05] desperation, I don't care what I'm
[3:23:07] doing. I stop and I get right into
[3:23:10] prayer.
[3:23:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because [clears throat] I know how
[3:23:12] important it is, you know, when I need
[3:23:15] it.
[3:23:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. When I need it. and we've gone
[3:23:18] through some times and my wife has gone
[3:23:20] through some times and we both have and
[3:23:23] and uh it's just we just appreciate it
[3:23:26] with all our hearts. Amen. So, don't
[3:23:29] stop praying one for another.
[3:23:31] &gt;&gt; The Bible commands us to pray one for
[3:23:33] another. We don't realize how powerful
[3:23:35] it is, but I know when you break into
[3:23:38] the spirit, it doesn't have to be all
[3:23:40] night prayer meeting. Just break into
[3:23:42] the spirit and and uh reach out for one
[3:23:44] another. Amen. But I had a little
[3:23:46] thought on my heart there about um
[3:23:49] looking back. Remember Lot's wife. Don't
[3:23:53] look back. I mean, it doesn't say much
[3:23:55] about Lot's wife when it when it reminds
[3:23:58] us of what she did. And she did one
[3:24:01] thing that that is very, you know, uh
[3:24:05] stands out in the scriptures. Don't look
[3:24:07] back. And I'm I was looking at myself
[3:24:09] and I I was looking at things, you know,
[3:24:11] 34 years walking with the Lord and and
[3:24:14] God dealing with so many things.
[3:24:17] And you know, if like in the high
[3:24:20] calling, if you truly been really called
[3:24:24] to be like Jesus Christ in all your
[3:24:27] spirit, I'm not just talking about
[3:24:29] playing church or being a message
[3:24:31] believer, but being a real son and
[3:24:34] daughter of God, God real deep down
[3:24:37] inside because he knows our very
[3:24:39] thoughts in our hearts. And when you
[3:24:40] become conscious of that, you realize
[3:24:44] that some of the things that you're
[3:24:46] still looking back on in your life. And
[3:24:49] I was looking back and I was, you know,
[3:24:51] I had good times and I had really bad
[3:24:54] times growing up, really tough times
[3:24:56] growing up. But I, you know, I I look
[3:24:58] back, I was brought up in the 70s and
[3:25:00] the 80s and with the music, which is I
[3:25:03] think was a lot better back then than it
[3:25:05] is today. But um you know and and
[3:25:09] they're connected they're connected with
[3:25:13] feelings, they're connected with
[3:25:15] emotions, they're connected with
[3:25:18] experiences, right? And sometimes we
[3:25:22] don't realize that we still connected to
[3:25:24] those things and the Holy Ghost is
[3:25:27] telling us don't look back at those
[3:25:30] things. Sometimes we we you know I I'm
[3:25:33] just talking about myself.
[3:25:35] You know I'm looking back at some of
[3:25:36] those things and I'm holding on to those
[3:25:38] things as good memories or good feelings
[3:25:41] or good things and that. But in order
[3:25:43] for me to go forward, in order for me to
[3:25:46] overcome,
[3:25:48] I realize what the Lord was speaking to
[3:25:51] me. I have to let go of everything. And
[3:25:54] I said, Lord, let go of everything. I
[3:25:59] mean, he's taken the bride of Jesus
[3:26:01] Christ, and I can only speak for myself,
[3:26:03] and I know for the rest of the bride of
[3:26:05] Jesus Christ, he's taken us to areas of
[3:26:07] our lives to surrender and to die out. I
[3:26:11] can't do it. I can't do it. I try to I
[3:26:14] try to put it on for many years. I try
[3:26:17] to do certain things for many years, but
[3:26:20] I can't do it. But he's doing it now.
[3:26:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:26:23] &gt;&gt; He got me to a place where he's doing it
[3:26:25] now. And all he does is he comes to you
[3:26:28] and he reveals these things to you to
[3:26:31] let them go. Whatever stage that you're
[3:26:33] at, you're not might be at my stage or
[3:26:36] somebody else's stage where God is
[3:26:38] really dealing with the depths of your
[3:26:39] spirit and what's in there and what's
[3:26:42] been placed in there through your life
[3:26:44] and experiences. But whatever area that
[3:26:47] you're in
[3:26:48] that he's speaking to, just let it go
[3:26:51] and let God have its way. And don't look
[3:26:53] back anymore. Don't look back because
[3:26:56] you can't press forward like Paul
[3:26:59] says,"I press towards the mark of the
[3:27:01] high calling which is in Christ Jesus."
[3:27:04] Amen. We have to constantly in our
[3:27:07] spirits be pressing forward
[3:27:10] &gt;&gt; to what high calling God has given us.
[3:27:12] This word, we heard it tonight. We've
[3:27:14] been hearing it all the time that we're
[3:27:16] sons and daughters of God. Amen. Are we
[3:27:20] sons and daughters of God?
[3:27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Have we been called to this great
[3:27:25] high calling?
[3:27:26] &gt;&gt; Do we believe that we're going to take a
[3:27:28] rapture? That we're going to take a
[3:27:31] perfect faith. Do we believe the seed of
[3:27:34] God that's within us?
[3:27:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then then then we can
[3:27:39] believe NOTHING ELSE BUT THE TRUTH.
[3:27:42] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN we believe the truth, and this
[3:27:44] is the truth, and that truth will set
[3:27:47] you free
[3:27:48] &gt;&gt; when you let go and let God have his
[3:27:51] way. Amen.
[3:27:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:27:52] &gt;&gt; That's it. I
[3:27:54] &gt;&gt; I can go on and on and and go deeper
[3:27:56] into it, but just let go. Remember, lot
[3:27:59] wife, just don't look back.
[3:28:02] &gt;&gt; Let the thing go and press on to the
[3:28:05] mark of the high calling. Whatever it
[3:28:07] is, I guarantee you if you let it go in
[3:28:10] your spirit. It may be a memory, a feel,
[3:28:12] an experience. Whatever it is, just let
[3:28:15] it go
[3:28:16] &gt;&gt; and watch the growth that will happen in
[3:28:19] your life. God bless you saints.
[3:28:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause]
[3:28:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Tim.
[3:28:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[3:28:30] &gt;&gt; Bless you, brother.
[3:28:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[3:28:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[3:28:35] &gt;&gt; I still have a few after effects of the
[3:28:38] flu. Uh in terms of my voice not fully
[3:28:42] back, but the flu itself is gone from me
[3:28:46] completely. I'm happy to be here
[3:28:48] tonight. Uh I am also very uh proud to
[3:28:54] see what's happening in your lives and
[3:28:57] to see uh what uh has been accomplished
[3:29:02] during this past year. I want to give
[3:29:05] God all the glory and the honor and the
[3:29:08] praise.
[3:29:10] &gt;&gt; Um if I can have a Psalm 23 verse 5 um
[3:29:16] up there will be very nice.
[3:29:19] Thou preparest a table before me in the
[3:29:24] presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest
[3:29:27] my head with oil. My cup run it over.
[3:29:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, thanks be to God.
[3:29:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:29:36] &gt;&gt; H what a position. We are leaving the
[3:29:39] old year behind. And he's saying you
[3:29:42] haven't entered the new year yet. But I
[3:29:46] I I prepared a table for you.
[3:29:50] &gt;&gt; I prepared a feast for you.
[3:29:53] &gt;&gt; I prepared something good in your future
[3:29:56] for you.
[3:29:58] &gt;&gt; It's prepared already.
[3:30:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:30:01] &gt;&gt; You understand? It's it's there. It's
[3:30:03] waiting for you as you entered into this
[3:30:06] new year. Thou preparest a table before
[3:30:11] me in the presence of my enemies. Of
[3:30:13] course, that's David speaking because
[3:30:16] Saul was hunting him like the devil is
[3:30:18] hunting us. And he's just hunting him
[3:30:21] and he's running for his life all the
[3:30:24] time. And next thing you know, uh he
[3:30:27] didn't know where he's going to even get
[3:30:28] food some days. He didn't know what's
[3:30:31] going to happen. and he ended up going
[3:30:34] into the temple and asking the priest,
[3:30:38] the high priest, uh, for some food.
[3:30:42] And the priest says, "Well, there is no
[3:30:45] food here. The only thing that I could
[3:30:50] give you is the shoe bread." But you
[3:30:53] see, that's only given uh to the high
[3:30:58] priest. anybody else that eats that
[3:31:01] would die. But but David said, "Look,
[3:31:05] I'm so hungry. We and my men are so
[3:31:08] hungry, we got to eat something."
[3:31:11] &gt;&gt; And so the high priest gave them the
[3:31:14] shoe bread and they ate the shoebre.
[3:31:20] &gt;&gt; Oh my. You see, I tell you, so when he
[3:31:23] said, "Thou prepareest a table before me
[3:31:28] in the presence of my enemies that are
[3:31:30] hunting me," HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS TALKING
[3:31:33] ABOUT.
[3:31:34] &gt;&gt; Don't you worry about the devil. Don't
[3:31:36] you worry about all these uh troubles,
[3:31:38] trials, tribulations, sicknesses,
[3:31:40] problems that will come your way.
[3:31:43] THEY'RE GOING TO COME. BUT IN THE
[3:31:45] PRESENCE OF ALL THOSE THINGS, HEALTH,
[3:31:49] HEALING, PROSPERITY, BLESSING, LIFTING
[3:31:53] UP, PASSING YOUR EXAMS, PASSING YOUR JOB
[3:31:56] your your your job uh what do you call
[3:31:59] it? Interviews and all those THINGS THAT
[3:32:02] IT'S IT'S AHEAD OF YOU, BUT YOU'RE GOING
[3:32:05] TO GO THROUGH IT ALL BECAUSE HE'S
[3:32:08] ALREADY PREPARED the way for you.
[3:32:12] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[3:32:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my. Leave the scripture up.
[3:32:16] Praise. I'm going to finish. Praise the
[3:32:18] Lord. Uh uh. You know, I can't remember
[3:32:21] all this like I used to. Praise the
[3:32:24] Lord. [laughter]
[3:32:26] He says, "Thou anointest my head with
[3:32:29] oil. My cup runth over." He's going to
[3:32:33] bless you so much that your cup is going
[3:32:36] to be full
[3:32:38] &gt;&gt; and running over.
[3:32:40] &gt;&gt; What? Well, well, what is this? He's
[3:32:42] talking about God wasting cup running
[3:32:46] over and all like that spilling all over
[3:32:48] the floor and everything else. We'll
[3:32:51] talk about that another time. But just
[3:32:53] know God wants to bless you with enough
[3:32:56] so that you can give and help others.
[3:32:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:33:00] &gt;&gt; Not to give away what you have, but I
[3:33:04] let your cup be full.
[3:33:08] You handle whatever you have to handle
[3:33:10] and I'll make it run over
[3:33:13] &gt;&gt; and you'll be able to take all those
[3:33:15] excesses and bless other people with it.
[3:33:19] &gt;&gt; We're a blessed people
[3:33:21] &gt;&gt; and I want to wish you a happy new year.
[3:33:24] &gt;&gt; I want to I want you to have a blessed
[3:33:28] uh 2026
[3:33:30] &gt;&gt; for me and I hope for you. God is my
[3:33:34] health.
[3:33:36] The Lord Jesus is my joy.
[3:33:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:33:39] &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus is my wealth.
[3:33:42] &gt;&gt; He is my happiness.
[3:33:44] &gt;&gt; He is my all in all. I hope he is the
[3:33:47] same to all of us. I appreciated the
[3:33:50] testimonies. I appreciated the songs. I
[3:33:53] see the potential uh in many of the
[3:33:57] young people that came up. Praise.
[3:34:00] Everybody is young to me anyway, but
[3:34:02] praise them. [laughter]
