[22:15] glad to see all of you here tonight
[22:17] by the grace of God
[22:20] the weather and everything seems to be

[22:25] season is shaping up
[22:27] as we go into the Christmas time praise
[22:33] the lord we give God the glory for that
[22:36] amen hallelujah now let's read
[22:39] uh he was in the world
[22:43] and the world was made by him
[22:48] the world knew him not
[22:53] he came onto his own and his own
[22:57] received him not
[23:02] but as many as received him to them gave
[23:07] he power to become the sons of God even
[23:12] to them that believe
[23:15] on his name
[23:18] which were born not of blood nor of the
[23:21] will of the flesh nor of the will of man
[23:24] but of God
[23:29] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[23:33] Among Us and we beheld his glory the
[23:38] glory as of the only begotten of the
[23:43] father
[23:44] full of grace and truth
[23:49] the word was made flesh praise the Lord
[23:53] father we thank you so much for the
[23:57] reading of your word
[24:00] inspiring us and enlightening us and
[24:04] giving us strength for this hour that we
[24:07] may be fortified against the attacks of
[24:12] the enemy take praise Glory and Honor
[24:15] tonight as we spend some time around the
[24:20] sacrifice of your word and may you bless
[24:24] us all here tonight in Jesus name amen
[24:28] God bless you please be seated
[24:30] thank you
[24:31] foreign
[24:33] well last week we did have a wonderful
[24:36] time in the presence of the Lord
[24:38] hallelujah
[24:40] and uh uh if you remember we talked
[24:44] about the Christmas Fire book a man
[24:46] remembers that and the Christmas spiral
[24:49] was mainly talking about the in
[24:53] the street
[24:54] and what uh what a story that was
[24:59] well uh you know we really were speaking
[25:03] of Jesus being that Trump on the street
[25:08] Jesus was the one that did that
[25:12] and uh you see he had to die that he
[25:16] could bring us his gift
[25:18] that he wanted to give to us and the
[25:22] only way he could get it to us he had to
[25:24] die
[25:26] to bring that gift because you see like
[25:29] that shrimp that was on the street
[25:31] his daughter was not there in that
[25:35] Dimension that he was in she was in
[25:39] another dimension
[25:42] so to get from this one
[25:45] and to go to that one he have to die
[25:49] here so that he could take the gift of
[25:52] her over there
[25:55] he was the same
[25:58] because down from his glory ever living
[26:02] story my God and savior came and Jesus
[26:07] was his name
[26:09] to do what to bring to us
[26:13] eternal life
[26:14] now with understanding you know what I'm
[26:17] talking about we didn't know even what
[26:19] we had or anything like that but praise
[26:22] God hallelujah amen so he you see for
[26:27] him to be able to uh to get us
[26:31] to attract our attention to open our
[26:34] understanding
[26:35] he could not come here as a perfect man
[26:39] he couldn't do it so he had to die so
[26:44] that he could get us to believe amen
[26:49] praise God brother Branham so you see
[26:54] he had to die to get the gift of God to
[27:00] you amen and that's in capitals here
[27:03] because he recognized when he's talking
[27:05] about that what that is he he had to die
[27:09] to get the gift of God to you
[27:13] now let me go uh to where many sermons
[27:17] where he says the greatest gift you can
[27:20] give to God is yourself
[27:24] amen Surrender Your Light surrender
[27:27] yourself give it to God now reverse that
[27:30] the greatest gift that he could have
[27:33] given to you is what himself and that is
[27:37] what he did he gave himself to you so he
[27:41] had to die to give himself to you praise
[27:45] be to God hallelujah see like the
[27:49] had to die to get a little dog to his
[27:54] girl but now Christ have to die to get
[27:59] God to you and I just wrote in little
[28:03] letters his bride he had to die to get
[28:08] his life to you praise God tonight I'm
[28:12] speaking briefly on Jehovah in his
[28:16] creation
[28:18] praise the Lord
[28:20] now we know uh fundamentally that Jesus
[28:24] Christ is God
[28:26] for it was Jehovah
[28:29] for the purpose of which I'm speaking
[28:32] that came down
[28:35] and lived in a human body amen
[28:39] hallelujah it's and it's very very hard
[28:42] for some people to understand but a
[28:46] Jehovah the great Jehovah
[28:49] the god of creation the god of Eternity
[28:53] came down and created a body for himself
[28:59] amen so as John 1 14 says and their word
[29:06] was made flesh praise God now knowing
[29:10] that the word of God is eternal that
[29:13] word was made flesh it was temporarily
[29:16] made temporary
[29:19] you understand in other words he of
[29:21] Eternal came down temporarily to be in
[29:25] time as the Bible said that he could be
[29:28] tempted with the same Temptations you're
[29:30] tempted with tested with the trials and
[29:33] the there is no temptation common to man
[29:37] the Bible says that he did not go
[29:39] through so that he could be a high
[29:41] priest that is touched with the feeling
[29:44] of our infirmities
[29:45] now uh just uh today uh my dear wife was
[29:51] talking with somebody and they said oh
[29:53] uh such and such a person has this pain
[29:57] in this part of their body they have
[29:59] this sickness or whatever she said oh I
[30:02] know about that I used to have that but
[30:05] thank God I'm free from it but right
[30:08] away that person when somebody actually
[30:13] had the same thing and they know the
[30:17] pains the trials that go along with it
[30:20] they know this is somebody that's not
[30:22] just talking they can really empathize
[30:25] they understand it amen so he is a high
[30:30] priest that had every Temptation coming
[30:34] to man so the scripture says therefore
[30:37] he can be touched
[30:39] with the feelings of our weaknesses
[30:43] sicknesses problems trials infirmities
[30:47] he can be touched amen that's why we say
[30:50] the great physician now is near the
[30:54] sympathizing Jesus the droopy he Stoops
[30:58] the drooping heart to cheer you see he's
[31:01] took down to earth the drooping heart to
[31:04] cheer oh hear the voice of Jesus Christ
[31:07] so Jehovah literally came to Earth
[31:13] in the form of the man
[31:16] Christ Jesus
[31:19] and Christ Jesus or Jesus Christ was a
[31:24] creation of God and God lived in his
[31:30] creation
[31:31] amen we know generally God is God is in
[31:36] nature God is all around us and praise
[31:40] God in this case because it was a work
[31:43] that he had to do a tree couldn't do it
[31:46] a horse a fish nothing else could do it
[31:48] he had to come and live in a man amen so
[31:53] as a man he could carry out the great
[31:56] task that he has praise the name of the
[31:59] Lord hallelujah amen praise God no
[32:02] wonder we use the term the fullness of
[32:05] God was in him
[32:07] in other words God as a for a prophet
[32:11] has said in Christ is a mystery for all
[32:13] God was he poured into Christ
[32:17] Hallelujah when he came to Earth he
[32:21] poured himself into Christ
[32:24] and now Christ went to Calvary he died
[32:27] for our sins and now Christ forced all
[32:31] of himself into his bride his true
[32:35] church he pours out of himself say
[32:38] praise God so he lives in me he lives in
[32:42] you he lives in his beloved elect lady
[32:46] his life is in her this life animation
[32:50] vivifies her glory to God hallelujah you
[32:54] see he was the creator he was God and
[32:59] now he made himself a being of the Earth
[33:05] in other words a being of time
[33:09] which means that have to have a
[33:13] beginning
[33:15] to become a creature of time this man
[33:19] that he had created the physical body
[33:22] that had to have a beginning in other
[33:25] words rather timeline is going to be
[33:27] born another time it's going to die
[33:28] right that had to be like that therefore
[33:33] he created himself a body to live him
[33:38] God live in God himself created a body
[33:42] for himself see yes and by doing that by
[33:48] this creation then he could go and save
[33:52] the rest of the Lost creation that he
[33:56] had created amen praise be to God how
[33:59] wonderful the Simplicity of the Gospel
[34:02] amen that God is giving to us praise God
[34:06] this is what the Christmas story is all
[34:09] about
[34:09] it's not about Santa Claus and all these
[34:12] things uh that's where the eyes the
[34:15] bells the whistles the tinsels the the
[34:18] the the green trees and all of that it's
[34:20] nice for the human being and the senses
[34:23] and stuff like that but for the soul
[34:25] that is what he come and he died for our
[34:28] sins in that way and we give him glory
[34:31] praise God no he said
[34:36] let me say this there is nothing that a
[34:39] man can annihilate
[34:42] there isn't one thing that he could
[34:46] actually annihilate you can do nothing
[34:49] to completely destroy anything
[34:52] you may take a piece of paper burn it up
[34:55] you might get crazy burned on a building
[34:59] you may burn up trees right you didn't
[35:03] and he let them see oh my the fire may
[35:08] break you may even hear them chemicals
[35:11] they're bursting and popping they're
[35:14] only turning right back to what they
[35:18] were in the beginning praise the lord
[35:21] they're going back to what they were
[35:23] praise the Lord hallelujah they're not
[35:27] inhalated amen if we lived in eternity
[35:31] like God hallelujah then the fire only
[35:35] takes it back to its original beginning
[35:39] praise God hallelujah that's why I keep
[35:43] saying over and again we are going back
[35:45] where we come from nothing nothing can
[35:48] destroy us nothing can hinder us amen
[35:51] we're going right back where we come
[35:53] from no either burn you at the stake
[35:55] Hallelujah that you're going back where
[35:58] we come from that cannot destroy
[36:01] anything
[36:02] that is why Jesus could speak with
[36:05] confidence and say you destroy this body
[36:08] and I'll raise it up again in three days
[36:10] he was God that's right he said I will
[36:13] raise it up in three days praise the
[36:16] Lord because they can't really destroy
[36:19] it hallelujah amen it has to go back
[36:23] when the breakings of those atoms and so
[36:26] forth takes place then it's go straight
[36:29] back to where it was praise the Lord
[36:32] hallelujah no matter what they do praise
[36:35] God now you can flex your arms brother
[36:38] Bill you can be a modern day Superman
[36:42] glory to God but not a man a steel a man
[36:46] of Life a man of the Holy Spirit praise
[36:49] God hallelujah amen see
[36:54] now
[36:55] understand
[36:59] you cannot annihilate anything
[37:02] because it's all God's spoken word
[37:07] in other words he spoke it all into
[37:09] existence he spoke the first three and
[37:12] then everything replicates and so what
[37:15] we're looking at is what he's talking
[37:16] about he didn't say all of that here but
[37:19] this is what we're looking at we're
[37:21] everything you see around you in other
[37:23] words it's God spoken word
[37:26] amen and they said oh we blew it up we
[37:30] we dropped a nuclear bomb we destroy it
[37:32] uh we're gonna destroy the entire world
[37:35] and everything else no whether Brands
[37:37] and future home eventually uh Heavenly
[37:40] bride and the Earth the Heavenly the
[37:43] Earthly bride and Heavenly bridegroom he
[37:46] says
[37:47] they're only going to uh judge
[37:50] themselves and burn up themselves
[37:52] they're only going to cleanse the Earth
[37:54] so that the bride can come back and come
[37:58] down on it but he says they can't
[38:01] destroy God's spoken word that is
[38:05] eternal it cannot change his word stands
[38:08] forever amen praise God and it says it
[38:11] right here he says see whatever God says
[38:15] stands forever
[38:17] and he says amen just like brother
[38:20] coffee Hallelujah because you cannot
[38:23] inhalate it Hallelujah and praise God
[38:27] not even this body because we are part
[38:31] of the earth and we can never be
[38:34] completely annihilated amen oh yes but
[38:39] the soul that sinner it shall die it
[38:43] shall be annihilated in other words he's
[38:46] saying there only God can and heal it
[38:49] totally anything only God can do that
[38:53] praise God you say well where do you get
[38:55] well Jesus said it he says fear not him
[38:58] nothing just kill your body but fear him
[39:01] that can kill both Body and Soul Amen in
[39:05] other words he can destroy Body and Soul
[39:08] completely praise be to God hallelujah
[39:12] amen but you see that's the way it is
[39:15] and I thank God for that pray praise God
[39:18] now remember God created himself a body
[39:23] and therefore therefore this was the
[39:27] creator
[39:29] of all creation living
[39:32] in his creation
[39:34] the Creator living in his creation
[39:37] Jesus Christ his masterpiece the artists
[39:42] living in this piece of art praise God
[39:44] hallelujah and that's what he did so
[39:48] that by this creation he might save all
[39:53] them
[39:54] that were lost
[39:56] Hallelujah in his creation and then he
[40:00] puts here I am speaking about you and I
[40:04] who are made creatures of time
[40:09] praise the Lord but the Lord knoweth
[40:11] them that are his
[40:12] is that right the Lord look at them that
[40:16] are his
[40:17] he says uh uh I I haven't come for just
[40:20] everybody but I come for the lost sheep
[40:24] praise God hallelujah glory to God see
[40:28] he was the creator Hallelujah and he
[40:32] proved that he was because he was deity
[40:35] mid flesh then he went into talk he says
[40:37] now remember he was in other words he
[40:41] was trying to show them that though he
[40:44] was in flesh standing in the earth in
[40:47] front of them that he was that Creator
[40:50] from before the foundations of the world
[40:53] now standing before them in a human body
[40:58] that is why the brother Brandon was
[41:00] saying here see that is why he took a
[41:04] piece of bread and created bread
[41:07] that had already been bred because he
[41:11] had created the first he's going into
[41:13] that he created that so this one that
[41:16] would say oh he didn't create that well
[41:18] he created the first one and all those
[41:19] ones came down all the wheat and
[41:21] everything came down from what he
[41:23] created in the original so here it is
[41:26] and he broke and he broke
[41:29] see and it just multiplied he took a
[41:33] fish and and another fish came and
[41:36] another and another and another amen and
[41:40] more than that he he took water and from
[41:44] that water he made wine out of it amen
[41:48] and we see him in these last days
[41:54] Hallelujah
[41:56] then he took something
[41:59] that was bread fish or water
[42:03] and created something out of it
[42:07] but here in these last days without
[42:11] anything
[42:13] without anything
[42:15] standing there
[42:17] he created a squirrel
[42:20] praise God hallelujah where remember
[42:24] what I say here praise God where there
[42:29] was
[42:30] nothing
[42:32] and there was no squirrel
[42:35] see he created squirrels he he's showing
[42:41] here he does he says he and he passed
[42:46] and then he says remains God but what
[42:49] he's saying he is still showing that he
[42:53] is still the same God that was standing
[42:56] back there and multiplying them things
[42:59] he's showing I'm here now and I'm doing
[43:01] the same thing amen praise God and I'm
[43:04] doing it if not a higher level because
[43:06] out of nothing I'm creating something
[43:08] praise God that is why when sister had
[43:11] it right when he said this is what
[43:15] happened in the woods and and the
[43:16] squirrel just appeared like that and do
[43:19] you want another one says yes what and
[43:22] there was another one he said and I shot
[43:24] them it was the illusion imagination and
[43:27] he wants her to cook them anyway so
[43:30] here's and she said that's right brother
[43:33] Brandon I believe it praise God
[43:36] Hallelujah and right away that's when he
[43:39] turned around see that's where they
[43:42] don't differentiate and understand what
[43:43] was happening and said to her I give you
[43:47] what is it that you want anything you
[43:49] ask I can give it to you that's not
[43:52] brother Branham
[43:54] that's not the human part
[43:56] that was the great God Of Heaven
[43:59] speaking through the man and saying
[44:01] whatever you want whatever just like you
[44:03] said to Solomon whatever you want just
[44:05] tell me and I'm going to give to you
[44:07] whatever you want she said I want the
[44:09] salvation of my two boys he said then I
[44:13] give them to you amen your two boys the
[44:16] salvation of your two boys and uh you
[44:19] know the story they started shouting and
[44:21] screaming in the back of the house there
[44:23] and turned their lives over to God well
[44:25] who could save the souls but God himself
[44:28] who can do that that had to be God
[44:30] himself speaking through the man
[44:31] remember to be clear not just for you
[44:34] but those in the land of uh the internet
[44:37] that he was not showing trying to show
[44:41] the world that he William Branham was
[44:44] God and we do not believe William
[44:47] Branham who asked God but we do believe
[44:50] and understand that God was acting
[44:53] speaking doing moving and performing
[44:57] miraculous wonderful acts of of our
[45:01] signs wonders prophecies and the life on
[45:05] Parallel for this day and hour to
[45:07] display the our Lord had come back to
[45:10] earth again to manifest the scriptures
[45:13] that he the son of man was being and his
[45:18] being revealed in our day and in our
[45:21] time praise the Lord and we thank God
[45:23] for it hallelujah amen praise God you
[45:28] see he did that then
[45:30] he does this now
[45:33] and that what does that do his Works
[45:37] identifies who he is that he has killed
[45:42] a great Creator oh the great Creator
[45:46] became Our Savior oh praise God
[45:49] hallelujah he became his creation
[45:52] Hallelujah for that crowned his life's
[45:56] testimony that he was the creator praise
[46:01] be to God remember in the seals how I
[46:05] spoke that the whole creation was lost
[46:08] everything was gone everything belonged
[46:12] to Satan because he fell heir to it Adam
[46:16] gave up the title Deeds
[46:19] and he still owns it today he still does
[46:23] that's the reason we have to fight and
[46:28] to have so much trouble now because he
[46:33] controls every Kingdom on this Earth
[46:37] he controls every government on this
[46:41] Earth every king that's on this Earth
[46:46] every Kingdom
[46:48] is controlled by Satan the whole world
[46:53] is controlled and run by Satan and the
[46:57] Bible itself says so amen praise God
[47:01] hallelujah he controls the world but
[47:05] thank God Christ will fall heir to it
[47:08] for now he is a redeemer and he come to
[47:12] redeem the whole lost creation
[47:16] Hallelujah and no one could do that but
[47:19] God himself praise God hallelujah amen
[47:24] and now that's the reason why God now
[47:28] does nothing outside of using a man
[47:33] he will always work through a man praise
[47:38] the Lord see because first a man is what
[47:43] he used to display
[47:45] his great attribute of being a savior
[47:51] hallelujah amen so since he did that
[47:55] after making him in his image not
[48:00] physically but spiritually he made him
[48:03] something like that and he even put him
[48:06] back on free moral agency hallelujah
[48:09] praise God he's talking about Jesus now
[48:12] and at the same time we are lumped in
[48:15] there as part of him so when I'm
[48:17] speaking there you understand I'm
[48:19] talking about him the head him and the
[48:23] bride that comes out of him is speaking
[48:26] of both with the same voice amen said
[48:30] see that's the the reason he had to use
[48:33] a man is what he had to use to display
[48:36] his attribute of savior he had to make
[48:41] him in his image make him something like
[48:45] him
[48:46] see and then what does he do put him on
[48:51] free moral agency to let him act any way
[48:55] he wanted to act
[48:57] right any way he wanted to he could make
[49:01] his own choice
[49:03] but and he knew that man by giving him
[49:07] choice
[49:09] man could then fall
[49:12] when I praise God now this looks so
[49:15] simple to you but when I look at that I
[49:17] I really never caught that in that way
[49:20] that is the very thing that that these
[49:24] people are putting a whole lot of
[49:25] emphasis on I took Jesus as my savior I
[49:28] choose This Night To they don't
[49:30] understand you would you couldn't even
[49:32] do that really if you were not belonging
[49:36] to God from the very beginning amen
[49:39] because it's not us choosing this and
[49:42] not choosing that and the other praise
[49:45] God because God endless is bringing us
[49:49] back to himself you're just a piece of
[49:52] magnet off of the original lump
[49:55] and you're feeling the pull to go right
[49:59] back to where you were
[50:01] that's why he used illustrations like
[50:03] the great magnet in that factory and
[50:06] when it passed over in the roof of the
[50:09] factory all the small pieces that were
[50:11] in the bottom just flew up and stuck to
[50:13] it that's all he's trying to illustrate
[50:15] you got you are of the same material you
[50:18] come from above you're going back where
[50:21] you come from this world only come to
[50:23] attract your attention and bring you
[50:26] back to God where you for in the
[50:28] beginning amen hallelujah see that's the
[50:32] way it is praise the Lord hallelujah
[50:36] amen he did his work of redemption by a
[50:40] man
[50:41] death came first by a man
[50:45] but now life comes back by the second
[50:48] Adam praise God hallelujah Jehovah the
[50:53] deity Jehovah come down and become a
[50:57] child Oh Glory to God when they were
[51:01] looking for a messiah they thought they
[51:03] would have a general
[51:04] they thought they would have a mighty
[51:06] man they are the mightiest person but he
[51:09] come first in the form of a child that
[51:12] he God could be in flesh so Jehovah our
[51:16] creator manifested In the Flesh
[51:19] Hallelujah so being coming as a child he
[51:24] also could then be in the form of sin
[51:29] that he might redeem The Sinner he did
[51:34] not sin he commit no sin but he had to
[51:37] be in the form of sin and like a man
[51:40] that he could redeem man praise God
[51:43] hallelujah you know those things simply
[51:46] he couldn't use a horse to redeem a man
[51:48] nothing else was equivalent uh a fish a
[51:52] bird no matter what the sacrifice in the
[51:54] Old Testament it could not and there was
[51:57] no perfect human being so they even
[52:00] tried human sacrifices with them Gods
[52:02] like Baal and she emotion all these
[52:04] other ones and that doesn't work because
[52:07] no human being was sinless but then to
[52:11] to have a sinless man he created a body
[52:14] lived in the body and here is a sinless
[52:18] perfect lamb without spot without
[52:20] blemish could then go to Calgary and in
[52:23] the form of a man dying for the sins of
[52:26] man Lord of God hallelujah amen praise
[52:30] God I'm going to close this off here
[52:33] quickly now he says do you realize what
[52:38] we are doing here
[52:42] where did we come from
[52:46] or what business we have got being
[52:51] down here
[52:53] what business you got being done here
[52:56] you
[52:58] you should have stayed back there but
[53:01] you know we know what the scripture says
[53:03] God sent you down here for some purpose
[53:06] that which you consciously may not be
[53:08] aware of but by the time you finish this
[53:11] Earthly life you would have fulfilled
[53:12] that purpose
[53:14] you don't necessarily have to literally
[53:16] know your purpose you know it's good
[53:19] they have these books these tapes these
[53:21] things teaching you that but you don't
[53:23] consciously have to know what your
[53:25] purpose is because you're going to walk
[53:28] right into it by the holy spirit that
[53:31] dwells in your life
[53:33] praise the Lord amen we are not here to
[53:36] dramatize or or practice Christianity in
[53:40] a way where we have to know how to act
[53:43] so we can fulfill that purpose we'll let
[53:47] go and let God the Holy Spirit lead us
[53:50] guide us and move us into that Divine
[53:53] Purpose under a state of grace
[53:56] hallelujah praise God or say the other
[53:59] way under a condition of unconscious
[54:01] godliness where the spirit of God takes
[54:04] you into that condition and that
[54:06] position praise the Lord that you might
[54:09] fulfill his purpose amen we wasn't put
[54:13] here by chance
[54:15] praise God we were put here for a
[54:19] purpose
[54:21] and we must serve that purpose
[54:25] but still
[54:27] we are back on that free moral agency
[54:30] where we can serve him or we can reject
[54:34] just like Adam was in the beginning not
[54:39] words God wants to show to Satan that
[54:42] look I'm gonna put them down here in
[54:45] other words he's doing the same thing
[54:46] like he did with job and he puts us in
[54:49] that position says okay go try him all
[54:51] you want but he he's not gonna curse me
[54:54] why because he was a seed of God he was
[54:57] a gene of God and he couldn't do it so
[55:00] so God have confidence in job praise the
[55:04] Lord hallelujah not in the manual but in
[55:07] the gene that was in Job that there is
[55:09] no way that Satan is going to be able to
[55:12] attempt that or do this for the seed of
[55:14] God could not commit sin praise be to
[55:18] God hallelujah amen and so we see how
[55:22] God works through now today through
[55:26] human beings
[55:29] now it's gone from Jesus it's come down
[55:31] to his people his bride and that's what
[55:35] he wants to work through today it's you
[55:38] and me Iris hands his feet his body for
[55:41] him to make himself manifest he'll see
[55:45] and he has to do that
[55:47] working through human beings to redeem
[55:51] other human beings
[55:54] so he can take you and work through you
[55:59] to redeem all Humanity if you are
[56:04] completely dedicated to him in
[56:08] everything
[56:10] so who are the Messiah it's for this day
[56:14] it's not Jesus back there
[56:17] it's us here today
[56:20] God
[56:21] hiding in simplicity
[56:25] and revealing himself in the same
[56:28] this is what is happening God in this
[56:32] hour
[56:33] the work of redemption through his
[56:35] beloved bride Hallelujah my father
[56:39] working until now I'm working Jesus
[56:41] working until now we are working we are
[56:44] working by the Holy Spirit finishing the
[56:47] work of redemption praise the Lord you
[56:50] say oh Jesus said it's finished from
[56:52] Calvary but you'll find he's he he did
[56:55] not
[56:56] complete or do everything he had to do
[56:58] because you read the book of Acts and
[57:00] you read Parts where it says and they
[57:03] they were doing continuing to do what
[57:07] Jesus left for them to do they were
[57:10] doing continuing his work and the
[57:12] brother Brandon says it too he in in the
[57:15] Cults here praise the Lord I don't have
[57:18] that before me here but he says that
[57:20] praise the Lord so therefore
[57:24] if you're a woman dedicate your morals
[57:28] if you're a man dedicate your morals
[57:32] dedicate your minds
[57:34] dedicate your thinking dedicate your
[57:38] heart dedicate your soul dedicate all
[57:42] that you are and let Christ work through
[57:45] you oh what a glorious thing yes I know
[57:51] we have some more Rivers we have to
[57:54] cross
[57:55] we know we have bridges that we may have
[57:59] to go over but put all your mind and
[58:03] your thoughts on the North Star Jesus
[58:05] Christ the center of God
[58:08] and don't move from it stay right with
[58:11] it and it will bring you straight to
[58:14] Christ just like it did when it went to
[58:19] the Meiji praise the Lord God bless you
[58:23] all here tonight and bless these few
[58:26] words to your hearts my heart and we
[58:30] recognize him they dumb from his glory

[58:39] place and I pray that that will Empower
