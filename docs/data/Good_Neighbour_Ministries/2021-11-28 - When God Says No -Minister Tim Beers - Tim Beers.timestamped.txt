[36:06] paul says i want to know in the power of

[36:18] we are walking living epistles red of
[36:21] all man
[36:24] nothing nothing short of it

[37:11] what i i felt led to bring out this
[37:13] morning
[37:14] and whatever god will do amen
[37:16] because we we believe in god above man
[37:20] we believe that god can speak to every
[37:22] individual heart because we're all here
[37:24] at different levels and given different
[37:27] levels of faith and portions of faith
[37:29] and i believe god will speak to our
[37:31] hearts according to our faith amen
[37:34] amen hallelujah amen glory to god
[37:39] amen
[37:40] when god says no

[37:46] look at that statement when god says no
[37:48] what comes to your mind amen
[37:51] disappointment
[37:52] rejection
[37:54] amen
[37:55] but this morning we want to see we want
[37:58] to take a look that when god says no
[38:00] it's a blessing amen
[38:03] it's a blessing my brothers and sisters
[38:06] because he's the all-knowing god
[38:09] amen he knows the beginning he knows the
[38:12] end amen
[38:14] i started to work in you you didn't
[38:16] start that work i started the work and i
[38:19] will finish it i know what it's going to
[38:21] take to complete it
[38:23] and sometimes no
[38:25] is the answer
[38:28] to complete it
[38:30] amen let us turn to our scripture
[38:34] in second corinthians slide 2
[38:37] 12 7
[38:39] to 10.
[38:47] this scripture
[38:49] any scripture is so compound
[38:52] it's like the roman candle brother
[38:54] branham says it just keeps going and
[38:56] exploding and exploding
[38:58] but this scripture
[39:00] is when god says no
[39:04] amen
[39:07] at least
[39:09] and least i should be exalted above
[39:11] measure
[39:13] through the abundance of revelations
[39:17] listen i'm telling you if there's
[39:18] anybody that has
[39:20] abundance of revelation in this hour
[39:22] it's the bride of jesus christ
[39:25] some of you sitting here this morning
[39:27] have abundance of revelation amen
[39:30] and that is glorious
[39:32] but there is given to me
[39:34] a thorn in the flesh
[39:36] a messenger of satan to buffet me
[39:40] lest i should
[39:43] be exalted don't look at the don't look
[39:45] at the thorn in the flesh don't look at
[39:47] satan being the messenger but lest
[39:51] i should be exalted above measure
[39:56] for this thing i besought the lord
[39:58] thrice
[39:59] three times
[40:01] that it might depart from me
[40:04] and he said unto me
[40:06] my grace is sufficient for thee in other
[40:08] words no three times
[40:11] paul asked three times god said no three
[40:14] times
[40:15] for my strength is made perfect in
[40:18] weakness
[40:20] now listen
[40:22] most gladly therefore will i rather
[40:25] glory in my infirmities
[40:28] that the power of christ may rest upon
[40:32] me
[40:34] wow
[40:35] therefore i take pleasure in infirmities
[40:38] and reproaches and necessaries and
[40:40] persecutions
[40:42] in distress
[40:44] for christ's sake
[40:46] for when i am weak
[40:48] then
[40:50] i am strong
[40:53] wow
[40:55] we love to hear victorious we love to
[40:58] hear about us feeling great and feeling
[41:01] strong
[41:02] and being healed and
[41:04] having no problems no stress
[41:08] but paul's saying i glory
[41:10] if that is god's will
[41:13] i approached god three times he said
[41:17] and he said no to me three times
[41:21] so he's saying if that is god's will for
[41:24] my life then i will glory in his will
[41:29] regardless of what it is
[41:31] because he
[41:33] but paul knew god knew what was best for
[41:37] him
[41:38] and what it would take for paul to
[41:41] become strong is to be weak
[41:46] and to keep them straight in line and
[41:49] keep them humble
[41:51] let us pray father
[41:53] bless your word now your word is blessed
[41:57] blessed to our hearts
[42:00] bless the speaker
[42:02] who needs you desperately lord
[42:05] and a hearer
[42:07] who needs you desperately
[42:10] because flesh and blood has not revealed
[42:12] this unto
[42:14] any one of us lord but my father which
[42:17] is in heaven
[42:18] has revealed this
[42:20] reveal your word this morning father
[42:23] may you be lifted up
[42:25] and you said if you're lifted up this
[42:27] morning and honored and praised in our
[42:29] hearts
[42:30] and nothing no other god stands before
[42:33] you
[42:34] then you will draw us
[42:36] unto you father
[42:38] into heavenly places grant these things
[42:40] i pray in jesus name amen
[42:42] god bless you you're seated
[42:45] amen
[42:48] glory to god
[42:52] praise his name amen
[42:55] slide three
[43:00] yes we love it
[43:02] when god
[43:03] answers our prayers
[43:06] in first john 5 14
[43:08] to 15.
[43:12] but we want most
[43:14] is when he agrees
[43:16] with our requests
[43:19] and he says yes
[43:22] each and every one of us
[43:24] amen
[43:25] we want to hear yes when we pray
[43:28] yes
[43:29] yes lord
[43:31] amen
[43:33] but sometimes god answers no
[43:36] or not yet
[43:38] or wait
[43:41] amen
[43:43] as the good father
[43:46] will not grant us
[43:48] that which is not
[43:49] in our long-term best interest
[43:52] even
[43:53] when we plead to god
[43:56] as paul did pleading
[43:59] you might be pleading about something
[44:01] this morning
[44:02] over and over and over
[44:06] but maybe you haven't realized
[44:09] that the answer is no
[44:12] why i don't know
[44:15] we may never understand some answers
[44:17] that god says to us are mysteries
[44:22] but it's not about whether it's a
[44:23] mystery whether we understand or we
[44:25] don't understand
[44:27] it's our it's about our faith believing
[44:30] and trusting
[44:32] that he knows best
[44:36] you come out with anything this morning
[44:38] i pray your faith will come out
[44:40] believing and trusting that god knows
[44:43] best
[44:45] for our lives
[44:50] hallelujah
[44:56] god's yes answers builds our face
[44:59] faith builds our confidence in prayer
[45:03] but how do we respond
[45:05] when he says no
[45:08] accepting god's no can be a sticky
[45:11] situation in our lives
[45:14] amen the bible says
[45:16] in james a double-minded man is unstable
[45:19] in all his ways
[45:22] sometimes we don't know what to ask for
[45:24] god
[45:25] from god
[45:26] because we don't see his clear plan for
[45:29] our lives because it's got to be
[45:31] revealed
[45:33] that's where
[45:34] misinterpretations come in
[45:36] where people misplace the word in their
[45:38] lives
[45:41] because god still got to reveal
[45:45] it's an unfolding unrevealing plan that
[45:49] god is doing in our lives
[45:51] we don't know what's going to happen
[45:53] next week but we know who holds our next
[45:56] week
[45:58] we can look to the promises and see
[46:01] i don't know how it's going to take me
[46:04] to the rapture but i know i'm going in
[46:06] the rapture i know there's going to be a
[46:08] body change
[46:10] but in between that i got to trust and
[46:12] believe god
[46:15] and when he says no
[46:17] it doesn't hinder me
[46:19] it doesn't stop me
[46:22] it doesn't stop me from believing
[46:26] not if you're a true believer not have
[46:28] you been born again
[46:32] hallelujah
[46:36] yeah we look at the verses look at mark
[46:39] 11 24
[46:41] matthew
[46:42] 21 22
[46:45] these scriptures here
[46:47] if we look at them
[46:50] they're all about ask and you shall
[46:52] receive
[46:54] anything that you desire
[46:56] and you ask for
[46:58] i will grant it to you
[47:00] and we build doctrines around that
[47:05] we build like that is the only we take
[47:08] these scriptures
[47:10] and we look at them
[47:11] and we believe that that's the only
[47:14] thing that we claim in our lives
[47:17] that god is obligated look what he says
[47:20] here look what he says there
[47:28] but we need to take a step back and
[47:30] consider
[47:31] in acts 20 27
[47:34] the whole council of god
[47:37] we got to take the whole word
[47:40] all of his characteristics
[47:43] and put it into plain view
[47:46] when we judge anything their saints
[47:48] shall judge the earth it said examine
[47:50] your faith amen judge your faith
[47:53] judge your own heart
[47:57] we need to take the whole counsel of god
[47:59] the whole word of god everything god
[48:02] says
[48:04] not only when he says ask and you shall
[48:06] receive
[48:07] seek and you shall find knock and it
[48:10] shall be open to you
[48:12] but also
[48:13] no paul
[48:16] i'm not removing this pain and suffering
[48:18] i'm not removing this thorn from you
[48:22] that's praying
[48:24] with revelation that's praying as this
[48:27] whole series is going on
[48:29] different parts of it that's praying
[48:31] when you're grown up
[48:35] in maturity and faith
[48:39] hallelujah
[48:45] slide four
[48:49] god says no
[48:51] when he has a bigger perspective we know
[48:54] that saints
[48:55] he sees the bigger picture
[48:57] he sees what we can't see he say he sees
[49:01] our whole life he sees from beginning to
[49:03] end
[49:04] amen
[49:06] we are limited in what we see
[49:09] god sees the wider view we don't
[49:13] god can see the future we can't
[49:16] god will always see stuff that we can't
[49:18] see
[49:19] he can see around the curve
[49:22] he can see the beginning the end the
[49:24] future
[49:25] he can see the impact of every choice
[49:28] every decision that we make
[49:32] he says i'll make all things work
[49:34] together for good to them that love me
[49:37] sometimes our choices our decisions are
[49:40] wrong they're bad he sees those things
[49:44] and he sees where that's going to lead
[49:46] you up the road so when you're praying
[49:49] making those decisions and those choices
[49:51] in your life he's got to say no
[49:54] i can't remove that from you
[49:58] because you're making wrong choices
[50:00] you're making wrong decisions for you
[50:02] for your family for your loved ones
[50:04] whatever
[50:05] i gotta keep that pain i gotta keep that
[50:08] thorn i gotta keep that there until you
[50:11] start seeing my plan my purpose for your
[50:14] life and making the right choices and
[50:16] the right decisions
[50:19] it's all good saints
[50:21] this is all good
[50:24] amen
[50:26] hallelujah
[50:29] amen
[50:33] thank you lord
[50:34] several times in the scriptures
[50:38] god did not do
[50:41] what people asked
[50:43] he is god he can see things
[50:46] we can't
[50:48] look at king david
[50:52] he pleaded with the lord for the life of
[50:55] his and besheba's infant son
[50:58] david fast and prayed for days
[51:01] but on the seventh day
[51:04] the child died
[51:06] second samuel 12 16 18
[51:10] god said no
[51:15] why did god say no
[51:18] look what david did
[51:20] he took another man's wife
[51:24] he got the man's husband the wife
[51:27] besheba's husband killed
[51:31] and gave it look at him he's a man after
[51:34] god's own heart god said that
[51:37] but look at it
[51:39] why god said no you're not going to keep
[51:41] that son even though you fast and you
[51:44] prayed
[51:45] you cried out to me
[51:48] god is a just god he's a true righteous
[51:51] god
[51:52] he cannot honor sin
[51:54] [Music]
[51:56] so he said no david
[51:58] was david a cast away no was david lost
[52:01] no
[52:02] but david the sword never left his house
[52:06] until he was fully purged
[52:09] what made david do that was there was
[52:11] evil in his heart
[52:13] and that sword had to come and purge
[52:15] that out
[52:17] but he was he still beloved of god yes
[52:21] was he still a man after god's own heart
[52:23] yes
[52:24] did god still answer prayer in the
[52:26] future for david yes
[52:35] david's response
[52:39] listen
[52:42] he respond in a way that models for all
[52:45] of us
[52:47] he accepted
[52:48] that what god had done
[52:50] was right and good
[52:54] my my my
[52:57] i wonder if
[53:00] in our hearts
[53:03] when something happens in your life
[53:07] that you can respond like that
[53:10] instead of being bitter
[53:12] angry with god i'm angry with god i've
[53:16] heard that many times
[53:17] i'm disappointed in god
[53:20] you know my brothers and sisters all
[53:23] these kind of
[53:24] attitudes and
[53:26] and and and behaviors
[53:29] are passing away from the bride of jesus
[53:31] christ
[53:33] to the others i don't know
[53:35] but to the bride amen she's becoming
[53:39] that word made flesh again today
[53:42] and i'm speaking about the word
[53:46] i'm speaking how the word reacted
[53:50] when it became flesh
[53:55] amen
[53:58] hallelujah
[54:02] and he went into the house of the lord
[54:05] in verse 20
[54:07] and worshiped
[54:09] my my my worship he went in god's
[54:12] presence and worshiped god
[54:15] you don't think david knew in his heart
[54:18] you don't think you don't know in your
[54:20] heart when you make a mistake or when
[54:22] you sin are you disobedient to god or in
[54:25] rebellion to god
[54:27] david knew
[54:29] but he went into the house of refuge
[54:32] amen where his strong and mighty tower
[54:34] was he went in there and he worshipped
[54:37] god because that's the only refuge that
[54:40] he had
[54:42] no other help could help him
[54:44] nothing in this world would you if you
[54:46] could still depend on the world you can
[54:49] still depend on family and and man to
[54:52] help you
[54:53] you haven't arrived yet there's nothing
[54:56] that can help a child of god but god
[54:58] himself he left that for himself
[55:04] i'm a jealous god
[55:06] over you
[55:08] my people
[55:10] i love you with a love eternal love
[55:16] you may not understand everything i do
[55:18] and the way i do it in your life is
[55:21] because i love you
[55:26] hallelujah
[55:30] david hoped for a different outcome
[55:32] but god is god
[55:35] and god has a right to make a life and
[55:38] death decision
[55:40] blessed be the name of the lord he
[55:42] giveth he taketh away
[55:44] still blessed be his name
[55:48] in his grief
[55:49] david did not become bitter towards the
[55:51] lord or turn away from god
[55:54] david's response to god's no was a
[55:57] deeper worship a deeper surrender
[56:01] even in his heartache
[56:05] even in his heartache there was a deeper
[56:07] surrender a deeper worship
[56:11] oh hallelujah
[56:14] hallelujah
[56:15] i hope after this service you're just
[56:17] going to bless the name of the lord god
[56:20] of israel amen for all the no's
[56:23] amen i mean we we come in here yo yes
[56:26] yes yes yes oh hallelujah yes the lord
[56:30] said yes the lord answered my prayer and
[56:32] he said yes glory to god

[56:37] hallelujah father
[56:40] not my will but thy will be done if it's
[56:42] a no blessed be your name
[56:46] hallelujah
[56:48] glory to god the new testaments give us
[56:50] more examples of times when god said no
[56:53] to his servants the apostle paul
[56:56] was sent to travel through asia minor to
[56:59] preach the gospel
[57:01] of god in acts uh
[57:04] in acts 16 6-9
[57:06] paul thought he
[57:08] he understood the plan of god
[57:10] he believed he was to continue in asia
[57:13] but the holy spirit said no paul
[57:16] because paul's desire
[57:19] was to listen
[57:20] and obey come on saints was to listen
[57:24] and obey regardless of what the costs
[57:27] he left asia minor and went to macedonia
[57:31] instead
[57:33] now listen he started churches that
[57:36] impacted the whole world
[57:39] by god's no
[57:42] to him
[57:43] and by his obedience
[57:47] started churches to impact does god know
[57:49] what he's doing
[57:51] does god know where he's leading us and
[57:53] why he's leading us there
[57:55] why why our brothers here and the
[57:58] ministry here gets led in a certain way
[58:00] does god know what he's doing
[58:02] when we want to do this we want to do
[58:04] that god says no go over here and do
[58:06] this we want to be like paul
[58:09] amen and just come under obedience to it
[58:13] amen
[58:15] hallelujah his response to god's no was
[58:18] instant obedience
[58:20] and a change of direction
[58:23] not fighting up
[58:27] come on
[58:28] not arguing with god
[58:31] not debating with god
[58:33] not complaining to god
[58:36] but was instantly obedience to god
[58:40] when you realize who you're talking to
[58:42] and who's talking back to you you're
[58:44] going to respond this way
[58:46] i got no life i got no breath i can't do
[58:50] i can't live tomorrow without him
[58:53] i understand that and i understand that
[58:55] more and more than i ever did before

[59:17] that's a promise of god
[59:20] god answers every single prayer
[59:22] he doesn't answer in the way you like
[59:24] every time but he answers
[59:27] no is an answer wait is an answer grow
[59:29] up is an answer in a little while as an
[59:31] answer
[59:32] god never leaves prayer unanswered
[59:35] hallelujah
[59:38] never does
[59:39] slide 6
[59:41] in hebrews 4 13.
[59:44] now listen saints
[59:46] we read these scriptures over and over
[59:49] let it become a reality to you
[59:52] it says for the word of god is quick
[59:55] and powerful what did john say
[59:58] john says in the beginning was the word
[1:00:00] the word was with god and the word was
[1:00:03] god
[1:00:04] that is who we're talking about this
[1:00:07] morning
[1:00:08] that is who is controlling our lives
[1:00:11] amen if we're born again and filled with
[1:00:13] his spirit amen this is who's in control
[1:00:16] of our lives amen and you're gonna
[1:00:18] you're gonna see through this scripture
[1:00:21] why he knows all things
[1:00:23] he sees all things and he has the right
[1:00:26] answer for you amen why
[1:00:30] because the word of god which is god is
[1:00:33] quick and powerful and sharper than any
[1:00:36] two-edged sword piercing even dividing
[1:00:38] asunder the soul and spirit
[1:00:41] and of the joints of the marrow
[1:00:44] he's a discerner of the thoughts and the
[1:00:46] intents
[1:00:48] of the heart
[1:00:49] amen
[1:00:51] it's quick
[1:00:53] it's powerful
[1:00:54] when it gets into your life
[1:00:57] it's quick it's powerful when it
[1:01:00] discerns your hearts when it discerns
[1:01:02] your thoughts it's quick and it's
[1:01:04] powerful when it even discerns the very
[1:01:07] intentions that you have the very
[1:01:09] mortars that you have it's quick and
[1:01:12] it's powerful
[1:01:14] and it's sharp
[1:01:16] now listen
[1:01:18] hallelujah
[1:01:20] neither is any creature that is not
[1:01:23] manifest in his sight
[1:01:26] all things are open to him
[1:01:29] but all things are naked and open unto
[1:01:32] the eyes of him
[1:01:35] who sees us
[1:01:37] oh my
[1:01:40] where
[1:01:42] who are we talking about here
[1:01:46] the word of god
[1:01:47] god himself
[1:01:51] we're exposed
[1:01:55] the bible says
[1:01:58] we're naked
[1:02:01] there's not any more exposed you can be
[1:02:03] in the flesh than being naked
[1:02:07] and that's what we are to god
[1:02:10] it says right here
[1:02:12] that he knows the motives and intentions
[1:02:13] of your heart
[1:02:16] you know sometimes you might think that
[1:02:18] your motives and your attentions are
[1:02:19] good
[1:02:21] david wanted to build the temple
[1:02:24] solomon's temple god says no
[1:02:27] too much blood on your hands
[1:02:31] solomon's going to build it
[1:02:35] god is the one who redirects our motives
[1:02:39] and our intentions
[1:02:41] that's why he says
[1:02:43] god is his own interpreter he will make
[1:02:46] it plain we are not to interpret the
[1:02:48] word of god but god will interpret it in
[1:02:52] our lives god will bring it to pass in
[1:02:54] our lives
[1:02:56] god will show us
[1:02:58] not us
[1:02:59] because in us
[1:03:01] there's wrong motives wrong intentions
[1:03:03] amen
[1:03:07] wrong desires
[1:03:11] hallelujah
[1:03:14] amen
[1:03:16] there are a lot of examples in the bible
[1:03:19] where god says no to great man and woman
[1:03:21] of faith
[1:03:23] prayers that were prayed by abraham god
[1:03:26] said no
[1:03:27] moses
[1:03:28] no
[1:03:29] daniel
[1:03:30] no
[1:03:31] job no jonah no elijah no
[1:03:36] peter paul god said no to them
[1:03:39] there are prayers
[1:03:41] that were unanswered
[1:03:43] meaning they weren't answered the way we
[1:03:45] asked
[1:03:46] for them to be answered
[1:03:48] god said no
[1:03:50] we hear and say all the time that god
[1:03:52] answers prayer in the bible
[1:03:54] ask and you shall receive seek and ye
[1:03:56] shall find
[1:03:57] and we have that confidence
[1:04:00] in the word that he hears
[1:04:02] and he answers prayer and we don't have
[1:04:04] to lose that confidence because he does
[1:04:07] hear and answers prayers
[1:04:09] but we need to get that yes out of our
[1:04:11] minds as the only absolute because it's
[1:04:14] not
[1:04:15] because no is an absolute
[1:04:17] maybe he's an absolute weight is an
[1:04:19] absolute
[1:04:21] that's part of our walk is part of our
[1:04:23] experience with god and knowing god
[1:04:26] amen
[1:04:27] hallelujah
[1:04:30] glory to god
[1:04:32] thank you lord
[1:04:36] slide seven
[1:04:39] second chronicles 7 14
[1:04:41] if my people which are called by my name
[1:04:45] shall humble themselves
[1:04:47] we heard it in this series
[1:04:50] being humble
[1:04:52] it's a very important
[1:04:54] characteristics and attribute
[1:04:56] that we need before god
[1:05:00] and pray
[1:05:01] we need to humble ourselves
[1:05:03] we need to pray
[1:05:05] and we need to seek his face and when we
[1:05:08] humble ourselves in his presence and we
[1:05:12] pray and we pray till we break through
[1:05:15] not just pray all what you want to pray
[1:05:17] god hear my prayer hear my request
[1:05:21] hear my words but you pray until you
[1:05:24] break through and then when you break
[1:05:26] through you shut up
[1:05:28] and he speaks
[1:05:32] have you been there
[1:05:34] if you haven't been there you need to
[1:05:36] pray through and be there you need to
[1:05:38] ask god lord i need to get to that place
[1:05:41] because when you break the sound barrier
[1:05:44] you go into that peace and that all
[1:05:48] where brother branham said he said when
[1:05:50] i was just sitting there i was praying
[1:05:51] and praying praying praying for a
[1:05:52] message all of a sudden i broke through
[1:05:54] he said
[1:05:56] and all of a sudden the lord starts
[1:05:58] speaking scriptures to him
[1:06:00] making things clear
[1:06:03] there's nothing that becomes clear in
[1:06:04] your life you might be struggling with
[1:06:06] something you might be confused about
[1:06:08] something you might be wrestling like
[1:06:10] jacob wrestling with the angel with
[1:06:12] something but let me tell you if you
[1:06:14] humble yourself
[1:06:16] lord i'm nothing without you
[1:06:19] lord i need your answer
[1:06:22] i need your understanding
[1:06:25] i need you to help me to see what i need
[1:06:27] to see in this situation
[1:06:31] and pray
[1:06:32] earnestly until you break through that's
[1:06:34] what it means don't pray honestly
[1:06:36] repetition repetition repetition
[1:06:38] you pray until you break through we're
[1:06:40] praying for our purpose my brothers and
[1:06:42] sisters everything is for a purpose and
[1:06:45] what is it to connect with god to come
[1:06:48] face to face with god
[1:06:51] in his presence
[1:06:52] what is this all about his only brother
[1:06:54] branham is going to come face to face
[1:06:56] with god only brother branham is going
[1:06:58] to has come to that place where god
[1:07:00] spoke to him no
[1:07:03] no
[1:07:05] i don't believe that
[1:07:08] i believe the word is being made flesh
[1:07:10] again today in the bride i believe the
[1:07:13] same god that gave brother branham those
[1:07:15] experience
[1:07:18] and met with him
[1:07:19] and developed a relationship with him
[1:07:21] molded him shaped him
[1:07:23] developed him
[1:07:25] brung faith and perfect faith with
[1:07:27] inside of him is the same god it's got
[1:07:30] to be saints
[1:07:31] how's his rapture is going to take place
[1:07:33] if we just think we can stay at home and
[1:07:36] listen to the tapes and
[1:07:37] and that's it they're good
[1:07:40] they're
[1:07:40] good yes the voice of god comes off of
[1:07:43] those tapes but let me tell you the
[1:07:45] voice of god is sounding out with many
[1:07:47] waters this morning the voices in the
[1:07:50] bride of jesus christ this morning
[1:07:52] deities on her lips this morning

[1:08:13] god bringing to perfection it's god

[1:08:49] behavior that paul had when it came his
[1:08:51] way that david had when it came his way
[1:08:54] they're all wicked ways

[1:09:21] that god is in control

[1:09:26] in your life

[1:09:40] has a right to do what he wants to do
[1:09:44] in every one of those
[1:09:46] situations and sometimes he does those
[1:09:49] things as to see your attitude
[1:09:51] oh you got great faith god just laughs
[1:09:53] at us my brothers and my sisters you got
[1:09:55] great faith look what god's doing my
[1:09:57] life look at all my interpretations that
[1:09:59] i got of the word of god great abundance
[1:10:01] of revelation
[1:10:04] god gives you a messenger of satan
[1:10:07] to buffet you
[1:10:09] to humble you
[1:10:13] we say
[1:10:15] lots of prayers
[1:10:17] lots of power
[1:10:19] little prayer
[1:10:20] little power no prayer
[1:10:23] no power
[1:10:25] we get excited when we talk about prayer
[1:10:27] because why
[1:10:29] why saints
[1:10:31] because he's a prayer answering god
[1:10:34] but we only see it in one direction
[1:10:36] amen oh yeah he's a heart fixing god
[1:10:41] he's a problem solving god
[1:10:43] he's a pain relieving god he's a way
[1:10:46] making god he's a cancer killing god
[1:10:48] he's a job finding god he's a marriage
[1:10:51] saving god
[1:10:53] but is he still god when he says no
[1:10:56] to any one of these requests
[1:11:03] oh my
[1:11:06] you look in the word of god don't take
[1:11:08] what i'm saying go back in your bible go
[1:11:10] back in the scriptures if you don't
[1:11:12] believe it it's not my problem
[1:11:15] i'm preaching the word of god this
[1:11:16] morning
[1:11:18] if you're sitting here this morning i
[1:11:19] only accept yes i only accept yes you've
[1:11:21] got a stubborn spirit on you from the
[1:11:23] devil and i rebuke it in the name of
[1:11:26] jesus christ
[1:11:27] [Music]
[1:11:30] the word of god is still a discerner of
[1:11:32] the thoughts and tense of the heart
[1:11:34] we see god saying yes to daniel in the
[1:11:38] lion's den yes to the three hebrews
[1:11:39] children in the fiery furnace
[1:11:42] yes to the woman with the issue of blood
[1:11:44] yes to the crippled man at the pool
[1:11:46] when god says yes we jump for joy when
[1:11:49] he gives us freedom when he gives us
[1:11:51] money he opens doors he blesses us with
[1:11:53] protection he helps our children when he
[1:11:56] says yes
[1:11:58] we jump for joy amen glory to god thank
[1:12:02] you jesus yes
[1:12:05] yes
[1:12:06] he said yes to moses
[1:12:08] to moses request to see his glory in
[1:12:11] exodus 33 17
[1:12:13] he said yes to solomon for the request
[1:12:16] for his wisdom
[1:12:18] in first kings 3
[1:12:20] 11-13 and jesus said yes to everyone who
[1:12:24] asked them for healing
[1:12:25] and help matthew 8 16.
[1:12:29] he said yes
[1:12:32] yes i want to see your glory
[1:12:34] god's going to say yeah
[1:12:36] amen yes to that
[1:12:39] i want to see his glory yes god wants
[1:12:42] that
[1:12:43] solomon asks for wisdom you want wisdom
[1:12:46] you need wisdom we all do
[1:12:48] revelation we need it
[1:12:50] god says yes
[1:12:53] i'll give you wisdom i'll give you
[1:12:55] revelation i'll show you why you have to
[1:12:57] go through what you're going through it
[1:12:59] doesn't mean i'm going to take it away
[1:13:00] but you're going to understand like paul
[1:13:02] understood
[1:13:03] amen
[1:13:05] but our faith-filled request
[1:13:09] doesn't supersede god's sovereign rule
[1:13:13] if he was bound by your prayers
[1:13:16] as some teach
[1:13:20] he would in effect cease to be god
[1:13:24] we love to pray we should pray we preach
[1:13:27] on praying
[1:13:28] but god ain't bound to your prayers
[1:13:32] god will answer every prayer
[1:13:34] but it ain't bound to them to your
[1:13:36] request and how you're praying
[1:13:38] and what you want
[1:13:41] because he knows what's best for us
[1:13:43] amen
[1:13:46] what do we do when god says no we pray
[1:13:48] in faith
[1:13:49] and fasting
[1:13:50] what we do everything we can do but god
[1:13:52] still says no
[1:13:53] you pray for some and god says yes you
[1:13:56] pray for others and god says no remember
[1:13:59] brother branham the same in the same
[1:14:02] situation came up before him
[1:14:04] and billy paul was standing right there
[1:14:07] same situation
[1:14:10] and he said yes to the one woman
[1:14:13] and the same situation came up and he
[1:14:15] said no he says dad why'd you say yes
[1:14:18] and why you say no
[1:14:19] because i never said yes or no god said
[1:14:21] it
[1:14:22] because one was telling the truth
[1:14:24] and one was lying
[1:14:31] wow wow
[1:14:34] why do some people get relief from pain
[1:14:36] their pain and others don't
[1:14:39] i know what that's like
[1:14:41] i've seen and i'm here to right here
[1:14:42] manifested
[1:14:44] people get prayed for their pain their
[1:14:46] back pain is gone
[1:14:48] and i still got mine
[1:14:51] i still got mine this morning i couldn't
[1:14:52] barely get off the chair
[1:14:55] i still got it but i'm going to glory in
[1:14:57] it
[1:14:58] i'm going to praise god in it
[1:15:00] i'm up here
[1:15:02] because i want to serve and worship the
[1:15:05] lord jesus christ because i know he's
[1:15:07] not limited to just oh he doesn't meet
[1:15:10] god or make him god to me because he can
[1:15:13] take away my pain good if he does if he
[1:15:15] doesn't good to
[1:15:17] praise his name anyhow
[1:15:21] if he does and if he doesn't praise his
[1:15:23] name
[1:15:24] i'm going to do my best
[1:15:26] to serve him
[1:15:29] he's the only thing he's life to me he's
[1:15:32] the only thing that is life to me
[1:15:34] amen
[1:15:35] and you too
[1:15:38] hallelujah
[1:15:41] why do some couples pray for a child
[1:15:45] and they get a child and others just a
[1:15:47] sincere claim in the promises of god and
[1:15:50] they don't get a child
[1:15:53] and their hearts are broken
[1:15:55] by that
[1:15:56] in other words why does god sometimes
[1:15:59] say yes and why does he sometimes say no
[1:16:02] he has a reason for doing all things my
[1:16:05] brothers and sisters
[1:16:06] oh my he's such an individual god this
[1:16:09] is such an individual walk individual
[1:16:12] experience with god we are not at the
[1:16:14] same place amen
[1:16:16] i might be ahead of you i might be
[1:16:18] humble in you in some areas amen and you
[1:16:21] might be prideful in those areas and in
[1:16:23] other areas i might be stubborn and you
[1:16:25] might be humble so god knows he's
[1:16:28] designing each and every one of us we
[1:16:30] are his workmanship
[1:16:32] don't become one another's workmanship
[1:16:34] don't criticize don't judge each and
[1:16:37] every one of us
[1:16:39] god is the judge
[1:16:42] you want to find fault we say it many
[1:16:44] times in me there's lots of faults you
[1:16:46] can find in me
[1:16:47] all over the place amen but i'm not
[1:16:50] looking through your eyes i'm not
[1:16:52] looking through my eyes i'm looking
[1:16:54] through the blood i'm looking through
[1:16:55] his eyes i'm looking at what he says i
[1:16:57] am
[1:17:00] and i know my brothers and sisters i'm
[1:17:03] sinless
[1:17:04] [Laughter]
[1:17:11] i
[1:17:12] don't do iniquity iniquity is not
[1:17:14] imputed unto me
[1:17:17] my my my
[1:17:19] i think the bride is going to start when
[1:17:21] she starts raising up to that level
[1:17:23] going to start being misunderstood even
[1:17:25] in the message
[1:17:26] misunderstood
[1:17:29] oh yeah this is the day that brother
[1:17:31] brought him long to see not messes
[1:17:34] puppets and messes uh churches just
[1:17:36] sitting around being
[1:17:38] lazy lukewarm and religious
[1:17:40] but he wanted to see that word amen
[1:17:43] raised to a level inside of hers where
[1:17:45] she recognizes who she is where she
[1:17:48] becomes invincible amen to what to
[1:17:51] herself to sin to the elements this
[1:17:54] world
[1:17:56] invisible my
[1:17:59] glory
[1:18:01] thank you lord jesus
[1:18:04] blessed be the name of the lord god of
[1:18:05] israel
[1:18:07] blessed be your name above all names
[1:18:09] lord
[1:18:10] ah hallelujah
[1:18:13] slide 8
[1:18:16] hallelujah
[1:18:18] there's three things my brothers and
[1:18:20] sisters
[1:18:22] that we do when we go into prayer
[1:18:24] we affirm god's power
[1:18:27] knowing that god can do anything that
[1:18:30] everything is possible with god
[1:18:32] he can take care of every situation that
[1:18:35] we have he can take away suffering he
[1:18:38] can take away pain instantly he's all
[1:18:41] powerful he's all-knowing
[1:18:43] we go
[1:18:44] affirming his power in prayer
[1:18:48] then we go with passion in prayer
[1:18:51] pleading and asking and praying with
[1:18:54] passion and desire in our hearts to see
[1:18:58] god moving to see god manifesting to see
[1:19:01] his glory come down
[1:19:03] amen
[1:19:09] so then when we pray
[1:19:11] we affirm his power
[1:19:13] we ask with passion
[1:19:16] then we accept his plan
[1:19:19] oh my they got to come together my
[1:19:21] brothers and sisters
[1:19:22] they have to fall in place when they
[1:19:25] fall in place the door opens amen
[1:19:28] it all opens up to you
[1:19:31] amen we accept
[1:19:32] his plan for our lives
[1:19:34] however god i want most what is your
[1:19:38] will
[1:19:38] yes
[1:19:39] i don't want to go through this
[1:19:41] suffering i don't want to go through
[1:19:42] this problem i don't want to go through
[1:19:44] this pain but nevertheless not what i
[1:19:47] want i even want more than what you want
[1:19:50] for my life and what your plan is i want
[1:19:52] your purpose i want your perspective i
[1:19:55] want your will however your will is not
[1:19:58] mine but yours to be done
[1:20:01] that that's what i want lord
[1:20:04] when you pray that prayer god is pleased
[1:20:07] because he knows you trust in him
[1:20:12] he knows you believe in him
[1:20:15] he knows you got faith that's faith that
[1:20:18] operates that's the key that turns the
[1:20:21] door and opens up the door
[1:20:25] oh my
[1:20:26] glory to god
[1:20:28] thank you jesus
[1:20:32] when you think about it
[1:20:34] there are some mysteries
[1:20:36] but there are also obvious things
[1:20:41] let me bring out a couple things here i
[1:20:42] would just want to lay in
[1:20:44] they're not deep they're not spiritual
[1:20:47] but they're common sense because i like
[1:20:48] to bring in common sense because it's
[1:20:50] not common anymore
[1:20:56] when two people are praying for the
[1:20:58] opposite thing obviously god can't
[1:20:59] answer both of you
[1:21:02] if a child is praying for snow the child
[1:21:04] got the snow today he's
[1:21:06] and they don't want to go to school
[1:21:08] and the parent is praying for clear
[1:21:10] weather so that they can go to the work
[1:21:12] obviously one is going to get answered
[1:21:16] and one is not
[1:21:18] all around america and canada the
[1:21:20] football games going on
[1:21:22] people are praying for the opposite
[1:21:24] teams
[1:21:25] you know what half of them are going to
[1:21:26] be disappointed
[1:21:31] half of them are going to hear god say
[1:21:32] yes
[1:21:34] which i i don't i don't it's not for me
[1:21:35] to judge whether god answers their
[1:21:37] prayers for football games or hockey
[1:21:39] games or that stuff i'm not going to go
[1:21:40] there you want to go there you go there
[1:21:43] i'm not going to go there
[1:21:44] but the other half is going to be like
[1:21:46] oh god said no
[1:21:48] why didn't god let my team win
[1:21:51] i'm like wow
[1:21:53] thank you
[1:21:55] but even if he did 50 would get it
[1:21:58] like i'm praying for my candidates
[1:22:01] amen when you pray for your candidates
[1:22:03] you're praying for the liberals amen i'm
[1:22:06] praying for the pc
[1:22:08] you're praying for the ppc somebody's
[1:22:10] going to win and somebody's going to
[1:22:12] lose
[1:22:14] you know what
[1:22:16] i ain't going to base my faith on
[1:22:18] whether you win the liberals or i lose
[1:22:21] the pc amen i'm not going to base my
[1:22:24] faith i'm not going to base my
[1:22:26] interpretation of god's answer on those
[1:22:28] things
[1:22:30] on the word
[1:22:32] that's where god is in the beginning was
[1:22:34] the word the word was
[1:22:36] god get back to the word
[1:22:40] that's where the bride is that's where
[1:22:42] the bride loves to be
[1:22:44] that's where she surrendered to the lord
[1:22:49] oh
[1:22:50] my then there are some prayers that we
[1:22:54] pray
[1:22:55] and if god wasn't to answer them
[1:22:57] we'd have to take
[1:22:59] he'd have to take our free will away
[1:23:01] our free choice from other people now
[1:23:03] listen my brothers and sisters if
[1:23:05] somebody came up to you and said i am
[1:23:08] praying that god forces you to marry me
[1:23:12] wow
[1:23:15] funny
[1:23:17] funny i guarantee you
[1:23:20] i guarantee you
[1:23:22] that this prayer has been prayed
[1:23:25] father give me that wife father give me
[1:23:28] that husband i claim them in the name of
[1:23:31] jesus christ
[1:23:34] whether they love me whether they are
[1:23:35] attracted to me or not
[1:23:37] i want them
[1:23:39] because you said ask and i shall receive
[1:23:42] give me the desires of my heart
[1:23:45] i want that
[1:23:48] she's prettier than the other one
[1:23:50] he's more handsome than the other one
[1:23:56] what if somebody came up to you and said
[1:23:59] i'm praying
[1:24:00] amen that you're it's going to happen
[1:24:03] because god is not going to take away
[1:24:06] our free will
[1:24:07] and that person could pray all they want
[1:24:10] god's not god's going to say no because
[1:24:13] god is not in the business of taking
[1:24:14] away our free choice he made us in his
[1:24:17] image
[1:24:18] and he's not going to overrule your
[1:24:21] choice
[1:24:23] god can force anybody think about it
[1:24:26] we're talking about god this morning but
[1:24:28] he can't force anybody to change their
[1:24:30] mind
[1:24:32] he can't force you to make the right
[1:24:34] choices in the right decisions yes he
[1:24:35] can no he can't
[1:24:36] no he can't
[1:24:40] it's judah's got to do it
[1:24:42] but let me tell you one thing
[1:24:45] by faith
[1:24:47] and only by faith
[1:24:49] the bride of jesus christ
[1:24:52] has given up her free more agency
[1:24:54] to the will of god
[1:24:58] she is surrendering it to the will of
[1:24:59] god
[1:25:00] not surrendering to this not
[1:25:02] surrendering to that what she believes
[1:25:05] her flesh the world
[1:25:06] whatever she surrendering it to the will
[1:25:09] of god
[1:25:10] lord take my free more agency away
[1:25:13] take my rights away
[1:25:15] take it all away and take control
[1:25:20] then
[1:25:21] whether it's a yes i praise your name
[1:25:23] whether it's a no i praise your name
[1:25:25] whether it's weight i bless your name
[1:25:30] sometimes
[1:25:32] god looks down
[1:25:34] and says
[1:25:35] are you crazy
[1:25:40] i hope you're not there this morning
[1:25:43] are you crazy asking me that
[1:25:46] come on saints
[1:25:49] this word is glorious
[1:25:51] this word that we've been feeding off of
[1:25:54] the double-minded man
[1:25:56] should be getting away from us
[1:26:01] in all the unstable ways
[1:26:02] amen
[1:26:04] god is not going to force you to marry
[1:26:06] somebody
[1:26:07] god can't force you to fall in love with
[1:26:09] somebody
[1:26:10] and by the way god can't force somebody
[1:26:12] to stay in love hello
[1:26:14] hello
[1:26:16] he can't force somebody to stay in love
[1:26:18] with you
[1:26:19] lord
[1:26:20] my wife my husband
[1:26:23] make them love me let make them still
[1:26:25] love me
[1:26:26] no
[1:26:27] no that's your problem
[1:26:30] that's your situation
[1:26:33] you stay in love with her
[1:26:37] you do things for her you do things for
[1:26:40] him
[1:26:41] you keep the honey in the moon
[1:26:44] god gives you the word god gives you his
[1:26:46] characteristics he shows his love to you
[1:26:48] you show it to one another
[1:26:51] not praying where you're you're acting
[1:26:52] so miserable you're treating each other
[1:26:54] so wrong
[1:26:56] misusing your words
[1:26:58] degrading
[1:26:59] his position her position
[1:27:02] trying to bring him as a as a nobody
[1:27:05] trying to make her as a dominating
[1:27:07] female and and be dominated under you
[1:27:11] god ain't doing none of those things
[1:27:13] god is his word he shows you in his word
[1:27:16] how to treat one another how to love one
[1:27:19] another
[1:27:28] so don't pray and ask for that
[1:27:30] you act upon the word you go into word
[1:27:33] and see what the word says you act upon
[1:27:35] it
[1:27:36] god will back his word up
[1:27:41] god
[1:27:45] some of you have prayed that prayer
[1:27:48] god
[1:27:49] made my spouse not leave
[1:27:51] but he left
[1:27:53] they left why
[1:27:55] why do they leave because doesn't god
[1:27:57] doesn't force anybody to do anything
[1:27:59] right
[1:28:01] he doesn't saints
[1:28:03] he doesn't force you to do anything
[1:28:05] right
[1:28:06] you make the bad choices in your life
[1:28:08] and it's yours
[1:28:10] not his
[1:28:11] can he correct it yes can he change it
[1:28:14] yes
[1:28:14] it's all in the approach of faith
[1:28:17] he doesn't force you to do anything
[1:28:19] right
[1:28:20] that he then that will make you a puppet
[1:28:23] and god doesn't have puppets
[1:28:26] i know the message has puppets
[1:28:29] i'm not going to get into it
[1:28:31] he doesn't force anybody else if you're
[1:28:34] praying god i want you to change that
[1:28:36] person's mind and make them do this well
[1:28:39] god says no
[1:28:41] i don't do that
[1:28:43] why would you would i do that to anybody
[1:28:45] else
[1:28:47] so that's a logical reason why people
[1:28:50] pray for things that actually don't
[1:28:53] happen
[1:28:54] and god says no
[1:28:58] now that can be confusing because you're
[1:29:01] going to have many knows from god in
[1:29:03] your lifetime
[1:29:04] that can be confusing it can be well
[1:29:07] if god is truly loving and if god has
[1:29:10] the power to control everything why
[1:29:13] is my request denied
[1:29:16] good question
[1:29:18] it can be confusing it can be
[1:29:20] frustrating
[1:29:21] why do some people get miracles and
[1:29:23] others don't
[1:29:25] why when we pray for people who are sick
[1:29:28] and some get well and some die
[1:29:30] that's frustrating
[1:29:32] it's hard to understand
[1:29:35] and it's not because they got greater
[1:29:37] faith than you
[1:29:38] it's not because uh you know like look
[1:29:41] at job he was criticized you're a sinner
[1:29:45] i got a miracle because i'm not a sinner
[1:29:48] you didn't get one because you're a
[1:29:49] sinner
[1:29:51] no it's not because of that
[1:29:53] it's because god has a greater plan
[1:29:56] god has a reason and a purpose behind it
[1:30:00] and you know what it's none of your
[1:30:02] business
[1:30:04] just rejoice and be thankful that you
[1:30:06] got your miracles
[1:30:07] because the next time you ask it might
[1:30:09] be no for you
[1:30:16] it's frustrating
[1:30:19] is it okay to question god
[1:30:26] question
[1:30:28] is it okay to question god
[1:30:31] my
[1:30:33] sometimes we're
[1:30:35] we're so afraid
[1:30:38] he he never
[1:30:40] projects himself that way i know to me
[1:30:42] he doesn't
[1:30:44] he doesn't project himself that to where
[1:30:46] i'm afraid of him
[1:30:47] any parent any father that their
[1:30:49] children is afraid of you
[1:30:51] there's something wrong
[1:30:53] there's a there's a demon there's a
[1:30:54] wrong spirit there
[1:30:56] children should never be able to be
[1:30:58] afraid to come to their father
[1:31:01] never
[1:31:02] never come to their father and ask them
[1:31:04] questions
[1:31:06] it's not wrong to question god
[1:31:11] now listen
[1:31:13] yes it's okay to question god because
[1:31:15] there's a difference listen between
[1:31:17] questioning god and doubting god
[1:31:21] that's where you're getting confused
[1:31:25] when we doubt
[1:31:27] we are saying i am not sure i believe
[1:31:30] if you are real or true
[1:31:34] when we question god we say i believe
[1:31:38] but i just don't understand why
[1:31:41] so question is saying i know you are
[1:31:44] real and you are true
[1:31:47] but i don't understand why you do what
[1:31:49] you do in my life
[1:31:52] and there's nothing wrong with
[1:31:53] questioning god
[1:31:55] because i don't understand all the ways
[1:31:57] amen
[1:31:58] brother brown said in the high colon
[1:32:00] you're not going to understand all the
[1:32:02] thousands of ways and he's not going to
[1:32:04] explain all the thousands of ways how he
[1:32:06] deals with you
[1:32:08] but i still got a right to come to my
[1:32:10] father and question him on certain
[1:32:12] things
[1:32:14] because i know i'm when i come out of it
[1:32:16] i know he's going to answer me when he
[1:32:17] answers me is going to clear up
[1:32:19] everything for me
[1:32:21] amen
[1:32:22] he's going to make everything clear and
[1:32:24] plain to me
[1:32:25] i'm not gonna say oh you know
[1:32:28] you know like if a child like would go
[1:32:30] back to it if a child is scared to go to
[1:32:32] the father
[1:32:33] he's gonna develop insecurities
[1:32:37] because they're afraid of the father
[1:32:39] because every child has a lot of
[1:32:41] questions
[1:32:42] that needs to be answered as they're
[1:32:44] grown up and as they're maturing
[1:32:46] and the father needs to be there to
[1:32:48] answer those questions or say you know
[1:32:50] what son or daughter later on in life
[1:32:52] you're going to understand
[1:32:54] life is going to explain things to you
[1:32:57] and the word it will
[1:32:59] explain things
[1:33:00] later on in our walk
[1:33:03] i don't want to develop any insecurities
[1:33:05] against god i want to be free in god i
[1:33:08] want to go like like that that that
[1:33:11] the king there was in a meeting and a
[1:33:13] child walked into the room
[1:33:16] anybody else their head would have been
[1:33:18] taken off but their child walked in
[1:33:21] and he stopped everything
[1:33:23] and paid attention to the child i
[1:33:25] believe that's the way god is with us
[1:33:28] amen his nose are are are because he
[1:33:32] loves us so much
[1:33:34] so
[1:33:34] much amen
[1:33:37] when we doubt we are saying i'm not sure
[1:33:39] i believe
[1:33:41] or if you're real when we question we
[1:33:43] say we believe what we just don't
[1:33:45] understand so questioning i say
[1:33:48] you're real but i don't understand
[1:33:51] if god can handle
[1:33:53] our sins
[1:33:55] don't you think he can handle our
[1:33:56] questions
[1:33:57] think about it
[1:34:01] if he can handle our disobedience
[1:34:05] if he can handle our mess
[1:34:09] when god says yes we believe
[1:34:13] and when he says no we believe
[1:34:16] you see faith believes all the time
[1:34:19] even when it's dark
[1:34:21] painful
[1:34:23] it still believes
[1:34:25] even when the pain is here or gone
[1:34:28] faith always believed nothing working
[1:34:30] everything is going to work out for our
[1:34:32] good
[1:34:34] when you're feeling bad
[1:34:37] faith believes god is good all the time
[1:34:41] amen
[1:34:44] slide nine
[1:34:46] now listen
[1:34:51] brother brown was speaking here in
[1:34:52] perfect faith
[1:34:53] i came across this quote
[1:34:58] and something a little bit different
[1:34:59] like it always does jumps out on you
[1:35:02] we've read this quote many times
[1:35:04] and per and uh
[1:35:06] let me see here
[1:35:08] about perfect faith
[1:35:11] now perfect faith is the master of all
[1:35:13] circumstances
[1:35:15] you know that's really what we're
[1:35:16] talking about this morning
[1:35:18] we're talking about perfect faith master
[1:35:20] in all our circumstances
[1:35:22] faith mastering our god's nose god's
[1:35:25] yes's maybes weights
[1:35:27] faith mastering
[1:35:29] because perfect faith is what's
[1:35:30] mastering in our life
[1:35:32] in him in the word of god
[1:35:35] it masters everything
[1:35:37] perfect faith masters all circumstances
[1:35:40] no matter what it is it masters it
[1:35:45] you see
[1:35:46] no matter what it is you're going
[1:35:47] through
[1:35:48] faith will master it my brothers and
[1:35:50] sisters
[1:35:51] faith will control it
[1:35:53] faith will bring it under subjection
[1:35:58] now just watch he says
[1:36:03] when you believe anything do anything
[1:36:06] and you've got faith in what you're
[1:36:08] doing
[1:36:09] no matter
[1:36:10] what the circumstance is
[1:36:13] that don't have one thing to do with it
[1:36:17] now that doesn't i don't see in there
[1:36:20] where god is saying
[1:36:21] you have
[1:36:22] faith in what you're doing
[1:36:26] that god is going to remove it
[1:36:28] god is going to heal you
[1:36:30] it doesn't say that there
[1:36:32] it says when you've got faith to do
[1:36:34] anything and you've got faith
[1:36:36] no matter what you're going through
[1:36:39] that faith will master it
[1:36:42] that faith will bring
[1:36:44] it under subjection to the word of god
[1:36:46] and god's plan and purpose for your life
[1:36:52] we we look at these scriptures sometimes
[1:36:54] and we don't see
[1:36:55] and i see raiden there
[1:36:57] that faith no matter what we go through
[1:37:01] what we're in
[1:37:03] the stage of our life right now the
[1:37:06] circumstances that you're in right now
[1:37:09] the situations that you're dealing with
[1:37:10] the pain the hurt the heartache
[1:37:13] whatever it is
[1:37:15] that if you've got faith your faith will
[1:37:17] master it
[1:37:19] your faith will control it instead of it
[1:37:20] controlling you
[1:37:22] bringing you into doubt bringing you
[1:37:24] into disobedience bringing you into
[1:37:26] rebellion but your faith says no
[1:37:28] it brings you under subjection it brings
[1:37:31] you unto believing
[1:37:33] god
[1:37:35] that's what perfect faith does
[1:37:37] in our lives
[1:37:40] you see it masters that circumstance no
[1:37:43] matter what it is in your life that
[1:37:45] you're going through it masters it it
[1:37:48] doesn't say anywheres to hear that
[1:37:49] you're going to be delivered from it or
[1:37:51] a miracle is going to take place or
[1:37:53] anything it might might not
[1:37:55] but one thing it says here that your
[1:37:57] faith will master it and control it not
[1:38:00] it controlling you
[1:38:03] faith believes that god will work it out
[1:38:07] no matter which way it works out whether
[1:38:11] the thorn in paul's flesh stays or goals
[1:38:14] god is going to work it out for his good
[1:38:19] amen
[1:38:21] i don't know how he's going to do it
[1:38:24] but he'll do it anyhow
[1:38:26] why because faith
[1:38:28] masters
[1:38:29] all circumstances faith masters our
[1:38:31] feelings
[1:38:33] when god says no
[1:38:36] job
[1:38:38] said though thou slay me
[1:38:41] i will trust in you
[1:38:43] faith says i trust in you lord
[1:38:46] though you slay me
[1:38:49] faith was jesus on the cross when he
[1:38:51] said my god my god why hast thou
[1:38:54] forsaken me don't tell me you haven't
[1:38:56] been there in your walk in your
[1:38:58] experience
[1:38:59] things that you have gone through
[1:39:01] attacks that you've gone through and you
[1:39:03] look up to my god my god
[1:39:06] have you forsaken me
[1:39:14] but faith
[1:39:17] when jesus
[1:39:19] came back and said
[1:39:21] not my will
[1:39:23] but yours be done
[1:39:25] there it is saints
[1:39:28] here's god and flesh
[1:39:29] my god my god going through such
[1:39:32] pain and agony
[1:39:34] despair i don't i can't even explain
[1:39:36] what he went through
[1:39:38] saying my god my god
[1:39:40] but the master of faith says not my will
[1:39:44] but thy will be done lord
[1:39:48] oh my
[1:39:50] oh my
[1:39:54] i
[1:39:55] surrender all
[1:39:58] i surrender all
[1:40:01] all to jesus
[1:40:04] i surrender
[1:40:07] i
[1:40:09] surrender all
[1:40:11] oh lord
[1:40:14] amen
[1:40:16] let's try to wind this up
[1:40:21] faith means believing all the time
[1:40:26] faith is not getting everything you pray
[1:40:28] for every time
[1:40:29] i don't take faith to believe in god if
[1:40:32] god doesn't do everything i want him to
[1:40:35] do every time
[1:40:37] and when we want god to do it
[1:40:40] in the way we want god to do it
[1:40:42] that doesn't take faith faith means when
[1:40:44] god says yes we believe when he says no
[1:40:47] we still believe
[1:40:49] faith means believing when we don't
[1:40:51] understand
[1:40:52] and when we do understand
[1:40:55] and when we don't know what god is
[1:40:57] saying we still believe
[1:41:00] faith is believing in every
[1:41:02] circumstances when the sun is out
[1:41:05] or when it's dark
[1:41:07] faith trusts in the lord
[1:41:09] faith in jesus
[1:41:11] in sin
[1:41:12] in the garden of gethsemane
[1:41:16] not my will but thy will be done romans
[1:41:18] 8 27
[1:41:21] the same god
[1:41:23] here speaking and he that searcheth
[1:41:27] the hearts knoweth what's in the mind of
[1:41:29] the spirit
[1:41:30] because he maketh intercession
[1:41:34] for the saints according to the will of
[1:41:36] god
[1:41:38] we always talk about we make
[1:41:40] intercession we got the ministry of
[1:41:42] intercession
[1:41:44] we could be a part of that ministry god
[1:41:47] can work through the misery but he
[1:41:49] is the intercessor
[1:41:51] he's the one that's interceding because
[1:41:53] only he knows
[1:42:00] the will of god for our lives
[1:42:03] we don't know all things
[1:42:05] but we know all things work together for
[1:42:07] good
[1:42:09] now sometimes god says no to our prayers
[1:42:11] to protect
[1:42:12] us from something that we can't see
[1:42:16] to guard us
[1:42:19] proverbs 2
[1:42:20] 8 god guards the course of the just and
[1:42:23] protects the ways of the faithful ones
[1:42:26] that's why he says no sometimes
[1:42:28] slide 10
[1:42:30] notice guards and protection
[1:42:33] what does it mean
[1:42:34] it doesn't mean god takes away takes you
[1:42:36] out of the trouble
[1:42:38] it doesn't mean he takes you out of the
[1:42:40] flying pan that you're in
[1:42:43] it means he leaves you in the frying pan
[1:42:47] he just keeps you from being burnt
[1:42:52] wow that's a different uh logical uh
[1:42:56] thing you know like sometimes that blows
[1:42:58] up people's brains
[1:43:00] they take scriptures
[1:43:02] like we're talking about
[1:43:04] and say no no no when i when i serve god
[1:43:07] i
[1:43:08] you know
[1:43:09] no pain
[1:43:10] you know when i serve god it's all
[1:43:12] beautiful roses and everything
[1:43:15] no
[1:43:15] sometimes god put you in the frying pan
[1:43:18] amen
[1:43:21] oh yes
[1:43:22] brother i don't want to go into fire but
[1:43:27] hallelujah
[1:43:29] now
[1:43:32] thank you lord where am i okay here we
[1:43:35] are
[1:43:36] remember the old testament daniel
[1:43:38] was not listening to the king and the
[1:43:41] king was going to throw him in to the
[1:43:43] lion's den to be eaten
[1:43:45] daniel prays
[1:43:47] god keep me out of the lions then
[1:43:50] god says no
[1:43:52] you're going in
[1:43:54] he puts him in the lion's den but what
[1:43:56] does god do he shuts the lion's mouth
[1:44:00] it becomes a bigger story a bigger
[1:44:03] testimony a bigger miracle amen and
[1:44:06] that's why god will put you in the lions
[1:44:09] then so that you come out stronger amen
[1:44:12] you come out with a testimony you come
[1:44:14] out with a victory
[1:44:17] glory to god amen remember the story of
[1:44:21] the three hebrew children
[1:44:23] who defiled the kings
[1:44:25] and and wouldn't obey the king
[1:44:28] he says you're going to go into the
[1:44:29] fiery furnace
[1:44:31] they said lord keep us out of the fiery
[1:44:33] furnace
[1:44:34] god says no
[1:44:37] let them go into the fiery furnace
[1:44:40] but
[1:44:41] i'll walk with you
[1:44:44] i'll walk with you in the furnace
[1:44:48] oh do you want to know him in the
[1:44:50] sufferings
[1:44:51] do you want to know him in the pain
[1:44:53] do you want to know him in the power of
[1:44:55] his resurrection when he resurrects you
[1:44:58] out of that situation
[1:44:59] that you're in that seems impossible
[1:45:03] oh my
[1:45:05] oh glory to god amen
[1:45:08] they were untouched
[1:45:10] they weren't burned
[1:45:12] that's our god
[1:45:13] when the every every trial
[1:45:16] everything you go through amen you're
[1:45:18] going to prosper you're going to come
[1:45:20] out better on the other end you're going
[1:45:22] to be victorious
[1:45:23] that i can say is in the word of god
[1:45:26] that you're going to overcome you're
[1:45:27] going to be an
[1:45:28] overcomer you're going to cast out every
[1:45:31] demon everything that's binding you in
[1:45:33] your life
[1:45:34] that is true
[1:45:37] god is going to deliver you yes he's
[1:45:39] going to deliver you from cancer whether
[1:45:40] he delivers you out of here or or he
[1:45:43] takes it out of your body
[1:45:50] when they came out
[1:45:52] the ropes that had them tied and bound
[1:45:56] and bound them down
[1:45:59] they were burnt off
[1:46:02] anything that binds any son and daughter
[1:46:05] of god
[1:46:06] amen god's gonna burn those ropes he's
[1:46:09] gonna break those chains he's going to
[1:46:11] open those prison doors for you
[1:46:14] just believe trust in him and walk where
[1:46:16] he's leading you
[1:46:18] follow those bloody footprints wherever
[1:46:20] they lead
[1:46:22] he knows what he's doing
[1:46:25] he knows what he's doing saints
[1:46:30] god don't let me go through the fiery
[1:46:32] trial
[1:46:35] you're going to go through it my son my
[1:46:37] daughter
[1:46:38] whether you like it or not
[1:46:40] so start liking it because not
[1:46:43] just causes too many hindrance
[1:46:46] too many delays in your walk
[1:46:49] but when you come out on the other side
[1:46:52] i'll promise you something i'll be there
[1:46:54] i'll protect you
[1:46:56] i'm going to walk right beside you
[1:46:58] and when you come out of the other side
[1:46:59] now listen to me
[1:47:02] jesus christ says you're going to be
[1:47:03] free
[1:47:05] you're going to be free from that habit
[1:47:07] you're going to be free from that person
[1:47:10] you're going to be free from that fear
[1:47:12] you're going to be free from that guilt
[1:47:14] you're going to be free from that shame
[1:47:16] you're going to be free from anything
[1:47:18] that binds you and holds you
[1:47:22] who the son of man sets free is truly
[1:47:26] free indeed in every deed in your life
[1:47:32] i know i got to flesh that sticky to the
[1:47:34] end but i god of faith that believes god
[1:47:36] beyond this flesh i don't know about you
[1:47:39] this flesh ain't gonna tie me down and
[1:47:41] all the mistakes in this flesh i got a
[1:47:43] faith that believes god is real and what
[1:47:46] he said he can do
[1:47:51] even when this thing says haha look i
[1:47:53] raise up all the time
[1:47:55] look at this habit i keep getting you
[1:47:57] you get weak and i come in my faith goes
[1:48:01] you're destroyed you're defeated
[1:48:03] hallelujah you're getting weaker every
[1:48:06] time you manifest in my body you're
[1:48:08] getting weaker
[1:48:10] you're being cast out
[1:48:12] because faith the holy ghost inside of
[1:48:15] me is pushing you out little by little
[1:48:17] i'll deliver my people i'm going to push
[1:48:19] that thing out of you
[1:48:21] oh and then god says i said oh lord lord
[1:48:24] lord help me in this area help me lord
[1:48:26] to overcome this god says okay walk with
[1:48:29] me we're going in the lions then
[1:48:31] walk with me we're going in the fiery
[1:48:33] furnace
[1:48:34] oh yes lord
[1:48:36] yes lord i trust you i believe you
[1:48:39] oh i i
[1:48:40] i don't need to understand
[1:48:42] because that just confuses me
[1:48:45] i don't need to doubt
[1:48:47] that's unbelief
[1:48:49] i just need to have faith
[1:48:51] oh my
[1:48:53] amen
[1:48:56] thank you lord
[1:49:00] the thing that has been binding you up
[1:49:02] is going to be burnt off and it wouldn't
[1:49:04] happen unless you went through the fire
[1:49:06] sometimes god says no to set you free
[1:49:10] slide 11.
[1:49:11] god says no
[1:49:13] when he has a better plan
[1:49:16] now listen isaiah 55 again let's look at
[1:49:19] these scriptures a little different this
[1:49:20] morning 55 8-9
[1:49:24] for my thoughts
[1:49:25] hello are not your thoughts
[1:49:28] neither are your ways
[1:49:30] my ways saith the lord
[1:49:33] for as the heavens are higher than the
[1:49:35] earth so are my ways god speaking here
[1:49:39] higher than your ways
[1:49:41] and my thoughts
[1:49:42] then your thoughts
[1:49:46] why that's why
[1:49:48] why no that's why
[1:49:51] why wait that's why
[1:49:53] because his ways are hired in my ways
[1:49:57] his thoughts are not my thoughts
[1:49:59] that's why
[1:50:01] settle it
[1:50:02] okay lord
[1:50:03] that's it
[1:50:05] question answered
[1:50:07] thank you lord
[1:50:08] why because god says i know the plans i
[1:50:10] have for you
[1:50:12] i know the plans i have for your life
[1:50:14] when you were in your mother's room
[1:50:17] i knew you
[1:50:19] i know what i ordained for you i know
[1:50:20] your path of life i know the beginning
[1:50:22] the end on the alpha and the on the
[1:50:23] omega
[1:50:24] i know everything that you're going to
[1:50:25] go through
[1:50:28] who are we serving
[1:50:30] who we believe in
[1:50:33] who are we surrendering to
[1:50:36] oh i all known god i know the plans i
[1:50:39] have for you i'm gonna bless you
[1:50:41] but this doesn't look like a blessing
[1:50:43] i'm gonna bless you
[1:50:45] i'm gonna prosper you this doesn't look
[1:50:47] like prosperity i'm gonna prosper you
[1:50:50] wait and see wait and see
[1:50:53] oh my
[1:50:55] hallelujah
[1:50:56] we're winding it down here i'm going to
[1:50:58] keep saying that because you're going to
[1:51:00] get a little bit boost every time i say
[1:51:01] that because hey he's going to close
[1:51:03] he's going to close whoo i got energy
[1:51:05] coming now he's going to close
[1:51:08] hallelujah
[1:51:09] amen
[1:51:11] hey we got to be smart up here you know
[1:51:13] we got to be manipulators too you know
[1:51:14] like paul you know i took off this
[1:51:16] church the stewards of that i got to be
[1:51:19] smart up here too amen shake you guys up
[1:51:21] a little bit you want to stand go ahead
[1:51:23] and stand amen amen praise the lord
[1:51:25] whatever you need to do but remember i'm
[1:51:28] i'm up here you know with a sciatic
[1:51:30] nerve i with i'm not going to get into
[1:51:32] it amen
[1:51:33] but i'm up here
[1:51:35] amen
[1:51:37] because of his grace
[1:51:40] because i love him
[1:51:42] and i'm honored
[1:51:44] i am honored timothy means honor and god
[1:51:47] i said lord
[1:51:48] i want to honor you that's all i wanted
[1:51:50] what can i do
[1:51:51] what can we do
[1:51:53] you're going to go home you're going to
[1:51:54] sit on the couch you're probably going
[1:51:55] to put on something on tv i hope you
[1:51:57] don't
[1:51:59] you're going to waste your time
[1:52:02] but you come into the house of the lord
[1:52:04] and you're like oh my when is this going
[1:52:05] to be over
[1:52:06] come on my brothers and sisters
[1:52:09] god is trying to impart eternal life to
[1:52:12] you
[1:52:13] trying to deliver you trying to set you
[1:52:15] free trying to get you into a place
[1:52:17] where faith can take a hold of you
[1:52:20] and you may see those changes that
[1:52:22] you're praying for and desiring
[1:52:24] what is better than the lord
[1:52:26] if there's anything better than the lord
[1:52:28] you need to get to this altar amen you
[1:52:30] need to pray until you break through and
[1:52:33] and and feel his presence
[1:52:35] engulf you and fill you
[1:52:38] there's nothing better than the lord i
[1:52:40] know we're in the flesh
[1:52:41] i'm going to try to hurry up
[1:52:43] amen
[1:52:45] but just have the right attitude that's
[1:52:47] all
[1:52:48] when any preacher comes up here
[1:52:50] he's up there he's up here doing it
[1:52:52] because of you
[1:52:53] that's all we can do
[1:52:56] god says no when there's a greater
[1:52:57] purpose look at the next verse second
[1:52:59] corinthians
[1:53:01] these present troubles the ones you're
[1:53:03] going through right now
[1:53:04] are quite small
[1:53:06] compared to eternity
[1:53:08] now they won't last long
[1:53:11] for the troubles you see will soon be
[1:53:13] over but the joys
[1:53:15] that are coming are eternal
[1:53:18] just think about it
[1:53:20] the bible says that these troubles that
[1:53:22] you're going through that seem so big
[1:53:24] are nothing compared
[1:53:27] i'm looking to the compared my brothers
[1:53:30] and sisters i'm not looking for the
[1:53:31] troubles here and what i'm going through
[1:53:33] here i'm looking to to compare
[1:53:36] what compares
[1:53:38] this doesn't compare to that
[1:53:40] what i'm going to get over there my
[1:53:42] treasures that are laid up in heaven
[1:53:45] the the kingdom of god amen that i'm
[1:53:47] pressing myself into every day
[1:53:50] press with violence sometimes press with
[1:53:52] blood sometimes press with striving
[1:53:55] sometimes with agony sometimes with pain
[1:53:58] sometimes
[1:53:59] but press into the kingdom of god
[1:54:02] because the kingdom has come
[1:54:06] it has come
[1:54:08] the kingdom is here amongst you now
[1:54:12] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[1:54:15] our eyes
[1:54:18] [Music]
[1:54:20] hallelujah
[1:54:23] glory to god
[1:54:28] thank you lord
[1:54:30] paul choose to delight in weakness
[1:54:36] in hardship and persecution and
[1:54:37] difficulties
[1:54:39] paul says when i'm weak then i'm strong
[1:54:42] god often says no to things
[1:54:45] we yearn to see happen
[1:54:47] those with immature faith sometimes
[1:54:49] use this excuse to abandon him
[1:54:52] altogether
[1:54:54] god didn't heal my baby
[1:54:56] god didn't save my marriage
[1:54:58] god didn't give me that job i needed
[1:55:01] our view is that god is obligated to
[1:55:04] grant our requests
[1:55:06] like a genie grants wishes
[1:55:08] when we
[1:55:10] when then then we will be dismayed
[1:55:14] when god doesn't perform for us
[1:55:17] think about it
[1:55:18] think about it
[1:55:20] that's not me that's not me i've never
[1:55:22] done that yes you have
[1:55:23] yes you have
[1:55:25] you have treated god like a genie
[1:55:26] sometimes he's got to perform this he's
[1:55:28] got to do this
[1:55:31] yes you have
[1:55:34] sorry to humble your pride
[1:55:37] we choose whether
[1:55:39] allow a no from god to shatter our faith
[1:55:42] or build it up it's your choice
[1:55:45] a no from god can teach us to in
[1:55:48] to endure
[1:55:50] and even when we don't understand
[1:55:53] james 1 3
[1:55:56] slide 13.
[1:55:58] i only got one more slide after this
[1:55:59] saints we're going down
[1:56:01] we're coming down to the end here you
[1:56:03] pray for me
[1:56:04] you pray for me
[1:56:06] hallelujah except god
[1:56:09] to give us his grace to handle his
[1:56:12] answer i expect god to give his grace
[1:56:15] that's his strength his power to handle
[1:56:18] his answer what is grace
[1:56:21] grace is god's power to handle pain
[1:56:24] god's grace grace is god's power to do
[1:56:26] the right thing anyways even when it's
[1:56:29] painful i'm going to do the right thing
[1:56:33] hallelujah why did god say to paul
[1:56:36] my grace
[1:56:38] is sufficient why didn't god say my
[1:56:40] peace
[1:56:41] my love
[1:56:42] my mercy my will
[1:56:44] is sufficient for you paul
[1:56:47] but he said paul my grace is sufficient
[1:56:50] for you
[1:56:51] grace is what god does for us
[1:56:53] without us asking anything there goes
[1:56:56] the scriptures ask and you shall receive
[1:56:59] seek and you shall find knock and it
[1:57:01] shall be opened to you
[1:57:03] grace stands alone
[1:57:05] stands by itself as an attribute of god
[1:57:09] because grace gives us something that we
[1:57:11] don't ask for grace gives us something
[1:57:14] that we don't deserve
[1:57:16] that's why he says paul my grace
[1:57:18] is sufficient for you
[1:57:21] oh my
[1:57:23] he gives us what we usually don't
[1:57:25] deserve
[1:57:26] grace gives us what we need
[1:57:29] it doesn't give us what we want
[1:57:31] if god says god says no he's given us
[1:57:34] what we need
[1:57:36] and that's what his promise said i will
[1:57:39] supply all your needs
[1:57:41] and all will work for good
[1:57:44] lord you promise your supply all my
[1:57:46] needs
[1:57:47] i need this much money i need this i
[1:57:50] need this i need this
[1:57:54] god says i did say i was going to supply
[1:57:57] all your needs
[1:57:58] but
[1:58:00] you need to know
[1:58:07] oh let's let's let's close this off soon
[1:58:10] let's let's try to i only i only got
[1:58:12] this i only got this and they're big big
[1:58:14] letters
[1:58:15] because i i got i have to do big letters
[1:58:17] and and uh my wife says how many pages
[1:58:19] you got i said i got four t's she goes
[1:58:20] what
[1:58:22] hey and i said yeah but they're big
[1:58:24] letters and i still need glasses
[1:58:27] praise god amen
[1:58:29] we're get we're getting down here saying
[1:58:31] so i just want to close this off and
[1:58:33] wrap this thought off i hope that you're
[1:58:35] seeing something clear here amen it is
[1:58:38] often in the season when god says no
[1:58:41] that we are forced to pursue god more
[1:58:43] earnestly
[1:58:45] god's nose often shatters the tiny box
[1:58:48] in which we try to put him in
[1:58:50] and allow god to reveal himself and who
[1:58:53] he is to us
[1:58:54] he says no when is a part of his greater
[1:58:57] plan his will he says no when our lack
[1:59:01] of faith indicates that we do not truly
[1:59:04] believe or trust in him
[1:59:06] and who he is hebrews 11 6 he says no
[1:59:10] when our requests are rooted in
[1:59:12] selfishness
[1:59:14] james 4 3 or or when a yes is harmful to
[1:59:19] us
[1:59:22] he says no
[1:59:23] when like paul we must learn that he is
[1:59:26] grace and sufficient for us
[1:59:28] god who experience god who experience
[1:59:31] god's know
[1:59:34] help us learn the right response
[1:59:38] when he says no to us
[1:59:42] when god says yes
[1:59:44] hallelujah
[1:59:46] musicians come
[1:59:53] i want you to say this with me
[1:59:55] i had this this vision in my mind when i
[1:59:58] when i when i wrote this down
[2:00:05] repeat after me
[2:00:07] say it with me
[2:00:08] amen
[2:00:10] we're going to say when god says yes
[2:00:13] hallelujah
[2:00:15] when he says no hallelujah when he says
[2:00:18] slow hallelujah when he says wait
[2:00:20] hallelujah amen
[2:00:23] so when god
[2:00:24] says yes what do we say
[2:00:26] hallelujah
[2:00:28] when god says no what do we say
[2:00:32] when god says wait
[2:00:34] what do we say
[2:00:36] when god says not now
[2:00:38] what do we say
[2:00:40] glory to god
[2:00:42] why because we keep growing in faith
[2:00:46] the work he has completed has to
[2:00:49] complete in us we don't know what is
[2:00:52] what's going to happen in our homes we
[2:00:55] don't know what's going to happen in our
[2:00:56] jobs with our kids with our church but
[2:01:00] we know one thing that god is in control
[2:01:04] even if it looks bad faith says it's
[2:01:06] going to work out for my good
[2:01:09] psalms 37 25 i've been young
[2:01:13] and now i am old
[2:01:16] yet i have not seen the righteous
[2:01:19] forsaken
