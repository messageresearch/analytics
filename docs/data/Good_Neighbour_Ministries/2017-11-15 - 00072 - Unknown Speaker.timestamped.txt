[0:01] the Lord Jesus Christ and company our
[0:04] pastor wrote of Hawkins ministry for
[0:06] other doctor this morning and our
[0:08] civilian where we have on early
[0:11] officially and that's where we're at we
[0:13] just bought a church there were few
[0:14] years ago but we're certainly happened
[0:15] to be here and bring ingredients of the
[0:17] whole fire back home and appreciate all
[0:20] of you but the tough next night night
[0:22] view that did we brought some fancy
[0:29] chapter 13 these are very familiar
[0:31] countries and there's several things on
[0:33] my heart that I could have but thirteen
[0:52] I'll begin reading in verse 3 if you
[0:54] would these fake many things under them
[0:57] in parables saying behold a sower went
[0:59] forth of stove when he sowed some seeds
[1:03] fell among the wayside the files came
[1:06] and devoured them up some fell upon
[1:09] stony places where they had not much
[1:11] earth and forthwith they sprung up
[1:13] because they had no deepness of earth
[1:15] and when the Sun was up they were
[1:18] scorched because they had no root they
[1:21] withered away some fell among thorns the
[1:26] thorns sprung up and choked there was I
[1:29] would have felt in the good ground would
[1:32] be there constantly
[1:33] and it brought forth fruit some a
[1:36] hundredfold some sixty and some thirty
[1:38] four they got any questions this morning
[1:42] - through the reading of his word many
[1:44] baby seed in this morning
[1:46] it is lovely me again is a privilege and
[1:49] an honor to be here this morning
[2:12] [Music]
[2:31] [Music]
[2:50] - TV so few really that was the first
[2:52] first taping that we
[2:57] [Music]
[3:14] so we're just happy to be here we've
[3:17] been met with the sugar now and it's
[3:19] wheel Michigan area there's work number
[3:24] of years and we're certainly happy to be
[3:29] and grandson was on some of the taping
[3:39] you'll see them is one of my carrying
[3:40] them honor him walking around the
[3:42] platform with him so he's coming along
[3:44] just fine
[3:54] [Music]
[3:57] [Applause]
[4:12] our family
[4:50] [Applause]
[5:03] [Music]
[5:09] so finally through prayer and a lotta
[5:11] grace of God we were able to we were
[5:13] able to bring our life together again in
[5:18] our family into the ministry it's been a
[6:18] it's been a journey it's been a
[6:19] wonderful journey and we just have
[6:21] appreciated the hand of God and the main
[6:23] thing is never make mistakes I'm gonna
[6:26] sell what we got one of the greatest
[6:42] words I think in all Christianity is a
[6:45] word called reap in another language
[6:48] they're winners what his father God
[6:51] makes a mistake he can't wait to repent
[6:54] that's been my experience yeah I made a
[6:57] lot of mistakes but there's something
[6:58] tugging at my heart my deal
[7:00] you need to make this for that your life
[7:05] the grace of not we've been able to keep
[7:08] on keepin on and so that's the that's
[7:10] the important part that it's good to see
[7:12] see you here this morning because some
[7:13] of you know in our family for many many
[7:16] many years and others may be worsening
[7:18] us for the first time so don't get
[7:20] tweaked sided is that your case because
[7:23] we're gonna leave at the service but
[7:30] we're certainly happy to be here for
[7:36] next month some of you are wanting to
[7:45] write down this date November the 21st
[7:47] because you want to send a little card
[7:52] you know I was 18 years old 18 years old
[7:56] when the Lord spoke to my heart a lot
[8:08] and I'll be honest we're raising our
[8:20] children and by the grace of God every
[8:22] one of them serving the Lord and growing
[8:24] up with God and doing doing wonders when
[8:26] I'm elected change overnight but by the
[8:28] grace of God East Campus and I said I
[8:31] knew of everything to do or better
[8:33] really like
[8:40] [Applause]
[8:43] so we're happy to be here we're happy to
[8:46] share this morning and like I said I
[8:48] just have a little flaw in my heart
[8:49] something I brought through the local
[8:51] church here some time back and I want to
[8:54] title this this morning out
[8:56] I find it to be very lengthy at all are
[8:59] you living below your privilege
[9:03] that's what I'll tight with this morning
[9:05] are you living below your privileges or
[9:08] are you living to your full potential so
[9:12] a lot of different ways to live and I'll
[9:17] be honest with you living to your full
[9:18] potential is the best so as we look at
[9:22] our scripture this morning and I want to
[9:23] start here with this city this is the
[9:26] parable that Jesus was speaking on the
[9:28] sower we're just talking about are you
[9:30] living below your privileges and the
[9:32] question is where are we at where are
[9:33] you and when it comes to living to our
[9:37] full potential
[9:41] how do you measure up this morning
[9:46] according to God's Word and according to
[9:50] this message that he brought in this age
[9:53] and after all the years that we would
[9:56] serve a given living for him to you
[9:58] especially that offended this is simply
[10:00] brother Tom's been around here a long
[10:02] time in this area some of you may have
[10:04] started with him I don't know something
[10:06] to then maybe something beginning in
[10:07] here some maybe five years or 10 years
[10:09] or 15 years I don't know but the thing
[10:11] the question is this morning hi how are
[10:14] you doing I'm Gus were how are you doing
[10:19] if I could say like this God's spiritual
[10:24] measuring stick because really that's
[10:28] important it's important how you live
[10:32] your life it's important where you're at
[10:33] spiritually
[10:34] it's important if you're going to do
[10:36] something for God that you're living for
[10:38] him to your full potential so I will
[10:44] just talk of these things in just for
[10:47] you this morning I think I think without
[10:49] any doubt in my heart I think we should
[10:51] all be living to our fullest potential
[10:52] [Music]
[10:58] futures I'm determined in the spring so
[11:01] I'm not the brush Harbor fireball that I
[11:05] used to be so won't you be disappointed
[11:09] with this is over those are wonderful
[11:12] days and I'd love to ever been in I used
[11:15] to preach so hard that look we dripping
[11:17] down my throat but I got
[11:26] [Music]
[11:30] slow down but I just love the Lord just
[11:34] as much as I always have
[11:35] so let's just look at this today what
[11:37] you turbo's me if you would the mark
[11:38] chapter 10 and I don't have this on the
[11:41] overhead to give you as much but we just
[11:43] take our time and look at it mark the
[11:45] tenth chapter and I'm going to begin
[11:47] reading at verse 28 I'll give you a
[11:50] moment to turn to it but mark 10 verse
[11:52] verse 28 says this Peter began to say
[11:55] unto Him lo we have left all and follow
[12:00] the United referred here is open mouth
[12:06] insert foot Peter Peter was always
[12:11] getting himself in trouble with the Lord
[12:13] so they tempted visas Bowl staples he
[12:16] said we heard fibbing he says he begin
[12:19] to say we have left all this Peter now
[12:22] we have been Paul and have followed thee
[12:28] so Jesus comes back with this answer
[12:31] nothing is profound and he just gotta
[12:35] sex Peter's thought and he said this is
[12:39] the person who has left off and here's
[12:42] Jesus answer verse 29 and jesus answered
[12:45] and said to me apparently I've seen to
[12:47] you there is no man that hath left house
[12:50] and brother or sisters or father or
[12:53] mother or wife or children or lands for
[12:56] my sake in the gospel but he shall
[12:59] receive a hundredfold in this time
[13:07] now Peter how do you feel about your
[13:10] statement wife and children and lands
[13:19] anyone done that has a hundredfold life
[13:23] right now I know what I love that that's
[13:31] my goal in life is to be able to serve
[13:33] him to my 50 fullest potential and
[13:36] that's exactly what I want with each
[13:38] other see force pretty a hundredfold in
[13:40] this time
[13:41] Hopson brothers and sisters and mothers
[13:43] and children and lands relative inside
[13:45] why'd he stop there because you only
[13:52] have one so when you stop there in
[13:55] addition to the EEG at this time it
[13:58] selected brothers sisters children the
[14:01] blades and the mothers of all what a
[14:02] wonderful time you're going to have
[14:04] that's our goal and I think we should
[14:06] all be striving for that hundred full
[14:11] life I think I'm gonna be her god desire
[14:14] I think that would be our goal in life
[14:17] because you see a total commitment reach
[14:23] a total reward
[14:26] [Music]
[14:27] you know there's a lot of people that
[14:29] want what grandpa and grandma hand they
[14:33] want that whole time to experience and a
[14:35] month ago plant power of God but they
[14:37] don't want to live like the old people
[14:38] use no they they don't want that upper
[14:41] room experience and I want that Patsy's
[14:43] among some buddy we're done deserve you
[14:47] are right here you're not all so he's
[15:13] saying here it takes a total commitment
[15:19] kind of like the story that I know
[15:22] you've heard of the of the chicken of
[15:24] the pig that were having a great
[15:26] conversation is the chicken say hey I'll
[15:27] tell you what let's do breakfast in the
[15:29] morning you bring the bacon out radiates
[15:32] a little check a wonderful time thinking
[15:36] about
[15:42] [Music]
[15:44] take a look at that check the set for
[15:46] you it's just a mere confirmation
[16:02] well that's what takes so the question
[16:06] is this morning as we did we look at
[16:07] this for a few minute is our living to
[16:10] our fullest potential are living below
[16:15] our privileges the profit of message
[16:19] colors evil skirts are necessary here's
[16:23] the worst sight that Matthews hockey
[16:24] club who's talking about the Eagle that
[16:26] he saw him that the eCos he saw in the
[16:28] zoo I think was it's an anchor somewhere
[16:30] revisited these all things evil they
[16:32] softly caged up and there's places we
[17:24] personally
[17:30] people that are out there to take this
[17:32] very day singing and play their
[17:35] instruments in that clubs a bar and cut
[17:39] their teeth on but it takes a personal
[17:54] commitment it takes somebody that's
[17:57] willing to surrender their hearts and
[18:02] their lives to God
[18:04] in a message coheeries and in Saskatoon
[18:07] he said this is it circle the ministers
[18:09] we should be ashamed of ourselves as we
[18:13] keep our congregations way below their
[18:15] procedures I've seen it done I've seen
[18:21] the old song come down so the pastors
[18:23] and churches work they just keep their
[18:25] people now and I'm allowed to soar like
[18:27] the Eagles they don't allow them to live
[18:30] above the world they want to keep their
[18:34] control he said this I think this is
[18:44] profound he said the whole Christian
[18:46] church today is believing thousands of
[18:49] miles below their god-given proof
[18:58] we need to claim every promise of God
[19:01] can you say man and when you can claim
[19:05] your problems about not all second
[19:08] certainty that we're living the
[19:09] thousands of the house before but it
[19:11] does me and I thought one thing for sure
[19:13] how about me living to my fullest
[19:16] potential in Christ you see too many
[19:24] holes but there's two in there fall by
[19:32] the wayside and I would like to see and
[19:39] I would think there's a congregation you
[19:41] would like to see I would think it's a
[19:44] congregation you should want to be
[19:45] living to your souls so let's take a
[19:53] look at the Word of God as we look at
[19:54] here just a little bit and in our text
[19:56] in Matthew chapter 13 Jesus said some
[20:00] seeds fell to the ground we would eat
[20:02] that top right
[20:05] I told people you've probably heard me
[20:09] say maybe what however long has been
[20:11] almost 20 years I think what John said
[20:13] but I've ever seen I've said it many
[20:16] times
[20:16] you're nothing but dirt though if you
[20:18] get here I minded you're made up of the
[20:20] 16 elements of the years you're probably
[20:22] number two dollars living in us we
[20:49] believe they didn't decide then he's
[20:52] sitting there with something would bring
[20:53] for 30 some 60 100 fold and when you
[20:56] look at your life this morning the store
[20:58] I want us to do to do a little self
[21:01] inspection this morning when you look at
[21:03] your life this morning which would you
[21:06] say you're producing there's the venturi
[21:11] now mind you they're all believers I'm
[21:16] not talking about all the neighbors 30
[21:21] 60 and hundredfold somewhere in that
[21:23] scale you are as I am and I want you
[21:27] there self examine what you turn there's
[21:29] on to this money inside of you it just
[21:31] half your cell
[21:32] would you want Lord we're quite sure
[21:33] where am i living in is my life
[21:37] producing 34 still reliever 60-vote stay
[21:41] with a beaver why am i living to my
[21:42] fullest potential and I praise the Lord
[21:52] for a family so let's just take a good
[22:00] look at many times the disciples didn't
[22:03] understand Jesus when he spoke to them
[22:06] in parallel and this was one of those
[22:10] times and they ask you in 13 words
[22:15] you're staying in that chapter for a
[22:16] while yes universe did they say
[22:19] disciples said to him once
[22:23] because now unto them in parables
[22:28] [Music]
[22:31] explain what you mean parables are
[22:36] slower good for them some see you hear
[22:38] something they're at something why do
[22:41] you do that this silences his file or
[22:44] attested in the insert in verse 11 if
[22:48] you said that there because it's given
[22:50] unto you to know miss
[23:02] because it's for members only so let's
[23:43] take a look at those pictures to see
[23:45] what he said this morning forgive me
[23:48] good eye throats messed up my brother
[23:52] used to be around
[24:17] you
[25:06] it's not given to them he wants you to
[25:11] understand his work he wants you to know
[25:15] what he's talking about he wants you to
[25:18] know who you are you want you to know
[25:20] where you are that's what we're talking
[25:22] about this where ever you haven't the
[25:25] scale that we're talking about this
[25:27] morning you drop down to verse 18 and he
[25:30] starts explaining the parable now that
[25:31] we just talked about he said here you
[25:35] hear for the terrible when any one
[25:40] heareth the word of the kingdom and
[25:42] understandeth it not then cometh the
[25:46] wicked one and catcheth away that which
[25:48] is sown in his heart this is he which
[25:51] received seed by the way side so we
[25:57] can't I want to say this is just total
[25:59] unbelievers but it pretty closely is
[26:02] because they have no clue and though
[26:05] inside I said in first Corinthians 214
[26:11] the natural man receiveth not the things
[26:14] of God because they are spiritually
[26:15] discerned
[26:18] you've got to have you've got to have a
[26:20] cold man to break the quote of this book
[26:22] a time the tiny otherwise you read it in
[26:26] the beats nothing
[26:27] you won't get the coke and break it down
[26:49] to you without that you're just like the
[26:52] man that has a seat that comes and has
[26:54] no understanding of them and they get
[26:57] stolen away first I said this clinics
[27:00] one but he they're free this see into
[27:03] the stony places the same is he that
[27:06] heareth the word and anima joy receiveth
[27:10] it this is both enjoy either call them
[27:14] enjoy because the years and receive it
[27:24] [Music]
[27:32] [Music]
[27:38] [Music]
[27:51] [Music]
[27:56] shouting others
[28:11] [Music]
[28:23] [Music]
[28:31] [Applause]
[28:32] [Music]
[29:07] because you know about protection when
[29:36] you first come into the house
[29:38] in protection you don't sell the
[29:40] problems in the church off the shoulder
[30:20] these there are 22 you have that
[30:25] rootedness company dearth for a while
[30:27] encryption and persecution arises

[31:13] deceitfulness of riches choke the word

[31:21] become a country he gets so caught up
