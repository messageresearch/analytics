[27:45] Lord, it's an honor to be back in your
[27:48] house tonight, oh God. Yes, Lord. We're
[27:50] so thankful, oh Lord Lord, that you've
[27:52] given us strength and the grace to make
[27:55] it in, Lord.
[27:57] Lord, we are here to show whose side we
[28:00] are on. And that is on the side of
[28:02] Jesus.
[28:04] Lord, we pray that you would move in a
[28:07] simple but mighty way, Lord God, and
[28:10] just bless your children who've
[28:12] sacrificed the time, your strength, the
[28:15] efforts, Lord, to be here tonight.
[28:18] Lord, I just yield myself to you that
[28:20] you would take this vessel of clay,
[28:22] Lord, and speak to your children, Lord.
[28:26] None of us, Lord, are worthy, but you
[28:29] alone, Lord Jesus. You are the worthy
[28:31] one. And so, Lord, we look to you. May
[28:33] you just meet every need and bless every
[28:36] heart, Lord, I pray. Bless the word in
[28:39] the precious name of the Lord Jesus
[28:40] Christ. Amen.
[28:43] Amen. Thank you, musicians. May the Lord
[28:46] bless you richly. just have your seats
[28:48] for a minute or so.
[28:51] I just uh would like to unwind myself a
[28:56] little bit. I'm a bit nervous tonight.
[28:59] I was just telling Pastor Danny, you
[29:02] know, it's not easy to fill the shoes
[29:05] after this weekend. Um as you all know,
[29:08] we had a mighty mighty weekend and God
[29:12] moved among us. He blessed us richly and
[29:16] so you know to come behind those
[29:18] powerful preachers is not easy. I just
[29:21] count myself a spare tire but uh we are
[29:26] here to look to Christ.
[29:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. But before we proceed, I just want
[29:32] to take a few moments to pay tribute to
[29:36] our pastor.
[29:38] You know on Sunday hearing him thanking
[29:41] everyone. This is just me. I just felt
[29:44] to my heart just to take a few moments
[29:48] to appreciate our pastor.
[29:51] Before you clap your hands, thank you.
[29:54] Just hold it for a moment. We will do it
[29:55] together. But um you know I got some
[29:59] testimonies that came back of just
[30:02] seeing what they saw him do out there
[30:07] helping out making everybody feel
[30:10] comfortable just being involved.
[30:13] And to me those are qualities of a true
[30:16] shepherd.
[30:18] So Pastor Danny I just want to
[30:21] appreciate you for being an example of a
[30:24] true servant of God.
[30:27] uh by leadership.
[30:29] You know Jesus said that he that is the
[30:31] greatest among you
[30:34] shall be your servant. Is that right?
[30:38] &gt;&gt; If you want to be great, learn to become
[30:40] a servant. Be humble. That's when God
[30:44] will use you.
[30:47] So I want to read this quote uh from
[30:51] brother Brham
[30:53] because some people have problems when
[30:55] you thank a man but we're going to find
[30:59] out what brother Brham thought about
[31:01] those things. So I'm going to read this
[31:04] quote from the message the Pomian church
[31:06] age 1960.
[31:09] It says, "And in this our pastor here,
[31:13] of course, he was referring to brother
[31:15] Neville, but I'm going to direct to
[31:17] pastor Danny.
[31:19] I haven't got a chance to say very much
[31:22] about him, but I want to I want you all
[31:26] try to meet our pastor.
[31:28] He's certainly a real brother in Christ.
[31:32] We are happy to have a brother uh
[31:35] brought up in a Methodist background
[31:37] with holiness." Of course, he's talking
[31:39] about Pastor Neville. And we all know
[31:42] Oman Neville. Everybody around here
[31:44] does. There's nobody puts a finger on
[31:48] his life.
[31:50] He don't like for me to say that, but
[31:52] yet I'd rather give him a little bitty
[31:55] rose bud now
[31:59] than a whole wreath after he's gone.
[32:03] And now this is the time.
[32:08] One night I was going out of the church
[32:11] and someone said, "Oh, brother Brham, I
[32:15] sure appreciated that sermon."
[32:19] And I said, "Thank you."
[32:22] And so somebody standing at the door, a
[32:25] minister
[32:28] said, "Well, bless God. I don't want
[32:32] nobody telling me that.
[32:36] See said I want all the glory to go to
[32:39] God.
[32:42] I said, "Well, it does." See? And I
[32:47] said, "Well, I like it myself." This is
[32:51] brother Brennham now.
[32:54] I said, "I really like it."
[32:59] And I said, "I have to be truthful."
[33:04] And he said, "Well, I don't like for
[33:07] people to say that about me. Bless God."
[33:12] I said, "There's just one difference
[33:15] between me and you.
[33:19] I'm honest about it and you're not."
[33:23] Is that right? So, I just want us
[33:25] together to give a hand to our pastor
[33:29] [Applause]
[33:34] I'm fully aware that the audience is not
[33:37] here. The crowd is gone, but Jesus is
[33:40] here.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; And Jesus is everything. So, Pastor
[33:44] Danny, we appreciate you. We thank you
[33:46] so much for being an example and the
[33:49] lives that you're touching, what people
[33:52] see. I truly want to appreciate you for
[33:54] that. Amen.
[33:57] So with that said, let's stand to our
[33:59] feet.
[34:03] We are going to be quick tonight. Very
[34:05] simple message.
[34:08] And um I just want to speak on a simple
[34:12] thought.
[34:14] Judge not.
[34:16] Judge not. So we're going to read two
[34:20] scriptures. I got my inspiration
[34:22] actually from uh brother Dig's sermon on
[34:25] Saturday night when he preached on it's
[34:27] a season for change.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; So that's where I got my inspiration
[34:31] from. So Matthew chapter 7 verse 1 and
[34:34] 2.
[34:44] Amen. Verse one, it says, "Judge not
[34:50] that ye be not judged.
[34:53] For with what judgment ye judge, ye
[34:57] shall be judged,
[34:59] and with what measure ye meet, it shall
[35:02] be measured to you again." Romans
[35:06] chapter 2 verse 1 to4.
[35:10] Romans chapter 2 verse 1 to4.
[35:14] Amen.
[35:16] Therefore, thou art inexcusable,
[35:19] all men, whosoever thou art, that
[35:23] judgest, for wherein thou judgeest
[35:26] another,
[35:28] thou condemnst thyself.
[35:31] For thou that judgest doest this, sorry,
[35:35] for thou that judgest doest the same
[35:38] things.
[35:39] But we are sure
[35:42] that the judgment of God is according to
[35:45] truth against them which commit such
[35:48] things.
[35:50] And thinkst thou this, oh men, that
[35:54] judge them which do such things, and
[35:57] doest the same,
[35:59] that thou shalt escape the judgment of
[36:02] God,
[36:04] or despisest thou the riches of his
[36:07] goodness and forbearance
[36:10] and longsuffering,
[36:13] not knowing that the goodness of God
[36:16] leadth to repentance. May the Lord bless
[36:19] the word. You can have your seats.
[36:22] Amen.
[36:28] How many were blessed on the weekend?
[36:31] &gt;&gt; And I trust that you're still feeding on
[36:33] the anointing just how God came down to
[36:38] encourage us all. And I trust that with
[36:40] what was said, it will give us energy to
[36:43] keep fighting the good fight of faith.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I just want to go into this
[36:48] subject. Judge not. And uh before we get
[36:51] started, I want to uh show the
[36:55] difference between these two words,
[36:58] judging versus judgment.
[37:01] You know, we live in a world where it's
[37:04] very difficult to correct people or even
[37:07] to try and give some advice without
[37:09] people saying, "Well, you're being
[37:10] judgmental."
[37:12] &gt;&gt; You hear that a lot. you know,
[37:14] somebody's doing something wrong and in
[37:16] good faith you try to maybe say
[37:18] something and most times you get the
[37:21] response, oh, you're being judgmental.
[37:24] But um I just want to look at the
[37:27] difference between these two words,
[37:28] judging versus judgment. Amen. So in
[37:33] terms of the biblical definition of
[37:35] judging, it means the forbidden act
[37:40] of hypocritical condemnation
[37:43] and the formation of negative opinions
[37:48] without full knowledge
[37:51] or the necessary act of righteous
[37:54] discernment to evaluate actions as good
[37:59] or evil.
[38:02] Right? So that's the definition of
[38:04] judging. Now when it comes to judgment
[38:07] of again this is in the bib biblical
[38:10] context it means God's righteous
[38:14] assessment of actions,
[38:17] thoughts
[38:19] and intentions
[38:22] which leads to a decision about an
[38:25] individual's destiny.
[38:28] So for example, Jesus said in Matthew
[38:31] 23:23,
[38:32] he said, "Woe unto you scribes
[38:36] and Pharisees,
[38:38] hypocrites, for ye pay tithe of mint and
[38:46] common, and have omitted the weightier
[38:50] matters
[38:51] of the law." And then he goes to list
[38:54] them out.
[38:55] judgments,
[38:58] mercy,
[38:59] and faith.
[39:01] These ought ye to have done, and not to
[39:05] leave the other undone.
[39:09] So, righteous judgment
[39:12] according to the way God interprets it
[39:15] or the way he sees it is really based
[39:18] on, you know, the fruit that a tree
[39:22] bears.
[39:25] uh and not necessarily the seed.
[39:28] You know, brother Diggs demonstrated
[39:30] when he showed that seed here and as we
[39:34] all know, well, by now we know that it
[39:37] was a peach seed. I believe that. Right
[39:39] now, if you take that same seed and you
[39:43] are to compare it to, let's say, an
[39:45] apricot,
[39:47] chances are you will not know the
[39:49] difference. Is that right?
[39:52] So
[39:54] a a lot can go wrong when you judge
[39:57] something when it's still in seed form.
[40:03] And there's also a high probability of
[40:06] mistaken identity.
[40:10] You can easily come to the wrong
[40:12] conclusions about something.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; Yes. And I believe that every one of us
[40:18] here seated here tonight or even online
[40:23] at some point in our walk with the Lord,
[40:26] we have been like those seeds or the
[40:28] seed which was we saw here on Saturday.
[40:32] And until that seed is goes through the
[40:34] process of rotting and dying and being
[40:38] planted and eventually bringing forth
[40:42] fruit. you really can't tell what it is.
[40:47] So the basis of my sermon tonight is to
[40:50] avoid judging
[40:53] the seed
[40:55] when it's still in that form.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Because we if we're not careful, we can
[41:00] pass the wrong judgments.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Right?
[41:03] &gt;&gt; The outside might not look good. We may
[41:06] not like the way it appears. But until
[41:08] that seed has gone through a process,
[41:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; And eventually bring forth fruit.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; Then like Jesus said, by their fruits
[41:21] &gt;&gt; you will know them.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; Not the seed.
[41:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Many of us,
[41:30] I can guarantee the seed never looked
[41:33] good from the beginning.
[41:37] We were corrupt,
[41:39] evil,
[41:48] and had not been for the grace of God,
[41:53] many of us would not be sitting here.
[41:59] So this is the approach that God takes.
[42:03] God has permitted every one of us, like
[42:05] I said a few moments ago, we are allowed
[42:09] to be fruit inspectors,
[42:14] not judge judgmental of the seed, but to
[42:18] judge the fruit. And what do I mean by
[42:21] that? You go to the grocery store, let's
[42:24] say you want an apple or or whatever
[42:26] fruits you go through. You don't just
[42:28] grab any fruit and stuff it in your bag,
[42:31] do you? You take your time. You turn it
[42:35] around and you flip it. You make sure
[42:37] there's there's nothing wrong with it.
[42:41] Is that right? No blemishes because you
[42:44] want the best.
[42:48] And so we go through that in the natural
[42:51] to make sure that what we are, you know,
[42:55] going to buy is something that is
[42:56] pleasant because you're going to eat
[42:58] that fruit.
[43:00] So that's why, like I said, Jesus said,
[43:02] "By their fruits, you shall know them."
[43:07] So how many of us, you know, looked like
[43:11] bad seeds
[43:14] before we came to Christ?
[43:17] We've heard testimonies like our dear
[43:19] pastor at one point he was a drug
[43:22] addict.
[43:24] Maybe fornicators, adulterers,
[43:28] thieves, crooks, mean, rebellious,
[43:31] mean-spirited.
[43:34] I'm sure every one of us can identify
[43:36] that at some point in in in our lives,
[43:40] we were not acceptable.
[43:45] Praise God.
[43:47] But beneath all of that, I thank God
[43:51] that there is representation
[43:53] that God placed in inside that horrible
[43:57] looking seed waiting for the appointed
[44:00] time when the sunlight of the gospel.
[44:04] The word that came
[44:06] &gt;&gt; for the appointed time and called out
[44:09] our names.
[44:11] Amen. and the Holy Spirit being sent to
[44:15] quicken that seed. It has brought us to
[44:18] life.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; So we are sitting here by the grace of
[44:21] God.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why I don't believe in
[44:25] passing judgments to anybody
[44:28] because we are still on a journey. Is
[44:31] that right?
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Some of us are going through
[44:33] sanctification
[44:35] being cleaned up from bad habits.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[44:39] &gt;&gt; We've got to extend grace to one
[44:41] another.
[44:43] sanctification.
[44:45] You're going through that process.
[44:47] Extend grace to to the person.
[44:50] We all make mistakes.
[44:53] We do wrong things. We fall down. Like
[44:56] the Bible says, a righteous man fallth
[44:58] how many times?
[45:00] Not once.
[45:03] But just to give context, seven times.
[45:06] But what happens?
[45:08] He rises up. So God is showing us that
[45:12] there is grace that needs to be
[45:13] extended.
[45:15] Amen.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; You know to you parents uh who have
[45:20] raised kids and maybe potential parents,
[45:24] you will soon realize that once you are
[45:27] in charge of that human being,
[45:31] you've got to have a lot of grace.
[45:35] You know, maybe before you were married,
[45:37] you you had ideas of how you're going to
[45:39] raise your kids, you know, with specific
[45:42] rules and different guidelines. All
[45:46] these are things that we form in our
[45:48] minds, you know, of how we're going to
[45:51] have the perfect family, the perfect
[45:54] kids. Everybody wants the perfect kids.
[45:57] But I've got news for you. You don't
[45:59] decide how those kids come.
[46:06] So as a parent, you realize that as your
[46:10] kids are growing,
[46:12] you've got to adjust.
[46:15] You know, one may be different from this
[46:17] one. And the way you treat or handle
[46:19] this one is different from this one.
[46:23] You know, there are no onesizefits all.
[46:28] And you find that it's the same thing
[46:30] with God.
[46:32] He deals with each and every one of us
[46:34] according to the measure of faith and
[46:37] grace that has been given to us.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm so thankful to have a
[46:43] father like that
[46:44] &gt;&gt; that in spite of my mistakes, in spite
[46:47] of our mistakes, there is grace
[46:50] &gt;&gt; to help us along the way.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[46:54] So, Brother Brham, I want to read this
[46:57] quote. Like I said, I won't be long
[46:59] tonight, but just to encourage us along
[47:03] our uh our walk with the Lord. He says
[47:07] in this message, Hebrews chapter 7,
[47:10] preached 19:57.
[47:12] He says, "Esau
[47:14] was twice the gentleman of Jacob." Now,
[47:18] we all know the story of these two boys.
[47:21] Is that right?
[47:22] If we had to judge him today
[47:26] to be a member of our church, you would
[47:30] take Esau a thousand to one.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; Now think of that.
[47:37] Brother Brham is saying that if you and
[47:40] I had to judge between these two boys,
[47:43] Esau and Jacob,
[47:45] &gt;&gt; we would pick Esau.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[47:50] If you didn't know him, but God took
[47:55] Jacob. Hallelujah.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; What would you do with St. Paul? That's
[48:01] another example.
[48:04] If he want to be a minister, a little
[48:07] old hook nose hooknosed Jew and his
[48:11] mouth setting sideways
[48:14] going along just forcing and he was
[48:17] going to tear out the church. He's going
[48:19] to do everything. You would have thought
[48:22] he committed the unpardonable sin. But
[48:25] God said he is my servant. Amen.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; So do you see how we cannot judge
[48:31] anything by looks, by impression?
[48:35] Amen.
[48:37] God takes men and makes them different.
[48:42] Not men taking God and becoming
[48:46] different. Pay attention to that.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; Right?
[48:48] &gt;&gt; God takes men and makes them different.
[48:53] But not man taking God and becoming
[48:57] different.
[49:00] It's not what you do,
[49:04] &gt;&gt; what you will, what you think. It's what
[49:08] God does.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; There you are.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; And that's the story. Hallelujah.
[49:16] So Jacob, let's take him as an example.
[49:19] We all know the story of Jacob. He was a
[49:21] crook.
[49:25] a deceiver.
[49:29] But you know, one day he met God.
[49:34] In Genesis chapter 32, Jacob came to a
[49:38] point in his life where he realized he
[49:40] needed to have a conference with God.
[49:44] Amen. And there's an appointed time for
[49:47] everything. Here was Jacob. He was in
[49:50] bad terms with his brother Esau because
[49:53] Esau
[49:55] had been cheated the birthright
[49:58] and he had purposed to kill him. That's
[50:01] according to the scriptures.
[50:03] So Rebecca, Jacob's uh mother told him,
[50:06] Jacob,
[50:07] your life is at stake. Run and go and
[50:11] live with your uncle Laban.
[50:14] And so that's what he did.
[50:17] But you see,
[50:21] no matter how far you run,
[50:24] if you don't deal with certain issues,
[50:28] your past will always catch up with you.
[50:33] I won't go into all the details, but you
[50:36] see now here was Jacob. He has gone
[50:38] through this whole cycle and he has
[50:40] stayed with his uncle Laban.
[50:43] and things went bad in in in that
[50:45] relationship.
[50:47] Now he had to run away. And it was in
[50:50] that process while he was in that
[50:53] process now
[50:55] with this uncle's in bad terms. His
[50:58] brother is in bad terms. Now what does
[51:01] he do?
[51:03] And I thank God that he's such a God
[51:06] that he will bring many of us to a place
[51:10] where we have no choice but to look up
[51:13] to him. And so when Jacob finally
[51:17] met God,
[51:20] there's one thing I want to bring out
[51:22] that is I believe is a highlight. You
[51:25] know the story of how he wrestled with
[51:26] the Lord.
[51:28] But in the moment, in that moment of
[51:32] wrestling with the angel of the Lord,
[51:36] God asked him a question and he said,
[51:38] "What is your name?"
[51:43] Now, honestly, don't you think God knows
[51:45] our names?
[51:47] He knows every one of us. He knows me.
[51:49] He knows every one of us.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; But God asked him, says, "Jacob, what is
[51:55] your name?" And eventually Jacob,
[51:59] he answered. He says, "I am Jacob." What
[52:02] God was looking for was for a
[52:04] confession.
[52:06] Confess who you are.
[52:10] Amen.
[52:12] We cannot come to God and think that God
[52:15] will just overlook things. That's why
[52:18] the Bible says, "Repent and be baptized
[52:22] in the name of Jesus Christ." We saw it
[52:25] happening here. at the past. I enjoy the
[52:27] way the process you went through asking
[52:30] specific questions. Do you denounce
[52:34] your past? Do you denounce your sins?
[52:37] You must confess and say, "God, I am a
[52:40] sinner.
[52:42] I am wretched. I am undone."
[52:45] God wants us to confess. And finally,
[52:48] when Jacob confessed who he was,
[52:53] God says, "All right, it's time to
[52:55] change your name." And from that moment,
[52:58] we know that Jacob walked a different
[53:01] walk.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; And at from that moment, all the fear
[53:08] that Jacob had of his brother uh Esau, I
[53:12] guess, Esau, it was gone. He finally had
[53:16] the courage to face his past
[53:21] and God in his goodness intervened and
[53:24] you can see the relationship. By the
[53:26] time Jacob came to meet with his brother
[53:28] Esau, it wasn't a time of war but of
[53:32] reconciliation,
[53:34] hugs, restoration of family,
[53:38] forgiveness.
[53:40] God can do things in your life, in my
[53:43] life that we least expect.
[53:47] The the only thing God wants from us is
[53:49] to come his provided way.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So
[53:55] to me that was such a beautiful
[53:59] example
[54:01] of uh you know how God can take a man
[54:04] who looks horrible on the outside but
[54:08] inside him there was something special.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So the seed might not look
[54:15] good on the outside
[54:17] but don't worry.
[54:19] Amen. God knows how to find his own. It
[54:25] could be your husband. It could be your
[54:28] wife.
[54:30] Exercise patience and longsuffering. It
[54:33] could be your children. Exercise
[54:36] patience and longsuffering.
[54:39] Continue to display the token. Like the
[54:41] prophet said, always display that token.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:48] because it's the token life that wins
[54:52] the wayward.
[54:53] Praise God. It's not how much we put
[54:56] rules down and try to restrict people
[54:58] with this and that. Those things have
[55:00] their place. But I'll tell you this,
[55:03] when that token is on display. I'm
[55:06] telling you, it has the greatest impact
[55:09] better than any words that I could speak
[55:11] or any man could speak. Let that token
[55:14] life be on display and watch and see
[55:16] what happens. Praise God. So don't feel
[55:19] discouraged
[55:22] when you've done your very best and it
[55:24] looks like nothing is working. Don't be
[55:26] discouraged. Hallelujah. Like we sing
[55:29] that song,
[55:31] take it to the Lord in prayer.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe your husband is not
[55:38] behaving at his best. Just take it to
[55:40] the Lord in prayer. It could be your
[55:43] children. take you to the Lord in prayer
[55:46] because we have a friend who sticks
[55:49] closer than a brother.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; So to be like Job who stood in a gap for
[55:57] his family, this is what Job said. I
[55:59] like this. The Bible said, "And he
[56:02] sanctified them
[56:04] and rose up early in the morning and
[56:08] offered burnt offering according to the
[56:11] number of them all. For Job said, "It
[56:16] may be that my sons have sinned and
[56:20] cursed God in their hearts." Thus did
[56:24] Job continually.
[56:26] It wasn't a one-time thing.
[56:29] It might look like nothing is happening
[56:31] today. Try tomorrow. It doesn't happen
[56:34] this week, next week, this month, next
[56:38] month, maybe not this year, next year.
[56:42] Continually apply that token.
[56:44] Eventually, it's going to stick.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So remain steadfast because
[56:50] I believe that God is still on the
[56:52] throne and his grace is sufficient for
[56:55] every one of us.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[56:58] So do you all agree that every one of us
[57:03] we have looked like bad seeds on the
[57:06] outside
[57:08] whether it's the preacher
[57:10] who's preaching the gospel at one point
[57:12] the grace of God had to reach down to
[57:14] him or the one sitting on the pew just
[57:17] because somebody came yesterday
[57:20] it does not mean that we should look
[57:23] down upon them do you know let me say
[57:25] this
[57:27] I'm just getting ahead of myself, but
[57:29] Paul said this. I I just want to read
[57:31] that real quick because it's fitting for
[57:35] what I want to say here.
[57:38] Paul says this, "We then that are strong
[57:44] ought to bear the infirmities
[57:46] of the weak
[57:49] and not to please ourselves."
[57:52] So
[57:54] according to the scripture, God
[57:56] purposely allows people in our midst,
[57:59] weak ones,
[58:01] in order for others to bear the
[58:03] infirmities of those who are weak.
[58:07] It's not for us to go and gossip
[58:11] and talk about this one and that one. We
[58:14] are called to be intercessors.
[58:17] You see a brother going through
[58:19] something, don't pick up the phone and
[58:21] say, "Did you see what he did or what
[58:25] she did?" Well, I don't see him. I don't
[58:27] see her. What about going in your
[58:30] closet?
[58:33] Just you and God.
[58:35] And call upon the Lord. Say, "Lord, my
[58:39] brother, my sister seems to be going
[58:41] through a situation. I'm coming to stand
[58:43] in the gap for them."
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Our young people, we are living in a
[58:49] terrible age.
[58:51] We should stand in a gap for our young
[58:53] people because some of the things they
[58:56] are facing right now cannot be compared
[58:59] to what we faced
[59:01] &gt;&gt; 15, 20, 30 years ago.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Hell has been unleashed in this age.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; And so they are fighting battles that
[59:09] some of us have no clue unless you're in
[59:12] their shoes.
[59:15] Amen. So what should we do?
[59:20] Take the role of an intercessor.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And pray for them. Intercede for
[59:26] them. Somebody stops coming to church.
[59:29] Go before the Lord and say, "Oh God,
[59:33] remember my brother. Remember my
[59:35] sister."
[59:37] If you can pick the phone. Don't wait
[59:39] for the deacons to do that. Pick the
[59:42] phone. Maybe see you God once pick the
[59:45] phone and call them and find out how are
[59:47] you doing. It's all well because we are
[59:50] a body. Some things you know we tend to
[59:53] leave it just everything to the pastor
[59:55] to the deacons and just well my job is
[59:58] to show up to church come go pay my
[1:00:00] tithing. No no no no no no. We are
[1:00:02] called to be each other's keeper.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:08] So
[1:00:10] I want to
[1:00:14] go into this story because I believe
[1:00:15] it's relevant to what we are saying now.
[1:00:18] And if you can give me St. John chapter
[1:00:20] 8, we will go through it together.
[1:00:24] Amen.
[1:00:26] Praise God.
[1:00:34] So Jesus went into the Mount of Olives.
[1:00:40] Yes, excuse me.
[1:00:46] This is verse one. It says, "Jesus
[1:00:48] went unto the Mount of Olives."
[1:00:55] If you study the life of Jesus,
[1:01:01] I believe that the mountain place
[1:01:05] was Jesus's prayer closet.
[1:01:08] Because if you look at Luke 6:12,
[1:01:12] it says, "And it came to pass in those
[1:01:14] days that he went out into the mountain
[1:01:17] to pray
[1:01:19] and continued all night in prayer."
[1:01:24] Matthew 14 23. And when he had sent away
[1:01:28] the multitudes, he went up into a
[1:01:31] mountain apart to pray.
[1:01:35] So in this scene to me it looks like
[1:01:38] Jesus
[1:01:41] has spent the night in prayer and then
[1:01:44] going to verse two. And early in the
[1:01:47] morning he came again into the temple
[1:01:52] and all the people came unto him and he
[1:01:55] sat down and taught them. So I believe
[1:01:58] that Jesus had now come freshly anointed
[1:02:02] being in prayer all night. Now he comes
[1:02:05] to church
[1:02:07] with the anointing fresh upon him and
[1:02:10] now he's ready to teach.
[1:02:13] Now we're going to go through this
[1:02:15] carefully because there's a lot that's
[1:02:18] happening in this few verses that we're
[1:02:20] going to read.
[1:02:23] So Jesus is in church teaching. Just
[1:02:26] imagine like a scenery like this.
[1:02:30] And verse three, and the scribes and the
[1:02:33] Pharisees
[1:02:35] brought unto him a woman taken in
[1:02:39] adultery.
[1:02:41] And when they had set her in the midst,
[1:02:50] they said unto him, "Master,
[1:02:53] this woman was taken in adultery in the
[1:02:56] very act."
[1:02:58] Can you imagine? To me, these were the
[1:03:01] message believers of that day,
[1:03:07] the scribes and the Pharisees.
[1:03:11] These guys were very religious
[1:03:15] yet rude
[1:03:17] and zero
[1:03:19] respect for church order. Could you
[1:03:22] imagine Jesus is preaching
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; anointed and suddenly he budge in these
[1:03:29] fellows and completely interrupt the
[1:03:32] service
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; and they say to him, "Master,
[1:03:40] this woman was caught in adultery."
[1:03:48] Verse five.
[1:03:50] This is what those guys would say today.
[1:03:52] The same Pharisees. I'm going to
[1:03:54] demonstrate it so that I can get my
[1:03:55] point across. Verse five.
[1:04:01] Now, Brother Brham, brother Brham in the
[1:04:03] message, let's say in the in the
[1:04:05] message, the spoken word is the original
[1:04:07] seed preached in 1962
[1:04:10] and said A, B, C, and D.
[1:04:13] These are the kind of things that you'd
[1:04:15] hear today. The prophet said da da da da
[1:04:18] da
[1:04:20] because they were quick to quote the
[1:04:22] prophet, right? Verse five. And Moses,
[1:04:26] now Moses in the law commanded us that
[1:04:29] such should be what? Stoned.
[1:04:34] But what sayest thou?
[1:04:37] Now the question is which law?
[1:04:41] And where was the man
[1:04:44] that had committed adultery with this
[1:04:46] woman?
[1:04:49] Because as you know, it takes two to
[1:04:50] tangle.
[1:04:56] I want to read
[1:04:58] the scripture that they thought they
[1:05:01] were referring to in Deuteronomy chapter
[1:05:03] 22:2. Let's hear what it says.
[1:05:08] If a man
[1:05:11] be found lying with a woman,
[1:05:15] this woman here was not lying alone.
[1:05:19] If a man
[1:05:21] be found lying with a woman
[1:05:25] married to an husband,
[1:05:28] then they shall both of them, not one,
[1:05:34] both of them die. both the man
[1:05:39] that lay with the woman and the woman.
[1:05:44] So shall thou put evil from Israel.
[1:05:50] But you know it's amazing that these
[1:05:52] guys
[1:05:56] brought the woman
[1:06:00] but where was the man? That's the
[1:06:02] question. Where was he?
[1:06:04] And you see
[1:06:08] our intentions.
[1:06:11] The Bible says that the word of God is
[1:06:12] sharper than a two-edged sword, a
[1:06:15] discern of the thoughts and the intents
[1:06:17] of our hearts.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Okay. In verse six, this they said
[1:06:22] tempting him that they might have sorry
[1:06:26] that they might have to accuse him. So
[1:06:30] the motive and the intent was evil. But
[1:06:34] Jesus stooped down and with his finger
[1:06:37] wrote on the ground as though he heard
[1:06:40] them not. Praise God.
[1:06:44] We must never use the word
[1:06:47] for wrong objectives because God sees
[1:06:51] the hearts.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; It will always always backfire. You
[1:06:57] know, if you have the wrong intention
[1:07:00] and we want to take the word
[1:07:03] to prove your point or do whatever,
[1:07:07] as long as your attitude, your objective
[1:07:10] is wrong, you will never get anywhere.
[1:07:13] Praise God. And this is exactly what
[1:07:15] these guys were doing. Amen. So verse
[1:07:19] seven, so when they continued asking
[1:07:21] him,
[1:07:23] he lifted up himself and said unto them,
[1:07:26] he that is without sin among you, let
[1:07:31] him cast first cast a stone at her. I
[1:07:35] like that. You notice Jesus did not even
[1:07:38] quote a single scripture.
[1:07:42] He said, you know what?
[1:07:45] Okay.
[1:07:47] If you have not sinned,
[1:07:50] go ahead. I give you the green light.
[1:07:53] Throw the first stone.
[1:08:00] And he waited. I'm sure he waited.
[1:08:05] We don't need to argue and get into
[1:08:08] debates with anybody. I don't believe in
[1:08:11] arguing and debating to prove anything.
[1:08:15] Jesus did not do it as we can see.
[1:08:19] So neither should we as Christians get
[1:08:21] into debates and arguments.
[1:08:25] Brother Brham says this in the message.
[1:08:27] We are going to continue with the eight
[1:08:28] verse but I want to read this quote. He
[1:08:30] says, "Oh, how we need in Jeffersonville
[1:08:36] is thousands of lived voices.
[1:08:40] The thunder of God thundering out in
[1:08:44] sweetness
[1:08:46] and holiness, purity, undefiled lives
[1:08:50] walking around in the earth without a
[1:08:52] blemish." Yes, sir. Real Christians,
[1:08:56] that's a thunder against the enemy.
[1:08:58] Amen.
[1:09:00] The devil don't care how loud you can
[1:09:02] holler.
[1:09:04] The devil doesn't care how much you can
[1:09:06] jump and how much you can do this
[1:09:10] or shout. But what hurts the devil is to
[1:09:14] see is to is to see that sanctified
[1:09:19] holy consecrated life
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; to God. Amen.
[1:09:25] Say anything to him. Call him anything
[1:09:30] just as sweet as it can be and move
[1:09:34] right on. Oh my. That throws him away.
[1:09:38] That's the thunder that shakes the
[1:09:40] devil.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:43] So Jesus stooped down.
[1:09:48] Thank you.
[1:09:53] So after he has given them the green
[1:09:55] light, he stoops down again and begins
[1:09:58] to write.
[1:10:02] And they which heard it, verse 9, being
[1:10:05] convicted by their own conscience, went
[1:10:08] out one by one, beginning at the eldest,
[1:10:15] even unto the last.
[1:10:17] And Jesus was left alone.
[1:10:21] and the woman standing in the midst.
[1:10:26] As we can see,
[1:10:29] Jesus did not even raise his voice.
[1:10:32] As we can see, he did not go and look
[1:10:35] for quotes.
[1:10:37] As we can see,
[1:10:40] he really didn't do much speaking.
[1:10:45] But there's a way God knows how to get
[1:10:47] to our conscience because He sees our
[1:10:50] hearts
[1:10:52] and he did things in such a way that
[1:10:55] once he was done
[1:10:59] their conscience bore record against
[1:11:02] them.
[1:11:04] Well, they may not have been guilty of
[1:11:07] adultery,
[1:11:10] but what about
[1:11:12] maybe backbiting?
[1:11:15] They may not have been guilty of
[1:11:17] adultery, but maybe
[1:11:20] one had stole the night before.
[1:11:23] Is that right?
[1:11:25] You know, there are so many things that
[1:11:28] we can do as individuals and make the
[1:11:31] outside look so good,
[1:11:33] so holy that when people look at us,
[1:11:38] they say, "Wow,
[1:11:41] he or she looks like a real nice person,
[1:11:43] like a real Christian."
[1:11:46] But do you know that inside of that can
[1:11:48] be full of like Jesus says they're full
[1:11:50] of dead men's bones,
[1:11:52] corrupt,
[1:11:54] evil thoughts, evil intentions. You
[1:11:57] know, there are things that we can hide,
[1:11:59] but the Holy Spirit knows how to get to
[1:12:01] what's inside of our hearts. Praise God.
[1:12:05] And this was exactly what happened here.
[1:12:08] So the word came to strip away
[1:12:11] everything that looked like,
[1:12:14] you know,
[1:12:16] that was hidden.
[1:12:19] And let me say this,
[1:12:22] every one of us here today, we have so
[1:12:25] many accusers against us.
[1:12:28] I don't necessarily mean physical
[1:12:31] accusers. Maybe some of us are fighting
[1:12:34] the accuser of guilt and shame.
[1:12:38] It could be complexes of the past that
[1:12:41] constantly keep hounding and pounding at
[1:12:44] you.
[1:12:45] Amen.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; It could be the accuser of cancer,
[1:12:52] depression,
[1:12:54] oppression,
[1:12:56] broken relationships.
[1:13:00] These are some of the accusers many of
[1:13:01] us deal with. And we are constantly
[1:13:04] being bombarded with these things
[1:13:07] because the Bible tells us that Satan,
[1:13:09] he is what? The accuser of the brethren.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; That spirit
[1:13:17] does not come from God. And so any
[1:13:20] Christian should never be found with
[1:13:22] that kind of a spirit on them. Praise
[1:13:25] God.
[1:13:26] Because Satan, that's his job, is to
[1:13:28] constantly accuse and make the believer
[1:13:32] feel guilty, worthless.
[1:13:36] And some of us, we can't seem to get
[1:13:40] over these things because we allow the
[1:13:43] devil to play with our minds. But I'm
[1:13:45] here to remind you today
[1:13:48] that there is one who can change that
[1:13:51] circumstance for you. Amen. No matter
[1:13:55] what you're going through,
[1:13:57] Jesus is here to set you free.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; And when all is said and done,
[1:14:05] it's just going to be you and him.
[1:14:08] And like Jesus said, where are thine
[1:14:12] accusers?
[1:14:14] Hallelujah. Where are your accusers? The
[1:14:17] word we've like on this weekend, we
[1:14:19] heard powerful messages.
[1:14:22] Now many of us
[1:14:25] have to go back and face the reality.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; You know when the anointing is here, you
[1:14:31] can feel
[1:14:34] great.
[1:14:36] But guess what? God has ordained it that
[1:14:40] we must go back to the battlefield
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; and face the enemy.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; And that's where now you need to know
[1:14:48] where you stand.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:52] But I want to tell you that like Jesus
[1:14:55] said, I will never leave you, neither
[1:14:58] will I forsake you, for I will be with
[1:15:00] you even in you.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; So when he sends us, he goes in us.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Verse 10.
[1:15:11] And when Jesus lifted up himself
[1:15:15] and saw none but the woman, he said unto
[1:15:18] her,"Woman,
[1:15:19] where are thine accusers?
[1:15:24] Where are they?
[1:15:27] Hath no man condemned thee?"
[1:15:30] She said, "No man, Lord." And Jesus said
[1:15:34] unto her, "Neither do I condemn thee.
[1:15:39] will go and sin no more.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; That is our God.
[1:15:50] That is
[1:15:52] our savior.
[1:15:56] Brother Brham said this. He said at one
[1:15:59] point he thought that Jesus loved him
[1:16:04] and God was angry at him. You know,
[1:16:07] sometimes we walk around with this
[1:16:08] mentality that God is ready to strike us
[1:16:11] the moment we do something wrong.
[1:16:16] But no, it's not the case.
[1:16:22] Amen.
[1:16:23] Because the blood is still here to atone
[1:16:28] for our mistakes.
[1:16:30] I believe as long as the bride is still
[1:16:32] present on the earth, that mercy seat is
[1:16:35] still available.
[1:16:37] There's mercy.
[1:16:39] And so, let's now read verse 12.
[1:16:43] I like this. Then Jesus
[1:16:46] then spake Jesus again. In other words,
[1:16:50] now he's going to resume the service.
[1:16:55] He spake again. In other words, it's
[1:16:59] like saying, "Where were we?" Let's
[1:17:00] continue with the service now.
[1:17:04] And said unto them, saying, "I am the
[1:17:08] light of the world. He that followeth me
[1:17:12] shall not walk in darkness, but shall
[1:17:15] have the light of life."
[1:17:18] Amen.
[1:17:20] You know, Brother Brham
[1:17:22] told this story which I was really
[1:17:25] blessed with. And this is why I like our
[1:17:28] prophet because he was honest.
[1:17:32] He shared things which he wasn't ashamed
[1:17:35] of.
[1:17:36] And I believe that God allowed him to go
[1:17:39] through some things to be an example to
[1:17:42] us.
[1:17:44] Amen. And so I want to read this story
[1:17:46] in closing.
[1:17:49] I'm going to skim through a lot of it
[1:17:51] because of time,
[1:17:54] but this was where brother Brham met
[1:17:57] this old woman in the restaurant.
[1:18:00] And while there, he was condemning her
[1:18:03] in his heart.
[1:18:06] And this is what he says.
[1:18:09] He says, "Condemn no one. Love
[1:18:12] everybody."
[1:18:14] If you can't love from your heart, then
[1:18:17] Christ is not with you.
[1:18:21] Okay. Then he gives the background of
[1:18:23] the story. He says, "At Toledo, Ohio, I
[1:18:26] went into a into a restaurant
[1:18:29] that I had been eating at a little
[1:18:32] dunker place. Lovely, lovely little
[1:18:35] place. They were so nice. But that
[1:18:38] afternoon, they had closed up to go to
[1:18:40] Sunday school.
[1:18:42] And when they did, I had to cross to go
[1:18:45] across the street to a worldly little
[1:18:49] old place. And I walked in there. Okay.
[1:18:54] Going to skip. And sitting in a chair,
[1:18:56] here sat an elderly lady as old as my
[1:19:00] mother.
[1:19:03] 55, 58 years old. He gives an estimate.
[1:19:06] Okay, I'm going to jump. And there she
[1:19:08] was sitting, her poor flesh, flabby.
[1:19:12] She had that kind of an orchid looking
[1:19:15] manicure
[1:19:17] ever whatever you call it on her lips
[1:19:19] and a little bitty haircut like a man
[1:19:22] that fuzzed all up
[1:19:25] and there she was sitting
[1:19:28] with manicure all over her face
[1:19:34] and she was sitting there with two old
[1:19:36] men. one of them with a big old scarf
[1:19:39] around his neck and in June sitting
[1:19:42] there and he got up and was kind of
[1:19:44] drinking and she was drinking too
[1:19:48] and looking around.
[1:19:51] Amen.
[1:19:52] And I thought, now listen to what the
[1:19:54] prophet is saying. He's now confessing
[1:19:56] his thoughts.
[1:19:58] And I thought,
[1:20:00] "Oh God,
[1:20:03] why don't you just wipe away the thing
[1:20:07] off the map of the earth?" Sorry, off of
[1:20:10] the map.
[1:20:12] Why don't you
[1:20:15] look out here in these parks and these
[1:20:17] things and what goes on? And I thought,
[1:20:19] "Oh, God,
[1:20:20] I'm glad you took Sharon if it was your
[1:20:23] will." Now he's referring to his
[1:20:24] daughter who God took took off the
[1:20:26] scene.
[1:20:28] How can your holy righteousness stand
[1:20:30] it? Now you see the prophet's attitude.
[1:20:33] And I'm I'm sure many of us have been in
[1:20:36] this situation because you feel safe.
[1:20:38] You've crossed over.
[1:20:42] Look
[1:20:44] like your righteous indignation would
[1:20:48] fly out there and blow this place up.
[1:20:55] And then he says this, "And I heard the
[1:20:57] angel of the Lord said, "Come aside."
[1:21:00] Praise God. I'm so glad that God knows
[1:21:04] where to meet us. I walked over and when
[1:21:08] he got through with me, I felt like a
[1:21:12] different person.
[1:21:16] What are you condemning her for? This is
[1:21:18] the angel now. I said, look at that. the
[1:21:23] way she is.
[1:21:24] And then he says, "And I saw a vision, a
[1:21:28] world
[1:21:30] like this round, another world, but this
[1:21:33] world here, it had a rainbow around it.
[1:21:37] And that was the blood of Christ that
[1:21:39] protects the God's wrath.
[1:21:42] He couldn't look upon that. He would
[1:21:45] destroy it immediately."
[1:21:49] Then I thought like this. I sin myself
[1:21:52] although I didn't do that but I was a
[1:21:55] sinner anyhow
[1:21:58] and then the blood of Jesus acts to us
[1:22:01] like a bumper.
[1:22:04] Amen. So around this world is covered by
[1:22:10] the blood because remember that Jesus
[1:22:12] died for the sin of the world.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Is that right? That's why the prophet
[1:22:18] said that those people in the world can
[1:22:20] do all their wickedness, have their rock
[1:22:22] and roll parties, commit adultery, and
[1:22:25] seems like nothing is going on.
[1:22:28] You know why? He says because they are
[1:22:30] being protected by the blood. But there
[1:22:33] will come a day when that blood is going
[1:22:36] to be lifted. Praise God. I'm going to
[1:22:39] skip to wind this down.
[1:22:43] The prophet said um so he saw his sins
[1:22:48] how it act like a bumper says then he
[1:22:50] took his hand dipped it in his side took
[1:22:52] some blood and wrote across it and said
[1:22:55] pardoned this is his sins now threw it
[1:22:58] back in a sea of forgetfulness to
[1:23:00] remember it no more
[1:23:02] after I came out of it I walked over and
[1:23:06] sat down now he's going to the lady and
[1:23:08] he said how do you do ma'am
[1:23:12] She said, "Oh, hello."
[1:23:15] And I said, "If you'll pardon me, I'm
[1:23:18] Reverend William Brham, a minister."
[1:23:23] I said, "Lady," I just told her the
[1:23:26] story. I said, "I was standing there and
[1:23:29] I was condemning you and thinking, what
[1:23:33] a horrible thing.
[1:23:35] Maybe you've got children." She said, "I
[1:23:38] have." I said, "What caused the way to
[1:23:42] go wrong?"
[1:23:44] She begin to unfold a story to me that
[1:23:47] would ren the heart of anything.
[1:23:52] Do you see why we can't judge things on
[1:23:55] the surface?
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; And that's why brother Brhamy many times
[1:23:58] in the discernment, he would not just
[1:24:00] lay hands on people. That's why his
[1:24:02] ministry was different.
[1:24:04] He dealt with the root cause of
[1:24:06] problems.
[1:24:08] And we cannot just take quick decisions
[1:24:11] and condemn people. Sometimes people
[1:24:14] have complexes. That's why they are the
[1:24:16] way they are. Maybe their behavior is
[1:24:19] due to something that happened in their
[1:24:21] childhood. And until we understand these
[1:24:24] things,
[1:24:26] we are treading on dangerous grounds.
[1:24:29] So, brother Brham discovers by hearing
[1:24:32] her story, he comes to this conclusion
[1:24:34] that
[1:24:38] she was in a in in a pitiful condition.
[1:24:41] And you could see from this attitude of
[1:24:43] being judgmental, suddenly he realizes
[1:24:46] that I've made a horrible mistake.
[1:24:49] And I said, I was asking God,
[1:24:52] why didn't he just rake such off the
[1:24:56] earth? Now he's telling the lady this
[1:24:59] and here you are here with these two
[1:25:02] drunken men and you are drunk yourself
[1:25:04] and I said someday the blood of Jesus
[1:25:07] sorry the blood is holding God's wrath
[1:25:10] off from you. You are going to die one
[1:25:13] of these days and then you are a free
[1:25:16] moral agent now. You can reject or
[1:25:19] receive it. And I said, "But someday
[1:25:22] your soul is going beyond there where
[1:25:26] there's no mercy left. And if you die in
[1:25:28] your sins, you're already judged." Then
[1:25:32] he says this. You know what? That woman
[1:25:34] slipped down out of that seat there in
[1:25:36] that restaurant. We had a prayer meeting
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; like you've never heard in your life and
[1:25:43] she came to Christ.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Thank you. So don't judge.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:54] Extend mercy. Extend grace because we
[1:25:58] are still
[1:26:00] on a journey.
[1:26:02] And until we make it in, we need the
[1:26:06] grace of God.
[1:26:09] Amen. May the Lord bless you.
[1:26:13] Let's stand to our feets.
[1:26:24] We'll have our song leader come if you
[1:26:26] don't mind. I just feel like singing
[1:26:29] this song as we close off.
[1:26:34] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[1:26:38] If it was not for his blood,
[1:26:41] none of us would be here today.
[1:26:44] And so as we sing this song,
[1:26:50] let's just remember this one thing. If
[1:26:54] there's one thing you're going to take
[1:26:55] tonight with you
[1:26:57] is that the blood of Jesus is still
[1:27:01] available tonight
[1:27:05] atoning for our sins, for our mistakes.
[1:27:11] And so I trust that no matter what has
[1:27:14] happened in your life, no matter what
[1:27:16] you're going through,
[1:27:18] [Music]
[1:27:20] just know that the accuser,
[1:27:24] which is Satan,
[1:27:27] he has already been defeated.
[1:27:30] And Jesus said that he who the son has
[1:27:33] set free is what? Is free indeed.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:40] So let's sing that song. Nothing but the
[1:27:42] blood of Jesus will
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; precious
[1:27:48] the flow.

[1:27:53] makes me white as no
[1:28:01] other
[1:28:02] found. I know
[1:28:06] nothing but the blood of Jesus.
