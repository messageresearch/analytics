We gather, Lord, to honor your resurrection, to give you thanks and praise, Lord, for your mercy and grace, for the Lord shedding your blood for us, heavenly father, forgiving us, Lord, of our sins, transgressions, Lord, unbelief, heavenly father. We know, Lord, that you are a merciful God. You've seen how we've struggled through the week, heavenly father. Lord, ups and downs and trials, oh God. about our patience being tried, Lord. We've won. Sometimes we've lost, heavenly father. But we can count on you, Lord, that if we confess our sins, our shortcomings, Lord, that you'll forgive us, heavenly father. Lord, we just bring, Lord, our friends and our family, Lord, our own personal sicknesses and things that are burdens just upon our hearts, heavenly father. We just lay them down before you, heavenly father, believing, Lord, that you are able to, Lord, to solve any issue, to heal any problem, heavenly father. And we just want to say thank you, Lord. And as we've gathered here together, Lord, we want to thank you for a wonderful pastor, oh God. Lord, a man after your own calling, Lord, a man after your own heart who's taken time, Lord, to study your word, Lord, to bring forth something today for your people. And Lord, we all claim that there's something today that you have to speak to us, Lord. Some answer, something that we're seeking in our heart, heavenly father. And your word today has that answer. Oh God, we ask you, Lord, whether it's here, us, Lord, somebody at home, Lord, sitting on a couch or bed, unable, Lord, to get up, Lord, by the end of this service, heavenly father, may there be faith in our heart to know, Lord, that it's already done. &gt;&gt; Amen. Heavenly Father, bless us now as we gather to worship and praise and sing. Lord, bless your servants. Oh God, thank you for brother Mike. Thank you for these musicians and singers. Oh God, you've blessed them with a talent. And Lord, they could be out there in the world and singing heavenly father, but they chose to dedicate it to you as Lord offering. Bless them, oh God. Give them skill and understanding and add unto those things, Lord. We ask in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right, you can be seated. Wonderful.

I as a matter of fact, I'm already blessed, &gt;&gt; but I want to be more blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the only thing I can bless in this hour really is the revelation of the hour. Right? That is the thing we need more than anything else. Uh all right. A flat if you would. I singing this this morning, but where we go from here, who knows? It goes more than anyone else. I want to see Jesus. I want to see suffering. I'll praise and adore you and tell my love more than anyone. I want to see Jesus.

Brothers, come for the offering. I believe the Lord has a great table bread for us. The move is on. I you realize that wherever you might be spiritually speaking this morning, wherever you might be, listen up. Wherever you might be, you've got to move on further. Right? Is that is that settled in your heart? You can't stay where you're at. It's good. It's wonderful, but you've got to move again. And we're trusting God this morning. By the end of the service, everyone's going to move again. All right. Praise the Lord. Come on, Eugene. Blessings for us. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads.

[Music] Uh just to let you know that um I'm just here to bring a simple message that somehow bless your soul. Amen. Not to inform you but to transform you. Uh just to bring something that when we leave here we will be changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That the word of God will change our lives and make us into what he wants us to be. In other words, what I'm doing here uh is applying the token. Praise the Lord. You see, I'm not presenting the token because by now you should know who and what that is. But I'm applying the token to your lives as a bomb in Gilead that God will bring about healing uh deliverance, encouragement and strength. Praise the Lord. uh for uh the topic today we'd like to speak on Jesus Christ our rock in troubled times we are certainly know what times we're living in but just before I commence uh let us just stand and have a brief prayer it's all right I'm just making you get some calisthenics so that You're always alert and awake, right? Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Our gracious heavenly father, what a joy to know that we have this privilege of you allowing us to speak to your wife and to bring the your word to her. We pray Lord that as we come together with our frail and our failings that you will be our strength. You will be our guide. You will be our all in all. We pray you'll watch over us. May the Spirit search through the congregation. May he search every heart. May he apply the word where it's needed. Give strength to the weak knees. Lift up the fallen. Encourage those that are discouraged. The ones that may be swaying, uncertain. May the spirit of God give us certainty. Father, we give ourselves to you now for service, to receive, to hear, and to apply in Jesus' name. Amen. And amen. God bless you all. Our scriptures will be given to us now. Psalms 31:E3. For thou art my rock and my fortress. Therefore, for thy name's sake, lead me and guide me. 1 Corinthians 10, reading from verses 1 to 4. Moreover, brethren, I would not that you should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and were baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea. And did all eat the same spiritual meat? and did all drink the same spiritual drink. For they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ. Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. God bless you. Please be seated. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; There's an old hymn that some of you may know. that says, "The Lord's our rock. In him we hide, our shelter in the time of storm. A shade by day, defense by night, a shelter in the time of storm. No fears alarm, no fears of fright. He's our shelter in the time of storm. And the chorus of that song says, "Jesus is the rock in the weary land, a weary land. Jesus is the rock in the weary land, a shelter in a time of storm." Amen. Friends, in these troubled times of chaos, instability, and uncertainty, I want you to know that with everything around us shaking, everything around us falling apart, uh it seems like there is no solid ground anywhere that you can place your faith or your foot upon. on. But I'm here to tell you today that Jesus Christ, the word of God revealed to us, is our rock in the midst of these troubled times. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; None can dispute the fact that this world is weary and tired. The earth, brother Brandham says, is weary and tired. They have been taking out he says the framework uh or like he says like the skeleton or the bones of a man digging it away with all kinds of mining and everything else. Okay. But the world is weary and tired of what's been going on. Weary of wars, weary and tired of all the pollutants and pollution everywhere that's taking place. And we are certainly know that we are living in trouble sometimes. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. These are times of stormy weather, brother. Amen. Everything is very stormy around us. The world and all the systems of the world are rocking and reeling. They are in total chaos. that do not know what they're doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in the words of our prophet, this world is falling apart. &gt;&gt; But thank God. But Jesus lives deep down in our hearts. &gt;&gt; That is why we are here this morning. We're not gathered here for a treatise, a lecture or for some uh what should I say informational uh word. But we are here to have something that will make you act upon the word. &gt;&gt; You have heard, you have recognized the iron time is upon us that we must act upon the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is calling upon us for action. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes, sir. We see not only the world but the church, the worldwide church and all the church systems that they have made to create a better church than God himself. The church world is in birth pains. Hallelujah. And we know that we are the babe in their mind. simple people uh uh babes in the middle of it all. Well, we are they are in birth pains to give up for a rapture has to take place to take us out of this and bring us into the presence of God. Under the strains and the pressures of the present age, all the whole world and the individuals that live in the world are swiftly falling into deep pits of blackness and depression. How many knows that's true? Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, they built a massive hospital up here on a mountain. Up there in a mountain in Hamilton, St. Joseph's before we had such an alarm, they already built it because they knew a wave of madness, a wave of insanity. And I'm going to say it the way Jesus used to say it because many times they try to make it in very nice cultured uh terms but Jesus call it a deaf devil or a blind spirit or a crippled spirit is on that person or he'll tell them that uh here was a legion insane and screaming and hollering right he didn't need a psychiatrist he needed a great physician. He needed a b from Gilead. &gt;&gt; He needed a touch from God. Hallelujah. And that's what most people need here today. But they won't admit it. They rather to go thinking they have to need some medicine. Amen. And they are okay. Doctors do their job and so on and so on. But in the depths of us, what we need is a power of God to strike our souls and bring us out of our chaos that we are in. &gt;&gt; Bring us out of the world's insanity and the madness that is all around us. &gt;&gt; People are trying to walk and be good people and they're falling into deep pits of despair. They're falling into holes of depression. blackness all around them. They wake up. Uh they can't hardly function. Uh it's nothing to do with whether the person is intelligent or if they are poor or they're rich. It hits everybody. &gt;&gt; Everybody that doesn't have the hold of God. And even those who have Jesus Christ have to watch themselves because the devil is coming after you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. He's coming after you. Amen. That devil is on the track as I've always sang and he's trying to turn us back, but I'm running up the shining way. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Yes, sir. Amen. Many others, they're making a slippery descent into the pits of hell, into darkness and madness. mental uh madness. Absolutely. Wasn't it our prophet who spoke the word and said it will come to pass the entire world will go insane &gt;&gt; except the members of the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Those why because they already exchanged their mind for the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They're not going by their own mind. Oh, my mind told me this, my mind told me that, my mind told me the other. No, they're not even trusting their own mind. They're resting on the word of God. They're resting on the mind of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes, sir. Praise God. How many people are being haunted and haunted by demons of their past? demons of their past rising up. And let me tell you, I'm not ruling out and saying, "Oh, it's only the sinners out there." I'm talking about even believers. The devil is going to try to haunt you. The hounds of hell are going to come after you and they're going to be howling in your heart, in your mind, bringing up all kinds of stuff you done before you were born again. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. And those countless hordes of demons, as brother Brham says, those 240 uh is it thousand or million horsemen? &gt;&gt; Millions of horsemen, devils loosening this world. And why did they come down? He says what? War to the earth. Because your adversary has come, the devil has come down and he know that his time is short. He's going to try to do and he's trying to do as much damage as he can do before he is taken out of here. &gt;&gt; Oh my. So, we've got to be on our guard with the word of God solid within our hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. And sometimes these devils that haunt us are not devils maybe out of our personal experiences. Maybe not devils out of our personal past. Do you know you can be followed by family spirits, &gt;&gt; demons from your family past where in the word of God he says sometimes God let a curse upon a family because one family member did a certain certain thing. He says, "And that will follow them down to the third and fourth generation." &gt;&gt; Brother Brham one time went to pray for one woman and uh uh fine. He prayed for her. He was about to lay his hands on a another woman's child and pray for it. The Holy Spirit said, "No, take your hands off. There's a curse on that family. It hasn't worked its way out of that family as yet. If you pray that off, that thing will come on you. &gt;&gt; So you keep away from he just had to take his hands off completely. Amen. Praise God. Let me tell you something, friends. These are not story books. This is not a story book we're reading here or a picture book of some child story written thousands of years ago. This is real, friends. Devils are real. They're in this world &gt;&gt; and I'm telling you because I'm I face them. I've met them. I talk to them. They talk to me. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Cast them out in Jesus Christ's name for his glory and honor and they are real today. He tries to push himself in the background as if he doesn't exist. Witches don't exist anymore. Witchcraft, those are uncultured. People talk about those things. Rich doctors, those are primitive stuff. They they don't happen today. Let me tell you, they're right in your midst. &gt;&gt; They're right in the world here today. &gt;&gt; Change their name, call it psychic, change their name, and and call it all kinds of stuff. Some have even come right in the pulpit. &gt;&gt; And call themselves preachers of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Amen. Yes, sir. And lying to the people of God. Yes. &gt;&gt; And the people of God have not put themselves in a place where they have enough discernment by Hebrews 4:12, the word in you should be quick and sharper than a two-edged sword. Hallelujah. To recognize your day and the day in which you are living. Amen. Praise God. We had one man came here to preach. Amen. Claiming he believed the message. Oh my. in the middle of preaching. I don't mean here in this church at this present time, but while the church was in another location and he came to preach in the middle of preaching, I'm sitting in the back all of a sudden it struck me. Amen. So, I could have stopped him right then, but I wait till he finished. We took him in the office. He said, "Uh uh, brother, you claim that you believe the message. You're a preacher and all this, but I perceive you're a homosexual. He says, "How dare you to tell me something like that? Do you know my life and who I am and don't fall into judgment?" Uh, you know, all this stuff about judging people and all. He started talking like that. I said, "Well, brother, you don't have to become emotional of it. Just just tell these uh deacons here that I'm I'm lying or I told a lie you or what I said was wrong." He says, "I don't have to do that." I said, "You know why you don't have to do that? Because you're not just talking to me. The one that revealed it to me. You're telling him he's a liar. And you know, you can't do that. If you do that, you wouldn't even walk out of here." So he says, "Oh, he he says, I preach in such big church somewhere out there with with so many thousand members." I said, "But you're not there. You're here." I'm talking to you now, right? So, you answer me of what I'm saying. He says, "I don't have to answer you." I said, "Then you can't stay around here. You have to leave right now." So, we we just got him a hotel, let him go, took care of it, and the brothers took him there. But the they did not stand around and wait to see him sign in. So, then but the next day I I sent them back to find out how is he doing. when they go back and they ask for him, the hotel said there's no such a person in here, said, "But he was at the desk." They said, "But even if he was at the desk, he did not sign in. That person isn't here. He disappeared." Well, maybe a month later, here comes the Hamilton U police and they came to me and said, "Uh, Mr. Simon, uh, did you have such and such a person, uh, at your church? I said, yes. They said, uh, uh, you do you know that, um, we have him, uh, arrested in Northern Ontario. He's now in jail because he committed acts, right, as a homosexual, and we have him in jail now. I said, "Oh my goodness, he's in jail." and and I said, "Yes, and he's going to stay there, right? Uh um and pay for his crimes." Okay. The word of God was fulfilled. About a two years later, I got a call. Hi, Mr. Simon. How are you? I said, I'm fine. Who's speaking? So, this is uh I'm about to speak his name. Inspector So and So, he says, "You know, we've caught that guy again. And this time we're putting him away for good. I want you to understand this was a man claimed to be following this message driving with the believers in the car and he will say when we go around the corner there's going to be a man uh doing this this this that and and he will tell them things and when they go around the corner there it is there it is. So you see, don't put your faith in miracles. &gt;&gt; No, don't rest your faith on gifts though are real gifts. Praise God. I know because some are in me. I can't help that. And I'm not saying it boastfully or anything like that. I I couldn't help that since I was a little child. I would know things and I didn't know how I knew. But but after the message came, then I began to understand that that that something wasn't me that I didn't put there. I don't have nothing to do with it. And so there it is, brother, sister. Now we're talking the message now. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. We're talking the message now because the message is not just the spoken word books. The message is not just the writings in the Bible. The message is Christ the Lost, &gt;&gt; the the invisible person of Christ on the scene. &gt;&gt; That's the message. That's really He is the message. Is that right? Oh, praise God. Do you believe the word of God? Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; You believe he doesn't change. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. And God, he in our midst. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. To meet our every need. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If we trust him, he will never fail. The God we serve cannot fail. He cannot lie. He cannot change. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. And so those devils and while I'm preaching, search yourself. I don't know. I'm This is just the word God gave me. &gt;&gt; Right. Third, fourth generation. And those devils want to follow you. And you want to know why I'm acting like this, why I'm doing this, why I'm this way. They're there to try to influence you in every way. Amen. See, praise God. Following your following you right on down to this particular time. You say, "Well, brother Simon, why is all this happening?" It's happening because the whole world has moved away from its foundation. &gt;&gt; What's the foundation? Hebrews tells us, we understand clearly &gt;&gt; that the world was framed by the word of God. &gt;&gt; The foundation of the entire world is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And without the word, the world will fall apart. &gt;&gt; Take out the word out of the world and the world falls apart. &gt;&gt; All right? So, it's moved from its foundation. Not only the world but the church world has moved away from its foundation. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. And they they create all kind of mad man-made systems, right? uh and created all kind of religious chaos, confusion, and like some of the Israelites, they're going back to Babylon, back to Babel, trying to build up big cathedrals and big mega churches. &gt;&gt; Amen. I realize I'm not speaking just to you here, &gt;&gt; but this is going worldwide. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's reaching out across Africa. &gt;&gt; There are brethren listening over there in Africa. &gt;&gt; Uh sometimes when I go home then I'll get the WhatsApp or text saying they watched or they listen to the service other people that not in this building right in this country or even in America that will respond and let me know they heard the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't just look at yourself and think it's you alone. No, there are thousands around hearing the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. Praise God. They moved away from their original foundation which was the unchangeable, unshakable word of God. For Jesus said, "The true foundation, upon this rock, I'll build my church, and the gates of hell will not prevail against it." &gt;&gt; And that wasn't on Peter. And that wasn't on some rock, you know, on the shores of uh uh uh Galilee. Praise God. Amen. I know because uh there's a Catholic church there, and they have a big rock with a brass plaque on it. This is where Jesus was standing when he said so so so upon this rock. Amen. Not upon the pope. Not upon anything like that. Amen. They all have their place. Amen. I even the pope I respect him in this position. Amen. And the power that he exercises. He is even a brother in Christ because he names the name of Christ. And if they're not uh against us, they're for us. Amen. Praise God. Just leave them alone. Let them do what they have to do and you do what they have to do. &gt;&gt; Focus on what you have to do. Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. Praise God. And the gates of hell will not prevail against it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You hear that? &gt;&gt; The denominational gates of hell, right? Uh let me not go off there because that's the whoredom of Revelation 19. Her gates are the gates to hell and so on and so and he said they will not prevail against it &gt;&gt; which means they're going to fight. They are going to fight and they are fighting but they will not prevail &gt;&gt; because they they they think you born to lose. Well, you're not born to lose. You're bound to win. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're bound to win because God already wrote it that you are going to win. You are going in the bride. Amen. Praise the Lord. You are part of it. Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. So, individuals have done the same thing and moved away from the word of God. Some move to monasticism. Some move off into masonic lodges. Some move into silk secret societies. Some move into things that will give them influence and power and riches like such and they move off from their foundations of the simple word of God. Amen. Let's have the scripture of Matthew 7:24 and let's read it uh together. Therefore, whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them, I will liken unto a wise man who built his house upon a rock. Say rock. &gt;&gt; Rock. &gt;&gt; Say rock. &gt;&gt; Rock. He built his house on a rock and the rains descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock. He's speaking about the bright church here of course that all that's going to happen. Persecutions, winds, storms going to come but it's not go it's going to beat on it but it'll try to prevail but it can't. Amen. Because what? It was founded upon the rock. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Christ is our rock in these troubled times. &gt;&gt; And everyone that heareth, Amen. Not with your ears. Amen. Everyone that heareth understands hears with your heart. Speaks to your heart. Amen. Praise God. these saints of mine and doeth them not shall be lightened unto a foolish man who built his house upon the sand. And the rains descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it. Of course, there's prophecy in there and everything else telling you about Babylon's going to fall and so on so on. Praise the Lord. Now, uh, in the Old Testament, David said, "The Lord is my rock and my fortress." &gt;&gt; Amen. I come forth up in the Lord. Amen. Uh, they said, uh, Rock of Ages, the person that wrote it, he was out in the rain. He was walking. Rain came and he was looking for somewhere to shelter. And he noticed birds flying around. Noticed a dove just fly and go right into a cliff in the rock and and sat there while the storm and the rain was just going on. And he wrote that wonderful hymn, Rock of Ages cliff for me to hide in. In other words, praise the Lord. And we're so thankful that Jesus Christ is our rock. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul said the rock that went with them in our opening scripture was Christ. &gt;&gt; Now this was no ordinary rock. It was a supernatural rock because the rock that followed them, that rock was Christ. This was a rock that was moving. Wherever they went, it went with them. And you can be assured everywhere you go, the Lord is with you. &gt;&gt; Do you know that? How many knows that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are never alone. &gt;&gt; The Lord is always with you. &gt;&gt; No matter whether you feel his presence, you don't sense his presence. You don't think so. It has nothing to do with your thoughts. The Lord is always there with his people. &gt;&gt; God in the shadows watching over his own. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. With his watchful eye, loving care, he's watching out for his children. Now, when Jesus spoke about building on a rock, give let let me continue to speak and let me finish what I have to say. Okay? &gt;&gt; He was making sure that we understand that he wants us to build on a solid, stable, and sure foundation. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what he was talking about. You build. Now that principle applies to the church as you could see there. Uh you know what a prophet has that drawing. Of course we know that the foundation is Jesus Christ. Uh right there it's founded on him. The word of God. But he want to be sure that we understand that principle. We always build on a solid foundation. Amen. Praise God. If you're building any building, you need a solid foundation. &gt;&gt; Somebody tell me if I'm telling you the truth. &gt;&gt; You don't just go take a building and just build. No, they drill down until they find bedrock. They got to find bedrock. You think they can go up and up 73 stories and more up up like that and didn't go down first? My friends, the Bible just always tell you before you can go up, humble yourself. &gt;&gt; You you the the more you go down is the more you go up. &gt;&gt; You see, you humble yourself. Praise God. Don't even think of yourself as anybody or anything. Amen. Just go down and then you'll go up. So, they got to drill down until they hit bedrock. Then they say, "Ah, now we can start." Praise God. You think they're going to stop halfway and build on something else? No sir. Amen. You got to have a solid rock foundation. If you're building roads, you need to have proper solid rock foundations. If that area don't have rocks, they got they're going to bring the rocks. They got to truck the rocks in and put the rocks there because it needs a proper rock foundation. If it doesn't have it, the road breaks up in a short while, right? But you got to have solid rock foundation. If you're going to build a bridge over the ocean, and I traveled on one from uh Portugal right across that narrow straight in the Mediterranean there, I think it was 18 miles across there and it was right across the that Mediterranean Sea where it meets with the Atlantic there. Praise God. And a marvel of engineering. Just think of it there. Build it. But you know what? Before they can even start to build, they had to have people going down there diving and drilling and digging until they can hit bedrock. &gt;&gt; Amen. When they hit bedrock, then they'll start putting the pylons or pillars. They start to put them in before they can go over. Praise God. And the same thing goes for everything else. If you are going to build a church, you have to build it on the rock foundation. &gt;&gt; You cannot build it on yourself. It'll fall apart. Build it on your fame. You build up a great name. You spread it around the world and people know you. They turn up by thousands to hear you speak. You build it on that. It only will last for a certain amount of time. It will not last in the presence of God. It will not last in eternity. We must build on Christ, the solid rock, the word of God. Hallelujah. Build it upon ourselves, building on a denominational system, trying to build a church and various means. Right? Like that. If you're going to start a family or you are in the middle right now of starting a family, you need the solid foundation or the word of God to build it on. If that family is not built on that and later on the pressures of life begin to come, &gt;&gt; the family is going to be stressed out, strained out, and it may even fall apart. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you. And what I'm saying, this is not to sinners out there in the world, only even to Christians. &gt;&gt; Amen. precious scum even on the marriage of Christians and the tension comes. Amen. Praise God. So the family needs to be built on the word &gt;&gt; so that you always go back to the word of God. You go back to the revealed word of God. Praise the name of the Lord God. You want to build a proper real friendship. What's it built on? You think it just built on like it built on love? Oh. Uh. Oh. H. I like her because she nice blonde hair. Or I like this one because of dark nice flowing hair. My go. That's That's what it's founded on. Oh my goodness. It's founded on because physically he looks so handsome. And my goodness, that little curl he has on his forehead. Oh, that makes my heart leap. Yeah. You build it on that. That can be worms tomorrow. Yeah, you build it on that. See, we build on these fickle, foolish nonsense of the world that's out there. Let us build our lives upon Christ, the rock foundation, the word of the living God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. Building church, family, friendship, or even with your personal life. You're going to build a life. You want to see that you have a solid path of life from beginning to end under the leadership of Jesus Christ. Then my friends, you got to let the Lord Jesus Christ be your rock foundation. And while I'm speaking to you, may the presence of Almighty God bear witness to what I'm saying here. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. You see, a rock is godmade, but a brick is man-made. I'm afraid we got a lot of bricks instead of rocks. You see a brick you can make with sand. You can make it with mud. You can make it with clay. You can make it with mud. A mixture of mud mixed with grass mixed with hay. You can make a mixture of different things. And one might be a harder kind of a brick that will last for a longer time, but it's still a mixture that you made up. A man-made mixture that you made up like that, you see? Oh, my friends. See? My goodness. You can even make better than that. You can make it a sundried brick or a fired brick that you put in an oven to make it hard hardened like that. Oh, I can even make it better than that. Mix some put some wire mesh in it. You can even reinforce it with steel bars. And my god, when that brick comes out, it's a it's a real hard solid brick and it comes out there. But let me tell you, no matter what the composition of that brick is, no matter how sophisticated the mixture of that brick is, you can use all the chemicals you want to even get a brick in the middle of winter. And no matter how sophisticated that brick is, it is still nothing but a brick. That wouldn't change that brick into a rock. The the the the brick remains a brick. Amen. So in the same way you take a man or a woman, you can pass them through the best universities, pass them through the best theological seminaries, pass them through the most rigorous training, the most uh secure training and train them to perfection. And when they come out of there, all they are is going to be nothing but a brick. You can then give them like they do for some bricks, give them, authorize them and certify this is a brick that was made in Italy. This is not no ordinary brick from China. This is a brick that will last. It will hold and it will last with whatever you have to do with it. So, we authorize it and we put a stamp on it. And there the indentation in the brick saying where it come from and how it's going to last. Uh, like that. You can certify some of these people and even give them authorized by Northwestern Bible. Uh you authorized by so and so. My when people hear that, oh, they jump back say, "Oh my goodness, that man is really something else. He's got to authorize with a BA, BD, and he's got a a MA and he's got a doctor of philosophy and a professor of this and that and you know, doctors of this and doctors of that and and call themselves professor this and and they're right in a way because they're professing to know and they don't know anything, right? It's still a man-made brick. I'm sorry, but praise the Lord. It's still a man-made brick. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. That wasn't shaped by God. &gt;&gt; That wasn't called by God. Amen. Praise God. But thank God, Jesus is still the rock in this weary land. &gt;&gt; He is still our shelter in the time of storm. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All the rest, whether they be patriarchs, whether they be prophets, whether they be apostles, or even individual believers of this unwritten word of the hour, uh you are just like Peter. We are we are little rocks, right? He says, "Your name is going to be uh Peter. You're going to be Cphus, little stone, little rock." Amen. In some culture we call it rock stone but right a rock but the difference is a rock is is when you pick it up rough but the stone is is the same rock polished over time. That is why we are just little stones because the Holy Spirit polishing us, right? Uh, I don't know about you, but he ain't finished with me yet. But he's still polishing. And to polish it, Samson says, just like how God polishes, he says, two or three stones in a brook and the water passing and they're tumbling up together. He says the face of friend sharpens the face of the other friend. It smooths out a lot of things in the life of the other person. Amen. Is that right? And it smooths us out together. That's why we are walking together as a people of God. and to the church of the living God. Amen. Somebody get mad if somebody tells them about a little flaw, a little fault or something. And there's other people which I can't stand people like that. They see you doing something wrong and they love you so much that they wouldn't tell you. It's just how you tell the person. But you you can't have your friend or your sister or your brother walking into fire and say, "Oh boy, I don't want to tell them. They'll get mad." No, you have got to tell them. &gt;&gt; You got If you The Bible tells you how to do it. He says, "Get them by themselves. Take your brother aside. Talk with them." I said, "You noticed this. I noticed you're doing that. I noticed this happening. And if you notice anything about me, tell me, too." You know, I don't mind. But that you have to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But don't become people that say, "Oh, I'm your friend." And and while you saying you're a friend, you see the person doing something wrong. You hold it in your chest and you don't say nothing and let them walk into trouble, walk into problems. Am I saying the truth now? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; And notice you're getting a little quiet. That's why I ask you. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. In the old days, I'm in the middle of preaching and the demons screaming and the door fling open and they're running out and all that stuff. Amen. You may you might be very uh you cultured to me here and just remain in your seat and just clear your throat and not say anything, but in your heart you have another thought, right? What's he talking about? Amen. Praise God. Shall we continue talking about rock? &gt;&gt; This sermon is about rocks and bricks. It's nothing mysterious. You may you go out right now and a dog attacks you and the first thing you going to do is reach for a rock or a brick or something like that. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes, sir. So, we are not uh authorized by the denominations. We have been certified by the denominations. But I can tell you, I am a certified seed of God. &gt;&gt; And I'm authorized by the Holy Spirit to preach this word of God &gt;&gt; to you who will listen and hear it and receive it within your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus, the prophets, the apostles, right on down to the bride of the seven church ages, they are not bricks. They are founded on the rock and they themselves are part of that rock. They are chips off. They are pieces from the masterpiece. They are one and the same because they are made of the same material. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Amen. Yes, sir. Praise the name of the Lord God. Amen. Revelations 2:17. He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear. Praise God. To him that overcomemeth will I give to eat of the hidden manner, and will give him a white stone, and the stone in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth, saving he that receiveth it. Oh, praise God. Hallelujah. Oh, you come with the seed already in you. Praise the name of the Lord. You come with that stone of God inside of you. And you're walking through this world in white year after year. Uh let me go back to something. When Paul says, "Work out your salvation &gt;&gt; with fear and trembling." In the old days in the preaching of the seven thunder message they were saying you got to perfect yourself and uh let the holy spirit perfect those virtues in you and later as the holy spirit real got us to realize is that when the seed of god comes in you that's a part of him it's already perfect &gt;&gt; but you the man part of it the flesh part of it don't know its name. It don't know its purpose. It hasn't become aware or conscious out of this amnesia to recognize who it is. So little by little as he reveals and makes known to you who you are, what you are, what you're supposed to do, you know it inside. Nobody outside you don't know it. You got to work it out. Your salvation got to work out until it starts showing in your whole life. &gt;&gt; Your whole being begins to reflect Christ. &gt;&gt; Manifest Christ, the unwritten word, &gt;&gt; the person of Christ. &gt;&gt; We're not not talking about the rha of the word, which is the writing part. &gt;&gt; But the spirit rides upon the word. And the spirit of God you can't see. But when the word of God is preached under inspiration, then the unseen presence of the almighty God is here with the word. Praise God. And if you're sensitive enough, you'll pick it up. If not, it'll just pass by you. That's okay. But he, the living one, is still with us. &gt;&gt; And he's with the word of God. Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Praise God. Now, I won't talk about the diamond being a rock because a lot of women have a diamond, a rock on their hands. Amen. But it's just a rock. And I won't talk about the rock beneath a rock. These are things left for you brothers that can go back in the word and pick up stuff in there. Praise the name of the Lord. But I just want to thank our heavenly father that he sent to us, Jesus Christ, to be our smitten rock. &gt;&gt; Right? that out of him will gush forth lifegiving and refreshing waters. Amen. Praise God. And we know that he came and uh uh was smitten on Calvary and and and his life's blood poured out of him. Praise God. To save this sin earth. Amen. Praise the Lord. It was poured out for everybody. But he knew that only a certain uh portion of it will receive him. And we know God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him. But he already knew there's only a certain amount of people that has that capacity to believe in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. He came for his lost sheep. He came for his own. He came for those that are of his little little flock. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And thank God you are one of them. I believe so. One in a million. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Brother Brandham said the day you got saved, a million got lost. Amen. You got saved and a million lost. Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. Okay. We going to continue on now. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's wonderful to be in the presence of God, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. Listen, while I'm preaching, you're not going to distract me. If you feel like going to the washroom, go to the washroom. If you feel like getting up uh and and walk and exercise, come back so you can remain fresh to receive everything. That's fine. Is that right? Neither am I going to stop you if the Holy Spirit hits your heart and you want to run these floors. Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. You want to shout hallelujah, shout hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't like lock jaw Christians. I always tell the story and I've told it over and over again of the farmer that walk into this church and walking barefoot with the mud all between his toes from in the field and he walk in and sit down in the front bench in the front and the preacher start to preach thank God that the Lord Jesus Christ came and died for our sins. He said, "Glory to God. Hallelujah." All the people turned around, look at him. Amen. But they continue to preach him and says, "And they took him to Calvary and nailed him to the cross. But on the third day, he rose." He says, "Glory to God." Hallelujah. Praise God. He felt two arms, two deacons, one on this side, one on the other side. They pick him up, says, "Brother, we need to go to the vest tree, not the office, the vest tree." So took they took him into the vest tree and they said, "Let's make a deal. if you come back next Sunday, we are going to provide you a pair of shoes because we notice you don't have shoes. He said, "Oh, I'm glad for these shoes. I I never really had pair of shoes." And so, well, the regular shoe can't fit him. So, they bought him sneakers, oversized sneakers, brand new. But when you come back, don't say amen. In this church, we don't say amen here and praise the Lord and all this shouting, right? Well, he wants the the sneakers so bad. He says, "Okay." Right? Next Sunday, he dress a little better than he was before. Come back next Sunday. Doesn't even know how to walk with pair of shoes. So, he's slacking with this coming up the aisle of the church. proud that he had shoes, right? Take a seat in the front. And the preacher looked at him with a light slight nod. In other words, remember we have a deal. [Laughter] And so he begins to preach again and talk about our Lord healing the sick. And he came down to the point that when and the Pharisees were against him and they hated him for delivering the people and so they conspired against him and at last after the garden of Gethsemane they imprisoned him and they took him to Calvar's hill and there they pierced him in the side to the guy. You got to say praise the Lord. He said, "Then they buried him in the tomb, but on the third day he rose again." He said, "Go." He says, "And he spent the 40 days with his disciples and talking to them." And then he ascended up. He says, "Glory to God. Sneaker or no sneakers." Praise God. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. So, I'm trying to tell you I hope none of you like that cuz I don't have any deal with you. And you don't need to hold back anything. Church is not a place for repression or oppression. It's a place for expression. &gt;&gt; Prophet said God don't like conservatives. No, I'm not talking about the political conservatives. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about conserv too conservative in nature. Uh too conservative, too private with everything else. You you need to be a open person, &gt;&gt; right? I don't mean you just go telling all your family secrets. [Laughter] Oh my goodness. I'm preaching now. Oh my goodness. Yeah. But but but to be an open-minded openhearted person, &gt;&gt; right? God, he says God likes openhearted people. Amen. That's why he love Peter. You know, he just tell what was in his mind. He just tell you off or tell you what was in his mind. He's not going to be thinking one thing and then tell you something nice on the other. No, no, no, no. He'll tell you the truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; That's why we loved our brother Peter when he was here. Praise the Lord. God bless his heart. &gt;&gt; Because he'll tell you, he say for crying out loud, that's how you going to behave or that's what you're saying. It's not that way. It's this this this this. He doesn't care whether you like him or you don't like him, he'll tell you the word. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. See, you see, but I want you to know something. Rocks are not only for foundations, &gt;&gt; but rocks are used also as anchors. &gt;&gt; You know, in the old days when they didn't have nice ski anchors, what all those big ships used to use, you know, it was rocks. They would get a big rock and tie their rope around it and that's what they would throw overboard uh to use as an anchor. Praise the name of the Lord. And I think that we as Christians not only need the rock as a foundation, but we need something that can anchor us to the word of God. &gt;&gt; We want our lives anchored to the promise of this hour. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because like I said, we living in stormy weather. We living in troublesome times. We living in perilous times. Chaos, confusion, madness, insanity is everywhere. And you need something to keep you anchored to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the devil is putting all kinds of fakes around. Fake preachers, fake churches, fake this, fake that. Everything is fake. Amen. Praise God. But God wants you to have the real and hold on to it. Amen. rocks also are used or were used as ballasts. Now you say, well, what is a ballast? I look it up and it says a ballast is something whether in electrical use, in a car or on a ship, it is something that plays a crucial role in ensuring the stability. Amen. Preventing that object from swaying, preventing it from tipping over or from going overboard. In other words, a a balance gives you balance. &gt;&gt; That's what the balance does. And a lot of Christians need balance. &gt;&gt; Is that right? A lot of preachers needs balance. &gt;&gt; A lot of churches need balance. They gone overboard on certain doctrines. &gt;&gt; Some preachers riding a certain doctrine as their hobby horse. &gt;&gt; They got a little horse riding like the like a child riding on a hobby horse and that's all they can ride is healing or miracles or tongues or or they can uh they can ride even the prophet as the as the hobby horse. Yeah. That's all they can ride. they that what else is in the word is not open up to them or they're not using it or they're not walking in it. Amen. And we can go to either extreme. Prophet said you can get in there revelation. He said you can go to to weeds on it if you go too extreme that way or go this way. You got to stay right down the middle of the road. Keep your balance &gt;&gt; on the word of God. Hallelujah. Praise God. Don't go extreme on anything, but stay in the middle of the road. Praise the Lord. Stay between the white lines. Obey all the right signs and you're going to get to heaven right on time. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. You see, when the ballast is on the ship and the ship is going back and forth in stormy weather, if you have a good ballast, even in the storm, the ship may move a little, but it's going to keep its balance and just go right through the waves. And that's what God is asking you as believers that you just don't take the word and say, "Oh, I got the word. I'm standing on the promises." Yeah, you're standing on the promises. You got the foundation. But don't sway. Don't let your mind be swayed. Oh, I I heard this preacher on TV. I was watching this on uh YouTube. Maybe I better stay home. I can listen to that or maybe I can uh there's a brother in this message that also preaching there. I better run there or I better listen to that or run over here or run over there. Well, and you're going back and forth like a chicken that lost his head. Is that right? Oh my goodness. This is not no old McDonald uh at a farm. A little peck here and a little peck there and a pec pe there and a pec here. No, no, no, no, no. We are here to stand on the word with stability, my friends. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Firmly fixed upon the rock of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And hold to God's unchanging hand. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Praise God. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord Jesus. Amen. Praise God. That is why Jesus Christ is described as our rock. He is our stabilizer. Amen. He's my anchor. &gt;&gt; He is my everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's our foundation stone. Amen. And he is the seed of God that was laid in you before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. I'm not so good with computers. I was trying to search for that coat I've presented to you all before many times and um not like before. I can remember those things and just bring them things like that say my God where did you get that? I I I can't remember but it's there in the word and if you search you you'll find it. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. So it was laid in you before the foundation of the world. The word makes you become conscious of that and then you start to work out. You're already saved. It's in there. But you got to work it out. The world don't know that you're saved. They don't world don't know that you are part of the bride. You the world don't know perfection dwells within. But you got to work out the perfection. &gt;&gt; You got to work it out. Your life will reflect what is inside of you. your character, your nature, your what you say, how you act, and what you do. Is this making sense, &gt;&gt; Steve? &gt;&gt; I don't want to become an old man and just go rambling, rambling, rambling on forever. I'm not going to keep you here. So, before you all start, old man, why don't you just forgive me, brother Chris? I just got to be myself. I can't be anybody else. Praise the name of the Lord God. Amen. The Lord's our rock &gt;&gt; and in him we hide. &gt;&gt; He's my shelter in the time of storm. &gt;&gt; Stormy weather comes. And the oak tree knows if it stands firm, it's going to become stronger after the storm is passed. I know some of you here or maybe out there in the lands out there wherever you are. You may be going through a stormy weather and a hard critical crucial time within your life, your family, your marriage, your relationship, your personal identity within your person. You may be going through that. Amen. Peter was a little stone. But listen what Paul said in first Galatians 2:9. He said, "I perceived that James, Peter, and John seem to be pillars in the church of God." And when we go to Revelation 3:12, he that overcomemeth, I will make a pillar in the temple of my God, &gt;&gt; and he shall go no more out. Hallelujah. Praise God. Be a pillar in the temple of God. I want you to know here today that uh pillars are solid and stable. Is that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Even banks when they want to tell you that your money is safe with us, they build a building and they put two, three big pillars in the front to impress you with the stability of the bank will never go bankrupt. Your money will always be here and you and always get it when you want it. Maybe but you can only get only maybe a thousand at a time. But anyway, we are stable. We're not moving. All right. Praise God. Like that. See, my friends, I want you to know that clearly. That is the way it is. Praise the Lord. That uh we are the sons and daughters of God. And we are to be God wants us to be solid. He wants us to have stable lives. Amen. Praise the name. Not running from church to church. &gt;&gt; Sunday you're in this church and the next Sunday you're in another church. You're tasting the dishes in every restaurant. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; You want to eat at this restaurant, but go and pay in the next one over across the street. Pay your tithes across the street. No. You eat at this restaurant, you pay your tithes in this restaurant that you eat. Does that sound fair? &gt;&gt; Does that sound sensible? Yes. &gt;&gt; It's simply enough for anybody to understand that you don't eat in this restaurant and then tell the owner over there, I'm going and paying next door. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. Even the police won't agree with you with that one. &gt;&gt; And that's why we as believers need to be pillars in the temple of God. &gt;&gt; I believe sister Johnson was a pillar in this temple of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I believe brother Peter, sister Sharon, there were pillars in the temple of this of God. &gt;&gt; The Ivans, brother, brother brother Tom, sister Sharon, pillars in the temple of God. You can't move them. You can't shake them. Hey, praise God. And there are believers in here that are pillars in the house of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord God. Amen. Yes, sir. Oh my. You know, there's a difference between a pillar and a post. I'm sorry. Listen, you can either be a pillar or a moving goalpost. You decide which one you're really going to be. Amen. Either a pillar or a post. The seed of God in you makes you stabilized. &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen? &gt;&gt; Praise God. It keeps you from swaying. It keeps you from the devil even swaying you. The storm can't sway you because you are founded on the rock. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. You're not going overboard on nothing. You're not going overboard on all kinds of fantastic stuff in some parts of the message. If you're a real believer, you don't drink coffee. A real believer will be a vegetarian. You're not to eat juicy beef. &gt;&gt; You're not to have all these things. You see, you can go extreme. That might be your personal choice, but you don't tell somebody else that they can't do this and they can't do that. Uh Paul tells you plainly, he says, "Nobody tells you about this moon or that moon or not eat this and not drink that." He says, he says to Peter, he says, "Peter, you know, you and I know we can eat anything we want." He said, "But for that young brother's sake, &gt;&gt; you can eat the pork, but don't eat it in front of him because he hasn't matured enough to know that eating pork or not eating pork or eating beef or it's nothing, right? God don't care about whether you eat this or you eat that is that you stay with the word." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the word will lead you and guide you &gt;&gt; for your own health. You going to decide what you want to eat and what you don't want to eat. That is your decision. Praise the name of the Lord. But just don't go off extreme. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm saying these things because I've been tested by those things through the years. Different uh believers coming with all kinds of stuff selling health foods and so on. Nothing is wrong with that, but they want to think that that is like gospel. But you stay with the word. Okay. Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. Thank God we have an anchor &gt;&gt; that will keep your soul. &gt;&gt; No matter what happens, my anchor holds and it grips the solid rock. &gt;&gt; That rock is Christ. Hallelujah. In these troubled times, this rock is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And I'm anchored to him. Amen. I anchored my soul in the heaven of rest. Amen. I'll sail the white seas no more. Thank God I'm not wandering around anymore. &gt;&gt; This is my church home. &gt;&gt; This is my church home. &gt;&gt; Praise God. The sister walked on the street. She's just passing by. All of a sudden, the Holy Spirit dropped on her and said, "There is your church home." She's never been here before, but she just the ne walk in here. Since she walked in the door, she Oh my god. Immediately I feel like I just come home. Amen. What was that? It's the living God who is alive forever more. &gt;&gt; He still leads us and guides us. And sons and daughters of God are led by the spirit of almighty God. &gt;&gt; They're not caugh caught up in forms, fashions, and systems. They're caught up in the leadership of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Thank God. I'm the ship. I I I am the I am the ship that the sea is in. You the ship that the sea is in. And I'm referring more to Jesus cross in the Sea of Galilee in the ship with the disciples. Now he's in the ship with you. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Okay. He's in the ship with you. And the storms may come into your life. Yes. bad storms and lightnings might flash and thunder roll and the sail or your sales may be ripped. Your financial conditions all kind of problems. Your husband problems, your wife problems, your children problems. And humanly speaking, you don't know what to do. You don't know where to go. It seems like your night of is filled with blackness. filled with sadness and your ship you you you believe but your ship still swaying from side to side. You you you don't know which way to turn in the blackness of the night. But I want to say here today, go wake Jesus. &gt;&gt; Go wake Jesus. Wake up that seed in you. Wake up the life of God that's in your hair today. Amen. The lion, the tribe of Judah can break every chain and set every captive free. Amen. Yes, sir. Praise God forever more. Hallelujah. Let me tell you, he still can cause that seed to speak peace to your troubled heart. &gt;&gt; Master, the tempest is raging. The billows are tossing high. The sky is overshadowed with blackness. No shelter or help is nine. Care us thou not that we perish? How can thou lie asleep? That's when people think God don't care. God is sleeping and he doesn't see my situation. My situation is so secret that he doesn't know. They forget that he is God because he knows all things and he knows your situation. It's not hidden from him. You don't have to be ashamed, embarrassed, and go hide up yourself somewhere and think that God doesn't know about you and he doesn't want to help you. Amen. He doesn't want to strengthen you. He doesn't want to bring you out of your situation. The devil wants to just separate you from your brethren because that's how these uh these lions and animals work. Once they can separate you from from the from the group, then they'll eat you up and chew you alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. But not to be around the group where the group is going to surround the sick and the weak and defend them for the glory of God. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes, sir. Oh, careest thou not that we perish. How canst thou lie asleep when each moment so madly as threatening the grave in the angry deep. The devil threatened to bury you with all kind of problems. The winds and the waves circumstances got to obey his will. The winds and the waves must obey his will. &gt;&gt; Whether the wrath of the storm or sea or demons or men or whatever it be, no waters can swallow the ship where lies the master of ocean and earth and skies. They all shall sweetly obey thy will. Peace be still. Peace be still. They all shall sweetly obey thy will. Peace. Peace be still. Yes, Jesus is our rock. &gt;&gt; He was a rock with David when he was being hunted. When Saul was after him, he was David's rock. David hid in the rock in a cave in the rock. He was David's rock when Goliath come against David and against the people of Israel. And he placed his hands in the brook and randomly he thought picked up a stone. And with that stone from the brook, he was able to slay Goliath. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, Jesus Christ is the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; And he came down from glory to confront the Goliath of the ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. And in that contest up there in Gethsemane and on Gat's hill, Amen. Jesus Christ through the stone, the revelation of the word. I know who I am. &gt;&gt; I and my father are one. &gt;&gt; Though you slay this body and lay it in the tomb. Amen. I'll raise it up. I will raise it up in three days. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know who I am. Yes. &gt;&gt; Defeated the devil and the contest on Golgata's hill. Amen. Praise God. In David's situation, one stone changed the history of Israel. &gt;&gt; In the history of the church, one rock changed the history of the whole church. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is the rock. &gt;&gt; And that's why we have now AD, BC, and AD. The whole history changed. &gt;&gt; Now his he's written all over it whether they like it or not. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God. But it didn't end there. God sent a seventh angel through this seventh angel of the seven church ages. Brother William Marian Branham, &gt;&gt; the true prophet of the 20th century. And I say true prophet because many claim they are prophets. But there's only one true prophet &gt;&gt; of the 20th century and he was, you know, I found some old photographs. I was going through them and I found one where the bed that brother Brennham slept in the house, brother Ernie Fandler. And I didn't know that I was sleeping on the same bed until brother Fandler told me. But there it was, just a simple ordinary bed. And when the clothes that were in the closet, simple ordinary, he was a small man, a small stature, a man of small stature, but he had the rock revelation of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Like no man ever had. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, the first time I heard it, brother, sister, I couldn't sleep because there's something going on in me that tells me that's right. That's the truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. And he took that rock revelation of the word of God. You know, I'm saying these things like that, but you got to understand, nobody ever saw this before. And all of a sudden, these things start revealing to you. You got no doctor so and so. This person you can go refer to to confirm your stuff to say, "Okay, now I know it's right." You you just have the word and that prophet had to have faith revelation to believe that this was God speaking to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he held it until it's blossom and bloomed until it is what it is here today. Covering every nation under the sun, every tribe and every person everywhere. It's gone all over the world. &gt;&gt; They thought they could stomp it out. thought they could destroy it. They thought that they'll pour water on the fire by blackening his name, destroying him. But he said it long after I'm gone. And though I lay in the grave, he says they're going to recognize the things that I have said are thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Everyone will come to pass. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. He says, "Let them come and show me where anything fails. Let him show." Not one, nohere. Amen. He took the rock relation that word and faced off. I got five minutes more and I'm going to squeeze this mango until I get all the juice out of it. Right? So, just relax. I'm You're going to leave here on time, but I have to get in to talk to you here. Praise the Lord. Amen. He took the rock revelation of the word that God had revealed to him and faced the Goliaths of denominational systems out there, all the religious organizations of the day. And by God's grace and with his supernatural power, he slew them everyone. &gt;&gt; And right now, they're running around not knowing they lost their head. He's already chopped it off. They lost their headship which is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; They're calling his name. They're writing books. They're making records. They're doing all kinds of but they lost their head. &gt;&gt; The sword of the word has taken their heads off already. &gt;&gt; Amen. You said he that she he she's dead while she is still alive. She's dead while she live. That's that's them right. They're walking around still around like if they're living but they're really dead. Look around you. Go into them. Visit some of them. Oh, lots of shouting. Lots of jumping up. Lots of screaming and shouting. That's not life. That's just a snake with his head chopped off and his body is just keeping a whole lot of going around and not producing any life. That's not life. Amen. The life is Christ in you working himself on the outside. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. But now is our time. We are the part of the bride that we are the rare guards of the Lord's host and we are here confronting the god of this evil age in the name of Jesus Christ in a form of a religious system. It's a giant. We're facing another giant here. And this giant we are facing is steeped in witchcraft. Amen. Praying to the dead. steeped in all kind of hedaism and and it's Christianity once again versus paganism. So we are engaged in a contest. We are about to carry on this contest and to end bring to an end the greatest battle ever fought the end of the church ages. So we need the kind of preaching and teaching that is not just going to preach, let me say even preach the Bible, but God wants the preaching that will drill down to the bedrock. &gt;&gt; So that you can lay foundations for the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, I notice a lot of brothers, they're preaching the word next level. They're preaching even the message. and preaching a message in a way that they're giving a lot of information and sure you get enlightened with information but we are in this stage now we have heard we have recognized now it's time for the applying of the token &gt;&gt; that the in other words the word I preach must relate to you &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; so when I step off of here what you going to do about How you going to live? What you going to do? Amen. How you going to walk? You going to go out the same way you came in? &gt;&gt; You're going to think the same way you used to think? No. It must transform you. &gt;&gt; It must change your way of living, your way of thinking. &gt;&gt; Must make you want to do something. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. Praise God. So, it's the age of the application of the token. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, we are not here to impress one another with our knowledge of the message. &gt;&gt; We are not here to to to show you how shiny my sword is because I polished it up last night. &gt;&gt; You know, we we we we don't have, you know, these soldiers, brother uh Henry told me, they polish up all the brass buttons and everything else and polish up the rifle and oil it up. And so, when the battle start, they're the first one to throw down the gun and run. And the ones they thought were cowards and were just hanging on, those are the guys. They don't want to die and I am not going to die first. You going to have to die. So, and they end up becoming the heroes. Amen. God has stood their ground. Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. So, we need preaching that will drill down to the bedrock. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. and take the word to the people's lives. Amen. Yes, sir. What how am I doing to the marriage? What am I going to do with just uh the lamb and the dove? And the dove, the Holy Spirit came down on the lamb and the lamb. But you see you have to take that truth and apply it to the person's life &gt;&gt; or else the truth only gonna remain in their head &gt;&gt; and it will remain even in their heart but they won't know what to do about it. So every time you will notice every time I make a point or a position here then I will uh say but the what the Lord is showing is that you are the pillars. It's not that we preaching but pillars in the word of God here it's you have to be stable. You got to have a stable life. You don't have to have a a flighty mind as they call you a flighty person. No but a mind of heart that is stable. You're founded on the rock. &gt;&gt; Uh you're you're a man, not a mango. &gt;&gt; In other words, a breeze blow and a mango fall until it drop. Right? You're a woman. You're not just a a leaf in the wind, but you're holding to God's unchanging hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, 1 Samuel Samuel said, "There is no rock like our God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Why did he say that? Because water comes from this rock and because oil comes out of this rock. Because honey comes out of this rock. Praise God. We need a rock like this. &gt;&gt; I need a rock to give me oil for light so I can light my lamps. Amen. Praise the Lord. I need water to quench my thirst. Amen. And we human beings, we got to thirst. We need the light of the Holy Spirit. We need heavenly sunshine like Paul had. Amen. To shine upon us for the glory of God. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes, sir. And further than that, thank God for this rock. We can stand on the rock because he said, "Moses, that rock there, go stand on the rock." When you really stand on this rock, you'll see the glory of God. &gt;&gt; You'll see the glory of God if you're really standing on the rock. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I hope what you're standing on is not a brick, but you're standing on the rock. Amen. So let me encourage you today to press on because what God wants you to be a pillar. Do you want to be a pillar in the house of God? &gt;&gt; God wants you to be a pillar. Amen. See a rock or a stone. It speaks of permanence. It speaks of stability. It talks about steadiness. Men and women that are steady. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. even young people, steady children that you can rely on because that's what the rock is speaking of. It's it's uh it's portraying the fact that it's stable. It's steady. It's the rock of ages. It's not moving. It's it has its way that it's going to live. And this is the way I'm going to live. And I live by the word of God and by God's unchanging hand. Amen. Praise God. So God wants you to be and I'm winding up to close now. God wants you then to be a rock in your home. He wants you to be the stable person in your home. It don't matter your husband, your wife, the way they're that way. You be the rock in that home. You be like the pillar in that relationship. Be the permanent balanced in that friendship. No matter how it go back and forth, go back and forth, you hold to God's unchanging hand. &gt;&gt; You're steady in one direction. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord God. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. I want you to see that clearly. God wants you to be the rock not only in your home, &gt;&gt; but he wants you to be a rock in your neighborhood. Praise the Lord. Sister Johnson was a rock in her neighborhood. She never come to church in her vehicle alone. You hear what I said? She never come to church in her vehicle alone. So what do you mean? Because she always coming with somebody with her. Sometimes her van is filled with people who never came before. because she's talking about the Lord, sharing the grace of God, sharing &gt;&gt; what God give to her, neighbors, friends. Praise the Lord. Her daughter's right here. She knows I'm telling the truth. Wherever she's coming, but now it's become, you know, standard and satisfactory for some of us. Uh, make sure I get myself to church. Yeah, that's yourself. But think of it. God wants to use you more than that. Amen. God wants to use you and God and you got to make yourself available for him to use you &gt;&gt; for his glory and for his honor. How's he going to show his glory? Give God the chance to work a miracle. &gt;&gt; So you provide the environment, the atmosphere. Praise God. And God will do it for his glory and honor. He wants you young people to be the rock in your school. In this generation where young people are swayed back and forth, drugs, drink, sexology, and madness in the schools, even what they're teaching in the curriculums, not based on the word of God. God wants you to be a rock &gt;&gt; in your school &gt;&gt; in right there. Hallelujah. Doesn't mean you're going to walk up and be confronting the teacher and this and that, but you don't move off of what you believe. &gt;&gt; Don't move from your foundation. Stay with the word of God. I'm hearing what you say. &gt;&gt; Just like I'm here. When I go out, I hear people cursing. What? Brother Simon, you you hear people cursing? Yes, I do. My ears are not so clean that I don't hear. or I'm not so Christian that I'm gonna do like it's there. You go on the bus, you hear it all around you. Listen, the the world is weary. It's tired. It's going and it's all around you. You're you're surrounded by darkness and it's all around you. But in the middle of it, Amen. Praise God. The ship can be in the sea, but the problem is if that ship allow the sea to get inside the ship. &gt;&gt; Yes. then the ship has trouble. &gt;&gt; It's the same with the believer. You be in the world but not of the world and don't let the world permeator come into your life. &gt;&gt; You hold to the word of the living God. And even in the school, be a rock on your job. Be a rock. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Now, quickly, I know I'm going over a little time. Just give me the time. Let me finish here. Um, I went to the Home Depot. I wanted to buy a certain thing and when I tried to buy it, it didn't have another part. And the guy that was selling me said, "Ah, that part is they have the part over here. I can I can give you one of those and you can just take it and go out with it." And I said, "No, I I don't do that. I can't do that." He He says, "No." Oh, he smiled and he says, "No, no, no." He says, "No, okay." He take the part he gave me. He wrote a note and put his name on it. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Walk up to the counter and give this to them." I walk up, of course, they checked it out. When I go out, his name is Dave. Let me not say it. I go to say the rest of it. He gave me his old name. And then when I walk out, I realize, oh my goodness, that is my old supervisor. When I was working in construction, there was all kind of gravel. There was all kinds of wood and all kinds of stuff. And certain men would fill up their truck and they gone home with it. And one day saying to me, you know, you can take some of this and you can you can take it home with you. I said, no, I don't do that. I don't care whether the boss sees me, the boss knows, or the boss don't know. God knows, and I know, and I'm not taking anything. That was the same person that was testing me again there by saying you can take this part you know and then when he sign his name and give me the thing and I go out he's smiling you know he thought maybe I would remember but I didn't remember until I leave then I realized oh my goodness it's the same thing but you it means you're permanent you haven't changed &gt;&gt; many years pass still the same principle founded on the rock, founded on the word. Amen. And that's what God wants all of us to be, founded upon the word of God. Hallelujah. If you're found in a wilderness situation, between a rock and a hard place, maybe you're like Jacob and it's so hard you got to make a pillow. Your pillow got to be a stone. In other words, you lay your head on your pillow, you can't sleep because it's so hard. Things are so tough that you can't sleep. Whatever you're in a sour, bitter battle, in a marriage or in a relationship situation, no matter how hard or how difficult it is, you can still find there is honey in the rock. You might find yourself again like Jacob having sleepless nights and you got to lay down yourself on that pillow. Symbol of lay down your five senses on the stone. Lay on the rock. Take your five senses and lay it on the word. Trust the promise. Put your faith in that &gt;&gt; and you're going to start dreaming dreams. You're going to see visions and God will tell you what to do. &gt;&gt; He'll lead you and guide you and bring you out of your wilderness situation that you are in by his mighty hand. Redemption by blood and by power. He'll bring you out. Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. And then you'll find rest in Christ. And some of you may have recently come to Christ. You've been baptized and while you're on the rock, you're standing on the rock. But you know, when I was a boy, we go swimming in the creek or in the river and there's big rocks in the river. You stand on it, but you know, you got some green moss on that rock. And sometimes you're on the rock and your foot still slip. The devil going to want to tell you now you're lost. Now you're backslid. But what he forget is though you slip. You're still on the rock. You still believe the word. You're not going nowhere. You're still on that rock. The rock hasn't moved. It's your foot slip. Praise God. Brother, sister, even though you have slipped. Even though you have made mistakes, you're still on the rock. &gt;&gt; You're still on the word. Amen. Doesn't matter how whatever it is, he's going to shame you in your mind. He's going to embarrass you in your mind and and everything else until you don't even want to come and fellowship. You don't even want to come and meet the brethren or anything of that nature. Amen. Praise God. But I tell you in the words of the prophet, no matter what the devil tells you, tells you that you're a loser. Amen. He says, "Rise and try again. &gt;&gt; Don't give up. rise and try again. Hallelujah. They try to tell you you failed in your marriage. You failed in your relationship with your girlfriend or your boyfriend. You failed. That's why he going to be speaking to you and telling you that you failed like that. You failed with your children. Devil going to come and play on your mind and tell you you're a failure, right? Am I talking to you now? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the name. Yes. He's going to want to tell you that you're a failure with your children. Then he's going to tell you on your job. Oh my goodness. That foreman don't like you. You must be a failure. Right? It's got nothing to do with that. The devil in the foreman or the supervisor is always going to want to attack the believer. &gt;&gt; It's not the foreman. It's not the supervisor. It's the devil after you. &gt;&gt; So, so leave the man alone. He got his own problems he have to deal with. Amen. I tell you, I want you to know that that you they're going to tell you you're no good. But remember, rise and try again. &gt;&gt; Because in Christ, you're not a loser. &gt;&gt; You're a winner. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; With God's help, I can and I will. Praise God. Hallelujah. Let's give God praise and honor and glory here today. Musicians come. We're going to sing a beautiful uh song here all together bringing glory to the name of the Lord. And media people are going to put that up there while we give praise and honor to God. Would you join me in us giving praise to God? Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you're singing to God, you're not just singing a song. Sometimes the song is a prayer. Sometimes in the song, you're telling God your story and asking him for his help. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Never mind what it means to everybody else. What it mean to me when I sing it. I know how I'm feeling and what is talking to me. Praise the name of the Lord. So you let the word of God come to your life. Praise the name of the Lord. Come, brother Mike. Brother Mike, the sweet singer of Good Neighbor Ministries, is going to lead us in this song.

I'm going to ask uh peace to come and she's going to read our purpose and vision statement. And then we have an announcement afterwards. A quick announcement. Maybe not so quick, but it won't be long, but uh we'll see. This is Peace, by the way, for those of you who don't know her. Brother Tomb Bay's daughter. God bless her. Our purpose is to bring Jesus is to bring people to Jesus for membership in his family growing them into maturity equip equipping them for ministry to fulfill their life's purpose of glorifying God. Our vision is to be a life-changing ministry transforming the world one person at a time. We are changing lives forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] Okay. So, we just have a a quick announcement. Um, it is what's the date today? 10th. Today, 10th. 11th. &gt;&gt; 10th. It is 10th. Okay. So, uh not next week and not the week after, but the week after that, I believe, is uh a big weekend. Anybody know what's going on? Sister Vanessa loves that one. everybody big weekend. Um it's our uh youth week uh youth meetings coming up on that weekend on the Friday, the Saturday and the Sunday. And we just uh wanted to make you aware, give you plenty of time to uh think about it and to um uh think about your part to play in that those meetings. All right. So on the back uh bulletin board is our signup sheets because uh we need a lot of help, but we need help with people who want to help, right? So I hope you all want to help and you all have a good attitude and everybody is feeling good about helping out that weekend. We want to support the young people. We know we have probably um 60 or so coming, young people that we know of that'll be here that weekend, but we want to uh support the meetings, right? We want this church uh to definitely be here. Uh that's that's the number one way you can support is be here. You can have 50 or 60 young people here, but we want to pack out the church supporting them with singing, with specials, with with everything, right? And there'll be brother brother Kadri Digs will be back for that weekend. All right. And uh so the Friday night service will be here at 7:00. We'll have a Saturday morning service at 11:00. We'll have a Saturday evening service and a Sunday morning service. You've been through it before. It's been a great weekend. Uh everybody's exhausted by the end of it. But that's okay. We're supposed to be exhausted by the end of it. Right, Brother David? If you're not exhausted, then you need to do anything. So, here's what we're going we need from you. Uh we need you to sign up for uh there's a there's it's very detailed out there. Michelle's done a good job with detailing it. She has the Friday night service. She has sign up for uh food. All right. And the Friday night is easy stuff. All we need is what's on the on the machine, right? Same with the Saturday morning. Easy stuff. Saturday night, easy stuff. Sunday morning, big time. All right. Sunday afternoon, we're going to have big time potluck dinner. It's only us that are supplying the food, and we got to we got to go crazy with food. All right. So, uh, look at those sheets and sign up um on there for that. Plus, we need volunteers. All right. Um, and the volunteers are all broken down into sections. You don't got to do everything, but we need people who are are are in the kitchen uh preparing the food. We need runners to go out and bring it all out. We need uh a cleanup crew outside. We need a different cleanup crew on the inside, right? So, not one person or two people doing everything, but spread it all out amongst us. Easy peasy, right? So, you can sign up uh for that as well. The other thing I would like to uh mention is these are young people's services, right? I do not believe that there's anybody in here who've been to more young people's services than me. There's not. I've been to more young people services. I didn't go to one as a young person, but as an older person, I've been to all all kinds of them. And not once did I not get blessed. Not once did the preaching not speak to me. Okay. So, don't be thinking, "Oh, I'm going to come to young people." No, no, no, no, no. God is God and God will speak and God will do everything and it's fantastic. Some people know that already. So, I encourage you, be here, support the people and uh uh young people. And we and in in in doing that just also keep in mind that because we're going to have a bunch of young people coming, we we don't necessarily want the young people after the service to be tied up in doing everything. All right? Uh we'd like to be a little bit more free and that they can fellowship with the other young people and kind of be hosts to the other young people. So don't get it in your mind, oh the young people got to help. Well, the young people will help, but we also want to have them free. Does that make sense? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It does, right? Okay. So, let's let's uh think about all that. So, we really need your help in all kinds of ways. And uh you know, the last time brother Cadri was here, I mean, last year was great. Two years ago, brother Cadri was here. Do you remember anybody remember those meetings? Unfor you can't forget about them, can you? Especially if you're here on a Saturday night. It was something else. Uh, brother Kadri called it history, history in the making. And it was. So, are you prepared? You got three weeks to get prepared, brother, sister. And, uh, there's a lot of work that's being done in the background already. We're going to have tents outside. We're going to have barbecue on the Saturday afternoon only uh, for the young people. And you'll hear more about it as the pastor gets back and and and the brothers announce it and whatnot. All right. Sound good? Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. God bless you all. Hope you had a a good uh feast today in the word and uh may the Lord give you a great Sunday afternoon. Let's stand. We'll ask one of the brothers, Brother Chris, come and and and close us in prayer. Brother Chris is just back and then he's leaving again and we won't see him for a couple of months, but we're sorry about that, but we also wish him a good uh vacation. All right. So, God bless you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's give the Lord a round of praise today. [Applause] Let's thank the Lord for the word and for Pastor Simon. Amen. Just unveiling it and breaking it down to us. Amen. Let us just bow our hearts as we dismiss gracious dear loving God and heavenly father. We just thank you Lord for your word today and for your presence Lord visiting your children and breaking the bread of life to us that you we will be nourished and encouraged as we walk along life's narrow way Lord Father continue Lord to be with us Lord as we go Lord Lord as we dismiss not from your presence but may your presence go with us let us have a blessed evening together Lord Father just fellowship worshippping one with the other Lord in every way Lord that you see fit Lord we thank you Lord for even for the visitors amongst us Lord Father just continue to be with each and every one of us Lord Father as we dismissed in your precious holy name amen and amen [Music] sweeping over all the Heat.
