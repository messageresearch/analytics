[1:43] and thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[1:46] with all my heart with all my soul with
[1:52] all thy mind and with all my strength
[1:57] this is the first commandment as we go
[2:01] to Hebrews 4:12 I don't know what's left
[2:07] for yourself because the scripture says
[2:11] with all of thy heart with all thy soul
[2:16] with all thy mind all thy strength there
[2:19] is nothing left to love anything else
[2:23] but the Lord I'm not amen for the word
[2:28] of God is quick and powerful and sharper
[2:31] than any two-edged sword piercing even
[2:35] the dividing asunder of soul and spirits
[2:39] and the joints and the marrow and is a
[2:43] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[2:46] the heart
[2:47] neither is there any creature that is
[2:50] not manifest in his sight but all things
[2:55] not some of things but all things are
[2:59] naked and open unto his eyes to the eyes
[3:03] of him who with whom we have to do see
[3:09] them that we have a great high priest
[3:12] that has passed into the heavens Jesus
[3:15] the Son of God let us hold fast our
[3:19] profession for we have not a high priest
[3:23] which cannot be
[3:25] by the feeling of our infirmities but in
[3:27] all the points not some points but all
[3:30] place tempted like as we are yet without
[3:36] sin
[3:38] we sin but him is without sin and that's
[3:44] what we put our faith in in him
[3:48] our confidence in him he's our sacrifice
[3:54] he took our place and he must take our
[3:58] lease this morning in our lives

[4:07] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[4:10] and find grace to help at the time of
