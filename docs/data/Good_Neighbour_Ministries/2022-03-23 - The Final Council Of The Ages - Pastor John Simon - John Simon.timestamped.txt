[23:02] [Music]
[23:14] amen praise god
[23:17] it's a great privilege to be here
[23:19] tonight
[23:20] god bless every one of you please be
[23:22] seated we thank god for you amen i'm
[23:26] glad that you you all made it back
[23:28] i praise god a little earlier it's
[23:31] really windy tonight isn't that right
[23:34] really windy and rainy so i'm thankful
[23:37] to those of you who are here i thought
[23:39] i'd be here preaching to maybe the
[23:42] people on the band you know brother
[23:44] danny and a couple of others
[23:46] and uh
[23:48] but thank god for you that are here amen
[23:51] and that's the whole thing people don't
[23:53] understand the church is going through a
[23:55] process of the shakedown now god says i
[23:57] shake the heavens i'm going to shake the
[23:59] earth and
[24:00] you know the farmer collects the grain
[24:03] he puts it in the in the thing and then
[24:05] he shakes it so that it could come down
[24:08] and level to where he wants it to level
[24:10] and that's going on in the church now
[24:13] and uh sometimes you're surprised that
[24:17] some people get shaken or they're
[24:19] shaking out
[24:20] but we just surrender to god's will
[24:24] praise god but i'm happy that i can be
[24:26] here in the house of the lord and as
[24:30] someone was saying here tonight it's a
[24:32] greater battle in this hour that we are
[24:35] in
[24:37] we are fighting more devils than we ever
[24:40] fought before
[24:41] all around us we are surrounded by
[24:44] chaos a corruption
[24:47] we are surrounded by every
[24:49] devil you can describe that satan the
[24:52] pits of hell are open
[24:55] and the devil is flying around
[24:57] everywhere
[24:59] let me tell you i i'm saying that
[25:02] because i i can feel the increase
[25:06] of his evil suggestions to my mind
[25:10] it's more than it was before
[25:12] and they're coming to your mind
[25:14] because there's a lot more things out
[25:16] there for you to see and hear that never
[25:18] existed before but they're there now and
[25:21] you can't avoid them
[25:23] and he's trying to pull you into his
[25:26] system of living
[25:28] and his way of living
[25:31] and
[25:32] you just gotta watch yourself
[25:35] ask god for grace we know the
[25:38] elect is gonna make it through
[25:41] but that doesn't mean as i've always
[25:43] said that we lay down and die
[25:45] or we lay down like dead logs and and
[25:48] float on the on down the stream of time
[25:51] and say well god is gonna take care of
[25:53] me my you're gonna bump into a whole lot
[25:56] of things on the edges of the river
[25:57] before you get down and you may even hit
[26:00] some rapids but the thing is we've got
[26:02] to do our best right
[26:04] don't don't try to be somebody else just
[26:07] be yourself
[26:09] be yourself be your best self that's all
[26:11] you can do right praise god and i'll
[26:15] tell you right now even when
[26:18] i make mistakes or anything you know but
[26:21] of course i go to the lord and say lord
[26:23] i'm sorry shouldn't have said that i
[26:25] shouldn't have done that but the point
[26:27] is uh
[26:29] even in your flawed state
[26:32] even in your condition
[26:34] that because none of us here is thinking
[26:36] that we are perfect
[26:38] let me get that straight first well we
[26:40] all know
[26:42] that uh even though that nobody else
[26:45] outside of this vessel
[26:47] right will know it
[26:49] you
[26:50] in your soul and in your spirit on the
[26:52] inside talking to yourself you know it
[26:56] and uh once you know it that's what god
[26:59] wants as long as you know it and he
[27:01] knows it that that's good but the point
[27:03] is that you can come to him and said
[27:05] lord
[27:06] this is all i have to offer
[27:09] this is the vessel
[27:10] that you you place here with a purpose
[27:13] with a plan
[27:14] and eve even even my mistakes or your
[27:18] mistakes it's all in god's mind already
[27:21] you can't make a move you can't do
[27:24] anything you can't spit on the ground
[27:26] without him knowing you can't do nothing
[27:29] without him knowing so don't worry about
[27:32] anything just go about your life go
[27:35] about your business
[27:37] praise god uh when this message began to
[27:40] break and i began to understand more and
[27:43] more the concept of the liberty that is
[27:45] in christ
[27:46] oh my goodness friends
[27:49] no more works
[27:51] praise god
[27:52] like for instance here tonight
[27:55] you're not here tonight because of
[27:57] obligation
[27:59] at this point on stage in the message
[28:01] you're not here because of conduct an
[28:04] order
[28:05] and doctrine
[28:06] even though it's the truth
[28:08] but you are here because something
[28:10] within your own heart
[28:13] has moved you
[28:15] uh and caused you to want or desire to
[28:18] be here in the house of god
[28:21] praise the lord because it's all right
[28:24] we can turn this into an internet
[28:26] service
[28:27] uh you know it's easy we can go online
[28:29] and make it an internet service praise
[28:31] the lord and
[28:33] that'll be nice you can be in your home
[28:36] and on a cold night like this you'll not
[28:38] have a hot chocolate and
[28:43] no but i'm telling you the truth
[28:45] you mightn't say that but that's what
[28:47] you would do praise god they got
[28:50] chocolate and you sit there in the
[28:52] comfort to your home the warped you know
[28:54] of your home and you watch the sermon
[28:57] praise the lord and that's fine
[28:59] but
[29:00] there's has to be a reason
[29:03] why god said forsake not
[29:06] the assembling
[29:07] of yourselves together
[29:09] as the manner of years
[29:13] because this age was coming
[29:16] these challenges were coming
[29:20] all these things god already knew it and
[29:23] fellowship doesn't come from people uh
[29:27] talking at a long table like this
[29:29] building and i'm at one end and you're
[29:31] in the other end uh that's not really
[29:34] fellowship
[29:36] but god is saying you have to come
[29:38] together and the word assemble
[29:41] yourselves together right which means
[29:44] you got to come uh
[29:46] in close contact with each other talk
[29:48] with one another and have a great time
[29:52] in the presence of the lord hallelujah
[29:54] of course he's talking about you copying
[29:57] what he would do or what he has done
[29:59] with his people right so that's all we
[30:02] do is come together and you'll find when
[30:05] you come together with like saints of
[30:08] like precious faith revelation
[30:11] and you begin to talk the word of god
[30:14] uh
[30:14] the great magnet begins to come down
[30:18] and before you know it
[30:20] you you break into eternity you start
[30:22] lose sense of time
[30:24] you you start losing sense of time right
[30:27] it's not just talk it's actual fact you
[30:29] lose the sense of time and for oh my
[30:32] goodness you mean uh two hours gone
[30:37] yeah but that's the way it is now
[30:40] friends
[30:41] and uh i thank the lord for it
[30:44] but i know
[30:46] that the um whole thing like any person
[30:51] that's cooking knows that the the meal
[30:54] or the the food that you're cooking
[30:56] doesn't remain heaped up in the pan like
[30:59] that with the heat and the pressures and
[31:02] everything else it starts going down
[31:05] it starts going down is that right
[31:07] praise the lord hallelujah
[31:10] well tonight
[31:11] you know we spoken
[31:14] a lot of people wanting to diagnose
[31:16] themselves and the problems that they
[31:18] have physically is that right
[31:21] and then you have a lot of pseudo
[31:22] doctors with the electric oil sales men
[31:25] and women that will come and advise you
[31:28] to drink this or drink that or drink the
[31:30] other eat this eat that or rub yourself
[31:34] with such-and-such or you better know
[31:36] who you're taking your advice from
[31:40] you better know
[31:41] you know because
[31:43] it's very important because this is one
[31:45] fellow i'm just talking with you there's
[31:47] one fellow i know
[31:49] he he was he went into the jungle
[31:51] several times
[31:53] uh prospecting for gold and
[31:56] he he was successful a couple of times
[32:00] and so
[32:01] he took his younger brother with him
[32:03] this next time and a younger brother
[32:05] happened to be a member of the church
[32:08] in guyana south america
[32:10] and so he took him with him and as they
[32:13] were going through the jungle um
[32:16] you know it's very hot in under the
[32:19] canopy of those trees it's not cool
[32:21] because the leaves literally come
[32:23] together and block out the sun and it's
[32:26] dark on them there there almost as night
[32:29] except when you come to a spot where
[32:31] some sunlight might come true
[32:33] and so it's hot
[32:36] and you're perspiring and walking and
[32:39] trekking and he got hot oh my goodness
[32:41] i'm thirsty and we run out of water
[32:43] where are we going to get water from
[32:45] this brothers
[32:47] he said
[32:48] i know you have never come through the
[32:50] jungle before but let me show you
[32:52] something you need to have some of this
[32:55] and he just walked to a vine took his
[32:58] knife
[33:00] cut it immediately water
[33:03] was in that vine
[33:05] and the brothers stand back because
[33:07] you've never seen it before you drink
[33:09] you go ahead any drink you know track is
[33:12] filled because you know the vines on the
[33:15] trees catch the
[33:17] the rain when it falls then allowing it
[33:20] to come down to the rest of the plants
[33:22] they catch it and store it up there and
[33:24] everything else so it collects in some
[33:26] of these vines and he knew which one to
[33:28] cut and he drank from it
[33:31] however
[33:32] you got to be careful
[33:34] if it's caught in the vine and it's
[33:36] fresh and you drink it it's no problem
[33:39] but if it's been in the vine for a
[33:42] couple of days or weeks he drank it he
[33:46] was running to the bathroom as often as
[33:49] you can think
[33:52] so you see you got to be careful whose
[33:54] advice you take
[33:56] and who you listen to and don't just
[33:58] have some self-diagnosis or diagnosis
[34:01] from somebody that's not a real doctor
[34:04] but a pseudo scientist
[34:07] like that right
[34:09] and uh once you have uh come to the
[34:12] place that that's it i'm not worried
[34:14] about all these self-diagnosis i need to
[34:17] have a real doctor well this is we spoke
[34:20] on the next topic of
[34:22] god's diagnosis because you may have
[34:24] your point of view but what is god's
[34:26] point of view
[34:27] you may have your idea but what's god's
[34:29] thoughts about it
[34:31] uh so god we spoke about that and god
[34:34] gave his thoughts about this as we spoke
[34:37] uh last week
[34:39] praise god and now we are here
[34:42] to
[34:43] talk about the final
[34:45] counsel of the ages
[34:48] because we are coming down to the
[34:51] ending of the gentile dispensation
[34:55] we're coming to the ending of uh my
[34:58] friends the close of these church ages
[35:01] we're coming to the end
[35:03] of the
[35:05] even western civilization it's going
[35:07] back east the sun is going back to the
[35:11] jews and it's leaving the gentiles to
[35:14] return back to the jews
[35:16] we must be aware of that and we prepared
[35:19] for it
[35:20] so now we are here receiving
[35:23] or to receive
[35:25] god's
[35:26] advice
[35:27] god's counsel
[35:29] and our scripture tonight is found in
[35:31] revelation chapter 3
[35:34] verses 18 to 19.
[35:39] i counseled thee
[35:42] to buy of me
[35:44] gold
[35:45] tried in the fire
[35:48] that thou mayest be rich
[35:52] and white raiment
[35:55] that thou mayest be clothed
[35:59] and that the shame of thy nakedness
[36:03] do not appear
[36:05] and anoint thine eyes with eyes off
[36:09] that thou may see
[36:12] as many as i love
[36:15] i rebuke and chase him
[36:18] be zealous therefore
[36:20] and repent
[36:22] amen father we just ask for you to stop
[36:26] a while and visit with us and just talk
[36:29] with us
[36:30] as we come together like this
[36:32] and to thee
[36:34] be all the glory father
[36:36] may the holy spirit of the living god
[36:40] witness to us
[36:42] and warm our hearts by the fires of the
[36:45] word to your glory and
[36:47] praise and honor
[36:49] in jesus name amen
[36:54] the scripture
[36:55] gets right to the point look you can be
[36:57] seated please be seated
[37:00] god says i counseled thee
[37:03] i counseled thee
[37:06] uh now um
[37:08] you know
[37:10] what what is it to counsel is to advice
[37:13] right if you're gonna counsel somebody
[37:15] it means you're gonna advise
[37:18] and god says i counseled thee
[37:21] the body
[37:23] of me
[37:24] uh more
[37:26] formally
[37:27] when you use the word counsel you're
[37:29] really speaking about the lawyer
[37:32] right
[37:33] you're talking about a lawyer usually in
[37:35] the courts they will say the judge will
[37:37] even say counselor counselor right so
[37:40] because he's an advocate right he's an
[37:43] advocate that is rise the titles of
[37:46] jesus christ would you'll find uh titles
[37:49] like that are advocate our consular
[37:54] i think it's isaiah 9
[37:56] somewhere in there 9 6 where he says his
[38:00] name shall be called wonderful consular
[38:04] amen remember are greater than solomon
[38:07] is here
[38:08] and solomon's wisdom could not compare
[38:12] with him
[38:14] and his name shall be called counselor
[38:18] amen
[38:19] and now
[38:20] this great counselor
[38:23] is telling the people come to me for
[38:26] your counsel
[38:28] get your advice from me
[38:31] don't go off somewhere else looking for
[38:33] advice because
[38:35] there is no one wiser there is no one
[38:38] that has more wisdom matter of fact
[38:41] in the book of isaiah he says all your
[38:44] kings and your counselors together if
[38:47] you were put to put them in a bucket he
[38:50] said they are just like a drop of water
[38:54] in a bucket to me they are nothing their
[38:56] wisdom can't compare him with his wisdom
[39:00] for he is the mighty
[39:02] counselor amen praise god hallelujah so
[39:08] he directs the church to himself
[39:11] he's saying your only hope to get out of
[39:14] this dilemma that you're in this
[39:16] religious dilemma
[39:17] is to come to me for counsel
[39:20] so you can get out of this dilemma
[39:23] right i am in other words i am your only
[39:26] hope
[39:28] there's no one wiser there's no other
[39:30] specialist no other doctor nobody else
[39:34] that can get you out of this dilemma
[39:38] that you are in and therefore your hope
[39:42] is in me amen praise god so he says come
[39:47] to me and by
[39:49] come to me and by praise god god calling
[39:54] them pointing them to himself hallelujah
[39:58] but sad to say
[40:01] we are witnesses to it because we are
[40:03] living now in this laodicean church age
[40:06] and the
[40:07] the nominal church is not coming to him
[40:11] to buy uh oil or buy gold or buy
[40:16] precious the precious things of
[40:18] spiritual life you're not coming to him
[40:21] to buy by
[40:23] uh they're not coming to him for the
[40:26] real as i quote from the church age book
[40:30] they're not coming to buy god's
[40:32] spiritual products
[40:36] but they're going off somewhere else to
[40:39] buy their spiritual products now i won't
[40:42] get into all of this but you can write
[40:44] down uh if you want to or it's going on
[40:47] a tape anyway
[40:48] uh king a has in
[40:51] second kings chapter one he went for
[40:54] counsel up to some false god by the name
[40:57] of beelzebub and elijah met him and he's
[41:01] coming back and said how dare you you go
[41:04] up to
[41:05] seek after blc bob when we have jehovah
[41:08] the true and the living god that you can
[41:10] go to and ask for help amen why do you
[41:13] think i'm here amen because he already
[41:15] knows and i've come here and he
[41:18] delivered the prophecy from the presence
[41:20] of almighty god amen you'll find in
[41:23] jeremiah 46 11 and 12 2nd chronicles
[41:27] amen 16 12 jeremiah 8 22. those are some
[41:33] scriptures you can follow up to show you
[41:37] how uh through the ages right on down to
[41:40] the time of jesus
[41:42] that these
[41:43] spirits religious spirits were rejecting
[41:47] god's uh uh diagnosis his advice
[41:52] and the answer to it and they would not
[41:55] come to him for cancer they would not
[41:58] comfort him to
[42:00] to him for healing but they will search
[42:03] every other place no wonder the one
[42:06] prophet said is there no bomb in gilead
[42:11] is there no
[42:12] healing in gilead
[42:14] you know but thank god we know that
[42:17] there is a great physician
[42:20] we know his name is jesus christ
[42:22] we know he is the mighty counselor amen
[42:26] the mighty god and the everlasting
[42:28] father to him they should have come to
[42:30] get their answers amen praise god
[42:34] hallelujah so
[42:36] he directs them to himself
[42:38] the word
[42:40] that's where he goes to the church right
[42:43] instead of them running to this
[42:44] theologian searching out this wise man
[42:47] of many years ago that was studying the
[42:49] bible and wrote a big thick volume or
[42:52] whatever that's good but you're going to
[42:54] study that when now is the edge when you
[42:57] can come directly to him there by faith
[43:01] and he can give you the answers that you
[43:03] seek amen so he directs them come on to
[43:08] me and buy of me gold
[43:11] and me
[43:12] he's talking about is himself the word
[43:17] so you come to the word hallelujah
[43:20] praise god
[43:21] now we find the church is in a situation
[43:25] where instead of their actions their
[43:27] motives and desires being spiritual
[43:30] now their motives and desires becomes
[43:33] transactional
[43:36] everything they do has to have like a
[43:38] transaction
[43:41] a form of business
[43:42] you've got to transact something amen
[43:45] praise god and in doing so they even
[43:48] think they're spiritual
[43:50] they think they're being as they the
[43:52] word wise
[43:54] is cast around all the time but that's
[43:57] not the real wisdom of god that's not
[44:00] the real wisdom that god wants you to
[44:04] have praise god amen
[44:07] amen hallelujah i tell you god says
[44:11] god in you
[44:14] willing and doing of his own good
[44:16] pleasure
[44:17] philippians 2 13
[44:19] hallelujah
[44:21] praise god
[44:22] but
[44:23] quoting the prophet he says but you know
[44:26] god is not in them for as long as they
[44:30] are of
[44:32] denominational seed and spirit
[44:35] not the seed of god
[44:38] and the spirit of god
[44:40] then
[44:42] they
[44:43] god is not with them amen
[44:46] by of me gold tried in the fire that you
[44:50] may be rich praise god brother could you
[44:54] take down that clock correct the timing
[44:56] if it's not is it right
[44:59] it's correct okay just want to be sure
[45:02] that's not the hour ahead it just it
[45:04] just suddenly struck me
[45:07] how hour behind i mean praise the lord
[45:10] hallelujah praise the lord anyway praise
[45:13] god
[45:14] now
[45:15] these people had a lot of gold
[45:17] and you know the church has a lot of
[45:18] gold but my fact they own most of the
[45:20] gold of the world already
[45:22] is the rest of the world don't yet know
[45:24] it
[45:25] what we are seeing with this war in
[45:26] ukraine i kind of jump there but you'll
[45:29] understand why is because
[45:32] the world is in a fluxes ready to change
[45:35] from the iron curtain to the purple
[45:37] curtain
[45:39] because as the prophet tells and the
[45:41] prophecies of the bible tells you that
[45:43] the great dragon and the bear has to
[45:45] come together which is china and russia
[45:48] and the bible tells us they have to come
[45:50] down to israel to take the oil that is
[45:54] up there and the rest of it is not going
[45:57] to happen of course it's not going to
[45:58] happen during our time but prophecy
[46:00] tells us what is fixing to happen so the
[46:04] groundwork for all these
[46:07] prophecies being fulfilled
[46:09] it's been set in order right now
[46:13] so out of conflict and chaos and death
[46:16] and everything else god is literally
[46:20] creating the atmosphere to fulfill his
[46:23] word
[46:24] prophet said watch russia king of the
[46:27] north
[46:28] he says oh watch russia king of the
[46:31] north but he says no
[46:34] it's not fascism not nazism it's not
[46:38] going to be the bamboo curtain it's not
[46:42] going to be the iron curtain but watch
[46:44] that purple curtain when it comes in
[46:47] amen that's the one you ought to keep
[46:50] your eyes on praise god they say oh why
[46:54] should i watch a church
[46:56] something a lamb
[46:59] spirit
[47:00] but speaking like a dragon
[47:02] right
[47:04] because it presents the harmlessness to
[47:07] the the people who i have eyes but see
[47:10] not
[47:11] it appears harmless
[47:14] so timid so nice and so controlled like
[47:20] like a lamb but what it's teaching and
[47:22] speaking is like a dragon
[47:25] right so there we see it friends that
[47:28] this actually has most of the gold in
[47:32] the world
[47:34] and this
[47:36] trial or test we see going forward
[47:39] to see how
[47:42] control over gold and money in this
[47:44] world
[47:46] can control
[47:47] everything else
[47:49] of course except the true seed of god
[47:52] but it controls everything else
[47:54] right they just put russia in a corner
[47:57] there box them in and uh there'll be
[48:00] even more sanctions on them and then
[48:02] we'll see where they're at
[48:04] but that is just a display because now
[48:07] mr babylon can see
[48:10] once they have the majority control over
[48:13] that goal they know they got the whole
[48:15] thing in the grasp like that
[48:18] [Music]
[48:19] because then
[48:20] they just pull back their gold and say
[48:22] go ahead do whatever you want but but
[48:24] you're not going to have any of this
[48:25] what are you going to do and then they
[48:27] give orders to the other people and says
[48:30] you buy from them and we pull it back
[48:31] from you too and nobody is going to want
[48:34] to do anything else you see what's
[48:36] coming
[48:37] you have an idea of what's taking place
[48:40] so these people have plenty of gold
[48:44] one of the employees actually in the
[48:46] vatican while i was there we got kind of
[48:49] chummy because um i'd gone through the
[48:52] vatican
[48:53] quite a few times and the rest of them
[48:56] were walking around and i was kind of
[48:58] tired so i just stood there and you know
[49:02] i just talked i like talking talking to
[49:04] people so i started talking to him and
[49:06] we're talking to him and said wow this
[49:08] is marvelous my goodness it must be a
[49:11] lot of um funds coming in for the holy
[49:14] church you know this and that well he
[49:16] automatically thinks i'm a catholic too
[49:18] he says oh yeah uh the at least every
[49:21] every day is over 96 or 100 000
[49:25] that comes in you know that um from just
[49:28] buying the trinkets and stuff like that
[49:30] that has nothing to do with the masses
[49:31] and this and that and that the other
[49:33] like that so the gold is pouring in
[49:37] non-stop it's pouring in day and night
[49:40] then i go down further
[49:42] and there was a lot of these bosses
[49:46] right uh and uh you know
[49:49] all ritually dressed but
[49:51] you can tell these these men got all
[49:54] kinds of money and they were there and
[49:57] they were
[49:59] giving to the priests
[50:01] huge amounts right
[50:04] praise god but in any case
[50:07] gold
[50:08] is in the church like you will not
[50:10] believe it everywhere
[50:14] but the wrong kind of gold they don't
[50:16] have the right kind of gold
[50:19] because the goal that he is talking
[50:21] about is the gold of your character
[50:25] you can have all the gold outside and
[50:27] you don't have the gold of his character
[50:30] or you don't have a piece of him on the
[50:32] inside my friends that gold is worthless
[50:36] it's worth something in this world but
[50:38] you understand when this body is all
[50:40] decayed and taken up by worms and you
[50:42] are no more what is it usually a gold
[50:45] with you
[50:46] i agree with the lady whose husband say
[50:49] when i'm going you're not getting any of
[50:51] my money put it all inside there with me
[50:54] and bury it with me
[50:57] and so they're burying him and she and
[51:00] her son
[51:01] is there crying and everything else your
[51:04] father is all gone and stuff like that
[51:07] you know and son said yes
[51:10] did you bury the money yes she said i
[51:13] bury all that he owns with him i wrote
[51:16] him a check
[51:25] and they buried it with him
[51:28] right
[51:32] oh yeah
[51:34] so she buried him with all this money
[51:37] and there they are
[51:40] they are trafficking
[51:43] and doing transactional things
[51:47] with the gold that is not of god
[51:52] they are buying men's souls
[51:55] they are buying men's lives
[51:59] literally
[52:01] i seen how they will take money and give
[52:04] to people or give them loans and
[52:06] everything else just to obligate them to
[52:08] the church or relate them to themselves
[52:11] amen and those people feel obligated
[52:14] because of all that money
[52:17] right so that is what
[52:19] they're doing and causing the goal to
[52:22] warp
[52:23] uh men's personalities and character
[52:27] and and twist their minds
[52:29] to start thinking they what way they
[52:33] want them to think but the scripture
[52:35] tells us
[52:36] the love of money is the root of all
[52:40] evil
[52:42] right the love of money
[52:44] not money itself that's an
[52:47] in
[52:48] animate object right
[52:50] so
[52:51] the love of money is the root of all
[52:55] evil
[52:56] amen
[52:57] revelation 18 1 to 14. i won't read that
[53:01] you can read it but parts of it says is
[53:04] babylon the greatest fallen has fallen
[53:06] and has become the habitation of devils
[53:09] and the hold of every found spirit in
[53:13] the church
[53:14] amen right praise god because satan has
[53:18] nowhere this is his last hand
[53:22] right
[53:23] right he has to come in the church to
[53:26] oppose the word right in the church he
[53:28] knows the denominations are under his
[53:30] power
[53:31] you don't have to worry about them you
[53:33] don't have to worry about nobody else
[53:35] but he has to come in the churches or
[53:39] church or groups that
[53:41] have really received the word of god for
[53:45] this day and for this hour
[53:47] and for that he has to bring his forces
[53:51] right here and to attack the minds and
[53:54] the lines of god's people but thank god
[53:59] that we have with us the overcomer
[54:04] thank god we have jesus christ
[54:07] amen
[54:09] she has become the hold of every foul
[54:11] spirit
[54:13] and the cage of every
[54:15] uh unclean and hateful bird
[54:19] kings of the earth have committed
[54:21] fornication with her
[54:23] merchants of the earth are wax
[54:25] rich true abundance of our delicacies
[54:29] and i heard another voice from heaven
[54:32] saying
[54:33] come out of her my people
[54:36] that you be not partakers of our plagues
[54:39] and that you receive not of her plagues
[54:42] amen praise god i want to thank god for
[54:45] the scripture
[54:47] because way back since i'm a young man
[54:51] come out of her mind people and the
[54:53] spirit of god says see
[54:55] as wicked as they are
[54:57] as rotten as foul as evil as it is
[55:01] i have some people in there and you need
[55:03] to call them out
[55:05] amen praise god call them out because i
[55:08] have them in there why would i say come
[55:10] out if there wasn't people in
[55:13] so he says call them out amen praise god
[55:17] hallelujah and i thank god there's one
[55:19] sitting over there praise god is the
[55:22] one sitting over there and there's
[55:23] others here praise god called out by the
[55:26] grace of god
[55:27] hallelujah uh brother sister when you
[55:31] think of it you know in the initial
[55:33] sense you look and say oh my god has to
[55:36] use a vessel i come in that service and
[55:38] brother simon was preaching but it
[55:40] wasn't brother simon really that talked
[55:42] to you
[55:43] that supernatural thing that you come in
[55:46] contact with was the holy spirit
[55:49] even i who was preaching at the time i
[55:51] knew that the holy spirit was sending
[55:52] out the message but i didn't know the
[55:54] extent of what the holy spirit was doing
[55:57] praise god but i give him glory and
[56:00] praise amen praise god you see they were
[56:04] they're giving people gold to buy their
[56:06] loyalty
[56:08] right
[56:09] by their loyalty this is what brother
[56:11] branham was talking about oh when you
[56:13] were in trouble and you didn't have any
[56:16] food in your house who came to your
[56:18] house with a basket with good things the
[56:21] kind old priest
[56:23] says when your mother was dead you
[56:25] didn't have money to bury her whatever
[56:29] from the society burial society who came
[56:32] to help you your kind old priest
[56:35] well after all these various acts the
[56:37] prophet mentioned do you think that
[56:39] person you can ever get that person to
[56:42] actually leave that church because they
[56:45] obligated them they use their wealth to
[56:49] create a false loyalty not based on the
[56:53] word of god
[56:55] amen you see oh that's what they do and
[56:58] it's coming because now how you gonna
[57:01] like brother branham said what are you
[57:03] gonna say to them about that kind of
[57:05] priest you're gonna go and tell them the
[57:07] priest is the devil
[57:08] and when you do that it it'll backfire
[57:12] and make you look like the devil a good
[57:14] old man like that that lived his whole
[57:17] life for the priesthood and gave this
[57:21] and helped my mother like that you see
[57:23] it turns the other way so it's a very
[57:26] cunning and deceitful plot that the
[57:29] devil has put forth there praise god oh
[57:33] i'm gonna jump over that that the rest
[57:36] of that scripture because you have read
[57:38] it and i know you can read it again
[57:41] hallelujah
[57:43] god says come out of her my people
[57:47] hallelujah praise god
[57:49] remember
[57:51] when this is said at that time
[57:56] and i see i have a mark here
[57:58] remember
[58:00] this is the happen the rapture has not
[58:02] yet taken place
[58:04] that's why i'm telling you that is now
[58:07] that is us here right now come out of
[58:10] her my people
[58:12] right you see i was so vigorous about it
[58:14] at times and i went around
[58:16] about doing it brother peter and those
[58:19] brothers were going to those catholic
[58:20] churches and putting there
[58:23] i had written the track um
[58:26] the track about mary and whatnot and and
[58:29] they were giving out that and going and
[58:31] waiting for the catholic church to be
[58:33] over and giving
[58:35] giving the people until the priest had
[58:37] to go to the police and make reports to
[58:40] the city you know because they're on
[58:42] fire with god and got to come out call
[58:44] them out wherever they are everything
[58:47] else like that you know praise god now
[58:50] of course god used that but that was a
[58:52] wrong approach going uh uh you know on
[58:55] their property and going to their front
[58:58] door and sticking it even when they
[59:00] didn't have church we would take sister
[59:02] charlotte and all those things and stick
[59:03] it on the on the you know on the handle
[59:06] of the church there so that when they
[59:08] come to open it it will be there and
[59:10] stuff like that it was adventurous but
[59:12] it was not the right thing to do god
[59:15] would call
[59:16] out his own people
[59:18] by his own grace amen hallelujah that's
[59:22] all
[59:22] the church today has the worldly gold
[59:26] gold that will melt and perish
[59:30] amen it'll melt and perish away uh you
[59:34] know i like to tell these little stories
[59:36] as they come to me this one is this man
[59:38] that went into the uh us desert with a
[59:42] partner and the two of them went there
[59:44] looking for gold they finally found a
[59:46] lot of gold and uh they went to bed that
[59:50] night and he was thinking that you know
[59:52] it'll be better if i take off with this
[59:54] set of gold and you know the gold that
[59:57] we have here and i'll be rich for the
[59:59] rest of my life and so he ups
[1:00:03] and he kills his partner
[1:00:07] and he grabs
[1:00:10] the water
[1:00:11] container
[1:00:13] puts it on his annual and takes all the
[1:00:16] gold and heading across the desert back
[1:00:17] to civilization
[1:00:20] and of course the sun is hot hot hot
[1:00:24] and when he gets to the point where he's
[1:00:26] really thirsty he takes the bottle and
[1:00:28] he does
[1:00:29] and instead of water
[1:00:31] he had picked up the bottle
[1:00:34] full of wine
[1:00:36] and you know
[1:00:38] you can't
[1:00:40] you can't uh substitute water for wine
[1:00:43] and the wine is going to get you
[1:00:45] thirstier
[1:00:46] and you have nothing else to drink the
[1:00:48] story is he died what could he do he
[1:00:51] couldn't get the gold out
[1:00:53] he died
[1:00:55] of thirst trying to get the gold out and
[1:00:57] that's what's a lot of people they want
[1:01:00] to hang on to this world's gold and they
[1:01:02] don't care about god and the word of god
[1:01:04] and all that sort of stuff and they
[1:01:07] won't quench their thirst that they the
[1:01:09] ever-present what is from the rock of
[1:01:11] the living god amen hallelujah and the
[1:01:15] church today is putting the emphasis
[1:01:18] on uh
[1:01:20] wealth and affluence uh being the
[1:01:24] standard of whether you're spiritual or
[1:01:28] not
[1:01:29] whether you're blessed or not
[1:01:31] amen
[1:01:32] it's how much gold you have
[1:01:35] show us how blessed you are if that's
[1:01:38] the case jesus i don't know
[1:01:40] you know didn't own anything not even a
[1:01:42] pillow to put his head have to put his
[1:01:44] head on rocks and everything else and
[1:01:46] yet he owned the whole world but now
[1:01:48] they have that as the standard
[1:01:52] that if you want to be successful uh uh
[1:01:55] you you've got to be affluent
[1:01:58] you've got to be rich you've got to be
[1:02:00] this nothing is wrong with being rich
[1:02:03] with being affluent with god blessing
[1:02:05] you in every possible way but they are
[1:02:09] placing that now as the evidence
[1:02:13] of god's blessing
[1:02:15] just as much as they misplace the whole
[1:02:17] thing with the evidence of the holy
[1:02:19] spirit they're just placing it here with
[1:02:22] the evidence
[1:02:23] of what it is to have god's blessing
[1:02:26] amen yes sir
[1:02:29] what's clearly praise god and
[1:02:32] the correctness
[1:02:34] of the doctrine of
[1:02:36] that certain certain church is based on
[1:02:40] how many rich people are within that
[1:02:42] church
[1:02:43] tells you how correct the doctrine is
[1:02:45] these are sensible people you can't just
[1:02:48] preach just anything and they're going
[1:02:50] to believe it and if all they are
[1:02:52] smarter than me all of them got
[1:02:53] companies making money
[1:02:56] and they're going to that church if i
[1:02:57] get in the midst of that don't you see
[1:02:59] somehow
[1:03:01] god will give me wisdom or an idea will
[1:03:03] come from one of them and i also will go
[1:03:06] upwards and gravitate and and get rich
[1:03:09] also that's that's the thinking and they
[1:03:12] know that when they create that
[1:03:14] atmosphere
[1:03:16] that is what they're going to have
[1:03:18] but god says
[1:03:20] buy of me gold
[1:03:22] but the gold that is tried in the fire
[1:03:26] gold tried in the fire amen and then you
[1:03:29] will truly be rich that's when you're
[1:03:31] really going to be rich when you have
[1:03:33] the gold that is tried in the fire
[1:03:37] praise god hallelujah brother branham
[1:03:39] said at this point are we getting it are
[1:03:44] we really getting it
[1:03:46] listen to me friends
[1:03:49] naked
[1:03:50] we come into the world and naked
[1:03:53] spiritually we will not leave it amen no
[1:03:58] we are going to take something with us
[1:04:01] hallelujah
[1:04:02] you're going to take something with you
[1:04:04] right
[1:04:05] i
[1:04:06] can't take your money with you
[1:04:08] you can't take the other uh guy that
[1:04:12] loved to play the piano i forgot
[1:04:14] whatever his name is said man i love the
[1:04:16] piano when i when i'm going i'm taking
[1:04:18] my piano with me bury me with my piano
[1:04:21] but you can't take it with you your
[1:04:23] bones are going to rotten there
[1:04:25] everything else yeah they surround you
[1:04:27] with all your millions of dollars it
[1:04:28] will all perish
[1:04:30] it doesn't matter it'll go with you amen
[1:04:33] but there's one thing you can take with
[1:04:36] you praise god hallelujah and that's
[1:04:38] your character
[1:04:41] amen your character will always be there
[1:04:44] with you
[1:04:46] and you can't leave that behind
[1:04:49] hallelujah right before god the prophet
[1:04:52] says we will take our character that is
[1:04:55] what we will take with us
[1:04:57] what kind of character will you will you
[1:05:00] take with you
[1:05:02] will it be
[1:05:03] his
[1:05:05] will it be
[1:05:06] his amen that's what we want that's what
[1:05:10] we want to always have and that is the
[1:05:13] knowledge that is
[1:05:15] keeping us here today
[1:05:18] and nothing in this present world with
[1:05:21] all the storms of life that are coming
[1:05:24] with all the chaos with all the
[1:05:27] look you see the increase in propaganda
[1:05:31] you you understand the uh the assault of
[1:05:34] lies and
[1:05:36] lying becoming normalized and
[1:05:38] commonplace with even ordinary people
[1:05:41] until they think just
[1:05:43] everybody lies it's just a normal thing
[1:05:45] and life look you got to have the holy
[1:05:49] spirit keeping your mind straight
[1:05:53] and it's by being in the word that it
[1:05:55] keeps your mind straight
[1:05:57] he'll do everything to tempt you
[1:06:00] bring something close to all you got to
[1:06:02] do is say yes when you know it's no
[1:06:06] more my god help us
[1:06:08] what an hour
[1:06:10] that we're living in
[1:06:12] all you leodycian people
[1:06:16] you're so soft
[1:06:19] and character-less
[1:06:22] oh it's up to each one of us in that day
[1:06:26] every man
[1:06:27] will bear his own burden
[1:06:31] now this city of ledicia of course you
[1:06:34] know was a city that had a lot of wealth
[1:06:37] a lot of gold in it
[1:06:40] and it flourished and they had a
[1:06:43] two-headed coin that was very much
[1:06:46] desired by everybody two-sided coin uh
[1:06:50] that was desired by every body
[1:06:53] and we have that same thing with the
[1:06:55] church today because the church um as
[1:06:59] i've called it many years ago and still
[1:07:01] call it uh we have entered into a phase
[1:07:03] of stock market religion
[1:07:07] where um
[1:07:09] you buy yourself in or pay yourself
[1:07:12] or pay for your entrance into the church
[1:07:15] and the richer you are is
[1:07:17] easier and faster you can pay yourself
[1:07:19] into the church uh like that
[1:07:22] and um and then you are you're allowed
[1:07:25] to
[1:07:26] buy
[1:07:27] yourself out of sin
[1:07:30] you're allowed to
[1:07:33] so we have a stock market religion
[1:07:36] you buy in
[1:07:38] right
[1:07:39] and then you can sell out quick right
[1:07:43] like that right the prophet says
[1:07:47] we can now buy ourselves out of sin
[1:07:50] and try to also encourage by them by
[1:07:54] yourself into heaven
[1:07:57] see
[1:07:58] but god doesn't say that
[1:08:01] the churches own such phenomenal wealth
[1:08:04] and at any given time she can take over
[1:08:06] the entire world system
[1:08:09] she can take over the entire system of
[1:08:12] commerce
[1:08:14] she can be the leader and will be the
[1:08:17] leader of the world council of churches
[1:08:21] amen
[1:08:22] and
[1:08:23] we know that the leader of the world
[1:08:26] consular churches
[1:08:28] has openly prophesied in public
[1:08:31] that the church in the foreseeable
[1:08:34] future
[1:08:36] what she could do and what she will do
[1:08:40] and the golden tower of babel
[1:08:44] will fall
[1:08:46] and only the gold
[1:08:48] tried in the fire
[1:08:50] shall endure amongst them
[1:08:54] amen
[1:08:55] i'm going to
[1:08:57] stop in a few minutes here
[1:09:00] but just let me finish
[1:09:02] commenting on this
[1:09:04] next
[1:09:05] paragraph
[1:09:07] what has the church constantly done
[1:09:11] through the ages prophet said what has
[1:09:13] the church done she has done what she
[1:09:16] has always done from eve right on down
[1:09:20] always she left the word
[1:09:23] and go off on her own
[1:09:25] she just left the word see
[1:09:28] and see
[1:09:29] and taken her own creeds our own ideas
[1:09:33] her own darkness and joined herself to
[1:09:39] the world
[1:09:40] and that's what the church has done
[1:09:42] through the ages absolutely see
[1:09:46] and god is saying
[1:09:49] now
[1:09:50] that
[1:09:51] you are found naked
[1:09:53] and now i'm going to judge your lewdness
[1:09:57] amen and the only way for you to escape
[1:10:01] this dreadful situation is to come back
[1:10:04] to the word of god amen come out of her
[1:10:07] my people
[1:10:09] and be not partakers of her plagues
[1:10:13] praise god friends you uh i i i stop
[1:10:17] here now but you realize what's going on
[1:10:20] uh i don't know this is not here in this
[1:10:23] text or anything else
[1:10:24] we're coming down the doors
[1:10:28] shutting you understand
[1:10:31] the thing is almost shut
[1:10:35] all the prophet said you're looking for
[1:10:37] now is one if you find that one last
[1:10:40] elect and when whoever does it in any
[1:10:43] part of the world when that happens and
[1:10:46] that last one comes in the whole thing
[1:10:48] goes up
[1:10:49] you're insane while we're still here we
[1:10:52] know the last one hasn't come in yet
[1:10:54] because when that one comes in he said
[1:10:57] you have to know when they come in right
[1:10:59] but when that last one comes in the
[1:11:02] whole thing goes up
[1:11:03] praise god
[1:11:05] so when you see what is happening in the
[1:11:08] church in the world all the events all
[1:11:11] the things put them together you realize
[1:11:15] the door is slowly closing
[1:11:19] amen
[1:11:20] and that is why you hear a lot of
[1:11:22] brothers are already preaching
[1:11:24] redemption is over nobody else can come
[1:11:27] in but not my bible didn't tell me that
[1:11:30] and uh the events and the prophecies of
[1:11:33] the prophet didn't actually tell us that
[1:11:36] he just talked about the door being shut
[1:11:40] amen at a certain time the door being
[1:11:43] shut
[1:11:44] and you talked and of course there's a
[1:11:45] lot of quotes that they use about uh
[1:11:48] noah preaching in the art door right but
[1:11:51] the door was behind noah and it was
[1:11:54] still open
[1:11:55] that's why he was preaching
[1:11:57] right it's when he went in the bible
[1:12:00] says and then god shut the door
[1:12:03] and when the rapture goes out takes us
[1:12:06] out of here then god shuts the door
[1:12:09] but while we are still here let's work
[1:12:12] till jesus comes
[1:12:14] while we're still here let's preach the
[1:12:16] word till jesus comes
[1:12:18] while we are still here let's carry the
[1:12:21] message as
[1:12:22] far as we can and the best we can amen
[1:12:25] look when this rapture comes if somebody
[1:12:28] heard the message from you and they
[1:12:29] haven't ripened to the point to
[1:12:31] recognize they are one elected seed or
[1:12:33] they're in a remnant leave that alone
[1:12:36] god will deal with the rest of the grain
[1:12:38] that isn't fully ripe yet
[1:12:40] right
[1:12:41] you just go into the bonds and let the
[1:12:45] grace of god take hold of your life but
[1:12:47] pray for them
[1:12:49] pray that god will lead you to some of
[1:12:51] his elect or his grain
[1:12:54] pray that god will use you in every
[1:12:56] possible way as the prophet said
[1:12:58] remember with the wise and the foolish
[1:13:01] virgins some were wise say some were
[1:13:03] foolish but all of them were virgins
[1:13:05] the woman that cut the pattern he says
[1:13:08] the plot over here in the squad is the
[1:13:11] same thought
[1:13:12] you just happen to be elected to be
[1:13:15] within the confines of that pattern
[1:13:18] and that is why we got to give glory and
[1:13:21] grace to god
[1:13:22] why am i in and he is out why
[1:13:25] why am i in and she is out why is she in
[1:13:28] and this one is out that's the grace and
[1:13:31] mercy of the love of god
[1:13:33] god rich in mercy is why we are here
[1:13:36] tonight giving praise and all because
[1:13:39] you look at yourself sometimes praise
[1:13:41] god and you say
[1:13:43] no good thing dwells in me amen only the
[1:13:47] grace of god can take us through friends
[1:13:50] so rest on his love his mercy and his
[1:13:53] grace while the musician comes
[1:13:56] rest on that praise the lord
[1:13:59] and let's pray one for the other
[1:14:02] don't look back
[1:14:05] all the days we had
[1:14:07] um
[1:14:08] wonderful sweet days when we would
[1:14:10] gather in our homes and fellowship
[1:14:13] together break bread together eat
[1:14:15] together
[1:14:17] playing the guitar singing and talking
[1:14:20] and talking around the world and
[1:14:22] everything else those days are not
[1:14:25] coming back it's gone to another phase
[1:14:28] now
[1:14:29] and god helping us
[1:14:31] um if you'll allow me then i'll talk
[1:14:33] we'll talk about that on sunday by the
[1:14:36] grace of god may god bless every one of
[1:14:37] you praise the lord everyone
[1:14:43] another generation is coming and we got
[1:14:46] to prepare them right we got to do that

[1:15:11] get a hot toddy and
[1:15:16] but he's here tonight
[1:15:19] and that is really an example
[1:15:21] for every single one of us praise god
