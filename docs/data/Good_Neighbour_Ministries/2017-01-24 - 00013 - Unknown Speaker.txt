TRANSCRIPT
========================================
able Ministers of the New Testament able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter you're not Ministers of the letter right but of the spirit it's not so much the words only that you're talk but you're supposed to minister the spirit to the people right for the letter kill it what the spirit gives it life amen father bless your word to your people tonight in Simplicity and humility take all the glory and praise in Jesus name amen amen sounds so funny please receive it but I think um i' I've told it many times a few Believers about it I was in a foreign country and there were a three four ministers there and at this time this gentleman was one of the leading minister in church a thousand people come in the southern us there was well known and there was another brother and and he tried to you know the brother was talking with me and we were just talking back and forth on deep things to the Lord and this brother try to get in the conversation to put in his peace and this wellknown preacher turn and says shut up before I bury you with c he's going to bury him with quotes he was right the Bible tells us the letter kills what the spirit is like that right now it's true at the time when he said it it was just funny to me but you know I'm thinking of it now is truth the letter kills they can put you to death is all right I mean those brother B even used the term he says they can spit it out faster than the machine gun so so uh that's fine that but that doesn't tell you anything and people Shout Scream but what you screaming up is the Holy Ghost falling on you or are you so astonished and amazed at the man's uh elasticity of mind or his um mental agility or something like that uh his ability to retain his photographic memory and you get impressed by that but what are you actually hearing you've got to be able to see how the word places itself and as you grow in the Holy Spirit and as you listen for the revealed word you will be able to deser these Spirits much better than you did before amen the Indian chief puts it another way say Chief you went to service how was it what did you get he says much Thunder Lots lightning no R right it's the same thing right so we have to be aware that we didn't just come the music is good praise the Lord am fellowship with each other great wonderful but brother grandon we come to receive the word for this hour amen amen he is our King yes he is Sovereign and he appeared in flesh so that we get to know him they he disappear so that now when you don't see him at least you know his character am you know who he is and you know how he acts and so we are worshiping an invisible God an invisible King and he said he's going to be here Among Us yes because I w't Leave You uh comfortless or leave you alone but I'll be with you even in you to the very end of the age amen so we are comforted with the fact that he's here with us tonight whether the Thunders roll the lightning flash or what something breaks out whatever he chooses to do we are open to it but we know he is with us amen amen and that's what's important yes sir not where home brother is going to be there my God you know right now if you were to here even in the middle of the week that certain brother was going to be passing through here you see how many people will be here from all the churches is that right but Jesus you know we have him with the poor we have with us always is that right you see oh Jesus who who he Joseph's son we know him he's from Nazareth I mean uh we even know all his little wicked things when he was a boy you know running around and stuff like that playing boys pranks and stuff so what's he going to tell us right I've had older people tell me that when I was 16 and preaching to them boy I've been reading the Bible for so many years 34 years before you come on this Earth what you want to teach what are you going to teach me but you see they don't understand that Insight teacher amen and you must not fail to discern the Lord's body amen not that body back there but which one is he using now to be your mother your father your brother your sister Discerning the Lord's body amen and recognizing that we said at the beginning of the year the voice of the holy spirit amen because if you don't recognize it all you going to be doing listening to words and and and and that's you to feed just on words and the Bible tells you the letter kills yes but the spirit gives life let me approach that from a different angle another angle is that we are part of that word yes you realize that amen we are a part of that word but as humans the let it kill so you can't depend even on the religious uh um pronouncements of a man even that will kill you you see uh only the Holy Spirit getting true to you is what's going to give you life amen so even me speaking here tonight I may speak for an hour 45 minutes and uh all I'm speaking sometimes only one or two things out of what I'm saying gets right through to you like that grabs your attention right see your spiritual food induces amen and when you receive that you hear that that is what gives you life is that right amen say sometimes you're eting an apple I fine you come up against some pits you come up against different things he says well all you got to do is just push that aside but that part that really fits your amen KCK it in CU that's your portion amen praise God hallelujah amen amen well I don't know it look like I'm come to confession tonight but I've had the um I've had the reputation of being quite tough Through The Years from various uh people preachers even membership sometimes think you're you're too tough but they uh of course don't understand that that's what the love of God does yes and if your friend is in a house uh on fire and and they're asleep uh you're not just going to come and touch them that you want to shake them MH you want to wake them up you can argue with me later on when you're in heaven I don't think anybody be arguing but the fact is Wake Up Now Praise the Lord but you end up getting the oh you seems like you're driving away more people than you're winning to Christ well yes and no because you know you trash the wheat so that you can get the real grave amen you don't want to or a whole lot of shock or as we say in the wtin husk right we don't want husk and all of that you always going to have some of that but we don't want a whole lot of that and just uh let it be just numbers uh it looks like a great achievement reflecting on the man no but to develop uh Believers that will be Eagles amen where one Eagle is equal to a th000 chickens mhm is that right amen cuz one e will leave those thousand chickens alive and a barnyard of chicken see one e come on the SE in the scatter right away the scatter that makes a great difference I here's somebody that just not knows the word but they know the spirit of the word praise the Lord hallelujah well Jesus had the same problem and he said eat my flesh drink my blood or you don't have any part with me and and what happened the Bible said and some of them followed him no more can you imagine that Jesus had a church SP yes and that out the Bible tells us he had about 500 disciples and we know that the tell us only 120 made it to the upper room that means that he lost 380 in one day after preaching that sermon about eating his flesh drinking his blood uh or you have no part with me the Bible says they walked with him no more amen John chapter 6 number of man anyway so they left him and they walked with him no more and so he had that church spit because of that hard type that kind of preaching that stays with the word and the spirit and truth of the word of the Living God Amen so brother brother the same thing they said Billy quoting him now if you don't stop preaching like that you'll run everybody away from you he says you know there's one thing that would go and that's the holy spirit amen because he won't go away from the word hallelujah and if the True Believer has the Holy Spirit he said he W go away from the word she W go away from the word of God because it's food for their soul that's what do you think we're feeding on just the writing or the reading or the the Bible uh the words in the Bible amen no we are feeding on him the bread of life am he is our man for today we have come to the Feast of Messiah we come to feed on him yes Satan feeds on his children and eats them up is that right but God allows his children to feed on him what a difference give his life for us amen that we can feed upon Him Praise the Lord the True Believer W go from the word it's food to his soul he loves it nothing can keep him away like Jacob he wants that Birthright amen hallelujah it don't care if it cost him friends he's got to have it don't care if it cost them his job they've got to have iten don't matter if it cost them church membership they've got to have it cost them anything they still go there for they have to have it why it's the Deep calling to the Deep there's something in us that we can't explain how we believe you can't explain how do you believe something brother B said the real things of life you can't purchase with money like what is Peace p having peace of mind what is it really you see you can't buy that you can't explain what is love you know he mentions some of those words things like that he said you they're Priceless but those are the things that these people count as not right I I believe that Christians are chasing after some imaginary something wasting their time going to church and worshiping God and praising God but that's not so amen what appears real now is fa yes and what to them that they think is foolishness that's the wisdom of God and that's what be arresting our Fai God hallelujah amen Brother P said all the spirits operating today he says you can find their every move page 18 of uh hearing recognizing and acting he said you can find there every move today right if you go right back to Genesis it's the SE chapter all of it came right out of that book of Genesis and so friends let that soak into you let that really soak into you see that's the things of God it's all coming to a end and Jesus said W the SE of God and the mark of the beast are here again two spiritual Powers working amen amen they're working praise the Lord hallelujah amen then he says how many of you know that the seed of God is our work right hallelujah amen the seed of God is our part right and the Seal of God is what who the holy spirit amen that is hard work right glory to God you know you have the right birth when the Holy Spirit comes to you or you have the Holy Spirit and him being in you you'll never deviate from the word but the spirit in you when it hears the word the genuine word it will recognize that word never having heard it before in that fight right even if you never heard it like that before yet something in you is going to tell you that's right right that's right your mind up here may not be able to explain it but you get a a testimony a feeling a burning in Soul did not our hearts burn with him as he talked with us along the way there record in your soul and you know your recogniz and nobody can take that away huj said once a man has genuinely heard the voice of God the P of the PF nobody can extend it away from him in the natural world the great philosophers of today there a statement used a mind expanded can never contract is that right it cannot contract because it's already expanded to receive knowledge and wisdom of the day praise God Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed till the day of the Redemption hallelujah amen so the Holy Spirit comes into your life it identifies you that you have the right birth amen or the birth right and then also he becomes your assurance that you will be in the but the scripture is telling you you are sealed until the day of your Redemption Hallelujah that means that he he'll stay with you and do everything no matter your stumblings your failings your this and that he is there to assure you certify guarantee and warranty that you are making it to that Rapture because of him that is in you how can I overcome How can any of us here make it out of this sodomite conditions that the world is in today how can anyone by your own Holiness by Your Own Strength by your own resistance by your tur over and no but by him that has already overcome that dwells in you that's how you overcome overcome by the mother that lives in you is he that is in you he that is in the world oh David said look my Help Cometh From The Lord cre of Heaven and the earth when my soul is discouraged and I feel down he said why am I looking down and discourage all my soul the Lord is the strength of my the Lord is my salvation of shall I the Lord is the strength of my life of what shall I be afraid wow God in you the Holy Ghost living in your life praise God I'm trying to get to a certain point here but I want you to see clearly that he makes the difference amen amen praise God Amen I told the story sometime of a woman that make a beautiful wonderful cake hope none of you sisters make that that mistake anyway and she presented her husband cut a nice slice for him to eat he started eating and she Noti his face looked kind of funny she says what's wrong he said the you know know it's missing uh any some of the ingredients it's missing you know the the yeast or whatever had to be inside of it she said oh M and she tasted yes I missed the most important ingredient and I think that's exactly what a lot of Christians do they miss the ingredient of the holy spirit with their life and sometimes the church miss the element of the Holy Spirit and thinks that he's just emotional or just or he's just coats or or he's just Bible studies or something like that but he is a living person Our God isn't dead but he's alive it's just that we don't see him when our visualize you just you know now you see me now you don't now you see me now you don't amen he appears when he wants to appear disappears when he wants to disappear right because that's his way he wants your faith to rest on the world not signs wers and miracles those things OCC but the rest on the world and when your fath rest on the word signs follow them that believe because the believer is now founded on the word and signs automatically follow you amen amen that right yes so we don't chase after that anymore we don't have to chase after it J whatever he Wills he'll do it praise God a blue sky he can send rain praise God hallelujah amen we resting on that are you amen I am I'm resting on that I have confidence in him and I'm resting on that praise the name of the Lord all right you are sealed till the day of redemption brother BR speaks about that in another message what was the Holy Ghost given for to make sure that your box car is sealed and that nobody break the seal and open it up and go and pill for anything and to make sure that that box car arrive safely to its destination amen is that right I'll give you another comforter but he will be with you amen amen he'll be even in you to the very end of the end he'll be in you you'll see that you get there praise God she I'm weak yeah but he is strong amen his strength is made perfect in weakness amen devil like to turn the eyes and magnify your weakness so that you will now go on to a spiritual complex where you start hiding on the bushes and hiding from your red but God is trying to tell you don't look at your complex look at your cir look at the big God that's with you that's working everything out amen no matter what comes in your way God is working things out he see through no matter what happens within your life God hallelujah amen hallelujah you see he said when you were born again you were filled with the spirit in the church AG book around page 151 to 157 he gives a wonderful uh talk there about many believe that when I say come and be filled with the holy spirit that I mean they must come up and speak with tongs or feel something come on them so they can have a shake or a shiver he says let me make it clear I mean come and be born again amen amen for to be filled with the Holy Spirit and to be saved Born Again gu one and the same thing hallelujah amen so I'm trying to make this clear to you what what's happening here it's a problem in the message it's a problem in the message the church world has that problem but let's not even deal with them they can't even handle that let's deal with it in the message the God said to one of the prophets glor ye the trumpet and let my people become aware praise God hallelujah listen now you see you can be begotten of the spirit but until you are born of the spirit preached the message many years ago we bought begotten but not yet born listen he said it's like this a baby is begotten in the mother's womb yeah and while it is in the mother's womb it's got a kind of a life see yes the cells in its body is tting kicking and jumping like that see but that's just a life that's laying there but when it's born and that doctor giv him a spike that he qu go that's when he become a living Soul that's the here amen he become a living Soul so you see there is a baby one that is begotten in the mother's womb yet M Hallelujah that's that one kind of a life and it is a life the little cells in his body is twisting and kicking around jumping around but when it is born then it squeals out and become a living Soul hallelujah amen now he's going to transition to the spiritual part of it see though that baby is in the womb that baby can go to church and even say to everyone I believe I believe I going to do this I'm going to work in the church I'm good I'm living right I want to do right I want to do right but what it needs is somebody to give it a good go of SP to wake it up for it to sque out to eternal life and for the Holy Spirit to scream inside of it glory amen amen hallelujah it it Scream the Holy Spirit scream in it like it has never has scream before in its life it's a new creature it's born of the spirit then it begins to grow and move and have its being in God see just as a baby natural baby has to be in this living world what is describing as what not three kinds of Believers let's dismiss the unbeliever but two kinds of Believers within the framework of the church another message he said will come to pass twins in the beginning twins in the End Amen is that right he said you can trace it through the entire Bible from Genesis where is SC and Abel and you come down you throw on the do and you go to Moses and and and those guys against him and then you come down to Jes and Ja against Moses and then you come come on up everywhere in the Bible you got to have that there all the time to come to Jesus there is Judas with Paul and these Breen that were with me you know that were ravening WS but right they were right there in the and everything else it's right like that it's being like that it's really it's the mystery of iniquity traveling along with the mystery of godliness at the same time is that right until we come to the end and then they go to the burning and we are caught up in the presence of God one goes down and the next one goes up by God's grace Hallelujah amen so we're talking about Believers people that are right in the message let it be 5 years 10 years 40 years but until the light breaks through I'm trying to explain un explainable until you CAU a genine revelation I know you going say what are you talking about Prophet said who can teach you to Desert who can tell you to dream a dream uh who can even get a dream of themselves God has to give it to you amen but you see if I preach healing then healings will break up if I preach the Holy Spirit then he has a chance to work with you amen right whatever the preacher is preaching on that becomes available to you at that particular time season and moment amen but now let a man woman examine themselves praise the Lord no matter how religious you are he says here he says no so you're in the message for so many many years but he saying there is two kinds begotten right and they have a Christian life even use the word Living God working in the church even said they believe everything else like that but they are missing what a spark amen there's a spark Hallelujah my I think I talked about this in many ways where some people just go around life and they just they're just going around like that and they have the other time to wake up in the morning they got to spark this like life is in got to get on the job my God even while they on the job you know you see guys walk around you know I got to talk construction because they walk around with their Hammer like that until one of them go bang bang and the old man say he said Jason I can't hear you are you using rubber Hammer cuz I can't hear a song The Hammer must be a sponge right but then you got all guys wow praise God my I've had them guys come to me and say come on man slow down man you're making things bad for us I said am I going to slow down I'm going to feel bad if I slow down I got I got to produce enough for the day or I don't want to feel bad you know but somewhere in there you got to find a medium though you know what I mean say you don't just show them off completely but the fact is Believers are like that they come to worship God they come to serve God they come to hear the word but they not uh and the words of Barack Obama they're not fired up and ready to go is that right you're not fired up you just come to listen I just come to church and hear what they have to say sorry oh my praise the Lord but I have to display that these are some of the attitudes and actions that the devil normalizes in the middle of the mess churches yes until people come become satis satisfied with themselves the Bible calls it self-satisfied Church satisfying with themselves you know and with their spirituality and their growth and and the other brothers are looking up to me now the other sisters are looking up to me so I must a little consciously think like that but the actions make you think that they believe now I've arrived at a point of spirituality and everything else of that nature but yet there's a spark missing amen when the spark is there it driv you to prayer amen when the spark is there it driv you in the house of God when that spark is there you want to be the first one that raise up your lightning R of them two holy hands you got to let the Holy Spirit strike you and go from your head to your to praise the Lord you're not scared I'm backing off and say my God I don't want to behave like that you know yeah you know because what it's not going to be you going be the holy spirit amen but I I I repeat again fair and pride are two of the greatest enemies of the modern Christian Christianity is all fear Pride concerned about how I'm going to look you know and my reputation being damaged you know because I you know you don't want to behave use a word there that most people wouldn't know sayal I us to use a word you know out of the way praise the Lord but he says that's it then it waks up it can scream freely it's a new creature it's born of the spirit hallelujah oh friends if this Earthly T not will be dissolved we have another one waiting you believe that amen praise God waiting yes he says even now when you've caught the first revelation you heard from your and it's just like a baby just before that child is born Prophet said the mother become sweet because the angel of that child was already circling yes waiting on that mother to deliver up that body so that that first or whatever yes right he says the same thing we are going the opposite way if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved why you think you're hungering and thirsty amen amen you heard from your theoy what's it telling you just as much as it was circling that natural mother waiting for it to be delivered the glorified body is start uh is revealing to you that part of the word that you are so you can fulfill your purpose and position Christ until the hour that you delivered up from here to there that's what's going on right now praise the Lord amen is that hard for you to believe brother praise the Lord that's not hard for me to believe us and for me to understand and that's what we're walking into everything we're doing now is super natural it appears natural appears simple but it's super natural walking right it amen praise the Lord you understand what I'm saying amen so that you will be just a Christian that's just living the Christian Life naturally amen you don't you don't have to put on ears you don't have to look spiritual you don't look deep you don't have to look like you're dedicated them and make up your face like you you know every minute of the day you're hearing a voice from Heaven what no you don't have to do that and walk around like that but you just the prophet said just go out and live praise the Lord amen just go out and live and be what God wants you to be be the person that you are Hallelujah you can't be live my life but you can live your own life amen and you shine forth because we are all part of that rainbow and the light the Revelation hitting the prism of my life may reflect a whole lot of colors from you and my reflect purple there the other one green or two colors out to one and three out to the next one we don't know amen hallelujah but when the light strikes you it produces something superal that's right amen the prophet said bricks scree Devils will scream and come home it's just that because you can't see brother brother um brother Aubrey hunt uh sent me a text that says brother I don't know what's happening something is going on I think this new year the Lord has something is doing going to do something wonderful he says you know uh in the last service I was in uh a lady came up for prayer given up by the doctor for cancer and has to go the on Monday morning to for them to operate and everything else and he says you know all these years we praying for people we praying for people until it become normal we just pray and you know you just pray and you trust the Lord you said that's all I did I pray and I just trust the Lord not thinking anything only to have my phone R the next morning the doctor and everybody wants to know what happened Glory when they take her there and they check the real all of the x-rays there's the cancel the x-rays but when they look at the woman there is no cancer hallah Hallelujah the woman was delivered from a death sentence Hallelujah they not together you're going to die but God says hallu the true than he was W from my transgress BR for my iniquities the chastisement of his peace was upon us and by his upon him and by his chist we were healed heal receive and believe praise the name of the Lord Jesus hallelujah amen so we are in the same position right now he says what is it we are gring we are crying why we in the womb gring l in getting old sickness everything Bes setting sin Spirit on the inside of it looking what he said it's looking to get out of there for it's looking at a land beyond the river hallelujah praise the Lord you know when you are looking way up the road at the land beyond the river there you're not noticing all these other little skirmishes of the devil around you down here because your eyes are fixed far away on that land Beyond right it's not that you're not going to be aware that is happening around you but you are focused on the land beyond the river hallelujah praise God so he's saying that in this life we are like that baby in the mother's womb or like in the dark room being developed and while we are there we kick him we screaming we're car on this is happening that is happen but he said that's the very sign right to the point where we soon getting the hour to be delivered and if this Tabernacle be dissolved we have another one way a supernatural one circling around you right now get you ready for the Rapture Hallelujah when you caught that first revelation he said you just heard from your Toopy amen your theophany oh my so your your angel the angel of your life praise God not brother br angel your angel that's right praise they call it Go Angel but your angel praise the Lord you heard from your theop praise God hallelujah and that one will stay with you and make sure that you make it on the other side hallelu is that right Hallelujah because then you are it's Born Again In You And You Are Born Again In Praise the Lord hallelujah amen amen amen praise the Lord yes sir oh my so the spiritual body the Earth will drop and the body natural will drop and the celestial body will then grab it see if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved oh my oh see we have one already wait him that's the reason you forget the things of the world because you are going de to that Hallelujah but there is the holy spirit for you all that child have to come up for air when it gets born right the holy spirit is waiting for us amen the full total Deliverance amen is that right Deliverance you're delivered you're saved you're being saved and you will totally be saved at the Rapture Hallelujah you're saved from the sin committed by Adam just by being born God saved you from that sin by the power of the blood but then you save from that and every day we are walking we committing our own sins so every day you are being saved it's the three tenses of Salvation past present and future is that right amen and then when you come through this everyday thing where we are being saved from the from the very uh Power of sin amen from Adam we saved from the penalty of sin forget that you're not going hell anymore but now we have being saved from the power of sin the Temptation that's the sin's power Temptation and every day God has to save us from that right but then when the Rapture comes and he takes you out of here he's taking you out and saving you from the presence of sin and then if you're in a L beyond the river where there is no uh Power to tempt there is no presence of sin there is no penalty that's you have to worry about anymore don't you see how you can live through the endless ages forever and forever and forever amen don't forget what I just said remember that save from the power of sin amen the penalty of Sin from Adam the power of sin in the present time and then you will be saved from the presence of sin that is actually what brother BR was teaching when he preached on total Deliverance is that right you're delivered yes from Adam's sin but you still have to be delivered as you walk as a Christian every day from the sins that you're committing yourself right and The Temptations you have to overcome but even if you do that as long as you live on this Earth even if you live a thousand years like mat you will still be caught in that uh Twilight Zone of the power of sin always coming at you so he couldn't leave us here so he's not he's going to take you now not just from the penalty of the power but from the very presence of it so that's when you go you are totally free and that is the state of total Deliverance amen is that right praise the Lord so that's what we're talking about amen hallelujah praise the name of the Lord Jesus what a wonderful day for you and what a wonderful time for me amen that this word has come and the word has open our eyes of our heart and of our mind so we can recognize what God is actually doing Hallelujah remember when I was a boy I always wanted why doesn't my father comes home on Friday afternoon and he gots PID I don't see you know he should be bringing home a nice bag of chocolates poor man have a family can take care of you don't know nothing about that yet he has to focus on his family but you're a kid all you're thinking about is getting chocolates and and stuff of that nature is that right and that's the same way with us until God opened our eyes and we start to become really responsible Christians and we start to recognize oh that's why he couldn't spend his money on those chocolates right cuz now you you're not going to just spend your money on chocolates so the old folks says don't worry you're coming later on you're going to find out and then you're going to understand but even though I try to explain it to you now you might not understand but when you actually get the situ situation you I will have to tell you nothing you going to absolutely know what it is all about and that's what the Holy Spirit wants us to know amen see now watch this he says watch as we move the Holy Ghost himself is the new birth Hallelujah don't ever forget that amen hallelujah yes you didn't just got born again because you repent no you didn't got born again just because you got baptized with one sir repent and you shall be and you shall receive the Holy Ghost amen you get baptized with Name Lord you receive the Holy Ghost it's the new birth the Holy Ghost himself is your new birth amen because now you as a natural being is born into a spiritual realm hallelujah amen you're born into a spiritual realm and he puts you into a new dimension gives you a new mind and continues to change your mind yes renew your mind every day by his power to transform glory amen God's power to transform goes into action amen the Holy Spirit comes and he begins to transform you amen he begins to see things different amen even your hearing is changed amen Prophet said your soul changed didn't it amen amen your your whole outl at sin changed didn't it amen amen amen he says you're already in the resurrection Glory because you're already to be in changed Hallelujah resurrected listen the Holy Ghost is the new birth we know that it's being born again of the spirit of God he gave birth to you how you born is by the spirit you are born in the thir by the spirit for he's my mother my father my sister and my brother he's everything to you are born of the spirit amen not born of your mother born of the spirit praise the Lord you are a son or daughter of the spirit and Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit Hallelujah because that's where what he becomes your guide your teacher just like your mother your father did Prophet preach that in leadership they do that naturally for a while but because your your father or your spiritual mother is the holy ghost He said you go let them you go into the hands of your mother your father and then later on you'll end up in the hands of a pastor and then in that state the pastor is giving you the word but you the holy spirit in you starts sing you and guide you amen is that right praise the Lord wonderful glory to his wonderful name see oh my all right you are begotten of the spirit but then when you are born of the spirit you are filled with the Holy Ghost this stuff will sound so funny to Believers of this message um boy that again I was called a lot of names when seventh years the Holy Spirit spoke and says out of the book of Acts I was reading one day Paul asked have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe you remember that was was it the AP one of them asks 19 Acts 19 have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe so it's not the believing but since you believe but then of course the Holy Spirit asked me that question so that I needed to know that I didn't have the Holy Ghost on the Pentecost he said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe this message amen that's right that's how you ask the question have you received the Holy since you believe this message amen not that mother Pentecost thing amen but the spirit of God that will travel
