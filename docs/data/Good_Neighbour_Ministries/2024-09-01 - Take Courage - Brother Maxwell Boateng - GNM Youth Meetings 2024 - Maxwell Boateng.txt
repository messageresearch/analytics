but we shall love the Lord with all our hearts how many happy to be here this morning amen well let's take our Bibles this morning amen let's go to the Book of Joshua amen and and we just as we close this meeting just encourage one another amen the Book of Joshua we read from Joshua chapter 1 we read from verse one to verse 9 and then we'll go to Joshua chapter 3 and we'll read from verse 5 to verse 7 amen man Joshua chapter 1 from verse 1 to verse 9 and the Bible says name after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake onto Joshua the son of non Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore AR rise go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which he do gave to them even to the children of Israel every BL that the soil of your F shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even onto the Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the HTO and onto the great sea towards the going down of the sun shall be your cast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of your life as he was with Moses so will I be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of a good courage For unto these people shall they devoid foreign inheritance the land which we swear unto their fathers to give to to give them only be th strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all that law all the law which Moses my servant commanded the turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that th mayest Prosper with whoever they goest this book of the Lord shall not depart a of thy M but thou shall meditate there in day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shall make th way prosperous and then thou shall have good success have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage Be not Afraid neither be th dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee with r they ghost chapter 3 verse 5 to 7 and Joshua said unto the people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you and Joshua spake unto the priest saying take up the Ark of the Covenant and pass over before the people and they took up the Ark of the Covenant and went before the people and the Lord said unto Joshua this there will began to magnify the in the sight of all Israel that they may know that o he was with Moses so I will be with thee amen may the Lord add his Blessing to the reason of the word you you may have you seat amen this day we already began to magnify thank you brother Danny L began to magnify myself inde the amen amen if you want to take a title amen as we come to the close of these meetings and if something I just want to encourage you young people with as as you leave these meetings and you go on to to carry on in life and some of you going back to school some of you going going to you and in anyway I just want to you know take a title to sa and saying take courage take courage amen don't take sorrow don't take sadness amen don't don't don't take disappointments don't take failures but take courage amen take courage amen as you read in the scripture amen is is a scene amen is a par to the journey the children of Israel amen and and the children of Israel had come to a point in their Journey where there was there was something happening amen and and and what was happening was that there was being a transfer of authority amen Authority was being transferred at this moment of the Journey of the children of Israel amen responsibility was being transferred at this moment of the Journey of the children of Israel amen Jehovah was going to take another vessel to continue on his work now this did not mean that all the work that Jehovah had done in Moses was had to be discredited are you with me amen the work that the Lord had done in Moses was not to be discredited but God was just going to take another vessel and continueing the same work amen so he was just passing the authority from Joshua's hand into the hand from Moses hands into the hands of Joshua that someone else was going to take this baton and was going to continue to run the rest amen what he was saying that it is not over with Moses amen but as Moses is going to step off the scene someone is going to carry on with the work of Moses amen are you with me so he was saying listen this is not over yet amen there there is more to come amen and there is more that I want to do with you but but there was something that he told Joshua amen is said Joshua you're going to prosper you're going to go ahead and you're going to take the land and you're going to do all this but there are certain things that are very key as you go on to continue in your position of authority and he told Joshua as you go on one thing I want you the few things I want you to keep and and he started to list them down and he said one thing Joshua I want you to do is observe all the law which Moses commanded you as you go forth observe all the law that Moses commanded you and he said don't turn from it to the left or to the right amen and again he said to him you know don't let this message that Moses had brought to you depart from d amen and he said now meditate upon it day and night amen so so these are Commandments that the Lord has given Joshua as he's passing the authority to him to say now that you are going forward meditate upon the word amen now that you going forward don't let the word that Moses has brought to you depart amen now that you are going forward observe these Commandments that has been given to you by the Lord amen and and and as you do these things stand strong amen as you do these things don't be discouraged stand strong be courageous actually he said be very courageous amen be very courageous amen be very courageous Don't Be Afraid don't be dismayed why because the Lord your God is going to be with you amen he was telling them as was with Moses I am going to be with you so don't be discouraged don't be afraid no matter what comes your way don't back down but take courage amen take courage because the same God that was with Moses is going to be with you amen be strong amen Never Back Down don't be afraid of anything that the enemy tried to bring to you just be courageous be because God is with you amen the god of the prophet of this age he's saying is going to be with you so don't be afraid young person no no matter what whether you were in school whether you at work wherever you are at he's saying don't be afraid because the God of Wars with Moses is going to be with you no wonder in the scriptures you know Psalm chapter 1 to verse 8 David will speak and he said if I Ascend into heaven Thou Art there if I make my bed in hell behold thou are there so David is catching a revelation to say listen no matter where I go the Lord is going to be with me amen no matter what situation or your man the Lord is going to be with me let me say to you a young person you're going to live this place you're still going to be facing battles you're going to live this place and the enemy is going to try all he can listen the battle is not over yesterday we came and and the Lord showed us how we're going to be able to face this battle and overcome the enemy but this doesn't mean that he not going to come against you amen you know the scripture will tell us that you know he he will encamp against you he will come against you but he can actually battle against he can't overcome you so as you live in this place the battle will continue there will be days that you will be in a valley amen there will be days that you feel like you are in a valley but don't you worry because in that Valley the Lord is still with you because if the Lord can descend all the way to hell and even there in Hell David is saying you will not live me then I tell you when you are in the valley of Life the Lord is still with you amen if you're on a mountain top the Lord is still with you if you're in a trial the Lord is still with you if you're in a battle the Lord is still with you the Lord is never going to leave you neither is he ever going to forsake you amen no matter where you're at as he was with Moses so is he going to be with you so take courage young person no matter what the situation is remember the Lord is with me amen the Lord is with me brother Brandon will say God keeps his word and said the Lord thy God is with thee where wherever they goes is said no matter what it is how hard it is how great the obstacle is that doesn't matter if it's then through the valley of the shadow of death the Lord thy God is with thee whether soever thou goest amen wherever you go the Lord is with you now now you know we we we know very well the story that we reading about and and we know the journey that we've been through and and how you know Moses you know had a burning bush experience amen Moses Moses had a burning bush experience and after that burning bush experience he he went forth to Egypt to deliver God's people amen he went forth to deliver God's people to bring them out of the bondage that they were in Amen to bring the m and move them on to the promised land that was that was given to them now now we know this this might seem you know maybe you know some sometimes young people feel that it's hard but it's not hard amen now the ministry of Moses amen the ministry of Moses is a type of the ministry of the prophet of this age are you with me young people the prophet of this age came to bring you out of your bondage not him but the message he brought came to bring you out of the bondage that you were in amen maybe you say well I was born in a believer's home okay amen but your parents might have been in a denomination or or might have been somewhere in the world or whatever it is but there was a message that brought the made from where they where amen now remember on the journey childr were born and they were born in other words in the message amen but before they came on the scene there were some people that were brought out from the bondage of the world Amen so so the prophet the message of the hour came to call out a broad amen and as he called out the broad and called out your parents and you were born in that family listen God had it all planned it that you will be born in that family but will talk about one in a million listen there were many that could have showed up but you showed up amen you showed up amen because you were part of the program of God Amen you young people are part of the program of God and so you know in this journey as your parents were delivered from the bondage so have you also been delivered amen and has been brought out and is on this journey and we know that brother brandham not only did he fulfill the Moses commission but he also fulfilled the Joshua Commission in that he brought us also into the land of promise amen so so as Moses brought the mid and at a certain point the authority changed and Joshua carried them on into the land now you've learned this in Sunday school have you know young people right so so so as he carried them on into now this promised land was Joshua doing and the prophet did the same now the prophet brought us into the land and then he told us now the Joshua that is going to lead you is going to be the Holy Ghost amen now it's going to be the Holy Ghost young people that is saying is going to lead you to possess every portion of the land that you are in are you with me young people all right so so the prophet brings a message it brings out your parents you're part of it amen and now you were growing and you come to a place that you understand oh there is a land that we're going to amen you understand there is a land that we're going to and in this land there are lots of promises and the Lord is saying this promises is not only for your parents you can have them too listen when they got into the land it wasn't only the parents eating the grapes you understand it wasn't just the PE parents you know having the noise honey the kids were having it too they were eating of the land of the fruit of the land amen it was their possession amen now we know that Joshua was a type of the natural amen I just want to lay some Foundation just so so we all on the same page and and then we keep we start moving on Amen but you see when when they got in the land amen and we know that Israel was was a type of the natural amen and so Israel as a type of the natural they get into this land and they had a promise of a natural land amen and this land was promised to them by their father Abraham that one day they were going to you know be in bondage but delivered and be moved into a land that flowed with milk and honey right and so all this is happening but this was in the natural and we know that the natural always will Tye something in the spiritual amen so just ask they were the Seed of Abraham in the natural so are you the Seed of Abraham in the spiritual amen now now just listen to the scripture here in Galatians Galatians chapter 3:29 says and if ye aboid if ye be in Christ ye are then ye are then are ye Abraham's seed and hairs according to the promise amen so if you aboid in Christ amen if you've received the baptism of the Holy Ghost then you are also a Seed of Abraham and HS to the promise amen now we know that a promise that we are Airs of is also a land that we'll get to one day amen that that is that is you know when we get raptured but while we are here there is also a promise given to us in this land that we in and the promise is the word of God Amen the promised land that we have today as young people that we can go and eat anything in it and take whatever we want from it is the word of God we can take that word of God and whatever we have need of we can believe it and receive it amen that is the promised land that now we have received amen so are you all with me up until now amen we're just laying down some few foundations amen so in the word of God we will find Salvation amen and so as a young person as you growing up you begin to learn in the word of God oh I can be saved amen and so what do you do you say byy faith are we saved okay so you begin to believe and what are you doing you are eating of the land amen and you give your heart to the Lord and you save and you hear about the baptism of the Holy Ghost you hear about sanctification and all these things and you taking all these what you were eaten the fruits of the land then you get sick then you hear oh so I can be healed because the scripture said boy his St some more healed and so you can take that promise now in that land and believe it and it'll manifest in your life as a young person amen are you with me to say it this morning amen you you can have Deliverance you can have whatever you need but there was something that was intered in this land listen God has given them the land he said here it is you go take it whatever you want you take it but they had to fight for every inch of gr that they wanted you see young person you're going to have to fight for every inch of ground amen every inch of ground just as they fought so are we going to fight brother Bram says that God's word is the turn up God's just as obligated to keep to to his word to heal you as he is to save you is that it's this word that promised it it's God's word and we have no right to take away from it but just say it's the truth believe it no matter what happens believe it anyhow that's the way the rest of them had to believe it and we are not excl excluded from that God gave Palestine to Israel but they had to fight for every inch of ground they got the promise is yours but you have to void for every inch to claim it the devil will see to that certainly he will so the devil is going to try all he can to stop you from taking your promise but it is yours and that is what you need to catch here you need to catch that this is mine you know when I was a kid you know I love cars you know and so I'll have these little cars and you know you go driving around and you know and you have your friends right and and and you go and you playing with your cars and you know there's always that word guy among your friends right that he always want to play with your toys and it's like no this is mine toy and he's trying to take it away and you're like no I'm not going to give it to you and the fight begins and no this is mine and and at the end of the day well if mommy was to show up or Daddy was to show up he was going to get okay listen this is your toy so you have it this is yours and so you have it so so the battle is Raging with fighting amen but ddy come and he said but but wait a minute listen devil this is for him so you you live it live it alone so that is the same thing here there are promises in the word you will take but it's a battle the enemy is trying to say no it's not yours but the scripture said it is yours Daddy bought for you listen that bicycle is mine daddy bought is M bicycle you can't have M bicycle you know what amen and so you need to F forward and say this is mine and I am taking it amen I am taking it because it is mine so every promise in the book Is Ours but the devil is going to try all he can to try to keep us from us the promise of Deliverance is ours the promise of Freedom Is Ours but the enemy is going to do all he can to try to keep us away from the freedom and the Deliverance listen yesterday I believe that the Lord came by your way ministered to us delivered Hearts set free filled with the Holy Ghost but you're going to walk out of here and the enemy is going to come and try to steal that away from you try to bind you again in the same change that you were in before you came to the meetings but I'm here to tell you take courage young person because the Lord your God is with you and this is a promise that God has given to you and you don't need to back down from it amen you don't need to back away from it because God has paid the price and has given it to you and when the enemy come you have every right of say to say this is mine this is mine property and you have no right to pull it away from me are you with me this morning amen you have every right to take it away from the enemy brother BR must say when it comes to Healing he said your healing remains as long as you believe it he said it's just as the same as your salvation as long as you believe you're saved you are saved amen so your salvation is as long as you believed and if you're healing as well as as long as you believe then I believe your deliverance is also as well as long as you believe so if you believe that you delivered and you keep holding on it it it is going to last forever if you believe that you're free and you hold on it it's going to last forever amen because now no one can talk you out of your salvation are you with me no one can talk you out of your salvation no one can say that you are not saved you know that you are saved because it's a revelation to you so you can take your deliverance and believe it the same way that I know that I am delivered because the word said so amen and you don't need to back away from it amen just as much as you believe yourself you can believe you have the Holy Ghost and the enemy can say anything the better it you can believe you're free and the enemy can do anything better it because once it become a revelation that's why brother Brandon was saying the church age it is so important that Revelation is so important because that's what Satan can battle against amen so once you believe it the enemy can't battle against it amen man but there is where the F comes in but you know what the scripture does tell us that we'll have to F for every inch of ground but you know the amazing part of it this is that you and not the one doing the F it you know many times when we hear about it we need to fight for every inch of ground we misinterpret it and we think that I have to fight but the battle is not yours the battle is the Lord's and I want you to cast this young people because Satan wants you to fight he wants you to fight he wants you to get in a wrestling match with him because he know so far as it is you he can defeat you but the battle is not yours the battle is the Lord he is the one that is here to fight for you so when Satan is coming trying to get you Deo you know in the middle of the anoint and he comes in your room and trying to pull your thoughts into certain things that not supposed to go into now you can try to F that and be like no I'm not going to do this you know man I tell you I'm not going to do this I'm going to pull my phone away man tell you and you can go I'm going to put my phone in the I'm going to put it in the in the sitting room and I'm going to go in the bedroom and you trying to f yourself and the enem is just there and they just keep keep pondering and you're like man you know no maybe I just watch this little T you see you were fighting it but if you if you just came and you said to him listen devil I am free because God told me I am free the scripture says that he that the soon set free is free indeed I know you believe it or am free so you just walk away listen he's just going to be okay sorry he just going to walk because he said resist the devil and he shall flee so when he comes and you begin to resist him with the word according to the scripture he has to flee it's just as simple as that you see the enemy is trying to complicate the word and complicate every it is not complicated it is just that simple you just take that one word that one stone is good enough he has to flee because the word says so are you with me young people so take take courage as you living take courage take that word and rap the devil like never before amen as I'm saying the battle is not yours but the battle is the Lord's you see one time the the children of Israel you know they were devoided there was Judah and Israel and so Judah was was under it came a point where King Jehoshaphat was the one that was laid in Judah and as king Jehoshaphat was leading Judah there came an invasion the Moa boys the AR and the people from Mere invaded the land of Judah and they wanted to take it and so Jehoshaphat is looking at the situation and and he knows that if he says I am going to go to battle with these people there's no way I'm going to win there are three against just this little Judah so we know if I try to go for them I'm not going to win and so Jehoshaphat a righteous man said okay I'm going to go to the Lord and place this battle before him and so Jehoshaphat goes and pray and pray and seek the face of the Lord and as he's seeking the face of the Lord the Lord hears his prayer and comes with an answer to the prophet of that age who was jahzel and he speaks to jhazel these words and tells jhazel to go and tell the king the king Jehoshaphat these words and he said hearen ye all Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem this is 2 Chronicles 20:15 he said hearken ye all all ye Judah and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem and th King Jehoshaphat thus sayeth the Lord unto you be Not Afraid nor dismayed by the reason of this great multitude amen for the battle is not yours but the battle is the Lord's amen that's what he told the king Jehoshaphat Don't Be Afraid don't be this made of the great multitude that is gathered around you you're going to live this place and there's going to be a multitude that is going to try to gather around you but he's saying don't be afraid because the battle is not yours but the battle is the Lord's and you know how they overcame that battle you know they went to this battle and you know King Jehovah said to them listen the Lord told us that the battle is not ours but the battle is the Lord so you know all that we're going to do is f we're just going to sing we're just going to praise the Lord and as they began to praise the Lord as they began to lifts up the their Salter and lifts up their trumpets and they just began to sing and they just began to praise the Lord listen young person when you get into that bondage when you get into the place where the enemy is trying to close you in you lift up your voice voice and begin to praise the Lord you lift up your voice and begin to Worship the Lord because as the the children of Judah began to Worship the Lord and began to praise the Lord the scripture says that the enemies Tor against each other and they began to destroy themselves listen that's what is going to happen to your enemy when you begin to praise God in your darkness when you begin to praise God in your trial when you begin to praise God in the Battle of your Fai Reon your enemies will turn against each other take courage young person the battle is not yours the battle is the Lord's when you begin to worship oh Hallelujah when you begin to worship I want you to notice something listen Joshua as we read in the scriptures he was the one that was told to go and into the land and defeat the enemy listen he was the one that was told that everywhere the soul of your feet shall tread that have were given unto you and so Joshua they cross over this Jordan Joshua gets over there now Joshua is thinking man this is a Great Commission how am I going to tear down all these enemies I've been told that everywhere the soul of my foot are tread I believe the word of God but mine this is going to beire a battle because man I'm going to have to face these enemies but all of a sudden Joshua started look and he saw a man standing over there and Joshua said but who is that man and Joshua said mine and he pulled out his sword and he start to face this man and say who is this man and the man was looking and he stood steady as he walked towards Joshua and he said who are you are you for us are you against us and the man said to him listen I am the captain of the host of the Lord and I have come to fight your battle for yeah listen Joshua is the one that received the commission but when he got into the land he wasn't the one doing the fight he wasn't the one doing the fighting it was the captain of the host of the Lord that was doing the fight brother Bram said that the captain had already been there and he has gone and weakened the foundations of the walls of Jericho are you with me he had gone and weakened the foundations of the walls of Jericho listen your captain as so already gone before you that day at Calvary he weakened every foundation of the enemy he weakened every foundation of the enemy and he said on that cross it is finished it is [Applause] finished and it said now you go and possess the land because it's not your battle but it is the captain that is called to fight for you oh Hallelujah this this is not your battle but it's the Lord oh hallelujah oh glory be to God amen amen you're the one that is commissioned well you're not the one fighting but it is the holy ghost that is fing for you listen to this quote in adoption brother Bram said our Ephesian our Joshua which is the holy spirit are you with me our easan our Jos which is the holy spirit it said Joshua means Jesus Savior it said Joshua means the Holy Spirit representing it in the spiritual as that was in the natural that he is our great warrior he is he is our great leader as God was with Joshua so is God in the Holy Spirit moving us AED amen as he was in Jos so is he by the Holy Spirit moving you about fighting your battles so when the battle come young person take courage because this is not you facing the enemy but it's the Holy Ghost in you that is here to face the enemy and F your battles for you amen take courage young person amen though you may be the one that has to go and take the Bible and read because you have to do it amen as a Son of God you have to read your Bible you will be the one that will have to go on your knees and pray you'll be the one that will have to come to church and sit in the Pew and listen to the sermon you going to be the one that will have to go and take the message and Press Play and play that message and PLU it in your ears you are the one that is going to have to do all that but the one that is going to be F in your battle is not you it is the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost in you as you listen to that word as you listening to that tape as you reading that scripture as you sitting in the Pew the Holy Ghost is getting fed the Holy Ghost is getting strength to fight your battles what is the Holy Ghost doing he's taking the word that you were listening to and it's turning it into a revelation to you because it is the Revelation that would defeat the enemy at any place at any time at any season in any situation oh Hallelujah it is not you fon but you're going to have to listen to the message you're going to have to feed because listen let me say this do you as you live this place this a scripture I think in Matthew chapter 7 and it talks about how the enemy will come back and you come to check that room you come to see is that room filled or is that room empty and when it comes and it finds that room empty he's not going to come in but he's going to go back to hell and he's going to take seven more demons that are stronger than him and they're going to come into that house and it says the state of that man will be worse than what it was before but if the enemy comes and he finds that place filled up with the Holy Ghost with the power of God with the fire of God listen he's got some news to take back to Hell listen he go run down to Hell listen folks that young lady man I tell you I don't know what happened to him he went to went he went to he he he went to Toronto I went to Toronto I don't know what happened over there but boy he's got such a power he's got such a fire I tell you be like no okay you know what we we'll back off over we're going to back off over you know we we just keep keep a watch from a distance you know it looks like he's taking another part listen he can be so filled with the power of God brother B say Satan doesn't know what to do with you he doesn't know what to do with you he tries every corner he can't get in he try with there Trace with that he just can't get in what in a world do I do with this person because the ha is filed and someone is fighting your battles for you is not you fighting the battles but you see when the the Holy Ghost get in there there'll be moments that it's going to tell you it's time to go to pray now you're going to have to be obedient to what it tells you to do if it tells you go to pray go to pray if it tells you take your Bible and read take your Bible and read if you're going on a certain website and it's saying don't go there don't go there you're going to have to obey the Holy Ghost he's your captain listen it wasn't Joshua Fen it was the captain Fen he's your captain what he tells you is what you do listen if we were to go in a battle and our captain told us listen folks we're not going to attack in the next four minutes I need you all to stay here and you were like oh listen Captain I I don't want to listen to you and you walked away on the battlef you'll be killed but you're going to have to listen to your captain and if it tells you to read read if it tells you to pray pray if it tells you listen to the tape listen to the tape you do what it tells you to do do you know what he's doing he's fting your battles he's fting your battles as you go to pray he's fting your battles as you go to read the Bible he's fighting your battles take courage young person he's fighting your battle Hallelujah he's fighting your battle you have to obey him and allow him to fight your battle because then I'll come upon you that Holy G will begin to stare up the sense of faith that is on the inside of you and we know that faith is a revelation and then you begin to catch a revelation of who you are and as you begin to catch a revelation of who you are you walk out with with confidence you walk here with confidence you go boldly to wherever you go no and there's no demon in hell that can have a hold of me you know one time we we there's a sister back in Edmonton and he doesn't fellowship with us but but I happened to be fellowshipping with her one time we got it a little bit as a group and and you know this sister you know she she she she the Lord tou her heart recently and she used to be in witchcraft deep into Witchcraft and so we were sitting with her and we said listen would you mind sharing your testimony with me and so she began to tell us and different things and and what she would do as as as a Witchcraft and things that she would dop incredible honestly I was like wow that's that's quite what you can do with the power of the devil that's that's interesting but you know what she she said one time she said when I gave my heart to the Lord I began to to walk with the Lord she said when I was in witchcraft she said when I walked down on the street I had power as a witch it wasn't a remember yesterday we said were two Powers there the power of God and the power of the enemy and brother brandham said that the power of the enemy is real is a real power is the true power that's what brother brandham said so this woman said I had power when I walked down the street because I knew I I I could do whatever and I began to think if she can walk down the street with the power of the enemy and feel like she's got power and that is the lowest power that is ever here on the earth then what can a Believer do when he's got the power of God on the insert of them amen what kind of authority are we to have when we walking down the street with the power of God on the inser of us oh hallelujah hallelujah listen you've got more power than you think you have but you're going to have to allow the Holy Ghost to exercise that power because you know as we said yesterday God's confidence is not in your flesh or in your spirit but it's in the holy ghost that is on the inside of you that's why he's saying to you this morning take courage and Be not Afraid why because how can God Be Afraid God is courageous God is bold and he's the one that is in you Bo the Holy Spirit that's why this morning is saying to you take courage amen take courage amen and as he said to us for there shall not be any man be able to stand before bodyy all the days of your life from this moment on there shall not be any enemy that is going to be able to stand before thee if the Holy Ghost is in there the enemy is going to battle against you sure he will but he won't be able to Prevail we heard it yesterday if he didn't Prevail in heaven he can't Prevail here but you need to have the same God the same Michael that fought in heaven in you for him to fight for you you do you get a young people amen are you with me this this morning we're just laying down some few Foundation Ju Just So that we are we we get it that we go here with with boldness and and and and with confidence to know that we are Sons and Daughters of God so let me say this let's take courage this morning young people it is for you to awake the Jesus that's been Laing in your boat amen it is time to awake him L listen for so long he's been lying there you know just waiting he's just waiting for someone to say Jesus I am perishing it is time to awake Jesus in your boat amen he's been laying dormant for so long but awake him and he's going to calm every storm that you will face amen he can calm every storm that you face but you're going to have to wake Jesus in the boat amen iwake him in the boat allow the Holy Ghost to begin to fight for you that is how you awake Jesus in the boat when it begins to F fire in the form of the Holy Ghost because you know one Church the only way that this Holy Ghost is going to fail is When sin comes in and is unconfessed because the only time that the children of Israel lost the battle was when aen went and took some Babylonian garments he with me young people when he went and took some Babylonian garment and did not confess it and and thought he can hide it then he began to lose battles young people don't go taking any Babylonian garments from the world don't go taking any other entertainments from the world because there is where you're going to begin to lose your battles because just aen just aen you say but it was just aen all the other people are righteous but just aen but yet JS aen because of what he did they lost 16 men but they were told that they they were not supposed to lose even one man in any battle but just because of a nakan just because of some lustful Spirit or just because of some worldly fashion that you begin to entertain just because of that you begin to lose your battles you begin to open yourself up for the enemy to come in you say but but but it's just you know it's on the borderline listen don't stay on the borderline if you going in for God go all the way young person don't go pick up some worldly stuff and put it on here and and thinking it's pretty it's not pretty it's not pretty in the eyes of God that's why the prophet of God came in this age and he blasted all these wlon he blasted makeup he blasted all these kind of things listen it wasn't brother brandom's ideas about it God didn't like it God didn't like it listen don't go taking those G and then you wonder why can I not be free why can I not receive when I'm in the church why is it that the word can't be real because you're holding on a Babylonian garment and that is hindering the spirit of God from moving and and having the preeminence in your life and you losing your battles because of the Babylonian garment you see said but it's just a garment it's just something normal that I just put on my nails or what and it's just not but it's still a Babylonian G God doesn't want it young people don't go picking up the tense of the world it'll cause you to lose your battles just aching just that little 10 people are dying don't pick up those things young people take courage don't pick them up you say I don't know how to give it up it's not your battle it's God's battle if you can surrender it to God and say God I know that this is not pleasing to you however I am having a hard time laying it down please help me listen we just have to be honest listen if you needed help from daddy you just go and say Dad I can't fix this can you please help me fix it and Dy be sure and you take it and there you go if you're struggling with something that you know it's not right and you can't give it up I know it's not easy just go to Daddy and tell him listen I know this is not right I can't give it up can you please help me and daddy is not going to be like go away no Daddy's going to be like listen okay I'm going to help you out I'm going to help you to overcome because the battle is not yours I know you're weak I know you you you you caught up in I'm going to help you out I'm going to fight a battle for you take it away from you it's not a big deal young people you just have to go and tell the Lord it is that simple it is that simple young people that Babylonian garment alone C the paper to lose but remember this I want I want to read this code I want to read this code and we'll just take a few more T and then will begin to wind down but I want to read this quote of how God sees you brother brandham says the invisible Union of the bride of Christ is that he the bre took away your shame and put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the world and the blood of life that's what the Bible said your first husband that you were married to the world you know some of us is still go you know boy man listen young people I I love you I

your Purity you can go back to the love of the Lord you can go back to a consecrated life you can go back to a fellowship with God because the trumpet of Jubilee has sounded for a young person this is your season this is your time you don't have to be going around on the S anymore the trumpet sounded it was up to the slave to walk away if he wanted to stay there well then he was going to borrow a a hole in his year and he became a slave forever but listen I believe there are no young people here that are ready to say listen borrow a ho in my year because I want to stay here I believe every young person here in these meetings is saying if the trumpet has sounded if my Day Has Come For Freedom if my day has come for the baptism of the Holy Ghost then I am taken and I am living this place completely and totally delivered and free amen because your trumpet are sound your Jubilee it is your hour go back to your inheritance go back to the word and you can take any promise in there and use it to you to to the glory of the Lord hallelujah oh Hallelujah but listen you're going to have to feed that experience you're going to have to feed that experience because anything you don't feed will die you take a plant you don't feed it it will die whatever you take that you don't feed it will die listen could you imagine a whole bunch of soldiers that are six foot tall and they've got lots of muzzles and they took them in the Army and they did not feed them they didn't give them to drink listen and they would have no strength to fight any battle and listen you've got the captain on the inside of you you've got the Holy Ghost an army of God on the inside of you ready to fight your battle but you're going to have to feed that army that is on the inside of you and the Army feeds on the word of God and when you begin to feed on the word of God you're giving strength to your army you're giving strength to your soldiers to be able to face any enemy that will try to come your way oh it is your Jubilee trumpet but you're going to have to feed that experience you're going to have to feed that experience listen young people I want you to understand something you are living in the season of the SH now I'm going to take this this portion and I pray that the Lord will grant us a revelation of it because this is such an important 10 because if you catch this young people oh I believe it's going to help you I believe that it's going to help because it's helped me amen because we know that the captain of the host is here amen the captain of the host is here he's here to fight your battles for you amen listen No Matter What Comes Your Way situation circumstance whatever it is your God is greater your great your God is mighty your God is stronger he's more than able to overcome amen but now you are living in a season of a sh now I just want to read just this scripture here in Thessalonians first 1 Thessalonians 4:16 I want you to follow me young people for a minute it is not complicated all right but I want you to follow me because made it really helped me and I think it'll help some young people here but now listen 1 Thessalonians 4:16 it says for the Lord himself sh the S the sand from heaven with a shout with a voice of an archangel and with a trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise amen now brother brand will tell us that the sh is the message of the hour amen the sh is the message of the hour so the message that we've received is the first part of that scripture the shout that is gone forth are you with me young people is the sh that is gone forth that is the message of the hour that you have received now I want you to notice something when the children of Israel got into the land of promise they faced an obstacle and that was the walls of Jericho are you with me young people they face the walls of Jericho now when they face the walls of Jericho now as I told you Joshua God there and met the captain of the host of the Lord amen and the captain of the host of the Lord told them listen if you want to tear down these walls that I have already weakened you're going to have to begin to March around these walls are you with me young people you're going to have to begin to March around these walls amen and so he said you're going to March around seven times are you with me young people you're going to March around it seven times now if we were going to bring that into the message of the hour those seven times represented seven Church ages are you with me young people you've heard that before right it represented seven Church ages so when they went marching around the wall the first time that was the Ephesian Church age when they went marching around the second time there was the smina church age and then the Philadelphia Church age and the toara church age and the Sardis Church age and then the oh sorry I think I messed up somewhere but then you have the Philadelphia Church age which was Wesley amen so March around how many time six times now on the seventh time which was the lean Church age which you are in now are you with me young people the Lan Church AG that you young people are in now and at this seven time the seven moment they had to go and March around it and not seven times on the seventh time that they March around it so the first day they just did one round second day one round third day one round fourth day one round fifth day one round sixth day one round but in the seventh day they had to do seven rounds are you with me young people they had to do seven rounds on the seventh day so in the seven age that you living in as a young person you have to do seven rounds amen and you know what those seven rounds are it's the opening of The Seven Seals are you with me young people now you say my this is so big this is so conflict it is not the opening of The Seven Seals is nothing but Jesus Christ revealing himself to you to be able to come and have the preeminence in you all right so you had to go around on the seven day seven times and now at the seventh time so at the opening of The Seven seal now the scripture said that there was silence in heaven young people it is not complicated don't because if you keep putting I can feel that I can feel some young people saying oh this is too hard this is too it is not listen if you sitting there and you you st in chemistry you did chemistry and then telling all the ionic bonds and the calent pawns and all these pawns man then we lost exactly right but this is you this is who you are so on that seven time that was the opening of that seven seal now at the opening of that seven seal there was some few brother brand will say and you talk about the third pool now the third pool were different is the opening of the word but in the tpol he mentions one thing and that is the speaking of the word that you can speak the word and that word will materialize listen young people this message is for you these things are for you it's not only for the for brother Danny it's not only for your parents it's for you but but I feel like many times the young people will just push those things aside and be like you know when I when I become 50 years old then I I began to to listen to the seals I don't understand no no at 13 years old you going understand what they mean and use it as a weapon against the enemy because that is your weapon the message is your weapon in this age so what that open another seven he spoke about the turple and in it he spoke about the spoken word and brother Brandon would show us how that spoken word operated you remember when he was down there doing all these you know just haunting away amen and the voice came to him and said you know you have no game you remember that right and he said you have a need a squirrel you remember that that was what brother Brenham needed in that moment squirrels and he said speak them and they will come into existence amen and brother brandham spoke and they appeared in existence listen that wasn't just for us to read in the scriptures and say wow what God can do that was the wave SE that was the first one that was going I to say now you young people people now you remember the scripture we read Moses your servant is dead are you with me now you Joshua now you young people Moses has done the spoken word but now you young people it is your [Applause] turn it is your turn now to do the speaking Moses already done the speaking he's proed to you that it works and I we saying now it's your turn Joshua to go in the land and possess it and the way you're going to tear down this Jericho wasall because listen George as you live here the enemy is going to try to build more walls more Jericho walls around you in the middle of the night while you're sleeping he he's just building away he's just building away for the next morning man I'm going to lock him in he's going to wake up tomorrow morning depress as nothing else and he's building those walls he's building Jericho walls around you but you know back then they had to shout with the literal voice and make actually a shout but today the shout is the message the shout is the word that you speak today as the scripture said you say to the mountain do you get it young people now you say to your Mountain be thou removed and it shall be removed it is your turn to shout amen it is your turn to shout young person and you're not shouting just screaming but you shouting with the word of God and so when the enemy is there building these walls building these walls of depression for you in the morning you can wake up in that morning and you can take that word and you can begin to speak that word and speak today is going to be a good day and say today I'm going to take down the camps of the enemy and say today I'm going to be Victorious and say today I'm going to be an overcomer and as you speak the word you will hear a fallen down of the walls that the enemy has built to rent you this is your season Moses your servant is dead but now Joshua wherever the soul of your Fe shall tread whatever situation comes your way you have the spoken word in you to speak that word and it will happen just exactly the way you say it oh Hallelujah listen you say I have a need of a job listen I remember one time I had a need of a job and you know there was this place I really desired to go work there and I believe that the Lord was leading me there and you know one time I was in a service it was back in Ireland and I was leading songs and I was leading songs and I the preacher done preaching and I've went up and and sang The Last Song and and the brother has come up to pray and as the brother was praying a voice just spoke to me and said say what you want listen it's a reality it said say what you want listen and I remembered brother Bram had a need of squirrels and so he spoke the squirrels and he got them and I said I have a need of a job and so I said I need this job in this certain place at this certain time and I just spoke him and and I I I believe and and someone said this week is going to happen exactly that week in the middle of the week on the Wednesday here comes the email from that from the director and said Maxwell there's a position open for you listen Church there is a power in that spoken word there is a power in that spoken word hallelujah you are the Hat roid today young person you are a hat roid today what is your need you can speak it and God will bring it to pass if you believe it and hold on brother Brandon will talk about that super anointing that will come do you know how that super anointing and came was when he began to meditate upon the word of God when he began to meditate on Mark 11 that is how the super anointing came and when you begin to meditate upon the word you remember what we said you have to feed when you begin to meditate upon the word when you begin to feed on the word listen to the tape get into prayer that super anointing is not far from you brother Brenham said the angel of the Lord is not even 4T away from you he's right there next to you waiting for you to speak and he will act you were living in the season of the shout it is your turn to shout you are the last Runners I used to run I used to do the r running and you know I was the last one that run and you know who they put for for the best for the last is the fastest runner it's the fastest runner he's the one that goes last because they've got confidence in them that even if all the other Runners were by somehow to lose grounds this fast runner is able to catch up again listen God has chosen you young person in this last age no matter how weak you feel no matter how down you feel no matter how unworthy you feel God is looking at you and is saying you are the fastest runner for this age listen it could have put Paul in this age but it didn't put Paul here it could have put a loer here he didn't put a loah here he could have put Timothy here he didn't put Timothy here but he put you here he put you here because he has confidence in you that you are the faster runner that will be able to finish the race oh come on young people the Baton is in your hands the Baton is in your hands this is your season to finish the race by the spoken word it is not far from you it is your season by the spoken word listen young person you can't lose you can't lose you can't lose no matter what the situation is you can't lose no matter what the battle comes you can't lose because if God can't lose then you can't lose are you with me no matter what you face remember you can't lose because the captain of the host of the Lord is here the captain of the host of the Lord is here to fight your battles he's the one doing the S on the inside of you oh Glory Church listen to this called him listen they got there brother Brandon began to speak and he says and so when they seen this man talking about the captain of the host of the Lord he said what was it it was the captain in other words the leader of the host of Israel and he said and that leader was none other than Christ himself and he said what was what what was he first seen in a pillar of fire now listen to this part of the quote he said and now the pillar of fire had become a man are you with me the pillar of fire that was following them through the Wilderness now that Pillar of Fire had become a man ready to fight your battles amen and I said I hope you know what I'm talking about he said he had become a man he said Joshua alone boy himself seen just what it was he said that was the pillar of fire that had led them as an angel here he stood and called himself the captain of the host he said he was the Unseen one he said and and he is still the captain of the host of the Lord the Unseen one the invisible one the omnipotent one here tonight just as real as he was standing there against the walls of Jericho he said the same Lord Jesus he said a figur a figurative type of course amen so amen that the same captain of the lord of the host of the Lord was the same angel that was leading them now listen church that same Captain has appeared in this age he appeared as the pillar of Fire upon the prophet of this age but let me say this to you a young person that Pillar of Fire is not on a picture that Pillar of Fire is not in a white house but that Pillar of Fire has condescended listen young person that Pillar of Fire has condescended in you that Pillar of Fire has now got hands that Pillar of Fire has now got lips that Pillar of Fire has now got feet that Pillar of Fire can walk that Pillar of Fire can talk and you say where is he he's sitting on the Pew and that is you the pillar of fire is not just a picture the pillar of fire is living in the people the pillar of fire is living in you he's the one doing your battle doing your fighting overcoming fire oh Hallelujah brother brandham says that Pillar of Fire has come Among Us the captain of the host of the Lord L and every devil that's got the people B tonight is scared to death he say sure they are they are fainting why they hear why the the Philistines and so forth why did they faint he said why did Jericho faint because the people that had the promise was on the road to Comm in listen the demons are are fainting right now the devils in hell are shaken right now that demon of lust that was bothering you he's shaken right now that demon of depression that was bothering you is shaken right now why because the people of the promise are walking

in but the pillar of fire the pillar of fire is in you walking in to possess your land your inheritance he said they are scared they are scared those devils are scared because the ones that got a promise the people of the Covenant the promised people that's in Jesus Christ has got that got the promise even at the last days that God will raise this body up and make it perfect and we've got the attributes of it now so they scared their father the devil is defeated at Calvary and the captain of the host of the Lord has moved in in the form of the Holy Ghost the captain the one that was the
