[27:41] you know there's something about humans
[27:44] we love to complain
[27:47] everything you're gonna complain
[27:50] but let me tell you
[27:53] you are more than what you are
[27:57] especially Christians in this world
[28:01] we supposed to be the last people to
[28:03] complain
[28:05] but we are the first people to complain
[28:08] sometimes
[28:10] you're sitting here after the church the
[28:13] message come out
[28:15] you go outside you sit and come
[28:19] fellowship with the brother then he
[28:21] started bringing his trouble
[28:23] taking everything that you have got from
[28:26] your mind started complaining all this
[28:29] year all this year all this year all
[28:31] this year why are you complaining
[28:35] we supposed to be the last people to
[28:38] complain
[28:40] why
[28:44] because we have God the Lord and Savior
[28:48] Jesus Christ who overcame everything
[28:52] and you didn't take it back he gave
[28:55] everything to you and me
[29:00] or what you need
[29:03] to recognize yourself brother Brown
[29:06] preacher on recognize presence of God
[29:11] you always surround
[29:14] with God
[29:16] he's in you
[29:20] so when something happened what you have
[29:23] to do you have to become yourself
[29:27] say why who I am my God overcame
[29:30] everything and he placed everything in
[29:32] my hand
[29:34] so what do I repeat for
[29:39] the worst it wasn't easy look
[29:42] what about
[29:43] Moses
[29:46] ah Elijah not Elijah ah
[29:49] ah
[29:52] Joshua
[29:54] remember those brethren
[29:56] the blood was not given yet
[30:00] so if they complained they have
[30:02] something to complain about we
[30:06] God came and overcame everything for us
[30:08] he made it easy for us
[30:15] Moses has to go through
[30:18] the people two million people
[30:21] for one man
[30:25] he has a big challenge
[30:28] before him but he stood
[30:33] perfectly with God
[30:36] because why he saw God have you seen God
[30:42] is in you
[30:44] you have to know the God that he said he
[30:47] said I will never leave you nor forsake
[30:50] you till the end of this world
[30:53] it's a promise
[30:55] and This Promise has no end
[31:01] two million people
[31:04] remember
[31:05] Moses LED them
[31:08] then Joshua came
[31:12] if you complain
[31:14] he doesn't care we are moving forward
[31:18] if you want to live here stay here and
[31:20] rot we will leave you here
[31:24] some of them said we will not cross over
[31:27] he left them and cross over
[31:30] there's no time to joke this time
[31:34] everybody has to be serious because
[31:38] God is here
[31:42] he said I will not leave you nor forsake
[31:45] you
[31:46] Hallelujah
[31:48] God is here you know
[31:50] how the Lord overcame how many of you
[31:53] have you ever hit your you have

[32:08] this see going like this you know
[32:13] what the Lord went through
[32:16] to overcome everything for us

[32:31] what happened they crossed the leg
[32:33] and put nail
[32:36] from here

[33:38] why are we complaining for you are
[33:42] overcome he came down here during
[33:45] purposely because of us he overcame
[33:50] everything
[33:51] no one thing he left it over
[33:55] you are Overcomers
[34:01] Overcomers
[34:03] because he overcame
[34:06] the word
[34:10] I I said was preaching
[34:15] he chose you
[34:18] he mentioned something
[34:20] I cut something there
[34:22] he said Adam
[34:25] was eternal
[34:28] and God
[34:31] bring brought him out
[34:34] to tell the land
[34:35] okay we're gonna read here
[34:38] Janice Genesis
[34:41] I I have something here I'm gonna read
[34:43] to you here
[34:46] Genesis 2 67.
[34:51] okay
[34:59] this is Genesis 2 6 7.
[35:16] oh I think I missed my
[35:20] foreign
[35:34] six to seven
[35:37] and the Lord God for man
[35:41] of the Dust of the ground
[35:44] and breathe into his nozzles and breathe
[35:47] and Breath of Life and Man became a
[35:51] living soul
[35:54] you know
[35:56] Adam
[35:57] was eternal
[36:01] and and God said he took ground
[36:06] and form a man you know before God has
[36:10] already created ground the Dead
[36:13] so he used part of that dead and make
[36:16] man
[36:18] so that body that was there
[36:22] was
[36:24] was weak already
[36:26] because
[36:28] God didn't create Direct
[36:30] any right and that's why I said honey
[36:32] you use a photocopy all the time
[36:35] you become
[36:37] a lighter right
[36:40] so that body there was weak
[36:43] I placed Monday but God know what he was
[36:46] doing
[36:50] so when my fault that that time there
[36:53] when got my fault God didn't make
[36:56] another debt he used the same death and
[37:01] passed through to come to this world
[37:02] because he cannot create another debt
[37:05] he's already been created
[37:08] it's like somebody fall in the water
[37:11] that is drowning you have to go through
[37:13] that the same order to bring him out
[37:16] you can't get another water to be good
[37:18] you have to go there so the same death
[37:22] the god went through Mary
[37:27] and came out
[37:32] to overcome for you and me
[37:38] the only person
[37:41] that can take Adam from
[37:44] that that crisis was only God because he
[37:48] is the one who put him inside there
[37:52] so he has to go through there and bring
[37:55] a reverse everything
[37:57] that Adam was the state that Adam was
[38:01] everything every one of us we were in
[38:05] the attributes of God
[38:07] so when you pass through Adam right
[38:10] there everyone of us has to go through
[38:13] the same Adam went through
[38:16] so he came down that
[38:19] I reverse everything
[38:22] that happened in the Diary of Eden
[38:25] and went through because he knew what he
[38:29] was doing because the enemy was there
[38:32] Satan was created but he doesn't know
[38:34] how God create
[38:37] because he knew God is Holy
[38:41] God will never pass through the place
[38:44] where he passed through that's why he
[38:45] couldn't recognize him
[38:47] Satan could you recognize the Lord Jesus
[38:51] Christ he didn't believe that God the
[38:54] creator of Heaven and Earth will come to
[38:57] that kind of
[38:59] that kind of uh
[39:01] the image that he passed through
[39:05] we were States
[39:08] nothing good
[39:10] for us we are all gone everything was
[39:13] done
[39:15] but through his mercy and Grace
[39:18] he knew his children was inside of him
[39:22] and they have to pass through all this
[39:24] in here to bring the end of Satan
[39:27] so he has to go through that
[39:32] and he came
[39:34] Satan couldn't recognize him that's why
[39:37] he said if you're a son of God
[39:40] cast this Stone he didn't know was God
[39:43] himself inside that body there
[39:46] so when what the Lord Jesus Christ went
[39:50] through all this year and he went to the
[39:52] cross and he said it's finished
[39:56] Hallelujah
[40:04] he said it's finished
[40:05] Satan thought that is already done it's
[40:09] finished
[40:10] he went through
[40:12] where
[40:14] hell and took the key that time
[40:18] all the Patriots
[40:21] everybody was there that's why they
[40:24] called that place a word Paradise
[40:27] they were all locked down there
[40:30] look inside the dungeon
[40:33] and you went inside there and took that
[40:36] key
[40:38] and said them feeling the Bible said
[40:42] they all came out
[40:44] and he ascended with them
[40:47] to heaven
[40:50] so when Paul was talking to thesaurus he
[40:54] said because this this was a drama that
[40:57] was is not was for is still unfolding
[41:03] but God have he has already paved a way
[41:07] for all the attributes all his children
[41:09] he has to take them back where they were
[41:11] before
[41:13] where Adam was
[41:15] what Adam what Adam passed through all
[41:20] his attributes as he passed through
[41:21] there because otherwise it's not fair
[41:23] how you want only Adam to pass through
[41:26] that stage
[41:27] all his attribute if God give you a pie
[41:30] he has a right this man has a right to
[41:33] get a pie too
[41:35] everybody has a has to get a pie
[41:39] to eat
[41:41] so when he went there down there and
[41:44] took the saint
[41:45] with them
[41:47] and Paul was speaking to the theory and
[41:49] he said you know this drama is folding
[41:52] we know but but the sense of God in this
[41:56] world here before this drama
[41:59] ends we know
[42:02] not all these Saints
[42:07] will die
[42:08] but before this drama ends there will be
[42:12] people here
[42:15] that
[42:16] God will attack them because he saw a
[42:19] Enoch
[42:21] go went through the Rapture and the same
[42:24] time he went to down there what happened
[42:26] he took all the saints and went to
[42:29] heaven with them
[42:31] and the Bible says even some people saw
[42:34] them on the street of Jerusalem
[42:39] oh why you overcame that because there
[42:42] was people inside the dungeons or
[42:45] Abraham or the prophet all of them were
[42:48] down there
[42:50] so you have to go through what he went
[42:52] through
[42:54] so he overcame everything
[42:57] and you took that key
[42:59] and that key
[43:00] he didn't give back to Satan again
[43:03] so that place there there's no key there
[43:05] that's why they said when you die
[43:07] straight down
[43:09] you have no key to lock you out there
[43:11] from there all the same they go up
[43:13] straight
[43:15] Hallelujah
[43:16] nobody can lock there no more
[43:20] we supposed to be happiest people
[43:23] I've sent from this body present with
[43:26] God and Paul says some of you will be
[43:29] leaving before some
[43:31] and those people who when they die they
[43:34] go straight
[43:35] down there there's no more key there
[43:37] it's empty
[43:38] Satan has no more power over you
[43:41] you are overcome because our Lord
[43:44] overcame
[43:46] and we are the Overcomers so why you cry
[43:49] every day day in Day Out
[43:52] you look to the world or you look to the
[43:55] word of God
[43:58] he said ask
[44:00] whatever you ask in my name
[44:03] you will get it
[44:06] he said I will give it to you
[44:09] I will give it to you
[44:12] presentation
[44:14] no no I'm gonna give it I will give it
[44:17] to you
[44:18] why are you murmuring
[44:21] you are more than a country remember my
[44:24] message last time

[44:30] celebrities
