[37:05] come and see and I believe if there's
[37:08] ever a time where we want to remind
[37:10] people you know look around just look
[37:13] around at the conditions of the world
[37:15] look around what's you know what's going
[37:17] on in Israel Israel at War Israel is
[37:21] God's time piece did you know that he
[37:24] says you need to watch Israel if you
[37:26] want to know what God is doing right now
[37:29] and what he's going to be doing then you
[37:30] need to keep your eyes on Israel because
[37:33] they're God's time piece on what he's
[37:35] going to do and what is coming upon the
[37:38] Earth amen praise God and so um you just
[37:41] look at what's going on politically in
[37:44] America a divided America a divided
[37:47] Canada it's it's turmoil and Chaos
[37:51] everywhere you don't have just political
[37:53] parties that are you know just saying
[37:56] well you know we think we can do better
[37:58] or we think no it's a different kind of
[38:00] environment right now it's it's evil
[38:03] it's wicked it's it's uh you know you
[38:06] just look at the way they they they they
[38:08] talk about one another and the things
[38:10] that they say about one another and the
[38:13] way that they talk it's a shame to
[38:16] actually call it politics it's not
[38:19] politics it's prophecy being fulfilled
[38:21] where a world is in total chaos and
[38:25] falling apart that's what it is and when
[38:28] you look at the Olympics right now and
[38:30] what's taking place there and the
[38:32] opening ceremonies of the Olympics it's
[38:35] a shame it's an outright mockery of
[38:38] Jesus Christ the word of God so if
[38:41] there's ever a time you want to come and
[38:44] see it's now because things are really
[38:47] quickly falling apart in the world
[38:50] praise God Amen so let's uh let's play
[38:53] that um that video um just for a moment
[38:58] and then we will uh get straight to the
[39:00] word of
[39:06] God Amen

[41:29] we want to give up and we just want to
[41:31] surrender it all to you father let this
[41:33] be that day father and that you would
[41:36] answer that you would speak that you
[41:39] would make yourself known in such a way
[41:41] Lord that that it would change and
[41:44] transform Our Lives Lord and that we
[41:47] could not contain it but we would have
[41:49] to go and tell it to somebody Grant it

[42:05] we pray amen God bless you Saints it
[42:08] says here
[42:09] in St John chapter 1: 43 to
[42:15] 51 we continue where we left off last
[42:17] week the day following Jesus would go
[42:20] forth into Galilee and findeth Phillip
[42:24] and saith unto himf follow me
[42:27] now philli was of
[42:30] bethia the city of Andrew and Peter
[42:34] Philip findeth Nathaniel and saith unto
[42:37] him we have found him of whom Moses in
[42:40] the law and the prophets did write Jesus
[42:44] of Nazareth the son of Joseph and
[42:46] Nathaniel said unto him can there any
[42:50] good thing come out of Nazareth Philip
[42:53] saith unto him come and see Jes Jesus
[42:57] saw Nathaniel coming to him and saith
[43:00] unto him behold an Israelite indeed in
[43:03] whom is no guile Nathaniel saith unto
[43:07] him when knowest thou me Jesus answered
[43:11] and said unto him before Philip called
[43:14] thee when thou was under the Fig Tree I
[43:17] saw thee Nathaniel answered and said
[43:20] unto him Rabbi Thou Art the Son of God
[43:24] Thou Art the king of Israel Jesus answer
[43:27] answered and said unto him because I say
[43:29] unto thee I saw thee under the Fig Tree
[43:32] believest thou Thou shalt see greater
[43:36] things than these and he saith unto him
[43:40] verily verily I say unto you Hereafter
[43:44] ye shall see Heaven open and the angels
[43:46] of God ascending and descending upon the
[43:51] son of man amen praise God God bless you
[43:55] Saints you may be seated
[44:01] you know um last week we were looking at
[44:04] uh you know John the Baptist ministry
[44:05] and we saw how you know John had caught
[44:08] and was called of the Lord he he had
[44:11] caught the revelation of the Lord in his
[44:13] day he knew that the that he was um you
[44:16] know fulfilling scripture that he was
[44:18] the one that was the one that was uh
[44:20] crying out in the wilderness behold he
[44:23] was making the way for the Lord amen we
[44:26] looked at how he pointed his disciples
[44:29] that that followed him he pointed them
[44:31] to Christ John the Baptist William
[44:35] brandham did not point the people to
[44:38] himself he pointed the people to Christ
[44:42] amen and this is the hour where the
[44:44] Bride of Jesus Christ has recognized the
[44:47] hour that she's living in that she has
[44:50] received the word of the Lord through a
[44:53] Vindicated Prophet amen and that she now
[44:57] has the the the privilege and the duty
[45:01] to point others to Christ amen amen not
[45:04] to point people to our ministry oh we've
[45:07] got a great ministry oh he's a great
[45:09] preacher oh he's a great leader no we're
[45:12] pointing to the almighty God the Lord
[45:15] Jesus Christ he's the one that you need
[45:18] to know and he's the one that actually
[45:20] knows you amen all we're doing is we're
[45:23] we're we're introducing him amen just
[45:26] like John the Baptist just like William
[45:28] Branham just like all the the the you
[45:31] know the reformers Martin Luther when he
[45:33] broke away from the Catholic church just
[45:35] like Wesley they were pointing to Christ
[45:38] they were not pointing to
[45:41] themselves amen praise God and so we
[45:44] looked at some principles next slide we
[45:47] looked at principle number one it's
[45:49] never about us but it's always about
[45:52] Jesus amen we looked at principle number
[45:56] two
[45:57] and it said that you need to ask
[46:00] yourself when Jesus asked the disciples
[46:03] what seek ye he was asking them hey
[46:07] what's caught your attention here what
[46:10] what situation are you in right now in
[46:12] your life that all of a sudden you need
[46:16] me that you want to follow me what are
[46:19] you looking for he says come and see
[46:21] come and see I believe there's something
[46:24] there and we W to you know we want to
[46:25] check our motives in our heart and and
[46:28] you know people sometimes they got to
[46:30] get to a place of desperation and then
[46:32] we looked at principle number three and
[46:34] Andrew immediately told his
[46:37] brother once that fire was lit within
[46:40] Andrew he knew that the Messiah was real
[46:43] because the Messiah actually knew him he
[46:46] came to realize that when he stayed with
[46:48] the Messiah that night and they got into
[46:50] Fellowship him and and Phillip and the
[46:53] other disciples they came to realize
[46:55] wait a minute
[46:57] we it's not so much that he that that
[46:59] that we found him he found us am amen
[47:04] praise God Jesus said here he says
[47:06] listen greater things you know after he
[47:09] discerned
[47:11] Nathaniel and and told him who he was
[47:14] Nathaniel immediately lit up and
[47:17] realized wait a minute this is the
[47:21] message of the hour Hallelujah this is
[47:24] the word of God for my day
[47:27] and he's actually made me a part of this
[47:31] and this is the Glorious greater things
[47:34] the promises that we're going to be
[47:36] looking at today as we as we look into
[47:38] the word of God Amen and we look to see
[47:41] what the Lord has in store for us you
[47:43] know
[47:46] um it really should cause us to think
[47:51] and examine ourselves and you know I was
[47:54] I was doing a little bit of research
[47:55] around that you know um the last couple
[47:57] of
[47:58] days and um I want you to know something
[48:02] I want you to know that you've got a
[48:04] much higher purpose in
[48:06] life you as a son or a daughter of God
[48:10] you might be trapped right now in the
[48:12] cares of life and the situations that
[48:14] you're dealing with right now you're so
[48:17] embedded with everyday life that you
[48:20] know that that you just haven't taken
[48:22] the time to stop and examine yourself
[48:26] and came across some
[48:29] questions you know um because you know
[48:33] you can get so caught up with everything
[48:35] that you're doing and the person that
[48:38] you've become up until now that you
[48:41] figure oh well that's just who I
[48:43] am that's just the way I
[48:46] am but God has a much higher purpose and
[48:51] plan for your life you see those that
[48:54] that are that are uh you know dealing
[48:56] with situations and and circumstances
[49:00] and and emergencies and uh things going
[49:03] on in their lives the scripture says
[49:04] that it all works for good to them that
[49:07] are called according to his purpose and
[49:11] the key element here is being called
[49:13] according to his purpose and this is the
[49:17] thing that you know that I I want to I
[49:19] want to challenge you today I want to
[49:22] challenge you to examine yourself see
[49:25] where you're at and I want you to to
[49:26] know that just because you you you've
[49:29] come to this place now in your life this
[49:31] is not just all that you are you're a
[49:34] lot more God God if God is going to
[49:38] speak to you you're going to know that
[49:39] you're a lot more than what you are
[49:43] today but you know the secret begins
[49:46] when we can you know uh look at this and
[49:51] examine ourselves to look at some of
[49:53] these situations because some of us are
[49:56] found lost in the sea of life and we
[50:00] need a lighthouse to bring us back to
[50:03] who we really are bring us out of the
[50:07] conditions that we can get into some
[50:09] people get so you know caught into
[50:11] mental oppression and to to the point
[50:14] where they find themselves in a state of
[50:16] depression and they need counseling they
[50:19] need you know uh people doctors and so
[50:21] forth and the world around us right now
[50:24] when you you know if you start to really
[50:25] look at what's going on I mean just look
[50:29] at the situations look at what you know
[50:31] you look at that opening ceremony of the
[50:34] Olympics how they were mocking the the
[50:37] the Last Supper they had drag queen and
[50:40] you know in that in that group there
[50:42] mocking the Lord's Supper they had
[50:44] homosexuals they had um all kinds of
[50:48] wickedness actually mocking Jesus
[50:51] Christ that ought to tell you right
[50:54] there my God there is something
[50:58] serious in the condition of this world
[51:01] today and you need to really examine
[51:04] where you stand with all of that because
[51:06] a lot of people they get they get so
[51:08] caught up into the every day that it's
[51:11] you know becoming common for it to to be
[51:14] on the TV imagine you know your children
[51:17] watching these Opening Ceremonies and
[51:19] they're there and it's all entertainment
[51:21] to them but meanwhile their minds are
[51:23] being injected with Antichrist
[51:27] anti- word against God
[51:31] teachings and the people are getting so
[51:35] numb to the circumstances that they
[51:37] don't realize that they're caught into
[51:40] the mental trap of it all wake up it's
[51:45] time to examine and check yourself and
[51:47] see where you're at amen and you
[51:50] know uh there's some questions here that
[51:53] we can look at you know because when
[51:55] Jesus said what seek ye I believe that
[51:59] that is something that that is is you
[52:03] know coming from God himself he's asking
[52:06] that question to you this morning and
[52:09] he's saying examine yourself check
[52:12] yourself because if I'm calling you if
[52:15] I'm asking you to uh uh what you're
[52:18] looking for it's because I have
[52:20] something in store for you I've got
[52:23] something great for you that's what he
[52:25] told Nathaniel when when when Nathaniel
[52:27] recognized that he was the king you know
[52:30] it's because he he got he got so excited
[52:32] but it was because God knew him the Lord
[52:36] Jesus knew him and said listen I got
[52:39] greater things in store for you and I
[52:42] believe God's got greater things in
[52:44] store for us amen amen praise God so you
[52:47] know I was looking at some things here
[52:50] and I came across these questions here
[52:53] they're from an individual by the name
[52:55] of Frederick
[52:57] uh Bush bushner okay and you know they
[52:59] were just questions that he wrote and
[53:02] here I'm just going to read them to you
[53:03] because I thought they were relevant
[53:05] questions question number one when you
[53:08] look at your face in the mirror what do
[53:10] you see in it that you most like and
[53:15] what do you see in there that you most
[53:18] dislike see a lot of people are too
[53:21] carnal and their way of thinking is
[53:24] based on what they see but it's not on
[53:27] what you see but it's on what he
[53:30] sees question number two if you had only
[53:34] one last message to leave to a handful
[53:36] of people who are most important to you
[53:40] what would it be in 25 words or
[53:46] less it gets you to kind of like really
[53:48] examine oh wait a minute if I only you
[53:52] know I I if this if this was the last
[53:54] message that I could leave to mankind it
[53:58] really gets you to examine yourself and
[53:59] think about what's really what's really
[54:01] a priority in your life and it kind of
[54:05] allows you to see where you're
[54:07] at of all the things you have done in
[54:09] your life which is the one you would
[54:12] most like to
[54:15] undo and which is the one that makes you
[54:18] happiest to
[54:20] remember you know just examining
[54:24] ourselves because some people they they
[54:27] have one bad experience in their life
[54:30] and they hold on to it and they stay
[54:34] chained in the circumstances of that
[54:37] event and they don't allow themselves to
[54:40] be set free to actually see how their
[54:44] lives can be liberated and set free from
[54:47] the bondage of those
[54:52] events is there any person in the world
[54:54] or any cause that if the circumstances
[54:58] called for it you would be willing to
[55:00] die for it or for her or for
[55:06] him makes you
[55:08] think what would you die
[55:10] for what would you you know give your
[55:14] life
[55:16] for there is no other life but eternal
[55:21] life there is no greater life than the
[55:24] Life of Christ
[55:27] there is nothing that that can you know
[55:29] death has no sting over the Sons and
[55:32] Daughters of
[55:35] God if there were If This Were the last
[55:38] day of your life what would you do with
[55:44] it you know if you look at all these
[55:47] questions that I just asked here it
[55:49] really gets you to look at yourself
[55:51] really get you to examine yourself you
[55:54] know we're just laying in a little
[55:55] Foundation here here because you know I
[55:57] I want you to know that that you can be
[55:59] set free of all those things that went
[56:02] through your mind all those events you
[56:06] know those bad events that you could
[56:07] turn around those things you know that
[56:10] thought of what you know what could be
[56:12] the the the the last message that I
[56:14] could leave for my friends and my
[56:17] family I believe there's a message here
[56:19] this morning that will fill that
[56:23] void amen Jesus said come and
[56:27] see and when Jesus said come and see he
[56:31] brought them into a a place where not
[56:34] only did they realize that they had
[56:37] followed the Messiah but they had come
[56:40] to realize that the Messiah knew exactly
[56:44] who they were amen praise God and so now
[56:48] we
[56:49] continue that was just kind of a quick
[56:52] review of um of last week and now we
[56:56] want to move on and we want to look at
[56:58] part two because we're looking at the
[57:01] promise of the greater things amen
[57:05] praise God I believe you know like I had
[57:07] no idea I had no idea that when when I
[57:11] got into the to the worst you know state
[57:14] in my life and when things were falling
[57:16] apart I was addicted to drugs I had you
[57:19] know I had a family that that was was
[57:22] falling apart I I had no real you know
[57:26] um Financial um Clarity in my life
[57:31] everything was just a risk didn't know
[57:33] if you know if I was going to make it
[57:35] from one year to the next because I was
[57:37] a you know I was an entrepreneur and I
[57:39] was willing to to to try anything you
[57:42] know because constantly looking for that
[57:44] for for that you know physical uh
[57:47] natural fix looking for for you know
[57:51] financial gain and and and looking for
[57:54] the the things that would s satisfy this
[57:57] I had no idea that God would enter into
[58:01] my life would call my name would would
[58:04] would uh tell me about myself tell me
[58:07] about how much he knew me amen praise
[58:10] God no idea that this was going to come
[58:14] into my life and didn't realize that now
[58:16] I'm 30 years later experiencing the
[58:18] greater things that he had available and
[58:22] it just keeps getting better and better
[58:24] and better you know
[58:27] Phillip when Jesus um you know uh here
[58:32] let's let's go to the next
[58:34] scripture next slide St John we're we're
[58:38] continuing in the book of St John and I
[58:41] want you to pay attention here um how
[58:44] this all just unfolds everything is just
[58:47] unfolding here and you know Jesus coming
[58:50] into his public Ministry being
[58:52] introduced by John the Baptist and then
[58:54] the disciples come to recognize who he
[58:57] was and as you know you read through the
[59:01] book of St John you come into these
[59:04] scriptures here and you come to realize
[59:07] that hang on a minute here the Lord has
[59:09] a a a plan here that overrides
[59:12] everything that you know that I thought
[59:14] you know being a Christian was that I
[59:17] thought you know I just join a church
[59:19] you know we were brought up you know
[59:21] Catholics Baptists
[59:23] Presbyterians uh Pentecostals whatever
[59:26] ever Jehovah Witness could have been
[59:28] Buddhas you could have been you know new
[59:30] age whatever it is you you're all
[59:32] brought up and you all had this concept
[59:35] of you know of of what it is to be a
[59:38] part of that particular um teaching
[59:42] right but here now I want you to pay
[59:44] attention this is the this is the
[59:46] reality teaching this is where you know
[59:50] you come into the greater things this is
[59:52] where you come to realize that this is
[59:54] more than just joining a church there's
[59:57] more than just you know being a church
[59:59] member or being a preacher or being a
[1:00:01] deacon or a trustee it's a lot more than
[1:00:04] that amen being a Sunday school teacher
[1:00:07] you know is a lot more than that it's
[1:00:09] coming into a realization that you're
[1:00:12] actually one of his that you're that
[1:00:15] that you're important to him that you're
[1:00:17] actually his wife his bride his his
[1:00:20] closest allies right now here on the
[1:00:23] earth listen to him here he says
[1:00:26] he says um St John 14:6 now he's
[1:00:30] speaking to Phillip and Jesus saith unto
[1:00:32] him I am the way the truth and the life
[1:00:36] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[1:00:41] if you have known me you should have
[1:00:44] known my father also and from henceforth
[1:00:47] ye know him and have seen him now here
[1:00:51] God is making the Lord is making very
[1:00:54] clear who he is okay because until you
[1:00:58] know who Jesus Christ is and that he is
[1:01:01] the absolute he's the one that can
[1:01:03] answer every question he's the one that
[1:01:06] forgives your sin he's the one that can
[1:01:08] set you free from the bondage of mental
[1:01:11] oppression of broken relationships of
[1:01:15] sickness cancer whatever it is he's the
[1:01:18] only one and he wants to make that clear
[1:01:21] he's making that clear right here to
[1:01:24] Phillip make it it it clear to him and
[1:01:27] Philip saith unto him Lord show us the
[1:01:31] father and it sufficeth us Jesus saith
[1:01:34] unto him now look Phillip was still in a
[1:01:37] questioning condition you know he was
[1:01:40] kind of confused like a lot of people
[1:01:41] out there they're confused over the
[1:01:44] Trinity they can't quite figure out who
[1:01:46] Jesus is is he just the son or is he uh
[1:01:50] you know a part of the father or who's
[1:01:52] the Holy Ghost is that another entity no
[1:01:56] if you've seen me listen to what he says
[1:01:59] have you been with me so long time have
[1:02:03] I been with you long time with you and
[1:02:07] yet hast thou not known me
[1:02:11] Phillip he that hath seen me hath seen
[1:02:16] the
[1:02:18] father can I read that
[1:02:22] again does it say anything there but
[1:02:26] Trinity no it says he that hath seen me
[1:02:31] hath seen the father and how sayest thou
[1:02:34] then show us the father why are you
[1:02:36] asking me to show you the father
[1:02:39] believest thou not that I am in the
[1:02:42] father and the father is in me the words
[1:02:46] that I speak unto
[1:02:48] you I speak not of myself but the father
[1:02:53] that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works
[1:02:58] believe me that I am in the father and
[1:03:00] the father in me or else believe me for
[1:03:03] the very Works sake he was he was very
[1:03:08] clearly showing to these disciples
[1:03:12] showing to Phillip and anyone that was
[1:03:14] around him who he was and until an
[1:03:19] individual comes to see who Jesus Christ
[1:03:23] truly is they cannot truly surrender and
[1:03:26] give their lives to the
[1:03:29] absolute because you find that you you
[1:03:31] you'll find yourself in a state of
[1:03:33] confusion until you're willing to put
[1:03:35] aside Buddha put aside man's teachings
[1:03:39] doctrines of
[1:03:43] man priests that are going to intercede
[1:03:46] for you the scripture makes it very
[1:03:49] clear that there is only one intercessor
[1:03:52] that is Jesus Christ amen he's the one
[1:03:55] that died on the cross for you he's the
[1:03:58] one that died for your sin amen and he's
[1:04:02] the one that Rose for the resurrection
[1:04:05] to be inside of you so that you can be
[1:04:07] translated out of this world that's
[1:04:10] going into
[1:04:12] tribulation in this day and in this hour
[1:04:16] listen
[1:04:20] here brother brandham speaking here in
[1:04:22] the message identification
[1:04:26] no sorry from Christ The Mystery of God
[1:04:28] revealed he says now
[1:04:30] notice god making himself
[1:04:35] known not we're not supposed to make
[1:04:39] converts to Christianity by a
[1:04:42] government we're not to to convert
[1:04:45] people we don't convert people we
[1:04:48] testify that God just like Phillip just
[1:04:51] like Nathaniel just like Andrew he had
[1:04:53] to go and tell you know his brother
[1:04:55] right away he he needed to tell him Hey
[1:04:57] listen you need to you need to come and
[1:04:59] see you need to see that that that that
[1:05:02] I found the Messiah that he's a reality
[1:05:04] and when Peter entered into the presence
[1:05:07] of the Lord Jesus and when somebody you
[1:05:10] invite them to come and see and they
[1:05:12] come into the presence of God in church
[1:05:15] and they get sincere and they get
[1:05:17] serious about their condition and where
[1:05:19] they're at Jesus will open himself and
[1:05:23] reveal himself to them and they will
[1:05:25] never be the
[1:05:28] same listen he says not make converts to
[1:05:32] Christianity by a government but by the
[1:05:35] Revelation the Christ in you amen as God
[1:05:40] was in Christ as God was in Christ
[1:05:43] Christ in you now when what God did in
[1:05:48] Christ Christ does in you pay attention
[1:05:53] now okay because Jesus was the word made
[1:05:57] flesh in his day 2,000 years ago that's
[1:06:02] why he said it's not I that doeth the
[1:06:04] works but the Father the spirit the
[1:06:07] anointing of the Holy Ghost the Elohim
[1:06:09] the self-existent one the one who's had
[1:06:12] plans from before the foundations of the
[1:06:15] world he is the one that doeth the works
[1:06:18] he's the one that is manifesting himself
[1:06:21] in front of you and Discerning you and
[1:06:25] letting you know that you're a part of
[1:06:28] him and so Christ in you so what Christ
[1:06:32] does in you what signs did God in Christ
[1:06:36] Christ does in you oh isn't that
[1:06:40] beautiful oh he says oh my I like that
[1:06:43] Jesus said at that day that's this day
[1:06:47] he says at that day when this Revelation
[1:06:50] is made known you will know that I am in
[1:06:53] the father and the father is in me and I
[1:06:58] in you and you in
[1:07:00] me when the Revelation is made manifest
[1:07:04] at that day ye shall know that I and the
[1:07:09] father are one he didn't say I and the
[1:07:13] father are
[1:07:14] two he didn't say I the father and the
[1:07:17] Holy Ghost are three he said I and the
[1:07:20] father are
[1:07:24] one I am in in the father and the father
[1:07:26] is in me then when the Revelation comes
[1:07:30] forth now pay attention then it's I in
[1:07:33] you and you in
[1:07:35] me then there you are see manifold the
[1:07:40] three manifold what for to bring it back
[1:07:45] we've got to be brought back amen God is
[1:07:50] restoring us out of our spiritual
[1:07:53] Amnesia that's why I say God has got a
[1:07:55] greater purpose for you and there's many
[1:07:58] of you know there's many people out
[1:08:00] there that are still under the
[1:08:02] Amnesia and you know part of the Amnesia
[1:08:05] is to just be a church
[1:08:06] member because there's a lot more church
[1:08:09] members that are under the Amnesia than
[1:08:12] there are
[1:08:13] not amen because a lot of people are
[1:08:16] following what they think is the word of
[1:08:19] God but don't realize that they're
[1:08:21] following the doctrines of man they're
[1:08:23] under the teachings of man
[1:08:26] they're under false teachings to the
[1:08:28] point where they they they think that
[1:08:30] everything is fine and that's why many
[1:08:32] are going to come to the Lord Jesus on
[1:08:34] that day and say Lord Lord have I not
[1:08:38] cast out devils in your name have we not
[1:08:41] laid our hands on the sick and and and
[1:08:43] and they
[1:08:44] recovered read the scripture Jesus looks
[1:08:47] and says I never knew
[1:08:48] you can you imagine what a
[1:08:51] disappointment that's going to be I
[1:08:53] never knew you because to know it you
[1:08:56] know Jesus never revealed himself to
[1:09:00] them Jesus they they had no
[1:09:03] representation in him all that the
[1:09:06] father hath given me will come people
[1:09:09] think that anybody can come to Jesus no
[1:09:12] no it's not that way there's got to be
[1:09:15] representation on both sides those whose
[1:09:19] names were written in the Lamb's Book
[1:09:22] from before the foundations of the world
[1:09:25] amen listen here in the message
[1:09:27] identification then see God came down
[1:09:31] and the character of God was
[1:09:34] Christ he was the reflection he was God
[1:09:37] made visible notice God made visible in
[1:09:40] the beginning was God he wasn't even God
[1:09:44] then no God is an object of
[1:09:48] worship people want to talk about God
[1:09:50] not realizing who God actually is it's
[1:09:53] something that because everybody needs
[1:09:55] something to worship but this is not
[1:09:58] about worshiping a god this is about
[1:10:02] understanding that God is in you that
[1:10:06] that is the true revelation of this hour
[1:10:09] that brings you into a revelation of
[1:10:12] Deliverance you can't even be delivered
[1:10:15] unless you know that God wants to fill
[1:10:18] you and that God is in you and his
[1:10:20] spirit is the holy spirit that delivers
[1:10:24] you am amen opens your understanding so
[1:10:27] he goes on here he says in the beginning
[1:10:28] was God he wasn't even God then he was
[1:10:31] an object of worship only thing he was
[1:10:33] was the Eternal and in him was
[1:10:37] attributes and those attributes were
[1:10:40] thoughts and those thoughts was
[1:10:42] expressed to words and the Word was made
[1:10:45] manifest what is it it's all God
[1:10:49] becoming tangible and you are a part of
[1:10:54] God
[1:10:55] and so when you receive this message and
[1:10:59] you you know people say oh why do you go
[1:11:01] to that church it's not about going to
[1:11:04] that church it's about the fact that
[1:11:07] that church and the people that go to
[1:11:09] that church and the minister that
[1:11:11] minister at that church have a
[1:11:14] revelation of Jesus Christ in the
[1:11:17] present stage of his
[1:11:19] ministry and when you come into the
[1:11:21] present stage of Christ Ministry you'll
[1:11:24] be like Phillip like Andrew like
[1:11:27] Nathaniel like the disciples back there
[1:11:30] you will have the same sort of zeal that
[1:11:33] they had you will start to express the
[1:11:36] same kind of life that they had because
[1:11:40] not only did they find the Messiah they
[1:11:42] came to realize that the Messiah was in
[1:11:44] them reconciling himself reconciling all
[1:11:49] of his children back to himself the
[1:11:52] scripture
[1:11:53] says this is a about reconciliation this
[1:11:56] is about uh redeeming you know to redeem
[1:12:00] something it had to be lost before you
[1:12:02] could redeem it and so you're you you
[1:12:05] were lost in spiritual Amnesia coming
[1:12:08] into this world as an attribute of God
[1:12:10] like it says here and that attribute got
[1:12:13] caught into a a life you know it it was
[1:12:16] birthed under a certain parents it took
[1:12:19] on a shell but remember the attribute
[1:12:22] that's the life of God that's the seed
[1:12:24] of God and that is where God placed it
[1:12:26] into human hearts he placed it there for
[1:12:29] a certain time in a certain season when
[1:12:32] he would call that attribute to the
[1:12:35] attention of the word and by being
[1:12:37] brought to the attention of the word you
[1:12:39] actually start to manifest the word
[1:12:42] that's why people say man you're just
[1:12:44] you're you're a lot like Jesus e you're
[1:12:46] you're a Jesus
[1:12:47] freak you know you like to talk about
[1:12:50] Jesus all the time Jesus lives in me how
[1:12:54] can I not talk about him that's what
[1:12:57] that's the message of the
[1:12:59] hour that's what delivered me from the
[1:13:02] from the bondage of drug addiction from
[1:13:04] the bondage of of depression from the
[1:13:07] bondage of broken relationships he
[1:13:10] delivered me from all of that and now I
[1:13:13] live to manifest his word amen I can't
[1:13:16] help it he's it's not I that doth the
[1:13:19] works it's he that dwelleth in me he
[1:13:22] doeth The
[1:13:23] Works amen what is it it's all God
[1:13:26] becoming tangible and you are a part of
[1:13:29] God and Jesus come to redeem those that
[1:13:33] was put there it is on the Lamb's Book
[1:13:35] of Life before the foundations of the
[1:13:38] world so don't listen don't argue with
[1:13:41] people no oh I you're not saved you are
[1:13:45] saved oh you you might be saved don't
[1:13:47] get into that because listen if you're
[1:13:50] saved you were already saved before you
[1:13:53] came into this dimension
[1:13:55] your name was already written in the
[1:13:57] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:13:59] foundations of this Earth this world so
[1:14:03] don't argue about who is and who
[1:14:06] isn't it's all written it's in the
[1:14:09] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:14:10] foundation it was in God's thoughts and
[1:14:15] that's what he come to
[1:14:17] redeem and and them as soon as it
[1:14:20] strikes to
[1:14:22] them they see it
[1:14:25] now now now I hope you know this this is
[1:14:29] what we
[1:14:30] represent if Good Neighbor Ministries
[1:14:32] represents anything it's hey come
[1:14:35] recognize your day and its
[1:14:38] message because when Christ is revealed
[1:14:41] under the power of His anointing under
[1:14:44] his ministry under his will according to
[1:14:47] the word he backs the word amen he
[1:14:50] speaks he calls he places he he adds to
[1:14:55] the church amen he he takes out of the
[1:14:58] church amen oh yeah listen if there's
[1:15:00] Spirits are going to come in here and
[1:15:02] they're going to mock the word and
[1:15:03] they're not going to come under
[1:15:04] subjection to the word and they're not
[1:15:06] going to want to be totally surrendered
[1:15:08] to the word pay tithes
[1:15:10] offerings it's not something that you
[1:15:13] have to do tithes and offerings is not
[1:15:17] something that you have to
[1:15:19] do it's something that you are when
[1:15:22] you've received Christ you you you can't
[1:15:25] wait but to fulfill that portion of the
[1:15:27] word because you know there's a greater
[1:15:30] promise attached to that portion of the
[1:15:32] word
[1:15:34] amen thank you and all of a sudden all
[1:15:37] your needs are met because you have a
[1:15:39] revelation that God is Jehovah Gyra he's
[1:15:42] the one that puts the checks in the bank
[1:15:45] he's the ones that can stop them at any
[1:15:47] time he's the one that gives he's the
[1:15:50] one that takes and when you've come into
[1:15:52] that full understanding of surrender
[1:15:55] you know I was reading the book of
[1:15:56] Chronicles this week and and it was how
[1:16:00] the the children of Israel how you know
[1:16:02] the king went before them and he said
[1:16:04] listen I am freely giving of so many
[1:16:09] thousand pounds of gold and so many
[1:16:12] thousand pounds of silver and and all
[1:16:14] the precious things that that that that
[1:16:17] have been stored up that I've gathered
[1:16:19] together I'm freely giving them to the
[1:16:21] building of the house of the Lord he has
[1:16:24] had such a revelation and and the people
[1:16:28] that were there witnessing and hearing
[1:16:30] him speak under that Revelation because
[1:16:33] God was with him God was vindicating
[1:16:36] that he was with him and the people that
[1:16:38] caught that Revelation they started to
[1:16:41] give to the point where they couldn't
[1:16:43] even they had to build cities to contain
[1:16:46] all these riches and be because now
[1:16:48] where did all these riches come
[1:16:50] from that they could give so much and
[1:16:54] just keep giving they tapped into the
[1:16:57] Eternal well of Jehovah
[1:17:00] Gyra and God keeps his
[1:17:02] promises and you want to live prosperous
[1:17:05] then you need to you need to live the
[1:17:08] life of Christ in a way where you show
[1:17:11] Prosperity amen where where you're not
[1:17:14] you're not afraid to give you don't let
[1:17:17] the left hand see what the right hand is
[1:17:20] doing amen praise God
[1:17:23] hallelujah this is the life of of Christ
[1:17:25] and then as soon as it strikes them they
[1:17:27] see it because the life is in there
[1:17:32] remember the attribute of God that he
[1:17:33] placed in you before the foundations of
[1:17:35] the world before you came into this
[1:17:38] Dimension he placed a seed in there and
[1:17:41] I often asked the Lord I said Lord you
[1:17:44] waited 33 years to call that seed but it
[1:17:48] was there from before the foundations of
[1:17:50] the world brother Gabe but he had it in
[1:17:53] his mind that I had to go to Fetti
[1:17:56] interiors and I had to go buy some
[1:17:59] furniture and some words had to be
[1:18:02] spoken in order for that time and season
[1:18:05] it was in God's time God's season and
[1:18:08] something awoke in that attribute
[1:18:11] totally
[1:18:13] unconscious I was totally unaware but
[1:18:16] all of a sudden there was a thirst that
[1:18:19] started to stir up inside it starts to
[1:18:23] bubble on the inside
[1:18:25] and if you have something in you that's
[1:18:28] stirring you to go deeper to go deeper
[1:18:31] into the word of God to say hey you know
[1:18:33] what maybe I got to listen you know to
[1:18:35] Pastor Danny and you know maybe just
[1:18:37] just take one step closer you know maybe
[1:18:40] just go a little deeper with the Lord
[1:18:42] some people just don't want to stay
[1:18:44] there long enough to allow the spirit of
[1:18:46] God to start to speak and deal and and
[1:18:50] melt their hearts and and and and and
[1:18:52] just get them to a place where they
[1:18:54] where they recognize yes it is I it is I
[1:18:59] I it's I that speaketh to thee you know
[1:19:01] that's the voice of God that that will
[1:19:03] change you transform you you'll never
[1:19:06] ever be the same amen praise God why
[1:19:11] because the life is in there but if the
[1:19:13] life isn't there listen here now then
[1:19:17] what can they do see he says they don't
[1:19:21] see it they'll never see it see and the
[1:19:25] whole thing as Jesus said at that day
[1:19:28] you'll know that I am in the Father the
[1:19:31] father in me and I and you you'll know
[1:19:35] you will
[1:19:36] know okay and you and me the whole thing
[1:19:39] is God becoming material like a husband
[1:19:43] and a wife becoming one together amen
[1:19:47] God and his church becoming
[1:19:51] one amen praise God H Allelujah John 1:1
[1:19:56] says in the beginning was the word and
[1:19:59] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:20:02] God so remember when the word starts to
[1:20:06] manifest through your life it's God it's
[1:20:10] God in your life it's the holy ghost
[1:20:14] power in your life it's the holy ghost
[1:20:17] power delivering you from sickness it's
[1:20:20] now the holy ghost power that's setting
[1:20:22] you free from your from your sin and and
[1:20:25] all your shame amen praise God the word
[1:20:28] now is in you amen the same was in the
[1:20:31] beginning with God and look he says here
[1:20:34] God is his own interpreter brother Bram
[1:20:35] says now William Branham I want you to
[1:20:37] know these are quotes from William
[1:20:40] Branham just like you can take quotes
[1:20:42] from Martin Luther you can take quotes
[1:20:44] from John Wesley but I believe that you
[1:20:47] know William Branham was revelated as a
[1:20:50] prophet in the 20th century and his life
[1:20:54] was V indicated by the by the power and
[1:20:56] by the spirit of God to show that God
[1:20:59] was behind the words that he was
[1:21:02] speaking and that's why we take quotes
[1:21:05] from William Branham in order for us to
[1:21:08] draw the inspiration that God released
[1:21:11] in this time and in this season for us
[1:21:15] under the revelation of our day not
[1:21:17] Luther's day not Wesley's day not
[1:21:20] Pentecostals day but this day there's a
[1:21:25] word for this day remember that's the
[1:21:28] word that set you
[1:21:30] free he says what I mean attributes was
[1:21:34] his thoughts a and a word is a thought
[1:21:38] expressed and then that was in his
[1:21:41] thinking and when he said let there be
[1:21:43] and there was let there be and there was
[1:21:47] and now remember you Christians were his
[1:21:50] thoughts
[1:21:52] before there was a
[1:21:55] World imagine that you were his thoughts
[1:22:01] before there was this
[1:22:02] world pay attention and you are the
[1:22:06] manifestation of his thinking so you're
[1:22:10] manifesting
[1:22:12] him in July of
[1:22:15] 2024 you're manifesting the word and
[1:22:19] people that that come around you because
[1:22:23] of the anointing that that's on you by

[1:23:57] beginning that makes you then you see

[1:25:01] day and in this hour and not only is is
[1:25:05] is he expressing the super sign through
[1:25:07] his word but he's expressing it through
[1:25:09] you listen here in the message the super
[1:25:12] sign he says oh God if the world could
[1:25:14] only see
[1:25:16] that that God and man are
[1:25:20] one that you become one with Christ
[1:25:23] that's why you can't deny the word when
[1:25:26] you become one with Christ when somebody
[1:25:29] says to you how are you baptized and you
[1:25:31] tell I was baptized as a baby right away
[1:25:34] the moment that you speak that if you're
[1:25:37] an attribute of God the moment you speak
[1:25:39] that you're going to say whoa wait a
[1:25:40] minute
[1:25:41] here a baby I was baptized as a baby I
[1:25:45] remember when that struck me he that
[1:25:48] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[1:25:52] how does a baby believe a maybe can't
[1:25:54] believe but somebody that's under stress
[1:25:58] oppression under that that that
[1:26:01] desperation where they need change in
[1:26:03] their lives where they want to see God
[1:26:05] move in the situation that they're
[1:26:07] dealing amen they want to see the power
[1:26:10] of God then God all of a sudden they
[1:26:13] they look up I remember that day I
[1:26:15] remember in
[1:26:17] 1991 there was people had just delivered
[1:26:20] another set of documents this thick you
[1:26:24] know suing me and I was I was in a state
[1:26:26] of total depression and op I was
[1:26:29] actually sitting on my bed contemplating
[1:26:34] how I would commit suicide I was
[1:26:35] thinking could I drive off the road
[1:26:38] could I this is what because that's how
[1:26:40] bad that's how how low things had gotten
[1:26:42] in my life back then I had no idea but I
[1:26:46] do remember this one thing I looked up
[1:26:50] and I said if there is a God I need it I
[1:26:53] need need you right now that's all I
[1:26:57] remember and so something has to come at
[1:27:00] some point when when when something
[1:27:02] inside of you it's the time it's the
[1:27:04] season that stirs and you look up and
[1:27:07] you're starting to look for for the
[1:27:09] answer and you and and and you come
[1:27:11] across this message like I came across
[1:27:14] this message when brother Gabe took me
[1:27:15] there on that Wednesday night service
[1:27:18] and here he was talking about the woman
[1:27:19] at the well and how her life was a life
[1:27:22] of prostitution and all I could see was
[1:27:24] my whole life a life of prostitution
[1:27:27] that's all I could see and I realized
[1:27:29] but then right there and then he
[1:27:32] spoke and he said come and
[1:27:35] see come and see I had no idea what I
[1:27:39] was going to find I had no idea that I
[1:27:41] was going to be found Hallelujah glory
[1:27:44] to God Amen he found me he found you
[1:27:49] it's not you finding him it's him
[1:27:52] finding you in the state in the in the
[1:27:54] condition that you're in and then you
[1:27:56] believe and then you go to the water and
[1:27:58] realize whoa you mean I can I can be
[1:28:01] buried in that water and I can leave
[1:28:02] that old life behind oh yes you can you
[1:28:06] can leave you can bury that life behind
[1:28:08] and you can come out in the newness of
[1:28:11] life and you will not deny the word of
[1:28:13] God because every son and daughter of
[1:28:16] God has to come God's provided way you
[1:28:19] cannot deny the word of God Amen so here
[1:28:22] he says here God and man are one the
[1:28:24] super sign was that first man and God
[1:28:28] could come into all that God was he
[1:28:31] poured into
[1:28:33] Christ amen remember when God When when
[1:28:37] when when he went to the Virgin Mary and
[1:28:38] he told her that that you're going to
[1:28:40] Bear a son and she said be it unto me
[1:28:43] according to Thy word and she brought
[1:28:45] forth that body that was a human body
[1:28:48] that had been spoken into her
[1:28:51] womb and brought forth so that God God
[1:28:54] could get inside that body and do and
[1:28:58] fulfill the purpose and the plan and the
[1:29:01] word for his day the word that needed to
[1:29:05] be manifest in that day and in that hour
[1:29:08] amen and here he was he was the Super
[1:29:11] sign of that day that was man that God
[1:29:15] could come into all that God was he
[1:29:17] poured into Christ and all Christ was
[1:29:21] he's now poured into the church
[1:29:24] so now the church which is the body of
[1:29:27] Christ those that believe the
[1:29:30] word how can you call yourself a church
[1:29:33] and and and you deny the baptism you
[1:29:37] deny you know that that Jesus Christ is
[1:29:40] the only mediator between man and God
[1:29:43] you put the Virgin Mary before Jesus
[1:29:45] Christ who went to the Cross Mary or
[1:29:49] Jesus like like you know the Purgatory
[1:29:54] there's no Purgatory in the
[1:29:57] scripture there's going to be a
[1:29:59] hell Purgatory for those that that that
[1:30:03] that reject the word of God that's not
[1:30:06] me saying it that's the word that says
[1:30:08] that there'll be weeping and wailing and
[1:30:10] nashing of teeth because they rejected
[1:30:13] the word when it came to them remember
[1:30:16] this is the word coming to you this is
[1:30:20] the hour where Jesus Christ is saying
[1:30:22] Hey I want to manifest myself
[1:30:24] in the present stage of the word for
[1:30:27] this day and in this hour and I need you
[1:30:29] to be the tangible
[1:30:32] manifestation of my word for this day
[1:30:35] and for this hour and you cannot deny my
[1:30:38] word and say you are of the
[1:30:42] word so all that was in Christ was
[1:30:45] poured into the church super sign God
[1:30:48] and man together and that was to be the
[1:30:52] Super sign of the last last day when the
[1:30:56] entire Bible was to be fulfilled in the
[1:31:00] last days remember all scripture heavens
[1:31:04] and earth will pass away but my word
[1:31:06] shall never pass away and all scripture
[1:31:10] must be fulfilled including the
[1:31:13] scripture that talks about you talks
[1:31:16] about you thank you talks about you and
[1:31:19] you and you and you and every single
[1:31:23] attribute of of God God is calling you
[1:31:26] under the opening of that seventh seal
[1:31:28] we're not going to get into all of that
[1:31:29] now but that's that's what we're
[1:31:31] manifesting right now when those seals
[1:31:34] were open it was because the names that
[1:31:36] were written under those last end time
[1:31:40] Sons and Daughters of God that were to
[1:31:42] come into manifestation would be called
[1:31:45] and that's why we have a peculiar
[1:31:47] message that's why we speak different
[1:31:50] that's why when you go back Jesus spoke
[1:31:53] different in the was only a dozen that
[1:31:54] were following him all the other ones
[1:31:57] were mesmerized by what he was saying
[1:31:58] they couldn't understand what he was
[1:32:00] saying he spoke to them in Parables but
[1:32:03] he said unto you it has been given to
[1:32:07] know the mysteries of the Kingdom unto
[1:32:11] you it has been given to know the word
[1:32:13] for your day so that you can follow me
[1:32:16] so that you can recognize who I am he
[1:32:19] says here now watch he says in the last
[1:32:21] day when the entire Bible was to be be
[1:32:24] fulfilled in the last days a super sign
[1:32:28] a virgin shall conceive she was a super
[1:32:32] sign and this conception when it's
[1:32:35] brought forth will be God manifested in
[1:32:39] flesh a super sign they still don't
[1:32:43] believe it but it was anyhow amen it's
[1:32:47] still a super
[1:32:49] sign notice super sign they've got
[1:32:53] Superman today today they got fictions
[1:32:56] of Superman all these other kind of
