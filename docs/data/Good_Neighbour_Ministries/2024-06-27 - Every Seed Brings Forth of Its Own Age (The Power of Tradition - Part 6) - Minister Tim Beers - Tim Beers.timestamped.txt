[29:25] different we talk different we act
[29:27] different there's a different anointing
[29:29] and confidence and power around our
[29:31] lives when we speak the word of God
[29:34] we're not speaking just
[29:35] religion hallelujah oh Jesus said
[29:38] brother brandom said but it's different
[29:40] when you say oh God is revealed to me I
[29:43] say I say CU I believe because it's

[29:49] and he gave me the word by faith he gave
[29:53] it to

[30:16] was both the seven Church age
[30:18] messenger and the ministry and the
[30:21] Capstone Ministry he preached the
[30:24] Pentecostal message but as those seals
[30:27] were br
[30:28] breaking amen those seals were breaking
[30:31] they weren't
[30:32] open the serpent seed the church ages we
[30:36] can see all those things it was breaking
[30:39] but it was still in a Pentecostal real a
[30:43] Pentecostal understanding until those
[30:45] seals opened up that's when the age
[30:49] changed everything changed brother
[30:51] bradam said it became a new Bible the
[30:53] what new elevated everything got
[30:56] elevated got got to another dimension
[30:59] got to another level amen that's why God
[31:02] said when the enemy comes in as a flood
[31:05] I'll make my word more real I'll raise a
[31:07] standard I'll elevate my word that's
[31:10] what he did amen we can see the process
[31:14] in in brother bram's life well it it it
[31:17] has to be reflected in the bride why
[31:21] because we're going to look at a few
[31:22] things tonight to show you that it was
[31:25] spoken of the Bride it was spoken spoken
[31:28] of her Ministry it was spoken of her
[31:31] life amen we don't need Faith

[31:56] amen hallelujah aluah glory to God the
[32:01] Seven Seals opening and revealing was
[32:03] the Capstone Ministry calling the bride
[32:07] into perfect Faith you see she could
[32:10] never have been first of all elected and
[32:13] called out until that came and she could
[32:17] never be called into perfect Faith until
[32:20] those seals were open she could never
[32:23] come into perfect realization of who she
[32:26] is she could never go behind that inner
[32:30] Veil fully with God until those seals
[32:32] were open and revealed it opened the
[32:36] door for her amen it changed the
[32:39] dispensation of time it changed
[32:41] everything for her she went to another
[32:44] level from Pentecost
[32:47] Hallelujah now she can go behind the in
[32:51] Veil just like in the Old Testament
[32:53] Hallelujah it was death to go into
[32:57] behind the in Veil only the priest that
[32:59] was elected once a year can go behind
[33:02] there now Hallelujah it wasn't for the
[33:06] Pentecost it wasn't for Luther Wesley
[33:09] but now after those seals have broken
[33:13] for the

[52:04] eternally though not expressed until
[52:07] each came forth in his designated degree
[52:11] season and time each as each member came
[52:16] forth it became expressed and took its
[52:21] place in the body by recognizing his
[52:26] place place in the
[52:27] body thus this
[52:30] bride is the literal spoken word seed
[52:34] bride that's who she is and though she
[52:38] is
[52:39] feminine now listen she is Cho
[52:43] choosing and
[52:46] naming of someone to be a holder of an
[52:50] official position that's who she
[52:53] is for a special purpose or given to a
[52:58] special
[53:00] status that's the description in this
[53:03] hour of the Bride of Jesus Christ a
[53:06] special position and a special status in

[1:03:03] work in this
[1:03:05] day
[1:03:06] amen that's the same way of looking in
[1:03:09] the message what I was just talking
[1:03:10] about you look in the
[1:03:12] Bible you believe every we believe the
[1:03:15] Bible is true right every single word of
[1:03:18] the Bible but when you look at Noah when
[1:03:21] you look at Moses you look at those and
[1:03:24] you say it's not this today that's not
[1:03:27] that's not for this today God's not
[1:03:30] asking me to build an ark he's not
[1:03:32] asking me to do the things that Noah did
[1:03:34] it's the truth but if you believe like
[1:03:37] some people are Believing on certain
[1:03:38] things from the past living living under
[1:03:42] the law of the priesthood living under
[1:03:45] all these things from the past you're
[1:03:48] blinded by a glare you're not producing
[1:03:51] the True Light that God has given us for
[1:03:54] this hour it's not going to produce body
[1:03:56] changed is not going to produce what he
[1:03:58] has spoken today that you and Christ are
[1:04:00] one it's the truth though just like in
[1:04:03] the message even brother Bram said out
[1:04:06] of his own mouth God allowed me to set
[1:04:09] traps God allowed me to set
[1:04:13] traps Hallelujah for make people go this
[1:04:16] way that way and then the Bride of Jesus
[1:04:19] Christ why because she sees Christ it's
[1:04:22] her in Christ amen she can't be dis
[1:04:26] deed
[1:04:28] hallelujah
[1:04:30] amen Wesley sanctification Pentecost the
[1:04:34] gifts it was the word revealed in his
[1:04:36] fullness but now it's the word revealed

[1:13:51] like Abraham walk and you know it's
[1:13:53] going to fall off of you

[1:14:30] that's what we
[1:14:31] want let me find a place to close here
[1:14:34] we'll just have to continue
[1:14:38] this Hallelujah brother Bram said I'd
[1:14:41] rather have the right
[1:14:43] Spirit and the wrong
[1:14:46] Doctrine than have the right Doctrine
[1:14:49] and the wrong Spirit why did he say that
[1:14:52] and what we're talking about here
[1:14:55] because the right spirit will always
[1:14:58] correct the wrong Doctrine
[1:15:00] amen
[1:15:02] hallelujah but it's the opposite in this
[1:15:04] message when it comes to criticizing
[1:15:07] people oh you're off the word you got
[1:15:09] the wrong Doctrine wrong
[1:15:14] Spirit the right spirit will always
[1:15:16] correct the wrong Doctrine but the right
[1:15:19] Doctrine can never correct a wrong
[1:15:23] Spirit think about that think about it
[1:15:28] when things happen think about these
[1:15:29] things that has spoken let the Holy
[1:15:32] Spirit bring it back to your Remembrance
[1:15:34] in the time and season that you're going
[1:15:35] through something or you're being tested
[1:15:38] or there's a manifestation in your life
[1:15:40] you see the letter
[1:15:42] kills it kills my brothers and sisters
[1:15:45] the right Doctrine can kill
[1:15:48] you it says the letter kills but the
[1:15:51] spirit gives it
[1:15:53] life doesn't matter right Doctrine wrong
[1:15:55] Doctrine you don't got the right Spirit
[1:15:58] you're bringing forth death
[1:16:00] anyways Hallelujah not by might not by
[1:16:03] power but by my spirit sayeth the
[1:16:06] Lord everyone is waiting musicians come
[1:16:10] everyone is waiting for the Rapture but
[1:16:13] the Rapture is a revelation that the
[1:16:14] bride is receiving and
[1:16:17] manifesting that's the oil of the age
[1:16:21] that's what's been spoken for this age
[1:16:23] that's what's coming to pass that's
[1:16:25] where God
[1:16:26] is the foolish virgin is waiting for the
[1:16:30] oil oh my my brothers and sisters one is
[1:16:34] receiving it and bringing a
[1:16:36] manifestation and the foolish virgin is
[1:16:38] waiting for that Rapture Revelation to
[1:16:40] take
[1:16:41] place that's why it says in Matthews 24
[1:16:45] the when it talks about the virgins give
[1:16:47] me of your
[1:16:48] oil oh my my brothers and sisters How
[1:16:51] can any bride of Jesus Christ give this
[1:16:54] oil
[1:16:55] they can't give this how can you how can
[1:16:58] you give this walk with God this years
[1:17:01] and years of God dealing with your life
[1:17:04] bringing you to a place of surrender
[1:17:07] bringing you to a place of obedience
[1:17:10] testing you and trying you bringing
[1:17:14] forth squeezing th Those Grapes
[1:17:17] squeezing the oil bringing forth the
[1:17:22] oil we have enough
[1:17:25] for ourselves and what are we doing
[1:17:27] tonight my brothers and sisters what are
[1:17:30] we doing when we gather together do you
[1:17:32] realize there's a supernatural element
[1:17:34] when we gather together where needs can
[1:17:37] be met the supernatural can come on the
[1:17:41] scene don't look at
[1:17:44] Pentecost don't look at Supernatural
[1:17:46] like that listen there's nothing greater
[1:17:50] let me tell you you can lay hands upon a
[1:17:53] sick and they'll recover and they will

[1:19:32] and the
[1:19:34] bride he shows her his Word of Life she
[1:19:39] receives it she never doubts it
[1:19:43] therefore nothing could harm her not
[1:19:45] even death for if the seed be
[1:19:50] planted the water will rise it up again
[1:19:55] she will rise again just like
[1:19:59] Jesus that's why it said over and over
