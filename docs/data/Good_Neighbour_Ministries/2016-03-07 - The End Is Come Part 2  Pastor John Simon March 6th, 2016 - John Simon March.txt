TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the guts right the gods which is maybe Germans uh or austrians and stuff they start fleeing to intelliness that fleeing the road and flooding Rome and at first they they blocked the borders and everything else like that and they wouldn't let them in because they used to fight against those very Germans you know but then when it got really bad what did the Emperors decide he's going to open the door and receive all these Gods inside and that was a symbol or a start of the fall of the Roman Empire Mass migration because of War the next thing was the rise of Christianity and the loss of traditional Roman values back then it started to break down the country broke down because they lose their traditional balance now it's reverse the others yes Christianity is breaking down yes and the nation is losing its Christian violence yes amen this is what is taking a blimps and lastly the weakening of the army because they started to hire mercenaries today they called them up contractors private contractors and so money was going out and the nation's failed I want you to see that comparison so that you can see how modern events are made clear by prophecy and by history if you can look back you can literally see what is going to happen and what is happening and interpret your season and your time of what is actually taking place Hallelujah amen praise God brother sister I'll tell you here in the Genesis chapter 35 verse 34 he saw one crucial moment he had when he had to decide if he's going to take that massive package or not is that right and as a result you stole this verse right now every one of us is presented with the same Choice are you going to take the mess of the world's population the world is going to feed you you know they're going to get two jobs they're going to get you opportunity you joining to drink with every person there swear go down to the hotels in the bars with them and slap the boss on the back and smoke the cigars together yeah you want to get jobs you know but let me tell you one moment of mistake and you want to suffer a lifetime of regret and this is the choice you have to make and we are presented with the same choices whether we will go the way in the world and accept their Rewards or we will take them away with the Lord despise you amen take nobody with the Lord's response you the Bible says in Hebrews 12 17 for he is of repentance even though he sought it carefully with tears once you cross a certain line after a while my friends that doesn't matter anymore you cross the line and there you pass the place of no return lastly as I close off this message the Airness of one man was marching on the street with a black car and of the world the end of the world the end of the world you know what the next day they found him that he was dead in his house while he was censored is that again that something was coming but it was the end of his word but you know life started and life has to happen for his appointment of the man wants to die and after this the judgment the art is going to come when your rights are going to roll back in your head and The View the midst of death lays upon your foreign comes for you to those for me you see the Bell Tolls and when that part comes in the words of a Great Western troubadour together as a man dress himself up in a short pants like he's gone after school days I think you're going to deceive that you can't deceive death one man heard that death was coming for him and he decided that he if he could get past that one day he will be able to live so he locked up the doors of his house sustainable house because somebody in a chair from the side is gonna dead by drowning and he locked his house up and said we could pass through the day he'll be fine well come towards the evening six o'clock fast now he says hey he got over it and everything else cleaned the windows open and everything else now he goes to the washboard to watch his face and when he did that collapse at the same time you don't know for what reason he breathing it's just a handful of water took him to his nostrils you see when is the time comes for you to go you have to go yes regardless of who you are is you can look and say oh but I'm healthy I'm strong matter of fact I was just talking this morning about my wife's uncle uh his aunt her aunt who's still alive who's always sickly and me and those who got me treated there and he was a man that was so vibrant and everything else left back and tell me what the medicine and this thing he said oh come on I mean I'm strong right I'm strong I'm healthy and everything else like that but then all of a sudden one day he felt the pain next day he was in the hospital a couple of weeks later the back is gone is that right so you don't go by oh I'm young I'm this no I'm back or I feel good you know what about your feelings the best insurance you can have is eternal life insurance amen women eternal life insurance amen because once you have eternal life insurance there is nobody that's going to break their promise to you that will promise you a billion amen cannot be taken away from you the endoscopy and the scum and watch it for me behold it is come Romans 8 12 wherefore as one man sin and by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin so that pass unto all men for that all have sinned Romans 6 2 3 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is a through Jesus Christ Our Lord amen of course somebody have to pay the price for our sins amen John said Jesus said in John 11 25 20 to 26. whosoever believeth

without prayer next one week without the reading of the Bible reading of the word of God without December of yourselves together talking together sharing our faith one with the other encouraging one another building up one love encouraging one another paying your time to giving your offerings there's a reason why God tells us to do that is to give you a liberal spirit and get you out of the spirit of all Scrooge where everything is me me me me me and take you out of your state of the human condition of suffering from eye trouble everything is right so so God wants to take away your eye trouble they'll get the scouts under your eye right and make you into a balanced person praise the Lord amen so pay your tithes give offerings above your tithes don't just say oh I've been my times I love my juice that's it no you must be such a liberal person that you will have a stream of Living Water that's constantly giving giving given giving sometimes when you don't have no real natural reason to give amen foolish because we help this one we hope that one we give to that point we give to that one what pops out of one said there is he that seemeth as if he scattered because the poor you sow is the more you reap amen we're not sowing because we want to have human Acclaim and for people to know what we do for God is here yes yes God knows everything that we do secretly or publicly
