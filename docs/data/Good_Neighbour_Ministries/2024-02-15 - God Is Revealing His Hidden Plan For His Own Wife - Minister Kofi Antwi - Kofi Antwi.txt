listening for my name thank you Pastor than God bless you blessed be the name of the Lord I really thank the Lord for you sister and brother and my precious sister I thank everyone of you for coming out tonight in the name of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I know some of you has worked very hard it's but it's worth it for you to be here because when we look without Jesus we are nothing we all we give him all the praise and glory and honor amen because my wife was telling me even today he saw in my country news there was a guy that used to give when they vote he is the guy that give news and he in this studio the people that count the vote for the nation and he was working in a studio and all of a sudden he says I don't feel good and they pick him and to the hospital by the time they reach his dead so life is short so everything that we do we must give glory and honor to the Lord face because without him we are nothing and I won't take my time H I'll point you to the scriptures because uh blessed be the name of the Lord I know I'm not a a big speaker oh whatever when I say big speaker I'm not a a good reader and a good big speaker but hey whatever God give it to me that's what I'm going to bring because the scripture that I'm bringing today I tell you the truth I was not even thinking about that scripture at all I already have my scriptures I have my everything and all of a sudden I was praying and I sat down asking the Lord what must I bring to my brothers and sisters cuz I don't know I said Lord you know me you know me better than anybody and my education is not good I can read very very nice and things and all of a sudden the Lord brought this scripture to me alive and from I'll say from 5:00 to 8:00 I was weeping I was really really crying I cried to the Lord won't let it go because the scripture just like come alive to me I can't even explain it so anyway it's a simple simple simple like I know the scripture but it's a simple but that one that scripture I never even thought I was going to speak but he says this is what I give it to you so uh Cory lead us in prayer then we go it's yeah you can stand there the brother will give you the mic you pray let's bow our heads father we thank you once again father as we about to read the word approach your word anoint your servant tonight put the words in his mouth that you desire him to speak yes Lord move him aside go beyond his comprehension go beyond his speech go beyond his heart anoint and possess his vessel speak through him and in turn help us Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen uh the scripture we take in John chapter uh 21 verse [Music] 14 to 17 and it read like this this is sorry this is now the third time that Jesus show himself to his disciples after that he was ER raisen from the dead so when they had D Jesus said unto Simon Peter Simon son of Jonah lovest thou me more than this he said unto him y Lord thou knowest that I love thee he he said unto him feed my lamb he said unto him again the second time Simon son of Jonah lovest thou me he said unto him yeah Lord thou knowest that I love thee he said unto him feed my sheep he said unto him the third time Simon son of Jonah lovest thou me Peter answer sorry Peter was grieve because he said unto him the third time lovest thou me and he said unto him Lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that I love of thee Jesus said unto him feed my sheep this is the scripture the lord gave it to me this morning and may you please everyone be seated I never even thought or think of of bringing this scripture but the Lord just give it to me says go and speak this to my sheep my children go and feed them with a word like that and my topic is God my title sorry my title is God revealing the hidden plan to his own wife because without him reveal revealing his own word to his own wife as individuals none of us will be saved but that's the reason why he himself had decide to come down amen that's why he told he brother Brown says I must decrease he must increase because he was here he himself is here and now he himself going to go to individual within even the message to reveal it because why God knows each and every one of his children more than even any preacher can speak because without he himself doing it all all of us will be lost and if you could watch the scripture that we read even though Peter had his brothers that time the which were called Apostles the Lord didn't speak that word to all the apostles he spoke to Peter alone amen because it was specific for people Peter alone Peter alone was the the the world that Peter was going to fulfill the Lord went to him and let him know that that is the pl the word that he has chos in him and sent him to this world to come and do it and I want to say this to you if you are God's Bri the wife you should not worry just Rel relax your heart just feed on the word in the season of time God by his grace will come to you as you feed on the word God will come to you and open your understanding and show you and positionally place you in him then you wouldn't struggle you wouldn't worry I'm taking my time because you know why I don't want to speed up I know that when I get too excited and I don't take my time and maybe I will go off the devil can take me and take my mind and go off little bit but no I'm really taking my time to get the word to Zeal in because God made this word plain to me today he said look my word All My Children I'm going to go to them one by one north south east west and I'm going to go to them like that and let them know what kind of Jo in me what kind of position I really place them what they must do for me because otherwise they they cannot even fulfill the word because if he leave it to man kind hands everything will go chaos that's why he is now here when he told Peter says Peter feed my sheep feed my land Peter even didn't know because because Peter was illiterate Peter couldn't read and write to Peter like he would go for Fisher fish fish to catch fish that was his job Peter was a man that will Cur will swear would do things that was ungodly but God knew his heart he knows what kind of seed he has placed in him amen and he knows how to get that seed out because no Priest No Pope no King no man could bring that seed out only the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and so is each and every one of us that's why it's important to be in the presence of the Lord because as the word comes the word will reveal to you the world will put you in a preparation to go down into your knes the word will put you into preparation all the things that are hidden in you that is not right the word will clean you up there later here little then God begin to clean it up and positionally place you in him because he will speak to you believe me today only the Lord know this was like the the Bible was like lifting up a a man coming out from the Bible to me it was sry even 12:00 God is my witness he was saying to me go feed my sheep feed my lamb feed my sheep he he told me he says this scripture is you says forget about Peter I give it to Peter when Peter was I was dealing at that time with de generation but it's now your generation come on your hour that's it your time your season yes sir your oh my the word was making plain to me like I said my God this is so real because who am I I I even think that I Lord I can't do this because I I don't know what I'm going to even come even here what am I going to stand in front of my brothers and sisters and speak to them I don't know how what to say but he he has told me he says go feed my sheep he says look every scripture in the Bible that you pick and read it that you can read you just go and start and talk about me I will be there I will let them know it's not you wherever your foot will step I will let the people that I'm speaking to I will let them know that yes I'm in you because when I was in William Braham it was not William Braham that did it William Braham couldn't do nothing I the Lord thy God did it I the Lord thy God is going to do it for your generation I'm going to do it for you I'm going to be with you I'm going to show you my way things that you have to do to honor me otherwise you can never honor me you can never even give me praise because you don't know the way but I know the way I am the way and the truth and the life that's right right he was telling me things that I said Lord my God this scripture is so even though I have scripture that I can tell you I could preach so nice so good but Lord this scripture that you have open to me it it buffle my mind I don't have I don't know what to say but he says Kofi this is the scripture I am given to you let them know that you you are mine you are one of my 54 Ministry Don't Be Afraid whoever won't believe you even if you fall down get up I am with you if you made mistake even if you are speaking the scripture and you get wrong I am with you I will be with you I chose you that is you it's me that going to do it for you as I told Peter feed my sheep you going to feed my sheep I said Lord is it me is it me he said yes he said yes he said yes the Lord was speaking to me he says I'm going to be there Hallelujah I'm going to be there let them know that I was I am with you I'm going to be there I said Lord you know me you know me I am completely completely literate you told me you never let me go school you told me many a times that Lord is that what you were for giving me he said yes Ki is me the Lord is the god of brother Abraham the god of brother Abraham is me speaking to you and making that scripture know to you that it is for you have no fear brothers and sisters today I don't know even how to put in w but let me tell you God is real the God who spoke to William Braham is real the God who spoke to Braham brother Braham doesn't lie let me tell you how I got this scripture I was even shocked the scripture was so R to me that I said Lord is that you speaking he says yes I'm speaking to you coffee go and feed my sheep he says go feed my sheep feed my lamb I said Lord me how can I do it he says don't worry about it don't even think about it don't even worry or how you going to say don't even puzle about it just go and do it I'll be with you I am always with you you says can't you see I have been with you since even before you were even born I have been with you I chose you before this world was formed I chose you when you were even your mother woman I was there when you were in the African jungle I was there and some of us sitting here if not because of Jesus Christ let me tell you you could have been dead and gone it doesn't matter what you think or how you believe or what you think you know you don't know nothing it's all by Grace it's all by his grace grace and grace alone God is revealing the hidden plan for us in our life he so he says I won't leave my that's why then then I got to know how one of us won't be lost because how why he will come to us he himself will come to us and made the scripture so plain because you know what we human we love to speak nice clean everything set everything precise is good but God is not looking to that he's looking to his seed whether his seed is in you the way he has ordained you then he will come to you and he will make you know the hour that the the the part of the scripture that you supposed to fulfill let me tell you today he told me God of brother Abraham is my witness he told me he he told me this scripture is for you Kofi he says back then was for p he says can't you see you appeared today for me you appeared today that's why I took the edication from you he says do you love me do you love me I say yes Lord he says do you love me I say yes Lord I says do you love me I say yes Lord then I started to cry I started to cry because I know this scripture I will never even think of bringing this scripture and come and preach it but the Lord says go feed my sheep brothers and sisters if you are sitting in this church give praise to the Lord give glory to the Lord let us support our pastor if brother let me tell you I know you from Ghana and I love love you you sitting here you came here I know exactly what you want but let me tell you even if you doesn't get $1 in Canada don't worry about it take this kind of gospel repent and baptize in jesus' name if you repent you baptize in Jesus name Christ going to reveal himself to you he going to comes to you in the dream he he will re make known serious to you you will never think that God who created this Heaven and Earth is so real like that he will come to you and show you things that you never even T you never even think because you you you you say it's me Me Maybe I came here for money but even if I don't have the money and I have Jesus the the Lord controlled the whole world he made everything your eye can see what your eye cannot see so I'm telling you tonight brother I was even thinking about you that brother Philip should bring you tonight that's why for me I'm straightforward I'll tell you the truth you may not like it or you like it but is in my heart because I love you I want you to know the power of Jesus Christ I want you to know him in your life because we are living in serious hour Christ is here we are not just talking he's so real to me let me tell you he's so real that oh blessed be the name of the Lord Brother Abraham God is real even we Believers sometimes so many of us sometime don't know how to worship Him don't know how to give him praise don't know what he has done for us we we we we we we limit him we we don't give him praise enough if we really see what he has done for us my sister my brothers we will rejoice we will give him praise we will never no matter what has happened to your life whether you have money no money you whether sickness or no sickness wants your life you give him praise because he has done great thing for you yes the Lord has done great things for you and is so real to you all the time let me say this you oh God may the Lord help the people to see reality of you that they will know that that's why brother Braham he oh God when he was passing or preaching sometimes sickness free from the people that's why blind people I could go that's why oh Jesus Jesus Jesus the prophet saw it clear and clear as clean the best I can put it if you go in African jungle and there's water raining right in the jungle because there's no chemicals and the water becom so clean you could even pick that water and and and just drink it and it will be so good in your mouth because it's a real water not this chemical water we drink here or and even in Canada they have lot of waters if you go some part of Canada you can get clear water like that and drink it with no chemicals inside brother brah was seeing the word of God real like that and it's time for us to see the word coming to us real like that not that the word going to stay in in the page the word of God have to come alive so that you could see the path God chose you that if you are a sister we know that the sisters doesn't preach but there is something as a sister God want you to do some of them went with the brothers to Mission field some of them they they support the kingdom of God whether you cooking whether you sleeping whether you oh God help each sister to know their clear clear position in Christ so that this word of God it will line every person up that is my heart for you because God is calling he's calling us he's not going to leave us to warm the PE we are not P warmers God didn't call us to come to church just like the denominations are worshiping and going to church every day every day every day every day that's denomination way but as we are here for certain time and we will be gone cut up and meet the Lord in the air so we our time is short so let us be surrendered to the word of God if that word has come read to us like that let me tell you we cannot even stay home we can't even relax we can't even oh my God today the way the Lord was dealing with me my goodness I say Lord this is real to me if this is not you I don't know if this is not the god of brother Abraham I don't know any God of brother Braham then don't tell me about all brother Braham code or all brother Braham tape but this is real to me like that because he's so real he says I am God I change not I lie not I am God who does not sleep nor Slumber let me tell you all uh even by showing this scripture to Peter alone do you know God also was showing to we Gentiles that will come that he going to deal with us as individuals as acts 15:14 do you know as Simeon prophesy God will come to Gentiles and take a people for his name sake right and he says you Gentiles one part of the scripture which I forgot but I know he's in there he says I'm I'm coming to you Gentiles I one will be in the bed and I'll take one and leave one right because why he deal with us as individuals so the scripture puffer to me as individual so would you your scripture have to Puff off to you as individual then you will know you'll be setting of God then you will have confidence in your Ministry whether even is to sit and and shout and give him praise if that is your ministry then you will sit and shout and praise God and God will bless you for that whether it's cleaning whether it's anything the Lord have for you oh glory to God I said glory to God glory to the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ the one true God who created all things oh Jesus Jesus I don't know why even today my my my preaching is if if you are watching you can you will see that it's totally different brother Cory have no fear the lord is on your side brother don't worry about it I was thinking about you too and I was praying for you because I know your time you may think it as ter things are ter it's not Terry brother Rejoice don't put your head down rejoice in the Lord Rejoice give him praise brother oh Jesus love you he love you brother he won't forsake you everything he have for you he going to bring it to you let me tell you my brother he will bring it the Lord will bring it to you and I'm telling you by the power of God in my soul I believe it you will not forsake you because listen my brother listen sometime I know I've been there when it is so dark you cannot even you think Lord how can I make it how can this be how can that be you can't even sleep you can't even talk to your brothers and all you see sometime the devil hurrying your your mind hurrying in your heart trying to get the word of God away from you but hold on brother hold on for Jesus hold on because the Lord is about to do something for you I believe it God W forsake you brother I'm telling you I'm telling you the truth if you need him sisters if something that is bothering you go go down your knees cry onto the Lord you are his daughter you are his son he will never hide things from you let me tell you open up your heart let him come and speak to you from the scripture then you will know even you will know who you really are it will strengthen you it will bring joy happiness it you will never listen let me tell you if I you all know and I must tell it you all know that what doctors has says to me but let me tell you I don't even worry about it one minute God know God Of Heaven the Lord Jesus Christ know me I'm not worri about it one bit sometime even I see people even worry about it for me more than even anything don't worry about it for me because the Lord until I finish the work that he he require for me the devil can never take my life the devil can never take my life because the god of brother Braham is real brother Braham didn't die with him in Jefferson ve brother Braham when he died that Holy Ghost moved right on and he here tonight that Holy Ghost is here tonight his name is Jesus Christ he's in you he's in me he's in the pastor the pastor is sitting here let us help him to oh God sometime as a pastor or even else is not easy the devil is fighting to bring the word of God he's fighting you in every corner every angle but when he's fighting sisters brothers pray for us pray for the 54 Ministry because Good Neighbor Ministry we we we know that God is with us if you don't know I know God is with us I know God is here I know God is the one that has set the church everyone that stand here from the pastor brother Christoper brother Tim brother this small brother Philip myself God has placed us here for a purpose let me tell you God is the one that is doing the work oh Jesus brother when it's time tell me because my heart is so bubbling my heart is so in love with God that's all I can say because God is so good he's so rich and Mery to us he's pouring out his himself more and more and more that we can see that even Believers that W won won't come to service Believers there are his children that won't come when they when the god begin to do something for them their heart will be start to bubbling to be in his presence let me tell you no matter what happened unless you are working or something serious has happened be in his present be in the prayer meeting be in the tape be in the books those that can read read the books those that can H listen to the tape listen to it don't put it in the shf don't let the books stay in the shf don't let the service part oh this brother is preaching maybe he's not good his English is is not right proper so I don't come to church I love people that preach with fire and brimstone holy no it's 54 Ministry it's 54 Ministry whether is one word that will transform you come to his presence all those that are watching me tonight if you are watching you staying home come to his presence if you are unless you are old you are sick otherwise come to his presence we need the word of God to feed on because this word is the one that going to change you and I to meet the Lord in the air if you are waiting that the Lord going to come in flesh in our day then my brother my sister you don't know what you are looking for he's already here he's already here that's why the prophet says check 2,000 years ago John the Baptist saw Jesus he says I must decrease he must increase right that time Jesus was here alive physically but today is spiritually so when brother Brown says I must decrease he must increase he was here that's why William Brown said so so now he is here is US that have to feed on the word that's why he allowed the prophet to LIF tapes to leave the books so that we will come and CE it and we will eat those tapes and books we will read it those tips and book read the Bible and as we eat we we we become what we eat we change we are transforming there a little here a little there a little and one day you just you gone but if you are not eating the word then you will be like what as the word so check yourself who what thing are you feeding on what thing are you feeding on are you feeding on the word of God or are you feeding on the world then as you feed on the world you become the world the denomination feed on denomination Doctrine they become denomination Doctrine but if you feed on Christ you become what Christlike so Christ the anointed word is here is here in flesh the brother says preach brother Des one preach about light I was thinking about water I have a message about water I have a message about Stone I let me tell you I have a message about faith but all this the Lord has pushed it away says not time yet don't go that way yet I have it I know the Revelation has come and is sitting down there but the Lord says no take this scripture today this is what and go and feed my sheep feed my sheep feed my lamb and I said Lord me what am I going to say about this scripture but it doesn't matter what what I'm going to say or do or what this is what he gave it to me so I'm coming right to give it to you as he gave it to me and let me tell you eat it if you take it you'll be blessed you'll never be the same as brother our beloved Pastor coming Sunday eat it if you eat it you'll never be sh as the brother who will come on Wednesday bring the word eat it you'll never be the same don't stay home I'm just saying to all those that are watching me you are staying home don't don't do that please please the Lord is pleading for you come to his present it's time the hour is late the hour is dark can't you see the world can't you see how everything is going chaos the Lord is saying things are going what chaos so Come All Ye that are heavy laded come onto me I will give you rest unto your soul I will lift the Bell take my yoke upon you if you take my yoke my yoke is light my Bing is light you won't feel the pressure of the world otherwise the things that are coming you can never stand the pressure that is on the world today you can't take your own sense your own idea and stand it your own knowledge and stand on the world pressure because there is a high pressure there's so much demons the devil has released and God has released also his power Jesus power is here his healing is here am you need he says you need money you want money I'll give you wisdom I'll give you the way to find the hidden treasure if you come to me I'll show you the way I'll lead you Way I Am the Fountain of all wisdom I'll show you the way how to get the money I'll show you the way but first come to me first seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all other things will be what added onto you if you seek me first I'll add everything you need you'll never be lack you'll never be worried even if sickness hit you I I can take that sickness from you unless I'm ready to take you home you won't have no fear because you'll be strong you have you ever seen a a a weak Eagle have you ever seen you born check it you never see Eagle that is weak every Eagle is strong and tough every Eagle they can catch a sheep they can catch snake they can catch all kinds of meat and eat it they says I was checking H an eagle before he pass away he have eat almost close to 300 snakes only even snake alone on the head one Eagle so Eagle is not a something you could joke around don't you know that's why God typed his Spirit as Eagle you are eagle you are eagles of the day you are the ones that will if you allow the word to fortify your heart it all bring those that need to come in you don't need to do by your own power oh I'm going to meet this one and talk to him oh I know this I know that no you cannot do it I can do it but when you surrender the word is like a steam as soon as you see the person it will draw to them the word will pull them to you the word will bring them and you open your mouth that spoken word will be right in your lips to speak the right word the appropriate word it will pierce the person heart to go through hard the the heart and bring the person in it won't be you doing it you will know like as our pastor says when he went to Brother Gabriel it was the spoken word that pierced his heart but once they says brother God bless you it pieres heart but he couldn't see that time because when God do operation is not physical operation it's spiritual operation it pierc the heart without a person knowing he been the Lord Has Done surgery for him or her you are the God mouth God mouth is you don't look at anybody going to do the job it's you and me and if we don't do it who going to do it if we are not coming to service how we going to do it who are we feeding are we feeding from the devil more than feeding from God if we are feeding from God more then we need to show ourself and receive the the word of God that pertain to us so that God could do the work that he has promised us that he will do because each and every one of us let me tell you you have a work to do there is a work for you to do but when cultural hookers myself your you and K then we cannot do it because culture will make you feel oh if I do this and I make mistake and so what the Bible has completely told you the righteous man falls seven times he rise up what seven times those scriptures are not something push around it's real is real even preachers speak sometime they make mistake am i l Your Truth God's servants sometime they speak they make mistake do you know God can let his servant say something wrong and you can go and stay and criticize him criticize this criticize that criticize that behind the scene don't you know when you do that you are criticizing God because let me tell you one time I went to my country and my wife brother says Ki let's go I know one preacher a message preacher let's go visit him I says what is this why you want to take me there says let's go I do everything it's like I want to stay away from that he says no let's go so finally we we were trying to go then we turn I turn him back then we went while you were going the place we were going lot of mosquitoes lot of stinking filthy place and I have to walk through that place I said what the heck in my my sorry for my English if I have offend you it's not offend when in my place okay I'm so sorry for using that word and I went with him and here was the brother he has done something people even preachers don't want to see him they don't want to talk to him they cast him and he's living in some place even nobody want to mind him and as soon as I see him and I started to talk with him the Holy Spirit Come he says you're going to speak for me today I tried to I said Lord I don't know him what do you want me to say he says you going to speak I tried to not to speak I said and I could seee it I said Lord I won't speak he says no I brought you here for this my servant speak to him I said Lord what am I supposed to say this that I'm raisen sometime we raisen the word let me tell you God have to come so hard on me then I open my mouth and I will speak not knowing the things the brother heart he has repented and God wanted to speak lip to ear to him to a point the Lord was speaking and asking him do you know his me standing here you know the man that is speaking don't know God was asking him have you seen it's me speaking direct to you says I'm speaking your heart he says yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord all I could hear was yes Lord and tears were coming tears were coming tears were coming tears were coming God was showing him his say in my eye what the people are criticizing you I have already forgive you I don't see you have done anything wrong just go and do my work I have the work for you don't worry about how they criticizing you just go do the work of God what are you going to say what I'm going to say brothers and sisters God we have to allow him to do his work we have to allow the Lord to do his work and our mouth should be zipped if he haven't asked you to speak let your mouth zip on the word but if he ask you to speak speak as Eagle wanted to catch a fish or submit to it come and speak it and just go and let the Lord have his way amen because if you do like that God will get the glory let me tell you God is not about you it's him it's all about him that's it it's all about Jesus Christ it's not this gospel is not even about brother Abraham I'm afraid sometime we mention brother Abraham name too much we've been mentioning the prophet name too much I know he was a prophet you know he was a prophet who sent him Jesus Christ we have to live Jesus we have to live Jesus that's why the Lord even when Moses was doing something signs and wonders the Israelites were looking at Moses that Moses was the one that was doing it the Lord took him of the sea that's why you have taken brother Braham of the sea so that our eye could go who Jesus Christ brother Abraham was pointing us to Jesus Christ but because God the fullness of God in these last days came on brother Braham and fulfill the word then the people were looking to brother Brown God use him he surrender let us surrender we know he's a prophet of 20th century I believe in that may the Lord bless every one of you I wouldn't take Give Me 2 minutes then I'll let you is that okay my brother all right brother Abraham let me tell you if you tell me that he's not a prophet you you better prepare because I believe every word William Braham spoke if William brah is not a prophet then this 20th century I don't know no Prophet because all what even me seeing from the scriptures is all about what brother Abraham preached otherwise I won't cease it because Christ was in Willam Braham and now the seven seal has opened to us and showing us a leading and now Christ is saying I am with you I will always be with you my blessing will always be with you wherever you are wherever you go whatever you do let your heart do it and God will honor you and bless you glory will go to God the hidden word of God is now revealed to God's bride that's all I have [Applause] tonight hallelujah thank you Jesus Jesus God bless you my brother amen the Lord has simple ministers too we know that uh brother coffee is a very uh humble brother and you know he just he just uh brought tonight the simple thought that Jesus was showing there because he made a good point there when he said that Jesus spoke to Peter Peter was just a fisherman he was illiterate he wasn't smart you know and knowledgeable all he knew was to fish that's all he knew but God still went to him and he asked him three times imagine he say why would he ask him three times because he wanted to make sure Peter understood who was talking to him do you really love me do you really know who's speaking to you do you know who I am he says because in the Simplicity of of the fact that you've been given eyes to see and to recognize Who I Am the rest of the world world can't see it and just as simple as you know our brother came here tonight and you know he's not a great reader he you know he he doesn't read a lot of quotes you know he doesn't uh you know he just he just speaks from his heart and God was showing us here tonight that when he speaks in Simplicity if you can hear his voice you'll be blessed okay brother brandham mentioned you know he was asked about this very scripture and and they asked him what do you mean by that and brother Braham says well it's just simple it's Jesus telling you that you need to feed on the word not on the teachings of man not on anybody else's interpretation on the word just speak the word the hidden Mana is the word when they were out in the wilderness for 40 years they were receiving hidden Mana they were receiving fresh every single day because it was God providing it and when a minister stands up here recognizing that he doesn't have anything but all he can bring is his word god rides that word and speaks to his sheep speaks to his Lambs lets them know exactly what they have need of amen God hiding himself in Simplicity and revealing himself in the same way praise God so I trust that you were blessed tonight that there was something that was spoken tonight in the simplest way God speaking lip to ear to certain individuals letting them know that God's aware of their situations God wants to deal with your lives wants to you know pull you out of the snares of the enemy the enemy is always trying to snare Sons and Daughters of God but God's letting you know that he's he's here amen praise God let's sing that song He Knows My Name glory to God he knows my name he knows my every thought he sees each tear that falls and hears be when I call sing that this I have a Bab he formed my [Music] heart and before even time began my life was in his hand He Knows My Name all he knows my every thought he sees each tear and hears me when I call He
