[21:11] fellowship with you. Father, won't you
[21:14] come down this evening among us and
[21:18] speak to us for a while? Father, we bid
[21:22] you welcome in the name of our Lord and
[21:24] Savior Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. And
[21:28] amen.
[21:30] Okay. the book of Act 12:2- 24
[21:35] and when he had considered the thing he
[21:40] came to the house of Mary and mother the
[21:43] mother of John whose surname was Mark
[21:47] where many were gathered together
[21:50] praying
[21:52] and as Peter knocked the door of the
[21:55] gate a dam came to Harkin
[22:00] named Roda her.
[22:03] And when she knew Peter's voice, she
[22:06] opened
[22:08] he opened not the gate of the for
[22:12] gladness, but running
[22:15] and told how Peter stood before the
[22:17] gate. And they said unto her, Thou are
[22:20] mad.
[22:22] But she continually affirmed that it was
[22:26] even so. Then said the it it is his
[22:31] angel.
[22:32] But Peter continued knocking. And when
[22:36] they had opened the door and saw him,
[22:39] they were astonished. But he not he
[22:42] beckoned unto them with a hand
[22:45] [clears throat]
[22:46] with a with a hand to hold their peace.
[22:51] declare unto them how the Lord has
[22:54] brought him out of the prison. And he
[22:57] said, And he said, "Go show these things
[23:01] unto James and to the brethren." And he
[23:05] departed and went into another place.
[23:08] Now, as soon as it was day, there was no
[23:11] small stir among the soldiers,
[23:16] what was become of Peter. And when and
[23:19] when Herod
[23:22] had sought for him and found him not, he
[23:26] examined the keepers and commanded that
[23:29] they should be put to death.
[23:32] And he went down
[23:35] from Judea to Cesaria, and there and
[23:39] there abode. And Herod was highly
[23:43] displeased with them of Tara and Sidon.
[23:48] But they came to they came with a they
[23:52] came with one accord to him and saying
[23:56] made blastors the kings chambering their
[24:00] friend desire peace because their
[24:04] country was nourished by the king's
[24:06] country and upon a set day Herod arrayed
[24:11] in royal apparel sat upon his throne and
[24:16] made an oration unto them. And the
[24:19] people gave a shout, saying, It is the
[24:23] voice of God, of a God, and not a man,
[24:27] not of a man. Immediately the angel of
[24:30] the Lord smoked him, because he gave not
[24:34] God the glory. And he was eaten up. He
[24:38] was eating off worms and gave up the
[24:42] ghost. But the word of God grow grew and
[24:47] multiply and Barnabas and Saul returned
[24:50] from Jerusalem. And when they had
[24:52] fulfilled their ministry and took with
[24:54] them John whose surname was Mark. You
[24:58] may be seated.
[25:02] My my topic tonight is about pride.
[25:08] Pride.
[25:12] Pride.
[25:13] Pride is uh the meaning of pride is an
[25:18] excessive sinful self exaltation
[25:22] that elevate one's own will, wisdom or
[25:26] strength above God leading to arrogance,
[25:31] rebearing and ruin.
[25:36] When you read provert said pride good
[25:38] before destruction and healthy spirit
[25:41] before
[25:43] a fall.
[25:47] So Paul uh uh Herod
[25:51] you know we are the children of God and
[25:56] when God is doing something he deserve
[25:59] his glory.
[26:01] &gt;&gt; God doesn't share his glory to no man.
[26:04] Amen.
[26:04] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how wisdom you have,
[26:09] how learned you are, how how how
[26:14] spiritual you are.
[26:16] God is God.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; He challenged his word above anything.
[26:22] So this man, this man uh uh Herod,
[26:28] when God did something that nobody ever
[26:32] seen before
[26:35] about Peter, why did they put Peter in
[26:37] jail? Because of the word of God.
[26:41] They wanted us to kill him. But I'm
[26:44] telling you tonight, no Satan can put
[26:48] his hand on you. Nobody can kill you
[26:51] because the word of God is in you.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you are eternal.
[26:57] Your mouth is God mouth.
[27:01] &gt;&gt; Your heart is God heart. God is jealous
[27:05] of you. Because only you can glorify
[27:09] God.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; Only you can give praises to God.
[27:12] &gt;&gt; Only you can worship him the way that he
[27:15] want you to worship him. Hallelujah. So
[27:18] we ARE A SPECIAL and pecurial people in
[27:22] the face of this earth right now.
[27:25] &gt;&gt; As we always say the word of God is
[27:28] growing, growing, growing every day. We
[27:31] becoming like him.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; It's going to reach a time everything
[27:35] that you speak will come to pass. Do you
[27:37] believe that?
[27:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:41] Praise God.
[27:43] THE TROUBLE COMES, STAND ON THE POST OF
[27:47] your duty as a son or daughter of God
[27:51] and see the hand of God in your life.
[27:54] God is building us
[27:57] perfectly.
[27:59] We are the bride of Christ. Do you
[28:02] believe that you are bride of Christ?
[28:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:06] You have to walk with confidence,
[28:10] faithful
[28:12] as a a child of God.
[28:16] Do not fear nothing.
[28:19] God, nobody can touch you.
[28:22] Don't lose your God.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; STAND FIRM with the word of God.
[28:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:32] Pride is very very dangerous
[28:35] in Christ in in Christian life. Pride
[28:40] pride can make you fall.
[28:45] You always have to be who you are.
[28:50] Don't ever lift up yourself. Don't ever
[28:55] lift yourself up. Be humble and stay.
[29:01] God is ready to use us. Are you ready?
[29:06] &gt;&gt; And when God uses you, the glory belongs
[29:09] to him.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO PRAISE HIM.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO GLORIFY HIM. GOD LOVE WHEN
[29:16] YOU DANCE around his word. WHEN GOD USES
[29:20] YOU and you start dancing around what he
[29:23] has DONE THROUGH YOU AND GIVE HIM THE
[29:26] GLORY BECAUSE WE OURSELVES we cannot do
[29:29] nothing.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you and B I see when
[29:37] somebody is laying down
[29:41] with pain
[29:44] he has no place to turn. He can't turn
[29:48] to his wife. He can't turn to his
[29:51] mother. He can't turn to his aunt.
[29:54] Nobody.
[29:58] Your faith only belongs to God. That's
[30:01] where you can get your help. The doctors
[30:05] can do as much as they can,
[30:08] but it will reach a certain point of
[30:10] time they will tell you, "We cannot do
[30:13] nothing.
[30:15] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do?
[30:20] Build your faith in God.
[30:24] &gt;&gt; We be coming here hearing the word of
[30:27] God. God is building that. He's adding
[30:31] precept upon precept. A little here, a
[30:35] little here, a little here. Don't take
[30:37] it granted.
[30:40] Every time you comes to the service, you
[30:42] think you don't get nothing, you get
[30:45] something. Let something happen to you.
[30:48] Then you know what you got.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; NEVER LOSE. NEVER LOSE HOPE.
[30:57] &gt;&gt; Never ever lose hope.
[31:00] &gt;&gt; God is real
[31:02] &gt;&gt; AND GOD LOVES YOU.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[31:09] Pride is not only happen in the holy
[31:13] congregation.
[31:15] Pride can happen to the ministers
[31:18] we see around ourself. So ministers can
[31:23] have the wisdom to bring forth the word
[31:26] and some has faith to bring forth the
[31:29] word and some have knowledge to put
[31:33] things together. You cannot touch it up.
[31:36] But it reach a certain point of time
[31:39] THEY LIFT THEMSELVES UP ABOVE other
[31:41] ministers
[31:43] &gt;&gt; TRY TO TELL THE OTHER ministers what to
[31:46] do for their congregation.
[31:49] But this message
[31:52] is not like that.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; The minister is the head of that church
[31:57] apart from God to him to his
[32:00] congregation. No minister is above your
[32:03] pastor.
[32:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you believe in him, you
[32:08] will see the hand of God
[32:09] &gt;&gt; in your life. Hallelujah.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; Let us say with the word, THE WORD DOES
[32:16] NOT CHANGE.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; I will give you scriptures. MANY OF GOD
[32:21] people whom the prophet the kings whom
[32:25] God has called and they fail to lift
[32:28] they fail to glorify God and they lift
[32:30] up their yourself above what God gave it
[32:34] to them and they get into trouble.
[32:38] This message is a warning to everybody.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; Stay humble. God want to use you.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; That there the word is real. It's not a
[32:50] joke. It's real.
[32:53] You apply the word and let something
[32:55] happen. Then you know
[32:59] TELL YOU YOU WHAT I CAN TELL YOU.
[33:03] Exercise the word of God. What you hear,
[33:06] you have to put in practice.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; Then you will know the HAND OF GOD.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHAT GOD USE ME, he cannot use
[33:15] you. He cannot he cannot you God will
[33:19] use me different God will use different
[33:21] God will use that's why I always say God
[33:24] has a tool box and whenever he need that
[33:29] tool particular tool that time he pick
[33:32] it up
[33:33] &gt;&gt; SO YOU HAVE THE tool is always there
[33:35] ready the hammer is always there READY
[33:38] THE PRIZE is always there ready when you
[33:41] need it you pick it up and you use it
[33:43] and you put back there So you have to be
[33:46] ready to be used for God.
[33:50] And when you use for God, don't think
[33:52] you are above any you're above
[33:55] uh you above uh everybody. No. Stay
[34:01] humble.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God.
[34:07] You know, I I I got to have uh this this
[34:13] now God is doing a body check. Check
[34:18] yourself. It doesn't have to be the word
[34:20] of God. You can be your sister. It can
[34:23] be your brother. You look higher than
[34:26] him. Maybe the way he dress, you think
[34:29] you dress higher than him or her. Maybe
[34:32] the way you do things, you think you are
[34:34] above her. You you put your brother or
[34:37] your sister down. We are all the same.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; Nobody's above anybody.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; We are the children of God. And the same
[34:47] place we are all going to the same
[34:49] place.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; If your sister single and sing nice, you
[34:55] you [clears throat] you enjoy the you
[34:58] enjoy the song. Don't think that oh this
[35:02] man his voice squeak then you just go
[35:05] around and and joke around with the
[35:08] sister or the brother or I'm just saying
[35:12] I'm just making a a a point. Don't don't
[35:16] get me wrong like I'm picking. I'm not
[35:18] picking up anybody. I'm just making a
[35:21] point. Okay.
[35:23] Let us love one another and cherish one
[35:26] another. We are one another's keeper.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; When you see your brother, your sister
[35:33] is in trouble, help that person.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what situation, TRY TO
[35:40] DO THE BEST AS YOU CAN.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; Because you see this body here, when
[35:47] somebody something affects me here,
[35:50] straight down, it goes to my brain and
[35:53] my brain send all the signal to my body.
[35:56] Right.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; Is the same thing to you and your
[36:00] brother and your sister.
[36:03] Let us live godly life.
[36:07] Let us live life for one another. In
[36:11] that way, God can use us mightily
[36:15] because the Bible said they were in one
[36:17] accord. When they were in one accord,
[36:20] there's nothing that you can penetrate
[36:22] between them. THEY LOVE ONE ANOTHER.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; YES.
[36:26] HALLELUJAH.
[36:27] ONE CAN DIE FOR ONE ANOTHER.
[36:31] ONE CAN SHARE HIS LAST FOOD WITH HIS
[36:34] BROTHER OR HIS HIS SISTER.
[36:36] So when they get together to pray
[36:38] together, something take place right
[36:41] there.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[36:44] LET US JOIN TOGETHER. LET'S WORSHIP
[36:47] TOGETHER. LET US LIFT THE NAME OF GOD
[36:50] UP.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND GOD WILL BLESS US
[36:55] ABUNDANTLY.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE SO.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[37:00] Let me tell you, there's more abundance
[37:03] of rain, more abundance of blessing is
[37:06] on the way for us.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.

[37:12] spiritually, financially, health,

[37:29] LIKE a a a a honey draw bee, right?
[37:34] Anywhere there's a a a honey there, the
[37:36] bee will go over there, right there. So
[37:39] God is ready to do something among us.
[37:44] We are the one who going to embrace it
[37:49] by the word of God through the love of
[37:51] God in our heart. Hallelujah.
[37:57] You know pride always take things away
[38:01] from you.
[38:02] God cannot use you
[38:07] because you glorify yourself. You lift
[38:10] up yourself above everything. Even God
[38:13] also. You don't have power. I don't have
[38:16] power. It's the grace OF GOD. THAT'S WHY
[38:18] WE ARE ALL SITTING HERE.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.

[42:30] WHERE PEOPLE CAN NEVER avoid you. You
[42:33] know what? Some some time ago, not long
[42:36] about
[42:38] maybe a six or eight months ago, I went
[42:41] to buy something from somewhere
[42:44] and I start share the word of God with
[42:46] them and they get so excited.
[42:49] I I I left
[42:53] last week.
[42:55] This woman had a problem. He said his
[42:58] daughter or his son has a problem. He
[43:01] said he went to the Catholic place and
[43:04] he told him that their son
[43:08] in the night it seems that he's
[43:10] tormented in their home. So he went to
[43:13] the Cath place to go there and pray for
[43:16] that place there. He said, "No, no, no,
[43:17] no, no, no, no. I don't deal with that.
[43:20] He's scared."
[43:24] So he said he look around. He couldn't
[43:28] find nobody. He couldn't have anybody
[43:29] mind. And then I crank his mind. Then he
[43:33] called me and I said okay I will come
[43:38] and pray and if you believe you will get
[43:42] what you believe and God when you God
[43:46] give you something you got to worship
[43:49] him.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; You don't nothing give you nothing.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; You scared you cannot leave. If God
[43:57] deliver you what you GOING TO DO?
[43:59] GLORIFY HIM.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; GIVE HIM GLORY.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; PRAISE HIM.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; ADORE HIM. YOU KNOW YOUR CAR CANNOT HELP
[44:06] YOU. IT'S ITALIAN. CATHOLIC CANNOT HELP
[44:09] YOU. YOU ARE PRIEST EVEN SCARED.
[44:12] He asked me what should I buy? I buy
[44:13] rosary. I buy I buy incense. I said no
[44:17] no no no. I don't need that. The devil
[44:19] doesn't The devil doesn't SCARE THAT.
[44:22] ALL WHAT HE SCARES IS THE LORD JESUS
[44:23] CHRIST, THE HOLY GHOST.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. HEY, WE HAVE SOMETHING
[44:30] SPECIAL, BROTHER.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH. THE WORLD KNOW THAT WE
[44:34] HAVE SOMETHING.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, YOU LOOK AROUND ALL HER WORLD
[44:39] WHERE I pass through her mind. Why he
[44:42] pass through her mind? Because what I
[44:44] told her, he saw the reality and THE
[44:47] POWER BE BEHIND IT.
[44:50] My brethren, don't underestimate
[44:52] yourself.
[44:54] Amen.
[44:56] You know
[44:58] what happened to Saul?
[45:01] Saul was a God called Saul to be the
[45:06] king
[45:10] and God WAS WITH HIM ALL THE TIME.
[45:15] He answer HIM THROUGH THE PROPHET. THERE
[45:18] IS NO ONE WORD GOD EVER failed to answer
[45:22] Saul.
[45:25] But
[45:27] Saul left his heart and what happened?
[45:32] The spirit of God, what did he do? It
[45:34] left him.
[45:37] IF YOU LIFT UP YOURSELF WITH A PRIDE,
[45:40] THE SPIRIT OF GOD WILL LEAVE YOU.
[45:44] GOD WILL NEVER HEAR YOUR PRAYER.
[45:47] THEN YOU GET STUCK.
[45:51] Whatever you do, it cannot work.
[45:54] God doesn't like pride.
[45:58] PRIDE DOES NOT WORK. IF YOU LOOK AROUND
[46:00] YOU, even our message, THE BROTHER
[46:03] MESSAGE, ALL THE MINISTERS WHO LIFT
[46:06] THEIR SELF UP ABOVE ALL THE ministers
[46:09] where they are
[46:11] every
[46:14] GOHEAD THAT
[46:17] GOHEAD PRIDE, [screaming]
[46:19] PRIDE CANNOT TAKE YOU NOWHERE. AND
[46:21] PRIDE. THE WORD OF GOD IS NOT FOR
[46:24] ANYBODY. It's for God. By his grace, he
[46:28] has called us to use us.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:37] My
[46:38] Do you love the Lord?
[46:40] &gt;&gt; The love The Lord love you so much.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; God left po Saul.
[46:49] Then what he has to do? Even
[46:53] the prophet told told them go do you do
[46:56] this when he come? He took the the the
[47:00] the fat one, the good one, the poorish
[47:03] one. So this one I can use in my
[47:05] chamber. Oh, this one I can use my
[47:07] chamber. Oh, this one I can use my
[47:09] chamber.
[47:10] And the prophet came and said, "What did
[47:12] you do?
[47:15] What God told you to do? He didn't do
[47:17] that. You took whatever you want today.
[47:20] God strip everything that he have from
[47:22] you.
[47:25] So end up to where the witchcraft
[47:32] because he can hear if you God take his
[47:35] hand from you, you are nothing. YOU ARE
[47:37] DEAD AS DEAD CAN BE.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU ARE DEAD.
[47:45] A Christian without the Holy Ghost is
[47:49] nothing.
[47:52] If you don't have a Holy Ghost, then
[47:53] what are you doing here? YOU NEED THE
[47:56] HOLY GHOST. YOU NEED THE HOLY GHOST to
[47:59] guide you.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; SO WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST, GOD TAKE the
[48:02] Holy Ghost out from you. Where where
[48:04] would you be?
[48:07] &gt;&gt; You're done.
[48:09] By what? By pride.
[48:13] pride. He lifted himself up. Uzziah,
[48:17] King Uzziah,
[48:20] he was A A GOOD MAN. SERVE THE LORD ALL
[48:23] HIS DAYS.
[48:25] And one time he lift himself up
[48:30] above the prophet.
[48:34] And what God did
[48:37] RIGHT THERE
[48:39] instantly it struck him. leprosy.
[48:44] He never come back again. Through
[48:46] leprosy, he died. He died through the
[48:48] leprosy. 2 Chronicle.
[48:52] Hallelujah.
[48:55] So pride is not good for no nobody.
[49:02] I don't know why God give me this
[49:04] message, but this message is for
[49:06] everybody. Set yourself up.
[49:10] Sometime there's something inside there
[49:13] you don't know but you think you are
[49:16] right but you're not right. Sometime
[49:21] I I I know somebody perfectly healthy.
[49:25] I I I I I saw I saw this lady every
[49:29] morning. I said, you know, we we do
[49:31] this. We we say hello, good morning, how
[49:34] are you? And this and that. We talk, we
[49:36] laugh, and this. The next time, the lady
[49:39] was not sick. The same morning he went
[49:42] to work.
[49:44] From work he gets sick. From from work
[49:47] he gets sick. From that sickness, they
[49:50] take him to hospital. Two days he die.
[49:53] He was sick. He didn't know
[49:56] he was sick, full of debt.
[50:00] ALL everything is inside of her is done.
[50:03] But she was working. He was doing like
[50:06] you see him as a normal. Sometime you
[50:09] look like normal. But inside there's
[50:12] something there. That's why I said it's
[50:14] a body checkup.
[50:17] Check yourself.
[50:19] Don't let nothing hinder you and your
[50:22] salvation.
[50:23] That's only thing you have
[50:27] right now. If God has given you
[50:30] salvation,
[50:32] the eternal life,
[50:35] make it work for you.
[50:39] He gave it to you to use.
[50:42] If you DON'T USE, WHO GOING to use it?
[50:45] I'm using mine.
[50:48] What about yours?
[50:50] Use it.
[50:53] WHEN YOU MEET SOMEBODY IN THE IN in the
[50:55] in the street or anywhere, say hello.
[50:58] You don't know what the person going
[51:00] through. Just a say good morning. How
[51:02] are you today?
[51:05] And you smile the smile on your face

[1:02:10] Let your pride
[1:02:13] Moses
[1:02:15] all of them is samples
[1:02:19] that God given to us. It's a shadow for
[1:02:23] things for we to learn THAT HE DOESN'T
[1:02:27] play with his with with his word. God
[1:02:30] does not play with his word. When God
[1:02:33] see anybody serious about his word, he's
[1:02:36] always there with him.
[1:02:38] He's always there with him.
[1:02:41] One guy from from Africa during the war,
[1:02:46] he lost, they were coming to catch him.
[1:02:49] He was a king and he ran to the bush
[1:02:53] and God found him in the bush so many
[1:02:56] years. So everywhere he go my father God
[1:03:00] is always working with him and he called
[1:03:03] him my father
[1:03:06] and God brought him these people God
[1:03:08] brought him to United States. This is a
[1:03:10] true storyh this is not just a talk
[1:03:16] he DID SO MUCH MIRACLES SO MUCH IN
[1:03:20] AMERICA and they want to take him to
[1:03:22] school and that's where they kill him.
[1:03:25] They kill his his spirit. The spirit
[1:03:28] that was using him was no schooling
[1:03:31] because he know God face to face. He
[1:03:33] talked to God face to face. You take me
[1:03:35] to school for what? I don't care about
[1:03:38] my grammar. I KNOW THE LORD JESUS
[1:03:40] CHRIST. I DON'T CARE HOW I SPEAK. I CAN
[1:03:43] SPEAK AFRICAN TO YOU.
[1:03:46] HALLELUJAH. AND I'M NOT AFRAID AND I'M
[1:03:48] NOT SCARED. I'M NOT ASHAMED. I'M NOT
[1:03:50] ASHAMED FOR WHAT GOD HAS GIVEN TO ME. I
[1:03:53] DON'T CARE WHAT ANYBODY SAID. SO FAR AS
[1:03:55] IN THE LINE OF THE GOSPEL, I WILL DO IT.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; I will never let the pride take me out
[1:04:03] from my the presence of God. No.
[1:04:07] It doesn't matter.
[1:04:10] Hallelujah.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; I will I will I will work for the Lord.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; No matter what God give it to me,
[1:04:17] whatever he does to me, I will still
[1:04:19] praise him.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; I will still worship him. I will still
[1:04:23] glorify him. Hallelujah. And I know
[1:04:26] myself I cannot do nothing. If pain
[1:04:29] here, if pain pain is here, all what I
[1:04:32] feel is pain. I don't know how that pain
[1:04:34] going to go. I don't have all what I
[1:04:37] know. Lord, I feel pain.
[1:04:41] Wouldn't you take this pain away from
[1:04:43] me? You did for others and I know you're
[1:04:46] going to do for me. Thank you, Lord.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; And I just leave it there and the pain
[1:04:51] is gone.
[1:04:53] Hallelujah.
[1:04:55] Yesterday I went to the doctor. He said
[1:05:00] he I went to he he made me to do the
[1:05:03] blood test and everything and he said
[1:05:05] then he called me come come.
[1:05:08] I said okay I will come. I'm not scared.
[1:05:12] I went there. He looked everything. He
[1:05:15] said I am happy for everything that I
[1:05:18] see. Your blood, your sugar, your this,
[1:05:21] everything is perfect. Hallelujah.

[1:05:26] DON'T SCARED BECAUSE I KNOW MY LORD WILL
[1:05:29] TAKE CARE OF ME.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; HE WILL TAKE THE CARE OF ME TILL THE DAY
[1:05:34] THAT I LIVED HERE. MY JOB IS FINISHED.
[1:05:37] THEN HE WILL TAKE ME TO MY DESTINATION.
[1:05:40] AND I I am internal.
[1:05:43] I am eternal. I will not die.
[1:05:47] So if this body goes there, that's not
[1:05:49] me. My my real me is already gone.
[1:05:54] SO WHO WHAT I CARE? YOU THINK I CARE
[1:05:56] ABOUT THE DOCTORS? THANK GOD FOR THEM.
[1:05:59] Thank God for them. THEY'RE DOING THEIR
[1:06:01] JOB. BUT MY JOB is
[1:06:05] I'm a Christian and I believe the only
[1:06:08] one true maker, only one God who created
[1:06:10] heaven and earth, who made me, who
[1:06:13] called me and make me and give you a
[1:06:15] salvation. I GIVE YOU ETERNAL LIFE.

[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:06:26] Okay, I have a tape there. I'm going to

[1:06:33] How

[1:06:41] Speak to the rock. Hit the rock. Okay.
[1:06:45] The water come. You went smell the rock.
[1:06:48] Smile the rock. And God said, "Come
[1:06:50] here.
[1:06:52] YOU GR BY YOURSELF. [screaming]
[1:06:55] YOU DIDN'T DO WHAT I tell YOU TO DO.
[1:06:57] COME HERE." YOU SEE,
[1:07:00] you will never see that land that I I I
[1:07:03] I'm taking you. I promise you. But you
[1:07:07] take my glory.
[1:07:10] You take MY GLORY FOR YOURSELF. THEY ARE
[1:07:14] MY PEOPLE.
[1:07:16] You
[1:07:18] are his people.
[1:07:20] Right now, God has placed you under him.
[1:07:26] You have to listen to him.
[1:07:29] You understand? IT DOESN'T MATTER. YOU
[1:07:32] KNOW THE OLD days sometime they brought
[1:07:35] a a a a a 12 year old, six year old to
[1:07:38] be the king over Israelites.
[1:07:41] Who dare go go go go go go go go go go
[1:07:43] go go go go go go go go go go go and
[1:07:43] stand that king there because he's a kid
[1:07:45] or anything or whatever it is and say
[1:07:48] something to him you are dead when God
[1:07:52] set this his his things up his church up
[1:07:55] don't play with it
[1:07:59] stay with it and let God have his way
[1:08:03] and you'll be blessed
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; you are blessed you think when I say you
[1:08:10] are blessed you think I'm just joking.
[1:08:12] YOU ARE BLESSED.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T KNOW YOU are blessed. I AM
[1:08:16] BLESSED. YOU GOT TO EXERCISE and and get
[1:08:20] what you are blessing from yourself.
[1:08:24] You don't do you cannot see.
[1:08:27] You don't you don't search, you cannot
[1:08:30] find. You have to get it. You get it.
[1:08:34] You know, Brahma said when he when he
[1:08:37] goes to the bush and he want to see, he
[1:08:40] just pick up
[1:08:43] uh leaves, he throw it like that and he
[1:08:46] create a whirlwind
[1:08:49] and by the time you realize God is there
[1:08:52] speaking to God, do something
[1:08:56] to attract God. leaving your job, your
[1:09:00] skills, wherever you are, everything
[1:09:04] concern you, God is interested about it
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; because you are his son, you are his
[1:09:09] child, you are everything
[1:09:12] you he depend upon you. Please can you
[1:09:16] play that tape?
[1:09:32] show himself above somebody else. You
[1:09:34] remember when Moses did that?
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; You remember God gave him power
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; to do whatever he wanted to. Made him a
[1:09:41] prophet. He walked down to that rock and
[1:09:44] he smoked the rock the second time. That
[1:09:47] was against God's will.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; God said, "SPEAK TO THAT ROCK.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; DON'T SMITE IT AGAIN. You break all the
[1:09:54] all the the tithe here. The rock's only
[1:09:57] going to be smitten once. But he spoke
[1:09:59] of the weakness of the word when he did
[1:10:01] that. That wasn't sufficient. Yeah. The
[1:10:04] word was what was going on that rock was
[1:10:06] the word.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; See, he first time he smoked the rock
[1:10:09] and the waters come forth. And then they
[1:10:11] got thirsty again. He said, "Now go back
[1:10:13] and speak the rock." He's only smitten
[1:10:14] once.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; See the insufficiency of the word. Moses
[1:10:19] testified to it. The word wasn't right.
[1:10:22] He had to be smitten again. So Moses
[1:10:24] went down there and smoked the rock like
[1:10:26] that. He said, "Come forth." Did come
[1:10:28] forth. SO HE SPOILED AND SAID, "COME
[1:10:31] FORTH. I COMMAND YOU to come forth." The
[1:10:35] waters come. God said, "Come up here.
[1:10:39] Come here. YOU GLORIFIED [screaming]
[1:10:41] YOURSELF. YOU TOOK MY POWER. INSTEAD OF
[1:10:44] SANCTIFYING ME, you sanctified
[1:10:46] yourself." Yes.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Now you're not going over in the land.
[1:10:50] Look over and see what it looked like.
[1:10:52] But here you're going to leave right
[1:10:53] here. Oh my. And never has been one like
[1:10:56] Moses, you know.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; No. No. When he come to that show off
[1:11:01] with Jesus, HE SAID, "GET UP FROM THE
[1:11:04] TEMPLE HERE AND JUMP OFF." HE SAID,
[1:11:05] "IT'S WRITTEN." AMEN.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Don't tempt the Lord thy God.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; He met him at the word, not every major
[1:11:15] assault. No true servant ever tries to
[1:11:18] show himself off in with God's power. If
[1:11:22] he does, he loses his right hand.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Third greatest song.
[1:11:27] SATAN OFFERED TO FORFEIT THIS KINGDOM to
[1:11:30] him. He did.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; He did. Satan said, "See these kingdoms
[1:11:35] OF THE WORLD, THESE ARE MINE.
[1:11:39] I'LL DO THEM WHATEVER I WANT TO. I'LL
[1:11:42] FORFEIT THEM TO YOU."
[1:11:44] But you remember he was trying to get
[1:11:46] him to forfeit it without the cross.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; If he would be lost,
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; he could have kept the kingdom,
[1:11:55] but he must follow THE HE MUST COME
[1:11:57] BACK. HE WAS TEMPTED to do it now.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; That's a hard thing. He was tempted to
[1:12:04] take his liberty and be the king of the
[1:12:07] earth
[1:12:10] without the cross.
[1:12:12] But if you do, you're subject to the
[1:12:14] doubt. Satan would gladly made that
[1:12:16] proposition with him.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; But he said, "Get behind me, Satan."
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; He didn't do it.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; He come and suffered and took the hard,
[1:12:25] rugged route.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; He took the route of persecution. He
[1:12:30] took the route of death. Are we this
[1:12:32] morning willing to do that same route
[1:12:34] that he taken?
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Are we willing to die? Are we willing to
[1:12:38] give ourselves up to God? forfeit all
[1:12:42] the world and things to serve for him.
[1:12:44] See, now he failed to do it willingly to
[1:12:48] to forfeit it. Satan was to him, but he
[1:12:50] didn't do it. Though Jesus was tempted,
[1:12:53] he overcome for us. He
[1:12:59] He endured all temptation for me and for
[1:13:03] you. See, he could have took it right
[1:13:05] there.
[1:13:07] But what did he take the other out for?
[1:13:09] so that we could come be with him.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; And if he paid such a price as that,
[1:13:14] then how little would we be
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; not to take it?
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; And remember, there's nothing here
[1:13:23] anyhow.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; If you live a 100 years, what are you
[1:13:26] going to come to? Mental in your mind
[1:13:28] gone, all crippled up and old and shaky.
[1:13:31] That's where you're going.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; That's the end of it.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; You come now.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Overcome the things. How do you do it?
[1:13:38] by the word.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; What the word says you do. Walk humble.
[1:13:43] Live before Jesus. He endured all things
[1:13:45] for you and I. He is our example. How to
[1:13:48] overcome our evil generation as he
[1:13:51] overcome his evil generation. Remember
[1:13:54] when he comes to the earth just as much
[1:13:56] unbelief or more than there is at any
[1:13:57] time. It didn't bother him a bit.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Well, they called him a devil instead of
[1:14:02] God. When they call him,
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; see,
[1:14:05] humble thyself. Satan is always try to
[1:14:09] get you. You lose you you lose your
[1:14:12] guard,
[1:14:13] you're going to tempt you.
[1:14:16] So always let your
[1:14:19] your sword be sharp
[1:14:22] and you can reel like this.
[1:14:25] Satan scared of you
[1:14:27] cuz he know who you are. You have the
[1:14:31] power. You overshadow. You are threat to
[1:14:34] him.
[1:14:36] You see,
[1:14:38] so this is what I have for you today.
[1:14:42] Let down your pride and let the Holy
[1:14:45] Ghost have his way in your life,
[1:14:49] please. Is for you. Can the can the the
[1:14:53] musicians come?
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:57] This is a little exotic that I have for
[1:15:00] you.
[1:15:03] Praise God.
[1:15:06] Hallelujah.
[1:15:08] Amen.
[1:15:13] Hallelujah.
[1:15:14] Let us stand
[1:15:16] this evening.
[1:15:19] Do you believe that God is here?
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; He's here. There's not a service that
[1:15:25] God never be there. He's always there.
[1:15:28] If you need anything,
[1:15:31] don't look at me. Look at the word. The
[1:15:34] Lord Jesus Christ whom we worship.
[1:15:39] He is your peacemaker.
[1:15:41] He is your provider. He's your healer.
[1:15:44] He's your everything.
[1:15:47] Always give him the glory and honor
[1:15:49] [music] and praises. If you you need
[1:15:52] anything, just lift out your hand. Let
[1:15:55] me pray. Hallelujah. Oh God.
