[39:26] morning
[39:27] um I'm kind of excited about the word
[39:29] this
[39:29] morning um uh but at the same time you
[39:34] know uh just seeing everything that's
[39:35] been going on in the world we realize
[39:38] that the world is right now in great
[39:41] turmoil we see what's happening in
[39:43] Israel uh we could sit here and try and
[39:46] preach all kinds of messages around
[39:49] Israel and why this is happening and
[39:51] what you know how this is all we know is
[39:54] that uh God's Pro Prophet made it very
[39:57] clear that Israel is the focal point and
[40:00] the time piece for the world God started
[40:04] everything right there in the Middle
[40:06] East with a chosen people and um from
[40:10] there you know all we have to do is go
[40:12] back and read the scriptures and see how
[40:14] God dealt with Israel how God dealt with
[40:17] every one surrounding Israel it just
[40:21] seems to be that God has a a plan and we
[40:24] know that uh Israel going back into the
[40:27] Homeland was very significant is
[40:29] something that um we realized was
[40:32] prophetic according to the word of God
[40:34] it's not because you know uh we can you
[40:37] know we're Christians and we believe the
[40:39] word of God and we see Prophecy in the
[40:43] word and what God Said thousands of
[40:46] years before it actually happens then we
[40:48] see it happen and we know that that's
[40:51] God interpreting his own word we're not
[40:54] you know he says don't don't put your
[40:57] own interpretation lean not to your own
[40:59] understanding we could talk about all
[41:01] the details surrounding this whole event
[41:04] but God knows exactly what he's doing in
[41:08] allowing what's going on right now in
[41:10] Israel just in the same way that God is
[41:13] dealing right now with you that's what's
[41:17] important that's what stir my heart amen
[41:21] I can look and see oh the end is near
[41:23] and these things are happening in the
[41:25] world but you know how how's it going to
[41:28] affect my life where do I fit into this
[41:31] where do I see my part in the word of
[41:34] God Amen and how is it that um that I
[41:38] can fulfill my part my destiny and my
[41:42] purpose according to the word of God
[41:43] Amen because we all have one every
[41:46] single one of us praise God and that's
[41:49] what we're going to continue to look at
[41:50] in this series that we started on
[41:53] Wednesday it's all part of the rapturing
[41:55] faith series
[41:56] um that you know I believe that um
[41:58] there's there's a faith being released
[42:02] to the Sons and Daughters of God that's
[42:05] and all it's doing is making you more
[42:07] aware of who you are where you fit in
[42:10] the word and how it is that God is going
[42:13] to actually Rapture the church God is
[42:16] going to Rapture and remove his people
[42:19] from this Earth because the world is
[42:22] going into
[42:24] tribulation the evidence is right in the
[42:27] you just turn on the news right now and
[42:29] you'll see this world is in trouble amen
[42:33] and so we we know that this prophecy
[42:36] that was in the scripture that says the
[42:38] world's going to be going into Great
[42:40] Tribulation Jesus said like never before
[42:43] if if he says like never before then
[42:45] that means there's going to be things
[42:47] that we're going to see like we're
[42:48] seeing and witnessing right now of
[42:50] people being killed families being
[42:53] destroyed children being killed it's
[42:55] terrible it stirs and and and it should
[42:58] bring you to your knees to pray for
[43:01] these people and to pray that God will
[43:03] help them through it but they're they're
[43:04] in the prophecy they're in the prophecy
[43:07] and and we can't change that we can't
[43:10] change just like you couldn't change
[43:12] you're coming to this earth you being
[43:15] born into this country being born into
[43:17] this family having these types of
[43:20] characteristics around your life and so
[43:22] forth you couldn't you you you had
[43:25] nothing to do with that
[43:26] that was all part of God's plan for this
[43:30] Earth amen praise God and we need to
[43:33] understand that and that brings us to a
[43:36] balance when we can see the plan of God
[43:38] and recognize that this is all according
[43:41] to a plan that God had in his mind from
[43:45] before the foundations of the world and
[43:47] the suffering is is terrible and the joy
[43:52] is unspeakable it's a paradox Saints
[43:55] it's what it is is and we need to fall
[43:57] in step with the word that's where we
[44:00] can recognize our part and receive our
[44:04] inheritance and our blessing amen praise
[44:06] God so um let's read the the the
[44:11] scripture um our scripture will be the
[44:15] same one that we read on Wednesday
[44:19] evening I'm going to do a real Brief
[44:22] Review of Wednesday if you want to get
[44:24] it all you need to go back and just
[44:25] listen to it praise God I believe God
[44:28] laid in a foundation for us there on
[44:31] seeing yourself in the word today we're
[44:34] going to look at part two but let's read
[44:36] the scripture but we all with open face
[44:39] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[44:42] Lord are changed into the same image
[44:48] from glory to glory even as by the

[45:49] amen God bless you Saints you may be
[45:54] seated
[45:56] so
[45:58] Wednesday we looked at you know that
[46:01] that the the scripture when we're
[46:02] looking at the scripture we should be
[46:04] seeing ourselves we should be reading
[46:07] the word not only will you see Jesus
[46:10] Christ but in this hour and especially
[46:13] in this
[46:14] hour your calling is to be the bride of
[46:19] Christ the actual restored Church the
[46:23] restored Eve that fell back in the
[46:26] Garden of Eden we need to see you know
[46:29] you need to go back and and listen or
[46:31] read you know Christ The Mystery of God
[46:33] revealed you know brother brandham said
[46:35] that that that preaching that day he you
[46:38] know he felt like everything that he had
[46:41] uh been ministering on and all that he
[46:43] had been speaking about the Lord
[46:45] everything was all you know culminated
[46:48] right into that message and God was
[46:51] bringing such Clarity of who we are in
[46:55] the word of God God who Christ is what
[46:57] the mystery was that was back in the
[47:00] mind of God from before the foundations
[47:02] of the world we need to realize that God
[47:04] had a plan God is not just a nonchalant
[47:07] you know he's just going to let things
[47:09] be as they are no God could see the end
[47:12] from the beginning because he was
[47:14] eternal he's the alpha and he's the
[47:16] Omega he knew each and every one of us
[47:19] would come into this season in this time
[47:22] of the calling out of the eve the the
[47:25] the final restoration of the church that
[47:29] that Faith would come in this season
[47:31] that would literally change your mortal
[47:34] bodies that would literally change you
[47:37] from the person that you thought you
[47:39] were we're going to be looking at things
[47:41] here today that I I believe you know if
[47:43] if you just allow the Holy Spirit to um
[47:47] you know mirror his word back to you
[47:50] like you're looking into the mirror
[47:51] you're going to see through the
[47:53] character that we're going to be looking
[47:54] at here in the script scripture today
[47:56] you're going to see a portion of
[47:58] yourself a portion of your calling a
[48:01] portion of why God called you why he
[48:03] called you in this day in this hour the
[48:06] importance of it amen praise God and so
[48:09] when we look at the scripture when we
[48:11] study the word of God we should be
[48:12] seeing ourselves the more we study and
[48:15] we meditate on the word we pray we
[48:17] should see the glory of God and that the
[48:20] glory is actually your true reflection
[48:24] God is reflecting
[48:26] himself in you it was always Christ
[48:29] through every single age but this is the
[48:32] age where the bridegroom and the bride
[48:35] meet in the air for a great uh uh time
[48:39] of Fellowship for three and a half years
[48:41] the world goes into absolute chaos it's
[48:45] called the Great Tribulation this is the
[48:48] scripture this is what we've been uh
[48:51] given in this day and in this hour and
[48:53] this is what we we we will manifest in
[48:55] our Liv lives that's why you can't help
[48:57] it you you know you're out you're out
[48:59] there and you're mingling with the rest
[49:01] of the world and you're talking to other
[49:02] Christians I sit with ministers I sit
[49:05] with priests I hear them just talking
[49:08] about the word of God and denying the
[49:10] word of God and you know uh rejecting
[49:13] the word of God uh you know but what is
[49:16] it it's because it's been revealed unto
[49:19] you to know the things of God for this
[49:22] day and in this hour and you can't help
[49:24] it you can't help but see exactly what
[49:28] you're
[49:28] seeing you look in the word and the word
[49:31] speaks back to you and shows you who you
[49:34] are amen praise God and so this is
[49:37] what's called perfect Faith by
[49:41] Revelation seeing your part seeing who
[49:44] you are so that you can have confidence
[49:47] to
[49:48] stand and know that when you testify or
[49:52] give a testimony of Jesus Christ you
[49:55] know that you know it's not something
[49:57] that you're just you know you were
[49:59] brought up in a church and you you went
[50:01] to scho you know church on Sundays and
[50:03] your parents forc you to go to church
[50:05] and you know and even today people go to
[50:07] church by tradition they go because they
[50:10] think it's you know that that it's the
[50:12] right thing to do they but a real a real
[50:16] experience with Christ it changes all of
[50:19] that it makes Church a reality that it
[50:22] goes beyond your your human
[50:25] understanding and that's why when you
[50:27] fellowship with people that are just
[50:28] denominational and they just go to
[50:30] church by tradition and they believe
[50:32] their traditions instead of believing
[50:34] the word of God there's the difference
[50:38] you see you will always believe the word
[50:40] they will believe their tradition you
[50:42] tell them that babies being baptized is
[50:44] totally insignificant to God they'll
[50:47] tell you well no that's what my priest
[50:50] taught us that's what my parents did so
[50:52] that's what we do so that's a tradition
[50:55] Jesus when he was here on Earth he stood
[50:58] in front of all the priests of that day
[51:00] he was the word right there standing in
[51:03] front of them and and he told them clear
[51:05] he says Listen by your Traditions you've
[51:08] made the word of none effect to the
[51:11] people so now the people they'll just
[51:13] baptize their babies they'll do first
[51:16] communions they'll do it all because
[51:18] it's all part of their teaching all part
[51:21] of their you know their their their
[51:24] their books
[51:25] right but God has his own word God's his
[51:29] own interpreter God says I'm going to
[51:32] give you the Holy Ghost I'm going to
[51:34] place my spirit inside of you so that
[51:37] when you read the word you're going to
[51:39] know what is
[51:40] truth and and and that's why you know
[51:43] they that worship me must worship me in
[51:47] spirit and in
[51:49] truth praise God amen glory to God so
[51:52] you know as we Minister as US minister
[51:55] we Minister the word of God we read the
[51:58] quotes of brother brandham we're holding
[52:00] up a mirror and we're seeing if you can
[52:02] see yourself in that mirror some people
[52:06] will look at the quotes of brother
[52:07] brandham they'll look at his life and
[52:09] they'll look at it all and they will not
[52:11] see a reflection at all all the that's
[52:13] false that's not that's that's you're
[52:16] following a man you're this that because
[52:19] they can't it there's no
[52:21] reflection there's there's no
[52:23] representation in that in the word of
[52:25] God so unless your name is written in
[52:28] the book you won't reflect back to see
[52:31] truth you're going to you're going to
[52:33] see tradition you're going to see man's
[52:34] teachings you're going to see what what
[52:36] you've been taught and you're going to
[52:38] deny the actual word of God and Jesus
[52:41] said search the scriptures for in them
[52:45] you think you have eternal life and they
[52:50] are they that testify of
[52:54] Mary no
[52:56] Jus
[52:58] Jesus the
[53:00] Saints Jesus in the
[53:03] Saints you see it's all leading us back
[53:08] to the
[53:09] word praise God so today we're going to
[53:13] be looking at um let's go to the next
[53:16] scripture we're going to read from the
[53:19] book of Luke Chapter 5 from verse 5 to
[53:24] 11 and Simon answering said unto him
[53:28] Master we have toiled all night and have
[53:33] taken nothing nevertheless at Thy word I
[53:37] will let down the net and when they had
[53:40] done this they enclosed a great
[53:43] multitude of fishes and their net break
[53:47] and they beckoned unto their Partners
[53:50] which were in the other ship that they
[53:52] should come and help them and they came
[53:55] came and filled both ships so that they
[53:58] began to sink when Simon Peter saw it he
[54:03] fell down at Jesus knees saying depart
[54:08] from me I am a sinful man oh Lord for he
[54:12] was astonished and all that were with
[54:16] him at the drought of the fishes which
[54:19] they had taken and so was also James and
[54:22] John and the sons of Zebedee which which
[54:25] were partners with Simon and Jesus said
[54:28] unto Simon fear not from henceforth Thou
[54:32] shalt catch men and when they had
[54:35] brought their ships to land they forsook
[54:39] all and followed him amen praise God
[54:44] today we're going to be taking a look at
[54:49] Jesus Calling
[54:51] Peter how Jesus you know how uh Peter
[54:55] was just a common man back in his day he
[54:57] just happened to be a
[54:59] fisherman but Peter was in God's plan
[55:03] Peter was written into the word of God
[55:06] Simon Peter was gonna have an
[55:08] intervention in his life he was going to
[55:12] meet Jesus who would tell him about
[55:16] himself amen praise God and so at this
[55:21] time I'd like the audio team to prepare
[55:25] we have a short clip that we're going to
[55:26] be watching it's just under 10 minutes I
[55:30] believe you will be very blessed by it
[55:33] and then we're going to talk about it
[55:35] and we're going to look at it and we're
[55:37] g to see what it is that the Lord is
[55:40] revealing to us through it they could
[55:43] just put the lights
[55:54] down
[56:04] we have audio
[56:17] right
