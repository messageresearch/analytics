we come that's why we uh assemble ourselves the scripture says even more so as that day approaches and I don't know about you but that day is so so close it's approaching so quickly when you just look around and you look at the conditions of the world and the circumstances that are taking place right now in the world it's certainly um it's certainly real and it's certainly a time where if you claim to be a Christian you need to examine yourself amen praise God and so we are grateful to be here I welcome all of our guests all of our visitors all those that are new that have been attending God

God is is doing something wonderful in this day and in this hour we want to be a part of it amen praise God so please put your names on the board amen praise God so this morning we're going to continue um where we left off last Sunday um on the thought of come and see and I believe if there's ever a time where we want to remind people you know look around just look around at the conditions of the world look around what's you know what's going on in Israel Israel at War Israel is God's time piece did you know that he says you need to watch Israel if you want to know what God is doing right now and what he's going to be doing then you need to keep your eyes on Israel because they're God's time piece on what he's going to do and what is coming upon the Earth amen praise God and so um you just look at what's going on politically in America a divided America a divided Canada it's it's turmoil and Chaos everywhere you don't have just political parties that are you know just saying well you know we think we can do better or we think no it's a different kind of environment right now it's it's evil it's wicked it's it's uh you know you just look at the way they they they they talk about one another and the things that they say about one another and the way that they talk it's a shame to actually call it politics it's not politics it's prophecy being fulfilled where a world is in total chaos and falling apart that's what it is and when you look at the Olympics right now and what's taking place there and the opening ceremonies of the Olympics it's a shame it's an outright mockery of Jesus Christ the word of God so if there's ever a time you want to come and see it's now because things are really quickly falling apart in the world praise God Amen so let's uh let's play that um that video um just for a moment and then we will uh get straight to the word of God Amen [Music] [Music] hey man let us stand let's pray father we are certainly excited this morning Lord to hearken under that invitation Lord many of us hearkened many years ago some maybe just waiting for that final uh uh surrender Lord whatever you know every heart in every life but we are rejoicing this morning that we came to see and Lord we are rejoicing that we answered that call and so father we ask that your spirit would now come and speak to us Lord as we search the scriptures as we read and as we look to you father for inspiration and Direction Lord may you go to every heart and every life knowing exactly where each one of us are you know what we need Lord you know uh the desperation that's in some of our hearts Lord Maybe we've come to a place Lord where we just we want to give up and we just want to surrender it all to you father let this be that day father and that you would answer that you would speak that you would make yourself known in such a way Lord that that it would change and transform Our Lives Lord and that we could not contain it but we would have to go and tell it to somebody Grant it Lord we pray this morning anoint everything from speaker to to hear to the atmospheres Lord speak our living God speak in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you Saints it says here in St John chapter 1: 43 to 51 we continue where we left off last week the day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee and findeth Phillip and saith unto himf follow me now philli was of bethia the city of Andrew and Peter Philip findeth Nathaniel and saith unto him we have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph and Nathaniel said unto him can there any good thing come out of Nazareth Philip saith unto him come and see Jes Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him and saith unto him behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no guile Nathaniel saith unto him when knowest thou me Jesus answered and said unto him before Philip called thee when thou was under the Fig Tree I saw thee Nathaniel answered and said unto him Rabbi Thou Art the Son of God Thou Art the king of Israel Jesus answer answered and said unto him because I say unto thee I saw thee under the Fig Tree believest thou Thou shalt see greater things than these and he saith unto him verily verily I say unto you Hereafter ye shall see Heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the son of man amen praise God God bless you Saints you may be seated you know um last week we were looking at uh you know John the Baptist ministry and we saw how you know John had caught and was called of the Lord he he had caught the revelation of the Lord in his day he knew that the that he was um you know fulfilling scripture that he was the one that was the one that was uh crying out in the wilderness behold he was making the way for the Lord amen we looked at how he pointed his disciples that that followed him he pointed them to Christ John the Baptist William brandham did not point the people to himself he pointed the people to Christ amen and this is the hour where the Bride of Jesus Christ has recognized the hour that she's living in that she has received the word of the Lord through a Vindicated Prophet amen and that she now has the the the privilege and the duty to point others to Christ amen amen not to point people to our ministry oh we've got a great ministry oh he's a great preacher oh he's a great leader no we're pointing to the almighty God the Lord Jesus Christ he's the one that you need to know and he's the one that actually knows you amen all we're doing is we're we're we're introducing him amen just like John the Baptist just like William Branham just like all the the the you know the reformers Martin Luther when he broke away from the Catholic church just like Wesley they were pointing to Christ they were not pointing to themselves amen praise God and so we looked at some principles next slide we looked at principle number one it's never about us but it's always about Jesus amen we looked at principle number two and it said that you need to ask yourself when Jesus asked the disciples what seek ye he was asking them hey what's caught your attention here what what situation are you in right now in your life that all of a sudden you need me that you want to follow me what are you looking for he says come and see come and see I believe there's something there and we W to you know we want to check our motives in our heart and and you know people sometimes they got to get to a place of desperation and then we looked at principle number three and Andrew immediately told his brother once that fire was lit within Andrew he knew that the Messiah was real because the Messiah actually knew him he came to realize that when he stayed with the Messiah that night and they got into Fellowship him and and Phillip and the other disciples they came to realize wait a minute we it's not so much that he that that that we found him he found us am amen praise God Jesus said here he says listen greater things you know after he discerned Nathaniel and and told him who he was Nathaniel immediately lit up and realized wait a minute this is the message of the hour Hallelujah this is the word of God for my day and he's actually made me a part of this and this is the Glorious greater things the promises that we're going to be looking at today as we as we look into the word of God Amen and we look to see what the Lord has in store for us you know um it really should cause us to think and examine ourselves and you know I was I was doing a little bit of research around that you know um the last couple of days and um I want you to know something I want you to know that you've got a much higher purpose in life you as a son or a daughter of God you might be trapped right now in the cares of life and the situations that you're dealing with right now you're so embedded with everyday life that you know that that you just haven't taken the time to stop and examine yourself and came across some questions you know um because you know you can get so caught up with everything that you're doing and the person that you've become up until now that you figure oh well that's just who I am that's just the way I am but God has a much higher purpose and plan for your life you see those that that are that are uh you know dealing with situations and and circumstances and and emergencies and uh things going on in their lives the scripture says that it all works for good to them that are called according to his purpose and the key element here is being called according to his purpose and this is the thing that you know that I I want to I want to challenge you today I want to challenge you to examine yourself see where you're at and I want you to to know that just because you you you've come to this place now in your life this is not just all that you are you're a lot more God God if God is going to speak to you you're going to know that you're a lot more than what you are today but you know the secret begins when we can you know uh look at this and examine ourselves to look at some of these situations because some of us are found lost in the sea of life and we need a lighthouse to bring us back to who we really are bring us out of the conditions that we can get into some people get so you know caught into mental oppression and to to the point where they find themselves in a state of depression and they need counseling they need you know uh people doctors and so forth and the world around us right now when you you know if you start to really look at what's going on I mean just look at the situations look at what you know you look at that opening ceremony of the Olympics how they were mocking the the the Last Supper they had drag queen and you know in that in that group there mocking the Lord's Supper they had homosexuals they had um all kinds of wickedness actually mocking Jesus Christ that ought to tell you right there my God there is something serious in the condition of this world today and you need to really examine where you stand with all of that because a lot of people they get they get so caught up into the every day that it's you know becoming common for it to to be on the TV imagine you know your children watching these Opening Ceremonies and they're there and it's all entertainment to them but meanwhile their minds are being injected with Antichrist anti- word against God teachings and the people are getting so numb to the circumstances that they don't realize that they're caught into the mental trap of it all wake up it's time to examine and check yourself and see where you're at amen and you know uh there's some questions here that we can look at you know because when Jesus said what seek ye I believe that that is something that that is is you know coming from God himself he's asking that question to you this morning and he's saying examine yourself check yourself because if I'm calling you if I'm asking you to uh uh what you're looking for it's because I have something in store for you I've got something great for you that's what he told Nathaniel when when when Nathaniel recognized that he was the king you know it's because he he got he got so excited but it was because God knew him the Lord Jesus knew him and said listen I got greater things in store for you and I believe God's got greater things in store for us amen amen praise God so you know I was looking at some things here and I came across these questions here they're from an individual by the name of Frederick uh Bush bushner okay and you know they were just questions that he wrote and here I'm just going to read them to you because I thought they were relevant questions question number one when you look at your face in the mirror what do you see in it that you most like and what do you see in there that you most dislike see a lot of people are too carnal and their way of thinking is based on what they see but it's not on what you see but it's on what he sees question number two if you had only one last message to leave to a handful of people who are most important to you what would it be in 25 words or less it gets you to kind of like really examine oh wait a minute if I only you know I I if this if this was the last message that I could leave to mankind it really gets you to examine yourself and think about what's really what's really a priority in your life and it kind of allows you to see where you're at of all the things you have done in your life which is the one you would most like to undo and which is the one that makes you happiest to remember you know just examining ourselves because some people they they have one bad experience in their life and they hold on to it and they stay chained in the circumstances of that event and they don't allow themselves to be set free to actually see how their lives can be liberated and set free from the bondage of those events is there any person in the world or any cause that if the circumstances called for it you would be willing to die for it or for her or for him makes you think what would you die for what would you you know give your life for there is no other life but eternal life there is no greater life than the Life of Christ there is nothing that that can you know death has no sting over the Sons and Daughters of God if there were If This Were the last day of your life what would you do with it you know if you look at all these questions that I just asked here it really gets you to look at yourself really get you to examine yourself you know we're just laying in a little Foundation here here because you know I I want you to know that that you can be set free of all those things that went through your mind all those events you know those bad events that you could turn around those things you know that thought of what you know what could be the the the the last message that I could leave for my friends and my family I believe there's a message here this morning that will fill that void amen Jesus said come and see and when Jesus said come and see he brought them into a a place where not only did they realize that they had followed the Messiah but they had come to realize that the Messiah knew exactly who they were amen praise God and so now we continue that was just kind of a quick review of um of last week and now we want to move on and we want to look at part two because we're looking at the promise of the greater things amen praise God I believe you know like I had no idea I had no idea that when when I got into the to the worst you know state in my life and when things were falling apart I was addicted to drugs I had you know I had a family that that was was falling apart I I had no real you know um Financial um Clarity in my life everything was just a risk didn't know if you know if I was going to make it from one year to the next because I was a you know I was an entrepreneur and I was willing to to to try anything you know because constantly looking for that for for that you know physical uh natural fix looking for for you know financial gain and and and looking for the the things that would s satisfy this I had no idea that God would enter into my life would call my name would would would uh tell me about myself tell me about how much he knew me amen praise God no idea that this was going to come into my life and didn't realize that now I'm 30 years later experiencing the greater things that he had available and it just keeps getting better and better and better you know Phillip when Jesus um you know uh here let's let's go to the next scripture next slide St John we're we're continuing in the book of St John and I want you to pay attention here um how this all just unfolds everything is just unfolding here and you know Jesus coming into his public Ministry being introduced by John the Baptist and then the disciples come to recognize who he was and as you know you read through the book of St John you come into these scriptures here and you come to realize that hang on a minute here the Lord has a a a plan here that overrides everything that you know that I thought you know being a Christian was that I thought you know I just join a church you know we were brought up you know Catholics Baptists Presbyterians uh Pentecostals whatever ever Jehovah Witness could have been Buddhas you could have been you know new age whatever it is you you're all brought up and you all had this concept of you know of of what it is to be a part of that particular um teaching right but here now I want you to pay attention this is the this is the reality teaching this is where you know you come into the greater things this is where you come to realize that this is more than just joining a church there's more than just you know being a church member or being a preacher or being a deacon or a trustee it's a lot more than that amen being a Sunday school teacher you know is a lot more than that it's coming into a realization that you're actually one of his that you're that that you're important to him that you're actually his wife his bride his his closest allies right now here on the earth listen to him here he says he says um St John 14:6 now he's speaking to Phillip and Jesus saith unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me if you have known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him now here God is making the Lord is making very clear who he is okay because until you know who Jesus Christ is and that he is the absolute he's the one that can answer every question he's the one that forgives your sin he's the one that can set you free from the bondage of mental oppression of broken relationships of sickness cancer whatever it is he's the only one and he wants to make that clear he's making that clear right here to Phillip make it it it clear to him and Philip saith unto him Lord show us the father and it sufficeth us Jesus saith unto him now look Phillip was still in a questioning condition you know he was kind of confused like a lot of people out there they're confused over the Trinity they can't quite figure out who Jesus is is he just the son or is he uh you know a part of the father or who's the Holy Ghost is that another entity no if you've seen me listen to what he says have you been with me so long time have I been with you long time with you and yet hast thou not known me Phillip he that hath seen me hath seen the father can I read that again does it say anything there but Trinity no it says he that hath seen me hath seen the father and how sayest thou then show us the father why are you asking me to show you the father believest thou not that I am in the father and the father is in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very Works sake he was he was very clearly showing to these disciples showing to Phillip and anyone that was around him who he was and until an individual comes to see who Jesus Christ truly is they cannot truly surrender and give their lives to the absolute because you find that you you you'll find yourself in a state of confusion until you're willing to put aside Buddha put aside man's teachings doctrines of man priests that are going to intercede for you the scripture makes it very clear that there is only one intercessor that is Jesus Christ amen he's the one that died on the cross for you he's the one that died for your sin amen and he's the one that Rose for the resurrection to be inside of you so that you can be translated out of this world that's going into tribulation in this day and in this hour listen here brother brandham speaking here in the message identification no sorry from Christ The Mystery of God revealed he says now notice god making himself known not we're not supposed to make converts to Christianity by a government we're not to to convert people we don't convert people we testify that God just like Phillip just like Nathaniel just like Andrew he had to go and tell you know his brother right away he he needed to tell him Hey listen you need to you need to come and see you need to see that that that that I found the Messiah that he's a reality and when Peter entered into the presence of the Lord Jesus and when somebody you invite them to come and see and they come into the presence of God in church and they get sincere and they get serious about their condition and where they're at Jesus will open himself and reveal himself to them and they will never be the same listen he says not make converts to Christianity by a government but by the Revelation the Christ in you amen as God was in Christ as God was in Christ Christ in you now when what God did in Christ Christ does in you pay attention now okay because Jesus was the word made flesh in his day 2,000 years ago that's why he said it's not I that doeth the works but the Father the spirit the anointing of the Holy Ghost the Elohim the self-existent one the one who's had plans from before the foundations of the world he is the one that doeth the works he's the one that is manifesting himself in front of you and Discerning you and letting you know that you're a part of him and so Christ in you so what Christ does in you what signs did God in Christ Christ does in you oh isn't that beautiful oh he says oh my I like that Jesus said at that day that's this day he says at that day when this Revelation is made known you will know that I am in the father and the father is in me and I in you and you in me when the Revelation is made manifest at that day ye shall know that I and the father are one he didn't say I and the father are two he didn't say I the father and the Holy Ghost are three he said I and the father are one I am in in the father and the father is in me then when the Revelation comes forth now pay attention then it's I in you and you in me then there you are see manifold the three manifold what for to bring it back we've got to be brought back amen God is restoring us out of our spiritual Amnesia that's why I say God has got a greater purpose for you and there's many of you know there's many people out there that are still under the Amnesia and you know part of the Amnesia is to just be a church member because there's a lot more church members that are under the Amnesia than there are not amen because a lot of people are following what they think is the word of God but don't realize that they're following the doctrines of man they're under the teachings of man they're under false teachings to the point where they they they think that everything is fine and that's why many are going to come to the Lord Jesus on that day and say Lord Lord have I not cast out devils in your name have we not laid our hands on the sick and and and and they recovered read the scripture Jesus looks and says I never knew you can you imagine what a disappointment that's going to be I never knew you because to know it you know Jesus never revealed himself to them Jesus they they had no representation in him all that the father hath given me will come people think that anybody can come to Jesus no no it's not that way there's got to be representation on both sides those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book from before the foundations of the world amen listen here in the message identification then see God came down and the character of God was Christ he was the reflection he was God made visible notice God made visible in the beginning was God he wasn't even God then no God is an object of worship people want to talk about God not realizing who God actually is it's something that because everybody needs something to worship but this is not about worshiping a god this is about understanding that God is in you that that is the true revelation of this hour that brings you into a revelation of Deliverance you can't even be delivered unless you know that God wants to fill you and that God is in you and his spirit is the holy spirit that delivers you am amen opens your understanding so he goes on here he says in the beginning was God he wasn't even God then he was an object of worship only thing he was was the Eternal and in him was attributes and those attributes were thoughts and those thoughts was expressed to words and the Word was made manifest what is it it's all God becoming tangible and you are a part of God and so when you receive this message and you you know people say oh why do you go to that church it's not about going to that church it's about the fact that that church and the people that go to that church and the minister that minister at that church have a revelation of Jesus Christ in the present stage of his ministry and when you come into the present stage of Christ Ministry you'll be like Phillip like Andrew like Nathaniel like the disciples back there you will have the same sort of zeal that they had you will start to express the same kind of life that they had because not only did they find the Messiah they came to realize that the Messiah was in them reconciling himself reconciling all of his children back to himself the scripture says this is a about reconciliation this is about uh redeeming you know to redeem something it had to be lost before you could redeem it and so you're you you were lost in spiritual Amnesia coming into this world as an attribute of God like it says here and that attribute got caught into a a life you know it it was birthed under a certain parents it took on a shell but remember the attribute that's the life of God that's the seed of God and that is where God placed it into human hearts he placed it there for a certain time in a certain season when he would call that attribute to the attention of the word and by being brought to the attention of the word you actually start to manifest the word that's why people say man you're just you're you're a lot like Jesus e you're you're a Jesus freak you know you like to talk about Jesus all the time Jesus lives in me how can I not talk about him that's what that's the message of the hour that's what delivered me from the from the bondage of drug addiction from the bondage of of depression from the bondage of broken relationships he delivered me from all of that and now I live to manifest his word amen I can't help it he's it's not I that doth the works it's he that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works amen what is it it's all God becoming tangible and you are a part of God and Jesus come to redeem those that was put there it is on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundations of the world so don't listen don't argue with people no oh I you're not saved you are saved oh you you might be saved don't get into that because listen if you're saved you were already saved before you came into this dimension your name was already written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundations of this Earth this world so don't argue about who is and who isn't it's all written it's in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation it was in God's thoughts and that's what he come to redeem and and them as soon as it strikes to them they see it now now now I hope you know this this is what we represent if Good Neighbor Ministries represents anything it's hey come recognize your day and its message because when Christ is revealed under the power of His anointing under his ministry under his will according to the word he backs the word amen he speaks he calls he places he he adds to the church amen he he takes out of the church amen oh yeah listen if there's Spirits are going to come in here and they're going to mock the word and they're not going to come under subjection to the word and they're not going to want to be totally surrendered to the word pay tithes offerings it's not something that you have to do tithes and offerings is not something that you have to do it's something that you are when you've received Christ you you you can't wait but to fulfill that portion of the word because you know there's a greater promise attached to that portion of the word amen thank you and all of a sudden all your needs are met because you have a revelation that God is Jehovah Gyra he's the one that puts the checks in the bank he's the ones that can stop them at any time he's the one that gives he's the one that takes and when you've come into that full understanding of surrender you know I was reading the book of Chronicles this week and and it was how the the children of Israel how you know the king went before them and he said listen I am freely giving of so many thousand pounds of gold and so many thousand pounds of silver and and all the precious things that that that that have been stored up that I've gathered together I'm freely giving them to the building of the house of the Lord he has had such a revelation and and the people that were there witnessing and hearing him speak under that Revelation because God was with him God was vindicating that he was with him and the people that caught that Revelation they started to give to the point where they couldn't even they had to build cities to contain all these riches and be because now where did all these riches come from that they could give so much and just keep giving they tapped into the Eternal well of Jehovah Gyra and God keeps his promises and you want to live prosperous then you need to you need to live the life of Christ in a way where you show Prosperity amen where where you're not you're not afraid to give you don't let the left hand see what the right hand is doing amen praise God hallelujah this is the life of of Christ and then as soon as it strikes them they see it because the life is in there remember the attribute of God that he placed in you before the foundations of the world before you came into this Dimension he placed a seed in there and I often asked the Lord I said Lord you waited 33 years to call that seed but it was there from before the foundations of the world brother Gabe but he had it in his mind that I had to go to Fetti interiors and I had to go buy some furniture and some words had to be spoken in order for that time and season it was in God's time God's season and something awoke in that attribute totally unconscious I was totally unaware but all of a sudden there was a thirst that started to stir up inside it starts to bubble on the inside and if you have something in you that's stirring you to go deeper to go deeper into the word of God to say hey you know what maybe I got to listen you know to Pastor Danny and you know maybe just just take one step closer you know maybe just go a little deeper with the Lord some people just don't want to stay there long enough to allow the spirit of God to start to speak and deal and and melt their hearts and and and and and just get them to a place where they where they recognize yes it is I it is I I it's I that speaketh to thee you know that's the voice of God that that will change you transform you you'll never ever be the same amen praise God why because the life is in there but if the life isn't there listen here now then what can they do see he says they don't see it they'll never see it see and the whole thing as Jesus said at that day you'll know that I am in the Father the father in me and I and you you'll know you will know okay and you and me the whole thing is God becoming material like a husband and a wife becoming one together amen God and his church becoming one amen praise God H Allelujah John 1:1 says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God so remember when the word starts to manifest through your life it's God it's God in your life it's the holy ghost power in your life it's the holy ghost power delivering you from sickness it's now the holy ghost power that's setting you free from your from your sin and and all your shame amen praise God the word now is in you amen the same was in the beginning with God and look he says here God is his own interpreter brother Bram says now William Branham I want you to know these are quotes from William Branham just like you can take quotes from Martin Luther you can take quotes from John Wesley but I believe that you know William Branham was revelated as a prophet in the 20th century and his life was V indicated by the by the power and by the spirit of God to show that God was behind the words that he was speaking and that's why we take quotes from William Branham in order for us to draw the inspiration that God released in this time and in this season for us under the revelation of our day not Luther's day not Wesley's day not Pentecostals day but this day there's a word for this day remember that's the word that set you free he says what I mean attributes was his thoughts a and a word is a thought expressed and then that was in his thinking and when he said let there be and there was let there be and there was and now remember you Christians were his thoughts before there was a World imagine that you were his thoughts before there was this world pay attention and you are the manifestation of his thinking so you're manifesting him in July of 2024 you're manifesting the word and people that that come around you because of the anointing that that's on you by you accepting the word they will get blessed they will they will get touched they it just it just it's not you remember it's the word amen that's why when Jesus started to walk amongst the people all of a sudden people were were were popping up you know blind Bas the minute that that that that he heard Jesus Son of David have mercy on me listen to what Jesus said he said what do you have need of like he didn't know what he had need of like Jesus doesn't know what you need like you don't think he knows you he you don't think he knows where you are right now you don't think he knows where you are right now people out there that are listening in you know from online God knows exactly where you are right now the situation that you're in right now you might be caught in adultery you might be caught in drug addiction alcoholism homosexuality God knows and if he knows you he's calling you to come out and come and see and come and recognize what he can do in transforming your life by accepting his Spirit which is his word amen glory to God and you are the manifestation of his thinking before there was before there was even a world you were in Christ amen in God in the beginning that makes you then you see his subjects and the whole thing is God himself materializing himself tangible when somebody meets with you and says brother can you pray for me sister can you pray for me I want you to know that if you know that he is in you that that that that you know on that day that the father dwelleth in me I want you to know that when you pray for that individual God will honor his [Applause] word he's not going to honor your word he's going to honor his word because you've recognized your day you've recognized your hour you've recognize that you've been then the people will know that you've been with Jesus Hallelujah God himself materializing tangible so that he could be handled seen and so forth and that's what God is the whole thing amen glory to God Amen he is the super sign in this day and in this hour and not only is is is he expressing the super sign through his word but he's expressing it through you listen here in the message the super sign he says oh God if the world could only see that that God and man are one that you become one with Christ that's why you can't deny the word when you become one with Christ when somebody says to you how are you baptized and you tell I was baptized as a baby right away the moment that you speak that if you're an attribute of God the moment you speak that you're going to say whoa wait a minute here a baby I was baptized as a baby I remember when that struck me he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved how does a baby believe a maybe can't believe but somebody that's under stress oppression under that that that desperation where they need change in their lives where they want to see God move in the situation that they're dealing amen they want to see the power of God then God all of a sudden they they look up I remember that day I remember in 1991 there was people had just delivered another set of documents this thick you know suing me and I was I was in a state of total depression and op I was actually sitting on my bed contemplating how I would commit suicide I was thinking could I drive off the road could I this is what because that's how bad that's how how low things had gotten in my life back then I had no idea but I do remember this one thing I looked up and I said if there is a God I need it I need need you right now that's all I remember and so something has to come at some point when when when something inside of you it's the time it's the season that stirs and you look up and you're starting to look for for the answer and you and and and you come across this message like I came across this message when brother Gabe took me there on that Wednesday night service and here he was talking about the woman at the well and how her life was a life of prostitution and all I could see was my whole life a life of prostitution that's all I could see and I realized but then right there and then he spoke and he said come and see come and see I had no idea what I was going to find I had no idea that I was going to be found Hallelujah glory to God Amen he found me he found you it's not you finding him it's him finding you in the state in the in the condition that you're in and then you believe and then you go to the water and realize whoa you mean I can I can be buried in that water and I can leave that old life behind oh yes you can you can leave you can bury that life behind and you can come out in the newness of life and you will not deny the word of God because every son and daughter of God has to come God's provided way you cannot deny the word of God Amen so here he says here God and man are one the super sign was that first man and God could come into all that God was he poured into Christ amen remember when God When when when when he went to the Virgin Mary and he told her that that you're going to Bear a son and she said be it unto me according to Thy word and she brought forth that body that was a human body that had been spoken into her womb and brought forth so that God God could get inside that body and do and fulfill the purpose and the plan and the word for his day the word that needed to be manifest in that day and in that hour amen and here he was he was the Super sign of that day that was man that God could come into all that God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was he's now poured into the church so now the church which is the body of Christ those that believe the word how can you call yourself a church and and and you deny the baptism you deny you know that that Jesus Christ is the only mediator between man and God you put the Virgin Mary before Jesus Christ who went to the Cross Mary or Jesus like like you know the Purgatory there's no Purgatory in the scripture there's going to be a hell Purgatory for those that that that that reject the word of God that's not me saying it that's the word that says that there'll be weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth because they rejected the word when it came to them remember this is the word coming to you this is the hour where Jesus Christ is saying Hey I want to manifest myself in the present stage of the word for this day and in this hour and I need you to be the tangible manifestation of my word for this day and for this hour and you cannot deny my word and say you are of the word so all that was in Christ was poured into the church super sign God and man together and that was to be the Super sign of the last last day when the entire Bible was to be fulfilled in the last days remember all scripture heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away and all scripture must be fulfilled including the scripture that talks about you talks about you thank you talks about you and you and you and you and every single attribute of of God God is calling you under the opening of that seventh seal we're not going to get into all of that now but that's that's what we're manifesting right now when those seals were open it was because the names that were written under those last end time Sons and Daughters of God that were to come into manifestation would be called and that's why we have a peculiar message that's why we speak different that's why when you go back Jesus spoke different in the was only a dozen that were following him all the other ones were mesmerized by what he was saying they couldn't understand what he was saying he spoke to them in Parables but he said unto you it has been given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom unto you it has been given to know the word for your day so that you can follow me so that you can recognize who I am he says here now watch he says in the last day when the entire Bible was to be be fulfilled in the last days a super sign a virgin shall conceive she was a super sign and this conception when it's brought forth will be God manifested in flesh a super sign they still don't believe it but it was anyhow amen it's still a super sign notice super sign they've got Superman today today they got fictions of Superman all these other kind of super things but the church has got a super sign that's what we're feasting on it's Christ he's the super sign he's the one that's annointing the word right here from this Pulpit this morning and and placing it into your heart so that you can recognize this is your day I want you to know you're the super sign you're the one that that I'm sending out there to to call the last few you're the one that that that's Anointed with the word of God in this day and in this hour to manifest me the word made flesh amen he says the and all these other kind of super things but the church has got a super sign God back in the church manifested in human flesh God United with man his sure super sign notice the Eternal sign an unfailing sign it will never fail the word and man become one let the musicians come when God's word and man become one as St John the first chapter says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that's the super sign amen oh if that was the Super sign of that day when that same spirit that was on Jesus Christ comes into his church oh come on now praise God I believe his spirit is here this morning wants to display some attributes of God wants to manifest he says when that Spirit was on Jesus Christ comes into his church to manifest the written word for today that is still the super sign amen amen amen amen amen praise God we're just about halfway through we're going to finish this next week it's only going to get better Saints prise the Lord You're Gonna you know the whole idea of being a Christian people want to talk about Christianity but let me tell you there is benefits to being a real Christian in this day and in this hour especially in the conditions that we are seeing out there right now in the world there is a true benefit to knowing who you are to knowing that you don't have to rely on your own ability you might be short this month on the rent on the mortgage payment I want you to know that if you believe this word and you just you just put aside all the doubt never mind oh you oh but you know my my paycheck was $600 and my and my mortgage payment is you know $550 how in the world am I going to pay $60 I'm going to be short 10 bucks I'm telling you right now you do whatever you got to do to pay that 60 bucks I'm not telling you that because you know tithing goes to the to the ministers and and and to support the ministry no I'm not telling you that because of that reason I'm telling you because if you really want to understand the benefit of Christianity and know that God wants to he wants you to be a super sign he wants you to be an example if you believe his word and you take it fully you take it wholeheartedly you take it I don't care what it takes I'm going to do what the word shows me to do I'm going to pay my tithes I'm GNA I'm going to attend the services I'm
