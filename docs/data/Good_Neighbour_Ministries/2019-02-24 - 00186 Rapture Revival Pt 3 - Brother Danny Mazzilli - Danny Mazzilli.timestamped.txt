[0:03] like this and final aspects of the side
[0:45] [Music]
[0:46] and you believe and you've got faith I
[0:53] preach and it's just that's because the
[0:55] gift is your gift its creators sons and
[0:59] daughters of God at this hour so that
[1:04] we're going to be looking to you along
[1:07] the same lines that we've been
[1:09] ministering here I believe there's a
[1:14] revival that's taking place right now
[1:16] within the bottom
[1:23] I've been going on that is drawing sons
[1:27] and daughters of God to the position
[1:30] amen without you beating your position
[1:34] you can't have the authority that you
[1:36] need right in order to perfect your own
[1:40] existence as a son or daughter double
[1:42] amen
[1:43] so that God can finish off the work so
[1:46] they can finish off this last scripture
[1:50] which says that we will be changed and
[1:53] it'll be in the open and in the
[1:55] twinkling of praise God praise God
[1:59] so before we do that let's go to the
[2:03] mighty angel himself invited about he's
[2:06] already here already sense his presence
[2:08] already know that uh we're going to be
[2:11] Plus this morning because whenever he
[2:13] comes he's the one that always shows up
[2:16] all these shows up amen amen
[2:20] so if you've got faith this morning
[2:22] blessed being different in Curtis
[2:24] strengthened at five
[2:27] as my desire that is his desire as
[2:31] father Lord beer again privilege you
[2:38] can't say anything else you can't say
[2:41] that we deserve to be here that we
[2:43] deserve to be blessed that we deserve
[2:46] the divine revelation that you just
[2:48] continue to pour and that you are now in
[2:51] these last days raising such a lord we
[2:55] can't help by your grace Lord continues
[3:02] to provide relief for us and here we are
[3:04] once again Lord Lord we're assembled
[3:07] under your great spirit and your the
[3:10] great revelation of this our work at the
[3:13] pub lord I go right now there's there's
[3:16] the all the saints from the backstages
[3:19] Lord they're all they capped above
[3:21] because they know that every time that
[3:24] you assemble in you you take your place
[3:26] in the body of Christ you begin to
[3:29] minister Lord they start to get excited
[3:32] father because they with us they they
[3:36] see our partly see that we have to
[3:38] fulfill they see them we need to be
[3:40] perfected and sober where you can't
[3:43] about by a cloud of witnesses this
[3:45] morning Gordon we know that we are going
[3:47] to be blessed and because they come to
[3:49] meet with you Father
[3:51] and so they you take divine controller
[3:53] I'm gonna be prepared
[3:56] I put this morning part but I know
[4:33] disorder Jesus is going to continue on
[4:53] the first version this description that
[4:55] we've been reading because this is where
[4:57] we are word were here according as he
[4:59] hath chosen us in him before the
[5:02] foundation of the world that we should
[5:05] be wholly without blame before him in
[5:08] love having predestinated us unto the
[5:12] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[5:16] himself there's no other God he's doing
[5:21] this this whole plan this whole plan of
[5:24] redemption
[5:25] it's not to a farmer that's it happened
[5:27] and a son that's sitting as I had
[5:30] another Holy Ghost that's the power of
[5:33] God it's to yourself and it's one God
[5:36] the Virgin over God he is one and that
[5:40] set period and he's doing this for his
[5:43] glory for his purpose and they're being
[5:48] drawn out to be confused do we worship
[5:52] do we know for being drawn to him pretty
[5:56] Scott to him to himself according to
[5:59] what the good pleasure of all of their
[6:04] lives don't dismiss you may be seated
[6:12] but to the church for the current sense
[6:14] and this is and this is the key this is
[6:16] the element that that were feasting on
[6:19] right now because God is giving a
[6:21] preparation for a perfect body change
[6:24] that's going to translate us out of this
[6:26] country into another dimension it's just
[6:29] that simple the rapture is you moving
[6:31] from this vibrant
[6:34] temporarily for three and a half years
[6:36] and then you're going to return back
[6:38] here to this earth to rule and reign
[6:41] with the Lord Jesus Christ for 1,000
[6:44] years
[6:45] okay then because he's going to prove to
[6:47] the world that in 6,000 years all he
[6:50] could do was mess things up even he gave
[6:53] every country on the opportunity to rule
[6:55] integration and to have power and to
[6:58] meet over the earth to have the
[7:00] strongest armies and everything else
[7:02] what they could do it they could they
[7:04] couldn't do what God said he was going
[7:07] to do which was to bring back his
[7:09] kingdom and so he's gonna believe in one
[7:11] past few years you know you know Tyga's
[7:14] this is not enough into God we know that
[7:16] time is cutted of them okay so a
[7:19] thousand years where we talk about a
[7:20] thousand years and only pertains to this
[7:22] dimension and that's why we will come
[7:24] here to this dimension we will not be in
[7:28] time bodies like you see my god you will
[7:31] not be in the time body they have that
[7:33] older
[7:43] [Music]
[7:53] [Music]
[8:14] 6,000 years to mess things up
[8:17] he's been around a long time he's been
[8:19] messing up our generations messing up
[8:21] her grandparents inner Redbirds
[8:24] putting all kinds of spirits of demons
[8:39] [Music]

[10:31] chapter to 2104 you from the amplified
[10:38] version because I love this person in
[10:42] 221 it says in here the whole structure
[10:49] is joined
[10:53] welded together harmoniously and it
[10:58] continues to rise grow increase into a
[11:04] holy temple the Lord a sanctuary
[11:07] dedicated consecrated and sacred to the
[11:12] presence of the Lord that's what that
[11:16] says we're all perfectly it God doesn't
[11:23] make mistakes
[11:31] [Music]
[11:54] but he chose you because he knew you
[11:58] were always a deposit and report
[12:06] yourself in imported what you invest we
[12:12] according to into this dimension you
[12:14] wanted to a baby and everything else and
[12:16] you a season of total spiritual amnesia

[12:24] certain parents here Moulton shaped
[12:26] under certain environments and certain
[12:28] countries and certain elements
[12:30] controlling your life but then something
[12:33] awakens you something is revealed to you
[12:37] at a certain time that season you can't
[12:40] understand it but you respond to it
[12:42] because not placed in there that was
[12:51] deeply placed within your being

[13:40] [Music]
[13:46] your time of the season get into the
[13:49] house of the Lord

[13:53] going to hurt you guys too
[13:57] right it's not your work may be bad this
[14:02] is God's work this is about this is you
[14:08] don't listen listen I'm a bot just like
[14:11] you believe your own body well-priced he
[14:13] is the head of the body
[14:16] he's the one that came down in 1963 when
[14:19] the mighty angel came down and that
[14:21] cloud appeared over sunset Mountain it
[14:24] was the intelligence it was the mighty
[14:26] to stuff himself coming down to take a
[14:30] pride to take a body he says don't be a
[14:38] power come into the church and now it's
[14:41] coming and that the Holy Spirit will
[14:43] ignore the people to speak word and it
[14:46] will create itself like that Luna we
[14:49] have a seat power that's coming into the
[14:52] church amen
[14:54] that's coming into the church blessed be
[14:57] the name of the world all right together
[15:00] what the church begins to get into the
[15:05] church now I know it it's coming now
[15:12] it's now here he's now taking this
[15:15] number is control and he's without
[15:18] effective that's looking at today we're
[15:21] gonna be looking at put the next slide
[15:26] amen and these messages these messages
[15:31] has been hidden now now remember the
[15:35] foundation
[15:37] the manifestations of the sons of God to
[15:42] display them to the church
[15:44] Oh hide again what the church begins to
[15:48] get to get it amen
[15:51] praise God so now as you think point
[15:56] we've been moving along here this is
[15:59] brother Branham he came he left the
[16:02] scene in 1965 were already fifty-four
[16:07] years ahead of that we've got way beyond
[16:12] his time in the season so there's been a
[16:15] progression that's been going on and
[16:17] there's been this were doubtless that
[16:19] was that was brought for it rest into
[16:23] the restoration to front of Records
[16:26] ministry required that the mighty will
[16:28] come down himself now reveal the
[16:32] mysteries right what are the mystery
[16:35] stuff without written under that bottom
[16:37] seal it was the names of the sons and
[16:41] daughters out there to try to figure out
[16:44] the book of Revelation forget you
[16:49] [Music]
[16:52] vindicated
[16:55] [Music]
[16:59] because the ministries we get in here
[17:44] now dot says one to the Pentecostal age
[17:48] a messenger in the twentieth century to
[17:51] restore the Word of God because there
[17:54] was all confusion in all of those
[17:56] churches how do you know which way to go
[17:58] - captain church it lots of baptize the
[18:00] baby or the Baptist Church you know
[18:02] baptize babies he go to this church
[18:04] although they baptized the titles of the
[18:06] father son for this church
[18:17] [Music]
[18:28] [Music]
[18:40] william branham
[18:42] we recognize the relish peas our profit
[18:46] but we do not follow every word follow
[18:51] everything we have like can we talk by
[18:55] him we can open up exactly what he
[18:58] thought no it's beyond that how do you
[19:01] say the right angel can cut down that do
[19:04] his own part to the Michael
[19:29] [Music]
[19:35] you cannot be changed I just you cannot
[19:41] be changed but you sitting and listening
[19:43] to the tapes they trap you like black
[19:48] chicken to do not get a conversation
[19:52] with a certain low because they speak a
[19:56] different language they speak the
[19:58] supernatural language they speak my
[20:00] revelation they have a different key
[20:06] inside them that can only receive
[20:09] revelation they can take an
[20:10] interpretation they can't take baths
[20:13] please and applause and this way you're
[20:19] gonna do - oh God
[20:28] I will perform his spirit through the
[20:38] body angel come down to 1963
[20:41] brotherbrother just feet down the seat
[20:44] by 1965 and here comes the mighty to
[20:47] himself to control now of a five-fold a
[20:51] man to build a super church to restore
[20:55] ii back to her position again authority
[21:00] where she will know what to do will not
[21:04] be a puppet tool that you will be able
[21:06] to rock that will be under the control
[21:09] of the holy spirit any dictators any any
[21:14] uh you know superstar preachers and
[21:17] they've been the message longer than you
[21:29] is the one gives inspiration he's the
[21:32] one that inspires he's the one that
[21:34] starts the work he's the one this is
[21:45] [Music]
[21:52] [Music]
[21:56] and through the church positions are
[22:41] perfectly fit God gifted you in certain
[22:45] areas overall that does give to do in
[22:48] certain areas let us give you certain
[22:51] heart for ministry and certainly as
[22:54] designed you just perfectly you know
[22:58] from your childhood exactly the way that
[23:01] you need to be in order to fit in the
[23:04] body of Jesus Christ amen Gloria duck
[23:07] next slide and so all waiting for the
[23:11] manifestation of the sons of God
[23:13] hallelujah when God will make himself
[23:15] known when they'll stop
[23:18] cats with their sub diseases that's what
[23:22] we're striving before now to get and be
[23:25] positionally placed into the kingdom of
[23:27] God before these wanted to play a strike
[23:31] predestinated mystery of this was for
[23:33] the ground speed next time now the
[23:39] rapture revival and the end the end the
[23:42] end the church the time of the season
[23:45] that we're living in is right up there
[23:47] in that capsule Christ in the form of
[23:52] his bride is what is going to be in that
[24:03] because Christianity started back when
[24:07] Christ was on the earth that's why it's
[24:10] called Christianity and all through
[24:14] those dark ages in all the way up to
[24:16] today the body has been building up but
[24:21] in the last days there's going to be a
[24:24] supernatural church and that church
[24:28] you cannot just join that church you
[24:33] know join a majority good investors do
[24:37] not get because your parents or your
[24:42] grandparents were in this message and
[24:46] you were following it and all of a
[24:48] sudden you can bring upon yourself
[24:52] I get the land because he was owned by
[24:55] my parents
[24:56] that's not the way it works in this age
[25:00] you'll notice there's a gap between the
[25:04] 7th church age and the capsule in that
[25:09] capstone is where the perfect church
[25:14] gets placed for the lift up to meet in
[25:20] the air very much you can't get in their
[25:23] 40s there's a gap between the capsule
[25:30] and the ages and that guy it's a
[25:34] supernatural gap that requires the Holy
[25:37] Spirit Himself to come and pull you out
[25:41] of the church ages to come because
[25:44] everybody else is in the 7th church age
[25:47] anybody all the other churches all
[25:51] denominational churches up there are all
[25:53] the other teachings up there they come
[25:56] under the natural church ages we
[25:59] preferred that there is an eternal
[26:01] church age messenger right which is the
[26:04] mighty angel itself if there's going to
[26:07] be an eternal church right that they
[26:10] require an eternal lesson genomic first
[26:13] to be messy and that's why a lot of it
[26:15] or this be stuck here it was a rapture
[26:19] those they're gonna be tied to brother
[26:20] branham's birthday message not realizing
[26:24] that he was always pointing us to the
[26:27] right
[26:34] [Music]
[26:36] to be pointed to a church the Catholic
[26:41] Church the Presbyterian Church the two
[26:43] local ministers whatever at a Cosmo this
[26:48] is your pointing to a church natural but
[26:53] this super church this last Church age
[26:57] for the rapture takes out of that
[27:00] natural church because that's where all
[27:03] of you and I worry and that's why we
[27:05] separate we believe in the Christian
[27:16] Church of Christ in His Church that's
[27:20] what it means but we know for a fact
[27:23] that every time those churches
[27:26] denominations and so the Holy Ghost will
[27:35] just move on because he needs to come to
[27:38] this to the capstone ministry where you
[27:43] as sons and daughters of God can only be
[27:48] placed to adoption through you getting
[27:53] into your position through you and so
[28:00] whether or by I need to go to church
[28:02] I've heard others
[28:04] [Music]
[28:23] in yourself sometimes you need to be
[29:07] deleted from your perceptions and
[29:13] program generational thoughts and ideas
[29:16] and interpretations of the Word of God
[29:19] they praise you walked out and so let's
[29:26] look at the next slide
[29:34] he says it's built right out like this
[29:38] to a point and the stone of the capstone
[29:45] never was errant
[29:47] they never did put a cap on top of the
[29:50] pyramid I don't know whether you know it
[29:53] or not the big period of Egypt it never
[29:56] had a top stone on that we know that the
[30:00] Pyramid of Giza is a a period that was
[30:03] good
[30:03] we believed Enoch okay who was you know
[30:07] that walked with God you know he walked
[30:10] with God it was completely dyed so much
[30:13] that he knew so much about the plan of
[30:15] redemption not at the table but he dug
[30:19] this pyramid it is perfectly you know
[30:21] exactly the whole cycle of the church
[30:25] and of the world and everything in it to
[30:28] this day
[30:29] science is busy killing they can't
[30:31] explain they come up with all kinds of
[30:34] interpretations all of those super
[30:36] beings that came down from heaven that
[30:39] you know that they were not killed
[30:42] Giants in Atlanta they were there were
[30:44] sons of God and they were
[30:46] to all these cities that's pretty close
[30:49] but the antibody just right because they
[30:52] don't understand the final redemption it
[30:55] would realize what God was doing when he
[30:56] placed that the period of Deeds on which
[30:59] is perfectly placed in the center of the
[31:01] earth exactly perfect because this is
[31:12] the mighty God himself on the shore so
[31:15] and so here huh it never had a top on it
[31:18] why the tax law was rejected because
[31:21] Christ is the capsule and Christ the
[31:24] capsule came down in 1963 when he
[31:28] kidnapped beaten up with earthly angel
[31:31] to save time shall be no we're moving
[31:35] down from this earthly church age into
[31:39] an eternal church age and so he came
[31:46] down the head Jesus a lot of looking for
[31:50] this you know the second coming of the
[31:52] arm that he's gonna come in the clouds
[31:54] already
[32:00] [Music]
[32:05] [Music]
[32:08] and so here now he says the cap slope
[32:12] was rejected and they rejected this
[32:14] revelation they rejected it easy you can
[32:18] look you can see it on the internet you
[32:19] have to punch it will you brother seven
[32:23] angels sunset Popular's there's all
[32:27] kinds of videos on there good because
[32:32] they got a reject the word in order for
[32:36] the word to be a member when Christ came
[32:40] he came to his own so that you could
[32:45] take you a Gentile ready man be paid for
[32:49] this all the Jews but they rejected him
[32:52] they will have their day it's not too
[32:55] far it's just around the water say
[32:58] they're going to be awakened to the same
[33:01] Lord Jesus that you were linked to very
[33:03] many because the word has to be
[33:06] fulfilled and every type possibly will
[33:08] help and that's why we could get into so
[33:10] many types in the Old Testament with
[33:12] Joseph Joseph wasn't you and you have
[33:16] that he took the top prize
[33:19] perfect type of Jesus Christ and don't
[33:21] come down about throwing the dungeon
[33:23] that he not raised up the Pharaohs right
[33:26] hand reduces right hand man it's just
[33:29] perfect types of Christ amen okay I
[33:33] recognize this but you do because you've
[33:35] got revelation of the work and so now
[33:39] but as we grow from the Luther Age the
[33:43] Baptist age the Methodist age the
[33:46] Pentecostal age of discontinuing this
[33:48] booklet your right up to the captain
[33:52] stone now see for the captain stone to
[33:59] set down the building's complete so he
[34:06] is now in the process of completing this
[34:11] church I'm not ready the scripture the
[34:15] spoke was rejected partially realized
[34:18] that was talking to the Solomon's Temple
[34:20] but the rejected stone has become the
[34:23] chief the chief of the quarter but I've
[34:29] seen this movie to make a picture to you
[34:31] now in the Bible we're living in the
[34:33] last days the top of the pyramid the
[34:38] cross fishes of the cancer age in the
[34:41] zodiac because God's fire was first
[34:44] printed in Evans and this time telling
[34:46] you about scientists speaking about all
[34:49] of this all of the who had the agent
[34:53] feel the lion and
[34:55] September the woman and the dragon and
[34:58] the baby and repeated you know this is
[35:01] all taking place but they don't know how
[35:04] to interpret it because they don't have
[35:06] a revelation of what God is doing in
[35:08] this thing and so the zodiac in the time
[35:13] of the coming of the legal ayat in the
[35:15] captain stone and in the days of the
[35:19] manifestation of the sons of God in the
[35:22] Bible so this is the season of RIT
[35:26] we're indices who were the sons and
[35:29] daughters of God manifest and they got
[35:32] to come into their positions and they've
[35:34] got to be protected we're right at the
[35:38] end time see where we're at he says Amen
[35:42] so here we are now we are at that point
[35:48] where God is now perfecting the church
[35:52] and we need to recognize this and
[35:55] recognize that being a forehead and what
[35:58] part of the scripture that's now being
[36:01] fulfilled one of the vents a historical
[36:05] nature like never before taking place
[36:07] right now there are things happening in
[36:11] the world in the governments in the in
[36:13] the politics in the in the land systems
[36:16] there's this bit because the earth is in
[36:19] Earth pays off because the sons of God
[36:23] are coming into manifestation a man
[36:27] talk about you live in to the daughters
[36:30] of coffee and cuz we've never given in
[36:32] the beginning God created Adam and he he
[36:37] created them male and female and called
[36:40] their name so so you has a son or a
[36:46] daughter god they're equal in God's
[36:49] economy man here we have positions here
[36:53] we have to save our positions the way
[36:56] that the word has decided for us so that
[36:59] we can get properly regulated by the
[37:01] Word of God and position properly
[37:03] because we get a woman out of position
[37:06] she can't property coming to wrap
[37:10] through today through the word up and if
[37:14] you're an attribute of God you cannot be
[37:17] disposition probably so everything is
[37:23] coming together
[37:24] he's not my mother for five the the
[37:27] church age messenger that needed to come
[37:30] up out of all the mess we received our
[37:33] malachite call we've been in this for
[37:39] many years now here we are we're
[37:43] reaching that point where at any time
[37:47] we call home hallelujah you know so we
[37:51] had a beautiful weekend with the
[37:53] leadership and we got into some
[37:57] wonderful plots because whatever the
[38:00] boss that was brought was about true
[38:04] servant leadership as sons and daughters
[38:08] of God and I want to tell you each and
[38:11] every one of you you heard about Sunday
[38:13] you weren't ministers every one of you
[38:16] is a minister you missed her up to the
[38:19] Lord
[38:19] mr. to one of them when you come into
[38:22] this body and you would have been
[38:25] brought into the body of the price to be
[38:28] bonded in love you see the great thing
[38:32] about the capstone of were looking at
[38:34] brother Brennan he entered into that by
[38:37] virtue what did that capsule is is in
[38:42] that eternal place and he said perfect
[38:47] love could enter into that place and so
[38:51] you now ask sons and daughters of God
[38:54] coming into the church do big okay I'm
[38:57] gonna join a church first of all you
[39:00] don't join the church God adds to the
[39:03] church so if God adds to the church and
[39:07] you're being led by God that guess what
[39:10] God's going to do he's going to bond you
[39:12] to the ministry he's going to bond you
[39:16] to the body of Christ you know that it's
[39:19] God because if you can't escape you come
[39:21] to this church with an attitude and you
[39:24] want to stick with that attitude you
[39:39] [Music]
[40:09] it changes your nature and you start to
[40:25] exhibit God's characteristics his
[40:30] attitudes his ways of working in the
[40:34] body of the Christ so one of the
[40:36] thoughts was that you have run into the
[40:40] leadership and you you have been brought
[40:43] into this body here his church gods
[40:47] would argue with the body and with a
[40:52] woman into a certain place in their walk
[40:56] where they're walking together they can
[41:00] start updating but then once they start
[41:02] to get a little bit more where they want
[41:04] to go a little more intimate and they've
[41:06] got to move into the stage of marriage
[41:08] and that's God
[41:26] you can and you're stubborn it's because
[41:52] you're not really bonded to this church
[41:54] it's because you cannot but you get to
[41:57] the place or you're ready to enter into
[41:59] a marriage because when you belong to a
[42:03] church and you support your password you
[42:06] are actually a marriage commitment in
[42:09] time for Christ in the church it all
[42:13] perfectly taxing you become three
[42:20] [Music]
[42:22] [Applause]
[42:27] in this age not a message this is the
[42:31] time for these holy days perfecting you
[42:34] he's starting to take out all that stuff
[42:37] you are receiving the Word of God and
[42:40] the Word of God and because that's what
[42:50] happens you start to read those things
[42:53] because of the revelation
[42:57] [Music]
[43:10] [Music]
[43:27] [Music]
[43:44] [Music]
[43:55] this is your subject to the hoarded up
[44:24] talking about violence
[44:29] [Music]
[44:33] we search around because
