[29:28] Earth full
[29:31] stop and the Earth was
[29:35] without without form and void and
[29:39] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[29:43] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[29:45] face of the
[29:47] waters and God
[29:49] said that was the F the first the first
[29:53] creation and the second and God said let
[29:58] there be light and there was light and
[30:01] God saw the light that it was good and
[30:05] God divided the light from darkness and
[30:09] God called day light day and the
[30:13] Darkness he called night and the
[30:17] evening and the morning were the first
[30:21] day may the Lord add his Blessing for
[30:24] the reading of his word you may be

[30:29] Hallelujah I saw the light and I believe
[30:32] you saw the light
[30:37] Hallelujah the Bible said God created
[30:40] heaven and earth
[30:41] period that's where the people don't
[30:43] know how many years and it can be
[30:45] billions of years but that one is
[30:48] belongs to God now we are we are going
[30:51] to talk about light Hallelujah why God
[30:55] created light
[31:02] [Music]
[31:04] Hallelujah we are going to talk about
[31:07] light somebody will say why brother
[31:11] Desmond is talking about
[31:14] light light is very very
[31:18] important in human life
[31:22] Supernatural and
[31:24] natural
[31:26] living
[31:28] Supernatural and natural
[31:31] living without light no one can live on
[31:34] this Earth here God in the beginning God
[31:38] knew what he was
[31:41] doing
[31:44] Hallelujah God refer himself as
[31:51] light there are so many significant
[31:55] things we can talk about life
[31:58] first of all there are four things that
[32:02] I going to express
[32:10] tonight
[32:12] light
[32:14] work with
[32:17] life light work with
[32:22] life at the same
[32:26] time
[32:28] Darkness Darkness work with
[32:33] death right Darkness walk with death
[32:39] Light walk with life
[32:45] Hallelujah God call himself
[32:49] light the Lord Jesus said I am the light
[32:53] of the
[32:55] world so do you know that you are the
[32:59] light of this world
[33:03] Hallelujah without light no one can
[33:07] leave it doesn't matter whether you Pope
[33:10] or
[33:12] whatever overse the Seer whatever it is
[33:16] that's where it is you cannot change it
[33:20] Hallelujah so the light is very very
[33:23] important to our
[33:25] life if in the in the natural human life
[33:29] we cannot live without light
[33:33] Hallelujah daylight and daylight and
[33:36] Supernatural Al
[33:38] Supernatural supernaturally also the
[33:41] light that is in and also the light that
[33:46] is in you that leads you the light that
[33:50] in you that leads you physically also
[33:54] there's a light that is in your your
[33:58] body as you sitting down there there's a
[34:01] light that is in you aeal light that is
[34:06] in you that makes your heart work your
[34:09] whole organ Works yes without that light
[34:14] you cannot
[34:15] live
[34:17] Hallelujah God is so good he is so
[34:21] perfect
[34:23] Hallelujah I am glad that I'm associate
[34:26] with with him amen glory to
[34:30] God
[34:32] Amen thank you
[34:34] Lord the food that we
[34:37] eat also grow with light without light
[34:42] nothing can
[34:44] grow
[34:46] Hallelujah without light nothing can
[34:49] grow in this earth here that's
[34:54] right life consist with
[34:57] life consist with
[35:02] light for instance I tell you he said
[35:06] why Apostle Paul was killing Christians
[35:09] you ask
[35:10] yourself why he was killing Christians
[35:12] Apostle
[35:14] Paul this
[35:16] man he has a seed inside of
[35:20] him but that seed was covered with thick
[35:25] Darkness
[35:28] that there is no moisture that can bring
[35:31] forth that seed
[35:34] out you know what I call that
[35:37] moisture is witnessing when you
[35:41] expressing the word of God to somebody
[35:44] you moisture the the the Earth the
[35:48] ground that where the seed is inside it
[35:51] so when that thing is Mo and the sun
[35:54] heat that that that that what he grows
[35:58] so it's very very important for
[36:01] everybody to witness to
[36:04] everybody you don't know where the seed
[36:07] is inside
[36:10] there Paul knew the word of God he think
[36:15] he was doing God a
[36:20] service but without his
[36:24] will Paul
[36:28] Paul the so the seed that was in Paul
[36:32] was covered with a very thick dark dark
[36:37] dark Death
[36:39] gray that nothing can penetrate inside
[36:43] there
[36:45] so one
[36:48] day God said the only way I can do to
[36:53] bring this seed out
[36:58] he has to crack that ground and and let
[37:03] the light penetrate through that ground
[37:06] where the seed is amen so when he was
[37:11] going to do his work you know Paul was
[37:16] serious about
[37:18] God but he was doing by himself without
[37:23] that light without light that light you
[37:26] cannot do nothing you just
[37:30] walking without

[1:16:42] grow if you plant something you get you
[1:16:45] don't get enough light you can never get
[1:16:49] fruits that you want going to get a
[1:16:52] little bit here a little bit here and
[1:16:54] sometime it it can be just grown up like
[1:16:57] that but it's no fruit that's right you
[1:17:00] need the sunl light the nature C for the
[1:17:04] light what about

[1:17:20] can't see nothing you hit your you hit
[1:17:22] your shield with with a a chair then
[1:17:24] after you start going like this if the
[1:17:26] light is there you w't go like this you
[1:17:29] understand it happened to you several
[1:17:30] time sometime you get up you don't know
[1:17:33] there's a light no light there you boom
[1:17:37] then you started blaming your wife why
[1:17:38] you put this see
[1:17:41] here

[1:17:48] not it's not your wife God there's no
[1:17:50] light there Hallelujah huah that shows
[1:17:54] you light is very very important in the
[1:17:58] human life glory to
[1:18:01] God
[1:18:03] Amen I am happy that God has given us
[1:18:08] the great light in this hour and this
[1:18:12] light is the light that is shining upon
[1:18:15] Earth through the message of William
[1:18:19] maram
[1:18:20] Braham Hallelujah
[1:18:23] this light is a special light not for
[1:18:27] everybody it's a special light for
[1:18:30] people whom God has
[1:18:32] designated for this
[1:18:35] light
[1:18:36] Hallelujah I read a little thing here
[1:18:39] for you to hear
[1:18:41] there there is a man here that can turn
[1:18:43] on the
[1:18:44] light say nothing natural nothing
[1:18:48] natural or spiritual can live without
[1:18:51] God light this is that's a paragraph 83
[1:18:55] there's a man here that can turn on the
[1:18:57] light he said nothing
[1:19:00] natural nothing natural or spiritual can
[1:19:04] live without God's
[1:19:08] light life can only come then by
[1:19:15] light nothing natural or
[1:19:19] nothing spiritual can live without God's
[1:19:22] life
[1:19:24] think of that all right but when he sent
[1:19:28] us the light see and that and does all
[1:19:33] these things and when and then we
[1:19:37] rejected
[1:19:39] it now that's the pitiful part is when
[1:19:44] the light is
[1:19:45] rejected when is sent to us praise the
[1:19:51] Lord
[1:19:54] anybody rejected the light of this world
[1:19:59] the word of God you are
[1:20:02] doomed to
[1:20:05] death cuz only this light the light of
[1:20:09] God you can receive
[1:20:12] Life Light and life work together
[1:20:17] darkness and death work together
[1:20:20] remember two people on the cross
[1:20:24] one with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:20:26] went and the other one with Judas they
[1:20:31] went cuz where two in the darkness and
[1:20:35] two in the
[1:20:37] light so these two works
[1:20:40] together God created this light why he
[1:20:44] created the light
[1:20:46] first because with that light anything
[1:20:49] that he has created will never live
[1:20:53] there will be no life in
[1:20:56] it so God light is the only one that is
[1:21:00] shining in this
[1:21:02] hour amen the light of God praise the
[1:21:06] Lord I think this is I can I can I can
