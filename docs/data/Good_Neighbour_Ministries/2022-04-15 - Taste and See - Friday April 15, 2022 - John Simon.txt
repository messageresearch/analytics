may the lord bless you we welcome back the curry family visiting again we thank you god bless you all and we welcome every one of you into the house of god amen uh now this service is going to be brief and to the point um i'm just going to bring a little talk here after which we will have the lord's supper and we're not going to uh be milling around in the parking lot but we're going to leave because we will be back on sunday right praise god you don't want me to unload everything here now and then say well no service on sunday because i've already preached myself out so i'll just give you a taste praise the lord shall we turn in our bibles a funny sir a funny scripture to preach uh communion service a good friday service from but psalms 34 verse 8. oh taste and see that the lord is good blessed is the man that trusted in him let's read that again oh taste and see that the lord is good blessed is the man that trusted in him heavenly father on this good friday we come together as one in christ with excitement with joy and with the great privilege of your divine presence here among us we thank you father that our faith our understanding of the word attracts your attention and brings you on the scene you come on the scene because you see something in us a deposit that was made there beyond the realms of time and now father we see the life of christ making itself manifest in this hour take all the glory and the praise in the name of our lord jesus amen god bless you please be seated praise god oh taste and see that the lord is good supernatural taste you can't even taste this bread or this word you can't taste it the way it should be tasted unless you have a revelation of it you may read it you may on you may read your bible you may listen to it it may even taste reasonably good to you but the bible says in proverbs that it's like honey in a honeycomb and so taste and see if you have that ability to taste taste and see that the lord is good i want you to notice i'm talking just on the scripture now uh it says taste and after you taste and you appreciate it then you will begin to be able to see test and see that the lord is good isn't that wonderful i came into this wonderful faith and i began to taste little morsels here and there little pieces here and there and it all was just enjoyable and wonderful all the peppermint all the lollipops all the you know cakes they cross onesie whatever chased them they were really good praise the lord god bless you all i i'm pausing in the middle of this because i want to thank god i thought about you and i was thinking about you when i'm leaving home and here you are so you're in the will of god and we thank god for that praise the name of the lord we all in the will of god but i'm just telling you specifically i thought about them and here they are in the house of the lord praise the lord god bless you real good amen taste and see so you see so what this is i want you to see that the lord's supper uh is a supernatural meal because you may eat the emblems drink the emblems without a clear full understanding and the effects that it should have in your life would really take place like they should because you don't uh have a clear understanding as you know some take it by tradition others take it because the father the grandfather and so on took it before them but we are here my friends not for uh you know let me go back tradition i remember being when i was young uh good fridays is famous for a little bit of rain falling and sometimes thunderstorms and the people would come out and say oh god is crying for his son because the streets are filled with water it's the tears of god coming down upon us you see my friends but we are not here to mourn on good friday when he went to the cross we are not here to to cry that jesus went to the cross we are not here to emphasize uh the sufferings of jesus christ we are here my friends for a celebration of that life that he lived and that he imparted unto us that we can give that glory unto his great name hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord oh thank god not only is it a supernatural meal but i want you to know it's a holy meal it's bread like any other bread but yes this is different it's wine the same wine that the sinners may drink out there but yet this is different because when you eat this bread you eat it with a revelation when you drink this wine you drink it with a revelation a full understanding that as that liquid courses down into your being you are saying lord as i receive this and i accept this in my body may your spirit come into my life may your blood purify my blood may your life empower my life oh praise god may the resurrection spirit that is in you come upon me and raise me up to that land where i belong praise god hallelujah amen praise god so we're glad that we come to this great meal in the presence of god which is really the center of our faith it's the central point because he says remember this always and do it as often as you can so that it will never leave your thoughts so keep it at the center of your faith or of your revelation of of how he became the central point and focus and culmination of all of the subs all of this symbols and types and shadows of the old testament are all fulfilled in him praise god and he's saying you you remember that every one of those things from the priests of the garments of the priest the the temple the the things in the temple even the curtains in the temple was him everything about that was him and when we come right to the end we must remember it's all about him praise god forevermore so he is the center of our faith he is the wheel in the middle of the wheel praise god hallelujah but not only is he the center of our faith my friends he is the circle of our faith and that circle is the circle of fellowship that we are involved hallelujah the sackle of our fellowship with fellow believers regardless of your preferences and i mean one may love coffee one don't want coffee your next one wants only tea and one just don't want ordinary i only drink peppermint and salt regardless of your preferences hallelujah paul's as paul was saying all this stuff we've been delivered from worrying about new moon and full moon and worrying about days and weeks and and legalistic about lesser about that amen praise god our face rests upon the word of god we are not moved by the things on the outside of us we are called to live our individual personal lives within the confines of god's word hallelujah the way you live it may be different from me as long as you have the same faith same revelation same god same christ same baptism same spirit then god will always honor that blessed be his name hallelujah god don't care about your personal preference hallelujah god doesn't care about such things brother doesn't care about how you worship in the sense of one may shout and one may quietly uh worship god and one may scream it one may dance one might just reach out within their heart hallelujah amen god is not so much interested in that whatsoever he is not interested in your class he has nothing not interested in our racial distinctions god is not interested in such a thing amen because like the badger skins in the temple he just put the priests behind there those skins to carry out their mission behind the veil and so are we to call to carry out our mission here upon this earth behind the veil your veil will be back your skin gold skin sheep skin the colors might be different but it's god in your skin god behind your skin god manifesting his word and declaring himself blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah amen so the lord supper is the center also of time a b c and a d he is right in the middle of it hallelujah he is the center and circle of our fellowship and we give him glory for him many years ago a little boy went with his grandmother to the lord's supper and this happened to be on a christmas eve and there wasn't too many people in the church and it was very very quiet indeed uh within the church amen and uh the grandmother took the lord's supper and as she was coming back out of our seat the little the little boy could not hold back his excitement you know he said where my grandma how did it taste how did it taste and he forgot he was in church so he was shouting loud and everybody turned around how did it taste well i want to ask you tonight how does it taste to you when you took the word of god the revelation by this prophet how does it taste to you amen i say chase and she the lord is good blessed is the man of the woman that put their faith in him blessed be that young person that trusts in him regardless of who you are and where you are taste and see that the lord is good blessed is the one that trusts in him and put their faith in him praise god hallelujah that little boy might have been irreverent in church but when you think of it friends the question or the question he asked is not irrelevant it has much meaning to every single one of us here today how does christ the revealed world taste to you [Laughter] thank you brother amen praise god he tastes good like i said solomon says oh sweeter than a honeycomb oh honey in the rock my brother honey and the rock amen blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah do you sense the taste or the atmosphere that's the taste of jesus christ in this place here tonight is there a certain atmosphere that dominates and controls this church that you can taste when you walk in these doors you can taste the presence of the living god oh may the spirit of almighty god speak to your heart tonight to recognize his presence his power and his grace amen oh hallelujah amen praise god forevermore praise god yes sir when we do that it's a time when our fellowship like this is a an enriching time it's a wonderful time it's a touching time praise god you know i was thinking about this all a day and i just praise the the great holy spirit of the living god thank him for his word thank him for his presence and that he is the same yesterday today and forever amen william branham is dead but the spirit lives thanks be to god the holy ghost is still alive and here with us amen praise god we must rest upon that and that alone hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord jesus christ so when you take the lord's supper do you taste christ sister sheila oh praise god good to see you may the holy spirit cause every one of us to sense the taste uh with the spiritual senses that you might taste jesus christ and know that he is here indeed with us praise god hallelujah amen because now is not head time this is body time is that right let me tell you that our headship has come but he has come to enable his body to manifest so it's not head time it's body time it's the bride's time hallelujah it's the hour of the true uh wife of christ making herself known hallelujah that she is she belongs to him hallelujah he is our headship praise god hallelujah she walks with him she talks with him she fellowships with him it's her best friend hallelujah lord of god that's the way we are with jesus christ if we are true believers body of christ that's what we are we are the body of jesus christ hallelujah amen praise god i don't know about you but brother when i go into the bible when i go into the books when i listen to the tapes when i come like this in the presence of god and begin to preach the word and the holy spirit comes i i just i'm partaking of a delicious taste of the word of god upon my plate and i thank god for it hallelujah amen praise god you can't taste for me you've got a taste for yourself every man got a taste for himself you might have the same dish and everybody in here might eat it but every person got their individual taste of that dish hallelujah praise god we may all say oh it's good but yes but one may say it's good because it's got a little bit of tang tanginess another woman say oh it's good it's got a little spiciness now it was oh it's really good it's got a little bit of sugar sweetness and so on but the main thing is we recognize taste and see that the lord is good and blessed is the one that trusted in him hallelujah praise god hallelujah well you know this is not something started by any uh denomination this this celebration of the lord's supper was instituted and started by the lord jesus christ uh himself amen and every week since then because we know after he left the scene the apostles started right away as often they kept it praise the lord whether it's in a house or in a cave or in a whatever like that they kept the lord supper and it was not a tradition of anything like that my friends but they kept it and somewhere somebody kept on keeping the lord's supper until this time where we are and we will continue to take it until our lord personally comes again and takes us out of here praise the name of the lord amen and until that time may we sing with understanding will the circle be unbroken will any of us leave before that time oh but the true believer knows that once their soul is a part of god elected by him eternal as he is eternal in the heavens oh absent from the body present with the lord absent from this body into ethiopia prepared for you before the foundations of the world and we long to leave this old prison house that we might enter in to our next dimension of life that we might enter in to this supernatural body prepared for us before the foundation of the world praise peter god hallelujah amen will the circle be unbroken by and by yes by and by but if you go first and i remain don't you worry about the thing because i'm coming you might have been you you might have been taking before me but i'm coming praise god because i have his assurance i have his promise i have his life within me which can not cannot be conquered by death hallelujah oh praise god brother sister trust him and believe him and i thank god as luke 22 19 said we read he took bread gave thanks broke it and gave it to them saying this is my body given for you do this in remembrance of me and in the same manner he took the cup saying this cup is the new covenant in my blood which is poured out for you but the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table the son of man will go as it has been decreed but woe to the man who betrays him amen my friends i want you to know that with a man standing in the gap a new world began with the with jesus dying on the cross with him hanging on the cross there it was the beginning of a new world it was uh the beginning you'll understand it better if i say this it's a it was the beginning of a new creation my father were kidding too and now i work is that right amen that's why paul said we are a new creation we are not just of the all creation but but but we are of the new creation amen because we've been created from within men and women created by the holy spirit amen glory be to god we thank god for that and i want to give god the glory amen that this new world that has begun i'm glad that it has begun because it's not a new world of legalistic laws and rules but it's a law of it's a world of freedom and liberty not lawlessness but grace it's a world of grace praise god hallelujah and it's a world in which a grace just happens amen you just walk about you just live your life and grace just takes place you just walk you just talk you just live you just enjoy the grace of god and grace just happens all around you you don't have to do anything about it because it happens around you amen don't you understand you've conquered death what is sickness you you are conquerors of sickness blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah if the spirit in you conquer death what a sickness only believe all things are possible to them that will believe the word of god o praise god hallelujah amen i say it but you must believe it amen praise god hallelujah so i thank god forevermore for this marvelous wonderful grace that is around us and in us and through us that we are free praise god free when i say free not with wildness not with lawlessness not with any nonsense such as that but we know our liberty is within the boundless confines of the word of god which is eternal amen amen there is no end so you got real true freedom not legalistic laws and rules we live by them now we walk in them now because we are down here we are here in the middle of it all so we walk within the systems and rules regulations and laws that are here and we're commanded to obey the higher powers amen as much as we can but when it comes to them obey children obey your appearance in the lord when it comes to that knit taking away the lord or take try to command you to get away from the that's another matter and then every believer will have to make their own decision praise god hallelujah amen hallelujah thank god that somewhere we are not the only ones taking the lord's supper tonight because you know there are millions maybe around the world taking it and many are taking it by tradition but we thank god there were still a fateful few that are taking it by our revelation praise the name of the living god hallelujah amen and we want to remember those who are not here tonight among us right in this building with our own people gathered with us around the world the world because of sickness or because of circumstances because of age because of the different conditions in the world around us we are sorry they're not here but let us remember them remember jesus is that right but remember jesus is not just a head he's a body so remember those of his body that are not here tonight praise the lord your brothers and sisters wherever you are whoever you are we remember you tonight and may the grace of god be upon you and may you be made whole in the name of our lord jesus christ and while you're doing that don't forget remember those who are right in here taking the supper along with you remember those are the next to you behind you in front of you praise god dearly within your heart remember in christ we are truly one amen i and my father are one you and your father are one and together we are still all one amen adam stood in the garden alone and god tells him about his wife and then god takes her from his side and the two of them standing there you go in the book of genesis and he said and he still called their name their name adam right the name adam praise god hallelujah amen yes sir so my friends we want to be in touch and to remember all those uh like that praise god amen uh i've said before that this is a celebration and the celebration is that we have found the pearl of great price hallelujah we have we are here to celebrate his life which is the pearl that we have found he allowed us to find him oh praise god and that is why we are here to celebrate this wonderful life that we have found praise god and i'm thankful for this wonderful life that was given to us free we did not have to pay we didn't have to do anything then it will mean that the rich and the powerful would have some advantage in religion uh is that right but no there's no partiality with god amen there is no levels of of of how you come in with god amen how he places you that's another matter but god doesn't look at how you come in you can't pay your way and by your way and pray away and uh you say your way and sing your way in holier than doubt your weigh-in or nothing of that kind you just got to rest on his unchanging grace rest on his unchanging grace amen praise god it's a celebration john 3 16. if you know it they say it i'll read it here for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life praise god he who is life you know you you know you don't want to consider that but just give you what i'm talking about this is where the buddhists and allah these religions go off god is all life i don't care if you see a bug on the ground there that's god's life moving in that bone to be a bug anything that has life god gave it life it has its reason for being here amen whatever reason god knows i may not know but he knows and he puts whatever has life down here to be here like that amen praise god so my friends thank god that we can celebrate this lord's supper and that by celebrating the lord's supper of course we are celebrating our salvation and our redemption too because remember this redemption has given every one of us a new beginning is that right it has given us a new beginning and i'm glad to have a new beginning out of this wonderful new life that he has given to us so this is not a funeral this is not where we all come to church wearing black clothes or wearing black veils and all kinds of stuff and seeing who can out cry or out mourn the rest of the people in the church this is we haven't come together to get little weapons and little things to flagellate ourselves you know of lashing our bodies and blood bleeding and everything else because you're suffering for the lord no he said i suffered that you may not i live without a house that you might have a house i became poor that you might become rich is that right he did all that because of us but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of his peace was upon us and by his traps we are healed oh peace god be healed if you believe the word of god right now trust him believe him and receive his wonderful embrace of his word praise god forevermore celebration that we are here praise god i want to tell you we ain't warning here i don't know if anybody's here mourning jesus dying on the cross because brother sister all the mourning on the grieving took place three days from the time he died until his resurrection that's all the morning that took place and that morning was because of lack of understanding but if they knew why he went to the cross what was his all about the effects of the world the power of its testimony the mission that he came to declare the father's name a mission to die or praise god they would have been rejoicing even before the upper room but god had it that way until the death pentecost then the holy ghost fell praise god and revealed to them why he did these things oh praise god forevermore i tell you the mourning and the grieving lasted for three days praise god but then walked up from the grave he arose when a mighty triumph is full amen yes sir it was victory time for them hallelujah they have victory praise god forevermore we celebrate the resurrection and we celebrate that that life as i said he is life is that right and because he is life he alone has the power to give life praise god and because he rolls on easter morn he's proving that he has overcome death death cannot could not conquer him and he is telling you that he is the victor he is telling you he is the mighty conqueror because death is under his feet amen but then we are his children we may not fully realize all the powers that reside within us but as we come into a conscious realization through the personalization of the word making itself manifest then we will be able to make manifest not only the graces and the sweetness of the statue but the power of the word flowing through the body bringing glory to our father's name what a wonderful blessed time we're living in oh praise god forevermore i thank god for victory paul said thanks be unto god who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ thanks be unto god who gives us the power to overcome through our lord jesus christ that's how we overcome all your troubles all the trials all your circumstances all what seems to be impossible to you is possible with god for nothing is impossible with the living god hallelujah amen praise god and i praise god look i really thank god for this life that is within me because it makes me do and say things that i don't have nothing to do with and i give glor god the glory for that amen and and so i want to share this life with somebody else if i can get them to get this life praise god oh my that's what i'm doing right now this is what i'm doing tonight i'm trying to share this life that is

are not walking alone but you are what somebody else is walking with you the king and i walk la lights road together amen god walking with you every step of the way praise god hallelujah so here we are giving glory to the name of jesus as i wind this portion of my talk up and allowing the brothers enough time to prepare be prepared for the lord's supper here we know that before we had the bread and wine the lord's supper long before this the passover was instituted and moses incidentally was not incidentally moses was the prophet he was the one that brought them the word of god that you are to stay in your house and people don't like to hear words like that stay in your house this is not coveted i'm talking about i'm just talking about back there in egypt because it was their life you stay in your house and you stay there and place the the mark of the blood upon the door praise god and when the dead angel passes he sees the blood he'll pass over you praise god that's another thought when he sees the blood not the chemicals there because the life is in the blood and so on praise god but my brother's sister that was a time of deliverance for god's people it was a wonderful time of deliverance and now we have come to the fulfillment and the fullness of it all this is time not for the first exodus this is time for the final last exodus of god's people out of egypt's land out of babylon out of strife out of torment out of sickness out of trouble this is our deliverance time our time out of every form of bondage hallelujah praise god so we want to celebrate our deliverance hallelujah not look back to that that uh uh exodus then but we are looking forward to a rapture there's a rapture in progress and the fullness of that rapture attained upon us oh every day we sense the presence and coming of the lord and i end with my thought here again taste and see that the lord is good hallelujah he delivered us from sin he delivered us from sickness he delivered us from every possible habit every bondage that the devil would have tried to put upon us we want to thank god hallelujah that we are being delivered and now we can just give a temporary celebration until we go to the real celebration in the skies where we have the lord's supper around the lord's table praise god i don't know if it's gonna be bread and wine anymore because we're not we won't be on the symbols no more right you see i don't want to go there no because i'm going to go off into something else but remember we passed the time of symbols so when you go into the law into the presence of the lord for that supper i don't know if it's going to be wine and bread because the symbols are gone so what is it think about it amen it will be a feast but feast of what frisk thank god every true child of god has been delivered from bondage and now we can taste eternal life and this lord's supper is always a reminder to his children to remember nothing can keep you or hold you here this is just temporary amen taste and see that the lord is good and when you recognize what peter was trying to say that you have been blessed that you were one that was literally set up hand-picked chosen and elected by god from all the millions billions in the world just like how he looked upon the whole world and one virgin caught his attention is that right he's looked again and now when he looked what does he see an elected few praise god that's why brother branham said you you should rejoice one in a million oh my god saw what was in you praise god so brothers and sisters let us rejoice and praise god tonight and as we take this lord's supper take it with reality take with good conviction take it with confidence and may god keeps this wonderful circle together that we may be a bouquet of flowers that when he comes again praise god i don't know who's going to put it around his neck to celebrate his return oh praise god but we welcome back the king amen our heavenly father as the officers come for the service of the lord's supper bless us all together as we partake with a full clear understanding sanctified to our bodies in the name of jesus christ i place your life upon the emblems amen that we may partake of it and we may have life or have our lives revived glory and honor and praise be to thee in jesus name amen and amen praise the name of the lord god bless
