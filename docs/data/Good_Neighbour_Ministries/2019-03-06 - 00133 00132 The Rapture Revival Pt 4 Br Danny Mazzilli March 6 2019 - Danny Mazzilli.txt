TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] this is the moment that Satan who's in tries to give you a bottle yeah they don't appreciate you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] just like God use it you want to get better and better the better you watch God just say okay [Music] because people recognize how God is using you you think you're on earth yes if you get a huge blessing God said to a billion dollars or something like that you just want to hide if you give you actual ordinate you can't be anything that they're not it's God leads you the way that you are if you're seeing certain things and you're able to see beyond and and certain change of circumstance of st. Matthew bound in your thinking in certain ways then the Word of God is here tonight so release you from three Purple's bondages we'll have to change that are holding you back from d-day men it'll be in the line for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many our luck so awesome see this is all very clear right here so for by the one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not whatever beautiful let's look at the next slide the Spirit of God when you get a chance I'm not gonna be on Corinthians well you get a chance though and read it after you hear the word and after that you know the fact that were that were that were allowing only spirited to search and dig into our lives with go back read the scriptures you will see how they come alive how they come to life in your day right now how the Greeks feed into your position as a son or daughter of God but God's Spirit displays God's power through each of us as a means of the entire body it's a means of the entire body because using every one of us but it's actually him displaying himself in his entirety to this world so what a spiritual gift so in part because it helps a lot in a row you see whether the gifts get into their positions the body grows the body gets healthy the body gets strong the body is able how to to do greater things you know what can cast out a thousand two can cast out 10,000 imagine that we get into the into the unity of the Spirit of God in our position and allow the Holy Spirit to operate that way but this church special church Saints this is not this is not a normal ministry if you recognize over the years you must've realized God gave us a unique leader Todd gave us unique leadership Pradas placed within the church body certain aspects of the positive he is working by firefight by a level of Revelation that you seldom know unless you're here listen to other ministers and because God place you believe this is where we get this is where we received a supernatural inspiration of God that gives each one of us and empower us every one of us in our positions in need it just it just simplest it comes so simple there's an anointing on the Word of God sometimes you listen and you know you're listening to surface and there's just no anointing there's nothing that that's feeding you well maybe it's because that's not your pastor and you are not clear yet who their customers [Music] you can be done for 10 years and still be done in London because you're watching me because you're not allowing the Spirit of God to settle you and you know to just let go of certain attitudes and certain you know negative stinking thinking that's just where we're creatures of the environment right so sometimes we pick up steam can take another get rid and allow the Spirit of God to move us into our position [Music] [Music] cleaner hops over there cleaning your your attitude is not just right and you feel I shouldn't be doing this or what I do this I'm just using that as an example could be whatever it is what weird is that God prepared to be in your position when you're in that position understanding how to identify how it's so necessary to strengthen identify the body of Christ it changes your attitude they don't waken to you to see your position a lot clearer next slide when we read Matthew 25 over here read this but it's all about with the court you know you can engage so many talents to serve servants now they've had some of them they took those talents and they put into service and put them to work they put into action they use them for the glory of God and they multiply they multiply they started to bring forth fruit that their ministry began to grow all of a sudden you know from one individual that was you know clean the church the others and competitors a team there's a there's a group disembodiment that's working together they're things joined together in there they're operating my faith and they realize that how important it is for the body to have you know a clean house the Lord's house [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it's just gonna be a sweet you know honeymoon when you come to Christ there's a great battle but you can know that the great Jehovah God stands right [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the Church of God be perfected [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] he was somebody in while that one little gift is so important in the body of Christ so important this church you need to realize that these are not God to use you and place you and give you their position no matter who you are how old you are it's irrelevant if you that's the spirit of God and realizing that this is the truth that this message there's no higher revelation of the Spirit of God on this earth than this revelation of what God is doing in this day I'm not talking about this church I'm talking about the body of Christ the Church of Jesus Christ the Spirit of God because Jesus is very much alive he rose in order to fulfill the scripture see he rules in order to come into you and me so that he can fulfill his purpose and plan and take this plan of redemption right to the next page that's like so five-point conscience these are things that we want to just look at don't confuse gifts with natural talents you could have natural talents but yet it's not the gift that God gave you for the body you see there's there's like you know it's almost like a paradox right because you don't think we can be gifted in many different ways but it doesn't mean that that's the thing that you're going to fulfill in the body of Christ don't confuse gifts with the fruit of the Spirit fruit shows maturity as you grow in front of the fruit of the Spirit which is the spirit of love compassion and love for one another and all of those things that that shows maturity but the gifts they show your mystery they show you a ministry in the body of Christ the purpose and oncology deal where give protection tendency in other words expecting others to serve the way that you you want to look at something because you're doing a certain thing and becomes your your puck gets seen right your Park gets seen and it could become depleted it could be with whatever mystery and then you expect somebody else to be doing that why are they because maybe you got my own business too many people gossiping talking about other people let the Holy Spirit move through the Word of God God could speak he's no continues to do tend to direct dye to lead this church run from this place here gentlemen starts right here in the house of water needs to say something position people and give them a little push he'll do it don't worry about need we don't need to allow that spirit because Satan what he tries to do he just I put a little pasta party tries to put a little credible spirit on you and before you know it you're starting to put little edges between brothers and sisters no baby that has to stop just saying that these types of things are the kinds of things that the Delta tries to use to try to get people to you know print division between one another that's the tactics of the depth don't feel your gifts make you superior to others these are the things that we need to just know we need to help the more you humble yourself to greater time can you realize that using your gifts without love is worthless so you wanna exercise you know your office in your position and you want to exercise it like that like a dictator you wanna you wanna so dark places you over the cleaning crew and you want to be a dictator instead of loving each one of those individuals that's working with you and having that Satan purpose and plan and mold which is the rapture that's our goal our goal is the rapture in our illness that translation so that we can go for a mess [Music] I may be able to speak the languages are very even angels this is the interpreted right from the first Canadians I'm they have gift of inspired preaching I we have all knowledge and all the things to do problems but if I don't have love I'm talking genuine love of God now when you see one of your brothers and sisters down or or in a bad attitude because sometimes you know listen we're in human flesh sometimes the powers of the defects are Pierce and they can get pretty beaten up and all of a sudden is you know there's an atmosphere around my brother sister like you that's not what it is you need to realize if you're in the body of Christ that you know that your son or daughter God you gotta realize that that is your flesh that is human weakness you gotta see beyond that and you can [Music] [Music] Christ you it's not question dealing with and so you can actually project that love of God into that situation and I'm not seeing you've gotta be a pushover and you gotta let them push forward and this is not dog but you can simply double you say listen brother the system that we need to sit down and we need to pray together so that so so that we can both overcome this thing that that you know that that is challenging both of us because I'm involved for some reason and if I have been both because God is building and shaping needed certain ways through my position for my office whatever it is has a deacon dealing with individuals dealing with families dealing with certain situations we've got to have certain you know patience in the way that we deal with certain things but God knows how shape us for parents hold us so that we can operate in these positions but if we have a revelation of that the power of love what is projected into a situation grayskin table and the saints not just talking if i have seen it with my only twice and i know you have to when you've been genuine and you can you can weep deprive that person you see it change you see it like like all the sudden they just you have to tell [Music] these are gifts that were just looking at gifts within the body of Christ these are gifts that communicate God's work and communicates the unbelievers and believers first gift is preaching we realize that there's you know that all these these are all different gifts but we need to see how they activate within the body of Christ and they communicate birth management that's discernment of the Spirit you know when you go to your pastor you go to your deacon or you go to fellowship with certain brother or sister you know that there could be a gift of discernment that's right there in the midst of your fellowship and it will supernaturally discern certain situations and speak to your situations and deliver you it will deliver you because certain individuals have that gift in them and it just activates because it's the Spirit of God because the person has the love of God as a revelation of third up they're placing in the body of Christ that their desire is only to see them the further lift of the body to see them be strengthened to see it be encouraged right next slide next slide and then an apostle the ability to start new churches know received a boat these are all arms within the church and we've got some individuals that are anointed they're pulling out that are there on the mission field that are out there and they're actually assisting other parts of the body in different parts to world and that's a gift and that's the position that God has given them and they need to operate in that position they can't be held back they have to be encouraged they have to be supported if we know we've got certain broken in the church for that for certain gifts certain abilities God will fade away got to open the doors stop we use them in those areas next I get educators people teaching we got Sunday school of course anetha teaching that comes from the bulkan front of the five for visiting they go be a pastor they asked all all kinds of gifts within them to teach to inspire to preschool teacher because that's you know you take that gift serious it's because God is still working on you got still hoping [Music] [Music] because now they're seeing the purpose now I see what they're supposed to be doing instead of encouragement to us you know we should all be encourages I believe children of God there encourages we should always be looking for the good don't worry talking correct about correcting in the body of Christ is kind of obvious positions through the Word of God but we should be encourages you can correct by encouraging certain individuals that just filled encouragers I'll sit and eventho shoot with everyone I feel the birds I'll feel strengthened I feel I feel like I feel incurs I feel straight out to go on and overcome in this situation wisdom God places wisdom in the body of Christ these are certain gifts that embraces within the body in order to build the body in order to direct the body you see you've got to be willing he come from it comes from God and it comes in its season and it comes through its office and through its position at the right time the season when certain wisdom needs to come from the pasture to the individuals he has certain offices and certain positions God who's in that plate because there's faith on both ends in that particular circumstance or situation when it comes to the film the major aspects of leadership are financed with motorbike as much as the trustee you know in dealing with finance dealing with them with the church in certain ways and God direct the pastor given the inspiration and [Music] [Music] when you just when you can just give ourselves missions it's another you might find yourself inspired to get more towards the missions to maybe support Commission's in certain ways are however these are all triggers this is a Bible study tonight so that we can be triggered in the Word of God to see where it is that God wants us to operate next it's the ability to adapt to the different culture in order to reach unbelievers and how believers from that culture through missions next gives them educate possible service certainly whatever be needed by the service you'll be like whatever there's events readily ready to serve you sisters you know when it comes to certain things we have guest speakers we have you know guest visitors to the church and all of a sudden we have like you know the sisters prepare meals and all these things the simple things but when you're ready to act when you aren't all the time it shows that you have faith and you're ready to serve God's people amen mercy you know these are these are little things have no we should be able to come to one another and go to one another and not be condemned you know we should be able to find mercy if it's not in our circumstance one another we should be merciful people I bought cells still these are unique things by kilowatt it's true we need to get over we're dealing with certain situations and circumstances we should have these situations because we should be there could be other pastors we don't know only God knows but it's it's a gift people give is it's a revelation but suddenly catch the revelation of giving it's a powerful link they can change your financial life because you're doing it my fate you've been placed into the body given that ability now you can actually allow it to operate through you thanks the ability to generously contribute material resources and we were running the other 10% time so that the body that probably be strengthened the ability to earn advantage money so it may be given to support the ministry others powerful the gift and the reputation are giving his next intersection these are gifts that celebrate God's presence he's a good beaten to be a prayer warrior to be faithful in prayer to intercede for the body of Christ for the local church for the leadership for your pasta for your career offices in the church the trustees and the Deacons of the prison and the Sunday School teachers being an intercessory individual that that intercedes constantly in prayer using if you've got to give it to music he should be allowing that gift the operator to really get into that position and encouraged opposition strengthen the ER through your gift practices stir it up in the arts and props go to the Sunday School you pray for people because we feel that inspiration you feel the two bullets and pray for certain people to sit further than the hold hands with them and say you know like I really believe that God is going to heal you hungry so they have shown you something in your heart and you just wipe these secretly you're going to do it you don't have to be you have to be you know publicly you know keep that gift people about the Spirit of God to use it it'll build the body it will strengthen the body and then will be an encouragement to the body of Christ the ability to prison faith specifically for people who need physical emotional or spiritual healing and seek on its merits this we hope witness miracles and we witness them through our intercession and prayer through our you know directing and guiding leading through the preaching of the word God we've heard testimonies of individuals receiving miracles because the word God spoke from to that situation they live that's tongues and interpretation of tongues if it's a genuine gift it's gonna operate it's gonna operate by the Spirit of God there's going to be speaking in tongues there's going to be an interpretation it's not going to be confused it's not going to be but they're not give this in the body of Christ and when it was the operating will not operate in such a way that it will be confusion that God's given you a different interpretation of the tongues when you hear the toxin will have interpretation supernaturally placed in you to speak that's the way I was given the gift of interpretation and finally the gifts that supported all purposes and give some leadership but you know places you into leadership positions for a reason because he wants you to direct the God in most areas of the body of Jesus Christ and they need to stay in those positions of God's place you there and you need to move in that position you need to strengthen that position you need to do things that will that will strengthen your gift read research it'll do what you need to do in order to you know become more effective than that gift to get the leadership and to give the demonstration and so the next line says think it's a it's a it's a tremendous thing to go that you've been given the revelation of God's Word on the organization the part that you are the faith of operate in that position in whatever capacity God has given it and so it's the ability to trust God and what cannot be seen and God's promise regardless of what it's a willingness to risk failure pursuit of a body provision expecting God this is just a plain simple interpretation but we know that faith is when God supernaturally reveals to you that you know God revealed that God is able to do it you don't you know you don't fear don't fear the devil you don't fear the lies about that was gonna tell you all you're not gonna do it you're not though you do believe that you move forward what because the next slide says that this bride here is the secret the word is enterprise it's the same spirit is Christ in you and the mind of Christ to know what he was done she does it in his name she has thus saith the Lord that an experiment eyes so all these spirit waters in my brother's broad and serves its purpose so it's not about currently positioning people into certain positions and currently we are maturing now we are will be beyond that you need some help we need some direction it will be there you will know God is inspiring you've got us beaten God give you a dream God lead to the search scripture I will show you who you are in the Word of God because this is what he's done he's placed the spirit at you let the musicians come the next line says and this is the conclusion the word bride have made yourself so it's it's a paradox we're being given the faith we're moving into our positions we're doing that sometimes unconsciously but this is the other word becomes conscious we're now you see yourself more that's called perfect faith when you see yourself your decision the part that you are operating in that position and see it actually right here god bless your six I trusted you even stir in certain ways you know kind of just about yourself to assert yourself and look at these different aspects and it should be encouraging because a lot of you are doing with a fantastic your dedication here in your time you know your sincerity towards the body of Christ right here we need each other [Music] [Applause] [Music]
