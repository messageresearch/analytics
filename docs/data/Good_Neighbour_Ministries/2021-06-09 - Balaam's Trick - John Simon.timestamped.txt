[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] good wednesday evening
[0:16] good to be here with you again in the
[0:20] name of the lord jesus christ
[0:22] may the lord bless us all together
[0:26] as we studied tonight
[0:30] on the subject of balaam's
[0:34] trick balaam's trick
[0:37] and our scripture reading
[0:41] is found in revelation chapter
[0:44] 2 reading verse 14.
[0:50] but i have a few things against thee
[0:55] because thou hast there
[0:58] them that hold the doctrine
[1:02] of balaam who taught balak
[1:07] to cast a stumbling block
[1:10] before the children of israel
[1:13] to eat things sacrificed
[1:17] unto idols and to commit
[1:22] fornication amen
[1:25] thanks be to god
[1:29] our righteous lord
[1:32] and heavenly father
[1:36] thy blessings we
[1:39] accept and believe and receive today
[1:46] for we gather in no other name
[1:50] but in the illustrious glorious
[1:54] wonderful and marvelous name
[1:57] of our lord and savior jesus christ
[2:01] may to him be all the praise honor and
[2:04] glory
[2:06] amen and amen
[2:14] well thanks be to god i'm so happy that
[2:18] the lord has
[2:19] no regard or respect
[2:23] for the educational systems and
[2:27] informations of men they may be
[2:30] important for
[2:31] our existence uh uh
[2:34] here on the earth but in the eyes of god
[2:39] uh you know god has no respect for this
[2:44] these nickelodeon um
[2:47] you know awards and phds and
[2:52] ddds and bas and
[2:55] lld's whatever god has no respect for
[2:59] that
[3:00] there is respect for that here on the
[3:02] earth
[3:04] because it's needed for people to
[3:08] live uh you know and to go through the
[3:11] system
[3:13] be able to work to make an earning to
[3:16] provide for their families
[3:18] their own welfare and therefore they
[3:21] need it
[3:22] so you must understand i'm not saying
[3:25] i'm saying to you education is needed
[3:28] and necessary
[3:30] for our earthly walk and existence
[3:35] but in the eyes of god he has
[3:38] no regard and respect for that
[3:41] because he himself said
[3:44] all the wisdom of all the kings and all
[3:47] the princes of the earth
[3:50] are nothing but a drop in a
[3:53] bucket to me so the wisdom of man
[3:56] is nothing in the eyes of god
[3:59] and the wisdom of natural man will
[4:02] never understand the wisdom of god
[4:07] which appears to them to be too
[4:10] simple it appears to them
[4:14] as if it's nothing but that's the way
[4:17] god
[4:18] loves it to appear in that
[4:21] manner god has no regard to
[4:25] man-made organizations
[4:28] well they love their organizations from
[4:31] the time of
[4:32] nimrod nimrod started
[4:35] organizing armies and battalions
[4:38] platoons and
[4:40] so on uh having it that way and
[4:43] that has morphed and moved itself
[4:48] and propagated itself until
[4:51] this day in the form of refined and
[4:55] distilled
[4:57] organizations uh with their abilities
[5:00] and capacities to literally conquer the
[5:03] earth
[5:05] organizationally and so god has no
[5:08] respect for them
[5:10] but in the midst of it all the god of
[5:12] heaven
[5:14] having respect for israel
[5:18] uh because israel had respect for him
[5:22] and his word amen
[5:25] and god vindicated israel
[5:29] in the midst of all that was happening
[5:33] or occurring god vindicated them
[5:38] of course israel did not look like a
[5:41] really polished people
[5:44] or a polished nation they
[5:48] came out of egypt running for their
[5:51] lives
[5:53] crossing the red sea going into the
[5:56] desert
[5:57] and having to constantly
[6:01] flee from the presence of any ever
[6:04] present
[6:05] danger but thank god
[6:08] in the midst of it all there are a
[6:11] blessed people
[6:14] hallelujah we also had to come out
[6:18] from denomination denominations
[6:22] we came away from the the
[6:25] denominational slavery we came away
[6:29] from the old task masters
[6:32] and we had to run spiritually for our
[6:36] lives
[6:38] we are here to tonight to give praise
[6:41] honor and glory to god
[6:44] because like israel we might just spend
[6:48] lifetime in a certain denomination a
[6:51] certain
[6:52] church doing preaching or
[6:55] doing sunday school teaching or in the
[6:58] ladies
[6:59] fellowship or association whatever we
[7:02] could do
[7:03] to help what we sought at that time
[7:07] was the work of god tending
[7:10] spirit sheep and slaving away
[7:14] in the fields oh my
[7:17] and yet we were under death of uh
[7:21] uh excommunication or
[7:24] or anything of that matter but thanks be
[7:28] to god
[7:29] we are now free for whom the son of man
[7:33] sets free
[7:35] is free indeed you are free
[7:38] in jesus christ enjoy your
[7:42] freedom come forth into the glorious
[7:45] liberty of the sons and daughters
[7:48] of god and enjoy the freedom
[7:52] that is in christ freedom i say
[7:56] not folly not the foolishness of sin
[8:00] amen liberty but
[8:03] not the lawlessness that comes
[8:06] that one thinks they can walk anyway
[8:10] live anyhow and still be acceptable to
[8:13] god
[8:14] no that is not what i am
[8:17] talking about i'm talking about complete
[8:21] total surrender to him in gratitude for
[8:24] what he has done for
[8:26] us we surrender our hearts and our lives
[8:30] into his glorious marvelous keeping
[8:34] knowing that he will keep us to the very
[8:37] end amen oh praise
[8:40] god here was israel
[8:44] oh a people that were looked down upon
[8:49] even as the believers of this message
[8:52] looked down upon by all the nations
[8:56] round about denominations round about
[9:00] and the more bites and the ammonites
[9:05] oh my they were relatives
[9:09] of israel through lot
[9:12] and having incest with his two daughters
[9:16] producing those two nations of the
[9:19] moabites
[9:20] and the ammonites and so they
[9:23] knew the the scripture
[9:28] as much as as
[9:31] anyone else because they knew
[9:34] about uh abraham and
[9:37] what abraham's faith was one god
[9:41] revelation of the holy spirit they
[9:44] were conscious of this and so
[9:48] they believed it that way amen
[9:52] oh my friends even in that way as moab
[9:56] and
[9:56] ammon looked down upon israel
[10:00] organizations looked down upon the true
[10:03] church of the living god because she
[10:06] appears like a little flock
[10:08] she appears as a disorganized
[10:12] bunch of people from everywhere
[10:16] as the old song said they come from the
[10:19] east and west
[10:23] they come from the lands afar
[10:26] [Applause]
[10:27] to feast with the king to
[10:30] dine as his guests how blessed these
[10:34] pale
[10:34] brains are beholding his hallowed face
[10:41] ago with light divine
[10:45] bless partakers of his grace
[10:49] as gems in his crowns to shine
[10:54] yes jesus is coming soon
[10:58] oh praise god jesus is coming soon
[11:02] rapture time is here let us get our
[11:05] lamps trimmed on
[11:07] burning and be ready for the master
[11:10] praise
[11:11] god hallelujah amen
[11:14] hallelujah so organizations
[11:20] naturally or oh and i may say
[11:24] but abnormally love to look down upon
[11:28] god's true church the little flock
[11:33] the little speckled bird
[11:36] they look down upon her amen
[11:40] that little ugly duckling so-called
[11:44] and they say all manner of evil against
[11:49] her
[11:50] and they will try finally
[11:53] to get her to join with them
[11:57] and when they can't get you to join with
[11:59] them
[12:00] their their last step their final
[12:03] if i may say solution is to destroy
[12:08] such a people who gather
[12:12] not in a church name but gather
[12:15] in no other name but the name of the
[12:18] lord
[12:19] and savior jesus christ amen
[12:22] hallelujah friends the bible says
[12:27] that balaam seduced god's people
[12:32] into committing fornication
[12:37] and i want to say that today
[12:40] people are being seduced by
[12:44] denominational teachers
[12:47] of great natural knowledge
[12:50] wealth of knowledge and they seduce the
[12:54] people
[12:56] or persuade or convince the people
[13:00] to come with them join their
[13:03] denomination
[13:05] and thereby committing spiritual
[13:08] fornication against god
[13:12] amen they commit spiritual fornication
[13:17] by accepting false seed
[13:21] or false doctrine instead
[13:25] of the fullness of the word of god
[13:29] well you say well brother simon
[13:33] what is your thought here my objective
[13:35] is that i
[13:36] want to do all i can here to get you to
[13:40] escape
[13:42] from that trap that was set for you
[13:46] amen oh praise god
[13:50] now everything written in the scriptures
[13:52] we know
[13:53] is for our admonition our advice
[13:57] and our guidance so that we can
[14:00] learn from it in the book of
[14:03] numbers chapter 23
[14:07] verse 9 from the top of the rocks i see
[14:11] him
[14:14] from the hills i behold him
[14:17] lo the people shall dwell alone
[14:21] and shall not be reckoned
[14:25] among the nations oh praise god
[14:28] god is looking down seeing israel
[14:32] and realize that israel is dwelling
[14:36] on the rocks oh praise god
[14:39] what a place to the children of god to
[14:43] be
[14:43] to be standing on the rock revelation of
[14:46] the word of god
[14:48] but to the people of the world they
[14:50] believe you're on the rocks
[14:53] you you you you got serious problems
[14:56] serious trouble
[14:58] i can't live like that i can't be like
[15:00] that but you see
[15:01] if you're a real christian and you have
[15:03] the revelation you're rejoicing
[15:06] night and day as you walk the narrow way
[15:09] for the hand of god upon your life you
[15:13] see
[15:14] oh my glory god so i'm glad
[15:17] that i'm on the rocks oh take
[15:20] god never mind they're gonna come to
[15:23] judgment
[15:24] and the rock will be on them but the
[15:27] bible tells us the rocks of god
[15:29] how the mills of god grinds slowly
[15:32] oh my but they're grind sure
[15:36] and it's one thing for you to be on the
[15:39] rock it's another thing for the rock
[15:41] to fall on you for the scriptures that
[15:44] it will
[15:45] grind you to powder amen
[15:48] hallelujah oh god looks down upon israel
[15:53] and he's seeing all their faults all
[15:56] their mistakes
[15:58] and he's seeing all their good that they
[16:01] do
[16:02] just as he looks upon us we are still in
[16:05] our earthly journey
[16:07] living in this flesh and we are still
[16:09] apt to make
[16:10] mistakes not deliberate or purposeful
[16:14] mistakes but if you sin we have advocate
[16:18] with the father
[16:19] we have the cleansing of the blood we
[16:22] have the forgiveness of
[16:23] our sins from our heavenly father
[16:27] not an earthly one but thank god
[16:30] we have that so god knows everything
[16:33] about us
[16:34] but from his great fullness
[16:37] of his love and his mercy he forgives
[16:41] his children
[16:43] oh thank god the bible says israel
[16:47] dwelt alone we're not even
[16:51] organized amen you see
[16:54] people up don't understand there's a
[16:58] difference between
[16:59] organization and order you can be
[17:02] disorganized
[17:03] in other words you're not of the systems
[17:07] you don't take any of the tried proven
[17:10] systems that they have in the world but
[17:13] you are still
[17:14] walking or walking with god
[17:17] in a order a supernatural
[17:21] order of god hallelujah
[17:24] for oh praise god hallelujah amen
[17:28] now we find out
[17:32] israel not being an organized system
[17:35] or nation they had no king
[17:40] amen but thank god they had a prophet
[17:44] glory to god and that prophet's
[17:47] message that prophet's word
[17:50] was what they lived by and
[17:53] walked by amen hallelujah
[17:57] and the prophet had god in him
[18:01] and the spirit would speak through the
[18:04] prophet
[18:04] thus saith the lord god
[18:08] will use that man speak through him
[18:11] and be a voice to his people hallelujah
[18:15] praise god thank god hallelujah
[18:19] israel did not belong to the united
[18:22] nations
[18:23] of that day and as a group
[18:26] as a people that follows the message
[18:30] of william marian branham
[18:34] the 20th century prophet
[18:37] the messenger of the bible
[18:41] revelation 10 7
[18:44] hallelujah we belong
[18:48] not to any united nations
[18:52] neither do we belong
[18:56] to any world council of churches
[19:02] we don't belong to any individual
[19:05] denomination
[19:08] any other group we do not belong
[19:13] and we don't need to belong to any such
[19:16] things
[19:18] because in our hearts we belong to god
[19:22] we belong to him hallelujah
[19:25] glory to god and we don't need their
[19:29] counsel we don't need their
[19:32] advice or their admonition
[19:37] all we need is to listen to the voice of
[19:41] god among us
[19:42] thus saith the lord hallelujah
[19:46] amen praise god amen
[19:50] now let's talk a bit about balaam
[19:53] balaam had the proper approach to god
[19:58] and he was so anointed that from time to
[20:02] time
[20:03] he would actually get genuine revelation
[20:07] from the presence of god
[20:10] but he still used
[20:13] his anointing and his gift to join
[20:17] himself the moab
[20:19] a type of a denomination
[20:22] and there because he wanted the position
[20:27] of being a chief bishop a
[20:30] man that is renowned recognized
[20:35] and well paid well taken care of
[20:39] so he positioned himself in that wise
[20:44] now what did he do for this great favor
[20:48] to be luck now
[20:52] balaam formulated a plan
[20:55] and it was a very cunning
[20:58] uh plan that balaam had
[21:03] and i'm going to show you
[21:06] and tell you this plan
[21:10] for this is balaam's trick that he used
[21:15] in trying to trick seduce and
[21:18] entrap the children of
[21:21] israel you see
[21:25] he had a plan to be
[21:28] able to entrap israel into sin
[21:32] thereby forcing god
[21:36] trying to force god to bring down
[21:39] judgment upon israel because
[21:43] israel if they sin then god said he will
[21:46] judge the sinner
[21:47] and so if he can get israel
[21:50] to sin then he would literally
[21:54] stand back and force the hands of god
[21:59] to enforce his own law
[22:03] and to judge the people of israel of
[22:06] course they
[22:07] made no i had no understanding of god's
[22:11] love mercy and grace in the midst of
[22:14] mistakes
[22:15] sinning falling whatever uh wherever
[22:19] it's in the same way
[22:23] satan in the garden
[22:26] use the very same trick
[22:29] see balaam used the same trick so it's
[22:32] satan again
[22:34] but satan knew that if he could
[22:37] beguile or defile
[22:41] eve then my brother sister
[22:46] if he could get her to fall
[22:49] into fleshly sin in any way
[22:54] then god would have to
[22:57] pass his sentence of
[23:00] death and judgment upon her
[23:04] so that was the trick that he wanted to
[23:07] use
[23:09] and still uses to this day
[23:12] but he failed to recognize
[23:16] god's plan the plan of redemption
[23:22] god in mercy and in judgment
[23:28] excuse me hear my friends
[23:33] that he planned it so
[23:37] that if he could get israel
[23:40] to come and join him
[23:43] in sin then it would force the hand of
[23:46] god
[23:48] to bring judgment upon them
[23:52] so he sent out invitations
[23:57] to the nations round about
[24:00] and he sent out an invitation to israel
[24:04] to come and join them at the feast
[24:09] of baal pior now
[24:12] there it is oh it's just like the
[24:16] denominations today will say oh come
[24:19] over
[24:19] and worship with us we all relatives
[24:23] we all christian just like moab was
[24:27] with israel oh my
[24:30] come over and worship with us we are all
[24:33] brethren
[24:34] we are all brothers we all christians
[24:38] but listen friends well it's different
[24:41] kinds of christians
[24:43] and you know you want to know who you
[24:46] are
[24:47] and why god raised you up
[24:50] in the midst of all of this oh
[24:54] israel no doubt had seen
[24:57] egyptian feasts and so they did not
[25:00] think much much about it
[25:04] just as some believers today
[25:08] will say uh oh i don't see nothing much
[25:11] about going to this
[25:12] banquet or this uh
[25:16] denomination i don't see anything with
[25:19] the party
[25:20] that they have over there or the outing
[25:24] that they have over there the retreat or
[25:27] the campground that they have
[25:29] i see nothing whatsoever that
[25:32] is wrong with that amen
[25:36] and i believe we ought to love them
[25:39] we ought to love them and
[25:42] win them to christ win them
[25:45] over to the message and being
[25:49] friendly and nice never hurt
[25:52] anybody whatsoever
[25:55] oh maybe that's the way they thought
[25:59] but when they got into that feast of
[26:02] bael pior
[26:04] and the music started the party started
[26:09] and those moabite women
[26:13] dressed up in all mineral short
[26:16] sex exposure clothing with their
[26:20] legs exposed
[26:24] the behind pushed out and everything
[26:27] else
[26:29] exposed before them just a
[26:32] matter of a fleshly display
[26:36] dancing around whirling around
[26:40] undressing striptease
[26:43] right in the feast you were stripping
[26:46] off
[26:47] dancing like salome dancing the seven
[26:50] veils dropping off a veil every time
[26:54] a church age was passing oh my
[26:57] until before the end of it all they were
[26:59] strict naked
[27:01] before them oh my and so
[27:04] here they were and israel was caught up
[27:07] into that
[27:09] and some of the israelite men
[27:13] fleshly were were tempted
[27:17] and fell into adultery and
[27:20] god in his wrath slew
[27:24] 40 000 of them that
[27:27] very day oh my friends
[27:30] just as much i tell you we've got to
[27:34] watch ourselves because i'm telling you
[27:38] they'll come with all those manner of
[27:40] temptations
[27:42] invite you to this great big meeting
[27:46] revival meeting and we all won
[27:49] and you don't know what's wrapped up in
[27:53] there
[27:54] oh my think of it now we know
[27:59] not only that balaam use
[28:02] satan's trick from the garden of eden
[28:07] but constantine after that
[28:10] used the same trick at the council
[28:14] of nicaea and his successes did
[28:19] they invited all the people
[28:22] they invited the true church along with
[28:25] the false church
[28:27] to a convention to this council
[28:31] that they would get together and so
[28:34] when they got together and the church
[28:37] sat down
[28:38] to eat and rose up to play
[28:42] and i used the term as the bible uses it
[28:44] rose up to play
[28:46] meaning uh that they rose up to
[28:50] partake to partake
[28:54] also like everyone
[28:57] and what did what happened there
[29:01] they began partaking of
[29:04] church forms they had to go along with
[29:08] them because they were present
[29:11] and they were partaking
[29:14] of the church ceremonies
[29:18] that partook of those
[29:21] pagan feasts that they were having
[29:25] at that time which was really pagan
[29:29] babylonian feasts with christian
[29:32] names on them trying to make it
[29:36] sound christian and making the people
[29:40] feel religious as if they were christian
[29:44] but they were against the word of god
[29:47] israel or the true church
[29:50] was thereby trapped
[29:55] and she had committed spiritual
[29:58] fornication and
[30:01] many times when a woman creates
[30:05] a natural fornication adultery
[30:10] just like that man would leave the house
[30:15] i want to tell you god walked out on
[30:18] israel
[30:19] he walked out of that house walked out
[30:21] of that place
[30:24] and there she was found in her
[30:28] filth found in her sin
[30:32] oh my when any man
[30:35] any woman turns away
[30:38] from the word of god nothing left
[30:41] but death and judgment as the book of
[30:44] proverbs says
[30:46] there's a way that seemeth right unto a
[30:49] man or to a woman
[30:51] but the ways thereof are the ways
[30:55] of death amen moment you
[30:59] join yourself you join yourself to a
[31:04] denomination
[31:06] the holy spirit takes his departure
[31:11] and that person dies spiritually
[31:15] don't join not denomination
[31:19] don't go out there and become
[31:22] the member of any of those systems
[31:26] whatsoever don't get taken up with their
[31:29] creeds
[31:30] or with their traditions or anything
[31:34] that that you want to place in place
[31:37] of the word and of the spirit because if
[31:40] you do
[31:41] you're dead in sins and in trespasses
[31:44] it's over for you
[31:46] and you become eternally separated from
[31:50] god
[31:51] away from him and that has happened
[31:55] every age since that time
[31:59] god delivers his people brings them
[32:02] out by the blood
[32:05] sanctifies them by his word
[32:09] let them walk through the waters of
[32:13] baptism get them
[32:16] under the pillar of fire filled with the
[32:20] spirit of god
[32:21] but after a while as god's people walk
[32:26] their first passion for him their first
[32:29] love for him the fire of
[32:33] zeal and desire begins to cool
[32:36] off from their lives and then
[32:40] somebody gets a good idea
[32:43] why don't we organize ourselves properly
[32:48] so that we can preserve our
[32:52] faith and make a name
[32:55] and be recognized by all these other
[32:57] denominations
[32:59] so that we can be recognized by by
[33:02] them you see and then they organize
[33:06] and they go right back backwards
[33:10] against god's word because they are no
[33:14] longer of the spirit of god or led by
[33:16] the spirit of god
[33:18] they're just now under a certain form
[33:21] of worship because the spirit has left
[33:24] that
[33:25] worship and now they are
[33:28] dead because they hybridize themselves
[33:32] with creeds and form
[33:35] and there is no life in them
[33:39] so what am i saying
[33:42] balaam got israel to commit
[33:46] fornication and
[33:49] do you know that the spirit
[33:53] lustful spirit of physical fornication
[33:58] is the same spirit that
[34:02] is on denominational organizational
[34:06] fornication desire
[34:10] for all those kinds of things
[34:14] it's right there in organized religion
[34:17] yes so the spirit of fornication
[34:22] is the spirit of religious
[34:25] organization and
[34:28] all fornicators will find themselves
[34:32] in the lake affair as the bible
[34:35] says because organizations
[34:39] denominations are of the devil
[34:42] it is not a form of god i do not speak
[34:46] of the people
[34:48] but i speak of the system of
[34:50] denomination
[34:52] genuine wonderful people are in there
[34:55] but they're trapped in a
[34:56] prison they're in a system that is
[35:00] contrary to the word of the living god
[35:04] that is why god will cast the old
[35:08] harlot and her daughters into the lake
[35:11] of fire
[35:13] amen he praise god
[35:16] it's a totally wrong spirit that
[35:19] separates
[35:20] god's people into this this group
[35:23] the denomination but baptist methodist
[35:27] they're divided in over 000 or 4
[35:31] 000 various groups all around the world
[35:34] various denominations around the world
[35:37] divided them from
[35:38] one church in the beginning
[35:41] into thousands all
[35:44] over each claiming truth right
[35:48] and that's the devil using them to
[35:50] create confusion
[35:53] instead of staying with your original
[35:55] faith
[35:57] they've moved away from it and create
[36:02] a spirit of discrepancy
[36:06] amen separate themselves from god
[36:11] now notice constantine
[36:15] gave special feasts onto the people
[36:20] and those religious feasts that he gave
[36:24] a spontaneous
[36:27] were the same old babylonian pagan
[36:31] feasts with new names
[36:35] from the christian faith that he took
[36:38] and put on those babylonian feasts
[36:42] and then has it mixed into
[36:46] the church of god i'm showing you how
[36:50] christianity got mixed in with paganism
[36:55] hybridized producing nothing but
[36:58] hybridized
[36:59] membership sons and daughters who
[37:02] believe they have the truth
[37:04] but they are high bred contrary to the
[37:08] word of god yes
[37:11] taking christian names
[37:15] putting them on old babylonian
[37:18] feasts and in some cases
[37:22] christian rights were taken
[37:26] and abused with pagan ceremonies
[37:31] he took the worship of the s-u-n
[37:35] the s-u-n for there were sun-worshippers
[37:39] and he took that and
[37:42] instead of celebrating the worship of
[37:46] the
[37:46] s-u-n god on december 21st
[37:51] which is the beginning of the winter
[37:54] solisties
[37:56] when the sun resurrects or returns begin
[37:59] to return again
[38:01] because that's when they used to
[38:03] celebrate
[38:05] the birthday of the sun
[38:08] god s-u-n god
[38:11] and so they put it on
[38:15] december 25th
[38:18] and to make it become christian
[38:22] they call it christ mass
[38:26] christ mass meanings
[38:29] worship so a mass is a worship
[38:33] so christ's mass or worship
[38:36] of christ was put on the 25th of
[38:39] december
[38:41] in order to recognize the birthday
[38:45] of the s-u-n god
[38:50] now most of the christians were slaves
[38:55] most of them were under persecution
[39:00] and when that feast day or we would say
[39:02] today
[39:03] holiday was given the christian
[39:07] slaves would come together
[39:10] and under the cover of them
[39:14] one side worshiping the s-u-n-god
[39:19] they would hide in their little uh
[39:21] underground places and caves and homes
[39:25] and they would give praise to god for
[39:28] the
[39:28] birth of the s o
[39:31] n of god so you see how
[39:35] the devil tricked the church by
[39:38] playing on the wash and to this day
[39:42] they would have a sun worst right in the
[39:44] churches
[39:45] right in the cathedrals while they are
[39:48] worshiping
[39:49] the s-u-n god we are here to give glory
[39:54] to the
[39:55] o n of god and to
[39:58] magnify and glorify
[40:01] his great name again
[40:05] hallelujah of course you know that the
[40:08] lord jesus christ was
[40:10] not born in december that's what that
[40:13] changed back there
[40:15] that he was really born in april
[40:19] in the spring when new life comes on the
[40:22] scene
[40:23] and when lambs are born
[40:26] born in april yes my friends
[40:30] but they took another feast
[40:33] and there the feast of astarte
[40:37] feast of the false goddess
[40:41] astarte and they change that
[40:45] and put a christian name on it and call
[40:48] it
[40:49] easter and there it is
[40:52] and started these religious traditions
[40:56] of men that are not of god
[41:01] now i'm showing you the difference that
[41:04] we
[41:05] worship and give glory to a genuine
[41:08] christ christmas worshiping the
[41:11] s o n of god while they are
[41:15] after the s-u-n god they may claim they
[41:19] are worshiping
[41:21] the son the son of god like you do
[41:24] but in actual fact back hidden
[41:28] in their so-called mysteries they are
[41:30] worshipping
[41:31] their sun god and now on the
[41:35] easter with all its bunnies
[41:38] with all its uh rabbits all its easter
[41:42] eggs
[41:43] they're really worshipping under a pagan
[41:46] babylonian feast
[41:48] they're worshiping astate
[41:51] and they call that easter
[41:54] which is supposed to celebrate
[41:58] the death burial and resurrection
[42:01] of the lord and actually that
[42:04] was a pagan feast of
[42:07] i started they began to place
[42:10] altars in the church are you with me
[42:13] here
[42:14] they began to put images
[42:18] right in the very church of god
[42:22] now exodus chapter 20
[42:25] verses 1 to 6 where god
[42:28] speaks expressly that you are to worship
[42:32] no other god
[42:34] for i the lord thy god he is the only
[42:38] god
[42:39] and he says the idols images of man
[42:44] you thou shalt not bow down to them nor
[42:48] serve them
[42:49] amen why for i the lord thy
[42:53] god i'm a jealous god hallelujah
[42:57] amen praise god and god
[43:00] promise in his word we should
[43:04] not do that and they still go ahead
[43:08] having idols images no matter how
[43:11] artistically beautiful they are god says
[43:15] thou shalt not bow down to them
[43:18] thou shalt not serve them and so
[43:23] they continue to do it to this day
[43:26] they've included also the apostles creed
[43:31] which is not found in your bible
[43:34] you can read it from cover to copper
[43:37] and you will never find any such thing
[43:41] as an apostles creed that is something
[43:43] they agreed upon
[43:45] and put together of themselves
[43:48] and change the entire
[43:52] uh god's economy that changed it
[43:55] upended it and placed these things
[43:58] in it they began to teach the people
[44:03] communion of saints the worshipping
[44:07] of their ancestors and they
[44:11] their teaching on communion of saints
[44:16] and by that they have made
[44:20] that church the most
[44:24] spiritualistic church in the entire
[44:28] world
[44:29] where the bible tells us clearly we are
[44:32] not to pray to the dead that is called
[44:37] necromancy and you are
[44:39] not supposed to pray to the dead they'll
[44:42] say oh
[44:43] well why do you pray to jesus he is not
[44:46] dead
[44:46] he is alive forevermore he himself
[44:50] said that and by his presence his spirit
[44:53] his vindication
[44:54] he proves that he's not dead but he's
[44:57] alive forevermore
[44:58] i want you to recognize that clearly
[45:01] here today
[45:02] my friends they brought images
[45:06] they brought in apostles creed
[45:10] amen they brought in ancestor worship
[45:13] which is nothing
[45:14] but witchcraft right into
[45:18] what they call the church of god
[45:22] amen and so they become the most
[45:24] spiritistic
[45:26] spirit uh witchcraft working
[45:30] church so-called under the name
[45:34] and guise of christianity
[45:37] working it that way where the bible
[45:40] tells you
[45:41] how every foul bird
[45:44] of protestantism and all their
[45:47] organization
[45:49] come in and find a roosting place
[45:53] within that babylonian system
[45:57] my friends altars high altars
[46:02] high so-called holy altars go read your
[46:05] bible where god says
[46:07] tear down those holy altars now my
[46:10] friends we don't do that today
[46:12] but we preached the word of god so you
[46:15] could recognize
[46:16] what where we are at and what this is
[46:19] all about
[46:20] they introduce incense in the house of
[46:23] god
[46:25] not there for us to do old testament
[46:28] yes not in the new testament images and
[46:32] idols
[46:33] oh my friends all these things
[46:37] were placed in the house of god contrary
[46:41] to the work of the holy spirit
[46:45] that began to establish shrines
[46:49] so-called holy places
[46:52] when the when jesus appeared in the monk
[46:55] transfiguration
[46:56] peter so-called pope
[47:00] wanted to establish a shrine a holy
[47:03] place there
[47:04] and jesus said no don't you do it
[47:07] don't establish nothing for moses nor
[47:10] elijah nor me don't put nothing here
[47:13] for the true worshipers will not worship
[47:16] god in mount jerusalem
[47:18] they will not worship god over here or
[47:20] over there
[47:21] but the true worshiper will worship
[47:25] god in spirit and in truth
[47:28] amen and i believe that according
[47:32] to the word of our god amen
[47:35] hallelujah so friends here they are
[47:39] introduce the confession
[47:42] of your sins to
[47:45] a sinful man called a priest
[47:49] a sinful man like yourself
[47:52] claiming that you confess to him
[47:56] and then he will forgive your sins
[47:59] on the leadership and under guidance
[48:04] contrary to god's word no such a thing
[48:06] in your bible
[48:08] that has uh uh a black
[48:11] hand dirty hands are gonna
[48:14] wash a dirty cattle and both are
[48:17] suddenly going to become clean
[48:19] it's not even logical it's not sensible
[48:22] it's not
[48:23] scriptural and it is not in
[48:26] the word of god the bible tells us
[48:30] god said i hate those who eats things
[48:34] sacrifice unto idols of course
[48:37] he's not speaking about just naturally
[48:40] he's speaking about
[48:41] spiritually partaking of their false
[48:44] teachings
[48:45] and of their false doctrines in
[48:48] that way they're taking it in amen
[48:52] now recognize here that god is speaking
[48:55] of all of this
[48:57] in a spiritual sense
[49:00] bowing down before images don't you
[49:03] partake of it
[49:06] lighting of candles
[49:09] don't you take part of it
[49:13] no sir using all minor
[49:16] pagan holidays and putting the name of
[49:19] christ on it
[49:21] do not partake of it
[49:24] amen confessing your sins
[49:28] to men like yourselves instead of going
[49:31] and confessing to
[49:33] god within the altar and the cathedral
[49:36] of your heart amen
[49:39] all those things belong to the devil's
[49:42] religion
[49:44] i repeat such things belongs to the
[49:48] devil's
[49:49] religion amen
[49:53] partakers of those evil things
[49:58] and you're an idolatry whether you admit
[50:02] it
[50:03] or not and look
[50:06] listen as in my childhood
[50:10] i went to saint aloysius uh
[50:13] by school i went to the church
[50:18] i did everything on ash wednesday and so
[50:21] on
[50:22] so i know what i'm talking about not
[50:25] only by experience experience
[50:29] but from study of the word and of
[50:32] certain histories
[50:33] which we will get to after a while and
[50:37] here we see friends whether you admit it
[50:41] or not
[50:42] you're caught up in idolatry innocently
[50:46] you don't know it but you were seduced
[50:49] persuaded by tradition and led to it
[50:54] by these so-called man
[50:57] contrary to the word of god
[51:00] amen they can say
[51:04] oh i'm really confessing to god but i'm
[51:06] just going to confess to the priest
[51:08] that's just the way of them collecting
[51:10] information
[51:11] on every member of their congregation
[51:15] and moving all that information back to
[51:17] their
[51:18] so-called headquarters or head people
[51:20] but anyway
[51:22] here it is friends well they
[51:25] they say the priest can forgive you of
[51:27] your sins
[51:28] the priest himself needs god's
[51:30] forgiveness
[51:31] for his sins no man can forgive sins
[51:36] but jesus christ himself amen
[51:39] hallelujah they can say what they
[51:42] want but they are actually practicing
[51:45] and partaking
[51:47] of that old babylonian satanic
[51:51] religion that originates
[51:54] way back in antiquity
[51:58] way back in bible days and it has
[52:01] winded its way like a snake
[52:05] amen leaving a trail of the serpent
[52:09] through
[52:09] time and bringing that foul
[52:13] evil slimy religion right down
[52:16] to this day and joining getting
[52:20] people to join themselves the idols
[52:23] partake of these ungodly feasts
[52:27] and committing spiritual fornication
[52:29] which will lead them
[52:31] to nothing else but spiritual death
[52:36] amen but thank god the true
[52:39] church the true church of god will marry
[52:43] or join herself to none other
[52:46] but jesus christ himself who
[52:49] is the word for in the beginning was the
[52:53] word
[52:53] and the word was with god and the word
[52:57] was god john 1 amen
[53:00] hallelujah amen so here
[53:05] that babylonian church married to the
[53:08] state
[53:10] while the true church married itself to
[53:12] god the word
[53:15] that's true the false church joined with
[53:18] idols
[53:19] and we the true church married to the
[53:22] holy
[53:23] spirit and his great revelation
[53:27] of himself in the word and with the
[53:31] power of the state behind them
[53:33] they feel as if they are all powerful in
[53:36] this world
[53:38] but on on the other hand with the power
[53:40] of the holy spirit behind us and
[53:42] in us we feel empowered and endued
[53:46] with the power of the great holy spirit
[53:49] to accomplish
[53:50] what god wants us to accomplish amen
[53:54] praise god thank god we do not
[53:58] reign no man really reigns on the earth
[54:02] no man can take the place of god
[54:05] or or or place himself that he is acting
[54:09] in the place of christ no sir
[54:13] there is only one lord jesus christ
[54:16] and we don't accept any head of any
[54:20] false church
[54:21] amen praise god we only accept
[54:25] one headship one husband one leadership
[54:29] and that is of jesus christ listen
[54:32] friends
[54:32] revelation 2 16 repent
[54:36] or else i will come unto thee quickly
[54:40] and fight against me with the sword
[54:43] of my mouth of course that is the word
[54:47] of god amen the two-edged sword hold on
[54:51] new testament
[54:52] caught you coming and caught you going
[54:54] amen
[54:55] behold god said it clearly in this word
[54:58] god can't overlook the sin of those who
[55:02] have done such things
[55:03] and so god says repent confess your
[55:07] wrong amen come to
[55:10] me for forgiveness and let me cleanse
[55:12] you
[55:13] and wash you amen praise god hallelujah
[55:17] this is god's command and for us to
[55:20] disobey it
[55:21] is nothing but death amen i will make
[55:25] war upon you with the sword of
[55:28] my mouth amen you remember how
[55:32] the mystery babylon beast
[55:35] make war with the saints now god is
[55:38] saying
[55:40] you're not in war with my people
[55:43] but i'll make war with you with the word
[55:46] of god
[55:47] with the revelation of the holy spirit
[55:50] we're gonna cut you to pieces with the
[55:53] revelation
[55:54] of the word of the living god
[55:57] amen and one day those who are now
[56:01] fighting this message this word
[56:04] amen will find the very word they claim
[56:07] to believe
[56:08] begins fighting against them because god
[56:11] will enable us to take the very
[56:13] word which they claim to believe and
[56:17] show them where they have gone
[56:20] off the path they are far away from the
[56:23] truth
[56:23] and they fail to recognize who they are
[56:27] amen hallelujah amen repent
[56:32] how sweet are the thoughts of a true
[56:35] believer
[56:36] when they hear words of repentance
[56:40] that we can come to god and say lord
[56:43] nothing in my hands i bring
[56:47] i have no graven idols i have no
[56:51] no cross with a big chain on my neck
[56:55] to say that is my holiness
[56:58] i have no incense my
[57:01] my real incense is my prayers rising up
[57:05] before you
[57:06] oh my god nothing in my hands i bring
[57:10] but simply to the cross i cling
[57:13] o god just a sorrow for my sin lord
[57:17] i repent i am o
[57:20] god what i am and the things that i may
[57:24] have done
[57:25] all wasted years lord wasted years oh
[57:29] how foolish
[57:30] as i marched on in darkness and fear
[57:34] now lord i want to turn around i want to
[57:37] turn around
[57:38] for i hear your voice calling it's
[57:41] calling me
