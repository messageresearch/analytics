[music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] Heat. Heat. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Praise God. [music] Let's give God an applause. Um, we're going to be reading from Psalm 37, but just like 16 verses, [music] not all of them. And I would like to do it a little more interactive today. So when I speak the first [music] verse, you read the second verse until on the 16th. We all read it together. Amen. Okay. Psalm 637 verse one. Fret not [music] thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious [music] against the workers of iniquity. The congregation read the next verse. &gt;&gt; Trust in the Lord and do good. So shalt thou dwell [music] in the land and very thou shalt be fed. Commit thy way unto the Lord. Trust also in him, and it shall bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; Rest in the Lord and wait patiently for him. Fred not thyself because [music] of him who prospered in his way. Because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. &gt;&gt; For evildoers shall be cut off, but those that wait upon the Lord, [music] they shall inherit the earth. [music] But the meek shall inherit the earth and all and shall delight themselves in [music] the abundance of peace. The Lord shall laugh at him for he said that his day [music] is coming. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Their sword shall enter into their own [music] heart and their bows shall be broken. Let's all read the last one to be verse 16. A little that a righteous man heart is better than riches of the [music] many wicked. Amen. Enjoy the rest of the service. God bless you all, brother Anthony. See [music] tribute of God. [music] My skin [singing] with him. &gt;&gt; He hides beneath my skin.

[music] Oh father, we thank you Lord that we can gather [music] this morning by your grace. Grace [music] called us. Grace placed us. Grace is perfecting us in this hour. Amazing grace, oh God. How sweet the sound, Lord. &gt;&gt; The message of grace, oh God. And we understand [music] that your prophet said that grace gives us the ability to do your will, Father. Lord, we're here this morning, Lord, to do your will, Father. Lord, and your will is your word, Lord. Let the word have [music] preeminence, Lord, this morning, Father. Lord, we come in here with a week [music] of trials, a week of temptation, a week of being tested, Lord. A week of ups and downs, a week of making mistakes, Lord, doing things that maybe are not right, Father. But Lord, we come this morning, Father, through the blood of Jesus Christ. Lord, you said if we come through the b the blood boldly, we can enter your throne this morning, Lord, and ask what we have need of, Lord. Lord, you said seek the kingdom of God first and his righteousness, and all things shall be added unto us, oh God. Lord, we're not here to seek for things of this world, Lord. Father, we we have given a promise by you, Lord. That Lord, even you when you were here on earth, you said you have little faith. You [music] can't believe for the natural things. How you going to believe for the spiritual things, Lord? We know you're going to take care of our bodies, Lord. Lord, that that the healing is the children's bread, Lord. If we need healing, it's in the camp this morning. If we need deliverance, it's in the camp this morning. &gt;&gt; Oh God, because you're in the camp this morning, Father, Lord, we need a devil cast out, it's in the camp this morning. Because where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty this morning, Father. Lord, have your way this morning. It's not about us. It's not about gifts. It's not about positions, oh God, and who we think we are. It's about you this morning. Father, come in our midst, oh God, and and stir the waters, Lord. May that mighty angel come and stir our hearts this morning, and stir the waters. Stir the atmosphere, Father. [music] Oh God, bind every demon power that would come of unbelief in here this morning, Lord. This is where the sons and daughters of God have liberty this morning. and celebrate our Lord Jesus Christ. Oh God, in the word that will come forth this morning, Lord, that's why we worship, Lord. That's why we praise you, Lord, is because we know a word is coming forth this morning that's going to change us and set us at liberty because you have promised when I sent forth my word, hallelujah, I'll heal the land. I'll heal the people. My words are spirit and life. I'll give life this morning. And that's what your bride wants this morning. Is the very life of God, the token this morning to manifest in her life. More and more of you, Father. Bless each and every one. Lord, oh God, bless them this morning. It's not just saying bless them, but bless them Lord God that they may enter in Lord that they may let go and let God have his way in their hearts this morning. That they may open up their hearts and be like Mary. Be it unto me according to thy word, according to thy spirit and thy working in this morning, oh God. And as your word would come forth, Father, oh God, set the man at liberty. The man is not just a man. The man of God this morning at liberty. Lord, just speak your word, Father. Put a wall of fire and a hedge around him from the fiery darts of the enemy. Lord, shield them and protect them, Lord, that that word may come forth this morning. And Lord, bless us. It's not only the song leader and the musicians this morning, but it's all of us together. Bless the worship this morning, Lord. Set us at liberty, Lord. Lord, rebuke every nonpraising demon, oh God. Lord, and let us recognize this morning, Lord God, what you have done for us, Lord. You have set us free this morning. We are the freest people on the earth. We are the happiest people on the earth.

You just have to look around and you can see that the world is [music] changing so rapidly and things are declining in so many ways, you know, morally and and [music] politically and spiritually. And my God, we we you know what, we're blessed. We are we are in a in a a a [music] place of of uh just um you know heavenly places in Christ Jesus. [music] Everything is possible.

And so we've come here today because we want to feed on the word of God, including me. Amen. I'm here this morning just as excited about the word of God as you are. I trust you're excited about feeding on the word. Amen. Because that is our strength. Oh, praise God. Good to see you, brother. Hey, Sister Kim. [laughter] Amen. Praise God. Good to have uh all the visitors here in the house of the Lord. Amen. So, let's go to the word of God. Praise God. We've been on a series here on um you know the purpose of God and we you know we've been kind of just progressing along and we got into called unto adoption and I believe this is the age of adoption for us. Amen. For the sons of God in this hour under this message of the hour God's going to have uh attribute sons and daughters that are going to come into their fullness. Amen. To recognize the portion of the word that they are. Amen. Praise God. And last week we were looking at obtaining our inheritance as adopted sons. Listen, if you've got if if you if you're a son in whatever family or daughter in whatever family your mom and dad, you know, they're leaving you an inheritance, but you need to you need to make sure your name's on the will. &gt;&gt; Amen. You need to know that your name's on the will and that you know that you're actually going to obtain an inheritance. Amen. So when the when the lawyer when the Holy Ghost starts to call the names in this last day, you want to know that that's me. Hallelujah. I'm present. Amen. I've heard my name. Glory to God. Amen. So we want to we want to just continue where we left off last week. Um and we'll just uh title this obtaining our inheritance part two. Amen. Praise God. And so um let's go to our scripture from Ephesians. Um the same scripture says here in Ephesians chapter 1 verse 9 to11. Let's ask the Lord to bless the word. Father, as we approach you now through the word of God, we're asking your anointing to come and possess speaker and hearers, Lord, that we may together in heavenly places hear exactly what you have that you you're going to open to us the understanding of this day, the the present truth to be established in the present truth. Father, this is our desire this morning. Come speak to us, hear through us. Lord, have your way and let us go rejoicing today, Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, we give you glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; It says here in Ephesians 1:es 9-11, having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in himself. Amen. that in the dispensation of the fullness of times, which I believe that we're in that time right now, he might gather together in one all things, both which are in heaven and which are on earth, even in him, in whom also we have obtained an inheritance. Amen. Praise God. It's already available to us. We just need to recognize who we are so that we can receive it. Amen. Being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his own will. &gt;&gt; Praise God. You may be seated. Amen. Praise God. I believe we're living in the fullness of time, saints. I believe there'll be a people that'll recognize the progression of the word of God for their day. Realize that there's a word that was ordained in this day and in this hour. We've heard brother Brandham say it many times that there was a specific word that you were to come into and that you would actually be the manifestation of that particular word in that particular season. And by you recognizing that brings you into a position and into a revelation of perfect faith &gt;&gt; to see yourself in the word of God. Amen. And there's nothing greater than that, saints, that we could recognize that we are in the word and that we are a part of the will of God. Amen. Because it says here that that it's that that that everything was predestinated according to the purpose of him. who workketh all things according to the counsel of his own &gt;&gt; will &gt;&gt; the will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a will. &gt;&gt; There's a purpose in God. &gt;&gt; There's an inheritance within that will and purpose of God that that that's ordained for you specifically. You didn't know it. &gt;&gt; You didn't know it. You didn't realize it. you were just living your life here on this earth and you thought that well you know I hope my mom and dad are going to leave me an inheritance and I you know I'm hoping that you know like because it's getting tough out there it's getting tough to get by you know young people these days they can't even buy a house you know the majority of them can't buy a house because it's gotten so out of out of you know ridiculous and you know they're relying on their parents amen they're relying they're trusting that their parents are going to do it and some don't have parents and And then they find that their lives are in chaos. They find that things just aren't, you know, the ends aren't aren't aren't quite meeting. And at the end of the month, there's just not enough money. And so they get into situations and families start to break up. You know that, you know, families break up. Husbands and wives, you know, one of the major causes financial &gt;&gt; Amen. It's because the wife or the husband is not satisfied with, you know, I thought her parents were going to leave us lots of money. Hallelujah. You know, I thought his parents were going to leave us money and they're just off on their vacations and they're spending all their money and there's no inheritance. Well, listen. This is you. You thought this was your life &gt;&gt; and then you heard the word of God &gt;&gt; and that you were a son of God and that God had a had an inheritance for you. &gt;&gt; An inheritance that not Paul he says eyes have not seen, ears have not heard, nor has it even entered into the heart of man. What God has in store for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And and that just changes everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why you're here this morning. You know that &gt;&gt; you're not here for just to be a church member, are you? &gt;&gt; You want to hear your name being called &gt;&gt; in the will of God. Amen. Praise God. So that you can know that there's a lot more that your future is actually clear. &gt;&gt; It's not full of heartache and and pain and sorrow. Amen. &gt;&gt; What a wonderful glorious victory we have. And so last week, just a quick review. I'll just go through, you know, you can flip over to the next slide here. We read from Joshua 1 verse 1-6. It says, "Now after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua, the son of Nun. Moses, minister, saying, Moses, my servant, is dead. Now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou and all this people unto the land which I give to them, even to the children of Israel. Every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given to you, as I said unto Brother Brham. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Everything that God told the prophet is for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Behold, I send unto you. Elijah the prophet. Amen. And all the promises that God made to Moses, which is in our day was brother Brham, pertain to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. But Moses is dead. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham is dead. Amen. He's like dead, you know, in the understanding of this world. But you know where he is. &gt;&gt; Exactly where he went when he was here before when he went beyond the curtain of time and he saw the sons and daughters of God in their theophony bodies. Amen. &gt;&gt; Young. He's having a He's having a good time. Don't worry about them. They've they've done their part. Listen, Brother Brandham did his part. Amen. Now we've got a part. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We need to recognize that this is a different commission. This is a new dispensation. This is the hour where the bride comes into her rightful position. She becomes the voice. Amen. Hallelujah. Glory to God. And so we were looking at that and you know and and he you know we read from Joshua 1:9. Have I not commanded thee? For the Lord thy God is with thee wherever thou goest. &gt;&gt; You need to know that it's God that's with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. You don't need to be packing the tapes with you. &gt;&gt; You need to know that he's with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You want to listen to the tapes. You want to feed on the prophet's messages. You want to go back and I I feed on him every single day. If you don't recognize that God sent a prophet, you can't even you can't even come into what we're going to go into today. &gt;&gt; We're entering in to to the word for this hour. the mighty angel that came down to bring a message and to to open a book and to start calling the names of the sons and daughters of God in this hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we're interested in. He said here, he says, "Go in and possess the land. &gt;&gt; Whatever." Listen, I don't know what your situation God designed you, built you, and and and brought you into this world designed for to meet the challenges of this day. He's made you and I different. &gt;&gt; But one thing he has given us is the land that that that he's given you. You need to possess it. Your home, your family, your finance, your health, &gt;&gt; your your your your happiness. Amen. That's something that you're going to need to possess. You're going to need to make some decisions in your life. You're going to need to overcome. Come on now. Amen. To him that overcomes will I allow to sit with me in the throne. Amen. Praise God. To be with him. Glory to God. So he's given you that. He's saying possess it. &gt;&gt; Don't you look to the left. Don't you look to the right. I'm putting you in the in the new land of the message of this hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; A lot of people, they want to stay on the other side. &gt;&gt; They want to stay with Moses, but Moses is dead. But they want to go back there and all they want to do is quote Moses. They just want mo No. No. Moses did this and Moses did that and Moses did this. That's not enough. This is not that dispensation. This is the dispensation where he says you &gt;&gt; you you you go in and possess your own land. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. And so now you are you are in the land. We're in the message of the hour. Amen. We're we're feasting on the message of the hour. This is this is what we've entered into. This is what has, you know, placed fire within our souls because we've received the new birth. &gt;&gt; There's, you know, we talked about this a few weeks ago that that the Holy Ghost in this hour &gt;&gt; is the new birth. The Holy Ghost, Christ himself coming into you, it it awakens you to the revealed word for right now. Every dispensation had a portion &gt;&gt; of the spirit of God, &gt;&gt; but this is the only dispensation where the Holy Ghost brings us into the full adoption, &gt;&gt; the full revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; To manifest God again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the fullness of the word. Amen. Praise God. This is that hour. And so, you know, here he goes on and uh so we know that we need to we need to take our land. You know, we need to take responsibility. God wants us to come into maturity of our own free moral agency. We're not clones. We're not, you know, this church is not designed in a way where there's a dictator at the front that comes up and says, "This is how you do it. This is what you need to do. You get rid of this. You get rid of that. you stop doing this. You No, no, no, no, no. That's not that's not the church that that that we belong to. This is not this is not the body of Christ. This this is the body of Christ. Amen. It's not that kind of law and you know you got to do no. The law listen the law had its time. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's grace now that has come into your life &gt;&gt; by free moral agency. God's looking for character. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's looking for you to take responsibility and make the right decisions on your own. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Listen, adoption gives you an inheritance, but with that inheritance comes responsibility. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, go to the next quote here. This is still just quick review. We'll be done in a minute. Listen. In thou son of David, have mercy on me. He says here, God told them way down in Egypt before they came to the prices, I give you that land. But he didn't say, "I'm going to go in there and sweep it all out and garnish the houses and hang up the curtains and everything. You You just You all just move in." No, no, no, no. They had to fight for every inch of ground they took. That's right. Fighting and take it by every fight, every inch. But he said everywhere the souls of your foot land, that's possession. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Footsteps is possession. &gt;&gt; You walk with God. &gt;&gt; As you walk with God in this message under the revealed word for this day, it becomes possession. &gt;&gt; You are a son of God. I possess my healing. I possess my finance. I possess rel relationships with my family. I possess my my my because you're walking with God. &gt;&gt; He said, I'm going to be with you. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be with you. He's going to listen. Let's go on here. He goes on here. He says, "Now remember Moses had given them all the instructions how to possess the land, how to plant the land, how to rest the land. All of these things, these are instructions that you as as grown sons and daughters of God, you should know now and take responsibility for decisionmaking, for actions that you make. Amen. But as long as the children of Israel did exactly what what what the word was telling them to do and he said, "I'll be with you." You you you you just got to just keep walking. &gt;&gt; You just keep walking. God comes and does the rest. The Lord said only be courageous. You got to be courageous to live this message to stand on this word for this day amongst your friends and your family and your co-workers. You got to be courageous to stand and believe God under the circumstances and show that you really do believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Amen. And as long as you know, but let's listen. Uh, as long as we don't trust God, then you're going to see situations fall around you. Amen. You got to stay with the word. You got to stay with the what what he's he's given us as long as we obey and we recognize the word for our day. God, his spirit just continues to move around our life because we're walking with him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Perfect examples. So here now, God God was fighting right alongside Israel as long as they stayed with Joshua's instruction. Amen. Under the five-fold ministry. Remember, this is the hour where the five-fold ministry is the voice of God to give you instruction on how to overcome and how to deal with the situations in your life so that you can walk into your adoption as a son of God. Amen. Praise God. Stop saying, "Lord, you do this. Lord, you do that." It's time that you start to understand that the that the voice is now in you. God's given you responsibility. Time for you to step out and walk on your own. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah. In Joshua, go to the next slide here. In Joshua 10:11 it says, "And it came to pass as they fled from before Israel and were in the going down to Bethon that the Lord cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Ahesca, and they died. They were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword." God was showing that he was with them. and and there was situations that they couldn't handle on their own. But that's okay. Don't you worry about those situations. You just keep walking with God because God's got his word. He's got stones coming down dealing with all those situations. Amen. We got to keep pressing on. Amen. Next slide. And still under the review. Then spake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel and said in the sight of Israel, "Son, stand still upon Gibian and thou moon in the valley of Agelon." And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Listen, you come into some tough situations in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's there's no question you're going to you're you're going to some of you are facing some right now. Some of the the greatest challenges that you've that you'll ever face. But it's at that time that if there's faith in your heart, &gt;&gt; you're going to you're you're going to speak you're you're not going to speak the doctor's report. &gt;&gt; You're you're you're going to speak the word report. I am the Lord God that health thee. I am the Lord God that that that comforts thee. I am your peace. I am your rest. I am Jehovah Gyra that provideth all of your needs. Amen. This is what's going to speak out of your mouth. And those circumstances in your life, they got to stand still. &gt;&gt; They got to come under the obedience of the word of God that's in you. Amen. Because now now you know who you are. Amen. You've recognized your calling, your position. Amen. And look, and it says here that and there was no day like that before it or after it that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man. God desires for you to know that he that his desire is to possess man. you as a as a a a a broken individual, somebody that's come out from all kinds of generational situations and circumstances and and and bad experiences and all kinds of listen all kinds of situations. We could we could give God a thousand excuses why why would you choose me? But he chose you because he saw you before the foundations of the world. &gt;&gt; That you would accept his word. &gt;&gt; That you would say, "I believe it. &gt;&gt; I believe the word of God can do these things. I believe that you're my healer. I believe that you're my provider." &gt;&gt; So because of that, he now he now indwells in man. He's that that was his great desire. Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. And so, so the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man. If he did it back then, he'll do it again. &gt;&gt; This is the hour where he's doing it again. Amen. This is where the sons of God come into full adoption with character. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so Joshua had a purpose in his heart. He had something he needed to accomplish. You've got a purpose that's been placed in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. You listen. If you've come under the revelation of this hour, your purpose is to manifest Christ in your life in word form. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not going to be a a a parrot. You're not going to be a like, you know, a a a clone. &gt;&gt; Come on now. This listen this this word that that that that you've received in this hour. It you know you're different. &gt;&gt; You know you can't mix when you're hearing certain things. You know you it doesn't take long. You you know you you can tell you've got that you've got that eagle hearing. You've got that that eagle vision. You've got that ability to hear the word of God when it's being preached in its season. You know the difference when God is speaking. God is speaking in the present truth &gt;&gt; under the present revelation. Amen. It changes you completely. And then and then that's what gives you the ability to stand and and and and know that he's God. &gt;&gt; Not to be pulled into some doctrine or some teaching or some some two soul doctrine or some return ministry doctrine or or a or or a a another prophet ministry. No, no, no, no, no. that the word in you is the attribute that God placed before the foundations of the world for this age. And you can only respond to him. &gt;&gt; You're not going to respond. You're not even going to respond to the tapes anymore. &gt;&gt; You're going to be you're going to hear the word. You're going to recognize that it's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. But you're going to be looking for fresh mana. You're going to be coming under the the you're going to realize that there's things that are coming to you through the five-fold ministry that was not available. &gt;&gt; It why? Because it's being revealed now. &gt;&gt; It wasn't for then. It was for now. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to look at some of this as we move along here. And so, this is where we left off last week. And so, let's move on now. Okay. Let's go to the next scripture as we look into part two. It says here in uh Judges 1 18 to1 19. It says also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof and Ascalon with the coast thereof and Echron with the coast thereof. Now this is where the children of Israel have been been gone into the promised land. And now Joshua has given and separated unto them all their portions to possess. Right? So here they are. or they're going in. But pay attention. And the Lord was with Judah. Amen. And he drove out he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain, but notice he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had chariots of iron. All of a sudden, they were displaying certain elements of warfare &gt;&gt; that seemed to be a little more, you know, it just more powerful. You know, things can sound, you know, all of a sudden you start to hear certain, you know, messages coming from different churches and different individuals bringing out, you know, portions of the word and it sounds powerful. It sounds strong. It sounds like, wow, this is this is something that, you know, I got I I get pulled by that. And you know, those that that are weak, they're going to they're going to come under they're going to come under that power. Amen. They're going to think, "Oh, this is this has got to be God because this is this is more powerful. Look at the ministry. It's getting bigger. It's a powerful ministry. It's, you know, a lot of people are talking about it." No, no, no, no, no. God said, "Your land, possess your land, the portion of the word that you are." I thank God for a for a pastor who over the years just stayed with the word that was revealed to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't get pulled to the left or to the right. He just stayed with the word because he knew that if the word would get laid into the hearts of the people, the word would discern the error. the word would would bring everything clear and and they would just continue to follow the word. Amen. But you see the the the chariots seemed like they were too powerful for the people and that and they couldn't overcome. Look, look at Gaza today. You know, we see, you know, Israel is a type of the bride and we see what's taken place. Is this the same Gaza, the coastline that they were talking about thousands of years ago that that that that Israel was to possess? That's part of their possession. Amen. Praise God. But look at look at them today. Thousands of years later, Israel let the enemy come in under the pressure of the other world nations out of all the other pressures of the different churches, the different You got to see the types now. I hope you got your spiritual understanding on. Amen. that you know all of a sudden all these things start to creep into the message. All of a sudden they start looking left, they start looking right. Before you know it, the enemy, he's come into your home. he's placed himself in there in the way of a track or or all of a sudden, you know, you you're not following your pastor anymore, you know, because you like what you're hearing over there and all of a sudden, you know, it's because you're not solidly staying in the possession that he gave you. Amen. But you're but you're you're you're wandering. You're looking to the left. You're looking to the right. Amen. But God don't want you to do that. God wants you to see exactly what he's given you. Amen. And what happened? Israel, all of a sudden, the enemy starts building tunnels under Gaza. They start, you know, infiltrating. All of a sudden, one pops up here. Before you know it, a huge attack. Do you think that the timing of all of this is just by chance? &gt;&gt; What did Brother Brandham say? says, "You want to know what time it is? &gt;&gt; Watch Israel. &gt;&gt; Look what's been happening in Israel and look and see what's happening within the land of this message. &gt;&gt; And see what it is that's trying to infiltrate you as a son or a daughter of God." Amen. Why? Because you you you got a little bit distracted by the chariots. Amen. Praise God. Look, he says, you know, just from my notes here, the last two years, we've seen another turn, another dispensational change even within the message. Now, I'm not trying to bring a new doctrine here. Don't don't. This is called the progression of the revelation of the mighty God who has come down to manifest the sons of God. And when I say sons, I mean daughters also into into their rightful adopted position as the full sons and daughters of God for a purpose so that they can get their inheritance. A lot of people put an inheritance as, oh well, God's going to, you know, bless me here. He's going to give me houses. He's going to give me lands. Yes, he's he'll do all of that. If you're a faithful steward of the money that he gives you, if you've got a revelation that that it's him that gives you 100% of the funds that you get into your bank account, &gt;&gt; and then you get a revelation that that like Abraham, he he paid a tithe unto the Lord. He all all I got to give back is 10%. You're going to give me a 100 and all I got to do is give you 10, Lord. You can give me as much 100% as you want. Hallelujah. You see, God can bless you with a 100 or 100 million. &gt;&gt; It's all based on the faith that God has placed in you in the portion of the word, in the dispensation of the attribute that you are. You've got to realize that God didn't it's not by chance that God will bless and prosper and use certain individuals to to to be used to bring finance into the body of Christ. Amen. If you if you catch that revelation, you you you and it becomes a reality to you like it did to me. I got to tell you, when when it when it became a reality to me years ago, I I said, "Oh, God, thank you, Lord. I I want to give you more. I I want I want more because you you've attached a promise to this. You've you've attached a promise to this and so I can and so if that promise is for me then Lord let me be that channel. Let me be Do you desire that this morning? &gt;&gt; You can be that kind of a channel. Listen, there is no reason for any son or daughter of God to be living under privileged. &gt;&gt; Not one. &gt;&gt; No sir. It's for you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Prosperity. God says that I would that you would prosper. &gt;&gt; He wants you to prosper. To get that poverty demon out of your mind. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't let the enemy tell you, "Yeah, but it's for him, but it's not for you." No, no, no. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; What he promised for him is for me. Amen. Yes, sir. So understanding that places you into a place where you can you you can be used of God and understand that this dispensational change, this awakening within the bride is just the progression of the word to bring sons into full adoption. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people that don't even understand the adoption. They don't understand the sunship. They think it's just to be, you know, become a deacon in the church or to become a pastor or a preacher that God's going to give them a higher authority. I'm telling you that the housewife has just as much authority as a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. To speak the word, to to lay hands on the sick, to to to teach their children the word of God. Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. Every listen, every position is anointed with a portion of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so here, let's go to the next scripture here. He says, but you just need to understand that you're not to make any tribute with the enemy. Don't let that those chariots and and and those bluffs, you know, come in and and you know, things start to creep into your life. Amen. And you you know the things that you used to kick out, you're letting them back in. Watch it now. Amen. Neither did Manasseh drive out listen the inhabitants of Bethshene and her towns, nor Tanak and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Door and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Elimin and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Medigol and her towns. But the Canaanites would dwell in that land. And it came to pass when Israel was strong. Oh, you mean you can get to a place where you're starting to feel really good. You're starting to feel strong. You're starting to think that you I've got the message of the hour. I'm I I'm I'm placed in the church. I've got a position in the church. Be careful now that they put the Canaanites to tribute that all of a sudden you start to allow little things. Oh, well, brother, you know, a brother comes into the church or a sister comes into the church and they got a bit of a gossip thing. All of a sudden, they start to, you know, talk about this person talk. Oh, did you hear what this one said? Did you hear what that one said? All of a sudden, they're spending more time together. All of a sudden, they don't realize they've let they've led a Canaanite into the village. &gt;&gt; Oh, boy. Amen. Would dwell in that land. And it came to pass when Israel was strong that they put the Canaanites to tribute and did not utterly drive them out. What does that mean? that that all of a sudden they would allow them to stay in their home, stay in their church, stay in in around the brethren as long as they stayed, you know, under subjection to the church and they would show up and they would, you know, pay even pay their tithes. Oh, yeah. Even pay their tithes and, you know, make some offerings and so forth. But they were off the word. They were they were telling them certain things that that were were were bringing them into another direction. All of a sudden they started to, you know, make tribute. That means that you're you're you're you're agreeing that as long listen just don't bother me too much. You think the devil's he's smart. He won't bother you in your house while you're doing all those things that you know you shouldn't be doing, living a double life. and he'll stay there and he won't cause any trouble as long as you know he stays quiet and you just No, no, no. Before you know it, trouble in the land. Amen. And it came to pass, he says, "And and they paid tribute and did not drive them out. Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Jazir, but the Canaanites dwelt in Jazir among them. Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nah, but the Canaanites dwelt among them and became tributaries. We start to, you know, listen, you start out and you're real strong. You come out, you know, you're a real warrior for God and then all of a sudden you start to let the things back in that you had kicked out. But when the Lord made his promise to you that that you would possess the land, he didn't say it would happen overnight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "You got to possess the land. Know that I'll be with you. You need to be courageous." Why do you need to be courageous? Because you got to fight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to stand up against situations that are going to come into your home, into your church, into your life, disease come into your body. You've got to stand. Oh, the doctor says it's a common thing. It's, you know, but but uh you know, this is what it's going to cause. And you know, it's like those commercials that you hear. Oh, take you seen, you know, and then at the end it tells you you could die. You could have heart attack. You could have dementia. You could be, you know, as you know, all these things. And and this is all the lies of the enemy just to try to get in. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't drop the bar. keep possessing the land. &gt;&gt; That's what God is looking for. He's looking for sons to come into their to their maturity where they know they got a part to do. &gt;&gt; You're not going to, oh God, do this, God do that. No, Siri, listen here. He says, go on. Let's look at the next scripture here. He says, "So many says, if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or gambling or from lying or stealing, I'll serve him." But that's up to you. What? &gt;&gt; Up to you. See, he says you you got to do something, too. &gt;&gt; They they that overcome shall inherit all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. They that overcome. You have power to do it. But you must be willing to lay it down. &gt;&gt; You got to lay down your pride. You got to lay down your You got to put up with the reproach. You got to lay it down. He says he says, "Listen, look, look." He says, "She has made herself ready." &gt;&gt; What do you mean she has made herself ready? everybody, you know, you you hear that, but you don't want to put the action behind that. You've got a responsibility. You've got a part to do in all of this. I like that word. You see, God could not push us through a little pipe, pull us through on the other end, and then say, "Blessed is he that overcomemeth." What did you overcome? God pushed you from one end to the other. There comes a point where as a son or a daughter that comes into maturity, you know what to do with the word. &gt;&gt; You know what God requires of you. You've got free moral agency. That's the kind of son that he wants to put into authority. Amen. Glory to God. Blessed is he that overcomemeth. He had nothing to overcome. He just pushed you through. But you've got to make decisions for yourself. &gt;&gt; I had to make decisions for myself. I'm doing that. We show our revelation, our faith, and respect unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Wow. Praise God. &gt;&gt; You mean you got something to do with this? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; What do you think? You just come here every Sunday and every Wednesday and just open your plate and, you know, you sitting there with your knife and your fork. Oh, that's a good piece. I'll eat that. No, I don't like that one. No, no, no, no, no. This is where the warriors, the sons of God are coming to hear from the mighty angel where they're receiving instruction from the father. The father is tutoring. The father is instructing. The the father is giving us everything that we have need of every promise in the book. It's yours. &gt;&gt; And you and you've got to take it and you've got to apply it. And you've got to overcome and you've got to pull your sword every now and then and deal with situations and know that you will possess &gt;&gt; because he said you would possess. He didn't say you might possess. He didn't put a condition on it. The only condition was that don't let down the bar. Don't let those those uh squatters into the land. Recognize them. Kick them out. Amen. Glory to God. Listen, go to the next scripture here in Judges. He says, "And an angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Boim and said, I I made you to go out of Egypt." Now he's coming to rebuke this Israel, and have brought you unto the land which I swear unto your fathers, and I said, I will never break my covenant with you. Amen. And ye shall make no league with no league with the inhabitants of this land. Ye shall throw down their altars, but ye have not obeyed my voice. Oh my goodness, why have you done this? Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out before you, but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their god shall be a snare unto you. There's a lot of people that are in this condition, &gt;&gt; but there's hope. &gt;&gt; That's why he sends his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He sends the word in the hour that it's needed. &gt;&gt; That's why present truth, it's it's a lamp unto your feet. You don't have to remain in this condition. You listen, you may God was was was was instructing you and you you were just kind of like letting the voice kind of fade out. You know, you go to sleep, you wake up the next morning and you figure maybe that voice is not going to be there, but it's still there. Amen. He's saying you you you just need you just need to come back to the word. You need to come out of your slumber. You need to come out of your condition. You're a son of God. You're not you're not to remain under that situation. Amen. Glory to God. He says here, he says, "Listen, God sent the children of Israel and the angel to rebuke them for not listening. But look, if there was any sin in your life that you've made tribute with, it's time to drive it out. &gt;&gt; That's why he came. That's why the word comes. It comes so that you can hearken under the word and God shows you certain things and then you drive them out. &gt;&gt; All of a sudden now you start to possess your land. You start to show your sunship as a as a an adopted son of God. Amen. The end time sons of God. We are the ones who will overcome and will have the victory over every enemy that stands before you. Every single enemy that stands before you, God has given you victory over it &gt;&gt; because of the attribute that you are &gt;&gt; next slide. Amen. Jud in Judges 17. Now watch. He comes here and he says, "And the children of Joseph said, now they're still complaining, right? You know, this is the hour." says, "The hill is not enough for us, and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron." Here, here it is again. Bring it up. They got this doctrine. They got this teaching. They've got they've got the people following them. But look, bo both they who are of Bethan and her towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezrael. And now watch what Joshua and this is him now speaking to you, speaking to me, because this is the five-fold ministry. Joshua represents the Ephesian church. Amen. Those that are going to come under the headship of Joshua in this day and in this hour because God knew that many would fall into these conditions. God knew that some would get caught under certain doctrines or certain aspects and influences. Amen. But he comes here and he says and speak unto the house of Joseph even to Ephraim and to Manasseh. Amen. who are the gentile children of Joseph's wife who was a gentile. Amen. Come to the Gentiles. Amen. Just all little types. Saying, "Thou art a great people and has great power. Thou shalt not have one lot only." In other words, don't you think that this is all that you get and and say, "Okay, I'm going to let these ones take over. this one's gonna stay in the land. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You're not gonna stay in that condition. He says, "But the mountain shall be yours." &gt;&gt; For it is a wood, and thou shalt cut it down. It's not something that's built upon anything solid. It's not the eternal word of God. It's the wood. It's teachings of man. It has a beginning. It'll have an end. It'll get cut down just as quick as it gets put up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. And the outgoings of it shall be thine, and thou shalt drive out the Canaan, the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though they be strong. Glory. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's who you are. &gt;&gt; That's who God is telling us and reminding us of who we are in this hour. Amen. Praise God. They needed to come to a time where the sons of God by the Joshua commission would remind them. Church, we're being reminded of who we are. &gt;&gt; We're being reminded that we're in the adoption stage. We're being reminded that the tutors are no longer required. That the Holy Ghost himself is coming to possess and and indwell you and take control of your life and show that you are a son of God with with authority. Amen. Glory to God. Look, the Holy Ghost is reminding us that we are a great people. That this word will will never change. His word will never change. Amen. Why did we start to doubt? Have we allowed the things that we drove out to come back in? The things that the world, you know, tries to throw upon us, all kinds of different things of the world, entertainment and, you know, like, you know, getting us, you know, people go on vacations these days. They don't want to go for a week. They want to go for months. They don't they don't understand there, you know, like uh you know vacations from what? Vacations from God. You don't take vacations from God. Okay. Sure, God wants you to go for rest. God wants you to take vacations, but God wants you under the the the leadership of the word for the day and the hour under your captain so that you can receive instruction to overcome because things start to creep in if you don't kick them out and if you don't stay fortified by the word of God. Amen. Glory to God. We have a responsibility to manifest the sons of God with confidence. Amen. Look, let's go to the next scripture here. This is where it starts getting sweet. You know, now we're going to start to hear about who we are and what God's given us and to know that we don't have to stay in certain conditions. Amen. In Romans 8 14 to18, for as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear. Come on. &gt;&gt; We got to we got to stand up. We got to understand that that fear cannot control our lives. Too many people they fear of this, fear of that. Oh, well, if I say this or if I do that. No. Know who you are. Step into your position as a son of God. Don't be afraid of the enemy that's going to try to knock you down, try to, you know, mock you and oh, you know, you you you believe you believe this. You believe that church, you believe what that church is teaching. No, no, you can turn around and say, "No, no, I believe God. &gt;&gt; I believe the word of God." The word has become a reality. Listen, listen. What what happens here? He says, "But ye have received the spirit of adoption." Now, that's a totally different spirit altogether, saints. That's the Holy Ghost coming into your life. Amen. Now, it's not you that has to overcome so much, but the spirit that's in you gives you the ability to make decisions to overcome. &gt;&gt; It gives you the confidence of God. Watch. Whereby we cry, "Aba." You know what aba means? Father. &gt;&gt; That's what aba means. Aba, father. We have a relationship. How can you say aba? The only way you can say aba is if you're a son. The only way my son can call me dad is because I'm his father. He came from my genes. Amen. Glory to God. This is what God is trying to tell you. And look, he goes on. He says, "The spirit itself be witness with our spirit that we are children of God." Amen. This is about the manifestation of the sons of God coming into their adoptive positions. Amen. And if children, then heirs. Remember, we are heirs to an inheritance. &gt;&gt; Heirs of what? Heirs of God and joint hes with Christ. &gt;&gt; Meaning that if you're a joint heir, listen, if my brother and my sister are present, when I go and sit before the the the the the lawyer and my parents, who I know they're just, &gt;&gt; oh yeah, we serve a just God, saints. He's He's going to give my sister, my brother, and me equally our inheritance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So, we are now joint hes meaning with Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes. With Christ. Christ is the first fruits. Christ. Listen, you got you got to realize that even when Christ came, he came as a man. He came to to show that he could be a man in a human vessel and he could overcome the flesh. &gt;&gt; He could make a way for the sons of God and the daughters of God to receive their inheritance. As long as Jesus was on the earth as a man and without giving up the ghost, we would have never received any inheritance. There would have been no inheritance. &gt;&gt; He says, "I go to prepare a place for you." A place. People think that it's just a shiny road somewhere with this big, you know, a mansion, right? We heard that, you know, he goes to prepare a mansion. Do you realize what that mansion is? Let's keep going. And if children, then hes of God and jointairs with Christ. If so be that we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified together. For I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's something that he's deposited in you and me that's going to be manifested as a result of all the testing, all the trying, all the overcoming, all the things that you had to deal with under your adoptive stage, under the tutors of being trained to to to become sons of God so that you could receive your inheritance. Amen. What does this scripture really mean to you? The spirit of adoption. You have received a revelation of your father. &gt;&gt; That's what it's saying. That you now realize that you are a son. &gt;&gt; You're not just a child, a Christian. What? To go to church every Sunday and you know twice a week or you know just to to be a church member to say, "Oh, Jesus saved us." That's the message that all the churches out there are proclaiming. &gt;&gt; I mean, it's a great message. It's the truth. But what's it doing to transform your life and put you into the rapture? &gt;&gt; The message of the hour is got it's got to produce sons of God &gt;&gt; that are actually going to go into a body change experience where they are going to be translated into another dimension. &gt;&gt; This is the word for the hour. This is what Christianity is supposed to be producing. Not church members. Not just being a Christian and say, "Oh, I'm a Christian." It's not about just saying, "I'm a Christian." It's about saying, "I am a son of God. &gt;&gt; I have recognized something." Hallelujah. Glory to God. I've I've I've I've recognized that I've got a father. I've got a real father that's that that that that's a supernatural God. Amen. And he he says, "I want to dwell with you. I want to be in you." This was his desire right from the very beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. The purpose of the Holy Ghost is to get you to maturity and then make you then and then make your so that you can make your own decisions, take responsibility for your own actions. When you make mistakes, you own up to them. &gt;&gt; This is about coming up. This is about, you know, fessing up, letting God deal with whatever needs to be dealt with in our lives so that we can we so we can produce what it is that he's looking for us to produce. Amen. Then you need to let go of the things that you're that are getting in the way of his purpose for your life. Remember, the Holy Ghost comes to fulfill and manifest his purpose through you. Amen. A Christlike character only comes through suffering and being tried and being tested and having to to deal with your patience and the things that you that you you know you so easily some people you know like my god some people are so hotheaded. I'm telling you you can't even talk to them. You talk to them a little bit. You start to you know you mention a little thing and right away you see that head just you know spin a couple times. you know, hotheaded, getting angry so quick. What kind of a spirit is that? Amen. That's the kind of thing that's trying to, you know, take away your joy, take away your peace. Don't let that spirit, remember, the spirit of God is positive. &gt;&gt; Amen. You need to start looking at certain things. You need to start looking at your diet. If you're if you're if you're if you're constantly feeding on sugar, sugar, desserts all the time, feeding on those things that are not good that you know that that they they they don't Do you know that you can you can find yourself in states of depression? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because of the over you know the the over stimulation that takes place with. So you got to be wise too. And I'm awakening you know I'm waking up to all these things. You know, you know when it starts happening, right, &gt;&gt; Brother John? It starts happening when you start getting a little older. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. You start to feel the aches and pains. You start to Wait a minute here. Why am I Why is this thing over here? Why? What the heck's this all about? All of a sudden, you change this. Oh, feel better. You change. You are what you eat. You want to be the word, feed on the word. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Don't be one of these people. Well, the word I pray over all my food and it's all good. 20 bags of chips, you know, cheesies over here, a cheesecake in the fridge, you know. Oh, yeah. Well, good luck. Hallelujah. But yes, listen, I just read this here from adoption. He says it's not up there. He says, "Yep, sure do." Says, "The Holy Spirit, I'll give him." Now, this is the Holy Spirit. He says, "I'll give him tests, boy. I'll try him this way and I'll try him that way. I've thrown him down sick. I've put him under. I've stomped him. I've let the devil do everything to him he could do. He come right back up again. Now he's talking about you. Amen. He come the same. Come up again. I made him sick. I done this. I throwed him in the hospital. I took him out here and I done this. I done that. I turned his wife against him. Oh my goodness. My goodness. Let me tell you. Listen. The enemy will do anything he can. He'll use those that are closest to you. &gt;&gt; You wonder why? What? What's with all this attitude coming from my children there? You know why? Why are they attacking me like this? Why? Why? Why all of a sudden all these attacks coming? Why? Because you're growing into your position. That's why. &gt;&gt; It's because you're starting to cause trouble around them and they don't like it. Amen. They don't like the fact that you're becoming a little more spiritual and and God's opening your understanding to your position as a son and you're all of a sudden saying, "Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. This squatter over here out. Come on. &gt;&gt; They don't like that. &gt;&gt; But listen, they will appreciate it when it does come down. Let me tell you. And when that thing leaves, &gt;&gt; they'll be glad they got rebuked. You know, sometimes you got to rebuke your brother, rebuke your sister, rebuke your son, rebuke your wife, rebuke your husband. Listen, if you get under that anointing, let the Holy Spirit show you by the word, not anger. I'm not talking about revenge. &gt;&gt; Watch that spirit of pride. Be careful now because ego is a demon from the pits of hell. &gt;&gt; It'll rise up right away and say, "You don't talk to me that way. You don't this, that, this," not realizing that's the Holy Ghost saying, "Enough." We need to recognize what we're under, saints. Amen. He says, "Turn his wife." I turned his neighbor against him. I turned everything. that didn't make a bit of difference. Said, "Though he slay me, yet I'll trust him." &gt;&gt; Oh, God. He says, "I killed his family." What? I killed I took this. I did this. I done all this. I did this. That other still he stood right up. &gt;&gt; Though he slay me, yet I'll serve him. He's mine. Oh, well, I believe we ought to call him out somewhere to a little special place and have an adoption. That's what the father says. Here we go. Now, he says, "I I I've tested him in all these areas. I'm going to take him out. I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to adopt him. I'm going to show that he's mine." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look, he goes he goes, "Now, when the father in the Old Testament understood that his son was come of age and had been seasoned out unto adoption, they bored they they bored a child. But when when there's a son, right? Then he says, "But then they'll never be no more than just a child, just an ordinary son until they mature and show what they are." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sons of God are going to manifest in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. The word of God is being preached to to to call into manifestation the sons of God. The the earth is groaning for the manifestation, but the word is what calls them into manifestation. Amen. They're born a child, but when they're a son, right? Then, but then they'll never be no more just a child. Then he calls out. Now, here we are, church. Are you ready? Now, it's a little bit late. Everybody bite your finger, pinch your soul, and pluck your heart just for a minute. See, now we're going to place the church. Now when the church gets to that place, he says, "Manasses, you belong over here. Ephraim, you over here." Then he takes them out to a certain place. The father does. And he sets him up on a high place like this and he has a ceremony and they all come around and he said, "I want everyone to know that this is my child &gt;&gt; and I adopt my son. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hear ye him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here, listen. Jesus had an adoption. Amen. When he went up on the mountain, Amen. Glory to God. And and Moses and Elijah were there and and and the apostles were there and they and they turned around and says, "Should we build a a a tabernacle for for each of you?" No. Then the voice said, "This is my son. &gt;&gt; This is my beloved son. You and I, we are the sons and daughters of God. Hear ye [screaming] him. &gt;&gt; You got to recognize the dispensational change of the word. Amen. He says, "Now watch. Here's my son. I adopt him into my family. Although he's been my son since he was born. &gt;&gt; You always were a son of God. &gt;&gt; But since he received the Holy Ghost, he's been my son. But now I'm going to place him positionally in authority. &gt;&gt; What he fires is fired. &gt;&gt; Satan out. You can't stay here no more. You out. This is disease. You out. Financial burden. You [screaming] out. Kick him out. That comes with authority. &gt;&gt; That comes as a son of God. What he hires is hired. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. He starts to speak the word. starts to place sons and daughters of God by the by the ministry of the word. Amen. Glory to God. Let's go to the next scripture here. We're winding down, saints. Amen. First Corinthians, it says, "If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? But now hath God set." Set means positioned. &gt;&gt; Positioned sons and daughters. This word that's being preached is to place you, position you as a son, an adopted son of God, so that you can receive your inheritance. &gt;&gt; You haven't received that inheritance yet. &gt;&gt; Oh, what? Let's move on. This is going to this only gets better, saints. This inheritance that that if we had listen, if we received our inheritance, you wouldn't be here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'll explain that more as we move on. He says, "But now hath God set the members, every one of them, in the body, as he hath pleased, as it pleases him." So don't you be complaining. Go to the next slide here. He says here in adoption 1960, he says, "Now, who could doubt that?" That's what Paul said. That's Paul's scripture. That's Paul's writing. That's what he taught his church. the church positionally before the foundations of the world. When God in his labor pain was bringing forth bringing forth you knowing what you would do, he positionally placed you into his own body to what? To be a housewife, &gt;&gt; to be a farmer, &gt;&gt; to be a preacher, to be a prophet, to be this or to be that? He placed you positionally because he knew what you would be in this end time. &gt;&gt; He knew what he would need you to manifest in this end time so that you could edify the body of Christ so that you could be a nourishment to the body so that you could be really an adopted son or daughter of God. You say a farmer. No, you're a son. You say a housewife. No, you're also a daughter of the living God. Amen. It's not just housewife, not just son. It's not just a It's It says the Lord predestinated you for that position in order to display his authority by his word in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. So you housewife, you're going to be a testimony &gt;&gt; and you will stand as a testimony on the day of that judgment. &gt;&gt; When somebody comes out and says, "Well, I was only a housewife." &gt;&gt; So was she her sitting with Christ at the throne at the judgment seat? &gt;&gt; Her him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That that that that factory worker guy who was constantly, you know, praying over his food. That guy who was constantly telling me about the goodness of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, that guy. That woman. Amen. But the battles are too great. Why is it so difficult? Why must we bear this reproach for the word? Amen. Because the Lord is looking for maturity. &gt;&gt; He's looking for character. He's looking for you to be everything that he wants you to be. Amen. What does the testing create in us? Character. Let the musicians come. I'm not going to move on here. There's there's there's more that I' that I've got here, but next week we're going to break into this next aspect. And and you know, it's it's wonderful. This is what I was I was you know, you know, when a preacher gets up and he comes to preach a message, he's got the end in the back of his mind of what he's working towards. He knows what the end result is going to produce. He's looking for that manifestation of God. Amen. And so that's that, you know, that that that's what excites us as ministers to see what God is producing in our lives. But today, God just wanted to deal with these things. I hope that, you know, that that that maybe the Holy Spirit, you know, exposed a little something in your life or somewhere where, you know, you've let a squatter in and, you know, but he's saying, "No, no, you you you possess it. It's yours. I've given it to you. It's your inheritance. It's you just need to obtain it. It's it's coming. It's you're you're you're you're slowly line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little, there a little. God is producing sons and daughters. Amen. Praise God. I'm excited about the word of God. Praise God. Let's sing that song. We are heirs. Glory to God. Amen. Praise God. Oh, we are air. Is that the right key? &gt;&gt; No, higher. We are hes [music] of the father.
