[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] good evening friends it's good to be in
[0:17] the Lord's house welcome and I am happy
[0:22] to be here with you may the Lord bless
[0:25] you in a wonderful wonderful way our
[0:30] Bible study today I believe will be
[0:35] something that will enlighten you
[0:38] our scripture is found in the book of
[0:44] Genesis first book of the Bible chapter
[0:49] 45 verses 1 to 7 and it reads then
[0:56] Joseph could not refrain himself before
[1:00] all of them that stood by him and he
[1:05] cried cause every man took lot from me
[1:10] and there stood no man with him and
[1:16] while Joseph made himself known unto his
[1:19] brethren and he wept aloud and the
[1:24] Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard
[1:28] and Joseph said unto his brethren I am
[1:33] Joseph my father yet live and his
[1:39] brethren could not answer him
[1:42] for they were troubled at his presence
[1:45] and Joseph said unto his brethren come
[1:50] near to me I pray you and they came here
[1:55] and he said I am Joseph your brother
[1:59] whom you sold into Egypt
[2:03] now therefore be not grief nor angry
[2:06] with yourselves that you sold me hither
[2:08] for God did sent me before you to
[2:12] preserve life for these 2 years at the
[2:17] fan
[2:18] being in the land and yet there are five
[2:22] years in the which there shall neither
[2:25] be any earring nor harvest and God sent
[2:30] me before you to preserve you a
[2:33] posterity in the earth and to save your
[2:38] lives by a great deliverance glory to
[2:44] God now my topic is Joseph a type of
[2:52] Christ before we speak let us pray our
[2:59] gracious father we thank you for the
[3:01] word out of the book of Genesis that we
[3:04] just read and we pray that the Great
[3:06] Spirit will anoint the word of God to
[3:09] our hearts and lighten our minds open up
[3:13] the channels of our thoughts and father
[3:16] may you have all the praise honor and
[3:20] glory as we submit ourselves to leave
[3:23] for service in the name of Jesus Christ
[3:27] that ignored of God amen
[3:30] Joseph a type of Christ now first of all
[3:37] you will say to me brother Simon a type
[3:43] what is it time now according to grace
[3:47] publications dictionary of the Bible
[3:51] symbols it says a type is any person or
[3:56] thing that provides a visual picture at
[4:01] an earlier time that represents
[4:05] something or someone yet to appear it is
[4:10] a kind of prophetic picture for example
[4:15] Noah's Flood was a type or symbol of
[4:19] Christian baptism which was to come
[4:23] Israel's journey from Egypt to Canaan
[4:27] was a symbol or type
[4:31] prophetic type of the Christian walk the
[4:35] Christian a journey from Egypt from a
[4:40] life of sin into God's promised land of
[4:45] the blessing Holy Spirit and later on
[4:48] into the gates of heaven for the God's
[4:51] glory amen
[4:53] so that is what a type is now Joseph
[4:59] himself was the eleventh son of the
[5:03] Patriot Jacob and the first son of
[5:08] Rachel his life we will approach this
[5:13] subject for the point of view of Joseph
[5:16] in Israel Joseph in Egypt and Joseph
[5:23] meeting his brethren now when Joseph was
[5:30] very young he was hated by his brethren
[5:37] by his brothers but why was he hinted by
[5:42] his brothers why was he hated it was all
[5:47] because he was spiritual he had the the
[5:52] gifts and the anointing of God upon him
[5:56] and he was spiritual and they hated him
[6:00] for that because he could not help
[6:04] seeing visions and having the ability to
[6:10] understand and to interpret dreams he
[6:15] could not help even dreaming dreams
[6:17] himself and so they hated him for this
[6:23] supernatural god-given ability that was
[6:27] flowing and was activated in him and
[6:31] through his life he couldn't help
[6:34] himself he couldn't not display anything
[6:37] else but what he was and what was in him
[6:41] and therefore his
[6:43] others hated him without a real cause
[6:47] but you see even though they hated him
[6:51] he was beloved of his father Jacob you
[6:55] could loved him and Jacob himself was a
[6:59] prophet and understood what was God was
[7:04] dealing with this boy and so with that
[7:08] understanding his daddy Jacob knew
[7:12] exactly how to deal with him and to keep
[7:16] his relationship with him no this is a
[7:21] perfect type this is a perfect type of
[7:26] Jesus Christ God the Father so loved the
[7:32] world that He gave His only begotten Son
[7:35] God loved his son and then his brethren
[7:41] his brothers his Jewish brothers
[7:44] the screams the Pharisees they hated him
[7:48] why did they hit him they hated him
[7:52] without a cause because he was spiritual
[7:56] he could interpret the Word of God
[8:00] well did Moses seem to use such and such
[8:04] well did Isaiah say such and such have
[8:07] you not read the scriptures do you not
[8:10] know the scriptures and you know err he
[8:14] would say to them and because of this
[8:16] they hated him without a real cause
[8:20] because he was anointed of the Holy
[8:25] Spirit to interpret the word of the hour
[8:30] see he could heal the sick he could
[8:34] perform miracles he could raise the dead
[8:38] they were tied into their traditions and
[8:41] he was free he was just free and walking
[8:48] under the leadership and guidance of the
[8:52] Holy Spirit praise God and
[8:56] he would see visions and he would
[9:02] foretell things he would discern he
[9:07] would said before Philip called you I
[9:11] saw you when you were under the fig tree
[9:15] see he would see visions he could
[9:18] discern the hearts of men and discern
[9:24] evil spirits of all the people they
[9:27] could not do it
[9:29] they were just caught into their
[9:32] theological and seminary talks and stuff
[9:36] of that nature and so they hated him
[9:40] went up a real cause think about it they
[9:45] have no real reason his life was
[9:48] thoughtless because the Bible tells us
[9:51] they marked his notes every word he
[9:54] spoke they they passed it they watched
[9:58] it they twisted every everything he said
[10:01] when it was a prophecy when it was a
[10:04] foretelling or or when it was this is
[10:07] that they even looked upon him as
[10:10] uneducated and unknown yeah
[10:14] this is Joseph's son we know him with
[10:18] seminary did he go to which which
[10:20] Mitch's synagogue which great teacher
[10:24] that he go to and they could find no
[10:27] place else where he could go to for he
[10:29] was gone and God didn't need to be
[10:33] taught anything oh praise God hallelujah
[10:38] it was just God in flesh it was the same
[10:42] eternal God whom they claimed to worship
[10:45] that in their midst and he was the
[10:49] unrecognized presence of that Living God
[10:53] think about it so just like Joseph's
[10:57] brethren or brothers before him they
[11:00] hated he
[11:02] Jesus also without a cause no think
[11:06] about how those sons of Jacob treated
[11:12] Joseph and paralleled that with how the
[11:17] Jewish brothers treated their own
[11:21] brother Jesus Christ when he came on the
[11:25] scene according to the Scriptures true
[11:29] jealousy true hatred but of the cause
[11:35] for being spiritual they cast him into a
[11:41] pit they took away from him
[11:45] his coat of many colors that the father
[11:50] had given to him then they dipped in
[11:55] some blood to to deceive their daddy
[12:00] that Joseph was actually dead and so
[12:06] they put it in the pit and they sold
[12:10] them into slavery and the slave traders
[12:15] then took him into Egypt and there in
[12:20] Egypt he was resold to a great general
[12:26] now we know according to the scriptures
[12:31] Joseph was accused falsely by this
[12:37] generals wife and here this accusation
[12:44] Joseph was falsely imprisoned but after
[12:50] some time his ability the Spirit of God
[12:57] in his life began to interpret the
[13:02] dreams of the prisoners that were in
[13:06] that prison with him and so this brought
[13:13] him to the attention of
[13:15] Piru and so he was brought from that
[13:21] place into the very palace and presence
[13:26] of Pharaoh and given such authority and
[13:30] power that none could approach Pharaoh
[13:34] unless they came through Joseph so as it
[13:38] was with Jesus Christ no man can come to
[13:41] the Father except by me
[13:44] speaking of they the father being a
[13:47] Jehovah's spirit that created this body
[13:51] called Jesus then and with the body that
[13:55] was called Jesus and what in him so God
[14:01] was in Christ reconciling the world to
[14:05] himself so you could not come to the
[14:08] Father which was in him except by him
[14:13] and that is why he used those words no
[14:16] man can come unto the Father except
[14:19] through me
[14:21] now notice the trajectory of Joseph's
[14:27] life as they say - that you can't keep a
[14:31] good man down and watch the blessing and
[14:36] the hand of God upon him first
[14:40] his brothers blessed him in a bit but
[14:44] the bit could not hold him from the pit
[14:49] the traders took him and placed him into
[14:54] a prison and from the prison God exalted
[14:59] him to Pharaoh's Palace so from the pit
[15:02] to the prison to the palace there it was
[15:06] the hand of God upon his life and when
[15:10] the hand of God is upon her life that
[15:12] will be also your trajectory if you
[15:15] trust him and believe him you know take
[15:18] you from the ghetto and put you in the
[15:21] get more God would so anoint you and
[15:26] you my friends Oh hallelujah
[15:29] from the gutter balls and place you to
[15:32] the uttermost the Holy Spirit of
[15:34] Almighty God will so use you bless you
[15:38] prosper your waste and spiritually and
[15:42] naturally God will be with you and watch
[15:46] over you trials make cotton as it does
[15:49] in Joseph slight problems may come
[15:53] situations may arise but God will help
[15:56] you to overcome them for with him in
[16:00] your life we are more than conquerors
[16:03] through him that loved us and greater is
[16:07] He that is in you in me than he that is
[16:12] in the world's now let's examine
[16:17] Joseph's life while he was there in
[16:22] Egypt and in Egypt we see he is a
[16:26] perfect type of Christ just as much as
[16:29] dumb from his glory everliving story my
[16:33] god Savior came and Jesus was his name
[16:37] he left the ivory palaces of glory of
[16:42] heaven and came to this sin cursed earth
[16:46] and so Joseph left his father's house
[16:50] and was placed in a pit as a token to
[16:55] the prison and later into the palace but
[16:59] there he found himself in Egypt as Jesus
[17:03] found himself in this Shimkus world in
[17:07] the house of that general he was falsely
[17:10] accused and punished and imprisoned
[17:14] without a cause just late the Lord Jesus
[17:18] but there while Joseph was in that
[17:22] prison
[17:24] Joseph interpreted the dreams of the
[17:28] butler and the Baker that he met while
[17:32] he was in that prison those prisoners
[17:37] there now according to Joseph dreams and
[17:42] interpretation of those dreams the
[17:45] butler was restored to life back to his
[17:49] old life and position the baker we found
[17:56] was condemned to death so according to
[18:02] Genesis 42 verse 2 3
[18:06] you see Joseph was numbered with these
[18:10] two transgressors or imprisoned along
[18:13] with these 2 transgressors and we find
[18:17] according to Luke 23 verses 32 and 33
[18:20] that Jesus also was numbered with 2
[18:26] amongst a transgressions these two
[18:29] transgressors one on the right and the
[18:32] other on the left he was crucified among
[18:37] two thieves according to the Word of God
[18:41] here we see Scripture and type being
[18:45] fulfilled now what happened to Joseph
[18:48] thousands of years before was now being
[18:54] fulfilled in the life of Jesus Christ
[18:58] see here it was that this has made clear
[19:04] to us by this type making itself fully
[19:08] known notice Jesus was taken off the
[19:14] cross and exalted up into heaven
[19:19] Joseph was taken from the prison and
[19:23] placed and exalted by the right hand of
[19:28] Pharaoh in Pharaoh's Palace thank God
[19:32] even so Jesus Christ raised up and no
[19:38] man can come to Pharaoh except through
[19:42] Joseph and no man could come to the
[19:46] Father except to
[19:49] Lord Jesus Christ for there is one
[19:52] mediator between God and men 1st Timothy
[19:56] chapter 2 verse 5 no mediator between
[20:00] God and men but the Lord and Savior
[20:03] Jesus Christ he is also need you don't
[20:06] need Mary you don't need any other of
[20:10] the Saints you don't need any other
[20:14] great person whoever there they may be
[20:19] all you need in your life is the one who
[20:24] got placed there to stand in the gap to
[20:27] be the mediator to be urines intercessor
[20:30] to be your advocate to plead your case
[20:35] based upon his shed blood that you
[20:39] should be set free and not imprison and
[20:43] Satan's prison house of habits of Lies
[20:46] of sin of cruelty my friends but to be
[20:51] able to raise your hands to heaven and
[20:54] say thank God I'm free I'm free praise
[20:58] God for evermore just because of your
[21:02] Redeemer your mediator your all-in-all
[21:06] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[21:09] no just stick with this let us recognize
[21:13] that wherever Joseph went prosperity
[21:19] broke out Joseph went into Egypt that
[21:24] was going into a time of famine and the
[21:31] first job the job that he was given he
[21:34] costs Egypt to prosper when he was in
[21:38] the jail the jail prospers and when
[21:43] Jesus returns the desert will prosper
[21:47] because he is the son of prosperity and
[21:51] when he comes into your life there will
[21:55] be blessing there will be prosperity in
[21:57] every aspect of your life because
[22:00] beloved I
[22:02] of all things that you prosper and be in
[22:05] health even as your soul prospereth amen
[22:09] being helped physically mentally
[22:11] spiritually yes God wants you to have
[22:16] what in a life of complete spiritual
[22:20] natural mental abundance with his
[22:23] anointing flowing and moving through
[22:26] your life praise God hallelujah so when
[22:30] Jesus comes to Israel again it will
[22:33] blossom as a rose when Jesus comes to
[22:36] your life you will blossom as a rose I
[22:40] tell you when that age breaks upon this
[22:43] realm it will be such a time of
[22:46] prosperity and blessing not only upon
[22:50] Israel but upon the entire face of the
[22:54] earth oh praise God more than any other
[22:57] time that the world has ever known
[23:02] everyone will be able to sit under their
[23:04] own fig tree plant their own vines their
[23:08] own ferns and enjoy their lines and walk
[23:12] in peace and live in the presence of God
[23:16] and join a fullness of joy forevermore
[23:19] and be there enjoying God's pleasures
[23:24] and the joy of His grace unspeakable joy
[23:28] and full of glory praise be to God
[23:33] hallelujah thank you Jesus
[23:35] now notice not only the prosperity but
[23:39] that everywhere that Joseph went the cry
[23:44] went out the leader Joseph Jews have
[23:49] bowed the knee to Joseph when the
[23:52] trumpets sounded always to announce his
[23:56] arrival when he was going anywhere and
[23:59] when Jesus comes back to word again when
[24:03] we recognize our Lord's return to earth
[24:07] again it will be by trumpet sound the
[24:10] trumpet self
[24:12] sound of dead shall rise and we which
[24:14] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[24:17] to be ever with the Lord that is our
[24:20] Joseph for this hour the Lord Jesus
[24:24] Christ
[24:24] so was it with Joseph back there that
[24:28] they sounded a trumpet whenever he was
[24:31] coming and when the trumpet sounded
[24:36] everyone shopkeepers in the bazaars
[24:40] along the way all the people that were
[24:44] buying and selling their goods all the
[24:47] great houses that were along that Street
[24:51] all the performers and street actors
[24:56] that were there had to come to a
[24:58] standstill stop what they were doing and
[25:01] bow their knees to Joseph when his
[25:04] presence was announced by a TripIt
[25:08] called hallelujah attend friends one of
[25:11] these days the child of God will sound
[25:14] times shall be no more
[25:17] every time will stand still upon this
[25:21] earth when the trumpet of God sounds and
[25:24] the dead in Christ shall rise first and
[25:27] that morning breaks up on us it turn up
[25:31] bright and fear everything will then
[25:34] have to bow the knee to Joseph for it is
[25:38] written wherefore God highly exalted him
[25:42] and given him a name that is above every
[25:49] name that at the name of Jesus every
[25:54] knee shall bow and every tongue shall
[25:58] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord every
[26:03] knee should bow of things in heaven and
[26:07] things on the earth and things under the
[26:11] earth and that every tongue shall
[26:16] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the
[26:21] glory of God the Father Philip
[26:24] chapter 2 verses 9 to 11 yes my friends
[26:29] here it is I remember an old song that
[26:32] says the name of Jesus bowing falling
[26:38] prostrate at his feet King of Kings in
[26:42] heaven well crown him when our journey
[26:46] is complete
[26:47] o precious name precious name oh how
[26:52] sweet the name of Jesus is so sweet I
[26:56] love its music to repeat that wonderful
[27:00] blessed name of Jesus oh what a
[27:03] beautiful and wonderful name friends
[27:06] that is the redemptive name of God your
[27:09] deliverance is in Jesus Christ come to
[27:12] him now later lady fun you laid your
[27:15] ambitions later trophies at his feet and
[27:19] we see them into your heart and into
[27:21] your life and live for him and you will
[27:25] grow an abundant grace forever more
[27:30] now notice carefully here another
[27:35] glorious revelation out of the Word of
[27:38] God that we can type Joseph while he was
[27:43] in Egypt and while there not only was he
[27:49] in prison not only was he exalted but he
[27:53] was also given a Gentile bride he was
[27:58] given one of fairest daughters a Gentile
[28:01] bride think of it he being a Jew God
[28:06] permitted him to marry a Gentile bride
[28:10] oh praise God
[28:13] I hope we can see clearly that time in
[28:16] the Word of God even as Jesus Christ
[28:19] himself was a permitted by God to marry
[28:25] a Gentile bride it's hid your Bible is
[28:29] in the scriptures just think on these
[28:31] things and let your thoughts percolate
[28:34] and meditate
[28:35] and whiten and you'll understand clearly
[28:38] what God is signifying hair in his word
[28:43] no no we realize that true this
[28:48] beautiful Gentile bride
[28:51] Joseph had two sons one called Ephraim
[28:55] and the other called menacing now when
[29:02] Joseph had gotten his brothers to bring
[29:06] his father's in Jacob into Egypt being
[29:10] very old at that time
[29:12] Jews have seized the opportunity to
[29:15] allow his father whom he knew to be a
[29:18] prophet to bless his two sons and
[29:23] generally we know that the inheritance
[29:28] and the greater blessing most of the
[29:31] times went to the elder boy but in this
[29:37] instance when this great prophet of God
[29:40] seated and the two boys kneeling before
[29:45] him
[29:46] their grandfather was about to place his
[29:51] lands upon their hands and just as he
[29:56] was about to do that something moved
[29:59] upon him and caused him to cross his
[30:03] hands and so his hands was laid upon
[30:08] them with his hands cross of course I
[30:13] type in a symbol of the cross of Christ
[30:16] that was to come also it was a symbol of
[30:22] the blessing which should have gone to
[30:26] the elder type of the Jewish people left
[30:31] them and went over unto the Gentiles it
[30:37] was in symbol or in type that are in
[30:41] prophetic type that that was what God
[30:44] was fixing to do of course that
[30:48] at that time for even Joseph himself was
[30:52] puzzled and said nay my father not so
[30:56] this is not tradition this is not how we
[31:00] do it but the great prophet of God we
[31:04] find here my friends Jacob said that was
[31:10] not I it was God that cross my hands so
[31:17] here we are seeing in tight as I've said
[31:20] the blessing that belonged to the
[31:24] firstborn or to the Jewish people was
[31:30] for a season given over to the younger
[31:34] son the type of the Gentiles and through
[31:40] the cross are at the cross we were first
[31:45] able to see the light at the cross of
[31:48] Jesus Christ because of rejection by his
[31:53] brothers with other cause the blessing
[31:58] temporarily left them and came over to
[32:03] the Gentiles that he might have a
[32:06] Gentile bride as the book of access that
[32:10] he would call out the people from
[32:14] amongst the Gentiles for his name sake
[32:17] just as a man will choose a wife to take
[32:21] on his name and that is why be baptized
[32:23] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[32:26] because that is his name he is a savior
[32:30] he's a Baptizer he's a healer he's a
[32:33] king he is father he is son his Holy
[32:37] Spirit but the name of that person is
[32:41] the Lord Jesus Christ and be baptized
[32:43] are there are people or anyone that so
[32:47] desires in the name of Jesus Christ so
[32:51] you will take all this name
[32:53] be a part of the bride of Jesus Christ
[32:57] amen
[32:58] hallelujah some areas friends the hands
[33:03] were crossed in the Old Testament as a
[33:05] symbol and type in the days of Joseph
[33:08] and now we see God cross his hands again
[33:13] at the cross of Jesus Christ
[33:16] and they're my friends the blessing we
[33:21] see Abraham came to the Gentiles through
[33:27] Jesus Christ so that we may receive the
[33:30] promise of the Holy Spirit true faith
[33:35] true revelation through understanding to
[33:39] acceptance of the revealed Word of the
[33:42] Living God so the blessing that we
[33:45] repeat of Abraham came through the cross
[33:49] to the Gentiles for the Jews at that
[33:53] time our Jewish brothers for lack of
[33:57] understanding or as Paul the Apostle
[34:00] said there were blinded for a season for
[34:03] our sake amen
[34:06] they are original branch we were just
[34:09] grafted in but nevertheless the same
[34:13] life flows into the real branch flows
[34:17] into the grafted branch also here we are
[34:21] at this time of history with the Spirit
[34:25] of God flowing and moving upon the
[34:28] Gentiles then therefore yes as they the
[34:32] Jewish brothers rejected Jesus Christ as
[34:36] their Messiah and rejected the cross he
[34:39] turned his attention and heard what his
[34:42] that he took a Gentile bride praise God
