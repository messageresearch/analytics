everybody into the house of the Lord this morning it's good to see everybody welcome back I know some of you have been away some are um you know just uh getting over some illness we know that January is always a tough month amen praise God God bless you Saints thank you we know that it's always been a bit of a tough month with um you know flu running rampant and um you know it's it's a month where the weather so up and down and everything else and you need to be aware you know I was talking with brother philli earlier saying you know what we need to be extra careful um with this kind of weather it gets cold and then it drops and you go outside you think oh you know what it's okay I don't need to throw a hat on I'm just going to do this that and all and all of a sudden boom you get hit you know so you got to be wise amen yes he is the Lord God that Health thee watches over thee amen praise God we know that amen but he also asks us to be wise as um uh you know children and humans on this Earth amen praise God and so we know that Psalms 107: 19 says when there's trouble it says then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he saveth them out of their distresses he sent his word you believe that amen he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the children of men amen you believe the word of God this morning can can heal you in what I'm not just talking about sickness in the body I'm talking about every aspect of your walk and your life with God he's sending forth his word so that we can be delivered because while we are yet human we have to overcome this Dimension and this flesh amen praise God so the word of God this morning is what I'm expecting to go forward I'm under great expectation the same way that you are amen because God uh meets the needs of his children according to their faith and I've got lots of faith I believe God can do all things amen there's nothing too hard for the Lord amen praise God I'm excited because of that glory to God so let's let's remember I know we've already prayed brother Chris sister farita brother Tim sister Deborah I know Sister Sheila elanga um you know Kelsey in the hospital praise God but maybe you've got a need and you want to raise your hand unto the Lord as we go to the word of God Amen that the Lord will just pour out once again and meet your needs amen father how grateful we are this morning Lord your promised word says you send forth your word and it heals the people we believe it with all of our heart lord and there shall not be one feeble that will leave this place this morning according to your word if they can believe Grant it this morning drop Faith let your Pillar of Fire move into the midst of the of the pews this morning and go search the hearts oh God Lord won't you raise a standard around every situation and every circumstance and just Lord receive all the praise and the glory we want to give you praise for it Lord we know that you're doing it and we know that you're more than able this morning bless your word now Lord anoint it to our hearts may it give us uh the faith to to overcome the challenges that we face as human beings in these in these weak vessels Lord but Lord when we are at our weakest Point that's when you are the strongest and so won't you be our strength today won't you let the joy of your presence in our hearts this morning that'll give us strength even beyond what we even think is possible we will never fail but to give you the one and only true God all praise Glory and Honor in Jesus name amen praise God let's go to the word of God this morning we're going to continue like you know January being a a month where you know people get depressed they get their visa and MasterCard statements and they get into Financial stress and all of those things but uh we want the word to be the new standard Amen in their lives so that they can have joy to know that God is still Jehovah Gyra he'll provide all the needs he's still our healer he's he's the joy in our lives and he wants you to just recognize that to give your heart to him surrender your life and your heart unto the Lord amen praise God but this morning um we want to look at the right birth will produce the right heart amen it requires you you must come God's provided way amen God has a provided way and if we can recognize that you enter into a place where all things become possible you don't have to remain in the in the mental oppressed condition that you find yourself in constantly the enemy attacking you mentally and anxiety and all kinds of things trying to bring you down you can know that the Lord is your joy he's your strength he can overcome all of those things let his word do that for you this morning amen let's read our scripture Proverbs 23:26 says my son give me thine heart and let Thine Eyes observe my ways amen God bless you may be seated wherever your heart is that's where your treasure is going to be you know that right it's wherever you have you know given your heart and I I remember when I came to the Lord you know I'd heard about God I'd heard about Jesus Christ I'd heard about you know going to church and I'd gone to church I was even an altar boy you know when I was a young kid and I would go to church and I would always think you know oh um this is you know this is uh uh a sacred place you know like as a kid you didn't you didn't fully understand but you know until one day the Lord came and he took my heart amen he took it and when he took it I was in a position in my life where I realized that I had to give it amen and until you come to a place where you realize that you know you you can go on in the condition that you're in you can go on and and deal with everything in your life and have to deal with it on your own because or you're going to go to psychologist or you're going to go to you know you're going to constantly be looking for for somebody to give you the right advice on you know overcoming situations or things or maybe you end up in a in a rehab center because of a drug abuse or you know whatever but until you come to a place where where you can recognize that he's real and he can take your heart he can shape your heart he can restore your heart he can give you joy unspeakable and full of Glory until you come to that place you're gonna have to fight this nature amen praise God and so let's read our next scripture from Romans chapter 9 uh verse 6-13 not as though the word of God hath taken none effect for they are not all Israel which are of Israel neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall th seed be called that is they which are children of the flesh these are not the children of God we need to understand and and and come to a to a a place where God is the absolute amen his word is the absolute and we're going to be looking at something here today that that that truly is going to get us to check our hearts amen and this is they which are children of the promise are counted for the seed the children of the promise are counted for the seed for This Is The Word of Promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children being not not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated wow so here now God is speaking here through through Paul and he's telling us that that God's calling is not based on human genealogy just because you were brought up in in a Catholic church or you know in a in a Catholic Family or a Baptist Church or a Baptist family or or whatever type of religion and and because it's it's called Christianity and because you were born in that that you know your M and and dad were that so you're that you know I talk to people sometimes and say are you a Christian they say well I'm a Catholic or I'm a Baptist I said why well because my parents were Baptists my you know and I was brought up in the church and I went to church and you know that's what I am you see it's it's like today religion is just a membership it's just because I was a part of this so I'm that but here now from the scripture Paul is making it very very clear here that it's not based on genealogy it's not based on the fact that your parents were religious amen it's not based on that it's based on a promise according to his word thank you Jesus and that's the whole thing when we go back right to the very beginning we see that there's this aspect of Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated because God knew even before while while they were yet in the womb of of R of Rebecca they one was loved and the other one was hated how can that be because God is Sovereign amen praise God and so here now we look at this whole aspect that Isaac a chosen vessel Rebecca a chosen vessel they were supernaturally called of the Lord both were very very dedicated unto the Lord prayed unto the Lord Isaac the son of Abraham knew exactly that he that God had called him and said out of your loin shall come forth all my chosen people very both religious and yet two children are born one hated one loved of God one has representation the other one doesn't look at Cain and Abel one knew exactly how to worship and what was required of the Lord and the other one had no idea and did it all by works amen no revelation of who God actually was and how important it was to know their Birthright Isaac and Ishmael same thing one by promise the other one came by unbelief Sarah disbelieved God when he first came and told her and and Abraham that that they were going to have a son they didn't think it was possible they didn't think that a birth could come out of an old couple like that but yet it was the word of God it was God's word and this is what we need to recognize that God's promises God's word is what has called us what has promised to us what what what our inheritance is who we truly are amen praise God let's read the quote here listen uh in the message serves we would see Jesus oh people are very religious always being as I preached the other night over there a Revival always produces twins like Esau and Jacob a man of the world and the man that desires the birthright see it's always every Revival produces that and this latterday revival has done the same thing and I'm telling you that the same thing is happening right now within this message within the called out churches of the last day every Revival so let's get on the Jacob side the one that's going to inherit the one that's going into the promised land and we cannot be satisfied just with going to church and putting our name on the book if we do there's something wrong let's keep climbing higher and higher till we reach that Promised Land amen praise God in other words we need to we need to check our heart to see if we're really really identified with the word for this day and for this hour I'm not talking about identifying as a Christian we're way down the road like we said last week we we've we've come way down the road Saints there's been a calling in these last days out of the denominational churches we're going to see here that that the that the the denominational churches they're religious but the spirit that's operating in all of those denominations I'm not talking about the people talking about the systems because there's people in there that are going to hear this word and if they have representation in the same way that that that God showed representation according to his word then they will respond to the word of God for this day and this hour and they will identify as a Jacob because they got to come out of the world Listen Jacob was no saint we're going to be seeing here in each and every one of you there's a Jacob and an Esau amen you need to discover which ones got control over you and which one you really are H not easy but this is the time that we're honing into Saints we need to come to a place where we you know where where we know that we know where we're standing amen because when everything starts to fall apart like it is right now in the world and things Israel back in their Homeland Israel at War situations and wars and and and circumstances the way they are right now in the world you need to know where you understand because things are going to happen so quickly that you're going to have to be prayed up we don't pray just when the emergencies come we need to be prayed up so that when the emergencies come we're ready with a sword to overcome by the word of the Lord amen praise God Amen so we want to look at and understand that God is sovereign he knows the end from the beginning he knows where you are right now he knows exactly where your identification is he knows exactly what's stirring in your heart he knows that he knows whether inside of you there's a desire for the word of God burning for for more of him to intervene and intercede in your life amen but the Christian churches today they want to tell you that God is a universal God God God is not a universal God God is God Amen how do they do that by putting their own interpretation on the word they want to have their own doctrines they want to have their own teachings and when you've got your own doctrines and your own teachings what happens Jesus said by your Traditions you make the word of God of none affect the people modern concept of God in this world is what that oh God loves everybody God is love yes he is God is just an old you know God that's sitting on a throne and and and he just you know loves everybody and he just lets you you you can come to me from from Dundas you can come to me from Applebee line you can come to me from Walker's line it doesn't matter which way you come but if you believe that I exist then you can come to to me that's that's nonsense that's not what he says when you search the scriptures you come to realize where Jesus said he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved believes what believes that there's a trinity believes that there's doctrines of man that there's uh 14 Stations of the Cross that you can pray to anybody can be a mediator for you that now you can just pray to the Virgin Mary and you can be saved no Jesus said the truth shall set you free trouble today the EV Evangelical Christianity has changed Gods they've created Gods to fit their needs not in this house the god that's revealed in the scripture is the one that can turn around and say Jacob I love Esau I hate because he's got a plan from before the foundations of the world and he knows his own Jesus said my sheep hear my voice no other voice no other man will they follow they will follow me praise God forever more glory to God if we're going to be bowing down to human choice and free will God doesn't bow down to human choice and Free Will you might as well be bowing down to Idols that's all paganism people want to put things in their homes and and and statues and you know they've got so many statues in their house I got you know I I got clients that you know when they when they buy a house the first thing they want to do is put a St Christopher statue in the front or St Francis or something in the front of their house it's nonsense now listen I'm not going to condemn them for it and they shouldn't be condemned for it it's because of tradition it's because of upbringing and that's where their faith is they don't realize one of The Commandments says Thou shalt not worship any false idols and people think oh I'm not worshiping it no if you're putting it there it's because you have faith that God is going to do something for your home because you've put it there right and now you're faith is in putting the idol in front of your home just using that as an example there's all kinds of different Idols people people are worshiping things jobs other people other ministers pastors teachers God requires him and only him to be acknowledged and worshiped thankes it's the very first commandment Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy might amen praise God so it's not based on our own righteous oh I go to church 20 times a month you could go to church 30 times a month I know people that do they go to church every day that is not going to save them here we've got out of two very very uh uh faithful spiritual mother and father and they bring forth two children one God loves one God hates because God knows the spirit that's behind that seed because if you go back to the Garden of Eden there was two seeds there was a cane and there was an Abel one was from The Serpent and one was from God Amen the Bible says it whether the people want to hear it or not everybody want oh everybody's a child of God everybody's children of God no sir not according to the word of God and when you search the scriptures and you see the evil that comes out of these children of disobedient and what God says about them which is an example right there one he loves one he hates we're going to be looking at their characters we're going to be looking at things and you're going to come to realize whoa where am I identifying here praise God he's his own interpreter let's go to the next slide we're going to read here and we're going to take our time we're going to draw from it what the Lord you know I I've been really rejoicing over some of the things that have you know that the Lord has been showing me through this and I trust that you know that you will you know you you'll be praying and you'll be believing and Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife now Rebecca was barren you can see this you know this same kind of situation all the way down through you know with Abraham and Sarah and now you know Rebecca she couldn't conceive and here Isaac now he entreats the Lord she's Barren and the Lord was intreated of him and Rebecca his wife conceived and the children struggled together within her and she said if it be so why am I thus she went to the Lord and she went to inquire of the Lord and the Lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the Elder Shall Serve the younger and so here now let's continue reading verse 24 and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb and the first came out red all over like a hairy garment and they called his name Esau and after that came his brother out and his hand took hold on Esau's heel and his name was called Jacob and the word and even the name Jacob is heel Grabber okay and Isaac was three scoring years old he was 60 years old when she bare them and the boys grew and Esau was a cunning Hunter a man of the field and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tense so one was smart one was a hunter and Jacob was just plain simple a mommy's Boy verse 28 and Isaac loved Esau so here you know Isaac because Isaac was under the tradition and the understanding that the first born was the one that would inherit the double portion and the blessing that the blessing would be passed on to the firstborn but did you notice that it was revealed to Rebecca obviously not Isaac interesting and Jacob saw pottage and Esau came from the field and he was faint and Esau said to Jacob feed me I pray thee with that same red pottage for I am faint therefore was his name called Edom and Edam means red and Jacob said sell me this day thy Birthright so here now I want you to notice Jacob has this desire for the right birth the birth right in him is this desire because Jacob was also a conniver and a deceiver he's not born again yet he hasn't had his conversion yet amen but yet there's something in him that just can't get satisfied unless he receives a blessing the blessing to him it may have been a financial blessing but all he knew that was in his heart he was not satisfied I don't know about you you may have been living in this world and you you were going about doing the things that you were doing and and something inside of you could not get fully satisfied that's why we turn to drugs alcohol uh money we're constantly buying new things to satisfy this desire that's within our hearts because we're looking you don't realize it but inside of you there's something to worship that wants to worship and praise and worship God especially if you came from God you didn't know you did you came into this human body and you fall into this Amnesia and then you come to realize wait a minute what's this thing that's burning in my heart well something was burning in Jacob's heart for that right birth and Jacob said sell me this day thy birthrights he was a businessman sell it to me I'll give you this you give me that and Esau said behold I'm at point to die and what profit shall this Birthright do to me see he had no Revelation he figured oh I'm just I'm already a son of Isaac I'm already a son of of uh of of the promise uh my my grandfather was Abraham and I heard about all the great things that he that he did and I'm part of his lineage and because I go to that church and because my parents have received the prophet then then I'm going to inherit those blessings automatically in my life not so not so and Jacob said swear to me this day and he swore unto him and he sold his Birthright unto Jacob then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage and lentils and he did eat and drink and Rose up and went his way thus Esau despised his Birthright it says it right there he despised his Birthright so in him it wasn't it wasn't solidly there there was no representation because as a son or a daughter of God there is no way that that you will just surrender to the things of this world and give up that relationship with God that that that representation that he's told you that I I I called you from before the foundations of the world there's a revelation in your heart that that burns within your heart that God is your absolute you can never leave it amen so when we look at this scripture at first glance it appears that Esau was the one that was smart you know his father loved him because he knew how to hunt and he would hunt Venison and he would cook it just exactly the way his father loved it and that's what you know that uh pleased Isaac and he figured as long as I'm pleasing my father as long as I'm I'm doing good and I'm I'm living a good you know uh uh life where I'm I'm I'm providing for the family you know he probably look at Jacob he's always hanging out with his mother he's cooking lentils you know he's hanging out in the tent but yet God had representation in Jacob and nothing in Esau glory to God Esau was the Elder and under under that position he was entitled to a double portion and the blessing of his father amen Esau obviously was smart he was strong but Jacob was a Mommy's boy the Bible said Jacob was plain he would cook while Esau was out hunting Esau loved by his father a man of works like many today they think that by works they can buy themselves into the kingdom of God thinking that that's good enough to make it into the kingdom but yet there was something in Esau that despised his Birthright listen here hearing next quote hearing recognizing acting on the word of God now we are fully acquainted we people who search the scriptures day and night read our papers and hear the news commentators that this world is now standing in the grip of two great spiritual forces we know that there's darkness and there's light there's good there's evil there's God there's the devil Satan is preparing his bride God is preparing his bride and they are both religious forces no matter matter how you look at it doesn't matter what even even if they're talking New Age movement it's a religious Force regardless of what religion that they teach whether it's Buddhism or or Muslim or whatever it is it's a religious Force the other force is the word of God period they call it Christianity but but they've they've they've taken the word and have made it of none effect to the people and so it's not a matter of just calling it Christianity it's the word of God and that's why when we Minister we Minister according to the word of God this is what sets the people free and I believe that these great forces are soon coming to a head and both these great forces was represented in these two sons of Isaac how that God in his infinite wisdom has foreshadowed all things to us that we might by these things know of certain what lays before us made it so plain that God and his word and the nature and his universe is so perfectly arranged together that even The Sinner can see something is fixing to take place God has so arranged it no one is without excuse next now we see in these two sons that when they before they were even born they were at war with one another even though their virgin mother for she was a virgin the beautiful Rebecca that married the righteous seed of God's promised Isaac that they were two consecrated Spirit-filled Believers of God for ordained to the very marriage that they United together by God fornew it and how could such a thing come through that one mother by one father one a very evil person and another a very good person and how that the good person looked to be evil and the evil looked to be good I'm telling you there's a lot of confusion right now even within the the the boundaries of this message people are you know if you look at Isaac and and and Rebecca you could you can uh you know take them as a type of the message of this hour because every every birth every Revival brings forth twins amen and there's a struggle that's taking place right within the boundaries of of this church this called out people because it has to happen he's he's his program has always been the same how could it be that there would be some that that that that the word of God in in the in these last days that it would become so deceiving that it would deceive even the very elect if it were possible because there would have to be two Spirits operating within the body of the church and this it shows that the ones that that that that seem to be the ones that are good that are holding all the great meetings and and and doing such wonderful works and millions of dollars going into all these different places and supporting and these are all things that are great it's getting the word of God out there but the Revelation is not that Christ is present right now dealing personally with you as an individual and that you must know that you're birthed right and that you've received the right birth and the word that is transforming your life in order to fulfill God's purpose for you in this time and season read on now that is always has been always will be God's program God cannot change his program because he makes his program perfect because it's part of him in in the Garden of Eden sin was so beautiful until it attracted Eve from righteousness to sin and in the same Garden where there was a tree of life there was also a tree of death imagine that from the same Garden there was a tree of life and a tree of death and from the same same church from the same Revival how many knows that we're under a seven seal Revival right now how many realizes that the that the seals were open in 1963 through the prophet of of Revelations 10 1-7 the angel messenger the seventh Church age messenger William Branham and there was a Revival that struck the Earth at that time but yet I want you to notice that at that very time when the Revival struck the people started to leave William brandom but yet it was a supernatural event that was only recognized by a few only the ones that were destined to recognize it those that had pre predestinated attributes of God himself ordained to be awakened at that particular time because God sends his word into every dispensation for a purpose and for a time and for a season and so these two Spirits have been operating from before the foundations of the world the tree of life was Christ and the tree of Good and Evil was Satan himself amen and the world is still feeding off of those same two trees which tree are you feeding off of which one are you of Jesus said I am the vine ye are the branches and so if you bring forth anything in your life when it comes to the word of God it's got to be identical to what the word is and what the word says praise God so Isaac now if we look at him he's like a type of the end time minister hist he was getting old we're going to read here many message Believers are being obsessed over the carnal aspects of brother Branham himself instead of the revealed word of God for this hour people are basing everything that's you know that that's the Esau spirit that all they want to do is is quote brother brandham you you quote it exactly the way he says it don't say it any other way forget about the fact that you need to have your own revelation of who you are Isaac a type of the message of the hour like every patriarch or or who the word of the Lord came to this this same pattern happened all throughout the scriptures whenever God would send his word to the people the people would either make him their Idol and worship him or they would follow the word that he was bringing forth the pillar of fire like the children of Israel the pillar of fire would show up in the daytime and at night because that was their deliverer he was their deliverer not the man God said they will hearken unto your voice it's not moses' voice it's God's voice when a prophet comes and stands before the people and says thus sayeth the Lord that's not the man speaking you're hearing his voice but it's being said by the Lord amen and so Isaac a type of the message of the hour and when we look at Isaac he was old and notice we're going to read now we're going to read from Genesis 27 notice what's taking place here in the in the giving of the blessing did you know that Isaac was 60 years old when he had Jacob and Esau and I just you know it just caught my attention and here we are 62 years after the opening of the seals and in 1963 there was a there was a Revival that broke forth on the opening of that seventh seal and some people just couldn't take it some people still to this day don't even believe that it's open why because God has not opened it to them but there's a people there's a there's a Jacob that that has a desire for the right birth amen and if you and if you continue on then that Jacob that's in you will be will will have a name change that take place and you'll be converted to realize that you're actually Israel God's promise God's promised people God's elected people amen praise God the bride's Revival is based on the word not a prophet I want to repeat that the bride's Revival is not based on a man it's based on the the word of God that came through the man amen hallelujah we were like Esau when we first came in because we thought oh works I got to go to church I gotta be there I got to do this I gotta uh you know I got to live right I gotta I gotta do all it's all all all work spirit that that you know when you first come in but inside the was was a Jacob that had a desire for the word of God you didn't know it until God spoke to you and awakened you out of your Amnesia amen so here now we come to realize that Esau's spirit is all about works and Jacob is all about the birthright Jacob got the blessing that could never be changed now let's read it Genesis 27 17 to 20 we're getting to something here stay with me and she gave the Savory meat and the bread which she had prepared into the hand of her son Jacob because she had heard okay she had heard what Isaac had just told Esau to go and get him some venison prepare it because he was feeling like it was his time his end was coming and it was time for him him to give the blessing to his son and so here now she had prepared into the hand of her son Jacob and she came unto and he came unto his father and said my father and he said Here Am I who art thou my son and Jacob said unto his father I am Esau see he was a liar he didn't care what he had to do it didn't matter he wanted the birthright he amen I am Esau thy firstborn I have done according as thou baest me arise I pray thee sit and eat of my venison that thy soul may bless thee and Isaac said unto his son how is it that thou has found it so quickly my son he was surprised that all of a sudden you know because he had just told Isaac but listen what he says because the Lord thy God brought it to me that you think he was lying no I don't think no you see God had spoken to ra uh uh Rebecca and made it very clear to her that that the younger was going to serve the older she had a revelation of this and so she was led by God that's why she went to to Jacob and she says Now you listen to what I'm going to tell you I'm going to command you what you have to do and Jacob if you go back and read Jacob was afraid he says wait a minute how can I do that you know he's going to recognize this and that no you listen to what I'm going to tell you you do what I'm going to tell you and Jacob he he obeyed and it was God actually that that that placed it on him to do what he had to do amen sometimes you're wondering about your life and you're wondering why I did this and why did I have to go this way and why did I have to go that way God was directing you and leading you to your promised word I have I asked the Lord all the time you waited till I was 33 years old before you came and intervened in my life and what a mess what a mess but God had a purpose in it all now I can really identify with Jacob amen let's read on and Isaac said unto Jacob come near me I pray thee that I may feel thee my son whether thou be my very son Esau or not see he was questioning in in his mind just like within the message of the hour there's there there there's questioning going on right now amongst amongst the Believers you know there's fighting going on amongst the Believers there's there's there's you know uh the the headquarters of of this message a worldwide you know uh Corporation that's doing such great things but yet there's confusion within the body of that of this ministry think about it Saints Isaac was old he was you know this message it's already 63 years old I'm talking about the the Revival of the opening of those Seven Seals because that's what we're under that's what's placing us that's what's identifying us that's the church that we've been called to under that seventh seal Church you need to study we're going to be doing a complete study on the Seven Seals it's all coming up I'm excited about it he says and Jacob went near unto Isaac his father and he felt him and said the voice is Jacob's voice but the hands are the hands of Esau because Rebecca had put you know the hair because Esau was such a hairy person and Rebecca had covered him put a covering on him to disguise him and he discerned him not you see that he discerned him not he was not able to identify because God had already made it clear that the blessing was going to go to Jacob regardless and you cannot override God's purpose and plan and even you as a son or a daughter of God you will not be confused the word will become plain to you you will know exactly who you are where you stand in the word of God in this day and in this hour and you will not fall to the confusion that is even taking place within the message of this hour than and he discerned him not because his hands were hairy and his brother Esau's hands as his brother Esau's hands so he blessed him so I want you to realize here that Isaac was under the anointing of God whether he was old whether he was in the condition he was in it it all had a purpose because the scripture says in Hebrews 11:20 by faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come even Esau received his Blessing but the blessing was to Jacob and it was through him that the nations of the world would continue God's chosen Nation amen so yet the Lord through Jacob a deceiver had different plans than what Isaac himself even knew let's read the next quote and that Spirit of that one birth is still represented in the world today and it's coming to a head now the spiritual believer and the carnal believer carnal believer no one could say they wasn't both religious they're both religious people within the Christian church and within this church and every message Church they're religious in their carnal spiritual battle amen spiritual believer and carnal believer no one could say they wasn't both religious they were they didn't say that one served an idol and the other one God they were both Servants of God now pay close attention to the scriptures now on this subject because I'm sure it'll help you see now not everyone that saith Lord Lord will enter in but the one that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven now if you notice Jacob had one thing that he wanted because according to the word the blessing and the good thing laid in the birth right and that's one thing that you as a true son or daughter of God you will desire to know the word to have an experience with the word a real experience with God Amen praise God and so uh he goes on here and he makes it very clear that the blessing is in the birthright so now Esau separates from Jacob God shows Isaac now to call Jacob before we go to that Hebrews 12:14 the next scripture here I want you to notice something here that Esau in his condition he came and wanted the blessing he wanted to receive the blessing from God and so it shows here follow peace with all men in Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby uh many be defiled he's talking about you know your own Spirit be aware lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau who for one morsel of meat sold his Birthright for you know how that afterwards when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears there's going to be many that are going to come right to the last day that are going to realize that they didn't have the right birth that there was nothing that they could do to get it because God by election God by predestination has called each and every one of you individually amen and you're and you've got this struggle that's within you which is the two Natures your greatest battle is going to always be in your mind because that Esau spirit that Esau nature will emotionalize with the world but the Jacob nature will want the word of God Amen and so Paul said when I am trying to do good because of these two Natures that were constantly there Paul said he says uh when I'm trying to do good evil is present it's these two Natures fighting within you the Beast nature which was injected back in the Garden of Eden through the original sin and then the nature of Christ which is in that attribute that's been with you and in you from before the foundations of the world and you cannot suppress God's attributes amen the denominational religions especially the Catholic Church they you know uh the the all the the the Protestant churches they all have a very strong Esau spirit it's all about works and it's true you see whenever there's any natural disasters that take place these people can send millions and millions of dollars in Aid you've got the Salvation Army they can do all those things but those are religious organizations with an Esau spirit because the moment that you bring them the pure unadulterated word of God they despise it you tell them about the New Birth have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and they turn around and say I was B I was baptized as a baby that's not what we're asking do you want the right birth because if you get the right birth you're going to have the right heart you're going to be able to live for Christ because you love him you've fallen in love with him you've you've come into a relationship with him him amen the problem is regardless they can never have a Jacob Spirit they could never have that desire for the right birth because it was not placed in them from before the foundations of the world the biggest deception in this hour and even within the the ranks of this message is getting people to preach the the the same things over and over that the prophet preached but it's not about just quoting the prophet or listening to the prophet it's having a revelation of what the prophet was saying and the word of God that he was fulfilling in his day in order to bring our day not having a revelation of the current message still surrounding that Birthright because remember every message is the Holy Ghost in its day to birth Sons and Daughters of God to the to what God is doing now that's what the word is sent for every dispensation has a word that's going to Quicken the Sons and Daughters of God into their position in the word of God Amen it's always being about the birthright that is why when Jesus was on Earth he said you must be Born Again people are putting the Born Again experience based on God sent a prophet the Seven Seals were open but they're not basing it on an experience and a reality amen they'll base it on an altar call because they went to a to a to a youth camp or or they went to some special camp meetings and and there was an altar call and they they went to the Altar and they and they figured that that that was good enough you need to know that you know that that there's a reality to God's word that has called you and placed you into the local Body of Christ to fulfill your part in the word of God accepting the word for your day but you know the word without Revelation it'll never stand in your life you can impersonate all you want you'll never be satisfied you'll fuss and you'll fight you'll fuss and fight over quotes you'll fuss and fight over scripture but the true son the true daughter of God they're not Fighters they're Believers and they know that the word is not something that you can give to somebody it's God that opens the understanding it's God that awakens and brings you into your position amen the reality of the word the open book it's become a reality in your life amen it's not about preaching signs and wonders and miracles it's about God coming personal to you knowing that he's a reality amen revealed to you personal signs and wonders they were all under the first and second pull of the Prophet it was all to the flesh to the mind but the third pull is about the attribute the election that's in you the one that God says I love yes the one that's ordained to eternal life can't miss it even if you wanted to miss it amen a true son or daughter of God will desire the word and never deny it there's no way that they could ever deny it and we're not talking about being religious because religion is only a covering a True Believer will desire the word and believe the word and believe the word for their day they'll want to know what God is doing now not what God is going to do down the road not what God has done in the past but wanting to know exactly what God is doing right now in my life amen praise God you might be a Jacob right now that isn't living right you'll still lie you'll still cheat but when it comes down to it you will eventually submit to God's word you will surrender to God's will in your life you will come to a place where you will have to surrender because the enemy will surround you you know that when when when sin is at your door it's because you're you're entertaining things you're either trying to do right or you've gone right into the devil's backyard and you've opened yourself to to to attacks of the enemy but God will bring his word right back regardless of your condition Hallelujah let's go to our next scripture here Genesis 32 verse 22 now here now we're going to see Jacob 's conversion and he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two women servants and his 11 sons and passed over the Ford Jabbok and he took them and sent them over the brook and sent over that he had and Jacob was left alone and there Wrestled a man with him until the breaking of day next and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh now this is where Jacob gets sent Now by his father to leave Canaan and to go and find himself a wife okay and he and so he he goes and he's he's on his road and he had to travel over 400 miles and he's on his road to go and find himself a wife and while he's on this journey I want you to see yourselves in in in your journey where you actually meet God because he met he met God and when he saw that he prevailed not against him the Lord touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint and he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day breth and he said I will not let thee go except thou bless me you see Jacob had come to a place where he knew that God had given him the blessing and now he was wrestling with God and you're going to come to a place in your walk where you're going to have to wrestle with God you're going to have to overcome all the old nature all the things that have held you down and have have have uh been a hindrance in your life and you're going to have to trust God you're going to have to stay there until God fully delivers you amen and he says I'm not going to let you let you go except thou bless me and he said unto him what is thy name and he said Jacob and he said thy name shall be called No More Jacob but Israel for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men and has prevailed amen praise God hallelujah so what are we seeing here we're seeing something let's read the next quote and Jacob in the message desperations and Jacob rather in desperation he said I know I feeled you you're here with me but I'm not going to let you go somebody sees it fine the first little sensation and they get up and jump up and down run up the aisle and say I got it I got it he says oh no uh-uh no Jacob stayed there until something happened that made him walk different made him a different person because that he stayed until that happened and you're going to need to get desperate in your walk with God if you want to really know that you know you're going to need to come to a place where you are ready to to to completely surrender unto the Lord amen not just by one sensation not by just one experience but that you will you'll you'll keep pressing on and pressing through to know that God is is definitely a part of your life and has a desire and a plan for you amen glory to God and so Jacob stayed there until something happened that made him walk different made him a different person because that he stayed until that happened and he was able the Bible says he held until he prevailed he can he can a man how can a man Prevail over God but you can do it you can do it a man can Prevail over God if you stay there long enough if you have that desire within your heart to overcome those situations in your life and you need the Lord to to set you free and deliver you from those those circumstances those bondages those bad experiences those things that that that that have held you back traditions of your past genealogy and your you're you know this is something that came down from my mom or my dad no you are born again you're a brand new creation in Christ and you can Prevail with God if you will stay there and trust him and go through amen praise God hallelujah our churches need to have individuals with real genuine births amen with changed new hearts and our children need to be born again too just like you like every true son and daughter of God needs to be born again so does our children have to be born again amen parents you need to set the right example you need to come into the real understanding of our kids you you could bring them kids up with so much impersonation you want to you want to make them you know self-righteous do you realize that that's what that does is when you force them that you got to live this way you got to dress this way you you when you go to school you got to dress this way and you got to be this way and you know and and you're and what you're actually doing is you're teaching them self-righteousness instead of allowing them to just experience the atmosphere that you create in your personal relationship with God this relationship is not based on law are you telling me that we got to serve God because we have to that's not a relationship with God you know what that produces an Esau spirit because all of a sudden it's all about works oh I go to church that's good enough no they need to have their own experience they're going to need to repent at some point of something and I'm not saying they got to go out there in sin that's not what I'm saying but you need to understand that the true Born Again experience is not something that we create in our children Jacob and and Rebecca had two sons or uh Isaac and Rebecca had two sons and one was a conniver and the other one was was a was a a a somebody that wanted despised his Birthright but yet in in one of those children there was election and even though they that you know some of our children and some of you you still acting out that e that that Jacob spirit in your lives where you're in that that condition and some of our children are in that condition where they're they're they're they're connivers or whatever you know they'll come and lie right to your face and you know that they're lying but understand that if God wants to get a hold of them them they will change and they will have a genuine birth amen praise God Allelujah people in the message churches have many actors in them there's more actors there's more Esau actors than there are actual Desiring the the pure unadulterated word of God Impostors things coming into the churches the love of money and and and and breaking up you know churches and brothers fighting against brothers and all kind because Satan this is the hour where it would be so deceiving that it would deceive the very elect the Bible said that Esau hated Jacob now could a son or daughter of God actually hate his brother or sister if you're a son or a daughter of God in this message no way you you're not going to get caught up into the fighting and into the fussing of the message and and start fighting over this and fighting over that that's all Pride that's all Pride that's got a hold of the people this is a reality to the true Sons and Daughters of God and their desire is strictly for the word to recognize what their part in the word is amen you're your soul is the nature that is in you and if there's a lust or a pride Spirit or whatever it is in that in that nature it needs to be it needs to be annihilated and only the true birth can do that amen you need Christ if you're going to make it out of here no other way Sons and Daughters of God and Jesus took all of our sin and nailed it to the Cross so don't you be trying to do it yourself you need to accept what he's already done amen praise God only then will you be able to give him your heart Hallelujah if I was to ask you know a lot of you young people in here do you have a desire to be the wife of a deacon or a deacon or a minister or a minister's wife is that what like think about it this message is the message of the Rapture it's the only message that will bring perfect faith for the Rapture and if you've got a true desire in your heart for this word you will stay within the boundaries of the word you will not desire to go outside of this word why do you think Isaac made it so clear when he would tell his his uh his son and he' say go and find yourself a wife and go and find her out of our own body now we know that that God works I I was telling my wife I said my God I said look at the the grace of God in our lives that God we didn't even know anything about God we didn't know nothing about this message we knew nothing and God led us and and and you know our paths came together we had to come together today we're husband and wife after 39 years and we're in the service of the Lord that was just pure grace and God can do that anytime he wants to do it amen praise God but we are honing down now we're coming into the final stretch of this word of this revelation of the true church and people are are are are are are are falling away leaving the message believing that now believing that God never even sent a prophet not believing the cloud in 1963 they're they're they're just leaving the message because they have no true revelation of the message but if you have a true revelation of this message you will know that there's absolutely nowhere for you to go but they put on so much law on the people and and and and they're coming to church and their only purpose in going to church is because they have to go that's not the kind of relationship that God is is having right now with his true church amen glory to God we don't have to pressure people we don't have to pressure our children we don't have to pressure nobody God adds to the church such as should be saved and as long as we are preaching the pure unadulterated word of God from this Pulpit then we will have children that will be birthed by the word of God because if they have representation they have to come Jesus said all that the father hath given me will come we don't need to be a dictator I thank God for our pastor our former Pastor John Simon that he allowed us to walk with God he allowed us to have our own experiences with God he allowed us to make the mistakes that we had to make amen praise God a real Pastor has a desire to see births see genuine uh uh transformation taking place within the lives of the people not dictators not you know that you know a pastor that that puts so much law on the people is because he's afraid he's afraid of the reproach he doesn't want to have to deal with broken lives and he doesn't want to have to deal with broken situations but listen as long as I'm the pastor of this church I am going to preach the word of God and the word of God will call and place every single son and daughter of God according to God's purpose and plan amen that's all that I'm obligated to do I'm just like you just like anybody else I need God to feed me so that I can feed you amen I'm feeding on the word of God I I I read the word of God I'm just I'm I'm just uh you know Desiring to know that that you know there's a constant indication that God is in our midst amen and God will add to the church God will deal with the individuals in this church I don't have to go babysitting and watching your lives and what you're doing and questioning you about this or questioning you about that that's not a real true experience with God you've got to come into your own walk with God your own personal relationship amen glory to God a Shepherd he's he's fearless and he's not afraid to get messed he's not a I'm not afraid of of mess I'm telling you right now if we ever go to war I'm I'm one of the guys you want on your team I'll be the first one on the field and I'll be the last one off because I trust in the Living God God will keep us just like he said to Joshua be strong and courageous I'll be with you I'll be with you even un the end I believe that that same God is with us here today and if we can believe that word and trust him in that way then we will not surrender to the enemy we will not allow the enemy to take our children we will not allow the enemy to take any not one hoof amen praise God we're going to trust him we're going to we're going to walk with him but we're going to allow God to deal with each one of us individually glory to God thank you Lord this is the hour of maturity Saints the bride's Revival for this hour let the musicians come started in 1963 we're going to finish this next week okay the Revival started in 1963 with the opening of the seventh seal now this is why we are going to be going into a full study of the Seven Seals and we are going to be trusting the Lord that he's going to reveal to us exactly where each and every one of us are placed within the body of Christ because that's what the seventh seal does remember the seventh seal was the coming of the Lord it was him coming to the Earth to take possession of a five-fold Ministry it was no longer going to be a one-man Ministry the prophet had to decrease so that he could increase and that's why this this message for this day and for this hour is not about that God sent a prophet it's about that God sent a prophet so that Christ could come and open the seals so that he could reveal the mystery that he's been holding in the back of his mind from before the foundations of the world and that is that he's going to have a people that are going to be consecrated called placed know exactly who they are where they fit in the word of God who they are are in in the local body oh we're going to hone this right down we're going to want listen you didn't get called to this church Church to be a church member yeah we hear in every Church there's three kinds of Believers guess what we don't need those unbelievers and make Believers in here we need True Believers that are going to surrender their lives and give themselves completely holy over unto the Lord because this is the quick short work that we're entering into now this is the time where the bride has taken the book she knows the word has been open to her she recognizes her position in the word she realizes that now she's the one that's actually Christ on Earth speaking his word bringing to pass calling placing positioning perfecting the body until they all come into the unity of Christ she's the one that's come into that position and that's the only Revival that is now taking place and it will cause a separation yes it's going to cause a separation you're you're going to you're going to know the difference not because I'm telling you because the spirit of God is going to come upon you and it's going to open the understanding in such a way where you are going to realize that now you know as the word progresses remember the the Lord raises a standard God is his own interpreter how do you know that it's God he comes in you and he manifests himself through you amen and all of a sudden your thoughts are lined up with the scripture and the Revelation that's coming out of the scripture is identifying you that you are actually who God says you are you're not seeing yourself as Esau you're able to see the Esau's
