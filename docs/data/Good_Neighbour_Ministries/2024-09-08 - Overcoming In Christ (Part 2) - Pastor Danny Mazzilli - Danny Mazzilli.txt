happy to be in this house this morning to give him thanks listen to give him praise Hallelujah yesterday I was just reading Psalms 145 and David was talking about the greatness of God and there was these five words popped out that gave the distinct characteristics of God and it says it was God's goodness God's greatness God's goodness God's glory God's guaranteed and God's grace and I took some scriptures to match them it says God's greatness great is the Lord and worthy of praise His greatness is no one can fathom great is the Lord and greatly to be praised and his greatness is unsearchable God's goodness the Lord is good to all his compassion on all he has made God's glory they will tell of the glory of your kingdom and speak of your might so that all men might know your Mighty acts and the Glorious Splendor of your kingdom and this is one of my favorites here God's guarantee he says your kingdom is Everlasting Kingdom and your Dominion endures you you know when you buy something you get a guarantee but you only get probably two years 5 years this is eternal guarantee and the last one God's grace the Lord upholds all those who fall and lift up all those that are bow down to him

excited to be in the house of the Lord amen uh especially after such a tremendous week that we've had um you know we had such a wonderful time in the presence of the Lord last weekend we just didn't want it to end amen the services just kept getting better and better and um you know but can we expect anything less from the Lord you know when the Lord wants to do something when he wants to bless his people when he wants to uh speak and to meet our need needs he just does it that's what makes him so great amen praise God forever more and so um I want to welcome all of our guests and all of our uh friends praise God that are here with us this morning welcome into the house of the Lord amen let me just quickly fix this some reason it gets a bit of interference here in the mornings when I set up praise God but that's okay interference just gives us something to overcome praise God there it is okay good amen so uh how many enjoyed the services last weekend praise God Amen brother Maxwell uh I was in touch with him this week and um he says I'm still rejoicing myself he says uh what a wonderful group of Believers he said may the Lord just uh you know continue to prosper such a wonderful Ministry he just felt so blessed to be a part of the weekend he said there was such faith and and such a pull um he's a fine young man I believe the Lord is going to uh do great things with our brother amen he's uh he's certainly gifted with that uh with that Ministry of evangelism and um you know that's what uh the fivefold ministry is all about amen and when you know you when when you experience that you know you've experienced it you know that it's it's the gift of God it's the supernatural that comes into the midst and starts to discern situations and uh just light fires and you know uh refresh and renew now we know that he was speaking to the young people but who's not a young person here like like like like you think that all of a sudden there's a difference when it comes to the attributes of God that God's uh speaking you know to the older ones the younger ones yes there are believers that are you know like sheep Lambs they just first come into the realization but that attribute inside of them is is the same age as you so this was a youth meeting but we're having a youth meeting this morning we're having an eternal youth meeting if you've come into the revelation of this hour you've come to realize that age is not something that God looks at amen praise God and so we were very blessed by the word of God every single one that was in here I know that if they were pulling and they were seeking God uh they received the word from the Lord they got something and um if you take that what you received and you apply it and you hold on to it and you believe it and you overcome you see this is the whole thing this is what um you know there's responsibility that comes with the word of God and your part is to overcome and it's not in the way that you might think okay the overcoming in this hour we're going to be looking at it today we're gon to we're just going to continue where we left off last time but um uh we were certainly blessed by brother uh Miguel amen when he brought the word on Saturday morning that was just a tremendous word of God and uh I know that I was immensely blessed and I know many of you were um you took it and you applied it into your life into your experiences because that's what he brought he brought one of his life experiences and that's really you know the message of the hour when you really uh you know you start to recognize who you are as a son or a daughter of God you start to realize that you're actually having an experience with the Living God and then how you edify the body of Christ is through your experience uh with the the the rest of the body and coming into fellowship and recognizing you know the Living God in our midst amen and last weekend you know the the theme that the Lord laid heavily upon my heart was calling out from a pure heart to them that call unto the Lord from a pure heart in other words you you want God to do something in your life amen you want to see the reality of what it is to serve the Living God not some churchgoing experience you know one day you're hot the next day you're cold one moment you're you're excited about God and the next day you're cursing God not this kind of experience the reality of God in your life amen glory to God so uh you know I believe that um uh we can continue to Feast on the word of God and and he's he's going to progress and continue right from where he left off last week if you have come here with the right understanding in your heart amen you didn't come here see me cuz I all you're going to see is you know Danny misilli the one you've known for many many years you you're going to see some of my flaws you know you're going to see if you know me really well you you're going to know that I've got weaknesses and I've got strengths you know everybody's got strengths and weaknesses amen but we didn't come here to to see that we didn't come here to show up because we just want to show up in church and show that we come to church on a regular basis I trust that you've come here this morning because you want God to speak to your needs and you don't want to leave here the same way you came in you want to go back out there and face life with confidence amen because you can't overcome without him in this day amen that's what we're going to be looking at amen praise God and so we're excited amen um next uh uh next Sunday okay you keep brother Christopher in prayer cuz he's going to be praying okay I will be here but I'm going to be away for the latter part of the week and I'll be getting back on Saturday night and so Sunday morning we will certainly be here but uh keep brother Christopher in prayer that the Lord will just continue how how many enjoyed the service on Wednesday night amen praise God women of the Bible praise God what a what a type Rahab amen I can't help but see my own life in Rahab all over everywhere oh a lot of people say oh yeah oh no I don't see myself in Rahab she was a she was a harlot she was a prostitute you take a close look at your life you're going to find out you're worse amen but God's grace amen thank you Jes God's grace came at that appointed time and season amen praise God I'm enjoying that series brother Christopher we will certainly continue to pray that the Lord just continue to bring out some wonderful nuggets for the Sons and Daughters of God Amen um we have a visiting Minister that'll be coming on the following Sunday don't don't worry you know we've got lots of visitors and so forth the Lord knows all about it okay and um and it's good you know you just put yourself under expectation we're going to have brother uh Fabian Palma he's from South America he's going to be here in the week of uh September M the he'll be here on Sunday September 22nd um I believe that we're going to be blessed through his ministry amen so uh keep it in prayer we also have brother kidre Diggs that's going to be passing through he got in touch with me this week he says brother I'm I'm going to be in Ontario uh just passing through midweek and uh I said oh well praise God we happen to have a midweek service and so uh we invited him to minister and he was very happy happy to be able to come and visit with us on October the 9th Wednesday October 9th you will receive uh um a communication on that but uh you know we're looking forward to that amen praise God so just be in prayer trust the Lord and believe amen glory to God so this morning you know I get a call from one of my customers and uh you know we got to talking and you know all of a sudden the Lord came up in the discussion I've never talked about the Lord with this individual but I've known him for several years because he calls me uh every year right around this time and so um he uh you know got to telling me about uh uh you know I was telling him about my experience with because he asked me he says well what do you do like the rest of the year I said well I'm a minister and I'm a pastor now at a church in Burlington what oh yeah I said yeah I said uh um um um pastoring a church now in Burlington Ontario and you know right away and you know and he says how in the world I said I said I've been I've been serving the lord for 30 years what he's an Italian right they get you know they get like flabbergasted some so you're a Catholic then I said no no I brought I was brought up in Roman Catholicism but then I became born again I became a Christian a real Christian you know born and and uh affect by the word of God and and my life was transformed you know about 30 years ago I told him about a little bit of my life and the addiction and all of a sudden he says wait a minute here he says I got a nephew that's that's that's that's addicted to crack cocaine he says my sister's been putting him in and out of out of Rehabilitation he's going back again this month again he's heading there now he says he says you think you can help him I said I said if the Lord wants to help him I believe with all of my heart that God can can turn his life around and change his life he says oh he says well praise you know he didn't say praise God he says well well you know what I'm going to talk to my sister I'm going to you know let her know uh you know about you and your your experience and maybe maybe you can talk to him and I said be happy to talk to him if he wants to talk to me you know and I shared with him that you know that I've had those experiences where other people were affected in the same way and we spoke to them and the Lord interceded in their lives and did transform them and set them free and to this day like you can you remember uh Frank um you know that came here six or seven years ago he was addicted to cocaine and today up until just a few weeks ago you know he's on the streets preaching Jesus Christ that he's a Healer that he's a a savior he's received his experience and he's fulfilling his part in the word of God amen amen praise God and so I told him I said Mike I said we're going to remember your nephew what's his name he says Michael filipo I said all right we're going to remember him so as we go to prayer now and we uh start the service we certainly want to remember Michael filipo that the Lord will um start a work in his life he doesn't know that we're praying for him but his uncle had enough him to to cry out for his sister and his nephew amen and I believe God can do anything he can start a work there uh and stir Michael's life and wherever he is right now so let's just pray let's just let's all stand amen praise God father what a privilege and what an honor it is to to testify of your greatness your goodness your mercy your love your grace towards each and every one of us Lord and even those that are caught in the traps of this life Lord because that's what we know that they are we come to this world we we were born into this world like you said there's a time to be born and Lord and then there's a time for all things and Lord here father we we go through life's journey and we we we get trapped sometimes into the traps of the enemy whether it be addictions or Lord the lust of the flesh or the the pride of life and all the things that try to take a hold of our lives and Lord we find ourselves at times of desperation and Lord here an uncle crying out for his nephew and for his sister and their family Lord and Lord you know the situation we don't have to pinpoint and identify him Lord his name is filipo uh Michael filipo you know where he is right now Lord may your spirit as we pray and believe together may your spirit go and start a work in his life that somehow Lord a testimony would come back lord to to show that you are God and that you are sovereign and that you can decide you Lord you can touch you can heal you're the Savior you said you said that you so Lov the world that all that would call Upon Your Name Lord that that anybody that would call upon your name father Lord may you hear that cry when comes out of Michael Lord may you uh answer that call and may you meet that family in their distress and in their need this morning Father Lord you know every uplifted hand here in the house father there's many needs in our midst and Lord we've come this morning to receive your word so that we can leave strengthened and encouraged and to know that the challenges that we will face we can not have to face them alone but that you will come and overcome in us through us with us in all that we have to face Lord just let your word have free Liberty this morning speak to every need in our hearts and in our lives Lord speak to those that are on the air this morning on YouTube that are listening in Lord may your grace be extended to them Father Lord we just want to share our experience with you Lord and Lord give us utterance this morning that it might touch lives Grant it anoint your word anoint the speaker and anoint us to have ears to hear what the spirit is saying granted father we pray in Jesus name amen praise God let's read our scripture from 1 John CH 5: 4 to7 for who soever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith amen it's it's Faith replace that word with Revelation you need a revelation of everything that we're going to read here everything that we're going to speak on this morning the foundation of it is God revealing it personal to you amen without that Foundation there is no overcoming amen amen praise God true overcoming so and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God this is he that came by water and blood even Jesus Jus Christ not by water only but by water and blood and it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth for there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are a trinity no no these three are one amen here ye oh Israel the Lord thy God is one amen amen you may be seated praise God you see without you knowing who you're actually praying to how can you even get anywhere how can you get anywhere if if you're praying to an unknown God when he is in this day made himself known unto a people and that people have decided that they're going to that they're not going to just hold it and keep it to themselves because in every age when the Lord Jesus revealed himself to any individual that individual would cry out and let the people know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's a reality he's not a God that's just written in a book but he's the Living Word he's God he's Jehovah and his name name is the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise God you know John was was was uh writing the word here and under the inspiration he was saying that whosoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh it's faith and to know and to believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God not a second person but that Jesus the Jehovah of the Old Testament was made flesh the the word came and was made flesh that's why the Father the word and the Holy Ghost they're the same PE they're the same person it's just that God in heaven had to manifest himself and come to fulfill his own word and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us so that he could take on a vessel of Flesh and here John is he's clarifying like he's saying like Listen by not by water only every everybody that's born that comes into this world you know when a woman uh gives birth the water breaks amen and and then comes the and then comes the blood and then comes the child amen praise God and we know that that's all a type that that's the reality of the experience here but Jesus Christ was more than just water and blood there was a spirit that Beed record amen and the blood was a was a was a revelation that he was not not coming just as as God but he was coming as God in man so that he could go to Calvary as a man and yet God was in the man he wasn't just an ordinary so that he could go to Calvary and die for our sins so that we could be saved the whole Christian experience is based on this without the without the cross there is no salvation there is no church this morning there is no uh uh preaching on the word of God and overcoming then we're just like the rest of the world and this world is in chaos right now they're going into tribulation this world is not going to get any better it's actually going to get worse and you're going to need to be in Christ in order to overcome what's coming into this world world and what's happening right now around us amen praise God and so we need to recognize that amen so John was was uh showing here that he didn't only come by water it's not only by baptism you know a lot of people think that oh well I was baptized you know I can be I'm I'm I'm saved I got baptized as a baby you know making the word of God of none none effect because of man's Traditions but the scripture says very clearly that you need the water and you need the blood and you need the Holy Spirit to Bear record in your life to Bear record that you've had a true experience that you are a true Christian filled with the Holy Ghost in This Day and in this hour that has the ability to overcome the situations of this world and this life you will face challenges you will face situations that are that are sometimes life shattering Earth shattering relationship shattering Financial shattering all kinds of things that are going to come down upon people's lives but let me tell you you can overcome them if you're in Christ you can overcome them if you accept Christ as your Overcomer if you accept him as your lord and your savior amen hallelujah not just confessing it like the world says oh just confess that Jesus Christ is Lord and thou shalt be saved now there's going to be a lot of people that are going to be saved that are outside of the Bride but remember the category listen every age when Jesus Christ came to the Earth there was only a handful of people that actually recognized who he really was they were those that were predestinated elected to recognize the word in their day amen and All Through the Ages this last week we looked at all of that we looked at to them that overcame and every one of those ages you can go back and listen to that I'm not going to go over all of that now but but there were every age had to overcome every uh dispensation when where Christ was was condescending and himself to bring us to this day in this season where we're we're actually going to fulfill the Rapture remember that is our portion of the word that's the part that we're that we're fulfilling this is the hour that that we're in right now that this church that that is called out in this day and in this hour is going to be called into Christ they're going to be called they're going to they're going to recognize that they were in Christ not not just now but they were always in Christ before the foundations of the world but they got trapped into this human body and that they had to overcome the the themselves amen we're going to be looking at all that so that they could recognize that they are a son or a daughter of God an attribute of God if you're a son or a daughter of God you always were an attribute of God a part of God is is is a is is God okay now we're not going around and we're saying I am God I am God no you are one with God on that day he shall know that I am in the father ye in me and I in you it's not Jesus say it's not I that doeth the works the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works he was expressing that the Holy Ghost in him was fulfilling the word of God it'll take the Holy Ghost in you you got to receive the Holy Ghost how do you receive it repent be baptized you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and when he comes in you he's going to transform your life it won't be something that you need to do you see this is the whole thing that people are missing and and they're trying to do it by their own works by their own ability you don't you don't come to God God calls you in the time and in the season amen praise God and so let's move on now we want to go here listen to brother brandom no he says here now now this this uh quote struck me I listened to the message um you know how can I overcome and I suggest you do that this week if you get a chance go back listen to that message because everything that I've drawn I've drawn it out of that message most of it amen praise God and then the Holy Spirit can add whatever he likes in the midst of our our ministry here but he said says here I want to take my subject this morning of this how can I overcome now I chose this because that I think that it's a time that we should never let the spirit of Revival die I said man when I heard that it just it's just jumped right out of the tape and I stopped and I and I thought and I thought Lord Jesus hallelujah praise God you mean overcoming brings Revival yeah oh yeah you ever experiened when you when you deal with a situation and and you're and you're you're you're dealing with that and maybe it's been months maybe it's been years I don't know certain situations that you're overcoming in your life and then all of a sudden the Lord you know because you've you've stayed faithful you've you you continue to come to church even though you're battling you're fighting through it you're sometimes you're feeling dizzy you're feeling so discouraged and the the enemy is knocking you down but you keep pressing through you keep pressing through and then all of a sudden Victory comes and there's a Revival in your life amen there's Revival I believe that we're living in a day right now where there there's only one true Revival and that is in the bride of Christ it's in the people that are overcoming in this day and in this hour that have recognized that they've got something to to to to overcome if want their lives to be to to to to be effective to to allow God to do the supernatural in their lives they need to overcome brother Bram was saying here the spirit of Revival he says should never let the spirit of Revival die we got to keep in Revival constantly revived every day Paul said he had to Die daily that Christ could live and we must never let that Revival die within us he amen how do you keep the revival going you feed on the word of God how do you keep the revival going you testify that God is more than able to get me through this situation Jesus Christ is able to overcome my circumstances my financial burdens my health issues all the things my relationship issues all the things that I'm struggling with right now God is able to do it and when you overcome Revival starts to take place place the Dead starts to wake up in you the things that you feel like you're you you've lost the battle you feel dead in this area Life Starts coming back into it amen praise God and so this is the hour that that Revival is burning in the hearts of the True Believers amen they're they're they're ready to overcome they're they're ready to face the enemy because they know that when they overcome there's Victory amen praise God let's go to the next slide Matthew 4 now we're going to be looking here at uh at uh you know we're going to call this the three assaults okay but let's read the scripture then was Jesus led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward and hungered and when the tempter came to him he saidif thou be the Son of God command that these Stones be made bread' but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and sth him on a pinnacle of the temple and saith unto him if thou be the Son of God cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou Dash thy foot against a stone Jesus said unto him again it is written again Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and saith to him all these things will I give thee if thou wil Fall Down and Worship me then saith Jesus unto him get thee behind me Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve thankes glory to to God Amen and so what we're going to be looking at here today and what you know if there's anything that we want to make clear today and and and and make it you know stir you in your heart there's only one way that you will overcome and I mean truly overcome whatever it is that you're facing and that'll be by the word only by the word listen to The Prophet here we read this quote last week he says now what are we to overcome this is the normal question asked here but that is not the actual thought of this verse for it is not so much what we are to overcome but how we are to overcome now this is logical for does it matter what we are to overcome as long as we know how we can overcome a quick look at those scriptures which involve the Lord Jesus overcoming will bring out the truth of this proposition right in Matthew 4 wherein Jesus is tempted by the devil he overcame the personal Temptations of Satan by the word and by the word only right that's why a lot of people say you talk about the word too much you you you know you you lift up the word too much you read the word too much you quote the word too much that's our sword and our shield in this day in this hour you see that's what the enemy has done out there that's right he's made the word of none effect listen to what Jesus told you go back to St John chapter 6 Jesus rebuked the Pharisees and the Sadducees and all the high Priests of that day he rebuked them he said you've made the word of God of none effect to the people because of your Traditions when somebody comes to me and says oh Danny I go to church I go to church on Sunday I do the 14 Stations of the Cross you might as well go run the track that'll at least profit you a little bit more than than than than walking the 14 Stations of the Cross Jesus already walked out for you you need to accept the death not the suffering but the death and when you accept the death then then there will be some suffering that will come in your life uh because you're going to have to stand the reproach to stand for the word that said you need Jesus Christ in the present stage of his ministry not a historical Jesus but the one that's here this morning that's speaking right here this morning by the inspiration of the holy spirit amen praise God and so here now he says he overcame the personal Temptations of Satan by the word of and by the word only in each of the three major trials that corresponded exactly to the Temptation Of The Garden of Eden the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life Jesus overcame by the word now look what he says here Eve fell to the personal Temptation Of Satan by failing to use the word Adam fell in direct Disobedience to the word Adam knew exactly what he was doing because Adam is a perfect type of Jesus Christ he saw that his church his bride that's why when you talk about the church you're talking about the bride of Christ it's always a type in the scriptures well Adam's bride was Eve and she fell to the lies of the enemy he came and tempted her go you shall not sure die if you feed from me you eat from me in other words you hear my words and you take my words and you listen to what I'm going to tell you and he he just you know you can go back and it tells you Eve was deceived in the scripture not Adam Eve was deceived by the by the by by the sub serpent who was an upright man and could talk not a snake he was turned turned into a snake as a part of his curse but he was an upright man because you can go back listen people say you know 6,000 years we say the Bible is 6,000 years old but Time and Eternity you know the earth the earth could be a hundred billion years old there was no death prior to Eve falling and being deceived and Adam being taken into it with his wife and death Came Upon the Earth there was no death Adam and Eve could have been in the Garden of Eden there was no even years there was no time time wasn't even an element time only is relevant to us because we die if there was no death what what what what what's time if you didn't age and you and you never died time would have no significance well Adam and Eve were in the image of God they were in their theophany bodies Eternal bodies that were expressed from God Amen and they were living and could have been there for a 100 million years before the serpent showed up and said hey you know because now God wanted to express salvation he wanted to be a savior so in order for him to be a savior something had to fall there's nothing out of cater here we are in the plan of Redemption we've just been awakened to recognize that whole plan and where we fit into it today and so here now the uh you know Eve was deceived by The Serpent and death came into Humanity amen praise God so this Eve because now he's going to have a church in this day and in this hour that is going to be without spot or wrinkle because she cannot be deceived she's the part of God she's the Eve that can never be deceived because he is going to go right back to the state that they were in before the fall did you know that Adam his name both Adam and Eve both of them were were in Adam when when Adam was made in the the image of God and God said and called their name Adam there was only one that's why when a husband and a wife join here naturally spiritually they are one they are one okay well that's what we're being restored back to that's what that's who the bride in this day the the church in this day she's come into the unity and the and the relationship of Jesus Christ her and the her and Christ becoming one amen okay that's why he says on that day ye shall know that I am in the father ye in me and I in you this is that day so this eve will not fall because Christ is in her amen she will overcome because she's in Christ amen hallelujah thank you Jesus let's keep going here so we're going to be looking at the three assaults okay you can go to the next slide okay so here listen so we're going to look at these three assaults and we're just going to go over them briefly and you're going to you're going to see certain things there and you know if you see yourself somewhere and how the enem is kind of attacking you in one of these assaults then you know just say hallelujah thank you Jesus that's me I receive that I'm going to allow that to be the word that's going to give me the overcoming power amen because remember it's the word in you but the word needs to be that needs needs to be stirred within you it needs to be brought to the surface your conscious mind and that attribute of God needs to come into the into the uh you know uh connection there where where all of a sudden you say I see it it's because the Revelation is being revealed unto you now listen here in the message how I how can I overcome brother Braham says now his 40 days of Temptation by God's word he overcome and I want to express something here just for a few minutes Satan made three major assaults on him in that Temptation now watch it's always in them three don't forget it see he made three major assaults from the highest to the lowest he tried his best to conquer him but he was the word amen he was the word what did he use himself the word Satan's three major attacks or assaults upon him but he met it with the word every attack he could make it with the word watch this now from the highest to the lowest amen so the first he made his attack upon to use his great power he says now which he know he was the word you don't you don't think Jesus knew who he was when he was here he knew exactly who he was he said I come to do the will of my father amen and if you've got the word in you then you're going to come to a place where you're going to want the will of the father in your life you're going to want his will in your circumstances you're going to want only his desire and his will for everything that you're facing amen you see this is the part of of of the overcoming he know he was the word he knowed his position he believed he did and the congregation says amen the son of man he knowed his position and Satan come and want him to use his own power on himself to feed him want to feed himself he was hungry a man gets hungry he can do almost anything he'll steal Rob beg borrow anything see he had the appetite and Satan used his first major assault upon him to take his power that he had been given to overcome with the use of it on himself he didn't use it on himself no he did he used it on others that's right he used it on others not himself it wasn't for him though he could have done it he certainly could have done it the Lord has given you gifts the Lord has placed you into the body of Christ your life once you've been placed into this Kingdom the mystical Body of Christ by a birth by an experience by a reality that you've met God face to face he places you in the body and he gives you a position in the body am and when you recognize your position and that he has placed you there and that he says now I'm going to operate that gift through you you overcome yourself and you allow that gift to take a hold of you when he wants to use it and when he wants to bring you into the house of the Lord and he shows you that you're in the media that you're in the cleaning committee that you're in the Sunday school and that you're operating in all these different areas of the body of Christ you surrender to it by humbling yourself to the Holy Ghost that's in you that's placing you and now Satan cannot tempt you he cannot use your position against the body of Christ but for the body of Christ not for your own benefit because just the fact that you've overcome and that you've surrendered to Christ you benefit amen you've overcome and you get Victory through that amen so you're going to need to really examine yourself okay as we're going through this examine yourself see where it is that that the enemy's got a hold of you in your mind somewhere somehow he's deceived you to believe certain certain things that that are that are outside of the word of God usually there are things that are that are that are uh uh you know to please this to please yourself look to see if it's if it's you know uh the lust of the flesh or or or the pride of life or or the lust of the eyes it's somewhere somehow listen until we die out to Jesus Christ in our lives we're going to constantly have to overcome ourselves that's your greatest enemy that's who we're talking to here remember he Satan went to Eve in the Garden of Eden and he knew that she was going to be weak by disbelieving by by by Desiring according to her own flesh she she desired to be like God he said oh but the day that you eat thereof you will be like God in other words he was trying to pervert that you could be a creator because I could inem because it was adultery that took place in the Garden of Eden he he deceived Eve made love to her and injected seed in there that brought forth Cain amen he that's that's what he you know you can be like God you can create like God look at God created all of these things you can be a Creator that's why God you know he'll you know he'll he'll pervert even Believers and oh you can speak anything you can speak this speak that and if you ain't got the character and your boss gets you mad you're trying to speak him under a car because you don't have the character or the ability to recognize what it is to really be in the throne with him amen praise God so you know your reasoning will try to get you to think what's in it for me attitude you know if I serve the Lord what's in it for me I'll tell you what's in it for you salvation a lot of people don't realize they you know people cry out scream why is this happening to me why is this happening to me and they'll they'll they'll Curse God not realizing that he is allowing them to go through that so that they can look to him for salvation am don't you want salvation from that pain don't you want salvation from that hurt don't you want salvation knowing like I can I can imagine there's people in Gaza in different parts of the Middle East there that are experiencing the atrocities and the terrible uh experiences that they're having they're crying out they're crying out and that cry needs to be to Jesus Christ because he's the only savior that can save the them from that Affliction amen so we want to we want to have the right attitude we we don't want to be looking at you know when we get hungry we're going to we're going to compromise on the word of God when we get when we get weak we're going to compromise on the word of God Jesus knew exactly who he was he knew that he had to go through these trials he knew that he had to face the enemy he knew that he had to suffer and you as a son or a daughter of God I'm telling you you need to know that you will have to overcome situations in your life but it's going to it's going to revive you it's going to strengthen you it's going to give you victory over the circumstances in your life amen praise God look at the second assault Brother Braham speaking here and how can I overcome he says now the second assault I'll hurry just look like the time goes so fast the next great assault was that he made upon him that he would be a showoff and how that does hit God's servants to be a showoff to show what you can do glory to God hallelujah I'm a deliverer I'm Soul see see come up here on top of the temple and sat down here he tempted him to do it now remember he was tempted to do it hard said now if you want to be something before the people stand up here on this Temple and jump off you know temp in Jesus to show that that you know that that that he could I can do anything you know you got Christians that you know you got to be careful you got to stay balanced you got to stay balanced when you're walking with the Lord and it's not easy Saints it's not easy praise God but you want to stay balanced you don't want to be you know uh you know like be zealous for the Lord but don't go tempting the Lord somebody comes up to you and says oh you're a Christian e well I got a snake over there it's a ronal snake it's my pet I dare you to put your hand into the cage and grab a hold of them that's just the devil it's the same devil that said to Jesus jump off the Hill somebody's going to grab you and you're not going to get hurt yeah we know the scripture says that that we can drink a poison and and and a serpent could bite us and any deadly thing will not harm us but it's not but did you read the Scripture it doesn't say you can go and tempt them you can go and tempt God because you're tempting God when you're doing that you're showing off you're trying to you're you're putting yourself you know before the people instead of putting God in in in there and standing on the word of God just like uh radshack mhach and Abednego when when when they when when Nebuchadnezzar said put him in the fire they didn't want to go into that furnace but they knew that God was a reality in their life and they knew that there was a gun to their head a sword to their head and they they were pushing them and put up the fire seven times and they walked in there but guess who was in there with them Jesus was there he was there before they were there amen and that's why when you face situations and you go into circumstances I want you to know that if you trust God with all of your heart and the situation arises Jesus will be meeting you there before you get there amen hallelujah glory to God now remember he was tempted to do it yes sir I'll give you a scripture for it because it's written he'd give Angels charge over thee uh now remember uh uh I'll give you a scripture he'll give the Angels charge over thee lest any time you dash a foot against a stone he'd bear thee up to make him a showoff to show his authority but you see how the devil gets the devil wants you to mind him the devil will try to distract you people will come and try to pull you away from you know tempt you in your faith oh you believe God e oh you believe this you believe that well what about this situation what about that and he'll point out situations that are in your life you need to know how to how to be still at those times you need to know how to trust God when the enemy comes and exposes things in your life and you know that you know that that it's a circumstance but you're just waiting on God you know that it's it's something that that that doesn't look really good right now but you're waiting on God you're trusting God and you're going to turn around you're going to say the Lord my God he is my healer oh you got cancer do you oh I thought you know I thought you were a Believer and that that God is your healer You're darn right he is he's my healer the doctor says I got cancer that's fine they've even diagnosed it and seen it in my body it's there it's in the X-ray yes sir but God is my healer and God has a time and a season for all things and he's the Lord God that giveth and the Lord God that taketh listen John the Baptist had a job to do but when God was done with him he allowed him to have his head sheared right off God is Sovereign God knows everything God knows why he allows everything to come into our lives but that doesn't change our stand doesn't change what we believe and how we are to overcome we overcome by the word nothing else will give us power to overcome but the word amen so he gets you he minding uh you know the devil wants you to mind him he minded only what the father said do that's what Jesus did he said that's right he said why Satan said it's written he'd give the Angels charge he said yes but it's also written see there you are see he knew who he was Satan did the thought runs deeper than what is wrote there see it's inspiration the kernel is on the inside and inside of you in that in that overcoming stand and testimony as a son or a daughter of God there's an inspiration that goes deeper and that's what's that's God that's the god that's in you that's the one that can overcome that can deal with that can that can heal your circumstances all of a sudden you wake up one day I remember I stood on this platform for for the first 10 years or so I can't remember how many years in pain constantly in pain playing my bass guitar having to sit down having to get up having to sit down every time that the that you know the pastor would would would say you have a need my God anytime I was standing over there that was the first thing that would come to my mind because the pain was on my mind it was constant it was a reality it was something that was real but I knew that God was a Healer and if it didn't happen this year it's going to happen next year or the year after and one day I'm standing up there and I don't even remember how many months had gone by and I'm going I got and that's gone it's gone you see you got to claim it you got to believe it and you got to stand until God interprets it don't put your own interpretation on how you're going to overcome just believe that greater is he that is in you than he that's in this world and that situation has to move it has to move in God's time I quote the scripture God makes all things beautiful in his time not my time you're distracted right now you're you're you're you're you're discouraged you're you're upset you know you're you know because sometimes you you talk to people and they get all upset and they're wondering why this is happening why this situation I said listen settle down let's get right back to the foundation here we got to go back and stand where God wants us to stand and that is on his word on his promises amen and until we come to that you're not going to overcome you're going to be battling you're gonna you're gonna one day you're you're all excited and the next day the devil takes a shot at you and right way oh I see I never it never worked it didn't work no if the devil is attacking you and striking you over and over and over again it's because you're getting Victory amen it's because you're overcoming it's because you're because he he wants to bring you down he wants you to get you out of the church he wants you to walk away from the body of Christ he's going to keep attacking you and where does he attack you right here right here over and over again you get up in the morning he's right there he's punching in right away okay new day you're defeated you can't do it today don't you see everybody's against you oh look at your children look at your bills the bills are coming next week oh that other bill is coming oh there's that's how he works and you got to say he's Jehovah Gyra when he tells you about the bills you say no no he's Jehovah Gyra he's going to provide I believe the word of God I'm not going to believe your lies I'm going to resist your lies amen when you resist he's got to flee Hallelujah now here's a good thing see sometimes Satan can take you and when you think think that you're doing the will of God and can make you a proposition you'll fall for it yes sir he sure can no true servant of God ever does that you see a man showing off his chest out or all like that just remember there's something wrong there no God don't want that Jesus set the example he could have done it he certainly could have done it but he didn't do it no servant of God is a show up of himself to try to take God's power and show himself above somebody else exalting self instead of exalting Christ oh I can do this when the brother said this morning I'm talking to him on the phone he says he says can you help him I said the Lord can help him I would be happy to pray for him I would be happy to talk to him but it's the Lord that can set him free it was the Lord that Set Me Free I didn't do it by myself I had to I had to just give up God had to just keep hitting me and Gabe would call me every every once in a while hey I'm going by you want to come to church this week I would say how many times you go to church cuz you always be asking me he said I go three times a week I said what three three times a week finally I was at a point where I realized that you know what maybe I should go something inside of me because I knew when I looked this way at my life I said man I can't face that I don't want that life anymore and so sometimes God will bring you to a place where you are not going to love yourself you're going to look at yourself you're not going to like the condition you're in you're not going to like the attitude that's on yourself you're going to hate the way that you're feeling you're going to hate the way that the enemy is bringing you down and causing you to act and everything else and then you're going to surrender and you're going to go right back to where he where he where he wants you right back remember he positions you he places you and when he places you it's because he wants you right there because he's got a work for you to do he's got something that's going to edify the body of Christ and is going to change this local body in the moment and in the twinkling of an I when we overcome together in the unity of the faith the supernatural comes in remember you know brother Brandon made that quote he says if everybody in this place would come to a place where they could look to their left or look to their right and see their brother and sister and see them as attributes of God see them as Sons son and daughters of God and project nothing but perfect love into that situation and and and get rid of all that negative feeling and all that the the lies of the enemy he says there wouldn't be one feeble person in our midst I believe that I believe he can do that for us even now I believe he can transform this church and make it a Powerhouse for where people can come in and the power of God can sweep down and and heal and and and deliver and set free and and and bring joy unspeakable because Joy is your strength we want joy in the house of the Lord amen praise God hallelujah I love the joy of the Lord amen praise God I love singing that song I just don't have the voice anymore to do it and laugh the way I used to but I used to love it that Joy was just it would just emanate amen glory to God people will join church because of their influence you know we're talking about you know being tempted they'll they'll join a church because they're wealthy and they want to influence the minister right they want to influence the leadership of the church they want to take control because of their position no no the way up with God is down that's the only way up is down if you want to get anywhere with God make sure you're looking down down so God can raise you up amen church has become programs popularity celebrities you know listen we drive by that church you know Hope Church beautiful Church you know tremendous what they're doing over there like the the thousands of people that go through there every weekend praise God they're doing something that's drawing the people into their into their place you know I know a lot of people that go to that church they're very wealthy people amen praise God you know they go there you know they feel comfortable you know but but you know like when when Jesus really knocks on your door and he starts to really you know knock on your heart and he starts to discern your situation starts to really tell you who you really are and where you stand and the portion of that and all that money that you got that's in the bank ain't going to do you one good in glory because you can't buy there is no price on your salvation it is something that is only directly given personally by Jesus Christ to you personal amen you personal not through your friend not through your influence not through not because I go to this church and he's the he's got the most people going to the church than all the community so if most of the people are going there then I should be going there listen everybody's got to go where they're supposed to go I'm not saying anything all I'm saying is that this place here we get to the word we talk about the word we lead the People by the word we want to see true genuine births by the word of God not some confession you know that you know you go in a a a a a a dry Sinner and you come out a wet sinner you just go right back to the same life no we're talking about the reality the change the Born Again experience the transformation of a son or a daughter of God amen glory to God Amen so even in the message listen even people will say I believe William brandom to be the prophet but they haven't even overcome the fact that William brandham came to introduce us to the Lord Jesus Christ not to himself and the people are so focused on William Branham not realizing that their their eyes are too much on just just the tapes listening to the tapes that's all you got to do no you need to listen to the tapes but you also need to feed on the Living God in the midst of the five-fold ministry in the Church of God where where brother Brenham himself said you need to be in church he says you need to be there because the Judgment of the Lord starts in the house of the Lord you need to be there to be scoured to be cleaned to be fortified by the word of God as you're out there you know when you're in your car and you're just listening to brother brandom and it's just you and him and your feeding and everything else that's great it's wonderful and God will speak to you in those things but if your mind is only that's all I need I don't need a pastor I don't need to pay tithes I don't need to give offerings if I want to give it I'll send it to the voice of God listen there's nothing wrong with sending money to the voice of God we send money to the voice of God we support the voice of God because we support the ministry we know that it was the angel to this church age we know that he was a prophet in the 20th century we've recognized everything brother Bram fulfilled in the scriptures Malachi 4:5 Revelations 10:7 the opening of the seals all of those things and we need them and that's why we're here we wouldn't be here had we not recognized that but he did it like John the Baptist I must decrease so that he can increase so that he can come on the scene and start dealing with you personal because you cannot overcome by flashing the tape of William brandham you're not going to overcome by just quoting William brandham you're going to overcome by knowing that greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world amen and this is a reality this situation is real and I believe the word I'm going to overcome because of my circum like like like like when they went into that furnace they went in there believing God's word and if it meant that they were going to burn up and be turned into Ash well praise God they knew that their bodies would just go from this Earthly Tabernacle to another one that's waiting Hallelujah they say I am in the message but is the message in you you see Christ is the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever is the message we're not here to promote a man we're here to promote Jesus Christ who is the same yesterday today and forever wants to come into your life give you a revelation of the word for your day and you will never miss William brandham you will never miss Luther you'll never miss Wesley you will see the Reformation right there before your eyes you will see that it's in history you will see all the things that are going on in the world that it was all prophecy that is now being fulfilled you will see it crystal clear because the Holy Ghost will come in you and guide you like Jesus said into all truth you see you need the Holy Ghost you need the Holy Ghost you need him leading you you need him in you you you need him overcoming in you amen praise God listen to uh brother Bram says he says here and humble thyselves you know people they want Power they really they they they don't know what power is see he says they don't really know what what what goes with it the Way Up Is Down always if you want Power see humble you see how humble you can get just get away from all your worldly thinking and humble yourself before God and then you're and then you've got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a big lot of noise because you have been able to conquer yourself he says and commit yourself to Christ you see to humble yourself before him that's real power saints that is so true you show me a church that's humble real humble not an arrogant church just a sweet Humble Church I'll show you a church that has the favor and power of God in it that's right that's what he says that's the thing it takes humility humbling ourselves before God and letting God just work through us don't have to make a lot of noise above all things it's our IND individual Souls that were responsible before God in other words he's saying listen make sure your own calling an election don't be looking at your brother don't be looking at your sister be looking to you know don't don't be looking at their faults don't be looking at their weaknesses look at them in prayer trusting God In Prayer believing for them in prayer that God will do a great work and and break the power of the enemy in our lives amen hallelujah as I've always found out that the man that humbles himself is the man that God exalts and when you take a person with his chest out knows everything and you can't tell him nothing and he's arrogant and well that's that person that never gets anywhere but you take that person that humbles themselves and walks sweetly with God you're going to see the power of God hallelujah now don't miss this he says when this great battle started on Earth there had to be a mutual meeting place and we know where that meeting place is it's right here you got to stop listening to the enemy you got to stop allowing him to bring you down to convince you of something that God has not shown you listen if God is doing something in your life he always always works on both ends don't be don't be trying to work everything out on your own end you said you see that's the problem you're trying to interpret everything on your own end and not allowing God to work from the other end so that he can meet you right there in the middle and show you that he's in the midst of it amen that's where you get Revival that's where you get strength and that's where you get revived you become encouraged by the word of God and all of a sudden every changes around you the Lord all of a sudden that Gloom that oppression that depression it leaves because you've been trying to do it all on your own he says here there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to rage and that's the Battle Ground begins in the human mind there's where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle where was to begin and that is because that decisions are made from the mind and from the brain but you know where they're believed or accepted in the heart oh yeah as a man thinketh in his heart you see that's where you make that final decision that's where you give your heart to the situation you need to give your heart to the Lord amen glory to God now let's look at the final assault here as we wind this down the third great assault Satan offered to Forfeit this Kingdom to him he did Satan said see these kingdoms of the world they're all mine and I do with them whatever I want to I'll forfeit them to you but remember he was trying to get him to Forfeit it without the cross listen this world Satan still has control over all the kingdoms of this world how many knows that you've got to be able to see that okay and he's going to you know Satan's going to use the same tactics on you to try to get you to believe certain worldly government teachings and and the way that that everything is going to work out and that you know this is how the Antichrist is going to be made known this is how the world is going to go into chaos or this is all just going to pass or whatever listen we know what the word says we know the prophecy of God's word we know that heavens and earth will pass away and that the word of God will never pass away we know that the kingdoms that are out there are going to fall and Satan is not going to tempt Us by by showing us the kingdoms of the world and and that our government is the best government and we're going to stand for the Canadian government and we're going to vote for Trudeau or we're going to vote for the other guy there or we're going to vote for this one or we're going to be a Democrat or we're going to be a Republican Christians are not any of that there's nothing wrong with supporting your local municipality if you believe in it you want to support in certain aspects of it whatever it is you want to vote that's entirely up to you you can vote nothing wrong with that but you need to know who you are where you stand and what is actually going on out there and how things are going to work out things are not going to work out the way that you think and the way that the world thinks it's going to work out we know that Satan is going to have his time and he's got his control over the kingdoms of this world he still has them look he offered them to Jesus but Jesus knew that there would be no way to bring us back if he bypassed the cross he says Satan says worship me and I'll give you the kingdoms of the world Satan might come to you and get and offer you a job but you got to leave the church you got to go live in another part of the country where there is no church you got to go and and and uh work at a job that you know you're surrounded by total unbelief but you need to pay that bill so bad and you will compromise don't let him offer you anything that's going to take you from this word amen this word can never change everything around you can change God can change your circumstances God can deal with your circumstances God can provide your financial needs God can heal your body you don't need to to to be going spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in order to go and and and take a surgery in another part of the world because the doctor over there he did one and and cured the same person of the same illness no no those are all Temptations those are all things to get you away from standing on the word of God hallelujah praise God Amen but remember he was trying to get him to Forfeit it without the cross if he did we'd be lost he could have took the kingdom but he he followed he must come back he was tempted to do it now death is a hard thing he was tempted to take his Liberty and be the king of the earth without the cross but if he did his subjects would have died we would have never been redeemed Satan would have gladly made that proposition with him but he said get behind me Satan he didn't do it he come and he suffered and he took the hard rugged root he took the root of persecution he took the hard rugged root he took the uh he took the root of death and are we this morning willing to do that take that root that he has taken are you willing to die are you willing to give yourself up to God forfeit all the world and the things to serve him amen glory to God listen there's a victory for the Sons and Daughters of God in this scripture that we read and let me read it to you here it's a Divine promise amen and brother Braham says it reaches the weakest of Christians Listen to the message he said here in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he says now we find him as soon as God Came Upon him he's talking about Jesus going into the Wilderness he was anointed went into the Wilderness and out of that 40 days and defeated Satan by the word of God what did he do he brought any Divine promise in reach of the weakest of Christians he showed to each and every one of us that there is nothing that we cannot over come amen he brought any Divine problem if he was God why did he let Satan say if thou be the Son of God perform a miracle here and show me you can do it turn these stones into bread and eat he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone so then as Satan always tries to coat the word went back and told him when he when he put him at the Pinnacle of the temple and he again it is written and he defeated sat Satan on the word of God that shows that you can defeat Satan on the word of God no matter the word of God will defeat Satan any place anywhere under any condition it is in the belly if you're in the belly of a whale or you're in a lion's den it's it's on the it's on the bed with cancer or laying Yonder bleeding to death in an automobile accident the word of God will defeat Satan any where and the weakest Christian can use it it's your god-given privilege to do it hallelujah amen praise God just stand on the word amen let's go to the next scripture here we're going to wind this right off uh listen listen here now let's look at Daniel Daniel stood now Daniel knew that the writing was signed he knew that there was a decree that said hey you don't bow to anything but that statue you don't bow to anything because Nebuchadnezzar had made The Plea he had called it out he says anybody doesn't kneel to that statue and that was a statue of Daniel himself that's right you know and here here here you know Satan was trying to tempt him to show and here he says he went into his house and his windows being open in his chamber towards Jerusalem he didn't care who saw him right he was not going to bow to that he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God and he did as he did a four time they would look to that Temple look to the East look to that Temple they would pray to the god that they knew was their God Amen they didn't care what Nebuchadnezzar said they didn't care what the government was telling them to do it doesn't matter what the government tells us to do We Believe God's word and we will stand on the word of God Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever they want to come and close our churches because of of of trinitarian Doctrine or whatever it is that they're going to try to use to try and bring the World Council of churches together it's irrelevant to the Sons and Daughters of God because God is with us God will stand with us in whatever situation we will face amen praise God so Daniel now look now look look at the next slide here so Daniel did what he had to do but look then the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste under the den of the Lions because remember Daniel was thrown into the lion's den they couldn't go against the king's word but the king loved Daniel he was he was wondering oh my gosh what am I going to do but you know what maybe his God is God you need to stand on the word of God hallelujah you need to let people say whatever they need to say but God will prove in your life if you've if you've surrendered completely to him don't you worry about the circumstances the situations the oppression the the the the the the the insults or whatever comes your way because of what you believe God will prove himself and look at the king he he goes there and when he came to the den he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel he was he was like oh let this be his God that's what was in his mind he didn't want him to be eaten up and being digested by the Lions no sir he said he said and when he came he cried and he said he said with a lamentable voice unto Daniel and the King spake and said to Daniel oh Daniel servant of the Living God oh yeah listen the enemy listen your your friends your family your you know their situations are going to come upon their lives and at some point God you know God forbid situations do happen but they're going to come and they're going to realize wait a minute the Living God the one that you've been talking about is thy God whom thou servest continually able to deliver thee from the Lions and then said Daniel unto the king oh King live forever hallelujah oh yeah you listen don't worry my God is God he's going to prove himself he's going to show himself in whatever situation yes sir then Daniel unto the king said live he says my God hath sent angels and hath shut the Lion's mouths that they not hurt me for as much as before him innocency was found in me and also before thee Oh King have I done no hurt then was the king exceedingly glad for him Hallelujah glory to God and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den So Daniel was taken up out of the den and no manner of hurt was found upon him because he believed God hallelujah praise God forever more let's go to the next scripture here we're going to finish this we're going to get this done 1 Corinthians chapter 15 next slide it says you now I want you to remember it's when we started here overcoming in Christ Revival comes from overcoming your life transforms from overcoming you get Victory upon Victory upon Victory and every time you do that here a little there a little you're being changed you're being changed you're being you're you're overcoming this Dimension every time he says now listen listen here he says behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead in Christ shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corrupt able shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory victory comes when you overcome listen here he says oh death where is your sting oh grave where is your Victory The Sting of death is sin it's unbelief it's when you disbelieve God's word when somebody comes to you and says no you have not been baptized you need to be baptized in the water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ according to those scriptures in Acts chap 2 verse 38 and you turn around and say nonsense I was baptized as a baby you're in sin because sin is unbelief of God's word and when you say I don't need that experience according to the word it's because you don't believe it you're just saying right out front I don't care how religious you are I don't care how many times you go to church you're disbelieving the word of God and you're in sin and that's the sting of death that's death is sin and the strength of sin is the law now we don't want to get into all of that but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved Brethren Ste be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor you're overcoming your your your your your your persistence in the word of God Amen you're laboring in the word you're trusting God it it is not in vain in the Lord amen it's going to bring you the change that you need it's going to bring you the Deliverance that you need it's going to take you out of that addiction it's going to take you out of that financial burden it's going to take you out of the sick bed Hallelujah and it's going to take you into a mortal being changed from Mortal into immortality it's going to take you into the Rapture let the musicians come amen praise God hallelujah this is the promise of God's word you think listen it's all tied to the rapture everything that we're preaching here is tied to the Rapture it's tied to the body change it's tied to the overcoming of the believer so that you can receive the change that God has for you wherever you are right now whatever circumstance you might be in God wants to change it Hallelujah listen next slide he says in Revelations 3:20 he says behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will suck with him he said I will come into him into not to them into him you personal amen and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne not on my throne in my Throne because if you're in Christ you're in him and greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world and now to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as also I overcame he overcame for us don't be trying to overcome every little thing understand that when you come to this place of maturity in the Lord and you realize that hey I've accepted him I believe him I'm not going I'm not looking left right or Center I believe that he can overcome this situation in my life then you will overcome and you will realize that it was him in you overcoming because he's got to keep his own word amen glory to God but he says you'll sit with me and my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches you need to have an ear to hear praise God I'm going to end it with this last quote Hallelujah he says unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him this is from the Samia Church age you have to suffer to rain the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering he says character is a victory it's not a gift you're not given the gift of character your character shows in the way you overcome your character is revealed by the way you overcome the circumstances that come into your life and character it's a victory it's something that where where you know he says a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character it's fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and has sat down in his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary sufferings we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that will that that that that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what Treasures are laid up for those that are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation glory to God did you notice here he says in the in the message and I'll end it with this quote how can I overcome he says the arrangements of that see set with me in my Throne not on my throne in my Throne that's in his domain see and there as as Christ is the ruler Throne ruler at this time of the complete domain of God so will the church be with him the bride be with him in his throne in the entire domain see not on my throne but in my Throne see where his domain reaches a throne is over domain and a domain reaches just as far as its boundaries go and this is from eternity to Eternity just think of it praise God hallelujah oh glory to God let's sing that song from glory to glory he's changing me amen hallelujah give me give me a key sister what key is that brother Mike a flat from glory to glory changeing
