on um a tally of all our numbers it'll take about 5 minutes or so so Nathaniel um we could either have some music or we could have maybe a testimony or two real quick somebody wants to share you know something that happened during the Watermelons well you know what actually why don't we have our pastor come up and and say hello last sign that's a good idea always putting me on a hot seat right I'll just saying hello that's all you can say hello you can you can preach we had a wonderful day at church we spoke on S um you know put us on fire send us on fire lord asking the Lord to set our hearts on fire and Inspire us to do his work but was good to come here and to see all of you in the presence of the Lord and enjoying another's presence that's what this is all about uh and to before I got here I heard the good word that the message and the services were pretty good and right to the point and just reached out to your hearts and I'm happy about that I'm glad all of you came from everywhere to get together like this and to be able to merge your hearts your minds your thoughts but we live in a day actually when um youth are not serious about anything really everything is just fun and games and jokes and uh that sort of thing and there's a place for that but when it comes to your faith that needs to be something dead serious dead Earnest that is not something to quibble about that's something you must be certain of God certain of your own experience erience not your parents own but your own experience and allow the fire of God to work within you until it consumes you and not much of self is left now it's okay I'm going into preaching and I don't want to preach but it's good to be here good to see your smiling faces and all those watermelons so really juicy I know I can get a piece at any time but at the same time it was good to see you slobbering over some people ferocious Lambs eating up the Watermelons and having it just uh soak up that's the way we ought to be eating the word of God until sing all over it oh my like brother gr said you know you just eat it like if it's honey until it's sticking on your face your all over your skin and you're licking your fingers and everything else taste and see the Lord is so God and blessed are they that put their trust in him you know I know this some trip and being an old person saying it but let me tell you if you set the trajectory of your life or the where it's headed now you wouldn't have to worry too much later you set it now set your foundations right now put in proper spiritual foundations and even if problems come up the road you'll find that God will be able to write your ship quite easily because he has control over a part or all of your life so I encourage you as they're counting these points and coming up with who's the winner right here today uh some people say it's not whether to win or lose but it is got to do with winning and losing I want to be a Victor and I want to wear a Victor's Crown and let me tell you God didn't create any junk God created Jewels you might have been a piece of black coal one day but you can be a diamond after over time by God's grace no matter what it is you are God created you to be a winner you're supposed to be a winner and even when you think you're a loser ask for God's help you see in school with with a problem with anything ask for God's help as simple as that and he'll be right there with you and you'll see the answers will come you don't know how but the answers will come God bless every one of you and thanks for coming um from the
