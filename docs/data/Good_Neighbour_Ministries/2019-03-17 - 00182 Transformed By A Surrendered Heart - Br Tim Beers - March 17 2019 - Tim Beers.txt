========================================
people learn about this concept that they're going to go to church to be God God is within us the kingdom is company and that's what this message is all about that make us realize that the kingdom has come and that's why we come here tonight to hear his word not only in the letter form that I could speak in that you can understand but in the spirit form where he interprets to you and makes his word come to life and what that does is sow seeds into your heart and those seeds when it falls on the ground if your ground has been your hearts been prepared tonight Amen if your walk is being prepared daily and you're walking with him and you're cleansing yourself into the blood every single day every moment of the day amen then it's good ground and when that seed falls on it's gotta bring forth like his life this is not about the nomination for life or any other kind of like this the word life the seed word is coming to life again today and that's what we are we are people being called out for our purpose amen to bring forth this word and that's why we're peculiar we're different and if we try to fit into society we try to fit into the life even trying to fit into this culture of this plaque as struggles and wars against us if that new life has come a new workers coming this awkward this word has birthed inside you'll never be settled you'll always have that struggle until we get to that place where we surrender and we yield our lives not hungry here tonight here go where the God so something would strike us amen that we can overcome ourselves and allow Him to live and allow the word to be planted in us so tonight be a walk out of here some strikes our heart revelation strikes our heart and we can have confidence amen and babe it's revealed to us that this one has struck my heart tonight is going to bring forth in my life and it doesn't matter what stands in the way this flesh what's eatin it hinders he's put it in the way that think overcomes it see we'll try us he'll test us Emmitt on that beat that is revealed to you when you stand strong in that tweet amen and the logic come forth a minute thank you let's turn to the word tonight I want my title tonight is the word is quick and powerful amen we're giving it a real quick and powerful word I spelled my white button Sunday service guys that I've never ever heard come across local clear as it's coming today these are the vessels that brother Graham talked about that will this message to make a slope here I thought I need a message like that because I think that a part of my experience part my discernment my walk not only just the desert what's out there but the desert this it causes me to see this that I'm not a part of Ezekiel 37 we'll start at the first verse familiar Scripture then we're going to go to Hebrews 4:12 amen pray to God give me strength tonight just about him had a couple hours to think in Chicago as soon as I leave the pulpit on the whole not a minute the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the Spirit of the Lord has sent me down in the midst of the valley which is full of bones and caused me to pass by them roundabout and behold there were very many in the open Valley and lo they were very drunk and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and I asked her Oh Lord God found Lois and again he said unto me prophesy unto these bowls that say unto them o a dried bones hear the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord God onto these bowls behold because breath enter into you and he shall live and I will they see new upon you and bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and he shall live and ye shall know that I'm the Lord and so my prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a noise and behold shaken and the bones came together bone to his home and when I beheld the scene and the clefts came upon them and the skin covered them about but there was no breath in them then said he unto me prophesy unto the winds prophesy Son of Man has stayed to the wind thus saith the Lord God come from the four winds o breath and breathe upon the slain that they may live so I prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came up to them and these live and stood upon their feet with exceeding an extremely great army then he said up to me son of man these bones are the whole house of Israel behold they say our bones are dried our hope is LOX we are cut off from our parts therefore prophesy and say unto them thus saith the Lord God behold all my people I will open your graves I will cause you to come up out of your brain and bring you into a land of Israel and they shall know that i am the lord when i have opened your graves all my people have brought you out of your graves and shall put my spirit in you and ye shall live and i shall place in you in your old man and then shall ye know that i am the lord that has spoken it and performed it saith the lord amen let's go to Hebrews 4:12 I believe the message of the hour as did this again another has spoken it and God is performing hallelujah Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart that is very father - thank you Lord tonight that we can gather together as a people of God to hear your word Lord may you come now father and interpret your word as we speak your word may you make it clear and plain to us father that we may draw closer to me in this hour for the bride when she recognizes who she is she'll be an invincible army Lord and that's what this is all about word upon word precept upon precept here a little there a little as we grow and grow and grow father may you give us our portion to my father whether it be great or small and we will not fail to give you the honor and glory race forgive us of our sins washed us in the blood father hide us in the cross all speaker and hearer Father in Jesus name we pray amen hallelujah glory to God God's Word is set forth to us mistake to produce amen it's not an empty boy powerless burger you see religion takes all the power out of God's Word that's where brother Graham's seen the serpent trying to get into the message and trying to denominated trying to make it powerless formalists amen we're not called we're not called to that kind of life if you've got the Spirit of God inside of these that's why the Bible says if the Spirit of Christ and then the spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it will also quicken our horrible eyes amen quick test tonight life that has been released into liquor to us amen we just don't talk about that this seven seals being obeyed the cloud these are all signs that Christ in a restore back himself into the church in his fullness amen religion makes it the Word of God effect the Bible tells us in the last days that that would happen it's the word Paul said in Romans 1:16 from the Machine of the gospel Christ for it is the power of God to salvation to everyone who believes when we see that this is not God's Word they were the kingdom if we're saying that this revelation that were you hearing amen day after day is not God's Word for this hour they there's a lot of word out there there's a lot of vestiges 1/4 out there a lot of churches and a lot of interpretations they meant well we got an interpretation for the bride this hour even and only she can feed on this word she's a post-op separated individual Amen brother talked about the the birth of the stomach amen the Pentecostal people that denominations they don't got a stomach you wonder why people can't receive this word is it y'all got a stomach to handle this verb but there's a people that have been compared before the foundation of the world that attribute inside of them to receive this word [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] value spear

future the price destiny has this book it already we just need to fall into it we just need to surrender lives into it we just need to yield ourselves and Twitter and whatever God is doing in our lives let them do it last Battlestars we get the less we rebelled the less we pushed aside unless we ignored him Alessa battle scars began the pistol chasing you and chasing you until you come because my burden won't return boy let's get in to this hallelujah amen first Peter 1:23 be born again not of corruptible seed but incorruptible by the Word of God which lives and abides forever look at this

earth will pass away but my word will never pass away amen you realize what we have declared wait but my word will not pass away and that's what we must be art the word and we toss away we get better

Matt's come down to seek we make the fire but we got a fight in this apartment but we got a word of God that is so great that's been given to us all by what it'll do to you it'll produce sons and

of God it's not only word but it's a power when you speak the words of God they have power Paul said in Romans 1:16 amen I'm not ashamed because the gospel of God has power in it power to save to deliver change any circumstances glory to God there's nothing more powerful than the words of God philosophies with their ugh lifting questions fail is comprehension to the Word of God science with this and fundamental beliefs do not measure up to the Word of God if you take all the speakers of all the ages compare them for what they have said to what God has said all their words would be a sound the prostitute Ingo single day man there has never been an individual or group whose words carry more authority than God's word for us by the work of the worlds were framed and came into existence yes my brothers and sisters the world has the power of the chains like the bird instructs us to live righteous there are no words spoken or written that have the same effect as the power of

this outlet it is not going to be empty glory to God again let's use the word emptiness in the was in us today God sent that word who became flesh the desert it was productive did Jesus accomplish everything when he was on this earth everything that he was supposed to absolutely he purchased our salvation he paid our Redemption he suffer the penalty of that and paid the price for physical healing and peace of mind and prosperity you see the work for us see that scripture - you and me - abroad this hour we're not gonna be empty of anything we're not going to be unproductive over got you productive in Oh God amen thank you as a child of God we have responses enough for just being the years of the work but Duggars also that's the power of the scripture is there so many there just be tears they're not taking this word and apply it with your lives they're not taking this word and the sacrifice that changed sometimes when you hear the word of God and revelation to strengthen your heart the sacrifice the dying out the surrender of for singing amen that it takes to bring this word aliveness the preparation that it takes to constantly in beginning we're here for good here's what about tours you know the hearers are going to be left behind there's going to be our house for one day there's got to be a body change that is taking place right now that's happening tonight the body is being shaken inside amen our very fibers are being shaken by the word for God's length and God's presence in his atmosphere and God knows the heart she said I would [Music] [Music] he knows tonight everybody's naked before heaven in his presence and only the doers there's a lot of are these doors different tonight all your buddies are taking the Word of God that God is speaking into your life every day God speak to you today where you in no work today did you read the scripture today we wait to pray to God speak to you today what is he moving up your heart today what is he speaking something to you today and he promised me something today it's a review so cute you gotta be leading you directly to charity he knows Amen hallelujah since we bear witness of the power of God's burden and since we are aware of the impact it has in our lives that we should be spending more time in his word so one thing to hear the word studied the word but get in his presence where the word can unfold and open up to you this is the hours of the day we all know what were fighting here Leo see it i brother his brother Oakland believe from Africa there years and years ago and I was new I so rather hear about the manifestations of demons down in Africa they just manifesting people and not to say WOW brother you know this is an act I was really not even sure people grow they got more bigger demons up here than we have an elder in this culture and now I come to understand amen I understand the conflict but the Bible talks about there's a conflict going on between God is Satan amen for the soul amen for the Soul and that's why the lot sends his ministers they never would have played the sword of fire to fight for the soul amen oh yeah amen because there's a great cosmic going on right now amen same trying to make the church powerless lukewarm a metaphorical statement but God suited his word he said it is a revival he said I'm going to amen he says a coffee knowing that the fuel to breathe everything people pray you don't upon you over and over people then it goes down the bride's for the stag at the end those who really took it's worth the ability the seat of God is going to stand right and I'm not here to say who is and who's not I get the glory out of that that is actually none of my business but to preach the gospel to the bride of Jesus Christ that you've ever gotten and you have to preach the Gospels Jesus to the private Jesus Christ incarnate strengthen them and this fight that is about as God deals with my life against the experiences and what the truth is so with a spirit board filled men and faith takes the word into his heart and places brother Brown speaking here temperature changes places to the punt his lips why that is the scene as Det speedy Wow Wow that's what I've read these scriptures when I read the message of the hour and I look at them sometimes you might look at surf things in there and be like Mary Hopkin speed you look at this but he said spirit or field man or woman amen my faith takes the Word of God into their hearts and once it's in your heart in your hand but in your heart is part [Music] [Music] [Music] this work and when he puts it into your heart and it's placed there and you speak that word is deity speaking again there's this quote you heard about her many times but you know what these are not just going to stay close these are not staying holds now and this Bible is just not going to stay better this Bible amen is going to come to a place where the scripture says you are [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] what you start probably sit out of the water not what the devil's telling you that you're not very flesh things changing their six of my life that they're speaking to the end and still sticky I don't see them anymore though I don't focus on them anymore then I'm an intermediate why because I look at what he said morning amen glory to God the power of God's Word sinners become Saints by the powerpuffs burden dismay their lives are transformed and cific victorious lives the cyclist I think about some of the people to find out I think about myself I'm here 2019 I've ever the first time I came to nothing locker room necklace in there I remember my condition and then I come in here to Costas I can preset and understand anything was going on all I've seen was there's a bunch of things spiritual things to take place I had no clue and understanding and I was brought up and I can't get into it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] grace promises one thing I know stinks when this word struck my heart to change my heart what challenge is what condition I got it I understand and they understand more and more part while my commission does not change my position the later condition stop you are led to condition caused you to be ineffective to the Word of God let the word that is placed inside of you that the word is spoken aside you let it come forth amen what Mary start seeing is the same not seen this no no Jesus said that it be done to me you have spoken it angel Gunn we've had angels we had major angel spoke the word spoke to the brightness out spoke more into existence in this hour this hope [Music] just my weights expressed about the message strikes me Amen hallelujah Amen the word is the key to a lock part part the word is the bet to rest upon his word is a sure foundation is a bread to the hungry comfort should we believe the people we don't believe we [Music] come this word yes what you're
