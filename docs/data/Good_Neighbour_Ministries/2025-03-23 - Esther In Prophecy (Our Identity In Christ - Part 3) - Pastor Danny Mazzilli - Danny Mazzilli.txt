grateful for that I I mean uh it's not an easy uh act to follow I'll tell you that much but I'm not looking to follow any acts I'm looking for the acts of the Holy Spirit I'm looking for the power of God to come down in the midst of his people and to declare himself and make himself real to you personal amen if it doesn't happen that way you're just a church member you're just you just join the church if the holy spirit this is the hour where where Christ comes and possesses Sons and Daughters of God they are in love with the word that's why they come they are in love with Jesus Christ they' he's become more to he's become more important to you than anything else in this world until that happens in your life you're not going to see him in the way that he really wants you to see him it takes a surrendered life it takes dying out to yourself it takes dying out to your your your you're your the battle that goes on in your mind that tries to make you something or you know think you got to be this or be that in the house of the Lord or or or you you got to have a great position no sir God uses the humblest amen God wants us to get completely out of the way so that he can come into the midst and allow every position right from the cleaning staff right to the to the the to the trustees to the deacons to the ushers and to you who are in the background praying for the services believing God that he will come and visit us Sunday after Sunday Wednesday after Wednesday prayer night after prayer night amen praise God this is the body of Jesus Christ am this is the hour that we're living in amen praise God so I want to welcome each and everyone that's here any visitors that are in our midst God bless you you are welcome guests into the house of the Lord we we trust that

you know you heard that I was going to minister I trust you've come and you've joined in because you want to meet with God Amen you want to hear him speak discern your life deal with your circumstances and your situations so that you can get into your position that you've been called for in this day and in this hour amen praise God so we're going to continue let's go to the word of God now I know I've got you standing there but um that's what the Lord laid on my heart and I I thank God for every single one of you amen praise God and so let's um we're going to continue along this series of our identity in Christ um as the main thought you know because we want to be able to identify where we are and how we fit into what is going on around us prophecy is being fulfilled every single hour by the hour Saints you know that in the when Jesus gave up the ghost just before he went to Calvary and right at that moment when he when he gave up that he said it is finished at that moment so many scriptures were fulfilled in uh in the midst of the people one after the other taking place praise God and they didn't recognize that it was leading up up to that very moment but there's prophecy that is happening around us constantly amen and we need to recognize and your identity in the prophecy of this day amen praise God that's what we want to know we want to recognize our identity why are you here why am I a part of this church why am I a part of this message why have I recognized what God has done in the 20 first century amen praise God because you are people a lot of us we came from the 20th into the 21st century we're transitioning we're at a time of dispensational change amen and there are many things that are happening at this very time praise God and so today let's move along the slides there um today we're going to be looking next slide at our identity in Christ but in in particular over the next couple Services let's see where the Lord leads us okay and if you've prayed and you've come with expectation and you're not just a church member I believe you're going to pull something out of me by the gift that God has placed up here that's going to meet your needs going to speak to your heart amen and allow you to leave here stronger than you came in ready to meet the challenges we're going to look at Esther in Prophecy amen praise God and so let's read our first scripture which is um from Isaiah Chapter 14 verse 24 the Lord of hosts has sworn saying surely as I have thought so shall it come to pass and as I have purposed so shall it stand let us pray father we so appreciate this opportunity this morning Lord to assemble around your word and to know that your spirit is already present father you're moving in the midst of the pews this morning in the hearts of the people I feel your presence Lord and I'm grateful this morning Lord that that that we can uh just Rejoice that you will come and Inspire and discern and and lead us and direct us in the in in the way that we should go so that we can see our part Lord perfect faith is when we can recognize that you're a alive in our day in our home in our our lives in our families at our workplace Lord that's what makes perfect Faith a reality Lord for this hour that we're living in because we it's going to take a special kind of rapturing Faith to translate us and to move us and that can only happen if you come and indwell and possess and and and change us line upon line precept upon precept have your way this morning Lord we give you you praise Glory and Honor in Jesus name amen praise God you may be seated glory to God the Lord says that that that he hath sworn he listen he he swore by himself there's no higher there's no higher guarantee amen that whatever the Lord said he's going to do and whatever the Lord said he has purposed within him shall come to pass and shall stand it's going to come to pass Saints and this is the hour where we've got to realize that prophecy will be fulfilled and is being fulfilled in our very day in our very lives in our very countries amen and the nations with God has sworn he's going to do something he's had a plan what Grace that he's given us to be able to to you know that he had sent that he sent us a prophet that didn't just take us back to the Book of Genesis he took us right back into the mind of God he allowed us to recognize that listen before there was anything in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and he said the Word was God so before there was even a word there was God Amen the the self-existent one with a plan with a with a a a Redemptive plan that that he he was expressing and you know and it all expressed down onto the Earth after there there you know there was a fall because listen even before the Earth you know the before the the the Earth was was V was uh void and without form there was Angels God created angels God had Heavenly Dimensions where there was Angels that's why this whole Plan of Redemption it didn't just start in the Garden of Eden it started back before the foundations the world when Lucifer the lightbearer Satan who was one of God's Mighty angels that was his song leader that was his you know one of his you know his one of his main uh you know right-hand man but he he was he was created he was a created being and he had a purpose and within him was found iniquity he wanted to be like God he wanted to be worshiped like God and so he he just he just displayed it up there when he when he when he took a third part of the angels to you know to come and and take his side so that he could be worshiped and God just threw the whole thing right down onto the Earth and would allow it to play out and that's why that same spirit that came to Eve in the Garden of Eden that serpent who was the devil the Bible says it the devil the serpent wanted to be worshiped he wanted to to be like God so he wanted to create his own children and that's why he went and inseminated Eve to bring forth his own seed amen and that's why this world is in the condition that it's in but yet God has a plan amen and God's plan is all based on Prophecy and the prophecy of this hour is something that we need to recognize that's going on around us so today we're going to be looking at certain things but first of all let's just look at our next scripture let's lay in the foundation maybe a little bit of a review of what we covered last week and Luke 21 says and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distress of Nations if that is in the time that we're living in with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring men's Hearts failing them for fear and for losing after those things and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth their their their hearts are failing for fear because of what they're seeing come upon the Earth they're seeing the Nations falling apart they're seeing rumors of wars and now it's at Heights where it's where we've never seen before since the days of of World War II there's threats and there's you know things that are happening that you can see very clearly this world is going into chaos there's nothing that can stop it amen praise God one ceasefire after the other I believe a couple weeks ago I said you know we were under a ceasefire I said but I don't think it's going to last long and it didn't and right away you know like because there's no way you can stop prophecy you're not going to change God's plan for this Earth and what is going to take place amongst the Nations and how everything is going to come together but guess what before it all goes into the Great Tribulation we go into a great Rapture Hallelujah God takes us and just interdimensionally changes us from this Di mention to the next amen that's all he's going to do oh yes Saints listen why you don't think it's possible they're already doing things they're doing things listen all the things that you see that's going on with internet and with cloud storage and being able to place images into clouds artificial clouds all around us all of those things those are just pre uh you know previews of the kinds of things that that that God can do where do you think they got all of that from you think they invented it you think they're the the The Originators of all this intelligence no sir it was it was prophesied according to God's word thousands of years ago when Daniel says that knowledge shall increase in the end time it took over uh uh almost 5900 years years to get us to go as fast as we could go on an animal and in the last 100 years we're going to the Moon we're going mock four five six they're doing 17 18,000 miles an hour with rockets going to the Moon to pick up people in space stations and everything else how do you think that all came about because of God's prophecy that said knowledge would increase but no matter how much the knowledge of man can get to no matter how much they think they can figure things out they'll never figure out God God you cannot figure out the Lord he reveals to you what you need to know he reveals to you who you are he tells you the part that you're playing in this in the in the prophecy of this hour it's not you that's going to figure him out they're trying to figure him out they'll never do it praise God their their hearts are failing for fear because of the things that are happening on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken glory to God Amen I'll tell you things are shaking all around us Saints and you know I want to thank God for uh signs that he's given us in the heavens last week we looked at next slide here we looked at the fact that you know that we had had a blun moon back on March the 14th we tied it into the season of purum these are times when the Jewish people uh celebrate you know certain events and we know that purum uh goes back to Esther and that's what really got me stirred to look into Esther and all of a sudden I'm obsessed and I'm saying Lord I need to fully understand why this book of Esther is is uh is stirring in my heart amen and I'm asking you to pray and and seek the Lord and say Lord show us amen and God has a provided way of doing it through the foolishness of preaching I don't listen I got nothing new I got I'm going to be bringing things that are things that I've researched that I looked up in the scriptures on the internet and so forth things that many of you maybe have seen already but there's an element to the preaching of the word of God in this day and in this hour that invites the holy spirit amen it's called The Mighty Angel himself where God comes down possesses the ministers that stand at these at these pulpits and stand behind and believe God's word believe that it's it's all about him I got nothing to bring you Saints but I believe in the Supernatural God that can possess and speak and and be an oracle of God because he's going to have Oracles in this hour amen that are going to speak his word amen and so I thank God for for for the ability to to recognize these signs and these things that are happening around us praise God and you know um this this Blood Moon it surrounded purum it's surrounding the story of Esther that's where it actually originated praise God and so let's just see what the holy spirit's going to give us amen there's elements in there that that you know that you see this is the beauty of the opening of the word this is what we've experienced because of Malachi 4:5 and because of Revelations 10 1-7 and because we've recognized the church age Messengers and the angels to the churches these are the benefits that we receive as a result of the opening of those seals amen praise God let's move on Saints this is glorious and Luke 21:27 to 28 as we read on he says and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud glory to God with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth nigh you know I believe that there's a season in this scripture that lasts many years he says it says here and when these things begin to come to pass I believe something began back in 1963 Oh Glory to God I believe something began right back then and there was a there was a people that were ordained at that particular time and season for a purpose to recognize who they were and what it was that they were to witness that they would actually be a witness of a cloud that would come down in 1963 next slide in Revelations 101 it says here and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head Oh Glory to God and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire you know that Revelation 10 verse1 is talking about the Lord himself the Lord himself and this picture that you see here is an article and I know you've seen it we've all seen it but there's somebody that needs to see it amen glory to God Amen and this was an article back in uh uh that that was um in Life Magazine glory to God it was um uh May the 17th or sorry yeah May the May the 17th 1963 and it was an it was a picture that was taken and it it was taken from a few different angles that's why you've got these other pictures down the side and it was it was shown that this Cloud could not have existed at the at the 28 or 27 or 28 miles up in the air that it was actually formed and that it was a scientific phenomena Science magazine picked up on it said that it could not have exist you can find these magazines and these proofs right on the internet just search it yourself okay these are not things that I just put together these are things that have happened in our day amen and and this Cloud over here it was a super natural Cloud on page 112 and on page 113 somebody else some other photographer had taken a picture of a rainbow and do you think it was a coincidence that that rainbow was right on page 13 on the back it was a totally different time when it happened incidents that nobody knew each other nobody knew nothing the Publishers knew nothing but they put that cloud on 113 and when you take that page and you put it into the light that's what you're going to see a cloud was over his head because that is when you turn that cloud to the right you can go to the next slide you will see that it is the head of Jesus Christ it was the mighty Angel himself in 1963 he would appear in the clouds and I know they're looking for it to happen again I know they're looking and they're placing it into into a future event but the scripture said when it shall begin to happen I believe there's a people that have recognized and I believe there's a people in this day in this hour that still need to recognize because everyone that Jesus said all that the father hath given me will come not one of them is going to be left behind so every son and daughter of God they're going to have to recognize the word they're going to have to recognize the cloud they're going to have to know that Jesus Christ has already come in his second coming he appeared in in uh in 1963 seven angels come down and one of those angels was was was Christ himself amen praise God that would speak and open the revelation of those Seven Seals and this is what we are feasting on this is why we are a different church this is why we are the called out in this day and in this hour amen we're not making this Cloud some some uh uh Pagan God we're not worshiping the cloud but we know what the cloud represents it represents the word amen and in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the word what was God Amen and so when you can recognize the word being fulfilled manifest in your day you've seen being Jesus Christ in the present stage of his ministry and so on February the 28th this uh 1963 the vision and prophecy was fulfilled when a constellation of seven angels formed a huge Cloud forming in sunset Mountain sunset Mountain the Sun comes to set and the head comes to meet with the body of Jesus Christ the groom coming to his bride amen the body glory to God this is all right here right in front of your eyes sa sunset Mountain with a commission for William brandham to preach the opening of The Seven Seals of Revelations chapter 6 7 and 8 fulfilled fulfilled Saints it's taken place already and we're feasting on that seventh seal now we're not going to get into all the depths of it all but this is what this is what has awakened us this is what has brought us into the present State and stage of the ministry of the church in this day and in this hour she's not feasting on man's doctrines or man's teachings she has recognized that the headship the headship has come down and William Branham who was Elijah who was the Elijah that would restore all things the one Jesus said Elijah shall surely come and restore all things those things have been restored the word has been restored back to the original faith those Mysteries were all unveiled but there's a seventh seal mystery that is still unveiling in this hour it's what the Sons and Daughters of God are feasting on right now she's not looking back at church ages she's looking at the present stage of the ministry of Jesus Christ in the opening of the word on veiling himself not in in book form but in in written Epistles read of all men glory to God hallelujah praise God forever more what an hour thank you Lord Jesus and so this this opening of the word from uh 1963 laid in such a foundation for what we today are feasting on glory to God so there's a little recap of last week and a little more I believe there's going to be another Cloud that's going to be witnessed I was fellowshipping with our former pastor this week and we got into some discussion and we were just caught up into Heavenly places and we were talking about these things and he's and and and he says yes brother there's going to be another Cloud that's going to be witnessed because we are encamped about by a cloud of witnesses and when this day when it when it when it strikes in the moment in the twinkling of an eye I believe there's going to be another Cloud that's going to be witnessed that's going to streak right off of this and interdimensionally change from Mortal to immortality amen and who knows what they're going to witness then they're going to they're going to witness something they if they miss the first Cloud they might see this one Hallelujah glory to God Amen don't don't put any interpretation on the word of God Saints let the Holy Spirit interpret the word to you let him reveal to you what it is that he's going to do in this hour amen praise God it's when we try to put our own interpretation on the word it takes us further away from God hallelujah thank you Lord this was the Fulfillment of Luke 21:27 glory to God and if you've receive the Holy Ghost in This Day and in this hour you've been given the eyes to see and to recognize and to know that this is the truth amen glory to God let's go to the next slide let's move on Amen Glory Hallelujah prophecy being fulfilled right around us we're encamped about Saints Esther chapter 2: 15 to1 17 now when the turn of Esther the daughter of a Abel the uncle of Mori who had taken her for his daughter was come to go in unto the king she required nothing but what hegi the king's Chamberlain the keep ER of the women appointed and Esther obtained favor in the sight of all them that looked upon her so King so Esther was taken unto King azus into his house Royal in the 10th month which is in the month to Beth in the seventh year of his Reign Oh Glory to God hallelujah I know you know a lot of us has probably seen that before but you know I just love seeing those things she she was brought before the king just like she was before the king in Revelations 10:7 when the mystery of God the mystery the king himself was going to unveil himself to a bride amen you think that's a coincidence on the 10th day the seventh come on Saints Hallelujah he's his his word is prophetic this is the prophecy of God's word amen we need to recognize where we stand here and so and so Esther was taken under the king at that time in the seventh year of his Reign seventh year of his Reign seven Church ages leod deia the seven seal come on Saints there's all kinds of of of of things here that the Holy Spirit was unveiling and this is 2500 years ago and the King loved Esther above all the churches glory to God and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the Royal Crown upon her head and made her Queen instead of vashi Oh Glory to God aren't you grateful that that that that you have been identified as Queen Esther in this day and in this hour that you have found favor before God listen the king hadn't even seen her yet but I believe that he knew her already I believe that that there was something in his heart do you know that this whole book of Esther there's no talk of the Lord go back and read it it's all silent it's all God hidden in the midst of his people God doing his thing God doing it under the third pull under the seventh seal because it was the seventh year of his Reign everything was going to be done in such a way that it would only be revealed to those that were in their positions those that would have recognized that they had a calling that there was something Supernatural taking place in their lives they didn't they didn't join a church you didn't join this church God called you God placed you God positioned you God gave you a revelation of who you are in this hour amen it's it's going to take that Supernatural aspect of the word of God to place you and to allow you to recognize who you are amen glory to God and right away he put the crown on her head this is the one that I'm going to Crown I'm going to give her absolute Authority I'll tell you we we let's just go on let's read on because there's so many nuggets in here that the Lord is going to bless BL us with amen praise God listen to brother brandham here uh go to the next slide he says here in the marriage of the Lamb Esther was to become a bride so she didn't want none of the adorning of the world if you go back and read it all the all the women all the virgins that had been chosen in shusa and on all the 127 provinces around because vashi she had she had rebelled and not want to come under submission to her King a kind of a type of what the world and the Christian world today they they claim him to be the king they want to all the glory that comes with the King they want to have big Ministries because they serve the king but then when the king says you need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because I am one Lord one God I am not a trinity you need to you need to read and recognize what the scripture says they turn around and say nonsense just like vashi when the king says you need to come into my presence I want to display you because I find you to be the most beautiful God W God so loved the world that he gave himself for this church he want he loved everybody he wanted but they rejected him imagine the the the the Mighty God God himself come down in the first coming amongst his people the most religious people of the day but what did they do they rejected him to the point where they said crucify the word they didn't want to take the word they didn't want to come under submission to the word you show me one place where anybody was ever baptized I'm just using that as an example you show me anywhere where it says Trinity in the Bible you won't find it you want to serve God but you don't know him you don't recognize but yet you've got to have a revelation yourself amen and so here now she didn't want to Adorn herself because all those virgins when it was their time to be called to be to come before the king because he was looking for his bride and so he was going through one every night a different one would come they would come to him at night they would leave in the morning and only if he would call them back by name were they allowed to come back into his chamber amen because he knows his own glory to God and when it was now all these virgins what they would do is they would dress themselves in absolutely the most you know Adorn jewels and paint themselves up to make themselves look so sexy and and put on those tight skirts and and and everything else like the world today they want to dress they want to go before the Lord they want to come into the churches and they want to be dressed in such a way that's provoke it provokes men to look onto them to lust after them that's the that's the nature that was on the women that's on the women and that's what and that was back there in the days of Persia they were the listen Persia at the time Babylon was the biggest it was the power country nation of the world at that time right around five 470 5 BC 2500 years ago they had fashion they had things that you could they had colors because they had adopted all the things that had come down from Mystery Babylon from Babylon because it was Persia that took over the Babylonians that that that beat the Babylonians and became the the the superpower of the world and they had Jewels they had colors they had dresses that they could that they could dress they had makeup and all kinds of things that they would use on their bodies and everything else to make so these virgins would would dress themselves and they would just deck themselves to make themselves look like so amazing so that they could hide so that they could hope that the king would choose them to be the queen but when eser went in uh her Chamberlain said no no just go in plain the way you are Oh Glory to God she didn't want any of that listen just like she wanted to go into the king just like she was she had listen she adorned themselves like the Pentecostal women ought to with a Meek humble Spirit now you got to remember this is back in 1962 and the Pentecostal Church Age and and the and the Pentecostals had the had the the the the the the furthest most present truth about the word of God but yet they were slipping dramatically even at that time but the original Pentecost they were Holiness unto the Lord they were they they would dress properly they would come before the Lord adorned properly women would act properly and and and so forth amen but here he says now he says with a Meek and humble spirit and when all these fancy first ladies come by with all their new fandangle things the king looked at them and put them in the chamber with the concubines but when this Esther come into His sight and he got a glimpse of that sweet humble Meek Spirit he said that's her that's her go get the crown and put it on her head that's it let them Adorn let them let them Adorn themselves with that kind of a spirit not only the woman but the men too Adorn themselves with that kind of a humble Spirit that's what he's talking about the the the the true church remember a woman is always typed as a church and so when he's talking about a church here he's talking about those that are in the church and it's the people that make up the church it's not this beautiful building here that God has given us with this beautiful land on a on a nice Street and it looks lovely you come inside we're blessed we're thankful we're very grateful but it's not that that makes up the church it's not the beauty of the church it's the character of the people it's the humility of the people it's that's what makes up the real church and gives it the the the the beauty that of what God is really looking for amen that's it let them Adorn themselves with that kind of a spirit not only the women but the men too Adorn themselves with that kind of a spirit then you're becoming ready for the bride sweet reverent Esther made her heart heart clean there was something already in her glory to God Amen go to the next slide you know this is quick just just to show you the time of the timeline of the events and you see the highlighted area there that was when Persia was in dominance you know that Daniel in Babylon just before Persia God gave Daniel the vision of the great statue and and Nebuchadnezzar made it a statue of of Daniel himself but Daniel interpreted the statue and gave Clarity on the Statue how the the head was of gold and that was Babylon but yet he told the king that there's going to be one that's going to come after you the mes and Persians it's going to be a nation of silver and you'll see that it it just got softer the medals got softer gold is soft silver is a little f then it went into the uh uh uh Greek dispensation which was brass a little firmer and all of them had their their their their abilities and and their their uh uh gifts and the reason why they became the superpowers of the of their time how Babylon became the superpower it was God that allowed them to do those things but all of their superpowers were their ability to control the People by influencing the PE the the by influencing the people with their Fashions and with just like today just like you know the greatest nation on Earth today they call is the US OFA you know because of all of its popularity all of its fashion all of its Finance all of its you know economic power and and and everything else amen and so those are the things that they would use to control the people and that's why they became the superpowers that they did and of course their armies became more sophisticated they like the Greeks they were very smart that's why to this day you know they they're they're they're behind all of the all of the mathematics and all of those things because they had that natural ability to to you know the the gifts of of calculation and so forth and the Persians before them they had those you know they had super uh you know armies and they had spies that they could infiltrate and go in and take out you know it was all kind kind of things these are the if you go back and actually study and look into the history of each of these dispensations of world powers in the Old Testament you will see what was governing them what was behind them what what their it was all their knowledge everything was based on their ability their own strengths their own knowledge that's why they were Pagan they would not receive God that's why they were always against the children of Israel because they were simple they served served a god they served gods they made Gods out of everything they were so Babylonian and so Pagan and so uh filthy in their ways and everything else and that's why God had to separate his people from it amen praise God even God putting his people into Egypt for 400 years was because the amorites were were so were so wicked and vicious and and so polluted and so filthy in all of their ways and everything else God had a purpose in doing everything God was hiding his people in Egypt even though they were under bondage but God had a plan for them amen just like he's got a plan for you and me a lot of us are caught into the snares of this world and and the snares of this life and and and the Egyptian teachings and all the beauty and everything else but we're not we're we're we've received a word to sep separate ourselves from that don't worry you don't you won't have trouble separating from it because it'll be him in you it'll be greater that that's he and you that that'll separate you it'll be that attribute that God placed in you before the foundations of the world that'll separate itself and that will join itself with the present truth of God's word amen praise God and so here we see that Persia it was exactly around 2500 it was was actually a. 47 6 I believe it was when Esther was made Queen so it's about 2500 years ago just about 2500 years ago amen praise God now if you look at Esther we want to look at all the different types here of course when we look at the King of Persia we can type him as Christ he was he was King over everything this this man had had 127 provinces under his control he would he was having a feast for six months in celebration of of a of one of his victories of of of his great power and his ability and what he had achieved as the king and it was during that time right at the end of that Feast that he wanted to bring his wife he had gotten very very intoxicated and back in those days there's even talk that you know back in in the times that there's there's uh there's uh some discussion that you know that that when the Kings would would want to display their wives they would even display them in the nude they that's how filthy that's how how how they gotten so uh puffed up on themselves that a king could whatever he said it went if he said stand before me in the nude they would just immediately stand before him in the nude without even even question you couldn't even approach the king without being asked to approach the king if anybody was even to dare to approach the king there would be Swordsmen right there immediately to take the head off of the individual that would try to come before the king without being called so he was a supreme King on earth a type of Christ amen praise God Now esther is a type of the bride and we know that Esther it means star okay the actual name Esther and it's a Persian word from stara but her actual name was hadasa because she was a Jewish girl that had been um uh the the the remnants of after the Babylonian King went in and took the children of Israel took all the children of Judah the the king of Judah at the time Jan janaki I believe it was and and took them all into captivity and many of the of the families were killed and and whatever was left over the children and everything else they were brought into Babylon and so when the Persians took over Babylon they brought out those Jews at that time they weren't even really recognized as Jews they were just recognized as slaves they were just made slaves amongst the people and she came from a family of of of Jewish parents and her parents died and her her cousin morai took her as a daughter and raised her as a daughter now her name uh hadasa means myrtle tree and so um according to the Hebrew Bible Queen Esther was born with the name hadasa her name was changed to Esther to hide her identity upon becoming the queen of Persia the three-letter word of Esther is s a and it means to hide conceal and I believe this whole book of Esther conceals some great Mysteries within there some great Revelation that pertains to us because this is an end end time book this is a book regarding the end time it it has a significance to us and Saints I'm not going to make anything more out of it than whatever the Holy Spirit reveals to us and that's why over these next couple of services we're going to be digging in we're going to we're going to read we're going to pray I trust that you'll go back you'll read the book of Esther it'll take you a half an hour to read it it's only 10 chapters amen praise God but here you'll you'll you you know as we look at everything here um you want to see what we draw out of it so Esther was an orphan the least likely to be a queen just like you and me you wonder how in the world would God choose us you know to be that church in the last days that would represent Christ in this day and in this hour that would be the Queen of Heaven you don't deserve it I don't deserve it but there's an attri in you it's something that you had nothing to do with the only thing that you can do now is when you've been awaken to it is surrender to it and allow the Holy Spirit now to take control over his purpose in your life amen praise God and so she was the least likely but yet she became the queen Jewish yet takes on the position as a gentile bride because the Persians they were the Gentiles and he was a king and he would take on a gentile wife though she was Jewish but he didn't know she was Jewish he had no idea because in Christ we're not we're neither Jew or Gentile we're neither Jew or Gentile Saints we are Sons and Daughters of God Jew and Gentile is just something that came out as a part of the Plan of Redemption all of these things all the the the world systems and and all of the things that you know like we we we don't want to get into all of it right now but we're all you know we're under three different dispensations and now we've entered into a fourth dispensation actually and here we are in this you know uh when when you look back it was the the the dispensation uh the dispensation of Consciousness where where God was just invisible and he would speak personally to the individuals and then the dispensation of the law you know where God had to write the word and and bring it under a dispensation of Law and then the dispensation of Grace when Christ would come on the scene amen praise God and all these things but these were all for a purpose to bring us to a place where we would come to recognize that all of those systems all of those teachings all of those uh uh manmade theologies and gods and and days of worshiping and everything else was all in vain especially now in this day and in this hour where our eyes have been opened to the ability to go back into the mind of God to know that you were not the son of your mom and dad your daughter of your mom and dad yes you were Earthly but before you came here you were a daughter of God you were a thought attribute of God where were you when the sons and daughters ERS of God rejoiced around the throne it says in the Book of Job amen where were you you were an attribute you were there you were with Jehovah God you are in the self-existent presence of almighty God and this is what God is bringing us back to a revelation of who we truly are and how we identify in this day and in this hour amen but I believe there's a prophecy hidden within Esther that is that is uh you know where God hides himself in the midst he never declares you don't see them you don't hear morai talking about the mighty God we serve the god of Israel we serve the god of Jacob and Isaac and and Abraham you never hear it why this is why we're here today Lord unveil yourself show us make it real to us why our lives are so concealed and hidden sometimes we don't understand The Strange Life that we live but yet there's something in us that's driving us that's taking us before the king amen that's giving us confidence to go before God In Prayer gives us the ability to lay our hands on the sick it gives us a confidence to know that God will honor his word above everything else God will stand with his word something stirs within our hearts to to to believe it and to stand glory glory to God Amen she was a type of the Bride she was simple she was humble and if we look in Isaiah you know um uh just go just go to the next slide this next slide here I'm not going to get into it all but it's something if anybody wants a copy of it just let me know I'll email it to you but it shows the 10 chapters of the Book of Esther and all the events that took place and the timing and the players and everything else and I you know so I'm not going to get into it all because it's quite simple the whole book of there's there's a story in there that you need to go back and read it and then you will see and then when you come back next week I trust youve read it you come back next week you'll be able to see what the Holy Spirit unveils to us because we're going to move into areas that you know I I I broke into some things here yesterday and I realized oh my goodness I can't get into that there's no way there's no time I can't put so I I realized the Lord was laying in something this is just a found for where we're going I I was getting so caught up yesterday I just I just I was rejoicing amen praise God because God is is unveiling things to us now it's nothing new but it's my time it's your time it's our season it's the time where God's going to enveil things to you that are going to give you the confidence to move on with this message it's going to separate you from the from the doctrines of this messag oh my God God there's things happening Saints in the book of Isaiah when we look at the name uh hadasa her name means myrtle tree in Isaiah 5513 it says instead of the thorn shall come up the fur tree and instead of the Brier shall come up the Myrtle tree and it shall be to the Lord for a name Oh Glory to God Amen I believe your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life s I believe God knew your name and and then he goes on he says for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off listen if you're a son or a daughter of God you never ever were not a son or a daughter of God you're as Eternal as God is eternal your name is not Tim beers jural uh Esther your name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life amen it'll be the one that's written on that white rock that when the time comes for him to break us into that other dimension we shall be known as we are known amen praise God at that time we shall know who we really are amen praise God and so this is an Everlasting Covenant hadasa was her name but she's a queen that today 2500 years later we go back and we celebrate the Revelation that was upon her to save her people glory to God God gave her a revelation of the word of God to save her own people I trust that maybe you're going to share your you're going to share this message you're going to let your F I know many of you have already let your families know but you can't you can't drive anything and you can't convince anybody they're going to have to hearken unto the voice of the Lord themselves they're going to have to hear his voice themselves amen before they can actually represent themselves with the King hallelujah praise God there's a lot of nugget Saints praise God Amen thank you Jesus and so we just read that scripture in Isaiah and and here now the next one that we're looking at here so we've looked at at Esther and we're going to be looking a lot more at Esther okay a lot more but let's just get the background laid in another 10 15 minutes minutes and we'll be done morai representing the Jews and the Jewish nation of Israel morai was the son now pay attention here because all of this foundation and all of these all of this it pertains to today this is an end time book with prophecy that points to the end time and I believe now that's where I believe God that's why I think there's things in here that we're going to be blessed amen and here morai he was uh the son of of jir who was the son of shimai who was the son of Kish who was the father of King Saul and he is identified as a Jew from The Tribe of Benjamin who was also exiled from Jerusalem with jaim who was the king at the time Mori is a boy's name in Hebrew it has Hebrew origin meaning follower or servant of Marduk now you got to understand where he brought he was brought up under the Babylonian uh teaching an Empire and all the Babylonian Gods and everything else but pay attention in ancient Hebrew cultures Marduk was a Babylonian God who ruled over the city of Babylon with compassion similar to other Mighty deities it is known that Muk stood for justice fairness and Order and remember it's not the man's name it's not the man's uh uh position it's not the man's Heritage whether he's an Italian or a Portuguese or or an Englishman it's the Spirit that's on the man it's the spirit that's on the individual that's why when you testify or you you share this message with somebody and you start to fellowship with them you'll start to realize the kind of spirit that's on them whether it's a spirit that that that loves the Lord amen or whether it's a spirit of Pride that wants to uh you know doesn't want to be told doesn't want to be taught not willing to change their their their their interpretation or their Traditions or what they've been brought up under maybe they're they're ashamed that they would have to go and and and you know stand before their family and say I am no longer a Roman Catholic I am a Christian yeah but everybody even Catholics are Christians no I am a Son of God I am an attribute of God I am the word of God manifest in this day and in this hour I've accepted the word I am the church the bride a a bride will take on her husband's name that's why when you say to somebody you need to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and they say nonsense it's because they don't want the husband they don't want that husband they don't want to come under submission to the Lord Lord means Lord over everything if you've made Lord the love of your life you will submit to him you're not going to be some some jellyfish you're going to look and search the scriptures you're going to see what's written in there you're gonna you're gonna identify with the word you're going to be able to make sense naturally he that understandeth the word of God by Revelation amen praise God and so the spirit that was on morai was a spirit of of of uh of justice and fairness and he loved loved the Jewish people that's why you'll see when when he heard the decree that all of the Jewish people were going to be killed because of what hmon was going to bring about he he he immediately tore his clothes and immediately went into ashes and sackcloth and was mourning and crying and screaming out before every one of the provinces as he was going through declaring what what what uh wickedness was going to be coming upon them and that and that he he just uh but you you'll notice There's No Cry Out unto the Lord there's no you know God is hidden in the midst of this whole thing God is hiding in the background just like today people think they know that God is doing this they think they understand what God is doing but they don't realize what God is doing in this hour but God has given you the ability by the by the holy spirit in you to recognize prophecy and identify with the prophecy where you fit into the prophecy prophecy and your part in the prophecy amen and so here Marduk was a Babylonian God and it stood known for for fair okay so the name morai is recognized in the Jewish faith born by the brave cousin and Foster father of Queen Esther whether you're raising baby spiritually or not morai carries both strength and kindness okay that's the name the strength that's in the name okay so now we understand the spirit that was on him now if we look at morai today we have an Israeli president by the name of Benjamin Netanyahu now by the way mori's genealogy went back to the Tribe of Benjamin because Saul who was the first king of Israel came out of the tribe of Benjamin and so today we have an Israeli president by the name of Benjamin Netanyahu and in March of 2012 and this I picked this up just this morning in March of 2012 Israeli president prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave us President Barack Obama a copy of the Book of Esther which will be read read in synagogues that week because it was March the week of purum and it would be read that week in observance of purum Esther tells the story of a Persian government that tries and fails to wipe out all the Jews in the Persian Empire according to the Israeli newspaper herzek Netanyahu saw this as an occasion to generalize about the Persians or as we call them today the Iranians he told Obama quote then too they wanted to wipe us out he was referencing how back then in the Book of Esther hmon who was a Jewish hater and we're going to talk about him in a minute wanted to wipe out the Jews and who's been standing for Israel like no other president Benjamin Netanyahu he's got the name Benjamin now you know sure that's a coincidence maybe I don't think so especially when you look at the next one I'm going to show you and here now we are looking at these things happening around us we're looking at the day we're living in we're looking at the actors The Players Benjamin Nat Netanyahu says every single one of those demons I'm gonna take their heads off I'm just you know giving you like my interpretation he's not given up he's not going to in any way shape or form allow Hamas or any any backed group any Iranian backed terrorist to come in and take control of their land why because God gave it to them I don't care what anybody says listen you want I see things now that they're going against Israel they want to put things against Israel I read a I read something yesterday Pastor Simon actually sent it to me of Air Canada and how they've changed their flight maps that fly into the Middle East now when you fly over the over the Middle East it says it doesn't say Israel it says Palestinian territories oh yeah they don't realize you cannot curse what God has blessed I don't care what anybody says I'm not here to to toot on Israel I'm not I'm here to talk about the word of God to tell you what the word of God says and how God is going to stand supernaturally just like he's done right from the very beginning you show me one time in the scriptures where God didn't tell his generals His prophets his Kings to go in and take the enemy anytime he said go I'm going to be there with you I will fight your battles you show me one time where he said that and it didn't come to pass I can show you places where he said don't go and yet they decided that they would go because they thought they could do it on their own and we should learn lessons from those things when we're under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and God tells you something God shows you something God reveals to you and says don't or do don't or do it is my recommendation because if God says go it means he's with you it means he's going to stand behind you it means he's going to meet your need regardless of your situation you can stand on his word above everything else praise God Amen and Netanyahu is not going to bow down to any terrorist organization he wants to wipe them out annihilate them take them off the face of the Earth unfortunately the story doesn't end quite that way yet because the world is going to go into some pretty serious turmoil and Israel is going to have to face some pretty serious turmoil just like the rest of the world in the Great Tribulation amen praise God but we can't stop those things and so when we look here at these characters that are right now in our midst we see names tying in scripturally tying in and here now we're going to look at hmon now hmon in the Book of Esther hmon is identified as the son of uh hdath the agagite and is portrayed as a descendant of AAG the king of the amalekites we're talking about this king of the amalekites and the amalekites themselves they were demon Wicked they would do things that you wouldn't even imagine the kind of things that they would do oh yeah Wicked who was defeated by King Saul and slain by the prophet Samuel that was when when when God told Saul to go in and here's an example here where Saul you know was told by Samuel says go in take out the amalekites every man woman child Beast everything wipe out every Spirit people look back they think my God God going in and wiping out these people Nations it's because of the wickedness if you went back and actually looked in to their to to their rituals and their gods and the things that they did and and the things they worshiped and the prostitution and the the wickedness and the and they would they would Slaughter children they would do anything it was Absolute Total wickness demon power God didn't want them to have nothing to do with it that wasn't the spirit of God no sir but when God told Saul go in and take out every single one of them Saul decides not to kill the king he says oh we kept back certain things and when Samuel came in and saw what he had done it was his Rebellion to God that he didn't realize he had rebelled against the word of God and when you are given a commission by God to do something listen we have been called for a purpose in this hour let me tell you God has given us a purpose in this hour as Sons and Daughters of God every one of us given a position in the body of Christ and and if you've come under that leadership of the Holy Ghost and God has given you a a a a a a commission whether it's an office to minister a deacon or a trustee or an usher or whatever it is and you don't exercise that office to the fullest of your heart and your ability you look out you're going to get chastised amen you're going to get tested you're going to get shaped you're going to get you're going to get fixed and formed and and God is going to deal with whatever he's got to do to get you into your position and if you still aren't going to Rebel just like Saul you're going to lose your mind amen yes look out believe it this is the hour where God is requiring us to stand at our post and give all that we can not we're not serving man we serve the Living God Amen praise God God this is the hour where we serve a living God a present God he knows your every move he knows your every thought he he he has he has placed you into his heart and every time that things not stirring properly he's aware amen praise God Amen and so here God shows us here that it's not a coincidence that we have these characters identified together in in our day Mori the descendant of The Tribe of Benjamin who was of the lineage of King Saul who was the first king of Israel was The Descendant and Saul was a descendant of Benjamin Saul was the son of Kish of the family of the mates and a member of The Tribe of Benjamin and today when we look at hmon you go to the next slide his name is Ali huseni come in and right within his name I underlined it hmon right there now you know maybe some Muslim is going to see this today and he's going to say whatat are you doing I'm say I'm I'm talking about prophecy I'm talking about names I'm talking about positions I'm talking about the things that God prophetically is making known unto us in this day and in this hour so that we can recognize what God is doing we need to see God has given us the ability to recognize these things but he's not given us the ability to see these things so that it can uh so that we can go and change the world so that we can go and tell hey buddy your name's got hymon in there man like you know you're you're fulfilling that part you're the supreme leader of Iran and we know that you're behind a lot of these terrorist organizations and everything else but he's positioned there for a purpose just like Babylonians just like what when when Nebuchadnezzar or King Cyrus or any of the Kings or any of the positions they were placed there for a purpose Pharaoh for a purpose but God has given us the ability to recognize we can see these things and today we have this leader in Iran whose name is uh alii Kami his lineage goes all the way back to Ali abin Hussein Assad who was the great grandson of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad which is all the foundational teachings of of the Muslim teachings of today Saints what hour are we living in you know there was a prophecy when we read Esther uh chapter 9 verses 11 to 14 I'm going to read it to you and as we close here let the musici come and that day the number of those that were slain in shushan the palace was brought before the king and the King said unto Esther the Queen the Jews have slain and destroyed 500 men in shushan the palace and the 10 sons of hmon hmon had 10 Sons what have they done in the rest of the king's provinces now what is thy petition he asks and it shall be granted thee or what is thy request further it shall be done here the king is now you know we're going to be looking at all this how how how how Esther was given a position of authority where she actually started to make the decrees where she started to speak the word where she was the one that actually uh unveiled the hidden aspects of of uh things that were going on and how morai why morai was was was uh uh you know made at the end second in command to the king you'll read it all in the story but Esther was behind all of it she was positioned for a certain purpose and here now he says what is thy request further and it shall be done then said Esther if it please the king let it be granted to the Jews which are in shushan to do tomorrow also according un this day's decree and let Hon's 10 Sons be hanged upon the Gallows and so I was doing some research and this is these are just things remember I'm not making anything out of this I'm bringing certain aspects as a minister and as as the pastor of the church things that the Lord lays upon my heart to bring to you and you know some Bible scholars say that this scripture was the prophecy of Esther fulfilled in 1946 because in 19 19 46 we know what happened in the Holocaust and how you know that same spirit that was on Hitler was the Same Spirit that was back on hmon it's that same Spirit that's always been there to take out the the children of Israel it's a wicked demon even the Holocaust they did atrocities and things to the Jewish people that we don't even want to mention but this is how Wicked those Spirits were and on October the 16th 1946 which was on the start day of the Feast of Tabernacles there was supposed to be 11 of these convicted Nazi war criminals that were to be hanged on that day and what ended up happening was one of them who was the main guy almost a type of hmon and you'll see that hmon was even hanged on the The Gallows that he built that he wanted to hang morai on and that's what the that's what the devil will always do if you stay with the word every trap that he lays for you he'll hang himself on it God will turn the wicked upon the wicked I can read you scriptures I scripture after scripture that the meditations of the wicked the end is not good even when they think about it they're just preparing for their own End Amen and here if we go to the next slide you'll see that one of them committed suicide there was 11 of them that were supposed to be hung that day but one of them committed suicide the night before by taking a Cai pill and they ended up hanging only 10 on that day now why am I bringing that up we know that these 10 Sons we know there's types in there we're going to get into that we're going to be looking at more of it the 10 Kings and the and and you know the Beast with the ten horns that came on the mystery Babylon you know on the on the the the statue at the B all these things they all have significance because they're all spirits but that was a prophecy that Queen Esther in the Book of Esther it happens Saints I'm not saying listen coincidence these things these things are not by coincidence when you're under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit God has Perfection within his word mathematics within his word now how is this going to put you in the Rapture I'm not saying it's going to put you in the Rapture what's going to put you in the Rapture is your ability to recognize your position in the word of God and recognize the prophecies that are happening around you the time the season the dispensation and what it is that the word is supposed to do for you and this is what we're going to be looking at next week may the Lord bless you go to the next slide it says in 1 Thessalonians 5:20 despise not prophesying because God's word will come to pass amen and the next slide we're just going to finish exactly what we started with Isaiah 14 but we're going to read the rest of it the Lord of host had sworn saying surely as I have thought so shall it come to pass and as I have purposed so shall it stand that I will break the Assyrian he's talking about now how he's going to break the enemy he's going to break the Assyrian in my land and upon my mountains tread him underfoot then shall his yoke depart from off of them and his burden depart from off of their shoulders this is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth God has a plan of redemption Saints God is going to break every Assyrian power demonic influence that may be holding you back from being what you're supposed to be Amen in the word of God this is the purpose that is purposed upon the old Earth and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all Nations God is in control of the Nations God is in control of the kings of this Earth listen president Trump is not in control president Trump is another uh uh uh player another actor he's always been a good actor amen but now he's he's he's coming to his Pinnacle my goodness he he's coming into his position oh it's a great you know luxurious and and and glorious position position but it doesn't end well for the Lord of hosts hath purposed and who shall disel it and his hand is stretched out and who shall turn it back will never stop the prophecy of God's word am Saints Hallelujah next week we're g to
