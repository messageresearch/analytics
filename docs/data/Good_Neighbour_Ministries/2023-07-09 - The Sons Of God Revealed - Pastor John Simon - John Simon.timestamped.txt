[2:55] I'm going to read from Psalms 9
[2:58] it says I will praise thee O Lord with
[3:01] my whole heart
[3:03] I will show forth all thy wondrous
[3:06] marvelous works I will be glad and
[3:09] rejoice in thee I will sing praise to
[3:13] thy name O thou most high when mine
[3:17] enemies are turned back they shall fall
[3:20] and perish at thy presence for thou Hast
[3:23] maintained my right and my cause thou
[3:28] saddest in the throne judging right thou
[3:33] has rebuked the Heathen thou has
[3:35] destroyed the wicked thou has put out
[3:37] their name forever and ever o thou enemy
[3:41] destructions are come to the Perpetual
[3:43] end and thou has destroyed cities their
[3:46] memorial is perished with them but the
[3:50] Lord shall endure
[3:52] forever
[3:53] amen and amen he hath prepared his
[3:56] throne for judgment and he shall judge
[3:59] the world in righteousness he shall
[4:01] Minister judgment to the people in
[4:03] uprightness the Lord also will be a
[4:06] refuge for the oppressed Prince
[4:09] a refuge in times of trouble and they
[4:13] that Know Thy Name will put their trust
[4:15] in thee for thou Lord has not forsaken
[4:19] them that seek thee
[4:21] sing praises to the Lord which dwelleth
[4:24] in Zion declare among the people his
[4:27] doings when he maketh Inquisition for
[4:30] blood he remembereth them he forgeteth
[4:33] not the Cry Of The Humble have mercy
[4:36] upon Me O Lord consider my trouble which
[4:39] I suffer of them that hate me thou that
[4:42] lift this me up from the gates of death
[4:46] that I may show forth all thy praise in
[4:50] the gates
[4:52] of the daughter of Zion I will rejoice
[4:55] in thy salvation the Heathen are sunk
[4:59] down in the pit
[5:01] that they made in the net which they hid
[5:05] is their own foot taken the Lord is
[5:08] known by the Judgment which he executeth
[5:11] the wicked is snared in the work of his
[5:14] own hands
[5:16] the wicked shall be turned into hell and
[5:19] all the nations that forget God for the
[5:22] needy shall not always be forgotten the
[5:25] expectation of the poor shall not perish
[5:29] forever arise O Lord let not man Prevail
[5:33] let the Heathen be judged in thy sight
[5:35] put them in fear O Lord that the nations
[5:39] may know themselves to be but men

[45:43] Jesus Amen and amen God bless every one
[45:47] of you uh please be seated where you are
[45:50] we'll speak for for a brief while here I
[45:53] Believe by the grace of God hallelujah
[45:56] you're used to me I always say it's a
[45:58] brief while but I myself don't know
[46:00] where it's going fully really praise the
[46:03] Lord now we read a scripture there
[46:07] which says the earnest expectation
[46:11] of the creature waited for the
[46:14] manifestation of the sons of God
[46:18] now when it says it waits for the
[46:21] manifestation of the sons of God I want
[46:25] to read you some other translations and
[46:28] I want to let you know that this is what
[46:30] caused me to uh not that I didn't know
[46:34] this but to put it in these words right
[46:36] uh that I thought I'd bring this to you
[46:40] here are some translations and this is
[46:43] off the page of a a book that brother
[46:47] Perry green had given to me
[46:50] um and I you know I picked it up and now
[46:53] it's of use praise the Lord actually and
[46:56] because it's a Bible it's a special
[46:59] Bible I don't think they're made again
[47:01] but it has about 20 different
[47:04] translations every top every verse you
[47:07] come to is give you about 20 different
[47:09] translations of that verse so are you
[47:13] ready for this
[47:14] are you really ready for this amen
[47:17] listen for the earnest expectation of
[47:21] the creature waited for the
[47:24] manifestation of the sons of God
[47:28] for the eager Outlook of all creation
[47:33] are ardently waiting for the revealing
[47:39] of who are the sons of God
[47:44] another one for the longing of creation
[47:48] looks eagerly for that time when the
[47:53] glory of the sons of God shall be
[47:57] revealed
[48:00] here's another way much translation
[48:03] all creation is yearning longing to see
[48:09] the manifestation of the sons of God
[48:15] for the creation Waits with eager
[48:19] longing
[48:21] for the revealing
[48:24] of the sons of God
[48:29] now let me read from the Amplified
[48:32] version for creation is waiting
[48:36] expectantly
[48:38] for God's Sons to me made known to them
[48:43] see
[48:45] waiting for the revealing of those Sons
[48:50] and for the disclosing of their sonship
[48:55] the whole creation Now
[48:59] Philips translation is now on tiptoes
[49:05] waiting to see the wonderful sight of
[49:10] these sons of God coming into their own
[49:14] o praise God I'm gonna just stop there
[49:18] but those are some translation that
[49:21] gives you a broad idea of what we're
[49:24] about to talk we are talking about right
[49:27] now by the grace of God now the creation
[49:31] we're reading the Bible says the
[49:33] manifestation of the sons of God but we
[49:37] understand these translators are showing
[49:40] you it's not just a a manifestation but
[49:44] a revelation
[49:46] the word revelation tells you that
[49:51] something was hidden
[49:54] something had to be healed
[49:56] before it can be revealed something had
[50:00] to be a mystery before it can be
[50:02] revealed I'm sure you know what a secret
[50:05] is
[50:06] and a secret is something that's hidden
[50:10] until it's actually spoken about or made
[50:15] known to others that they will know what
[50:19] it is that you held a secret and human
[50:22] beings are like that if two people are
[50:24] over there and they're talking and then
[50:26] you notice they'll lower their voice and
[50:27] they're talking right away you're
[50:29] wondering I wonder what they're talking
[50:30] about well this is what the Bible is
[50:33] telling us the whole creation is waiting
[50:37] with expectation to find out what it is
[50:40] that that God had hid all of all over
[50:44] all these ages Amen in so much that Paul
[50:48] said that there were things that God hid
[50:51] that even the angels desired to look
[50:55] into
[50:56] but they were not allowed to look into
[50:58] they were not allowed to see amen they
[51:02] weren't allowed to know the secret of
[51:04] redemption The Mystery of the church
[51:07] ages there were labeled by God's grace
[51:10] to look into the mystery of the
[51:13] dispensations and the sense conscience
[51:15] and so on Down the Line there were not
[51:19] able God did not allow them to see the
[51:22] extremity of his plans
[51:25] because he didn't want to expose or
[51:29] disclose to the devil right that's the
[51:33] reason why when John God begins to
[51:37] reveal at the end now God is revealing
[51:39] to John what it is a outline of what he
[51:44] had planned and God not wanting that to
[51:48] come to the devil said John I'm telling
[51:51] you when John was up he said but don't
[51:53] write
[51:54] don't write this part you're allowed to
[51:57] write the other parts they can have
[51:59] scripture that they can read that they
[52:01] can go you know they can know some of my
[52:04] plans but at this part when it gets to
[52:07] this part don't you write that down
[52:10] that part is not to be Unwritten so
[52:13] we're not talking here today to you off
[52:16] of just comparing scripture but we are
[52:19] bringing to you by the supernatural
[52:21] enablement of the Holy Spirit the
[52:24] unwritten word of God
[52:27] Hallelujah not different from what's in
[52:30] here but the unwritten word so that your
[52:35] spirit amen will be able to pick up if
[52:40] you have the spiritual equipment
[52:43] the unwritten word that God has placed
[52:47] out there now for the True Believers to
[52:50] be able to receive it
[52:52] amen amen yes sir now that mystery we
[52:59] find in if you will turn in your bibles
[53:02] if you have them I believe it's
[53:04] Colossians 1 25 to 26 or if it can be
[53:09] put up on the screen where we can all
[53:12] see it
[53:13] you understand that God is talking about
[53:16] this mystery
[53:18] and now we understand
[53:21] well
[53:23] wherefore I am made a minister according
[53:28] to the dispensation of God which is
[53:31] given to me for you
[53:33] to fulfill the word of God
[53:36] for the mystery which had been hid
[53:41] from ages it hit from all them Church
[53:44] ages
[53:45] hit from ages not for ages that is a
[53:51] fact it's hidden for our ages but even
[53:53] from the church ages he's saying is I
[53:56] mean him from ages and from Generations
[54:00] but now is made manifest to his sense
[54:07] not to the whole world
[54:09] but to the True Believer to the elect
[54:12] it's made manifest it's being made known
[54:16] that the True Believer will recognize
[54:19] the word of the Living God hallelujah
[54:22] amen now we understand that uh God asked
[54:28] Joe
[54:30] he says job where were you when the
[54:33] morning Stars sang together
[54:35] and the sons of God shouted for Joy
[54:39] where were your job see God was trying
[54:41] to jog
[54:43] job's spiritual memory
[54:47] he's telling him job you're not just
[54:50] here on the earth for 70 years or 20
[54:53] years that you're living
[54:55] but you were there back there with them
[54:58] Sons back there but can you remember
[55:00] where were you when you were among those
[55:04] Sons can you can that memory come back
[55:06] to you now we understand therefore what
[55:10] that tells me that the sons of God are
[55:14] that mystery
[55:16] the sons of God the bride of Christ the
[55:20] elected of God the the attributes of God
[55:24] the the seeds of Grace that they are the
[55:27] ones that were
[55:30] um let you conceive a thought
[55:33] every one of us from time to time will
[55:36] conceive a thought in our minds God our
[55:39] Father our mother or everything God
[55:43] conceived of us in his thoughts
[55:47] so we were hid in the mind of God
[55:51] we were hid in the thoughts of God away
[55:55] from everything else because remember
[55:58] God he was he is Elohim
[56:02] which is the self-existent one
[56:06] which means there he says in Isaiah
[56:09] there is none beside me there's none
[56:12] before me none after me nobody else I am
[56:16] the only one
[56:18] thank God we believe in one God
[56:22] we believe his name is
[56:25] come on
[56:26] we believe his name is Jesus Christ
[56:30] Hallelujah for there are many jesuses in
[56:33] Mexico and in the Spanish countries but
[56:35] there's only one Jesus Christ
[56:38] we believe is God in the father God and
[56:41] the son God in the Holy Ghost God the
[56:44] only one
[56:45] I am the Lord amen hallelujah yes only
[56:49] one God and we serve him with all our
[56:51] hearts we give glory to God so the sons
[56:54] of God were hid in the mind of God and
[56:57] God was turning to one of his sons and
[57:01] saying can you remember
[57:04] when you were way back there
[57:07] can you remember but he couldn't because
[57:09] now he was born in sin shaped iniquity
[57:12] and the shock of sin had thrown the
[57:15] whole human race into confusion where we
[57:19] can't even recall or remind remember who
[57:23] we really are we think ourselves just as
[57:27] a as Mortals that just come on the earth
[57:29] for a span of time and then we just go
[57:32] off and take a step in the dark and we
[57:34] are no more but the God is trying to
[57:37] tell us from the word here
[57:40] that uh we are not so because now the
[57:44] human race is we know it's not uh
[57:48] completely the way God wanted it to be
[57:52] it would have been only God's people but
[57:54] the devil came in and sowed his seed
[57:57] and therefore it becomes uh mixed up we
[58:01] don't know who is who
[58:03] you know sentences will come to church
[58:05] too you say what
[58:08] you mean Satan's come to church no the
[58:11] Bible tells us there's many scriptures
[58:13] that say and the sons of God came
[58:15] together in the presence of God and
[58:18] Satan was there amongst them
[58:21] and he came up and even asked God do you
[58:24] want me to go down and lie in the mouth
[58:25] of this person do you want me to go and
[58:27] go and and get that King over there stir
[58:30] him up for war or something uh he he has
[58:34] to ask God's permission
[58:36] amen right but yet he tries to make us
[58:38] think that he's in power and he can do
[58:40] whatever he wants but he can't he can't
[58:43] touch you as a Believer he can't do
[58:45] anything to you as the daughter of God
[58:47] he can't do anything to you as a Son of
[58:49] God unless God permits it
[58:52] you remember when David the king of
[58:55] Israel was coming in and mephibosheth
[58:58] took mud and was throwing it at David
[59:00] and pelting him with more than
[59:02] everything else like that and uh the
[59:06] soldier took his sword to cut off that
[59:09] man's head David said no
[59:11] he couldn't even Pelt a piece of mud at
[59:14] me unless Jehovah permitted it
[59:17] and if Jehovah permit him to Pelt that
[59:20] mud he must have a reason why
[59:23] and I won't have nothing to do with it I
[59:25] wouldn't touch it right you see because
[59:27] God wasn't watching at the man felt in
[59:30] the mud God was watching at David's
[59:32] reaction
[59:34] and God is not watching at the people
[59:37] harassing you haranguing you cursing you
[59:39] swearing at you or coming against you
[59:42] reproaching you for the word and calling
[59:45] you names or you're trying to block your
[59:48] way step in front of you
[59:50] drive that car deliberately to block you
[59:53] off or anything like that no God isn't
[59:56] watching that God is watching at your
[59:59] reaction or are you going to react in
[1:00:02] the spirit of Christ
[1:00:04] are you going to react like a devil
[1:00:07] in other words you'll pull out your
[1:00:09] sword you pull out your red shield pull
[1:00:11] out the hammer from your scar trunk and
[1:00:13] come out of there not God God is
[1:00:17] watching your reaction amen is that
[1:00:21] right
[1:00:23] I mean like you don't get into those
[1:00:25] kinds
[1:00:27] because there's some individuals can be
[1:00:29] really getting your nerves
[1:00:32] and really aggravate you I mean I know I
[1:00:35] do you sometimes and you feel like maybe
[1:00:37] give me a punch in the mouth but uh
[1:00:39] still thank God that Lord has helped you
[1:00:41] that you you have never done that yet
[1:00:43] but you see I've got to tell you things
[1:00:45] you don't want the hair or you don't
[1:00:47] like hearing and that's what I have to
[1:00:51] do from the word of God Amen I got to
[1:00:54] preach the word to you amen amen
[1:00:56] hallelujah do you want to work
[1:00:58] do you want the word
[1:01:00] or do you want biscuits you know you can
[1:01:03] have biscuits you know denominational
[1:01:06] biscuits you know nice graham crackers
[1:01:08] or something like that or or you can
[1:01:11] have soup made from you know the shadow
[1:01:13] of a skinny chicken so
[1:01:16] and you can drink that soup and see how
[1:01:19] it's going to strengthen you but that's
[1:01:21] not what we are here for
[1:01:23] amen we are here for the word of God
[1:01:26] we are here to receive God's word
[1:01:27] hallelujah so we're finding
[1:01:31] that God being our spiritual father
[1:01:34] mother
[1:01:35] we were hid in him
[1:01:38] before the foundation of the world
[1:01:42] in other words true sons and dust of God
[1:01:46] don't get uh saved here
[1:01:50] uh the lamb was already slain before the
[1:01:54] foundation of the world
[1:01:56] they're not saved here 19th of so-and-so
[1:02:00] date this year I come to the Lord no no
[1:02:03] sons and dust of God ours Eternal as God
[1:02:07] is eternal
[1:02:09] so what are you talking about well you
[1:02:11] know goats bring forth goats sheep and
[1:02:13] Fort sheep Horseman fourth horse and God
[1:02:15] brings forth
[1:02:17] ah then Jesus say if you are a son of
[1:02:21] God he says you know he says you know
[1:02:23] sons of God you are sons of God Amen
[1:02:28] Hallelujah did not the scripture call us
[1:02:31] sons of God Amen so your sons you're not
[1:02:35] even servants
[1:02:37] of God you serve God because as Sons you
[1:02:42] want to serve God but then there's the
[1:02:44] classes in the book of Redemption where
[1:02:46] you have servants you have guards and so
[1:02:49] on that are going to be there but thanks
[1:02:51] be to God we are sons of God
[1:02:55] he said Jesus said he said the servant
[1:02:57] you put him out whenever you want you
[1:03:00] fire him but the son he he abides in the
[1:03:05] house forever
[1:03:06] Hallelujah sons and thus of God are in
[1:03:10] the house of God forever
[1:03:12] praise the Lord why by blood relations
[1:03:16] by Blood connections we are connected to
[1:03:20] the Lord by the connection of his blood
[1:03:24] and the blood of God is Not blood that
[1:03:27] we know here but the God's blood is
[1:03:30] Spirit blood the Holy Spirit the token
[1:03:33] is the blood of God that lives in US
[1:03:36] praise God so we made a Life by the
[1:03:39] spirit of God flowing through our lives
[1:03:41] our lives are cleaned and purged by the
[1:03:45] presence of the holy spirit being in our
[1:03:48] lives our lives are empowered and given
[1:03:51] spiritual health and matured by the
[1:03:54] spirit of God living in us hallelujah
[1:03:56] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:03:59] that is in the world
[1:04:02] so we were hidden God
[1:04:04] and we were hit there before the
[1:04:07] foundation of the world and therefore
[1:04:09] you are regarded as the mystery or the
[1:04:14] mystery of God this thought the devil
[1:04:16] was trying to get at but couldn't find
[1:04:18] out what it was but we were the sons of
[1:04:21] God in the mind of God and we were
[1:04:24] conceived there in the mind of God now
[1:04:27] let me bring it to me to you on a
[1:04:29] literal level now every one of us
[1:04:31] sitting here was hidden in our mother's
[1:04:34] womb
[1:04:36] before we came to a manifestation
[1:04:39] before we become revealed and then your
[1:04:42] features can be seen your face your uh
[1:04:46] and as you mature then your nature
[1:04:48] begins to show your own personal
[1:04:50] character begins to disclose itself you
[1:04:53] don't have to do anything it just starts
[1:04:55] to disclose itself it starts to make
[1:04:57] itself known but you are HID in God you
[1:05:00] were hid in your bomb until you go
[1:05:03] through a certain period of time and
[1:05:05] then you come to a place where you are
[1:05:08] formed and shaped and then it brings you
[1:05:11] to a manifestation you are born
[1:05:14] Hallelujah from your mom now in the same
[1:05:18] manner I'm pulling the same thought down
[1:05:21] so were we God knowing that the world is
[1:05:25] mixed
[1:05:26] and it's filled with the Serpent's Seed
[1:05:29] as well as the seed of God
[1:05:32] for Satan Cain's generation spread
[1:05:36] around the whole world as well as Abel's
[1:05:41] generation through Noah and Abraham and
[1:05:44] all of them also spread around the world
[1:05:46] of God War the world and they're mixed
[1:05:49] in together as humans and no not this
[1:05:54] one from that one or the other one we
[1:05:55] don't know but it's what is in the
[1:05:58] individual that makes the difference
[1:06:01] what's in there because God's Sons and
[1:06:04] Daughters he planted in them this is the
[1:06:06] parable where he said a certain man went
[1:06:08] forth to soul and he sowed seeds and
[1:06:11] some fell here and some fell there you
[1:06:13] know they fell everywhere it was God
[1:06:15] telling you what he did planting his
[1:06:18] sons and daughters now that's let me
[1:06:22] come to that word when it says Sons
[1:06:24] because in actual fact uh this of course
[1:06:28] you will think it's controversial but
[1:06:30] there are no female angels
[1:06:34] there's nothing like a female angel
[1:06:37] and that is why Jesus said there is no
[1:06:40] male and female in heaven
[1:06:42] with God there is no male and female
[1:06:45] do you agree with that
[1:06:47] all right because when you don't say
[1:06:49] amen I think oh no what is he saying
[1:06:52] there but Jesus himself said there is no
[1:06:57] male and female in heaven
[1:07:01] and when it says Sons it's really
[1:07:03] children
[1:07:06] offsprings of the Almighty
[1:07:08] okay that's what he's talking about so
[1:07:11] even if I use the term Sons I want you
[1:07:14] to understand what I am talking about
[1:07:16] I'm not talking about just men I'm
[1:07:19] talking about all of you that are here
[1:07:22] that are believers amen I'm not talking
[1:07:25] about church members I'm not talking
[1:07:27] about make-believers I'm not talking
[1:07:29] about unbelievers I'm talking about true
[1:07:33] believers
[1:07:34] okay there is no male and female with
[1:07:39] God
[1:07:40] only those children that were in him in
[1:07:44] his talks conceived in his thoughts in
[1:07:47] his mind when they were sent down here
[1:07:50] upon the Earth then some were put in
[1:07:54] male bodies some in a female body
[1:07:58] you understand
[1:08:00] no
[1:08:01] humanly speaking there is a difference
[1:08:05] but on the inside there the spirit man
[1:08:09] the soul that's in there Jesus said
[1:08:12] there is no mail nor female in Christ
[1:08:20] praise the Lord
[1:08:22] now you got Brothers Be watchful how you
[1:08:25] take care of your wife
[1:08:27] and wife You Gotta Be watchful of how
[1:08:30] you take care of your husband
[1:08:31] right because you see uh sometimes you
[1:08:35] say oh
[1:08:36] um the women came out Eve came out from
[1:08:40] his side therefore she must be second
[1:08:42] class no he she came out from his side
[1:08:47] she didn't come out from under his feet
[1:08:50] so that he should step on her no now
[1:08:53] sisters I want you to know we are not
[1:08:55] here to step on you no sir because God
[1:08:59] didn't take you out of his feet right
[1:09:01] God didn't do that but he took you from
[1:09:05] his from his side as a symbol that uh
[1:09:08] she's a help meet she's to stand beside
[1:09:11] him there to walk together by the grace
[1:09:15] of God hallelujah that's the way it
[1:09:17] ought to be in a real marriage a real
[1:09:20] Union hallelujah praise God and I'm not
[1:09:24] talking about sexual relations I'm
[1:09:26] talking about the union of soul to soul
[1:09:28] mind to mind Spirit the spirit will meet
[1:09:32] Hallelujah and the two shall be one
[1:09:35] praise God and that where the other
[1:09:38] parts of our human uh relevance that
[1:09:42] that's just natural that's just human
[1:09:43] but the real part is a spiritual part
[1:09:47] where God unites them in one and Spirit
[1:09:50] one in mind one in thoughts oh praise
[1:09:54] God you ever notice in a real in a real
[1:09:57] marriage after a while sometimes the
[1:09:59] husband and wife find themselves
[1:10:01] almost saying the same things at the
[1:10:03] same time
[1:10:05] because their Union starts growing
[1:10:08] spiritually to the point where almost
[1:10:11] almost knowing what the other person is
[1:10:14] thinking without them even talking it
[1:10:16] starts getting like that but that's not
[1:10:18] my subject today I don't know how I got
[1:10:19] after that maybe somebody here needed
[1:10:22] that but but praise the Lord but the
[1:10:25] point is that I'm making that we were
[1:10:28] hidden God we were ahead in our moms and
[1:10:33] then God turns around and allow those
[1:10:36] sons and that is God to be hid in the
[1:10:40] church world in the church womb the
[1:10:43] church
[1:10:44] and I'm talking about the worldwide
[1:10:47] church here hidden the womb of the
[1:10:49] church everybody is a member everybody
[1:10:52] can run to the Altar and cry as they
[1:10:56] wipe off the mascara and everything else
[1:10:59] and say I'm born again you know you see
[1:11:03] them on TV also
[1:11:05] I'm saved I'm saved I'm born again but
[1:11:09] Esau sought repentance with tears and he
[1:11:12] couldn't get it because the fact is not
[1:11:16] because you're human I'm showing you
[1:11:17] again
[1:11:19] sons of God
[1:11:21] Sons of Satan or people of Satan
[1:11:25] one is made to receive the word
[1:11:30] they have a connection to the word
[1:11:32] right he that happened ear to hear he
[1:11:37] Jesus tell you not everybody has an ear
[1:11:40] to hear the word of God everybody can
[1:11:43] hear preaching
[1:11:45] but not everybody can hear the unwritten
[1:11:48] word of God by revelation
[1:11:51] God reveals that to your spirit and
[1:11:55] there's a witness gospel to your spirit
[1:11:57] that you recognize that's him by that
[1:12:01] word making you know that he's talking
[1:12:03] to you
[1:12:05] you might be using me as a voice but
[1:12:08] he's talking to you that you will
[1:12:10] recognize yourself and your position in
[1:12:14] this word of God hallelujah amen so God
[1:12:18] hid his sons and daughters in the womb
[1:12:21] of the church world
[1:12:23] and but thank God he had a plan you
[1:12:27] weren't going to stay there forever and
[1:12:30] uh behind me you see of course the
[1:12:32] graphic which you can look at that
[1:12:34] whenever you wished her but God had the
[1:12:36] plan the true seven Church ages he would
[1:12:40] begin to unveil these Sons slowly little
[1:12:44] by little or you know using One
[1:12:47] messenger after the other a spoken of in
[1:12:50] Revelations chapter 1 to 3 you will find
[1:12:54] that he tells you about the messengers
[1:12:57] he would send to the church ages there
[1:13:00] will be the main speakers or voice that
[1:13:03] he will use to express himself to that
[1:13:07] particular Church age and so we know in
[1:13:10] our last day we believe you know the one
[1:13:14] that was used by God was brother William
[1:13:17] Marion Branham
[1:13:20] praise the Lord
[1:13:22] he has acknowledged that there are many
[1:13:25] others that were here on the earth and
[1:13:28] spoke for God but he had the office of
[1:13:32] the messenger of the seventh Church age
[1:13:36] to fulfill Malachi 4 5 Luke 17 31 many
[1:13:40] other scriptures Revelation 10
[1:13:41] Revelation 10 7 amen when the Heavenly
[1:13:46] angel came down with the book of
[1:13:48] redemption opened up in his hands the
[1:13:51] seals were tore off the book and now he
[1:13:54] comes down with the book open and in the
[1:13:57] book was all the names of those sons of
[1:14:00] those children of God in the book amen
[1:14:04] and the Bible says he went to what the
[1:14:08] the Heavenly angel
[1:14:10] slowing down here a bit because my
[1:14:12] thoughts are starting to move the
[1:14:15] Heavenly angel came down
[1:14:18] with the open book
[1:14:20] he goes to the Earthly Angel which was
[1:14:23] already prophesied one would be on the
[1:14:26] earth in every Church age
[1:14:29] and came to comes to that Earthly angel
[1:14:34] and reveals to him what was in this book
[1:14:39] he starts revealing to him what was in
[1:14:42] this book
[1:14:43] he goes fought now and he began to sound
[1:14:47] the trumpet the king is coming
[1:14:50] a Herald of the king that's even in the
[1:14:54] Earthly Kings have that cleared away
[1:14:56] they move all the crowds out of the way
[1:14:58] the king's coming The Queen Is Coming
[1:15:00] Jesus is coming he's coming back again
[1:15:03] uh preachers began to shout it he's
[1:15:05] coming again
[1:15:07] like it or don't like it he's coming you
[1:15:10] don't want him to come he's still coming
[1:15:11] where do you where do you you're
[1:15:13] rejoicing or you're fearful of it he's
[1:15:16] still coming but I want you to know
[1:15:18] Jesus is coming
[1:15:20] and so begin to declare that he's coming
[1:15:22] and while he's coming when the son of
[1:15:25] man comes will he find fruit fruit on
[1:15:28] this tree again well on this tree that
[1:15:31] he's speaking of spiritually speaking
[1:15:32] the fruit will be sons and daughters
[1:15:35] that will be produced at that particular
[1:15:38] time under the ministry of of Revelation
[1:15:40] 10 7 and be produced and ripened and
[1:15:43] matured that he can come and have
[1:15:45] something to eat
[1:15:48] so we now want you to know that this is
[1:15:51] a great time and season that we are
[1:15:53] living in
[1:15:54] Hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:15:58] now we know that the scripture as we
[1:16:02] read it again for the earnest
[1:16:04] expectation of the creature waited for
[1:16:09] the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:16:11] back there they were waiting
[1:16:14] they were waiting for for it to be made
[1:16:18] known who were these Sons
[1:16:20] who are these daughters who are these
[1:16:22] children
[1:16:23] where they're coming from I want to know
[1:16:26] who they are in the whole creation Waits
[1:16:29] and the reason why the whole creation is
[1:16:31] waiting expectantly is because you know
[1:16:35] all the animals all the trees everything
[1:16:38] else on the in the universe came under
[1:16:41] the effects and influence of sin
[1:16:45] we as human beings lost our instinct
[1:16:49] we don't even know the right foods to
[1:16:51] eat
[1:16:52] is that right
[1:16:54] we got to have people come and tell us
[1:16:56] what kind of food to eat just try to
[1:16:58] keep a bit healthy
[1:17:00] we lost our instincts
[1:17:02] we lost those sensitivities
[1:17:05] the animals they haven't lost that your
[1:17:09] dog is sick he knows what's grass to go
[1:17:11] and eat he knows which Leaf to go on it
[1:17:14] a rabbits and they all know they just go
[1:17:17] on they take it and they just go lay
[1:17:19] somewhere drink some water and next time
[1:17:21] you know they're up and about and
[1:17:22] they're they're on their way but we have
[1:17:25] lost all that
[1:17:27] and we've got to be protected from wild
[1:17:28] animals we've got to be protected from
[1:17:30] the Sun we've got to be protected from
[1:17:32] prickly stuff and all this stuff we're
[1:17:34] going to be doing that because we lost
[1:17:36] it amen whatsoever praise God but I want
[1:17:41] you to know brother sister the creature
[1:17:43] whole creation as this translator said
[1:17:47] they are on tiptoe they're just waiting
[1:17:50] for the sons and dusts of God to come
[1:17:53] back into their own
[1:17:54] position they have to come back into
[1:17:57] their own place of who to recognize who
[1:18:01] they really are that they're not just
[1:18:04] another church member
[1:18:06] but they are here amongst the church
[1:18:08] members recognizing who they are that
[1:18:11] they are Sons and Daughters of the
[1:18:14] Living God raised up by the power of the
[1:18:17] Holy Spirit
[1:18:18] amen glory to God hallelujah waiting
[1:18:22] expectantly who praise God so the text
[1:18:26] is trying to intimate to us that this is
[1:18:29] something going to be in the future
[1:18:32] so they were working back then they were
[1:18:36] waiting at the back then they were
[1:18:39] waiting as Paul as at the bottom of the
[1:18:43] Pyramid of Christianity growing upwards
[1:18:46] and is getting fewer and fewer as we go
[1:18:49] along until it comes to a peak field
[1:18:52] there will be will find it but now we
[1:18:56] find out France that right now A Paul
[1:18:59] and them were waiting for this
[1:19:01] manifestation of the sons of God but
[1:19:04] praise God we I want you to know this is
[1:19:08] the season
[1:19:09] this is the time
[1:19:12] we are not talking about prophecy we are
[1:19:15] in the prophecy
[1:19:18] you are part of the prophecy of this
[1:19:21] book
[1:19:22] you are walking in the living Prophecies
[1:19:26] of the word of God being made known in
[1:19:29] this hour hallelujah praise God Amen
[1:19:33] Hallelujah you say brother Simon when
[1:19:36] will this revelation of the sons of God
[1:19:38] take place it's taking place now
[1:19:42] that's second place right now praise God
[1:19:45] the revelation of the sons of God the
[1:19:49] unveiling of God
[1:19:51] Christ is the mystery of God now being
[1:19:55] revealed in his sons and daughters who
[1:19:59] are now being identified by his personal
[1:20:02] presence in their lives and making
[1:20:05] themselves known to the world about them
[1:20:08] and around them without them having to
[1:20:11] say one word
[1:20:12] because it's not my works of
[1:20:14] righteousness which you have done or can
[1:20:17] do
[1:20:18] you do that in gratitude and in grace to
[1:20:20] God because you love him you want to
[1:20:22] serve him but it doesn't make you Holier
[1:20:25] or more righteous because you're fasted
[1:20:28] more days or you you did this or you
[1:20:30] didn't eat that or you didn't drink this
[1:20:31] or you didn't drink the other no it is
[1:20:34] not based on that it's best on God's
[1:20:37] election
[1:20:39] it's based on God's choice of you in his
[1:20:43] mind from before the foundation of the
[1:20:46] world
[1:20:48] you are now accepting his choice
[1:20:51] but what you already chose
[1:20:53] and giving your life to him to love him
[1:20:57] and to serve him praise the name of the
[1:20:59] Lord go praise God so all creation has
[1:21:03] been waiting for the time
[1:21:05] which is now
[1:21:06] when the sons and dust of God
[1:21:09] we begin to recognize
[1:21:11] who they are and when they recognize
[1:21:15] they will start to have a what a uniting
[1:21:18] Time
[1:21:19] is that right right look when when it
[1:21:23] comes winter here in Canada what happens
[1:21:26] the first thing you notice all the geese
[1:21:28] start flocking together
[1:21:31] just start flocking together and you're
[1:21:33] hearing all these Canadian geese honking
[1:21:36] Hong Kong all around the place what
[1:21:39] what's going on they're getting ready to
[1:21:41] leave

[1:21:47] get it all price God
[1:21:53] but you're ready to leave
[1:21:56] praise the Lord
[1:21:58] oh my they're getting ready to leave
[1:22:01] praise God then one day you want to see
[1:22:04] them take to the skies they're gonna
[1:22:06] circle like that oh my and all of a
[1:22:09] sudden you only see one of those geese
[1:22:12] start heading down south
[1:22:14] amen and then you see them form a v like
[1:22:18] behind him as they're going down there
[1:22:21] together they're going down south praise
[1:22:24] the lord they're getting away from the
[1:22:26] cold Frosty air of denominational
[1:22:29] teaching and Creeds and traditions and
[1:22:33] all kinds of mixed ups and all kinds of
[1:22:35] money traps that they have and all kinds
[1:22:39] of membership traps and everything else
[1:22:41] oh they're heading away from all of that
[1:22:44] nonsense they're going out of there and
[1:22:47] when they're going over there they form
[1:22:48] a v they're declaring this is our
[1:22:51] Victory Day praise God and when we leave
[1:22:54] this place brother sister that's our
[1:22:57] Victory Day where and we head out to
[1:22:59] here by the grace of God oh praise God
[1:23:02] and I believe it won't be long
[1:23:06] I don't mean I don't know if it's gonna
[1:23:07] be tomorrow but I'm not telling you it's
[1:23:09] going to be tomorrow I don't have no
[1:23:11] date or anything like that amen but I
[1:23:13] just know in my soul it won't be long
[1:23:17] praise God hallelujah amen praise God
[1:23:21] but that uniting time has taken place
[1:23:23] now
[1:23:24] amen where we are brought together not
[1:23:28] in church membership we are brought into
[1:23:30] a Unity not by leadership telling you
[1:23:33] that you have to unite but we are
[1:23:35] brought together in a Unity that the
[1:23:37] Holy Spirit himself brings about and
[1:23:40] Paul calls this oh that I may make all
[1:23:45] men see oh what is the fellowship of
[1:23:49] that mystery
[1:23:50] when the Mysteries revealed to this one
[1:23:52] that one the other one then that brings
[1:23:56] them into a fellowship
[1:23:59] and they can Fellowship around that
[1:24:01] revelation of the mystery that God had
[1:24:04] hid in his mind through all these
[1:24:06] Generations aren't you glad that you can
[1:24:09] say I am one of them
[1:24:11] can you say I'm one of them
[1:24:14] see I'm one of them
[1:24:16] raise your hand if you're one of them I
[1:24:19] believe I'm one of them I'm one of them
[1:24:23] among one of them
[1:24:26] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of
[1:24:29] them
[1:24:31] I'm one of them Holy Ghost people
[1:24:35] amen I'm so glad that I can say one of
[1:24:40] them
[1:24:41] oh praise God we are one of them glory
[1:24:45] to God Amen yes sir Hallelujah so God at
[1:24:50] this time and I wouldn't even go out
[1:24:52] with those scriptures Jesus talks about
[1:24:53] oh there's a time going to come when
[1:24:55] he's going to send his angels and a lot
[1:24:58] of people thought it meant Heavenly
[1:25:00] Angels but he's talking about these
[1:25:02] Earthly Angels Angels meaning messenger
[1:25:06] the word Angel actually means messenger
[1:25:08] and there are Heavenly Angels Earthly
[1:25:11] Messengers Angels also and so here we
[1:25:15] find that they are supposed to do what
[1:25:17] divide
[1:25:19] divide because the Earth as I said
[1:25:22] before is all mixed up mix up with
[1:25:25] everything and humans we don't know but
[1:25:28] what makes the dividing Hebrews 4 12 for
[1:25:31] the word of God is quick and sharper
[1:25:34] than the two-edged sword oh praise God
[1:25:38] and the word is going to make the
[1:25:41] difference
[1:25:43] Hallelujah one hears the word and it's
[1:25:46] too hot
[1:25:47] is that right
[1:25:49] and if there's a seed of God inside the
[1:25:52] other individual they hear the same word
[1:25:55] of God and say oh my this is nice
[1:25:58] hell the word is making that seed come
[1:26:01] into life
[1:26:02] come into manifestation an expression
[1:26:05] then one loves the sunlight and the
[1:26:08] other one hates it oh praise God but I
[1:26:12] love the light praise God because we
[1:26:14] want to walk in the light as he is in
[1:26:17] the light having Fellowship one with the
[1:26:20] other and the blood of Christ amen
[1:26:22] cleanses us from all our sins amen one
[1:26:26] we walk together like that say Amen so
[1:26:29] as this division is taking place
[1:26:33] where are you today
[1:26:36] which group are you in
[1:26:39] which side are you on
[1:26:43] he asked Joshua choose you this day whom
[1:26:47] you will serve
[1:26:49] you want to take that facade of
[1:26:51] Christianity out there called
[1:26:52] churchianity and think that that is real
[1:26:55] Christianity
[1:26:57] the devil tried to paint a picture that
[1:26:59] real Christianity is that you have to be
[1:27:01] ascetic and you have to be Monkish and
[1:27:05] you have to be this and you have to be
[1:27:06] that and that is not real Christianity
[1:27:09] risk real Christianity is to be free
[1:27:12] and you are totally free you can do
[1:27:15] whatever you want to if you're a real
[1:27:16] Christian but because you're a real
[1:27:19] Christian you don't you yourself don't
[1:27:22] want to do certain things because it
[1:27:25] will be against your heavenly father
[1:27:28] and you do that not because just the
[1:27:30] scripture tells you or you're under some
[1:27:32] commandment no you read all that and you
[1:27:35] know that's true but you're doing it
[1:27:36] because it's in your heart not to do
[1:27:39] that not to do this not to do that you
[1:27:42] are moved by that praise the name of the
[1:27:44] Lord hallelujah grace of God hallelujah
[1:27:47] now you say well who are these sons of
[1:27:51] God
[1:27:52] what is the nature of their
[1:27:54] manifestation how are we going to be
[1:27:58] able to to know them amen but it's being
[1:28:02] revealed right now it's your reaction to
[1:28:05] God's word
[1:28:08] Hallelujah
[1:28:09] let me give you an example now uh there
[1:28:12] was this eagle and the eagle
[1:28:15] um had an egg and a farmer kind of stole
[1:28:19] that egg and took it on his farm and put
[1:28:22] it under some hands and and and and you
[1:28:26] know the heat from from any bird is
[1:28:29] about I forgot how many degrees but it
[1:28:31] is enough to hatch an egg
[1:28:34] um some Robins actually hatched a few
[1:28:36] out right by my house there and and
[1:28:39] stuff so they're sitting on it and then
[1:28:41] they bring it to that place so he

[1:49:30] how she acting like that but you know
[1:49:33] when it was probably proven when the day
[1:49:36] came a year later
[1:49:39] and they were all laughing and mocking
[1:49:42] and said look the Dead Come and he
[1:49:43] hasn't even come for you so he was
[1:49:45] making a fool of you all this time and
[1:49:48] then all of a sudden they heard the
[1:49:50] sound coming
[1:49:52] and here he comes back in those days
[1:49:54] with his carriage and they stop in front
[1:49:57] of the gate he did not even come in he
[1:50:00] just called out to her gave a shout and
[1:50:04] she believed him
[1:50:06] and because she believed him she
[1:50:09] prepared all her wedding garments she
[1:50:12] was knitting in the night when they were
[1:50:13] sleeping and putting all her stuff
[1:50:16] together sewing and doing whatever she
[1:50:18] has to do uh what do you call it a
[1:50:20] Trudeau or a true Soul or

[1:50:26] they're putting all things she put it
[1:50:27] all together and brought it right
[1:50:32] to the back there one of the Coachmen
[1:50:36] came and brought it in and she just went
[1:50:38] out sat beside him and they drove away
[1:50:42] in that Carriage amen
[1:50:45] that was the proof that she was indeed
[1:50:48] won his chosen one oh praise God that
[1:50:52] will be the day when you will recognize
[1:50:55] all his chosen ones within those Gates
