morning as we come to celebrate the Lord's Supper to Fellowship together this morning to uh rejoice in the word of God because we know that the Lord has a word for us this morning anytime we assemble ourselves as Sons and Daughters of God with expectation in our hearts the Lord has a word for each and every one of us amen we just need to recognize and be listening amen praise God and if you've prayed and you've believed the Lord I believe you'll be blessed today amen well it's been an interesting week to say the least amen um the past week uh the US went through some uh interesting elections and uh here it is we have the Trump back in the house the White House come the new year and you know it was it was interesting um uh you know back in 2016 I remember when uh he was he was running for the election and I was in insired at that time you know to minister on the last Trump at that time and then he ended up you know coming into the into the White House and four years um in his office and then you know it's interesting about uh two weeks while you know the last few weeks we've been ministering on on the church in Israel and and uh we've been sounding the trumpet and uh you know it was about maybe two weeks ago I I started to get all this inspiration to minister again on the last trumpet and it was you know it was uh and then I realized oh wait a minute I'm not ministering next Sunday Pastor Simon was ministering so I said oh it's going to be after the elections and so I'll just leave it alone and um and you know and then the inspiration just kind of left me but then all of a sudden here he is back you know and uh he was elected uh so I believe the Lord You Know listen the Lord is the one that deals and raises up individuals governments kingdoms Kings he's the one that places them into their positions and puts them on the Thrones amen go back into the Old Testament you'll see it over and over again how it was that the Lord did these things why in order to fulfill his prophecy so that his word could be fulfilled so all of these things that that that we've seen happening and we're witnessing now more than ever before we are seeing Israel um you know in the situation that they're in with war we're seeing the political Powers we're seeing the great mother Harlot who we know uh The Jezebel spirit that's operating that's been behind everything right from the very beginning up until now it'll be that same Spirit that's been running right from the beginning it'll run right through to the end until it and she meets her end and so praise God we realize that these things are all prophecy uh coming to pass and the Lord uses political power to bring prophetic events into manifestation amen praise God and so um let's um let's uh who has a need this morning does anybody have a need this morning as we go to prayer amen praise God I got both hands up in the air um I want to remember uh a friend of mine uh they they ask for prayer Mario Paladino um he's going to be going for a procedure on Monday uh he's having some fluid in his lungs that they need to drain out he's the indiv he's one of the the the founders of the Oakville Invitational golf um tournament that uh you know supports our our young people every year by uh supporting um you know in giving to to the ministry and so their children actually uh I saw them they were driving by last night while I was here minister while I was here uh preparing and they came in and you know we talked and they said Oh Danny you know wow what a beautiful place they were they were you know um they were amazed and they said oh please remember her dad you know um he's going to have a procedure I said we'll certainly remember Mario amen so let's uh let's let's go to prayer amen father we're grateful this morning Lord that that you are aware of everything everyone you're mindful Lord your your ways are beyond what we uh could possibly even imagine Lord you do more abundantly than what we even imagine that's what makes you so great and Lord you do things where at times we have our own ways of interpreting situ ations and circumstances but Lord we don't want to interpret anything we want to let you interpret your own word and make it real wherever you want to go father into every heart and life and situation and you saw every uplifted hand Lord you know the needs this morning remember Mario Paladino Lord remember their families uh Lord uh we thank you for everything Lord that uh you've done through them and we appreciate them Father and may you bless them Lord and remember every uplifted hand here remember brother Tim beers this morning as he ministers your word in petroia Lord uh just remember uh all the things that are you know surrounding Our Lives Lord you know that there's been attacks left right and Center Lord but we don't look at the attacks we look at the promise and that is that you said you'll be with us even in us and so Lord we stand with confidence this morning as we approach your word bless your people anoint the atmospheres anoint speaker and hearer and give us the portion that we need today in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen praise God hallelujah let's go to the um to this morning we're going to be talking about um well we're going to have the Lord's supper and we're going to look at uh the bread of life we're going to read some scriptures um we're GNA which is going to lead us into the Lord's Supper amen and we want to focus on the Lord today uh we want to consecrate our thoughts and our hearts towards the Lord's Supper we want to bring um you know we want we want the atmosphere to be real in our hearts and we want to approach it in a serious and Sovereign way amen praise God let's go to our scripture from St John chapter 6 we'll start reading from verse 25 and when they had found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him Rabbi when camest thou hither Jesus answered them and said verily verily I say unto you you seek me not because you saw the Miracles but because you did eat of the Loaves and were filled you see he was you know telling them you know like uh you know oh Lord you showed up and you know we're so happy to see you and you know what we we're we're hungry again you you know like can you feed us again you know um but here he says labor not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath God the Father sealed then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of God and Jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of God that you believe on him whom he hath sent Amen in other words believe the word pay attention to the word amen we're not here to come in you know in a traditional uh sense of the of the word you know to come here and oh we're going to have the Lord's Supper so I'm going to go I need to go have the Lord's Supper I need a little bit of the wine you know I need some stimulation no we're not come under that kind of Revelation amen we're here because because we've we've recognized when what what he said and they said therefore unto him what sign showest thou then that we may see and believe thee what Dost thou work our fathers did eat Mana in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from Heaven to eat you know they were they were saying oh well you know um we we know that uh that there's the supernatural we know that uh you can do those kind of mirac Miracles you know we know that you can you know if you want to do it again Lord and you know take five fish and take you know uh the Loaves and and and multiply it you know and we believe in that kind of Supernatural but here now then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you Moses gave you not that bread from Heaven because we know that from the scriptures that the children of Israel they ate the Mana but then they perished in the wilderness it was only a couple that actually went into the promised land because that Mana was only good for that day amen and the next day it started to rot and the worms would show up into it but this Mana that we're feeding on this bread that we've come to assemble ourselves to feed on is a bread that that that that super uh supersedes the Mana that they ate in the wilderness this one produces eternal life this is eternal life amen he says but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world then said they unto him Lord Evermore give us this bread and Jesus said unto them I am the bread you see we don't want to be looking to the Natural bread here this morning we don't want to be looking to the natural wine here this morning amen there's something that that's available to you this morning that is that goes beyond this natural bread and this wine we want to go beyond the tradition Jesus said do this in remembrance amen he saysi am that bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst God bless you you may be seated amen glory to God what a Time Saints what an hour that we're living in amen that we would uh you know come to recognize what the true bread of life is listen to brother brandom here he says in the message Paradox he say says Heavenly Father we thank thee this morning for the blood that makes us Brothers we thank thee for the Son of God who gave his life that we might be one with him in this great Kingdom upon the Earth the Kingdom of Heaven that's to be established we're looking for that glad Millennium day when our blessed Lord shall come and catch his waiting bride away the little bride tree he is that tree that was in the Garden of Eden the bread of life so is his little wife a tree the bride tree of the last days where everything has tried to bring but the great powers of God prunes the branches off that the fruit might ripen Grant Lord that we can be included in that give us eternal life life amen praise God listen this is not a tradition this is not just oh we're going to have the Lord's suffer and we're going to come together no we are feeding on the body word of Jesus Christ and the bride has come to realize that she's one with Christ that she now is a part of that bread of life amen she now comes into that kind of a communion that that goes beyond you know the kind of communion that that the that the the Christian world out there claims when they have the Lord's Supper when this people that have received a revelation on true communion come into the presence of the Lord they come to realize that they're in his presence they're having communion with him they're realizing that this is not just some tradition where we just take some bread because that's just natural that ain't going to do us any good but it's the Revelation that burns within our hearts to know that Jesus Christ is the bread of life amen and listen he says here in God's gifts always find their places in 1963 he says and Christ is our Bethlehem Christ and could prove that every man that's born of God is born in Bethlehem you know what Bethlehem means the the house of God's bread Jesus Christ was the house of God's bread amen Jesus Christ was the word he said I the bread of life that come down from heaven he that believeth in me he shall never perish if he eats this bread which is what the word if you look at the Book of John you you could read you know when you get a chance go back read the whole book of John The Book of John contains Revelation that you will not find in all the other gospels John had a way of receiving the word and and delivering the word of God so that you know and John's a type of the Bride so he he could see the word in a certain way and God's given us that same Revelation that that that John had on recognizing that the Word was God in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh that bread of life was made flesh remember bread and all those words they're only descriptions they're only words that's why we we we need to go behind the word we need to recognize what the logos of the word is actually saying when Jesus said I am that bread that comes down from heaven he's not talking about that beautiful loaf of bread that's there he's not talking about it in that way that when you partake of the bread and you and you go to the Lord's Supper you know that that you're actually you know uh partaking of of his actual body if you had a true Revelation which is what how we're going to you know we're going to just progress here we're going to look at the real body of Christ you'll come to realize that that body is a living body that has many individuals that are part of that body and I'm looking at the bride body this morning amen amen praise God and he says now every every man that's born of God is born in Bethlehem in God's house of bread cuz Christ is Bethlehem and that's what he was the bread of life and bethl means house L is God and elhem is elhem which means bread and the house of God's bread and Jesus Christ was the house of God's bread bread of eternal life and every man that's born into Christ you're born into Bethlehem God's house of bread and how that the leagues of these churches today garrisoned like the Philistines to keep the people away from it you see that's why you're not going to hear teachings on the Lord's Supper like this out in the regular Church denominational teachings you're not going to hear it in this way because this Revelation is only in the body of Christ it's only available to those that are born again into that Bethlehem into that house of bread into that place where you can feed on the word and that word never never grows old that's why you know the Mana that was in the behind the the the the the veil that was in the presence of God it never got stale it it it was always fresh you know there's there's something about fresh bread the smell of fresh bread is isn't it wonderful when you smell fresh bread and man you take it and it's warm it's it's got life in it you put some I won't put butter on it but you would put butter on there and you would eat that fresh bread because it's so tasty it smells so good well that's like the Lord the Lord is is good taste and see how good the Lord is taste and see how this word can transform your life and and and take you into places where you've never been before amen praise God hallelujah and so here now he says in in uh 1965 spiritual food in due season he says so it is today friends so it is today that the bread of life that the children Ed on follows the message to God to sustain them during the time of drought I'll tell you there's a famine in the land for the word of God the people don't realize it out there they got to just keep regurgitating the same thing over and over and over again and they'll take studies on this and take studies on that but without the mind of God without the logos of God god without the Revelation the spirit of God that anoints the word of God all the scriptures that we read are just the same scriptures that everybody else reads but why is it that when we read the scripture the holy spirit opens the word and gives us an understanding and he says here what if he stood in our presence today what if he stood in our presence right now he would act and do just exactly like he done the days when he was in flesh here on the earth the bride is part of the husband the church is the same as Christ The Works that I do shall you do also and it is the word that done it he told us that the things that he did that we would do also amen he's talking about how the bridegroom Christ and the bride are one and they're now they're they're now the bread they're actually the bread of life in this age and in this dispensation people are thirsting and hungering for there's a famine for the word of God and when they meet you and and you start to talk on the word of God there's a spirit and an anointing on on your testimonies on how you testify about the word of God how when you read the word of God life comes out of the word of God Amen and and you and out of your belly shall flow rivers of Living Water because of your Revelation and your experience in the word of God and what Christ has done in your life amen glory to God hallelujah praise God let's go to the next scripture here we're going to move along in Luke 24 verse 27-32 and I want you to notice here you see listen here carefully Jesus was you know walking on the road to Emmas with the disciples but they didn't recognize that he was actually there with them but watch and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them all the scriptures and the things concerning himself like I said if you go from Genesis to Revelation and you don't see Jesus Christ right from Genesis all the way to Revelation you need to go back and read it over again because everything that we read from the Old Testament beginning from Genesis all the way to the very last scripture is about the revelation of Jesus Christ it's about Christ The Mystery of God revealing himself bringing himself into his own Plan of Redemption where he manifests himself in many different imorph positions and and characters and and Prophets and and all the way down through until he himself came to the Earth and he was telling them all about and he was giving them scriptures all about himself amen starting from Moses well where where does Moses start Genesis so he was telling them about himself starting back in the Book of Genesis and they drew nigh unto the village with they went and he made as though he would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to Terry with them and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed blessed it and break and gave to them notice that Jesus Took the bread am Jesus broke the bread Jesus gave it to them if Jesus doesn't break the Word of Life to you personally to you as an individual if Jesus himself isn't isn't a part of your experience where God opens the word of God listen what happens here and look it and their eyes were opened and they knew him you see when Jesus comes and and reveals himself to you and he opens his word to you all of a sudden you're going to know him I remember when I listen you can go back to your own experiences but I I remember when all of a sudden I didn't I didn't know I I was reading the word you know people were telling me about the word I was watching the TV evangelist I was listening to people talk on the word nothing was penetrating my mind or my heart it was just words it was just it was just it didn't didn't mean nothing and that's what happens until you come to a place where God breaks the bread amen God breaks it and he and he hands it to you all of a sudden you take that bread and you eat it and all of a sudden you look and you go wait a minute here that's the Lord that's the Holy Spirit that's God amen he broke the bread he he showed me all about myself amen and and listen and their eyes were open and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight see because he had come in the form of his theophany this was after he had resurrected from the dead it goes to show that there's another body that if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have another one waiting that can still operate in this Dimension amen thank Hallelujah glory to God praise God you'll be able to you listen when when this Earthly Tabernacle dissolves we go to that other that other body we're going to be coming back to the Earth for 1,000 years of ruling and reigning with Christ and we're going to have eternal bodies we're going to be able to break some bread we're going to be able to have some fellowship amen praise God hallelujah but listen they said one to another did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures listen Saints I don't want to get into the whole you know because the Lord is leading me into another series but about the book and how the book is now open but he opened the book he opened the scriptures to them he opened and unveiled to them who they really were amen that's what that's what the lamb come down listen the lamb come down and he was a bleeding lamb but he had a book in his hand that was sealed with Seven Seals and nobody was worthy to open that book but the mighty Angel himself Christ himself has opened the book amen praise God and until he opens the scriptures to you you're just going to be another nominal Christian churchgoer you're going to come to the Lord's supper and you're going to you're going to come you know the you're going to leave the same way you came you might have a religious feeling but you're going to leave the same way you came unless you've entered into the house of bread amen which is Jesus Christ amen praise God let's read the let's go on in verse 24 and in chapter 24 vers 33 he says and they rose up the same hour and returned to Jerusalem and found the 11 gathered together and them that were with them saying the Lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to Simon and they told what things were done in the way and how he was known of them in the breaking of bread hallelujah praise God listen here brother Bram speaking he says remembering the Lord but now when we come together in this way there God comes down and the communion table is actually break broken bodies of the body of the Lord that we separate Among Us I'm going to read that again because that struck me he said the communion table actually break broken bodies of the body of the Lord that we separate Among Us now that is the literal body of the bread that we break break representing the body of Christ now listen careful did you notice on the day of Pentecost what a great thing we have there that God who led the children of Israel through the Wilderness he that great Pillar of Fire and on the day of Pentecost this great fire fell and then divided itself among his people amen listen this broken bread this body of Christ you you each one of you individually make up that broken body of Jesus Christ but it's it's come together it's come into the body it's come into the unity and he has given of himself a portion of himself into each and every one of those pieces of bread Hallelujah you are the ones that that that that that's fellowship and H and having true communion this this morning in The Fellowship of the body of Jesus Christ because the spirit the holy spirit of God has been been a portion of it has been placed in each and every one of you called attributes of God and that's why you're able to respond to the word and and and communion means so much more to you when you take this bread it's not about taking natural B bread but it's about edifying one another it's about nourishing one another in the body of Christ amen listen he goes on and he says here he that great Pillar of Fire on the day of Pentecost this great fire fell and then divided itself among his people oh to think how that he wants us to sit in Heavenly places then each one enjoying that warmth of the fire of the Holy H Spirit every one of you should be living in the presence of God under the anointing of the Holy Spirit having the spirit of God discern situations in your life change circumstances in your life deliver you from sickness this is something that he's placed in you it's not something that you went and got it's something that he gave you he gave a portion of himself to each and every one of us amen hallelujah oh to think how that he wants us to sit with him in Heavenly places glory to God clothing tongues set upon them like fire licks of fire god dividing himself amongst the church oh wouldn't that though that just set our hearts burning that's when we come together in Heavenly places now we know that his table where the people sat together in commune with him is like an oasis in a desert amen praise God I want you to know that you've come into an oasis you've come into a place where where you'll never thirst again you can Feast on this bread of life and you'll never thirst again your life will never be the same amen praise God it's an oasis in the desert an oasis in the desert he says and that's and there's a great spring where weary Travelers come and set around this Oasis in the desert and refresh themselves and then remembering how it got there Oh Glory to God listen you need to Jesus said do this in remembrance of me we don't want to be listen we know he went to the Cross but I'm going to tell you something when he went to the Cross you went to the Cross when he died on the cross you died on the cross when he rose from the dead you rose from the dead and you are now resurrected in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we don't have to be remembering the Lord in that in in in in his suffering on the cross he said it's finished we don't come to you know a lot of people they come to the Lord's supper and they're so sad I'll tell you why you might be sad is because you got some sin and you got some iniquity you got some things in your life that you need to get rid of you need to examine yourself so that you can enter into that place where you can come without condemnation and you can be set free and you can leave this place you know uh completely transformed by the power of God in the presence of God he says amen hallelujah God has his church is brought out laid out Among Us and it's like an oasis in this hot burning sinful desert that we're traveling through and then when we come in and talk of read the menu and then we see he turns back around and he's not fresh out of this or fresh out of that or this struck off but he's the same yesterday today and forever he's got everything on the menu he's got healing on the menu this this morning he's got he's got joy on the menu this morning he's got peace he's got restoration he's got he's got healing in your mind of your mental oppression and the and the things that the enemy is constantly bombarding you with Hallelujah this is an oasis and the menu is is ready and and and everything that that he's promised in his word is available this morning amen praise God hallelujah he says then we can just look over the menu and just take the whole thing I like that he says I like the complete course don't you congregation says amen i' just like to take it and while we are enjoying these blessings each one feeling his presence and saying amen praise God hallelujah so forth in that we can remember the one that brought it to us and made it possible the death of the Lord Jesus Christ the son of God remember him I think that's what many times that maybe we enjoy so many blessings that we forget just where they come from hallelujah it's finished Saints you can now sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and you can eat bread and drink wine and rejoice with the healing power that comes from the word of God in this day and in this hour hallelujah praise God forever more amen thank you Lord listen let's go to the next scripture here he says here in 1 Corinthians 11 for I have received up of the Lord sorry 1 Corinthians 10 the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of Christ the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Christ for we being many are one bread and one body for we all we are all partakers of that one bread Hallelujah listen the holy spirit is in the body of Christ we're not just partaking of some wine here we're partaking of the Revelation that we have in in in common when we come together in the house of the Lord we are in that one body because it's it's it's one bread for we being many are one bread this is not a separate you know you're you're not separate from Christ this morning you're in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you are the Bride of Jesus Christ you are the one that that that he's having communion with this morning he's interested in fellowship and communion with you this morning you got to know that that where you are you're you're not separate you're not you're not just an individual that's coming in by tradition and coming into the house of the Lord to just do by by by some uh Doctrine teaching to come together because because we know these are the ordinances of the Lord but he said remember me you're part of that body remember one another pray for one another edify are you edifying the body of Christ are you are you bread in the body that others can can can eat off of can enjoy good quality Fellowship around the word of God that's got a positive atmosphere years because you've you you you're you're like what it says in Philippians that you you you meditate on those good things you meditate on the things that are positive that are true that are just you're not caught up into the into the into the uh elections and you're not caught up into the politicians and listen we're neither we're neither Democrat we're neither uh conservative we're neither liberal we're we're neither Republican we are children of the most high God we are Christians in this hour amen we belong to a different government and that government is going to operate for 1,000 years and God is preparing a people God is giving them fresh bread right from from right from his his glorious body he's giving you fresh life and and giving you new life so that you can become what he wants you to be in this day and in this hour amen praise God and so at this time I'd like the brothers to come and we're going to change the order of the service and we're going to go into the Lord's Supper of the bread and the wine come ahead brother Phillip brother Desmond we're going to read the scripture in 1 Corinthians 11 23 to 2 and Jesus said for I have received of the Lord that which I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me brother Phillip would you take the bread and give thanks amen and after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had sck saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me brother Desmond would you give thanks unto the Lord thank you Lord thank you for this day that you have given us the of life this is the wi that represent the spirit that us father we ask your many blessing upon this Lord father blessing s to our bodies and father oh God help us to know you more and more father we thank you we give you praise we give you the honor we give you the glory bless your people as they partake this one that represent the spirit in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen and so we want at this time also to examine ourselves you know back in the Old Testament the children of Israel they would they would sin and they they knew that they had sinned and they would take a lamb and they would take that lamb to the priest and they'd have to sacrifice that lamb and the priest would would would slice the throat of that lamb and the blood would pour out and the life the innocent life of that lamb would be uh in place of that sinner who deserved death just like all of us before the Lord went and made the ultimate sacrifice and so today if there's anything that we want to do is we want to examine ourselves because he's already done it we are already Sanctified Justified because like we said when he died we died when he rose we Rose but because we live in this world and because we have to overcome this flesh we make mistakes we say things we do things we walk into places where we shouldn't walk and so I'm going to ask you to take a moment right now and examine yourself and and say Lord I'm sorry examine yourself before we take this bread and this wine amen the brothers would start now by handing out the bread let's get a couple of uh trustees if you have any soft music for just put that on for go for [Music] for you [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you Lord [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Music] hallelujah thank you Lord [Music] for [Music] thank [Music] you and in verse 24 he said and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me let us take the bread after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had sck saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me let us give thanks to the Lord blessed be your wonderful name father Lord thank you for allowing us to be a part of the mystical body of Jesus Christ Lord where we commune one with the other Lord and we have Fellowship ship with you father thank you for healing our bodies thank you for healing our minds thank you for meeting all of our needs thank you for being Jehovah Gyra thank you for being Jehovah shama thank you for being J Jehovah Shalom that Lord that gives us peace and rest father to know that we rest in you Lord thank you for all that you do Lord and continue to do in keeping us for the J ification through the blood of Jesus Christ we give you thanks and praise amen and now I'd like to change the order of the service as we move into the foot washing let's go to the next scripture in John chap 13: 3 to8 and Jesus knowing that the father had given all things unto his hands and that he was come from God and was sent and went to God he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself I want you to notice right after the supper he just had he just had supper with the with the disciples and now he gets up knowing that it's already a finished work you see what he said he says knowing that all things had been given already already into his hands pay attention now and GED himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him Lord does thou wash my feet and Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now now but Thou shalt know Hereafter see Jesus knew what he was doing Jesus knew that he has uh he he's got to go to the Cross he knows now what he has to do for them that they're going to be made clean that they're going to be made whole listen what he goes on and says here Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him and said if I wash thee not thou has has no part with me you see he knew that they were a part of him amen he knew that Peter was a part of him he knew that the disciples were all those that that that God from before the foundations of the world had been given to him you are not here by accident you are Sons and Daughters of God that were in Christ before the foundations of this world and he knew it he knew knew that you would come to this place he knew that you would have to go through this Humanity he knew that you would have to face situations as a human being that's why he told Peter listen you if I don't wash you you're not going to have any part of me because he knew that now he was going to be going to Calvary and the same spirit that was upon him that was on Jesus Christ that took him to Calvary was going to be released so that a portion could come down on each and every one of us so that we could manifest the word in our day so that we could recognize that that like Jesus said you're going to do as I do listen here he goes on if I wash thee not thou H has no part go to the next frame he says Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head you know all of a sudden P Peter says oh man if you're going to wash me then wash me completely but listen to what Jesus said he says he that is washed needeth not Sav to wash his feet but is clean every wit and ye are clean but not all you see Jesus was saying you don't need to be washed from head all the way down he says just your feet because that's that's the part of you that touches this Earth but your souls your attributes who you really are you're already clean Jesus already knew that the that it was a unfinished work that he was just manifesting in a human form that which was that was was was already done from before the foundations of the world the lamb had already given his life he was a bleeding bloody lamb that had already given he knew what he had to do but he had to fulfill the scripture amen and he knew that we were already clean but because we we still in this human form brother Gabriel once in a while we go into places where we shouldn't go amen we touch the Earth and we we we you know we we we we we get dirty feet and we need to wash one another because Jesus in in washing the disciples feet was showing that that when you come to that day that you know that I am in the father and ye and me and I in you then it's going to be you washing the Saint's feet you're going to be washing one another's feet it's going to be like washing his feet the bride's feet the bride age the season that we're living in where we recognize that that that we are Justified we're not we're not you know uh eating the bread and drinking the wine so that so that we can be reusi so that we can be forgiven again there is therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ amen we were talking about how the how Bethlehem is the house of God's bread and if in you if you're in that house then you're Justified your sins are forgiven as though you never done it in the first place but you need to be reminded of this hour and you need to recognize who you really are and by doing this and by coming together today I hope you're not just seeing a tradition but I hope you're seeing the word Christ in you Christ The Mystery of God being revealed in you Christ in you washing each other's feet feeding and edifying one another in the body of Jesus Christ Hallelujah but he says but not all because God knew that that there was going to be those that were going to be like Judas that's right that we're not going to be able to receive the word that's why he says you're all clean but not all Oh Glory to God for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean but the ones that were clean the ones that were attributes of God the ones that were Sons and Daughters of God they were clean before he washed their feet Hallelujah but he was showing them that you're still going to be on earth you're still going to have to overcome this Dimension you're going to still have to uh stand on the word of God you're going to have to display my word in a in a generation that that absolutely rejects Jesus Christ the word oh they'll say oh I believe Jesus Oh Hallelujah I go to the Altar and I take the body of Jesus Christ I'm eating the literal flesh of Jesus you're not eating the Flesh of Jesus if you've come into a revelation you are the body of Christ am you are the walking body of Jesus Christ in this hour you've recognized that the church like he said he came to redeem Jesus says I come not one of them is going to be lost he said my sheep hear my voice what did he mean by all of that all that the father hath given me will come the mystical body of Jesus Christ we can go on on and on and talk about how we are the family of God and each and every one of us has a part in the body of Christ amen and if you've truly come by Revelation into your position you'll know exactly what it is that I'm saying he goes on and he says here so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what I have done to you he says ye call me me master and Lord and you say well he was telling them you've got a revelation of who I am you know listen there's only one master and one Lord in the Old Testament the Lord was Jehovah God and that's why he says you're doing well if you're calling me Lord there he is saying that he is the Lord Jesus Christ Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament there wasn't anybody else it was the Lord was the word the Lord came down was made flesh amen glory to God and so they did well and ye say well he says for so I am he's telling them first he's telling them I am the bread of life I am that I am back in the Old Testament I am Jehovah God that Health all thy diseases he says I am that I am amen the I am was Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah and if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet now what's he saying there he's showing you that he's going to be in you one of these days amen he's showing you that he's going to come down he's going to indwell into the body of Jesus Christ and you're going to come to a place where you're going to recognize that you are the bride you are the female part of Jesus Christ manifesting him in this hour and the bride will always serve her husband she will be ready to wash his feet and the husband will be ready to wash her feet because Jesus showed that he would be humble enough to sit and get down on his knees and be humble enough to wash his disciples feet amen and he said Master have washed your and he says and if if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done to you amen praise God now is the foot washing mean a little more to you yes does it does it does it take you into a a different kind of relationship with the Lord that it's not just your brother that's getting down on his knees and and washing your feet and praying for you you've become a part of this Supernatural Body of Christ God has raised you up and given you a revelation of who you are in this day and in this hour and the bride needs to come to that place where she knows that she knows she's not under condemnation she's not she's not making excuses oh I can't come to church because because I got a backache you know like listen if you can't even overcome these simple little things we've got to mature we've got to come to a place where we recognize that that we are carriers of the word not only just a the word but the open word the the word that that that that that is Christ in the in the present stage of his ministry and it changes your life and you have the ability to speak and change your own life your own world your your conditions the conditions of the people around you you are anointed of God to be the bread of God in this day and in this hour where people can feed off of you where they can get stib because you are the wine you are you are filled with the spirit you're Anointed with the Holy Ghost to to to tell the people what the word really means what's what what what what the the the the Fellowship of the Lord's Supper is really all about what it means to wash each other's feet it's more than just getting down and washing your brother's feet you're washing the body of Christ you're washing one another you're cleansing the body of Christ you're edifying the body of Christ you're strengthening this local church when you participate and you come in and you come with that anointing that understanding and that Revelation that you are the word now the word ministers back to the word hallelujah praise God forever more amen glory to God Amen at this time we're going to have a closing prayer and we're going to invite the sisters to go and do their foot washing and the brothers will remain in the sanctuary and we will have the foot washing and then we will go our ways but I trust that you're going to go different today I trust that this Lord's Supper today is going to change the way you see it and and the way that you walk and the way that you talk and the way that you live and experience the word in your life amen praise God let us pray father truly Lord you said it so clearly that we're all clean but Lord we're still here we're still living in this Dimension and we still need to overcome the enemy that constantly bombards us and tells us that we're not clean that we've made this mistake we've made that mistake we've done this we've done that he's a liar he's an accuser but Lord the word that has come forth today has told us that we are Justified that we are the body of Christ that we are in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and that you stand with us and even in us oh God in this day and in this hour and we can stand with confidence knowing who who we are Sons and Daughters of the most high God there is no one above you beside you below you there is nobody but Jehovah God our
