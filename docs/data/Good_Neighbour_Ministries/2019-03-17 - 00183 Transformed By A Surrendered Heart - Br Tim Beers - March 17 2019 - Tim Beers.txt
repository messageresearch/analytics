TRANSCRIPT
========================================
what you're applying to your life but you committed to the opportunity the people are just stand about gazelle just making people stand out to go forth and step to their doctor that's what burns more than anything when you're seeing live this words and people are just holding back by doing that the burden of administers the postures are preach that word over and over and over again and people not apply the word Oh I'm so thankful that the word in the beginning was the word the Word was with God Jesus Christ is the Living Word the Living Word of God saved a wretch like me with this mess his family it changed my life and revealed to me who I was I don't understand everything do I understand everything of Who I am no when it's our not fool and I don't know what it was my brothers my sisters when I came in what drew me it's very important my brothers and sisters that's why the Bible says how to love some of the scriptures hear my message but have love one for another what true me when I stood at a level cognitive people I have all kinds of indifference as I come from a big Catholic Church big thing you know what religion was amen when I came amongst simple people in that level upper room I remember walking into brother Simon and then in the kitchen there trying to keep warm with the snow and do it is known so that up looking around you know my natural eyes when my spirit my heart was going what's these people what is this is the other dimension I was speaking up me I was calling me and I don't think I said [Music] over there you see the mental state heavyweights at that time wouldn't my condition some of you know that I think I was a staple my blog they go right to peddle she you know all right [Music] that's all I know what I wanna through those doors my wife lived attorney with me for three and a half years I'm going to get into some of my Technica's where the demon possesses you takes control of your life she lived with me through three and a half years in that condition nobody could help no pills not the good healthy and I walked through that door she didn't got the church the first night I feel about the daughters of st. Regis as she said there's other counsel she's just staring at me drink there she can be a witness she's staring at me what happened that was a stable unlikable what do you need what happened - she goes there's a leg around you and she said that she testified from that day she never seen that spirit of know that condition that was upon me what I didn't even understand what was nice for me but I gave into the presence of God [Music] this is what I be [Music] strictly business presence at the preaching of the word of God and all these things that we do in our lives whether the church doesn't bring us into the presence of God we're missing something that we read sets up there yes let me try to write this down Oh My thank you Lord we look at piling up lump on the road to Damascus and x26 emanuelle learning what changed our when God spoke as if lying persecuted now even a light came down from heaven to every true child of God because that's what reveals himself to you is hit and Shop both like to reveal himself to you but him and said bark growl earned it man I wonder if there's well the message today that colors everything the far you are if the presence of God would ever come down some people Jesus oh my god a the word God has a powers were convicted of sin ox to 37 it brings a deep conviction when Peter preached that great sermon that one could not carry by the Spirit amen and it pricked the people's hearts that's what it does it prints your heart it shows you where you are shows you where we should be it moves you forward God hallelujah his power his word ready regenerates and James 1:18 Amen hallelujah this process is simple the human heart is the soil and he is his somewhere the Word of God is the seed and drops into the soil amen amen and it marks from the heart I do like it parts of the nature gods featuring us Alleluia new tonight Springs how does that give the soul to produce fake amen nah this doesn't come by crate or your effort to read their studies but faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God doggie is about you Romans 10:17 so then faith comes by hearing the word amen and then I was wearing a couple of quotes here in the seventh Church ages we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seen and therefore we were reborn we're not only the elect can be reborn because we were seen this is the reason we could be quickened I'm not seeing there is nothing to quicken oh this beautifully in mind now take the next step redeems means divide them what are the goddamn it restores to the original order that's who we belong to say yeah we come from God we got the spoken word she cried my sheep hear my voice and they follow me they told me I can't I can't stand up for anybody else but myself but that's the word says my sheep hear my voice why is his first politics or both of disabled positive my sheep hear my thoughts and a stranger they will not a [Music] men you see you're always the Sheep you never pick RDoc turn into she that's impossible for any kind of light produces the same time and there is no change in species you know that doesn't thing with the gospel today my brothers and sisters this revelation was way high above everything you know the Gospels we have reached out there that we were some kind of paper or some kind of dog we were some kind of this and the dog has come no we were always the revolution of the hour is that I was with the father and then I came down in a body of sin might come slightly off me and I'm kidding and my amnesia I just to go my watch [Music] [Music] oh by the revelation the power revelation they have worked a revelation to us true believer to a spirit believer can never be over emphasized it means more to you than perhaps you realized I'm not talking about the book of Revelation but a part of the whole revelation that I'm certain she would give left it's tremendous to the church forever Matthew 16 where Jesus said to his disciples this questions who do you say that I am Wow this day this age who do you say that people are preaching the message of preaching another thing the bible scriptures tonight but she chooses standard in this day and age when a where god's coming forth talking word inspired were in an anointed word coming down by the Spirit of God who you say why is there so many interpretations on this way interpretations the message start developing what do you say to later this message is so simple the guidelines are so simple the instructions are so simple everything is so simple to follow God gave us a message amen to follow by faith we can follow so simple when it opens up to the bride of Jesus Christ and people are making it so complicated they always have been so complicated all about through the agency lesson when Peter got the revelation of flesh and blood has not revealed it my father which is in heaven on this rock of Revelation we know the scripture I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against any power of the flesh and he power about this world the seeking to try to use against us and Eddie the Scriptures tells me that there is no power and the gates of hell so what does this mean Saints what does it mean to me I don't know what it means to you but what does it mean to me it means the Word of God not here the Word of God has been revealed they strike in my heart you know maybe you've got to a place where the runner goggles are speaking to you as you're growing in chroma and then there's there's a place that you wonder is you want me do this every step that we change the fight some people don't want to take steps to change some people though they seem to get mean they've determined they see everything in front of their one thing except the thing I can't give me that note that's calling you and provide for you you'll make a way for you they'll do everything that you have need of to accomplish what you need to accomplish everybody down through the ages down through the Bible evening to our day that were living a prophet came and Billy Paul said brother better have the devil's number at the end of his life he had everything his faith came to a place because he kept stepping on the card was no matter I had blew through I'm not here about the desire of trials and temptations and things that they're going to have to go through you like testers that you're gonna have to go through your life some of the tests that I've been through I wish I would never ever assignment no way but you know what I always see at the end of the test in the trial I always see my face moving forward I don't get closer to God he doesn't get far away to me I get to know him more in the power is that's what I said lord I want to W in the power of your resurrection all these areas of my life I want to step out please let me tell you it's not just good enough that the message come to you it's just not good enough to hear hear good preaching it's not good enough my brothers my sisters but there's going to take a faith to produce this rapturina there's gonna be on faith that needs to be stepped up something that needs to come out like that you need to overcome and that [Music] [Music] [Music] the powerful as quick as sharper than any two-edged sword piercing divided dessert step out Saints don't worry don't let your mind get all buckled up confuse all the information that the reason this message but listen to that still small voice to speak into your heart sometimes that's those small voice speaks the same thing for months maybe even years and then you get caught away with all this what I got to do all this confusion start shopping go back to that still small voice musicians go back to that still small voice and obey it and you watch little by little a little here a little there is that about you you want to know our club leavers left you're looking at that of God woman oh God to date with power but you know that God hears their prayers you know that when they have great things happen your goodness your testimonial you see adopted with certain people pray that happens you know what and this didn't happen where they were in the closet people think it's in the closet you know their study the message that crazy and all this sudden bowed and comes down on you I'm not going to keep less to do I can quicken the last policies in the end time you can do it let's do let us little by little it's your obedience to the word this hair obedience to the still small voice best speaking and perk in your heart those little feelings those little emotions those little attitudes all these little things that God is dealing with we don't want one of the big things but we like to deal with these little things we don't want to purge our channel we don't want to get rid of gossip all these things have finger like the word come forth in your life some be plenty and hindered from the new birth in this method here the power to Word of God and I'm pleased to note that terribly close to speaking and hindering or receiving the fullness of what God has for you obedience is better than sacrifice God who said to give you all your all your works and all your all your sacrifices that you're making and he looks right into your heart you're naked before him he looks ready to hurt I'm talking about my experience I'm talking about my blog simple sings here but he sees my heart he sees every one of every intention he sees that are feeling foolishness everything poppy and the shoot is not that into the presence of those six car god the movie for he does not movie had to like deal with those things telling it to the place and get into a place you can get to a place with God and then those things called and on the comfortable space I don't know a lot of speakers it's not my both of us Washington my thoughts but sometimes the Word of God more quick and powerful and we look at what we want to see it do it can do great things here tonight if you plead brother back says if you can all get into one place one leg they're going to be no sickness here ain't gonna be nothing here that was up God well deliberate set you free Healing you what a part

everyone sit allowed God breaks through they put you right back in the same places you're leaving me here you left me here let us take the Word of God that's here to still small voice that's do you

great miracle science blunders knurled great father when it wasn't it wasn't my mic wasn't my power but was by my spirit saith the Lord it wasn't it that the great weight and the great earthquake and that but was it a still small voice all of our doubts where the word is most powerful Locker is when not still voice that voice breaks into a heart and a revelation breaks into their life in their heart and opens up to them they see clearly Lord that's what the talk about where the line everything in her life everything she is everything that the portion of work that is placed inside of her
