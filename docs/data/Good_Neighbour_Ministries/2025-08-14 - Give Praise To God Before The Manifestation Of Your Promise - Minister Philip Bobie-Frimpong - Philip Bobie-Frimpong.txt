We so thankful that your grace has made a way for us to be here tonight. You only tell us to only believe and all things are possible to them that believe Father and we are believers. Father we have confidence in your word that we are holy all that you ask us father to just fully believe. At this moment we commit brother Bill and his son Junior into thy hand as he said that he had a double pneumonia. At least they found what the causes but father that sickness couldn't hide from you and once that you have let him found the cause we know that you are still a healer. May you go and touch him wherever he is at this time. May you touch brother Bill and touch brother Bill Junior. May they be made whole right now. Father, there is no distance in prayer. Your word clarify, you will grant it to us. We said you receive not because we ask not. And you are not asking in the midst. We are asking specifically for the healing of our brother that you touch him and the son Junior. What kind of virus is we don't know. But Father, may you root out that cause of the virus and may they both be made whole. Even right now, even on the on the YouTube or in here, if anyone is sick, may your Holy Ghost touch them and heal them because your word clearly said you are the Lord God that heal all our disease. Father, I pray that you take me aside tonight and use me for your glory. And may you bless the remainder of the service who come to read the word. May you come and speak to us once more because our confidence that you are the same yesterday to today forever and we thank you for hearing our prayer. We give you all the other and the glory. Anything unlike the father we come against it. May your great holy ghost have reminance and speak to the heart of your children in Jesus name. Amen. Please be seated. Hallelujah. So I have couple of scriptures. Sorry for keeping you standing. Let's read our scriptures. Um, Romans chapter 4. I'm not going to Can you please stand up for the respect of the word? Romans 4:7 and 8. And then Romans 4:13-20. Okay. In Romans 4:7 and 8 said that saying, "Blessed are they whose iniquity are forgiven and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin." Um verse 13, for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law, but through the righteousness of faith. For if they which are of the law be faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect, because the law workketh wrath. For where no law is, there is no transgression. Therefore, it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end of the promise might be sure to all the seed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all. 17 as it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed, even God who quickened the dead and called those things which be not as though they were. Who against hope? I might think based more here. Who against hope believe in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be. Verse 19. And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body, now dead, when he was about 100 years old, neither here yet the deadness of Sarah's womb. Verse 20. His target not at the promise of God, true unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God. Heavenly Father, please bless the reading of your word in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Please be seated. Amen. So, if I'll title it, I got this thought from my last prayer meeting, but uh I didn't talk about it, but I just want to talk about it now. So my title is give praise to God before the manifestation of your promise or because benefit of your uh yeah give praise to God before the manifestation of your promise. Abraham had to believe just what the voice told him. Remember in the time of Abraham there was no physical Bible for them to read. God deal with them with a voice and they have confidence in that voice that they heard that it was God's voice speaking to them because the Bible was written after Moses time. So they were not privileged like that. You have like something as a yard stick to match it by because but because the seed of God was in them they could recognize that voice and act on that voice. And when he was 100 years old, 25 years later, he was stronger believing it than when he was 25 years ago when it was given to him. So like people that have been around now is a time that your faith even has to be more stronger than when you receive the the promise. Normally you like to go back when God called us so many things will happen. But the same God if you have seen of Abraham as the time is going and even like myself I used to say that um when I got married I said I'll never have a teenage children because by that time the rapture will be like gone. So people talking about their teenage problem so it's never going to happen to me. But then it's here they are almost 18 going on. But what I'm trying to say that that shouldn't weaken your faith. You should still have that confidence and your faith should be stronger and expect him to come at any time. Amen. And it was he he believed it and he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving praise to God knowing that he was able to perform what he had promised. Grace, can you put it on for me? and paragraph 20 that's you must come with an unfailing faith believing that God made the promise but now you have to be in a position to have that faith and that's where we are going to talk on uh paragraph 226 it works with works with works with faith whatever at 100 years paragraph 226 is grace. Yeah. At 100 years, I think I got everything from works is faith expressed. That's why I'm basing my thoughts on works is faith expressed. Paragraph 226 at 100 years old. Look, his body now dead, his manhood and Sarah's womb dead. It wasn't even considered. So tonight you don't have to consider your condition. &gt;&gt; You don't have to consider your position. You are paratic or whatever you are isn't considered. The wheelchair is not under consideration for the little boy may be paralyzed. Whatever it is, I don't know. It is under not under consideration. Don't even consider it. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the doctor said he never got out of here. The doctor said she will never come. That's not even considered. Well, look, I'm an old person. I'm getting noodle age. Not even considered. And we are the children of Abraham, not as Isaac, but his royal seed through Christ. By faith that he had Abraham's seed coming forth in the last days to shine like the stars, Abraham's children. Considered not his own body now dead, neither even considered it. It wasn't even brought into question whether God will do it or not. God said it, he would do it. Why? It was revealed to him. Amen. When it's revealed to you, &gt;&gt; you can't make it happen. It's got to be revealed to you. &gt;&gt; Then you don't even consider anything. &gt;&gt; Else how impossible it is. Don't consider what the doctor said. You don't consider what mama said, what papa said, what the preacher said, what anybody else said. You just consider what God said. &gt;&gt; In other words, you don't look at your condition. Look to that promise of God. &gt;&gt; And God promises above all things at which you prosper and be in health even as your soul prospered. &gt;&gt; Any other thing you reject it as a son or daughter of God. Even though your present condition might not show it, the daughters can give their report. Everyone can say whatever they said. But the true seed of God, a true seed of Abraham, you will not consider them. You're going to give thanks to God as Abraham was because Abraham did not wait until he see the manifestation before giving thanks to God. And so many of us when God give us promise or something is delaying, we pray over it. You I know I believe that a child that cries more, he gets the best. You keep on crying, crying, crying. But there has to be a time that the crying has to end because just like that um the widow that bothered that judge after a while the judge get worried and ask give her request to her. But what I'm trying to say is that as a true son of God, when you prayed and God answered the prayer, you know it's answered. Nobody has to tell you. &gt;&gt; And once you know that is answered, you don't go back to God and begging for it again. &gt;&gt; That's the time for you to give him praise. &gt;&gt; That's the time for you to thank God as you have received it p physically. Even though you you you don't hold it in your hand but come so red to you that you are received the thing so you can give him thanks and praise no matter how a longer it linger you don't have to look at the condition &gt;&gt; look at that promise and give God thanks give him praise give him the glory give him the honor because he alone deserve our glory amen he deserve to be praised he deserve to be worshiped so you have to thank him for it in advance hands in anticipation expecting that thing to happen and in between that period the enemy is going to test you. &gt;&gt; Your faith is going to be tested. &gt;&gt; Don't you're not going to have it easy because it's a battle. Is that right? And it says that by violence you take it by force &gt;&gt; the kingdom of heaven. &gt;&gt; So you going to be faced a battle. But remember the battle is the loss. You have to keep on confessing your faith because Jesus Christ is the word. Confessional proration of our faith. Confession of our faith. So you got to keep on confessing, confessing and believe until that thing manifest life. You have an example of brother Abraham ministry about r the blind mind the Ryan John Ryan. He went to the ministry. He went to uh the prayer line. A bra revealed his heart. He told him everything. He said, "You are healed." And he went back. He was still blind as blind can be. He came back again. And then he said, "You are healed." He said, "I cannot see." He said, "Do you believe me what I said? I believe it." Said they go and confess. He been a Catholic. Then he start confessing. He start confessing. Praise God for healing me. Even though his physical eye was blind, but he did not consider that blindness of his physical eye. People were laughing at him. People were mocking at him. But he kept on saying, "Praise God for healing me. Praise God for healing me. Praise God for healing me." He confessed that until finally when he went to a place that the barber thought he was going to mock him and that mockery bring what? the the opening of his eyes and he did not walk he did not care about what that baba was saying he did not consider that baba's word he considered the promise of God because it was revealed to him when he went to the second time something happened in his heart and he believed that he was healed so no matter how much people were making mockery of him that mockery didn't mean nothing to him he pro he confessed confess he confessed and what his eyes would pop open like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. There are two examples that he gave about two women who came for the prayer meeting they have cancer and other sickness and they too one of them husband was saying that you bringing reproach to the gospel. He said that if you were to be in my position you wouldn't say I'm bringing reproach. She kept on confessing, confessing until that thing he and she cough it out and both of them got healed at the same time. So what am I trying to say tonight? That when God reveals something to you, you got to give him praise. You got to give him glory. You have to thank him for it. Don't consider your situation. Don't look at yourself, but look to the promise. Because by faith, Abraham, everyone that pleased God in the Hebrews, it's impossible to please God without faith. And faith is a revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it was revealed to the saints of old. By faith, Abraham, by faith, Enoch, by faith, David, by faith, every one of them has to base their confidence in the faith of God, in the revealed word of God. So without you having faith in God or having received that faith of God and revelation of a situation, you only going to confess it. You only going to have a knowledge of it. But when it's revealed to you, it become a different ball game. Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. So what what am I trying to say? Even in my own life, we had a little experience for our daughter Grace. Um when she was like two, three years. One time she was coughing like crazy and then they gave her a puff. So you were using the puff all the time. The more you even using the puff, the more she kept on coughing. And her mom become so devastated. So one time when I came back from work the mom was so sad and crying and said I don't know what to do and I said I don't know I believe that inspiration strike me and at that very moment I told her hey Rose you read the Bible it said Abraham never target at the promise of God he was constantly giving praise he waited for 25 years he never doubted this is just a couple of months and you crying, forget it. God will take control. And when that word was spoken and inspiration, the following day we went to the doctor, the doctor checked her, everything was gone. Why? She was 100% healed. Why? Because the inspiration strike and I believe that the same God that was there with Abraham that took 25 years, this was just couple of month, it was nothing to God. And God came on the scene and touched her and she never used that puff out to now because then precise asmetic condition and there's nothing found over there until now she's leaving a hole. Why? God did it. The same God that was in Abraham that faith that Abraham had I have a little to prove that God is also what in our midst because he's the same yesterday today and forever. Brother M and Kofford say that if God appeared to Moses, why can't he appear to me? Because he's the same God. He's not a dead God. Whatever he did to them, he has to do the same thing in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if we are not seeing the same thing in our life, then we playing church. We playing games. Because that God is in our midst. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He hasn't died. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. And I remember in the years 2000 or before then or after that when by God's grace I started coming to here visiting our local that time we were in um Bruce a friend a Christian friend called me from another province and we were chatting and he was telling me that oh Phil in the North America here we don't see no supernatural because people have everything that they have need of. But in Africa because the people are hungry and they don't have nothing, they have to believe God even for food. So we see a lot of supernatural and we are not seeing the supernatural in our local church over here. And I said bro talking the wrong person where I fellowship. I'm seeing God every day. &gt;&gt; I'm seeing that supernatural. I'm seeing God in our midst. And I was telling him how even somebody came how the church dedicating time they took a picture of the signboard and they saw an eagle in there as a form of a pillar of fire. And when even somebody came to the church to make a disturbances and then the pastor said you cannot disturb. You have to go. And then when he went he was still bothering the brother in his home. And that brother called cops. And when cops came, the man was going to try to lie again on him. And when he began to die, boom, heart attack, he died right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. The same thing that happened in the book of Acts. When Ananas and Safari died, they died right there. And the people saw the power of God. It brings fierce reverence the people because they saw that God was in their midst. And that same God is here tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. You might not see it constantly, but that super spiritual is behind this church. &gt;&gt; He's moving every day and then you might not see it, but that same God is here. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. So I began to talk to him what God is doing in my life and other believers. And he saw the difference that God is the same yesterday, today, and forever. He's not only limited to a geographical people, to only one side of people. If you believe God and you apply it, it will work everywhere at every point in time. Amen. Because it's a visible union of Christ. It's a mystical body of Christ. Amen. So when you are in that mystical body of Christ, it doesn't matter your geographical location. He's going to be here to meet your needs. He's going to show up in your midst. You're going to show up in your prayers. You're going to show up in everything that your hand tight because he's unchanging God. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. Our God is good. &gt;&gt; He never change. Amen. So somewhere explained that in the church ages book, revelation is vital to every Christian. You need revelation more than anything else in the church ages book. So when you look at David and his brothers, the difference between David and King Saul and his big brothers was revelation. Because his brothers, they know, they knew that they were serving a living God. And God that they were serving is more than able to defeat Goladat. They have that knowledge, but it was not revealed to them. And I'm afraid so many people in this message of the hour around the message have a lot of knowledge of what God has done through the prophet but they themselves have no experience. They have no revelation. They have not even experienced one thing that happened in his life. But if that same God is the same yesterday, today and forever and he dealt with the prophet in that manner and if you receive the same Holy Ghost that came in that prophet then that same thing will follow you. It might not be in a big way like his ministry but they're going to be the traces because remember in the book of acts when the people saw uh John and Peter they realize that they are being with Jesus Christ because they action prove it. So when you are pregnant you got when you are pregnant that pregnant will show and to give birth. So if you have Christ and you have met him in your life people has to identify will see that God that you have met because they recognize that they were ignorant and unlearned but they have been with Jesus Christ. So if you say you have then those traces has to follow your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I said this time shall follow them that believe &gt;&gt; in my name they shall cast out devils. &gt;&gt; They will lay their hands on the sick. They shall recover. Amen. They will eat poison to not harm them. So if you believe you don't see for those signs it automatically follow you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you are not looking for the signs but once that word is revealed to you automatically happens &gt;&gt; and God moves when he wants to. &gt;&gt; We can't push God's hands. We don't force God. We just lead a simple Christian life and God come on the scene when he needs to. &gt;&gt; Amen. He comes in his own time. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And that gives a confidence. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Ah, God is on time God. &gt;&gt; He will never leave. He never forsake you. Amen. Hallelujah. So what am I trying to say? that David he caught inspiration by the moment that his brothers missed the mark because they just have the head knowledge they didn't have the revelation that make the difference and when the people revelation is a thought of God &gt;&gt; and you cannot give yourself revelation but if that seed of God is hiding there when the time comes God himself come on the scene and reveal himself. Amen. So what am I trying to say? If we take someone like um the thief on the cross when he was just about to die, he said the right word at the right time and he was with God in paradise. You can take someone like Samson. He was facing the enemy. Thousand Philistines were after him and the inspiration just strike him. Pick just a jawbone. It wasn't a jawbone but his confidence was in God. It was revealed to him that God is able to do anything. With God all things are possible. Amen. And so he didn't look at the condition. He wasn't scared about the people. Once he could felt the presence of God, he picked up the jawbone that was very loose, that was very thin and defeated thousand Philistines because it inspiration strike him. And you have to be at the moment in about 2000 for about 10 for 10 15 years ago. I used to work for a client and that client I asked him hey what kind of job do you do you always at home? He was building building he built nice house and moving he said you don't know what kind of job I do I do a day trading and he was explaining to me that when they do that trading is about the price of the stocks. So sometimes he has to be able to buy the thing at a low price and sell it high. But if he miss the price, it goes high. He can never buy it. And when he makes to selling it, the thing can come down like and he loses all his money. So it's like in the moment you have to catch what is going on. So is the word of God. You have to have that revelation to catch the thing right there. Because if you missing state, that's it. because that is what happened to um I believe um Esau and Judas. They afterward sought with repentance but there was nothing found in them. It was too late. But you see those with the seed of God, they just catch it like that. They just catch like that effortlessly. They just can just catch that revelation and act on the word of God. Amen. So you must be in the moment. So is even this message that we have. Whatever dilut has it couldn't work in the time of Wesley. Whatever Wesley had could not work in the time of the Pentecost that time and in our time whatever fall in the Pentecost it cannot also work today. You have to find what God is doing now. the present stage of his ministry. That has to be revealed and has to be clear to you in order for you to please God. Because eagles eat fresh skill, fresh food, fresh anointing, fresh inspiration, inspiration for now, present tense revelation. &gt;&gt; And that manner if you leave it for the next day, it will rot. &gt;&gt; You need the mana for today. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's only thing that can admit today's experience. Listen, we are living in a time that is a wicked age. The enemy has come to the highest point. Is that right? And even if you look like military, you cannot go and use those bow. It was a bow. The time they use a bow in Africa. They use the bow and all those things to go and fight. Even AK-47 will not do the work today. You have to have sophisticated machines for the present time. Now they using ballistic materials and nuclear and all those things and drones that could specifically go and kill the enemy target and without destroying anything. So you have to be that high in this age to be able to what meet the condition of the age. So you cannot fight today's condition with 100 years as condition. Everything is changed. You your your weapon has to be sharp. &gt;&gt; It has to be today's weapon to meet today's condition. &gt;&gt; That's what the church need is the Holy Ghost for today. &gt;&gt; The token for today. &gt;&gt; That's the Holy going to help you to win the battle. You can never win it with yesterday's weapon. Those weapons are they called a cake. You need present conditions to meet that present situation. And our God is unchanging God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So those bride of Christ their eyes are wide. Amen. Amen. They are looking the eagle his eyes see everything. Hallelujah. Our God is great. He's the same yesterday to them forever. He will never leave you nor forsake you. Hallelujah. Amen. He deserved all all the glory and the honor. So we need that present tense for our present condition. Amen. Hallelujah. Our God is good. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. So what am I trying to say? If the Lord Jesus Christ is inside of you, then you become all to the people. I'm going to read this here. Paragraph 112 and 113. The same is the perfect fit. But Jesus Christ lived in a world that no one knowed about. He was an old person. He lived in a world of what? Perfect faith. And perfect faith is um perfect faith masters all circumstances. There's nothing that can stand a perfect fit. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he lived in a world of perfect faith in the perfect God in which he was. If we live in a perfect faith of a Christian to what we are, we be mystic to the world. The people wouldn't understand you. You walk in the spirit. What the spirit said will you do what is forbid you will not do. Then the people begin to say you are mystic person to them. That's the way it is all to all believers. They are mystic. The people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves. Jesus lived in a world that nobody else could touch. The disciples couldn't understand him when he spoke to them. They say this and then they said, "Why you talk in real? We don't understand this. How can this be?" See, there wasn't in the world that he lived in. See, they couldn't understand him. Nobody could understand him. Amen. So when Christ comes inside of you, you become an all person. &gt;&gt; But the same thing that God does, it manifests in you. That's why I said the sons and daughters of God are led by the spirit of God. And if you are led by the spirit of God, nobody can detect your next move. Today you can say you're doing this and then the Lord will forbid you don't do this and then it it what it stumbles the people because Satan wants something that is predicted so you can know this that that that that because you a son or daughter of God you led by the spirit of God and that spirit will lead you to what have victories where you least even what expect because he hasn't changed. Amen. And our God is good. He will never leave us nor forsake us. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And one other thing I think what I would like to do here um just I don't know I just feel it like I want I'll wrap it up and I want grace can you put this just make it play for me just maybe five minutes in a perfect faith paragraph 147 to 151 just play Can you? Yeah, it's just 5 minutes. Whatever he said, God honored what he said. Think of that. Whatever Jesus said, God brought it to pass. So, you know, his words were God's words. Now, look, that same scripture comes right back into us again. if he stays to this mountain. Oh my I I just let that stop you still see because we're going to have a prayer. We just miss the congregation pray for this one that wants to has to go. Look, he knew that he pleased God. He knew that there was nothing on his side. God had already testified this is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased. hear him. This is my beloved son in whom I'm pleased to dwell in at the day of his baptism. I'm pleased to make my abode in here. There's no condemnation to him at all. Now, when the same God comes to you and pleased to dwell in you, pleased to honor your word, what your decision is. What was Joshua's decision? Stand still, son. And it stood there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sure. What was Moses's decision? How many stick over the a river like that and call for it to open and open? See, whatever you ask and if you stay to this mountain, be moved and don't doubt. See, in your heart, but believe that what you've said will come to pass, you can have what you say. That puts you back in the word. Now, that's not skin milk. &gt;&gt; It puts you back. I know it go jumps right over top of you. See, because it can't anchor, but real Januine faith catches that right now. I've seen it, friend. Here's this Bible laying open before me. I've seen it happen, and I know it's the truth. I know God in heaven knows that I might not live through to finish this message, but I I know that it happened. I've seen it myself. I'm a witness of that word being fulfilled, &gt;&gt; and I know it is the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Stand and stand there and see the creator bring a living creature into existence right in presence of your eyes and shake your head and wonder and then look around and see him bring another one just exactly like it because you said so &gt;&gt; and turn over here and say there will be another one there and look and there it is. &gt;&gt; Now that's the truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, where should we be? There's perfect faith. &gt;&gt; No vision. &gt;&gt; Just speak the word. &gt;&gt; Never saw the squirrels. He just said the scripture what it was and speak it and don't doubt it. But what you say, it'll be there. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I took God at his word and it was am I right? &gt;&gt; That's just as powerful. And friends, as your pastor, that's just as powerful as it was when Joshua stopped the sun. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the sun was already there. The elements was moving and he stopped the movement. But this he brought something there that wasn't there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He created. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to be acquainted with a God that can take the dust of the earth someday without anything you call me back to life again that after I've been planted in the grave. Oh my, there is my faith looks up to thee. &gt;&gt; When he said that, you see God that and when Joshua was in need of the battle, he told the son that was element to stand still and stand still. But the same God when he came into his ministry, he spoke something square, something that was not there and it came to existence. He didn't use any original thing. He just spoke them into existence as he spoke Abraham needs into existence. When Abraham was going to sacrifice Isaac for the Lord Jesus Christ, he spoke from nowhere and brought the lamb for him to kill. So that same God is here tonight &gt;&gt; to speak your needs into existence. And if that God is in you and in me, then he has to going to do exact same thing through you and me because he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; And God, I believe, is going to show his bride very soon &gt;&gt; with the present conditions, the things going on. are possessed. 200 million demons have been released over on that side. And if the devil and his people and his spirits and his demons are released to the highest level, what about the release of the true journey Holy Ghost to the highest point? God is still on the scene. All the angels encamp around us. The same God, the same spirit, those that was in Peter, John, the apostles, those anointing are in the right now. And God is going to show us. We are going to do a a what do we call it? A supernatural thing. &gt;&gt; Things that the world has never seen before. &gt;&gt; Is going to be shown to the bride. He's on time God. &gt;&gt; He's here with us &gt;&gt; and he's going to show us supernatural upon supernatural. &gt;&gt; Amen. You going to see don't no one said that the one that I belong to. I'm going to see him face to face. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the world will see something they have never seen before. Because if the elements, every scripture that has fulfilled before the Lord took his bride has almost all fulfilled to the doubt. Amen. Nothing left but the coming of Christ. The only thing that is holding that those that have the attributes of God, those that are part of him that have not come to the fold, they are the only one that are wearing. And you and I are the one holding the wrath of God. &gt;&gt; If not for us, the whole world that we are holding them, the Holy Ghost is holding them. They can't do whatever they can. But once we are left from here, hell will lose on this earth. &gt;&gt; But before then, the true bride, those who are part of him, wherever they are, they will come to the fold. No wonder in the day before Calvary, he said that you not only have that ability or the ability to heal the sick, to raise the dead or but God gave us to what? Impart the Holy Ghost. You have to impart the Holy Ghost. Same Holy Ghost that you and I have received. God has given us the ability to impart it to give to others who are his seed to come into the fold because he's the same yesterday today and forever and I'm afraid what is holding most people as our pastor said last our former pastor said last Sunday sometimes the mistakes of our past the enemy always like to bring that even your present mistakes. He likes to bring that to play with your mind. But as you read from Romans 4, he said that blessed is the man whom I will not imp. And whose iniquity is what? Forgiven. So I'm encouraging you tonight. If the enemy brings anything to you in your past, you tell him that you have been bought by the blood of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. God doesn't even see your iniquities. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your sins have been washed in the blood of the lamb. It said that your seed of God remain in you and you cannot sin. Amen. If your heart condemns you not, then you ask whatever you will and God will give to you. But if you are not living right and your heart is condemning you, how can you go to him? But somewhere even said that even if your heart condemns you, God is greater than your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. So all that God need from you is to accept your healing, accept your salvation, accept your deliverance. Believe that your sins are forgiven. Bel have that confidence that the man, that part of God in you, that attribute, it can never sin. It's just the flesh that always make mistakes. But the true attribute, the true that se that part of God that lies within you, it cannot sin. If you have the confidence and faith that God that delivered you from sickness, from drankenness, from your past life, can't he deliver you from whatever problem you facing tonight? &gt;&gt; I don't know what you're going through tonight, but the same God that gave you salvation, he's here right now to give all your need to you. Ask and you shall receive. You know only thing that will hinder you if your motive and objective is not right, it will stop you from receiving whatever you have. But he said if your motive and your objective is right, then you say to this mountain, be thou removed and do not doubt in your heart. You will have what you say is based on your motive. is based on your objective. The right mental attitude will bring every promise of God to pass. &gt;&gt; So don't look at yourself. Don't look at your mistakes. Believe God's word and he will bring it to pass. &gt;&gt; He will never leave you nor forsake you. &gt;&gt; He didn't bring us this far to leave us. He didn't bring us this far to let us drown. There are promises in God's word for you and me and that promise is yours. You just have to take it. Apply the token. He said when SP and Silas when they were in prison and they have beaten them to the core for just casting out devils from that young girl who was what? Who was h the people were using to make money and the people got angry and they beat them and put them in chains and what happened? That same God came in the midnight. They began to pray. So I encourage you tonight when you have a problem in the midnight hour when all hopes are gone, you begin to pray. And when they begin to pray, the angel of God show up. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they were delivered. Amen. So it's you and me. If you have any situation and you prayed and your objective is right, God will show up at the right time. And when those angel of God, when Paul and Silas were delivered and the prison door was shaking, that centurion was going to kill himself because why? He has let the prisoners gone and there was no hope left for him because as a centurion when that thing happened he has to give his life to that and Paul is said do yourself no harm. Amen. And he said that believe God and you and your household shall be what? Be saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, when your household believe the same, have the same faith that you have, God is going to give them salvation. God is not a grandfather. But if your household believe the same thing that you believe, they also going to receive it. &gt;&gt; But it's a promise. Sometimes you may not see your children even in church or you may not see them repenting of doing that. But have to hold on to that promise because Job sacrifice and cry for his children. And when he did that, none of his children physically follow Job. But God said he gave all his children to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. He have all his children. So we have to have confidence. Don't look at the condition of your children. They sometime might be rebellious. They might do things but look to the promise. &gt;&gt; You pray for them as Job did. You do your part. And the prophet even when he has that vision, he said that all that you loved and all that loved you is given onto you. It wasn't only for Abraham. is for all those sons and daughters of God that have the same faith that the prophet had the same revelation of the word. Amen. That same God is here. You just have to be happy and serve God because you are the most privileged people on the face of this earth that God has come to you. When he saved you, millions perish. Some of us in our family, it was only us that the word came to us. And when he save us, most of them perish. Why do you think God came to you? There's something in you. There's a seed, there's attribute of him, something that you don't even know, but God only knows why he came to you out of the billions. So you have to be most happiest person on the face of this earth when the whole world is insane. When people don't know what to do but you have an anchor you have one that you can go to and take put all our burdens on him. But in conclusion, in very in in very short time, I believe that we're going to be going home. Our going home is here. This is now our salvation nearer than we can even think of. So just to conclude that as the prophet said, all things are possible to them that believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what I have for tonight. May God bless you all.
