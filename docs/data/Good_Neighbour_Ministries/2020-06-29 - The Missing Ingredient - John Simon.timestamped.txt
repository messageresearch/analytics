[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] good morning friends it's good to be in
[0:18] the house of God and on another
[0:22] beautiful Sunday morning giving praise
[0:27] honor and worship to his glorious and
[0:32] marvelous name today I would like to
[0:39] speak on the subject the missing
[0:41] ingredient now some years ago I read in
[0:47] a book where this woman made a beautiful
[0:54] cake a lovely cake for her husband mixed
[0:59] it lovingly and prepared it baked it and
[1:03] then brought that cake after hit a
[1:07] cooled to her husband giving him a
[1:12] healthy slice of that cake and so he sat
[1:17] down to enjoy that cake but with his
[1:23] first bite and began to chew it his face
[1:29] changed color and as sensitive as she
[1:34] was she said what's wrong honey what's
[1:37] wrong is something wrong
[1:39] he said well it it's a beautiful cake
[1:42] it's it's just lovely
[1:45] no faulting that that is just great but
[1:49] the taste there there's something
[1:52] missing there's something missing from
[1:55] it it's you know a cake is supposed to
[1:58] have to be sweetened this has no taste
[2:02] whatsoever
[2:03] she said oh my god I forgot to put in
[2:08] sugar oh my
[2:11] and so the sugar was that missing
[2:14] ingredient
[2:17] I would like to speak about that today
[2:20] let us pray and read from the book of
[2:25] Judges our gracious God and Heavenly
[2:31] Father we ask for help from heaven may
[2:36] the great holy spirit empower us to
[2:41] speak your word Lord anoint your word to
[2:46] you to the hearts and minds of the
[2:48] people that you and persons you have
[2:52] prepared to hear and to receive this
[2:56] send forth thy light on thy truth in
[2:59] this hour in the midst of the darkness
[3:03] Lord and lighten and brighten every
[3:07] corner of every heart in the name of
[3:10] Jesus Christ our Lord who may love and
[3:14] serve amen and amen blessed be his holy
[3:20] name now I want to show the importance
[3:28] of having this person of the Blessed
[3:33] Holy Spirit in our lives in our homes
[3:37] and in our churches and also in and
[3:43] across our nation praise be to God
[3:48] hallelujah now we know my friends that
[3:53] the story of Samson is found in the book
[3:58] of Judges chapters 13 to 16 there you'll
[4:04] find the story of Samson now in Samson
[4:10] we see a tape a picture are a
[4:16] representation of Israel a backslidden
[4:21] nation he is also a type for us sad
[4:27] picture of our backs
[4:30] modern church world and also a picture
[4:34] of a backslidden believer that has
[4:39] wandered off from the Word of God Samson
[4:45] was born in or around 1004 DC he was the
[4:53] son of man or a tenant and his wife they
[4:59] hadn't in the visitation and also
[5:04] instruction from the angel of God who
[5:08] had appeared to them and instructed them
[5:12] about Samson's birth his growth and
[5:16] instructions of his eating habits and
[5:20] social habits all about his upbringing
[5:25] he was to be a Nazarite that does that
[5:30] does not mean he has to be born in
[5:33] Nazareth but the Nazarite meaning to be
[5:37] a separated one one separated holy unto
[5:42] God and under God's service now while
[5:47] Samson was young he lived and what
[5:53] obediently by the word of God's angel
[5:57] messenger for his time but as he became
[6:01] older as many people do when they're in
[6:06] the church in the message in the word as
[6:09] they become older in the years go by
[6:13] many began to wonder away from God's
[6:16] Word now here in our text which I will
[6:21] read at this particular time found in
[6:25] the book of Judges chapter 16 a belief
[6:30] it's verse 20
[6:38] verse 18 and when Delilah's saw that he
[6:44] had told her all his heart
[6:46] she sent and called for the Lords of the
[6:49] Philistines saying come up this once for
[6:52] he had showed me all his heart then the
[6:55] Lords of the Philistines came unto her
[6:58] and brought money in their hand she may
[7:03] be and she made him sleep upon her knees
[7:07] and she called for a man and she caused
[7:10] him to shave off this seven lots of his
[7:15] head and she began to afflict him and
[7:18] his strength went from him and she said
[7:22] the Philistines be upon thee Samson and
[7:25] he awoke out of his sleep and said I
[7:29] will go out as at other times before and
[7:35] shake myself and he was not that the
[7:42] Lord was departed from him I'm going to
[7:47] use the last part of that text and he
[7:49] was not that the Lord had departed from
[7:55] him the missing ingredient now in this
[8:02] picture that we read we find Samson in
[8:07] the seductive arms of a harlot of Surak
[8:12] named Delilah whose name is inscribed in
[8:18] history's Hall of Shame
[8:20] she's a type of revelation 17 Mystery
[8:26] Babylon the then the mother of harlots
[8:31] and she also my friends is a description
[8:40] of the daughters of the harlot the
[8:44] harlot herself a symbol of this
[8:49] great pagan Roman ISM and the
[8:54] Protestants the daughters of and
[8:57] products of that Romanism even though
[9:01] they make themselves or call themselves
[9:04] Protestants now my friends four times in
[9:12] the scripture she enticed Samson and
[9:16] diced him to reveal the secret of his
[9:21] strength on three of these occasions she
[9:26] was absolutely unsuccessful but on the
[9:32] fourth occasion she became successful
[9:37] she succeeded and the scripture says
[9:42] chapter 16 verse 18 and she made him
[9:47] sleep upon her knees she loved him to
[9:54] sleep this harlot this organization this
[10:01] Mystery Babylon this denominational
[10:04] spirit learn loved him to sleep
[10:09] maybe sang and low voice lullaby and not
[10:14] to startle him but to have him just fade
[10:19] slowly going off into sleep and while he
[10:26] fell into a deeper and deeper sleep as
[10:29] the Satan has done to the modern church
[10:32] world today though the church to sleep
[10:36] giving her a self a sense of
[10:40] satisfaction a sense of having religious
[10:45] pleasure at God's expense but there she
[10:49] was with his head of all her knees and
[10:52] she loved them to sleep awake
[10:56] let's sleep us and come to the light on
[10:59] Christ will give you life
[11:01] nevertheless the Bible says when he was
[11:04] fast asleep she called for a man called
[11:08] for a preacher confrim man to shave off
[11:13] all of the the seven locks that were
[11:18] upon his head of course we know those
[11:22] seven locks are representative but we
[11:25] will not speak about that at this time
[11:28] those Lots represented his straight they
[11:33] represented the perfect Word of God that
[11:37] God had given to him and that represents
[11:41] the perfect Word of God for our day and
[11:44] our time that has come down to us
[11:47] through seven Church ages and open to us
[11:51] by the opening of the seven seals the
[11:54] fullness of the word of God is made
[11:58] known to his elect to his hidden ones to
[12:02] his chosen ones the word of God has been
[12:07] made known and we feel to them now she
[12:11] felt at that particular time when she
[12:15] had him lulled to sleep and his lots
[12:20] shaven off that him being defenseless
[12:24] now she could make a mock of him now she
[12:29] could attack him now she can pull him
[12:33] and bring him down to shame and she
[12:35] cried out the Philistines me upon this
[12:39] answer and the Bible recourse
[12:43] let I will go out as at other times he
[12:48] woke up briefly and he rose up my god
[12:52] and I said I go out as I did in the past
[12:57] in other words just like how I told that
[13:00] lion just the way and you know I I
[13:04] defeated thousands of these Philistines
[13:07] I will
[13:09] out again as in days of old and there
[13:15] you'll find that these things recorded
[13:17] in judges chapter 14 verse 6 verse 19
[13:24] chapter 15 verse 14 you will find this
[13:29] phrase or similar and the Spirit of the
[13:34] Lord came upon Samson and Samson toward
[13:38] the lion as if it were a kid you've
[13:41] framed it that he picked up a jawbone of
[13:45] an ass and the Spirit of the Lord came
[13:48] upon Samson and he defeated every one of
[13:52] them my friends here in the scriptures
[13:55] three times we are finding this phrase
[13:58] and similar that it was the Spirit of
[14:01] the Lord that came upon Sansa that made
[14:05] him what he was in the eyes of the world
[14:10] at that particular time no doubt being
[14:14] loved to sleep with self-satisfaction
[14:16] and difference to God's work God's will
[14:19] and God's Way as the mother church he
[14:22] began to feel that he doesn't need to
[14:26] wait on the spirit but all he has to do
[14:30] is to shake himself and the world and
[14:33] the Spirit of the Lord will once again
[14:35] come upon him and use him but the Bible
[14:41] makes an arresting statement but he
[14:43] wished not the scripture says but he was
[14:48] not which means but he knew not but he
[14:52] did not recognize he was in other words
[14:56] unaware that the Spirit of God have
[15:00] already took its light the Spirit of God
[15:03] the dove of peace had left him took its
[15:07] flight and gone away from him and he was
[15:11] left to his own devices Sampson unaware
[15:16] of the
[15:18] departure of the holy spirit so what's
[15:23] the nation of Israel unaware of the
[15:27] Parcher of the Holy Spirit for the Bible
[15:31] tells us in those days there no Kings
[15:35] rule there was no king and every man did
[15:39] that which was right in his own sight
[15:42] I believe we're back to that again my
[15:44] friends where people are just doing what
[15:47] they feel what they think or what they
[15:50] like with their own series their own
[15:54] platitudes precepts their own thoughts
[15:57] and uh and just push aside the old
[16:02] family Bible get rid of the scriptures
[16:05] would listen to the Bible except to hear
[16:08] it as glorious literature poetry or
[16:11] great books of architecture zoology
[16:14] science whatever in whatever approach
[16:17] they would like to take to the Bible
[16:20] that's the approach they will take and
[16:22] see it in that light not recognizing it
[16:26] in it the pure infallible word of the
[16:30] Living God
[16:31] that's been given to us his people at
[16:34] this thing unaware think of it now here
[16:38] is stands with one ingredient one
[16:43] important and essential ingredient
[16:47] missing from his life the presence of
[16:51] the person of the Holy Spirit
[16:54] my friends I tell you in the name of
[16:57] Jesus Christ without the Holy Spirit a
[17:01] bother lies his personal presence his
[17:04] leadership his teaching and his control
[17:07] we are lost without him for he is our
[17:11] guide to guide us from earth to glory
[17:15] my friend praise God hallelujah no
[17:18] looking up on Samson Samson looked just
[17:23] the same as he was the day before he
[17:27] came to that harlots tent he
[17:30] have the same muscles the same physique
[17:34] and stature but there was something
[17:37] missing it was the presence of the power
[17:41] and person of the Holy Spirit the action
[17:46] and activity of the Holy Spirit in his
[17:50] life to empower him to anoint him to
[17:54] lead him to guide him and to point in
[17:57] the right way he turned away and the
[18:00] Spirit of God come on the glory is
[18:03] departed
[18:04] the Holy Spirit had left him at that
[18:07] time
[18:08] but despite the absence of the Holy
[18:12] Spirit like many of our churches today
[18:16] oh they're not those miracles we saw
[18:21] what we used to see with Gordon Winston
[18:25] and William Brennan man
[18:27] Velma Gardner and that not be granted on
[18:31] Robertson many of the old-timers Kathryn
[18:35] Kuhlman many others we don't see the
[18:37] power of God Aimee Semple McPherson many
[18:40] many honors John Seely we don't see
[18:43] those things anymore
[18:44] we don't see the leadership and guidance
[18:47] of the Holy Spirit as in Smith
[18:49] Wigglesworth
[18:50] anymore oh my friends but now what it
[18:53] takes is for them in this modern day the
[18:59] modern church takes that you kid it can
[19:02] shake itself it has numbers it has great
[19:06] big machinery of muscles it it has
[19:10] organization it has money so we'll go
[19:13] out this as we did before so my friends
[19:17] the Church of today believes that again
[19:22] in the absence of the presence and power
[19:26] and activity of the Holy Spirit in her
[19:30] lips she believes that she can fight
[19:32] against Satan sin and human suffering
[19:36] and the leads that all she has to do it
[19:39] do is to shake
[19:42] self and say who I'm under that the
[19:44] baptism of the Holy Spirit I'm under the
[19:47] anointing and that's all she has to do
[19:50] and speak in towns and dance the floor
[19:53] and run around them beliefs that she has
[19:56] the victory like that and she can go out
[20:00] as in the days of old of Sousa Street
[20:05] revivals she believes that that's all
[20:08] she has to do but something is missing
[20:11] something is missing me honest be true
[20:17] to yourself
[20:18] recognize the day that we are living in
[20:21] the atmosphere that we are worshiping in
[20:25] and the things that we are doing and we
[20:28] can recognize something is happening
[20:33] something is missing and everyone is
[20:37] competing with the other to shake itself
[20:40] find some new system or some new way to
[20:44] be able to shake itself and believes it
[20:48] can go out and have a local church
[20:51] revival that when there was real Holy
[20:55] Ghost revivals the revival will be miles
[20:59] away
[21:00] people were persons will come in on the
[21:02] train to attend the revival they would
[21:05] get off the river off of the train and
[21:08] many would start falling on the platform
[21:12] many will be Laughing crane repenting
[21:16] getting here turning of God I'm talking
[21:20] none of a church driven up revival I'm
[21:23] talking about a heaven-sent revival and
[21:26] the break the sentence power not just on
[21:30] one life but across the entire nation
[21:33] across the that a town across a city and
[21:37] take that city innocence in his grip and
[21:40] rip it apart
[21:42] Samson did and that the power of God and
[21:45] the reigns of the Holy Spirit fall upon
[21:49] the people and change their lives
[21:51] forever for the glory
[21:53] God hallelujah how wonderful to know
[21:56] that he is the same yesterday today and
[22:01] forever I'm happy to recognize this
[22:05] truth in the word of God in him and so
[22:10] my friends I want to say you can't warm
[22:18] yourself at a painted fire
[22:25] many of our modern-day churches a train
[22:30] to sail their ship their gospel ship on
[22:36] yesterday's wind or breeze it would work
[22:40] my friends there's something missing and
[22:44] it's that genuine true Holy Ghost amen
[22:48] they're praying for it they're asking
[22:50] for it they want to have it and when he
[22:54] comes up on the scene that they refuse
[22:57] the Holy Spirit for this age and for
[23:00] this hour as was thought manifested
[23:04] without a doubt manifested and
[23:08] vindicated 100% by God's messenger and
[23:13] prophet William Aaron Brabham and they
[23:16] rejected the Holy Spirit and the Word of
[23:19] God for the hour that was with him and
[23:22] in him and turned it down and still
[23:27] believes all they have to do is pause
[23:30] and shake themselves looking back to
[23:33] their past
[23:34] looking back back to their fundings and
[23:37] of the tale of their great history and
[23:40] tenth of their great stories of what
[23:43] happened when their organization or
[23:47] denominational the other nations began
[23:49] all my friends it's not what happened
[23:53] back then that's den and this is now and
[23:57] my friends we must realize and ask God
[24:01] for what years
[24:02] do it now lost into the in the past are
[24:05] wonderful we enjoy hearing listening and
[24:09] receiving them but our focus should be
[24:13] even what is God doing now in US and
[24:17] through us for his glory and for his
[24:21] honor
[24:21] no amount of shaking of yourself of
[24:25] dreaming of revivals church sponsored
[24:29] revivals will bring back another
[24:33] Pentecost another move of God that will
[24:38] shake the devil from the front his truck
[24:42] right down to the soles of his feet and
[24:44] cast him out from the house of God out
[24:47] of the temple of the Living God my
[24:50] friends I tell you we fight here today
[24:53] the picture of this modern church like
[24:57] that drunken man that just woke up from
[25:01] his sleep and is trying to shake himself
[25:05] so that he might come to his true senses
[25:08] he is not in a sense as he has some
[25:10] senses but he hasn't come to his full
[25:13] senses and so he's shaking himself trato
[25:17] you know come to his senses my friends
[25:20] that will not work
[25:22] you may need the presence and power of
[25:25] the genuine Holy Spirit not some
[25:28] man-made made-up only spirit the
[25:31] disciples asked for help
[25:33] when their ship was sinking Lord save us
[25:37] with perish but they want the Holy
[25:40] Spirit to come according to their desire
[25:43] and their quantification whatever they
[25:47] believe he should do for them not to
[25:49] tell them anything that will make them
[25:52] uneasy not to be able to really tell
[25:56] them the truth but to tickle their ears
[25:58] and to make them feel wonderful but
[26:01] instead the Bible tells us in the
[26:04] darkness while upon their ship the
[26:07] Spirit of God Jesus came walking
[26:11] water and the answers to their prayer
[26:13] the desired photo for the parable Jesus
[26:18] Christ to deliver them from the storm
[26:20] that was coming against them and when
[26:23] they saw him coming it is oh it's a
[26:26] ghost and the Bible said they were sore
[26:29] afraid of the very thing that could save
[26:33] them I believe that has happened in our
[26:35] age and one day you come to realize that
[26:39] the ministry of wisdom Marian Burnham
[26:43] wants them angel messenger knocked on
[26:47] the door and his wife back there but to
[26:49] the church world here to call out his
[26:52] bride his chosen wants his elected and
[26:56] separated ones to call them to attention
[26:59] of his word one day you'll come back
[27:03] around and realize that he was right he
[27:07] is right and will always be great for
[27:11] what he said was not his words it was
[27:16] thus saith the Lord
[27:18] in other words it was God speaking
[27:21] through that man and saying listen this
[27:23] is not william branham speaking this is
[27:26] the lord speaking through him for the
[27:30] Spirit of God speaks true the prophet of
[27:33] the Living God so here we see Samson's
[27:38] same muscles same machinery same
[27:44] physique modern dead church great
[27:48] organization huge buildings great things
[27:52] trying to shake itself and to live by
[27:56] yesterday's fire I tell you if some of
[28:00] those founders of these various churches
[28:03] and denominations were to come back and
[28:06] to see what was taking place in these
[28:09] groups and churches and organizations
[28:12] that they founded their will they'll
[28:15] scream and cry as we used to attend
[28:18] there there may be
[28:19] in their graves if there's such a thing
[28:22] but my friends not there will not stand
[28:26] for what is happening in the various
[28:28] denominations regardless of its strength
[28:31] regardless of its name regardless of who
[28:34] it is and what it is not even being true
[28:37] to their own faith to their own founders
[28:40] their own funding to their own
[28:42] foundations they have shifted off their
[28:45] foundation and are walking contrary to
[28:48] the Word of God and a servant of the
[28:51] Living God she commanded back to the
[28:53] word back to the Bible after the
[28:56] original faith God is calling his people
[28:59] and his church back to the faith of our
[29:02] fathers living still in spite of all the
[29:06] fire on the sword all of the persecution
[29:09] him had prayed friends Samson behold the
[29:13] Philistines are upon the Church of the
[29:16] Living God wake up worldliness is upon
[29:20] you my role Samson
[29:23] tried to shake himself to get the mini
[29:26] man-made revival by shaking himself but
[29:31] it didn't work he wanted the world and
[29:34] do battle with dog demons
[29:38] thus Philistine spirits lost man at that
[29:42] time but we fight not against flesh and
[29:44] blood but against principalities and
[29:47] powers and spiritual wickedness and the
[29:50] rulers of darkness of this world and
[29:53] that modern date church is going out in
[29:58] equipped missing the presence and power
[30:02] of the great Holy Spirit yes they'll say
[30:06] we have it but the evidence is not their
[30:10] numbers money organization Business
[30:14] Administration marketing public
[30:16] relations that's not what I'm talking
[30:19] about
[30:20] I'm talking about the power of the
[30:22] presence of the Holy Spirit coming down
[30:25] upon
[30:25] village a town a city or a nation and
[30:29] man will have to subject what is this
[30:32] what's going on what does this mean and
[30:35] the Apostle Hester said this is that
[30:39] spoken by the prophet of Malachi 4:5
[30:42] that God promised that he will pour out
[30:45] his spirit bought former and latter rain
[30:48] coming together the teaching rain and
[30:52] the harvest rain combined together
[30:54] forming upon the Church of God and the
[30:57] glory of the latter house all my friends
[31:01] greater than that of the former
[31:03] what a season what a time back to your
[31:06] original faith back to the Word of God
[31:09] listen to the message of this hour go
[31:12] back and read the writing sir hear the
[31:16] tapes of William Frantz him and it will
[31:19] shape you to your roots under your
[31:21] foundation and you will realize and
[31:24] recognize that man was speaking nothing
[31:28] but the truth amen
[31:30] yes sir here we are trained to work to
[31:35] do battle trying to come against the
[31:41] Philistines in his own strength he had
[31:47] the physical night and the machinery
[31:51] main us the missing ingredient of the
[31:56] Spirit of God doesn't this not bring to
[31:59] mind Zechariah chapter 4 verse 6 not by
[32:03] might not by power but by my spirit
[32:07] saith the Lord
[32:09] yes the church today trying to battle
[32:13] against Satan using human knowledge
[32:17] using psychology psychiatry using all
[32:22] the various ologies whether it's tea
[32:25] ology humor Harmon eunuch sir another
[32:30] technology technology in and all these
[32:33] things trying to fight Satan with
[32:38] Trentham but greek interpretations and
[32:40] and and ira make and hebrew and and and
[32:44] debates over these matters and trying to
[32:47] find satan with that you are defeated
[32:49] before you you have you started you
[32:52] cannot fight and defeat satan upon those
[32:55] grounds because satan is a being or
[32:58] spirit that is over six thousand years
[33:02] old in ancient evil wisdom and do you
[33:08] believe that you will compete with him
[33:11] but your puny human wisdom against him
[33:15] you cannot do it but with God's help you
[33:19] can with God's power you can with the
[33:22] Holy Spirit in you you can the genuine
[33:26] Holy Spirit for he has said in my name
[33:29] they are cast out devils and casting out
[33:32] Devils is casting out the unbelief out
[33:35] of the heart of that person first of all
[33:38] before any other thing praise God
[33:41] hallelujah
[33:42] think of it Samson was laid up captive
[33:47] he found himself in a bind and being in
[33:54] a bind
[33:56] he was made blind and be made blind and
[34:02] in a bind the Philistines made him to
[34:07] grind he had a hard life trying to go
[34:10] back to that anointing that power and
[34:14] presence of God that was upon his life
[34:19] and so the Philistines had a great feast
[34:23] a feast of celebration to celebrate
[34:28] their capture of Samson I believe even
[34:32] now with the behavior of a modern church
[34:37] Satan is having a celebration in the
[34:40] pits of hell demons are dancing salomi
[34:44] is dancing the lion is dancing the
[34:47] members of mystery
[34:49] and then I'm having a brick party time
[34:51] all them great performers that did not
[34:54] heed the Word of God and maybe was
[34:57] famous upon the earth where are they now
[34:59] maybe they're dancing but it's where
[35:02] they're dancing they're dancing because
[35:04] it may be too hot furred like a Cat on a
[35:07] Hot Tin Roof
[35:09] they can't stop now because the heat is
[35:12] on oh brother sister he's the voice of
[35:15] God the Word of God for this hour rip
[35:18] come to God if you're backslidden turn
[35:21] back turn back and come to God he'd
[35:24] receive you with open arms he loved you
[35:28] and open up his word and reveal it to
[35:31] you and your strength will return your
[35:34] street will come again your life will be
[35:37] renew your walk will be led by him
[35:41] guided by him and ordered your footsteps
[35:45] will be ordered by the Lord Himself and
[35:49] so they have the great celebration the
[35:53] party was in swing and so here comes
[35:57] Samson let bhaiyya allowed a young boy
[36:02] until a young telogen a page here he was
[36:07] the leader of Samson imagine a great
[36:12] warrior Church a brain anointed Church
[36:15] that defeated every devil and every
[36:18] demon and every power that comes its way
[36:21] and always took it stand upon the old
[36:24] fashioned Word of God now has to be led
[36:28] by some theological dandy on the floor
[36:35] of celebration mockery jesting and
[36:39] called upon to do all kinds of tricks oh
[36:43] just as they did with Jesus when he was
[36:47] on the cross
[36:48] tell us who hit you we know you have the
[36:50] gift of discernment why don't you tell
[36:52] us who hit you know your platform and
[36:55] why don't you tell so hit you but God
[36:57] it's Paris
[36:59] doesn't show off God is not a
[37:03] performance he's not there to show off
[37:06] his power but the shines love for his
[37:09] people to deliver his people Oh to put
[37:13] his arms around his people and for them
[37:16] to know he's real so he they're dopes
[37:20] could be settled as the song said and
[37:22] they can say I know I know this is real
[37:25] no matter what they that the priest told
[37:29] me no matter what the bishop told me no
[37:31] matter what this great authority figure
[37:34] told me I'm known for myself in my heart
[37:38] it's real for it's been revealed to me
[37:41] and I see the presence and the hand of
[37:45] God making himself known to me this
[37:49] great warrior they live like that here
[37:52] we see the picture of a bound and
[37:56] blinded and defeated church of the last
[37:59] day
[38:00] a modern day Church kept you captivated
[38:03] by and focused on religious performances
[38:09] religious entertainment for pleasing the
[38:14] audience and with a motive of filling
[38:19] every seat within the building focus on
[38:24] bringing them back wanting them to come
[38:28] back again to church to receive more not
[38:33] realizing than in the Bible sometimes
[38:38] God allows blessed subtractions because
[38:42] when his perilous presence countless
[38:44] parts displayed many times it's not only
[38:47] in healing but many Liars are sometimes
[38:50] struck down dead many had their sight
[38:54] and will try to blaspheme in the
[38:57] presence of God one dead blind even for
[39:01] a season
[39:02] yes sir and great the Bible tells us in
[39:05] the book of Acts and great fear came
[39:07] upon the people yes sir
[39:10] and many of them never came back why
[39:13] this was real this was not a job this
[39:15] was not a musical entertainment this was
[39:18] not something that made you feel nice
[39:21] you were on day on the edge of your pew
[39:24] my friends I have literally seen nah not
[39:29] just in my preaching but I've seen it in
[39:31] other preachers other places me reminded
[39:35] of God
[39:35] where the devil moving up on the middle
[39:38] cut knots tender peasants of Almighty
[39:41] God and just ran out they could not take
[39:45] the Word of God in the presence on an
[39:48] atmosphere of that blessed Holy Spirit
[39:50] it's real friends it's real the days of
[39:54] miracles are not past the days of Acts
[39:58] is not pass the Holy Spirit now wants to
[40:02] write another book of Acts acting true
[40:05] you acting through anyone that will
[40:08] surrender themselves completely and
[40:11] fully into hand
[40:13] humble ourselves be reverent be faithful
[40:17] and God will bless you will lead you and
[40:19] guide you and bring you to the fullness
[40:22] of what you have read within this Bible
[40:26] many of our churches have lowered
[40:29] themselves - pandering and and preaching
[40:34] a simpering gospel in a party light
[40:38] atmosphere flashing lights of
[40:42] multicolored lights
[40:44] jazzy Christian rock music backed up by
[40:49] this multicolored smoke and mirrors and
[40:53] that all day religious tinsel and
[40:56] religious razzle-dazzle and then turn
[41:01] around and call that the Holy Spirit and
[41:06] when that happens there is hardly any
[41:09] difference between the world and its
[41:14] worthiness and with a church that's
[41:18] trained to display the supernatural
[41:21] Pauline s
[41:23] sanctification of the presence of God in
[41:27] her nest and in the life of those
[41:31] believers and when there is that kind of
[41:35] atmosphere the only difference between a
[41:39] rock band and a rough party in a rut
[41:42] entertainment is that one is singing the
[41:46] word his sons with worldly lyrics and
[41:48] the other one is doing similarly the
[41:52] same thing with religious words
[41:56] religious lyrics religious sounds upon
[42:00] it and that's all it's this guy's on the
[42:05] jazzy stuff all the rock stuff all this
[42:09] guy's under the clothing of Christian
[42:13] lyrics and religious terminology and so
[42:17] proud the same worldly music I'm not
[42:23] saying that you cannot have music in the
[42:26] church that has some life to it that's
[42:28] not what I'm talking about I'm talking
[42:30] about that you know it I don't have to
[42:33] explain it you'll know the difference if
[42:35] you're filled with the Holy Spirit
[42:37] my friends they wanna use religious
[42:41] lyrics to make it acceptable to people
[42:45] and palatable to to those of some of the
[42:49] old-fashioned believers that wants to
[42:52] hold on to God's unchanging hand for
[42:56] God's Word does not change inviting
[42:59] so-called Christians and truthless
[43:04] Christian comedians Christian magicians
[43:10] into the house of God the devil mocking
[43:16] the church through these various kinds
[43:20] of activities performing within these
[43:25] churches improperly dressed men
[43:28] half-dressed women in every part and
[43:33] every aspect of church some church
[43:37] sex sin and seduction a script in to the
[43:43] presence of God in the atmosphere of the
[43:46] Church of the Living God as the
[43:49] scripture has said sin Crouch at your
[43:53] door
[43:53] sin is waiting at your door to pounce
[43:57] upon you o friend what are our what a
[44:01] team that we are living in what's taking
[44:04] place here upon the face of the earth
[44:07] now that unsaved unbelieving bonsaint
[44:13] celebrities are now allowed to step into
[44:17] the puppets the stand behind God's
[44:22] sacred desk all with the motive of
[44:27] enhancing Church profile the church
[44:31] profile in the community for everyone to
[44:35] know that this is a high-class church to
[44:40] which celebrities dignitaries jeweled
[44:44] ladies and and you know marvellous
[44:48] successful powerful money men come to
[44:53] and create that atmosphere and
[44:55] reputation increasing their numbers and
[44:59] with them focus of amassing great
[45:03] fortunes and great wealth the
[45:05] Philistines be upon thee Samson you left
[45:09] your first love remember from whence you
[45:12] are fallen remember your beginnings
[45:15] remember your origins return go back to
[45:19] where you started
[45:20] recapturing Kindle that heat the passion
[45:23] the zeal of your first life back to God
[45:26] back to the Bible back to the original
[45:29] thing your fingers your the old men of
[45:32] God whether it be William Booth or or or
[45:37] this one or that one
[45:39] I call all the names of wasps man godly
[45:42] man anointed by the Holy Spirit would be
[45:45] ashamed if they came back to see what
[45:48] was taking place within these groups
[45:50] that they started some of them never
[45:53] even intended for the groups to become
[45:55] denominations but they turn them into
[45:58] denominations which is to make
[46:01] themselves a defender of the faith to
[46:03] build walls around themselves we've
[46:05] become Christian fortifications and
[46:08] they're holding the fort for jesus is
[46:11] coming we'll hold the fort for I am
[46:13] coming this we called the home before
[46:17] we're called to break down the walls we
[46:20] are called to come to him and know him
[46:22] to know
[46:24] pinta is the no life eternal and to make
[46:28] all men see what is the Fellowship of
[46:31] the mystery when that revelation of the
[46:34] word of God through his tricks you all
[46:37] the Watchmen on the walls of Zion will
[46:40] see eye to eye
[46:41] not by debate and strife not by fending
[46:45] and proving not by debate or an argument
[46:48] tension not my logic didactic or what
[46:52] otherwise but by my friends the union of
[46:56] the holy spirit and harmony of the Holy
[46:59] Ghost in the life of the true believer
[47:02] that walks with him and talks with him
[47:05] every day of their life and no because
[47:11] of this the modern church has left off
[47:15] from the principles of the word of God
[47:18] and Satan has invaded the church where
[47:23] it's now filled with hot stirs and
[47:27] religious conman marketers
[47:32] selling in the temple all manner of
[47:36] religious products and puffin elia being
[47:41] sold in the name of Christ on the cross
[47:44] and going for making men and women to
[47:50] fall more
[47:51] a child of hell I tell you wake up
[47:54] Samson the Philistines be upon you come
[47:57] to yourself recognize who you are come
[48:00] back to the Word of God made a deep call
[48:03] to the deep and may the deep respond
[48:06] here that they con men tricksters and I
[48:11] must say it outright fraud artists
[48:15] playing God's people forgetting and fame
[48:19] at any cost
[48:21] also many false prophets have gone out
[48:25] into Matthew 24 Jesus prophesied these
[48:29] false prophets will be here in the land
[48:33] deceiving and being deceived preaching
[48:37] preaching popularity Fame but not blood
[48:42] not preaching about the blood of Jesus
[48:46] cleanses us from all sin not even
[48:48] preaching about shame they'll talk about
[48:50] bad habits they'll talk about don't do
[48:54] those bad things that was evil things
[48:56] are cultured in such palatable soft
[49:01] acceptable terms not true not with the
[49:05] words of a true son or daughter of God
[49:08] not being irresponsible either but
[49:12] speaking the truth in love that the Word
[49:15] of God may go forth here we find that
[49:19] friends that they want and many of these
[49:22] would even use the word hell they would
[49:26] preach about health oh the preach about
[49:29] health lose my ministry the people will
[49:33] leave the church the offerings will go
[49:35] down headquarters are going to get me
[49:38] out of here I can't use that word that's
[49:42] an old-fashioned word I can only say
[49:45] that you will be sent to a bad place
[49:47] or order leave them say well hell is
[49:52] living a bad life while you're here
[49:53] alert I'll tell you
[49:55] you get your deathbed and feel death
[49:59] rattling and your Trump and there's not
[50:02] time for you saying or doing anything
[50:04] you'll know that you'll be too late then
[50:06] my friend give your life to Christ now
[50:09] while there is yet time to give your
[50:12] life to him and know him in the power of
[50:15] his resurrection
[50:16] these have diluted and perverted and
[50:19] subversive the true fate of the Word of
[50:22] God these beautiful whited warm churches
[50:26] have become infested with demons let you
[50:32] 13:31 the 32 the Bible says God's tree
[50:37] has become a nesting birds revelation
[50:42] the tree in its maturity revelation 18 1
[50:46] 2 4 describe that tree as a habitation
[50:50] Mystery Babylon and on habitation of
[50:54] unclean spirits and fowl Birds and so
[50:58] late Samson the church has become a
[51:01] prisoner of the world and now has to
[51:04] perform a bunch of religious tricks and
[51:09] making religious seals to entertain them
[51:14] and now the churches are trying to outdo
[51:19] each other with that trying to get the
[51:22] attention in the world trying to get the
[51:25] praise of men and praise of the world
[51:28] and anything to get themselves in the
[51:32] newspapers on TV or in the seat of
[51:38] government occupied with an insatiable
[51:43] desire for wanting to be seen and
[51:46] praised of men but the true church was
[51:50] not called to be successful not in the
[51:55] worldly sense but the church was called
[51:58] by God to be faithful be thou faithful
[52:01] unto death and I will give you a crown
[52:04] of life
[52:05] if that feed that not away my friends
[52:08] here we find you say brother Simon you
[52:11] seem to have a dark world view of this
[52:13] modern church yes I do because I read
[52:17] and fully understood and was properly
[52:19] taught about Laodicea and Revelation
[52:24] chapter 3 how she will become a
[52:26] different self-satisfied lukewarm and
[52:30] must don't increase with God God's reach
[52:34] and must now not your wretched naked
[52:38] blind and like Sam some other where and
[52:43] not not not aware of what has really
[52:47] happened and is happening in the Church
[52:50] of the Living God the Bible crazy when
[52:54] the dark comes come to me and by I saw
[52:57] so that your eyes will be opened that
[53:00] you can recognize not just sing the song
[53:04] open the eyes of my heart Lord ins has a
[53:07] nice religious but actually really cry
[53:11] out to God and ask him to open the eyes
[53:14] of your heart not the church not to your
[53:17] church fundamentals not to your church
[53:19] doctrines don't worry
[53:21] binders on your eyes but to the full
[53:24] word of God whatever God wants to reveal
[53:27] to you that you will see it through the
[53:30] eyes of your heart in the fullness of
[53:32] the Holy Spirit and so the mother church
[53:34] has become a stumbling block to many
[53:37] outside like Samson housing all having
[53:40] on the physical muscles powers machinery
[53:42] might numbers money but the genuine Holy
[53:47] Spirit is gone that glory of God has
[53:50] departed he was not by the Spirit of God
[53:54] had departed from from him the church
[53:57] appealing for more and more money
[53:59] instead of more honey
[54:01] when Jacob sons were going into Egypt to
[54:04] meet with their brother Joseph their
[54:07] father gave them some money and they
[54:09] were rushing up the door to start their
[54:12] journey and had to he had
[54:14] tell them no you also need to take some
[54:17] honey and some other spices we need to
[54:21] have the full fruits of the spirit we
[54:25] need to have the virtues of the Holy
[54:27] Spirit and the Word of God in its
[54:30] fullness pouring out and living in the
[54:32] Church of God for this last name all
[54:35] friends attend new friends what must the
[54:38] church do together to this bind the
[54:41] churches in the church needs to repent
[54:44] sincerely repent I know the work repent
[54:48] is used over and over until it's become
[54:50] the devil of literally like normal eyes
[54:53] if it doesn't meet much the people but a
[54:55] genuine repentance not betray eyes but
[54:59] wear those blended eye-sockets but pour
[55:03] down tears of sorrow and repentance and
[55:07] say Lord I'm coming home I'm coming home
[55:10] never more to Rome oh Jesus the entire
[55:15] church and the individuals preachers
[55:18] also come fullness and cast themselves
[55:22] at the feet of the Lord Jesus Christ my
[55:25] friends no matter how dirty it becomes
[55:28] God never leaves himself without a
[55:31] witness
[55:32] he always has a faithful few he always
[55:36] has a little flock he always has his
[55:40] hidden wants they're hidden and yet
[55:44] they're everywhere they're in this
[55:48] message there in the denominations
[55:50] they're eating from Jezebel steagle but
[55:52] yet they're hid from the from the from
[55:55] the world some are still in Mystery
[55:58] Babylon and the organizations and the
[56:01] crying must all come out of her my
[56:04] people and be not partakers of our sins
[56:09] back to the Bible may God bring us back
[56:13] to the old time Holy Spirit the parent
[56:15] God the manifestations of the word of
[56:19] God in our lives and bring that missing
[56:23] ingredient back in the house of God and
[56:26] in the Church of God we need
[56:29] supernatural activity of the Holy Spirit
[56:33] in God's church where liars are struck
[56:36] down where many who are unqualified step
[56:42] up to take the Lord's Supper and are
[56:45] shut down by the presence of God except
[56:48] they examine themselves then great fear
[56:51] will come upon the church that this is
[56:53] not some story to be told this is not
[56:55] fun this is not a joke this is a real
[56:58] living God who lives and moves and
[57:02] reigns now and forevermore
[57:05] we have serve our God bring the church
[57:07] back that when the church praise was
[57:09] present doors open lay men walk praise
[57:13] God and the Word of God began to spread
[57:16] and multiply not dependency and
[57:18] marketing systems and assimilation and
[57:22] psychological systems and the teaching
[57:25] of psychology and that sort of stuff my
[57:27] friends in a book of of Acts where the
[57:30] Holy Ghost fell they didn't need any of
[57:33] those things in one day three thousand
[57:37] came to Christ and over you will read it
[57:39] in various chapters all the talk was God
[57:42] deciding to come on the scene by the
[57:45] cries and the prayers and repentance of
[57:48] his people which are called by his name
[57:50] and to come on the scene and that he is
[57:54] the answer for Jesus is the answer to
[57:57] all our warnings he is the answer to all
[58:00] that needs my friends may God help us in
[58:03] these closing days of time as the old
[58:07] song says it's the all time Holy Spirit
[58:10] and that devil will go near it that's
[58:13] the reason people fear it but it's
[58:16] goodie
[58:16] enough for me oh give me that old-time
[58:19] religion get me of that old-time
[58:22] religion
[58:23] god bless you my friends let us pray Oh
[58:25] gracious help me father we thank you for
[58:28] your word we take you for the great Holy
