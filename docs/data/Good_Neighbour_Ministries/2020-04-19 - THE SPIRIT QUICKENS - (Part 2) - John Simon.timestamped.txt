[0:18] good Sunday morning neighbor I'm pastor
[0:22] John Simon from good neighbor ministries
[0:25] of Burlington Ontario Canada welcome to
[0:31] this broadcast today and also welcome
[0:35] into the presence of God may God richly
[0:38] bless you as we continue with our talk
[0:43] today concerning the Spirit quickens the
[0:48] word part 2 now on last Sunday's
[0:53] broadcast I spoke about the spirit
[0:57] quickening the Word of God specifically
[1:01] the spirit of the word of God quickens
[1:06] they were to the age in which we are
[1:10] living in now in 2nd Corinthians chapter
[1:14] 3 verse 6 it is written in the Word of
[1:16] God not that we are sufficient of
[1:21] ourselves to think anything as of
[1:24] ourselves but our sufficiency is of God
[1:28] who also had made us able ministers of
[1:32] the New Testament not of the letter but
[1:36] of the spirit for the letter killeth but
[1:42] the Spirit gives it life now last week I
[1:50] spoke on this wonderful subject of the
[1:52] Spirit giving life to the word quickly
[1:54] in the word making the word of life and
[1:57] in that we showed how that God's Spirit
[2:01] quickened the word at creation then we
[2:06] showed how the Spirit of God quickened
[2:11] word in the womb of Mary and cause a
[2:15] supernatural birth to take place we
[2:21] further showed how the Spirit of God
[2:24] quicken the body of Jesus Christ that
[2:28] was in the tomb and God quickened him
[2:34] and raised him remember he was the Word
[2:38] made flesh
[2:40] we received the truth from that that
[2:44] God's Spirit it takes God's Spirit to
[2:48] raise up resurrect or to quicken the
[2:52] Word of God this is why Paul used to
[2:55] turn if the same spirit that raised
[2:59] Christ from the dead dwell in you it
[3:03] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[3:07] that spirit the Holy Spirit that dwells
[3:11] in you so the word quicken the word at
[3:18] creation the word quickened in the new
[3:23] creation it quickened the word in the
[3:27] womb of Mary it quicken Jesus the word
[3:32] that was buried in the grave for three
[3:36] days then it raised it up we further
[3:41] made clear that even the burial death
[3:45] burial and resurrection of the Lord
[3:47] Jesus Christ in type are in
[3:52] foreshadowing that his body his church
[3:57] his wife would be buried and we further
[4:03] show how that the spiritual resurrection
[4:06] of the true apostolic church the body of
[4:11] Christ with all of its original
[4:14] teachings its doctrine that body of
[4:18] Christ was buried during the dark ages
[4:24] kill
[4:25] pierced buried burned boiled I am
[4:31] persecuted during the dark ages and
[4:36] placed in the grave oven to meant living
[4:45] under that Roman persecution suffering
[4:48] and finally death she was dead and
[4:54] buried the truth was dead and buried the
[4:58] word became dead it became a litany it
[5:02] became literature it became beautiful
[5:07] poetry in the minds of men
[5:09] it became religious history in the
[5:13] hearts of many men under Satan's
[5:16] seductive teachings and words mr.
[5:21] distractions of God's words subtractions
[5:25] from God's Word just deluded and
[5:28] deceived and seduced the minds of men by
[5:32] his enticing teaching spirits grab the
[5:37] whole of the mind of men took them away
[5:40] from the Word of God and so the true
[5:44] church was buried during these dark ages
[5:48] however I reminded you that in Joel
[5:52] chapter 2 verses 23 to 26 God promised
[5:57] according to his word I will restore
[6:01] saith the Lord God promised that he
[6:05] would restore everything
[6:07] let me Palmer worm the caterpillar and
[6:11] the cankerworm had eaten away from the
[6:15] church all the church was one Church but
[6:20] after the Dark Ages
[6:22] it became broken up divided search into
[6:29] denominational isms and the fellowship
[6:35] the unity the
[6:38] love the brotherly kindness the joy the
[6:42] saints of God shared because they could
[6:46] see eye-to-eye on the troops of the Word
[6:51] of God that was taken away from them by
[6:55] the introduction of all manner of
[6:59] perverted doctrines contrary to the Word
[7:02] of God and so God promised in his word
[7:05] that he would restore his word he would
[7:09] restored his church and so justice in
[7:13] three days Jesus's body was raised up
[7:18] from the grave we find that in three
[7:22] ages of the church the spiritual body
[7:26] his spiritual body was raised up from
[7:31] the tomb of the Dark Ages where Satan
[7:34] tried to kill her and bury her and
[7:38] confine her there but by the power of
[7:42] God the Holy Spirit of the Living God
[7:45] began to raise the church back up out of
[7:51] church history began to raise her up and
[7:54] bring her back to her original position
[7:58] we made clear to you that the first
[8:03] let's say the first indication of this
[8:06] or first sign of this was their life the
[8:10] shoot of God a little leaf just pointing
[8:14] out of the ground which represents
[8:18] Martin Luther a sprout coming out of the
[8:23] ground Martin Luther with his doctrine
[8:26] of justification by faith paved the way
[8:30] for John Wesley and the doctrine of
[8:37] sanctification first Wesley was teaching
[8:41] you're not only to be justified or saved
[8:43] and then live all kinds of life sconce
[8:48] rage of the word of
[8:49] but you must live a justified life and
[8:53] also a sanctified or holy life - - so
[8:59] that you will represent God and your
[9:01] life your walk your talk your will be a
[9:06] testimony for the glory and praise of
[9:09] God but that was not at all
[9:12] the the true church was not yet fully
[9:15] restored under justification
[9:19] nor was it fully restored under
[9:22] sanctification
[9:24] so sanctification teaching the doctrine
[9:29] for doctrine means teaching on
[9:32] sanctification had to give way or make
[9:37] way for the Pentecostal baptism of the
[9:42] Holy Spirit the great 1906 read Bible on
[9:48] a Sousa Street when the Holy Spirit once
[9:53] again visited the Church of the Living
[9:55] God and revealed to us it's not by might
[10:00] nor by power but by my spirit saith the
[10:04] Lord
[10:04] so the spirit of the Living God
[10:08] came back to the church again and began
[10:12] to move with signs and wonders and
[10:15] miracles and out forward himself upon
[10:19] the church with great anointing of the
[10:22] Holy Spirit and in there we find out how
[10:26] God was misunderstood because man had
[10:30] already inserted their various doctrines
[10:35] initial evidences their fundamentals
[10:38] their catechisms their books of claiming
[10:44] this is the book of truths and each one
[10:47] pointing in a different way so God sent
[10:51] a marvelous wonderful messenger and out
[10:56] of this great of pouring came God's
[11:00] messenger
[11:02] the age William Marion brand ham better
[11:06] known in the writings of Gordon Lindsay
[11:11] of the Pentecostal revival wrote this
[11:15] marvelous life story of brother William
[11:19] Marilyn Brennan and entitled hit a man
[11:23] sent from God the 20th century prophet
[11:28] God had promised according to Malachi
[11:31] 4:5 that he would send back the spirit
[11:35] of Elijah the spirit of Elijah to rest
[11:39] upon a man in our day and in our time to
[11:44] restore back the faith that was given to
[11:48] her Apostolic fathers buried during
[11:51] Roman condemnation and destruction and
[11:57] burial and that it would be restored and
[12:01] resurrected back true the message the
[12:05] Ministry and message not by the man but
[12:09] by his message God would use that to
[12:13] bring his elect back to the fullness of
[12:17] the truth and the revelations of the
[12:20] Word of God
[12:22] now this messenger we know with brother
[12:25] William Branham God rest his gallant
[12:29] soul a soldier an anointed man of God
[12:33] one like in his capacity and stature one
[12:40] said to each generation and now he is
[12:45] dead and gone and we are surrounded by a
[12:49] lot of imposters copycats impersonators
[12:54] contrary to God's promise of the hour
[12:58] now as I said before he is dead and gone
[13:02] but his message that he had and declared
[13:08] and is now preparing brothers and
[13:12] sisters preparing the way
[13:15] for the coming of the Lord Himself
[13:20] farming no the scripture tells us Christ
[13:24] means The Anointed One he makes the way
[13:28] his message is making the way just like
[13:31] John the Baptist with the spirit of
[13:33] Elijah his message prepared the way
[13:36] cleared the baggage out of the way for
[13:39] the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[13:42] then he identified the Word of God for
[13:45] that hour so does the ministry of this
[13:49] messenger prophet identify the Word of
[13:53] God for this hour and this thing now
[13:57] identifying Christ Christ means The
[14:01] Anointed One or specifically the
[14:05] anointed Word of God anointed Word the
[14:10] Messiah the Word of God said to us back
[14:15] then that word that was sent came in
[14:17] flesh but now he has returned in Word
[14:21] form and we are to unite or meet that
[14:25] him in this corporal body at what we
[14:29] know in scriptures at the rapture but
[14:32] here he is appearing revealing making
[14:35] himself known in the form of the word
[14:37] and the way is being prepared for his
[14:40] physical coming his corporal coming in
[14:45] his corporal body for right now he is
[14:48] here in the form of the Blessed Holy
[14:51] Spirit God anointing and revealing his
[14:55] own word to his people for those who
[14:58] have two ears to hear let them hear what
[15:00] the Spirit of the Living God is saying
[15:03] to the churches speaking to his elect
[15:07] roof that he lost from the for the
[15:10] foundations of the world but and has
[15:12] come to seek and to save those that were
[15:16] lost many of them from from youth they
[15:20] recognized that they were born different
[15:22] they were born with a
[15:25] nature in them sure they have done every
[15:29] crooked thing every evil thing every
[15:31] wicked thing every sinful thing but yet
[15:35] in the deep of their heart they're
[15:37] recognized there's a voice calling
[15:39] there's something speaking to them and
[15:42] that same God promised that he would
[15:45] redeem he would call back his children
[15:49] back to himself that they will know him
[15:52] in the power of his resurrection and I
[15:56] want to thank God today that under God
[15:59] be the glory that the seven seals of the
[16:02] book of Revelation have been opened unto
[16:06] us and out of the opening of those seven
[16:10] seals
[16:10] we find all of it came for quickening
[16:14] power to quittin a day that God's
[16:18] spiritual body his church his elected
[16:23] church his wife
[16:25] to quicken her by the opening of the
[16:29] word the seven seals open out of it this
[16:32] quickening power was released upon the
[16:35] Church of the Living God the seven
[16:38] thunders came for the voice of God the
[16:41] mighty angel came forth and the true
[16:44] election of God could recognize it for
[16:47] this day for we cannot live us off of
[16:51] yesterday's manner we cannot live off of
[16:55] Luther's teaching we cannot live off of
[16:59] Wesley's teaching we cannot live off of
[17:03] all dead Pentecostal manna we must live
[17:07] from the fresh word of bread from heaven
[17:10] sent from God true God sent God anointed
[17:15] and God vindicated prophet and because
[17:19] we know that the word he preached that
[17:22] many have misunderstood it was not his
[17:25] word but it was thus saith the Lord long
[17:29] after that is gone yet God's Spirit is
[17:34] vindicating that message vindicating
[17:37] that
[17:38] were bringing it to pass unfolding it
[17:41] revealing it manifested and manifesting
[17:45] it in Revelation in understanding and
[17:48] wisdom and in healing miraculous power
[17:53] and the raising of the Dead mighty works
[17:56] of God being done through the Ministry
[17:59] of the entire bride of Jesus Christ for
[18:03] he has returned to inhabit and to
[18:05] possess and to claim his entire body and
[18:10] to take it with him back in the rapture
[18:14] for his glory amen
[18:16] praise God so we understand then friends
[18:20] that he the spirit out of the seven
[18:24] seals that were open came out to quicken
[18:31] their word for the hour to resurrect and
[18:37] restore that word that was lost not your
[18:44] only during the dark ages but God had
[18:47] lost his word beyond the foundations of
[18:52] the world which let me let me take that
[18:54] time I'm going to get to that but God's
[18:57] Word had to be restored back to us the
[19:03] word that was predestinated for this
[19:07] hour that part of the world and all of
[19:11] the world that was predestinated for
[19:14] this hour God promised to resurrect
[19:17] revive and restore this word back to us
[19:21] and when I say this word I'm speaking
[19:24] about the written word and I'm also
[19:28] speaking about the Living Word the
[19:31] Living Word and when I say the living
[19:34] word I'm not talking about Jesus that
[19:37] was back there 1900 or 2000 years ago
[19:41] and though
[19:43] was the word made flesh and then was
[19:46] crucified dead and buried but I'm take
[19:50] talking to you about when he died and he
[19:54] gave up the ghost and the Holy Spirit
[19:58] went back to heaven came back down came
[20:04] back down that he might be the spirit of
[20:07] truth that he might be our do the Miss
[20:10] are the power to give us power to be
[20:14] witnesses to fill us to anoint us and to
[20:20] dwell in us to be his people and he to
[20:24] be our God to live within his people to
[20:28] have his own house for Solomon could not
[20:30] build him a house but he has built and
[20:33] is building his own house building his
[20:37] house to live in his people for his
[20:41] people are the house of God knowing not
[20:45] you are the temple you are the temple
[20:48] your body is the temple of the Living
[20:51] God and God lives within your heart by
[20:54] faith if you are his elect and you
[20:56] believe his word you receive them within
[20:59] your heart amen
[21:01] so the word is being made flesh again
[21:05] not just in Jesus for that was already
[21:10] prophesied by Isaiah and many of the
[21:13] other prophets that the word would be
[21:17] made flesh and that word became flesh in
[21:22] one man named Jesus Christ and God the
[21:28] Jehovah of the Old Testament dwelt in
[21:33] him but he had an earthly name that was
[21:37] called Jesus but the Jehovah of the Old
[21:41] Testament is the same Jesus of the new
[21:44] for he said it is that I speak but the
[21:48] father that dwelleth in me he doeth
[21:50] these words God and Christ her one he
[21:54] said I am my father
[21:56] God created that body in the womb of
[21:59] Mary for himself came down and dwelt in
[22:02] that body and God in that physical body
[22:06] could not be killed they tried to
[22:09] crucify it at Calvary but he left that
[22:12] body came back down and now to dwell in
[22:16] the body of his believers or his
[22:20] believing elected church elected for
[22:24] this hour in other words when I say
[22:26] elect I mean that God predestinated you
[22:31] to this out that when he comes in this
[22:34] age he was fine vessels prepared and
[22:38] waiting for him to end well and use for
[22:43] his glory to manifest his presence to
[22:46] declare his word and to fulfill their
[22:49] purpose and mission him on the earth and
[22:52] to declare the name of the glorious
[22:54] heavenly Father amen and amen
[22:58] Oh may God bless you unbelieving god
[23:01] that while I'm speaking somewhere
[23:03] someone will recognize their position
[23:07] not in the church but in Christ that
[23:10] they will recognize their position of
[23:12] who they really are and why God placed
[23:15] them here upon the face of the earth now
[23:18] we know that Jesus Christ was the head
[23:21] he was the word amen and he was the head
[23:26] of the body and that head of the body
[23:31] was raised up the entire body was
[23:34] crucified Devon berry but he died
[23:37] headship amen represented there as the
[23:41] head of the church head of the body was
[23:44] raised up now we are in the midst of
[23:49] another resurrection but it's not the
[23:52] resurrection of the body of Jesus Christ
[23:55] back there it's now another resurrection
[23:59] of the spiritual body of Jesus Christ
[24:03] those who are elected to make up that
[24:06] spiritual body
[24:08] those who
[24:09] he he elected of course he's calling and
[24:13] placing them positionally before they're
[24:18] caught up and caught away in the what we
[24:21] know scripturally as the rapture rapture
[24:24] process now we know the very word
[24:28] raptures not really found written in the
[24:31] scriptures but it says cata they shall
[24:34] be caught up they'll be caught away
[24:37] sudden secretly they'll be caught away
[24:40] by the grace of God but we are in the
[24:43] midst and in the middle of another great
[24:47] resurrection and that resurrection has
[24:51] already started we are raised up from
[24:54] the darkness of the grave grave of what
[24:59] you were spiritually dead but you have
[25:02] hid quicken he has quickened you or
[25:06] raised you up to live above sin and to
[25:09] walk in a resurrected life or in a new
[25:13] life raised up above all the filth all
[25:16] the darkness all the doctrine all the
[25:19] confusion and the chaos of the age and
[25:22] the world and time and season that we
[25:25] are living in raises you up above every
[25:28] every blockage that will be placed in
[25:31] front of you that you might recognize
[25:33] him who to know his life eternal
[25:37] now that resurrection has already
[25:40] started and that resurrection leads
[25:43] right into the rapture so let me repeat
[25:48] Jesus Christ the head has already had
[25:52] his resurrection now this is the body
[25:56] time this is the right time this is the
[26:01] Lambs wife time train for his spiritual
[26:06] body to be made manifest it's
[26:09] manifesting time time for the glorious
[26:13] man
[26:13] a ssin of the sons and daughters of God
[26:17] that were a hidden in all these various
[26:20] denominations which the Bible types and
[26:24] calls in symbolic form about Mystery
[26:28] Babylon the mother of harlots and says
[26:32] in the book of Revelation come out from
[26:35] her my people be not partakers of our
[26:38] plagues God wants you to come out from
[26:42] these denominational strongholds of
[26:46] spiritual darkness and come to the light
[26:49] and Christ will give you life now when
[26:53] he died spiritually we died spiritually
[26:56] we were identified with him and in him
[27:00] for we were in him and together we made
[27:04] up the fullness of the word for in the
[27:08] beginning John chapter 1 verse 1 was the
[27:10] word and the Word was with God and the
[27:15] Word was God
[27:17] now Jesus Christ Himself is the sum
[27:21] total of all of the word what the rest
[27:25] of the word was in him and so we were in
[27:30] him just as a man's life giving stream
[27:34] is in him
[27:36] God's germ of life was in him God's gene
[27:41] was in him God's attributes were in him
[27:46] and we see when he raised up that was
[27:50] his spiritual headship went to glory
[27:53] amen when he raised we raised
[27:57] spiritually so the head of the body went
[28:00] back into glory sent back the Holy
[28:03] Spirit to come back here and to quicken
[28:06] his spiritual body his life body amen
[28:11] that's the reason why he says in Luke 17
[28:16] 1331 that
[28:18] it was in the days of luck when in other
[28:21] words when you see the same conditions
[28:24] settlement conditions conditions of sin
[28:27] of darkness perilous times come upon you
[28:31] truth an era in disarray the entire
[28:35] thing era sits on the throne and the
[28:38] truth says by the wayside of begging for
[28:42] people to believe then in that day as it
[28:45] was in the days of lot so shall it be in
[28:49] the day of the when the son of man shall
[28:52] be revealed let me put this word here
[28:57] revealed again for he was the son of man
[29:00] when he came the first time and now he
[29:03] becomes the son of man the word made
[29:06] flesh back there now the same word of
[29:11] God wants to come to a flesh live in us
[29:14] what in US and he is given the word but
[29:18] not in the form of one man in the
[29:21] headship but the body Ministry of Jesus
[29:25] Christ living walking talking
[29:28] ministering moving men fasting even
[29:32] truth his people for his glory and
[29:35] honoring their word honoring their life
[29:39] letting them be written epistles to be
[29:42] read of all men thanks be to our
[29:46] gracious Heavenly Father and so now we
[29:50] see he's quitting his spiritual body the
[29:54] true church calling out to his lost
[29:58] wife his rib to come right back and to
[30:02] take her stand by his side to return to
[30:06] her original position where she was
[30:10] standing in the word in the days of the
[30:13] Apostles and the stone stand firm and be
[30:18] able to say a mighty fortress is our God
[30:21] a bulwark never failing
[30:24] our helper here mr. flood amen amen amen
[30:29] we thank God for his never failing word
[30:32] for heavens alert we'll pass
