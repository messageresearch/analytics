[Music] yes this is [Music] oh the bride through my hair [Music] oh god may not help the people to understand why god sent this prophet and he crossed the land back and forth to bring us god's word we are so thankful for this may the lord bless us all together as we gather in his name for his glory and honor we do have a baby dedication [Music] i also am going to pray for brother uh coffee and sister mary as they set off on their trip back to ghana in africa where this is your mom has passed away so he's going to that funeral and they are going to that funeral in our hearts go with them praise the lord and we'd like to pray for their safe journey their preservation while they're there and safe return back to us because his work is not done you still got a lot of work to do brother a lot of miles on those tires praise god hallelujah may the lord bless him real good praise the lord we have a baby dedication here this morning i'd like to do that before bringing the word of god amen praise the lord so let's say bring them in you know that one sister praise the lord a beautiful singing from the group there too i heard that in there and it just lifted my spirit and the first song you started out with was a blessing he leaded me praise the lord thank god [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] amen praise the lord we have a beautiful certificate here which you can frame of course [Music] and we thank the lord for this amen first of all you must understand just to bring the child into the world is a marvelous and wonderful a responsibility you have a part to play we don't just have them come into the world and then they are left to their own devices the real part of this experience of dedication here today is for you as parents to accept the fact that you are instruments for god's use in the raising of this child for his glory and you may have to deny the child sometimes some of its own whims and fancies that it likes right but you want to not surrender to the child's will but to god's will too many parents are surrendering to the children's will instead of to god's will like that so god has you here as the trainer of this uh child there is no escape from that that you are to raise this child in the fear of god uh and in the knowledge of jesus christ and i trust god that you voluntarily accept this position and that you voluntarily accept this responsibility amen for proverbs 22 6 says train up a child in the way that he should go that when he is old he will not depart from it amen and that is uh presuming that the parents already know the way that the child should go before they can train up the child to go in that way so i'm trusting god that since you know the way that you will train the child to go in the way of jesus christ who is the way the truth and the life amen praise god may god grant you wisdom also and grant you the knowledge that you will be able to carry out this responsibility for his glory and honor of course this is not a part-time job parental responsibility is a full-time job 24 7. and even as parents you can't actually watch that child for every minute every moment i in the moment your head turn something can take place but you have got to trust god that above you he is watching he is taking care of things and watching over everything that happens here on the face of the earth amen so let us ask god through divine revelation that he will reveal and make known the purpose of this child's life here so that he can use the child as an instrument for his glory listen to the scriptures he will show you things to come he the holy spirit will glorify me he for he shall receive of mine and show them unto you all things that the father had our mind therefore said i that he should take of mine and show it unto thee amen may the lord bless the child because god knows the future of the child like he said to jeremiah before the child was even born before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee before thou comest fought from the womb i sanctified thee and i ordained thee a prophet unto the nations jeremiah 1 5. so god it please god galatians 1 15 who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace so god calls individuals it doesn't wait god knows what's in the individual before they can walk talk do anything and then he positionally places them so let's pray that god will use you as an assistant to shape the form [Music] the character and being of the child that it might serve the lord and his divine purpose for his glory amen remember you're doing this not to please grandmother not to please auntie but to please god amen praise the name of the lord i'm wearing the mask right now because the child is yet young praise the lord and here we are to dedicate jamani matumbo i hope my pronunciation is correct amen we thank god for shading and of course bill we know and we pray god will bless them both bless the child and anoint them with the presence of god and the holy spirit and to lead them into a wonderful glorious shining future walking in the light as he is in the light having fellowship one with the other and the blood of christ amen washing us from our own sins and presenting us faultless before his throne with exceeding grace and glory praise the lord let me give this to the grandmother and then i'll pray for the child prayer of dedication amen it's a pleasure to meet you god bless you pleasure to meet you again praise the lord god bless you young man it's a pleasure meeting you who is this man he must be thinking anyway let us pray gracious heavenly father in the name of jesus christ i lay my hands upon this boy and i dedicate him for your youth for your honor for your glory i commit him into your hands and then i commit him into the parents hands and may you take care of him as you said in the leadership book you watch over them you give them to the parents and after a while they start to grow you place them in the church somewhere or in the hands of a human leadership of a pastor and then you take over again in the form of the holy spirit so on your behalf and as your representative i now dedicate to manny for your glory and honor i dedicate him now father for your use and for your glory may the blessing of almighty god rest upon him and may it be said as it was said to the prophet your future is clear take away every obstacle everything bless the parents that you may be able to provide protect lead guide draw them close to you right to your side father that you might take the leadership and be glorified now and forevermore in jesus christ's name amen may god bless him may god bless you young man real pleasure okay god bless you both keep pressing on god bless you grandmother god bless you [Applause] move that to your all [Music] does that sound better that sounds better good okay praise the lord we just had to make some adjustments for the sound engineers in the back there they just got a promotion too right praise the lord so we thank god for them and for his glory well thank god you know everyone knows that today is what it's thanksgiving day isn't it and um i noticed that a lot of people are are traveling right a lot of people are traveling this time of year and the planes are full the trains are fully ships are fallen i praised god a wood to god that the churches were full too but anyway um travel is going on all around the country and all around because it's thanksgiving time again and everyone is traveling at thanksgiving time because they're trying to get home and uh they'll do whatever it takes to be able to get home so they can be with loved ones that that's the impulse to be with loved ones and with friends and with family that they love so dear and that's what i want to talk about i want to talk about this great homecoming time that we as saints and people of god are in the midst now not of just thanksgiving out there and just not just of the natural or normal homecoming but we have a homecoming day and it's in the scriptures in god's word and we have been drawn close to the presence of almighty god oh thank god for his spirit here this morning we give him glory amen hallelujah oh my let's read our scripture psalms 47 verses 1-7 psalm 47 shall we all stand amen oh clap your hands all you people praise god hallelujah shout oh my god clapping and shouting today in the churches seems to be old-fashioned and out of date but this is the scripture this is the original primitive christianity this is the way they worship up in heaven this is the way they give god glory clap your hands all you people shout on to the lord with the voice of culture and dignity oh no with the voice of triumph you go to a ball game when your team's hits over the fence amen and you try your hat you don't care where it fall you shouting because why your team won and in this case we look into the word and we see jesus christ has already won he's the mighty conqueror lion of the tribe of judah o praise god forevermore glory to god for the lord most high is terrible he is a great king over all the earth he shall subdue the people under us and the nations under our feet he shall choose our inheritance for us the excellency of jacob whom he loved selah and this is my text god is gone up with a shout the lord with the sound of a trumpet amen sing praises unto god sing praises say praises unto our king sing praises for god is the king of all the earth so sing you praises with understanding praise god father we thank you for the reading of thy word be no faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word the revealing of the word may the great holy spirit of almighty god come and bless anoint open up every heart every gate father and may you be glorified in jesus name amen praise the lord god bless you hallelujah praise his marvelous and wonderful name amen praise god hallelujah amen god is gone up with a shout out if you'll notice in this little text we read says god is gonna put a shout amen and the sound of a trumpet it doesn't mention the voice because he was he he was re he was the voice he was on the scene already so he doesn't need to mention the voice yes the god has gone up he's raptured up he's gone up with a shout with the sound of a trumpet amen glory to god hallelujah amen now listen to uh brother branham speaking here one rapturous past another is on the way amen praise god hallelujah listen i want you to absolutely get it out from him and he's speaking from the rapture book just let me get myself organized here praise the lord properly he's speaking from the church age book paragraph 169 amen one rapture is passed three you see it's happened in the old testament of them who the word of god came to the word of god amen see had come to enoch the word of god came to elijah the word of the lord was jesus amen all three of them went up in what rapture praise god watch in the old testament them old testament saints when this rapture first taken place notice his loud voice is what which woke up them saints back there see the same loud voice that wakened lazarus was now sounding glory to god hallelujah the second rapture will be the one of thessalonians 4 which will be the rapture of the bride but this one is of the old testament saints praise god i'm going to pause right here and go over and show you uh where he spoke about that in the word of god now jesus when he had cried with a loud voice matthew 27 45 hallelujah a loud voice the prophet says notice he cried with a loud voice when jesus was dying he literally screamed with a loud voice and yielded up the ghost and behold the veil of the temple was rent in plain from top to bottom and the earth did quick and the rocks did rent and their graves were opened and the bodies of the saints that slipped that's during the patriarchal and prophetic dispensations all those believing saints that had died during that time when he cried with a loud voice his voice woke up the dead that had died believing unto his coming now that's why we say the cross because the cross is at the crossing of time and there they were looking for to his coming we are looking back towards what he has already done praise god and so they were looking for his coming and his loud voice awakened them out of the graves hallelujah the bible tells us in peter how that he went down into hell preach to the spirits that were imprisoned and you know i've spoken on that the prison where you know there are prisoners of satan and there's prisoners of god like paul so prisoners right you just don't use the word generally we are prisoners to christ the word and they those prophets and those patriarchs were prisoners to christ the word the messiah word amen hallelujah and so he took those who were held there by satan and you know brother branham dramatized it how he just grabbed the keys from satan's belt and pulled it off and said give me those keys stand back now amen and when they looked they saw the lord hallelujah is it work that's the stone that i saw that came out of the mountain the next one said that's the wheel that was in the middle of the wheel the next one said that's the man i met in the fiery furnace lord of god when i was going through my troubles my trials that's the man that i met hallelujah oh praise god and he brought them out with a mighty hand the bible said that he led captivity captive and he gave gifts unto men and he took them into glory praise god now psalms 24. if you will turn you will find him taking them back into glory in psalms 24 and you will read that scripture for yourself right there praise god the art is the lord's and the fullness thereof verse 7 lift up your heads are you gates be lifted up you everlasting doors it's only a period of time you got to believe the doors are only everlasting because you're only going to believe for time and when time is over you don't have to believe anymore because you're in it right because it changed from faith to reality amen it changed the reality from from shadow to substance you're in the thing amen lord of god hallelujah now lift up your everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the lord strong and mighty mighty the lord mighty in battle lift up your heads all you gates and lift them up you everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the lord of hosts he is the king of glory amen and amen praise god hallelujah let me see if i can find where brother branham is talking about that here amen about the king of glory coming in and being with us he said of course that was the lord himself and he led those saints when they rose up there and he took them back to glory and brother branham said as he was coming with the hosts of all these believers and the angels look from the battlement of heaven and they see these hosts of believers coming following him and his voice going out to open up the gates oh my and they stood there say who is this lord of glory who is this lord that we should open the gates and he said the voice answered back the lord of hosts god the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace the one true god hallelujah your savior your redeemer your coming king your baptizer jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever the lord of hosts lion of the tribe of judah most of all the mighty conqueror open up your hearts open your hearts open your everlasting doors open let the king of glory come in amen that's now but then the king of glory goes back into heaven taking the prophets and patriarchs and believing saints with him hallelujah praise god i don't know how i didn't see it because it's the page that's right in front of me when he says here david said lift up your everlasting gates be who lifted up he let the activity and gave gifts to man and they said who is this king of glory king of righteousness the lord of glory mighty in battle jesus he's the one who went into those new gates and said lift up your gates amen hallelujah that the word of god may come in lord of god i pray the word of god will come into your hearts today i pray that the power and the presence oh hallelujah not of my preaching or how i sound don't bother about me but there's an invisible power in this building there's a presence of god unseen to all the unveiling of the mighty god the spirit of power the resurrection of christ amen by the unveiling of the word may he enter your hearts may he enter your soul today amen hallelujah and the voice cried out who is the king of glory the lord mighty in battle he said in an instance them gates flew right open and jesus the mighty conqueror led them in them that had believed on him the word had come to them amen praise god look let's not touch on that because the word only comes to the predestinated vessel of the hour and of that age and of that day the word of god comes to them like it did to mary it had could go to no other virgin it could only go to mary because when his word was spoken god already saw her in his mind when god spoke of a bride in this age he saw you already in his mind oh praise god so when the word goes forth the word can only go to you that's why you could have two in a bed one technique on the other left so you can have a thousand a church and the word goes to one and ten more sitting beside that one they're hearing the voice but they're not catching the revelation of what's being said because the word was predestinated to go to that individual is that right that has an ear that has a crystal to pick up the word and hear the sound the unseen sounds the prophet said radio waves are passing through here but you've got to have something to be able to pick up the waves so you can hear the voice word of god and the same way god had to place a seed within your soul lord of god so that when the word goes forth you just don't pick up my voice you don't just pick up because i'm quoting quotes but the spirit of god in you picks up the revelation of the word the unwritten word that goes between husband and wife that the husband don't even have to speak sometimes just one look one look and she's able to pick up that word right away it's the same way we pick up the word from the lord jesus christ oh hallelujah you say brother simon don't get excited i can't help it i got to get excited oh my god brother sister we are right now at the door ready to break in and to walk right from one dimension to the other hallelujah listen to those of us who rarely have caught the revelation of this last prophet's message like he said when he said listen i've just finished preaching but i noticed the sound went into a higher octave i want to tell you that's what i'm starting to see and hear in those men and women that have really caught the revelation of this message that thing has lifted off now there's fire beneath the rocket ship now we left off time this is not come down anymore we're in the midst of the pillar of fire we're being caught up in the presence of almighty god hallelujah amen brother we're in a higher dimension seated in heavenly places in jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen yes sir you see them old testament saints were laying there and waiting and he took them old testament saints and went in with them and there is what that there is where one rapture is already passed another is on the way first thessalonians ii thessalonians he says but this next rapture is now the one for the bride to be resurrected and raptured with him into glory in other words he is going to lead the host of us like he led the host of them back to the gates of the pearly gates of glory he is going to lead his bride back into glory just like he let them amen he's gonna take you back praise god remember we which are alive and remain that's the bodies of them that are still alive and left on the earth we will not prevent or hinder them which are asleep which means them in our day through the church ages now remember through the prophetic and patriarchal ages he collected all them saints in the first rapture and he took them out but now it's a collection of all the sleeping bride that prince charming is now going to kiss her with seven thunders in her soul and raise her up with a loud voice praise god hallelujah wake her up back to the word of god and the revelation of the holy spirit oh my where is this coming from brother i'm preaching from the storehouse oh praise god i'm preaching from out of the storehouse something touched my soul and i recognize or touch the hem of his comment oh glory to god amen wow what is it them which are asleep what they slept through the seven church ages all of them who died on the looter wesley even way back they died and they were just waiting even paul all of them they have to wait because they without us are not perfect they can't go in without us for the trumpet of god shall sound first and the dead in christ shall rise and we which alive and remain shall be caught up together with with the lord this is the day that we all ought to be happy why he says we should be also ready for that is our great homecoming time and it is now at hand glory god that's why i'm speaking on homecoming day amen we are going home brother sister this world is not our home we're just a passing through our treasures all led up in the land beyond the blue oh praise god we are called we get the call to come home very cross oh my praise god this is our homecoming time and we give glory and praise to god hallelujah remember locke lot was there on the earth and notice this is out of the message called divine healing he says i want you to notice amen how that uh the message to lot was a message of deliverance and before one speck of fire could fall in sodom that angel had to get lot out of there before one drop of rain fell from heaven nor had to get out of there and get in the ark before one autumn bomb strikes this nation in the name of the lord the church of god the bride of christ will be gone in the rapture to meet the lord jesus christ amen shall be gone to meet the lord let them have their sputniks and their missiles shut and the hammers are pulled back but thank god angels are waiting in their order hallelujah the corridors of heaven are full the harps are being tuned up glory to god your heart strengthened to the word is your heart strings tuned to this word so that the slightest sound of the word your heart your heart starts moving right away oh glory to god hallelujah amen their great bands are already practiced up hallelujah there's a homecoming time going on pretty soon the church of the living god that has been waiting for his coming is ready to go for everything is in order and i'm so glad but i'm getting tired i'm getting tired or if i could be there for that great hour oh my he couldn't be here but the great hour is upon us homecoming day is upon us homecoming time is upon us and we're ready to go home anytime he calls we will answer to the call glory be to god hallelujah amen one rapturous past and another is on the way glory to god and to think of all of this that we had a part in this particular junction in time brother branham speaking here that's not me he's saying to think of it god included you included me he bring us all in and give you a part in this junction of time all my when time blends back into eternity and we are brought into the presence of almighty god by the instrumentality of the revealing of the word of god which brings perfect faith within your soul amen oh my praise god hallelujah you see lot got into trouble amen and here we are now at this junction of time amen the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed again hallelujah but lot got into trouble and lot always wherever he is i know what he's thinking doesn't matter which age that spirit of lot is in whoever that lot spirit fall on it always get those individuals in trouble and then he said they backslide oh i wish i had time to dwell on that but i can't get into that you see he left that amen but now here we are preaching on it now we're talking about it here now praise god but what happened amen see the enemy had come and packed him off carried him away amen we can say away from the word carry him away right but abraham amen played the part of a savior again and i think that's the part we as abraham see we got to play that part right now we got to play the part of a savior amen hallelujah don't go by your senses oh they look lost oh they look like they're going to hell they look like they're not going to make it that's not my business i don't care how they look i don't care what they do i don't care how they behave my business is to behave as a savior just like jesus i want to be like jesus then you got to be a savior you got to be a redeemer you got to be one who forgives sins and whose sins you forgive they forgive them take my place hallelujah you gotta take his place amen and work for the glory of god hallelujah amen we'll work till jesus comes we'll work hallelujah and then will be gathered home think of it abraham played the part of a savior got his troops his his people together went after the enemy that had taken away his poor backslidden and corrupted brother oh my that's what jesus did when sin bound you when sickness bound you when poverty bound you when you backslid when you got corrupted jesus came in and went after you and brought you back like abraham brought lock back amen praise god watch my friends and when he came back they had a great jubilee amen a home coming time for jubilee is a homegoing time amen praise god i believe we're in another jubilee right now it's homegoing time amen lord of god praise god seven years of servitude book of leviticus book of ex exodus also numbers you run you'll find it in there seven years of servitude when the when those jews were serving a master for seven years type of the seven church ages hallelujah we couldn't help it we trapped in this world with demonic forces all around us satan everywhere caught in the satan's eden and here we are serve for seven church ages but when them seven church age is over oh hallelujah you got the right to go free amen oh praise god hallelujah and he said it in the statue of a perfect man and many other places he says the seven church ages are over they're finished hallelujah them seven stars that were used only to reflect the light hallelujah of the sun they've got the decrease so that the sunlight can increase and the sunlight is here amen jesus christ s o n revealing himself by the opening of the word oh my praise god hallelujah think about it this is not me opening the word this is not you opening the seals the the lamb broke the seals the brother bragging was just the voice for the lamb to use for the mighty angel of revelation 1 came into revelation 10 1 came into revelation 10 7 to reveal luke 17 30 oh glory of god blessed be the name of the lord it was the living god hiding behind the flesh of a man and use him to unveil the word for us lord of god hallelujah but then the time had to cease his time had to be over as the seventh church age messenger hallelujah you remember i tell you how as a boy uh as young boys you take the note and you send the note to the young lady in the class that you might favor or you might like and maybe you should take the note the first time and just crumple it through it on the ground don't even bother with you and then don't keep coming you're sending a friend to take it because you don't want to feel a shame and so finally she takes the note and she take another note and another note then you feel comfortable now you can approach her and talk to her praise god well that's what happened he sent the patriots the prophets and then brother branham coming and telling you what he said telling you what he said delivering a faithful message of what he said but he has come himself now to talk to the bride himself for god is his own interpreter he will make it plain he said you must needs to be with the author himself so that the book can reveal lord of god so here we come here he comes amen praise god oh the cycle is so beautiful you go from seed and it come down it go it starts from the bottom from the seed and it goes through its whole process amen it could have drawn when the lord gave me this thing i could have drawn a wheat seed beside it and show you how it goes through the same stages and then it goes back to what back to the original seed that's how it's got to go back it can't stop halfway or part way or when it's closed it's got to go right back to the original seed and the original seed is who jesus christ and now it goes back to the original seed and who is he jesus christ amen praise god hallelujah not friends of the bridegroom but the bridegroom himself is that right so praise god hallelujah he said what are you talking about i'm talking about this great jubilee time because israel that was under seven years of servitude they got to you can now go back to your own land your own portion your own country your own people amen and we are now going back to our own land oh beulah land street muleland on the mountaintop i stand amen lord of god oh when i look over praise god and i think of all those who have gone before us amen think of all them saints we know faithful men and women praise god maybe they don't have a fullness of what we are getting every day of what the lord is giving us but they were faithful to what they knew that portion of the world they were faithful to that even so the the prophets didn't know what we got now but they were faithful to that portion they had back there and god comes that as righteousness hallelujah like in our day praise god we don't look down on anybody because they have a lesser understanding oh my listen where the brother says clear god will ripen i feel all right in the same day the whole field won't suddenly go gold no you see different ones that's why you come to this church some people are critical they don't understand you come to this church there's people in different levels of of of understanding and of revelation and of growth and of maturity and somehow ripe some ripe some you know some still green and sour and different parts of the character properly formed oh my praise god and and so you've got to understand that it's the same thing he said they will know when it is time for them to know years ago i told you when the holy spirit spoke to me one early morning and said do not fornicate the word of course i don't understand what does that mean you may fornicate the word in other words don't give to someone the word before it is their time to receive that word they will know when it is time for them to know and he knows when it's time for them to know you may be sharing the word with your grandmother your grandfather your uncle your cousin this person and they're not even paying you any mind but the moment that time strikes what you said boy what did you say i you can't believe it they won't pay no attention to you all this time and all of a sudden now they start to grab a hold of it and take the whole thing but it's not us forcing this word of anybody it's not us taking a a rope and lassoing people and and bring them in the church all tied up and ready to be branded no sir but we are here to just share the word let's all be doing in love patience virtue broadly kindness we just share the word and they come when it is time for them to come and we know the pathway is few there be that find it many will be in the net of the message but when he comes himself he's picking out this the the rainbow trout all the crab all the spiders all the snakes all them kind of spirits spooky spirits weird spirits suspicious spirits spirits of doubt and fear and unbelief god is weeding and winning the whole thing out now praise god and he's coming down to the same time homegoing time rapture time jubilee time and we are a part of it amen we're a part of it amen when time blends into eternity and we go back from where we come from amen we come from god we're going back to god you're not creatures of time the prophet of god said he says you come from eternity and you're going back to eternity you come from god and you're going back to god amen you can't help that that's got nothing to do with you and that that's god's plan and whether you like it or not it's working that way it's going to work that way and it is working that way we thank god he says here watch he said they had a great jubilee homecoming time then and we we have a great jubilee in a homecoming time now i'm so happy that we have a homecoming we have a homecoming time in heaven for the glory and praise of our god hallelujah oh praise can i preach a little bit more amen hallelujah one rapturous passed and another one is on the way and we are sitting in anticipation we are sitting in expectation waiting for this next rapture which has already started for the shout has gone forth amen the voice of the archangel the trump of god we are in the process of a rapture a lot of people are waiting for a certain a day and all of a sudden that specific day all of a sudden they're going to be caught up or you'll better be caught up with the word right now you better be caught up in the revelation right now hallelujah so that the change is taking place right now you are being changed from glory unto glory until you walk right into the glory you step in the presence of almighty god changed by god's power to transform amen glory to god one day i passed and i saw a building and when i passed by the building i hear all kind of knocking and sawing and everything but they had um you know drop sheets covering up the whole building another day when i got a pass weeks later they pull off the drop sheet and there is a beautiful building i want to tell you god is working on a building he's working on a sure foundation some nations amen oh praise god but this building is no sound of any saw or hammer is going to be heard but he's working on the building and the building is you and me shaped in the form of a bride hallelujah the part of him the word that was taken out from him his wife and sent to the earth place in human bodies but come he's come back now to call his wife back to himself to take her position in christ that she might recognize who she is that she is a part of the world she has not been made a part of the world she was the word to begin with that is why she's brought back to himself back to him part of the word hallelujah what a glorious time we're living in what a glorious word that we can say i and my father are one is that right i and my father are one glory to god hallelujah oh praise god amen i tell you friends it's something else that we can look to god and realize that uh just like they had 1948 amen the prophet of god said israel had another homecoming day what they were going back to their own lands on the wings of eagles of course the prophets there was no bigger board that they could relate to so they called aeroplanes that they seen call them eagles right they went back on the wings of eagles flying oh my and you know in 1948 they took them back on planes turned them back to their land they had never seen this land nothing they were away from it for so long like we are away from our land our country our nation our people we're away for our whole lifetimes amen for church ages the bride has been away but it's homecoming time it's time to go home back to the lord back to christ back to the original faith amen just like they did in 1948 the wings of the eagles we sing the song swing down low sweet chariot coming for to carry me home swing low sweet chariot coming forth to carry me home i looked over jordan and what did i see coming for to carry me home a band of angels coming after me coming for to carry me home so swing low sweet chariot coming for the carry me home swing low sweet chariot coming for to carry me home oh praise god heaven come down amen christ is the mystery of god revealed he said do you know what's happening heaven and lord kissed god and man being reconciled oh my god in christ christ in the church the kingdom come in oh glory to god brother sister we're going back i said we're going back the great magnet is already in the sky it's pulling you right back where you come from all you little jew drops you've got to go back where you come from i feel the pull i hear a voice oh praise god there's something drawing me into the presence of almighty god hallelujah oh praise god praise god amen our seven church ages are over for serving sin years of battling against sin some of you cut your scarred your mark you go through all kind of troubles you can't describe it somebody call you and say oh you she got bad luck oh he's a bad lucky guy uh this happened this happened my friends god knew all about it before it all happened god knew all about it amen because now is our jubilee time the seven church ages are over and it is now jubilee time for the bride it's homegoing time for the bride time to take back what belongs to your praise god time to possess your possessions time to claim brother lot time to claim your brother your sister your mother your father oh praise god whoever they are time for you to reach out by faith in the name of jesus christ and with the power of almighty god amen hallelujah look i can say what i want here i can say what i want but what i am saying don't mean nothing if god don't back it up amen abraham i mean abel gave all kind of talks about his blood and this and that but god had to come and testify about his gifts so it's not him gonna tell you this and tell you that that don't mean nothing but let god come and testify about this yes let him testify about the word you're hearing praise god hallelujah i i'm not here preaching to be recognized my god if i were recognized worldwide what does that have to do with it i'm standing here i'm a nobody nobody knows me but there's presidents of countries that talk to me and call me on the phone so what what does that mean make me better than you make me bigger make me somebody one of them said you are now the bishop over my whole country i said well thank you very much but those kinds of bishop is not what i see in the bible so it's okay you see that's the thing brothers you've got to understand we stay with the world we just here to be a blessing not just here to build up a big ministry big name like i've always said if i wanted to i wanted to get thousands of believers inside of a big building i could have had that but we're not here for a thousand we're searching to find god's faithful few one two three four five amen wherever they are whoever they are whether they're rich they're poor whether they're sick they're blind they're troubled we are here with the word that's how the prophet taught us that's what he left with us that's what we left with in this storehouse and that's all we can talk about is what is in the storehouse but be talking from the storehouse don't mean that i go and be a parrot you read anywhere in the word of god where the prophet said behold i call you to be a pirate brother branham said this brother branham said that brother sure he said that just like every time we don't go say paul said this paul said that paul said you don't have to do that your mother sent you with a message to your aunt you don't go and that mother said that this this this and you repeat the message word for word no you understand the message because you understand it you tell the person what your mother wants is that right and this is what a lot of believers don't understand they think by just quoting the prophet's message that gives them power that don't give you no power none whatsoever you just quoting what he said without understanding without revelation without the holy spirit back of that word amen but we got to have a clear revelation which he called perfect realization when you come to a perfect realization and the bible becomes like a new bible that spoken word books will become you all over again there's something talking to you out of that word there's something revealing itself to you out of that word oh praise god if i were to take um uh some of these brothers uh it's just so many things um jay wait a minute did you know brother branham i said no he said why he said that how are you acting like that how are you talking like that i don't know him i never met him i don't have to meet him it's like paul said i met a man in the spirit well i've seen him in in various ways and watch him come and come up to the platform and take my notes look at them look at the scripture i'm reading are are those stung songs in the scriptures yes sir i'm just saying exactly what you said and he looks at them they are found in the scriptures just keep preaching what you're preaching and that's all i'm doing preach the word as simple as that and you can call me dummy foolishness you can tell me i can speak in a more cultured way and that's that sort of stuff yeah well it when i was in the school that's how they train you you have to be ministerial you have to have your gestures right you have your talk right your pacing your cadence your this your that your hermeneutics and your apologetics and your and they've gone down the road with all those things but when you understand it's satan using those things to draw you into a system of thinking he's trying to draw you into a pattern that he can anticipate but the sons and daughters of god god bring them out of that so they can move as the spirit moves and the satan the prophet said in the church age book that's what gets him angry and mad because revelation he can't track he can't trace he can't copy he can't imitate because it comes from god by grace you don't study your way into this you say oh i read all the books i've been through it for years 40 years that don't mean that to god amen until he opens your eyes until he reveals that word of god to you amen oh homecoming day brother praise god we're homecoming time now a plane is taking you back for your homecoming but we're going to have more than a plane amen we're going to be taken back to glory by the lord himself shall descend with a shout the voice of the archangel and the trap of god we go into the presence of god i'm going to wind this up there's more can be said here lots more can be said here about joseph bones going back when he said don't leave my bones not one don't leave not one i don't care if their experience starts to get dried up but you take every single bone back with you take them back to the land and that's the same thing we got to have that same attitude we'll take them back to the land praise god for his glory amen praise god turn in your bibles now hallelujah revelation 7 9-17 hallelujah after this after all the 144 000 are called after the church ages are over amen i beheld and law a great multitude which no man could number of all nations all kindreds and kindreds and people and tongues stood before the troll and before the lamb clothed with white robes this is not the white throne judgment right because they're standing before the lamb here amen the throne the lamb clothed with white robes which is a symbol of righteousness and palms in their hands a symbol of an overcomer or a man of peace and an overcomer that's what the romans used to show their victories amen and cried with a loud voice saying salvation to our god who sitted upon the throne and unto the lamb and all the angels stood round about the throne and about the elders and four beasts and fell before the throne on their faces and worshiped god saying amen blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be unto our god forever and for ever amen and and one of the elders answered and saying unto me what are these which are a red and white robes and whence came thee and i said unto him sardan rest and he said to me these are the which came out of great tribulation not out of the great tribulation the great tribulation that is yet to come but while they were on the earth they suffered great tribulation they passed through great tribulation some of you maybe know what i'm talking about maybe you're passing through some right now pass through great tribulation and have washed their robes amen they didn't go and go back in the world and get it all speckled up and messed up and mussed up and dirty up but they got washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb therefore are there before the throne of god and like a wife serves a husband and serve him day and night in his temple and he that sitted on the throne shall dwell amongst them they shall hunger no more neither thirst anymore neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them heal it at me o blessed thought o praise god and shall lead them onto living fountains of waters and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and you know another scripture says and there shall be no more death when i was a boy my parents were christians in the sense that they believed the bible my grandfather was met by a man in white who told him not to join any denomination i was still i'm still a little boy maybe nine or ten and told him to go and cry out against mr babylon and identify the catholic church and i thank god was a witness when he was preaching in front of a catholic a cathedral and the police came and carried him away i seen it with these eyes and he went to jail for that and then left uh when he came out he went to another part of the country about 150 miles away fire came out of the heavens and burned the whole thing down my friends i want to tell you from that background the holy spirit caused my parents not to join any denominations and used to read the bible they would sing hymns sing songs and read the scriptures gets us to memorize scripture at home and this is one of the songs that when they sang it it made me weep and it made me cry and i'd like to just read the words for you it's a song sang by one of the old singers charles stanley and later on by the carter family and then even later johnny cash saying this i saw a wereworn pilgrim and tattered garments clad and struggling up the mountain it seems as he was sad his back was heavy laden his strength was almost gone but he shouted as he journeyed deliverance will come o then palms of victory crowns of glory palms of victory i shall wear the summer sun was shining the sweat was on his brown his garments worn and dusty his steps seemed very slow but he kept pressing onward for he was nearing home still shouting as he journeyed deliverance will come all the songsters in the harbor that stood beside the way try to attract his attention inviting his delay but his watchword being onward he stopped his heirs and he ran still shouting as he journeyed deliverance will come i saw him in the evening the sun was bending low heat over top the mountain and reached the veil below he saw the golden city his everlasting home and he shouted loud hosanna deliverance will come all then palms of victory while gazing on that city just order the narrow flood a band of holy angels came from the throne of god they bore him on their pinions safe or the dashing form and join him in his triumph deliverance has come oh than palms of victory musicians crowns of glory poems of victory i shall wear my brothers and sisters it's the same thing we will have to sing we look can you see the lights of that city as you're nearing home can you see that shining city on the hill that god has placed there the new jerusalem that we are to enter in oh blessed be his holy precious name amen hallelujah what a homecoming day running shouting jumping praising god hugging old brother peter brother gordon just rejoice back in their youth my goodness what a time that will be amen no praise god i want to say that song i used to sing when i was very young almost home we're almost home paul said now is our salvation narrow than we suppose look at what seven ages pass and god has kept them waiting until this time for they without us cannot be made perfect amen hallelujah maybe you wandered far away from god and now you're coming home the paths of sin too long you've tried but now you're coming home i am coming i am [Music] open wide open [Music] and your ideals your beliefs you wandered away from your upbringing your family love amen wandered away from the old man and that old mother

marked amen and there you are returning home after this great war after the greatest battle ever thought is about to be over and you're being called home now and we're going back home to god amen or praise god i've read and watched on tv prisoners that didn't commit any crimes but were in jail for 40 years and they lose them now to go back home friends the prophet said listen in your flesh you might have done things but he said that seed sinneth not you're justified you never did something wrong to begin with because in christ hallelujah you're perfect in jesus christ amen hallelujah and so

about you but i passed through a lot of stormy weather i tell you that ship rocked that ship rolled the mass got broken and everything else and the devil talking to you and telling you this and tell you that but let me tell you i'd rather be on a stormy sea in a ship with jesus than to be on the solid land out there with the devil i'd rather stay with the word of god no matter how stormy it becomes around me i'll solder god's unchanged hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah amen right now my granddaughter is in kingston university away from home and family and here we are upon the earth
