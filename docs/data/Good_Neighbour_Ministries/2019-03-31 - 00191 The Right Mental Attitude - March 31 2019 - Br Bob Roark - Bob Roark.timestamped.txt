[0:00] Moses rather and there's a statement in
[0:04] that chapter with one word that was
[0:07] there at all
[0:07] and that is nevertheless nevertheless
[0:11] here's for though this list the land is
[0:15] exactly as it was described we could say
[0:18] the Word of God and be any man in
[0:21] America it is absolutely true in and we
[0:25] might be substituting a genuine faith or
[0:30] just a mental asset for it and they say
[0:38] nevertheless we we are witnesses
[0:42] we're illnesses of a fruit- that has
[0:45] been brought back that this land is as
[0:47] it was described but nevertheless so
[0:51] there happen to be for the promise of
[0:54] God and for their inheritance my brother
[0:59] and sister was a very negative attitude
[1:04] that eliminated them from from
[1:07] possessing their inheritance now I
[1:11] wonder if in the Grusin community across
[1:18] the world I believe that we could be
[1:20] better we would be better we would be
[1:24] better if we allow the Word of God to be
[1:30] released from our house instead of how
[1:36] we here feel touch tasting in numbers 14
[1:44] actually the two that have a different
[1:48] the majority were definitely in the
[1:50] party was just one cake we can take the
[1:53] left his house really does we're not
[2:00] gonna be denied where he made me do it
[2:06] every promise in Redemption the Prophet
[2:09] said for the brother branham senator not
[2:11] my brother sister Anna not says that
[2:14] they they do mean matter whatsoever but
[2:17] every promise that God gave us in
[2:19] Redemption if it's physical healing that
[2:31] you are as the Providence say he cannot
[2:35] heal you he's already
[2:41] amen he's already the work is already
[2:44] complete if it's total it's over nothing
[2:47] has to be done you know what do we do we
[2:51] can say by His stripes I have a physical
[3:03] attack we can say by stretch he sent His
[3:07] Word and healed us I'm human aaron cohen
[3:13] and intro an avid christ and numbers
[3:15] chapter 14 verse 28 as truly in his
[3:19] homily of said the lord and you have
[3:22] spoken in my ears
[3:24] so what i do to you it's a lot of a
[3:29] warning that he hears us whatever we're
[3:36] saying say Amen he's aware of there's
[3:41] not a word that he is that is released
[3:46] from our mouth that he is open anyway so
[3:50] he knows when you are putting the Word
[3:54] of God in your inner being cooked put
[3:59] the things that you need in life that
[4:04] scripture tasks put that into our other
[4:09] things we'll take care of themselves you
[4:12] live life
[4:15] if you want to see good days I love I
[4:20] want to see good days and so the Bible
[4:24] is very very clear that I'm referring my
[4:27] tons of easels just the Navy it's not
[4:31] positive over and that's what we were
[4:41] given by creation in Genesis man was
[4:46] given dominion over this earth the Holy
[4:52] Ghost comes in it throws your body under
[4:57] subjection to the world amen do you
[5:02] believe that I really think we put the
[5:05] word in so the work can come out you're
[5:12] a winner
[5:22] you believe in an overcomer
[5:27] actually of the work you're the head and
[5:30] not the tail you're above only enough in
[5:34] the your plants going out and you're
[5:38] blessed coming in none of us would be
[5:40] won't know that's that's not for me we
[5:45] need that how can we do our promote and
[5:50] further the gospel if we don't have a
[5:52] means to do so and I'm not saying this
[5:58] instance with insensitivity but I think
[6:04] of five healthy joyful victorious spirit
[6:10] soul and my there's a great
[6:14] representative
[6:32] your mouth determines your direction
[6:36] your mouth determines your message your
[6:41] mouth determines what comes to you in
[6:43] this realm of life as it's been said not
[6:47] being sacrilegious but there's no need
[6:50] for any of us to look town the best
[7:04] father in the person of cross juices
[7:09] let's have the best that he affords Amen
