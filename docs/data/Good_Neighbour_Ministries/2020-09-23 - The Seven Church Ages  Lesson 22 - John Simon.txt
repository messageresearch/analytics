TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] praise the lord friends it's good to be here once again by his marvelous love and his matchless grace we shall read out of the book of revelation chapter 2 reading thus [Music] unto the angel of the church of ephesus right these things said he that hold up this seven stars in his right hand who walk it in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks i know thy works and i labor and i patience and how thou canst not bear them which say they are apostles and are not and has found them liars and has born and has patience for my name's has labored and has not fainted gracious heavenly father we thank you so much for the reading of the word we pray that the spirit will give life to the word of god and bless us here together as we gather in your name under your glorious power and influence of your grace we ask it today in the name of jesus christ our last topic was on the the ephesian church age touching on tried and true how that the saints of god were tried but found to be true as they held to god's unchanging hand now what made them true to god what held them to him was their faith their confidence in the precious name of jesus as the old son said all the precious name of jesus wonderful to hear giving hope and cheer all the precious name of jesus oh jesus jesus jesus it's only jesus and jesus alone and that is what i want to talk about today for the scripture says and has born and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted now we can see that in all these things for bearing up under the pressure for their patience during that time laboring in in the vineyard of the lord praise god and using all that to guard the word of god and they did this all for his name's sake or for this wonderful precious name of jesus christ they kept my friends away the adversaries they kept them off from off of the word of god their trials and their persecutions were multitude but they held to god's unchanging hand praise god for the blessed name of jesus amen my friends if you were to examine the book of acts i remember under a study by t.l osborne that he preached on three keys to the book of acts amen and he touched on the word the name and the holy spirit glory to god for here we find with the holy spirit in them they were able to withstand the attack attacks of the enemy by the word of god and by the powerful and precious name of our lord and savior jesus christ for that is the thing friends one can be a christian one can be religious one can be pious but when once you break into the true revelation of the word of god and of the power of the name of jesus christ it brings the enemy to begin to attack you the enemy comes in like a flood because they know you have entered the doors of the sacred temple when the word of god begins to manifest itself in the soul salvation of souls in the healing of the body in signs and wonders and in miracles and other demonstrations then the pharisees as it was in that day so is it today the actors the pharisees of this day begin to act up and begin to what your head they want your reputation they want to destroy the ministry because you come in no other name but the name of jesus a name which was despised amongst the jews mocked by those that have so-called culture manners dignity money position and power the name of jesus was put down and mocked and scoffed at this mighty name of jesus christ they laughed at those who believed in the name of jesus for to them it was just something for them to manipulate and use if you want to believe on the name of jesus that's fine if you want to be kind if you want to be loving if you want to be patient that's great they will turn around and manipulate those qualities and characteristics to enrich themselves to make their names great and their positions powerful while using and laughing and mocking at the name of jesus and the people who followed that name they'll curse the name they laugh at it with the light they'll mock the name of jesus with sarcasm and oh my god they'll talk about the name of jesus as just as if it's just another name it's the name of a new god or a next god or or something else or a great teacher or a great psychologist or a great leader of of the old times there they're trying to put it off deflected in every possible way but we know that there is no other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved but the name of jesus christ oh my friends if you are watching this broadcast here today i pray that the holy spirit will speak into your spirit into your heart even if you're a believer that your your faith will take a deeper route that you might allow yourself to become a tree with deep roots that are rooted and grounded in the precious name of jesus hallelujah praise god hallelujah we will never be ashamed of this name we will never repudiate this name my friends we don't want to be as one that is an unbeliever trying to wheedle our way into the flock of god to defile to mock and to destroy the influence of this name praise god hallelujah oh my thank god when you know the name and the power and the effects of this name your heart is blessed you are revived praise god hallelujah i know there are you know satan gets a heart attack and he gets acid reflux uh by three things and uh first of all is to the revelation of that name of jesus to a believer changes their entire walk and their entire outlook their entire view of the bible of the word of god the life of jesus christ once there is a clear revelation of the name of jesus in that we will see in there the one god will see and there the sovereignty of god the preeminence of god and so on but wonderful my friends to have a clear revelation of the precious and wonderful name of the lord jesus christ the next thing that gives satan acid reflux gives him an upset stomach it gives him a heart failure problems when that name begins to make itself manifest among the believers oh what the god that once again will see jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever making himself manifest amongst the believers in signs and wonders and miracles that the people may see and know that this is not a dead name or the name of a dead god but that we serve a true and a living god and the name is just as powerful today as it was in the name of jesus in the all praise under the days of the apostles for at the name of jesus demons still have to flee they still must bow they still must obey whether they are in a crippled arm a crippled leg a dying body a sick body a diseased body a favorite body a body with blood pressures back pains a body with all manner of aches and all manner of sicknesses at the name of jesus every devil every germ every sickness must flee at the name of jesus christ for in my name he said i give you power and in my name you'll cast out devils you'll lay your hands upon the sick and they shall recover thanks be to god for the wonderful precious name of our lord and savior jesus christ hallelujah the third thing that gives the devil a heart failure an acid risk reflux and it stops all the partying that's going on in hell right dead stop when they realize of the at the mention of that name the movement the activity and the empire and presence of the holy spirit moving amongst the people leading and guiding them for his name's sake and for the glory of god for once the people have heard the word are baptized in the name of jesus christ and the holy spirit begins to indwell them by the laying on of the hands of mighty men of god anointed by the holy spirit and the people begin to know and recognize that they are filled with the holy ghost then they cannot get those people to change the devil can't get those people to change in any way because they know the truth they recognize the word of god for for their age and they know the power the explosive atomic supernatural power that is within this mighty name of jesus christ hallelujah that name was so powerful that man of man of god like paul anointed by the holy spirit aprons we would say in this day handkerchiefs were taken and either laid on by the hands of paul are laid upon the body of palm and there were set the suffering people everywhere in the name of jesus christ hallelujah and when those people came in contact with those uh aprons or handkerchiefs that paul would go from the body of paul miracles would take place suffering will cease disease will depart and thousands will be set free by the presence and by the power of god my friends i have here with me some iprants some handkerchiefs as we in our day will say little prayer cloths which i will pray over and they will go out upon your request just send an email to goodneighborministries.org and we will send one of these out to you and believe in god either by the wearing upon your clothing under clothing or placing it under your pillow or within the pages of your bible or or somewhere that god will lead you with faith and confidence in the name of jesus you can be delivered you may be set free completely praise god somebody with an intimate insanity mental problems praise god hallelujah placing that upon their clothing or under their pillows or somewhere where they rest they may be set free completely because at the name of jesus demons have to flee glory to god hallelujah all manner of diseases must depart for at the mention of this all-sufficient name of jesus christ amen the devil must be depart for our people their face is anchored in the name of jesus christ all this wonderful name of the lord jesus christ listen to the word of god acts 19 11-17 and god wrought special miracles by the hands of paul so that from his body were brought onto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them praise god hallelujah but you know whenever god's spirit moves the devil moves listen to the scriptures then certain of the vagabond vagabond jews you have vagabond christians you have renegade christians rotten to the core my friends placing the people's faith under a new religious system of government rather than putting the people's faith in the uh word of god and under the anointed leadership of the holy spirit they are bringing people under the leadership of some great renowned person of great name great influence great political power great my friends numbers behind him that's what they're attempting to do and thinking that they're faithful they're faithful to the man they're faithful to the organization but they're not faithful to god and many times i believe we are bringing more people into subservience or service or labor to man to organizations of man governments of man's systems of man denominations of man rather than to the ordained anointed and revealed word of god for this day and for this hour oh praise god hallelujah and certain of the vagabond jews exorcists they claim that they could cast out devils too listen took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of jesus christ saying we adjure you by jesus whom paul preached and there were seven sons of skeva and the chief chief of priests which did so and the evil spirit answered and said jesus i know paul i know but who are you and the men in whom the evil spirit left upon them overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded and this was known to all the jews and greeks also dwelling at ephesus and fear fell upon them all and the name of the lord jesus was glorified and magnified forevermore what is it that we just heard we heard just like with moses after he dropped his rod and his rod miraculously became into serpents satan called his magicians and they dropped rods too and their rods became serpents too but moses's rod ate up or swallowed theirs and we see the same thing now taking place spiritually paul sends out and purchase paul casts out devils in the name of jesus and the vagabond jews looking upon this trying to find a way what trick was it that paul was using that they might be able to copycat this they might act upon this and so they went out and said ah we found where the secret is this secret is in the name of jesus you see they were thinking magic but paul was thinking miracles there were thinking my friends that the magic was there was some kind of a magic in the name not realizing that you need to know the person to understand the power and potential that was in that name oh praise god but to mention the name or call the name without the life without the knowledge without the revelation of that divine person the name becomes empty and now these vagabond jewels you have vagabond christians as i've said before they've seen william branham they've seen many other uh evangelists and great other mind and use of god but especially the messenger of this hour the 20th century prophet of this day william marion branham being used of god in the casting out of devils discerning of spirit or praise god and many have tried to copycat this and so back then these sons of skeva they've tried to copy what paul was doing so they went into a home where there was a devil possessed uh pert man and said to the man we are jordy in the name of jesus whom paul preached yes paul preaches it paul has a revelation of it paul knows the name paul knows the person of that name and the potentials behind that name and so paul had a right to and he was saved by the name redeemed by the name called by the name chosen and sent forth in and by the name of jesus so he had a right to the use of this name they had no right no claims no power no birth no baptism nothing whatsoever but they thought that just the name was a magic name at the mention of that name demons would depart and the bible said they mentioned the name of jesus and the scriptures tells us that these devils says yes jesus we know and the devil that knowledge paul we know but who are you we don't see any identification of the name in you we don't see any seed of the name of you we don't see any foundational faith in that name resting inside of you and the bible tells us that the demon-possessed man sprang upon these seven sons of skiva of course you know that's telling you about the seven devil spirits that would be upon the seven church ages controlling and ruling them but here now we see these seven spirits this these spirits jumped upon these seven sons of skiva and says oh i provided you with your clothing i provided you with money i provided with everything you have and you're coming to try to cast me out give me back the clothing that that i gave you give me back the money give me back the power to give me back the influence give me back the position that you had and the devil wounded them harmed them and tore the clothing that they he had given over to them and they had to run for their lives and great fear came upon the people when they heard about that name of jesus christ now we understand that our righteous life must accompany the name it's not just the name but it's the life behind the name that makes the demons tremble it's the life behind the name that makes the proud heart humble it was god who devised this plan that in all things as a man he who lives so he could give give us his life behind our name glory to god hallelujah his life behind your name it makes the demons tremble to know that god lives in you the holy spirit lives in you the great potential the dunamis of the holy spirit dwells in you and at the mention of the name of jesus not only the name of the word of the name but the nature the character of the name dwelling in you the devil knows when it is and when it ate when it's not dwelling in you my friends so we must have the life behind the name for the bible says for whosoever nameth the name of the lord jesus let him depart from sin be ye holy ye that bear the vessels of the lord and again thou shalt not bear the name of the lord thy god in vain you see these ephesians were real christians they were really serving the lord they bore the name and the name was jesus christ and that was the name of the spirit that was within them the holy spirit jesus the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace the almighty the alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and the last and they knew this this is the mighty full name of jesus christ hallelujah now listen and for my name's sake thou has labored and has not fainted hallelujah now remember even though paul was the apostle paul was the messenger of that day they were not laboring for paul they were not laboring to to lift up the name of the messenger they were not laboring for the name of the messenger son timothy in the gospel spiritually speaking they were not there to elevate timothy they were there to bring glory to the word that paul preached to the word that timothy preached to them they were there to label for the word they were not laboring for some organization or group somewhere that was sending them religious material and they looked to that organization as if it were their leadership and it was their headquarters this was the place they were to look for for the fountain of truth no my friends they were not laboring for any group or organization they were not laboring for any man even though it might be paul or timothy or whoever great name great renown great testimonies and everything else but they were laboring for the name of the lord and savior jesus christ they were not committed to programs they were not committed to human plans and human institutions they were not there to build up earthly holdings and to turn them into things of greater value they knew their real estate and so my friends they were not building up human real estate they were not there my friends to build up value in everything there were working for the lord as the old pentecostal chorus says we'll work till jesus comes will work till jesus comes will work till jesus comes and then be gathered home hallelujah will work till jesus come everything those christians those ephesian saints did it was in and for the name of jesus they acted only in that name their refrain from anything that was done that was not in that name of course there's a true vine and a false vine twins in the beginning twins at the end always that's the way it was and so here's it again while the true vine was working to lift up that name the false vein wanted to defile the name of jesus and they were mingled in the midst rivening walls coaching walls vagabond walls hiding in the midst and in the dark waiting to tear down that name my god always trying to undermine the kingdom of god always trying to move away from the foundation of god hallelujah but thanks be to god for those saints of god for the bible says the foundations of god stand sure and the lord knows them that are his they stood true to the word of god and they he held on to god's unchanging hand thanks be to god they were tried they were true they were patient they labored and they bore whatever came for his name sake nevertheless god had a complaint in revelation chapter 2 verse 4 nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love after doing all these wonderful marvelous things satan got in the midst started to dilute and water down the true faith of god and move the people from their balance from their center and move them just slightly away from the word of god where they began to lose the warp the fire the originality of their raw primitive christian faith and love for god within the word of god hallelujah amen praise god now we know this message of course is not just the ephesians back there but it's to the entire age or church ages all of the church ages that this would be a spirit that would be in every church age trying to get your believers to fall away from the original faith doctrines atmosphere and approach to god as was delivered and given to us by the messenger of our age hallelujah now of course we know them as the ephesian churches lasted for about 120 years and that the message given to them was a message that was to span many many ages we also know the principle how that history repeats itself hallelujah praise god so one generation would receive revival and it will fade out in the next one generation would receive revival and the revival will begin to fade out in the next a prophet would come apostle would come a message will come bring revival and then it will begin to slowly fade out in the next except for the few that will hold these coals of fire these embers of their word of god and the fire of the holy spirit that god had placed within their soul and that little flock would hold to god's word hallelujah amen oh praise god amen but to others not even a little ember of the original flame will remember what will be in them they'll wander away they'll drift away they'll have their own thoughts and all god's approp gifts will find their appropriate places and others will find no place for the bible tells us and for like judas there was no place found before him and like lucifer that was cast out from heaven he was cast out for there was no place found for him and my friends that's the way it is many would be in the midst but after a while they've gone through everything and they think they know everything they'll start to drift away their fate will begin to become a very shallow and cheap and after a while they'll find their places back where they come from whether it be a snake a turkish a spider or some other crayfish or some other spirit that was once in the net but then they'll drift away but ah thank god the true rainbow trout will hold to god's word and live by the word of god hallelujah amen praise god amen so my friends we know god has no grandchildren and that is why the same original truth must repeat again and again in every messenger that comes to every age and thank god for the messenger of this age that we have received the original faith once again that was once delivered unto the saints of god and this is what we are holding to may god help every one of us as we hold to god's truth and god's unchanging hand may the lord bless you may the spirit of god go with you may he overshadow you and may i say take the name of jesus with you child of sorrow and the woe it will joy and comfort give you if you take this name with you wherever you go may god bless you may you take the name of jesus with you may he bless you all of the week and all of the years ahead of you until we come together in the church on sunday morning to bring glory and praise to his wonderful name and just to let you know there will be a water baptism on sunday in the name of the lord jesus christ may god bless every one of you until we come together again god bless you [Music] you
