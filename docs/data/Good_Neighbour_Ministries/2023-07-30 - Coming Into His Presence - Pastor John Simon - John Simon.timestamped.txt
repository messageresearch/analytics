[50:39] uh you just don't come as you like into
[50:43] the presence of a king
[50:45] you don't come when you want in the
[50:49] presence of royalty
[50:52] you don't come on your own terms
[50:55] you don't come as you desire
[50:58] but you've got to come to that King on
[51:02] the certain circumstances amen
[51:05] hallelujah I want you to know my
[51:08] brothers and sisters it's very important
[51:10] that we know that
[51:12] because we know that you must come to
[51:17] this King amen by first invitation
[51:22] you can't come without an invitation you
[51:26] can come to church but I'm talking about
[51:28] the king God himself inviting you amen
[51:33] inviting your soul on the inside to come
[51:36] closer to him and to love him and to
[51:40] serve him to worship him to bring glory
[51:43] to his name he draws you to that place
[51:47] where you feel full fullness of joy you
[51:51] feel fulfilled and you come to a perfect
[51:54] realization that this is your place
[51:58] this is your position this is the
[52:01] condition you're supposed to be in
[52:03] praising his name we have our everyday
[52:05] things we have to do that's just your
[52:07] flesh your natural being have to do
[52:09] those things to survive while you're
[52:11] down here but in your soul praise God
[52:14] you want to know I'm living in the
[52:17] presence of the king amen praise God
[52:20] don't you want to live in his presence
[52:22] every day every hour to feel his
[52:25] cleansing power and to know that you are
[52:28] living in the presence of the very King
[52:30] that you are serving praise God
[52:33] forevermore you've got to come by
[52:35] invitation
[52:37] you also got to come with preparation
[52:41] you just don't come anyway but you come
[52:44] by invitation
[52:46] Hallelujah Were you invited into his
[52:49] presence that invitation only comes to
[52:52] those who were in his mind before the
[52:54] foundation of the world it goes out to
[52:57] The Cry goes out to everyone
[53:01] whosoever will
[53:04] makeup
[53:07] just come so so the god the cry goes out
[53:12] everybody believes they they can be
[53:14] saved everybody believes the blood was
[53:16] shed for them everybody believes that
[53:19] they can come like they want to come and
[53:22] you you can come but you must come to
[53:25] the King by invitation
[53:28] you've got to have a token
[53:30] you've got to have an invitation
[53:33] something that shows you've been invited
[53:36] to this Feast for this party to this
[53:39] wedding supper uh other than that you
[53:41] have nothing but praise God we know that
[53:45] he planted that within our hearts
[53:47] so we feel different in here than every
[53:51] other individual
[53:53] let me feel religious they may feel they
[53:55] have to got theological explanations
[53:57] they got to come to him by reasoning
[53:59] they got to reason it out and analyze it
[54:02] and debate it before they can have a
[54:05] perfect stand of which they can take but
[54:07] we don't come that way we don't come by
[54:10] reason all I know is I feel the Paul I
[54:12] hear a voice I recognize the day my hour
[54:16] and the power of the spirit of almighty
[54:18] God working within my soul amen oh
[54:22] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[54:25] Lord amen praise God we find out that
[54:29] we've got to come with the proper
[54:30] approach
[54:32] as the prophet said there is an approach
[54:35] to God
[54:36] and you may want to come your own way
[54:38] but God has a provided way and God has a
[54:43] way of approach that you must come to
[54:46] him every King every royalty has that
[54:51] same way that we must come in the
[54:53] presence of God hallelujah amen yes sir
[54:57] so I want you to know this is the hour
[54:59] that we are coming more and more closely
[55:03] into the presence of the Lord like Paul
[55:07] puts it this way he says you're in the
[55:09] church but you may not recognize it but
[55:12] the word revealed to you is the glory of
[55:14] God being made known and he is saying
[55:16] you are going to move from Glory into
[55:19] Glory into glory and it's going to get
[55:23] so high one day you have walked right
[55:25] into the Glory Hallelujah you're not of
[55:29] work you are of Heaven you are not of
[55:31] mankind you are of God's kind Hallelujah
[55:35] you are not here just to be a man a
[55:39] woman live eat die but your sons and
[55:42] daughters of the Living God that come
[55:44] from the very presence of the Eternal
[55:47] one and you return back to Eternal where
[55:50] you come from amen yes sir praise the
[55:53] name of the Lord amen now I want to use
[55:57] uh here
[55:59] the the story of Esther which you can
[56:03] find that in the Book of Esther and
[56:06] mainly around chapters two and four but
[56:10] you can read that book of Esther and you
[56:12] will see there how that vasty the queen
[56:15] who was the queen at that time married
[56:18] to a authorus the king and how she was
[56:21] there and uh of course that woman got
[56:26] her power from him
[56:29] because he was King that is why she was
[56:32] respected as Queen
[56:34] but she start to feel because she has
[56:37] power wealth and royalty I I do this on
[56:41] my own I got all this yeah I I just done
[56:44] it so so after a while he called for her
[56:47] and she's rebelling against him don't
[56:49] want to hear so he says okay
[56:52] that's it
[56:54] I put her away and I need to find a wife
[56:58] that listened to me
[57:00] and so he said go throughout the land
[57:02] and get all the beautiful virgins that
[57:06] you think I may like and bring them and
[57:08] then I will make much I will make my
[57:11] choice
[57:12] they're not going to choose me I'm going
[57:14] to choose them praise the Lord you
[57:17] didn't choose him he chooses you
[57:19] you don't come to this altar now and say
[57:22] I take Jesus you don't just take him you
[57:25] don't take who you want and marry them
[57:27] no he attacks you
[57:30] and he has come to take us praise God
[57:33] hallelujah praise the Lord so here it is
[57:36] he said I'll choose who I want so Esther
[57:39] was brought to the palace and she was
[57:42] put into the care of some eunuchs of
[57:45] course we don't want to preach on that
[57:47] that's another subject spiritual eunuchs
[57:49] these men that were were in a state
[57:53] where they were of no danger to the
[57:56] women around them they didn't need
[57:58] anything from them they didn't want
[58:00] anything from them all they want to do
[58:02] is the will of the king
[58:04] amen they had no seat of their own that
[58:07] they could plant so they they just did
[58:09] the will of God Amen and a real man of
[58:13] God that's what he's here it's not the
[58:15] plant himself in your heart but to plant
[58:17] the word of God in your heart to plant
[58:20] the revelation of the holy spirit in
[58:22] your soul so that you look to Jesus and
[58:25] see Jesus only amen lift it up high and
[58:28] mighty you have a lasting God Amen yes
[58:32] sir praise God forevermore so so then
[58:36] they were brought to the eunuch and the
[58:41] the Bible says here and the you not gave
[58:44] to them things for their purification
[58:48] their beautification and their
[58:51] preparation he provided to them the
[58:54] things that they needed amen that is
[58:57] what the real minister of God does
[58:59] provides you the word but if you have to
[59:02] take the word and apply into your life
[59:06] he is not going to come and do
[59:08] everything for you you've got to do it
[59:10] yourself
[59:11] amen you've got to apply the token to
[59:14] you by yourself after you receive it to
[59:17] yourself amen and so those she took what
[59:21] they gave her and started to prepare
[59:24] herself amen oh praise God I want you to
[59:28] know that even as she did that amen God
[59:33] gave her grace amen praise God God gave
[59:38] her grace and so they were doing what
[59:41] they were making themselves all ready
[59:44] amen do you know the denominations are
[59:47] making ready for the rapture
[59:49] do you know there were 10 virgins you
[59:52] know five were wise and five were
[59:54] foolish yet there were all virgins
[59:57] righteous people good people good people
[59:59] they just haven't caught the revelation
[1:00:02] of the word of God and they're giving it
[1:00:05] denominational applications which are
[1:00:09] not in line with the purpose and promise
[1:00:11] for this day and for this hour to
[1:00:14] fulfill Revelation 10 7 Malachi 4 5. no
[1:00:19] sir they're not there with that
[1:00:21] whatsoever and so she began to prepare
[1:00:25] but an interjection into this story
[1:00:29] how that on the other hand the Jews
[1:00:33] existence were being challenged
[1:00:37] and there would have been exterminated
[1:00:40] and so her uncle sends to her a message
[1:00:44] telling her don't think because you are
[1:00:47] queen and you're up in the palace you're
[1:00:49] going to escape this so you'd better go
[1:00:52] in and see the King right you'll find it
[1:00:56] right in your Bible in the Book of
[1:00:57] Esther and she answered him and said but
[1:01:00] as you know according to the laws none
[1:01:05] can approach the King on their own
[1:01:08] unless my invitation
[1:01:12] if the king doesn't give you an
[1:01:14] invitation and you try to go in to see
[1:01:17] him the guards will kill you you will be
[1:01:20] killed you cannot come on your own
[1:01:24] you've got to come by your recognition
[1:01:27] praise the Lord God's holy spirit
[1:01:30] telling you that this is something
[1:01:33] totally different amen and so she said
[1:01:37] fast and pray for me because I've got to
[1:01:40] get into the presence of the king amen I
[1:01:44] trust you will have that kind of hunger
[1:01:46] answers that you want to live in the
[1:01:50] very presence of the king amen and if I
[1:01:54] perish let me perish but I've got to see
[1:01:56] the king amen I've got to see what I
[1:01:59] read in this Bible I got to see the Holy
[1:02:02] Ghost I've got to see the power of God
[1:02:04] I've got to see the presence of God I've
[1:02:07] got to experience the god of Heaven amen
[1:02:09] if I perish let me perish but I'm going
[1:02:12] to see the king
[1:02:14] amen yes sir and so she began to fast
[1:02:19] and and pray to see the king amen and so
[1:02:25] we find out that the she she asked you
[1:02:30] not to take her in the presence of the
[1:02:33] king he said well I'll take your butt
[1:02:35] you know the Lord you can live or die
[1:02:39] amen because no man comes to the king
[1:02:43] accept him who he will stretch forth his
[1:02:47] scepter
[1:02:49] Hallelujah God has to give you the
[1:02:53] revelation
[1:02:54] God has to stretch forth his
[1:02:57] Supernatural hand and give you the word
[1:02:59] for this day and for this hour if he
[1:03:03] doesn't do that you cannot spiritually
[1:03:06] come you may physically come but
[1:03:09] physically you cannot come amen only by
[1:03:13] the king reaching out look you come by
[1:03:15] invitation you come by the king's
[1:03:18] reaction praise the Lord God reacting to
[1:03:22] you and you're going to see that if
[1:03:24] you're a True Believer and you genuinely
[1:03:27] believe the word you're gonna start to
[1:03:29] see little inclinations little
[1:03:31] intimations little little things that
[1:03:34] will begin to make them make you become
[1:03:37] conscious yes God is dealing with me as
[1:03:42] an individual I I I see him in my life I
[1:03:46] see him in my walk I see him at whatever
[1:03:49] I do nobody else may see it but he wants
[1:03:52] you to know that he's dealing with you
[1:03:55] and for you to see it and for you to
[1:03:58] recognize it
[1:03:58] [Applause]
[1:04:02] while I was thinking on these things I
[1:04:05] remember one time was with my father
[1:04:08] when he was alive
[1:04:10] walking in the jungles of Guyana real
[1:04:14] jungles not not little woods like these
[1:04:17] but behind every Bush and every shrub
[1:04:21] could be a a jaguar or a big python or
[1:04:27] something you've got to be alert and
[1:04:30] there were people a few Hunters with
[1:04:33] guns but that were there but you still
[1:04:35] need to be alert because just brushing a
[1:04:38] leaf might be a green little snake that
[1:04:40] can and and that's it so so you're you
[1:04:43] better be alert so uh that's why I said
[1:04:46] even now for me to go back there I can't
[1:04:49] survive because the senses that oh my
[1:04:52] they've got to be there so anyway I can
[1:04:55] go in the city maybe and even there I
[1:04:57] gotta be careful because you got other
[1:05:00] snakes and other animals in the Concrete
[1:05:03] Jungle but
[1:05:05] there my brothers
[1:05:08] they were hunting and I was just looking
[1:05:10] around and while I'm looking around all
[1:05:13] of a sudden the wind blew
[1:05:16] and the leaves because that I should
[1:05:19] explain to you the canopy of these
[1:05:21] leaves makes down there like Twilight
[1:05:24] it's almost dark you can see but it's
[1:05:28] still not light
[1:05:29] and the wind blue and the some of the
[1:05:32] leaves move and a shaft of sunlight came
[1:05:35] from way up top
[1:05:37] and down into the jungle and it came
[1:05:40] right on an orchid that was hanging on
[1:05:44] one of those trees and it was so
[1:05:46] beautiful
[1:05:48] amen natural and beautiful and I said
[1:05:52] wow look at that my hair and I you know
[1:05:56] I just turned the call and as I turned
[1:05:59] to call the thought let me put it that
[1:06:01] way it said that's for you to see
[1:06:05] that's not for anyone else and after
[1:06:08] you're gone from here that Orchid is no
[1:06:11] more it'll just wither up and gone
[1:06:13] nobody else will ever see it but that
[1:06:15] was for you
[1:06:16] and that's what I'm trying to tell you
[1:06:18] God will make known to you amen of his
[1:06:23] own it's not even I'm telling you just
[1:06:26] as to help you but I it's not me gonna
[1:06:29] open your eyes not nobody can nobody can
[1:06:33] not my mother not my father not my
[1:06:35] sister not my brother not the Deacon not
[1:06:37] the pastor nobody but God himself
[1:06:40] Hallelujah can open up your heart open
[1:06:42] up your eyes amen yes sir and so
[1:06:46] individually God begins to deal with us
[1:06:49] Amen in that way
[1:06:52] you know the rest of the story how that
[1:06:55] she went in the presence of the king and
[1:06:58] the King found out what was happening
[1:07:00] behind his back and how uh this spell
[1:07:03] the fellow was hanged amen right Haman
[1:07:06] was hanged because of what he was doing
[1:07:10] but I want you to see that you come
[1:07:13] coming into his presences By Invitation
[1:07:17] by Divine approach it's by God's
[1:07:21] reaction and acceptance of you as his
[1:07:24] own praise the name of the Lord that's
[1:07:27] how we come in the presence of the king
[1:07:30] amen praise the Lord now I just briefly
[1:07:34] want to mention to you here that if you
[1:07:38] in the Old Testament if you wanted to
[1:07:41] come into the presence of a God or the
[1:07:45] presence of the king you have to come to
[1:07:48] the Tabernacle
[1:07:50] and when you came to the Tabernacle the
[1:07:54] Tabernacle had an outer Court
[1:07:57] an inner Court
[1:07:59] and the holy of holies
[1:08:02] which held of course the great Ark of
[1:08:06] the Covenant the pillar of fire the two
[1:08:09] cherubim so the pure fire hanging in
[1:08:11] between them and so on behind the veil
[1:08:14] made of badger skins good skins and so
[1:08:17] on praise the Lord but that's how they
[1:08:20] had to approach God remember this
[1:08:22] outside
[1:08:24] was the wide world
[1:08:27] and then if you had some kind of a
[1:08:30] religious belief you may make it into
[1:08:32] the outer Court
[1:08:34] all right because you at least you got a
[1:08:36] religious belief you you believe in
[1:08:39] something or some God or or you feel
[1:08:42] that you should live a better life or
[1:08:44] something so you you'll come into the
[1:08:47] outer court right but then when you come
[1:08:51] into the outer Court then you find out
[1:08:55] that that outer court that you're living
[1:08:58] in there there was a uh like uh in there
[1:09:02] when you come in with a basin which you
[1:09:04] had to take some water begin to wash
[1:09:06] yourself you right before you come in
[1:09:09] the presence of God remember that's you
[1:09:10] washing yourself I don't want to go into
[1:09:13] all of these things even just you
[1:09:15] washing yourself that's not God washing
[1:09:17] you yet you just washing up yourself the
[1:09:19] best you know how to come in the
[1:09:21] presence of the Living God Amen but when
[1:09:24] you are in there in that outer Court
[1:09:28] even when you come to the inner Court
[1:09:30] you're still going by daylight you're
[1:09:34] still going by Moonlight and starlight
[1:09:38] and you're going by all those lights
[1:09:40] coming on you uh the best that you know
[1:09:43] how but you see when you enter into the
[1:09:46] holy of holies it was so enclosed with
[1:09:49] these Badger skins that were like about
[1:09:52] six inches or more thick Badger skins
[1:09:55] and goat skins of stuff like that that
[1:09:58] were put up there praise God that there
[1:10:01] was no natural light in there and no uh
[1:10:05] sounds were penetrating in there it was
[1:10:09] just the quiet presence
[1:10:12] of the pillar of fire which represented
[1:10:15] the presence of almighty God
[1:10:18] that was right there in between the two
[1:10:21] cherubims that were there on the Ark of
[1:10:24] the Covenant and the Ten Commandments
[1:10:27] were in the ark right oh my and the
[1:10:30] pillar of fire was hanging right above
[1:10:32] that like that amen praise God I want
[1:10:36] you to see that picture and understand
[1:10:38] this let me quote here now look
[1:10:42] civilization travels with the Sun from
[1:10:45] the East to the West this is an oriental
[1:10:48] Bible the Bible is an oriental book do
[1:10:51] you believe that
[1:10:53] see and now we find when the Great
[1:10:57] Pentecostal church was inaugurated great
[1:11:01] signs and wonders followed it upon the
[1:11:04] basis of the shed blood and the Holy
[1:11:08] Ghost going forward with great signs
[1:11:11] amen then you know after the Pentecostal
[1:11:15] age then come the next Church Age come
[1:11:19] in
[1:11:20] then that begins to dwindle out
[1:11:24] and then it went Plumb on down till it
[1:11:28] went down through 1500 years of Dark
[1:11:32] Ages amen then it started coming up
[1:11:36] again
[1:11:37] what it's never been light since the
[1:11:40] Pentecostal day amen certainly not the
[1:11:45] sun rose and gave its light it's been a
[1:11:48] day long for the breaking of the
[1:11:51] daylight when the sun come up then it
[1:11:54] went dim and dimmed out and dimmed and
[1:11:56] dimmed but the prophet said there will
[1:11:59] be a day
[1:12:01] amen that can't be day or night
[1:12:05] a kind of a day that's smoky
[1:12:08] oh my cloudy time aren't we living in a
[1:12:12] cloudy time my goodness lies are
[1:12:15] everywhere chaos is everywhere you don't
[1:12:18] know what to believe you can hardly see
[1:12:21] clearly anything that you want to do you
[1:12:24] you got to think carefully if you'll use
[1:12:26] a computer you know that even an email
[1:12:29] is not just normal you've got to watch
[1:12:31] carefully it might be look like an email
[1:12:33] from a friend and it could be an email
[1:12:36] from a deadly enemy
[1:12:39] it can be what's up whatever it is but
[1:12:42] you dealing with these things you see
[1:12:45] something saying now this is something
[1:12:47] comes from the government CRA and you
[1:12:50] have been given so many uh dollars back
[1:12:54] from the government but you need first
[1:12:57] to send us your information
[1:13:00] so that we know where to send it
[1:13:03] right see everywhere it's a cloudy day
[1:13:07] it's a time of chaos one one of the
[1:13:11] Apostles said in the last days perilous
[1:13:14] time shall come
[1:13:16] perilous times shall come very deceiving
[1:13:19] hour that we are living living in while
[1:13:23] this the deceiving Rider is riding black
[1:13:27] nor white neither black nor white just a
[1:13:30] mixed up mixed up uh uh melange of
[1:13:34] everything that is on the face of the
[1:13:36] Earth right now likewise everything is
[1:13:39] calling itself Christian
[1:13:41] mixed up with this mixed up mixed up
[1:13:43] mixed up all mixtures it's just coming
[1:13:46] up and saying oh I'm a Christian oh I do
[1:13:48] I'm a Christian because I cried when I
[1:13:50] went to the altar no that's not the
[1:13:53] Bible oh I'm a Christian because they
[1:13:55] made the sign of the cross in my
[1:13:57] forehead with holy water I became a
[1:14:00] Christian then no it doesn't work that
[1:14:02] way either oh I became a Christian
[1:14:04] because I shook the superintendent's
[1:14:07] hand when he welcomed me into the
[1:14:09] fellowship yeah that's not the scripture
[1:14:11] either oh no sir oh I was a Christian
[1:14:14] long before that the moment I was
[1:14:17] baptized in the spiritual Sanctus demons
[1:14:20] businesses
[1:14:22] I became a Christian right then I didn't
[1:14:25] even know I was a Christian but I still
[1:14:27] became one because I was baptized see
[1:14:31] not the Bible because the Bible tells us
[1:14:33] baptism Jesus went down into the water
[1:14:36] then it says John the Baptist took him
[1:14:38] and put him under the water then the
[1:14:41] Bible says he coming up out of the water
[1:14:44] amen pray oh my goodness I I want to see
[1:14:48] you do that in a little baptismal thing
[1:14:50] that they usually have but the point is
[1:14:53] that everyone the devil has created such
[1:14:57] confusion
[1:14:58] he's creating so many counterfeits that
[1:15:02] has created confusion in the minds of
[1:15:04] the people you don't know in which
[1:15:06] direction to go neither do they know who
[1:15:09] to listen to but thank God God places
[1:15:12] something in the hearts of True
[1:15:14] Believers that they recognize who they
[1:15:17] are amen and the spirit of God leads
[1:15:21] them and guides them praise God that we
[1:15:23] walk in the light of this day and of
[1:15:26] this hour by the Holy Spirit Hallelujah
[1:15:29] listen amen a day that can't be damned
[1:15:33] night Smoky clothing there's been enough
[1:15:37] light on the gospel and still they
[1:15:39] wouldn't believe the Lord and be saved

[1:16:41] my attention right there not just
[1:16:44] pouring out his Spirit as in Pentecost
[1:16:47] but now is the hour when he is pouring
[1:16:50] out sunlight

[1:17:35] this a little bit more is that okay

[1:17:44] life
[1:17:46] another thing we will call your
[1:17:49] retention
[1:17:50] just before we close look at the light
[1:17:54] on the outside in the courts it was the
[1:17:58] firmament lit up
[1:18:00] and so forth some days what cloudy days
[1:18:04] some days the sun didn't shine at all
[1:18:07] see oh my some days it was dark that's
[1:18:12] all happened in the outer Court the next
[1:18:16] court amen was the lamp of God where the
[1:18:20] Justified stands amen praise God and it
[1:18:25] was lit by human hands he's talking
[1:18:27] about the seven candlesticks right that
[1:18:30] was in the inner court amen and the
[1:18:33] priests had to go light those amen you
[1:18:36] know the representation of that the
[1:18:38] seven the way back in the Old Testament
[1:18:41] cast for casting the Shadows of the
[1:18:44] seven Messengers coming the church ages
[1:18:47] and so on it was already showing itself
[1:18:49] in the Old Testament in that Tabernacle
[1:18:52] casting forth the truth of the coming of
[1:18:55] these Servants of the Living God and
[1:18:57] these seven ages of the church which
[1:18:59] were hidden from Satan under these signs
[1:19:02] and symbols that are in the word of God
[1:19:05] Amen now
[1:19:09] praise God
[1:19:11] this is where the Justified stand and it
[1:19:14] is led by human hands and that's where

[1:19:23] differences uh praise the Lord I I hope
[1:19:26] you deacons are alert and understand
[1:19:29] praise the Lord and make sure that

[1:20:01] believe Visions come from God I don't
[1:20:03] believe this I don't believe that

[1:20:32] many knows about God your lamp gets
[1:20:35] smoked up amen he knows what he's
[1:20:37] talking about because he lived poor in

[1:20:44] inside and light the top and we call
[1:20:46] those a Speak Easy lamp and so and so
[1:20:49] yeah they smoke up the place and things

[1:20:55] you call the the lampshade if you did
[1:20:58] have one of those and you put it over it
[1:20:59] it would be a little better but the
[1:21:02] shade after a while becomes smoked up
[1:21:04] Smoky and it has to be washed and
[1:21:06] cleansed before you use it again amen so

[1:22:31] you are strong praise the Lord

[1:23:01] message amen
[1:23:03] when you are weak
[1:23:05] then he is strong in weakness there is
[1:23:08] strength praise God hallelujah come
[1:23:11] coming into his divine presence amen
[1:23:14] praise the Lord now I'm not going to use
[1:23:16] all of these but uh brother the brothers
[1:23:19] have these quotes sitting in the back if
[1:23:22] you want to have a copy of them you can
[1:23:24] have them I've quoted from the hidden
[1:23:27] life I quoted from a message called
[1:23:29] Christ amen
[1:23:32] they're beautiful and I trust that you
[1:23:34] should read them don't just listen and
[1:23:37] hear me say it and forget about it amen
[1:23:39] be a blessing to your soul
[1:23:42] praise God I just want to be sure that
[1:23:45] you get this amen
[1:23:49] clearly you find out here he spoke
[1:23:52] hidden life I think I told you that and
[1:23:55] then in this
[1:23:57] yes the hidden life with Christ he
[1:24:00] preached the message more than once and
[1:24:02] once it's called The Hidden life then
[1:24:04] it's called hidden life with Christ and
[1:24:07] you should check up these but the
[1:24:09] brother has a copy of these quotations
[1:24:11] you can get a copy from him and you can
[1:24:14] read them for Yourself Praise the Lord
[1:24:17] in the court out of court holy of holies
[1:24:21] praise the Lord now when you come into
[1:24:24] the presence of the king I want you to
[1:24:27] know in the presence of the king is life
[1:24:30] is that right because when they brought
[1:24:32] Aaron's Rod now you know Aaron used to
[1:24:36] walk around with a rod
[1:24:37] that's not the walking stick but a rod
[1:24:40] and the rod was a piece of a Akia tree
[1:24:43] they cut off and you know cleaned it up
[1:24:46] and use that as a run it was dead
[1:24:49] but when they're brought that rod and
[1:24:53] left it in the presence of God overnight
[1:24:57] the Bible tells us when they come in the
[1:25:00] morning
[1:25:01] it was an almond tree story but when it
[1:25:04] came in the morning it's this side
[1:25:06] started to Blossom
[1:25:09] it started to live again that dead piece
[1:25:12] of wood amen I don't care what a dead
[1:25:15] what you were or I was but when the Holy
[1:25:19] Spirit comes on your life by the opening
[1:25:21] of the word god starts to bring life
[1:25:24] you start to bloom some of you are
[1:25:26] blooming right in front of my eyes some
[1:25:29] of you are blossoming right in front of
[1:25:30] my eyes some of you are maturing in
[1:25:33] front of my life some of you are
[1:25:34] bringing forth fruit already right in
[1:25:37] front of my eyes and I give God praise
[1:25:39] for that amen somebody say Amen
[1:25:42] accept praise the Lord let's give glory
[1:25:45] and praise to the Living God wherever
[1:25:47] you may be amen May the spirit of God
[1:25:50] bless you amen yes sir hallelujah amen
[1:25:55] Aaron's rug began budding who life is in
[1:25:59] the presence of almighty God Amen
[1:26:03] Hallelujah another thing is that they
[1:26:06] had what was called the shoe brand
[1:26:09] and the shoe bread was some of that
[1:26:12] manner that was uh made given to them
[1:26:16] and he said Gather some of that and put
[1:26:20] it in a pot
[1:26:21] and that part is to be brought and
[1:26:25] placed in the presence of the Lord
[1:26:28] amen so they brought that pot and they
[1:26:32] brought it right in the presence of
[1:26:34] almighty God Amen praise the Lord and
[1:26:38] brother sister I want you to know that a
[1:26:41] whole when they brought that pot they it
[1:26:45] never went stale
[1:26:47] it didn't go stale it remained there
[1:26:51] fresh like on the first day take God and
[1:26:55] I'm so glad that's the word that we have
[1:26:57] received here today amen because that
[1:27:00] word was in the presence of almighty God
[1:27:03] given to a prophet and now we're getting
[1:27:06] it fresh like the first day amen
[1:27:09] same word of God fresh like on the first
[1:27:12] day many many insights and things that
[1:27:15] you can see from this but you need to
[1:27:16] deal with that yourself amen never spoil
[1:27:20] Amen Let Me Tell You friends this hair
[1:27:23] will never become a denomination
[1:27:26] I don't mean this local church I'm
[1:27:29] talking about the word
[1:27:31] and as long as this local church remains
[1:27:33] with the Revelation where it can never
[1:27:35] denominate and that word will keep you
[1:27:39] that way and preserve you until the very
[1:27:41] end amen another thing is uh like any
[1:27:47] King
[1:27:48] when you come in the presence of
[1:27:51] almighty God Amen Hallelujah that you
[1:27:55] can't just come in just with emotions
[1:27:59] you just can't come in just uh you know
[1:28:03] because you're on fire therefore that's
[1:28:05] your spiritual no because in the Bible
[1:28:08] if you will search it you'll find that
[1:28:11] some
[1:28:12] um uh some men of Israel thought they
[1:28:16] could come in the presence of the Living
[1:28:17] God because the priest went in with a
[1:28:19] little censor which lots of people are
[1:28:22] trying to copy the same thing but the
[1:28:24] sensor with a little fire in it you come
[1:28:27] in the presence of God with incense and
[1:28:29] there he would do his high Priestly
[1:28:31] duties amen if he was in sin he dropped
[1:28:35] dead right there if he wasn't he
[1:28:37] wouldn't be allowed to come back out but
[1:28:40] he would go in like that but there were
[1:28:42] other men that wanted to go in the
[1:28:44] presence of God
[1:28:46] and they said he putting some fire and
[1:28:49] incense he's a man like me I put my own
[1:28:52] incense and they made up their own
[1:28:54] incense and light it up and and two of
[1:28:58] them I believe and walk into the
[1:29:00] presence of God and of course they were
[1:29:02] struck dead and God was saying you don't
[1:29:04] come in here with Strange Fire
[1:29:07] right Strange Fire look in the Bible
[1:29:10] you're going to find God Strange Fire
[1:29:13] yes you're on fire but that's a strange
[1:29:15] fire that fire don't take you to the
[1:29:18] word
[1:29:20] that fire is pointing you to a trinity
[1:29:23] that fire is pointing you to everything
[1:29:25] else but it's not pointing you to the
[1:29:28] word praise the name of the Lord
[1:29:30] hallelujah amen my brother sister I'll
[1:29:34] tell you what are we living in
[1:29:37] when we Rejoice here it's the real thing
[1:29:40] amen but a lot of them come with Strange
[1:29:43] Fire they get a convention Strange Fire
[1:29:46] all the places on fire everybody's
[1:29:49] shouting and everything else but the
[1:29:51] shout of the king what is that it's not
[1:29:53] in the camp
[1:29:55] The Cry of the king is not in the camp
[1:29:58] but yet there is noise noise why they're
[1:30:01] bowing down to a golden calf
[1:30:04] they're bowing down to a golden calf
[1:30:06] Moses not even off the mountain with the
[1:30:09] word and they're screaming and shouting
[1:30:11] well I got the word here how can it be
[1:30:13] there the same no you see Strange Fire
[1:30:16] amen so a man May preach me on fire
[1:30:19] that's not it listen
[1:30:21] watch what he's saying and let the Holy
[1:30:25] Spirit apply that to your heart unto
[1:30:27] your soul amen praise the name of the
[1:30:30] Lord amen coming into his presence of
[1:30:33] course we're talking about uh coming
[1:30:34] into the king's chamber you know that's
[1:30:37] not a way of saying you're coming into
[1:30:39] the king's chamber and uh you know to
[1:30:42] come in the king's chamber in the in the
[1:30:44] pyramid up there that they drop there
[1:30:46] you had steps to go up those seven steps
[1:30:49] to get into the king's chamber and at
[1:30:52] each step there was a guard you know
[1:30:54] type of the some Messengers there was a
[1:30:57] guard you just couldn't go in there only
[1:30:59] who were coming by invitation I thank
[1:31:02] God that we have taken those seven steps
[1:31:05] amen and now we have stepped into the
[1:31:07] little room praise God under the
[1:31:10] anointing of the Holy Spirit to meet
[1:31:12] what to meet with the King Hallelujah
[1:31:14] blessed be the name of the Lord amen yes
[1:31:18] sir how wonderful to know I'm going to
[1:31:20] start to wind some some of this up
[1:31:22] praise the Lord amen no I want to bring
[1:31:27] to your attention
[1:31:29] you must come in the king's presence and
[1:31:32] you must come with faith
[1:31:34] in that right come with faith because
[1:31:38] remember in the New Testament the woman
[1:31:41] that came and she
[1:31:44] touched the Hem of His Garment
[1:31:47] but sometimes to come to the presence of
[1:31:50] Lord you've got to come true relatives
[1:31:53] talking all kinds of stuff
[1:31:55] you got to come through crowds of people
[1:31:57] criticizing you you gotta press your way
[1:32:00] through massive of masses of unbelief
[1:32:03] and obstruction you gotta push your way
[1:32:05] right through there before you could
[1:32:08] come into His presence amen but when
[1:32:11] should come to his presence she just
[1:32:12] barely touched the Hem of His Garment
[1:32:14] now he brings her in this presence and
[1:32:17] he turns around and says who touched me
[1:32:19] and now he invites her to come into His
[1:32:22] presence oh praise God isn't it
[1:32:25] wonderful oh praise God that we have a
[1:32:28] touch from God hallelujah we touched him
[1:32:31] and he touched us and we are here today
[1:32:33] as the evidence of who we are Sons and
[1:32:36] Daughters of the Living God blessed be
[1:32:38] the name of the Lord God is good
[1:32:42] I said God is good
[1:32:45] he's a revealer of the word amen amen I
[1:32:49] want to praise God I don't care my
[1:32:51] friends what issue
[1:32:54] you may have in your life

[1:32:58] issue of blood oh my issue of blood
[1:33:03] blood life

[1:33:08] your life
[1:33:09] here today
[1:33:10] what issues Jesus it doesn't matter what
[1:33:14] issue you have what issue you're dealing
[1:33:16] with right now right now you may be
[1:33:18] dealing with an issue but regardless of
[1:33:21] what that issue is amen just Reach Out
[1:33:24] And Touch the Lord and if you touch him
[1:33:27] Hallelujah your issue will be gone the
[1:33:29] Bible says deceased instantly by the
[1:33:32] grace of almighty God God can settle
[1:33:34] every issue that comes within your your
[1:33:39] life
[1:33:40] Matthew 7 24
[1:33:43] there was a woman who had a daughter she
[1:33:47] was grievously troubled by devils
[1:33:50] and she came to Jesus when she came to
[1:33:54] Jesus to pray for him to pray and he
[1:33:57] turned around and the same gentle Jesus
[1:34:00] that people believe is so gentle
[1:34:03] he turned around and says woman is not
[1:34:06] becoming fit for me to give the
[1:34:08] children's bread to dogs
[1:34:10] you know what he did he called her a dog
[1:34:13] this is loving Jesus that usually paints
[1:34:17] so gentle is loving and kind they don't
[1:34:20] realize that with that Comfort comes
[1:34:24] correction
[1:34:25] is that right and that he is a God
[1:34:28] that's a both a dove and a screaming
[1:34:31] eagle he's a lion but yet he's a lamb
[1:34:34] depends on what he has to declare in the
[1:34:37] hour and the time that we're in praise
[1:34:40] God so here we turn
[1:34:42] does not fit together children bread to
[1:34:44] the dogs right but really he wanted
[1:34:46] reaction he wanted a reaction to the
[1:34:50] word amen sometimes we do that we talk
[1:34:53] to somebody we quote a little bit of the
[1:34:55] word or say quote from the prophet
[1:34:57] waiting for a reaction
[1:34:59] right and she said but Lord even the
[1:35:03] dogs eat some of the crumbs
[1:35:06] amen I don't I'm not asking you Lord in
[1:35:09] other words for a whole loaf I'm not
[1:35:11] asking for the whole thing just just
[1:35:13] even though I can get some crumbs coming
[1:35:15] off of the Masters table amen he says oh
[1:35:19] woman great is your faith go thy way thy
[1:35:23] daughter is made whole amen and that
[1:35:26] daughter was made hold from that instant
[1:35:28] praise the Lord no matter what your
[1:35:31] situation just raise your hands Lord
[1:35:33] drop down some handfuls on purpose for
[1:35:36] me
[1:35:37] say Lord I need some crumbs here today
[1:35:41] I need a slice today here praise God
[1:35:45] Amen and your whole situation your whole
[1:35:48] life will change your relationships will
[1:35:51] change oh my praise God hallelujah amen
[1:35:55] praise the Lord
[1:35:57] um isn't that wonderful
[1:35:59] I'm thinking of Zacchaeus
[1:36:01] he wanted to come in the presence of the
[1:36:03] Lord but he couldn't come he was too
[1:36:05] short
[1:36:08] uh he wanted to come to the presence of
[1:36:12] the Lord but he found he had a complex
[1:36:15] it was a guilt complex uh and physically
[1:36:19] he was too short he had done some
[1:36:21] robbing uh and fudging figures as a tax
[1:36:27] collector and stuff like that and it was
[1:36:30] bothering his conscience and he didn't
[1:36:33] want to just come in the presence of the
[1:36:34] Lord like that so he climbed up a tree
[1:36:37] right many of us climb up trees uh you
[1:36:41] know now praise the Lord so I'm going to
[1:36:44] describe those trees somebody else could
[1:36:46] describe the various trees that you
[1:36:48] could come up down amen praise the Lord
[1:36:51] and and Jesus passed by and says
[1:36:53] Zacchaeus come down out of the tree
[1:36:56] calm down let me go home and have lunch
[1:36:59] with you here I will must eat at your
[1:37:01] house today praise God and sometimes God
[1:37:04] got to call some of us down from our
[1:37:06] high horse just like he did with Paul
[1:37:08] and knock him off the high horse take
[1:37:11] you off with a high tree and brought him
[1:37:13] down sometimes we have to do that if we
[1:37:16] want to come in the presence of God
[1:37:17] regardless of our situation whether
[1:37:20] we're down and out when we're up and
[1:37:24] away with success God calls from both
[1:37:27] sides of the spectrum and just say come
[1:37:30] on to me Ollie that labor and I have a
[1:37:33] laden I will give your rest and God
[1:37:36] calls us to Humble ourselves to have
[1:37:40] faith in his word
[1:37:42] faith in this promises trust in his
[1:37:44] grace and he will bring us True Praise
[1:37:48] the name of the Lord blessed be his
[1:37:50] wonderful and His Marvelous name praise
