[0:11] for wonderful song service Hallelujah
[0:15] knowing that the Lord is um so pleased
[0:19] with worship amen that's absolutely
[0:23] essential before you come into the
[0:25] presence of God and expect him to you
[0:28] know feed you and meet your needs and
[0:30] give you what you have Hallelujah
[0:33] worship need to get out of this
[0:35] Dimension see worship is placing him
[0:39] first that's what it's doing it's
[0:41] placing him first you know your thoughts
[0:43] all your your adoration your love your
[0:47] uh your everything that's good you place
[0:50] it all into Christ Jesus and it just
[0:54] makes everything special when you enter
[0:57] into the word of God Amen praise God
[1:00] good to be in the house of the Lord this
[1:01] morning um we are here once
[1:04] again um by the grace of God Pastor
[1:07] Simon is now starting to turn his I know
[1:10] I know the way he thinks you know he's
[1:12] starting to turn you know the bolts
[1:15] moving in a certain direction and you
[1:16] know the things around him are what they
[1:19] are but uh I know you know he's only got
[1:21] a few days left and so he's already
[1:23] starting to turn his thoughts towards
[1:27] his home his ministry and his children
[1:29] amen and so continue to keep him in
[1:31] prayer that the Lord will just give him
[1:34] what he needs and strengthen him so that
[1:35] he can come back and be what God wants
[1:38] him to be amen amen praise God and so uh
[1:42] we stand here this morning by his grace
[1:45] by uh you know a thought and an
[1:47] inspiration that he laid upon my heart
[1:50] and uh you know I just when when they
[1:53] come I just write the things down I just
[1:56] kind of put it together the best that I
[1:58] possibly can but then it takes the Holy
[2:00] Spirit and you know that you know that
[2:02] if you if you you know you've been born
[2:04] again by the spirit of God you did not
[2:08] just join this church you did not just
[2:10] decide that you oh I think you know I
[2:12] live in a community so maybe I should
[2:15] belong to a church or you know you
[2:17] didn't just happen to choose because I
[2:20] know a lot of you you know um in your
[2:23] human thinking you've gone through a lot
[2:26] of struggles and a lot of battles when
[2:28] it comes to serving God under the under
[2:31] the revealed word for this day because
[2:33] it separates you it makes you different
[2:36] it gives you a different standard it
[2:38] makes you talk different it makes you
[2:40] walk different it makes you change the
[2:42] way that you were a lot of us we had to
[2:44] do a complete
[2:46] 360 amen a lot of our friends became our
[2:50] enemies because we did a 360 we didn't
[2:53] understand but it was God it's God's
[2:56] election it's God's time it's God's
[2:58] calling amen so um this morning we're
[3:02] going to be looking into the word of God
[3:05] slide one you can put that up and our
[3:08] thought today
[3:10] is who do you see in the
[3:13] mirror kind of strange right but who do
[3:17] you see in the mirror you
[3:19] know SL
[3:21] to
[3:23] you look in the mirror and say oh boy
[3:25] that's a handsome
[3:27] D or you might look in the mirr and say
[3:30] my God I'm getting
[3:31] old or you might look into the mirror
[3:34] and you might see things that that you
[3:36] know that that that you wish you had it
[3:38] changed or you know you look back at
[3:40] your life and you start to reflect back
[3:43] on the circumstances of your life and
[3:46] you look at a lot of different things
[3:48] and you know you you you might see
[3:50] things that you wish you could have been
[3:52] you might see things that you wish you
[3:54] hadn't done you could look back and
[3:56] you're looking in the mirror because
[3:58] when you're looking in the mirror you
[4:00] you're you're looking at yourself and
[4:01] you're wondering wow you know what would
[4:04] I have been or you know if I had have
[4:06] taken this road and then sometimes you
[4:08] might think wow if God hadn't intervened
[4:11] I wouldn't even be looking in the mirror
[4:12] right now that's
[4:15] right I wouldn't even got to that
[4:20] age you know you need to realize who you
[4:24] really are and what it is that God is
[4:29] doing in this this day and in this hour
[4:31] when you look into that mirror you know
[4:33] you want to you want to be able to see
[4:35] the right reflection you want to see
[4:38] goals and vision of where it is that
[4:41] you're headed and what it is that you
[4:43] want to do and what you want to
[4:44] accomplish here in this life you know um
[4:48] brother brandham spoke one time about a
[4:51] young boy that uh you know went to visit
[4:57] with his aunt you know in Kentucky and
[5:00] you know she had a big house and this
[5:01] boy he was you know I'm just going to
[5:03] paraphrase it and just kind of you know
[5:05] highlight it um but he said that you
[5:08] know uh this young boy he never really
[5:10] saw himself he didn't see himself at all
[5:14] and one day he went to his aunts and you
[5:16] know she kind of uh had a big mirror
[5:18] there from top to bottom and brother
[5:20] Brandon is talking about where he's
[5:22] talking about it's it's from the message
[5:23] three kinds of Believers and he says
[5:25] when you look into that mirror what do
[5:27] you see he saw him self he saw hey
[5:31] that's me but then where did he stand
[5:35] where he and this is the thought that
[5:36] brother Brown was bringing where do you
[5:38] see yourself would you have stood with
[5:40] Jesus you looking in that mirror this
[5:42] morning are you somebody that you could
[5:44] say I'm standing with Jesus I'm standing
[5:47] with the word of God or you one that's
[5:50] kind of you know you know you're you're
[5:51] always covering up some of you sisters
[5:53] you know you want to cover up this cover
[5:55] up that you know still using a little
[5:57] bit of makeup here and you know like
[5:59] trying trying to hide whatever it is you
[6:01] know because because something is you
[6:03] know is is in your in your character
[6:06] that maybe you're trying to hide or
[6:07] something that you're but you can't hide
[6:09] with God you can't be a make believer
[6:11] with God not if you've been born again
[6:14] there's just no way you could do it am
[6:17] amen and so you know he's talking about
[6:19] it in that way and we want to be able to
[6:22] look into the mirror of our lives next
[6:25] slide and so we're going to read from
[6:27] our scripture
[6:32] Jeremiah
[6:36] 1 4
[6:42] to8 then the word of the Lord came unto
[6:45] me saying be before I formed thee in the
[6:48] belly I knew thee and before thou camest
[6:52] forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee
[6:57] and I ordained thee a prophet unto the
[7:01] Nations then said I ah Lord God behold I
[7:05] cannot speak for I am a child I am a
[7:09] child this is what you know sometimes we
[7:12] don't see that we're growing that we're
[7:16] maturing but the Lord said unto me say
[7:20] not I am a child for Thou shalt go to
[7:23] all that I shall send thee and
[7:26] whatsoever I command thee thou shalt
[7:35] speak be not afraid of their faces for I
[7:40] am with thee to deliver thee sayeth the
[7:43] Lord let us pray
[7:46] father we thank you this morning Lord
[7:49] that Lord this is not something that we
[7:52] thought we would do or that we would
[7:55] join that we would just become a member
[7:58] of Lord but this this is a high calling
[8:00] this is this is something that took
[8:02] place from before the foundations of the
[8:05] world and so we want to see it in the
[8:07] right context this morning and Lord as
[8:09] we look into the mirror of Our Lives we
[8:11] want to see right we want to see things
[8:14] the way that you see them Father because
[8:17] that's what's going to make everything
[8:19] completely different from this day on if
[8:23] we can receive what you have for us
[8:25] today and I know that this is
[8:27] inspiration that you planted in my heart
[8:30] father if we can receive it today if the
[8:32] people can open their hearts and open
[8:35] their lives and and just be honest and
[8:37] know that you're here and that you're
[8:39] willing to change transform and do great
[8:42] things for each and every one of us Lord
[8:44] we can leave this place different than
[8:46] the way we came in and Lord that's what
[8:49] we place into your hands this morning
[8:51] anoint the speaker anoint the hear
[8:53] father in the name of Jesus Christ and
[8:56] Lord remember our pastor bring him
[8:58] safely him and sister desire protect
[9:01] them guide them watch over them Lord
[9:04] remember all those that are sick and
[9:05] Afflicted that could not be here
[9:07] remember brother philli and his wife
[9:09] father remember oh God uh Lord all those
[9:12] that are in need this morning may you
[9:14] just touch them whether they're present
[9:16] or whether they're
[9:17] not in Jesus name we pray amen and amen
[9:21] God bless you Saints you may be
[9:28] seated the word of God is supposed to be
[9:30] in Us in this hour and you just heard
[9:34] what the scripture said that he said I
[9:36] put my word in your
[9:39] mouth regardless of how you see it
[9:42] regardless of what you think you're
[9:44] capable of regardless of where you think
[9:47] you're at the stage because we're not
[9:50] all at the same level we're walking by
[9:53] the grace of God and we're moving by his
[9:56] grace and we're led by his spirit and
[9:58] it's by faith that we do whatever it is
[10:01] that we do we need faith we can't do it
[10:03] on our own and so you need to understand
[10:06] that you need to know that it's not by
[10:08] your own ability it's because God said
[10:11] so God told Jeremiah hey I'm putting my
[10:14] word in your
[10:15] mouth he says but you know I'm not
[10:18] capable of this I can't do this he says
[10:21] regardless he says I'm going to be with
[10:24] you I'm going to watch over you I'm
[10:27] going to watch my word in other words
[10:30] because it's his word it's the attribute
[10:32] that he placed in you that gives you the
[10:34] ability to receive the word of God and
[10:37] to actually speak the things that we
[10:41] speak in this day and in this hour and
[10:44] so we can't be
[10:45] afraid to speak the word of God and I'm
[10:49] not talking about because of zeal and
[10:51] you know going out there and trying to
[10:53] be something and speaking the word of
[10:55] God in that way no it's with a life
[10:58] that's right it's with a walk amen it's
[11:01] with a revelation amen
[11:04] hallelujah slide
[11:06] four that which is perfect is come in
[11:11] Corinthians 1 Corinthians
[11:14] 13: 9 to 12 it says for we know in
[11:19] part and we prophesy in
[11:22] part but when that which is perfect has
[11:25] come then that which is in part shall be
[11:29] done away now notice what it says there
[11:33] I want you to pay attention when that
[11:35] which is perfect is come then that which
[11:39] is in part is done
[11:43] away when I was a child here we go I
[11:47] spake as a child I understood as a child
[11:53] I thought as a child but when I became a
[11:56] man I put away child
[12:00] things that's right for now we see
[12:03] through a glass Darkly but then face to
[12:06] face now I know in part but then I know
[12:12] even as also I am know I'm going to read
[12:16] to you from the Amplified version this
[12:19] very same
[12:22] scripture it says here starting in verse
[12:26] 9 for our knowledge is in fragmentary
[12:31] incomplete and imperfect and our
[12:34] prophecy our teaching is fragmentary
[12:38] incomplete and
[12:40] imperfect but when the complete and
[12:43] perfect the total comes the incomplete
[12:47] and the imperfect will vanish away
[12:50] become Antiquated void and
[12:55] superseded listen carefully now when I
[12:57] was a child I talked like a child I
[13:01] thought like a child I reasoned like a
[13:03] child now that I have become a man I am
[13:06] done with childish ways and have put
[13:09] them
[13:10] aside for now we look in a
[13:14] mirror that gives only a dim blurred
[13:17] reflection of reality as in a riddle or
[13:21] Enigma but then when Perfection comes we
[13:25] shall see in reality and face to face
[13:29] now I know in part imperfectly but then
[13:32] I shall know and understand fully and
[13:35] clearly even in the same manner as I
[13:38] have been fully and clearly known and
[13:43] understood of
[13:47] God hallelujah you mean he sees me some
[13:51] some something a little different than
[13:53] the way that I see myself in the
[13:56] mirror you mean now God now we're
[13:59] talking about God seeing from before the
[14:01] foundations of the world first of all if
[14:04] he even sees you it's because you were
[14:07] an attribute of God and you were always
[14:09] in the mind of God so for that alone you
[14:12] should be jumping up and down here this
[14:14] morning saying Glory Hallelujah
[14:16] Hallelujah Jesus that you saw me that my
[14:20] name was written there that I was
[14:22] actually there that he actually saw you
[14:25] brother gab can you imagine that when he
[14:27] saw you he saw me amen
[14:29] to God because he saw game going down
[14:32] there and then he saw me walking into
[14:33] his
[14:34] J I don't know where you all fit in but
[14:37] we all fit in somehow some way together
[14:40] amen bless the name of the Lord and I'm
[14:42] glad that he saw me and that he sees me
[14:45] in a certain way glory to God Amen it's
[14:48] it's just
[14:49] unbelievable blessed be the name of the
[14:51] Lord many people are lost in their own
[14:54] desires though that's the problem amen
[14:56] people are all caught up in their own
[14:59] Ambitions unscriptural
[15:02] things and this and this kind of like
[15:05] you know kind of brings a separation law
[15:07] between you and your destiny and what
[15:10] God's purpose is for your life amen
[15:13] striving for the things of the
[15:16] world my goodness like the prophet one
[15:19] time you know the prophet one time he
[15:21] went hunting he took his wife and his
[15:23] little child he says I'm going to get me
[15:25] a bear you guys just stay here I'm going
[15:28] to get me a couger Hallelujah going to
[15:30] put him up on my wall you see he got
[15:33] caught up too he says I'm going to go
[15:35] catch me a big bear I'm going to put
[15:36] that bear in there and oh it's going to
[15:38] look good and everything else he got so
[15:40] caught up and so carried away the
[15:41] weather changed all of a
[15:44] sudden he remembered about his wife and
[15:46] little child back there my goodness he

[22:18] things you remember that you were in
[22:21] darkness when the light
[22:23] comes you remember when he said let
[22:25] there be light you remember those things
[22:28] now you can think about those things
[22:29] because your life was in darkness you
[22:32] were void you were without form you had
[22:35] no real uh you know understanding and
[22:38] the evening light came and it began to
[22:41] shine on you that's what this word does
[22:43] It Shines on you and it starts to raise
[22:46] you up it starts to change you transform
[22:48] you amen and he separates what the
[22:51] darkness from the light so all the you
[22:53] know all of a sudden you start dressing
[22:55] different you're not wearing those many
[22:57] scripts you're not wearing those tight
[22:59] pants you're not you know all of a
[23:00] sudden you're starting to line up with
[23:01] the word of God you're starting to not
[23:03] because God says this and says that but
[23:06] because you've received his Spirit
[23:09] that's right and in you wants to to to
[23:11] give back the Revelation that you've
[23:13] received and so when a woman when she
[23:15] dresses in in a modest way it's because
[23:18] she's been humbled by the presence of
[23:20] God right and she's been humbl to know
[23:23] that God loves her God really cares
[23:26] about her that she's a part of him and
[23:29] that that just makes listen if you ever
[23:31] come to that place you know what I'm
[23:33] talking about you're just humiliated
[23:36] here you're just humbled that's why you
[23:39] repent that's why you come to that place
[23:41] where you turn your life around because
[23:43] it becomes a reality to you the darkness
[23:46] gets separated from the light your Earth
[23:49] was covered with Darkness right your
[23:52] Earth was all covered in darkness amen
[23:54] and your life was without form and void
[23:57] but the spirit of God moved upon you and
[24:00] his spoken word as you began to hear it
[24:03] and receive it transformed you oh glory
[24:07] to God through the mouth of a prophet
[24:10] amen you heard the word that was to be
[24:13] restored you needed restored word you
[24:15] couldn't just you couldn't feed on on
[24:17] the Mana that their feet that they're
[24:19] feeding not on there that's right amen
[24:21] that's why people say what you follow a
[24:24] man no no we follow the word am
[24:29] the word of the Lord came unto the
[24:33] Prophet
[24:35] Jeremiah and the word went forth it was
[24:39] the man speaking the word but it was the
[24:41] word that the people heartened to it was
[24:44] thus sayth the Lord
[24:47] hallelujah God somebody showed me one
[24:51] time where he said thus sayeth the Lord
[24:53] through all the years of his ministry
[24:55] where it did not come to
[24:57] pass 100% am oh there's a lot that will
[25:00] say oh no he made mistakes and all he
[25:03] did he said this and he said that and he
[25:05] believed this and he believed that and
[25:06] then he changed his
[25:10] mind God doesn't make
[25:13] mistakes can a man make
[25:16] mistakes I'll probably make one
[25:19] tomorrow so will
[25:21] you so don't look oh I make mistake so
[25:25] will
[25:26] you I guarantee
[25:29] but not the word of God not the
[25:32] attribute of God it cannot disbelieve
[25:34] the word of God there is no way that
[25:37] anybody can tell me that the word of God
[25:39] makes any mistakes makes any kind of
[25:42] error no sir re god is
[25:45] perfect perfect
[25:48] has feing on this morning I'm feing on
[25:52] the perfect word of God I'm feeding on
[25:54] that which has come in this day and in
[25:55] this hour because I know that that is
[25:57] going to do it that's going to translate
[26:00] me that's going to take me from this
[26:01] Dimension into that
[26:03] other oh yes sir I'm not relying on
[26:05] man's ability no Sur glory to God the
[26:09] light of the hour began to separate the
[26:13] darkness from you do you know that you
[26:14] need light for the hour that's right you
[26:17] try and go into one of those
[26:19] denominational
[26:20] churches and get what you have need of
[26:25] first of all if you're going into
[26:27] them it should only be if you're on
[26:29] vacation somewhere and you can't find
[26:32] the the word a word me
[26:38] Church
[26:40] secondly cuz you ain't born again I'm
[26:43] just going to tell it the way it
[26:46] is you're born
[26:49] again well you know what I'm getting you
[26:51] know people tell me they leave this
[26:53] church they go to Pentecostal they go to
[26:54] a Reformed Church and this and that I
[26:57] ain't going to say a word
[26:59] because I can't give
[27:01] Revelation only God gives Revelation on
[27:04] his word it just shows that hey it's not
[27:06] their time or it may never be I don't
[27:10] know but you cannot be released
[27:16] loosed from the bondage of darkness in
[27:19] this day and in this hour without the
[27:21] Holy
[27:22] Ghost
[27:24] right but you just said the message of
[27:26] the hour yes I did because the Holy
[27:28] Ghost is the message of the hour without
[27:31] the Holy Ghost you can't see the Bible
[27:34] said Jesus said I will send you the
[27:38] comforter and he will guide you which is
[27:40] the Holy Spirit and he will guide you
[27:44] into all kinds of different churches and
[27:46] Creeds and denominational
[27:49] teachings he said the
[27:51] truth the truth it'll guide you to the
[27:55] truth and so that's the first question
[27:57] that should upon your heart what am I
[27:59] feeding on am I feeding on the truth
[28:02] that's right or am I feeding on some man
[28:04] traditional idea what they believe to be
[28:07] the truth that's right because if they
[28:08] leave brother Bram out of the formula
[28:11] it's just like leaving Moses amen just
[28:14] like leaving
[28:15] Joshua just like leaving Ezekiel and
[28:18] Elijah and every other Prophet where God
[28:22] intervened into the lives into the
[28:25] people into the Nations and turned them
[28:27] into another Direction where they could
[28:30] either meet with Joy or meet with the
[28:32] demon power that would possess their
[28:35] lives which
[28:37] one how you going to leave out the 20th
[28:40] century Prophet you can't do it it's
[28:45] impossible you may not see it right away
[28:48] but you will know to be like me I didn't
[28:51] see it right away probably about a year
[28:53] later I started to wow now I see why
[28:57] this was striking my soul now I
[29:00] understand what it was that when I
[29:01] listen to those tap I couldn't quite
[29:03] understand but it was just something
[29:05] would just happen now I see he's the
[29:08] prophet of Malachi 4 amen he's the
[29:11] prophet of Revelation 10 he's the voice
[29:13] of God in these last days to come and
[29:15] restore a church it makes sense look at
[29:18] all these 2,000 3,000 denominations how
[29:21] in the world am I going to know which is
[29:23] the truth and which is not the
[29:25] truth think about it how are you know
[29:29] how in the world were you going to say I
[29:31] know for sure I'm okay you're lost baby
[29:35] without this word without this
[29:37] Revelation you ain't been born
[29:41] again and all those old things went away
[29:43] your clothes changed your language
[29:45] changed your Ambitions went away come on
[29:48] you're you know what something began to
[29:50] Quicken the life began to penetrating
[29:52] your Earth and you started to change you
[29:55] started to become different and as you
[29:57] understand understanding is becoming
[29:59] enlightened by the word of God you're
[30:01] discovering that there's a seed in you
[30:03] and that seed is not some some seed
[30:06] that's given to every single person
[30:08] that's alive because a lot of people say
[30:10] everybody's got a
[30:12] soul not everybody's got a soul from
[30:14] before the foundations of the world that
[30:16] comes from the mind of God that is an
[30:17] attribute of God right some have souls
[30:20] that just live by it right but then they
[30:24] die that's why the Bible says and the
[30:26] soul that sin
[30:29] shall but what I I thought that Souls
[30:31] can't die I thought that souls are
[30:33] [Music]
[30:35] Eternal you know they got a teaching out
[30:37] there two Soul Doctrine whatever it is
[30:40] they need a revelation on what that
[30:42] is I got a revelation on it I hope you
[30:45] got a revelation on it amen if you've
[30:47] got a sole attribute that was placed
[30:49] from before the foundation a mind of God
[30:52] elected and placed in you when you took
[30:54] that first breath you came into this
[30:56] Dimension you you're going back to God
[31:00] you're a son or a daughter of God you
[31:01] can't you can't stop it if you tried
[31:04] because he said all that the father have
[31:06] given me they will come that's right
[31:09] glory to God and guess what the bride
[31:11] next slide they're forn they're called
[31:14] they're
[31:14] Justified and they're glorified Romans
[31:17] 8:28 says and we know that all things
[31:21] work together for good so I don't care
[31:23] where your situation is this morning I
[31:25] don't care where you're at I don't care
[31:27] if you're halfway there or quarter of
[31:29] the way there or you're you're you're
[31:31] bound up by anger or you're bound up by
[31:34] by you know by by uh uh lust and the
[31:38] things of this world regardless of that
[31:41] oh glory to God it's going to work for
[31:42] good because God's going to turn it
[31:44] around God's going to move you in the
[31:46] right direction you might be rebellious
[31:49] right
[31:51] now wa I felt something
[31:54] there you might be in a rebellious
[31:57] condition right now and you don't want
[31:58] to hearken unto the word of the Lord you
[32:00] want to go in a certain direction you
[32:03] say no this is the direction I'm going
[32:05] and I don't care poor old me I see it
[32:08] this way I don't care I'm not going to
[32:10] do this I'm not going to do that I'm
[32:12] going this way I don't care doesn't
[32:14] matter what he says doesn't matter what
[32:16] she says this is my will this is my
[32:20] what a son of a daughter of God be in
[32:23] that kind of a rebellious condition God
[32:25] help you you better repent you better
[32:28] turn to God you better look real close
[32:30] and where you're headed because if you
[32:33] don't hearken under the warnings of the
[32:35] Lord oh boy I can give you a lot of
[32:39] examples through the scriptures but we
[32:40] Hallelujah to get into that this morning
[32:43] I don't know where that came from but
[32:44] glory to God blessed be his name he says
[32:47] to them who are called according to his
[32:50] purpose for whom he did for no he also
[32:55] did predestinated to be
[33:00] position
[33:05] to that he might be the first born among
[33:08] many Brethren moreover whom he did
[33:10] predestinate them he also called and who
[33:14] he called them he also Justified and
[33:17] then who he justified he also glorified
[33:20] so you know what justification Saints
[33:23] when you come to that realization that
[33:25] you have not sinned and that you're sins
[33:28] are all washed away like we saying Oh
[33:32] Glory to God you're going to realize
[33:33] that by Revelation you never did it in
[33:35] the first place that's right because
[33:37] justification is that you never did it
[33:39] in the first place you were deceived you
[33:42] were in a deceptive condition amen but
[33:46] God turned you
[33:47] around because he forew you bless the
[33:51] name of the
[33:54] Lord taken out of him built up in his
[33:57] own image in his own likeness that's
[34:00] what he's doing right now she's she is
[34:03] light of his life that's who you are you
[34:06] got to realize that you were in him your
[34:08] life of his life you were in him your
[34:11] your your spirit of his Spirit word of
[34:14] his word you're coming into his very own
[34:17] image to be United with him he knew you
[34:21] and so he justified you that's right he
[34:24] knew you back there he also knew you
[34:26] would come into this life he also knew
[34:28] you were going to make mistakes he also
[34:30] knew you were going to go the wrong way
[34:32] he says I don't care right that's right
[34:36] she's I'm justifying her as though she
[34:43] never myself to her she's only going to
[34:46] say Thank You
[34:50] Lord bless the Jesus glory to God but
[34:55] now at the End of the Age the fullness
[34:57] of the word is
[34:58] com now we're leading into the meat here
[35:01] right the fullness of the word is
[35:04] com s Angels Came
[35:06] Down Seven Seals were ripped open those
[35:10] seals were ripped open for a purpose
[35:13] they were ripped open in a season in a
[35:15] time right at the perfect and the right
[35:18] time just when God had to reveal his
[35:21] word to call out his elected bride those
[35:24] Seven Seals were revealed bringing the
[35:26] fullness of the word remember we talked
[35:29] about that which is perfect when that
[35:32] which is perfect it when it comes let go
[35:35] of everything else Saints let go of
[35:38] it some people will let go of the word
[35:40] no no and they'll go
[35:42] fanatical and they'll take one little
[35:44] doctorine and they'll go off with it and
[35:47] they're way out in the right field
[35:49] somewhere thinking that they're that
[35:50] they're okay and they're often some
[35:53] seven sealed Doctrine saying well the
[35:55] seal ain't open the seven seal ain't
[35:57] open
[35:58] it's not open to them amen that's right
[36:00] but it's open to you amen if you've got
[36:02] a revelation to realize that that was
[36:05] the perfect word that was coming down to
[36:08] give us that which was perfect so that
[36:11] we could be perfected so that the
[36:13] fivefold ministry could actually have
[36:15] something to use glory to God they could
[36:18] have something to be anointed by they
[36:20] could have the word that was for their
[36:22] day so that they could know with
[36:25] confidence that they could that they
[36:26] could stand in their post of Duty and
[36:29] know that God was going to come down and
[36:31] back the bride he was gon to get a bride
[36:34] ready he was gonna he was going to do
[36:35] what he said he was going to do and he
[36:37] has a way of doing it he's going to Fan
[36:39] His five-fold Hand Ministry and he's
[36:41] going to he's going to get rid of all
[36:43] the wheat and put them into the Garner
[36:46] and he's going to take all the weeds and
[36:49] burn them that's right that's what the
[36:51] world is going to do amen because
[36:54] there's going to be a time of
[36:56] tribulation that's going to come upon
[36:58] Earth it's just that simple we cannot
[37:00] stop it amen when you see the word for
[37:04] your day when you see that that which is
[37:07] perfect has come it's because Redemption
[37:10] is drawing n the more you get the
[37:13] revelation of what I'm speaking on here
[37:15] this morning the more you feed on it the
[37:17] more you say amen and you receive it and
[37:20] you let it become a part of you it's
[37:22] because you are being changed it's
[37:24] because it's the season it's the time
[37:27] brother gave to go home it's the time
[37:29] sister it's the time brother to get
[37:32] ready and to put aside and Trust in the
[37:35] promises of God that he's going to do
[37:37] what he said he's Hallelujah it is not
[37:40] the will of God that we should perish
[37:42] right that's right no sir it's not his
[37:44] will that we should you know that that
[37:46] that we should be lost or that we should
[37:48] be in confusion that's not his will this
[37:50] morning it's not his will for you to be
[37:52] in a dispute it's not his will for you
[37:55] to be in in in financial
[37:58] Stress and Anxiety that's not his will
[38:02] he's here to give you deliverance from
[38:04] those
[38:09] things can receive it can can be changed
[38:13] you don't have to be under that bondage
[38:15] anymore Hallelujah glory to God he
[38:19] doesn't want you to go into tribulation
[38:21] that's right he's not going to let it
[38:22] happen there's
[38:25] way thank you Lord blessed be his name
[38:28] it's not his will he has come to take us
[38:31] out glory to God to raise us up blessed
[38:36] be his wonderful name to link us with
[38:38] our theophany glory to God because
[38:41] without that you can't go there that
[38:44] body is destined to go there to go to a
[38:47] meeting in the air blessed be the name
[38:50] of the Lord if you don't connect with
[38:52] that body you're going to miss that
[38:54] that's right
[38:56] amen
[38:58] that soul theop body it connects you
[39:00] with this world
[39:01] too but dear God it better be connected
[39:04] to God that's right it better be
[39:06] connected by Revelation amen a lot of
[39:08] people talking about the theophany a lot
[39:11] of people talking about the Rapture but
[39:13] they don't know what's really connected
[39:15] they don't know what's really involved
[39:16] in the connection they don't know that
[39:18] it's him secretly coming revealing his
[39:21] word making it plain personally
[39:24] individual individual individual he's
[39:27] giving you personal faith to know that
[39:30] he's real you haven't got to that place
[39:33] on your
[39:34] knees amen you need personal revelation
[39:36] you need personal faith and one of these
[39:39] days that body is going to pick you up
[39:42] glory to God it's going to take you out
[39:43] of this dimension in the morning in the
[39:45] twinking of an eye you are going to be
[39:47] changed and all of your burdens all of
[39:50] your mortgages

[40:25] way Pro is M it's not separated and a
[40:30] little bit here and a little bit there
[40:31] no every promise you got to stand there
[40:34] you just got to
[40:37] stand I believe it I don't care what the
[40:40] doctor said I don't care what the
[40:55] banks the word of Lord standing on that
[40:58] word because he chose
[41:01] me it was his calling amen bless the
[41:05] Lord next
[41:08] Slide the gospel is hid to them that are
[41:11] not born again it's just that simple so
[41:15] don't be trying to drive this message
[41:17] into people's minds and trying to
[41:19] convince them that they got to receive
[41:21] it because in 2 Corinthians 4: 3 it says
[41:26] but if our gospel be hid it is hid to
[41:29] them that are lost now nobody likes to
[41:33] say hey you're lost and you shouldn't be
[41:34] going out
[41:36] there all
[41:38] right now somebody comes along and
[41:41] really pushes your
[41:44] buttons still over that just
[41:50] me you got to understand you can't get
[41:54] too zealous to the point where you're
[41:56] going to force something on anybody
[41:57] because in whom the God of this world
[42:00] had blinded the minds of them which
[42:03] believe not less the light of the
[42:05] Glorious gospel of Christ who is the
[42:08] image of God should shine unto them and
[42:11] in Luke 10:21 Jesus says in that hour
[42:14] Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I
[42:17] thank thee oh
[42:19] Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that
[42:23] thou H
[42:25] has so why are you trying to rip it open
[42:29] and say no look at this is hidden you
[42:30] got to see this mystery when he hit
[42:35] it he
[42:37] opens you can speak it you can you know
[42:40] say what you can you know testify what
[42:42] God is doing let them know what you're
[42:45] seeing just like you know it was coming
[42:48] to me I'd sit there and I'd Fellowship
[42:52] my God would sit down with brother Tim
[42:54] beers and we'd sit in Fellowship all
[42:58] and I'm just sitting there and I'm just
[43:00] sucking in every word because I'm just
[43:03] I'm hearing that's me I'm hearing that's
[43:07] that's true I I just couldn't help it I
[43:09] couldn't fully understand but the word
[43:12] of God was just so real it just simply
[43:15] flowed and it just it just made perfect
[43:18] sense but that's God because he decided
[43:20] not to hide it amen he decided to reveal
[43:23] it and that's what it is Saints it's all
[43:26] about re Revelation Revelation is God
[43:29] divinely opening your understanding so
[43:32] that his thoughts can flow into you
[43:34] amen
[43:37] hallelujah that thou has hid these
[43:39] things from the wise and the prudent so
[43:41] don't think just because he's a he's a
[43:43] theologian he's got his e l d d g lbb
[43:49] g so he should go
[43:52] nope not even the
[43:56] Pope not even the
[43:59] pope not even Billy gr
[44:02] son amen only God chooses to reveal to
[44:07] whom he chooses am and has revealed them
[44:11] unto
[44:12] babes even so father for so it seems
[44:16] good in that
[44:18] sight bless the Lord what slide is that
[44:23] sister nine number nine seven Sorry
[44:26] Seven
[44:28] seven go to number
[44:31] eight God is in full
[44:35] control you remember that we're slowing
[44:38] it down a little bit then we're going to
[44:39] move again amen God is in full control
[44:43] listen what the word says that they may
[44:46] know from the rising of the Sun and from
[44:48] the West that there is none beside me I
[44:52] am the lord and there is none else I
[44:55] formed the light
[44:58] and created the darkness oh yeah he
[45:02] created the circumstances that you find
[45:04] yourself in a lot of times you wonder
[45:06] Lord why because the light's going to
[45:08] shine soon son don't worry daughter when
[45:11] when the light shines on it don't worry
[45:13] that Darkness has to fle you try to turn
[45:16] on a light in a dark room and tell me
[45:17] the darkness is still there you'd have
[45:20] to be blind and that's what it is with a
[45:22] lot of people you go there you talk to
[45:24] them you tell them about the truth which
[45:25] is the light they say I'm as blind as a
[45:28] I can't see a thing it's dark in here
[45:32] why because it's God that opens the
[45:35] understanding he created the darkness I
[45:37] make peace and I create evil I the Lord
[45:41] do all these things wow Proverbs 16:4 he
[45:46] says the Lord hath made all things for
[45:49] himself yay even the
[45:52] wicked for the day of
[45:55] evil
[45:58] the day of evil is closer than you
[46:01] think oh
[46:03] yeah but he redeemed
[46:05] us he's made us new amen he's making us
[46:10] all brand new again because he was the
[46:12] beginning of the new creation you see
[46:16] when Adam came he was the first that man
[46:19] fell by but then the second Adam came
[46:22] and he's the one that we get raised up
[46:24] by Hallelujah the first Adam all died
[46:28] Adam was the head of a fallen ruined
[46:31] creation my goodness can you imagine and
[46:35] God has to get a new creation because
[46:38] every man that came from Adam had to
[46:40] come by
[46:42] sex did you know that there's only one
[46:46] that came by the spoken word and he came
[46:48] to turn around the curse and to redeem
[46:51] us back and that was the Lord Jesus that
[46:53] came by the spoken word and how are you
[46:57] coming this morning to be redeemed
[46:59] right
[47:01] exactly I put the word in your
[47:04] mouth you confess it that Jesus Christ
[47:08] is Lord you shall be saved a lot of
[47:11] people take that and they'll say hey
[47:13] they'll go to a bum on the street say
[47:15] just confess to the
[47:16] Lord you shall be saved just confess so
[47:20] there is the possibility that that
[47:21] person genuinely would rep p and that
[47:24] they could actually be saved
[47:27] but 95% of the time I don't
[47:31] know because they continue living the
[47:33] way they live
