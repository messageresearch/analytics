TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] hello friends once again we are together again last wednesday we talked about the lovely and precious name of jesus what a wonderful name today we would love to speak on the subject of god's disappointment once again my subject today will be god's disappointment and our scripture reading is found in revelation chapter 2 verse 5 let us read from the word of god nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first love remember therefore from whence the word fallen and repent and do the first works or else i will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repent our gracious god and heavenly father we ask your blessing upon the word we pray that you will take glory and honor and praise as we surrender ourselves to your gracious leading and care in jesus name we ask it amen and amen now in our scripture we read nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first love now we understand that the holy spirit is not just speaking to the ephesian saints but he is speaking to the original saints of that entire age which lasted for a period of about 128 years now we realize this principle of history that history repeats itself and just as it was in israel that god would send his holy fire there will be a great move of god in the nation of israel and after a while through the various generations that fire will begin to die down until it passes away and there's a need for another revival they will try to many would try to uh let's say hold on to the embers of the past revival try to stalk it trying to uh blow on it and trying to have another wind passing on the uh revival that was already passed and gone and just the glowing embers are there and so they will try to do that but that revival will fade into the next now we find out that when god lights a fire wherever whoever and which in whichever age it is the principle continues on and the same process is repeated again now this principle is that god has no grandchildren that is a religious lie of the day that one could be saved by friends by being born into a christian home and i want you to know here that christianity cannot be passed on one cannot be born believing or born a christian just because one has been born into a christian home or or in a so-called christian church for christianity and genuine revelation is not passed on by natural human birth it is only given by divine revelation through divine election and choice of god god himself my friends decides to whom he will have mercy to whom he will show mercy to whom he will reveal his word to whom he will open the book of life and let that person read their name or recognize that their part is in that book of god's lamb's book of life so we have established salvation is not true natural birth it is not passed on by natural endowments and we earn we do not receive it by the will of man or by the blood of man also we see also there in the religious lie this fallacy of apostolic succession there is no such a thing as apostolic succession one has to receive that gift by god one has to be sent upon the earth as one of the five-fold ministry other than that there is no such a thing as apostolic succession that can be passed on from one dignitary to another dignitary for a hundred years 200 years 300 years whatever it is it cannot be passed on it is only by god's gift who says i made you an apostle i made you a prophet i'm the one that gifted you to be a pastor a teacher an administrator whatever that is it must be by the holy spirit and by the hand of almighty god that one is in that position so it is a totally unscriptural uh teaching to teach or to believe in such a thing as apostolic succession as exalted as it may seem as great as it may be made to appear it is nothing in the very eyes of god it is nothing i say in the eyes of god for it is a complete and total religious lie now friends if it isn't in the word it is not of god and it's against the will and purpose of god hallelujah you see it's the same problem every age starts out with genuine truly born again anointed believers anointed by the power of the holy spirit and having a clear revelation of the word for their age and over a process of time that belief that faith that revelation that was given to them we find out it starts dying out and the next generation as it was then so is it now even in this message of this hour when the next generation comes along they uh accept and believe that they have it just as much as the first generation but in actual fact the fate begins to digress it begins to degenerate and it begins my friends to drift away from the original fire inspiration anointing face of the word of god it begins to go away from the people and so friends we find that within the those believers whether in this message or not in the message they begin to develop a party spirit they begin to have their um confidences and their faith in dignitaries high-class persons personalities my friends drifting away from the aggressive and progressive original faith of the word of god it seems too crude too primitive too rough that's what we expect it needs to be uh cultured and educated and mannerly it needs to be uh theologized and it needs to have its uh systems within the message groups within the churches we're supposed to have appropriate and proper systems my friends that's the very thing that satan loves because he knows he can follow you with the system you're predictable he knows every action you're going to take time after time and he can arrest you he can defeat you can destroy you because you're acting and moving by man-made systems beautiful as they will seem wonderful as they will appear orderly as they will appear to us my friends but not like the spirit of god which what we're listed and does what it has to do and no man knows where the spirit of god is moving hallelujah and so is the true believers of the son of god of god sons and daughters they appear to be unpredictable why because they are led by the spirit of almighty god from that stage of being true believers taking on a party spirit then the next step is begin to take on man-made names whatever those religious names are they begin to take on denominational names and name themselves and are recognized by those human names which are not christian but are man made hallelujah we are born to do the will of god and not the will of man certainly friends or praise god the original fire dies down and people began to do the will of man and the will of the world rather than the will and plain and purpose of god and soon there the fervent burning desire within the hearts of believers to carry out god's plan to carry out god's message oh to let the candle be lit and run with the message that god places within the heart that fire is gone and that desire and passion that we once had to know god in his word a drifting begins to take place drifting away from listening to the voice of god's servant prophet drifting away from studying reading and meditating hours within the word of god for our day and for our time yes sir and the cry in the hearts of the people personal and individual devotion and prayer time in god's presence seeking him with a burning heart's desire to know him whom to know his life eternal in the power of the holy spirit that cry that passion that desire begins to die down and die away from the people they literally as the scripture says have to press their way in with spiritual violence to be able to break through the dark clouds of satanic oppression to be able to break out into the presence of the anointing of the holy spirit of the living god amen praise god yes sir and what happens instead of the people and the church itself being unfair with the fire of god the it begins to cool off the church begins to cool off the preacher begins to cool off the believers the people begin to cool off from the fire of god and the anointing which they once had just as it did back in ephesus so is it happening today even now while i am yet speaking people begin to get a bit formal within the very house of god no more can you have a genuine amen hallelujah praise god if you ever get into a a state like that where the spirit of the living god takes a hold of you then you are considered pentecostal emotional you're considered unbalanced in some way well i tell you maybe they were on balance in that upper room oh praise god they were up in that attic given praise and honor and glory to god and that's why they were called fan attics but i thank god that i can be one of those that went to the attic and came back out with the glory and the jew of the holy spirit resting upon one's life hallelujah blessed be this wonderful name amen and so we can begin to get a bit formal and lose our sincerity our abundant our giving over ourselves the complete and total lordship and governorship of the holy spirit that god would have the preeminence within our life and within our walk all glory to his marvelous and wonderful name we find believers beginning to think about what people think about them what onlookers think about them what the world and the other churches think about them rather than measuring themselves by the word of god to see what god thinks about them in his word yes sir people are no more careful of what god is thinking about them they're more careful about the world will talk and think and visualize about them as it was in the nation of israel the first generation on fire with the holy spirit and then like any other nation they wanted to have a king they wanted to have a visible king to lead them and to guide them in their going out and in their coming in they wanted to have a palace they wanted to have a formal place of worship wanted to have a standardized a book of beliefs and behavior oh my friends this same is happening in our day in our time the message is being cheated and watered down believers scattered running everywhere looking for what searching to have some kind of a man-made leadership they want to have a dignitary a a famous person a well-known person dignified to rule over them now they want nothing to do with no bodies they want nothing to do with as they would have called jesus or paul wayside preachers preachers that have no churches of any consequence they want nothing to do with men women men women children young people believers that appear as if they are uneducated and ordinary they want to have people so-called of quality and that's fine but let me tell you the word of god and the revelation within the heart of the believer is the most important thing so we must hold to god's unchanging hand of his word that he has delivered unto us in our day and in our time friends i believe romans chapter 12 tells us clearly verse 2 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of god oh my friends praise god forevermore we see here in god's word clearly praise his wonderful name that we ought to change our manner we ought to change the way we act the way we live and with this falling away from the genuine word and promise of the day you'll notice the way of dressing among the people began to change the standards begin to drop their attitudes begin to become different their behavior is also changed what is it they become lacks and loose and here we understand the meaning of the word or the name ephesus the meaning of the same ephesus means relaxed it means drifting oh friends when we started out on our journey we were so brisk we were so on our guard we were so fired up anointed by the holy spirit then we begin to become relaxed and we started to drift away from the original face drifting like a piece of driftwood drifting to that awesome falls where we are taken to the rapids of destruction where they we are taken away we can't really the people can hardly resist because they have become driftwood rotten to the core ready to break off from the original branch and to be swept away my friends here it is we're finding a lot of driftwood within those that claim to believe the word of god drifting away from the word of god this cycle of revival and a slow creeping spiritual death has never ceased or failed all recall the last move of god in the spirit when god moved upon men and women who dress like christians who talk like christians who walk like christian who live like christian when the church prayed all night have all night prayer meetings and when the people took to street corners with a tambourine and a guitar and giving praise and honor and glory to god now we are too high class highfalutin and that type of stuff has become now beneath us until believers literally feel ashamed to go stand by a street corner and have a street meeting they feel ashamed to go out and to talk to people about jesus christ they feel ashamed if they have a a preacher that was thrown in jail like paul many times they're ashamed to associate with a man whose name is in the mud and muck of the world because he preached the gospel gun barrel straight and the denominations hated him hated this message and wanted his head to take it away because he's striking only the correct themes and striking the fullness of the word of god but thank god for those all saints they were not ashamed of the manifestation of the holy spirit we see the satan with his systems with his power he's trying to take that out of the church matter of fact he's trying to close down the church if he can he already has it so in a minor sense but he wants to close it down completely he wants to take away manifestations of the holy spirit where you can't hardly shout praise god glory to his name and honor and worship him the way you should yes he is trying to take it all away but will stand by the truth until the crown regain yes those days when we left our old dead denominational churches and worshiped in homes and i remember those house meetings going from house to house the days of the old brush arbor meetings dinner on the ground breaking breath together giving god glory and praise oh hallelujah oh what a time renting an old school building or an old storefront i remember one of the churches the lord enabled me to start the original it was in an all broken down garage and that's all we could get stones bricks empty bottles were thrown at us for the preaching of the saith the lord we've come to get into the place we had rented men will be waiting there with two by fours and a planks oh praise god but we counted it all joy to be able to suffer in the name of the lord jesus christ oh thank god for those old saints who rejoiced in the lord praised his name and walked in the light of the word with faith and with confidence knowing that this word that was given to us is the original word is the message for the hour is the word for the day and thank god we recognize our day and the message for our day but after a while god began to bless the numbers began to grow the churches began to grow we started to get some money and so we started to build better buildings and better buildings and after a while we started to have groups singing groups choirs singing for us and of course instead of the people singing for themselves they now have singing groups singing for them and choirs singing for them and the bars were let down the goats came in and those goats began to take over because they were thinking money money money man they were taking in every possible way of how to manipulate and how to use the message to monetize themselves and to grow themselves in every possible way and not so much as for the glory of god yes they were mounting that that it's all it's for the glory of god it's for the growth of the kingdom of god but while they're saying that verbally my friends literally there were actually building up a financial material numerical kingdom for man's glory and not to the glory of god of course a few true believers will be mixed into that group but whatever it is i'm telling you of the intent at that time and saw the cry of joy began to leave from amongst the believers the freedom of the holy spirit right in the church begins to be clapped down upon until believers felt that they were under they were under control and they were not allowed to behave as the spirit of god would have them to believe to behave i'm not talking about a way out behavior but i'm talking about the holy spirit be anointing and using the believers as he would for his glory oh they began to take on the form because the fire of god was dying down and dying out and all that is left sometimes is a blackness of spiritual blindness and ignorance within the house of god and within the true church of the living god oh but thank god for the love of god because that's what happens when we begin begin to lose the love of god because the love of god is love for god and love for his people love for his word and his ways oh my and when the church lose that lose the first love that god place within their heart everything begins to go wrong first john chapter 5 verse 3 for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments let me read that again first john chapter 5 verse 3 for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments that we keep his word that we keep all of god's word and one deviation from that word one addition one subtraction my friends it changes the entire chemistry and composition of how god meant wanted his church to be amen hallelujah and then we go to church and people begin to shout begin to praise god and say that we love god and have a great emotional time and when it is over watch their walk watch their lives for action speak louder than words the day is past when you have to impress a deacon a pastor a teacher when you have to put on a pious act a religious drama of what you think a christian is in front of others that is now gone from us my friends but we should be walking in the word living in the word and having the word living in us and through us for his glory and for his honor amen yes sir we can say we love god and we have the love of god but our lives speak something else and actions as i've said speaks louder than words amen oh people of god oh people of god i hope you have not caught this ephesian spirit that would make you become relaxed and slowly begin to drift away far away oh from the original word of the living god for that falling away that relaxation my friends that drifting it begins so subtly that we can hardly feel it until we look back and realize that we are far from the shore let us then be up and careful friends with how we are living and what we are doing back to the world back to your prayer life back to your bible study back to studying the texts of the sermons and message of the word of god for this hour may the great holy spirit draw you back to your first love god says repent because i re you have left your first love the fire of god when you first received the message by revelation the desire the passion that god placed within that soul that god has within you oh praise god amen friends let's not open up the way for human reason to come in human understanding we have to have everything completely totally explained logically reasonably to us before we can believe oh praise god hallelujah lord of god let's go back friends back to pentecost i'm not talking about the modern pentecost back to acts 2 4 pentecost back to the original one that your apostles have if we cry out to god and say lord give me what those apostles have give me what paul had give me the revelation of the fellowship of the mystery that paul had i want that revelation i want that kind of a blessing upon my heart and in my life for the glory of god of course most folk even though i'm stan i'm speaking the word of god here tonight most people don't heed god's warning they don't take it seriously and sincerely the revival fire of god that was built up upon the sacred words of this day and of this hour the manifestation of the holy spirit that was experienced within the hearts of believers all blessed quietness the sacredness of the holy spirit moved upon the believers they would spend hours times in the presence of the living god but after a while the world creeps in busyness creeps in after a while fear creeps in and and then the devil begins to whisper within the hearts of the believer how can we protect this truth this revelation that we have received what can we do to see this message revival goes on and on and on and then the antichrist spirit comes in and whispers now look you've got the message you've got the truth you've got the revelation let's try our best to see that it doesn't get lost so therefore let's let's take it let's put it into into various systems and pathways and cans and let's make sure that we have it oh my friends organize let's let's even set up some sort of a standardized booklet of beliefs and fundamentals of what true believers ought to believe and rest their faith upon and then they begin to put it into church manuals and i won't be surprised if that doesn't start coming out uh soon if not there already amounts believers we stand for this we stand for that we believe this we believe that and we hold to this and and then put it like that and begin to have it in an organized form of beliefs and by doing that they add to the word and take away from the word and then the church dies just like eve died when she listened to satan's whisper in her ear and accepted his lie of his word for taking one wrong word will take you away from god and it's only god's word that brings life friends it's not what we say about the word but what god says about his own word for god is his own interpreter and he will make it plain may god help us may god not may we live lives that god will not be disappointed in us disappointed in his church but can god place his confidence in you may god bless you my friends may the holy spirit walk with you talk with you and go with you we'll come back again next week and we'll speak on another lesson in the seven church ages we want to touch on the topic of the warning of god god's warning to his people and let us go there my friends we want to talk about about god warning about the coming of those nicholasian believers and how they will come upon in the church and begin to dominate uncontrolled for god has already told us that if we don't listen to his word he'll take away his messenger and then he will begin to take away those faithful gospel shepherds that once were there we will be left with shepherds all right but you're left with shepherds that drift away from the word of god amen let's heed the warning of god let's heed the word of god let's heed the spirit of god and let let us not let the lamps go out and complete and total darkness descend but you shine your light in your corner and i'll do the same in mine may god bless you we'll meet again next wednesday when we will speak on the topic of nicolaitanism may god bless you real good [Music] you
