[8:58] [Music]
[9:17] hallelujah
[9:23] i sing that song with
[9:26] such a conviction this morning
[9:32] this week i lost a friend
[9:36] and
[9:37] it was we grew up in a message together
[9:41] young kids
[9:43] probably was two years old when we came
[9:45] to the lord
[9:47] and uh we're in that age where
[9:51] jesus was coming in 1977 so take your
[9:53] kids out to school
[9:55] you know a lot of legalism
[9:57] [Music]
[9:59] and
[10:00] over the years i haven't spoken to him
[10:01] for 30 something years in my heart
[10:04] three weeks ago because i was talking to
[10:06] another friend
[10:08] and i didn't follow up
[10:10] [Music]
[10:12] physically i see pictures of him and i
[10:13] hear stuff and it's like he had gone the
[10:15] wrong way so when i heard he had passed
[10:17] away heart attack 52 years old
[10:19] the first thing i thought was lord just
[10:21] remember him this morning
[10:23] but i was talking to
[10:26] brother simon on thursday and the bible
[10:29] still paid those
[10:30] who have watched over your soul
[10:33] and he said brother i told him the story
[10:35] he says brother
[10:37] physically he might not be
[10:39] his heart god watches the heart
[10:42] and that has been such a blessing to me
[10:46] even looking at my life and seeing
[10:49] physically praying for my wife i'm
[10:51] praying for your husband praying for my
[10:53] kids
[10:55] don't watch the condition
[10:57] watch that person in
[10:59] so let's sing that song with that
[11:00] different mentality

[11:28] we will do

[11:51] hallelujah he says where twos and threes
[11:54] are guarded in his name he's there in
[11:56] the midst
[11:57] so he's here this morning

[12:01] just bring it before the lord knowing
[12:03] that there's a finished work
[12:05] they promised
[12:06] but abraham talked about the inheritance
[12:08] this his inheritance my bible is in here
[12:10] in my ipad inheritance the inheritance
[12:13] says
[12:15] you
[12:17] believe in husband sanctify the wife
[12:20] you and your household will be saved

[37:17] before me we want to thank and praise
[37:19] god for that
[37:21] today we'd like to speak on the topic of
[37:27] the messenger from heaven
[37:30] the messenger from heaven
[37:32] and that of course will come from
[37:35] revelation chapter 10
[37:38] verses 1
[37:40] reading to verse 7
[37:42] amen and we'll talk about this
[37:45] for a while
[37:47] and may the lord bless us
[37:49] because what i'm
[37:51] simply
[37:52] trying to show or will show
[37:57] is
[37:59] that
[37:59] the
[38:01] seventh
[38:02] messenger brother branham
[38:06] finishes his work
[38:08] and
[38:10] then
[38:11] another messenger comes down
[38:14] and it's in the word of god
[38:16] i know because of not having heard
[38:20] anybody saying things like this it'll
[38:22] sound like if it's way out way off but
[38:25] search the scriptures
[38:27] search the message search the word it's
[38:31] nothing out there somewhere it's right
[38:33] in the word i'll give you some of the
[38:36] quotations
[38:37] and you can follow it up i can't give
[38:40] you a whole a
[38:42] ton of them
[38:44] like i have in front of me here because
[38:46] i'm not going to uh quote all of them to
[38:49] you
[38:50] but um they're there
[38:52] but
[38:53] they will only see when it is time for
[38:56] them to see
[38:57] it's not that they weren't there they
[38:59] were there all the time
[39:01] but but
[39:02] you could be reading them over a
[39:03] thousand times but you only see when god
[39:07] wants you to see
[39:09] right
[39:10] and the r has come
[39:13] when god is allowing us to see him in
[39:17] the word
[39:19] and i feel blessed
[39:22] by the
[39:23] presence of the holy spirit of almighty
[39:26] god
[39:27] that he has opened my eyes and is
[39:31] opening my eyes
[39:32] to the word
[39:34] that i might bring the word of god to
[39:36] you
[39:37] and it's an individual thing now
[39:40] where every one
[39:42] has to weigh the word not take it
[39:45] because i say it
[39:47] not because i'm the pastor not because
[39:50] i'm quoting from brother branham it is
[39:53] you
[39:54] with the holy spirit
[39:57] that has to take this word
[39:59] and weigh it because we can bring no one
[40:03] in

[40:07] by yourself

[40:17] is the word
[40:19] to go into the next dimension is the
[40:22] word
[40:23] going to the third fullest the word
[40:26] the holy spirit opens the word and takes
[40:30] you through the portals
[40:32] into the presence of almighty god
[40:34] hallelujah father we thank you
[40:38] for thy word today

[41:06] you revelation 10
[41:09] 1
[41:11] 2
[41:12] 7.
[41:15] and i saw
[41:17] another mighty angel come down from
[41:21] heaven close it with a cloud
[41:24] and the rainbow was upon his head and
[41:28] his face was as it were the sun
[41:31] and his feet
[41:33] us
[41:34] pillars of fire
[41:36] and he had in his hand
[41:38] a little book
[41:40] open
[41:42] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[41:46] and his left foot
[41:48] on the earth and cried with a loud voice
[41:52] as when a lion roared and when he had
[41:56] cried
[41:57] seven thunders uttered their voices
[42:01] and when the seven standards had uttered
[42:03] their voices i was about to write and i
[42:06] heard a voice
[42:08] amen from heaven saying unto me seal up
[42:13] these
[42:14] things amen
[42:17] which the seven thunders uttered
[42:22] and write them not
[42:25] whatever the seven thunders uttered
[42:28] were not to be written
[42:30] did to be revealed
[42:32] did it be understood
[42:35] by the people of god it is not an
[42:38] addition to the word
[42:40] it's nothing it's the very word
[42:43] but back to its original form not
[42:46] writing
[42:47] but revelation
[42:50] right praise god because we speak i'm
[42:53] speaking now and you can write it down
[42:55] but that's just a representation of my
[42:58] words that i'm speaking now
[43:01] right so for you to get my words you got
[43:04] to hear it again but me saying it and
[43:07] then you get the real thing but praise
[43:10] god hallelujah and the angel which is
[43:13] i saw stand up on the scene upon the
[43:16] earth lifted up his hand to heaven
[43:20] and swear by him that liveth forever and
[43:23] ever who created heaven and the things
[43:25] that they were in earth and the things
[43:27] that are therein and the sea and the
[43:29] things which are therein that there
[43:31] should be time no longer
[43:34] but in the days
[43:36] of the voice of the seventh angel
[43:39] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[43:43] of god should be finished as he had
[43:46] declared to his servants
[43:48] the prophets hallelujah amen praise god
[43:53] you know the rest of it and how that
[43:55] book was then given to john
[43:58] and john had to eat it
[44:00] right praise god that's another thing
[44:03] again all together oh my and when when
[44:06] john at it it was sweet in his mouth
[44:10] but the reactions that he would get from
[44:12] people around him and
[44:14] everywhere was bitter in his belly now
[44:17] what he's got to go through for that
[44:19] word praise god the lord bless you real
[44:22] god please be seated you know i remember
[44:25] in the early days
[44:28] when
[44:29] i had just come
[44:32] praise the lord
[44:34] to
[44:35] the
[44:36] united states and to canada
[44:39] in actual fact
[44:40] because of the holy spirit as a young
[44:43] man uh
[44:45] uh you know just
[44:46] 18 years old preaching the word and
[44:49] revival breaking out and churches coming
[44:53] up
[44:54] and i was in the
[44:56] west coast
[44:58] of our country
[45:00] where i met my wife
[45:02] and um by the way one of the preachers
[45:07] early converts when i was just a
[45:09] teenager that got converted and stayed
[45:12] faithful and has a church
[45:15] still operating there
[45:17] just
[45:18] went to his reward just a few days ago
[45:22] left and went to be with the lord
[45:25] and
[45:27] during that time
[45:29] ministering the word of god
[45:31] is when a brother joseph coleman
[45:35] out of new york city
[45:38] i never met him he had never met me
[45:40] but he heard
[45:42] of the moving of the holy spirit
[45:46] and the power and presence of god
[45:50] and so
[45:51] he just sent a ticket
[45:53] invited me to come up to his church at
[45:55] that time he was not preaching or
[45:57] teaching anything like thunders or
[45:59] nothing of the sort just preaching the
[46:02] prophet and the message of the prophet
[46:05] as it is
[46:06] and then
[46:07] uh came up there and that's when i
[46:10] preached around the united states went
[46:12] down to perry green and go up on the
[46:15] mountain where the angels met the
[46:17] prophet he took me up there the words
[46:20] eagle were still written in the rock and
[46:24] white courts
[46:25] it was there it was so sacred to us we
[46:28] would not dig it out or touch it or
[46:31] anything of that nature
[46:33] now when i go back it's gone
[46:36] it dug it out the the tree cornered
[46:38] rocks were scattered around the ground
[46:40] and everything else you can pick them up
[46:42] if you wanted but it was so sacred to us
[46:45] we would not pick them up touch them
[46:48] oh they're all gone
[46:50] until the person that owned that side of
[46:53] the mountain actually blocked it and
[46:56] stopped anybody from going back up
[46:58] because they were carrying away
[46:59] everything possibly to maybe create a
[47:02] shrine at home or something in their
[47:05] backyard whatever i don't know
[47:08] but that's what happened
[47:10] but then i you know i went back and i
[47:13] came back here
[47:15] and
[47:16] uh to canada
[47:18] and then while i was here preaching the
[47:20] word of god
[47:22] uh it came to pass that
[47:25] the holy spirit began to break on me
[47:29] because one morning showing to me in the
[47:31] word of god
[47:33] have you received the holy ghost since
[47:36] you believed but he continued this
[47:39] message
[47:41] have you received the holy ghost since
[47:45] you believed
[47:46] this message
[47:48] no
[47:49] i being a pentecostal and speaking in
[47:53] towns and by the way i still do
[47:56] if the holy spirit needs to do that um
[47:59] and
[48:01] of course that was strange but i already
[48:03] got the holy ghost
[48:04] yes but the question keeps going blue
[48:07] through the mind and burning at you have
[48:10] you received the holy ghost since you
[48:12] believed this message
[48:14] in other words yes you might have gotten
[48:17] it over there
[48:18] but that's for there have you received
[48:20] the holy ghost since you believed this
[48:23] message
[48:24] amen hallelujah
[48:26] then of course it starts breaking that
[48:29] means
[48:30] you must be born again
[48:33] you're telling me i wasn't born again
[48:35] when i was back there in pentecost and i
[48:38] have to be born again here and then the
[48:41] words start to open
[48:44] no man was responsible for that nobody
[48:47] nothing
[48:49] i was accosted i was called names
[48:53] everything else
[48:55] the church i had in in toronto broke to
[48:59] pieces
[49:00] parts of it are still alive today
[49:03] but my goodness at that time
[49:06] word went back to
[49:09] brother coleman who was now preaching
[49:11] the seven thunders and i was there with
[49:14] him when he started and
[49:16] was right there along with it but one
[49:19] day
[49:20] going up to one of his meetings on a bus
[49:24] i started falling asleep and that same
[49:26] boy spoke the first and spoke again
[49:30] genesis 1 11
[49:33] every seed shall bring forth after its
[49:35] kind
[49:36] whose kind are you going to be his or
[49:40] mine
[49:41] and of course i'm still like
[49:43] unconsciously saying well yours lord
[49:46] and then of course i
[49:48] i i woke up in a shock
[49:50] my who am i talking to nobody is around
[49:55] but then i realized now you got to move
[49:58] away from that thing even though you
[50:00] don't see nothing yet
[50:03] nothing yet is showing
[50:05] but the holy spirit tell me no step step
[50:07] away from it
[50:09] you listen to what i'm going to tell you
[50:11] but you step away from and i stepped
[50:14] away from it
[50:16] before anything shoe before end there
[50:19] was any details and all the people got
[50:22] mad
[50:23] everything to come against me like i
[50:27] said the church going to pieces and
[50:29] different ones like that you know will
[50:32] of course make it short it's years later
[50:35] everybody believes that
[50:38] now everybody believes that now
[50:42] you know
[50:43] and more than that i was so discouraged
[50:47] and and wondering could it be that how
[50:50] could i how could this be right and and
[50:53] and
[50:54] you know
[50:55] all these brothers preaching that and
[50:58] i'm going to come say something like
[50:59] this but then again
[51:02] i go into
[51:04] whether vision or dream
[51:06] and
[51:08] while i'm like that i saw myself
[51:11] preaching
[51:12] preaching preaching preaching the word
[51:14] and the congregation
[51:16] and
[51:18] in the middle of the congregation all of
[51:19] a sudden i saw brother branham
[51:23] sitting in the congregation
[51:25] and when i saw him of course i got
[51:27] self-conscious right
[51:29] and he could sense it so he stood up
[51:33] and he said are those things
[51:35] that you are preaching are they found in
[51:38] the bible
[51:39] and i said yes sir and while he's saying
[51:41] that he got up and he walked right up
[51:44] came to the pulpit
[51:47] and he looked at my notes
[51:49] and he looked at the scripture that i
[51:51] had open
[51:52] and he said they are found in the bible
[51:56] continue preaching it
[51:58] i've done that from that until now
[52:02] and i'm still preaching it
[52:08] i never seen the man in the flesh
[52:11] never seen him never met him never heard
[52:15] him
[52:16] but i've seen him and met him in the
[52:18] spirit
[52:19] more than once
[52:21] and i want to thank god
[52:24] that he's the same yesterday today and
[52:26] forever i realized what i'm saying
[52:28] anybody could say they see this they see
[52:30] that they heard this and they heard that
[52:32] and make up something uh
[52:34] to you know but
[52:36] let me tell you the holy spirit
[52:39] will bear record to the word
[52:42] he will bear record of whatever you say
[52:45] if you stay by the word
[52:47] hallelujah praise god and
[52:51] we come to this hour now
[52:53] when
[52:54] brother anybody could say what do they
[52:57] want their voices all around you
[52:59] carrying on and everything else
[53:01] but until god takes his own word and
[53:05] vindicates that thing you don't know
[53:08] anything until god himself does it
[53:12] so praise god and
[53:14] you know from since preaching about the
[53:17] eternal church age
[53:20] it's just like a week now but already
[53:22] being called false
[53:24] called you don't know what you're
[53:25] talking about
[53:27] uh you know this that the other all
[53:29] kinds of names but the fact is brother
[53:32] sister just learned jesus was on the
[53:34] earth the bible said they marked his
[53:38] mouth
[53:40] and then the holy spirit said you know
[53:41] what that mean i never understood i was
[53:43] quoting even that but i didn't
[53:45] understand but he said you know what
[53:47] that was he said it was the scribes
[53:52] and whatever he said they were writing
[53:54] it down
[53:56] so that they can catch him
[53:59] later on if he says something else
[54:02] i never even understood that
[54:05] but the holy spirit said that's what it
[54:07] was so you see it's good now don't get
[54:10] nervous now about note-taking
[54:13] i didn't say that for you to get nervous
[54:15] and don't take notes
[54:16] you see what he was pointing at is the
[54:19] motivation of why you're taking the
[54:21] notes
[54:23] right like brother branham said
[54:25] they're listening but they're listening
[54:27] with ears to debate
[54:29] and for strife
[54:31] and things of that nature but let's
[54:33] listen that we might receive the word of
[54:36] god and growing it and be fed by him the
[54:40] great holy spirit okay
[54:42] so let's go forth in the name of the
[54:45] lord and see what god has in store for
[54:49] us messenger from heaven praise god well
[54:54] um uh just to get to the point you
[54:56] realize the scripture already tell your
[54:58] plane who's the messenger from heaven
[55:01] is that right
[55:02] because it didn't say
[55:04] william branham will descend with a
[55:06] shout out
[55:08] no
[55:09] william branham was only a part of the
[55:11] lord's descent
[55:13] the lord himself
[55:16] is the messenger from heaven
[55:19] the lord himself
[55:21] will descend with a shout with the voice
[55:24] of the archangel with the trump of god
[55:27] and the threefold is the fullness of
[55:30] that mighty angel of god
[55:33] that came down according to the word
[55:36] and is made known to us we read
[55:39] different scriptures and to connect them
[55:41] together on the stand that is the same
[55:44] god hallelujah now let me give you
[55:46] quotations so that you just don't think
[55:49] i'm saying these things of myself listen
[55:53] brother branham speaking sirs is this
[55:56] the end uh the sign of the end
[56:00] he said now remember the capstone
[56:04] was never interpreted
[56:08] these seven angels
[56:11] in the constellation
[56:13] came to me

[56:29] made in a form
[56:32] of three on the side
[56:34] and one on top
[56:35] and they all drop
[56:38] down from eternity
[56:41] is this the mystery of the thunders
[56:44] what will bring back the headstone
[56:48] you know

[56:51] has never
[56:52] been kept

[57:45] of them seven church ages

[57:51] it up
[57:52] to a certain point of it
[57:56] right
[57:57] but in the seventh hour the seventh
[57:59] messenger all these mysteries

[59:40] their voices from the angel
[59:43] remember do you know who this is
[59:46] do you know who this is
[59:49] when them seven thunders uttered up
[59:52] their voices

[1:00:01] time

[1:00:55] christ

[1:02:11] his ministry is doing exactly what john
[1:02:14] the baptist ministry did
[1:02:16] it introduced christ as great

[1:02:21] the scripture says none was greater than
[1:02:24] john
[1:02:25] amongst all the preachers prophet
[1:02:27] ministers and so none greater than this
[1:02:31] messenger of this 20th century but then
[1:02:34] he says here but even that

[1:03:29] i'm preaching on messenger from heaven
[1:03:33] the other seven angels
[1:03:36] of them seven church ages
[1:03:40] they were only earthly messengers
[1:03:44] but this angel
[1:03:46] remember at that time
[1:03:49] all the message is finished
[1:03:54] all the message is finished at that time
[1:03:58] the seventh angel
[1:04:01] has winds up the entire thing the whole
[1:04:05] thing is wound up
[1:04:07] but this angel comes now
[1:04:10] not from the earth
[1:04:13] for he isn't a man from the earth
[1:04:16] as the messengers were to the seven
[1:04:20] church ages
[1:04:21] that is finished
[1:04:25] this angel
[1:04:28] brings to you
[1:04:29] the next announcement

[1:04:40] or praise god
[1:04:42] and this one
[1:04:44] comes not from earth
[1:04:46] but he comes from heaven
[1:04:49] messenger from heaven
[1:04:52] clawed in the pillar of light
[1:04:55] cloud with rainbow over his head

[1:05:06] christ with one foot on the land on the
[1:05:10] sea and swore time will be no more so
[1:05:14] this messenger from heaven is the mighty
[1:05:16] angel and this mighty angel is the
[1:05:18] covenant angel and this covenant angel
[1:05:21] he said is none other than the lord
[1:05:23] jesus christ himself amen
[1:05:26] hallelujah where are we at sirs
[1:05:30] think of it remember
[1:05:32] remember what i say
[1:05:34] the other angels were messengers they
[1:05:39] were only men of the earth
[1:05:43] but these angels
[1:05:46] amen
[1:05:48] this angel that said
[1:05:51] to the angel of the church of laodicea
[1:05:54] to the angel of the church of ephesus
[1:05:57] see
[1:05:58] to them messengers of earth them were
[1:06:01] men messengers prophets and so forth but
[1:06:06] this angel says to these angels to the
[1:06:11] angel of such and the angel of such an
[1:06:13] angel of such amen praise god which is
[1:06:16] the lord jesus christ who hold the seven
[1:06:18] stars in his hands and then he turns
[1:06:20] around and says to the angel of the
[1:06:23] church of so and so he reveals the word
[1:06:27] but this one
[1:06:30] continuing the same quote
[1:06:33] as did not come from the earth
[1:06:36] he come down from heaven
[1:06:39] because the mystery is already finished
[1:06:43] at that time
[1:06:44] oh my glory god
[1:06:47] when this mystery is finished
[1:06:50] then the angel says time shall be no
[1:06:53] more
[1:06:55] that's when
[1:06:56] the seven thunders
[1:06:59] throw their voices out
[1:07:01] amen the seventh thunders come into
[1:07:05] force and begin to be uttered praise god
[1:07:09] hallelujah amen oh my what
[1:07:13] what if it is something
[1:07:16] to let us know
[1:07:19] or that's going to be revealed to let
[1:07:21] you know
[1:07:23] how to enter into that rapturing
[1:07:26] faith that rapture revelation
[1:07:30] will we
[1:07:31] run and jump over walls
[1:07:35] hey man is there something to fixing to
[1:07:38] happen
[1:07:39] these old mind vile bodies are going to
[1:07:42] be changed
[1:07:44] oh god can i live to see it oh lord it's
[1:07:48] so close
[1:07:49] that i'll see it it is this the
[1:07:52] generation oh my sirs my brethren what
[1:07:57] time is it we where are we at praise god
[1:08:02] is this the sign of the end 1962 that's
[1:08:05] brother branham speaking
[1:08:07] the voice of the mighty angel
[1:08:10] seven thunders came out of him
[1:08:13] uttering their voices hallelujah
[1:08:16] and then the holy spirit is telling me
[1:08:19] telling us
[1:08:20] that
[1:08:21] the voice of the seventh angel is still
[1:08:24] there all the ages they go out they go
[1:08:28] out
[1:08:28] you know like that parallel to each
[1:08:31] other but then officially the next one
[1:08:33] is is announced while the others are
[1:08:36] continuing
[1:08:38] another one is announced and it just
[1:08:40] goes right on out so the voice of the
[1:08:42] mighty angel is still there of the
[1:08:44] seventh angel is still there we the
[1:08:47] message is still here right but remember
[1:08:51] that he spoke through the seventh angel
[1:08:55] and he was the voice of god
[1:08:58] speaking to these church ages and to
[1:09:01] this last church age
[1:09:04] but now
[1:09:05] what comes out to the mighty angel seven
[1:09:08] thunders blasts and their voices come
[1:09:11] forth lord of god he's what this is not
[1:09:14] the quote from brother branham i'm just
[1:09:16] about to say and he said
[1:09:18] this is not
[1:09:19] the voice coming true brother branham
[1:09:22] anymore this is the voice of many waters
[1:09:25] through my bride hallelujah
[1:09:27] that's the voice now come to the bride
[1:09:30] the seven thunders in the bride he's
[1:09:32] thundering through her amen and there
[1:09:35] become the living voices to the word of
[1:09:38] god for this hour amen that's where the
[1:09:42] sinner will find himself my friends in
[1:09:46] real trouble praise god because to speak
[1:09:50] against this amen they commit them the
[1:09:53] unpardonable sin for not recognizing who
[1:09:56] is speaking and whose word it is and not
[1:10:00] recognizing the god of the hour praise
[1:10:03] god jesus christ the same yesterday and
[1:10:06] forever time shall be no more the seven
[1:10:10] thunders utter their voices
[1:10:13] hallelujah and now those thunders are
[1:10:15] where in the bride
[1:10:18] and when those in other words the seven
[1:10:21] thunders the voice of the mighty angel
[1:10:24] it's now speaking through his own bride
[1:10:29] his many member body
[1:10:32] and therefore as he said they hear
[1:10:34] thousands of voices voices voices but
[1:10:38] living voices amen brother branham said
[1:10:41] all like a great cataract he says like
[1:10:44] the thundering of many waters hallelujah
[1:10:48] why is the voices of the elected bride
[1:10:51] of jesus christ speaking with the voice
[1:10:54] of the thunder of the mighty angel of
[1:10:57] god the messenger from heaven speaking
[1:11:00] through her and giving god the glory the
[1:11:02] honor and the praise
[1:11:04] hallelujah
[1:11:06] oh praise god amen the pyramid then
[1:11:11] when
[1:11:12] that
[1:11:13] when he announces that
[1:11:16] that time is no more
[1:11:19] what happens when he does that
[1:11:22] oh my
[1:11:24] that
[1:11:25] then is when
[1:11:27] when the pyramid is kept
[1:11:31] by the seven thunders
[1:11:34] the seven thunders
[1:11:36] coming through the bride
[1:11:38] is the capping of all the ages right
[1:11:42] into the eternal church age
[1:11:45] amen you remember my pyramid message
[1:11:49] i'll tell you where this is found it's
[1:11:50] still in the sign of the answer so be
[1:11:53] good if you go back read that book he
[1:11:55] said remember the pyramid message it's
[1:11:58] the capstone the holy spirit in there
[1:12:02] capped off the individual and as i said
[1:12:05] to you last week or the week before this
[1:12:07] was not just speaking of the individual
[1:12:09] which uh we most of us including me
[1:12:12] understood understood it to be the
[1:12:14] individual man or woman like us uh
[1:12:18] adding virtue adding patients he was
[1:12:20] speaking of the stature of the perfect
[1:12:23] man the only perfect man we know of
[1:12:25] jesus christ himself
[1:12:28] amen
[1:12:29] that's the only perfect man
[1:12:32] and through the church ages them virtues
[1:12:34] are being added to the image so you can
[1:12:36] get a clearer picture of the entire
[1:12:39] image and each church is represented of
[1:12:42] virtue
[1:12:43] it exercise of virtue hallelujah and
[1:12:46] therefore at the end of the church ages
[1:12:48] now we have a clear picture of the
[1:12:51] fullness of the character of jesus
[1:12:53] christ in the world
[1:12:56] hallelujah praise god amen so this
[1:13:00] nonsense about you adding this and
[1:13:02] adding that you can't add nothing no man
[1:13:04] he said by taking thought can add one
[1:13:07] cubit to his statue
[1:13:10] you can't add it
[1:13:12] amen hallelujah glory to god the holy
[1:13:15] spirit does that work amen
[1:13:18] think of it
[1:13:20] all them things were kept off in that
[1:13:23] individual
[1:13:25] but
[1:13:26] it's the capstone
[1:13:28] the pyramid message
[1:13:30] the seventh one that's one now comes
[1:13:34] and when that one comes
[1:13:36] that is the love of god
[1:13:40] hallelujah what is the capstone
[1:13:43] love
[1:13:44] so what is the virtue and if you want to
[1:13:47] call it that
[1:13:49] that is going to be emphasized in the
[1:13:51] hearts of the believers in this age
[1:13:54] it's love
[1:13:55] and what is love love is the totality of
[1:13:59] all the rest of them virtues
[1:14:01] when you put them all together and you
[1:14:03] add them all together you make them into
[1:14:05] one it all goes right into love
[1:14:08] right because if a person has love they
[1:14:11] have all those things within them
[1:14:14] by the grace of god hallelujah amen oh
[1:14:18] praise god
[1:14:20] now
[1:14:21] he's got seven church ages
[1:14:24] seven mysteries sounded and now the
[1:14:27] headstone comes to cap off the church
[1:14:32] praise god
[1:14:33] amen
[1:14:35] what a picture
[1:14:37] now i'm going to say something here now
[1:14:39] that's going to be another little
[1:14:40] controversial something
[1:14:43] but then the holy spirit is showing up
[1:14:45] bringing all these things because there
[1:14:47] will know when it's time for them to
[1:14:49] know
[1:14:51] amen
[1:14:52] hallelujah
[1:14:53] do you remember
[1:14:55] if you can remember or pull out danielle
[1:14:59] and the revelation
[1:15:02] and show from scripture
[1:15:04] the way the gentile church is brought in
[1:15:09] and how
[1:15:10] she is going out
[1:15:13] let me give you the quotations and then
[1:15:15] i'll talk questions and answers 1954
[1:15:19] questions and answers and then brother
[1:15:21] branham speak questions and answers on
[1:15:23] the seals
[1:15:24] again he speaks there and basically what
[1:15:28] he's saying just as it was with danielle
[1:15:31] in babylon
[1:15:33] this land of confusion
[1:15:35] danielle came he said to straighten
[1:15:37] things out
[1:15:39] and by vision
[1:15:40] god was able to reveal and use daniel to
[1:15:44] get the kingdom in order
[1:15:47] right
[1:15:48] he said that's how it came in he said
[1:15:51] he'll go out in the same way
[1:15:54] because king nebuchadnezzar
[1:15:57] so
[1:15:59] revered danielle
[1:16:01] then yet he could see that the spirit of
[1:16:04] god lived in daniel
[1:16:07] and so he changed danielle's name and
[1:16:09] called him belshazza
[1:16:11] now belshazza was actually
[1:16:14] his god
[1:16:16] amen
[1:16:18] and when i started to look at this oh my
[1:16:21] he so that nebuchadnezzar
[1:16:24] started to worship
[1:16:27] danielle as his god
[1:16:30] and the prophet is saying that was one
[1:16:32] of the signs of the going out of the
[1:16:35] gentile dispensation
[1:16:38] when they started to worship daniel
[1:16:42] as their god
[1:16:44] i want you to see here
[1:16:46] let me give you this quotation he saw
[1:16:49] the image
[1:16:51] and he believed danielle
[1:16:53] nebuchadnezzar that daniel was a holy
[1:16:56] man
[1:16:57] and he called daniel holy
[1:17:00] then he called him belshazza
[1:17:03] amen which was his idol
[1:17:07] that idol he made an image his god right
[1:17:12] oh
[1:17:13] danielle's but danielle's god now if
[1:17:18] probably the image
[1:17:20] you see
[1:17:21] of that of a holy man now
[1:17:24] some great statue they'll make and
[1:17:26] everybody wants to bow down to that
[1:17:29] statue
[1:17:30] right of some holy man
[1:17:33] oh my now remember
[1:17:36] while nebuchadnezzar was doing all of
[1:17:38] this and not that danielle didn't know
[1:17:40] but listen what he says here but notice
[1:17:43] during those times danielle
[1:17:46] was silent
[1:17:48] god didn't allow him to speak
[1:17:51] and daniel was silent
[1:17:54] and nebuchadnezzar was permitted to go
[1:17:56] ahead and build big idol
[1:17:59] and have
[1:18:00] millions of his people worshiping the
[1:18:02] idol right
[1:18:04] remember what i say
[1:18:06] oh i hope you are getting this
[1:18:10] danielle could do nothing danielle
[1:18:13] had to be silent
[1:18:15] see
[1:18:16] letting them go on
[1:18:18] because at that time
[1:18:20] now listen this
[1:18:22] they have to make their own choice
[1:18:29] amen
[1:18:30] i'm not
[1:18:32] making things up questions and answers
[1:18:34] book 1 1954.
[1:18:37] he says here
[1:18:39] you see
[1:18:41] everyone will have to make their own
[1:18:45] choice do you believe that
[1:18:48] amen
[1:18:50] in that day
[1:18:52] remember i'm saying it in the going out
[1:18:55] of the gentile dispensation
[1:18:58] there will be an image
[1:19:01] and everybody will have to bow before
[1:19:05] this image
[1:19:06] or
[1:19:07] do worship to that image
[1:19:11] though but let me do it be as holy as
[1:19:13] ever
[1:19:15] remember you are not to worship any
[1:19:19] image
[1:19:20] any image worship
[1:19:22] whatsoever
[1:19:24] my
[1:19:25] think of it
[1:19:27] bowing to an image
[1:19:29] remember i say to you again who that
[1:19:32] image was made to
[1:19:34] the image it was danielle
[1:19:38] it was the image
[1:19:40] of a man
[1:19:42] see
[1:19:43] then i want you to notice he says
[1:19:46] danielle
[1:19:48] is off the scene
[1:19:50] at that time in other words he's not
[1:19:53] there in the room when all this or
[1:19:55] stuff is discussed with the king and his
[1:19:57] people amen do you get what i mean when
[1:20:01] i say danielle is off the scene at that
[1:20:05] time
[1:20:06] do you get what he's saying here
[1:20:09] the prophet isn't on the scene anymore
[1:20:11] and that's the time they're going to
[1:20:12] start take this holy man and start to
[1:20:15] make an idol of him becomes your idol
[1:20:19] and start to make an image
[1:20:22] of him amen
[1:20:25] and ever whoever
[1:20:27] that would be at that
[1:20:31] would not bow to that image
[1:20:34] amen and if they don't they will be cut
[1:20:38] to pieces of some of us already getting
[1:20:40] cut to pieces
[1:20:45] crawl into the lion's den
[1:20:48] or they'll burn you in a fairy furnace
[1:20:51] or some other form of
[1:20:53] punishment but remember the gentle
[1:20:56] dispensation began like that with a
[1:21:00] pagan form of some form of religious
[1:21:04] worship
[1:21:05] with a persecution to make them bow
[1:21:09] and the bible predicts
[1:21:12] it will end the same way
[1:21:16] amen
[1:21:17] some holy man
[1:21:19] now friends could it be
[1:21:22] that the catholics while brother branham
[1:21:24] here was on earth and was ministering
[1:21:26] the word that even the pope and in the
[1:21:30] catholic digest
[1:21:32] i don't know where i could get a copy of
[1:21:34] that old one from back there where it
[1:21:37] says that man william branham sent from
[1:21:40] god the very ground that his feet
[1:21:43] touches and that he walks on is holy
[1:21:47] that is what they wrote in the catholic
[1:21:49] digest
[1:21:50] that's how much they respected him
[1:21:53] that's why even the catholic priests
[1:21:55] would come to him
[1:21:57] could it be just like he said
[1:22:01] they killed joan of arc kill all the
[1:22:03] prophets called him this patrick columba
[1:22:06] this one that one and long after they're
[1:22:08] gone and they realize what really that
[1:22:11] was
[1:22:12] he said they turn around and make an
[1:22:14] image to them and garnish their tombs
[1:22:16] and then call them great and give them a
[1:22:18] great name could that be that we are
[1:22:21] right now on the brink of that kind of
[1:22:23] thing happening
[1:22:25] watch let's now watch with spiritual
[1:22:27] ears
[1:22:28] watch with spiritual eyes and see
[1:22:31] whether the mother will do it or the
[1:22:33] daughters are going to do it
[1:22:35] but
[1:22:36] somewhere somehow people already start
[1:22:39] worshiping that idol
[1:22:41] let me repeat
[1:22:43] people are already worshipping that idol
[1:22:48] we recognize the job that the prophet of
[1:22:51] god has done and his message is doing
[1:22:55] amen but he is not my idol
[1:22:59] i said he is not my idol
[1:23:02] oh praise god the only image that i
[1:23:05] carry in my heart and in my head is the
[1:23:08] image of jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:23:12] today and forever
[1:23:14] oh praise god i love the prophet
[1:23:19] i respect and reverence the prophet
[1:23:23] right now brother sister look i've been
[1:23:25] blessed
[1:23:26] hallelujah
[1:23:28] i've been blessed i've been in the house
[1:23:30] of brother
[1:23:32] um
[1:23:34] fandla
[1:23:35] and turner rangan says oh brother uh the
[1:23:39] brother branham said
[1:23:41] someone would come to my house and when
[1:23:42] they said these words give them this
[1:23:45] letter which he gave me later praise god
[1:23:48] another time i was not a place i'm there
[1:23:52] i went in the home of an older brother
[1:23:54] my wife and i in in phoenix arizona and
[1:23:58] he says oh brother he says
[1:24:00] you know um i have a jar here it's
[1:24:05] filled with stones
[1:24:07] that brother branham himself selected
[1:24:10] when he's up in the mountains he
[1:24:12] selected those stones and and put them
[1:24:14] in a jar and the proper the man who was
[1:24:18] his guide i took care of him until the
[1:24:20] day he died and he left me this
[1:24:23] and his clothing and so on and he says
[1:24:26] what i want you to do is just shut your
[1:24:29] eyes take your hands put it in the jar
[1:24:31] and grab as many stones as you can grab
[1:24:34] a hold of
[1:24:35] and take that well i didn't make a
[1:24:38] particular effort to grab a whole lot
[1:24:40] but
[1:24:41] well some people would have but i just
[1:24:43] put my hand and grabbed a normal my hand
[1:24:45] full which is a small hand and i filled
[1:24:48] them in a little bottle of that size
[1:24:49] which i have at home now if i were to
[1:24:52] start taking all these little things
[1:24:55] that that might have been given or i
[1:24:57] collected or told and start making up a
[1:25:00] magazine and building up us this and
[1:25:03] that and the other
[1:25:04] that that's about me
[1:25:08] but i hide those things i don't want it
[1:25:10] about me and the first thing is the
[1:25:13] first time i mentioned that to one
[1:25:15] person
[1:25:17] they take it and spread it out and the
[1:25:20] devil used that thing to make it sound
[1:25:23] like you're trying to make yourself into
[1:25:25] something so
[1:25:26] i know enough to shut down
[1:25:30] right
[1:25:30] shut down
[1:25:32] and let the holy spirit have his way i
[1:25:34] wouldn't even tell you about others but
[1:25:36] just leave that alone praise god i just
[1:25:40] want you to see remember brothers back
[1:25:42] to the word here
[1:25:43] remember
[1:25:46] that god
[1:25:47] amen sent an elijah
[1:25:52] hallelujah and this mighty elijah god
[1:25:56] will send to us too
[1:25:59] amen
[1:26:01] and elijah delivered the people at that
[1:26:04] time out of the hands of paganism are
[1:26:06] you with me here

[1:26:11] want you to listen close and receive
[1:26:13] this praise the lord hallelujah
[1:26:16] remember
[1:26:18] out of the hands of paganism
[1:26:20] and john had to do the same things you
[1:26:24] see
[1:26:25] john
[1:26:26] when he seen jesus immediately he
[1:26:30] announced
[1:26:31] i must decrease
[1:26:34] that he might increase
[1:26:37] of course those who had john as their
[1:26:39] idols they continue following john
[1:26:43] are you following what i'm saying
[1:26:45] and the ones who could look away and see
[1:26:49] jesus they followed jesus the bible said
[1:26:52] and they followed john no more but they
[1:26:55] followed after jesus
[1:26:57] [Applause]
[1:26:59] praise god hallelujah that doesn't mean
[1:27:02] that disrespected john they didn't want
[1:27:04] to hear what john said
[1:27:06] but they knew that the emphasis was now
[1:27:10] christ the living word the word made
[1:27:13] flesh
[1:27:14] amen yes praise god you see
[1:27:19] john started preaching
[1:27:22] but at that time he was making himself
[1:27:26] known
[1:27:27] to the people just before
[1:27:30] the coming of the lord oh my right
[1:27:35] at the end before the manifestation
[1:27:39] and he stops there in that thought now
[1:27:43] we find out what elijah must mean to
[1:27:46] this church and this church age
[1:27:49] amen
[1:27:50] elijah after he had given his prophecy
[1:27:54] he had not he did not have to die he was
[1:27:57] translated into heaven type of the
[1:27:59] church
[1:28:00] and so on church will go in the rapture

[1:28:06] one that's to come will be the anointed
[1:28:08] elijah prophesied for the last day amen
[1:28:13] i think he will be the angel messenger
[1:28:16] of the last church age
[1:28:20] brother branham speaking amen hallelujah
[1:28:23] see praise god
[1:28:26] amen and when he comes
[1:28:29] it comes to a dejected degraded people
[1:28:32] as the church will be at that time
[1:28:36] amen so he will come you'll find that in
[1:28:40] the leodysian church age now he's
[1:28:42] speaking again remember always
[1:28:45] god
[1:28:47] in simplicity
[1:28:49] god always
[1:28:51] hides and works
[1:28:54] in simplicity
[1:28:56] oh my another place he says look
[1:28:59] god comes so simple so that if you're
[1:29:02] not really watching it'll pass right in
[1:29:05] front of you
[1:29:07] and you won't even recognize it
[1:29:09] you won't even see it you won't know
[1:29:11] what it is

[1:29:19] them believe it so you believe
[1:29:21] no this thing has come down to the
[1:29:24] horned out edge
[1:29:27] the holdout razor edge of the pyramid
[1:29:31] where it's an
[1:29:33] individual affair

[1:29:59] that

[1:30:32] they have to survive on me they got to
[1:30:36] eat on me the bread of life hallelujah
[1:30:39] hallelujah it's not my responsibility to
[1:30:42] save you not my responsibility to
[1:30:45] convince you convert you or anything

[1:34:33] that is in your midst you don't see him
[1:34:36] you don't even see him hallelujah they
[1:34:39] are of this message the messenger is to
[1:34:42] introduce that person and knows he is
[1:34:45] here
[1:34:46] praise god
[1:34:48] one that is in your very midst
[1:34:51] but you can't see him with these eyes
[1:34:54] but he said this thing's passing through
[1:34:55] the room you can't see but when it's
[1:34:58] time for you to see you're going to see

[1:35:15] said behold he is here
[1:35:19] there is the lamb of god that takes away
[1:35:22] the sins of the world
[1:35:24] and my time is up now

[1:35:34] 1963
[1:35:38] my time is now up now he introduces to
[1:35:42] the lamb of god

[1:35:50] i have
[1:35:52] introduced you to him
[1:35:56] and so i must now decrease
[1:36:02] i must go off the sea now
[1:36:06] and he will take it over from here
[1:36:12] messenger from heaven
[1:36:15] i said the messenger from heaven
[1:36:17] the lord himself descend with a shout
[1:36:21] voice of the archangel the trump of god

[1:37:02] he's repeating it in a message called
[1:37:04] influence
[1:37:06] amen
[1:37:08] so that he might increase
[1:37:11] for god can't have two of us on the
[1:37:14] earth at the same time
[1:37:18] one has the message
[1:37:22] and you know

[1:37:49] i've been
[1:37:50] up to this time
[1:37:52] the messenger

[1:37:56] he takes my place
[1:38:00] as elisha when elisha went up throw back
[1:38:04] his robe to elisha
[1:38:06] now elijah's ministry was finished
[1:38:11] elisha must take up where he left off
[1:38:14] so i say
[1:38:16] he must increase
[1:38:19] that i might decrease
[1:38:22] you see changed it around now
[1:38:24] when you caught the revelation
[1:38:26] he must increase
[1:38:29] that i might decrease
[1:38:32] because in your eyes you start seeing
[1:38:34] jesus
[1:38:36] you start seeing jesus
[1:38:38] hallelujah
[1:38:39] and he decreases do you respect him you
[1:38:42] love him and you all of that you realize
[1:38:45] his position his placing his work his
[1:38:48] office amen his reward but you realize

[1:39:01] side lord of god i say it's heaven time
[1:39:04] now
[1:39:05] jamaican will say it's party time now
[1:39:08] but a christian you say it's heaven time
[1:39:10] now
[1:39:11] oh praise god time for rejoicing walk in
[1:39:15] the light as he is in the light amen
[1:39:17] praise god
[1:39:20] you realize he says that is in the book
[1:39:23] the message called influence he said
[1:39:25] jesus
[1:39:26] calling out the elect amen hallelujah
[1:39:30] john was only used to call out the elect
[1:39:33] and giving them over or pointing them to
[1:39:37] christ when he come swapped his church
[1:39:42] and said i must decrease
[1:39:46] amen
[1:39:47] he must increase
[1:39:49] because i
[1:39:50] am just a voice
[1:39:53] right
[1:39:54] i was crying in the wilderness
[1:39:57] prepare ye the way of the word of the
[1:40:00] lord
[1:40:02] jesus comes the same way
[1:40:05] gets elected ready to hear
[1:40:08] the voice of god
[1:40:10] that's what the prophetic sign came to
[1:40:14] do
[1:40:15] voice of the sign 1964
[1:40:18] praise god if you're spiritual you'll
[1:40:21] catch what i am saying may god open up
[1:40:25] your understanding oh how long this has
[1:40:29] been may he open up your understanding
[1:40:33] praise god oh my now i've told many of
[1:40:37] you a priestess in the church here a
[1:40:39] little bit but now i found where brother
[1:40:41] branham is saying it in the word because
[1:40:43] it's time for me to find it now
[1:40:47] for remember what i'm telling you now
[1:40:50] for 400 years
[1:40:53] israel
[1:40:54] was without a prophet
[1:40:57] without a prophet
[1:40:59] you remember
[1:41:00] i told you
[1:41:02] about um
[1:41:04] the tunnel period
[1:41:06] that between the ages the time of
[1:41:09] malachi
[1:41:10] and matthew
[1:41:12] is a period of 400 years
[1:41:16] according to quality theologians
[1:41:19] whatever
[1:41:20] um
[1:41:22] it's a period of 400 years
[1:41:24] it is called the tunnel period
[1:41:27] it is called an initial dark ages for
[1:41:30] israel and they call it dark ages for
[1:41:32] israel there was no prophet
[1:41:36] there's no visions being given or
[1:41:39] received
[1:41:40] no light
[1:41:41] that's why when jesus come he said the
[1:41:43] people who had sat in darkness
[1:41:46] and now
[1:41:47] can have a great light
[1:41:49] you see because for that 400 years they
[1:41:52] were walking in total darkness
[1:41:55] spiritually there was none
[1:41:58] and during that time
[1:42:00] the only thing they were holding on to
[1:42:03] is the promise of elijah from eight
[1:42:05] hundred years before
[1:42:08] that a virgin will conceive on their son
[1:42:12] right
[1:42:12] and he will be the messiah
[1:42:15] but during this 400 years while they
[1:42:18] were waiting for the messiah to come
[1:42:20] that's similar to during this period
[1:42:22] brother branham has gone to rest
[1:42:25] and we're waiting for jesus to come and
[1:42:27] the rapture to take place
[1:42:29] all of a sudden men start to
[1:42:32] uh
[1:42:33] the sense
[1:42:35] the coming of the messiah
[1:42:37] but when they sense it they start
[1:42:40] thinking that maybe why i sense it maybe
[1:42:42] i am here
[1:42:45] so you had men
[1:42:47] you're not going to read that in the
[1:42:49] bible but if you go back in the
[1:42:50] histories you go back and read certain
[1:42:53] things you'll find that
[1:42:55] men like sadius
[1:42:57] men like the maccabees
[1:43:00] were raising up and thinking that they
[1:43:02] were the messiahs
[1:43:04] and that they would be the deliverers of
[1:43:06] israel
[1:43:08] but a lot of them were going with wars
[1:43:10] against the romans and the greeks and
[1:43:11] the different ones of that time and they
[1:43:15] failed with what they were doing because
[1:43:17] god didn't say delivered by a general
[1:43:20] he said a virgin shall conceive and bear
[1:43:22] a son
[1:43:23] and instead so a baby was born not a
[1:43:25] general right he was the general but
[1:43:28] born in the form of a baby
[1:43:31] now i'm saying that to say the same
[1:43:32] thing has happened and is happening
[1:43:35] during this time
[1:43:36] between brother branham's departure
[1:43:40] and
[1:43:41] the rapture coming of christ
[1:43:44] i remember i say rapture coming of
[1:43:46] christ
[1:43:47] right between this period of time
[1:43:51] no prophet
[1:43:53] none of that
[1:43:54] what happens men start to raise up and
[1:43:56] think maybe they are the messenger
[1:43:59] maybe they are the one that got the word
[1:44:04] maybe there the deliverer and just like
[1:44:07] you had tadius and maccabeas and judas
[1:44:10] and different ones judas the hammer
[1:44:12] wasn't you know like that coming up
[1:44:14] during that time we have this one come
[1:44:17] up with this this will come up with the
[1:44:19] other thing lead off a bunch of people
[1:44:21] run after them run after them instead of
[1:44:23] keeping their eyes on the word of god
[1:44:26] is that right
[1:44:27] keep your eyes on the word of god and
[1:44:30] that means that even if
[1:44:32] and god from bit this is not going to
[1:44:34] happen maybe maybe 25 30 years from now
[1:44:39] but i am not here
[1:44:41] i want you to keep looking at the world
[1:44:45] keep your eyes on the world remember
[1:44:48] you're not here following me
[1:44:51] is that right
[1:44:53] you know that
[1:44:55] praise the lord i know a lot of people
[1:44:56] think that brother simon always appears
[1:44:58] like he's not concerned about the people
[1:45:00] he's not concerned or run after there
[1:45:02] run over there chase after no it's not
[1:45:05] that
[1:45:06] you have to learn that this thing has
[1:45:09] now come to the stage where it's
[1:45:10] individual
[1:45:12] you're going to stand or fall on your
[1:45:15] own faith
[1:45:16] you're not going in with pastor's faith
[1:45:19] not my brother not my sister not the
[1:45:21] deacon not the trustee not nobody gonna
[1:45:24] take you in you've got to go in by
[1:45:26] yourself by revelation through the word
[1:45:29] of god
[1:45:31] hallelujah praise god you think my
[1:45:34] standing up here and say your pride
[1:45:43] that doesn't turn you into bride
[1:45:45] but that makes the preacher popular
[1:45:47] because people love to hear that
[1:45:51] preacher preaches to preach to all the
[1:45:53] people
[1:45:54] and give them the assumption that they
[1:45:56] are all in the bride because they're in
[1:45:58] the message and you're not in the bride
[1:46:00] because you're in the net of the message
[1:46:04] hallelujah the holy spirit is now
[1:46:06] sorting things out
[1:46:08] is that right and all god's gifts
[1:46:12] are finding their appropriate places
[1:46:16] but for the spirit of judas the bible
[1:46:19] said
[1:46:20] but there was no place found for him
[1:46:24] and he went out
[1:46:26] nobody didn't have to tell him to leave
[1:46:28] the church or get out or do this nobody
[1:46:31] didn't have to catch him doing nothing
[1:46:32] wrong the bible says he went out and
[1:46:34] hanged his own self
[1:46:37] and a lot of believers will hang their
[1:46:39] own selves
[1:46:41] by their own actions their own thoughts
[1:46:43] their own deeds and whatever they are
[1:46:46] going to be doing at this time oh my
[1:46:50] praise god hallelujah brother sister i
[1:46:54] want to thank god that during this
[1:46:56] period of time the holy spirit has

[1:47:04] praise god i'm going to take it anyhow

[1:47:34] messengers of the seven church ages
[1:47:38] came
[1:47:39] to the church ages
[1:47:41] but this
[1:47:43] messenger from heaven
[1:47:45] doesn't come to the church ages
[1:47:48] for the bride has already been called
[1:47:52] and is being called out of the church
[1:47:55] ages

[1:48:17] out hallelujah and these seven
[1:48:19] messengers that repeat were men of earth
[1:48:22] and of time but the messenger from
[1:48:25] heaven is the lord himself from heaven

[1:50:08] amen
[1:50:10] i've told this
[1:50:12] and i tell it again
[1:50:14] while in school
[1:50:16] while in college or university
[1:50:19] praise god
[1:50:20] the funny thing about this i was
[1:50:22] preparing this message yesterday and in
[1:50:25] the middle of preparing this message
[1:50:26] yesterday my youngest brother calls me
[1:50:29] from new york he said oh john i don't
[1:50:32] know i was reading the word and i caught
[1:50:34] the revelation i caught the revelation
[1:50:37] you know what i said what is it he said
[1:50:39] you know
[1:50:40] i am seeing now
[1:50:42] that
[1:50:43] now is not about the prophet
[1:50:46] but this angel that came down
[1:50:50] this mighty angel
[1:50:53] that's the one brother branham did his
[1:50:56] work i said is that right oh praise god
[1:50:59] he said oh
[1:51:00] he said i'm telling you i don't know
[1:51:02] what's happening but i'm just seeing it
[1:51:04] here i said well god bless you i said
[1:51:07] that is the truth that's the word of god
[1:51:10] i didn't tell him what i was going to
[1:51:11] preach on or what i was going to say i
[1:51:14] don't want to give no way nothing to the
[1:51:16] devil or give me give the devil any hint
[1:51:19] of anything i just let him go on talking
[1:51:22] but i was rejoicing god confirming to me
[1:51:25] that's what you need to say amen praise
[1:51:29] god because here's somebody doesn't even
[1:51:31] know
[1:51:32] amen and calls you up and begins telling
[1:51:35] you so here is this yeah the young man
[1:51:39] and
[1:51:41] sister farida
[1:51:43] the young man sees
[1:51:46] he sees somebody that he loves
[1:51:50] in the classes
[1:51:51] sees somebody that he loves brother mike
[1:51:54] did you see anybody anyway let's not get
[1:51:57] personal now
[1:51:59] i'm forgetting myself and start to get
[1:52:01] personal but
[1:52:04] then what he does
[1:52:06] he writes a note
[1:52:08] and he pass it under the desk give it to
[1:52:10] a friend pass it to another friend and
[1:52:13] pass it to another messenger and pass it
[1:52:16] to another messenger
[1:52:18] until it gets to her
[1:52:20] and then she reads the message
[1:52:22] and when she reads the message maybe
[1:52:24] she'll look around and give him a little
[1:52:26] glance or something
[1:52:28] and
[1:52:29] you know be not satisfied with just a
[1:52:31] glance and keep sending messages but
[1:52:34] then after a while he get a message that
[1:52:36] give him such assurance
[1:52:38] amen that both of them are feeling the
[1:52:40] same way about one another
[1:52:44] and when that happens
[1:52:46] he stops sending any messages by any
[1:52:49] messenger
[1:52:51] now he's going to approach her himself
[1:52:54] he's going to talk to her
[1:52:57] is going to tell her what is in heart
[1:53:00] himself
[1:53:01] praise god and nobody else needs to be
[1:53:04] there because this is an individual
[1:53:07] private rendezvous a private
[1:53:10] get-together an invisible union praise
[1:53:14] god a oneness when they come together
[1:53:17] with the word of the living god i'm
[1:53:19] telling you about jesus christ and the
[1:53:21] bride amen
[1:53:22] you seven messengers through seven
[1:53:24] church ages but the rs come when the
[1:53:28] messenger from heaven praise god you can
[1:53:31] take this and run with it the boss's son
[1:53:33] hallelujah
[1:53:35] has come on the scene to talk to us
[1:53:38] himself and open up his word the author
[1:53:42] to reveal what he was saying in the
[1:53:45] letter amen praise god i was reminded by
[1:53:48] a believer last week oh brother you
[1:53:51] could have thrown in that part where you
[1:53:53] know the husband and the wife and when
[1:53:55] the husband writes a letter amen and the
[1:53:58] wife reads that she don't have to read
[1:54:00] the writing
[1:54:02] that's part of it she reads between the
[1:54:04] lines
[1:54:06] is that right and that's what we are
[1:54:08] talking about the unwritten word
[1:54:11] reading between the lines and
[1:54:14] recognizing what god is saying to us
[1:54:17] praise god five minutes more and i'm on
[1:54:21] the road praise the lord hallelujah amen
[1:54:24] now he says
[1:54:27] remember
[1:54:28] it was in malachi 3
[1:54:31] that he said i
[1:54:33] will send my messenger before my face
[1:54:38] to prepare
[1:54:39] the people
[1:54:42] look
[1:54:43] john came
[1:54:45] and there was no selfishness in john
[1:54:49] john
[1:54:51] didn't take any glory or try to promote
[1:54:54] himself
[1:54:56] right see
[1:54:58] amen there even there the people
[1:55:01] tried to call him the messiah
[1:55:05] but he said i am not even worthy to lose
[1:55:09] his shoes
[1:55:10] but as soon as jesus appeared
[1:55:13] the voice said this is my beloved son in
[1:55:17] whom i am well pleased
[1:55:20] and immediately john said i must
[1:55:22] increase so that he i must decrease so
[1:55:24] that he might increase
[1:55:27] you see at that time john
[1:55:30] presented
[1:55:31] the church
[1:55:33] to christ
[1:55:34] amen
[1:55:36] and we are told in these last days
[1:55:40] that is
[1:55:42] going and will be
[1:55:45] repeated again
[1:55:48] you'll find that in the message called
[1:55:52] voice of the sign
[1:55:54] 1964.
[1:55:58] for there is going to be a message
[1:56:02] come forth in this day
[1:56:04] that will again
[1:56:06] introduce the messiah to the people
[1:56:10] in such a way they'll be down founded
[1:56:14] like they did back then
[1:56:16] amen oh my you know what it means
[1:56:18] they'll even want to call them that that
[1:56:21] maybe that's the christ that's the
[1:56:23] messiah that's what it is you see but
[1:56:26] remember it's still the same god
[1:56:29] i hope this gets true to you it's still
[1:56:33] the same god but all he is doing he
[1:56:36] takes a veil puts it on then he takes on
[1:56:40] another veil and he puts that on then he
[1:56:44] puts on another veil but always remember
[1:56:47] not the veil but it's the same god god
[1:56:53] showing himself through these various
[1:56:55] veils now some people are hung up on the
[1:56:57] veil and they're looking at the veil but
[1:57:00] we are looking to jesus christ the same
[1:57:02] yesterday today and forever he did it
[1:57:05] through the reformers did it through all
[1:57:07] of them
[1:57:08] until this day
[1:57:10] we have come to amen praise god
[1:57:13] hallelujah
[1:57:15] amen i'm going to end it here by the
[1:57:17] grace of god not
[1:57:19] i'm not completed the rest you can do
[1:57:22] that i'm not going to do your work for
[1:57:24] you you go and
[1:57:26] praise god
[1:57:28] search the word you can check in
[1:57:31] like i said sign of the end you can go
[1:57:34] for it and check in the questions
[1:57:37] answers uh in the seals
[1:57:40] you can go into the shalom book
[1:57:42] search it all out
[1:57:44] it's in there and
[1:57:46] god will surely bless you praise the
[1:57:49] lord god bless you all amen this
[1:57:52] messenger from heaven
[1:57:54] is jesus christ the lord himself
[1:57:57] come to speak to us
[1:57:59] and share with us his word
[1:58:02] and we
[1:58:03] just need
[1:58:04] the unwritten word and his voice
[1:58:08] is now speaking through us
[1:58:10] the seven thunders are now the living
[1:58:13] voices of the living god
[1:58:15] sundering out forming out the word
[1:58:18] bringing it forth for his glory and
[1:58:20] honor through us and that is why
[1:58:24] they're not going to
[1:58:26] respect it they're not going to
[1:58:28] understand it
[1:58:29] they will literally reject it but this
[1:58:32] is coming to the holdout edge right down
[1:58:35] into the deep calling to the deep and
[1:58:37] whatever is deep down in you god's
[1:58:39] spirit is discernable search and see
[1:58:42] whether you can see what god is trying
[1:58:44] to tell you now amen some people might
[1:58:47] initially doubt we don't know but then
[1:58:49] later on maybe god will break upon them
[1:58:52] what is inside of this world but for
[1:58:54] right now
[1:58:55] i can see clearly now
[1:58:58] because all the doubts are gone all the
[1:59:00] rain is gone everything is passed away
[1:59:03] and the world is growing and making
[1:59:06] itself manifest i'm standing in front of
[1:59:08] you here i don't have nothing prepared
[1:59:09] for next week i have no liturgy or no
[1:59:13] lenten nothing when i go from here then
[1:59:16] the holy spirit may
[1:59:18] give me something right sometimes while
[1:59:20] i'm in the middle of speaking to you
[1:59:22] bringing one message then he'll give me
[1:59:25] something that i can start working on
[1:59:27] and building on for the next week i
[1:59:29] don't know but right now you pray for me
[1:59:32] and i pray for you that god will bring
[1:59:35] his word and speak to us and build us up
[1:59:38] in the most holy faith and let us
[1:59:41] manifest
[1:59:43] cardinal
[1:59:45] virtue
[1:59:46] that is now
[1:59:48] don't emphasize these ones on the bottom
[1:59:51] we still pay attention to them but if we
[1:59:54] ask god to fill us with his love when we
[1:59:57] recognize because his grace and mercy is
[2:00:02] what brought us through can we sing that
[2:00:04] brother oh praise the lord sister can we
[2:00:07] sing that his grace and murder
[2:00:19] i live in this moment
[2:00:21] i live in this
[2:00:26] because of you
[2:00:28] [Music]
[2:00:32] i just want to thank you lord
[2:00:36] i want to
[2:00:40] and praise you too
[2:00:46] your grace and mercy
[2:00:49] [Applause]
[2:00:55] has
[2:00:57] broken me through
[2:01:01] hallelujah
[2:01:02] oh brother sister if you realize the joy
[2:01:06] we experienced today and every day
[2:01:10] walking in this liberty
[2:01:12] and this grace that god has given to us
[2:01:16] we walk in it and that gives us the
[2:01:19] ability
[2:01:20] to love one another not because we read
[2:01:23] it in the bible but the pulsation of the
[2:01:26] holy spirit
[2:01:28] working through the life of the believer
[2:01:30] causes us
[2:01:32] to love one another like we have never
[2:01:35] done before praise god may god bless our
[2:01:38] brother as he leads us here and close
[2:01:41] out our service we come together again

[2:02:27] all these various doctrines right
[2:02:30] but only to a certain depth and you
[2:02:33] leave that alone because we are here to
[2:02:36] go into the study
[2:02:37] of the mind of god
[2:02:39] under the person of jesus christ and to
[2:02:42] him be glory honor and praise god bless
