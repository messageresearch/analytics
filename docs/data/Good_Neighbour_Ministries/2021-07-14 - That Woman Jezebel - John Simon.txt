TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] it is indeed my greatest honor and privilege to have this opportunity to address you [Music] in the name of the lord jesus christ as a servant of the most high god giving me the opportunity to speak to his bride his elected lady for this age i am indeed blessed and on this wednesday night may the lord bless you also with his word as we give glory to him from the book of revelation chapter 2 verse 20. here it is notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou sufferest the woman jezebel which call it herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols gracious father we ask your blessing upon us as we deliver the word to your people to thee be all glory honor and praise in the name of jesus christ amen praise the lord hallelujah praise god our subject for tonight is that woman jezebel that woman jezebel now just uh to let you know god is speaking to the church but in actual fact when he speaks to the church he is speaking to the church as a whole for there is a part of the church that is the true church and a part that is the false church so in the eyes of god both true and false make up the church both whis and tears make up the church and so we find that one part of the church is one that is waiting for judgment to come the white throne judgment but the other part of the church the true church the elect church of the living god she is judging herself now by the word of god so that she will not have to go to that white throne judgment as the scripture tells us that if we judge ourselves here now by the word of god we shall not be judged or we shall not go into that white throne judgment and furthermore in first peter chapter 4 verse 7 the bible cl clearly tells us that judgment judgment when does it begin judgment begins in the house of god when the word of god is read declared revealed and understood judgment begins in the house of the lord oh praise god hallelujah now god calls all those who are within the umbrella of the what is called the church they are called christians but you see parts of them are christians according to the flesh while the other part are christians by the spirit true believers by the spirit of god and so these ones that bear the name of christ calling themselves christians actually they're taking his name in vain and they're carrying it in vain for mark 7 7 tells us how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men listen my friends this is what kind of a christian they are indeed they take christianity just as a religion and as long as they are part of that religion and subscribe to that religion then they uh carry the name of a christian it's just like someone who might uh go into the muhammadan faith and no matter what kind of a life he lives as long as he or she subscribes to the theories of that uh religion then they claim their muhammadan so is it with christianity subscribe to what is today called the christian faith as long as they can say oh i believe jesus is the son of god i believe he died was crucified raised from the dead then and here you see as long as they subscribe to those uh fundamental type of things uh then they claim they're christians but that is just a christian nominally in name only but not in spirit and in nature by the indwelling of the blessed presence of the blessed holy spirit ruling and reigning within the heart of that believer o praise god hallelujah amen yes sir so these nominal christians amen there are not real true christians only a name but not in nature not in spirit whatsoever and so here comes the wheat and the tears growing together and god says leave them alone leave them alone they have a right to be in the field just as much as you have so leave them alone and he god will do his work of separation and judgment but we are not to uproot them we may identify them we may recognize them we may know who they are but we will we should not uproot them because that is god's work that he has reserved to himself so the spirit of god is speaking in this age of sayathira and as it was in the wilderness with israel so is it in in this age that god is speaking to a mixed multitude of believers through and false as they journey not from egypt to canaan but from earth to glory the great holy spirit has a group of mixed multitude believers and here we find he is praising one group while rebuking the other group praising the true believers by assuring them that he god is aware and that he intimately knows and recognizes their works their good works that they are doing and their faithfulness their loyalty to the promises and precepts of the word of god he is telling them i know your works be assured have blessed assurance that i recognize what you're doing but while i'm doing that i must rebuke the false group that is intermingled in your midst that call it themselves christians also so he is rebuking the false vine because they're compromising and tolerating that woman preacher bible teaching woman that claims that she is a prophetess of god having none other but the wicked and evil spirit of jezebel resting upon her and utilizing her and god says because you have legitimizer you have allowed her you have enabled her you have empowered her to go out using my name in vain preaching and teaching contrary to my word god says i rebuke you amen and the true church rebukes such teaching and such actions contrary to the word of god notice carefully what started my friend as just simply a very simple uh feeling you know and that's the way sin starts a feeling you have a good feeling uh going off the word can start right in the church oh a service is going on and you got a good feeling and and you feel that something is is just great and it starts with just a little feeling and from a feeling my friends comes death because from that feeling it starts going into actions and becoming deeds and from the deeds you begin to make it a a doctrine it becomes a fixed idea in the mind or heart and you begin begin to live by it act by it right it becomes like the north star of that person and they begin to act from that point of view and there it is it goes into a doctrine so it was entitled that the teachings went into nicolasian doctrine and that doctrine weakened the church to the point that the church began to embrace the state oh think of that analogy the woman church the white supposedly the wife of the word christ is now embracing the state why because the state is then able to give her the power of money and she embraces with that also paganism at this time oh hallelujah amen in this age we see satan has gone beyond that where he now has his own profit so call of this age and we know that will just lead multitudes millions masses right into the lake of fire my friends let us ask or quest ourselves the question why does god rebuke jezebel well of course the obvious because she calls herself a preacher and god rebukes any woman that would call herself a preacher when the bible clearly tells us she shall not teach nor usurp authority amen that is the word of god it has nothing to do with your education your abilities if you're able if you have the talent if you have the gifts you have the opportunity nevertheless god calls you into obedience of his word regardless of all those things and her word will never change she shall not teach nor your serp authority this is the word of god it speaks of a of women of a woman and also it's speaking my friends of the false church now god is denouncing and rebuking jezebel and you have to understand why he's doing that and to do that let us look back at some of our history as it is spoken of in the bible if we can see what she did back then we can be able to understand what she is doing and will do now and in the future yes modern events are made clear by vindicated prophecy the hand strikes the shadow shadow on the wall and the shadow on the wall tells you the hand that was back here cast the shadows on the wall jezebel back here in the bible her character her nature her spirit her actions and activities her strategies or trickeries all are scheming at all points to what she did then it cannot fail for the form of what was back there cast its shadow on the wall of time here we are first of all jezebel was not a daughter ever of abraham nor was she admitted spiritually and legally into the tribe of israel she was not like rooster muabaitis was redeemed by a kinsmen redeemer on the contrary she was the daughter of king attelbial and he was the king of sidon first kings 16 1631 he was the priest the high priest of astarte the false god astarte and he gained the throne by murdering or assassinating his predecessor phillies so we right away we placed her as the daughter of a murderer one having a murderous spirit that makes you think of cain uh because your father was a liar and a murderer from the beginning and friends the same way she came to israel not by god's provided way or god's channel but she came her own way she did not come by the way god ordained a gentile should be should be admitted or allowed to come in and be a part of the tribe of israel she came in by marriage to it to ahab and that marriage was something to behold this marriage this union was not spiritual well absolutely not she married ahab for political reasons like a lot of scheming female today she married him for political reasons and so this woman jezebel was steeped into idolatry and did not have any desire whatsoever to serve jehovah the one true living god on the contrary she vowed that she would do everything in her power to move israel away from the worship of one god to the worship of venus the worship of real the sun god yes sir you see she smelled blood for she recognized that israel had already had a brush with idol worship in the wilderness they were tempted to worship the money the golden calf and there with that temptation uh in their past she could come which is what the devil does to everybody you have a weakness in your past god saves you you come into christ then the devil comes along and plays on that weakness from your past that's why brother branham said we all have a weakness but any boxer knows that you need to protect your weak point amen when you're attacking you got to always protect your weak point amen before you hit the devil because he's looking for your weak point amen oh praise god hallelujah amen from the time ahab married jezebel idolatry began to progress in the nation of israel and this woman this evil woman this wicked fornicating woman she began to build huge temples uh this princess of venus with of course astante that her father was the high priest of she raised up great temples to bail the sunburst the sun god and israel came to a crisis point in the life of the tribe of israel because she jezebel just like our world today uh finds itself in the stranglehold and influence of jezebel with her hands around their trout yes with this in mind as we look to the word of god we reiterate he have married jezebel as a political maneuver and from his point of view he married her to strengthen his kingdom just like constantine married himself to christianity or the false church back there to strengthen his political position his kingdom and secondly he married jezebel to secure his rulership and his kingdom there you go and that is exactly what the church did when it married not ahab but constantine when it married to constantine and together they both had political reasons but of course they put a spiritual atmosphere around this merging this union these this council of nicaea this coming ecumenical council they put a beautiful spiritual atmosphere around it so that it could make the true intents of those who give birth to this monster that is raising its head upon the scene no one should say or be convinced that because constantine had a vision of the cross that that made him a christian he was not he was a pagan matter of fact he was of the line of pontiffs he was the pontiff of the roman church the roman pagan religion of the time and he took on christian trappings because he felt they were lucky and blessed for him he began making crosses he began painting crosses on the shields of his soldiers as protection so called for him and he also know this he is the originator of the knights of columbus that is something else one should look at not necessarily just a religious order but has its political side to it and other parts to it there you find my friends the originator of the knights of columbus and the first one to put a cross on top of a cathedral he placed a cross on saint sophia and started by that a tradition because the other churches started copying from that and now crosses are everywhere as if that's going to scare off the devil as if that's going to make the devil become afraid now it's become like a mascot or some talisman or a magic if you wear it on your chest and it is not because the devil recognizes those who genuinely believe and have caught the revelation of jesus and his name and his actions and his mission here upon the earth amen yes sir so friends constantine his idea lives today even in our day that spirit that anointed him that anti-christ spirit that anointed him is still here with us today it anointed him then speaking in his ears and inspiring him to bring the what was called the church together and make it into one and so constantine got the pagans together got the false nominal church together with the the true church of the living god trying to bring a union for a while it seemed good but when the true believers recognized that they will never be able to turn the minds and hearts of the false ones back to the word they absolutely withdrew from that whatsoever and from that time that they withdrew from that time they were deemed as heretics and that term is still used today for anyone that disagrees disbelieves and disapproves of whatever they teach or propound yes they're called heretics amen oh praise god i'm like paul i believe i'm a heretic like paul in the way they call heresy so worship i the living god of heaven and earth who dwells within me and who lives forevermore or praise his holy name amen my friends they're coming together they're writing all manner of translations of bibles trying to arrive at one supreme translation pro proceeding from the minds and the acuity and brilliance of the minds of men rather than divine revelation and interpretation by the spirit of the living god and they get that bible and they legitimize it as their official bible hold on you think the king james version is wonderful but one one day there will take this king james version and they're going to say it has this against this group in here you have this against this other group over here it speaks against this other group and nothing about it is really uniting and therefore they will do away they will have their own way of doing away with king james and have their versions as i've said they'll do away with the king james version mark it believe it they'll get rid of it by doing away with it by the way i think there is a version already that's called the do away version or do a version oh my but think of it brother sisters that even while we speak that is being done they might have a bible that will satisfy protestant jews and also their pagan faith that they have they had the nicene council back there inspired by the devil true constantine now we're having the ecumenical council being inspired today bringing together all these various faiths while they are fighting the true faith of the living god today as was done back then do you know that when abe ahab married jezebel he sold out his birthright and any man any woman any church themselves into a denomination you sold your birthright if you go join a denomination you're sold your birthright the only thing you can do my brother sister if you're caught in the trap or in the grips of such a denominational system or structure is to heed the word of god in the book of revelation come out of her my people and be not partakers of her sin amen praise god yes it was truly the midnight hour in the life and history of the children of israel at nicaea it was the midnight hour for the church as it went right from that time into the dark ages and i believe my friends it's the midnight hour right now oh can't you hear the midnight cry may god give us a some spiritual paul revere oh i believe such a one has already crossed the land oh my a prophet has crossed the land and people don't understand his preaching his declaration of the word wake up people come alive recognize what is happening in your day and in your time amen yes sir midnight are again and the churches are coming together and those few brothers preachers men of god regardless of where they are that are crying out against such a thing they are counted as heretics they are counted as those that are against unity but they don't understand we're against that form that kind of unity that is contrary to the will and word of the living god married jezebel and immediately he gave her access to state funds state money was now available to her and so she erected two huge houses of worship to astate venus and to bail the sun god that is usually pictured by a sunburst my friends that was big enough she wanted to influence israel to come and worship there and so when constantine married to the church spiritually speaking he began to give them buildings and properties and enriched them and set them up so they can build high altars and and they could get all the great sculptors artists great artwork no doubt about it a lot of these images are a great artwork but god doesn't care about whether it's art whether it's it's beautifully formed that's wonderful to admire it from a human point of view but he says thou shalt not create any graven image thou shalt not bow down before them or nor serve them for i the lord thy god am a living god one true god amen and there is no other god beside him glory to god amen yes sir he did that allowed them to have large buildings money to build great golden altars altars my friends images by the greatest sculptors paintings by the greatest paintings the painters that we may admire today oh think of it and furthermore he organized a hierarchy a hierarchy of priesthood and order in other words he was going to do better than god and he was going to set up or organize in an orderly fashion the priesthood the way he thinks it should be just like satan god has his order of a five-fold ministry of preachers teachers evangelists pastors so administrators god has it his order but now satan creates his own and sets up this hierarchy that on the surface appears to be more organized orderly and systematic that you can know when a bell is supposed to be wrong when a certain type of sermon is supposed to be preached when certain words to be said he's got it all lined up none of this business where a man or can speak the word of god by revelation or suddenly say something by inspiration no that is not permitted you must go by the laid out order that is before him but i thank god for the holy spirit i take god for the presence of god in our lives to lead us and guide us so jezebel got the power of the state behind her and the moment she got that behind her she began to force the people to accept her religion how so later we find out my friends in the bible how she killed the prophets god's holy sages and prophets until elijah felt he was the only one left of course god had to reveal to him that he had seven thousand others but there were hidden up he had them living a hidden life as such oh my friends and here we find out right in the midst of nationalism there are thousands out there who are children of god and god has to wake them up to that fact that though they are in there they're not from there but they are they were only allowed to pass through there just as much as jesus was not from mary but he only passed through mary so that he could come into human manifestation and so god is calling you to a birth come out of her my people and be not partaker of her plagues amen back to god back to the word amen and in speaking this way recognize brother william myron branham was never against the people of god or the individual people in these various churches but what he was and is what i am what every other true servant of the living god is against is the system of denominationalism the structures the organizations that have a get out there because god hates it and if god hates it then we hate it and we're against the systems also that are out there remember all this started entire torah my friends where the people began to worship apollo the sun god amen the same veil sun god yes sir and how these people were began to teach the people to worship not by the scripture but by temple rights and temple traditions and by bringing services to the gods and sacrifices to their so-called saints gods that they had and they began to teach about death and life amen and they were doing their teaching at that time in taiseira through a prophetess by the name of jezebel who sat on a tree pronged stool or chair similar to the church of this age that sits on the comfortability in the tree-prong chair of trinitarian doctrine and speaking from that point of view all her teaching comes from that point of view and history says she had to go into a trance and then she would begin to become a voice for satan of course to speak true as god speaks through his prophets satan began to speak through this so-called prophetess teaching and seducing the servants of god to commit fornication which of course is speaking of idol worship began to have them going into idol worship ahab's union constantine union were illegal and both committed spiritual fornication against god oh my every fornicator will find themselves in the lake of fire god help you natural or spiritual you'll find yourself in the lake of fire and so we find the teaching of the catholic church and you know our church is typified as female or as a woman this church denies the word of god they have a modern version of the god apollo the sun god and that modern virgin of course is a pope amen and the church itself has become the prophet yes through whom the false god apollo speaks his orders through that church and give to the people rather than the scriptures the ideas of men they give you their thoughts of what they believe constitutes the forgiveness of sins their gifts to you their teaching of what they think is the blessing of god and some of the priests have gone so far as to categorize state that that there is a place called purgatory which does not exist in scripture anywhere nowhere in the word of god you can't find it they teach prayers they teach masses and money will get you out of the trap of purgatory if you got caught in there money can take you out printers and masses and candles can take you out and you see the whole system is based on false teaching contrary to the this word of the living god read your bible it's in the book amen don't get upset or angry with me are angry with the prophet william branham of whom i speak who is the one who god used to place his word so we his sons and daughters and servants of the living god can draw on that from that inspired by it and be able to preach and teach the word of god with power with us and with authority for the glory of his name yes they base their faith on the sinking signs of diabolical satanic untruths contrary to the word of god and saw the church has moved from organization to denominations that are spouting false teaching they don't even believe in the word of god where they'll say you say the word of god but the church says so and so you say the word of god says this but my church says this you see they have replaced the word of god with the word or teaching of the church contrary and in rebellion to the genuine word of god amen oh praise god forevermore friends i tell you the bible remains true let god's word be true and every other man's word be alive oh praise god revelation 17 amen we see this woman who has been living her entire historical life on a diet of false prophecies and not the word of god god calls her a oh that is the word of god himself that she is in idolatry and she trapped and caught the people into the very same thing what is the cure for this spiritual idolatry their word of god back to the bible back to the word there is your prescription there is your strong medicine there is the cure for idolatry for the word of god says this woman is a because she has left the word of god and she is sitting or ruling upon this great many waters multitudes millions of people billions masses of people she rains and rules over them and that is the false church because the true church of the living god is small for he himself said fear not little flock it is your father's good pleasure to give you the fullness of the word the full the kingdom amen notice she is like in the eyes of god what she is like in god's eyes no matter what she says about herself no matter when you look with your natural eyes like john in the book of revelation wondered with admiration you look with your natural eyes beautiful how it may seem how wonderful she looks to people how philosophical she sounds to people but the bible says she is rotten she is filthy she is unclean and she is a drunken drunkard a drunk woman tipping her way home drunk on her lies and her idolatry and her fornications drunk with the blood of the martyrs yes like jezebel who killed the prophets before her even so my friends we find this church today has killed will kill and continue to kill those who will not bow down before her nor subscribe to her teachings and her traditions and litanies so called yes sir amen praise god she'll use all her cruel methods but this church that deals in death the bible says she is dead herself amen she that lived in sin is dead while she appears or thinks that she is still alive and there is no life in her whatsoever because the spirit of god says that amen oh my friends that church is even more wicked and evil than ahab himself for ahab even repented for a while at one time yes sir but you can't say that about this church they refuse to apologize for any wrongs that they do and even if they do they they just mouse words and continue to do it through the centuries the very same murders evils the very same uh cruelties the very same things repeating over and over and she gets away with it and john shook his head and wandered with admiration at the scheming cunning evil wickedness of this evil church this woman was never repented and stubbornly destroyed anyone and all who stands in her way or tried to preach the word and help her to repent god raised up messengers she keeps destroying those wonderful messengers and their helpers martin columba patrick joan of arc many others wiped out carried away and then turn around and claim as if there were har from her or they were her own when they were not they were from and in the word of god she is drunk she has lost her senses towards spiritual things a carnal foolish fleshly lustful unclean heartlet to the word of the living god amen she repents not of our slaughter of our saints of the saints of god during the dark ages she is attempting now to unite with protestants making and tweaking her creeds to line up a little bit with the protestant teachings her daughter's teachings yes sir now oh and she never will apologize for her mass murders in every form whatsoever she want no matter how mellow take this warning that no matter how mellow like a cat no matter how sweet and purry and furry she appears to be no matter how she will rise up to kill again she will rise up to murder again she will rise up with another inquisition another tortures and cruelties again for murder and evil lies within the empty caverns of our heart and it reverberates and echoes once again within this age of thyatira may god bless you may god bless our hearts together as we consider these things in the word of god may the spirit of god bless you please my friends share this message share this sermon with us many others as you can find send the light send the gospel light let the word go out my friends subscribe ring the bell give glory to god and let the gospel bells ring from sea to shining sea god bless you all until we come together again on sunday morning when we speak on the word of god concerning god's great light for this day and hour may god go with you now [Music] amen [Music] so you
