[41:31] [Music]
[41:34] 11 and the next scripture is Psalms 421
[41:37] to3 so you read Amos first it says that
[41:41] behold the day come the days come said
[41:46] the Lord God that I will send a fing in
[41:49] the land not a fine of bread nor a thir
[41:53] for water but of hearing the word the

[42:25] to3
[42:34] okay as the heart panted after the water
[42:38] BR so panted my soul after God my soul
[42:44] FS for God for the Living God When shall
[42:48] I come and I before God my fears have
[42:52] been my meat day and night while they
[42:56] to me where is please be
[43:01] seated Hallelujah God is
[43:05] it so funny I
[43:07] [Music]
[43:09] than my topic here this afterno of the
[43:13] subject matter is why people are not
[43:17] satisfied and so fun because I had a
[43:21] privilege to have a fellowship with here
[43:25] on thir day
[43:26] you never knew I be standing here today
[43:29] you just felling around the word he was
[43:32] talking all about my thought when I was
[43:35] laughing just fellowshipping everything
[43:38] was around what God livs in my heart to
[43:42] bring in this aftering so I believe that
[43:44] it will be a blessing to
[43:49] you and I'll just start by
[43:54] reading a little quot here from the
[43:57] prophet of
[43:59] God in the
[44:01] message
[44:03] um that day on
[44:06] Calvary and then he said that what will
[44:09] it be what will it be when you get to
[44:13] heaven and you meet there for that great
[44:16] time of everlasting Eternal
[44:22] Fellowship I just want to come a little
[44:24] bit for my thoughts say just think there
[44:28] is not
[44:30] anything that you can think
[44:33] of that you like to do but what once in
[44:39] a while you tie in doing it sh I guess
[44:45] you and I have squaring answered more
[44:48] than anything that we like to do in the
[44:51] way of that but you know you get tired
[44:56] doing it and I like to
[44:59] hide get into the mountains and just
[45:03] hide but I get
[45:05] tired sometimes and I want to do
[45:08] something else sometimes I get a feeling
[45:11] kind of tired and wor out nerves on edge
[45:16] I'll just jump in my car and take out
[45:18] and hold to the St whe going down the
[45:21] road singing I am so glad that I can see
[45:25] I'm one of them that's why it miss my
[45:28] soul or something just gripping that
[45:30] room and singing and stomping my food
[45:33] and shouting and well after a while I
[45:35] get tired and I return back home so in
[45:38] other words he was trying to say that
[45:41] whil you're on this Earth nothing that
[45:44] you do that
[45:47] really have that lasting
[45:52] satisfaction what iy like you satisfy
[45:56] it doesn't
[45:58] last for instance if I want to buy a
[46:02] watch I save all my money to make sure I
[46:06] get that once I get that I become so
[46:10] happy J this very exciting but after a
[46:14] while that satisfaction just go like
[46:16] that the same thing applies to your
[46:19] first house your first car everything
[46:23] you so excited into it and you cherish
[46:26] it we need to have it we are here we
[46:28] need all those things I'm not saying
[46:30] that we don't we need them but what I'm
[46:33] trying to say is that after you got all
[46:36] those you very happy and satisfying
[46:39] jumping up and down but after 2 3 years
[46:43] that you don't value it the same as you
[46:47] get it for the first time and men were
[46:52] made that way
[46:54] to so we always testing for
[46:58] something and there is a desire for
[47:03] everybody to be um successful in
[47:10] life yeah to be successful in life and
[47:14] people define success in life is that
[47:19] when you have the highest education you
[47:22] become a lawyer a doctor and all that
[47:25] kind and stuff so people who don't have
[47:28] that sometimes they look
