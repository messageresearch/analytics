[15:38] my life
[15:38] he only speaks a few words and he said
[15:41] it is finished I heard that voice
[15:48] allowed inside me just like when I was
[15:51] in the Catholic Church I was kneeling
[15:53] down trying to seek my help in recent
[15:55] stuff when I was seeking God canucks on
[15:58] the verge of suicide and he spoke to me

[44:23] the power of Satan Satan you've got no
[44:26] right back to the cross of Calvary I
[44:31] sacrifice my Savior overcoming you in
[44:36] the garden Yosemite and I say God you

[45:04] Jesus Christ and set them free for the
[45:09] Son of Man our God set free is free
[45:12] indeed bless their hearts for now that
