[0:00] [Music]
[0:09] good sunday morning
[0:10] praise god hallelujah it's
[0:14] good to be together again giving
[0:17] praise and honor to him
[0:20] i'm so sorry but we do not
[0:23] have our time of fellowship
[0:26] or worship because of our coveted
[0:30] restrictions but nevertheless
[0:33] we are here to praise god
[0:36] and give him glory by the preaching
[0:40] of the word may the holy spirit bless
[0:44] anoint and give us spiritual growth
[0:47] as we place our hearts and our
[0:50] thoughts upon the word of god let us
[0:54] pray
[0:55] our gracious heavenly father we
[0:58] ask for your divine blessing upon the
[1:02] word of god today
[1:04] may you bless and anoint your people
[1:07] as we sent forth the word in light and
[1:11] truth
[1:12] may the great holy spirit be glorified
[1:16] may your word be magnified
[1:18] may your name be uplifted and may the
[1:22] truth of god go
[1:23] forth father wherever you wanted to find
[1:27] a nest a
[1:28] resting place a heart to mind a soul
[1:32] ordained by you from before the
[1:35] foundations of the world
[1:38] may the holy spirit father find that
[1:41] resting place
[1:43] and may the dove of peace rest
[1:46] in peace in the presence of god
[1:50] to you be all the glory and the praise
[1:54] in the name of jesus christ our lord
[1:57] amen and amen
[2:01] well today i would
[2:04] like for us to talk about the human race
[2:08] we'd like to talk about this race
[2:12] spoken of in hebrews
[2:15] chapter 12 verses 1
[2:19] to 3. it speaks of this
[2:22] human race it may be called the
[2:25] race the glory the race to heaven
[2:29] lice race it may be called by
[2:32] many different descriptions
[2:36] but i would like to approach it today
[2:40] from the point of view of finishers
[2:44] finishers as the old song says oh there
[2:47] were
[2:48] many that started in the race and
[2:51] with the word with the lord jesus they
[2:54] fail to keep peace others accept it
[2:58] because it is new
[3:00] oh but i've started out with jesus and
[3:04] i am going through i trust that you are
[3:07] too
[3:07] as we read from god's word from the book
[3:10] of hebrews chapter 12
[3:12] verses 1 to 3 wherefore
[3:16] seeing we also are compassed about
[3:20] with so great a cloud of witnesses
[3:24] let us lay aside every weight
[3:27] and the sin which dot so easily
[3:31] beset us and let
[3:34] us run let us
[3:37] run with patience the race
[3:41] that is set before us looking onto jesus
[3:46] the author and finisher
[3:49] of our faith for the joy
[3:53] that was set before him endured the
[3:57] cross
[3:58] despising the shame and is set
[4:01] down at the right hand of the throne of
[4:05] god
[4:06] for consider him that endured such
[4:09] contradiction of sinners
[4:11] against himself lest you be
[4:14] weary and faint in
[4:18] your minds now we realize
[4:22] that our entire life whether we a
[4:26] christian
[4:26] non-christian whatever we are claiming
[4:31] that we are the bible
[4:34] tells us clearly that we are all
[4:37] engaged in the human
[4:41] race because from
[4:44] birth until death
[4:48] we are in the race
[4:51] a race to the rapture
[4:55] we are engaged in this race
[4:58] that we might gain the crown of eternal
[5:02] life
[5:03] it really doesn't matter who you are
[5:07] it doesn't matter friends how great
[5:10] and wonderful your achievements
[5:13] may be it doesn't matter what victories
[5:17] you have
[5:18] what uh what great certificates diplomas
[5:23] that you may have to decorate your
[5:25] office wall
[5:27] it really does not matter your successes
[5:31] doesn't matter your prosperity
[5:34] doesn't matter whatsoever you might have
[5:38] done that during your entire lifetime
[5:42] but it will all be in vain
[5:45] if your soul is cast into
[5:48] other darkness cast into the
[5:52] pits of hell away from
[5:55] god the joy of god the peace of god the
[5:58] life the love of god
[6:00] and the people of god and you are cast
[6:03] away
[6:04] forever then all you have accomplished
[6:07] and all you have
[6:08] done will be for not
[6:12] for we are all engaged in this
[6:15] human race that we are in
[6:19] and will be cast aside
[6:23] because of our own spiritual blindness
[6:27] or our own spiritual
[6:31] ignorance to god and
[6:34] his word this gospel
[6:38] must be preached into all the world and
[6:41] then shall the end come so
[6:45] to come to a revelation of
[6:48] this gospel is the most
[6:51] important thing in our life
[6:55] to grasp the word of god to
[6:58] recognize your day and the message for
[7:02] your day
[7:04] is the most important thing that we are
[7:07] here
[7:08] make no mistake about it my friends
[7:11] we are in a race against time whether we
[7:14] be sinner or saint
[7:16] king or commoner whether we be professor
[7:20] or whether we just be a possessor or an
[7:23] ordinary person
[7:24] within the street my friends
[7:28] we are all in this race together
[7:32] and we must race against time
[7:35] above all else we must use
[7:39] the time we have here on earth to be
[7:42] able to
[7:43] know jesus christ to know the reality
[7:47] of his word you may not think that is
[7:50] important
[7:51] but when you come to the end of your way
[7:55] you will find that that is the most
[7:58] essential
[7:59] and important thing in your
[8:02] entire existence to know
[8:06] him is to know life eternal
[8:10] to know him is to enter into
[8:13] life's joys and life's
[8:16] inheritance now
[8:20] a certain olympic runner
[8:23] and i'm quoting from george macdonald
[8:26] rebuilding your broken world
[8:30] in this he said an olympic
[8:33] runner distance runner who
[8:37] was also a a missionary
[8:40] in the work of god he wrote to a friend
[8:45] who was experiencing a personal crisis
[8:50] some personal disaster maybe you are
[8:53] uh involved in a personal disaster
[8:56] a personal crisis or some major
[9:00] challenge in your life now
[9:03] he said in this race
[9:08] that i was running i suddenly
[9:12] hit a branch the branch of a tree
[9:17] and the blow almost knocked
[9:20] me out it knocked me out of the race
[9:25] and almost knocked me cold
[9:29] but somehow i staggered
[9:32] back to the track and i stumbled on
[9:36] i remember one thing clear
[9:40] in the conclusion as i was staggering
[9:44] one thought stuck in my mind i
[9:47] must not lay down i must not
[9:51] give up i must keep on
[9:55] i must keep going even if
[9:58] i come in long and far behind the others
[10:03] but i must finish the race
[10:06] not only must i start it but i must
[10:10] finish this race i must not quit
[10:14] i must keep going and he said and i kept
[10:18] going
[10:19] and to my surprise when i came to the
[10:22] end
[10:23] i won the race
[10:27] with every difficulty
[10:31] with the blow with the setback
[10:36] i must keep on going
[10:39] god will lead us always
[10:42] to the same results my friend
[10:46] my brothers my sisters no matter what
[10:49] you
[10:50] may be going through in this very moment
[10:53] i am putting it to you right now that
[10:56] our
[10:57] god is able and no matter if you've been
[11:01] knocked down the devil has tried to
[11:03] knock you out
[11:04] but you must press on keep on going say
[11:08] lord i'm pressing on the
[11:10] upward way new heights i'm gaining
[11:14] every day still praying as i'm onward
[11:17] bound
[11:18] lord plant my feet on
[11:21] higher ground yes let us remember
[11:26] very much the thought in which he said
[11:30] we must keep on it
[11:33] absolutely captures paul's thought
[11:37] here on this race that god has given to
[11:41] us that we must
[11:43] run hebrews 12 1 paul says
[11:47] let us run with patience
[11:50] or perseverance the race that is
[11:54] marked out for us listen this is a race
[11:58] that is marked out for you
[12:00] your footsteps are ordained
[12:03] or ordered by the lord god
[12:06] knows the mistakes god knows the test
[12:10] god knows the trials god knows
[12:13] what you are going through even right
[12:16] now the holy
[12:17] spirit is aware and knows
[12:21] what it is that you are going through
[12:25] now my friends the only way that you can
[12:29] do the right kind of
[12:31] job for the lord is to put your
[12:35] everything behind what you are
[12:38] doing for him put all your strength
[12:43] all your soul all your heart
[12:46] all your mind put your everything in it
[12:50] if you're a christian do you want to be
[12:52] a real christian
[12:54] or are you just having a sham of a
[12:57] christianity
[12:58] which if it is searched out will be
[13:01] found that
[13:02] you are partially fake
[13:05] may god help every one of us to do
[13:08] everything within our hearts within our
[13:11] souls
[13:12] to be real believers that will
[13:15] hold to god's unchanging hand and
[13:18] not the things of this world
[13:21] they are there for us god will bless us
[13:24] if we are faithful to him but let
[13:27] our eyes be upon the lord jesus christ
[13:32] when you're going to do anything
[13:35] whether it be for god or man do it right
[13:40] do it in the right way put everything
[13:43] leave everything else alone and if
[13:46] you're going to be a
[13:47] christian put everything you have in it
[13:50] to
[13:51] live a life for jesus christ put your
[13:54] time
[13:55] put your talents put your everything
[13:58] in it my friends whether it you
[14:02] whether you're playing a guitar whether
[14:04] you're strumming some instrument
[14:06] whether you're blowing a saxophone or a
[14:09] flute
[14:09] whatever it is put all your wisdom
[14:13] all your talent in it and use it for the
[14:17] glory of god
[14:18] and god will help you god will
[14:20] straighten you
[14:21] no matter what you think you may not be
[14:25] the best talent you may not be the best
[14:27] of anything
[14:28] but in god's eyes when you do it with
[14:31] your sincerity
[14:33] with your heart with your soul behind it
[14:36] all then he is with you and
[14:39] for you amen and amen
[14:42] and he gives all praise and honor
[14:46] and glory to those who stand for him
[14:49] no matter what it is if you know how to
[14:53] whistle
[14:54] then whistle for his glory and honor
[14:57] justify
[14:58] do something but don't sit there
[15:02] and claim to be a christian we are not
[15:05] to be
[15:05] spectators or observers we are supposed
[15:08] to be
[15:09] participators we are supposed to be ones
[15:12] who are engaged in the race
[15:15] not just spectating or admiring
[15:18] someone else running in the race and
[15:21] saying oh
[15:22] he's a good man oh she's a christian
[15:25] woman that that young woman she is just
[15:29] a beautiful one that's living for for
[15:32] her lord
[15:33] well that's her faith but but i want to
[15:35] live the way i
[15:36] want to live no my friends let us see
[15:40] the example
[15:41] put forth by the savior how no matter he
[15:44] endured the shame
[15:46] he endured the toilet test the trials
[15:50] he endured the sufferings of
[15:52] persecutions
[15:53] that he might come to the end of the way
[15:56] and so should it be like every one of us
[16:00] friends put
[16:01] god's first in everything your home
[16:05] your husband your wife
[16:08] your children whatever it is let
[16:12] that take second place and put
[16:15] god first let him be the
[16:18] number one thing or person
[16:22] within your heart and within your life
[16:26] may god find the very first
[16:29] place within our hearts and within our
[16:32] lives
[16:33] you must let him have the preeminent
[16:36] position
[16:37] in your heart and life god doesn't want
[16:41] second place god does not want to be a
[16:44] spare
[16:45] tire in your life that you only
[16:49] call him into your life when you're
[16:51] broken down
[16:52] and your life isn't moving anywhere you
[16:55] can't go on
[16:57] then you need him no he will fulfill
[17:00] that
[17:01] but nevertheless he does not want to be
[17:04] second place
[17:05] he wants to be recognized
[17:08] as being number one the preeminent one
[17:13] the one who has first place within
[17:16] your heart and within your life i say to
[17:20] you
[17:21] he deserves the best he deserves the
[17:25] first place
[17:26] within our hearts and within our lives
[17:30] and so we need to seek the will the plan
[17:33] and purpose
[17:34] of god we're not we're not here
[17:37] to look after the acclaims of man
[17:40] we're not here for the recognition
[17:43] of man we are not here for the
[17:46] platitudes the
[17:48] the great the papers and the great
[17:50] diplomas and certificates of
[17:53] of man though that may be good in the
[17:56] educational
[17:57] field of natural life natural endeavor
[18:02] we understand that that does give us
[18:05] some kind of recognition
[18:08] but let us not put our faith or our
[18:12] trust in such things put our trust in
[18:15] jesus
[18:16] christ who is the same yesterday
[18:19] today and forever oh glory be to god
[18:23] let's not give favor to what our
[18:26] neighbor thinks
[18:28] or what the people think it has nothing
[18:31] to do
[18:31] with your wife and her what she thinks
[18:35] of how you are serving god let us not
[18:38] seek the favor
[18:40] my friends of anything else oh
[18:43] praise god but let's look forward
[18:46] to being the one that places him
[18:49] first within our hearts and within our
[18:52] lives
[18:53] now paul emphasizes
[18:56] one of his chief concerns that we
[19:00] should finish our race with jesus christ
[19:04] finish it with glory and
[19:08] with the spirit of trial for we
[19:11] find as the song says oh
[19:14] there are many who start in this race
[19:18] many who start going to church many who
[19:21] start
[19:22] claiming to believe the message of the
[19:24] hour
[19:25] menu who start out religiously
[19:29] pressing on the upward way but then very
[19:32] soon
[19:32] [Music]
[19:34] they fall and stumble by the side of the
[19:37] way
[19:38] romans 2 1 that dwell therefore we ought
[19:42] to give the more
[19:43] earnest heed to the things which we have
[19:46] heard
[19:48] lest at any time we should let
[19:51] them slip another translation says
[19:54] niv pay more careful attention
[19:59] so that we do not drift away
[20:03] from that which we were taught in the
[20:05] word of god
[20:06] may god help every one of us listening
[20:09] to the word of god regardless of where
[20:12] you
[20:13] are what nation what country what corner
[20:16] whether in a palace whether in a great
[20:19] mansion
[20:20] or whether in just a little old huffle
[20:23] by the side of the way what you are
[20:26] hearing
[20:26] is the word of god and if you hear god's
[20:30] word
[20:30] god will pay heed to you and god
[20:34] will hearten to your life to your needs
[20:36] and
[20:37] mostly he will help you to win
[20:40] this lice race he'll help you to finish
[20:44] this lice race so let's not only be
[20:46] starters
[20:48] we have a lot of starters right now you
[20:51] look in the denominations
[20:54] you look around the world and there are
[20:57] thousands and thousands of starters
[21:00] whenever you go and you witness
[21:04] whether on television or in person
[21:07] my friends the race starts
[21:10] out with thousands of people
[21:14] no matter what marathon it is in
[21:17] and they all start together and you
[21:20] wonder
[21:20] how many is going to come to the end of
[21:23] the way
[21:24] but jesus already told us whoa
[21:28] man he was running the broad way oh but
[21:31] there is a way
[21:33] there is a narrow way there is just a
[21:36] and few there be that will find it
[21:39] few will finish this race few will make
[21:42] it through the trials the troubles the
[21:44] tribulations
[21:45] the torments the persecutions the
[21:48] reproach for the world
[21:50] the shame that must be born for his
[21:52] great
[21:53] name oh praise god forever may the great
[21:57] holy spirit
[21:58] help us today that we will make it
[22:01] through
[22:01] no matter what the devil tries to true
[22:05] in our way listen to the word of god
[22:08] oh praise god my friends i'll tell you
[22:12] we should worship god give him glory and
[22:15] give him
[22:15] praise every hour every moment
[22:19] of our life our work must be a form of
[22:22] worship
[22:24] every opportunity that presents itself
[22:27] we must worship god
[22:30] we may see or meet someone
[22:33] and we have the opportunity of
[22:36] sharing with them this glorious gospel
[22:40] my friends don't press it don't push it
[22:43] but do your
[22:44] best if the lord up gives you not to
[22:47] reach
[22:47] out to them and let them know there is a
[22:51] better life a man that may be swearing
[22:54] using the name of the lord in vain don't
[22:57] back away from it
[22:58] but be a child of the king and be able
[23:02] with love with humility
[23:06] praise god and not publicly but be able
[23:09] to
[23:10] let the holy spirit allow you to get
[23:13] that person by themselves
[23:15] privately and tell them of the grace of
[23:19] god
[23:20] and of the love of god and what he has
[23:23] done for you and what he is doing for
[23:26] you
[23:27] and how he could change their life and
[23:30] bring them into a life that
[23:32] would be a life eternal a life of joy
[23:35] a life of peace a life of pardon
[23:38] a life of redemption and one which will
[23:42] take them to the end of the way with
[23:46] this blessed assurance
[23:48] that is mine oh what a foretaste
[23:51] of the glory divine oh praise god
[23:55] forevermore
[23:56] thank god we can worship him and give
[23:59] him
[24:00] all the glory just go and share this
[24:03] message this glorious message that we
[24:06] have received
[24:08] in this time with meekness with
[24:11] gentleness with broadly kindness
[24:14] just as you would have it to you you you
[24:17] try to do
[24:18] that with someone else privately
[24:21] share with them either by giving them a
[24:24] tape a
[24:24] book a sermon a song your personal
[24:28] testimony tell them all about love and
[24:31] presence of god uh that and the powers
[24:34] of the world to come
[24:36] the anointing of the blessed holy spirit
[24:39] upon your life
[24:40] and what it took you from and what he
[24:43] has
[24:44] brought you in he took you out of the
[24:47] ghetto and put you in the ghetto
[24:50] he took you my friends from the bottom
[24:53] of the pits and
[24:54] put you in his palace that you can say i
[24:58] walk with the king hallelujah glory to
[25:01] god
[25:01] i walk with the king blessed be his holy
[25:05] name
[25:05] no matter what you may be called my
[25:08] friends
[25:09] we know there's a god in heaven
[25:13] who answers the prayers of his
[25:16] people who believe in faith and believe
[25:20] and trust in his word
[25:22] just this week we had a wonderful
[25:25] precious brother
[25:26] was rushed to the hospital they tested
[25:29] him they
[25:29] did that checked up on him and one
[25:33] hospital said
[25:34] oh you you have a problem it's your
[25:36] heart
[25:37] you've got pains you you've got the
[25:39] blockage you've got this you've got that
[25:42] and now let's take you to a an even
[25:45] better hospital that has better
[25:47] equipment
[25:48] and doctors meanwhile a prayer request
[25:51] goes out
[25:52] to our prayer circle and the believers
[25:55] saints get before god and begin to pray
[26:00] in
[26:00] faith for we know the prayer of faith

[27:12] body
[27:12] that you have a hold of i demand in
[27:15] jesus christ's name
[27:17] and that his name every knee shall bow
[27:20] and every tongue must confess
[27:22] oh you must confess him as lord you may
[27:25] leave the person now and go from them
[27:28] and return no more
[27:30] may the healing touch whether it be
[27:32] cancer whether it be blood
[27:34] pressure whether it be back pain matter
[27:36] whatever it is
[27:37] if that person can only believe all
[27:40] things are possible
[27:42] to them that will believe the word of
[27:45] god
[27:46] listen hebrews 4 1 let us do for
[27:50] fear lest a promise be left us
[27:53] entering into his rest any of you
[27:57] should come short of it hallelujah
[28:00] o praise god hallelujah blessed be the
[28:04] name
[28:04] of our god yes brother sister let me
[28:07] stay in christ

[28:12] you're a fanatic that's right i've been
[28:14] to the attic
[28:15] i've been there and i've come back down
[28:18] with the holy spirit within my
[28:20] soul hallelujah they may call you a holy
[28:24] role
[28:24] they may call you excitable they may
[28:26] call you
[28:27] one of those people yes brother
[28:30] sister but i am a supernatural witness
[28:35] of the word of god and the power of the
[28:38] holy spirit
[28:40] amen may god keep our souls in christ
[28:43] because
[28:44] some day is coming i said one day
[28:47] he's coming again and all those who are
[28:51] in christ will god bring with him
[28:54] in the name of jesus christ there is a
[28:58] spiritual revealed truth laying right
[29:00] there
[29:01] and it'll take you having a spiritual
[29:03] mind
[29:04] to catch it and to hang on to it now
[29:07] we're talking about being a
[29:09] finisher in this race
[29:12] and i want to quote from
[29:15] a wonderful person that is an
[29:19] actual runner her name is
[29:22] jennifer bro the gun
[29:27] and here she is speaking
[29:31] now i know what it takes to win a race
[29:36] friends anyone can race but it takes
[29:38] something special
[29:40] for someone to win a race what does it
[29:43] take
[29:43] it takes hours of training
[29:47] it takes hard work it takes spending
[29:51] time
[29:52] in the wet room it means
[29:55] putting away changing your eating habits
[29:59] your sleeping habits you can't
[30:04] think you're going to live on a diet of
[30:07] ice cream
[30:09] and cake and four hours of sleep
[30:13] and you're going to be a winner in the
[30:15] race
[30:16] it'll lead to disaster yes sir
[30:20] you must have a like a diet she says of
[30:23] lean protein with fruits and
[30:27] vegetables is more successful
[30:30] than those kinds of other diets
[30:34] and it's true my friends in this race
[30:37] we want to be finishers we just don't
[30:41] want to have the
[30:42] glamour and glory of starting in the
[30:45] race
[30:46] or saying i'm a christian but being a
[30:49] finisher
[30:50] in the race you cannot partake in cake
[30:54] and
[30:54] late night slumber parties and
[30:57] liquored up parties my friends instead
[31:01] you need to
[31:02] lay aside every weight and every sin
[31:05] that easily tries to cling onto you
[31:08] and to hold on to you amen praise god
[31:12] but you must put your eyes upon the
[31:14] prize
[31:15] which is jesus christ our lord and
[31:18] eternal life
[31:20] which he alone can give amen we must run
[31:23] this race
[31:25] run it like i said with the back of your
[31:28] mind
[31:29] with the thought i am a finisher
[31:33] and i am going to finish this race
[31:36] with god's help i started with jesus
[31:41] and with god's help i am going through
[31:45] oh praise god forevermore you are going
[31:48] to start out by believing first of all
[31:51] if you're not a believer then from today
[31:55] you must be a believer
[31:56] become a believer be baptized in water
[32:00] in the name of jesus christ not father
[32:03] son
[32:04] and holy ghost but in the name of jesus
[32:07] christ for those apostles realize
[32:09] what jesus was saying when he did use
[32:12] the words
[32:13] be baptizing them in the name of the
[32:15] father and of the son and
[32:17] of the holy ghost he did not say names
[32:19] but in the
[32:20] name one name for that person that is
[32:24] father
[32:25] son and holy ghost and peter which some
[32:27] claim is the first pope
[32:29] he said it clearly in acts chapter 2
[32:32] verse 38 and onwards he says it's
[32:34] clearly repent
[32:36] be baptized every one of you in the name
[32:40] of jesus christ hallelujah
[32:42] and be baptized in the name
[32:45] of jesus christ it's the name that we
[32:48] must be baptized in for there is no
[32:51] other name
[32:52] given under heaven whereby we must be
[32:55] saved but the name of jesus christ
[32:58] for this is the name that is above all
[33:00] names
[33:01] that the lord god has given unto us
[33:04] now after believing we have started our
[33:07] race
[33:09] but now you must persevere you must be
[33:12] persistent
[33:13] you must live with spiritual stamina
[33:16] and allow the holy spirit not to be
[33:20] just laughing and funny because the
[33:23] christian life is no my friends
[33:27] it's not one where you go around with a
[33:30] sour face
[33:31] or a grumpy face either it's full of the
[33:34] joy of god
[33:36] but not the frivolous joys of the world
[33:39] but we must press on with perseverance
[33:42] in the middle of all
[33:43] our tests and trials thirdly
[33:46] we must have this spirit of getting to
[33:50] the finish
[33:51] line by laying aside every sin
[33:55] every weight anything that will try to
[33:58] cling on or attach on to us by the grace
[34:02] of god
[34:02] hebrews 12 listen looking since we are
[34:06] surrounded by so
[34:07] great a cloud of witnesses let us lay
[34:10] aside
[34:11] every weight and every sin which clings
[34:14] so closely
[34:16] and let us run with patience or
[34:19] endurance
[34:20] the race that is marked out by god
[34:23] are set before us looking to
[34:27] jesus the founder
[34:30] the perfecter the author and
[34:34] the finisher he was not just a beginner
[34:37] or an author but he was the finisher and
[34:40] he expects all of his children
[34:42] to be finishers of this marvelous
[34:46] and this glorious race
[34:49] now my friends many runners
[34:55] properly nourish their body
[34:58] so that if they encounter problems along
[35:02] the way
[35:03] they'll be able to recover quickly and
[35:07] press on
[35:08] so must we as believers keep
[35:12] feeding on the word of god
[35:15] not just the bible but the revelation
[35:18] of that word amen and as we
[35:22] feed on the word building up our
[35:24] spiritual strength
[35:26] our maturity and our spiritual stamina
[35:29] when we are knocked down by a branch
[35:32] when we are
[35:33] knocked down or we stumble upon some
[35:35] stone
[35:36] that may be in our way when we get
[35:39] knocked out of our lane
[35:41] we can rise and try again
[35:44] as i've often said we can turn our
[35:47] setbacks
[35:48] into comebacks praise god hallelujah
[35:52] we can endure the long runs
[35:55] we can do the short runs we can do the
[35:59] speed runs
[36:01] we can lift the weights we can do all
[36:04] the stretching
[36:06] and learn how to endure
[36:09] and push and press your way through pain
[36:13] and do all all the sore muscles
[36:16] all the aching tired lungs
[36:19] you learn to do all of this so that when
[36:22] you are
[36:23] in this race you can truly say i am
[36:26] going through
[36:28] i am going through no matter what others
[36:31] do
[36:32] i'll take the way with the lord's
[36:35] despised view
[36:36] i started out with jesus what i am
[36:40] going through as christians
[36:44] let me say to you we must work hard
[36:48] to straighten our faith
[36:51] that we may endure the race
[36:55] we must seek him daily in prayer
[36:58] we must feed on his word daily
[37:02] we must live by having fellowship with
[37:05] others
[37:06] who are running in this race
[37:10] we must my friends
[37:13] mix with other believers so that we may
[37:18] be encouraged by them or we may be used
[37:21] by
[37:22] god to encourage them within
[37:25] our walk that is why we need
[37:28] the fellowship of the saints the
[37:31] fellowship
[37:32] of the believers we must also have
[37:36] fellowship so that we may have
[37:39] rebuke some people only love to be
[37:42] praised
[37:43] but when god anoints a brother a sister
[37:46] a pastor a deacon a trustee with
[37:50] a word of rebuke and correction
[37:53] many times we don't want to receive it
[37:56] for a man but god allows us
[38:00] to develop within our personality within
[38:03] our lives
[38:04] personal private
[38:07] discipline accountability that we might
[38:11] grow
[38:11] in christ and we may keep our
[38:14] eyes focused on him alone
[38:19] yes my friends there are many things may
[38:22] come in our life
[38:24] that may slow us down
[38:28] many things may come in our life that
[38:30] may stall us
[38:32] in our run to the finish line
[38:37] many times self-centeredness
[38:41] and joy that is only for yourself
[38:48] personal praise slows us down
[38:52] sometimes sin clings on to us so closely
[38:56] and it's hard to shake off that habit or
[38:59] to shake off
[39:00] that sin that clings to us so
[39:03] closely and after a while sin
[39:06] that habit that that
[39:10] thing which you will say oh that's my
[39:12] way that's the way i
[39:13] well god wants you to have his way and
[39:16] to
[39:17] shake off those things that are of self
[39:20] of sin and of the world the laid the
[39:24] messiah
[39:25] amen the father we are from sin
[39:28] the closer that we can be to him
[39:32] and let us keep our eyes on jesus
[39:35] not on the spectators on the sides of
[39:38] the way
[39:40] but keep our eyes upon the lord jesus
[39:43] looking unto jesus paul said looking
[39:47] on to jesus the author and the finisher
[39:51] of our faith let's finish this race
[39:55] that we started that god placed upon us
[39:59] praise god hallelujah set your eyes
[40:02] firmly upon him when we thank my
[40:05] brothers
[40:06] when we come to the end of the way
[40:08] remember the crown
[40:10] remember the reward that he has promised
[40:13] how he would make us into a tree of life
[40:16] how he would give us
[40:17] the victor's crown hallelujah when we
[40:20] come to the end of the way
[40:22] or we will have life eternal life which
[40:25] will
[40:26] never end no more weeping no more
[40:29] crying no more sorrow no more tears
[40:32] when we come to the end of life's way
[40:35] amen
[40:36] hallelujah glory to god hallelujah
[40:39] remember always whatever you may
[40:42] be going through or suffering a crown
[40:45] awaits you at the end of your
[40:49] life's race you may be weary
[40:52] some saints may feel like giving up
[40:56] you might feel like letting go
[41:01] my friends sin may have grabbed a hold
[41:04] of you
[41:07] but every look you took a jesus
[41:10] one look will take away the weight of
[41:13] that sin
[41:15] one look will encourage you in your
[41:18] life's way
[41:20] one look will put you back on track
[41:24] for the glory of god so that you will
[41:26] have the strength
[41:28] to endure and to finish
[41:31] the race well and to cross
[41:34] that finish line and
[41:37] get to the lord jesus christ be a
[41:40] finisher
[41:42] not a starter only but be a finisher
[41:45] of the race i want to emphasize that oh
[41:48] there are many who started in the race
[41:51] but look around you where are they today
[41:54] oh
[41:55] i've seen that when i was
[41:58] just a teenager
[42:02] one of the olympic stars
[42:05] came to uh my old country
[42:09] of guyana and there
[42:13] he trained with a young man
[42:16] who was the champion in his field in
[42:19] that country
[42:20] and he had heard of him so
[42:24] leaving where he was he came to
[42:27] train or to teach this young man who
[42:30] later
[42:30] went on to the united states and
[42:33] received a scholarship there
[42:35] for he was so very good but one thing
[42:39] is that this man came and
[42:42] trained with us and show to us
[42:46] it's not by working up your
[42:49] your strength and working up yourself
[42:52] but
[42:52] being relaxed knowing what you're doing
[42:55] and being
[42:56] confident in what you're doing and
[42:58] pressing on
[43:00] the upward way glory to god hallelujah
[43:03] my brothers my sisters therefore
[43:07] as the scripture says leaving the
[43:10] principles
[43:12] the drop the principles of the doctrine
[43:14] of christ
[43:15] let us go on to perfection
[43:18] let us not go again laying again the
[43:21] foundations
[43:22] of repentance from dead works and faith
[43:25] towards god
[43:27] oh how we need in this journey
[43:31] to find a place where we can rest in the
[43:34] grace of god
[43:36] and feast upon the word of god
[43:40] oh praise god we because friends
[43:43] we are engaged in a great battle it's a
[43:46] race and yet it's a battle
[43:49] enemies all around you satan may be
[43:52] running trying to get you out of your
[43:55] lane or
[43:56] or to use the spikes on the shoe to
[43:59] to make sure that you are wounded or in
[44:02] some way
[44:03] to slow you up praise god hallelujah
[44:07] but thank god we are engaged in this
[44:10] great race of the human race
[44:14] and we have heard the call amen
[44:17] start runners get online
[44:20] bang off goes the race and
[44:23] now brother sister we must endure
[44:27] in this race for the glory of god and
[44:29] it's time
[44:30] for us to come into spiritual maturity
[44:34] a time for us to leave the things which
[44:36] are behind
[44:38] and to press on into spiritual
[44:41] maturity we have played around and
[44:44] frolicked a long time
[44:46] along with this message and this word of
[44:49] god and we're going to have to put away
[44:51] childish things put away worldly things
[44:54] put away just these light shallow things
[44:58] and and enter into true spiritual
[45:02] maturity that god wants us to have
[45:05] and really get down to business
[45:08] for the glory of god
[45:11] yes true my friends
[45:14] god has this way of doing things
[45:18] and we must stay in god's way of doing
[45:21] things
[45:22] we are not a denominated people we are
[45:24] not nominal
[45:25] church people or organizational people
[45:29] but we are the people of god
[45:32] and we are to stay in god's way and
[45:34] god's plan
[45:35] and walk in god's provided way
[45:39] not to be sloppy not to be careless
[45:43] oh but to be diligent be be
[45:46] diligent be perseverant praise god
[45:49] in god's way hebrews 6 11 says
[45:52] we desire every one of you that you show
[45:55] the same diligence
[45:57] and the full assurance of hope
[46:00] until the end lord of god hallelujah
[46:03] oh praise god paul says here in the word
[46:07] of god
[46:07] hold unswervingly to the hope we profess
[46:11] for you who has promised is
[46:14] faithful let us draw near to god
[46:17] with a sincere heart in the full
[46:19] assurance
[46:20] of faith so we need to persevere
[46:24] so that when we have done the will of
[46:26] god we will receive the
[46:28] what he has promised the praise he has
[46:32] promised
[46:33] once we have endured to the end and
[46:36] proven
[46:37] to be finishers with the lord
[46:41] now paul speaks to us
[46:44] and he tells us a whole host of men if
[46:47] you were to read hebrews chapter 11
[46:49] it tells of many like moses
[46:52] and and abraham manoah
[46:56] and jacob and joseph and
[47:00] many others of the prophets that hell
[47:03] took
[47:04] god's unchanging hand of his word
[47:07] as was revealed to that day
[47:11] and the majority of the people rejected
[47:14] the word of god for
[47:16] that day but for those who endured to
[47:19] the
[47:20] end and were finishers they finished
[47:23] their race
[47:24] holding to god's unchanging hand
[47:27] and now they are the witnesses
[47:32] who will inspire us to finish our race
[47:36] onto glory now we know
[47:40] that these believers in paul's day were
[47:45] mocked and scoffed at as apostates from
[47:48] god
[47:49] they were called renegades that left the
[47:53] faith of moses
[47:55] they were accused of abandoning
[47:58] the law of moses they were accused of
[48:03] forfeiting
[48:04] their old testament promises
[48:08] all praise god but against that
[48:11] dark background that they had
[48:15] paul warned them of the spiritual
[48:18] neglect of spiritual unbelief
[48:22] of disobedience immaturity
[48:26] and rejection of the word he told them
[48:29] hold to god's unchanging hand
[48:33] and he will see you through to the very
[48:35] end
[48:36] no matter what others say what other
[48:38] mock
[48:39] what whatever they said about the
[48:41] patriarch or the prophet
[48:43] or all of god's promises
[48:46] for this day hold to god's unchanging
[48:49] hand
[48:50] for he changes not praise god hallelujah
[48:54] amen there are saints that have gone
[48:56] before us
[48:58] they're on the grandstands of glory and
[49:01] as we are
[49:02] running the race they are cheering us on
[49:05] they're
[49:06] encouraging us on run run with
[49:09] patience the race that is set before you
[49:12] brother and
[49:12] bisco many years ago i say this over and
[49:15] over

[49:19] and in it he made the term he said
[49:22] listen we are the last church age

[49:29] ones that are left to run
[49:30] therefore run run with patience the race
[49:34] that is set before you

[50:04] until you reach the finish line in the
[50:07] power of jesus christ
[50:09] amen hallelujah i'll tell your friends
[50:11] you're listening to me now
[50:14] and back then they listened to paul
[50:17] but you are here listening to me today
[50:22] and judaism was deeply embedded
[50:27] it was culturally embedded and
[50:29] religiously
[50:30] embedded by tradition
[50:34] but instead today you might be listening
[50:37] to me
[50:38] and you're coming from a culture a
[50:40] background
[50:41] a religious reference point you're
[50:44] coming
[50:44] out of that background of roman
[50:48] catholicism
[50:49] hinduism buddhism paganism
[50:53] muhammadanism spiritualism or even
[50:57] d nami nationalism and
[51:00] i am bringing the word of god for you
[51:03] to be able to see clearly that god wants
[51:06] you
[51:06] not to be any of those things but to be
[51:09] a christian
[51:10] a real christian from the bottom
[51:13] of your heart amen praise god hallelujah
[51:17] you may be listening today and you may
[51:21] have been a christian
[51:22] even a believer a follower of this
[51:25] message
[51:25] but your steps have been slowing down oh
[51:29] many who start in the race many you
[51:32] who begin to slow down in the pace
[51:36] many who are stalling on their road
[51:39] matter of fact they've come to the point
[51:42] like peter
[51:43] when uh he said oh i'm going back
[51:46] fishing
[51:47] i'm going to find a good place where i
[51:49] can go and
[51:50] and fish and and by fishing i'll forget
[51:54] i'll forget about the lord i'll forget
[51:56] about serving him i'll forget about the
[51:58] tests of
[51:59] forget about the trial i'll forget about
[52:01] the endurance i'll forget about
[52:03] all of these things but oh let us not be
[52:07] like him because we know that peter only
[52:11] went fishing for a while
[52:13] and then he heard the voice of god and
[52:15] realized
[52:16] that he could not fish for fish he had
[52:19] to fish for man
[52:20] may god help you today that you may
[52:24] recognize that your greater call is for
[52:27] god to use you
[52:28] as a fisher of men praise god
[52:32] as the roadblocks mount
[52:35] as your problems begin to melt up
[52:39] as your fate seems unproductive
[52:43] as doors begin to slam in your face
[52:47] you begin to find it easier and easier
[52:50] to start
[52:51] beginning to think about quitting
[52:54] doors may slim in your face
[52:58] and you may easily think about quitting
[53:01] in this personal private race that you
[53:04] have
[53:05] with the human race the race the glory
[53:09] the race to jesus christ
[53:13] but i'm here today to remind you like
[53:17] paul like the prophet who went before
[53:21] that you must put jesus first
[53:24] let him have the supremacy in your life
[53:28] and let him have the excellency that
[53:31] only jesus christ
[53:33] can give there's no stronger inducement
[53:37] or in our excitement or enticement to
[53:42] stay in the race
[53:43] but to fix your eyes on jesus looking
[53:47] onto jesus
[53:48] the author and the finisher of your face
[53:51] for he shows the example
[53:53] who endured the faith endured the cross
[53:56] endure the garden of gethsemane
[53:58] endured all the the things and he was
[54:01] not guilty
[54:02] we were guilty but by his grace he has
[54:05] set us free
[54:06] set us an example that look i i
[54:10] made it i am a finisher and all my
[54:12] children
[54:13] will make it through no matter what
[54:16] trial what trouble
[54:17] what tribulation satan puts against them
[54:20] they'll make it true for i am in them
[54:24] i am the conqueror i am the overcomer
[54:27] i am the mighty one i am
[54:30] he the same yesterday today
[54:34] and forever and listen to our scripture
[54:37] we we are compass with so great a cloud
[54:39] of witnesses
[54:41] let us lay aside every weight
[54:45] and the sin which though so easily beset
[54:48] us
[54:49] and let us run with patience
[54:52] the race that is set before us
[54:56] looking unto jesus the author
[54:59] and finisher of our faith who for the
[55:02] joy that was set before him
[55:04] endured the cross despised
[55:08] in the shame and is set down at the
[55:11] right hand of god
[55:12] for considering him that endured such
[55:16] contradiction of sinners against himself
[55:19] lest you be wearied and
[55:22] faint in your mind my beloved friends my
[55:26] brothers my sisters in christ
[55:28] let us run our race to glory in life
[55:32] let us run in close communion in
[55:35] connection
[55:36] with god true prayer
[55:40] through our constant communication
[55:43] with him let us allow god's word
[55:47] to take command and control
[55:50] and become the governor within our lives
[55:54] and let us do that by worshiping him
[55:57] praising him giving him all the glory
[56:00] every step
[56:01] of the way loving our brethren
[56:05] annoying and serving our lord and master
[56:08] the lord jesus christ and better and
[56:12] better each day
[56:14] let him be a constant daily companion
[56:19] and let him be our guide in our hearts
[56:22] and made in our lives
[56:24] remember we are finishers and i remember
[56:27] as a finisher everything must be
[56:31] finished well
[56:32] when it's been woodworking or whether it
[56:34] be in
[56:35] running it must be finished perfectly
[56:39] and if you're going to be a finish
[56:40] finisher friends
[56:42] not just starting in the race i
[56:44] reiterate this
[56:46] there are many who have started in the
[56:48] race
[56:50] oh but with the trials on the test
[56:53] they failed to keep pace others accept
[56:57] this message
[56:58] this word this for promise of this hour
[57:01] all because it was new but i want to
[57:04] tell you today
[57:06] give it a second look a third look a
[57:07] fourth look and you'll see something
[57:10] different
[57:11] making itself made manifest and say lord
[57:14] jesus
[57:15] i started the race i fell along the way
[57:18] i stopped along the way i stalled along
[57:21] the way
[57:23] but with jesus help with god's help i
[57:26] will i can i will go through
[57:31] resting upon jesus my lord
[57:34] and master may he grant his blessing
[57:38] to every heart and every life that is
[57:41] confessing and repenting and
[57:43] re-consecrating
[57:45] itself to him even right now while i'm
[57:47] speaking
[57:48] and even long after this broadcast is
[57:51] over

[57:55] god and ask him for a new start
[57:58] and new beginning and this time
