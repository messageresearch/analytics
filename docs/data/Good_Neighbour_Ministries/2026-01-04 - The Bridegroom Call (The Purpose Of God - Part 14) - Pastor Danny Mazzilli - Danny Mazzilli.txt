It's real. &gt;&gt; Praise God. What a what a day this is. Amen. Sister Marcia is going to sing for us. All right. So, you guys ready for that? By the way, we've had such beautiful specials the other night uh last Wednesday night from different ones. All the young ones, you know who you are. It ain't going to be another year from that we hear from you, right? We're going to hear from you over and over and over again, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. And Sister Marcia is going to kick it off. Father, we ask you to bless the offering this morning. Um, we thank you, Lord, that you are meeting our every need as you promised you would. We thank you that you're a ver ever very present help in the time of trouble and that you will uh you're a sustainer of your people. Lord, just bless the offering. In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask it. Amen. God bless you as you give and just be faithful to him. Amen. Don't worry about it. Hey, we're not a bride that's supposed to worry. You know that, huh? Speaking to myself now. We're not a bride that's supposed to worry. So, all right, Sister Mar. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless you, saints. Often, um, sometimes before I sing, the Lord will lay down my heart to share what brought me to standing here at this moment. And today, by his grace and for his glory, for his honor, I'd like to share this experience. And you know what it is? It lead back to um in anticipation of the New Year Eve service. You know, as uh we would often do as those of us who've been called to minister in song, you know, we go before the Lord and we ask him, "Lord, could you give me a song that you'd like me to share with your children, right? We we do take it um holy and and and and consecratedly." So, you know, a couple days leading up to the service, I was listening and just praying and seeking God and he dropped a song in my heart and then I'm still like, "Okay, God, is that the one? Do you want me to do that one?" You know, and still praying through and everything. But then, you know, just life between work and, you know, everything else. I exactly I wasn't quite prepared and you know, the songs, the words, I was trying to change some of the lyrics because I wasn't fully identifying with some of it. And you know, I was just having challenges. I was trying to find a track because it's like we didn't wouldn't have practiced with the musicians. And through all of that, it's like the Lord kept telling me the song the thong. But in the end, I'm like, Lord, please could you just allow me to not sing this time. And of course, we, you know, sometimes we speak to him and we try to like negotiate, right, a little bit. And he says to me, "But what if the song will tie in with the message? I need my children to hear the song." And I'm like, Lord, then if it will tie in with the message, then it'll be a real confirmation that I was supposed to sing it. That's what I'm saying to myself, right? In consolation. So, I didn't sing, you know, on Wednesday night for New Year's Eve, but I was so blessed and I'm so glad that the mic talked about the other specials because we thank God for every gift. They were amazing, right? But of course, in my heart, now what happens? Our dareth precious pastor come and minister his word on Joshua and Caleb. Give me that mountain, right? And give me my mountain at the title of the service, right? And the song he placed on my heart is this. Sometimes it takes a mountain. And I'm like, okay, Lord, I get it. I know. So, that being said, two things that I've received out of this. And what I'm encouraging you all to do is once more, please as you pray, remember to pray for us in our ministry by the grace of God that he's given us. You can pray intentionally for us because we don't just choose a song. We don't just come up here. It's by the grace of God, right? And so I pray that you would please pray for us. Remember us in your prayers and trust that God would lead us because sometimes he'll give us a song, but then we're also discerning his heart and say, "Lord, is this the time to give that song?" So we're always speaking to him and so we pray that you please you know bathe us in your prayers that his anointing would come upon us more and more and we would be a blessing. So that's the one thing. So please keep us in prayer and then also now that the Lord has given us a revelation of what the mountain it is that we're facing. I pray that this song because even now it means even more to me now having received the word on Wednesday night. So as I'm about to share the song that in full transparency we haven't even practiced together. We just did the verse, the chorus, but we're trusting the Lord to lead us through it. Amen. So, keep us in prayer as we pray, and we pray that this song will truly be a blessing to your heart today. Amen. God bless you all. I [Music] never faced before. [Music] That's why I'm calling on you, Lord. I know it's been a while. But Lord, please hear my prayer. I need you like I never have before. [Music] Sometimes it takes a mountain. Sometimes a troubled fear [Music] from time to take a death to get a hold of me. [Music] But your love is so much stronger than whatever trles me. Sometimes it takes a mountain to trust you and believe. [Music] Forgive me, Jesus. I thought I could control whatever life has thrown my way. But this I will admit have brought me to my knees. I need you, Lord. And I'm not ashamed to fail. From time they take a mountain. And from time to trouble feed time it takes a death to get a hold of me. Oh Lord, your love is so much stronger [Music] than whatever trles me. But sometime it takes the mountain to trust you and leave. Oh, from time beneath a mountain. From time for trouble fe and from time it takes a death just to get a hold of me. Lord, your love, your love is so much stronger [Music] than whatever [Music] trles me from time to take a mountain to trust you with. [Music] Oh, some time it may take that mountain, but faith just trust him and believe. [Music] Amen. [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Who's taking their mountain? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I'm casting all my cares on you. I know you love me. [Music] It's redemption by blood. That's the greatest love story. Oh, it's for restoration, for redemption. Seven angels in a cloud testify. My redeemer's no longer dead. He's risen. And he's coming back for you and me. Come on. Oh, I am casting all my cares on you. Oh, I know you love me, Lord. Come on. Here it is. Here. Oh, it's redemption by Mary. Amen. That's the greatest. Glory. Come on. [Music] Seven angels. My redeemer on the dead. He's risen and he's coming back for you and me. Amen. Glory. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Redemption by marriage. [Music] &gt;&gt; That's That's what's happening, saints. We're right in line this morning. Amen. Praise God. The Lord is so good. God bless you, saints. Thank you, singers. Thank you. Wonderful songs of worship. Praise God to get us into that atmosphere where we can receive the word. &gt;&gt; That's why we've come this morning. Happy New Year to every one of you. Welcome to uh those that weren't with us. God bless you, Brother Carson, Sister Sharon. Happy New Year to you. Praise God. And uh we're so happy to enter a new year with thanksgiving in our hearts to be able to move under the inspiration of the word of God. Amen. How many wants to go into 2026 inspired? &gt;&gt; Amen. So that uh that the anointing can give us discernment on things that are happening around us. This is what it is to to be a Christian and to walk with Christ is to recognize your day. recognize the things that are taking place around you. Amen. Praise God. So, we certainly appreciated um the uh watch service and um all of the testimonies. Uh you know, every year we try to get one individual to come and bring their testimony on how the Lord came into their lives and awaken them to their calling, to their position. Amen. And we heard from sister Deborah Beers and uh you know how it included brother Tim and their their uh um you know conversion to the Lord and God's timing is just remarkable and it's just wonder. Listen, the greatest miracles that you will ever witness not going to be somebody being raised from the dead. They could be raised from the dead and then go right back to the bar. &gt;&gt; Okay? It's irrelevant. Signs and wonders are for the purpose of attracting the people to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so the greatest miracle that you will witness is when somebody receives the word &gt;&gt; and they who were living passionately for the things of the world. thought that you know or being trapped by the things of the world like we heard you know brother Tim's testimony of you know being being uh you know in that accident and then coming under such a a an emotional imbalance and anxiety in his life he couldn't do things but and then and then here now the word comes &gt;&gt; amen the word comes &gt;&gt; oh right at the right time and and all of a sudden wow what a change glory to God you can look back at your own life. I know I can look back in my own life. You should be able to see that when the word came, &gt;&gt; not some church, you know, uh, emotional come to the altar and cry and then go right back into the world again the same way that you were, maybe even worse. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The greatest miracle is a life that's transformed by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And my desire is that 2026 will be the greatest year ever for you &gt;&gt; in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. If your desired is to to draw closer to God and and to have his purpose live through your lives, I believe that you'll have the greatest year ever. Amen. Um we want to remember the saints in Venezuela. I was in touch with brother George Smith yesterday and um you know he uh he says that the people there are are very very happy you know because they've been under a tremendous amount of bondage and dictatorship with these uh you know with the with the leaders that were in place and so they're they're expecting that things are going to get better there that somehow you know by the grace of God um they're going to be able to have some you know normal kind of life they've been under uh severe shortages of water. And you know, I was listening to brother George, you know, talk about these things live about three weeks ago. He was ministering. They they had him come and minister and share his testimony. And he was talking about Venezuela. It's a great, you know, burden on his heart. And immediately, you know, I felt that, you know, we we need to support that and help the people in Venezuela. And so we were able right then we immediately I said brother Mike we need to send some funds for brother George for Venezuela and look at two two weeks later look what's going on you know and and brother George is very grateful. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we want to do more if we can. &gt;&gt; So don't be shy if you feel you can give $5. It goes a long way in Venezuela. &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't be shy. Let's do what we can to continue to to help them um so that they can now come out and the saints there. There's saints there. Amen. And so we want to see God just uh you know help them and and uh help the people there, even the the people of Venezuela. So let's keep them in prayer. Um we're going to go to the word of God now. Um so if there's anybody that has a request, maybe you can just lift your hand unto the Lord and say, "Lord, remember me. Father, what a wonderful privilege it is this morning, Lord. It's you're just it's just your grace, Father, that we stand here this morning and lift our hands to a living God who is mindful and is aware of his people. And Lord, this morning there are many that have a need. Lord, you see every uplifted hand. And Lord, we see the hearts of the the needs of the people in Venezuela through our precious brother George. Uh Father, may you just go and minister to that country now as it is in it is in great turmoil, Father. And it's going to take your hand now to come and and uh direct and guide the leadership and even the US that's gone in there, Lord, that are going to take control of the country. Father, may you intercede in such a way, Lord. Remember your own, Father. Remember the sons and daughters of God. Remember the people, Lord, even the general public. May you meet their needs. May there be a way to to get them the necessities of of food and and and water and the things that they've been so short on. Lord, may you just help them, Father. We pray. And Lord, as we go to the word this morning, we ask that your spirit and your grace and your anointing will come. And Lord, just help me, Father. Lord, I realize uh there's only so much that any minister can do, Lord. But with you, Father, if you come and anoint your word and you make it and give it life to the hearts of the people, it changes lives. &gt;&gt; It transforms, Father. That is what the word, that's what you came to do, Lord, to transform us back to our purpose as sons and daughters of God. Grant it now we pray in Jesus name. Amen. Let's read our scripture. Revelations 22:1 17 says, "And the spirit and the bride say come, and let him that heareth say come, and let him that are thirst come." And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. Amen. The Lord add his blessings to the word. You may be seated. We we are staying on the um series that we've you know been going over the last three months or so on you know the purpose of God and the adoption series and um uh you know adoption is about placing sons and daughters of God. It's about bringing them to maturity, bringing them to a realization of who they really are. Amen. That's what the word is doing for us in this day and in this hour. And um today um we want to continue on the on the the you know calling of the sons and daughters of God. When you hear sons of God, you know that it includes daughters also. Um but we want to focus on in that calling of the sons of God. We want to we want to take a title today for the uh as the bridegroom call. Amen. The bridegroom call. Because in the midst of God calling his sons and daughters, it's him that's calling. It's the voice of God that's calling. It's the voice of our beloved that's calling. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's God's word that calls sons and daughters. It's God's word that dresses the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's God's word that comes in to the bride. Amen. Praise God. You know, today in the Christian church world, you know, there there's so many that are proclaiming and all of them are proclaiming salvation that comes through Jesus Christ. And this is true and it's wonderful because there is no other way to come to Christ. &gt;&gt; It's only through Jesus Christ that you can come to God. Amen. To come to realize salvation. Amen. We see signs on the roads. Uh believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved. We see signs on the churches on their church bulletins. We see them everywhere. But do they know the truth? Are they preaching the truth? Do you know the truth? what you're hearing is it is it resonating within you back to the word of God. Amen. Which teaching is is right? Which teaching is wrong? There's thousands of denominations out there now. &gt;&gt; You've got all kinds of different interpretations on the word of God. Men, you know, all it takes is one or, you know, one person to come up with an idea. have one person follow him starts to draw other people and they can create a denomination. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; that's actually the definition of a denomination is when you get somebody to believe your teaching, your interpretation, your port, you know what you believe the word is saying and you become a denomination and now you've got all kinds thousands of them. &gt;&gt; How do you know which one is the truth? If your salvation is based on the church that you belong to, then are you sure that you're in the right church? Could it be based on, you know, could that church be based on man's traditions, man's doctrines, man's ideas? You've got new age movement. You've got all kinds. And they include Jesus. &gt;&gt; They include Jesus. &gt;&gt; But do they know him? Do they know him? He said, "I am the word. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word was God. &gt;&gt; And the word is God. &gt;&gt; And the word is made flesh. &gt;&gt; In every dispensation, in every time and season, it's always been the word." Amen. So if your if your salvation is based on the church that you belong to, then are you sure that the church is preaching the truth? Are you associated to the church because your mother and your father were members of the church or their grandparents were members of the church? &gt;&gt; Because you know like you you talk to a lot of your friends, many of them are are Catholic and you ask them, "Why are you a Catholic?" Well, because I was brought up a Catholic. I went to a Catholic school. My parents were Catholics. I went to church twice a year like they did Christmas and Easter. &gt;&gt; I got baptized. WERE YOU BAPTIZED? YEAH, I GOT baptized when when I was a baby. You see, but is it scriptural? &gt;&gt; And this is the thing. And that's why there's a lot of of of uh voices out there &gt;&gt; that are proclaiming salvation through Jesus Christ, but they're leading them to man's ideas, man's teachings, man's interpretations. &gt;&gt; We're not interested in that. The Lord is just, and the only way that he can truly judge anyone, it would have to be by his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. because he does not change. &gt;&gt; Amen. What he said in the beginning holds to the end. God does not change his mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Listen, the word says in Acts 2:38, "Repent every one of you." Every one of you. He was identifying not repent family. Repent all you church together. No. every one of you. &gt;&gt; You see, this is a personal revelation and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin, &gt;&gt; unbelief, things that you know, you you know, because when the word comes, it it awakens you to the truth &gt;&gt; to recognize, wait a minute, I've been believing in a lie all along. That's what that's what happens to to anybody that receives the word for their day. They're going to realize they were living a lie. I don't care how close &gt;&gt; they can be. &gt;&gt; If there's one ounce of lie in there, &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about you being perfect. The word is perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember, so that's why we don't claim anything but the word. We listen, if I'm going to claim anything, I'm not going to claim my own righteousness because I'm going down. &gt;&gt; I'm claiming the righteousness of Christ. He says, I'm going to place that in you. I've I've accepted his righteousness, &gt;&gt; his life. &gt;&gt; That's why he came to die for me. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that I can proclaim salvation. &gt;&gt; My salvation is in Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not in the church. &gt;&gt; It's not in the teachings. &gt;&gt; It's not in the doctrines. It's in Christ the word. &gt;&gt; And look at he goes on to say here, I know this is all foundation, but I'm laying in something here. No, he says, listen, once you hear the truth and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, for the promise is unto you. &gt;&gt; There it is again. It's unto you and to your children &gt;&gt; and to all that are a far off. &gt;&gt; Even as many as the Lord our God shall &gt;&gt; call. &gt;&gt; Who's calling? &gt;&gt; It's him calling. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; My sheep hear &gt;&gt; my voice. &gt;&gt; I want to hear the bridegroom call. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to recognize what the bridegroom call is all about &gt;&gt; because there's a lot of them calling out there saying, "Hey, come to this church. Christ is here. You can hear the word here." But yet they're teaching trinitarian doctrine. As many as the Lord our God shall call. And that's what we want to look at today. The bridegroom call. His call is his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's him. Remember, he is the word. Amen. My sheep hear my voice. It's about you recognizing that voice tells you that you are a son of God. &gt;&gt; When you hear the word of God, it's sure it's going to it's going to it's going to expose your sin. You're going to realize that you're a sinner. But the moment that you follow the instruction, repent, be baptized for the remission of your sin, you receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You know what the Holy Ghost is? Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word, the the the the the supernatural power that gives you the ability to overcome any situation that you presently face. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost will do for every single individual. &gt;&gt; Changes your whole purpose. You're walking this way. Now you're walking that way. &gt;&gt; And now you're not just walking alone, but you're walking with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's read our scripture here. Our next scripture, Matthew 25:es 1 to4. He says, "Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto 10 virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom, and five of them were wise, and five were foolish. They that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them. But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps." Now I want you to notice here there were 10 virgins. These are the these are what like virgins according to the kingdom and Christ is the one that's speaking this parable. Okay. He's talking about those that are virgins to to Christ. They're actually there was 10 of them expecting the coming bridegroom. They all had their lamps. Amen. But notice, five had oil, five didn't. Amen. And so, where did they take it from? They It says they took oil. Listen, the bride, once you've received Christ, you receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's the oil. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't lose that oil. &gt;&gt; That oil is eternal because he is eternal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we're going to look at this scripture. We're going to draw from it some some context here that that is going to give us a clear understanding of this this this parable here. They had it. They had tapped into it when they initially heard the call and and repented and received the word for their day. &gt;&gt; The foolish had the oil because it was offered to them and they actually rejected it. They may have been baptized in it. They may have had experiences in it like Pentecost. And a lot of people, they can come into church and the anointing will come down and the people will feel the anointing and feel the the the the the presence of the spirit of God. But that's a baptism that's on them. &gt;&gt; This one said they had oil in their vessels. &gt;&gt; It was in them. and their lamps. When they trimmed their lamps, it's because they were they were they were they were trimming the fire that was already lit in them. &gt;&gt; There's Listen, when you've come to the Holy Ghost, THERE'S A FIRE IN you that that that doesn't go out. Amen. &gt;&gt; One thing I can promise you, you can have down days, you can have hard battles, you can face trials, you can listen, but the moment that you get into the house of the Lord or the moment you start to read the word or the moment you start to listen to a message, something something comes alive inside of you. What is it? It's that wick that's been lit. Sometimes it GETS A LITTLE LOW, BUT ONCE THE WORD COMES, which is the oil, it just flames up again. All of a sudden, fire starts to brew inside of you. &gt;&gt; You see, you see these the the the the the five wise virgins, they knew who they were. &gt;&gt; They they knew exactly who they were. Remember the oils of the Holy Ghost. Let's read the next verse here. Verse 6 to8. He says, "While the bridegroom terried, they all slumbered and slept. And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him." Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said unto the wise, "Give us of your oil. For our lamps are gone out." See, they went into a revival. They got excited, but then they they just went right back asleep again back into the world. There wasn't actual representation in them. though they are Christians, though they are churchgoers, though they claim Christ, they they they they they pray, they do all those things, but there's lacking the Holy Ghost, the the actual uh presence of God in their lives, personal that when they hear that call, when they hear that word, it just revives them instantly. instantly. &gt;&gt; They're not asleep anymore. &gt;&gt; Yes, we've been, you know, we've been in a in in a long period of time here. People like to take this scripture and they like to apply it to the whole church world. Today, I want Yeah, it does apply to the church world, but they missed it about 62, three years ago. &gt;&gt; Amen. And until they recognize it, they're not going to recognize what the reality of this scripture is talking about and who the bridegroom is. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And where he is right now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so here now these these, you know, they they all all the virgins arose, trimmed their lamps, and the foolish said unto the wise, "Give us of your oil, for our lamps are gone out." But the wise answered, saying, "Not so, lest there be not enough for us and you." But go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves. You know, when I read that, I say, "Wow." You know, the church has become a big business. &gt;&gt; You've got churches out there that got 10,000 people, 20,000 people. You can go in there, you can lay an offering at the table, and they'll let you come up and give a testimony. They'll let you come and share h how much money you gave to the kingdom and and all the all the things that that that you you know think that you you can't buy God. &gt;&gt; You can't buy God. &gt;&gt; You cannot give uh you know in order for God to give you favor. &gt;&gt; The only thing you can give to God is your life. &gt;&gt; That's it. Because he gave his. &gt;&gt; He laid his life down for us. The only thing we can do is pick up our cross and follow him. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the only life that we can give. But come under the leadership of of the spirit of God. Come under the anointing of a ministry that is under the open book revelation of what God is doing in this hour. Come under that kind of teaching and that leadership. And now as you are led by the spirit when you give you now now you're giving by revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you're under his leadership under his direction. Now he looks at you and looks at your your calling and your placing in the word of God. Some are going to be called to be successful business people that God will use in order to uh provide funds for the ministry in order to provide for missions to send out missionaries to to you know build uh churches where they're needed to do. It's now you're coming under the leadership and the and the purpose of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a big difference. &gt;&gt; But it starts with coming to the word first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Understanding that you that you're now a part of the word and you are part of what the body of Christ is doing now today. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you can't buy. They said, "You, you know, you might as well go try try and buy because because people they they go to church thinking that that okay, if I do this, then God will do that." &gt;&gt; That's a very, you know, that's that's a a works a works uh kind of attitude. So, if I go and I give to to the to the church, then God is going to bless me. If I go and light 50 candles for all of my my my my uh brothers and sisters and my cousins who died years ago, then God is going to make a way for them out of purgatory. You see, like it's it's nonsense. God is not in any of that. God is in his word. &gt;&gt; And it's simple. Repent. Receive the Holy Ghost. You shall be led by the spirit of God to all truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's simply you know you know in in a nutshell when the Holy Ghost comes in you it's going to take you to the word. &gt;&gt; So here now while the bridegroom terried and listen we've come through 63 years. It seems like the bridegroom has been ting to a lot of people. 63 years. Lot of message churches all over the world and they're all, you know, waiting on the coming of the Lord. And I'm telling you that there's 50%, you know, just going by the scripture here, five of them, which is 50% were were were foolish &gt;&gt; and 50% were wise. And so Christianity started over 2,000 years ago. We've come through all the seven church ages building up the body of Christ. But remember, it's not until the bridegroom calls in the seventh church age that this call actually is announced to bring the bride to the rapture. Amen. All through the seven church ages, Christians were were waiting on the second coming of the Lord to do what? Redeem so that he could come and redeem his bride. That hasn't fully completed yet. The redemption is complete in the rapture. That's when redemption is complete. When he comes for his own to reconcile back to himself. Jesus' first coming was to restore Adam and to pay the price of redemption. The second coming is to restore Eve and to to take Eve and bring her into her sunship in Christ so that Christ and his bride are one. What it say in Colossians 1:20? and having made peace through the blood of the cross. Made peace through the blood of the in other words uh paid the price. Okay. By by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him. Who's doing it? He's doing it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, I say, whether they be in be things in earth or things in heaven, he's talking about every son and daughter of God from the beginning of time that have followed and that have been that have died in their age. many Christians that died in in each of those seven church ages and even before the o even in the Old Testament, David, Abraham, Sarah, all those uh patriarchs, all those that were that that that God was the word for that particular day, they needed to wait until Christ came in the first coming so that they could be portaled &gt;&gt; into that sixth dimension. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they're all waiting there. &gt;&gt; Every son and daughter of God's waiting there. &gt;&gt; You know, uh, even through the seven church ages, you wonder about those Christians that died, you know, in the lion's dens and and, you know, were burnt at the cross all through the dark ages. Every single one of them when they died, they went immediately. If they were sons and daughters, attributes of God in that particular age, they immediately went to their theophony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In that sixth dimension, &gt;&gt; that's why the prophet when he went there, he saw all the theophies that were there &gt;&gt; and and and he says, "Who are all these people?" &gt;&gt; He says he says, "They're they're they're your people. You mean they're all brandoms?" No, he says, "They're all your converts." &gt;&gt; Those that had received the word under his dispensation. and had received the word in all the previous dispensations &gt;&gt; there. There's going to be a great meeting in the air. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In that other dimension, but we're still here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we as long as we're here, we're either going to go by death naturally or by the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is this is the the the the season that we're in now. You got to recognize that it's Eve now that's being restored. It's the bride. It's the portion of God that is in female form. It's I know it's but listen, it wasn't Adam that named Eve and gave her her name. You know that, right? It wasn't God that gave Eve her name. It was Adam that named Eve &gt;&gt; and said, "Her name shall be called Eve, for she now is the mother of all living." It was after, Go back and read it, Genesis chapter 3. It was right there. And Adam called his his wife's name Eve because she was the mother of all living. And that was right after the the the sin took place, &gt;&gt; Genesis 3. &gt;&gt; Okay? God did not call them uh call her Eve. In Genesis 5:1, it says, "This is the book of the generations of Adam in the day that God created man in the likeness of God made he him, male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name Adam." He never said Adam and Eve. Adam. So Eve today when she comes into a full realization of who she's married to, her name is Jesus. &gt;&gt; It's him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Called their name Adam in the day that they were created. So they were all so so here now we need to understand that that uh God is now restoring his wife. Okay. the part of him that was in female form when he was originally created in his image of God. Adam was in the image of God. He was God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. So now let's go back. They were all virgins means purity, sanctified vessels, all good, sincere people. They were all waiting on the coming of the Lord. The wise had oil which is the Holy Ghost. The bridegroom call was heard by all 10 virgins but only five had the Holy Ghost. Amen. Remember the translation. Okay, this bridegroom call is to the translation. It's to the marriage supper. The marriage has already taken place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what took place in 1963 when the mighty angel came down. It was Christ coming to meet with his body. Let's go on. But why is it that some hear the call and most don't? Amen. The bridegroom call is the final call to the sons and daughters of God in this dispensation. the adopted sons and daughters of God that have been placed according to the word for the rapture, for the translation. Amen. Now, others are hearing what you hear. One says, "Glory to God." The other one says, "What's the matter with you?" You see, it's the same word. We're all reading from the same Bible. But yet, some are hearing and some are not. Some have ears to hear, some can't hear a thing. &gt;&gt; It's because the word of God is a love letter. And listen, if I write a love letter to my wife, she can read between the lines because she's got experiences wi with me, personal experiences and understanding, knows my character, understands my ways, knows that if I said something back then, I continue to say it today. She knows my character. She knows my nature. She has a revelation of me &gt;&gt; because it's been revealed to her through the experiences of revelation through an experience and a a relationship. She tells me things in secret and I tell her things in secret. It's a mystery to others when they read, but we can read between the lines. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, that's what you've been given is the ability to read between the lines. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if you take your book, right, you know, you take your Bible right now, open it up any on any page and you look at any page, what do you see between the lines? &gt;&gt; White space. &gt;&gt; You don't see anything written there. Amen. &gt;&gt; But yet when you read the same scripture &gt;&gt; and somebody else reads the same scripture &gt;&gt; to you it's alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; TO YOU THERE'S THERE'S LIFE coming through the scripture. Why? Because the Holy Ghost in you has made the the word come to life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Others when they read it, they can't read between the lines. When you open the Bible, you see exactly what the hidden element is there. The unwritten part of the word of God that can only be received by divine revelation. &gt;&gt; And this is something that the that that the wise virgin, she has she has that ability by the word and the Holy Ghost in her life. &gt;&gt; Let's read here. I just want to read something here from the message 10 virgins and the 144,000 Jews. Now, in the very beginning, remember everything's by revelation. Now, in the very beginning, Cain put an altar, made a sacrifice, worshiped, done everything that Abel done without, oh, receive it. He says, without the revelation of God. When the whole church is built on the revelation Jesus said so upon this rock I'll build my church spiritually revealed truth of the supreme deity of Jesus Christ. He said on this rock I'll build my church. Now, if God only respects your rituals, your rights as a Methodist, as a Baptist, as a Pentecostal, and so forth, if he only expects that for you to do, preach the second coming and all these other things that that that it's absolutely scriptural like Baptist, Presbyterian, and so forth does, then God is obligated to take both of them because that's all he required. But you see without revelation there's the sleeping virgin virgin and here's the wise virgin. &gt;&gt; See so so in other words divine revelation is what places you &gt;&gt; into that category. &gt;&gt; Never underestimate this saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. The bridegroom call when you can understand with the heart. It is because you can receive revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The revelation of the word gives you power over the enemy. &gt;&gt; It's revelation of knowing what God can do &gt;&gt; because you've had an experience. You've seen people lay hands on the sick and you see them recovered. &gt;&gt; You see it by experience. You know God is able to do it. &gt;&gt; You've seen it. It's been revealed to you. Even yourself. You've experienced revelation healing. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what that is? Revelation healing. &gt;&gt; It's when you receive a revelation that you're that you're healed. &gt;&gt; And regardless of the situation, regardless of the condition &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU'VE COME INTO A REVELATION OF GOD &gt;&gt; AND GOD IS MY HEALER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND SO THAT REVELATION LIVES now within me &gt;&gt; AND IT MANIFESTS WITHIN ME. IT HAS TO MANIFEST BECAUSE IT'S THE WORD. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. It's revealed only a special class of people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which are the attributes of God. I'm not saying, oh, you know, listen, you know, you got to be careful when you say a special class of people, people right away, they think, oh, what are you? Do you think you're special? Listen, if God reveals himself to me personally and I see it by by by by by manifestation, I see him working in my life. &gt;&gt; I got to consider myself special. &gt;&gt; But but do I want to do I want to, you know, declare that God, oh, God is with me. He's not with you. No, no. It's the grace of God. &gt;&gt; It's it's his grace that that that he's allowed us to see what we're seeing. Yes. &gt;&gt; We can't take like like we said, it's not by our own works. It's not going to be by our own, you know, by giving more and oh well, I gave more than everybody else. Well, well, that that's got nothing to do with it. He wants your life. &gt;&gt; Are you willing to give him that? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the attributes of God are that are those thoughts of God that were eternal that he saw you from the very beginning. He saw your image. He saw you exactly in this particular dispensation and in this age. He saw every single one of his sons and daughters. That's why it doesn't matter. I was listening to brother Brandham. He was talking about you, you know, you you're a Christian in those times where they ate them. The lions ate them up and they were the waste of the lions in the fields and and they were burnt and cut up into pieces and put but God has a spirit image of you. Amen. &gt;&gt; That from before the foundations of the world, he saw you. And when that bridegroom calls, that final call to that meeting in the air, every son and daughter of God, the in spirit form in that image that he saw in his mind is going to manifest and we are going to manifest in our theophony bodies in that dimension. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In a perfect body. &gt;&gt; Praise God. It doesn't matter how they died. IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW you die. &gt;&gt; It's irrelevant. God has a has an eternal image of who you are &gt;&gt; as an attribute of God. And so God God gives you uh revelation, gives you authority to speak the word on behalf of himself when you become his bride. &gt;&gt; My wife, she can go to the bank and clean out the bank accounts. She has authority to do that. Amen. Because she's my wife. Would she do that? &gt;&gt; I hope not. But you see, it's an authority that comes through marriage. &gt;&gt; It gives you a placing that when when you know that's why those that came to the door. Well, let's let's move on here. So our identity is revealed by our ability to receive revelation for the word of our day and actually hearken unto the bridegroom to his call. Whatever his call is telling you this morning. Yes, it's to the rapture, &gt;&gt; but maybe it's calling you to a closer walk. Maybe it's calling you to let go of certain things. You got you've gota you've got to be listening because this is this is a personal remember it's a secret between him and his bride. &gt;&gt; And every one of us has that personal walk with him. That's why when you come into the house of the Lord, you're not looking for somebody else's emotion to spark you up. You I hope to God you're not looking to me to try and and and and preach some positive uh gospel so that you can get, you know, enthusiastic about this about this message. because that's not going to do it for you. &gt;&gt; You're going to need to hear the word by revelation to stimulate you by revelation to give you spiritual stimulation so you can go out there and live this word. &gt;&gt; We don't want to see you living, you know, a a a a person on Sunday and then you're a totally different person on Monday. &gt;&gt; You if you've really truly come to Christ, you're the same all the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read the next verse. No, sorry. Did we Are we at number nine? Okay, wait a minute. Sorry. Yes, you're right. Go back to uh 8. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came. And they that were ready went in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut. Now, here's where it gets really good. &gt;&gt; Afterwards came also the other virgin, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. But he answered and said, "Verily I say unto you, I know you not." Now, he goes here. Now, this is the this is the key verse. Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of Man cometh. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. &gt;&gt; This is where this is now bringing it to our day. &gt;&gt; Amen. The son of man ministry. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Listen, notice here, brother Brandham said um uh watch therefore you for you know not um when the son of man cometh. And he also said here that that while they went to buy no sorry the scripture says while they went to buy they went in. Okay. So here now the son of man ministry. Now brother Brandham we need to we need to recognize here. I want to read the quote first. Let's read the quote. Okay. Proving his word. He says here, "Now remember that was not Jesus talking to Abraham there that could discern the thoughts in Sarah's mind behind him. That was not Jesus. He had not yet been born." &gt;&gt; But it was a man in human flesh &gt;&gt; that Abraham uh had not been born. But it was a man in human flesh that Abraham called Elohim, the great Almighty. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was God showing. And Jesus says, "As it was in the days of Sodom," now watch close. "In the days of Sodom, so will it be at the coming of the Son of Man, when the Son of Man is being revealed, not no more as a church." See, not no more. The bride is called. &gt;&gt; See, in that day, the Son of Man will be revealed what? to join the church to the head and unite the marriage of the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So when did this son of man ministry take place? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Luke 17:30. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Revelations 101 to7. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When did this son of man ministry take place? It started in 1963. &gt;&gt; Amen. This bridegroom call started in 1963. &gt;&gt; It's still in progress today. &gt;&gt; That's why there's been tarrying going on. &gt;&gt; And within that that 63 years, you've got foolish and you've got wise virgins &gt;&gt; that are that are that are within that that whole category of the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But here now the son of man ministry is Jesus Christ himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because in 1963, what was it that took place? The mighty angel came down, put one foot on the land, one on the sea, had an open book in his hand. What was he coming to do? He was coming to declare and redeem and take his possession &gt;&gt; to redeem the sons and daughters of God that were under that dispensation that we are now under. Amen. But here now, a son of man, brother Brham, &gt;&gt; was to reveal the son of man. &gt;&gt; And so when the mighty angel came down &gt;&gt; and declared the mystery of God would be finished, &gt;&gt; it was finished. &gt;&gt; It was finished. &gt;&gt; Okay. William Branam was the first fruits &gt;&gt; of the mystery of God being finished. &gt;&gt; But there were other attributes that were a part of that body &gt;&gt; that would need to receive their portion of the word &gt;&gt; so that they could come into their rightful position &gt;&gt; of the bride &gt;&gt; because it was now Christ coming down to unite with his bride. So that shout started in 1963. &gt;&gt; Second Thessalonians. &gt;&gt; The Lord himself &gt;&gt; SHALL DESCEND WITH A SHOUT. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE SHOUT? IT'S THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And the bride has heard the bridegroom's call. &gt;&gt; She's recognized his voice. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You could have been slumbering a little bit. You could have been sleeping A LITTLE BIT. YOU might have been distracted a little bit. You might have been moving into this and moving into that and MAYBE GOT A DISTRACTION HERE AND THERE. BUT WHEN THE BRIDEGROOM call &gt;&gt; comes to your heart, &gt;&gt; it awakens you immediately and there's fire. It's already burning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, go to the next quote here. He says in proving his word, the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together. [Music] &gt;&gt; There it is right there, saints. Amen. He says the church has to be the word. &gt;&gt; It has to be the word &gt;&gt; and the two unites together. And to do that, it takes the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man. &gt;&gt; Now, this is the thing a lot of people don't realize that the ministry of William Branham was to actually bring the son of man ministry &gt;&gt; to unite with the body. And the bride now united with Christ &gt;&gt; is the son of man ministry in bride form &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE BRIDE REMEMBER her name was Adam &gt;&gt; the original from the beginning &gt;&gt; and so if you are a son or a daughter of God then you've got to be God &gt;&gt; in female form &gt;&gt; you're not fully there yet you're going to be translated but this is what this word supposed to do for us. &gt;&gt; This is what the word is telling us, what it's revealing to us. It's it's it's identifying us of who we really are. That's why, you know, you could you could share this message with a thousand people, but if they are not attributes of God from the beginning, &gt;&gt; remember, he came to reconcile all things back to himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when he does that, he places in you the ministry of reconciliation &gt;&gt; where you now become him. You become his word. You become his voice. You become his feet. You become his his message. You you you are the manifestation of the word in your day. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says here and he says now the church has to be the word uh it unites together to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergyman I don't know I uh do do you see what I mean you see it's a son of man Jesus Christ come down in human flesh among us &gt;&gt; so this why I'm saying the mystery of God it was finished under this ministry when he opened those seven seals. &gt;&gt; But it's not revealed to everybody. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; It's it's only revealed to the sons and daughters of God who are his bride, his church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says here, he says, do you see what I mean? See, son of man, Jesus Christ come down in human flesh among us and will make his word so real &gt;&gt; that it'll unite the church and him as one, &gt;&gt; the bride. and then she'll go home to the wedding supper. &gt;&gt; So, when is this uniting that's been going on? It's been it's been it's in progress. &gt;&gt; It's always been in progress. &gt;&gt; And it's still in progress today. As long as any one of the sons and daughters of God are still on earth, it's in progress. BUT SHE'S ALREADY SHUT IN. &gt;&gt; SHE'S ALREADY INSIDE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; The bridegroom has made the call and she's gone in. And there are people you you wonder why people THEY'RE THEY'RE FIGHTING AGAINST THIS MESSAGE. They're fighting against, you know, they they they want to say, "Oh, you only got TO SAY WHAT THE TAPE SAY. They don't realize they're outside &gt;&gt; and we're already in." And the word is saying back to them, "I don't know you." It's that's pretty that's pretty strong. I understand that. But we need to recognize what's actually going on. &gt;&gt; If you are a son or a daughter of God, you always were a son or daughter of God. &gt;&gt; You if you were wise virgin, you always were wise virgin. &gt;&gt; You can't be foolish virgin. The foolish virgin goes into the tribulation &gt;&gt; to be purged. BUT THE WISE IS ALREADY IN She's in the word. &gt;&gt; Yo, glory to God. She's already recognized she and and all we're waiting for is to go to the supper. We're already married. &gt;&gt; Next quote here, number 11. Listen, she's already there. She's already united. See, we go to the wedding supper, NOT TO THE MARRIAGE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Fill your flesh SELF WITH ALL FLESH AND MIGHTY MEN. YOU KNOW, CALL YOURSELF WHATEVER YOU WANT CUZ the marriage OF THE LAMB HAS COME. &gt;&gt; IT'S ALREADY COME. &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE WE WAIT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING people are always LOOKING OFF FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE. ALWAYS LOOKING BACK FOR WHAT GOD HAS DONE BUT FAILING TO see what he's doing right now. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE IN YOU'RE ALREADY IN THAT THAT IN THAT YOU'RE ALREADY IN THE WEDDING SUPPER. WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE FEASTING on here this morning? &gt;&gt; You're feasting on the on the living word. You're you're drinking the stimulation of his word. You're rejoicing as the sons and daughters of God. Amen. Praise God. He says, listen, but the rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word here unites with the person and they two become one. And then what does it do to them? It manifests the son of man again, not the church theologians. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; The son of man. He says, &gt;&gt; "The word and the church becomes one." &gt;&gt; Whatever the son of man done, he was the word. The church does the same thing. &gt;&gt; The word says, "BY HIS STRIPES, I AM HEALED." &gt;&gt; That means I am the word. I receive that word. &gt;&gt; IT'S IT'S IT'S WHO I AM. &gt;&gt; I'm going to MANIFEST EVERYTHING THAT he manifested. &gt;&gt; People want to see great signs and wonders. But remember what we said at the beginning. The greatest thing that you will witness is when somebody can recognize their IDENTITY AS THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST, an attribute that was under spiritual amnesia, stuck in church denomination, stuck in the teachings of man, stuck in the new age movement. You young people, be careful of that new age movement. IT'S GETTING SO CLOSE. IT sounds so good. But the minute you bring Jesus to the focus which is the word &gt;&gt; right away they yes he reached that level of masterhip that's what we want to accomplish. He walked through the walls. That's what we want to do. He he he rose the dead. He we we we have seances. They don't realize what they're what they're what they're playing with. &gt;&gt; They don't realize that that was Satan's interpretation. &gt;&gt; Remember, Cain brought a beautiful sacrifice and made it unto the Lord, but the Lord blew it back in their face because he didn't reveal to him that it was going to be a lamb. &gt;&gt; It was going to be blood. It was going to be a life. It was going to be a sacrifice. Amen. Praise God. To bring back every son and daughter of God. She's already united. Glory to God. The two become one. They begin to display the word. They have his life on display. His revelation shows on them. They have an identity of and know their part in the word. They start to understand that greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. &gt;&gt; They have this revelation that they're walking with Christ. They have something to say under the anointed word for their day. You have something to declare. You have you God has placed in you the the the the spirit and and and the and the ministry of reconciliation. Can you imagine that you carry the word that that that whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven &gt;&gt; on in heaven. Whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. You know not everybody is going to be wise virgin. If you can identify with the word in what's being released here today as the wise virgin, it's wonderful. But not everybody's going to be able to identify with that. But is salvation still available to anybody? Did you see the scripture we read at the beginning? Let he that thirsteth come for that living life FOR FOR THE LIGHT. SO THERE'S SALVATION available to anybody, anybody out there. That's why we don't want to be bride pride. Oh, if you're not in the bride, you're lost. No, that's not what we're saying. We're saying that salvation is available through Jesus Christ. And you need to still have that mercy seat available for anybody to receive Christ. You don't know who is wise, who is foolish. You just got to let the word declare and interpret itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to Glory to God. We want Listen the two. They have something to say under the anointed word for their day. You hear it said just say what the tape say. Say what William Brandham said and nothing more. Well, you can say what he said and totally have no revelation on what he said. It's one thing to to, you know, to quote the prophet, but it's another thing to quote him by revelation &gt;&gt; because the same spirit that was on William Brham at the time is now in the bride. &gt;&gt; And so that the interpretation will always be the same if he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; We don't have to just focus on yesterday's interpretation. We can come and and understand that when a minister is anointed by the Holy Ghost and says what he says by revelation, it brings stimulation. It brings life. You know the difference when a minister is preaching stale mana &gt;&gt; as opposed to the living word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it brings life. &gt;&gt; It opens the word. All of a sudden, you start to see all the types and all the shadows through the scriptures right from Genesis to Revelation. Amen. Without Christ anointing the word that he has that he has present, you you'll not know the difference. Without God's anointing on the message, the the the word that that's coming forth through the five-fold ministry, it's just letter. Listen, the way I see it, you could say listen uh it say uh and quote what the tapes are saying and say what brother Brandham meant and was saying by revelation. That's the way you can quote brother Brandham. You can we can take the quotes. We can play the tapes. But be sure that you've got the same revelation on you that he had when he was speaking it. Hallelujah. Otherwise, HOW CAN YOU WALK TOGETHER? HOW CAN YOU know how can you fully understand? Let's read the next quote here. Number 12, he says, "Then you notice now that they were virgins of the last watch." It was the midnight call. It was the midnight hour. That's why the last watch is the seventh watch. Coming down through the watches, there had been seven watches. And in the seventh watch, the midnight hour, as we are on striking now, see now is this midnight watch. These virgins woke and trimmed their lamps and went in. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why this is in progress. It started in 1963 when the mighty angel came down. It was it was under that seventh church age messenger. The call came under the seventh messenger. If you go back and study the seven church ages, who was the seventh church age messenger? William Branham. That's why it's so important to recognize the the the dispensational changes that took place throughout the seven church ages and into the opening of the seventh seal, which took us into the eternal church age, which is where we are now. Amen. &gt;&gt; The bride has recognized that she's eternal. That she always was. &gt;&gt; That she that she had no beginning. She had no end. &gt;&gt; That's what the revelation. That's why listen, no other man, I don't care. Go back and study as many different messengers as you want. It was William Branam's ministry that took us right back into the mind of God &gt;&gt; to tell us that you are an attribute &gt;&gt; that you had you you were in the word when when when he when he came out from God. You were a part of him at that time. There's no way that you could ever be lost. Nobody else brought that kind of revelation. And did not the Lord say to brother Brandham to to you know to to try like don't try to interpret don't try to put your own interpretation. That's why we we're not here to put our own interpretation on the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. The word was revealed. The Bible became a new Bible to William Brandon &gt;&gt; because of the seventh seal. because of the mighty angel come down and and possess him to open the word and to reveal the mysteries that were that were locked up in there and then to to to actually take it to the place where he revealed the mystery of Christ to finish the mystery of Christ because it was finished when he came AND FULLY POSSESSED THAT vessel known as William Brandom to show the wave sheath &gt;&gt; this is what you're going going to be. &gt;&gt; This is what you're you're becoming. &gt;&gt; This is what I'm going to do in you. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; This is the ministry of the son of MAN NOW IN BRIDE FORM. He was waving himself before the people to let us know that this maturity level that you see is what you are going to mature into because you are my seed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. And it was finished. The mystery of God made manifest in flesh in bride form. William Brham was the first fruits of the finishing of the mystery. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But the rest OF THE BODY IS NOT COMPLETE. The bride, she is still making herself ready. She is married by the invisible union. &gt;&gt; You you you you've been feeding on the word. You've been feeding ON THE MESSAGES. WHILE you've been doing that, you've been in that invisible union with your husband. He chose you before the foundations of the world. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY HE I CALL YOU BRIDE. Brother Brandham says that was the that was the spirit. That was the anointing. Say I call you my bride. &gt;&gt; You are my wife. Hallelujah. Glory to God. She is married by the invisible union. But there are names on the lamb's book of life that have that have been placed there that need to be called &gt;&gt; that need to be called to the bridegroom call to the final calling. Amen. Praise God. Glory to God. He was only there. Listen, he was only on the scene that the Bible became a new book to him. He preached the opening of the seals. He was only here for three years after that. You think that he preached everything? You think he preached every single type? &gt;&gt; NO. THE BRIDE STILL HAS THE BOOK IN HER hand now. AND THAT SAME BOOK ONCE IT COMES INTO your hands, it becomes a new Bible to you. You should be able TO TO TO PULL OUT TYPES AND SHADOWS through the word of God that that even the prophet didn't bring out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WHAT? WHY? BECAUSE THE SAME spirit that that was in him is now in you to manifest the word. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. This book is a brand new Bible. We are the continuation of the ministry of the mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Christ did not remain in the tapes. &gt;&gt; He didn't just remain in the voice of the prophet. &gt;&gt; Think about how silly that sounds. &gt;&gt; He's present. HE'S THE LIVING GOD. CHRIST IS NOW IN THE BODY OF THE BRIDE. &gt;&gt; She now has the word in her. &gt;&gt; How else is he going to manifest the bride, the son of man, in bride form? How else is he going to identify Eve? Eve needs to be fully identified and she's going to be confirmed by the rapture. &gt;&gt; We speak now on behalf of Christ &gt;&gt; under the anointing and the revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; Not just speak this, speak that. Oh, this bride's going to be able to speak. God needs to give you character first. God needs to mold and shape you and bring you into a real true understanding of what it is to speak the word of God. It's not something that he's just going to, oh yeah, yeah, go ahead. You know, it's like a father saying to his son, here, go ahead. You run my business. He's seven years old. &gt;&gt; He's got to build character. He's got to build experience. He needs to know. He needs to understand his father's will, his desires. Amen. How? Listen, let's read the next quote. How can two walk together unless they be agreed? They can't. Jesus said they can't. And how can a church, the Methodist and the Baptist, walk together? How can the church of Christ walk with the Presbyterians? How can the Catholic walk with the Protestant? How can the Protestant walk with Protestant but the BRIDE CAN WALK WITH the word? &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHICH IS CHRIST? IT MUST BE in agreement. Not the ecclesiastical system, but the word. Amen. You have to agree with the word to walk with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How else are you going TO LISTEN? ENOCH WALKED with God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he PLEASED GOD AND HE was and then he wasn't. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. We're going to be looking at a lot more of that. &gt;&gt; Uh that that thought, you know, kind of really broke open there on New Year's Eve. I know it was a chopped up message and I'm telling you, I was nervous, you know, like I don't know, like whatever it was. But anyways, there was inspiration in that message that that I just I couldn't bring to words, but it's g it's coming. Hallelujah. Because he's just, you know, he's he's working it in us. He's he's he's given us the experience. He he he he wants us to to he doesn't want us to just say things. He wants us to have a revelation of what we're saying. &gt;&gt; This is what the bride feeds on. &gt;&gt; We feed on revelation on the life of Christ. Amen. Glory to God. But here he says now, so so so we're it's only by the word the that we in order for us to walk with the word, we've got to we've got to agree with the word. We can't be brought under organized religion. This bride, that's one thing I'll tell you right now. You under the revelation of this hour, you will never come under organized religion. &gt;&gt; You'll despise it. Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll you you'll just like somebody comes to you and says, "Brother, you you you only preach what the prophet preached. You you play your tapes in the church. You want to say something, just comment on what he's already said." What? You're not going to No, that that just doesn't even fit with with what's what's on the son or daughter of God. &gt;&gt; They have a re they have a relationship with the with the living God, &gt;&gt; the mighty angel himself. Amen. So, you know, walking with God. Amen. You can never be organized. We are ordained to the word to follow the word and not man. &gt;&gt; It's that simple. Oh, you follow a man, William Brandham. No, we follow the message &gt;&gt; that he brought. &gt;&gt; Just like you Lutheran out there, just like you you you you Presbyterians out there, you follow John Wesley's message. You you you talk about him and what God did through him. We do the same. We recognize his ministries. We recognize he was a major prophet. &gt;&gt; The 20th century prophet because only only a prophet the word only comes to a prophet. &gt;&gt; Especially when it's a dispensational change. Hallelujah. Praise God. So here now Jesus, you know, you can't walk, you know, somebody tells you, you know, tells you, oh, Jesus is one and three in the trinity. Nope. You can't walk with that. &gt;&gt; Catholic Church says we are the supreme authority and we speak for God. Nope. Can't walk with that. &gt;&gt; No sir. Can't walk with that. The Pope? Nope. I don't care what the Pope says. He's a man. &gt;&gt; And if he doesn't say what the word says, I'm not listening. &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not afraid of any man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not when you're standing on the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. No, sir. New age movement. Nope. Jesus said, "I will be with you &gt;&gt; even in you." &gt;&gt; And he can't walk against himself. &gt;&gt; Never do it. Let's Let's read on here. We're going to wind down here real quick. Why I'm against organized religion. Because this is the bridegroom call. That's part of the call here. Now listen. Notice this is the angel of light. Remember the last angel is the angel in the church age to the Leodysian. It's the Leodysian messenger. That's it. The last because the next chapter is chapter 19 which is the coming of the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this and this is in in the scripture the last angel that came to bring light before the coming of the bride to meet Christ. It was the Leodysian church age. Then what was the Leodysian church age messenger? Calling them out of Babylon. &gt;&gt; Okay, it's it's the same call. Remember, you'll never be organized. I don't care what they do with this message. They want to say do this, do that. You just follow Christ. &gt;&gt; Follow the word. Let the word continue to lead you and guide you. Be in prayer. Have a life of of prayer. Have a relationship with Christ. Amen. It's the same call. Go on next slide. He says, "Notice this angel." Now, he's talking about himself here. I want you to recognize that William Branam is talking about himself, but he didn't come out and say, "Oh, you got to listen to what I'm saying. You got No, no, no, no. You just because the Holy Ghost is in you, you can see what he's that's reading between the lines. &gt;&gt; That's understanding who the messenger is." Amen. Notice this angel is the last messenger before the coming of Christ in the 19th chapter of Revelation. The messenger's voice, if we notice, when he gave his voice on earth, there was a voice echoed again in heaven. Fourth verse. Now, he's talking. Now, I want you to understand he meant chapter 18 here. Okay? When he when he talked about the the voice that echoed from heaven, the fourth verse, it's an act it's actually in chapter 18 of Revelation. He just made a mistake. This messenger on the earth was so inclined with God until when he spoke it on earth, God echoed the same out of heaven. In other words, his message to come out of her, God vindicated it. God was confirming it. When John was writing the book of Revelation and he's seen all of these things, he saw, you know, he saw everything THAT THAT THAT WAS happening and he heard God confirming what the messenger was saying to come out of her, come out of that organized system, come out of the denominationalism, come out of of man-made creeds and dogmas and come back to the word. Amen. It's still the same message. Let's go on. He says, "What is that fourth verse translation?" Remember again, he's he's talking about chapter 18:4. What does it mean? God's voice speaking to his predestinated people saying, "Come out of her." Just exactly what the voice was. He's got people all out in there, out in those through Babylon. Come out of her that you be not partakers of her sins. Yes, sir. out of that dogma and creeds back to the word made spirit and life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we feed on. &gt;&gt; Spirit and life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Now notice if you read chapter 18, chapter 18 is all about the judgment that's going to come against mystery Babylon, that great and talks about how it's all going to come. And and we know that that prophecy is yet to be fulfilled. But my God, there are world events that are now coming into into plain view that are that are bringing this so much closer. The World Council of Churches, the the uniting of the churches and and breaking down of all the walls between the churches and becoming one and everything else. Why? Because they're buying into the into the the the the teachings of mystery Babylon, which is what? Organize control. That's what that's what organized religion is. What is Babylon was all about pagan all about uh you know uh worshiping idols and and you know oh well you got to have you know a a picture of St. Christopher in your car if you want good traveling. You know now if you put a picture of brother Christopher you might have a better chance. You might have a better chance because he'll be praying for you. He's alive. You see THEY'RE BIND THEY'RE BOWED DOWN TO IDOLS. They want to they they've made it's all Babylon. It's all mystery Babylon. BUT GOD SAYS COME OUT OF THAT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. He says now now watch. And even in in Revelations 18 verse 23, I noticed when I read this this morning, it said, "And the light of a candle shall shine no more in all at all in thee, and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more." Oh, let me tell you. You've been talking to your friends for years. You've been telling them about this message. You've been telling them about the word. You've been telling them to come out of that mystery Babylon, the denominational system that that's got you believing traditions. You don't even know HOW YOU WERE BAPTIZED. YOU ASK SOMEBODY, "HOW WERE YOU BAPTIZED?" "I GOT BAPTIZED as a baby." There's nowhere in the scripture. THEN YOU ASK SOMEBODY, "I GOT baptized as an adult." "How were you baptized?" "What do you mean, how was I? I went into the water and I got baptized. No. What was said when you were baptized? Were you baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ? Oh, yeah. Actually, I think he said in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. I say, "Yeah, but what is that name?" You see, it's all there. It's all there. But they've taken on the teachings of man, which is mystery Babylon. They've made the word of none effect to the people. Now, watch. He goes on here. Slide 18. Notice the 19th chapter is the next chapter. Now, it's right after 18, which is the the judgment, you know, the prophecy of the judgment that's coming to the harlot. But after these things, after what things did you notice here in the 19th chapter, after these things? Watch what? After what? after the message of come out of her. That's the same message that's that's that's being called and preached right now in the present stage of the ministry. He says come out of her after these things watch is the SHOUT OF THE BRIDE saints &gt;&gt; with the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Going to the marriage of the lamb. &gt;&gt; How close are we then, brother? WHAT'S THE LAST CALL? COME OUT OF BABYLON. &gt;&gt; You do you see what the last call is really telling us here? What? Because people listen, it would get so deceiving that it would deceive even the very elect &gt;&gt; if it were possible. And here we are down the road. We're right at the we're right at the precipice of the rapture. And deception is in this message. A lot of people, they've got they've made their churches so perfect. They they they make sure that every single individual in the church HAS GOT EXACTLY THE RIGHT long dress and everything is judged by the outward appearance. They want to make they want to Oh, well, you know, you shouldn't really be preaching the gospel if your children are out in the world. &gt;&gt; You got all KINDS OF STUFF. &gt;&gt; OH, YOU KNOW, YOU you know, listen, they they'll they'll tell you all kinds of stuff. &gt;&gt; But not the sons and daughters of God. They know where they stand. They know what the what what they've come into contact with. Amen. They realize their part in the word. They realize that they're trying to they're trying to put the uh uh law. They're trying to control the people. &gt;&gt; They're trying to tell what do you think? You do this and don't do anything else. WHAT IS THAT? THAT'S CONTROL. &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE WILL NOT BE CONTROLLED. THE BRIDE IS THE WORD. &gt;&gt; SHE IS CHRIST IN THE PRESENT STAGE. She is now the son of MAN MINISTRY IN BRIDE FORM. She will not BE TAKEN. SHE'S GOT THE OPEN BOOK. &gt;&gt; SHE'S GOT A revelation of the word. &gt;&gt; She knows that her NAME WAS WRITTEN IN THAT BOOK. THAT'S WHAT JOHN THAT'S WHY JOHN GOT SO EXCITED WHEN HE SAW THAT THAT THE BOOK WAS open is he seen his NAME IN THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And if you've recognized this message of who you are is because you've recognized that your name is being called. Can you hear the call? &gt;&gt; Can you hear the bridegroom call? Hallelujah. Listen what he goes on to say. He says, "Now here," he says, "Now, my brethren, that's the reason I'm against it. It's unscriptural. It's unorthodox. It's been proven TO BE FALSE. GOD IS NOT IN IT. HE NEVER WAS. HE never will be." Now, I ain't saying there's not people in these organizations. That's where the church was made up of. &gt;&gt; But as long as you stay into that system, you're a part of it. &gt;&gt; Let's Let's move on here. We're closing. The sudden secret going away of the church. Let the musicians come. How many of you all perhaps have read of the virgins? Some were wise, some were foolish. Virgin means purity. They were all good people. Every one of them virgin sanctified vessels of God. But those who had oil in their lamps went in &gt;&gt; and the others was left out. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE ALL VIRGINS. EVERYONE people people that could that you couldn't put your finger on for anything wrong. They everyone believed in the coming of the Lord. Let's read on. I WANT TO TELL you a little story that I heard some years ago in the close here. Now this sudden quick rapture of the church. He says now you say certain things will then I'll make ready. &gt;&gt; Make ready. Now &gt;&gt; I've just related to you of Pearl Harbor and of many places where they refused to hear the warning. They refused to listen to it. Nothing was left but divine judgment upon the people. Now all that will not go in Christ will be under God's wrath and divine judgment. &gt;&gt; Please don't let that happen to you. &gt;&gt; Now read this next quote. No matter what, this is sudden secret catching. &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT BRANDHAM TABERNACLE ever turns out to be, &gt;&gt; don't you let it be you. &gt;&gt; You be a servant of Christ. &gt;&gt; No matter what the church world does, &gt;&gt; you be a servant of Christ. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT UP TO BRANDHAM TABERNACLE. Neither is it up to any other church. Now, I'm I'm bringing this this quote not in disrespect. understand there's a lot of people &gt;&gt; that are following William Brandham that are in the Brandham tabernacle that love the Lord that are that are in the bride. WHAT I'M NOT I'm not making that call. &gt;&gt; The thought here is COME OUT OF HER. &gt;&gt; COME out of organized teaching and religion and be not brought under any kind of bondage &gt;&gt; because you are free. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. He says it's not up to Brandham Tabernacle. Neither is it up to any other church. It's up to you as an individual to be ready at the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; YOU MUST BE READY. I MUST BE READY. I'll sweep MY OWN STEPS. IT'S UP TO you to sweep your own steps. Leave mine alone. &gt;&gt; Everybody wants to go in and oh, but you know this brother, you know, you got to check and see, you know, like maybe their their church, they got a lot of unbelievers. There's people in there been married two, three times. There's this what A BUNCH OF NONSENSE. THEY HAVEN'T EVEN ENTERED INTO the to the love of Christ. &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE REDEEMED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Even William Brandom under the anointing, God gave him a word and said, "Go on as you are." &gt;&gt; There was there was there listen in the sea of his forgetfulness. You will not forget. It'll be stuck in your mind. But let me tell you, he's wiped it as though it never happened in the first place. That's the God we serve, brother. Hallelujah. Glory to God. It's you sweep your own steps. I'll I'll do mine. You've got to make your garment ready. Listen, the reason the seven thunders was not to be revealed or explained is because the coming of the Lord would be Christ personally coming to each son and daughter of God. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Personally in every age, Brother Brandham was the first one of the capstone bride to come to maturity. All the other SEALS REVEALED WHAT HAD HAPPENED and talked about future events of the tribulation and so forth. But the seventh seal was the actual coming of the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; It was the coming of THE LORD. AMEN. TO CAP off the bride who had received the fullness of the word. You've been given the fullness of the word &gt;&gt; to you. It's not a mystery anymore. &gt;&gt; The thunders and that which John was told not to write, God calls William Brandham and he says, "You pick up your PEN AND NOW WRITE." &gt;&gt; GO BACK AND READ THAT AND SEE WHAT IT SAYS. YOU'RE THE VERY IMAGE and the VOICE OF GOD IN THESE LAST DAYS. YOU ARE THE VERY GOD TO THE PEOPLE. AMEN. Oh my goodness. Glory to God. Take that to the bank. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; MANY OF US HAD NOT BEEN BORN YET AND HAD not been born again yet because our names had not been called yet from the open book that was in the lamb's hand back in 1963. But now that book, you've been told to take it. &gt;&gt; Eat it. &gt;&gt; It becomes you. &gt;&gt; It becomes a part of you. AND NOW YOU'VE GOT A PROPHECY THAT'S COMING OUT OF YOU. &gt;&gt; You've got the word that's CALLING THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD to the to THE BRIDEGROOM CALL. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. It's the call to the rapture, THE BRIDE, THE THE CAPSTONE BRIDE OF THIS LAST AGE. Glory to God. No more no more church ages, but become one with Christ by eating the book actually is the mystery of Christ. God in flesh in the final voice with the bridegroom call which is the SHOUT THE VOICE THE TRUMP of God to gather the bride to the marriage supper &gt;&gt; and we'll end with this scripture as and as and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters he's talking about And as the voice of mighty thunderings, oh those thunders are thundering today. Glory to God. Saying hallelujah. For the Lord God omnipotent reignth. Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come. &gt;&gt; AND HIS WIFE HATH already &gt;&gt; made herself ready. And he granted and and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white. You know what that is? That's your theophony. That's what you're going to be arrayed in. &gt;&gt; Fine linen. He says, "FOR THE FINE LINEN IS the righteousness of the saints." What is the righteousness of the saints? Christ the word. Amen. And he saith unto me, "Right, blessed are they which are called unto the marriage &gt;&gt; of the supper &gt;&gt; of the lamb. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let us let us pray. our gracious heavenly father. Lord Jesus, Lord, I know there was a lot said, Lord, I know that it's kind of broken up a bit, Father, but Lord, I know that the sons and daughters of God, Lord, that are in this atmosphere right now, they've recognized that you alone stand in the midst of the people. You declare and vindicate your word. You will interpret your word. Man has always tried to go ahead of you, Father, and try to interpret you and say how it should be. But, Father, you've always always done it the same way. You've come and lived in the hearts of the people. Lord, won't you make this more of a reality to every single one of us here, Lord? We want to go into 2026 with with with victory, Lord. And there's no way that we can do that if we're constantly feeling condemned, constantly feeling that we're not good enough, that we're relying on our own ability and our own works. Lord, let the faith come into our hearts, oh God, to vindicate that you are the living God that lives and dwells within your own people. [Music] Vindicate your word, Lord. There's many here that are constantly coming before you for healing in their bodies, healing in their minds, healing in their relationships. Lord, won't you won't you do it this year, Father? Won't you do it for the people, Lord? Lord, give them faith, Lord. I I I'm not I'm not telling you to do anything. I'm just asking you, Lord, that if there if there's faith in the hearts of the people, Lord, I know you'll meet it. I know you'll do it. I know that you'll you'll you'll go beyond our weaknesses. You'll go beyond, Lord. Lord, uh we on Friday we talked about uh you know Hezekiah and how Lord he pleaded to you, Father, because he needed healing. He didn't want to die, Lord. He said he said, "Lord, I plead with you. I've I've walked with you with a perfect heart, Lord. I I can't say I've walked with you with a perfect heart as a as a human. I make mistakes. I fall, Lord. Oh, God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But you are that perfection, Lord. &gt;&gt; That desire in our hearts is perfect for your word. IT'S IT'S THAT PART OF YOU THAT you've placed in us. SO WHEN I SAW THAT AND I SEEN WHAT HEZEKIAH was saying, Lord, he he was a man. There was no way he could be perfect. But in his heart, Lord, he had a PERFECT UH RELATIONSHIP. HE HAD A PERFECT ATTITUDE towards you, A PERFECT DESIRE FOR YOU to come and and to do what he couldn't do. Lord, HE NEEDED MORE TIME BECAUSE HE HAD A CAUSE. HE HAD SOMETHING HE WANTED TO DO. HE WANTED TO RESTORE THE ALTARS, LORD. &gt;&gt; LORD, WE GOT FAMILIES. WE GOT LOVED ONES. WE'VE GOT THINGS IN OUR LIVES, LORD, that we want to see restored. &gt;&gt; We're pleading you, Father. We're asking you, LORD, GIVE US THAT FAITH, OH GOD, and and Lord, change situations, FATHER. THERE'S THEY'RE ALL GOD. &gt;&gt; THERE'S SITUATIONS that seem impossible, &gt;&gt; but not with you. &gt;&gt; There's nothing too hard for you, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. Come, Lord. &gt;&gt; Have your way, oh God. Remember the hearts of your children. The the unspoken call and cry that's been going out here this morning. Grant it, oh God.
