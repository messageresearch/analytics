[6:34] 11:33 oh the depth of the

[6:46] searchable are his judgments and his
[6:48] ways past finding
[6:51] out father God bless this word and bless
[6:54] your people may there be a merge an
[6:57] infusion of your word revealed with
[7:00] these your people let Lord God the the
[7:03] the hidden message within these black
[7:06] letters written on White Pages let the
[7:08] hidden message the red letter come forth
[7:11] into Living Color into the minds and the
[7:14] hearts of every
[7:16] huj the hearing of my voice the name of
[7:19] Jesus Christ let
[7:21] it let there be a
[7:24] marriage Hallelujah name we ask it
[7:28] according to your will
[7:30] in your name amen may be seated
[7:33] hallelujah
[7:36] hallelujah I have a thought this morning
[7:38] of if you want to give it a title it's
[7:40] just one word it's called
[7:44] Indescribable there are things that
[7:46] happen in our lives saints that
[7:47] sometimes we just don't we can't find
[7:49] the words to
[7:52] express what happened or how it impacted
[7:55] us and each one of us if you really
[7:58] thought about it and maybe some things
[8:00] in your life uh in their life that are
[8:02] that were not good they were bad events
[8:05] that are also Indescribable not
[8:07] something you even want to talk about
[8:09] may be something you've blocked in your
[8:11] memory you don't even know you blocked
[8:12] it you blocked it so well that you don't
[8:14] think about it you live your life
[8:17] tiptoeing and walking around
[8:19] subconsciously things in your life you
[8:21] walk around events you try to avoid
[8:23] things you live a life of
[8:25] avoidance and you don't even know why
[8:28] but that's not what I want to speak
[8:29] about this morning because I believe
[8:30] this if we focus on the negative we may
[8:32] improve it we may not if we focus on our
[8:35] weaknesses we may make them better we
[8:38] may not but I have discovered in 27
[8:41] years of serving the lord that if we
[8:44] focus on our strengths if we focus on
[8:46] who we are if we focus on who he is if
[8:48] we focus on the promiser The promisee
[8:51] Keeper if we focus on God focus on him
[8:54] and his word and not on the problems not
[8:57] on the situations uh then the best
[9:00] things start happening you start
[9:01] transforming you start changing you
[9:03] start having a renewing of your mind and
[9:06] that starts to cause things to come to
[9:08] surface and fall off that need
[9:11] anymore it's liberty if you continue in
[9:14] my word you will know the truth see
[9:17] Jesus never said know the truth the
[9:18] truth will make you free he said if you
[9:21] continue in my word then you will know
[9:23] the truth and the truth will make you
[9:25] free so you have to start with the first
[9:26] things first amen amen but Paul says in
[9:31] 2 Corinthians 9:15 you don't need to
[9:33] turn there but he said this and I love
[9:35] it because if he sums up his entire
[9:37] expression of the Gospel an expression
[9:39] of the good news the exciting news the
[9:42] expression of the message by the way the
[9:44] message of the hour that we believe is
[9:46] the message of the Apostle Paul how many
[9:47] believe that it's just more revealed
[9:50] fully revealed amen uh and he says
[9:53] finally in 2 Corinthians 9:15 as he
[9:55] wraps up that letter he says thanks be
[9:57] to God for his
[10:00] Indescribable
[10:02] gift
[10:04] Hallelujah some gifts just are
[10:06] Indescribable how many here celebrates
[10:08] Christmas some do some don't right
[10:11] Christmas your birthday whatever people
[10:12] will give you a gift sometimes you get a
[10:14] gift from someone that you keep getting
[10:16] the same gift and you're like oh yeah
[10:17] it's another tie I'm going to hang that
[10:20] up with my other 400 ties hope I better
[10:23] wear it next Sunday
[10:26] with right and then sometimes somebody
[10:30] was really listening or really knows you
[10:31] and they gave you something that you
[10:33] didn't even expect and you were
[10:36] shocked and you don't even have words
[10:40] and it's not a put on you're there maybe
[10:41] they're there and they're watching you
[10:43] and they're really they're saying wow I
[10:45] guess I really hit something there cuz
[10:46] they really love it and it's
[10:48] Indescribable it's something you can't
[10:50] express but Saints what I want to talk
[10:52] to you about this morning is God's love
[10:54] his power his wisdom his glory are
[10:59] wonderful to experience and we've
[11:02] experienced it amen but they're so
[11:06] difficult to describe very difficult to
[11:09] describe uh I was born in
[11:13] 1964 um uh I was uh I was born to
[11:17] parents who were Christians uh born into
[11:20] a family of of of eight uh now nine so
[11:23] as I was born into was nine of us I was
[11:25] actually in the middle but I call myself
[11:28] the peterel and the sandwich I'm wear
[11:31] the peanut but and jelly sort of mix so
[11:32] I don't know who I am and what I'm
[11:34] supposed to be here for so and uh so I'm
[11:37] right in the middle and
[11:39] uh but uh my parents came into the
[11:42] message the year before and
[11:44] so I find it very interesting my mother
[11:47] I asked her why did you have so many
[11:49] kids I mean she's a 5'2 Saint having she
[11:53] had 10 the last one didn't survive but
[11:56] why did you do that she goes well he
[11:57] said she said I I really didn't make
[11:59] make a Big Splash in this world so I
[12:01] just felt that one thing I can do is
[12:03] make children I can make a doctor I can
[12:06] make a lawyer I can make a president I
[12:07] can make a preacher and I can make a
[12:10] farmer or whatever she I can make
[12:12] whatever I just kep
[12:14] making said well you got the preacher
[12:16] out of the deal
[12:20] anyway
[12:21] [Applause]
[12:26] Hallelujah but called naming me Elijah
[12:29] was sort of a dad giveway don't you
[12:30] think so it's like how's I going to
[12:33] escape that I'm going to be the best
[12:35] Crook in the world I'm going to make I'm
[12:37] going to rob banks and stuff that's not
[12:40] going to
[12:42] happen but you know God has an amazing
[12:44] sense of humor too in a way that he puts
[12:47] things together that sort of match
[12:49] you'll see patterns that's the beauty of
[12:51] the Bible God doesn't spell everything
[12:53] out in the Bible so that it's easy to
[12:55] find makes it a little bit hard doesn't
[12:57] it makes it so that you have to chase
[12:59] to learn anything I remember one time
[13:02] there was a lady who came to Christ she
[13:03] came to the message and she was so
[13:05] excited she said oh I'm so excited I got
[13:07] God in my life I got Jesus in my life
[13:09] I'm going to be able to be blessed in
[13:11] every area right now I'm out of out of
[13:13] work and I've been I've been laid off
[13:15] and I got to have a good job so let me
[13:18] look in the Bible and see if I can find
[13:20] where God can help me find a good job so
[13:21] she starts looking at the index j o
[13:24] there it
[13:28] is
[13:30] never started reading about j o she
[13:33] learned a lot about how you have to
[13:35] sometimes
[13:39] suffer
[13:42] [Applause]
[13:45] Hallelujah I remember this other
[13:47] gentleman he he came to the to the truth
[13:49] and this is his story it was pretty
[13:51] funny but he walked into church a little
[13:53] bit late worship was going on and he
[13:55] heard the song they were singing he says
[13:57] man I'm excited about being in this
[13:58] message these people are too proud and
[14:00] arrogant this song is horrible I've Got
[14:04] Brains why would people be singing I've
[14:06] Got
[14:07] Brains he was sitting in a seat of the
[14:10] scornful Nelson and dawned on him you
[14:12] know what this message is the truth of
[14:14] the hour we're going into Rapture it's
[14:17] true We've Got Brains he sang the whole
[14:19] song I've Got
[14:22] Brains I got
[14:25] bra got bra
[14:28] [Music]
[14:30] humility was coming his way too cuz he
[14:32] learned later on that our god
[14:34] reigns that's a hearing
[14:39] problem you know a lot of times we
[14:41] accuse each other we're not getting
[14:42] along because we have we feel like
[14:43] someone is coming across Pride or have
[14:45] some other arrogant issue and really is
[14:47] we're not hearing right and sometimes
[14:50] even with our Lord we think what's wrong
[14:51] Lord why have you rejected me why are
[14:53] you turn you know causing me not to be
[14:55] blessed what's happening and it's a lot
[14:56] of times we're just not hear it right
[14:58] amen amen and a lot of times it's just
[15:01] the fact that he's
[15:02] Indescribable you can't really put a tag
[15:05] on God you know Americans are probably
[15:07] Canadians and probably the whole world
[15:08] we like to stereotype everybody we want
[15:10] to put everybody in a compartment and
[15:12] that's the reason why they the church
[15:14] world the religious world comes up with
[15:16] religion is how to how do do how do we
[15:18] dissect God and and compartmentalize him
[15:21] and get him in his little place so we
[15:23] know who he is and that's what they've
[15:25] done unfortunately you can't do that
[15:27] with God because he is like a lightning
[15:29] bolt how are you going to capture that
[15:31] he is like the inexpressible things of
[15:34] this world that we don't even understand
[15:36] that the phys physics um uh the great
[15:39] physicists can't even put words to it
[15:41] they try to describe how the uh quantum
[15:44] theory works and you try to read a book
[15:45] on it and you're just as baffled at the
[15:47] end as the beginning and at the end they
[15:49] just conclude that they don't even
[15:50] understand what they just talked about
[15:52] right pretty exci but that's our God how
[15:54] you going to do that
[15:59] even this message oh we have such deep
[16:01] understanding we still don't get it
[16:02] that's right you know the reason why God
[16:04] had Shepherds come to see Jesus at his
[16:06] birth because they were ignorant and
[16:08] knew it the reason he had wise men come
[16:10] is because they were wise and still knew
[16:12] they didn't know everything they learned
[16:14] a lot they probably felt like they knew
[16:17] less Hallelujah but but I was born and
[16:21] this is kind of the interesting part but
[16:23] I was born on May 7th now it's
[16:25] interesting because it was May
[16:27] 7th in
[16:30] 1946 when an angel commissioned our
[16:33] Prophet under an Elijah commission
[16:36] that's pretty powerful stuff right and
[16:38] so yes my mother was aware of the name
[16:39] but she felt to name me that and it was
[16:41] just lands on the same day which I find
[16:43] very fascinating
[16:45] but Ephesians 3 I
[16:48] think is um and I love the book of
[16:51] Ephesians how many understands that's
[16:53] our Joshua that's our how The Exodus
[16:56] ends up we're entering Promised Land
[16:58] time right that's
[17:00] Ephesians and he says there in Ephesians
[17:03] 3:14 for this cause I bow my knees unto
[17:07] the father of our Lord Jesus Christ from
[17:09] whom the whole family in Heaven and
[17:11] Earth is named that's exciting isn't it
[17:14] the ineffable name right you can't even
[17:15] describe his name that that he would
[17:18] Grant you according to the riches of his
[17:20] glory to be strengthened with might by
[17:23] his spirit in the inner man that's a lot
[17:26] of words there but how many loves those
[17:27] words anyway I want my inner man be
[17:30] strengthened by his Spirit he says that
[17:34] Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith
[17:38] that you being rooted and grounded in
[17:41] love may be able to comprehend with All
[17:45] Saints what is the bread and the length
[17:50] and the depth and the
[17:52] height Hallelujah every Dimension and to
[17:56] know the love of Christ which surpasses
[18:00] knowledge that you might be filled with
[18:02] all the fullness of God how many loves
[18:06] that even even Paul in in this great
[18:09] mature church called the the Believers
[18:11] of Ephesus knew that he could express
[18:13] these things but he was saying make this
[18:15] your goal it's going to be it's
[18:17] virtually impossible but make it your
[18:20] desire and your goal that you could
[18:22] comprehend somehow Gather in your mind
[18:26] that you have your spiritual mind the
[18:28] very height and the Very depth and the
[18:30] Very length and width of God all the
[18:32] things you could possibly know learn it
[18:34] go for it go into this great place and
[18:37] search out the
[18:39] unsearchable don't do it other religions
[18:41] do God is you know he's he's Untouchable
[18:45] uh he's Transcendent he's Way Beyond us
[18:48] he's in three persons we don't
[18:49] understand what we're talking about but
[18:51] that's better for you because you don't
[18:52] need to know him you can't know him he's
[18:53] too far away that is not what God's ever
[18:56] wanted in in his life God's whole
[18:58] purpose God's whole design and his whole
[19:02] Bible is written as a story about how he
[19:05] comes to us because we can't get to him
[19:08] he comes to us first as a father over
[19:11] his people and finally as a son with his
[19:14] people and ultimately as the spirit in
[19:17] his people the same
[19:22] God that's the whole story The Bible you
[19:24] can split it up into three parts Old
[19:26] Testament Jesus New Testament that's the
[19:28] whole story being told hallelujah it's
[19:31] exciting and so he's saying to us search
[19:34] even though you don't know but search
[19:35] the
[19:36] unsearchable go into
[19:39] it some of the laziest people on Earth
[19:42] are
[19:43] Catholics they just come to church do
[19:45] the religion and
[19:46] leave my son had a friend he's Catholic
[19:49] he says come to my church and he asked
[19:51] us and we said you know what go
[19:53] ahead it's horrible that we're saying go
[19:56] to a Catholic church but go 16 he needs
[19:59] to see the difference he goes oh he says
[20:01] you wouldn't believe that the church has
[20:02] the capacity for 200 there was 36 people
[20:05] there they were old people and they act
[20:07] like they didn't care and as soon as it
[20:09] was over they left said they left they
[20:11] didn't say anything they just said
[20:13] that's because they completed their
[20:15] their obligation they did the religion
[20:17] and they're
[20:18] done some of the other lazy people too
[20:21] are unfortunately around the rings of
[20:22] this
[20:23] message because we've been handed so
[20:27] much so for two reasons one it seems
[20:30] like it's so much it's unfall we can't
[20:32] really get
[20:33] it I just I'm not even going to try
[20:36] that's bad we'll work on that in a
[20:38] minute the other reason is because of
[20:41] people have the same spirit it's the
[20:43] same spirit that let the pasture to it
[20:46] and partly brother John brother Simon is
[20:49] because we're we're blessed God has
[20:51] given us the ministry we're blessed with
[20:53] the gift we bring these
[20:56] messages that are basically on Silver
[20:59] platters and people are eating and
[21:00] enjoying it and there tremendous meals
[21:02] we enjoy it and we go we're
[21:04] not so you need to ask yourself the
[21:07] question am I doing what Paul said am I
[21:10] still digging deeper am I Noble like the
[21:13] Berean believers who heard the Apostle
[21:15] Paul preached the messenger of the age
[21:16] the prophet of the age and then went and
[21:18] searched it out or do I eat my dinner
[21:22] after church and say wasn't that a
[21:23] wonderful message brother J preach all
[21:25] brother sim said you're wonderful Pastor
[21:27] what a great message that was CH was so
[21:29] uh who's playing in the World Series
[21:31] [Music]
[21:34] today are we going to have bad weather
[21:37] tomorrow you know what what's what's
[21:40] going on is we haven't realized that
[21:44] this message isn't done
[21:46] yet I'm not I haven't changed yet and
[21:50] you know what's going to change us is US
[21:51] digging in amen amen I actually I'm
[21:55] brother brother Simon and I are are
[21:57] relying on you to do your part because
[22:01] it's going to take all of us God has to
[22:02] orchestrate this around the world so the
[22:04] entire bride has to be together on this
[22:07] well I don't have a gift of preaching
[22:08] brother Elijah I don't think I'm
[22:09] supposed to be yeah you're supposed to
[22:11] be digging into the word you need to
[22:12] know what is the height the depth the
[22:15] width and and and the length of this
[22:17] whole thing going to it even though you
[22:19] know you'll never be able to get to the
[22:21] end of it that's okay that's why we're
[22:23] going to need a millennial right amen
[22:25] we're not going to be in a honeymoon
[22:27] with the Lord Jesus sitting around
[22:29] twiddling our thumbs we got things to do
[22:31] he said the prophet of God said we're
[22:32] going somewhere where we're going to
[22:33] work we're going to study we're going to
[22:36] play we're going to enjoy amen but let's
[22:40] get started now amen hallelujah so it
[22:43] takes it's a lifetime Endeavor of saints
[22:46] to even grasp the the breath the length
[22:49] the height the depth how are we going to
[22:52] describe it we can barely even
[22:54] understand it ourselves but go for it do
[22:56] it anyway but how can we even begin to
[22:58] describe it you know once job
[23:00] experienced the glory of God he said I
[23:02] put my hand over my mouth I will say
[23:05] another I won't say another word what
[23:07] was going on with joob he was he was so
[23:10] impacted by God's awesome presence that
[23:13] he could not even find the words to try
[23:18] and express
[23:20] it but he those 39 chapters so he did
[23:24] pretty good right don't you think he
[23:26] tried how do we portray the glory of God
[23:28] how do we do it he experienced this he
[23:30] couldn't do it the Old Testament uh uh
[23:33] talks about these things you know when
[23:34] the cloud came down they fell on their
[23:37] faces they couldn't even worship they
[23:39] hardly could do anything because God's
[23:42] presence was there and was so
[23:44] powerful so many times there were men
[23:46] throughout the Bible who after seeing
[23:49] God's glory his presence could not put
[23:52] words to it adequately think about Moses
[23:55] think about David think about Isaiah
[23:58] Ezekiel Paul just all the way through
[24:00] many men and women could not do it words
[24:03] just fall short amen accurate
[24:06] descriptions fail how do you describe
[24:09] the
[24:10] Indescribable how can we do
[24:13] it they did their best to convey what
[24:17] they witnessed sometimes they talk about
[24:20] a fire sometimes the Bible talks about a
[24:22] cloud uh an angel a man a dove likee
[24:25] Spirit a rushing Mighty Wind a star
[24:27] there's all these different different
[24:30] descriptions many depictions but most
[24:33] are inadequate why is it Saints it's
[24:35] because how can the finite describe the
[24:39] infinite how can the limited even begin
[24:43] to express the
[24:45] unlimited we don't have the terms the
[24:48] terminology Moses saw the Heavenly
[24:49] Throne Room the Bible tells us that when
[24:51] Moses saw that he began to build the ark
[24:55] and the mercy seats and designed it
[24:57] based on what he saw he put two cheran
[24:59] there how many of remember is that
[25:00] that's scripture
[25:01] right they're seated upon the mercy seat
[25:04] two cheran that's what he saw in heaven
[25:06] he saw God he saw two cherub there's
[25:09] another place where David said that he
[25:11] saw God riding on a cherub one cherub
[25:14] two cherub him one cherabin right
[25:16] another time Isaiah talks about what he
[25:18] experienced and he talks about seeing
[25:20] the Glorious presence of of God and um
[25:23] he doesn't talk about one or two he
[25:24] talks about
[25:25] four Ezekiel seems to talk about four as
[25:29] well but when Isaiah talks about it he
[25:32] says they have six wings they have four
[25:35] faces but Ezekiel says they have four
[25:38] wings and they have 16 faces each one
[25:41] has four
[25:42] faces very strange we might be able to
[25:45] draw some conclusions as I've read some
[25:48] scholarly atheists write on it that see
[25:50] these guys didn't even their words
[25:52] didn't even agree with each other
[25:54] contradictions run all through the
[25:56] Bible of course
[25:59] how do you describe
[26:02] it they're similar enough that we know
[26:04] they're talking about the same thing but
[26:06] how do we describe it John in Revelation
[26:08] 4 he witnessed something very very
[26:10] similar to these two prophets and he
[26:12] mentions uh um bodies full of eyes
[26:15] whereas Ezekiel says there were wheels
[26:16] that were full of
[26:18] eyes bodies
[26:20] Wheels also John said that they were
[26:22] crying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty
[26:25] who was and is and is to come how many
[26:27] could just jump in right now and start
[26:29] worshiping when you hear also John and a
[26:32] prophet John now this point prophesying
[26:34] and speaking about what he's seeing and
[26:35] he's saying holy holy holy Lord God
[26:38] Almighty who was and is and is to
[26:42] come that's something amazing I wish I
[26:45] was there with John right but we were
[26:46] experiencing similar things today but
[26:48] then Isaiah when he heard it he said he
[26:50] heard holy holy holy is the Lord of
[26:52] hosts the whole earth is full of his
[26:56] glory different sayings what's going
[26:58] going on what can we say is the Bible
[26:59] inconsistent are these prophets accurate
[27:03] can we trust
[27:05] them why is it that they're telling the
[27:07] story one way and the later to tell it a
[27:08] little bit
[27:10] different remember these are finite men
[27:13] with human weaknesses even though they
[27:15] are prophets but they're attempting to
[27:17] describe the awesome Majestic presence
[27:21] of all
[27:23] God even the Bible tells us in the New
[27:26] Testament that the prophets were known
[27:29] to have searched the scriptures and
[27:31] other Prophecies of other men of their
[27:33] time including their own prophecies to
[27:36] try and understand the meaning I can
[27:38] imagine Isaiah saying why did I say a UR
[27:40] shall conceive this is
[27:42] craziness trying to say where else is
[27:45] that did Elijah say anything about this
[27:48] did Moses say anything you know you can
[27:50] imagine these men that's what the Bible
[27:51] tells us they were searching without
[27:55] results imagine that you're sticking
[27:57] with word that you don't know why you
[27:59] said it and they're going to saw you in
[28:01] half in the
[28:02] Box you're going to stay with your
[28:04] prophecy about this virgin
[28:07] thing yes I can't help it I said it it's
[28:10] got to be
[28:11] true Indescribable
[28:14] Saints we have to give these men and the
[28:17] Bible descriptions the benefit of the
[28:19] doubt
[28:20] because what they experiened of the
[28:23] infinite of the
[28:25] omnipotent of the omnipresent God was
[28:27] Absol absolutely
[28:31] Indescribable and I'm and we're thankful
[28:33] for these descriptions even if we think
[28:34] they don't agree with each other because
[28:36] that's the best we have am that's right
[28:40] God never spells himself out he never
[28:42] gives himself all the way he gives just
[28:46] enough because he's the god that desires
[28:49] to be
[28:50] chased he the god that desires
[28:53] relationship that's right you just can't
[28:55] have relationship in a stagnant
[28:57] situation you need to have one person
[28:59] going after the other and vice versa
[29:02] right kind of like Jacob and Rachel I
[29:05] think it was sporting the Bible say
[29:07] whatever the word was I know you don't
[29:09] believe in sports
[29:10] but
[29:12] James sporting I
[29:14] [Music]
[29:16] think I hope you brothers that have been
[29:18] married for 22 years or longer like me
[29:20] are still supporting your wives
[29:31] Paul had attempts to try to describe it
[29:32] because remember he was working for the
[29:34] Sanhedrin he was out collecting
[29:36] Christians to be beaten and thrown in
[29:39] jail so he's on his way to Damascus
[29:41] because he hears that they run from
[29:42] Jerusalem to there and they're starting
[29:44] a big Hub over there message this
[29:46] message I hate this message it's crazy
[29:48] message we got to put an end to this
[29:50] message he was a messenger of the age
[29:52] can you imagine
[29:54] that crazy want to kill his own message
[29:59] but on his way he is struck down by a
[30:02] light by a phenomenon he is knocked down
[30:06] and
[30:07] blinded and he starts describing it in
[30:09] Acts chapter 9 you don't need to read it
[30:11] I'll kind of run through this with you
[30:12] so we can get a pretty good picture of
[30:14] it he says and as it's describing as as
[30:19] though it's third person it might have
[30:20] been somebody else writing this but it
[30:21] says and as Paul or as he journeyed he
[30:24] came near Damascus and suddenly there
[30:26] shown around about him a light from
[30:29] heaven and he fell to the Earth and
[30:31] heard a voice saying to him Saul Saul
[30:33] why P persecutest thou me and he said
[30:37] who art thou Lord and the Lord said I am
[30:39] Jesus whom you persecutest am it is hard
[30:42] for you to kick against the
[30:44] goats I love sharing this story one time
[30:47] I was uh I was with a gentleman who was
[30:51] um a
[30:53] uh I believe it a jovah witness and it
[30:57] was standing in line at some meeting
[30:59] somewhere he was Jehovah's Witness and I
[31:00] was talking to him about it and I said
[31:01] you
[31:03] know my whole church we're all Jehovah's
[31:05] Witnesses he go
[31:07] really oh yeah I said oh yes we witness
[31:10] about your all the
[31:13] time you know and I said um I said I
[31:16] love I love the way he came down as a
[31:18] fire in a burning bush and find and and
[31:20] and he was a fire by night and Cloud by
[31:22] day and and Israel followed him and he
[31:25] led them to the promised land and he
[31:26] kept showing up as a fire or sometimes
[31:29] maybe angelically but he was Jehovah you
[31:31] know he was there in the Old Testament
[31:32] over and over I mean he definitely
[31:33] displayed himself amen I said then in
[31:37] the New Testament he comes again he
[31:38] shows up and and and as in front of Paul
[31:42] and a Big Bright Light Of Fire and
[31:44] knocks him off his horse and he goes hey
[31:46] man that's awesome that's exciting and
[31:49] and uh and he heard and then Paul hears
[31:51] a voice Saul Saul why are you
[31:53] persecuting me he goes yeah that's right
[31:55] Hallelujah brother I was giving him so
[31:56] much rope it was scary
[31:59] I was really
[32:00] afraid start to get nerves like he was
[32:03] going to have meltdown got too much into
[32:06] this and and finally Paul says who art
[32:10] thou Lord and the Lord says I am Jesus
[32:14] whom you're
[32:18] persecuting like yes he
[32:24] [Applause]
[32:30] it's too bad really that people can't be
[32:32] open to the word of God who claim they
[32:35] know it all
[32:36] amazing but it says here that in verse
[32:39] six it says and he trembled and and and
[32:42] and he was he and he trembling and
[32:44] astonished said Lord see he didn't say
[32:47] oh I can't believe that he said Lord he
[32:48] called him Lord again Lord what wil thou
[32:50] have me to do and the Lord said unto him
[32:52] arise go into the city it should be told
[32:54] you what you must do and the men who
[32:57] journeyed with him stood speechless
[32:59] hearing a voice but not but seeing no
[33:02] one keep this in mind right they have
[33:07] they're hearing a voice but they're not
[33:08] seeing
[33:09] anything now let's go on to acts 22 you
[33:12] don't need to turn there again but this
[33:13] is where he's before Paul is before the
[33:15] Jewish Sanhedrin and he's talking about
[33:17] the story and he says about noon there
[33:20] was a great light that shown around
[33:22] about me and he says and Paul says he
[33:25] fell to the ground and that's all
[33:28] paralleling very well with what we read
[33:29] in nine then he says those with me did
[33:32] not hear the voice but they saw the
[33:35] light and were afraid so one said they
[33:38] heard a voice but didn't see anything
[33:40] the other one says he saw a light but
[33:41] they didn't hear a voice so now we have
[33:43] a lot of craziness what what really
[33:45] happened well perhaps Paul is
[33:50] embellishing or maybe he's doing his
[33:53] best to describe something
[33:55] Indescribable or maybe his memory is
[33:57] failing him
[33:58] it's quite a while later since he's now
[34:00] before the San this is after several
[34:02] quite a few years since the experience
[34:04] later on in Acts 26 he's before King
[34:06] agria the governor uh and Governor Felix
[34:09] in a Roman tribunal and he's describing
[34:12] what happened because they want to know
[34:13] it so he says I saw a light from Heaven
[34:15] brighter than the sun this is a little
[34:17] bit more than just a big light that a
[34:19] light brighter than the sun uh you know
[34:22] acts 9 a light acts 22 he says a great
[34:25] light and Acts 26 he says a light
[34:27] brighter than son so it seems like his
[34:29] story is getting bigger and Boulder all
[34:31] the time I don't know if we should still
[34:33] believe Paul I think it was a
[34:36] charlot trying to blow his own horn
[34:39] right don't you think so there's a lot
[34:41] more but keep going says and then he
[34:43] says shining around me and those who
[34:45] journeyed with me so now he includes
[34:47] everybody else was in this light and we
[34:50] all fell to the ground but earlier we
[34:52] found that only Paul fell to the ground
[34:53] so now we have the story going on that
[34:55] what's going on here and if if you go on
[34:58] to read the rest of Acts 26 it talks
[35:01] about a lot more that we hadn't heard
[35:03] before I'm Jesus whom you persecute but
[35:05] rise stand to thy feet I have appeared
[35:08] unto thee for this purpose to make thee
[35:10] a minister and a witness both uh of
[35:12] these things which thou have seen and of
[35:14] those things in which I will appear uh
[35:17] unto thee again delivering thee from the
[35:20] people and from the Gentiles unto whom
[35:22] now I send thee to open their eyes and
[35:25] to turn them from Darkness to light and
[35:27] from the power of Satan unto God that
[35:30] they may receive forgiveness of sins and
[35:32] an inheritance among those who are
[35:34] Sanctified by faith uh that is in me so
[35:37] a lot is going on here all of a sudden
[35:39] we're hearing all this other stuff that
[35:40] Jesus said that we don't hear about ever
[35:43] before what does it
[35:45] mean is it possible
[35:48] that Paul is having a memory loss here
[35:52] is he trying to make himself seem bigger
[35:54] and better than he really was
[35:59] I think any skeptic has the right to ask
[36:02] these
[36:04] questions
[36:06] um was this the whole story or was this
[36:08] a
[36:11] fabrication what was Paul up
[36:15] to two things
[36:18] one Paul may have heard much more than
[36:21] what we first know about when he's
[36:24] dealing with the Jews he's sharing with
[36:26] them all they need to know he may felt
[36:28] that he didn't need to tell them about
[36:30] he's actually ultimately sent to the
[36:32] Gentiles that probably would have made
[36:33] life a little worse for him don't you
[36:35] think I don't know why he didn't tell
[36:37] the Sanhedrin all this but he told it to
[36:39] the
[36:40] Gentiles they got to hear about his real
[36:43] Mission first the Jews then the Gentiles
[36:47] on the other hand these descriptions
[36:48] about the light and the presence of God
[36:50] and how he was impacted was really not
[36:52] to try and blow his own horn but he was
[36:54] simply in the same position that all the
[36:56] prophets had always always been and all
[36:58] men and women of God who experienced God
[37:00] have always been in and that is it's
[37:02] very difficult to describe what really
[37:05] happened right I remember one time that
[37:08] there was an individual um who was out
[37:11] who was saying you know I don't believe
[37:13] in God or God doesn't exist you can't
[37:15] prove it to me and so I asked him the
[37:18] question does love
[37:20] exist yes prove it to
[37:24] me he said well you know you can see if
[37:27] somebody loves somebody you'll see
[37:29] you'll see C certain things happen okay
[37:32] and if something from the invisible
[37:33] other world comes and changes my life
[37:36] radically for the better from a pop
[37:38] smoking alcohol
[37:40] drinking uh crazy guy to someone who now
[37:44] has a tremendously blessed life with a
[37:47] purpose and a direction and I know where
[37:48] I'm going amen someone who had a very
[37:51] sick body that was healed by almighty
[37:53] God miraculously you're not going to be
[37:56] able to convince me that there's no God
[37:58] and I won't try to convince you there's
[38:00] no such thing as love deal deal he had
[38:04] to make that deal he was in trouble he
[38:06] said I see your point go back to the
[38:08] drawing board you can't prove to me
[38:11] there's no God well I just proved there
[38:13] is a God Amen Hallelujah so Paul seems
[38:16] to be expanding on the story but
[38:17] honestly Saints let's just realize
[38:19] what's going on here he's not really
[38:20] trying to dramatize his
[38:22] experiences um he's not having trouble
[38:24] memorizing or remembering the details
[38:27] that he's not making up things to try
[38:28] and prove his authority these things are
[38:30] happening because they're absolutely
[38:32] quite frankly
[38:34] Indescribable I can't really describe to
[38:36] you how it happened that I was healed
[38:38] but I'm going to tell tell it to you a
[38:39] little bit later if you have time the
[38:41] best of my ability amen I'll share those
[38:43] things with you but it's Indescribable
[38:45] you know let me let me ask you a
[38:47] question was it one cherub two cherubs
[38:49] four cherubs four wings six wings four
[38:52] faces 16
[38:54] faces it's Indescribable it's his
[38:57] presence
[38:58] I don't care if I see a million faces I
[38:59] want to be close to that
[39:03] presence that doesn't bother me I
[39:06] believe these men's testimonies I trust
[39:09] them that they're witnessing the truth
[39:10] that's how they experienced it they did
[39:12] the best they could they shared it with
[39:14] us and we know it was true because they
[39:16] went from who they were to people who
[39:19] transformed the world that they lived in
[39:22] Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus resurrection
[39:25] was it no Angels one angel two angels
[39:28] Three Angels you can read Mark Matthew
[39:30] Mark Luke John you can read all about it
[39:32] and it's not really that easy to be able
[39:34] to say I don't know I mean yeah I think
[39:36] it was three I think it was two I don't
[39:41] know but they described it to the best
[39:44] of their ability based on what they
[39:47] experienced see what literally happens
[39:50] is one thing how we experience it is
[39:52] another thing and then trying to
[39:54] describe it that's even a third
[39:56] thing but we must still search it and
[39:58] describe it to the best of our ability
[40:01] Hallelujah you know brother I got a
[40:04] question did Brother ranom see five
[40:06] Angels did he see seven
[40:10] angels maybe he saw five maybe he saw
[40:12] seven how do you describe something
[40:14] coming at you faster than the speed of
[40:16] life that's
[40:18] right we have a hard time when we see an
[40:20] accident happen cu the car was going 55
[40:22] M
[40:23] hour I don't know officer I I saw it I
[40:26] mean it's kind of like I think it was a
[40:28] blue car might have been yellow and the
[40:30] guy was wearing a red hat but it might
[40:31] have
[40:32] been uh Happ so
[40:37] fast
[40:38] right that's all right like when our
[40:40] kids get in trouble we get them to try
[40:42] to describe what
[40:43] happened I don't know it just it just
[40:45] happened so
[40:47] fast then you hear him in the other room
[40:49] telling their friends exactly detail for
[40:50] detail how it
[40:53] Happ who's deceiving whom
[40:57] so uh you know that's the thing it's a
[41:00] vision he's seeing something in a
[41:02] supernatural way in a supernatural de de
[41:06] Dimension so honestly I I just all I can
[41:09] say is I don't
[41:11] know but in all these cases I believe
[41:15] all of these reports
[41:18] amen because I don't worry about the
[41:21] veil that experienced it the man or the
[41:23] woman or the person that experienced it
[41:25] I'm not worried about that that that's
[41:27] okay I want the description do the best
[41:29] you can it's like a detective right
[41:31] describe what you heard to the best of
[41:33] your ability um and we'll go from
[41:37] that it must be with
[41:40] tremendous difficulty to describe the
[41:44] most high God in all his glory moving
[41:47] beyond the speed of light amen coming at
[41:50] you it must be extremely
[41:53] difficult and I'm thankful that it got
[41:56] cleared up as it went along amen because
[41:59] the reality of it made it clear you know
[42:02] sometimes people have argued over
[42:03] prophecies in the Bible because it was
[42:04] confusion and then when it happened then
[42:06] it was all cleared up amen you know 300
[42:08] prophecies about jesus' first coming it
[42:10] all cleared up right they could argue
[42:13] over before every Jew has three opinions
[42:15] about one thing that's what they talk
[42:17] about in the mission that's pretty
[42:18] interesting every Jew has three opinions
[42:19] about one thing and they do literally
[42:21] have you know Rabbi so and so Rabbi
[42:23] Solomon Rabbi Rea said this and there's
[42:25] three different opinions about you can't
[42:27] really know exactly what's right but
[42:29] when Jesus came he became all man's
[42:31] opinions to the Wayside here's what it
[42:33] is
[42:36] hallelujah and that's why even some of
[42:38] the prophecies that are still hanging in
[42:40] the message that we're people around our
[42:43] Rings you know is it going to be a real
[42:45] tent is it going to be this is it going
[42:47] to be that I ask people if you feel like
[42:51] it's going to be a real tent then there
[42:52] must be a real fishing pole a real shoe
[42:54] with a real
[42:56] shoelace doesn't that make sense that
[42:59] was a vision it was very figurative to
[43:01] begin with it should pretty much hang
[43:02] out there figurative all the way through
[43:05] one time brother said oh God I wish I
[43:06] had a tabernacle L like these Great Men
[43:10] these great men
[43:11] are my Ministry got them going you look
[43:14] at them they have huge
[43:15] buildings oh God I wish I had a huge
[43:18] Tabernacle right a big building and God
[43:20] said look up see this guy that's your
[43:22] Tabernacle Hallelujah and I'm your
[43:26] portion those things so we don't need to
[43:28] try to figure this out we just need to
[43:29] understand that there are things that we
[43:31] don't know yet still some things we
[43:32] don't fully know yet but we do know that
[43:35] they're going to be fulfilled just on
[43:37] time exactly when God wants exactly the
[43:40] way he
[43:41] [Applause]
[43:44] want I'm here believes that when Paul
[43:47] says I I show you I'm going to tell you
[43:49] a Mist we're not all going to die but
[43:51] we're all going to change all going to
[43:54] be changed in a moment in the twinkling
[43:55] of an eye how many believes that that
[43:58] that's going to happen amen how many
[44:00] understands that Paul only told us the
[44:02] mystery a prophet came in the last day
[44:04] the first Messer told us the last one
[44:06] revealed it amen so now we have the
[44:08] mystery as a revelation but still in
[44:11] spite of the Revelation the supernatural
[44:13] element Still Remains for it to actually
[44:16] happen faith comes before manifestation
[44:19] Revelation then manifestation can we say
[44:21] amen I have not experienced the body
[44:23] change yet but I know it's coming amen
[44:27] and Saints I even know it to such a
[44:29] level brother Simon I'm sure you
[44:30] experienced the same thing that this
[44:32] body change that we speak of is really
[44:34] not something outside of us that we're
[44:36] going to run into or it's going to hit
[44:38] us but the body change as brother
[44:41] cleared it up for us thank God for the
[44:42] message called The Rapture and other
[44:44] places and questions and answers where
[44:46] he clears it up for
[44:48] us that it's already in
[44:50] you
[44:52] amen your body change is in you yes can
[44:56] you describe it to me
[44:59] then I don't believe
[45:00] you well then you're
[45:03] done if somebody says I don't believe
[45:05] you then they they shouldn't believe
[45:07] anything the physicists say CU all the
[45:09] stuff they say is
[45:10] craziness but somehow we do believe it
[45:12] somehow these physicists created an
[45:14] atomic bomb hydrogen bombs and other
[45:16] things out of this crazy knowledge so we
[45:19] have to believe it's true amen but it's
[45:22] in you tell The Inchworm or or the
[45:25] monarch butterfly larva that's crawling
[45:27] around eating leaves tell him he's not a
[45:28] monarch butteri go ahead where's your
[45:32] wings come on crazy you're just eating
[45:34] leaves and getting backat you don't have
[45:35] wings even if you had wings you couldn't
[45:37] fly if you wanted to how many ever
[45:40] experienced something like that on
[45:42] where's your wings you want to know
[45:44] where the wings are in that larva or
[45:46] whatever that thing is called in worm
[45:47] worm he right in
[45:50] them how's that possible well he goes
[45:52] into a cocoon stage and he's in his
[45:54] cocoon and all of a sudden the Cocoon
[45:55] falls off and there's these wings in
[45:57] there where did those come from they
[45:58] were in him all
[46:06] along now mentally and maybe to everyone
[46:09] else's appearance the Monarch Lara was
[46:12] eating leaves to survive eating leaves
[46:15] because he was hungry eating leaves be
[46:17] the biggest baddest worm out there maybe
[46:20] that was possible but the truth is the
[46:22] real hunger that was coming from the pit
[46:23] of
[46:24] stomach was the DNA
[46:27] that were in him
[46:29] unfulfilled I am DNA for
[46:32] wings I am making you hungry you need to
[46:36] eat if you don't eat enough you won't
[46:38] have enough to make a cocoon and if you
[46:40] don't make a cocoon you will not be able
[46:41] to produce meat and I am DNA for wings
[46:46] so you need enough for cocoon and wings
[46:48] so eat eat eat eat eat that's why you're
[46:51] eating here that's why you're here this
[46:55] morning I really hope come here oh I got
[46:58] to go to church oh I got to go to church
