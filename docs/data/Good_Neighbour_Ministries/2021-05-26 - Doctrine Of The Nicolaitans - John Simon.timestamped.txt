[0:19] o praise god glory and
[0:23] honor and adoration be to his marvelous
[0:27] and wonderful name we are here
[0:30] with another lesson
[0:33] from the seven church ages
[0:37] and this is entitled
[0:40] the doctrine of the nicolaitans
[0:45] praise god our scripture is found
[0:50] in revelation chapter
[0:53] 2 reading verse 15
[0:57] alone so
[1:02] hast thou also them that
[1:05] hold the doctrine of the nickelodeons
[1:10] which thing i hate
[1:13] i reiterate
[1:18] so has thou also
[1:21] them that hold the doctrine
[1:26] of the nickelodeon's rich
[1:29] thing i hate
[1:35] let us pray
[1:38] lord jesus great and
[1:42] sovereign lord king of
[1:45] kings lord of lords the
[1:49] almighty god we place ourselves within
[1:53] your hands
[1:55] and ask for divine utterance
[1:59] and direction of the mind and of the
[2:02] heart
[2:04] that we might be led into the paths of
[2:07] righteousness
[2:09] that we may be led into the paths
[2:14] you have ordained for us to go bringing
[2:17] light to the nations wherever they are
[2:22] shine your bright and shining light
[2:25] into the hearts of men and women here
[2:28] today
[2:30] oh god there are no boundaries
[2:34] with you no countries
[2:37] no borders with you but
[2:40] thy word goes forth lord god
[2:44] and run it swiftly to accomplish
[2:48] what you have lord god ordained for
[2:53] us for it to do so we give you glory
[2:57] praise and honor in jesus name
[3:00] amen and amen praise god
[3:04] hallelujah praise god wednesday evening
[3:10] and the doctrine of the nicolaitans
[3:14] of course we know the word doctrine
[3:16] doctore
[3:17] comes from teaching it means
[3:20] teaching right praise god
[3:24] so here it is the teaching or doctrine
[3:28] of the nickel lydians
[3:31] now you may have remembered before
[3:35] we talked just in a brief way on this
[3:39] how nico comes from saint nicholas
[3:43] that was back there and nicole
[3:47] that part of the word nico comes from
[3:51] nico las nico which means
[3:54] in greek to conquer
[3:58] nico means to conquer
[4:01] conquer the laity
[4:04] conquering the laity and
[4:08] here we find uh lao
[4:11] meaning laity
[4:17] meaning conquering the laity
[4:20] or the teaching on how
[4:23] to conquer control
[4:26] and dominate the laity
[4:30] of the church this is what we are here
[4:34] to speak about today
[4:36] nickelodeonism past nickelodeon present
[4:41] nickelodeonism future for it's
[4:44] here in the word of god
[4:47] now we know that god has never placed
[4:51] the leadership of his church
[4:55] into the hands of elected
[4:59] leadership god has never placed this
[5:02] church
[5:03] let me repeat into the hands
[5:07] of elected leadership elected pastors
[5:11] elected
[5:12] uh you know bishops elected whatever
[5:15] supervisor superintendents
[5:17] elected by numbers or whatever god
[5:21] has not did not place his church
[5:24] in the basis of elected leadership now
[5:27] we want
[5:28] just briefly mentioned matathias in the
[5:30] book of acts
[5:32] how that they tried to elect
[5:36] even the apostles write it and it wasn't
[5:38] wrong it was not god's will
[5:40] paul was supposed to be the next one
[5:44] to fill that gap but they ran ahead of
[5:48] god
[5:49] and they had lots drawn from atathias
[5:52] and his name is never mentioned again
[5:54] nothing ever
[5:55] told about them no accomplishments
[5:57] whatsoever
[5:58] but god spoke and used paul for his
[6:02] glory
[6:03] so god has never placed his church in
[6:07] the hands of elected leadership
[6:10] moving with political maneuvers
[6:14] and political actions and political
[6:18] mindedness in the way they act
[6:22] instead god has set in the church book
[6:25] of ephesians
[6:26] god has set in the church the various
[6:29] ministries
[6:30] that are supposed to be there god
[6:32] ordained and spirit-filled
[6:36] word living men and women men
[6:39] that will preach and declare
[6:43] the word of god through feeding the
[6:46] people
[6:47] on the bread of life which is the word
[6:50] of god
[6:51] itself and god also has never separated
[6:56] his people by classes or
[7:00] into classes but now what do we find the
[7:03] masses of people
[7:05] are led by a so-called holy
[7:09] priesthood we we
[7:12] agree and believe that the
[7:15] ministers ought to live holy lives
[7:20] but also so must the congregation
[7:23] live holy lives in the presence
[7:27] of almighty god hallelujah
[7:31] and the priest and the people
[7:34] ought to be worshipping god together
[7:37] there is no place where god separated
[7:40] the worship of the priests or the
[7:42] worship of the minister
[7:43] from the worship of the people it's all
[7:46] one
[7:47] worship and adoration and glory to the
[7:50] marvelous
[7:51] name of our lord and god wants us to
[7:54] love him
[7:56] and serve him together and
[7:59] we are all brothers whether
[8:04] i am the minister or someone else is the
[8:06] minister
[8:08] we are all brothers in jesus christ
[8:12] god has just placed me in this position
[8:16] of leadership to declare his word
[8:19] and so my brothers we must recognize
[8:23] that
[8:24] the god has no higher order
[8:27] no higher position than a than the
[8:30] genuine
[8:32] god sent holy spirit anointed
[8:36] minister of the gospel no higher
[8:39] authority
[8:40] is above that minister but jesus christ
[8:44] himself now nickelodeonism of course
[8:48] destroys those precepts and
[8:51] practices of god's genuine
[8:55] word and it instead
[8:58] separates the ministers separates the
[9:01] priests
[9:02] from the people and makes them
[9:06] of the lords
[9:09] makes them overlords instead of
[9:13] causing them to be servants
[9:16] now of course this didn't come out of
[9:19] nowhere
[9:20] uh we have been tracing and showing you
[9:23] how that spirit of
[9:24] nimrod of organizing in battalions and
[9:27] forming the first army
[9:29] and and stuff of that nature and assist
[9:32] various
[9:33] systems of conquering and that now has
[9:36] come into the spiritual
[9:38] realm down through various governments
[9:41] armies whether it's rome or whatever
[9:44] and now it's here in the spiritual form
[9:48] conquering and trying to conquer
[9:51] and dominate everywhere
[9:54] that it goes now this
[9:57] doctrine actually reared its
[10:00] snake-like head
[10:03] in the first age
[10:06] [Music]
[10:08] and the problem lay in the use of two
[10:11] words mainly
[10:12] elders and bishops
[10:16] now their thought was uh
[10:19] a bishop is higher than an
[10:22] elder and and and they they placed it
[10:25] like two offices
[10:27] in the church not realizing what it
[10:31] really was
[10:33] teaching the idea that a bishop has
[10:36] preeminence
[10:37] and has authority and control
[10:41] over elders which truth of course
[10:45] is not in the word of god today
[10:49] it's not in the word of god at any time
[10:52] you will not find it there
[10:54] for we know that the word elder
[10:57] signifies the
[10:58] chronological age
[11:01] of that person right in the lord
[11:05] and in their walk with god in their life
[11:09] elder only speaks of chronological
[11:12] age in the lord
[11:16] that's what the man is he's just an
[11:20] elder that's what he is
[11:23] and bishop is the
[11:26] office position of the man
[11:30] of course according to the bible the
[11:33] word
[11:33] bishop actually means pastor
[11:37] or shepherd it's not different
[11:40] but they have placed the word bishop
[11:43] as to make it someone higher
[11:46] than the pastor higher than the elder
[11:50] and someone who exerts preeminence
[11:54] authority and control
[11:58] that of course is a man-made idea
[12:02] implanted and inserted within the word
[12:06] of god
[12:07] for it is not found in your
[12:10] bible the man is called an elder
[12:14] because he's been a seasoned
[12:18] in the presence of the lord ripened
[12:21] by the word of god hallelujah
[12:26] trained by the holy spirit of almighty
[12:29] god
[12:30] and under the heart of the son
[12:35] of the sign of leo the land the land of
[12:38] the tribe of judah
[12:40] that same son that writes the fruit
[12:43] in august is the same s
[12:46] o n that shines upon the son of god and
[12:50] sons and daughters of god
[12:52] to write them in their experience and in
[12:55] their walk with god
[12:57] hallelujah amen so when the word
[13:00] elders use it means one that is not a
[13:04] novice one that is not new
[13:07] or johnny come lately no but
[13:11] one that's been around for a while
[13:14] and has been steeped like like tea
[13:17] if i might say that steeped in the
[13:20] spirit
[13:21] in the word the wine of the holy ghost
[13:24] hallelujah and their life has imbibed
[13:28] praise god and taken in the influences
[13:32] of the holy spirit upon them amen
[13:36] praise god so he's called an elder
[13:39] not because he's elected to that
[13:42] position
[13:43] or ordained into that position
[13:46] but because he is just older
[13:49] elder just means he's just older
[13:53] and he's been around with god and in the
[13:56] word
[13:56] for a longer time the message for a
[14:00] longer
[14:01] time amen praise god
[14:04] hallelujah amen so
[14:08] we find out my brothers and sisters
[14:11] that we were completely overlooking the
[14:14] word of god hallelujah
[14:17] and to them they believe
[14:20] that a bishop has extended authority
[14:24] in other words he's not a pastor that's
[14:26] how they're thinking that's not the word
[14:29] of god
[14:30] they think the pastor has local
[14:33] authority in his local area
[14:37] but neglectionism
[14:40] teaches that the bishop has
[14:43] power over pastors
[14:46] and his power extends to various
[14:50] parishes various countries
[14:54] various provinces various states
[14:58] whatever
[14:59] and and his powers are over arching
[15:02] power
[15:04] and so they believe the bishop having a
[15:08] higher power
[15:09] not realizing and recognizing that even
[15:12] at 18 years old
[15:14] timothy was already a bishop
[15:18] and bishop just meaning that he was the
[15:20] pastor
[15:21] of that church praise god and
[15:25] but in his church there were elders
[15:28] that were older than he was uh praise
[15:31] god
[15:32] but he was the pastor by his office he
[15:35] was the bishop by his office
[15:37] doesn't mean he has power over churches
[15:40] everywhere like that no
[15:41] but it means that he was the pastor over
[15:45] his church there for the glory of god
[15:49] so friends we see clearly in the word of
[15:52] god
[15:54] amen that many of these
[15:57] people or so-called bishops leaned
[16:01] towards organization and what started as
[16:05] a deed
[16:06] in the first age became a teaching
[16:10] or a doctrine as we
[16:13] as time moved on
[16:17] to this day and to this hour
[16:21] bishops so-called bishops
[16:24] are claiming power authority preeminence
[16:28] and control over
[16:32] men and they believe they can deal with
[16:36] men as their desire
[16:38] they believe they can take one preacher
[16:41] or priest from
[16:42] this diocese or from this a part of his
[16:46] church or
[16:46] this place where he is or take him out
[16:49] of a certain church
[16:51] and place whoever they wish
[16:54] in there and throw that man aside as an
[16:58] old shoe
[16:59] or place him in some secondary place
[17:02] as they wish they believe that's their
[17:05] power
[17:06] to place them wherever they will in
[17:08] ministry
[17:09] and when they do that they're denying
[17:12] the power of the holy spirit
[17:14] himself amen the god
[17:18] of the bible who said into the apostles
[17:22] separate me paul and barnabas
[17:25] for the work where unto i
[17:29] have called them so god would separate
[17:32] his own men
[17:35] separate them and anoint them for the
[17:39] task at hand that's the work of god
[17:42] sons and daughters of god not led by the
[17:44] bishop led by the
[17:46] pope but led by the holy spirit
[17:49] amen sons and daughters of god are led
[17:52] by the holy spirit as god leads them
[17:56] and guides them for his glory of course
[17:59] we know
[18:00] that everything separate contrary to
[18:03] that is anti-word
[18:05] anti-god anti-christ amen
[18:09] matthew chapter 20 verses
[18:12] 25 to 28
[18:16] jesus spoke speaking to his disciples
[18:20] said you know that the
[18:23] princes of the gentiles
[18:28] exercise dominion
[18:31] domination over them
[18:36] and they that are great
[18:39] exercise authority
[18:42] upon them listen to this
[18:46] but it shall not be so
[18:49] amongst you for whosoever
[18:53] will be great among you
[18:57] let him be your servant
[19:00] amen let him be your servant
[19:04] even as the son of man came
[19:08] not to be ministered onto
[19:11] but to minister and to give his
[19:15] life a ransom for many
[19:18] o praise be to god so god has called
[19:23] the man of god the
[19:26] pastors ministers to be
[19:30] your brothers in christ just like you
[19:33] are only we did not
[19:37] ask for this position we did not ask for
[19:40] this
[19:40] leadership we did not ask to be made
[19:44] to a preacher a priest or whatever
[19:47] we we didn't ask for it but god by his
[19:50] divine
[19:51] calling of his holy spirit not by his
[19:54] mother's asking him to become a preacher
[19:58] not by his father not by some
[20:01] bishop not by somebody else no
[20:04] but the holy spirit of almighty god
[20:08] already put the mark of a minister upon
[20:11] that person
[20:12] god anoints them with his divine holy
[20:14] spirit
[20:15] god vindicates them by the power of the
[20:18] holy ghost
[20:19] amen amen and man is only used to
[20:22] confirm
[20:23] what god has already placed inside of
[20:26] that person
[20:27] oh blessed be the name of the living god
[20:31] amen praise god listen
[20:35] matthew 23 verses 8 to 9
[20:38] be not ye
[20:43] called rabbi that's like
[20:47] being not ye called father
[20:50] be not you called rabbi
[20:54] you know what people go around calling
[20:57] you oh
[20:58] father this father father that father
[21:01] the other
[21:02] listen to jesus himself listen to how
[21:05] the word of god
[21:07] is totally disobeyed pushed aside
[21:10] and given no no confidence no relevance
[21:15] and
[21:16] simply slipped it on the people and they
[21:18] accepted and believe it
[21:20] not knowing what the word of god says i
[21:23] repeat
[21:24] be not ye called rabbi
[21:28] for one is your master
[21:31] even christ and all
[21:35] you all you are brethren
[21:39] amen and call no
[21:42] men your father
[21:46] upon the earth for
[21:50] one is your father
[21:54] which is in heaven god is not speaking
[21:57] of your natural
[21:58] father he's speaking spiritually
[22:02] call no man amen
[22:05] father amen praise god
[22:09] father this father that father dominic
[22:12] father
[22:13] whatever you are to call no man father
[22:16] and it's
[22:16] in the book it's in the word of god
[22:20] amen for you only have one father
[22:24] and that father is the lord himself
[22:27] who is in heaven revelation 13
[22:31] 3 speaks about nicoletanism
[22:35] and describes it as the beast whose head
[22:38] was wounded
[22:40] unto death revelation 13
[22:43] verse 3 and i saw one
[22:46] of his heads as it were
[22:50] wounded to death and his
[22:54] deadly wound was healed
[22:59] and all the world wandered after
[23:02] the beast we're looking in the word of
[23:06] god
[23:08] and we're seeing friends how that the
[23:11] old pagan
[23:12] roman imperial roman empire
[23:17] was wounded unto death
[23:22] and how it was able
[23:25] to transform itself rome
[23:29] the imperial power which was a great
[23:33] political world power
[23:37] and how it experience
[23:40] uh a spiritual
[23:44] resurrection from the dead as it were
[23:48] one day unto death but resurrected
[23:52] and transformed
[23:56] pagan imperial political rome
[24:02] transformed itself from being a military
[24:05] and political world power
[24:09] to people or papal
[24:13] rome a spiritual
[24:17] religious and political
[24:21] world power from natural
[24:25] to spiritual now remember
[24:28] this is all going on from the teachings
[24:32] of the nicolasians of course
[24:36] rome's basis of her
[24:40] military success was based
[24:43] on the thought of divide and conquer
[24:49] now that precept that teaching
[24:52] prevails today amongst
[24:55] governments nations of the world
[24:59] still base themselves on that thought
[25:03] that idea that seed from satan that was
[25:06] planted
[25:07] divide and conquer within each country
[25:11] that goes on within each uh
[25:14] part of the world that goes on divide
[25:17] and conquer
[25:18] if you can split races against races of
[25:21] people
[25:22] uh weaken both sides then so you can
[25:25] come out as the power or whatever but
[25:28] that's goes into the realm of politics
[25:32] that goes into every round it permeates
[25:37] the entire earth or dirt
[25:40] that the iron and clay was supposed to
[25:42] be mixed
[25:44] and here we find their thought of divide
[25:47] and conquer
[25:48] that seed of satan and so
[25:52] with her iron teeth the legions of rome
[25:56] marched they trampled
[26:00] and destroyed conquered everywhere
[26:04] they went the eagle of
[26:08] of the legions of rome went everywhere
[26:12] conquering everywhere that they
[26:15] went and then
[26:18] she destroyed carthage according to
[26:22] history
[26:24] she destroyed carthage completely
[26:27] praise god and then
[26:30] that same spirit that
[26:33] iron hard cruel
[26:36] iron spirit can move now from natural to
[26:41] spiritual
[26:42] but it continued with its
[26:46] uh pillaging and its destruction
[26:49] in the same way raising up as a
[26:52] false church with the same spirit and
[26:56] anointing
[26:57] upon her to divide and conquer
[27:02] and her to this day her policy
[27:05] remains the same for out of her
[27:08] is what came all the denominations that
[27:12] are out there
[27:13] is the same top principle divide
[27:17] and conquer and her policy remains the
[27:20] same
[27:21] and that is what the bible describes
[27:25] scribes
[27:26] as nicole latianism
[27:29] how to conquer and control
[27:34] the laity not by controlling the body
[27:37] but
[27:38] so much controlling the mind and
[27:41] spirit by false doctrine
[27:44] false teachings contrary to the word of
[27:48] god
[27:49] and control this exercise over
[27:53] not millions but billions around the
[27:56] world
[27:57] being controlled by this teaching
[28:01] of necro-lithianism and the bible tells
[28:05] us
[28:05] in revelation 2 15
[28:09] which thing i hate
[28:12] god hates organization
[28:16] god not order but god hates
[28:19] organization god hates their systems
[28:23] of control that they place within their
[28:27] so-called organizations
[28:29] to move and control
[28:33] the people well
[28:36] my friends we find
[28:41] that by their
[28:45] political powers
[28:48] by their thought
[28:52] of divide and conquer divide and
[28:55] dominate divide and control
[29:01] oh think of the word
[29:04] denomination just going to throw this up
[29:07] quickly
[29:08] dominate denominate
[29:13] denomination dominion
[29:19] denominational
[29:22] conquering and domination
[29:25] over the mind of men
[29:28] and so nickelodeonism
[29:33] has led the church world into politics
[29:39] yes this political party that political
[29:42] party the other political party
[29:44] oh and so the church is caught up
[29:48] today in politics
[29:52] and policies
[29:55] filled with pride
[29:59] and the pump of position
[30:03] nickelodeonism has led to jealousies in
[30:06] the church
[30:08] even hatred
[30:11] think of it one person believing that
[30:15] jesus is the christ
[30:16] and yet claiming hatred
[30:20] against their brothers their sisters
[30:23] in jesus christ not disagreeing
[30:28] not being disagree of disagreeing
[30:31] without being disagreeable
[30:35] i can disagree with you without being
[30:37] disagreeable
[30:39] and he hateful and nasty
[30:42] or anything like that but that's not
[30:44] what it is they
[30:45] will hate you enough to persecute you
[30:48] and jesus said even to
[30:50] kill you amen and that is the spirit of
[30:54] nicolasianism
[30:55] that has been hiding back of these
[31:00] skin veil of religious man
[31:04] and women and membership and they don't
[31:07] realize it
[31:08] until the word of god exposes it
[31:12] light is shined upon it and then it
[31:15] it rears its head and it's ready to
[31:18] pounce at you
[31:19] and come against you in every possible
[31:21] way
[31:23] neglectionism also lead to
[31:26] intellectualism
[31:28] for if i'm brighter than you and this
[31:30] one is brighter than the other one
[31:32] they can climb their way up the
[31:33] religious ladder
[31:35] and so that leads also to the spirit of
[31:38] competitiveness
[31:40] within the house of god and within this
[31:44] church of the living god nickelodeonism
[31:48] leads to all of that so when this era
[31:52] crept into the church
[31:56] and this office of the bishop
[32:00] began to have more and more
[32:04] power man started to compete
[32:09] and undercut subvert trick
[32:12] fight and in some cases even
[32:16] uh like in the days of martin luther
[32:18] paid for their position
[32:20] paid the higher ups so they can get
[32:23] a lofty position of a bishop an
[32:26] archbishop or or
[32:28] a cardinal that paid monies to get some
[32:31] of those positions not
[32:33] all of them paid but some of them
[32:36] literally
[32:36] paid for that position and so this
[32:40] position
[32:41] began to be given to those who were
[32:44] better educated
[32:48] also it was given to those whose parents
[32:51] mothers fathers families had more money
[32:54] or were materially progressive
[32:57] they started to give those positions
[32:59] like that
[33:01] and also to men
[33:05] who had they could see
[33:08] that the person has political talent
[33:12] they had political talent the ability to
[33:16] sway
[33:16] and to move men and quickly
[33:19] they will give them a position so they
[33:22] can use
[33:23] that talent that gift for their own
[33:26] purposes
[33:27] and for their own plans in that way
[33:32] human knowledge and
[33:35] church programs and plants
[33:38] began to take over instead
[33:42] of the leading and guidance
[33:46] of the holy spirit himself
[33:50] my friends what a tragic age
[33:54] and a tragic time so the holy spirit
[33:58] no longer was able to control
[34:01] his church what an evil
[34:06] that these bishops would take control
[34:11] over the people of god
[34:14] and they began to claim uh
[34:18] it's not necessary for a bishop
[34:21] to maintain a transparent
[34:24] christian character or holy christian
[34:27] life
[34:29] uh to minister the word of god
[34:32] you see because the host
[34:35] the host that they usually give to the
[34:38] people
[34:38] the holiness is in the host therefore
[34:42] i don't have to be holy the the priest
[34:45] the bishop
[34:45] doesn't necessarily have to be holy as
[34:48] long as the holiness is
[34:49] in the host amen that's the way
[34:53] they begin to think of it that the host
[34:56] must be considered holy so he doesn't
[34:59] have to be holy
[35:00] to minister the rights of the church
[35:04] the word of god or the elements
[35:08] of the ceremony of god
[35:11] amen and when they begin to
[35:14] talk and teach like that
[35:18] evil man began to creep in
[35:22] to the branches of this
[35:25] tree begin to lodge
[35:28] within the branches of this
[35:31] evil tree seducers
[35:34] waxing worse and worse
[35:38] to rend and destroy the flock of god
[35:42] amongst them well
[35:46] with this man-made doctrine of the
[35:49] elevation of bishops
[35:52] to a higher place which is not in the
[35:55] scripture
[35:56] it's not recorded anywhere in the
[35:58] scripture
[36:00] the next step from that was to begin to
[36:04] hand out or give out graded
[36:08] titles titles began to be
[36:12] given up within the church
[36:15] and soon they developed the position
[36:19] of the archbishop above the bishop
[36:23] and of course a richer more powerful
[36:27] more influential or more talented maybe
[36:30] poor but maybe talented in certain
[36:34] ways and his skills and talents are
[36:37] needed
[36:38] then they will now have there was
[36:40] cardinals
[36:41] began to be elevated above
[36:44] those arch bishops and by the time
[36:48] of uh bony face bony face
[36:53] we find that there
[36:56] rose up a pope over
[36:59] all of these cardinals and archbishops
[37:02] and
[37:03] bishops and priests and and
[37:06] no you know nuns and nova
[37:10] the the nova what you call it again they
[37:13] forgot the
[37:13] nova novites they were young
[37:17] and so my friends novices
[37:20] uh rose up above them and so now here
[37:24] comes a pontiff
[37:26] or a pope over all of this
[37:29] hierarchy for this was the development
[37:34] of a religious hierarchy not
[37:37] found in the word of god it is
[37:40] not in your bible it's a man-made
[37:44] man-sanctioned man-created
[37:48] man-positioned and placed
[37:51] in the church of god
[37:55] now with this necrolytion
[38:00] or this conquering or this teaching
[38:04] of how to dominate the world
[38:08] the laity and the people of the world
[38:11] not by military might but by religious
[38:15] ideas
[38:16] and thoughts figments traditions
[38:20] mythologies coming from the
[38:24] uh morass the swamp of the minds of men
[38:28] and not from the presence of almighty
[38:30] god
[38:32] spewing and spreading the slime across
[38:35] the face of the world
[38:37] with which to capture all who would step
[38:40] right into that now friends here we are
[38:45] this amalgamation
[38:49] of christianity with ancient
[38:53] babylonianism paganism
[38:57] with the wounded head of the beast
[39:00] rising again
[39:03] that we see the progression
[39:07] of mystery babylon
[39:10] entered into and growing in
[39:14] strength within the religious realm
[39:18] oh my you say brother simon why do you
[39:21] brothers preach so hard against
[39:24] denominationalism
[39:25] they are they're christians too they are
[39:28] brothers too well
[39:29] in name the in name
[39:32] but taking the name just taking the name
[39:35] and using it
[39:36] doesn't mean you even know what you have
[39:39] it's like a man holding a lion's tail or
[39:42] a tiger's tail and think he has a rope
[39:44] oh god have mercy what a day in time
[39:48] we're living in listen this
[39:52] ezekiel saw it ezekiel 8
[39:56] verse 10 the prophet ezekiel speaking
[40:01] so i went in and saw
[40:05] and behold every form of creeping things
[40:10] he's seeing now the idols
[40:13] in back in all israel when they drifted
[40:17] away from
[40:17] god and god showed him
[40:21] how they had idols shaped like beasts
[40:25] idols shaped like abominable beasts and
[40:29] creeping things
[40:31] on all the idols of the house
[40:34] of israel not only did they have idols
[40:39] but they have beautiful artistic
[40:42] pictures of these idols on the walls
[40:45] listen
[40:46] and portrayed upon the walls
[40:50] around i saw oh my
[40:54] listen lots goes on as religious
[40:57] art and religious this releases that
[40:59] it's the same
[41:00] spirit moving in that way revelation 18
[41:04] 2 and the mighty angel
[41:08] came down crying with mightily with a
[41:11] strong voice saying
[41:13] babylon the greatest fallen is fallen
[41:17] is fallen and has become the habitation
[41:23] or the house of hell
[41:26] the house of devils
[41:29] and the hold of every foul spirit
[41:34] and the cage of every
[41:38] unclean and hateful
[41:41] bird for all nations
[41:45] have drunk of the wine of the
[41:48] wrath of our fornications
[41:51] i would also like to place the scripture
[41:54] of
[41:54] mark chapter 4 verses 30 to 30 flow for
[42:00] in which jesus foresaw this
[42:04] and was telling it to his disciples
[42:07] in a parable in which he
[42:11] said he saw this invasion
[42:15] into the church and he gave it as a part
[42:18] in the form of a mustard seed
[42:21] he said does it not grow into one of the
[42:25] greatest trees
[42:27] but then he says all mirror
[42:30] birds begin to come and
[42:34] hide or flock and roast
[42:38] under the shadow of christianity roost
[42:41] in its branches
[42:43] hide under that cloak and begin to use
[42:46] it for their own purposes
[42:48] read mark 4 30 your verse 34
[42:53] and so these foul words
[42:55] [Music]
[42:56] you might have a a wonderful
[42:59] eagle seated on one branch
[43:02] and on the other branch is a mockingbird
[43:06] over on one branch you may see a
[43:09] beautiful
[43:10] hummingbird or a canary
[43:13] and on the other side is a nightingale
[43:16] oh my god have mercy over one side my
[43:20] friends
[43:21] you see one beautiful word the other
[43:23] side there's a buzzard
[43:25] oh there's a carrion crow what
[43:28] have mercy that's what has happened to
[43:31] the church of god
[43:32] in this day and in this hour in which we
[43:36] live
[43:36] living in and we are witnesses of these
[43:40] things we are living in the days of what
[43:43] the fulfillment of scripture the
[43:47] manifestation
[43:48] of prophecies mentioned within
[43:51] the word of god lord jesus
[43:55] have mercy upon us friends and so
[43:58] this nicoleton doctrine
[44:02] but you know thank god god always has a
[44:05] few
[44:06] he always has a witness not everybody
[44:10] accepted
[44:11] that nicolettian doctrine back there
[44:15] not at all and so when they
[44:18] went out to establish it as a rule
[44:21] within the church it did not
[44:24] hit off well with some of the
[44:28] genuine saints of the living god
[44:32] amen for they had read the epistles of
[44:35] paul that
[44:35] read the word of god and they knew the
[44:39] difference
[44:40] and what the word of god says so what
[44:43] did the church do
[44:44] what did the so-called church at that
[44:47] time do
[44:48] the false church began to excommunicate
[44:52] excommunicate them and
[44:56] also began to try to burn the scrolls
[45:01] and writings of all the prophets
[45:05] and apostles that were around
[45:08] and they were persecuted if they were
[45:11] found to have those scrolls those
[45:14] writings
[45:15] reading them you wouldn't know it
[45:18] because now it's just like jesus said
[45:20] uh today they killed the prophets
[45:23] and tomorrow when they realized that
[45:25] those were real prophets
[45:27] they dig them up and then they they put
[45:29] a beautiful
[45:31] around them and they begin to worship
[45:34] there
[45:34] and praise him but they're the very ones
[45:37] that kill them
[45:38] and call it a shrine now they will end
[45:41] up reading all those epistles and
[45:42] reading all the prophets
[45:44] but back there that killed people for
[45:47] reading them
[45:48] for believing the prophets believing
[45:50] these apostles
[45:52] and walking in the light of the word
[45:55] amen praise god and they begin to teach
[46:01] that the ordinary man should not read
[46:03] those scrolls
[46:04] or read these prophets they can't
[46:07] understand it
[46:10] it takes a special education
[46:13] to read and understand the word of god
[46:18] and you know that many years for
[46:20] centuries later
[46:21] they were putting locks on the bibles
[46:25] locks on the word of god lock and key
[46:29] locking it away from the people under
[46:33] the
[46:33] spirit of domination dominating
[46:37] dividing and conquering
[46:41] yes sir and so
[46:44] after taking away the word from the
[46:46] people
[46:48] it soon came to the fact that the people
[46:50] had to go
[46:51] into these so-called houses of worship
[46:54] and just listen to the priests
[46:57] listen to the minister then
[47:00] because they could not read the word for
[47:02] themselves to compare
[47:04] whether what he was saying is true or
[47:07] not true
[47:08] they don't even know where when he
[47:10] speaks in
[47:11] latin or greek or whatever what he's
[47:14] cursing or swearing
[47:15] they just accepted that oh it sounds
[47:18] holy so it must be good
[47:20] and there it is my friends they began to
[47:24] literally swallow or believe
[47:28] everything those so-called
[47:31] priesthood said they accepted that
[47:36] as gospel not knowing
[47:39] that they were rejecting or bypassing
[47:42] the true gospel of the
[47:45] word of god and so
[47:48] they by that means that false
[47:52] church listen close was able to take
[47:55] over the
[47:56] minds to begin to conquer
[48:00] and take over the minds
[48:04] have mind control soul
[48:07] control spirit control over the people
[48:12] at that time and of their life
[48:16] and brought them to a place
[48:20] of servants
[48:24] controlled by a denom
[48:28] dominating and this despotic
[48:31] priesthood controlling them
[48:35] until they become servants of the woman
[48:38] servants of the church instead of
[48:41] servants
[48:42] of the word of god amen
[48:45] we're not called to be servants of the
[48:47] church even though
[48:49] we will by our own
[48:53] hearts of gratitude thankfulness and
[48:56] love
[48:57] serve in the church
[49:02] but we are called to be servants of
[49:05] god amen so
[49:08] instead these people were servants of
[49:10] the church
[49:11] instead of being servants of the holy
[49:15] word of god now according to an edict
[49:20] by emperor theodosius
[49:23] the 10th
[49:26] listen he was baptized into
[49:30] the first church of rome and he ought to
[49:34] give this edict we three emperors
[49:39] will that our subjects
[49:43] steadfastly adhere to the religion
[49:48] which was taught by saint peter to the
[49:51] romans
[49:52] of course we will not speak of that now
[49:56] but peter was never in rome
[49:59] it is not in history not in pagan
[50:02] history not in world history
[50:04] it is in nowhere that peter ever
[50:07] went to rome so put that in your
[50:11] uh in your mind and just think about it
[50:14] [Laughter]
[50:17] oh my they said he said
[50:23] adhere to the religion as taught by
[50:26] saint peter
[50:27] to the romans a lie
[50:31] which has been faithfully preserved
[50:35] by our transit traditions preserved by
[50:39] traditions
[50:41] not by the holy spirit not by
[50:44] the god of heaven but preserved
[50:48] by their traditions
[50:51] which is now professed
[50:55] by the pontiff the damascus of
[50:59] rome so it was
[51:03] preserved by tradition and we believe it
[51:06] now because
[51:07] it's being professed oh my
[51:11] professed by the pontiff
[51:15] of rome then my friends
[51:19] according to the institution
[51:22] of the apostles and the doctrine of the
[51:25] gospel
[51:27] he continues listen closely
[51:31] let us believe in one godhead
[51:35] of the father
[51:38] of the son and
[51:42] of the holy spirit
[51:45] of equal majesty
[51:49] in the holy trinity not found in the
[51:52] word of god
[51:53] either just a slight twist of the tale
[51:58] away from the word of god sounds like
[52:02] scripture but it's not in the scripture
[52:05] we order listen to this now they're
[52:08] going to
[52:08] force people to believe this faith force
[52:12] people to believe this religion until
[52:15] generations after people are being born
[52:18] into it born into it
[52:19] and immediately yes they're born they
[52:21] believe that makes them
[52:23] christian catholic they're born into it
[52:25] they believe that makes them
[52:27] christian catholic and that is contrary
[52:30] to the word of god
[52:31] now listen we order
[52:35] let the adherents or believers of this
[52:38] faith
[52:39] be called catholic christians
[52:42] is differentiating them from the rest of
[52:45] so
[52:46] of christians that were there there in
[52:48] the world
[52:49] no we are now catholic christians
[52:53] of course we know catholic means
[52:54] universal but here it is
[52:57] we brand all senseless followers
[53:01] of these other religions
[53:05] with the infamous name of heretics
[53:08] anybody that believes different from
[53:10] them right now
[53:12] that spirit is sleeping and they're
[53:15] allowing all these
[53:16] wants to function but when they have
[53:19] come to the complete
[53:21] power and they manifest their power
[53:25] every one of them will have to grow out
[53:27] of let me use the word out of business
[53:30] and come under that one world council
[53:33] one
[53:34] acumenism or they're going to be
[53:36] decimated
[53:37] and destroyed completely listen he says
[53:40] here
[53:41] all these we brand these
[53:44] followers of other religions with the
[53:48] infamous name
[53:49] of heretics and forbid
[53:53] their their conventicals
[53:57] assuming the names of churches in other
[54:01] words they shouldn't even call
[54:03] themselves churches
[54:04] but because there's only one true church
[54:07] that
[54:07] is the holy roman
[54:10] catholic church that's what they believe
[54:14] because my friends the condemnation of
[54:18] divine justice
[54:20] they must expect the heavy penalties
[54:26] which our authority guided by heavenly
[54:30] wisdom
[54:31] shall think to inflict upon them now
[54:34] they're forcing people
[54:36] to believe this false teaching
[54:40] of nucleationism of divide and conquer
[54:44] and it started that way until now it has
[54:48] become
[54:49] a tradition it has become something
[54:52] people are born into the church
[54:55] born into it they're not even forced
[54:57] anymore because they're willingly
[54:59] accepted my mother was a catholic my
[55:01] mother was
[55:01] a methodist my mother was a baptist i
[55:03] was born into that
[55:05] therefore i'm one too and god doesn't
[55:08] have grandchildren because it never will
[55:10] work that way
[55:12] amen 15 laws
[55:15] of penalty this emperor
[55:18] issued and thereby deprived
[55:23] genuine true believers evangelical
[55:28] in faith all rights of exercising
[55:32] their faith and their their religion
[55:36] and punish them by beginning to first of
[55:39] all
[55:40] exclude them from government
[55:43] positions begin to put them out
[55:47] from holding government posts if you
[55:50] want to haul the government post you got
[55:52] to be a member
[55:53] of so-and-so like that and
[55:57] my friends threaten them with fines
[56:01] if they don't bow down and accept
[56:04] that teaching
[56:07] threaten them with confiscation of their
[56:10] properties
[56:13] confiscation of their wealth
[56:16] or whatever they have and also
[56:19] banishment
[56:20] from rome they'll banish them out of
[56:23] rome
[56:23] have to leave their business leave their
[56:26] whatever they have
[56:27] out of there and in some cases
[56:30] they even inflicted upon them death
[56:36] my friends we are headed that way today
[56:41] the roman catholic church calls herself
[56:44] even to this day
[56:46] the holy mother church she calls herself
[56:49] the first
[56:51] original church
[56:54] and that is absolutely correct
[56:58] because she is the first one
[57:01] to backslide into sin like eve did in
[57:05] the garden
[57:06] she backslid away from the word of god
[57:11] and also like
[57:14] nimrod in the beginning she was the
[57:17] first to begin to organize herself
[57:20] in a hierarchy
[57:24] of orders and positions
[57:27] of power religious power within
[57:31] the confines of the church
[57:35] and hear the deeds
[57:39] and then the doctrine of the nicolasians
[57:43] no one will deny that this church
[57:47] is a mother for that mother has produced
[57:51] daughters
[57:53] and straight to the point we know of how
[57:56] protestantism arose that martin luther
[58:00] actually
[58:01] came out of the womb of the catholic
[58:05] roman catholic church
[58:07] and from luther all the protestant
[58:11] organizations denominations of this day
[58:15] whatever they want to call themselves
[58:17] you can even trace it
[58:19] in the in the orders of denominations
[58:21] how they came from luther and
[58:24] how they came out and they broke out
[58:26] with zwingli
[58:27] and and hosts and all these men and
[58:30] began to
[58:31] spiral out and become a tree of
[58:34] knowledge religious knowledge
[58:36] of good and evil here it is my friends
[58:39] and so from her
[58:43] came all these denominations
[58:46] her daughters all these pro so-called
[58:49] protestant churches
[58:51] and the catholic church sits back with a
[58:53] smile on her face
[58:54] knowing that those are all her daughters
[58:56] and even though some may even go out
[58:58] preaching against her
[58:59] saying things against them and speaking
[59:02] but as long as they
[59:04] hold to the original teaching
[59:08] of the holy trinity they are still
[59:11] daughters of that mother as still
[59:16] as they continue my friends in the
[59:19] teaching
[59:20] of the tri-unity of god
[59:23] or trinity of god regardless of what
[59:27] name
[59:27] of churches they put on themselves
[59:30] there's still
[59:31] are daughters to that mother whom the
[59:35] bible describes
[59:36] she's a harlot a to the word of
[59:40] the living god
[59:42] oh my a wow a woman
[59:46] married to god
[59:50] untrue to her marriage vows
[59:54] like eve was married to adam untrue to
[59:57] her marriage vows
[59:59] then went with the serpent and brought
[1:00:02] forth nothing but a
[1:00:03] bastard hybrid came
[1:00:07] so did that first church
[1:00:10] went away from the word of god
[1:00:13] and went and had
[1:00:17] a union with babylonianism
[1:00:21] nickelodeonism and next week we'll speak
[1:00:24] about their union with
[1:00:27] and produce nothing but monstrosity
[1:00:31] married to god and fornicating with the
[1:00:34] devil
[1:00:35] amen bringing forth daughters with the
[1:00:38] same
[1:00:39] kind of attitude like you they may not
[1:00:41] call themselves the they have the same
[1:00:43] organizations
[1:00:45] pope cardinals archbishop bishops down
[1:00:48] to the priests
[1:00:49] one may change the name superintendent
[1:00:51] general superintendent
[1:00:53] down to local uh superintendent and on
[1:00:56] down to the local pastor and so on and
[1:00:59] you go
[1:01:00] through it it'll go from head presbyter
[1:01:02] they may change the names
[1:01:04] but the organizational reality is
[1:01:07] exactly the same and they continue
[1:01:11] to propagate the same doctrines and same
[1:01:15] teachings under their mother as
[1:01:18] franchises
[1:01:20] and my friends as showing their
[1:01:23] relationship
[1:01:24] spiritually with her think of it
[1:01:28] and saw them we are looking in our day
[1:01:32] at her mother and child reunion mother
[1:01:35] and daughter's reunion
[1:01:37] reuniting again of the world cups of
[1:01:39] churches
[1:01:40] ecumenism ecumenism is on the move
[1:01:43] friends
[1:01:44] they're once more coming together into a
[1:01:47] religious
[1:01:47] unity what was not obvious before
[1:01:51] is beginning to come obvious where
[1:01:54] evangelical ministers take it as a a
[1:01:57] matter of pride
[1:01:59] of being going to the rome for an
[1:02:02] audience
[1:02:03] with papa with the pope and
[1:02:06] bowing down and kissing the so-called
[1:02:09] ring my lord have mercy
[1:02:12] god help every one of us back to the
[1:02:15] word back to the bible
[1:02:17] back to the original faith trust in him
[1:02:19] who will not leave you
[1:02:21] oh praise god hallelujah amen
[1:02:25] those bishops early bishops begin to
[1:02:28] think they were above the word
[1:02:32] they began to teach and tell the people
[1:02:34] they could forgive sins
[1:02:36] they didn't have to go to jesus anymore
[1:02:39] they didn't have to bow their knees and
[1:02:42] cry out and
[1:02:43] sorrow of repentance before god anymore
[1:02:47] but if you want a crowd to god cry out
[1:02:49] to me and so
[1:02:51] they would go into the confessional box
[1:02:54] and they'll tell the people
[1:02:57] i will forgive your sins and when you
[1:02:59] confess you you don't need to confess to
[1:03:02] god
[1:03:02] confess to a a sinner like yourself
[1:03:06] garbed in human robes
[1:03:09] and confess to the sinner like yourself
[1:03:11] the bible doesn't tell you
[1:03:13] that the bible tells you you must
[1:03:16] confess to the lord jesus christ
[1:03:18] the bible tells you my friends only he
[1:03:21] has the power to forgive your sins
[1:03:24] amen praise god you begin to
[1:03:28] baptize people baptized infants
[1:03:31] only in the second century baptizing
[1:03:35] infants
[1:03:36] listen this is all the seduction of
[1:03:39] satan
[1:03:40] acts 2 38 tells you repent
[1:03:44] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:03:47] name of jesus christ for the remission
[1:03:49] of your sins
[1:03:49] your sins won't be forgiven listen until
[1:03:52] you repent
[1:03:53] and here it is how's the baby going to
[1:03:55] repent how's that infant going to repent
[1:03:57] how's a child
[1:03:58] going to repent but they determine in
[1:04:00] their way
[1:04:01] they are going to baptize infants it's
[1:04:04] not in the word
[1:04:05] of the living god and this they also
[1:04:08] began to teach
[1:04:10] regenerational water baptism
[1:04:14] in other words you're baptized in the
[1:04:16] church
[1:04:17] and you're saved you're saved by being
[1:04:21] baptized into the church
[1:04:23] the bible doesn't say that it says
[1:04:26] repent
[1:04:28] and then be baptized and
[1:04:32] in the name of jesus christ then you'll
[1:04:35] receive the gift of the holy spirit
[1:04:38] my lord jesus hallelujah and that is
[1:04:41] contrary to god's word
[1:04:44] you're not born again by baptism you're
[1:04:47] born again by repentance
[1:04:50] and faith in the substitute shed
[1:04:54] blood of jesus christ for the remission
[1:04:57] of our sins
[1:04:58] amen hallelujah there's no wonder people
[1:05:01] are mixed up today friends
[1:05:03] they're mixed up they were mix-up back
[1:05:05] then and that was only
[1:05:07] shortly after pentecost they got mixed
[1:05:10] up by that
[1:05:10] babylon mystery babylon and the
[1:05:12] babylonian pagan
[1:05:14] teachings back there and now here we are

[1:05:20] past that time away from the original
[1:05:24] truth
