for this great uh happening that's taking place now the redeemed gathering in all those Souls that Daniel talked about when he looked and he said I saw shrones and crowns being cast down from the heavens amen praise God and God has let us be here as Kings and Priests to him for his glory and praise and honor and I trust that the holy spirit will bless us tonight as we look into the word amen Genesis 1 11 and we want to talk about uh we're in the headstone we're in The Headstone what a time what a season that we're in Praise the Lord being in The Headstone I believe a brother uh Danny will kind of update you on the funeral arrangements so that as many of us as can be there would be there I know it's in the middle of the week and people are working but if you can we'd love to have you there so the church has some representation and they have comfort uh surrounding them okay praise the name of the Lord um I know um sister Simon will not be there because suddenly her niece young woman passed away so she's just rushing on Friday which is her birthday but she has to leave and go to that funeral for that niece of hers up there these things just happen What can you do so we give God the glory and praise that we are here we're still alive we're strong we're healthy and we are just worshiping the Lord is that right praise the Lord amen as I sat in there I'm just talking a little as I sat in there I was just thinking about people's conception and that's the church that we were fed and we were taught that and that's what we believed that the church is um you know these painted buildings and beautiful structures and enormous crowds and uh stuff like that and Paul said no it's the spirit of just men made perfect that are gathering together because they're drawn by something unseen right and that's why we're looking to as the prophet said we are looking to the Unseen amen praise the Lord praise God but you know what it is once you're you've caught the Holy Spirit you start talking about the word you're breaking to Eternity and you can keep talking and that was because you want to talk but the word will will start coming as the ever-present water from the rock just flowing to bless and refresh and strengthen every heart and every life that's there praise God so we thank God for this privilege indeed we are not finished with the Little Acorn we have here praise God Genesis 1 11 if you notice I've been uh brother Branham was there for a month or two or whatever preaching on job in the ash pile it he said I don't know when I'm gonna get him off that Ash pile but here we are sitting on this scripture of Genesis 1 11. amen and God said let the Earth bring forth grass and the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is already in itself right up on the Earth and it was so praise God hallelujah father we thank you for the ring of the word now may the great Holy Spirit who who is the word and wrote the word interpret the word and bless our hearts together in the name of Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord because God bless you please be seated we are not gathered for a religious exercise we're not gathered out of Duty we are not gathered here in any way by tradition but we are gathered here because we are drawn by the Holy Spirit amen uh listen to uh the great sermon of God and always remember when you hear Oh Brother Branham said this yes brother Branham is talking yeah he is the spokesman but who is back of that uh the voice behind The Voice the great Holy Spirit taking um as he said in uh looking to the Unseen when he said this is not William Branham speaking this little billion Branham has only loaned me his voice amen his only loan means faculties and things like that amen hallelujah so let's look to the word listen what he says here one night he was praying late he said on the spirit said pick up your pen and write and he picked up the pen and began to write he said and I have to leave I had to leave some of it Go amen but here I want to bring some of it to you right now he begins now here is what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction brings forth after its kind see we have the interpretation every seed after its kinds it's already there it's a law that God placed in his creation a law of reproduction that every seed will bring forth after its kind not after some other kind no matter how admirable how beautiful you know he didn't say to bring forth that kind bring forth after your kind the kind that you are the in these last days therefore the true church the Bride Comes to the half Stone amen when Jesus comes to The Headstone he doesn't know means that she just comes and meets The Headstone but she Through the Ages the church has been growing and now at this time when the last age is over she comes to that place and time and season when she enters into the headstone she enters the king's chamber uh and take that and think on him but she's come to that place where she is beginning to be sealed in right and I'm thinking of the astronauts not going to be going up to the Moon they don't just send up the rocket like that they've got to seal them in into a cabin where they're pressurized praise God brother Branham said a lot of them are not going to make it because they're not pressurized for the journey amen and you see that's why God tests us and tries us and puts us in the fire takes us out Hammer us a little bit put us back in the fire Hammer you again right because what he's refining you is pressurizing you amen for the journey so that the pressure you feel here is nothing when you pass through the upper atmospheres amen uh literally speaking praise God he said that's the that's the that's what's being an eagle he says them other words will try to follow an eagle up there see but they can only go far and then their feathers start falling off they bust up they they can't take it but they Eagle is just resting easy and he is just soaring on the Wind amen the holy spirit is not his enemy the Holy Spirit just takes him along Hallelujah Prophet said why because he is pressurized to be up there amen his pressure rise to be there praise God and I'm so glad we are pressurized to be here through many dangers toils and snares it's not just a song but we know what we're singing and what we're talking about through many dangers trials and snares we have already come and you know it and I know it not by my works but Grace is what brought us safe not far and as grace alone that will take you home you're not going by your Works you're not going by anybody telling you you're saved or telling you you're a bride or telling you you're born again but when the Holy Spirit strikes your heart and you recognize something in you has changed you know who you are and what you raise up for praise be to God hallelujah you see that church comes to The Headstone that bride will be the Super Church oh my when you think of Superman you think of a man with muscles looks Mighty and you come to the real super Church this looks like nothing is that right brother Brandon said look how they're thinking this they are thinking that Samson was a big muscle guided wrestled with the lion put his hands on those posts and he says now if it was like that it wouldn't look that Supernatural to the people right he says but he was a little guy right just like Jesus was just a little guy but here's a little guy he's not supposed to maybe even beat a wolf much less to come up with a lion and here the spirit of God Came Upon him and the Bible said he tore that lion to apart amen destroyed it and anybody would realize no man can do that it's got to be God amen it's got to be God did that Hallelujah so that's the same principle I'm talking about when it comes to the end the little flock the little group and I don't mean just this group what we are experiencing no doubt somewhere in the world somebody a person or persons elsewhere not just caught brother branham's message but uh they've caught the Revelation the internal part of that message and they're locked in the pyramid they're locked into that wonderful place in The Headstone praise God there's no nothing else but the word whether Brandon said that the veil shut behind them they brought through the sun barrier they can't hear sounds from outside no screaming calling no noise nothing else because what the veil shuts it out the word shuts it all out amen praise God he says look they may look up and all they can see the clouds spicing and everything else the weather and everything else but when they get into that holy of holies when they get in that headstone everything around them is shutting with God amen hallelujah oh but they don't look different they don't behave different there's nothing different you see it's not the man outside that changes this is the person inside it's that man begins to recognize who he really is and when he comes through with all his faults failures and stumblings he knows what is going on it's a battle being fought all the time between the Flesh and the spirit that's changed on the inside amen but thank God listen just that that super Church a super race as they near The Headstone praise God now he was talking back there about them coming up to this that we have now that they were coming nearing to that that stone but I'm saying to you who have caught the Revelation that we are now in the headstone we are waiting amen for the total liftoff to go out of here by the grace of God hallelujah amen see near the headstone so there will be so much like him there will be in his very image praise God now it's not me or you going out and trying physically now to start appearing like another Jesus you understand another priest that's so sanctimonious no that's not what it is once he's telling you that once you have wrecked a nice that the gene is is in you praise God God's Eternal assurance that you are going to be in the Rapture is already in you so so so therefore you are in His image amen praise God I I have certain the ways like my old daddy and you can't help it you look certain things certain ways and certain actions like you're all that you are your mother amen you you just born that way you can't help that so that's what he's saying as they near to that time of The Headstone which and I'm telling you we have entered into this headstone then he said there will be at that time which is this time there will be in his very image that will be in the gym there will be in the scene because that's what's going to be manifested through them that's what's going to be pushing and manifesting and displaying itself through them Hallelujah so there will be so much like him in order to be United with him in other words you got to recognize of the word Gene being in you before you can see the other part of the Revelation that tells you you are a part of the whole world that's there and those two United amen and once they're United and they're moving use of words in harmony they can then say I and my father are one [Music] I and my father are one you see they will then be the very manifestations of the word of the Living God none of the Dead God but the god that's living now in you and me they are going to be the manifestations of the of the word of the Living God hallelujah praise God Amen so we sit here simply an ordinary but you are the manifestation of the prophets prophecies you're the manifestation of the prophet's word who do you think he was talking about you know you see when Jesus talked back there and said in that day they will know and what do you think he's talking about the prophet said this day right now you are the people this is the place Hallelujah and the word of God is on the scene according to God's program amen hallelujah and you see now oh my now he goes right and says now you see them denominations can never produce that they can't they gotta have the germ the gene they got to be predestinated or whatever before they can even start or even think of that but he said them denominations can never produce this already we see they're the spirit of contest God and Satan and all that right in that little uh thing there you see because all they can produce is their creeds and their dogmas mixed with the work and that only brings forth a hybrid product that's simple isn't that oh my every seed remember the principle remember the guideline God's word every seed must he didn't say me could be or maybe every seed will bring forth after its kind and we are after God's kind because we are who here brought forth by the opening of his word hallelujah now praise the Lord see so oh thank God for that so notice carefully here that they are the very manifestation of the living word amen I have a little note that I wrote here so there are the manifestations of the word or in other words fruits of the Tree of Life now amen free of life in the garden Prophet said that was Jesus the word uh what do you think the Tree of Life Is Here is the same thing it's Jesus Christ the word and we are fruits of that word and um the fruits on a tree tells you what kind of tree it is the fruits is a manifestation of the tree and the nature of the tree character of the tree whatever it is it tells you what kind of tree that is and we are fruits of that word of the tree of life amen praise be to God hallelujah now that first spoken word son speaking of Adam now the first son was a spoken word seed of God and he was given a bride amen a bride was given for him to reproduce himself amen but she fell she fell that bride fell by High breathing and caused him to die now the Second Son whom we know second Adam is Jesus Christ right A Spoken Word seed Son of God amen was given a bride like Adam but before he could marry her she had fallen also because she was put on free moral agency to believe God's word and live or doubt it and die amen she was put on free moral agency praise the name of the Lord hallelujah now let's leave that alone amen praise the Lord amen now one son Adam second son he mentions Jesus Christ then he says and now from a little group of that true seed of the word hallelujah now he's talking about the third uh manifestation of the sonship but now he says that manifestation of sonship will be a little group in other words he's talking about the bride here right it's moved from the one God represented it in the one man Jesus Christ Emmanuel now represented in the bright form Hallelujah in a little group praise God hallelujah amen that little group of the true seed of the word god from them that God will present Christ a beloved virgin bride a virgin of his word amen Virgin of his word glory to God hallelujah I just have to keep going straight ahead because you take that and you're gone off there because you can see clearly what he's saying because of the the gene in within you and the seed of God not commit sin you know that person is a virgin to God by the very word that is in them is that right she's the virgin of the word praise God he doesn't pay any attention to anything else that's just Satan's manifestations of this and that and distractions God wouldn't pay attention to that he looks at what his word is doing and they're justifying amen praise the Lord God hallelujah amen I'm so glad God has spoken word back then he had spoken word son Adam spoken word son Jesus now he has spoken words sons and daughters is that right praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen oh praise God now through them will be fulfilled all that has been promised for his word in that version Hallelujah he promised Jesus would come and the manifestation took place through the virgin amen praise God he's not saying the Virgin is going to do it but he caused the manifestation to come true the virgin she was there on site on scene ready to be used of God hallelujah so that she could manifest the word Hallelujah see oh my and so that virgin knows no man-made Creeds nor not dogmas The Word of Promise in himself like it was in Mary God made himself manifest through that amen so that uh Gene in the virgin of this hour God makes himself manifested through that hallelujah it's God displaying himself for this age through that for his glory We're Not Looking Back at what a used to happen back there that's good and we need to read it and it needs to help us in every way but we want to manifest the word for this day the premises for this age hallelujah praise God now I can we can go down there less than that would be on another whole sermon of what is to be fulfilled and what is to be made known in this day and this hour through the bride for this day praise the name of the Lord amen praise God God himself making himself manifest you see you he then will act himself is not what I was trying to tell you before I didn't read this before I'm not uh you know it's only this today that I went over this and went through it when he said no in other words you don't run trying to do this or that he will act himself he will act himself see praise God Hallelujah by his own Word of Promise he will act so to fulfill all that has been written about him just like he did with the disciples back there from Moses and the prophets the Bible says he took all them scriptures and then began to unfold them and unfold them like that praise the Lord he's doing the same thing remember brother Branham says they don't recognize it but history repeats itself you believe that I'm just gonna come down and talk natural I was so impressed last night when I heard uh one of the reporters on CNN saying oh uh president uh uh President Biden is one of is not one he is the greatest president and he's still in office uh Roosevelt is dead and all those things that he brought in and how it was a woman the first woman ever to be the person that should enact these things that brought in all these things the Social Security Medicaid things that are now like the basis of the United States some of the greatest laws and Provisions and stuff like that and now Biden has done uh the same thing and now ready to go ahead of that with what he's doing and it hasn't been done like that for hundreds of years and he said and then this is what caught my things so but I don't understand it I don't know what this is but I I I I saw look when I was looking the background of this lady and I looked at the background of the present person rather Biden the president has in the same position that they were born in the same city they were born in the same debt in the same month they were born and he said I I don't understand this kind of thing I don't know what it is but he is doing the same things that she was doing and and doing it more in this hour that's what I'm referring to that history repeats itself and Jesus all these things were manifesting Jesus they were manifesting all these prophets and now the r has come when they will be made manifest in the bride yes not the bride going on like I usually use the word working herself but trying to bring on some no no no but he himself will act through his what his word to fulfill his own work through the brain through the Virgin praise God for this hour glory to God hallelujah amen you see and he then when he come from the Virgin womb which today we see type of the spirit womb the word in that Spirit womb amen see yes sir so will the Virgin now accepting his word by saying be it unto me according to Thy Word but notice though it was an angel that spoke to her amen God who's an angel he's saying here to speak to her but he's turning around and saying but it wasn't the word of the angel it wasn't the Angel's word though he was the speaker or the voice right it wasn't his word it was God's word hallelujah amen she believed the angel you see because what he spoke was the written word was the word already Isaiah 9 6 or Amen in other words the angel didn't have to go quoting all of that he just tell her what he has to tell her according to the word of the Living God hallelujah amen hallelujah saw these now will love him and they will have his potentials thanks be to God Amen you got that none of us can have all of him but we're going to have potentials they're going to be little Messiah ants they're going to be little saviors little anointed ones with the spirit of God in them little licks of flame and fire that's coming together in the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen praise God and they will love him and will have his potentials for he is their head and they are his subjects and subjects how by being subject to his head amen are you surrendered to the leadership or headship of Jesus Christ amen praise be to God hallelujah oh my now your Harmony of Jesus and the father is showing that back there that's the same Harmony it's going to come back and be here between the bride and Jesus Christ the holy spirit amen did she ever have that same kind of Harmony because she will never disagree with the word she will not act against the word hallelujah and she he said he'll do nothing unless the father showed him first Hallelujah that was the harmony between God and Christ but now the so will the bride Hallelujah for he will show her his word of life and then she knows how to what to do and how to act amen praise God and she receives that word and never doubts it praise the Lord and when that happens nothing can harm her not even death not even death can harm her he's not talking about physical death that can't harm you either but it can separate you from your physical body that's all that's doing but uh Paul said that's not a problem because they separate you from your body absent from this body I'm present with the Lord so so so Satan thinks he's doing this or doing that you're present with the Lord amen now remember nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again praise God no matter where that seed is planted whatever heart is planted in and look we have all kinds of preachers and Believers following this message but it's a very minuscule group few and right when I said that the the devil is talking talking to me and I'm going to tell you now what he's saying he's saying are you just saying that to justify yourself no no but that's how the devil works right but you're looking at the truth or the word of God here right fear not little flock it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom praise the Lord listen though now here is the secret the word is already in the bride the word is in the bride amen now and the mind of Christ then she knows what he wants done what to do with the word because it's already in her glory be to God you see your understanding this differently than if I was preaching somewhere even in the message Church um are you going to get the mind of Christ from somewhere all of a sudden you're going to get the mind of Christ not realizing that the mind of Christ is already in you and then that will start talking to you that will begin showing you uh what next to be done and I don't even hear some Supernatural boys talking you know that's how the devil gets people thinking like that when when when he comes just simply and softly well why don't you turn around go through this road why don't you pick up that thing and you know how many simple things right I go into a store I see something and I get the thought about buying it or taking that and I said no I'll come back the next time I walk away from it and then the thought hit me again by time I go back somebody's gone with that thing right as simple as that look that sounds like nothing but let me tell you right down to the smallest thing I'm watching for the Holy Spirit at all times amen see so the mind she has the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name that sounds simple but she's not doing it to glorify herself she's not doing it to be seen or recognized known no uh she's doing it in his name that his name received the glory that he be lifted up that he be receive all praise and honor and Glory that is why she's doing everything in his name praise God wonderful what Authority also praise God because she's telling the devil you must recognize who I am I am Mrs Jesus I'm telling you this you've got to do it and my husband is back here he's going to enforce the word restoration of the Bright Tree the prophet says that plainly he says that the Holy Spirit The Enforcer is right here to enforce the word of the Living God if you believe it and you believe who you are and what you are raised up for Hallelujah God is here in you ready to enforce his own word the bright tree has been restored the fruits are now on the tree the manifestation and the display of life being in the tree is now being made known praise God hallelujah amen yes sir for all you see with that she has thus said the Lord oh praise God doesn't mean brother Bill you suddenly get super spiritual and you walk over to brother Glenn say brother Glenn just see it the Lord that's not what he's talking about amen she has that in her she don't have to say you said the Lord because she has that in her and when God speaks out of her whether she is conscious or unconscious of what's happening it's God's speaking to some person persons and that just upset the Lord because he's using them and speaking out to them sometimes you're conscious sometimes you're not conscious you're not aware of it and sometimes somebody will come back and say remember when you told me this you told me that you said so and so and boy I went by that and that really helped me when did you when did I say that you know praise God somebody can say oh you're forgetful you can't even remember that right well that's not the point because I might not have been the one that said that you might not have been the one that said that praise God it's just God spoke through his vessel for his glory and for his honor amen see it is germanized the thing has come to life but now the water has come on the seed and the seed has come to life it's germanized it's start to manifest and him hand he saw the Holy Spirit Waters it until it is grown and serves its purpose Hallelujah the spirit of God so I have the seed you have the seed everybody you have the seed who believes they have it then the spirit of God constantly Waters that which is what I believe he's doing right now what is that seed and the prophet says he's watering it so that it can grow and come to its maturity and fulfill its purpose for what God sent it here for until it has grown and serves its purpose praise the Lord see and doing that they will do only his will only his will amen no one can persuade them to do anything different Hallelujah they know they have to have just seek the Lord or they will sit still they don't care what anybody says oh you don't know that you're supposed to know that how long have you been a message brother Glenn you know paragraph 64 1964 what's that oh I don't know you see they look on that as a failure you look on that you've been so long in the message and you don't you even forgetting certain Bible texts my yet you claim you're a Christian and a believer of this message oh my they're not realize that you have laid everything down you read the word you read the message you listen to it but you letting the Holy Spirit use it not me using it against you and you or trying to answer you or trying to prove that no no no no no no everything has come right down amen the pot has simmered down you know my wife was fixing something before I came out said oh my these vegetables have filled up the spot I said yeah now but wait a little later it's going to Stew right down and you're going to be surprised how small it's going to become well it's the same thing the whole thing the whole shirt the whole bride the whole message the whole thing is coming down amen it's not going up and if anybody tells you different they're wrong that's not the word hallelujah it's coming right on down listen uh I don't go out for nothing but give you something the prophet said look they're going to go on preaching they're going to be winning Souls they're going to be bringing people into the world and we're bringing people to know Jesus and everything else he said it'll all be going on and the bride will just slip out he'll steal her out of here and she's gone in a moment praise God I'm gonna wine begin to wind this up praise the Lord hallelujah see they have thus set the Lord or they keep still Hallelujah right and then they will do the works of God for it is himself in them now continuing his word to fulfill all that he did not complete in his days when he was here right all things all things that he did not complete all when he was here for it that was not to be at that time yet so he did not complete it but she Hallelujah is here now and he is going to complete the work that he had to do but he's going to do it through her so that she could be a fellow laborer together with him that she could manifest that she's a help meet amen she's a helper praise God hallelujah she's one with him praise the Lord I'm so glad that I'm one of them thanks be to God I'm glad that I can say that I am one of them and that we are within the headstone praise the Lord I pray God bless these uh thoughts to your heart amen and don't accept them or take them as figments of my imagination or something of that nature but look back at the word even while I'm talking even while I'm talking look back at the word and you will know for yourself whether these things are true I believe they are true I believe it's the word of God you receive it in Jesus name for his glory the Lord bless you praise the Lord
