the Lord speak unto Phil saying arise and go towards the South onto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza which is Desert and he arose and went and behold a man of Ethiopian Enoch of a great Authority Under condensed Queen of the Ethiopians Queen of the Ethiopians who had the who who had the charge of all hair treasure and had come to Jerusalem for to worship was returning and setting in The Chariot read Isaias the prophet then the spirit said unto Faith go now and join thyself to his chariot and Feb ran theater to him and heard him read Prophet is us and said understand it down down what thou realest and he said how can I how can I accept someone should guide me and he desire faith that he would come and sit with him the praise of the scripture which he read was this he was led as a sheep through the slaughter and a line and a like a lamb done before his Shearer so so open it he not his mouth in his humiliation his judgment was taken away and who shall declare his generation for his life is taken from the Earth and the end of answered failed and said I pray thee of whom speaketh the Prophet this of himself or someone some other man then film open his mouth and began at the same scripture and preach unto him Jesus and as they went on their way they came onto a certain water and the indoch said see here is water what do hinder mean to be baptized and Philip said if thou believeth which all thy heart with all thy heart thy mess and he answered and said I believe that Jesus is the son of God and he commanded the Chariot to stand still and they went down both into the water will fail and inner and he baptize him and when they will come up out of the water the spirit of the door cut away Fair that the Enochs saw him no more and he went on his way rejoicing my faith was found at azitors and passing through preaching in all the city till he came to caesarea may the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of his word we babysitter Hallelujah what a blessing when Philip does the job what happened as soon as he finished the job the Bible said he caught up he didn't see him no more one day the people maybe there are people watching over us and one day they will find these doors no open where are these people they caught up to meet the Lord what a blessing the Lord put this word here so that we can build our faith on the word of God he caught up he was there and he was not the same thing he did to work Enoch and that's the same thing we are waiting for the people may be waiting every time you see our neighbors they're looking at us coming down the cars are here open the door singing these people are happiest people they always come out the door rejoicing what is going on and when did we waiting well today where are these cars what happened what she did it's Sunday but what I think they caught up Hallelujah Glory this word alone is good enough for us if you remember Philip was a person like me and you was no different person the same Philip was like you and me going up and down sleeping Hallelujah I'm getting ahead of myself because it's so sweet Hallelujah that's why I'm happy when I speak about the word of God or when I read and God gave me understanding it becomes like a lightning unto me it doesn't matter where I am sometimes when I'm working somebody may think somebody is something happened to me he's right there ice cream Hallelujah I scream so high and sometimes I'm listening to brother Abraham the thing hit me like a rock I jump Hallelujah that's the happiest happiest woman when God puts something in your heart and no words can explain that Hallelujah I cannot tell you how are this man is rejoicing but inside of me there's something going on Hallelujah glory to God amen the word is so sweet thank you Lord my topic tonight is can the Lord Jesus Christ use me yes he can that's my topic can the Lord Jesus Christ use me yes he can he use you yes he can Hallelujah we all know that God chose us before the foundation of the word as we always say brother Simon always said the preachers always say if God by his infinite wisdom chose you to be his son or daughter that means there is a work for each and everyone to do nobody can sit here without doing nothing you do you think Moses knew know that God gonna use him the way he used him he did not know Abraham didn't know this by the grace of God the same Grace he called you and me it's not what we have done not that we are special people we're talking about faith faith was not a special person when you talk about Peter he wasn't a special person the Bible said they were unlearning they don't know nothing sometimes even if you put his name to write down he can hear he can talk but he cannot write but God doesn't look that he look here what he has chose before the foundation of this world Hallelujah if God chose you before the foundation of this world he has a work for you to do Oh Glory to God the only thing you have to do you have to be serious you have to be ready so that when he is ready to use you you are available glory to God you think people that they know the Bible said he was sleeping and the angel of the Lord came to him he said wake up boy there's a way for you to do I have an assignment for you to do tonight Hallelujah I believe you know what let me when God called Philip was not selfish let's read something here hmm Hallelujah The Book of John chapter 1 verse 43-51 the day following Jesus would go forth on into Galilee and find itself and said unto him follow me now Faith was Bethesda the city of Andrew and Peter Faith funded Nathaniel and said unto him we have found him and then he said who thank you who are you fine who okay of whom Moses in the law and the prophet did right Jesus of Nazareth the son of Joseph and Nathaniel said unto him come on boy what do you think about can there any good thing come out from Nazareth come and see by yourself Hallelujah you know when God God called Philip rather where he began to work he didn't waste time he goes he got something special that nobody could ever give it to him only God can give you to him have you found something special tonight in your heart that you you don't want to reveal that into nobody there's a lot of people out there want to hear this I don't challenge you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ do your work and let the word of God work through your life God is real God is not just talking about him just like that the Bible said when you talk about him he drawn here glory to God there's no other time you ever had you ever talk about Jesus Christ that he was not there he's always there because his name is very important to him Hallelujah his name is above every name you don't just Mercy in the Lord Jesus Christ name just like that because he is special whether whether you're a Jew you are a Muslim your Hindu with your Buddhas anything happen to you the first name you must Jesus whether you like it or not brother

God has given to us it's a special than even more important than the food that is on your table Hallelujah you go to work every day day in day and night you you you sometimes you sick who I have to go

oh God loves me God yes he loves you what about you do you really love him from the bottom of your heart or part of your heart ask yourself brother this is not a joke this is real we have reached so far thank God for our pastor he took us when we were small the same way the Lord Jesus Christ took fruit and the other disciples and nourish them till they reach the accountability that he can send them out to do the work that's what our pastor did Hallelujah so each and everywhere nobody has excuse to say oh this and that no it's you it's time for us to wake up it's time for us to strengthen it's going home time Hallelujah FIB caught up he said when were you talking about the Rapture Rapture it's not just a word it's reality it's reality we sell here we read it when Ethiopian you know turn his eye like this Philip was not there is gone there was no praying there there was no helicopter there there is no car there well I feel how did he transport God took him so God will take you Hallelujah dancing is real our Prophet Tata but Abraham taught us that is real he showed to us that's real he got caught up in heaven and came back so nobody have no excuse that this is not going to happen it's going to happen to us Hallelujah what do you think the brothers are preaching the raptured phrase we think they're just talking this is real God is preparing us through them hear the word of God Hallelujah don't look them understand here they're speaking but look what behind him look beyond the Canon of time Hallelujah otherwise you miss something the train is already the engine is warm already Hallelujah oh that Lifeboat is ready Hallelujah glory to God I am happy happy as happy can be amen hallelujah he just took him to do the job can God take you to do the job Hallelujah are you ready to do the job Hallelujah hear me not every time Brothers I'm not gonna tell you you go here you go God can speak to you God speak like we are speaking if you hear if you open your ear until your ear to the voice of God he is speak to you because I had to and the thing was real it's not a joke so nothing can move me from this gospel nothing whatsoever no sickness nothing no hell can take me out until after I finish the work of God in my life so do you God has a job for you to do Hallelujah all what you have to do is to be ready ready before the time the light boat is waiting glory to God Amen when God wants to do something he doesn't need your opinion God doesn't need your opinion oh what are you ready or not when he said you go you go you know when you listen to the message of Abraham sometime God tells him to do something and the people around him sometimes persuade him to do something and he suffer consequence so when God tells you do something please Brethren this is real don't reason just do it and God will bless you he is preparing us for something special that the world never see before Hallelujah don't you know that it's gonna reach a time when things happening you're gonna call the same way you feel that the prophet there was no food and you call under the food will be there can God do that there is nothing is impossible to God Hallelujah you remember Abraham was brother Simon was preaching one time in the United States and the woman he lost the husband with drinking left the children home and the woman came to the altar and the brother pray for that woman and in in the middle of the praise I gave you your husband by tomorrow you're going to be here 15 plus I'm always breaking he spoke the word of God that he did already and the rest of the work is God you have to speak the word of God and let God do the work will happen I'm telling you it will happen thank you Jesus when we talk about faith maybe I'm gonna read a little thing here our teams Hallelujah James 2 26. for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also you can say you have faith Faith you can have I have faith without using the faith the words How You Gonna how are you gonna manifest manifest the faith you gotta you gotta use the work do the world use the phrase to work though that you can see the manifestation of the faith Hallelujah can you pray for somebody I'm believing that God gonna ask that gonna gonna heal that person all gonna bring bring that person in the presence of God or you yourself can you have enough Faith to pray that something that you are lacking and you need it and believing that instead because remember everything is there not because your eye cannot see is there your faith has to bring in reality that's the way the gospel work everything is there God has already prepared and the Lord Jesus Christ demonstrated to us and the prophet of God William Brown has demonstrated to us so we have no excuse Hallelujah God is working 24 hours every day every minute every second he's waiting for you Hallelujah do you have enough faith to call him on the scene on your life something that you're looking for since you believe this message and you've been sitting here day in day out and the ministers that are talking about talking about have you seen one time in your lifetime you asking your heart did I ever see God in fresh in my life one time ask yourself did you see him he is real God talk God speak God can come and stand in front of you anything that he wants he can do it you have to call him on the same to do the work because when the wind is blowing you cannot see the wind or what you can see the the leaves and everything moving moving so that wind is blowing so if you want to see the god let him come and do something in your life one time and that thing you know you know they have drinks in the stores they say boost they say boost boost or something that they drink and they can energy drink energy drink something later that will give you Energizer they have a battle that Energizer and they make a turn and go like this you put a battery inside and you go like this why don't you have God in your life because Hallelujah Glory Glory Hallelujah Glory Glory Hallelujah Glory Glory Hallelujah is through is my channel you are I have seen the glory of God in what time Hallelujah that's where you can stand when Liars can be stopped you can raise up your hand without fear and the lion gonna know that you are God people you are a servant of God we here so we had so many stories do you think those stories are just stories it's reality I see some I know that these brothers have seen all the time brother someone talks to us about all the time when you read brother Abraham the same thing you see all the time so this is not a myth this is reality the gospel is real Hallelujah God has quoted so many years we've been so faithful to be in his presence all the time then whether sunshine or Reign you see you think God doesn't see that he see you all the time oh what you have to do is you shake yourself Bradley let us Shake ourselves and let the reality come imprave you in our life as I said it would it will give us energy it will make it it will rise up your faith more so that when you go you can speak someone said all the time you pray for Wednesday he said if you pray you pray you pray one day you're gonna find yourself praying for somebody and something great happen because your prayers you can do nothing it's God does the work of the prayer so all what you have to do surrender unpaid Yourself clean yourself make yourself ready make yourself worthy for the gospel if you if you do what you're supposed to do the rest God will do it by himself Hallelujah you don't have to do nothing if you not get yourself ready in the church and some some of the Brethren good against themselves ready in the church do you believe and always practicing their faith believing out of setting goals that are using that person and then you sit down on the pew and every day the person will come and say God is God is God because of your lack of faith and the work that you are not doing right same time you create a room for yourself to save time to come in and then you're gonna fill it in with what jealousy because you create a vacuum there and Satan that's why Satan was and then when the brother or the sister comes and give testimony oh look what he's doing well every time no because you are not doing the work and then since then you allow Satan to come then to criticize what God is using the other person this is real because we are in the move now God is in the move because every time the plane have to take off he has to warmed the Aging very hard so with a few distance he has to take off so God is warming the church the Rapture the Rapture is about to take off so he has to take off with the pressure Hallelujah you have to crystallize to yourself the astronaut they have to go to pressure pressure room so that they can they can absorb the atmosphere then when they're going in there if you are not personalized your skin gonna be this this I don't know I don't know that's English this is gonna burst huh yeah that were there and thank you brother see that's why my English is a little bit you know but I thank God for that amen because I have brothers here if I don't know they will tell they tell you Hallelujah thank you Jesus so we are going through that so my brother I am very very happy to tell you we have to live by the word of God amen Hallelujah you have to begin to set your heart and see if your heart is right with God otherwise you cannot work with God at halfway Philip was ready anytime Philip was ready anytime and God won people who are ready to do the work Hallelujah God doesn't want lukewarm no because I see Brian Simon when when we go to Fellowship he always won his food heart Hallelujah if the food is a little bit warm put in the microwave that's where you can enjoy the food God one heart in your heart in your mind give me Robert Jones I will rip him off Hallelujah and that God will back you up give me this one give me this mountain I am old but I still can take it that's what God wants Hallelujah there's no there is no age in the God kingdom no age young or old Hallelujah thank you thank you Lord you are mysterious God God is a mysterious God yes Hallelujah God can use every one of us yes he can whether you're a woman you're a man you're a boy you're a little girl can use you God chose brother Abraham he didn't know or what he know a voice spoke to him on the tree he didn't ask for that he was running away from it so God can use anybody when you want are you ready be ready brother in this is not a joke this is reality I am happy to be a Christian the Bible is a Christian never die but not this body there's another body that's beautiful than him now that's where we're gonna see each and everyone with a sparkling eye are we gonna talk to Abraham there's no age no time to talk to Abraham you can see that how much you want Isaiah you read Isaiah Hallelujah you read me a mayor you read over there you read this one you read we're gonna see all of them there and there's no time to have fellowship with them brother Mike I know you have Fellowship you're gonna have fellowship with mercies as much as you want Hallelujah thank you Jesus what something God has given to us there's no word can explain this thing that we are talking about you have no words it's a paradox that we're sitting here and we said we're not gonna die when you talk like that outside somebody will hit your hand with a broom Hallelujah thank you Jesus that is a paradise and it's real you think we just come here and talk and talk and go this is real because we saw it Philip Peter Thomas remember when the Lord Jesus Christ woke up after the resolution he came to the room and the people didn't believe him he saw Thomas come on you don't you've done all the things that I told you you don't believe all the healing everything that I did until unless you see it come and see he gave him opportunity come and feel it if you don't beat it cannot feel it then he went really he went and finished this my my God this is real this is real the same thing we talking here is real it's not just how I cannot see don't it's just talking no it's not just a talk but someone or his lifetime his pen in the presence of God since the time when he was 14. if it's not real how can he stand there after today for the gospel because the gospel is real brethren let us join together and believing that everything that we hear here is real it's not just the words all the songs that we're seeking for the inspiration song it's real people Inspire and wrote them how do they get the songs there happiness songs and angels and this you think this is a myth this is reality Hallelujah thank you Lord I'm gonna read a little things for you here when brother Abraham let me tell you this world here it's true spirit one is against you and one is the one who's taking you to heaven it's real problem said you don't believe that he said I speak to the demon every day he said it's real they stand face to face and speak to me it's not like a fresh here he said you could see he's speaking to you my friend we are living in the world that your eye cannot see outside there if God could open your eyes to see it over there you run and sleep here every night Africa we see things real physically so when we when I came here God called me I know that's out there there's there's real here and there's real here and we are parting the barrel Hallelujah I read something from Abraham for you to see this is a early spiritual experience paragraph paragraph 50 paragraph nine is a 1952 0713a the little police that that I had just led to God went out there to grab the man the holy Brown was having a meeting
