message that he sent his greetings to every one of you think they will be they will be here by Sunday if the Lord will praise the Lord hallelujah we are happy to hear from him amen we miss him Hallelujah are you happy tonight amen if you are not happy I am happy because I have breath in my nonsense I can see you my brethren that we are journeyed together hallelujah thank you Lord we're gonna stick our scripture reading and the Saint Mark chapter 10 verses 46 to 52. Saint Mark chapter 10 verse 46 to 52. Hallelujah and they came to Jericho and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people blind Bartimaeus the son of tamils sucked by the way I highwayside begging and when he heard that it is was Jesus of Nazareth he began to cry out and say Jesus that son of David have mercy up on me and many charge him that he should hold his peace but he crowd out the more of a great deal the son of David have mercy on me and Jesus Stood Still and commanded him to be called and they call the blind man saying unto him be of good Comfort rise he called thee and he casting away His Garment Rose and came to Jesus and Jesus answered and said unto him what will doubt that I should do unto thee that's my topic tonight what would doubt that I should do unto thee the blind man said unto him Lord that I might receive my sight and Jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith had made thee whole and immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus in the way may the Lord add his Blessing unto the word of God he said what will doubt that I should do on today what can I help you what can I do for you tonight the Lord Jesus is asking how can he help you what can he do for you this man that was maybe was his last chance nothing could hold him back when he had that is time and we thank God this is our time we cry and God heard our cry and through Grace here we sitting from north south east and west Trinidad Africa Jamaica Canada Quebec everywhere here we sit in look at one another smiling one another no quarreling you know one thing I I thank God for this church we are more loving brothers and sisters We Are One no matter what circumstance comes Away We Are One we thank God for that Hallelujah you see this man he never see and he heard that voice and nothing couldn't hold him back and when they brought he cried so hard they want to pray suppress him but you couldn't Jesus heard I said bring him to me and when the Lord Jesus Christ brought him he didn't say go and make that he said what can I do for you you know Salvation God gave it to us it's a gift the gift of God is a gift of God but the Bible said ask and you shall receive ask is something that we have to take it serious remember when a child needs something what is does she do she cry he or her cry unto the mother the mother couldn't nothing can hold that child until you certified that child if he's hungry the only way he can get it it has to be desperate when you ask God this man was desperate desperation bring God's on the scene as the children of God God has given us everything look here I'm gonna explain how and Who We Are as children of God right now you know people can go to a a baseball or any celebrity singers wherever famous people and they would oppress this man no matter what the if there was a they want a what a signature that is an autograph or something and when these people get that thing they cherish some of them you know what they do they even frame that mind with the signature and put on the wall and worship that thing let me tell you if the weather people can do that what about me and you look here the Bible said the Lord Jesus said he has each and every one in the palm of his son how he does that he uses his own look tattoo you know the tattoo when they put a tattoo they use the person's blood to write whatever they need to draw or right there but look here how did the Lord have in Us in his son he used his own blood on the cross and engrave our name in his Primes remember you are the real celebrity that man could ever look remember we are God children and when God have you in in the palm of his son there is nothing that can take that that name are from his hand because it's in there who gonna take his name out nobody you are the real celebrities let me tell you when somebody comes to you and asks you to give autograph Hallelujah and that autograph is going to Heart of him we are in the Hall of Fame that the people will never imagine how we are we are something peculiar that the man cannot see but God looked to you as somebody that the words in this world here cannot explain do not underestimate yourself when something happened to you you have to recognize Who You Are when somebody comes to you or you go to somebody and you pray for that person you know that act that took praise that time is in the Hall of Fame one day during that judgment that person gonna see that he came to you and address him and you give your signature to that person Hallelujah what is your signature the words that come from your mouth is life how the Lord Jesus Christ engrave our names in his heart his life he gave his life so that he can put our name in his son Oh Glory To His holy name so Bradley let me tell you the Creator himself has you in the palm of his hand can you imagine you can create your own atmosphere around you that's why I said no Christians supposed to be sad there's no sadness in Christianity because Christianity is a joy remember when the trials and Temptation and trepidation comes it comes to strengthen you because our law went through that why for example Paul went through that for what an example job went through that for what an example so when something happened to you or anything happened to you don't stay in the corner and go to your shell and thinking you Hallelujah thank you Lord when the trial comes that's the time you're supposed to be happy because you are in the right side Satan will not try himself he always tried the opposite Hallelujah glory amen you are not just a believer but let me tell you there is no other way you gonna ask God something that you will not give your help you but sometimes we anticipate ourselves you need something you have to ask you say ask and you shall receive help come from who God my your help doesn't come from me God can be God can tell me or inspire me to do something it doesn't mean that I am the one doing it it's God he's reaching Mercy Inspire somebody to help you it's not that person is try to help you Hallelujah this man cries so hard but all that God asked him what can I do for you how can I help you you know there's so many scriptures about help you can get you can get this to Matthew Hebrew Matthew 15 25 Hebrew 4 16 Corinthians 1 24 Philippians 4 4 13 John 14 12. and Psalms 1 24 8 he said our our help is in the Lord our help is in the Lord Isaiah to whom were you free for help who we're gonna free for help God you got to go to God for help you have to ask him John 14 40 said ask and I will do it I will do it you want me to read I'm gonna read for you Hallelujah thank you Lord blessed be the name of the Lord our lord is good amen he said John 14 14 if you shall ask anything you didn't put in it any any Grudge is nothing there he said what he said anything in my name I will do it I will do it so why we have to be why we have to be sad the god that dwell in you said anything that you ask we as brother Christopher we are his wife can you let down your wife if you love your wife we are human we can make mistakes but God does not make mistake God take a virgin he took a virgin wife a virgin wife is real that's why he said why unto anybody who touched my this little one why because we are so important we are all famous we are the heart of farmers no no baseball no basketball what is that all of them going to die you will not die Hallelujah you are going there God gonna display you Hallelujah you are hard or famous you are God children so your name he used his own blood to engrave his own eyes that's he said nobody can take you out from his hand you are peculiar people Christian if you want to be a Christian be the best Christian there is no in between Hallelujah if God call you let me tell you someplace here let me see if I can find Hallelujah thank you Lord blessed be the name the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah looked at 132. oh does it look s I think I'm I'm busy that the Bible said he told Peter well you know how long Peter was with the Lord Jesus Christ he was with him for a long time but one day when something happened and then the Lord Jesus Christ turned around said Peter where you converted he was could you imagine he was telling Peter when Peter converted and he was with him he sent him out to cast demons and everything but I was still not converted you know we are going home you can sit on the pill I hear the sermon every day every day every day every day but you don't open your heart to Res let the sermon go inside there and you know when I was going to Africa I have to have a ticket if I don't have a ticket that brought straight down to Africa and I go to the plane to the counter I cannot go in you have to have that ticket God brought you here for giving you a promise you engrave in the hand you can sit on the pill without doing nothing growing yourself day in day out you can sit down here without growing Peter was there but he was not converted he was in the church but was not converted you can be baptized but you need the infilling of the Holy Ghost and that's your earnest hope that you take it to heaven that's a very very very important in our life God has given to you when I put it because now we are not children Paul said there's time for milk there's time for meat the minister Minister he cannot shovel that thing in your soul you have to swallow it and astute you go home you sit down meditate the word of God that's your growth that's where you can know a time to ask and when you ask you know the way you have to ask so that you can receive it this man when you ask the Lord Jesus Christ called him and he asked him what can I do for you said that I might receive my sight immediately what happened he received his sight whether you are sick the Holy Ghost is very very crucial in your Christian work don't play with it everybody is taking in right now we are going everybody is taking in everybody's taking in Everybody Take it in everybody take it you're gonna reach a Time whatever you're taking you're gonna bring back that's where you go you're gonna know when God speak you can hear when God speak to me I have a way to hear you you have to have a way to hear how are you going to hear the voice of God by tuning your ears into his word that is feeding you so this is very very very important we can say we are Christians so we're gonna sit on the pill every day without doing nothing we come down the little one while I'm speaking now you can hear but as soon as you go outside here it's gone right even one word in the inside there will motivate you a time when you need you have to store the food you know the ant the window is coming they have a lot of food already installed in their chamber for their

this is Brian back to me as 1955 in Germany so one night they said to his little girl this is talking about he said he had it you read it got sick and he went out and prayed he said God if you let my little girl live tomorrow I will offer you my doves so his little girl got better he offered his dove then he had nothing to he had nothing to attract the attention not long after that he got his wife got sick and in these days a blind man is led by a dog in this day the Blind Man Lies by dog but you know what I mean how how the dog lets the brown man in them in them days a lamb leads the blind and this brand was led by a lamb and he said Lord if you would let my wife get well I will give you my alarm that's all I have so the next day why his wife got well he started up to the temple and to offer up the lambs Kaya first the High Praise and he walked out and his work out and he seen blind but much he said oh blood back to my eyes well goes down he said I'm going oh High Praise to offer my lamp that I promised God for healing my wife and so he said blind batamas you cannot offer the lamb he said here I will give you some money and you go by a lamb to offer he said no I promise God this lamb oh if we do only do that keep our promise to God you see so if God you ask God this man the only thing that he has that he can go out is that lamb that lead him so that he can step down like this like this now he promised God and he never fail God he gave that lamb and offer to God if you ask God and some people sometimes when they ask God God gave to them for them to even to give offering the wavering the memory they cannot even give offering the only lamb that he has that he can take him he offered to that you know what got it God help him and open his eye Daddy see after that he didn't have no alarm to lead him so the children have to lead him and set him over there and begging and when the Lord Jesus Christ passing by he remembered him you see that so so when you do something and
