[Applause] [Music] tell me [Music] amen praise God God bless you Saints welcome into the house of the Lord on a Wednesday night our midweek service I know it's not easy for uh for you to get here sometimes you know the cares of this life and the the workload and these days you know like families need to work extra hard you know inflation is taking a toll God bless you say it's you may be seated inflation is certainly taking a great toll on on many people and they're finding it more difficult and so they have to work more they got to take part-time jobs interest rates have gone up um I left a bottle of water in the sanctuary if somebody could just grab me that bottle of water I'd appreciate it amen and so here we are uh you know in in the uh in a time where the world is uh in such a condition like um like just something to deal with and each and every family every home every individual is feeling the pressure that's coming down in this time in this age that we're living in amen and so by the grace of God we've been uh prepared for this type of condition by the grace of God God planned it that you would be in this time and in this season and that you would be uh filled with overcoming power so that you could deal with the circumstances that you're living in because you are the word that will be made manifest in this day and in this hour to prove God's word to prove that there are people that can overcome can overcome the trials and the testings and these this is what we're going to be looking at a little bit here tonight um we're going to be looking to let's open our Bibles to First Corinthians chapter 4. it's Bible study right so we are going to study a a certain aspect of the word of God tonight our title is character for the rapture the kind of character that God is building you and preparing you thank you brother for the Rapture amen he's preparing you he's given you a certain element of Faith so that you can overcome we've been on this series of rapturing faith and I believe that that we're under expectation that we need to know that God is going to give us what we need we need to be under the right expectation because you cannot overcome and fight the powers and the influences of this world you personally cannot do it you will blow up you will get frustrated you will get tired you know let's read the word of God and then let's let's look at some things so First Corinthians chapter 3 we're going to read from verse 9. amen let us pray first father we're so grateful for your word tonight Lord that we can come hear and assemble ourselves in such a way Lord with expectation in our hearts Lord I am as much under expectation as everyone that's here and everyone that's listening in online here tonight father if there's expectation in our hearts then you Lord will meet that expectation and so we ask you to take control of your word now anoint the speaker anoint our ears give us the Revelation Lord that we need to overcome in this hour in Jesus name amen praise God for we are laborers together with God ye are God's husbandry ye are God's Building according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon but let every man take heed how he buildeth there upon for other Foundation can no man lay then that is laid which is Jesus Christ now if any man build upon this Foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble Every Man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is if any man's work abideth which he hath built thereupon he shall receive a reward if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire amen you may be seated praise God Alleluia amen we know there's no other Foundation that we must build our experience and build our lives and build our character on there's nothing else as a son or a daughter of God that we should be looking to but Jesus Christ the foundation stone the foundation of our calling the foundation of Revelation in our lives and here we are as individuals living in this day that that God is expecting us to overcome by the character that we build in our experiences we need to recognize that character building is not something that that is built because of our interpretation because of how we feel because of how we we interpret something we must allow the word of God in the spirit of God to interpret all things we must filter it through the word of God Amen praise God when we look at the word character because we're talking about character for the rapture character of his bride listen when God you know when when Abraham sent out Eliezer to look for his son's bride he was looking for character he was looking for something in her and when when he found her there was something in her that was extremely attractive and you know God is attracted to his bride he wants the right kind of character he wants the right kind of experiences he wants us to produce the right kind of Life the right kind of attitude the way we serve him the way we we we we serve one another the way we treat one another the way we respect one another God is looking at that and he's seeing the kind of character that's being built and developed in each and every one of us and so when you look at the word character in the Bible it brings you to the word experience and experience is something that um you know when you look at it it says means the proof or testing of a thing we rejoice in Tribulation because it works out or produces patience while the latter develops and experience with God you see as we go through our trials as we get tested as we deal with the situations that we face as individuals because listen your experience is going to be different from mine you're gonna have to deal with different things depending on where you are in your life depending on your financial situation you might be constantly battling with finance and and so God is dealing through that Finance to build Christian character we don't look at these experiences and try and put our own feelings and interpretations on them because the minute we try to do that we we sometimes make decisions that take us away from God's word all of a sudden somebody's not making enough so they've got to do things that you know that that cause them to leave the word of God so instead of going to church I got to take that extra job and so now they're trusting in their own ability they're trusting in the fact that their experience is producing lack because of their lack of faith listen Revelation in the word of God when you as a son or a daughter of God have Revelation on on tithing and giving and and sowing and reaping into the kingdom of God you should never go without God will always make a way are there going to be times that you're going to be short are there going to be times that you're going to be tested of course why so that God can see and build the kind of character in you that he needs in order to produce a church that's going to stand on the word of God and believe this word for a body change if you can't believe for your you know your everyday simple needs Jesus said I will be with you I'll be in you until the end you're either going to believe God's word or you're not going to believe God's word and so through all of these struggles depending on where you are struggling and where it is that that God is developing a certain aspect of your of your of your uh attribute bringing out a portion of himself through you that character of Christ because we don't want our own characters our characters are are flawed because we're brought up in a world that that that you know shapes people by by experiences of of uh of man's interpretation you know uh here the world is accepting now you know like you think about marriage you know that a lot of marriages are falling apart because of how they feel they put how they feel above how the what the word says you can produce as a son and daughter of God that's married scripturally God is your post god is your typos God is the listen you're gonna have testings in your marriages but when you have a revelation that God is the foundation of your life then God will give you Faith to overcome in the marriage and the circumstances and build the kind of character that you need in order to produce rapturing faith in your life you know people think that you know all Faith you know you got to do great things no you got to learn to do the simple things in order to really receive the Simplicity of God's faith in your life amen praise God and so you know there's a story that comes to mind where you know somebody went to their Pastor it was a woman and she said you know uh Pastor um I'm living with with a husband that is an unbeliever he doesn't believe God's word and I'm I'm tired of it so um what do you think I should do he says well sister he says um the word says that you should stay with him he's constantly calling me he always wants to get back with me but I'm tired of living with with somebody that doesn't believe the word but it's not that it's not that she has the wrong interpretation on the word of God she should be looking to God and looking for the right attitude to the word of God amen praise God here I got a note here on that um so so she says finally I could no longer stand living stand having in common with him the most important thing in my life which is my faith so I let him but he's been calling me daily and begging me to come back what do you think God wants me to do that's easy the Pastor said your husband's lack of Christian faith is no grounds for a divorce according to First Corinthians 7. so God God's will is that you return to him the woman didn't like that answer and said it wasn't it wasn't a good one because I didn't know what what it was like to live with her husband but he responded and said ma'am you did not ask me what I would do if I were in your shoes you perhaps I would have backed out long before you did you see everybody's got their own experience but that's irrelevant to the matter you asked me about the will of God and that is clear in this situation your experience is not a license to disobey the word of God and this is the the whole aspect of our experiences it doesn't give us the right to put the word aside because of how we feel I'm going to read here from the Amplified version of First Corinthians 3 verses 9 and there's a few things here that I want to bring out through this teaching tonight on character for the rapture so we know that we are fellow workmen joint promoters laborers together with and for God you are God's garden and Vineyard and field under cultivation you are God's Building God is developing in you and producing in you character he's producing the true church the one that's going to stand in this hour that's going to overcome every situation that's that's coming down on the Earth right now and it's not going to get any better out there it's going to get a lot tougher but God chose you God chose you individually to produce his overcoming power in a in a an age where people are going to fall people are falling to the feelings because a man has feelings for another man it's okay for a man to take another man and and because I feel like I'm a woman then I can act like a woman you see people are building their whole experience here on Earth based on feelings because I feel like you know I just don't love them anymore it's because God is not in their life it's because God is not the foundation of their lives let's read on here now according to the grace the special Endowment for my task of God bestowed on me like a skill for skillful architect and master builder I laid foundation and now another man is building upon it but let each man be careful how he builds upon it for no other Foundation can anyone lay than that which is already laid which is Christ Jesus the anointed one but if anyone builds upon the foundation whether it be with gold silver precious stones wood hay straw now look look at look at those things because these are just examples and and they're using materials on what we're building our lives on what we're building our experiences on and there's going to be some things that we build on which are like like gold gold can be tried gold is is precious gold stands the test of of you can burn gold all you want but it's still gold Hallelujah and if you're an attribute of God no matter what trial comes your way no matter what test comes your way no matter how hard it gets God's Gonna Give You a character to overcome you will be an overcomer because your foundation is built on the word of God that that that that you're not mixing with anything else but if you're building if you're building your experience on on you know uh well I I I uh I haven't done anything bad in my life I'm I'm a good person I don't you know I don't do this I don't do that you're building your experience and you're building your um you're trying to uh acknowledge that your experience in Christ can be just on the fact that you're a good person it goes beyond being a good person it goes It goes into into aspects of a walk with God that you will be tried and tested like never before only for the purpose that God can bring out in you what's truly in you as a son or daughter of God verse 13 it says the work of each one will be complainely openly known shown for what it is for the day of Christ will disclose and declare it because it will be revealed with fire and the fire will test and critically appraise the character and worth of the work each person has done you will get tested and you will it will show in you what's really there you'll fight you'll you'll you'll fight situations in your life you'll you'll deal with circumstances that you think you can't overcome with you can't overcome but there's something in you that will because you've built your experience on the revelation of this word on the Rock Revelation you will overcome you will be able to deal with the circumstances you will continue to grow in Christ you will produce the supernatural in your life as you walk with God because you've allowed Christ to test you if the work which any person has built on this Foundation any product of his efforts whatsoever survive this test he will get a reward you will receive your reward if you continue to overcome you see one thing that it says about this bride in order to sit with Christ in his throne is that you need to overcome a lot of people say well God is going to do it yeah God's going to do it because you've got a revelation that God can do it not because you're just going to sit back and let God do everything in your life God has a plan for you but God also wants you to recognize your position your part in the word your your part in the ministry God wants you to get into your position as a son or a daughter of God so that you can so that you can know yourself what's in you what's designed and prepared in you in order to produce this rapturing grace in your life amen praise God hallelujah and so but if any person's work is burned up under the test he will suffer the loss of it all losing his reward though he himself will be saved but only as one who has passed through the fire hahaha you know there's there's going to be rewards to those that stood in their position if you as a son or a daughter of God are a son or daughter of God attribute of God you can't be lost there's nothing that's going to change your destination those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life was from before the foundations of the world there's nothing that can change your destination as a son or a daughter attribute of God but you can lose Victory right here and you can lose some rewards because when we go beyond this curtain of time God will have called you to a certain aspect to a certain position in the word of God and you you might have been lazy you weren't willing to you know to to give your all you weren't willing to to give all of yourself you know when when when God blessed you financially the first thing you did was you thought about what what what what can I get for myself instead of putting God first you see we can get distracted by this world we're constantly being bombarded about getting more that's what Leo decia was all about riched increased in Goods in need of nothing always looking to to get more but to to go for more without Christ is is less you you lose everything without Christ hallelujah praise God Amen so our teacher in every test whether it be a bad experience good experience let it be through God's word don't listen to anything that you're gonna you're gonna face trials don't listen to anything that's going to pull you away from the word of God don't allow those those things that seem well oh well I can do that I guess you know um doesn't matter if I do it this way or that way meanwhile you know that it's not according to the word of God you got to allow the word of God to be your foundation otherwise you're going to build on wood you're going to build on Hay you know what happens to Wood and hey when it gets into a fire God you got no power whatsoever you got no overcoming power you got no Victory whatsoever but if you've built it on on solid Stone on the solid foundation of God's word allow the word of God to do and to and to uh shape you and mold you in whatever way God wants to mold you and shape you then that will stand and that's why you're able to stand in this day and in this hour you know the world is going through a burning right now this whole world is being tested like never before remember the Great Tribulation it's slowly creeping in and it's creeping in on the people in such a way that they think everything is fine it's like a frog you put a frog in the middle of a pot and you know you just start to warm it up you start to warm up the water and the Frog is feeling really good and you know he's thinking that everything's okay and before you know it somebody's having frog legs for dinner right okay well you don't want to allow your your your experience to be controlled in that way you don't want to uh you got to realize what's going on around you you need to realize that God is is calling a church God is shaping a people God is perfecting you testing you trying you don't don't be afraid of the of the trials and the and the tribulations amen but just allow the word to be your foundation we don't want to we don't want to have a repeat of what happened back in the Garden of Eden where you know where Satan came and said oh you know this tree is good you know it's good for you it's going to make you feel good it's good you know he gave her all the experience physically and she bought into it and and what did it cause it caused the greatest fall amen praise God simple so don't allow feelings to be how you interpret your experiences and how you build your experiences let the word of God Be Your Foundation let that be what you build it upon Allelujah praise God human wisdom fleshly attractions they may have a place in your life but not in the building of the church we're building the church upon this church is being built upon Jesus Christ nothing changes when you're out there and you're talking to people oh I'm a Christian you know ask them how are you baptized have you received the Holy Ghost what do you mean well how are you baptized well I was baptized as a baby well babies don't believe maybe it's just say Google Gaga and cry and they want to be fed how can a baby possibly know the Bible says clearly repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is what interprets the word and the Holy Ghost is what gives you an experience as a Christian you can't even claim to be a Christian unless you've got the Holy Ghost the only way you can be a Christian is if you've got the Holy Ghost it can't be on fleshly wisdom there's no way that this church is going to be oh will you come to our church it's full every Sunday we got the best musicians we got the best singers we've got the best programs we've got marriage counseling we've got children's counseling we've got all the they've got the the finest men's wisdom in men's teachings on things that that you know that that could make us look like we're just a small little church here you know but but we've got something that they haven't got Hallelujah and that is the Holy Ghost the power of God to to deliver you as an individual to give you overcoming power to declare himself in you Christ in you your hope of glory you have something that that the rest of this world you know once in a while I start to think and I say oh God what Grace what Grace that you that you chose a vessel like this I'm still weak I'm still frail I'm still like anybody else susceptible to sickness susceptible to to uh being tired you're still human but there's a revelation that that God placed in our hearts that that that is beyond our understanding it goes beyond our ability goes beyond our experiences goes beyond our mistakes are you gonna still make mistakes of course you're going to make mistakes you're a human there's nothing perfect but Christ hallelujah praise God you know um you can't weigh your your you know it was it was Moody that said wisely he said that converts ought to be weighed as well as counted people look at just adding to the church oh well we can build a bigger church we need to build we need to get more people in the church because they want numbers but they need to be weighed they need to be checked they need to be tested they need to be tried when somebody comes into the household of faith then the word of God starts to purge their life starts to try them test them see what's really in there you know you don't know what's in you I didn't know what was in me when God called me 30 years ago I had no idea that he was gonna place you know Place me into the ministry to to serve as a deacon and and and and to be a part of a Ministry to to help grow a Ministry to to to no idea that this was actually inside but that was not me that was the attribute that was God's plan that was God's purpose when God places you in the body of Christ he saw your position before you even were born Hallelujah God saw Daniel playing the drums he saw that he would be faithful at playing the drums you think that's not a position in the body of Christ it's a position in the body of Christ can rapturing Faith be be developed by Michelle playing the piano you better believe it because if she's doing it by faith and she understands that that that that she can be anointed of God to put music out into the into the ears of the people because of her consecration her prayer his desire his prayer his desire to to to to to to edify the body of Christ it will do it it will produce faith and you will see the supernatural working through your individual lives you will know that oh I'm not just a drummer in the church God has something greater for me because I'm I'm receiving all this Revelation on the word of God I can't believe that I'm seeing what he's saying I'm hearing the word and I'm recognizing the word why because the attribute in you was ordained from before the foundations of the world to overcome to build a character to be placed in the body for the purpose of God so that he can take his bride the body's got to come together all that the father hath given me will come he didn't say might so every attribute that belongs to this ministry must come there's nothing that is going to stop them from coming why how do I know that because I came because you came because you you didn't choose to come you didn't choose to be a part of this it's because God saw you from before the foundations of The World God had a plan for you God knew that you would have to face laodicea God knew that you would have to face the most wicked most deceiving age but he also placed in you the ability to overcome and produce exactly what he requires so that you can edify the body so that you can you you can be a strength in the house of the Lord you can you you can allow the Holy Spirit to use you in in the small simple way that God wants to use you when you surrender to God you allow the spirit of God to use you in the simplest ways don't don't don't let those thoughts that come to you oh you know what go to the church and and and do some Landscaping at the church go and and do some uh cleaning at the church you might think well that's you know oh okay don't put that aside that's God speaking to you in simplicity God wants to see how obedient you are to him so he'll give you the simplest little things to do from time to time you might think it's simple when you vacuum the sanctuary every Sunday there brother Eugene but let me tell you something that's God that's the anointing of God upon his life he's recognizing his position in the word of God and he's Allowing God to do it and God will vindicate and show him by Revelation the simplest Little Things and then when a trial comes when a trial comes God God does not forget what you're what you've built your experience on God God God knows that that you overcame that Spirit of laziness so that you could do things in the house of the Lord that you could you you you overcame that that that feeling of well I don't just don't feel like it but because you overcame that an element of the supernatural starts to move around your life that's why you can you you can see people go through great trials and then two three weeks later they're standing just as strong as they ever did what is that what is that but then there's some that when the fiery trial comes because it wasn't built on the foundation of the word by the revelation of God's word God's testing God's trying God's God's pushing and and pulling in the constant battles that that we have to overcome the greatest battles that we constantly overcome because of that that that that that you know like it's like it's a simple things that we do sometimes that we think you know it doesn't matter but it does when you do those simple things of being consistent in your position when you're consistent in your position the supernatural comes when you need it it just it's there all of a sudden you're doing something you know God showed you you know God LED you in this way but then you you know you you face a barrier you face a test don't fear greater is he that is in you than he that is in this world God will make a way for you God will overcome that situation because of the simple obedience to the word of God glory to God Amen thank you Jesus blessed be the name of the Lord I want to read a quote here it's from the laodicean church age we're going to slowly wind down here you had better come before it's too late saith the Lord and by of me gold tried in the fire and then you will be truly rich are we getting it listen to me naked physically we came into the world but naked spiritually we will not leave oh no we are going to take something with us but I thought you know you don't take nothing with you you don't realize that you're just being molded and shaped and and and a character is being developed in you because you do have free moral agency remember that a lot of people well praise God I'll just leave it with the Lord I didn't go to work this week I didn't feel like it got up late couple times and you know I just decided I wouldn't go and then you lose your job oh well praise God I'll let the Lord provide me a new job no no you need to have common sense in everything that you do God is giving you wisdom remember experience when experience after experience after experience takes place and you face certain trials over and over and over again we trust that you will gain some wisdom to know what to do with the word to know how you can bring Victory into your life by doing certain things he says what is that something is is all we can take with us nothing less and nothing more so we had better be real careful now to see what we take something that will make us right before God so then what will we take with us we will take our character brother that is what we will take with us now what kind of character will you take with you will it be his like his whose character was molded by suffering in a fiery furnace of affliction or will it be the softness of this characterless laodicean people it is up to each one of us for in that day every man will bear his own burden you are being developed right now to have the character of Christ you are being developed right now to produce Supernatural faith and there's only one way that you're going to produce that is when you recognize when you hear and you act upon the word of God when God reveals to you simply and I'm talking this is a personal walk eh this is not a a you know a group discussion over here yeah we're having a group discussion but God is speaking to individuals here tonight that's how this works you know it's not it's not a a message you know I wasn't led to bring a message on oh the open you know the word and the Seven Seals and this and that no the Lord led me to this message because he's working and molding my character right now and God is dealing with situations in my life in order to produce certain characteristics so that I can fulfill my position in the word of God and that's what God is doing he's he's preparing and developing character within us because when you've got the right character you're able to rule over your own life and then rule over the situations that you have to face as an individual here on this Earth listen here we're going to read one more quote from Brother Branham and it's from from the seven Church ages again the Sumerian Church age in Hebrews 5 8 9 I was talking about Christ though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered can you imagine the word was made flesh dwelt Among Us but yet he had to learn obedience in order to fulfill his part in the word of God so if the Creator himself comes down to the Earth and has to come under obedience to God's word which was his own word because God cannot lie God had to God sent forth his word God said that that that there would have to be a sacrifice the Lamb of God that would take away the sins of the world but he came as a he came as God in a human vessel in it and the human vessel he had to learn obedience to deal with this human vessel he had to overcome the humanity the character of this human vessel that is always trying to look for the easy way everybody's like that everybody's always looking for the easy way out everybody's got an excuse why this why that excuses those are your excuses those are human excuses that's not God can do all things I can do all things through Christ the Bible says all things are possible to them that believe the reason why you see a situation in your life and you think it's impossible is because you don't believe it's as simple as that I don't care what the situation is I don't care what the doctor's report is he's still the Lord God that healeth all of your diseases I don't care what your diseases are people want to make excuses for their for their diseases for their for their for their uh you know weaknesses in the flesh we all got them but Christ is still my healer I may not be fully healed right now but he's still my healer and I'm going to still I I still claim the word of God that he is the Lord God that healeth all my diseases and I'm not gonna I'm not gonna I'm not gonna step back from that I don't care what devil stands in front of me and says you got this you got that yeah I my God you listen to some people I got this problem got that problem I got this I got that I got this from my father I got this from my mother what in the world is that that's not faith I got the Lord Jesus greater is he that is in me than he that is in this world I don't care what the doctor's report is I'm believing the word of God I'm standing on the word of God I'm going to keep walking with God if if listen if I'm going to burn out I might as well burn out for Christ if my time and your time is up you can't stop it to everything there is a time and a season and Jesus Christ knew his time and his season and because he knew his time in his season he could stand by Perfect faith when he stood there and he says you tear down this Tabernacle in three days I'll raise it up again he had a revelation of who he was he knew what he was called to produce he knew what God had placed in him to fulfill and so he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he had to suffer and being made perfect he became the author now the author of Eternal salvation what's he talking about there he's going to bring the Eternal attributes of God he's going to return them he's going to save them he's going to redeem them he was the author of Eternal salvation so if you're an attribute of God you can never be lost you can never sin as an attribute of God this can sin but the attribute will never sin Hallelujah he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them now listen that obey him that obey him simply obey simply let the holy spirit guide you in simple ways do the things that you know as a as a a member of this church if God has placed you in this church he's got a purpose in placing you in this church so fulfill the purpose and the and the things that God has shown you to do keep it simple allow him in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering and according to Paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection so when you're tested in the fire when you're tested at work when you're tested with the doctor's report when you're tested with a poor relationship with somebody just let the the word of God be the foundation of that test and know that God will make a way for you he's already made a way for you otherwise he he'd be a liar he says my word shall not return unto me void all that you've been given to produce all that you are you will produce it you will fulfill it you will overcome the the battles of this life and you will have a character that will shine before God Amen Hallelujah according to Paul he's left a measure of suffering and would come to a place of perfection why why did he want this James 1 2-4 my brother encountered all joy you know sometimes it's not easy to be joyful when you're in the middle of a trial it's not when you're sick in bed or when you're feeling the pain or when when somebody's really hurt you but that's where the word comes right up in you it'll it'll it'll just raise up in you and it'll say count up Joy count it all joy when you face and fall into diverse Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith God is testing your revelation God is testing your testimony God is testing to see whether you truly believe your own personal testimony Hallelujah and knowing this that the Trine of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that ye made perfect may be perfect and entire wanting nothing now why does he stand by the reason is in Romans 8 17 18 God will always be there remember don't worry about the the trial trust God in the trial trust God that he's building character in you Romans 8 17 and 18 and if children then heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together you see it's the body of Christ right now the greatest test that's going on in the world is within the body of Jesus Christ the world is going through its prophecy but that's the world but the bride she's got to produce rapturing faith in her life the only way she's going to do that is when she can recognize who she is in the word that she's actually the word in her day being tried being tested being molded being shaped so that it will produce the rapture that's the outcome of your trying and your testing Christ's victory was going to the Cross all the all the trying and all the testing and everything else brought the greatest Victory to you and me he knew what he had to do he knew what he had to overcome and we must know that we've got a our lives are not ours anymore our life is lost in Christ we gotta give it all so listen here he goes on so and if children then heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for I reckon that the suffering of this present time the sufferings of this present time I don't know what you're going through tonight I don't know what you're dealing with I don't know I know what I'm dealing with I know the situations that I gotta deal with in my life you need to know whatever it is that that you're dealing with but I need you to bring it to the Forefront right now because I've got a word of God for you right now that's gonna that's gonna give you something Hallelujah unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to Reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering you can never make it without suffering character is a victory it's not a gift God just doesn't give you his character God brings out his character in you as you overcome as you overcome the situations in your life how you how you communicate your attitude shows exactly where your altitude is in Christ if you're the kind of person that's got always got a negative attitude everything's oh yeah the weather's terrible today what about the nice weather that's coming this weekend I'm dealing with weather right now for the last week and a half you know in in in the garden center business all the guys that are running and operating Garden Center businesses they're all crying the blues because the weather's been terrible but guess what the sun is coming Hallelujah the sun is on the way glory to God so you have to suffer Victory is not a gift a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic you try to gain in this world and you try to and all you're thinking about is gain gain gain the more I can gain the more I can have I need this and I I want a bigger house I want to be gain gain gain it it's that's that's gonna produce a character of greed sheep I know multi-millionaires that are cheap they they they could burn money but yet they're cheap they don't want to give they don't want to let go they think that it's mine I worked for it I made it and they're not willing to let go it shows the kind of character that's really there they don't have an understanding that God owns it all he gives and he takes if he wants to give blessed be his name if he wants to take blessed be his name that's God's prerogative that's God's way but Power with character is fit to rule you know that God is perfect why do I gotta build character brother you know what do I need all this character for because we're not done once we go we go for three and a half years but we got to come back and Rule we need to come back with Christ here on this Earth for another Thousand Years yep yep another Thousand Years imagine this Earth still got another thousand years before the new heavens and the new Earth according to the word of God it's that that's that's God's plan for this Earth and for us if it wasn't he wouldn't have sent his word that's why you know you talk to people and they're they're telling you about dinosaurs a million years ago they're telling you about you know galaxies and universes and everything else but they but they failed to recognize yeah but you know what God has a plan right here right now for you and me we need to focus on that and right now God is building character in you and me so that we can be fit to rule in the millennium let the musicians come and since he wants us to share listen since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and is set down in his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in US when he comes oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation thinking not strange concerning the fiery trials that are to try you that is what Peter said it is strange that God wants us to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering no sir and we all have trials we all have tried we are all tried and chastened as Sons no one but goes through that glory to God bless you Saints I trust that tonight there was something that you know stirred within your heart got you to look a little deeper into your life give you a little bit of clarity and a little bit of light on why God you know if you if you're facing the same trial over and over and over again there's a message there there's something there that God wants you to overcome it's not that very trial that you're facing it's something in your character it's your attitude it's the way you deal and so God uses the boss God uses the rebellious child God uses a little bit of sickness so that he can get you back into obedience and into a into in into into a place where you can be consistent with God and not one day you're way out on left field the next day you're way over there you know people people we need to we need to stay down the middle of the road we need to find a balance in our walk with God and sometimes God uses the simple things in our lives to bring us back into balance so that our character can be reflecting him and not our own ideas our own outbursts our own attitudes you know that's why you got to stay away from getting caught up with these you know uh people that are that are like uh you know rebellious against the government rebellious against this Rebellion oh they're taking this away from us they're taking that away from us that's not who you are you're not a part of that economy you are in God's economy God has a purpose and a plan for your life your economy is perfectly fine because you've got the greatest president director boss ruler healer doctor you've got it all in Christ Jesus you need to stay right there and just let the Holy Spirit take control in the circumstances in your life but do the things that he shows you to do and you will immediately see the victories God shows you a certain thing that you know like you're you know in your in your physical uh health and and he reveals something to you and tells you to stay away from this food and and you know God will show you those things and all of a sudden when you just listen to that still Small Voice you obey it you come under obedience to it you you stay consistent with it God looks for consistency I look at workers that work for me I look for them to show up on time I like it when they show up even before me it shows that there's some consistency in them they've got a character in them they've got certain self you know self-esteem that reflects in their lives and in their work that shows good character that's what he's working on in you and me here tonight God bless you Saints go ahead brother [Applause] [Music] to keep [Music] the message [Music] I understand things [Music] to me [Music] we are past seven days [Music] please [Music] [Applause] [Music] all Moses has already gone he has prepared away [Music] brought us to the Jordan and he was taken away but
