and we love you for the victory in the name of our Jesus Christ amen hallelujah please will take your Bible with me let's go to have two scriptures Amos 8: 11 to3 if you [Music] say Amos 8 [Music] 11 and the next scripture is Psalms 421 to3 so you read Amos first it says that behold the day come the days come said the Lord God that I will send a fing in the land not a fine of bread nor a thir for water but of hearing the word the words of the Lord and they shall Wonder from sea to Sea and from the north even to the east they shall run to and fr to seek the to seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it in that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst and Psalm 42 1 to3 okay as the heart panted after the water BR so panted my soul after God my soul FS for God for the Living God When shall I come and I before God my fears have been my meat day and night while they to me where is please be seated Hallelujah God is it so funny I [Music] than my topic here this afterno of the subject matter is why people are not satisfied and so fun because I had a privilege to have a fellowship with here on thir day you never knew I be standing here today you just felling around the word he was talking all about my thought when I was laughing just fellowshipping everything was around what God livs in my heart to bring in this aftering so I believe that it will be a blessing to you and I'll just start by reading a little quot here from the prophet of God in the message um that day on Calvary and then he said that what will it be what will it be when you get to heaven and you meet there for that great time of everlasting Eternal Fellowship I just want to come a little bit for my thoughts say just think there is not anything that you can think of that you like to do but what once in a while you tie in doing it sh I guess you and I have squaring answered more than anything that we like to do in the way of that but you know you get tired doing it and I like to hide get into the mountains and just hide but I get tired sometimes and I want to do something else sometimes I get a feeling kind of tired and wor out nerves on edge I'll just jump in my car and take out and hold to the St whe going down the road singing I am so glad that I can see I'm one of them that's why it miss my soul or something just gripping that room and singing and stomping my food and shouting and well after a while I get tired and I return back home so in other words he was trying to say that whil you're on this Earth nothing that you do that really have that lasting satisfaction what iy like you satisfy it doesn't last for instance if I want to buy a watch I save all my money to make sure I get that once I get that I become so happy J this very exciting but after a while that satisfaction just go like that the same thing applies to your first house your first car everything you so excited into it and you cherish it we need to have it we are here we need all those things I'm not saying that we don't we need them but what I'm trying to say is that after you got all those you very happy and satisfying jumping up and down but after 2 3 years that you don't value it the same as you get it for the first time and men were made that way to so we always testing for something and there is a desire for everybody to be um successful in life yeah to be successful in life and people define success in life is that when you have the highest education you become a lawyer a doctor and all that kind and stuff so people who don't have that sometimes they look
