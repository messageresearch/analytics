[32:45] giving glory to god before the coming
[32:49] forth of the word of god
[32:52] we
[32:52] would like to speak from revelation
[32:55] chapter 4
[32:58] reading from verse 1
[33:01] verse 1 is the only verse that we will
[33:05] read
[33:06] and before
[33:08] we even read it just let us pray our
[33:11] gracious heavenly father
[33:14] in the name of jesus
[33:16] once again we have this privilege and
[33:18] honor to approach
[33:20] thee by the way of prayer
[33:23] and to stand before your
[33:25] beloved people as you draw near

[33:32] settle upon your people
[33:35] may the word of god go forth may every
[33:39] life be revived and inspired father as
[33:43] we commit ourselves to you now
[33:46] with the
[33:47] life from the word
[33:49] coming to us as your people in jesus
[33:53] name amen and amen the lord bless you
[33:56] praise god god bless you
[33:59] brothers and sisters
[34:00] amen
[34:02] after this
[34:05] i looked
[34:06] and behold a door was opened in heaven
[34:11] and the first voice which i heard
[34:14] was as it were of a trumpet
[34:17] talking with me which said
[34:20] come up hither
[34:22] and i will shoot these things
[34:24] which must be
[34:26] here after amen god bless you just that
[34:30] one verse will do
[34:32] praise god
[34:35] after this
[34:36] of course brother branham says after
[34:39] this meaning after the church ages
[34:42] after the church jesus are over
[34:45] the last one is done
[34:47] after this
[34:49] a door is opened
[34:51] in heaven
[34:53] praise god the word begins to open up
[34:56] but let me not begin to speak on those
[35:00] things
[35:01] i want to quote from brother branham
[35:03] himself christ is the mystery of god
[35:06] revealed
[35:07] and he says here paragraph 6 37
[35:12] being spiritual
[35:14] if you're watching spiritual things
[35:18] not knowing this but god knows it
[35:22] but if you turn now and look at the
[35:25] clock behind you
[35:27] it's on the dot of two o'clock
[35:31] it's the end of the second pull
[35:34] the third pull is at hand
[35:38] oh at the name of jesus bowing
[35:42] falling prostrate at his feet
[35:45] king of kings in heaven will crown him
[35:49] when our journey is complete oh precious
[35:53] name
[35:54] yes friends
[35:56] the second pull has been made
[35:59] manifested
[36:01] amen praise god and now he says did you
[36:05] notice
[36:07] that the spirit took
[36:09] the same song not another song but the
[36:12] same song
[36:14] but now picking it up
[36:17] taking it into a higher octave
[36:22] the next pull is now at hand amen oh
[36:27] friends don't you see
[36:29] god taking us with the same message that
[36:33] was always there
[36:36] he didn't change the song he didn't
[36:37] change the message
[36:40] the quotes are the same the word is the
[36:42] same but there is
[36:45] i don't know if you don't know it but i
[36:47] am feeling it i i'm experiencing it
[36:51] praise god there is something
[36:53] supernatural going on
[36:57] you can't explain it you can't
[36:59] it's nothing you can talk about but you
[37:02] either have to be a part of it in it or
[37:05] you won't even know what's happening
[37:07] because god has brought us in the middle
[37:10] of the pyramid
[37:12] praise god he's brought us into his
[37:15] secret chamber
[37:17] the bride's chamber the king's chamber
[37:20] and there we're having constant
[37:22] conference with the living god
[37:25] now
[37:27] and up picking the same song
[37:30] and picking it up
[37:32] into an octave higher like that what is
[37:35] it
[37:36] the next pull is at hand
[37:39] and take the name of jesus with you
[37:42] praise god hallelujah amen did you
[37:45] notice the scripture come up hither
[37:49] the changes are over
[37:52] it's all over it's now come up to a
[37:55] higher dimension
[37:58] go into a higher revelation
[38:01] a higher place with god the spirit at
[38:05] the end of the church ages
[38:07] john being a type of the true believer
[38:11] the spirit is telling him john the ages
[38:15] are over and now you've got to come up
[38:18] higher
[38:19] praise god hallelujah amen now how do we
[38:23] go up higher
[38:25] now we find in matthew chapter 17 verses
[38:28] 1 right on down to verse three
[38:32] after six days
[38:34] jesus taketh peter james and john his
[38:37] brother and bringing them up
[38:40] into a high mountain
[38:43] apart
[38:45] and
[38:46] was transfigured he jesus
[38:49] the same word that they knew all that
[38:53] three and a half years it's the same
[38:55] word it hasn't changed
[38:57] but now the word is transfigured before
[39:01] them
[39:02] o praise god and his face did shine as
[39:06] the sun
[39:07] and his raiment was as white as snow and
[39:11] behold
[39:12] there appeared unto them moses and
[39:16] elijah
[39:18] speaking talking with them amen
[39:21] hallelujah praise god not only did he
[39:26] take him up into the mountain
[39:28] where they begin to see him the word
[39:32] uh under another influence they saw the
[39:36] word now revelated translated uh
[39:40] transformed before their very eyes they
[39:43] were looking at it every day every day
[39:46] for years they're reading it they're
[39:48] hearing it they're seeing it they heard
[39:50] every sermon that the prophet preached
[39:52] they heard every sermon jesus preached
[39:55] but now it's the same jesus but he's
[39:58] transfigured before them
[40:00] [Music]
[40:01] and when he he was transfigured before
[40:04] them
[40:05] their god so empowered by the holy
[40:08] spirit
[40:09] they begin to see a clear revelation
[40:12] from the beginning of the bible
[40:16] right to the times of jesus
[40:18] it says that moses and elijah were
[40:21] talking to them up there they were able
[40:24] to see the path of life the revelation
[40:28] of the word making itself clear before
[40:31] them praise be to god
[40:33] hallelujah listen to god's prophet man
[40:37] speaks on the message at thy word
[40:40] may every person
[40:42] that's been bound by sense bound
[40:46] right
[40:47] living in a sense bound
[40:50] existence where they are only trusting
[40:54] in what they can see
[40:57] what they can hear what they can feel or
[41:01] what they can smell
[41:03] oh my friends may you all begin to allow
[41:07] that to fall away from you
[41:11] may it go from you so that you might
[41:14] rise into the realms the higher realms
[41:18] of the holy spirit oh may this church
[41:21] rock with the power of the holy ghost
[41:24] oh praise god lose your self-bound
[41:27] existence forget about yourself it's
[41:31] nothing to do with us friends it's
[41:34] nothing to do with us not our works not
[41:38] our trying to work yourself up into an
[41:40] emotion or into a man-made holiness that
[41:44] you produce by your own efforts
[41:47] but this is now to a place where god has
[41:51] brought us into the perfect liberty of
[41:53] jesus christ
[41:55] this is the hour when the holy spirit
[41:57] has freed us amen to a place where we
[42:01] are really free we are really liberated
[42:05] we are not even trusting in our own
[42:07] works

[45:08] hallelujah oh my god is good isn't he
[45:13] many of you have followed this message
[45:15] believe this message myself i believe
[45:18] the message of the living god since my
[45:20] teenage oh following the line of the
[45:23] holy spirit all the way i could not
[45:26] explain everything i did not understand
[45:29] everything but from the very first day i
[45:33] heard the message of god i felt
[45:36] something in my soul telling me even
[45:39] though i can't understand it here
[45:42] something here tells me that's right
[45:45] amen and i've held to god's word to this
[45:49] hour
[45:50] and i'll continue to the hall to god's
[45:53] war to the end oh my praise god
[45:57] hallelujah
[45:58] oh thank god you know god portrays
[46:02] himself as an eagle jehovah eagle
[46:06] he portrays his prophets
[46:08] also as eagles great eagles now listen
[46:12] to
[46:13] the prophet speaking about eagles right
[46:17] here in this marvelous message
[46:21] if an eagle can have confidence
[46:24] in the two wings that god gave him
[46:26] how much more can we as believers have
[46:30] confidence in the holy ghost that save
[46:33] your soul and baptize your soul
[46:37] amen
[46:39] now
[46:40] i watch that eagle
[46:42] there from in the woods
[46:46] he didn't push
[46:48] he didn't squabble
[46:50] he just made one leap
[46:52] i would say leap of faith he made one
[46:55] leap
[46:56] see
[46:57] and he just decided that's it i'm not
[47:01] standing this anymore praise god and he
[47:05] jumped out
[47:07] and set his wings
[47:09] and when he did that
[47:11] the first time he had to flop a couple
[47:14] of times he had to flop those wings you
[47:17] got to do some works at first it looks
[47:19] like works and looks like hard life hard
[47:22] christianity you got to really try hard
[47:25] to be a christian everything else like
[47:28] that and he flopped a couple of times
[47:31] and once he got above the rest of it
[47:35] amen the rest of all they are get to
[47:39] that just set his wings what did he do
[47:42] he put his faith in them wings that god
[47:45] gave him to get now into action now i
[47:49] want you to recognize whether branham
[47:51] preached this message but you've got to
[47:53] understand the voice that came through
[47:56] him was not brother branham
[47:59] that was god using a prophet to speak
[48:03] through the spirit speaks through the
[48:05] prophet
[48:06] that was the holy spirit ministering
[48:09] onto his bride
[48:11] hallelujah
[48:13] and so
[48:14] we understand what was going on here
[48:17] that he
[48:19] he put his
[48:21] faith into his wings and got into action
[48:25] brother branham preached recognizing
[48:28] hearing you heard the word
[48:32] you've been hearing it for all these
[48:33] years
[48:34] then it got to a certain place where
[48:36] revelation struck you
[48:38] you begin to recognize
[48:41] of course brother bradley explains
[48:42] recognize means understand see perceive
[48:45] observe you perceive it and you take it
[48:48] in
[48:49] after you hear it you recognize it then
[48:52] the next thing you got to put it into
[48:53] action
[48:55] right many messages have been preached
[48:57] about the angels that were around the
[48:59] throne when isaiah saw them you know
[49:02] with their various wings and so on but
[49:04] he says get into action
[49:06] praise god but you see is humanly
[49:09] speaking we still thinking sense bound
[49:11] get into action mean that you gotta run
[49:14] out here run out there run after this
[49:16] person chase after that wong lasso the
[49:19] next
[49:20] relative you have throw them to the
[49:22] ground and put a brand a message brand
[49:25] on them and
[49:26] you know what i'm saying oh my but we
[49:29] understand friends that that's not what
[49:32] it is telling us about
[49:35] get into action
[49:37] it's not you
[49:38] getting into action but positioning your
[49:42] wings and positioning yourself
[49:44] that the spirit of god can take you and
[49:47] begin to act and work through you for
[49:50] this is the writing of another book of
[49:53] acts and the book of acts says the
[49:55] prophet of god it's not the action of
[49:58] the apostles but the acts of the holy
[50:01] spirit himself working through the
[50:03] apostles
[50:05] so that getting into action is letting
[50:08] go yourself and let the holy spirit
[50:10] begin to act through you
[50:13] be yourself
[50:15] don't try to be somebody else
[50:18] don't try to be like brother branham
[50:20] with a belt buckle and stand up like him
[50:23] and talk like him and act like him oh my
[50:26] goodness there's only one god sent like
[50:29] him
[50:30] is that right we are we are just
[50:32] following what he left behind the word
[50:34] amen right just relax
[50:38] right seven church ages the prophet said
[50:41] uh be simple be humble he said don't go
[50:45] walking and making yourself well in the
[50:47] midst of the people you might not say it
[50:49] but the way you're walking and acting
[50:50] i'm a christian i'm born again i'm
[50:52] different from you no he says we are all
[50:55] the same
[50:56] amen
[50:57] only that you are the weak weeping
[51:00] crying and thanking god that out of the
[51:03] midst of this mess that we have in the
[51:05] world today
[51:06] god called you out and cleansed you and
[51:09] washed you by his precious blood and
[51:11] that's why you're here today by the
[51:14] grace of god
[51:16] amen not by the will of man
[51:19] not by the will of man but by the will
[51:22] or purpose of the living god you're here
[51:25] led by the holy spirit
[51:27] he said how do you think you come in
[51:29] here tonight you think you just walked
[51:32] in of yourself you think you just come
[51:35] like that he says you're here because
[51:37] the spirit of god led you here amen
[51:40] and you are hearing what you're supposed
[51:42] to hear because you're the ones that
[51:45] supposed to hear what you're hearing
[51:48] god placed the day the time the person
[51:50] the word of everything everything praise
[51:53] god just as in the vision of the prophet
[51:56] except everything being placed nothing
[51:57] will happen but god set you here he set
[52:00] the time set the place set everything up
[52:03] so praise god hallelujah

[52:14] spirit of christ speaking

[53:38] puff of wind he never flopped in that
[53:41] wind ever again no more works your
[53:44] work's over

[53:56] took him higher and higher and another
[53:59] wind come and it took him even higher

[1:00:55] god
[1:00:56] and we do that you see you've got to do
[1:00:59] it you've got to keep claiming you see
[1:01:02] instead of backsliding like israel did
[1:01:05] you've got to keep climbing climbing but
[1:01:09] don't stay on the same ground all the
[1:01:13] time you'll be back sliding like israel
[1:01:16] did

[1:01:29] he's going to go back
[1:01:30] but if he if he flops and everything
[1:01:33] else then he's going to go up right
[1:01:35] upstream so that's what he's talking
[1:01:37] about here amen
[1:01:39] now notice jesus did not put on public
[1:01:42] shows to make himself into some kind of
[1:01:45] a club
[1:01:47] is that right
[1:01:48] now he's talking about how some of the
[1:01:49] people every night coming to his
[1:01:51] meetings
[1:01:53] and all they want to see is miracles
[1:01:55] all they want to see is them calling out
[1:01:57] the people like like somebody putting on
[1:01:59] a show they don't realize it was for a
[1:02:02] purpose
[1:02:03] it it's going to it's the attraction
[1:02:07] on the mountain
[1:02:09] it's the sign of the time it's going to
[1:02:12] track the rainbow trout it's going to
[1:02:15] catch the attention of the true
[1:02:17] believers
[1:02:18] now watch i want you to see
[1:02:21] jesus's ascension and how the ascension
[1:02:24] started amen they didn't even realize it
[1:02:28] where the ascension started now watch
[1:02:30] him jesus as he stands there this is
[1:02:34] from the infallible proof of the
[1:02:35] resurrection
[1:02:37] as he stands there
[1:02:39] gravitational
[1:02:41] begins to lose its power
[1:02:44] amen
[1:02:45] now
[1:02:47] watch his feet begin to come up from the
[1:02:50] earth
[1:02:51] and there's a light beneath his feet
[1:02:53] and he rises higher and higher and
[1:02:56] higher for gravitation lost his power
[1:03:00] and death lost its power
[1:03:04] now i know he's talking about jesus but
[1:03:06] the speaks of you too
[1:03:08] if you see the true word of god
[1:03:10] gravitation is losing its power over you
[1:03:14] hallelujah
[1:03:15] another place he says you know how it's
[1:03:17] losing his power you're being
[1:03:18] pressurized for the journey
[1:03:21] amen he says them other birds hawks and
[1:03:24] all those things he said they can't fly
[1:03:27] up where the eagles are why he says
[1:03:29] they're not pressurized amen so come to
[1:03:33] a joy when you pass through fiery trials
[1:03:37] for the trying of your faith work and
[1:03:39] patience amen
[1:03:41] yes sir your fail of your faith amen
[1:03:45] listen see
[1:03:47] he was the center of all gravitation
[1:03:51] he is the creator of gravitation
[1:03:54] he holds gravitation at his command
[1:03:58] just as he holds death at his command
[1:04:02] praise god he stops there but the rest
[1:04:05] of it how i'm talking here with you
[1:04:08] is that as you believe this word and
[1:04:11] recognize that you are not only
[1:04:14] believing the word
[1:04:16] you begin to see that you are a part
[1:04:19] of that word
[1:04:21] so when he is talking about him now and
[1:04:24] the gravitational power leaving him and
[1:04:26] he's starting to rupture or ascend
[1:04:30] he don't even know it but he's going
[1:04:32] i want you to know the rapture is now in
[1:04:35] progress
[1:04:37] the rapture is now in progress the
[1:04:39] rapture
[1:04:40] as people believed and many still
[1:04:43] believe is not just at an event on a
[1:04:46] certain day
[1:04:48] but it is a process
[1:04:51] glory unto glory unto glory until at the
[1:04:55] last
[1:04:56] on a certain dead time i don't know when
[1:04:58] nobody knows when you step right into
[1:05:01] glory
[1:05:02] oh praise god you step out of this
[1:05:05] looking glass world right into the
[1:05:07] reality of the perfect will and powers
[1:05:10] of god hallelujah oh my praise god
[1:05:15] listen brother brandon speaking now
[1:05:17] the manifestation of these gifts
[1:05:21] are given to any man to prophet
[1:05:24] wherewithal
[1:05:26] and i believe
[1:05:28] all gifts are wonderful and we need
[1:05:32] gifts and we respect them praise god in
[1:05:36] the church of god
[1:05:37] but i believe
[1:05:40] that time is coming
[1:05:42] when it's taking this
[1:05:45] and we are going to a higher standard
[1:05:48] than gifts
[1:05:49] after all these things is done away with
[1:05:53] all gifts all speaking in towns all this
[1:05:56] all that you heard paul say it in
[1:05:59] first corinthians 13
[1:06:01] then he says when all this will be done
[1:06:05] away with
[1:06:06] only love
[1:06:08] will
[1:06:09] endure hallelujah the love of god will
[1:06:13] endure you see people when they think of
[1:06:15] the love of god they think of love of
[1:06:17] god like the love of man
[1:06:20] that a man loves his wife or a man
[1:06:24] as a you know he loves his brother he
[1:06:26] loves his family or something like that
[1:06:28] but that's human love
[1:06:30] but the love of god is love but a
[1:06:32] different kind of love right but because
[1:06:36] you only see love from one perspective
[1:06:38] right you got to understand what love is
[1:06:42] john
[1:06:43] for god so
[1:06:45] loved the world
[1:06:47] that he gave his only begotten son
[1:06:50] is that right
[1:06:52] what is god's love to you then
[1:06:56] that he gave his word
[1:07:00] the revealed word
[1:07:02] is that right
[1:07:04] that is telling his bride how much he
[1:07:06] loved her
[1:07:07] among all these people among all these
[1:07:12] believers that believe the message
[1:07:14] prophet says remember
[1:07:16] the remnant will be is the same it's the
[1:07:19] same pattern they cut from he says this
[1:07:22] one is the same material
[1:07:25] amen it's not a different cloth
[1:07:27] but god elected you to be within that
[1:07:30] pattern
[1:07:31] and that is the love of god to you that
[1:07:34] he brought you in the pattern of the
[1:07:37] bride uh the bright class of saints amen
[1:07:41] that elected lady of the last day that
[1:07:45] he brought to him that's what this is
[1:07:47] all about i'm talking about the love of
[1:07:50] god hallelujah this love of god this
[1:07:54] fact that god has revealed his word to
[1:07:56] you
[1:07:57] not explained
[1:08:00] not informed
[1:08:02] not give you a religious education
[1:08:05] you know you know there's educational
[1:08:07] departments in the churches today
[1:08:09] to educate you into sunday school
[1:08:12] educate you religious education
[1:08:15] we're not talking about religious
[1:08:16] education
[1:08:17] this is not my religious education
[1:08:20] as you know it talks about that some old
[1:08:23] woman could be up in the woods somewhere
[1:08:24] there and all of a sudden she's reading
[1:08:26] her vibe all of a sudden she gets a
[1:08:28] flash of revelation on that word and the
[1:08:31] curtain is now torn
[1:08:34] and once that curtain is torn it begins
[1:08:36] to open up and you can walk into that
[1:08:39] holy of holies amen hallelujah and then
[1:08:43] you begin to see the glories of god
[1:08:45] within the word of god not by outside
[1:08:48] teacher
[1:08:50] right
[1:08:51] but by the inside tuition
[1:08:55] of the holy spirit
[1:08:56] teaching you the word of god hallelujah
[1:09:00] not that you don't respect outward
[1:09:02] teachers they're only your guides they
[1:09:04] will guide you to the water hole but you
[1:09:07] have to drink
[1:09:09] hallelujah
[1:09:12] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:09:14] lord amen
[1:09:16] friends
[1:09:17] jesus doesn't have a freak body
[1:09:21] he don't have no six fingers on one hand
[1:09:25] he only has five fingers on one hand
[1:09:30] hallelujah and the body of christ will
[1:09:33] never be some freak see
[1:09:36] and when the last person comes into this
[1:09:39] body of christ
[1:09:41] then it's all over
[1:09:44] right
[1:09:46] now
[1:09:47] i don't know which one
[1:09:49] this might have been the last one come
[1:09:52] in this morning
[1:09:54] you might have been the last one
[1:09:58] but
[1:09:59] maybe over in africa today somewhere
[1:10:02] the last one
[1:10:04] someday
[1:10:05] will be brought in
[1:10:07] but when that last one
[1:10:10] is done
[1:10:11] you may go ahead doing all your
[1:10:14] preaching preach the gospel
[1:10:18] that's all right but at that time
[1:10:22] there will be no response to it
[1:10:26] see what i'm telling you
[1:10:28] you will preach the same gospel
[1:10:32] amen
[1:10:34] but see
[1:10:35] there is no response
[1:10:38] whatsoever praise god god keeps his word
[1:10:42] friends you see where we're at now i
[1:10:44] thought last week i was telling you that

[1:11:33] word it it will speak out but i say he

[1:11:40] wrong with them you remember that i told
[1:11:43] you how the holy spirit told me that
[1:11:46] night when i talked with him and said if
[1:11:49] you will be sincere and will come to
[1:11:52] that place i will let show you even the
[1:11:54] secret of their hearts hallelujah but
[1:11:57] then he said if you will then continue
[1:12:00] to be sincere and humble
[1:12:03] i will make it grow
[1:12:05] greater and greater
[1:12:08] and greater
[1:12:10] and now
[1:12:11] this ministry hallelujah
[1:12:14] is going to step now higher into another
[1:12:18] realm
[1:12:19] where it'll be far beyond what it ever
[1:12:23] was amen i don't know just what it is
[1:12:26] yet but i'm warned of the holy spirit to
[1:12:30] go quickly now close off all the rest of
[1:12:33] my meetings that i've been having see
[1:12:36] because when i come out again
[1:12:39] it will be a new ministry the minister
[1:12:42] this ministry of course will never cease
[1:12:46] but this one will continue on
[1:12:50] this will continue on it will just be
[1:12:54] the same but this new ministry will
[1:12:57] continue on in other words the message
[1:12:59] will continue on that's okay but this
[1:13:02] ram that is going into this one octave
[1:13:05] higher that he is breaking into
[1:13:07] that my friends that one is going to
[1:13:10] continue right on to the very end of
[1:13:14] time oh thanks be to god hallelujah i'm
[1:13:17] so glad friends that after jesus
[1:13:21] 40 days with his disciples ministering
[1:13:24] to them that he decided it's time for
[1:13:26] him to ascend and go into the presence
[1:13:30] of the father reading that's from living
[1:13:33] dying
[1:13:35] buried rising coming
[1:13:38] 1959
[1:13:39] now i'm quoting from another place
[1:13:42] simeon
[1:13:43] read in the scriptures where there was
[1:13:45] coming a messiah amen he was reading the
[1:13:49] scripture
[1:13:50] he didn't care about prestige when he
[1:13:52] began to tell them people about that
[1:13:55] scripture
[1:13:56] you see
[1:13:58] he knew he was going to live to see the
[1:14:00] messiah
[1:14:02] so he wasn't ashamed praise god are you
[1:14:05] ashamed to talk about the rapture
[1:14:07] are you ashamed to talk that you're
[1:14:09] going to be caught up
[1:14:10] are you going to be ashamed to tell
[1:14:12] people that you're going to be caught
[1:14:13] into the presence of god sudden secret
[1:14:16] catching away the bride of jesus christ
[1:14:18] this is what he's talking about here in
[1:14:20] parables
[1:14:22] was that right oh my see he didn't care
[1:14:25] about prestige when he was talking about
[1:14:27] that all right of course you know there
[1:14:31] were what the world would have thought
[1:14:32] about that they would have taught that
[1:14:34] old man's gone insane he's off a little
[1:14:37] bit in his head his mind is slowly
[1:14:40] leaving him and it be said you see
[1:14:44] friends remember
[1:14:46] that will also be said about you
[1:14:51] when people begin to take this word and
[1:14:56] begin to believe that promise with all
[1:14:59] their heart
[1:15:00] it will become so supernatural in them
[1:15:04] till people of the people of the world
[1:15:08] they will seem to them like they are
[1:15:11] crazy
[1:15:13] and you did use the word crazy you're
[1:15:15] gonna seem to be crazy
[1:15:17] first of all what god you're talking
[1:15:19] about what do you mean when you say god
[1:15:21] you talk about rapture leaving this
[1:15:24] place here
[1:15:25] you see because remember god is so much
[1:15:28] greater his promises his power and his
[1:15:30] being is so much greater and his
[1:15:33] expectations of us is so much higher
[1:15:37] than the things of the world
[1:15:39] till to them
[1:15:41] because we are living according to his
[1:15:43] word and his expectation
[1:15:46] but the world is seeing it from the way
[1:15:49] the world is acting on what they're
[1:15:51] doing
[1:15:52] and because we live according to this
[1:15:55] higher expectation of him
[1:15:58] you see
[1:15:59] he says according to the scripture all
[1:16:02] that live godly in christ jesus
[1:16:05] shall suffer persecutions but blessed
[1:16:08] are you when you are persecuted amen
[1:16:12] hallelujah oh thank god i'm so glad that
[1:16:14] when you receive this word you become an
[1:16:16] eagle
[1:16:18] you realize that
[1:16:19] you are of an eagle spirit praise god we
[1:16:22] don't need but quickly you know we all
[1:16:25] come from the great logos god himself
[1:16:28] and that's why god was showing the
[1:16:31] little licks of fire on the head of the
[1:16:33] apostles
[1:16:34] to show that he allowed each one of them
[1:16:38] a part of himself
[1:16:41] in them
[1:16:42] and this is what the message is doing
[1:16:46] now not by a big carrying on in the top
[1:16:48] of an upper room amen praise god and i
[1:16:52] can see how the crowds would gather
[1:16:53] because i was there in israel and it's
[1:16:56] easy when we got you were there at the
[1:16:58] top of the stairs
[1:17:00] if people started keeping noise a lot of
[1:17:02] people are passing they would all want
[1:17:04] to know what in the world is going on
[1:17:06] amen see but here it is my friends he
[1:17:10] says but today you know what will be
[1:17:13] uh if you're an eagle you get tired of
[1:17:17] listening to them squirrels
[1:17:19] chattering chattering chattering
[1:17:22] chattering all the time i know this i
[1:17:23] know that i the bible says this the
[1:17:25] bible says that prophet said this they
[1:17:27] even want to bury you as one man i heard
[1:17:30] one man tell another well i'll bury you
[1:17:31] with coats
[1:17:33] if you
[1:17:34] you don't know what you're talking about
[1:17:36] i'll bury you
[1:17:38] with quotes everything like that see but
[1:17:40] you said you get so tired of listening
[1:17:43] to that squirrel
[1:17:44] and some of them squirrels and this is
[1:17:46] not me he's saying it here they even
[1:17:49] curse you
[1:17:52] chatter chatter chatter chatter chatter
[1:17:54] chatter chatter chatter
[1:17:56] he just looked over amen now that eliza
[1:18:00] just looked over sideways at that
[1:18:03] squirrel
[1:18:04] and he got so annoyed with him
[1:18:07] the only thing that he could do
[1:18:10] is give a big jump
[1:18:12] right and flop his wings twice
[1:18:15] and then set his sails his wings and
[1:18:19] rise up in the wind oh praise god isn't
[1:18:23] that what we have to do
[1:18:25] listening to all this chatter all around
[1:18:27] everybody knows praise god everybody has
[1:18:30] revelation
[1:18:31] do you know that
[1:18:33] now we're preaching revelation we're
[1:18:34] talking a lot about revelation all of a
[1:18:36] sudden everybody's got revelation but
[1:18:38] they don't know what revelation
[1:18:40] is but anybody can say they have
[1:18:42] revelation is that right
[1:18:45] but then when you talk to them on the
[1:18:46] word or listen to the things they're
[1:18:48] saying you know they're completely off
[1:18:51] is that right praise god hallelujah it's
[1:18:54] just like some false person writing my
[1:18:57] wife a letter
[1:18:58] the moment she gets that letter and
[1:19:00] begin to read it she'll know definitely
[1:19:02] that's a fake
[1:19:04] because that's not the way i write
[1:19:06] that's not the way i talk that's not the
[1:19:08] way i say things amen that's that's
[1:19:11] somebody else trying to take my words
[1:19:14] and now trying to make them sound like
[1:19:16] if it's me but but then the person that
[1:19:19] has a personal private relationship with
[1:19:22] him they know it's not him they know
[1:19:25] that's you talking there amen praise god
[1:19:28] so we look on the word keep your eyes on
[1:19:31] the word and let the world take control
[1:19:34] over your senses
[1:19:36] preeminence
[1:19:38] the preeminence of christ takes control
[1:19:41] over the senses of man hallelujah
[1:19:44] amen
[1:19:46] see
[1:19:47] he got so tired of all the chatter
[1:19:49] chatter chatter amen
[1:19:52] looking looking back talking about days
[1:19:55] of miracles is past amen hallelujah all
[1:19:59] we can talk about brother i remember i
[1:20:03] was in this meeting with brother branham
[1:20:05] and this happened and that and that's
[1:20:07] wonderful
[1:20:09] but that's not where this is at now it's
[1:20:11] gone much higher than that we're no more
[1:20:13] back in this meeting and that meeting
[1:20:15] and this miracle happened and he called
[1:20:17] out this person by their name but the
[1:20:19] holy spirit is trying to call you now by
[1:20:21] your name

[1:20:49] them chattering all the time set your
[1:20:51] wings in the power of god and let the
[1:20:54] holy spirit rise you up above it all go
[1:20:58] on what break through the sound barrier

[1:24:37] the lord you've got to understand
[1:24:39] brother the thing has switched
[1:24:43] amen
[1:24:44] and now it's speaking of the word
[1:24:47] and it's so much that even when i say
[1:24:49] that you can be cast off because you
[1:24:51] think might be speaking the bible
[1:24:54] it can be mean just speaking the message
[1:24:57] but it's not that
[1:24:58] the logos word is not the written word
[1:25:02] it's the it's the unwritten word it's he
[1:25:05] himself because god is not the writing
[1:25:07] on the page
[1:25:09] god is the being that's rides on the
[1:25:12] world
[1:25:15] you're right he says you're looking at
[1:25:16] the tv he says you know all those
[1:25:18] pictures and everything comes he says
[1:25:20] you know those demon spirits ride on
[1:25:23] those pictures and those images right
[1:25:25] into your mind
[1:25:27] right well i'm just telling you in the
[1:25:29] same way the holy spirit rides on the
[1:25:32] white horse of the word of god into your
[1:25:34] soul amen
[1:25:36] amen he rides into your soul praise god
[1:25:40] by the word of god hallelujah and the
[1:25:42] discernment is leaving and now i'm
[1:25:45] stepping into a higher ministry
[1:25:48] just preaching
[1:25:50] just talking the word
[1:25:52] just sharing
[1:25:53] with people
[1:25:54] is that all
[1:25:55] uh but simon i'm not saying any speaking
[1:25:57] in terms but simon i don't feel i'm
[1:26:00] growing because i i don't feel i'm
[1:26:02] commanding any demons
[1:26:04] well judas cast out devils and jesus
[1:26:07] turned around and
[1:26:09] and he heard every sermon jesus ever
[1:26:11] preached
[1:26:12] and he still wasn't converted
[1:26:15] is that right
[1:26:16] and then jesus said depart from me you
[1:26:19] workers of iniquity
[1:26:21] is that right
[1:26:22] oh my you can have all those things but
[1:26:25] it's gone past that
[1:26:27] you see and it's gone into another realm
[1:26:29] that's why he says god hides in
[1:26:31] simplicity
[1:26:33] and he manifests himself in the same
[1:26:36] so don't feel oh i don't know the
[1:26:38] message all i can tell the people is is
[1:26:41] about the prophet and jesus and this and
[1:26:43] that well god will take you higher and
[1:26:45] higher once you're sincere and you hold
[1:26:47] to his word and believe his promise
[1:26:49] he'll take you right through don't judge
[1:26:51] yourself and say oh i i'm not strong in
[1:26:54] a message i don't know it like brother
[1:26:56] so and so i don't know what it likes is
[1:26:58] you know what god didn't ask you to know
[1:26:59] anything he asked you do you believe
[1:27:03] do you know this no you didn't ask them
[1:27:06] that he said do you believe
[1:27:09] so if you believe the rest will he'll
[1:27:11] bring the rest when he wants to you
[1:27:13] another place brother branham said and
[1:27:15] there will know when it is time for them
[1:27:18] to know
[1:27:20] right

[1:44:38] and cars that had some tires that look
[1:44:40] like bicycle wheels and everything else
[1:44:43] but listen to him
[1:44:44] out of the countdown
[1:44:46] you see everything is going higher the
[1:44:50] automobile was a higher
[1:44:52] form of transportation
[1:44:55] then the horse
[1:44:56] came was a higher form the horse was a
[1:44:59] higher form of transportation
[1:45:01] than the bicycle the automobile was a
[1:45:04] higher form of transportation then the
[1:45:06] airplane came that was a higher form of
[1:45:10] transportation
[1:45:12] but they all accompanied one another see
[1:45:16] oh
[1:45:16] see they were using horsepower but now
[1:45:20] we are here with god's power
[1:45:23] the holy ghost power
[1:45:25] the holy ghost is the one see
[1:45:28] they were natural scientists by
[1:45:31] education but now comes god's spiritual
[1:45:35] scientist
[1:45:37] hallelujah they believe god's word man
[1:45:41] did that by
[1:45:42] education amen it means going into space
[1:45:46] by education right the natural science
[1:45:49] and natural scientists but the spiritual
[1:45:53] scientist is doing it by revelation
[1:45:56] praise god one by education the other by
[1:45:59] revelation do you believe it
[1:46:02] praise god simpson he says blessed art
[1:46:05] now simon uh jonas peter you remember he
[1:46:09] says it he said flesh and blood has not
[1:46:11] revealed this to you but my father in
[1:46:13] heaven has revealed this unto you upon
[1:46:15] this rock i'll build my church and the
[1:46:18] gates of hell will not prevail against
[1:46:21] it amen praise god remember
[1:46:25] it's no more talking about holy church
[1:46:30] there is no somebody may say i'm
[1:46:32] criticizing no right i'm criticizing
[1:46:35] church and churches and all this kind of
[1:46:37] stuff but a real preacher
[1:46:39] as b brings judgment
[1:46:42] and he has to be a critic by the word
[1:46:45] if he uses his emotion to be a critic
[1:46:47] then he's guilty but he's got to go by
[1:46:50] the word there's no such thing as any
[1:46:52] holy church
[1:46:54] there is no holy organization whatsoever
[1:46:58] see the holy spirit may even be preached
[1:47:01] in it
[1:47:02] but in there you'll still find good
[1:47:05] and bad
[1:47:07] and ugly
[1:47:15] the good the bad and the ugly
[1:47:18] right in the chair
[1:47:22] he says they're renegades
[1:47:24] you'll find them in there
[1:47:26] indifferent ones and everything else
[1:47:29] so
[1:47:30] organization will not hold
[1:47:33] you can't i got it none of the rest of
[1:47:35] them has it no sir you see as an
[1:47:38] organization as a group no you can't say
[1:47:41] that the holy spirit is only poured out
[1:47:45] upon
[1:47:47] individuals
[1:47:49] praise god you see individuals and that
[1:47:52] is why i say that even this tabernacle
[1:47:56] is not a holy ghost tabernacle
[1:48:00] you see there is no such a thing
[1:48:03] as a holy church
[1:48:05] the individuals that come into this
[1:48:08] church
[1:48:09] them is the holy ghost tabernacles
[1:48:13] see they are tabernacles that contain
[1:48:16] the holy ghost
[1:48:18] but not the church
[1:48:21] the church the building the group that's
[1:48:24] not in the body it's them whom the holy
[1:48:27] ghost tabernacles in them hallelujah
[1:48:30] that's where it is amen praise god
[1:48:34] hallelujah oh praise god oh my glory to
[1:48:37] god i can't say it like brother branham
[1:48:40] amen it's not two o'clock so don't look
[1:48:42] around
[1:48:43] but
[1:48:44] at that time he said see
[1:48:46] look at the clock
[1:48:48] it's two o'clock
[1:48:51] the spirit of god takes the same song
[1:48:54] we've always seen
[1:48:55] picking it up but now he's taking it
[1:48:58] into a hierarchy do you get the gist of
[1:49:00] this message
[1:49:03] he's taking the very word
[1:49:06] not making something
[1:49:08] extraordinary something no
[1:49:10] no but he's taking it into a higher
[1:49:13] dimension
[1:49:14] right he's taking you into the perfect
[1:49:17] world
[1:49:18] come up higher praise god into the word
[1:49:21] of god come up hither he says
[1:49:26] it's later than you think come out of
[1:49:28] the mud
[1:49:30] come up into a higher life
[1:49:33] come up
[1:49:34] pull away from that what is it you're
[1:49:37] done in a mud all you little flowers
[1:49:40] you've got a life
[1:49:42] buried within you
[1:49:44] and that life in you is pressing you
[1:49:47] is pushing you and that's what is
[1:49:50] calling you and it's calling come up out
[1:49:53] of the mud amen praise god that's out of
[1:49:56] the message how can i overcome yes
[1:49:58] friends the holy spirit calling us to
[1:50:01] come up here though amen do you know the
[1:50:04] messenger was to bring the word every
[1:50:07] messenger to every church age
[1:50:09] how many knows that he's the angel to
[1:50:11] the age but now he is speaking here now
[1:50:15] i don't know all these things how i'm
[1:50:18] all these years and the message
[1:50:21] and now i'm finding these little stakes
[1:50:24] and
[1:50:25] praise god
[1:50:28] what do you think really was each
[1:50:31] messenger what was martin luther
[1:50:34] the messenger was not just to
[1:50:36] speak bring the word
[1:50:38] but the messenger was there to rebuke
[1:50:42] that catholic church
[1:50:45] what was wrestling
[1:50:47] he was a rebuke
[1:50:49] to the lutherans
[1:50:51] what was pentecost now we don't say him
[1:50:55] he doesn't mention himself because he is
[1:50:57] the messenger of the pentecostal church
[1:50:59] ace which is the ledecian church age he
[1:51:01] said
[1:51:02] he is a rebuke to them
[1:51:06] but where has the life gone when it left
[1:51:09] there
[1:51:13] where has it gone
[1:51:16] it's gone from them group and
[1:51:18] organization
[1:51:20] the thing is no more a shock
[1:51:24] it's gone to the grain
[1:51:27] what is that
[1:51:28] it is a rebuke to pentecost to fulfill
[1:51:32] the scriptures of this hour
[1:51:35] notice
[1:51:36] not when the messenger of the age starts
[1:51:40] out
[1:51:41] but when he begins to declare the
[1:51:44] message
[1:51:45] the word amen the forceful healing
[1:51:48] second paul prophesying but under that
[1:51:51] third poll comes the opening of the word
[1:51:56] when he begins to declare that the
[1:51:58] mysteries are then revealed
[1:52:01] and there is no higher order than that
[1:52:05] than to reveal the word no matter what
[1:52:08] hallelujah no higher order than the
[1:52:12] revealing of the word remember the third
[1:52:15] pull was the opening of them seven seals
[1:52:18] to reveal the hidden truth that's been
[1:52:21] sealed in the word i know you're getting
[1:52:24] a little tired now
[1:52:26] i know
[1:52:27] that you're ready to go home and have
[1:52:30] your wonderful supper
[1:52:32] but praise god that one will last you
[1:52:35] for about two hours and you'll be hungry
[1:52:37] again
[1:52:40] but this one will take you right to
[1:52:42] eternity
[1:52:44] amen
[1:52:47] [Applause]
[1:52:49] i'll be finished shortly anyway praise
[1:52:51] god hallelujah amen
[1:52:54] oh my
[1:52:56] think about it nor enter into the ark i
[1:52:59] want you to notice
[1:53:01] it was not noah that shut the door
[1:53:05] from them people
[1:53:07] it was god himself that shut the
[1:53:10] door see
[1:53:12] oh my
[1:53:14] see
[1:53:14] oh the clouds they doubted and doubted
[1:53:18] but when them rains began to fall and
[1:53:20] the sewers began to back up and the
[1:53:23] fountains of the deep broke up when that
[1:53:26] begin to happen the spree springs
[1:53:28] belching forth their waters people began
[1:53:31] to climb under the roofs of their houses
[1:53:34] you see
[1:53:35] the old arc set the same
[1:53:38] but after a while
[1:53:40] when enough began to get around the ark
[1:53:43] the ark began to rise hallelujah this
[1:53:46] word that they're doubting doubting
[1:53:48] doubting the evil outside
[1:53:52] is going to rise to such a height
[1:53:56] and because the word had your hearts
[1:53:58] your lies your soul prepared
[1:54:01] that evil god is going to use it to turn
[1:54:03] and lift
[1:54:04] lift the ark
[1:54:06] higher he says the people knocked on the
[1:54:09] windows they batted at the doors they
[1:54:11] screamed but it did them no good at that
[1:54:15] time
[1:54:16] even no he repeats again
[1:54:19] could not open that door
[1:54:22] god himself had closed it
[1:54:26] god's the only one
[1:54:28] that can open it
[1:54:30] so is it today
[1:54:32] for our ark
[1:54:34] is jesus christ the word
[1:54:37] and god has opened the door for us
[1:54:41] aren't you glad he opened the door for
[1:54:43] us to enter in
[1:54:44] amen
[1:54:46] and
[1:54:47] he'll close it as surely as he opened it
[1:54:50] for us
[1:54:51] he'll close it for others praise the
[1:54:54] lord
[1:54:55] isn't that something
[1:54:57] my goodness i thank god for his grace
[1:55:00] that i'm in the car i'm in the rocket

[1:55:08] shining
[1:55:09] the lights that is shining in the eyes
[1:55:11] of the people in the darkness blinds
[1:55:13] them
[1:55:15] but it makes you see where you're going

[1:55:34] more that could be said
[1:55:36] but there's enough said here that can
[1:55:38] fertilize and irrigate the minds of
[1:55:40] preachers and people who are thinking on
[1:55:43] the word that can expand on this and uh
[1:55:47] make it something even greater and a
[1:55:49] greater blessing to god's people god
