[20:36] amen so tonight we're going to continue
[20:38] along um with the series that we've been
[20:41] uh looking at it's uh part of the
[20:43] rapturing faith series seeing my part in
[20:46] the word of God and tonight we're just
[20:49] going to look at an aspect uh we're
[20:51] going to title it in Heavenly places and
[20:54] we're going to look at um this aspect of
[20:57] our position in Christ and how it is
[21:00] that we are now moving in this realm of
[21:04] faith that has given us perfect Faith to
[21:07] receive everything that we have need of
[21:09] in this hour to overcome all that lays
[21:12] before us amen praise God Ephesians
[21:15] chapter 1 we can go to the first
[21:18] slide before we do let's pray
[21:22] father we so appreciate Lord this
[21:25] opportunity tonight to fellowship with
[21:27] you
[21:28] Lord to allow your word to move into our
[21:32] hearts and our lives and search and and
[21:36] uh dig up the things Lord that we want
[21:39] to let go father because this is
[21:42] certainly a time for the church to let
[21:45] go and leave all the old baggage behind
[21:48] father because we have a journey before
[21:50] us oh God that is beyond human
[21:54] understanding but yet your word said
[21:56] that we shall be changed changed and we
[21:59] shall be caught up together to meet you
[22:02] in the air Lord and so tonight we ask
[22:05] that we can move in that realm Lord
[22:06] where you can come and just uh speak to
[22:09] our needs Lord uh we just so appreciate
[22:12] and love you and uh Lord we can't do
[22:16] anything um greater you've already done
[22:19] the greatest in our lives for giving us
[22:23] faith and allowing us to see this
[22:26] message of the hour and sending us a
[22:28] prophet and giving us such uh grace and
[22:31] mercy oh God that we can keep pressing
[22:33] on Lord bless your people oh God anoint
[22:36] the speaker anoint the hearer tonight
[22:38] Lord we just completely surrender
[22:40] ourselves to you for service now in
[22:43] Jesus Christ name amen praise God
[22:46] Ephesians chap 1: 3-5 it says blessed be
[22:51] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[22:54] Christ who hath blessed us with all
[22:58] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[23:02] in
[23:03] Christ according as he hath chosen Us in
[23:07] him before the foundations of the world
[23:11] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[23:14] before him in love having predestinated
[23:17] us unto the adoption of children by
[23:20] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[23:25] good pleasure of his will praise God you
[23:28] may be
[23:31] seated amen praise God we've been
[23:33] looking at uh seeing our our part in the
[23:36] word of God and you know the last uh
[23:39] service we were looking um we were
[23:41] looking at uh uh the book of Corinthians
[23:44] and how the Lord um has identified that
[23:48] we are each uh part of the body in
[23:52] particular we all have a unique placing
[23:55] within the word of God we all have a
[23:57] place that God is uh uh giving us uh
[24:01] Faith because we've all got a portion of
[24:04] Faith to fulfill the purpose and the
[24:07] plan of God in our personal lives and so
[24:11] God is calling each and every son and
[24:14] daughter of God into their place now
[24:16] he's calling us into uh into place uh to
[24:20] the attention of the word for this day
[24:22] and this hour and what it is that he
[24:24] wants to fulfill and we know that the
[24:27] great plan and the fullness of the plan
[24:30] is the rapture for the church now the
[24:33] next major event is the rapture of the
[24:36] church and we can see by the events that
[24:39] are going on in the world and the
[24:42] conditions we know that before the world
[24:46] goes into Absolute Total Chaos and
[24:49] tribulation the bride goes up in the
[24:53] Rapture and so we read in Ephesians
[24:56] where it talks about that that um that
[24:59] God is right now perfecting Ephesians
[25:02] chapter 4 through the five-fold ministry
[25:05] God is perfecting the Saints and
[25:08] bringing us into the fullness of Christ
[25:12] what does it mean to come into the
[25:13] fullness of Christ it is to actually
[25:16] come each and everyone in their
[25:20] position into a revelation that the body
[25:23] of Christ is now present on the earth
[25:27] com coming into its
[25:29] fullness through the unity of the
[25:32] revelation of the word amen and once
[25:35] this this body comes into the fullness
[25:38] of Christ which is Christ like we heard
[25:41] on Sunday uh Adam and Eve they were they
[25:46] they they were one they were of the same
[25:48] substance when God created Adam called
[25:51] their name Adam Eve was actually Jesus
[25:57] Christ but she would just expressed in
[25:59] in female form God was expressing his
[26:03] female aspect his female attribute
[26:06] through Eve amen praise God and so as we
[26:10] come into the fullness of Christ in this
[26:13] day then the bride Eve has to come to
[26:17] her rightful position in Christ we just
[26:21] read the scripture that that the all the
[26:24] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[26:27] are in Christ we've been given this
[26:31] position next slide listen to brother
[26:33] brandom he says Heavenly
[26:36] places oh how I wish I had time here
[26:39] I've got it marked right here in my
[26:42] Bible about Heavenly places what is
[26:45] Heavenly places Heavenly places just for
[26:48] a moment is the believer's position in
[26:53] Christ where the believer stands in
[26:56] Christ in Heavenly places praise God so
[27:01] it's in Christ that we come into our
[27:05] fullness so that the body can come into
[27:08] its perfect revelation of the unity of
[27:11] Christ and when that takes place we get
[27:16] translated but a lot of people are
[27:18] putting that that uh fullness of Christ
[27:22] and that Unity of Christ they're putting
[27:24] it somewhere into the future I want to
[27:28] say tonight that we're in Heavenly
[27:30] places right now that we're in Christ
[27:34] right now we need to come into that
[27:37] revelation of who we are right now we
[27:41] can't be putting it into a future event
[27:44] you see that's the problem everybody's
[27:46] always praising God for what he's going
[27:48] to do and they're praising God for what
[27:50] he's done but they fail to recognize
[27:53] what it is that he's doing right now
[27:56] let's go to the next slide
[27:58] in the book of
[28:00] Philippians it talks
[28:03] about now keep it in mind that that
[28:05] we're we're talking about coming into
[28:07] the unity of the faith and coming into
[28:10] the fullness of Christ okay but we need
[28:13] to realize that in that position there's
[28:16] a lot of
[28:18] benefits and we as Sons and Daughters of
[28:21] God you know a lot of us are because
[28:23] we're putting it off into a future event
[28:27] or past event we're missing the
[28:29] authority that God has given us now as
[28:32] Sons and Daughters of God to fulfill the
[28:35] word of God and to do the things that he
[28:38] wants us to accomplish in this day
[28:40] listen here he says let this mind be in
[28:44] you which was also in Christ Jesus who
[28:48] being in the form of God thought it not
[28:53] robbery to be equal with God listen
[28:58] Jesus Christ let's get this straight
[29:01] okay because that's one thing that
[29:04] 95% of the denominational Christian
[29:07] teaching out there believes in the
[29:09] trinitarian doctrine we need to make
[29:12] that one thing straight right here right
[29:15] now Jesus Christ is
[29:19] God Jesus Christ Jehovah of the Old
[29:23] Testament is Jesus of the New Testament
[29:26] unless you have a revelation of who God
[29:29] is there is no way that you can
[29:32] rightfully take your position and have
[29:35] the authority as a son or a daughter of
[29:38] God in this day and in this hour and you
[29:41] will be living a a an underprivileged
[29:44] life you will find yourself in a
[29:46] defeated condition you'll find yourself
[29:49] uh you know that that when you come into
[29:52] an emergency you're crying out to God or
[29:55] or or a situation comes up you're you're
[29:57] crying out to God and you're and you're
[29:59] and you're pleading for God to to to
[30:02] heal or to change the situation when
[30:06] he's telling us that we are joint HS in
[30:09] Christ that we are actually in the body
[30:12] in Heavenly places right now and you've
[30:15] got the authority right now and that
[30:18] when you when you approach Jesus Christ
[30:21] in prayer you should be approaching from
[30:23] the aspect of a relationship that you've
[30:26] got a personal relationship with him and
[30:29] that and that you you're you're seated
[30:32] together and that he can be pleased with
[30:34] your character listen he says thought it
[30:38] not uh being in the form of God thought
[30:40] it not robbery to be equal with God but
[30:43] made himself of no reputation and took
[30:47] upon him the form of a servant and was
[30:50] made in the likeness of men
[30:54] listen we need to also stay Bal balanced
[30:58] we are attributes of God we are Sons and
[31:01] Daughters of God but yet we're still
[31:04] only human and so we need to recognize
[31:08] that element but by faith and by
[31:12] Revelation and knowing that we're still
[31:14] in this world we still got to overcome
[31:16] we still got to deal with you know self
[31:19] and pride and all the things that this
[31:22] that this human uh vessel will try to
[31:26] you know uh um exalt itself and make
[31:28] itself something you know because that's
[31:31] the world that we're living in now that
[31:32] you know everybody wants to be somebody
[31:34] everybody wants to be known everybody
[31:36] wants to be the you the top dog but
[31:40] that's not the way he came and that's
[31:43] not the way he's going to leave it's
[31:45] going to be so humble and so simple that
[31:47] when the Rapture goes most of the world
[31:50] 95% of it is going to actually miss
[31:55] it what a Time
[31:58] and being found in the fashion as a man
[32:02] he humbled himself and became obedient
[32:05] unto death even the death of the Cross
[32:10] everything that was
[32:12] required has been
[32:14] paid everything wherefore God also hath
[32:18] highly exalted him he's talking about
[32:21] Jesus Christ now now this is where we
[32:24] need to pay attention and giving him a
[32:27] name which is above every
[32:29] name that is at the name of Jesus every
[32:34] knee should bow of things in
[32:37] heaven and things in Earth and things
[32:41] under the Earth and that every tongue
[32:43] should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[32:47] to the glory of God the Father
[32:51] Hallelujah he has placed his body he has
[32:56] placed Jesus Christ in Heavenly places
[33:00] above every Power every Dominion there
[33:03] is no other name whereby man must be
[33:07] saved it's as simple as that and that's
[33:11] why there's no other religion but
[33:14] Christianity that is going to produce
[33:18] salvation everything else goes into the
[33:21] tribulation everything else goes into
[33:23] the a the the other aspects of the
[33:26] Fulfillment of the scripture whether
[33:28] it's the tribulation or whether it's
[33:30] Israel the 144,000 Moses and Elijah all
[33:34] of those things but right now what we're
[33:37] looking at is our
[33:39] position and the importance of us
[33:42] knowing where we stand in the authority
[33:45] that God has given us in our position
[33:49] listen it says here note in the verses
[33:52] that we just read or actually we're
[33:54] going to read the

[34:02] Ephesians 1:1 19-23 next
[34:07] slide right and what is the exceeding
[34:11] greatness of his power to us to us word
[34:15] who believe according to the working of
[34:17] his mighty power which he wrought in
[34:20] Christ when he raised him from the dead
[34:23] and set him at his own right hand in the
[34:27] Heavenly
[34:28] places when Jesus went to the
[34:31] Cross everything was fulfilled he said
[34:35] it is finished so there's no more
[34:38] sacrifice required there's no more
[34:41] sacrificial Lambs required not for the
[34:43] Gentile church not for anybody that come
[34:47] into the realization that Messiah has
[34:50] already come fulfilled the purpose and
[34:52] the plan and has given us full
[34:56] Redemption
[34:58] everything that was required has been
[35:01] completed and we need to only recognize
[35:04] that once we are in Christ then
[35:08] we are fulfilled listen here what it
[35:11] says uh in verse
[35:14] 21 far above all
[35:17] principality and power and might and
[35:21] dominion and every name that is named
[35:24] not only in this world but also in that
[35:28] which is to come and hath put all things
[35:32] under his feet and gave him to be the
[35:36] head over all things to the
[35:39] church which
[35:41] is his body the fullness of him that
[35:46] filth all in all Hallelujah so where are
[35:51] you where where are you situated tonight
[35:55] as a son or a daughter of of God if

[36:21] the body of Christ you're actually
[36:25] completing the body of Christ Christ and
[36:28] as the body is complete it comes into
[36:31] its fullness and when it comes into its
[36:34] fullness which it already is because it
[36:37] was a finished work in Jesus Christ then
[36:41] all authority and power is given to the
[36:44] body of Christ and if you're in the body
[36:47] you've got that Authority you've got
[36:49] that power amen praise God glory to God

[37:06] of sickness and and oppression and
[37:09] depression and what whatever Spirit

[38:25] position as a son or a daughter of God
[38:28] Amen far above every Power what is your

[38:35] Christ so you need to ask yourself like
[38:40] don't just say oh I'm a Christian we're
[38:43] way ahead of that we're Way Beyond that
[38:45] Saints everybody's claiming to to you
[38:48] know there's so many people claiming to
[38:50] be Christians out there but God is going
[38:53] to vindicate and and truly show what
[38:56] what what it is to be a Christian in
[38:58] this day and in this hour and you need
[39:00] to be in
[39:01] Christ Hallelujah listen what he says
[39:04] and you hath he quickened who were dead
[39:08] in
[39:10] trespasses go to the next
[39:13] slide and
[39:15] sins wherein in time past you walked
[39:18] according to the course of this world
[39:21] according to the prince of the power of
[39:23] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[39:26] the children of
[39:28] Disobedience that spirit is so powerful
[39:31] in this day and in this hour Saints the
[39:33] spirit of Disobedience it does not want
[39:36] to submit to the spirit of God it does
[39:40] not want to submit to the word of God
[39:42] Amen it doesn't want to accept that God
[39:45] sent us a 20th century Prophet it
[39:48] doesn't want to Humble itself it wants
[39:51] to exalt man it wants to exalt their
[39:54] teaching man's man's uh intellect you
[39:57] know but because of the doctrines of man
[40:00] like Jesus when he came up against the
[40:02] Pharisees he says because of your
[40:04] traditions because of your teachings
[40:06] you've made the word of God of none
[40:09] effect to the people to the point where
[40:11] they rebel against the word when the
[40:13] word is presented to
[40:16] them but he says here where in in time
[40:19] past you walked in that same fashion you
[40:22] were under that same uh influence of the
[40:26] of the power of the air the spirit that
[40:28] now worketh in the children of
[40:30] Disobedience among whom also we all had
[40:33] our conversation in times past in the
[40:36] lusts of our flesh fulfilling the
[40:38] desires of the Flesh and of the mind and
[40:41] were by Nature the children of Wrath
[40:45] even as
[40:47] others but
[40:49] God who is rich in Mercy Hallelujah for
[40:54] his great love wherewith with he loved
[40:58] us even when we were dead in sins hath
[41:02] quickened us together with Christ by
[41:06] grace are you
[41:09] saved you see that's you know Paul put
[41:12] that right in there by grace are you
[41:15] saved not to exalt and to think that you
[41:19] deserve this you didn't deserve it it's
[41:23] because you were with him before for the
[41:26] foundations of the world you were in his
[41:29] thoughts you were expressed into this
[41:31] into this age you were the last age
[41:35] thoughts attributes that God had to call
[41:38] in this day and in this season and and
[41:41] it's Saints it's just it's just Grace
[41:44] it's just Amazing Grace you didn't do
[41:46] anything to deserve it I think back and
[41:48] I say Lord how in the world did did I
[41:52] you know have this this grace that would
[41:55] come into my life but you can't help but
[41:57] see the word of God the way you're
[41:59] seeing it you cannot deny the word of
[42:02] God you can't you can't deny that you
[42:04] see it clearly in the scripture when
[42:07] Jesus said I will send you the comforter
[42:10] and he will guide you into all truth and
[42:12] then you try to say to somebody you need
[42:14] the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost comes
[42:17] by obedience to the word of God it comes
[42:20] by by by you initially like listen you
[42:25] don't you don't earn the Holy Ghost you
[42:27] don't work you don't do Works to get the
[42:29] Holy Ghost it's something that you were
[42:32] from before the foundations of the world
[42:34] but when the word comes to you it
[42:37] awakens that attribute within you it
[42:40] awakens so it allows your you know it
[42:42] it's hard to to put words to it but but
[42:45] it's a divine revelation to where your
[42:48] conscious mind and the mind of God
[42:52] connect and the mind of God is that
[42:54] attribute that you are are remember you
[42:58] are a part in the fullness of Christ
[43:01] you're in the body of Christ that means
[43:04] you are a portion of God you are
[43:08] literally a portion of God and so all
[43:11] that happened while you were in this
[43:12] human vessel is you came into a
[43:15] conscious understanding of your position
[43:18] as a Son of God as an attribute of God
[43:23] and that Enlightenment LED you into all
[43:26] truth all of a sudden you're you're able
[43:29] to recognize the truth you're able to
[43:31] see the eror you're able to see that God
[43:34] is not three in one God is one here ye
[43:38] oh Israel he made it clear to Israel
[43:40] that's why Israel one of the main things
[43:42] that Israel you know rejects the
[43:44] Gentiles is because of their trinitarian
[43:47] Doctrine because they believe in three
[43:50] in one no he said here he oh Israel the
[43:53] Lord is one and until that that
[43:56] foundation and that Clarity is in you as
[43:59] a son or a daughter of God you will be
[44:01] walking underprivileged you'll be
[44:04] walking you're not walking with
[44:07] Christ you're walking with man's
[44:09] tradition man's Doctrine man's teaching
[44:12] a church is teaching but you're not
[44:14] walking with
[44:16] Christ but God who is rich in Mercy for
[44:19] his great love wherewith he loved us
[44:22] even when we were dead in sins hath
[44:26] quickened us hath made us alive has
[44:29] quickened us has has uh uh moved us into
[44:33] Heavenly places quickened us together
[44:36] with Christ by grace are you saved and
[44:38] hath raised us up together and made us
[44:42] sit together in Heavenly places in
[44:47] Christ Jesus hallelujah praise God let's
[44:53] let's read this uh quote here brother
[44:54] brandom
[44:56] he says but the real ordained of God
[45:01] that real Gene that real germ a soul of
[45:06] God that was in God before the
[45:09] foundations of the world remember you
[45:11] that's really got the spirit of God in
[45:14] you tonight you were here in Christ
[45:17] because he was the fullness of the word
[45:22] he was the fullness of the godhead
[45:25] bodily
[45:26] God was in Christ do you hear that God
[45:31] Elohim the self-existent one the only
[45:35] one and true God was in
[45:39] Christ reconciling the world to who
[45:44] himself to himself so God was
[45:48] reconciling the world to himself he
[45:51] wasn't it wasn't another being or
[45:55] another person person or reconciling it
[45:57] to somebody else we just finished
[46:00] reading that Jesus Christ was exalted
[46:03] and placed at the right hand which is
[46:05] the power of God Amen look at when Jesus
[46:09] was speaking to Nicodemus he says you
[46:12] know like no man has has descended
[46:16] except he that has
[46:19] ascended he that has descended has
[46:21] ascended and he's he that's standing
[46:24] right here right now he's still there he
[46:26] was trying to explain things to
[46:27] Nicodemus who was already in a state of
[46:30] confusion that God was standing right
[46:33] there before him speaking to him but he
[46:35] could not recognize
[46:38] it
[46:40] Hallelujah he was the fullness of the
[46:42] godhead bodily God was in Christ
[46:44] reconciling the world to himself do you
[46:47] believe that look he was in Christ than
[46:50] if you were in God a gene a word an
[46:55] attribute from the beginning then you
[46:58] walked with him here on
[47:01] Earth you talked with him on Earth right
[47:06] now you're having fellowship with
[47:09] Jehovah Elohim the self-existent one in
[47:13] your life every single day that when you
[47:16] you know when you're when you're you got
[47:18] to get your relationship
[47:20] right when you're praying you're praying
[47:23] all day long if you're a son or a
[47:25] daughter of God prayer is communication
[47:28] with God that's what prayer is it's
[47:30] communing with God it's Walking with
[47:34] God but yes we do have moments and times
[47:38] where we go into prayer we pray for the
[47:40] sick occasions emergencies all those
[47:43] things but it's only still an expression
[47:47] of your
[47:48] relationship you're seated with him in
[47:51] Heavenly places you're seated above the
[47:54] principalities the power Powers the
[47:56] dominions the prince of the power of the
[47:58] air you're seated above all of that and
[48:02] you need to take your Authority in your
[48:04] position and speak the word of God not
[48:07] not in a way that that you're pleading
[48:10] and you're you're you're you're crying
[48:11] out and oh you have to do this and
[48:14] that's not a
[48:16] relationship when my children used to
[48:19] come to me and and scream at me and you
[48:21] dad you got to do this you got to do
[48:23] that for me you have to buy me this you
[48:25] have I said
[48:28] what that's not the kind of
[48:30] relationship but when they commune with
[48:33] me and they're talking with me and
[48:34] they're talking about bikes and they how
[48:37] they love bikes and how they love to you
[48:39] know ride and how then I'm seeing
[48:41] something and all of a sudden I want to
[48:43] buy them a bike I want to buy them a
[48:45] good bike I want to give them the best
[48:48] you see that's how God wants to have
[48:51] that kind of a relationship that that
[48:53] that we can have that kind of a
[48:54] relationship not not out of fear not out
[48:57] of fear because you know when when when
[48:59] when my you know children are going to
[49:01] come to me and they're and they're going
[49:03] to and they're going to come to me
[49:04] shaking and I can see in their eyes that
[49:06] they're that they're fearful because
[49:08] maybe I'm G to uh you know because they
[49:11] think I'm going to react in the wrong
[49:13] way and I'm looking at them so relax
[49:16] what is
[49:17] it well God is looking at us and he
[49:20] wants us to have that kind of a
[49:21] relationship with
[49:23] him we're seated with him
[49:27] you're communing with him here on Earth
[49:30] you suffered with him on Earth you died
[49:34] with him at
[49:37] Calvary everything that that that he did
[49:40] remember Eve was a part of
[49:43] Adam she was bone of his bone flesh of
[49:47] his flesh she was taken from the very
[49:51] substance we are no different we are
[49:54] from his body we are bone of his bone
[49:56] flesh of his flesh we're going to be
[49:58] looking at all of that as we continue
[50:00] along in this little series here but
[50:04] here he's talking he says you suffered
[50:06] with him on Earth you died with him at
[50:07] Calvary and you Rose with him again and
[50:12] now you're setting
[50:15] Where in the Heavenly places with Christ
[50:19] you see do you see that position now why
[50:22] you know we pray and we think oh you
[50:25] know we need brother Anthony and brother
[50:27] Mike and the song leaders and the
[50:28] musicians you know to to to create an
[50:31] atmosphere that's exactly what they're
[50:33] doing they're creating an
[50:36] atmosphere so that the Holy Spirit
[50:39] Heavenly places is not somewhere up in
[50:42] the
[50:44] sky that's the other thing you know
[50:46] you've got to bring it all right home
[50:49] Heavenly places is right here we're
[50:52] right now in Heavenly places communing
[50:55] with the the word of God fellowshipping
[50:57] around the word of God I know God is
[50:59] speaking to certain situations and
[51:02] certain ways and the way that we have a
[51:04] relationship with God he wants us to
[51:06] have that kind of a relationship now
[51:09] where we mature we we we're entering
[51:11] into a level of maturity you know like
[51:14] when when you first you know it's that
[51:16] first love he wants that first love but
[51:19] he wants it in maturity he wants it in
[51:23] humility he loves humility he God hates
[51:27] Pride did you know that God hates pride
[51:29] and you know that pride is one of the
[51:31] the the worst enemies that we have
[51:35] because Pride wants to exalt this oh God
[51:38] is with me God does this for me God does
[51:40] that I can do this and I can do that
[51:43] because God no that's not the kind of
[51:46] character that Christ is looking for
[51:48] he's looking for a humble spirit that
[51:51] knows the relationship that believes
[51:53] that relationship knows that that God
[51:56] can't
[51:57] lie listen if he says I'm Jehovah Rafa
[52:00] that means he's going to heal all our
[52:02] diseases when he says I'm Jehovah Nishi
[52:05] he's going to fight every battle for you
[52:08] no matter what and if he says I'm
[52:10] Jehovah Gyra then you can believe and
[52:12] trust that God is going to provide all
[52:14] your
[52:15] needs and when you get all frustrated
[52:18] and you get you know where oppression
[52:19] comes down and depression tries to you
[52:22] know stumble you and and get you to a
[52:24] place where you're discouraged he is
[52:27] Jehovah Shalom that can give you
[52:30] peace but it's all the same
[52:35] God
[52:37] hallelujah communing with him setting
[52:40] together Heavenly places in Christ
[52:43] communing communing with him a listen
[52:48] communing with him the word what is it
[52:51] that we're feeding on tonight the word
[52:53] what is it that we're exalting tonight
[52:55] right the word we're not exalting a man
[52:58] we're not exalting a Doctrine we're not
[53:00] exalting a teaching we're exalting the
[53:04] word it's always been the word it's
[53:06] always going to be the word as it feeds
[53:10] into your soul because man shall live by
[53:14] every word that proceedeth out of the
[53:17] mouth of God hallelujah praise God Amen
[53:21] praise God forever more so when we read
[53:25] here's here's another you know when we
[53:26] read Ephesians
[53:28] 2 here's another version but God being
[53:32] rich in Mercy because of the intense
[53:35] love which he bestowed on us caused us
[53:40] dead though we were through our
[53:43] offenses we were listen we were we were
[53:46] lost in sin we were caught in sin and
[53:49] you're still at times going to get
[53:51] trapped by sin did you know that you
[53:54] heard it God is God saved us but the
[53:57] blood of Christ is continually saving us
[54:02] keeping us making a way for us so that
[54:04] we can get back up because the enemy
[54:07] he's always going to throw a punch he's
[54:09] going to knock you down but Jesus Christ
[54:12] said I'll be with you even in you right
[54:14] through to the End Amen praise God and
[54:17] so even while we were through and dead
[54:22] through though we
[54:23] were through our offenses to live in
[54:27] Christ is by grace that you have been
[54:30] saved raised up with him from the dead
[54:34] and enthroned
[54:36] us with him in Heavenly Realms as being
[54:41] in
[54:42] Christ not with
[54:45] Christ not with it didn't say with
[54:47] Christ It said In Christ there's a
[54:51] difference you see if you're in Christ
[54:54] when the enemy comes and tries to smash
[54:57] you with with a blow he's got to get
[54:59] through Christ to get to
[55:02] you he has to overcome Christ before he
[55:06] can get to you and there's no way
[55:07] because he's seated far
[55:10] above he's seated far above every Power
[55:13] every principality that's why when we
[55:15] stay anchored in the word of God when we
[55:17] continue to feed on the word of God when
[55:19] we continue to listen to the tapes and
[55:22] feed on on on the on the messages that
[55:25] brother Brandon brought nobody nobody
[55:28] spoke the way he spoke other than when
[55:30] Jesus Christ was here on Earth and the
[55:33] messages and the supernatural that took
[55:36] place around his life God was
[55:38] vindicating that Supernatural not to
[55:41] exalt William
[55:43] Branham it was to exalt his
[55:46] word because the signs and wonders
[55:49] always follow the word amen praise God
[55:55] we we acknowledge William brandham we we
[55:57] recognize the Fulfillment of Malachi 45
[56:00] we wouldn't even be talking tonight or
[56:02] even quoting these these uh these quotes
[56:06] if we didn't have the message of Malachi
[56:08] 45 to come and restore the hearts of the
[56:11] children back to the faith of the
[56:13] fathers we wouldn't have a message but
[56:16] the message has always been Jesus Christ
[56:19] and Jesus Christ is now coming into his
[56:23] fullness where do you fit into this we
[56:26] know where brother bradam fit into it
[56:28] but where do you fit how do you fit into
[56:31] the plan of God how is it that you're
[56:33] going to be translated and changed in a
[56:35] moment in the twinkling of an eye you
[56:38] need the revelation of the Rapture and
[56:41] the revelation of the Rapture is not in
[56:44] a man it's in
[56:46] Christ hallelujah praise God that's what
[56:51] we need to recognize the unity and dra
[56:53] bringing us together in the unity of the
[56:56] faith that is Christ in the in the
[56:58] five-fold ministry moving and and
[57:01] feeding and edifying and and building
[57:04] and placing and positioning so that you
[57:07] can come into the unity and the fullness
[57:10] of Christ remember it's when the
[57:13] fullness of Christ when when it all
[57:15] comes together we go
[57:19] up the body needs to be
[57:22] completed we are now in the in the final
[57:25] stages of completing the body of Jesus
[57:29] Christ Hallelujah glory to God so God
[57:33] enthroned us with
[57:36] Jesus in Heavenly places God meaning the
[57:40] prophecy the word the the the the the
[57:43] the from that he that he planned from
[57:45] before the foundations of the world he
[57:47] had a plan he had a Plan of Redemption
[57:50] and that Plan of Redemption included you
[57:52] and I to be enthroned in Christ Christ
[57:55] to be placed in Christ in this day and
[57:58] in this hour because it's only in Christ
[58:02] that we can if the same spirit that
[58:04] raised Christ from the dead dwell in you
[58:07] how's it going to dwell in you unless
[58:09] you are in him he says on that day ye
[58:12] shall know that I am in the father ye in
[58:14] me and I in you all that was in all that
[58:19] God had he poured into Christ and all
[58:21] that Christ was he poured into who the
[58:25] church which is what the body of
[58:29] Christ the church is the mystical body
[58:32] of Jesus Christ but it's in it's in
[58:34] female form this is the bride Ministry
[58:37] now we this is Christ in his bride
[58:42] Ministry we need to recognize the
[58:45] ministry that we are under and how
[58:47] important it is remember it's always
[58:50] been the word when Jesus came to the
[58:54] Earth the the word was made flesh and
[58:57] dwelt Among
[59:00] Us he is the same yesterday today and
[59:03] forever so in order to to recognize
[59:06] where Jesus is today you need to
[59:09] recognize where his spirit is what his
[59:12] spirit is doing who are who are in who
[59:16] are uh uh uh filled with that Spirit
[59:19] under subjection to that spirit and
[59:21] allowing his Spirit to live through
[59:23] their lives amen praise God so so he
[59:27] enthroned Us in Heavenly places does
[59:29] that sound like a church that's defeated
[59:32] if you're in Heavenly places does that
[59:35] sound like like a church that that
[59:37] that's going to that's going to diminish
[59:39] and fall
[59:40] apart not if we've got a revelation that
[59:43] we're in Christ and every part that's in
[59:46] that body is coming into the unity of
[59:48] the faith this church should become a
[59:51] powerful light for Jesus Christ to draw
[59:54] it says if we lift up Christ if we raise
[59:58] him up it'll draw all men unto him this
[1:00:01] church is going to grow by the grace of
[1:00:03] God it's going to grow because those
[1:00:06] that are in the body are alive they're
[1:00:09] they're living organisms and they're
[1:00:10] feeding and edifying the body and when
[1:00:14] somebody comes into a living body that's
[1:00:16] healthy they're going to feel that
[1:00:18] Health they're going to feel the wealth
[1:00:20] they're going to feel the joy that's in
[1:00:22] that body they're going to feel the
[1:00:23] welcoming Spirit that's in that body
[1:00:26] that's why we don't we don't want crabby
[1:00:33] Christians grumpy Christians no we don't
[1:00:35] need
[1:00:37] Grumps there's something missing when
[1:00:40] somebody's
[1:00:42] grumpy now I understand some people when
[1:00:44] they don't get their sleep and they get
[1:00:45] up too early in the morning they're a
[1:00:47] little grumpy that can happen okay I I'm
[1:00:51] I got to watch I need to get my sleep
[1:00:54] and I encourage you to get your sleep
[1:00:56] I've said that many times when you get
[1:00:58] proper sleep you you feel better you
[1:01:01] feel healthier and you are a happier
[1:01:04] person don't be getting caught where
[1:01:07] you're staying up Beyond 12 1 2:00 in
[1:01:10] the morning you get into that habit
[1:01:12] before you know it you you're not going
[1:01:14] to you're not going to be at your
[1:01:18] Optimum you need to get your proper
[1:01:21] sleep and so the body of Christ it
[1:01:25] recognizes what what it needs it
[1:01:27] recognizes how it edifies how it
[1:01:29] encourages and how it builds you know
[1:01:32] one with the other amen glory to God
[1:01:35] it's not a defeated church let me have a
[1:01:41] drink praise God no God designed the
[1:01:44] Church of the Lord Jesus to be
[1:01:48] triumphant because we are partakers of
[1:01:50] Christ's Victory when he went to the
[1:01:53] cross and defeated the enemy we defeated
[1:01:56] the
[1:01:57] Enemy by his stripes we are healed we're
[1:02:01] we're already healed that's why when
[1:02:04] sickness comes into your body you've got
[1:02:06] to realize listen I don't care about the
[1:02:09] the effects of it I listen I I don't
[1:02:12] like it nobody likes the pain nobody
[1:02:15] likes the effects of sickness but
[1:02:18] regardless God is Jehovah Rafa that
[1:02:22] Health all my diseases
[1:02:25] and we must stand on that regardless of
[1:02:28] the of what the enemy tells us
[1:02:30] regardless of the doctor's report we do
[1:02:33] the things that we know we should do if
[1:02:35] the doctor says go get therapy go get
[1:02:37] therapy but by his stripes I'm already
[1:02:41] healed I got to go and take a a Tylenol
[1:02:45] bu his stripes I'm already healed that
[1:02:47] Tylenol is dealing with this flesh but
[1:02:50] the attribute of God it cannot
[1:02:52] disbelieve God's word and that attribute
[1:02:54] is what's surfacing in this hour it's
[1:02:57] the one that's taking over it's remember
[1:02:59] he wants the preeminence you go back and
[1:03:01] listen to Christ the mystery of God
[1:03:03] revealed God wants the preeminence in
[1:03:06] the body how does he get the preeminence
[1:03:08] in the body it's when you when you claim
[1:03:11] his
[1:03:12] preeminence when you say by your stripes
[1:03:15] I am healed Lord regardless of this
[1:03:17] sickness regardless of this pain
[1:03:20] regardless of this this moved disc in my
[1:03:23] back or what whatever it is
[1:03:24] regardless of what it is we still cannot
[1:03:28] change the the the absolute which is the
[1:03:31] word of God he says I'm the Lord God
[1:03:33] that heals all he didn't say some he
[1:03:36] said all so we claim it and we wait
[1:03:39] until it's done if it takes the Rapture
[1:03:41] to do it well praise God let it be
[1:03:44] that's fine with me but if he wants to
[1:03:46] do it right now in the name of Jesus let
[1:03:49] it be done all you got to do is receive
[1:03:51] it because you're in the body you're in
[1:03:54] in Heavenly places you're he's he's over
[1:03:57] every Power and every principality he's
[1:03:59] over every sickness he's over every
[1:04:02] demon power that would try to oppress
[1:04:05] you and depress you and and bring you
[1:04:07] down you've got to stand in Christ Jesus
[1:04:10] where he's placed
[1:04:12] you Hallelujah and claim the word of God
[1:04:15] Amen because the believer is in Christ
[1:04:17] when Christ sat down the believer sat
[1:04:20] down with him far above principalities
[1:04:24] and Powers the church the body of Christ
[1:04:26] is in Christ the body is connected to
[1:04:29] the Head Jesus is the head of his body
[1:04:32] the
[1:04:33] church that's why he had to come down in
[1:04:37] 1963 it's all part of the plan Saints
[1:04:40] the head that's why when you go back you
[1:04:43] look at the cloud in
[1:04:44] 1963 it was on Sunset Mountain the sun
[1:04:49] had to come and set on the body that's
[1:04:53] what he was doing he was coming because
[1:04:55] he said there's no way that they're
[1:04:57] going to in that human understanding
[1:05:00] until I go down there and just remember
[1:05:03] all it is is that Christ came down to
[1:05:06] call those attributes that were ordained
[1:05:09] to be in this
[1:05:11] age okay so when he was coming down the
[1:05:15] head was coming down it was coming to
[1:05:16] meet with those
[1:05:18] attributes but those attributes happen
[1:05:21] to be in human
[1:05:23] bodies and so that's why we assemble
[1:05:26] ourselves you know oh I don't need to go
[1:05:28] to church I don't need to be in the
[1:05:30] church I can just watch it online yeah
[1:05:32] you can but let me tell you there is a
[1:05:34] difference when you come into the church
[1:05:37] and you are personally present in the
[1:05:40] church you get into that atmosphere of
[1:05:42] the word and the Holy Spirit starts
[1:05:44] moving down through the pews and all of
[1:05:47] a sudden this one receives a healing
[1:05:49] this one receives a a Deliverance this
[1:05:51] one gets depression and oppression
[1:05:53] leaves the body what is it it's the
[1:05:55] power of God because the body is a
[1:05:58] living body we are the we're going to
[1:06:01] look at a lot of different quotes not
[1:06:02] tonight but I've got a lot of quotes
[1:06:04] that's going to show you that you are
[1:06:06] actually the Flesh and bone of Jesus
[1:06:09] Christ you are the body that that that's
[1:06:11] coming together the attributes are in
[1:06:14] there but the body is physically coming
[1:06:17] together and they're meeting together
[1:06:19] because remember at some point this
[1:06:21] Mortal body shall be
[1:06:24] changed how's that going to happen oh no
[1:06:28] it's no but no that's just you know I
[1:06:30] don't need I don't need the the the the
[1:06:31] caral body no no you do need it while
[1:06:34] you're here in this Dimension and while
[1:06:37] your attribute is in this dimension in
[1:06:40] this body it's going to Quicken it's
[1:06:42] going to line upon line precept upon
[1:06:45] precept here a little there a little in
[1:06:48] the power in the midst of the Holy
[1:06:50] Spirit he's going to come down and he's
[1:06:52] going to deliver you and he's going to
[1:06:53] change you he's going to Quicken you
[1:06:55] he's going to lift you out of that
[1:06:57] unbelief that's holding you down that
[1:07:00] sickness that's got a hold of you one
[1:07:03] just all it takes is one word from the
[1:07:04] Lord to speak to that thing and it's
[1:07:07] done over because he's still a miracle
[1:07:10] working God we are not dealing with a
[1:07:12] natural God we are not dealing with
[1:07:15] Pagan Idols we don't put Idols up and go
[1:07:18] and bow down before them we don't do the
[1:07:20] 14 Stations of the Cross we don't
[1:07:22] believe in any of that stuff we go to
[1:07:24] the to the source which is Jesus Christ
[1:07:28] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:07:30] amen hallelujah glory to God the church
[1:07:35] if Jesus the head triumph over the devil
[1:07:38] is the body of Christ to be less
[1:07:40] triumphant since we are in Christ
[1:07:44] absolutely not if he overcame every
[1:07:47] devil and you're in Christ and you've
[1:07:49] overcome you've already overcome you're
[1:07:52] already healed you're already at peace
[1:07:54] you already got shalom in you you're
[1:07:57] already uh uh provided with all of your
[1:08:00] needs all everything it's in God's
[1:08:02] Storehouse it comes to you exactly when
[1:08:05] you have need of it amen praise God
[1:08:09] hallelujah of course not it's our legal
[1:08:13] right to enjoy joint seating with Christ
[1:08:16] in Heavenly places in a position of
[1:08:18] authority and Triumph far above all
[1:08:21] principalities and powers and and if you
[1:08:24] will take advantage of your joint
[1:08:26] seating now now now taking advantage of
[1:08:29] your joint seating you know what taking
[1:08:30] advantage of your joint it's feeding on
[1:08:32] the word it's knowing that you're seated
[1:08:35] with Christ you're in Heavenly places
[1:08:37] the Holy Spirit surrounds you and you
[1:08:40] can feed on the word and everything
[1:08:42] you're feeding on is line upon line
[1:08:44] precept upon precept here a little there
[1:08:47] and you're being changed you're being
[1:08:49] transformed in the moment amen praise
[1:08:53] praise God hallelujah praise God the
[1:08:56] believer's position and seating in
[1:08:57] Christ it's a
[1:08:59] fact and it's already
[1:09:02] happened he hath that's a past tense
[1:09:07] word it's not something that's coming
[1:09:09] Saints that's why we need to get our
[1:09:11] perspective right we're already in
[1:09:13] Heavenly places we're already enjoying
[1:09:16] the benefits of as a son and a daughter
[1:09:18] of God we don't need to live
[1:09:20] underprivileged we can leave here
[1:09:22] tonight Victor glorious in the word of
[1:09:24] God to know that God tomorrow is going
[1:09:27] to I'm going to walk right into all my
[1:09:29] needs I'm going to walk into my healing
[1:09:32] I'm going to walk into my peace I'm
[1:09:34] going to walk into a fixed relationship
[1:09:36] with with this individual or that boss
[1:09:39] or one of my children whatever it is
[1:09:41] because God is is the God of Peace he's
[1:09:44] going to bring peace to my life
[1:09:47] Hallelujah I'm going to claim it all
[1:09:49] glory to God Amen you don't have to try
[1:09:52] to be seated
[1:09:55] in in Christ you are seated in Christ
[1:09:57] you don't have to try oh I got to I got
[1:09:59] to do this I got to do that no we're
[1:10:01] beyond that now this is not about the
[1:10:04] law it's not law that's going to save
[1:10:07] you it's your revelation of who you are
[1:10:11] in Christ and that you're seated with
[1:10:13] him that is your Authority that is your
[1:10:16] position when the queen gets called to
[1:10:19] sit next to the king in the palace that
[1:10:22] Queen is is is in a seat of
[1:10:26] authority she's recognized she's looked
[1:10:30] upon and she and when she speaks all the
[1:10:34] servants they obey her because she's
[1:10:36] under the king she's under the
[1:10:38] leadership of the king and the King has
[1:10:42] placed his seal upon her life hallelujah
[1:10:46] praise God they don't have to pray
[1:10:48] through to be seated with Christ oh Lord
[1:10:51] I need to be seated with you I need need
[1:10:54] I need this Lord and Lord I need you to
[1:10:57] heal that's not the relationship we
[1:10:59] should
[1:11:00] have when we pray it's not how loud you
[1:11:04] pray it's not how long you
[1:11:07] pray it's not how how eloquent and you
[1:11:11] start bringing scripture and this and
[1:11:13] that and oh it just sounds so
[1:11:17] wonderful it's your
[1:11:20] relationship and when you have a
[1:11:22] relationship and your son comes to you
[1:11:25] and he's sick or your daughter comes to
[1:11:27] you and they're sick and you're laying
[1:11:30] hands upon that
[1:11:31] child you are laying hands and you
[1:11:35] represent Jesus Christ to
[1:11:40] them not to make yourself Jesus Christ
[1:11:43] not to make yourself God I I I have this
[1:11:46] Authority that's not the character
[1:11:49] remember the only thing that we're going
[1:11:51] to leave here with is character
[1:11:54] Christ is looking for character he's
[1:11:58] looking for the right kind of attitude
[1:12:00] that can take that power that he's given
[1:12:04] and allow it to be expressed because of
[1:12:06] the
[1:12:07] relationship you are as to pray over
[1:12:11] that child you go there and you say
[1:12:13] father I'm so thankful for that
[1:12:15] relationship Lord that you've promised
[1:12:18] by your word that by your stripes we
[1:12:21] were healed Lord we were there with you
[1:12:23] we we're so grateful for this Revelation
[1:12:26] that you've placed in our hearts in the
[1:12:28] name of Jesus Christ be whole and walk
[1:12:33] away you don't have to get into all a
[1:12:35] screaming match and everything else
[1:12:38] there's times for that when demons start
[1:12:40] to act up and and you've got to pray and
[1:12:42] you've got to fight those powers and
[1:12:44] those principalities and you've got to
[1:12:45] deal with them there's times and seasons
[1:12:48] for everything but initially I'm just
[1:12:52] trying to con convey that relationship
[1:12:54] that that that we want to have in Christ
[1:12:56] amen we're seated in in Victory with
[1:12:59] Christ the believer's position and
[1:13:01] seeding in Christ it's a fact it's
[1:13:04] already happened the position was
[1:13:06] attained and was given to us and as we
[1:13:09] wind it down
[1:13:12] now when a Believer gets the revelation
[1:13:14] of their position in Christ it makes all
[1:13:17] the difference in the
[1:13:19] world it changes everything they'll no
[1:13:23] longer be def you will no longer be
[1:13:26] walking defeated some days how's it
[1:13:29] going well it's the weather's terrible
[1:13:32] and you
[1:13:33] know like like
[1:13:36] negative you got you got to be careful
[1:13:39] of your
[1:13:41] speech how you doing not bad oh so bad
[1:13:45] but not so
[1:13:50] bad do you see what I'm saying
[1:13:54] we're we're we're we're like we've come
[1:13:56] into a place where we're in Christ and
[1:13:58] God has given us authority to speak the
[1:14:00] word of God but we need to do it by
[1:14:04] relationship and so when somebody says
[1:14:07] how are
[1:14:09] you doing wonderful by the grace of God
[1:14:13] doing well the Lord is providing the
[1:14:16] Lord is good now you're not going to be

[1:14:56] position you're aware that you're
[1:14:57] walking in Heavenly places you're aware
[1:14:59] that you're in Christ amen and that all
[1:15:01] things are possible to them that are in
[1:15:04] Christ Jesus glory to God because of our
[1:15:07] position in Christ God is the strength
[1:15:09] of our life in the books of in the Book
[1:15:11] of Psalms of whom shall I be afraid
[1:15:14] Psalms
[1:15:15] 271 of whom shall I be afraid we we're
[1:15:19] not to be fearful Christians we're not
[1:15:21] to be living by fear we're not to be
[1:15:22] making
[1:15:23] Decisions by fear we're to make them by
[1:15:28] by Common Sense first of
[1:15:30] all and we always got to have an element
[1:15:33] of common sense to all of our decision
[1:15:37] making but understand that as a son or
[1:15:40] daughter of God you can believe in the
[1:15:43] Supernatural you can believe in
[1:15:45] miracles don't look at the circumstance

[1:16:03] situation is going to work out for good
[1:16:06] because I'm in Christ I'm in Heavenly
[1:16:09] places and everything that comes into my
[1:16:11] life it's going to have to work for good
[1:16:15] it can't work against me because he's
[1:16:18] for me hallelujah praise God he said
[1:16:22] what shall I we don't have to be afraid
[1:16:23] of anything including Satan demons evil
[1:16:27] spirits because Christ gave us the
[1:16:29] victory at the cross amen the body of
[1:16:32] Christ triumphant church we are what
[1:16:35] more than conquerors because we're in
[1:16:38] Christ being in Christ makes you more
[1:16:40] than a conqueror amen you've got
[1:16:43] Supernatural Grace amen glory to God our
[1:16:47] joint seating and ruling with Christ is
[1:16:49] the climax of The Redemptive work this
[1:16:53] this is all going to climax this is the
[1:16:55] great final uh part of of bringing the
[1:16:59] body together and finishing the body of
[1:17:02] Christ amen let the musicians
[1:17:05] come this is this is our part this is
[1:17:08] where Redemption comes into its fullness
[1:17:11] because remember he's only redeeming
[1:17:13] those whose names were written in the
[1:17:15] Lamb's Book of Life our names were
[1:17:17] sealed from before the foundations of
[1:17:20] the world and he's come to redeem those
[1:17:24] glory to God Jesus exalted Hallelujah
[1:17:27] not only that but all Dominion Authority
[1:17:30] and power was put beneath his feet and
[1:17:33] because we are his church they're also
[1:17:36] beneath our feet it's as simple as that
[1:17:39] and we are the body of Christ we are the
[1:17:42] last true church did you know that we're
[1:17:45] the last true
[1:17:47] church we're we're in the last true
[1:17:50] church age after this it goes into into
[1:17:53] a totally different dimensional change
[1:17:56] we go into the
[1:17:57] Millennium 1,000 years of Peace
[1:18:00] Hallelujah but God is finishing up that
[1:18:03] last final church and that literal Body
[1:18:07] of Christ is going to fulfill the
[1:18:10] Rapture and when the Rapture takes place
[1:18:14] this the rest of the world goes into
[1:18:16] total chaos let's go to the to the last
[1:18:18] quote
[1:18:20] here the true church of Christ the bride
[1:18:25] is so sold out to him and his promised
[1:18:28] word till the very mind that's in Christ
[1:18:32] is in
[1:18:33] you that's that's where that's where
[1:18:36] we've come Saints we need to we need to
[1:18:38] allow the word to fully penetrate within
[1:18:42] our lives and accept it that's Christ in
[1:18:45] you what a difference and we find today
[1:18:48] that the modern Church a modern World
[1:18:52] Church the modern World Church and also
[1:18:55] the spiritual church are both pregnated
[1:18:58] to give birth to
[1:19:00] Sons one of them a denominational birth
[1:19:04] is going to be give one day to these
[1:19:07] days at the World Council of churches
[1:19:10] will which will produce the world the
[1:19:13] Antichrist which is going to come out
[1:19:16] through
[1:19:17] denomination all right that's exactly
[1:19:20] the truth I may not live to see it I
[1:19:23] believe I will but you young people
[1:19:27] remember that you heard a minister say
[1:19:29] that that'll finally wind up and this is
[1:19:32] the mark of the beast when she forms the
[1:19:35] World Council of churches this is all in
[1:19:39] full progress right now
[1:19:41] Saints okay it's all going into the
[1:19:44] World Council of churches but there's
[1:19:46] another body that's been pregnated by
[1:19:48] the word of God Amen the other look here
[1:19:52] here it is the other so that finally
[1:19:55] winds up and that is the mark of the
[1:19:57] beast the World Council of churches and
[1:19:59] she'll give birth to the son the
[1:20:01] Antichrist the other is pregnated by the
[1:20:03] word of God and will bring forth now
[1:20:06] listen here the
[1:20:08] body the finished body of Jesus Christ
[1:20:13] which is the
[1:20:16] bride the body of Christ isn't finished
[1:20:21] yet listen what what he saying here how
[1:20:24] many knows that a man and a woman is one
[1:20:26] and Christ is one body the word the
[1:20:31] bride will have to be the rest of that
[1:20:34] body and the two together makes the one
[1:20:37] body again which is Jesus Christ in
[1:20:41] Heavenly places seated with his bride

[1:20:47] beginning man his
