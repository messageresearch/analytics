Lord Brother Chris you have a you have on that desk yep you have a folder called opening songs okay and when I tell you to then you put that on okay praise the Lord okay um as I was coming along

his missionary report right about what actually took place by the way um he called me just let me know that he was back and he was excited he didn't talk to me long but he was excited just to say well praise the Lord Pastor um you know I went back to that church that we went to uh in the woods there where we had to go down that uh dirt road and the car got stuck in the Stream and and uh stuff like that you know and um he said I went back there this past this past Friday Friday last to speak there after I had left on Thursday he went back on Friday night their service to speak there and he said he had a wonderful service and um he didn't feel like going back driving two hours back to the city so he stayed in the pastor's office in the back not an office like mine mine would be really nice uh and he said just lay on one of the chairs there and took his jacket and make a pillow and he slept in the pastor's office in there all right now um but that's not what this is about he said that uh he got a call uh on Monday and it was the pastor of that church and he said I I I don't know what happened he said but on Sunday he says crowds of people turned out he don't know where they came from and the church was jam packed and people all around standing outside and he asking him what what what happened how come you came here what did you what brought you here and stuff like that they just heard that I was there and they thought I was still there with my wife and that I was going to preach on Sunday so I don't know these people but somehow they heard and they come out in droves he said he had to go try to go and get things for them to sit on he used up all his extra chairs outside and people were still standing he said since the church started I've never seen anything like this oh praise God he says but he pre said anyways preach the word of God anyway and I trust that some of them were uh converted because some of them were Pentecostal from the Pentecostal Church round about and stuff like that and uh they they turned out so something seems to be happening there and we want to give for God praise for that prise thank you Lord hallelujah thank you Jesus I think that was wonderful I still have a peppermint in my for my throat here yeah you don't mind me just being normal right but we had a great time there in Africa and I just want to say that uh that we had a great time and the people's hearts and the response to the gospel is absolutely outstanding so we want to thank the Lord for that uh anyway brother coffee will speak for himself when he does come right he'll speak for himself let me mention this you change the subject sister CA how many remember Sister CA she was here Su K she's just graduated from University as a financial analyst and um so I just wanted you to know that that the Lord has blessed her and brought her through cuz you remember her problems uh um or you may not know her problems at one point she didn't have the money to pay the fees to finish uh this past year and uh God worked a miracle we a very wealthy person just paid it amen a Welling person just paid it uh she's never seen the person there's know the person person just gave the money and paid her fees so we want give God for the miracle that's the reason why I mention it actually that we still serve a miracle work amen amen and by the way the fees were not $1,000 it was more like uh I think it was something like $25,000 you know that finished up all paying up all other fees that she might have hold or whatever but I just took care of it so God we serve a mighty God Amen and God is able in all circumstances all conditions amen praise the Lord hallelujah well for the past weeks uh while I was here I uh was speaking on the uh bright Revival seven tunders character of Christ in you uh talking about various things of that nature and um it's so strange but as I was was coming along uh thinking about different things the Holy Spirit brought something to my attention and while the bridegroom tering they all slumbered and slept well you know I preached on the part where he emphasized that they all Slumber and uh you know let me warn you and warn the Believers that um it's not just the Sinners but the be himself prophesying that the Believers at the bright time are going to have a Spirit of Slumber sleep slow down look warm cold down uh everything is going to start coming on them burden the devil is going to put cares put burdens upon them to put them in the sleep a condition of Slumber amen and I F show you this past Sunday that uh to they slumbered and slept Revival he says means to shake yourself to wake up Amen to wake up that's what Revival so so what's happening we have the word the word starts to become so ordinary until we start not paying as much attention as we would and we start to spiritually fall asleep with our eyes open right M amen our eyes wide open and yet we are asleep to what God is doing I'm briefly touching on what what I said what the holy spirit said through me uh for his glory and I know that for fact because I myself was falling asleep I don't know about you but I was falling asleep and starting to Slumber amen because Slumber is not just normal sleep Slumber is when you are in deep sleep and uh and things going on around you and you don't even know what's going on around you Supernatural occurrences taking place and you're not really aware of it right but then uh they slumbered and slept but as I was just coming this is just just now holy spirit said uh if they were slumbering and they're sleeping what woke them up M and then it hit me the seven Thunders woke them up it was a voice of God behold the bridegroom cometh amen and they heard the Midnight Cry of God's voice they heard the blast of the seven Thunders and it shook them to their core amen amen we have a message brothers and sisters amen and this message should be shaking the word shaking the community and shaking our own Hearts amen and uh a way with just the C singing do you know C singing and even come to the message where people are singing the songs of the message through style through Talent through uh abilities human ability and stuff like that and do you know I can remember the time and the days not too long ago Even in our church in the early days people get up to sing a song and and and the tears flowing down their eyes amen cuz when just to sing yes Jesus loves me right away amen the Lord touches your heart amen when you sing the songs like he took my place at Calvary he took my place at calary yes when he was on the cross I was on his mind yes he knew me yes he Lov me oh God he who caused the Stars the entire Heavens to shine M what has happened now the people are singing the same songs but it doesn't have the R anymore because they're trying to make it so polished and so acceptable and and and that's some what God wants and we not here to make the message acceptable to you or anybody we want raw primtive Christianity like the apostles are amen that's what we need back in the Church of the Living God hallelujah amen instead of trying to polish it up and and and and put it on a new oxcar to try to bring it in that's what we need we need to go right back to the original like promise in the Bible amen hallelujah it's clear here brother that we need we who have been called in this last hour we are given the some toal of all of the seven Church agent all the revelations combined in one now the fullness of the voice of God hallelujah my god when we speak this word it's the same voice that John heard that he said seven Thunders under their voices Lightnings thunderings came out of the Throne of God hallelujah wow it's God's voice that he heard but he heard it through the Seven Ages right seven Thunders uttered their voices but actually one voice but it uttered down through the church ages so he heard it like what Rolling Thunder that's how you heard it like Rolling Thunder it went from one age to the next to the next and the next and the next it went down like that but in all of it it was one voice amen and what we have the prophet said is the voice of God is these last days we have the whole thing combined what a people we are to be and how we should come together in the house of God with humility and with Grace with sincerity with the love of God within our soul and the spirit of God within our hearts our hearts should be almost like broken for what he did for us and what we did to him because it's our sins that nailed him to the Cross amen amen praise the Lord our sins nailed him there to the Cross we are the ones that provided the spikes that placed him there praise God you you you see what I'm talking about I'm just making a little Point here today it appears to be a little Point here today but brother sister the only thing in this age uh that can wake the people up and wake up the bride and wake up the members of the Bride is the seven thunders of Revelation 10 amen when he the mighty Angel uted his voice seven Thunders UT their voices when he uted his voice the people heard it seven ters UT their voices the voice of the mighty Angel Christ The Covenant Angel come down among the speak to speak his own words and rolling thunder where we can hear it with our ears with our hearts amen and believe it not intellectually but it grabs your soul and you're moved by the spirit of almighty God Amen not moved even by the religious knowledge that we have people that follow this message for 30 40 years somebody called me up uh you know and said oh my God I heard this preacher brother that was preaching for so many years years that now his daughters are running around with shorts and he's saying he wasted his life for for 25 years and and and and he don't believe the message is the truth anymore and and stuff like that you know they don't understand it shows he wasn't converted in the first place amen if he was truly converted then he's committed blasphemy against the holy spirit amen yes sir but there not really truly converted but if you claim to be converted then he commit in blasphemy against the holy spirit amen and then we see the reaction in their life but you you understand what's going on I hope you can understand there Paul told us there must be a falling away first you got to have Falling Away first there's too many people that were just hiding under the the the name and Shadow of this message of Malachi 45 everybody was going I'm in the message I'm in the message I follow the prophet well you know Jesus turned to Peter just before he left he said Peter he said it's all right you're saying that but Satan is going to sift you like wheat and I believe we are in a sifting time right now amen where the Holy Spirit of the Living God is siting through the bride of Christ amen hallelujah and we are passing through the ding man's filter uh glory to God and brother and sister there God is checking every one of us now and the Maring angel of Ezekiel is passing through the land and mocking those that are him amen for the Lord love them that are his praise God one thing we can rejoice in is that the foundations of God stand sure amen amen and God knows them that here Amen in the 70th week of Daniel 70 weeks of Daniel brother said the foundation of God stand short for the foundation stone was laid in them before the foundations of the world what we are the ones bringing forth the headstone crying what Grace Grace Grace The Headstone of Grace is being manifest to our life and we are here as a testimony of it brother I believe that we are right now CAU up is not beginning to be caught up into another wave of Revival amen that's right I don't

let God have his holy way praise the Lord some of the best Services I've ever been in sometimes is been on two or three or five people turn up to church amen is that right I don't know about you but that's a fact and then you start oh I wish everybody was here praise God but that's the pro God wanted to be there hallelujah thank you Lord he wanted to be there and then you when you got spiritual minded you understand that you were selected to be there amen and that you should feel honored to be there Hallelujah let's cry and say oh it was only us that was there and some you don't understand that because God select you that you're just like with his disciples he had some he had 500 of them but he only allowed 12 to be close to him and then he only allowed three to be really close to him so God has his own processes why he does things amen so every night every day you come in the house of God you ought to be praising God for the opportunity amen hallelujah amen thank you Lord right

now that we are not we are not here to be restricted by the ministers using C order and doctr to bind the Saints and bind the actions and activities of how you should bee in the house of God Amen we realize that that was a trap and and Satan used it and made them take the very word of God like Satan did and said did God say so and so and he called scripture to her and had her wondering what in the world is going on Amen I said he used scripture to amen praise God hallelujah but thank God after he told his lie the morning messenger came and cried out with the First Gospel message I know

start to come down you have to ask her to get quiet down or stop praying before they can sleep we're talking about people praying amen we not talking about playing we talking about praying we're talking about agonizing in the house of God of God we got get rid of of Pride we got to get rid of you know all these cultural things that we got M and stuff that the devil using to to to dignify you and lock you up where you can't really be free in Christ and let the Holy Ghost have his way only low class people scream like that only untrained people speaking Tes man or or maybe the something is mentally deranged that's why the spok in t well I speak in t but privately amen only Holy Spirit want me to speak publicly but privately I speak in THS uh praise the Lord and I feel it takes me deep in the spirit when I'm speaking in TOs and when I'm in prayer and I'm speaking in TOS praise the Lord takes you to another level praise God forever more because then you're cut away from just your your mind just your your conscious mind and breaks you into the Supernatural by the grace of God praise the Lord brother and sister oh my if you sitting here today and you feel that you just don't have enough of a portion of the Holy Spirit then ask God to baptize you to overflowing amen amen amen baptize me to overflowing SP off me and touching the lives of for the glory of God lord praise God I was in the book store the other day I don't know what's going on but as I was there you know I like love to be book stores new books old books whatever but then you know two men approached me and says who are you who who are you uh I said oh I'm just a preacher you know like that you know he says well you're a preacher then you must be well versed in Theology and stuff like that you know I studed theology I went to this I go to this certain certain big church over there whatever like that but you know I saw just saw you here there's something about you I said I I got to come over and ask you like that and and then he started doing the wrong thing he started testing he started saying oh yes he said well so so what what what what do you believe about um you know original sin and and these kinds you know original sin and this what happened in the garden and whatever like that you know I said well you know um I I said you know what sin is in the first place I said you know sin came from Adam Adam representative man you know because of sin on Adam as our representative we all died and in Adam we all died in Christ We Are All Made Alive and they start talking to him about the three tenses of sin and so on started to talk like that to him and begin to just open I quot in because I didn't the Holy Spirit didn't make me start talking about Eve and all this stuff like that I just touch him on the realm where he is where he lives because he's coming from a theological point of view so I started talking along that way got into eternal security because he was saying you're talking about eternal security I said well that's the only thing that's in the Bible is eternal security because God set it PL he said a son a servant goes out but a son abides in the house forever you can't your own son once he's a genuine son I'm not talking about every Christian but a genuine son you can't kick him out he's got your blood in you even he might be a disobedient son might be a sinful son might be a rebellious son whatever you want to call it but he's still a son you can't get rid of him God's Eternal his sons are Eternal my goodness after a while he he just couldn't take he walk away you know he's like his head but I told him I said I said you asking me this thing but I said you approaching this from the theological point of view but I'm not hermeneutics apologetics and expositions and this kinds of stuff well how do you preach your sermons do you preach it in this way or I said well I know you're talking about being topical or expository or this or that or whatever or textually or whatever I said but I don't think about that when I come to speak I said even though I know and knew about all that stuff I don't even pay any mind I just say what God put in my mouth he said so then all you do is just speak the word I said yeah you said it right I praise the Lord Hall glory to God but something is going on brothers and sisters yes and I believe the holy spirit is fixing to another wave is about is rolling in amen you know how the waves of the sea come in and then they pull back after a while but then when you think it's all gone all of a sudden you see it's coming again amen praise God I believe it's coming again amen and I believe elah said I hear the sound of the abundance of Amen praise the Lord I believe it amen and I expect it I don't know what you expect but I expect it amen praise the Lord and that's why I Rejoice that I'm a part of what God is doing and that this thing this message has had a shake down and uh uh now just a little bit of grave is left in the bottom after to shake down but thank God I am one of those I'm part of it amen and the less it's get is the more valuable you become to God the less it gets you become more valuable praise the Lord and it just shows you that God shaking the whole thing down amen and looking at his beloved is redeemed and he's going to pour His Spirit out upon us even in a more Mighty powerful way some of you who been having ailment you will suddenly find that you're healed you're going to find that you're well because God has more work for you to do amen he's got to use you and he has got to use you with a healthy strong body I'm not saying everybody because sometimes God allows some people to he didn't make you sick but he will allow you to have affliction so that the sinner could look on and see how The Godly is able to suffer and not curse God you understand sometimes God allows it so that the S can look on and said my God that man is really a Christian with all the challenges he got with all the problems in God I never one day hear that man say anything against God the CH but stilling uping up his praising God singing songs in the night natural and spiritual night come on you and you can see your way still singing Praise the Lord [Music] amen songs sing all to praise him and give him glory amen hallelujah amen praise God it's revival time thank you Lord It's the pr time amen and the Holy Spirit is confirming Ming this word the word of God and you're going to see the message going into at least in here into a supernatural level it's moving into a higher Supernatural level to expect expect [Music] anything hallelujah amen things are possible amen all things are possible amen you Lord thank you Jesus back to Little White Church where we preaching and the pillar of fire comes out the wall that tree of life we used to have the big brass tree like and it's hanging like a fruit and the picture being taken I should have it somewhere praise the Lord amen Devils being cast out amen people comeing in the service sit down the preaching on ah screaming like that run out the doors don't because the devil can't take it amen all those kind Devils walk from as far as D handled them to come down come down to the church Bing on the door trapped them the Devils coming everywhere amen and at the same time the sick being healed supernatural being displayed praise God
