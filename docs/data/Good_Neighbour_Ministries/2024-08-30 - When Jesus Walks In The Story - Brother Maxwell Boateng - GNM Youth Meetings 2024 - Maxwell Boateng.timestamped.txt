[36:46] Timothy 2: 20- 22 it says but in a great
[36:52] house there are not only vessels of gold
[36:56] and of silver
[36:58] but also of wood and of Earth and some
[37:02] to honor and some to dishonor if a man

[37:33] charity peace and with them and this is
[37:38] the theme for this
[37:40] weekend call on the Lord out of a pure
[37:46] heart I believe that there can be great
[37:50] change in your hearts and in your lives
[37:54] this weekend and it's going to start
[37:57] here tonight but God is saying you need
[37:59] to call out of a pure heart amen you
[38:04] know uh Samuel one day was called of the
[38:08] Lord and said Samuel we need to anoint a
[38:10] new king over
[38:12] Israel because because Saul you know
[38:16] Saul did not have a heart for the Lord
[38:18] Saul had a disobedient heart he would
[38:21] not listen to the Lord and so the Lord
[38:24] said we need to call somebody to lead
[38:27] Israel we need to place into position
[38:31] somebody that is going to feed and edify
[38:34] and bless this body my body amen and so
[38:38] he went to Jesse's house and he said
[38:40] Jesse bring out all your sons because
[38:43] the Lord wants to anoint a new king
[38:46] Jesse thought with his mind Jesse
[38:48] thought because of the way they looked
[38:50] on the outside listen God is not looking
[38:53] at the outside of you he's looking for a
[38:56] pure heart tonight he's looking for a
[39:00] pure heart this weekend and if you
[39:03] approach him in that way he will anoint
[39:06] you amen David had a heart for the Lord
[39:10] David was a man after God's Own Heart
[39:14] what was it inside of David it was that
[39:18] call that deep call within his heart to
[39:21] have the Lord do the great things that
[39:24] he had been doing in his life and and I
[39:27] believe you can have a freshh start
[39:30] tonight but you need to call on him out

[52:20] from the rulers of the synagogue say
[52:24] certain which said the daughter is dead
[52:28] why troubl as th the master any for as
[52:31] soon as Jesus heard the word that was
[52:34] spoken he saith unto the ruler of the
[52:36] synagogue Be not Afraid only believe and
[52:40] he suffered no man to follow him sath
[52:43] Peter and James and John the brother of
[52:45] James and he come to the house of the
[52:48] ruler of the synagogue and see the
[52:51] tumult and them that wept and wailed
[52:54] greatly and when he was come in he saith
[52:57] unto them why make ye this adore and

[53:06] he had put them all at he talk it to the
[53:10] father and the mother and the damel and
[53:12] them that were with him and entered in
[53:17] where the damel was
[53:19] lying and he took the damsel boy the
[53:22] hand and said unto her tell it to call
[53:24] me which is being interpreted damsel I
[53:27] say unto thee arise and straight away
[53:30] the damsel arose and walked for she was
[53:34] of the age of 12 years and they were
[53:37] astonished with a great astonishment and
[53:39] he charged them straightly that no man
[53:41] should know it and commanded that
[53:44] something should be given her to it amen
[53:47] may the Lord add his Blessing to the
[53:49] readon of the word you may have you seat
[53:52] amen
[53:54] amen I want to say to you to list the
[53:56] saving and
[54:06] live want to take title this evening the
[54:08] Lord will permit amen we want to speak
[54:10] on when Jesus walks in the
[54:14] story when Jesus walks in the story amen
[54:19] now the stle came told me as we were we
[54:21] were praying for these meetings and
[54:23] seeking the face of the Lord and which
[54:25] direction to go special in the first
[54:27] service you know many times they said
[54:29] that's the O breaking service so we're
[54:31] seeking the face of the Lord which way
[54:32] would go the direction we would go and
[54:35] and I received a a a poem from from a
[54:38] sister in cral area and and and I began
[54:41] to read the poem and as I was reading
[54:43] the poem The Lord start to lay on my
[54:45] heart to to God this direction for the
[54:47] first service and so just before we
[54:49] start was all right I like to read the
[54:51] poem amen and and the poem goes and it
[54:55] says this
[54:57] when Jesus walks in the story is
[55:00] different the child that's ding the
[55:03] brother that's gone the heart that's
[55:05] hungered disease the wors on the room
[55:09] that is filled with a whale of Despair
[55:12] the life that is broken beyond all
[55:15] repair when Jesus walks in the story is
[55:19] different stand still and see what seems
[55:23] like the end rearranges to become the
[55:26] prayers and then life more abundant in
[55:30] his word boy his Touch where you had
[55:34] nothing God creates much when Jesus
[55:38] walks in the story is different don't be
[55:42] in a hurry to pen the last page don't
[55:45] lay down your weapon don't question your
[55:48] fed you've called on the Lord name be
[55:53] still and know he's not long coming
[55:57] somewhere else to go if you just wait a
[56:00] moment see Jesus walked
[56:04] in that's why we taking this title when
[56:07] Jesus walks in the story I wonder to sa
[56:10] and a man if we could just begin and and
[56:13] and and begin to have create a little
[56:14] scene the sav and am man and you get to
[56:17] notice that like drama to turns a little
[56:19] more and and so as we go on in these
[56:22] meetings but if we just open the scene
[56:24] this evening Amen in the book of Genesis
[56:26] amen Genesis chapter 1 if we just take
[56:28] the first four verses the scripture says
[56:31] that in the beginning God created the
[56:33] heavens and the Earth and the Earth was
[56:35] without form and void and darkness was
[56:37] upon the face of the deep and the spirit
[56:40] of God moved upon the face of the waters
[56:43] and God said let there be light and
[56:45] there was light and God saw the light
[56:48] that it was God and God voided the light
[56:50] from the darkness and God called the
[56:53] light there and the Darkness he called
[56:55] night and the evening and the morning
[56:57] was the first day and as we read the
[57:00] scripture you know we can see how God
[57:02] began to unfold himself in this great
[57:05] drama but brand will tell us there was
[57:07] this drama that was being played and and
[57:09] God began to unfold himself in this
[57:11] great drama and the purpose of this
[57:13] great drama was for him to reveal
[57:15] himself amen reveal the attributes amen
[57:18] that were the inside that was on the
[57:19] inside of him he wanted to express the
[57:21] attribute as a savior amen he wanted to
[57:24] express the attribute as a redeemer amen
[57:26] he wanted to express the attribute as a
[57:28] redeemer as as a Healer as a deliverer
[57:30] amen and the scripture says that as God
[57:32] will begin to to unfold this drama amen
[57:35] he needed a place to unfold the drama
[57:38] amen and the place that God chose the
[57:40] unfold the drama was the heavens and the
[57:43] Earth amen he chose that place to unfold
[57:46] the drama amen but now the scripture
[57:48] says that the place that God was going
[57:49] to unfold this drama was a place that
[57:51] was with form amen it was a place that
[57:54] was void and dark Ness covered the fs of
[57:57] the deep of this place amen so so that

[1:00:53] beginning that is thus say the Lord will
[1:00:56] come to pass every time he speaks amen
[1:01:00] that was what he was teaching us amen
[1:01:02] and so he speaks in this darkness and as
[1:01:04] he begin to speak and the Darkness begin
[1:01:07] to break away you know we see that that
[1:01:09] something was happening that the L
[1:01:12] walked in the darkness amen now the ly
[1:01:15] brother Brandon will say was the
[1:01:17] manifestation of that spoken word amen
[1:01:21] he said let there be Loy and the ly
[1:01:23] appeared so the L was was the
[1:01:26] manifestation of the spoken word and
[1:01:29] when the ly walked into the darkness the
[1:01:31] darkness had to pull away amen when the
[1:01:34] ly walked into the darkness the chaos
[1:01:37] had to begin to turn into an order amen
[1:01:40] when the when the ly walked into the
[1:01:42] darkness
[1:01:44] amen
[1:01:45] see right there at the beginning
[1:01:51] amen do you know why God said let there
[1:01:54] Bel
[1:01:54] light it was because he had some
[1:01:58] predestinated seed that he had
[1:02:01] planted are you with me he had some
[1:02:04] predestinated seed that he had planted
[1:02:06] right at the
[1:02:07] beginning but in the darkness those
[1:02:10] predestinated seed couldn't do
[1:02:12] anything amen but it had to take the
[1:02:15] spoken word to bring forth the Lo that
[1:02:18] will Quicken those spoken those seeds to
[1:02:21] manifest what was in them now brother
[1:02:23] Brandon was say it is in it is the
[1:02:24] rising of the Sun brother brandom would
[1:02:26] say well there was a time when the world
[1:02:28] was lying in order to Darkness it was
[1:02:31] with eight form and was void and was all
[1:02:34] covered with water and was lying there
[1:02:36] in the dark disma gloomy atmosphere and
[1:02:38] it said and the spirit of God moved upon
[1:02:40] the water and said let there below it
[1:02:43] God had a reason to do that for down
[1:02:45] beneath the water there were seeds that
[1:02:47] he had planted and it had to have the
[1:02:50] sun Loy to make it live and the first
[1:02:53] Loyd was ever given in the Earth was God
[1:02:55] spoken word the first light that ever
[1:02:58] struck the a was God's spoken word he
[1:03:00] said let there be light and there was
[1:03:02] light that turned Darkness into light in
[1:03:05] order to bring forth a creation of joy
[1:03:08] and life upon the Earth then the spirit
[1:03:10] of God as it moved with love and
[1:03:12] compassion at the great day the first
[1:03:15] day of the dawn of the creation upon the
[1:03:17] Earth the Sun Rose and swept across it
[1:03:20] raised and drw it up the waters from the
[1:03:22] earth and made an atmosphere above and
[1:03:26] for its first time it was to bring joy
[1:03:29] and life to the Earth but he seed that
[1:03:31] was a great hour amen and I believe that
[1:03:35] this evening I am speaking to some
[1:03:37] predestinated seeds amen I believe that

[1:08:49] thing that is going to hinder God or the

[1:08:57] unbelief amen that's the only thing that
[1:09:00] is going to pull God out of the story
[1:09:02] because you can go all the way back in
[1:09:04] the Book of Genesis amen listen Adam and
[1:09:08] Eve were under a perfect word amen God
[1:09:11] had walked in this story and they were
[1:09:12] only a perfect word but the moment that
[1:09:15] Eve disbelieved the word of God Amen the
[1:09:19] moment she disbel the word of God and
[1:09:21] believe the lawy of the enemy it caused
[1:09:24] God not to walk out of the story but to
[1:09:26] step out of the
[1:09:28] story amen he stepped out of the story
[1:09:31] and a CM was created between man and God
[1:09:36] Amen there was a Chasm created and and
[1:09:38] now the fellowship that they had was not
[1:09:41] there anymore amen something had
[1:09:43] happened sin unbelief has caused God to
[1:09:47] step out to the story but you see God
[1:09:50] was not willing for the story to end
[1:09:52] that way are you with me he was wasn't
[1:09:55] willing for the story to end that way
[1:09:58] amen and so God in his great love and
[1:10:02] mercies amen he put down his Royal
[1:10:05] clothes amen he took off his Royal
[1:10:07] clothes and he stepped down on Earth
[1:10:10] amen just as he did in the beginning
[1:10:12] amen when he stepped down by the moving
[1:10:14] of the spirit but this time he didn't
[1:10:17] step down by the moving of the spirit
[1:10:19] but he put on flesh amen he put on flesh
[1:10:23] and he walked back in the story again to
[1:10:27] redeem a man back to himself amen
[1:10:30] because the story that he began wasn't a
[1:10:33] story of defeat the story that he began
[1:10:36] Satan was not even in the picture amen
[1:10:39] but now Satan had come in the picture
[1:10:41] but God said Satan is not going to have
[1:10:43] the victory so I'm going to walk back
[1:10:46] and redeem my people and by doing that
[1:10:48] I'm going to show my attribute as a
[1:10:50] Healer I'm going to show my attribute as
[1:10:52] a savior I'm going to show my attribute
[1:10:54] as a red redemer amen and so he walks in
[1:10:57] and he takes on flesh
[1:11:00] amen he takes on flesh as the Son of
[1:11:07] God and he goes to the cross and he pays
[1:11:11] the
[1:11:12] price and I'm just keeping but after he
[1:11:15] pays the price he ascends to heaven when
[1:11:18] he ascends to
[1:11:20] Heaven his his beloved disciples
[1:11:25] began to think that he is walk out of
[1:11:28] the
[1:11:29] story are you with me are you following
[1:11:32] me this evening his disciples the people
[1:11:35] he had walked with and they've seen and
[1:11:37] they know that this is the
[1:11:40] Messiah now they were doubting and
[1:11:42] saying he's walk out of the
[1:11:45] story he's walk out of the story we
[1:11:48] thought that he was the Messiah we

[1:16:33] evening because of time but I want to go
[1:16:35] to another place I want to go to the
[1:16:37] place where he walks into the story of
[1:16:40] this age let's go to Revelation chapter
[1:16:43] 10 let's go to Revelation chapter
[1:16:46] 10 Revelation chapter 10 1 to3 now this
[1:16:50] is our age every age the messenger had
[1:16:53] walk in with Lord now in this age he has

[1:16:59] doing in all this he's
[1:17:01] restoring amen he's restoring man back
[1:17:05] to what he was in the original place in
[1:17:08] the Garden of Eden amen where he was in
[1:17:11] full control by the same spoken word
[1:17:16] amen so Revelation 10 it said and I saw
[1:17:19] another Mighty Angel come down from
[1:17:20] heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[1:17:23] rainbow was upon his head
[1:17:25] and his face was as it were the Sun and
[1:17:28] his feet as the pillar of fire brother
[1:17:30] Brandon who say who was that it was
[1:17:32] Jesus amen it was Jesus amen and it said
[1:17:36] and he had in his hand a little book
[1:17:39] open listen in Revelation chapter 5 when
[1:17:43] he walked in that story of redemption
[1:17:45] when he came he took the book it was
[1:17:47] closed but in this age he walks in the
[1:17:51] story of this age with an open book are
[1:17:54] you with me
[1:17:56] oh
[1:17:58] Hallelujah Glory with an open book and
[1:18:02] it said his right foot upon the sea and
[1:18:04] his left foot upon the air what is he
[1:18:06] declaring full
[1:18:08] Authority amen he's declaring full
[1:18:10] Authority amen and it said and cried
[1:18:13] with a loud voice as when a lion roed
[1:18:17] and when he had cried seven tunders
[1:18:19] ordered their voices so what was it what
[1:18:22] was happening the same Jesus
[1:18:25] amen the same Jesus that came Amen in
[1:18:29] the form of Flesh amen and doed on the
[1:18:32] cross and came in the form of the Holy
[1:18:35] Ghost Amen in the Son of God Ministry
[1:18:37] brother Brandon will say amen and walk
[1:18:40] through it Through the Ages that same
[1:18:43] that same Jesus walks in this age to
[1:18:47] finish the
[1:18:49] story and you are the ones that are
[1:18:52] called to finish the story
[1:18:59] the mighty
[1:19:00] Angel Jesus Christ himself brother
[1:19:03] brandom said that son of mine comes back
[1:19:06] again the son of mine Ministry what is
[1:19:09] that is not anything to complicated it
[1:19:11] is the same work of Jesus when he was
[1:19:13] walking here as a
[1:19:15] m that is all is a b the son of Mind
[1:19:17] Ministry is Christ in you doing his work
[1:19:21] amen you know sometimes we take we hear
[1:19:24] these words and sounds like just great
[1:19:25] it's
[1:19:26] not you just have to get into the
[1:19:28] message young people it's
[1:19:31] not but he walks in the story in this
[1:19:34] age amen and just as the beginning the
[1:19:37] spirit of God begin to move amen the
[1:19:40] spirit of God began to move you remember
[1:19:42] the beginning as we read the spirit of
[1:19:44] God moved amen and when it moved he
[1:19:46] spoke is that and when he spoke the Lord
[1:19:49] it was made manifest so just as it was
[1:19:52] in the beginning in this last age the
[1:19:55] spirit of God began to move upon the
[1:19:58] seventh angel messenger I just want you
[1:20:00] to catch a picture of the message that
[1:20:02] you believe
[1:20:03] in amen because that that is where your
[1:20:07] victories
[1:20:09] at that's the reason why the enemy is
[1:20:11] trying all he can to keep the young
[1:20:14] people from these messages to keep young
[1:20:17] people from digging into the
[1:20:19] message because he's making it so
[1:20:22] complicated making you think that you
[1:20:23] can't get it
[1:20:26] and he's making church services to be so
[1:20:28] boring for young
[1:20:30] people because we sit there and feels
[1:20:33] like it's all a bunch of mystery that we
[1:20:34] don't understand but I want you to
[1:20:37] understand what this message has come to
[1:20:40] do it's come to anoint
[1:20:45] you but you are only going to receive
[1:20:47] the anointing if you get under the
[1:20:50] message in other words if you begin to
[1:20:52] feed on that word
[1:20:56] that is the only way you're going to
[1:20:57] receive the strength to
[1:21:01] overcome amen because it is Jesus that
[1:21:05] is Walking In Your Story with the
[1:21:07] message of this
[1:21:09] age to cause you to finish your race in
[1:21:15] Victory amen but Satan is trying to get
[1:21:19] you to think that this message is not
[1:21:22] for
[1:21:23] you but but I'm here to say to you this
[1:21:25] message is for you whether you a 13 year
[1:21:29] old whether you a 20 year old whatever
[1:21:31] age you are this message is for you and
[1:21:35] if you get into it amen and ask God for
[1:21:39] Revelation he will give you
[1:21:41] Revelation he will give you Revelation
[1:21:44] and he'll make the message so real to
[1:21:46] you that you can't stop feeding on
[1:21:49] it amen because when you get to that
[1:21:52] place where you can't stop feeding on
[1:21:53] the message that is when the devil don't
[1:21:56] know what to do with
[1:22:00] you you see what the enemy been trying
[1:22:02] to do he's keeping you from your very
[1:22:05] weapon that you need to defeat
[1:22:12] him but the word is here this evening to
[1:22:14] expose the
[1:22:16] enemy to encourage some young people to
[1:22:18] say listen I have come to walk in your
[1:22:21] story
[1:22:24] listen before you came your story was
[1:22:27] already
[1:22:30] written your story was already
[1:22:33] written amen but now you couldn't
[1:22:36] fulfill that story in your own self so
[1:22:40] God himself comes in you to finish your
[1:22:49] story and the way he steps in you to
[1:22:51] finish the story is boy the message of
[1:22:54] Mali
[1:22:57] 4 because that's the end
[1:23:01] message
[1:23:03] amen so in this last age just as the
[1:23:06] spirit of God moved at the beginning
[1:23:08] amen and as it moved the word went forth
[1:23:11] so had the spirit of God moved in the
[1:23:13] sage upon that seven Angel messenger and
[1:23:16] that seven Angel messenger what did he
[1:23:18] do he spoke thus sayth the Lord amen and
[1:23:22] when he spoke th sayth the Lord as we

[1:23:59] oppression of the enemy that has been
[1:24:01] lying to them by condemnation amen
[1:24:04] telling them that they've gone too far

[1:24:10] day every mistake that they made the
[1:24:12] enemy is upon them telling them that
[1:24:15] they're not going to make it to the
[1:24:16] Rapture because of the mistake that they
[1:24:18] made yesterday but the message of God
[1:24:20] came in Hebrews and he said it is
[1:24:23] impossible it is impossible for the
[1:24:25] predestinated seed to be lost are you
