[11:07] eternal God, we are so grateful. We are
[11:11] so thankful for making a way for us to
[11:15] be here this morning. Lord, with one
[11:18] purpose, to receive your word, to hear
[11:21] from you. Lord, if you've come with any
[11:24] other motives, you're not going to be
[11:26] blessed. But our motive, Father God,
[11:29] that the word of God will be spoken to
[11:31] the hearts of your children. That no one
[11:34] will live in the same way they came. But
[11:37] Lord, that the word will draw us closer
[11:39] to you. Oh God, we pray for our precious
[11:43] Pastor Danny. That may you continue to
[11:45] use him as never been before. Oh God, we
[11:49] are here to bless your name. Oh my soul
[11:52] and all that is within me, oh God, to
[11:55] give you to give you all the glory and
[11:57] the honor because you alone deserve the
[11:59] glory. You alone deserve the praise. You
[12:02] alone deserve to be worshiped. There is
[12:05] none beside you and there's none before
[12:07] thee, oh God. When you say yes, no one
[12:10] can say no, oh God. And you have that
[12:13] confidence that you do it again and
[12:15] again and again, Lord. Last last week I
[12:19] heard about that young man from Africa
[12:21] when you delivered him oh God from death
[12:24] when you secure him you make a way that
[12:26] he didn't die his faith rose up and said
[12:29] the God that could deliver me from that
[12:31] can do it again and I can do all things
[12:34] through Christ so our confidence that
[12:36] Lord you have done it before and we
[12:39] expecting and we know you are here with
[12:41] us and you come and speak to the needs
[12:44] of everyone here oh God that the word of
[12:47] God will take prevenence and bless every
[12:51] soul here, the visitors that they won't
[12:54] live here the same, but they will go, oh
[12:57] God, with a different different thing,
[12:59] Lord, to drawing closer to you once and
[13:03] for all. Father, we thank you for the
[13:05] songs of Zion. May you take our precious
[13:08] brother Antonia aside and all the
[13:11] helpers that help him that Lord that the
[13:14] rest will join and sing from the depth
[13:16] of their heart. Father we are here with
[13:18] one purpose to hear from thee. Father
[13:21] God anything almighty we come against it
[13:26] in the name of Jesus Christ. May you
[13:29] have the preeminence. Bless every
[13:32] officer, the deacons, the tris, the
[13:35] Sundays, the teachers, every aspect of
[13:37] the service. Oh God, we commit it into
[13:40] thy hand. Your word clearly says that
[13:43] you should bring offering and thighs to
[13:45] thy house. And Lord, this is the only
[13:47] thing that you gave us to test you with
[13:50] if you not open the windows of heaven to
[13:52] bless. Oh God, as the people are giving
[13:55] the offering and the thanks from the
[13:57] depth of their heart, may you bless
[14:00] everyone that giving Lord and those that
[14:02] you have the desire to give, bless their
[14:05] heart desire so that Lord, they will be
[14:07] blessed abundantly so that next time
[14:10] they can also give because we have that
[14:13] assurance that you said that you bless
[14:16] even more exceedingly and abundantly
[14:20] more than what the people can even think
[14:23] or imagine that's a God that we are
[14:25] serving, a God of abundance and we are
[14:29] so grateful that you can be associated
[14:31] with this mighty God. Thank you. Bless
[14:35] every aspect of the service, our pastor
[14:37] celebration. May everything go on
[14:39] perfectly well in Jesus name. Amen.

[39:08] were really blessed to be there. I thank
[39:10] God for brother um Jack. Amen. And
[39:14] brother Eugene, they were there as uh
[39:17] supporters. Amen. And uh it really was a
[39:21] blessing. Brother Dale, God bless him
[39:23] for what he does. He has a heart for the
[39:26] people. He desires to bless people, to
[39:29] uh to give and to do um what he can for
[39:32] the body of Jesus Christ. And I'll tell
[39:34] you, we were very well fed. I couldn't
[39:38] believe it when I was driving into his
[39:39] property. There was a hundred cows.
[39:43] And he says, "And brother, they bring
[39:44] forth a hundred cows every year. Those
[39:47] are all females." I said, "Praise God. I
[39:50] seen the baby calfs there." I said,
[39:53] "Wow, what an operation." You know, talk
[39:56] about a farmer for the for the glory of
[39:59] God. And so, may God bless him and
[40:02] prosper his uh his ministry and continue
[40:05] to use him uh for for his glory and for
[40:09] his honor. Amen. We want to continue to
[40:12] remember Sister Sheila as she's uh in in
[40:16] recovery mode after having the brain
[40:18] surgery. And I'm trusting um that she is
[40:21] going to be up here giving testimony of
[40:23] how God supernaturally did a a
[40:26] tremendous um uh operation on her and
[40:30] she's going to she's I talked to her
[40:32] this week. She's talking beautifully.
[40:35] She's talking like normal. She says,
[40:37] "Brother, you know, God truly has done
[40:40] miracles." Amen. And we believe in a
[40:43] miracle working God. So, let's continue
[40:46] to pray for our dear sister and um it's
[40:51] time for us to go to the word of God.
[40:53] How many's excited about the word? I
[40:55] trust that you came with an expectation.
[40:58] Sure, we're going to have some
[40:59] fellowship after. We're going to get
[41:00] together. We're going to have lunch. But
[41:02] right now, we're going to feast on the
[41:04] word of God. And I trust that if you've
[41:07] got a pull in your heart to receive from
[41:09] the Lord, he'll give you something.
[41:11] Amen. I believe that with all of my
[41:13] heart because this is not a a a a man
[41:16] ministry. This is this is a Christ in
[41:19] the present stage of his ministry. Amen.
[41:22] And so we just want to be vessels
[41:24] yielded unto him. And I trust that you
[41:26] will receive your blessing. Let's all
[41:28] stand as we go to the word of God.
[41:31] Amen.
[41:34] Let's pray. Father, as we change the
[41:36] order of the service now, Lord, we're
[41:38] asking that your spirit would come.
[41:41] Lord, as a man, I have studied, I have
[41:45] uh read and gone into the depths of your
[41:48] word to the best of my ability. And
[41:51] Lord, I know that my ability, I I I I
[41:55] feel uh unworthy most of the time, Lord.
[41:58] But I I can only trust in the in the
[42:01] gift and in the call and the the desire
[42:04] of the people and the needs of the
[42:06] people and that you will come and take
[42:08] control. Lord, anoint this vessel to
[42:11] speak words that will inspire the hearts
[42:14] of your children. Lord, we commit this
[42:17] service and all that are present. Lord,
[42:19] those that are listening in online, may
[42:21] they receive, may they be blessed, Lord.
[42:24] We give you praise and we give you all
[42:27] the glory in Jesus name. Amen. Praise
[42:30] God. And so um we'll read our scripture.
[42:33] It's from the book of Revelation. It's
[42:35] the same scripture we read last week,
[42:37] chapter 8 verse one. It says, "And when
[42:40] he had opened the seventh seal, there
[42:44] was silence in heaven about the space of
[42:48] half an hour." Amen. You may be seated.
[42:54] and go to the next slide. So, um we've
[42:56] been talking on uh a series of being
[42:59] under authority that when we recognize
[43:02] the authority of God's word in our day
[43:05] and recognize what it is that God is
[43:07] doing in our day, then we come under
[43:11] that by by uh submitting ourselves to
[43:15] the word for our day just like every
[43:17] other age. It's this this is nothing
[43:20] new. every age. Just like when the
[43:21] reformation started back in the 1500s
[43:24] and John West or uh um uh Martin
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Luther, I'm sorry, uh Martin Luther
[43:35] caught the revelation that the just
[43:37] shall live by faith and he came under
[43:40] that to the point where he made it his
[43:43] supreme authority. It it it pulled him
[43:46] away from the Catholic Church. Amen. And
[43:49] today we've got Lutheran churches all
[43:51] over the world. Amen. Because he
[43:53] recognized his day and the message. But
[43:55] the word didn't stop there. It continued
[43:57] to progress. And so here we are here now
[44:01] in 2025.
[44:03] Um we've come through uh the
[44:06] reformation. John Wesley caught his part
[44:09] on on justification on sanctification.
[44:13] Amen. that uh you know that you got to
[44:15] just you can't just claim Christ and not
[44:18] have a a sanctified life. You know, I
[44:22] mean, we don't we don't claim our own
[44:24] righteousness. We claim his
[44:26] righteousness, but we come subject to
[44:28] his word where we allow the word to take
[44:32] control and have preeminence in our
[44:34] lives. Amen. And so, um, he recognized
[44:37] his day and then the Pentecostal
[44:39] movement was the was the was the spirit
[44:42] of God now coming down on the church to
[44:45] restore the gifts to the church. And and
[44:48] on Isuza Street there was a great
[44:50] outpouring of his spirit and it brought
[44:52] forth another revival which was the
[44:55] continuation of the reformation of the
[44:59] word of God. And then God sends a
[45:00] messenger to each one of those ages like
[45:03] he did with Martin Luther, like he did
[45:05] with John Wesley. And who does he send
[45:08] to the Pentecostals? William Branham.
[45:11] Amen. A messenger under a prophetic
[45:14] ministry to restore the the the word
[45:17] that had been scattered because there
[45:20] was there was uh so many different
[45:22] teachings on the word of God. But God
[45:25] says, "I will restore." Amen. and he
[45:28] restored the word back to the original
[45:31] faith of the fathers. Amen. Praise God.
[45:34] And that's what we're feeding on to this
[45:36] day. We are feeding on the original word
[45:39] of God. People ask us, "Well, what is
[45:41] Good Neighbor Ministries all about?"
[45:43] Well, we're a non-denominational church
[45:47] that is basically the continuation of
[45:50] the book of Acts.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; And it's not the acts of the disciples.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; No, sir. It's not the acts of the
[45:57] people, but it's the acts of the Holy
[46:00] Ghost
[46:01] &gt;&gt; in the people that when Jesus said, "I
[46:04] will send you the comforter, which is
[46:07] the Holy Ghost, and he will guide you
[46:10] into what?
[46:11] &gt;&gt; All truth."
[46:12] &gt;&gt; All truth. Amen. Not some of the truth,
[46:14] but all of the truth.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Praise God forever more. And so, this is
[46:20] what we are feasting on in this day and
[46:22] in this hour. the living mystical uh
[46:25] body of Jesus Christ. And so we were
[46:28] looking at this and we were looking at
[46:30] you know understanding our existence
[46:32] because what we've come to and I hope
[46:34] you've come to realize this through this
[46:36] series that we are we are living in
[46:39] realms of existence
[46:42] &gt;&gt; and that uh this is what has been uh
[46:45] going on right from the very beginning
[46:47] of time. Amen. Right from the very
[46:50] beginning, before there was time, God
[46:53] was was operating and and and producing
[46:57] realms of existence where we could
[47:00] actually understand who we were in that
[47:03] particular time and season. And when we
[47:06] were in God, we were his attributes. We
[47:10] were thoughts in his mind because he was
[47:13] the self-existent one right from the
[47:16] very beginning.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he condescended this great
[47:21] plan of redemption which produced these
[47:24] realms of existence that we have been
[47:28] moving through, operating in and being
[47:33] influenced by.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So these realms that are around
[47:38] us, you know, light, matter, time,
[47:43] the ether,
[47:45] the fifth dimension, which is the
[47:47] dimension of of death and hell. It's
[47:50] where it's it's a dimension where
[47:52] there's an there's a dark influence
[47:55] that's coming upon the people. And that
[47:57] influence is very strong in the land
[47:59] right now. And then we know of the sixth
[48:02] dimension which is the dimension of the
[48:04] redeemed. Those that receive Jesus
[48:08] Christ in their day under their
[48:10] dispensation and they die. Christians,
[48:14] they don't go to the fifth dimension
[48:17] which is death and hell. Amen. And I'm
[48:20] not talking about a burning hell. Our
[48:22] prophet made it very clear that that it
[48:25] wasn't a burning hell or an eternal
[48:27] hell. It was like in it was like in
[48:30] comparison because he actually was
[48:32] allowed to see it.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; He was able to break dimensions. Amen.
[48:37] That's what a prophet has the ability to
[48:39] do. That's why he could talk to somebody
[48:41] and tell them what the doctor said, tell
[48:43] them where they lived. He could see in
[48:46] another realm, in another dimension
[48:48] where there was no time or space, and he
[48:50] could look into yesterday and look into
[48:52] tomorrow. Amen. That's what a prophet
[48:55] has the ability to do. Praise God. And
[48:58] so, um, we see here that this this realm
[49:04] that we're living in right now is being
[49:06] affected by all these other realms. And
[49:09] then there's the seventh dimension. And
[49:12] this is the final, you know, part of
[49:15] this series that we're going to be, you
[49:17] know, finishing up on here. We're going
[49:19] to be looking at how the seventh
[49:20] dimension which you know if you go to
[49:23] the next slide it says it's it's it's
[49:26] the existence of God. It's where God
[49:30] exists. It's it's the place where it
[49:34] says here it says the seventh dimension
[49:35] is where God is. Amen. God dwells in the
[49:40] seventh dimension and it's just another
[49:43] realm. It's heaven is not a place that's
[49:46] a million miles away. Everybody, you
[49:48] know, they they look at heaven as being
[49:50] somewhere up there or they look at hell
[49:51] as being somewhere down there. I'm
[49:53] telling you that we are living in a
[49:55] dimension that experiences both heaven
[49:58] and hell.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; A lot of people, unfortunately, are
[50:03] living in a hellish existence.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; And when I say that, I don't mean it
[50:08] like in a in a in a you know, where
[50:10] there's all these monsters and
[50:12] everything else, but they're living
[50:13] underprivileged lives. They're being
[50:15] affected by this dimension of the fifth
[50:18] dimension where the enemy is constantly
[50:21] bombarding our minds, telling us that
[50:24] we're not sons and daughters of God,
[50:26] telling us that we're that God didn't
[50:28] save us, telling us that God can't heal
[50:31] us, telling us that we're to live in
[50:33] poverty, telling us all the things that
[50:35] that that try to keep us in a in a in a
[50:39] condition where we're miserable.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. But God wants you to
[50:44] come up higher.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Come up and live in the dimension that
[50:48] he's created for you in the word of God
[50:51] that gives you the ability by the Holy
[50:53] Ghost to recognize your inheritance.
[50:57] What he has for you, what you can
[50:59] experience as a son or a daughter of
[51:01] God.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; You should be the happiest people on
[51:04] earth.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. I like it when I hear
[51:08] John Simon, you know, he's telling me
[51:10] when we talk on a regular, he says,
[51:11] "Brother, I'm just rejoicing to know
[51:15] that the Lord, you know, that that he's
[51:17] allowed me to see this word and to live
[51:20] in this great liberty of the Holy
[51:22] Spirit." Amen. Praise God. I believe
[51:25] that we can all experience that
[51:28] &gt;&gt; if we accept what God has done for us in
[51:30] our day and we come under the leadership
[51:33] of the word for our day and for our
[51:36] hour. Amen. Praise God. And so one day
[51:39] his kingdom will come down on earth.
[51:43] And this is the this is the process. You
[51:46] know, it says one day, but I'm telling
[51:48] you that it's this day.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you that we are already
[51:52] being changed. We're already being
[51:54] caught up. When you hear them say that
[51:56] we were in heavenly places, I trust this
[51:59] morning you'll move into heavenly
[52:00] places.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; You'll have the ability to move into the
[52:04] word where all things are possible. You
[52:07] can you can you can take your
[52:09] circumstances and say, "Lord, I'm
[52:11] placing them into your hands this
[52:13] morning
[52:14] &gt;&gt; where you can take it, Lord, and and and
[52:16] dissolve these situations. Dissolve this
[52:19] sickness. Dissolve this oppression.
[52:22] Dissolve this depression that the enemy
[52:24] constantly bombarding our minds with.
[52:26] You can you can experience it this
[52:28] morning.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; That's why we come into the house of the
[52:32] Lord. We're not coming here to just play
[52:34] church and sit down and listen to a good
[52:37] sermon. We want to experience God.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to experience his presence
[52:42] and his ability to to lift the
[52:45] oppression of the enemy to lift and to
[52:48] place us where we are rightfully called
[52:51] as sons and daughters of the living God.
[52:53] Amen. Praise God. And his kingdom,
[52:56] heaven and earth will embrace together.
[52:59] Everything will get back to eternity.
[53:02] All those with eternal life.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Which is the Holy Ghost.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; In them will enjoy their existence
[53:13] in his presence.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; So this this is the existence that we're
[53:21] now moving towards. This is the
[53:24] existence that that little by little
[53:26] we're being changed. Amen.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so let's read our scripture
[53:31] here as we continue. Our next slide is
[53:34] from the book of Revelation. We're going
[53:36] to be looking at Revelations 10 1-7.
[53:40] And um you know our our title for the
[53:42] last couple weeks is that the seventh
[53:45] seal completes the rapture dispensation.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So let's look at let's look at how
[53:52] this, you know, unfolds, you know. And I
[53:55] saw another mighty angel come down from
[53:57] heaven, clothed with a cloud, and a
[54:00] rainbow was upon his head, and his face
[54:03] was as it were the sun,
[54:06] and his feet as pillars of fire, and he
[54:09] had in his hand a little book.
[54:13] A lot of people don't talk about this
[54:15] book,
[54:16] but this is a very important little
[54:19] book.
[54:21] And and and so let's let's just see. And
[54:24] he set his right foot upon the sea and
[54:27] his left foot upon the earth and cried
[54:31] with a loud voice as when a lion roarth.
[54:34] And when he had cried, seven thunders
[54:39] uttered their voices.
[54:41] And when the seven thunders had uttered
[54:43] their voices, John now speaking because
[54:46] this is John
[54:48] at the in the aisle of Patmos in a
[54:50] vision. And we need to see that God is
[54:53] revealing to him these things. So he's
[54:56] speaking what he is seeing. Amen. So
[55:00] don't put a chronological order on
[55:02] things. Don't place things. You know,
[55:05] that's why people have so much trouble
[55:07] understanding the book of Revelation.
[55:10] But it is exactly that. It is a book of
[55:14] revelation.
[55:15] &gt;&gt; And revelation means it's got to be
[55:17] revealed.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; It's a book that it's the book of the
[55:21] revelation. If you read right from
[55:23] Revelations, it's the book of the
[55:26] revelation of Jesus Christ.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; And so, seven thunders had uttered their
[55:32] voices. I was about to write and I heard
[55:35] a voice from heaven saying unto me,
[55:36] "Seal up those things which the seven
[55:39] thunders uttered and write them not."
[55:42] Next slide. And the angel which I saw
[55:45] stand upon the sea and upon the earth,
[55:49] lifted up his hand to heaven, and swear
[55:52] by him that liveth forever and ever, who
[55:55] created heaven, and the things that
[55:58] therein are, and the earth, and the
[56:00] things that therein are, and the sea,
[56:03] and the things which there there are
[56:07] therein, that there should be time no
[56:12] longer. Imagine
[56:16] this angel which I'm telling you and
[56:19] saying to you that this is God himself,
[56:23] Jesus Christ.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; He was the one that had the white wig
[56:27] back in the book of Revelations chapter
[56:30] 1. He's the one that's clothed with the
[56:33] white wig. He's the judge. He's Elohim.
[56:38] He's the self-existent one. He's the
[56:40] seventh dimension
[56:44] coming down
[56:46] &gt;&gt; to join with the sons and daughters of
[56:50] God.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says, "Time shall be no
[56:54] more." Now, you know that time only came
[56:59] as a result of the fall
[57:01] &gt;&gt; back in the Garden of Eden.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Because time is a direct correlation to
[57:06] death. If there was no death, there'd be
[57:09] no time.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; He says, "Time shall be no more." So
[57:14] something is is is taking place where we
[57:18] are actually because the rapture takes
[57:21] us from this time dimension
[57:24] into an eternal dimension into eternal
[57:28] bodies.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; This is the transition. We've all heard
[57:33] about the rapture. We talk about the
[57:36] rapture. People post pictures of the
[57:38] rapture. But then there's a reality to
[57:40] the rapture.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; And that is that we are going to be
[57:45] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[57:47] an eye from this dimension of light,
[57:52] matter, and time into the sixth and to
[57:57] join with the seventh dimension in order
[58:00] to experience what we were supposed to
[58:02] experience in the beginning. Amen.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; We're going to look at that. And so he
[58:07] says here, "Time shall be no longer, but
[58:10] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[58:13] angel, when he shall begin to sound, the
[58:16] mystery of God, the mystery of God
[58:22] should be finished,
[58:23] &gt;&gt; as he hath declared to his servants, the
[58:27] prophets." Amen. And so I want to
[58:31] emphasize the mystery of God. God had a
[58:35] desire from before the foundations of
[58:38] the world that he would express himself
[58:42] here on the earth and that he would have
[58:46] sons and daughters of God that he would
[58:49] uh join with. He's always had that
[58:52] desire from before the foundations of
[58:55] the world. Right when he was right when
[58:57] we were attributes in his mind that was
[58:59] his desire. Amen. Let's read the next
[59:03] slide. This is a quote from brother
[59:04] Brandham.
[59:06] He says, "God's great mystery of how
[59:09] it's a secret.
[59:11] He kept it a secret. Nobody knowed
[59:14] nothing about it. Even the angels didn't
[59:17] understand it." See, he didn't reveal
[59:20] it. That's the reason under our seventh
[59:24] mystery when the seventh seal
[59:27] was opened there was silence. We read
[59:31] the scripture that on the opening of
[59:33] that seventh seal there was silence in
[59:35] heaven.
[59:36] Before that there was rejoicing there
[59:39] was singing. There was praising. Why?
[59:41] Because he was in heaven.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; He was seated on the throne. But on the
[59:47] opening of that seventh, there was
[59:49] silence because he had to go deal with
[59:52] Revelations 10 1-7.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; He had to leave his throne in order to
[1:00:00] fulfill this very scripture so that the
[1:00:05] church in this age would recognize it,
[1:00:10] that it would be his coming. Many are
[1:00:12] looking for his coming.
[1:00:15] thinking that he's still to come,
[1:00:19] but he's already come.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; And look what he says. He says there was
[1:00:26] silence. Jesus when he was on earth,
[1:00:29] they wanted to know when he would come.
[1:00:34] Now you got to understand Jesus was the
[1:00:38] word made flesh.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. He was under
[1:00:44] the word plan of redemption
[1:00:48] where he needed to create a body for
[1:00:50] himself. That's why the scripture says
[1:00:53] Emmanuel
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[1:00:57] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:01:00] us. Who was that? It was Jesus Christ.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; So when he was on earth, they wanted to
[1:01:06] know when he would come.
[1:01:09] And he said it's not even the son
[1:01:12] himself don't know when it's going to
[1:01:14] happen
[1:01:17] because he was now in a time body
[1:01:21] and he was he was subject and under the
[1:01:24] the scripture says that in Hebrews that
[1:01:27] he became obedient to the word. He
[1:01:30] became obedient to what the word said he
[1:01:33] was to do. And he was to go to Calvary
[1:01:37] as a man and die for our sins. That's
[1:01:40] why this whole process of us being
[1:01:44] restored back to our to our rightful
[1:01:47] position as sons and daughters of God
[1:01:49] requires him to come and to prove that
[1:01:53] he could he could be uh uh living in
[1:01:57] light
[1:01:59] matter took on a body that was created
[1:02:04] not by sex.
[1:02:08] He couldn't he couldn't come because he
[1:02:10] had to be a sinless sacrifice.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; And the original sin back in the Garden
[1:02:16] of Eden, we don't got time to go into
[1:02:17] all the depths of it, but the original
[1:02:19] sin was an adultery.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Eve
[1:02:24] wanted to bring forth sons and daughters
[1:02:26] of God under the perverted word that was
[1:02:29] given to her by the serpent that said,
[1:02:31] "Ye shall be like God
[1:02:34] in order to create." And so she went and
[1:02:38] made love with the serpent. Two children
[1:02:41] were born, Cain and Abel. Where does
[1:02:44] Cain get the the the the character to be
[1:02:47] a murderer?
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; The Bible says Jesus even him says you
[1:02:53] are of your father the devil. When he
[1:02:55] was telling all those that were were
[1:02:57] saying that we are children of Abraham,
[1:02:59] your father the devil who was a liar and
[1:03:02] a murderer from the beginning.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:08] That serpent seed brought forth a race
[1:03:12] of people here on the earth
[1:03:15] that broke the continuity and the
[1:03:17] program of God's original plan which
[1:03:20] brought death until Eve
[1:03:24] committed that sin. They were eternal.
[1:03:27] Their name was called Adam. They had
[1:03:30] dominion over the earth. They could
[1:03:32] replenish the earth. How? by the spoken
[1:03:34] word. That's why the Gab Gabriel, the
[1:03:37] angel Gabriel comes to the Virgin Mary
[1:03:40] and says, "Thou shalt bring forth a
[1:03:42] son."
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Because God required a sinless body. But
[1:03:47] yet, it had to come into time
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; and it had to grow. It had to age. It
[1:03:53] had to go to Calvary as a man.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Forever more.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And so so he he could he
[1:04:03] he would not he did not even know the
[1:04:06] plan that was coming forth.
[1:04:10] He was in the garden of Gethsemane and
[1:04:14] even got to the point as a man. He says,
[1:04:16] "Father, if you can lift this, lift it
[1:04:19] from me." But then he turned, he says,
[1:04:22] "But no, thy will be done, not my will."
[1:04:26] And you see, as long as you're in this
[1:04:28] body of flesh and you're not born again
[1:04:31] by the spirit of God, you're subject to
[1:04:34] the world, to the to the sin, to the
[1:04:38] corruption, to the to the uh um
[1:04:40] influence of of all that's taking place
[1:04:44] here on earth. You you you'll get thrown
[1:04:46] into gender identity confusion. You'll
[1:04:49] get thrown into all kinds of different
[1:04:51] things. But when you receive the Holy
[1:04:54] Ghost,
[1:04:56] It leads you and guides you into all
[1:04:58] truth. Amen. Praise God. And so it's a
[1:05:01] secret. And that's the reason there was
[1:05:03] silence in heaven for the space of half
[1:05:06] an hour. And the seven thunders uttered
[1:05:09] their voices. And John was not even he
[1:05:12] was he was even forbidden to write it.
[1:05:14] See it was the coming of the Lord. Amen.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; So what was happening in 1963
[1:05:21] was that the mighty angel himself, God
[1:05:24] himself was now descending to come down
[1:05:28] and take on the body of the bride of
[1:05:33] Jesus Christ to unite with his body.
[1:05:37] Amen. So go to the next slide
[1:05:41] and you'll see here that this cloud like
[1:05:44] you see us wearing this cloud pin here.
[1:05:47] We don't wear it because we're we're
[1:05:48] we're part of some society.
[1:05:52] We wear it because it represents a very
[1:05:55] significant event that took back place
[1:05:58] back in 1963.
[1:06:01] And it was I saw another mighty angel
[1:06:04] come down from heaven clothed with a
[1:06:06] cloud. And brother Brandham said that
[1:06:08] that cloud was the angels that were in
[1:06:12] the sixth dimension that were actually
[1:06:15] bringing him into a manifestation here
[1:06:18] on the earth.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was the coming of the Lord. We
[1:06:24] can talk about this that happened back
[1:06:26] in 1963 all day long. But let me tell
[1:06:29] you, I just came to realize that this
[1:06:32] date and the coming of the Lord in 1963,
[1:06:37] it only means something to you if he's
[1:06:40] come to you today.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; That's why you can show this to people.
[1:06:47] You can tell them, go and read it. It's
[1:06:49] in the just do a Google search,
[1:06:50] supernatural cloud. There's all kinds of
[1:06:53] articles that were written, not
[1:06:55] religious articles,
[1:06:57] actual scientific articles that prove
[1:06:59] that this cloud should not have been
[1:07:01] there. They don't understand it. It was
[1:07:04] written into Life magazine back in 1963.
[1:07:09] This is something that that that
[1:07:10] happened and you could you could get all
[1:07:13] the research on it and you could you
[1:07:15] could get all you know the the
[1:07:16] information on it but it it'll mean
[1:07:18] absolutely nothing to you because the
[1:07:22] significance is that Christ is
[1:07:25] personally coming down to unite with his
[1:07:28] individual
[1:07:30] sons and daughters of God.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what makes this a
[1:07:38] significant event
[1:07:40] to those that that recognize what God
[1:07:43] has done in the opening of this seventh
[1:07:47] seal and the fulfillment of Revelations
[1:07:50] 10 1-7.
[1:07:52] Now, William Brham was a prophet. He had
[1:07:55] a son of man ministry here on earth that
[1:07:59] was vindicated by God to fulfill
[1:08:03] scripture. And at the time of this
[1:08:06] event, William Brham was on Sunset
[1:08:09] Mountain. So happened to be
[1:08:12] where the sun was coming to set.
[1:08:16] And it was the son of man, Jesus Christ,
[1:08:20] coming to unite with a son of man for
[1:08:24] the purpose of the opening of the seven
[1:08:26] seals. Amen.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; And he opened those seals
[1:08:33] in 1963 over a period of 7 days in March
[1:08:37] of 1963.
[1:08:39] And yet under that seventh seal, when
[1:08:42] they opened that seventh seal, there was
[1:08:44] silence.
[1:08:46] So there was something written under
[1:08:48] that seventh seal that's of importance.
[1:08:54] It's very important for us to recognize
[1:08:58] why God the angels when they spoke when
[1:09:02] the angels spoke to John and said write
[1:09:04] it not there was an element that was
[1:09:07] under that seventh seal mystery under
[1:09:11] those seven thunders that were meant
[1:09:13] only for you and me in this day. Amen.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; It's the element of the unwritten part
[1:09:22] of the word of God that you and I
[1:09:25] receive
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; and we can't we can't put an
[1:09:28] interpretation on it.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; We can't explain it.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; That's why you were in a certain church,
[1:09:35] you know, like I just go back myself 31
[1:09:38] years ago, I was not even in church. I I
[1:09:40] was a Catholic. I go to church once a
[1:09:42] year, maybe twice a year, and a wedding
[1:09:44] every now and then or a baby baptism.
[1:09:48] That was my experience.
[1:09:50] But yet when I heard this word, this
[1:09:54] message
[1:09:56] coming forth from that man back there,
[1:09:58] John Simon, who was a minister anointed
[1:10:01] to bring the word in his day and in this
[1:10:04] hour, there was an element of that word
[1:10:07] that I could not quite put my finger on.
[1:10:10] But all I knew was that it's the truth.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; It's the truth.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; It rings with something within me. Amen.
[1:10:19] And there's something in you that was
[1:10:21] placed there from before the foundations
[1:10:23] of the world. It's the word of God.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; You were placed inside of you was placed
[1:10:29] a portion of God's word.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; And when the time of your word, like it
[1:10:35] talks in the book of Psalms where
[1:10:37] Joseph, he was chained in prison. But
[1:10:40] the Bible says, "But then the time for
[1:10:42] his word came." There was a time when
[1:10:44] the word had to be awakened within
[1:10:47] Joseph to recognize the hour that he was
[1:10:50] living in and and to realize that God
[1:10:53] was not a silent God,
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; but God was working personal. God was
[1:10:59] going to use Joseph to deliver the whole
[1:11:02] nation of Israel from a time of death.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Praise God forever more.
[1:11:11] And so we need to realize when the
[1:11:14] coming of the Lord
[1:11:16] comes to you personal, this makes total
[1:11:20] sense.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; The word unveils itself.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, you you you start
[1:11:26] reading the word and you start to see
[1:11:29] things in the word of God. And you'll
[1:11:31] talk to somebody that you know that
[1:11:32] might be a Christian and you'll show
[1:11:34] them certain parts of the word like I'm
[1:11:36] showing you here, the the the seven
[1:11:38] thunders. They were they were not
[1:11:40] written. They But yet the thunders is
[1:11:43] the voice of God.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; We know that the thunder represents the
[1:11:47] voice of God, but yet it was sealed up.
[1:11:49] So there's something within there that
[1:11:51] needs to be unveiled. What is it that's
[1:11:53] being unveiled? The simplicity of you
[1:11:56] receiving the word for your day and it
[1:11:59] and it coming into your life and
[1:12:01] transforming you out of the situation
[1:12:04] and the condition that you were in.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Glory to God.
[1:12:08] That's what the word does.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Don't be looking. Listen, I'm not
[1:12:12] preaching some mysterious element here.
[1:12:15] The half hour of silence. I'm telling
[1:12:17] you that the unwritten part of the word
[1:12:20] of God is what you are now feeding on.
[1:12:23] It's the literal mind of God. It's the
[1:12:26] revelation of God. It's the thoughts of
[1:12:29] God. What he meant that that that that's
[1:12:32] why the Bible says the letter kills.
[1:12:36] But get the Holy Ghost
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; and it becomes alive.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden when I talk to you and I
[1:12:43] say baptism in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:12:45] immediately you go to the Bible, you
[1:12:47] read the book of Acts, you see that
[1:12:49] there's over three or I think 8,000
[1:12:52] baptisms in the book of Acts.
[1:12:56] Every one of them in the name of the
[1:12:57] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:13:00] And you look at it, he says, "Of course
[1:13:01] it makes perfect sense because the Lord
[1:13:04] Jesus Christ is the Lord of the Old
[1:13:07] Testament, Jesus of the New, and Christ
[1:13:10] the anointed spirit of God now in you."
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what Christ represents, the
[1:13:17] anointing of the spirit of God himself.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so, let's go to to
[1:13:26] our next slide here.
[1:13:28] Now in the in the message the seventh
[1:13:31] seal, William Brandham says we must
[1:13:33] remember that this seventh seal is the
[1:13:37] end of time of all things.
[1:13:40] When I read that just recently, I
[1:13:43] thought
[1:13:45] all things.
[1:13:47] So this seventh seal,
[1:13:51] it's unveiling.
[1:13:54] It hasn't stopped. It's going to end all
[1:13:57] things. That's right. He says, "The
[1:13:59] things written in the sevensealed book
[1:14:02] sealed up of the plan of redemption from
[1:14:06] before the foundation of the world, it
[1:14:09] every bit ends."
[1:14:12] I thought, "Wow."
[1:14:14] You know, you could you could look at
[1:14:16] the seventh seal and you could look at
[1:14:18] it as just the seal that basically calls
[1:14:21] you into the age that you're in. calls
[1:14:25] you out of the age that you're in. Calls
[1:14:28] you to the to the to the recognition of
[1:14:31] the word for your day in the age that
[1:14:33] you're in.
[1:14:35] That's why the thought came to me, the
[1:14:38] seventh seal
[1:14:40] completes the rapture dispensation
[1:14:44] because
[1:14:46] all things includes the rapture
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; and it includes the element of our day.
[1:14:54] Amen.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; The part that we are to be connected
[1:14:58] with, the part that concerns you and me,
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; brother. I don't want to be in
[1:15:03] confusion.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; I want to understand the element of the
[1:15:06] word and what it is that it's going to
[1:15:08] produce in me, how it's going to change
[1:15:11] this church, how it's going to change
[1:15:13] the body that's right here that's coming
[1:15:16] and feeding on the word every Sunday,
[1:15:18] every Wednesday, coming in to receive
[1:15:21] God's word. and and and we could hear
[1:15:23] all kinds of of teachings on the word of
[1:15:26] God, but we want to zone in. We want to
[1:15:29] hone in. We want to realize that, hey,
[1:15:31] the rapture is the portion of the word
[1:15:34] that we fulfill.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; And this is now in progress. This is the
[1:15:39] next thing that needs to happen. Every
[1:15:41] other prophecy has been fulfilled.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Praise God forever more. A lot of people
[1:15:47] get confused when they look back at, you
[1:15:49] know, the prophets, you know, seven
[1:15:51] visions and and the vision of the, you
[1:15:53] know, like uh like I heard it yesterday
[1:15:55] and I I was blessed from it, you know,
[1:15:57] where a lot of people are looking and
[1:15:59] and they've been waiting for a for a,
[1:16:02] you know, because the prophet had a
[1:16:03] vision and he said it could be a a
[1:16:05] female president that would be in the
[1:16:09] United States that would rise up. But
[1:16:11] then he also said that it's, you know,
[1:16:12] it could that that that that it's the
[1:16:14] it's the Catholic Church. It's it
[1:16:16] because female represents the church
[1:16:20] and and that church has dominion and
[1:16:23] control. You know, they've got
[1:16:25] hierarchies and and they've placed
[1:16:26] themselves in such a position on the
[1:16:29] earth and there's things that are taking
[1:16:31] place right now. That scripture that
[1:16:35] that prophecy has already been fulfilled
[1:16:38] if you actually look at it.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; You look at you know that he said that
[1:16:42] there'd be self-driving cars. This is 70
[1:16:45] years ago.
[1:16:47] Well, guess what?
[1:16:50] Yesterday on my way back from Sarnia, my
[1:16:54] truck has autopilot.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; I said, "Lord, I need to feast and study
[1:17:02] and be prepared for tomorrow." You know
[1:17:04] what I did when I got on the 403? I
[1:17:06] threw it into autopilot.
[1:17:09] And I'm telling you, it works. Amen.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; I've used it. I was driving for a solid
[1:17:16] hour in autopilot. The only thing I had
[1:17:18] to do because there's a camera on my
[1:17:20] truck that watches my eyes. And if if if
[1:17:24] you go into autopilot and you start
[1:17:27] talking to your
[1:17:29] passenger and you're talking away, it's
[1:17:31] still driving. It was catching every I
[1:17:34] was going, man, I was surprised. I was
[1:17:36] going through construction areas on the
[1:17:38] 401 as I'm coming to the 403 and it was
[1:17:41] it was going it was following the lines.
[1:17:43] It was like I'm watching.
[1:17:46] I said, "Man, are you kidding me? This
[1:17:48] thing is that it's it it works." I'm
[1:17:51] telling you, I was I was saying, "Wow,
[1:17:54] it's fulfilled."
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; We're experiencing it. These things have
[1:17:59] been fulfilled. The only thing that's
[1:18:01] left is the perfecting of the bride.
[1:18:05] that last one that that whose name was
[1:18:07] written in the lamb's book. You know
[1:18:09] that little book that he's got open in
[1:18:11] his hand that he comes to bring to the
[1:18:14] to the to John that he tells it because
[1:18:15] if you read on he tells John to take the
[1:18:18] book
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; take the book and eat the book
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; because in that book contains the
[1:18:23] revelation of every son and every
[1:18:25] daughter of God that needs to hear this
[1:18:28] word.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Read it in Revelations 10:8-11.
[1:18:32] After you eat the book, you need to
[1:18:34] prophesy. What's prophesy? Minister,
[1:18:36] preach. Give a testimony. Tell the
[1:18:39] people what God has done for you. Tell
[1:18:41] the people about Malachi 4:5. Tell the
[1:18:44] people about Revelations 10:1-7. What
[1:18:46] God has done in our day because they
[1:18:49] need to hear this word. There's a last
[1:18:52] son or daughter of God out there. And
[1:18:54] they don't have to catch every
[1:18:57] revelation.
[1:18:59] Oh, they got to catch the revelation of
[1:19:01] the opening of the word. Let me tell
[1:19:03] you, if you catch this revelation
[1:19:06] genuinely, the word's been open to you.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; That's it. That's one revelation. That's
[1:19:12] all you need because the rapture is a
[1:19:15] revelation
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; and it places you into the body of Jesus
[1:19:20] Christ.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; So, we're looking for that last one.
[1:19:23] We're excited about what how God is
[1:19:25] going. Because look, don't tell me you
[1:19:28] don't look at the conditions of the
[1:19:29] world and you don't see a world that's
[1:19:31] going into tribulation.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; It's a mess out there. I'm not saying
[1:19:36] there's going to be nuclear bombs that
[1:19:38] are going to drop next week or or you
[1:19:40] know that that we're going to go into a
[1:19:41] complete and total World War II right
[1:19:44] away. No, I'm telling you that the
[1:19:47] corruption and the falling apart of the
[1:19:50] world is right from the political to the
[1:19:53] right from the political grounds to the
[1:19:57] highest levels of churchianity and
[1:19:59] religion.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; It's all corrupted.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; They're all trying to figure out God.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; That's why God had to send a prophet in
[1:20:08] the 20th century. That's why God had
[1:20:11] People say, "You following a man? Are
[1:20:13] you following a man? Why you you follow
[1:20:15] what? Is this some kind of a cult? Well,
[1:20:18] just ask the Lutheran. Are you following
[1:20:20] some sort of a man?
[1:20:22] Go to the Catholics and they'll tell you
[1:20:24] the Pope.
[1:20:26] They got 500,000 young people right now
[1:20:29] today
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; that are gathered in Italy
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; in a place
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; to worship the pope
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; and to and to celebrate young people in
[1:20:44] the pope.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:20:48] This is
[1:20:51] something saints that that that we need
[1:20:53] to realize the the the level of
[1:20:55] deception
[1:20:57] that is in place right now. Remember the
[1:20:59] scripture said it would be so deceiving
[1:21:02] that it would deceive even the very
[1:21:05] elected of God
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; if it were possible. It's not possible.
[1:21:10] That's why don't worry
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; when you hear the true word of God
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; that representation inside of you will
[1:21:17] say amen to the word
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; I ask a person I say you got the Holy
[1:21:21] Ghost they go of course I said how are
[1:21:24] you baptized
[1:21:26] I was baptized as a baby I said I can
[1:21:29] show you in the scripture that that baby
[1:21:31] baptism doesn't even exist Jesus himself
[1:21:34] said he that believeth and is baptized
[1:21:38] shall be saved
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; now Do you think that the Holy Ghost who
[1:21:41] wrote the word, the scriptures written
[1:21:43] by men that were moved by the Holy
[1:21:45] Ghost?
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Moses could never have written what took
[1:21:48] place back in the Garden of Eden unless
[1:21:50] the spirit of God went into him,
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; took and started to write.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that. And the
[1:21:58] scripture says it. All inspiration is
[1:22:00] given by the Holy Ghost.
[1:22:04] And if an angel comes down from heaven,
[1:22:06] Paul said, and says anything different
[1:22:09] than what's written here,
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; let him be cursed.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; And I turn around and say, "So you were
[1:22:14] baptized as a baby." Okay. Well, can you
[1:22:18] show me scripturally where God will
[1:22:20] recognize that by the word? Now, I'm not
[1:22:23] saying baptism saves you.
[1:22:27] It all depends where you and what you
[1:22:30] receive in the day that you're receiving
[1:22:33] the word.
[1:22:35] If you're an attribute son or daughter
[1:22:38] of God, you could never be lost
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; because you were always a son of God.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Anything that comes from God is eternal.
[1:22:46] Cannot have death.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; They will go back to who they were
[1:22:51] before the foundations. And Job even
[1:22:53] said it. Where were you when the sons of
[1:22:56] God rejoiced around the throne?
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Because we were in his mind before we
[1:23:03] were expressed here into an earthly body
[1:23:06] on earth. Amen. And so if the Holy Ghost
[1:23:11] is in somebody, they're going to say
[1:23:13] amen to the word of God. It's as simple
[1:23:15] as that. There's no excuse. And I'm not
[1:23:18] going to say that you're lost if you
[1:23:20] don't agree with it.
[1:23:22] No, it may not be your time for the word
[1:23:24] to open up to you
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; because many were trying to convert me
[1:23:28] and and and and convince me that I
[1:23:31] needed to receive Jesus Christ. That I
[1:23:33] needed for years. I had employees that
[1:23:36] would come to me and tell me, "Danny,
[1:23:38] you need to come to my church. You need
[1:23:40] to accept Jesus Christ. You need to you
[1:23:42] need to be born again." I I I heard it
[1:23:44] all. And I and at one point, I had to
[1:23:46] tell one guy, I said, "Just that's
[1:23:48] enough. Quiet. I don't want to hear it
[1:23:50] no more." I said, this is what I said to
[1:23:52] him. I said, "If God wants me, he'll
[1:23:54] come to me, not you."
[1:23:57] Boy, did I open my mouth.
[1:24:01] I imagine one of those, you know, you
[1:24:03] know, you you've got like ministering
[1:24:05] angels around you.
[1:24:09] I got one now. I'm going to talk to the
[1:24:12] Lord's angels right now. He wants God to
[1:24:15] slap him right in the head. And let me
[1:24:18] tell you, when God came, it was an
[1:24:20] awakening, saints. It was a reality.
[1:24:22] Nobody could tell me that God was not
[1:24:24] real.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; And until you come to a place where his
[1:24:29] word becomes a reality to you, then then
[1:24:32] then then you're just a church member.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So here he goes and he and
[1:24:38] and he says it every bit ends. It is the
[1:24:41] end. It is the end of the struggling
[1:24:43] world. It is the end of struggling
[1:24:46] nature. It's the end of everything in
[1:24:49] there is the end of the trumpets. It's
[1:24:51] the end of the vials. It's the end of
[1:24:53] the earth. It's the end of time. And
[1:24:58] when you read that, you think, "Holy
[1:25:00] smokes, wait a minute here. This ends
[1:25:02] everything." Yeah. Well, go read
[1:25:04] Revelations 21. And there was a new
[1:25:07] heaven and a new earth.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says, "Come, let me show
[1:25:12] you the lamb's bride because there's
[1:25:15] going to be there's still 1,000 years
[1:25:18] left on the earth, saints. The Bible
[1:25:21] talks about a 7,000year plan, then the
[1:25:25] new heaven, then the new earth." So,
[1:25:28] yes, the seventh seal. And what is the
[1:25:32] seventh seal? I just told you it's the
[1:25:34] coming of the Lord.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that. It was now God
[1:25:39] coming down to the earth in order to
[1:25:42] unite with the earth. His his plan and
[1:25:46] his mystery from the very beginning has
[1:25:49] always been to unite with man.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Next slide. I don't want to get ahead of
[1:25:58] myself. And the angel said, "Time will
[1:26:00] be no more." When that in the days of
[1:26:03] this great thing to happen, everything
[1:26:06] runs out in this time, the end of at the
[1:26:10] end of the seventh seal. Notice it's the
[1:26:12] end of the church age.
[1:26:15] We recognize that years ago when brother
[1:26:18] John Simon would be ministering that we
[1:26:21] are no longer in the Leodysian church
[1:26:23] age. We have transitioned into the
[1:26:26] eternal church age. Because after seven
[1:26:29] comes 8, which is new beginning,
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; the holy convocation. There's so many
[1:26:35] types throughout the Bible.
[1:26:38] And so we have we we we are now already
[1:26:41] beyond the seventh church age. We're
[1:26:43] we're actually experiencing the bride
[1:26:46] age. This is the age for the for for Eve
[1:26:49] to be restored. Amen. Adam came the the
[1:26:52] the second Adam came 2,000 years ago. He
[1:26:56] had to take on a body of flesh to prove
[1:26:59] that he could live in this dimension. To
[1:27:02] prove that he could restore his church,
[1:27:04] he could restore his body. He could
[1:27:07] restore Adam back to the way that he was
[1:27:10] from the beginning. But he had to come
[1:27:12] first
[1:27:14] and pay the penalty
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; because he could never go against his
[1:27:18] own word that said, "If a man sin, a man
[1:27:20] must die."
[1:27:22] God can't change his word. He's the same
[1:27:24] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:27:27] And so, it's the end of the trumpets.
[1:27:30] It's the end of the vials at the end of
[1:27:31] the ushering in of the millennium. Look
[1:27:33] at that. And that's where it just broke
[1:27:36] open even more to me. And I said, "Yes,
[1:27:38] exactly."
[1:27:40] It brings everything to an end. But for
[1:27:44] us, our end temporarily is the body
[1:27:48] change, which takes us for a three and a
[1:27:50] half year honeymoon in that sixth
[1:27:54] dimension with the redeemed.
[1:27:57] William Brham was able to go to that
[1:28:00] dimension. God took him there. He met
[1:28:04] those that were redeemed, that had
[1:28:06] received Jesus Christ in their day under
[1:28:09] their dispensation.
[1:28:11] every church age had an opportunity to
[1:28:14] receive the word for their day.
[1:28:18] And when they received it, they died and
[1:28:22] they immediately went to the sixth
[1:28:25] dimension where the redeemed were to
[1:28:29] reject and to and to and to say we don't
[1:28:33] want it. We don't accept Jesus Christ.
[1:28:36] Their
[1:28:38] change at death takes them right into
[1:28:40] the fifth dimension, which is the place
[1:28:43] of death.
[1:28:45] Is the place where it's not a fun place.
[1:28:50] But they're stuck there until the time
[1:28:53] of the white throne judgment when
[1:28:55] everybody will be risen up to be judged
[1:28:59] according to the works of the flesh.
[1:29:03] You see, you that's received the word
[1:29:05] for your day by receiving Christ into
[1:29:08] your life, your old life gets washed.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; It gets completely wiped out
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; as though you never did it in the first
[1:29:18] place.
[1:29:20] It's such a wonderful revelation of
[1:29:22] deliverance to be set free from and and
[1:29:26] sin. People think sin is smoking,
[1:29:29] drinking, cheating, lying, stealing.
[1:29:32] Those are the attributes of sin.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Those are the things that happen when
[1:29:38] you disbelieve the word of God.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Just by the fact that you dis just by
[1:29:42] the fact that you go to somebody say you
[1:29:45] believe in a trinity
[1:29:48] because there's no such thing as a
[1:29:49] trinity.
[1:29:51] The word trinity is not even in the
[1:29:52] Bible.
[1:29:54] There's one God.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Hear ye, oh Israel, the Lord thy God is
[1:29:59] one,
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; not two.
[1:30:03] One.
[1:30:05] The Lord of the Old Testament. If Jesus
[1:30:07] Christ, Jehovah
[1:30:10] of the New Testament
[1:30:13] and now the Holy Ghost is in you, Jesus
[1:30:17] Christ in bride form in the bride age
[1:30:22] manifesting Jesus Christ in the
[1:30:25] simplicity of the word.
[1:30:28] Amen. Praise God. So here it ends and it
[1:30:32] ushers in the millennium because
[1:30:35] he is the word. The seventh seal is the
[1:30:39] word and the word is progressing and
[1:30:42] taking us line upon line, precept upon
[1:30:44] precept unto the fulfillment of every
[1:30:49] scripture according to the plan of
[1:30:52] redemption.
[1:30:55] It puts out five stars. One of those
[1:30:58] stars explodes and blows out five stars
[1:31:00] from it. And then one of them stars
[1:31:03] explodes, blows out five stars from it.
[1:31:05] It fades on out. Then the seventh seal,
[1:31:08] it just ends the time for the world. It
[1:31:11] ends the time for this. It ends the time
[1:31:14] for that. It ends the time for this. It
[1:31:17] ends the time. Everything just ended up
[1:31:19] on that seventh seal. Praise God. And
[1:31:24] the part of what we're looking to to be
[1:31:27] completed now is the rapture.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; That portion of the seventh seal.
[1:31:35] So here now, let's read on
[1:31:43] next slide. That one thing he hasn't
[1:31:46] revealed yet on how he will come and
[1:31:49] when he will come. It's a good thing
[1:31:52] that he doesn't. It's a good thing that
[1:31:54] he doesn't. No, he has shown or revealed
[1:31:57] it in every type
[1:32:00] that's in the Bible.
[1:32:02] Do you know that the mystery of God
[1:32:05] which was for him to unite with man was
[1:32:08] revealed in every type right from
[1:32:11] Genesis all the way to the book of
[1:32:12] Revelation.
[1:32:17] No, he has showed or revealed it in
[1:32:19] every type that's in the Bible.
[1:32:21] Therefore, the entire Bible is the
[1:32:24] revelation of God's mystery in Christ.
[1:32:27] And when we talk about Christ, I want
[1:32:30] you to understand the word Christ.
[1:32:33] Christ means anointed.
[1:32:37] It doesn't necessarily mean Jesus
[1:32:40] Christ.
[1:32:41] Jesus Christ
[1:32:44] 2,000 years ago was the anointed word in
[1:32:49] a human body made flesh. That's why when
[1:32:52] he goes to Peter after coming down from
[1:32:55] praying on the mountain, Matthew chapter
[1:32:57] 16, you'll read it there. He says, "Who
[1:33:00] do the people say that I am?"
[1:33:03] Some people were saying, "Oh, you are
[1:33:05] Jeremiah, one of the prophets risen up.
[1:33:07] You could be one of these prophets." He
[1:33:10] looks and turns to Peter and he says,
[1:33:12] "Who do you say that I am, Peter?"
[1:33:15] He turns around and says, "Thou art the
[1:33:18] Christ,
[1:33:21] the son of the living God." In other
[1:33:23] words, you are the anointed word, the
[1:33:26] Messiah for our day.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; You are the word made flesh in our day.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; He was now. And then look what look what
[1:33:36] Jesus turns around and says to him. He
[1:33:37] says, "Peter, flesh and blood has not
[1:33:42] revealed this to you. You didn't get
[1:33:43] taught this from your pastor, from your
[1:33:46] Sunday school teacher, from your mama or
[1:33:48] your anything. Flesh and blood hath not
[1:33:51] revealed this, but my father," and
[1:33:55] people take that, they say, "See, Jesus
[1:33:56] said he had a father." No, the father
[1:34:00] was the self-existent one. Jesus was
[1:34:04] interdimensional.
[1:34:06] God came down and took on a human
[1:34:08] vessel. The word in the beginning, the
[1:34:11] Bible says, in the beginning was the
[1:34:13] word and the word was with God and the
[1:34:15] word was God. And the word was made
[1:34:19] flesh and dwelt among us.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; And so that's why he says to Philip,
[1:34:27] Philip says, Lord, show us the father.
[1:34:29] He says, Philillip, if I've been with
[1:34:30] you so long, if you see me, you see the
[1:34:33] father. Amen.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; It's not I that doeth the works, but the
[1:34:37] Father that dwelleth
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; in me. He doeth the works.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; On that day ye shall know that I am in
[1:34:45] the Father, the Father in me, and I in
[1:34:48] you.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; You see, you see this is all about God.
[1:34:53] The mystery of God is to unite with man.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; And he says here, therefore, the entire
[1:35:00] Bible is the revelation of God's mystery
[1:35:02] in Christ. Huh? The entire Bible is an
[1:35:06] expression of one goal that God had, one
[1:35:09] purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[1:35:11] entire Bible. And all the acts of the
[1:35:14] believers in the Bible has been a type
[1:35:18] and expressing what God's great goal is.
[1:35:22] And now in this last day,
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; he has revealed it and shows it.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; And God's help, well, you'll see it
[1:35:32] right here. s this morning what the Lord
[1:35:34] has had in his mind all along and has
[1:35:40] expressed it. Now, William Branham, this
[1:35:43] is back in 1963.
[1:35:46] This message Christ the mystery of God
[1:35:48] revealed it. It basically breaks down
[1:35:52] the whole plan of redemption that God
[1:35:56] was above us. God was in with us with
[1:36:00] Jesus Christ and now God is in us in
[1:36:03] this day and in this hour.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; If the same spirit that raised Christ
[1:36:08] from the dead dwells in you, it will
[1:36:12] quicken this mortal body, it'll move it
[1:36:16] your molecules. It'll change the
[1:36:18] molecules of your body and it'll
[1:36:20] translate you into another realm or
[1:36:23] dimension. Amen.
[1:36:26] It's the rapture.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; That's the spirit that we want. That's
[1:36:33] the word that we want to receive. So,
[1:36:36] here now he says uh uh next slide
[1:36:40] in God's provided place of worship. We
[1:36:43] read this last week, but we're winding
[1:36:45] down now. And I want to bring a couple
[1:36:46] of types here. I want us to see how God
[1:36:49] was expressing himself right from the
[1:36:52] book of Genesis. Right from before,
[1:36:53] right, right from the very beginning.
[1:36:54] Listen, listen. When God created Adam
[1:36:58] and he said, "Let us make man in our
[1:37:03] image and he expressed Adam." Adam was
[1:37:07] in the image of God and he was God
[1:37:13] expressed
[1:37:15] in an image. That's all he did. He took
[1:37:19] attribute
[1:37:20] from himself.
[1:37:22] He took that attribute and he expressed
[1:37:25] it. And when he expressed it, he said
[1:37:29] male and female
[1:37:32] and called their name Adam. So he was
[1:37:35] actually God. Then
[1:37:39] he takes Adam, puts him into a sleep
[1:37:44] because now he's changing his realm of
[1:37:46] existence. Now he's going from totally
[1:37:50] God
[1:37:53] to God
[1:37:56] in a matter body because what does he
[1:37:59] do? He takes matter,
[1:38:01] the dust of the earth, and he breathes
[1:38:04] within that dust the breath of life,
[1:38:07] which is what? Himself.
[1:38:10] And now he's in a light matter body.
[1:38:16] that he can actually now he's he's
[1:38:18] condescending into his plan. This is all
[1:38:21] part of his plan.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; And then he says it's not good for Adam
[1:38:24] to be alone. He knew that in Adam was
[1:38:28] Eve.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; He knew that because God is male and
[1:38:32] female. They're perverting it in the
[1:38:34] world
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; and they're coming up with all this
[1:38:36] gender identity crisises and everything
[1:38:38] else because Satan is perverting the
[1:38:41] original word. Remember his job is to
[1:38:43] pervert the word
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; to take what is truth and just pervert
[1:38:47] it slightly becomes poison.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; God is male and female.
[1:38:54] So he puts Adam now into asleep and he
[1:38:57] takes from his side a rib from the womb
[1:39:01] of the man. I know you've heard this
[1:39:02] before, but I'm I I want you to just be
[1:39:05] fresh in your mind as we close here. And
[1:39:08] he takes this rib from the womb of the
[1:39:11] man and creates the woman
[1:39:19] and then Adam calls her name Eve.
[1:39:24] Do you know that right there and then
[1:39:26] when he called her Eve, which if you
[1:39:29] look up the word Eve, it means mother of
[1:39:31] all living, he knew that she was going
[1:39:33] to fall. that there would be mothers,
[1:39:37] fathers, children that would come as a
[1:39:40] result of her now because she was now
[1:39:45] expressed in the image of Adam. They
[1:39:49] were male and female. God tells them,
[1:39:52] "This is good." That's why you go to
[1:39:55] Genesis chapter 2, we read it last week.
[1:39:57] He says, "This is good." And God went
[1:40:00] and rested.
[1:40:02] He went and rested on the seventh day.
[1:40:05] The Bible says that he rested because he
[1:40:07] saw that everything that was that that
[1:40:09] he did, he looked at Adam. He looked at
[1:40:11] Eve. He says, "It's very good." He says,
[1:40:14] "Go and take authority,
[1:40:18] have dominion,
[1:40:20] multiply, replenish the earth." Do you
[1:40:23] know that all Adam had to do was look at
[1:40:25] Eve and say, "Bring forth Desmond."
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; Attributes of God. We were with him
[1:40:31] before. But he wanted to he want
[1:40:32] remember he wanted this expression. God
[1:40:36] in Adam he he wanted to express this
[1:40:40] this this level of existence. He had he
[1:40:43] had experienced Adam in the form of that
[1:40:46] of that of that uh uh eternal existence.
[1:40:49] But now he wanted to express it not only
[1:40:52] in in an eternal existence but he wanted
[1:40:54] to have fellowship. He wanted to see. He
[1:40:56] wanted to express. He wanted his family
[1:40:59] now to be the sons and daughters of God,
[1:41:01] having dominion over the earth. That
[1:41:03] whatever they would speak, they would it
[1:41:06] would it would just be. And that's why
[1:41:08] when Adam would name the animal, it's
[1:41:10] because he was God.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; He could speak the animal's name because
[1:41:15] he was God. But then the fall comes and
[1:41:19] now Adam and Eve are no longer time,
[1:41:22] matter, and eternal in a theophony body
[1:41:27] because that's what they were in.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; That body that God created for them was
[1:41:31] the theophony body because it was
[1:41:33] created by God. It was an eternal body.
[1:41:37] And so now all of a sudden time comes
[1:41:39] into the whole picture.
[1:41:41] And now all of a sudden there's got to
[1:41:43] be another dimension that God has to
[1:41:46] create because death came in. It came in
[1:41:51] because of the sin of the serpent right
[1:41:53] from the beginning. God has to create a
[1:41:55] realm of existence now for the fallen
[1:41:57] angels. And by the way, those first
[1:42:00] angels that God created,
[1:42:03] they were living in some sort of a realm
[1:42:05] of existence.
[1:42:06] We can't explain everything. But they
[1:42:10] had to have been under free moral agency
[1:42:12] in that realm of existence.
[1:42:15] They could not be they were created.
[1:42:18] Remember, anything that's created has a
[1:42:20] beginning, will have an end. Sons and
[1:42:22] daughters of God. They come from God.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; They're they are God.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; We are messiahes.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Okay? In in true expression.
[1:42:33] But those angels, they had free moral
[1:42:36] agency. Otherwise, they could not have
[1:42:38] fallen. And that's why God had to create
[1:42:40] a realm for the fallen angels. But God
[1:42:43] also had a realm for the angels that
[1:42:45] were under the obedience of the word of
[1:42:47] God that had not fallen, that had not
[1:42:50] been taken down by Lucifer. It's all I
[1:42:54] know this is, you know, there's a lot
[1:42:55] here, but I want you to see something.
[1:42:58] Amen. He says, listen here, in God's
[1:43:01] provided place of worship,
[1:43:04] but he promised just before the coming
[1:43:06] of the end time, the world would get
[1:43:08] like it was in Sodom when a man came
[1:43:11] down in human form,
[1:43:14] three of them, two angels and God
[1:43:17] himself.
[1:43:20] Genesis 18,
[1:43:22] that was God. The Bible says it was. Now
[1:43:25] he came down and he manifested himself
[1:43:28] there by turning his back to the tent
[1:43:30] where Sarah was. Go back and read
[1:43:32] Genesis 18 and told Abraham what Sarah
[1:43:35] was thinking in the tent. That's right.
[1:43:38] Congregation says, "Amen." Now Jesus
[1:43:40] himself said, "At that day, at the day
[1:43:43] when the son of man is being revealed,"
[1:43:46] in other words, the son of man, the
[1:43:48] ministry of Jesus Christ himself, this
[1:43:52] was going to repeat itself. Listen. When
[1:43:54] Melzdc
[1:43:56] in Genesis 18, having no mother, no
[1:44:00] father, no beginning, no end, you know
[1:44:02] who that was, right?
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; It was Jesus Christ.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; A lot of people say, "Well, wait a
[1:44:08] minute. He was Jesus in the Old
[1:44:09] Testament." No, he you got to understand
[1:44:12] it's him, the self-existent one. when
[1:44:14] Paul was on the road to to to to
[1:44:17] Damascus and the angel knocked him off
[1:44:19] his high horse and Paul and this is
[1:44:22] after the death of Christ. Remember,
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; he had already given up the ghost. The
[1:44:26] resurrection had already taken place,
[1:44:28] but Paul gets knocked off his horse and
[1:44:31] he says, "Lord, who art thou?"
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Go read it.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; It's in every single Bible in in the
[1:44:37] world right now. It said,
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; "It is I, Jesus." Amen.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; He had gone back to who he was before he
[1:44:45] came down.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; He's the self-existent one. He is the
[1:44:49] one and only God. Amen.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; It's proving to you that God was was
[1:44:54] moving. And here in type form in Genesis
[1:44:57] 18, that was God come down in human
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; in a theophony body. He broke bread. He
[1:45:05] ate meat. He drank milk with Abraham.
[1:45:10] Praise God. We're going to have some
[1:45:12] good times in our new bodies. Let me
[1:45:14] tell you,
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; we're going to have a feast, brother.
[1:45:16] Let me tell you. Glory to God. We are
[1:45:18] going to get stimulation like we've
[1:45:20] never had before.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. He He came down and
[1:45:25] look, that was like his first coming to
[1:45:28] Abraham.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; It was like when Jesus came the first
[1:45:31] time. It was a public show. He comes
[1:45:34] there with three men. Two of them he
[1:45:36] sends into Sodom.
[1:45:38] Brother Brandham said those two men that
[1:45:41] that because brother Brandham says a
[1:45:43] greater than Solomon is here. Who do you
[1:45:45] say this is? Go back and study the life
[1:45:47] of William Brandham. You'll see the
[1:45:49] supernatural that took place around his
[1:45:51] life. It'll prove to you that Jesus
[1:45:53] Christ, the son of man, came down to a
[1:45:57] son of man
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; to to to reindicate the word to show the
[1:46:02] things that he would do that he promised
[1:46:05] that he would do. And then look, he
[1:46:07] comes to Abraham. He tells Abraham,
[1:46:09] "You're going to have a son."
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that son is going to
[1:46:14] come through your wife Sarah.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; And Sarah was 90 years old. Glory to
[1:46:19] God. I don't know, 80 years old,
[1:46:20] whatever it was. But then you go to
[1:46:22] Genesis 21 and you'll notice that that
[1:46:25] that Jehovah, God, Elohim, the Lord, he
[1:46:28] goes now, he doesn't go to visit
[1:46:30] Abraham.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; He goes to visit Sarah. Amen.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; It didn't say what he told her. It
[1:46:36] didn't tell everything that that that he
[1:46:38] had to say to her. But it says in
[1:46:40] Hebrews 11 that Sarah received faith
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; to bring forth the promise of God. Amen.
[1:46:47] And God has a people in this hour.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; In this day that that's going to receive
[1:46:51] faith through the open word of God,
[1:46:54] through the mighty angel that has come
[1:46:55] down in human form. Amen. that has come
[1:46:59] down to take possession of human vessels
[1:47:02] once again to fulfill his word. And he
[1:47:05] promised that we will bring forth the
[1:47:07] son of God, Jesus Christ,
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; in bride form. Amen.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; Sarah was a type. She received the faith
[1:47:14] to bring forth the promise of the word.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; We are Listen, whenever you talk about a
[1:47:19] woman in the Bible, it's the church.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; And Sarah was a type of the church.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And he says now Jesus
[1:47:29] himself said at that day when the son of
[1:47:32] man is being revealed in other words the
[1:47:34] son of man the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:47:36] let's go to the next slide he says the
[1:47:39] church
[1:47:41] will come through justification Luther
[1:47:44] through Luther we talked about that
[1:47:46] through sanctification through Wesley
[1:47:49] through the baptism of the Holy Ghost or
[1:47:51] the Pentecostals and go right on into
[1:47:54] the perfection of the son of man.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; And look what he says that when husband
[1:48:01] and wife will be the son, the same self
[1:48:05] persons, he's talking about Jesus Christ
[1:48:08] and his church.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; God will be so manifested in his bride,
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; his church,
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; till they will both be the same. They
[1:48:20] are one. Now you see where we're at.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; Now do you see where we're going? Amen.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to say to you, go back
[1:48:29] and listen to who is this Melzdc.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; I'm going to finish here today by
[1:48:37] reading a quote from that message that
[1:48:41] should clarify to us what it is and how
[1:48:44] it is that that that we are now being
[1:48:47] changed.
[1:48:49] We are now in in translation. We are now
[1:48:53] line upon line as you receive this
[1:48:56] message as the word comes forth and you
[1:48:59] you you listen, you read, you study, you
[1:49:02] go back, you see that yes, it's the
[1:49:04] truth. Yes, I see the type in in in in
[1:49:07] Sarah. Yes, you can go back and read
[1:49:10] about Rebecca. I had notes on Rebecca
[1:49:12] here. When when God, you know, when when
[1:49:14] God goes to Abraham in Genesis 24, he
[1:49:18] goes to Abraham. God, that's another
[1:49:21] thing alto together. Praise God. But you
[1:49:23] know that brother Bram said that that
[1:49:25] was a type of the rapture
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; when Eleazar was sent forth to get a
[1:49:29] bride
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; for Isaac.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. She was listen
[1:49:36] Rebecca. She was under she was under the
[1:49:38] anointing of the seventh seal.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; She was under the anointing of the of
[1:49:42] the unwritten word. because you know uh
[1:49:44] he gets all excited and he says oh god
[1:49:47] he says what if he says to Abraham he
[1:49:49] says Abraham what if what if she doesn't
[1:49:51] want to come what if what if you know
[1:49:54] she doesn't he says don't worry he says
[1:49:57] the God the angel of the Lord that led
[1:49:59] me
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; and made every one of those promises
[1:50:02] he's going to go before you oh glory to
[1:50:05] God amen sent forth his angel
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; he has sent forth the mighty angel
[1:50:11] himself you don't have to worry you
[1:50:13] can't fail.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; You got to receive the word.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; There's a part in you like Rebecca.
[1:50:19] Listen.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Eleazar says, "Lord, let it be that when
[1:50:22] I go to the well that when I ask her to
[1:50:25] to to to give me a drink, that she's
[1:50:27] going to she's going to say, not only am
[1:50:29] I going to give you a drink, I'm going
[1:50:31] to give your your camels a drink."
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; This is what he said. And he says, "Oh
[1:50:35] Lord, please let and let that be the
[1:50:37] one." Oh, glory to God. Let me tell you,
[1:50:39] God's got a people right now
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; that have recognized the word. We don't
[1:50:43] have to. She she knew because the the
[1:50:47] scripture says that the angel of the
[1:50:49] Lord, not the scripture, but brother
[1:50:51] Brandham said that the angel of the Lord
[1:50:54] got there and I think there is a
[1:50:55] scripture for it that met
[1:50:58] Rebecca a half an hour before
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; he actually arrived there. Amen. Amen.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; Right in that half hour of silence, she
[1:51:07] was receiving word.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; She was receiving the inspiration of the
[1:51:11] unwritten part of the word to know what
[1:51:14] to do with the word to recognize that
[1:51:16] who she was that she was actually the
[1:51:19] bride of Isaac. She didn't realize that
[1:51:21] she was the bride of Isaac, but in her
[1:51:23] was a revelation of who she was. Amen.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Because the angel of God had revealed it
[1:51:29] by revelation. You're not going to get
[1:51:32] this by reading the Bible.
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're only going to get it by
[1:51:35] receiving the Holy Ghost and reading the
[1:51:37] Bible.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; I'm going to end it on this quote here.
[1:51:45] Go to the next slide.
[1:51:48] We are called of God
[1:51:51] and high priest after the order of
[1:51:53] Melzdc.
[1:51:54] There's an order to our restoration
[1:51:59] that we are going to be restored back.
[1:52:02] And here now he says here
[1:52:09] I'm just going to read it. I didn't put
[1:52:12] it up
[1:52:14] on on on the slide
[1:52:17] but I'm going to read it to you. He says
[1:52:20] now in this is from who is this Melzdc?
[1:52:22] Let the musicians come.
[1:52:24] He says, 'Now we see the attribute sons
[1:52:27] of his spirit have not yet entered into
[1:52:30] the word form body,
[1:52:34] but a theophony.
[1:52:36] This body is subject to the word
[1:52:40] and earnest waiting for the earnest, the
[1:52:43] change of the body. Now the difference
[1:52:46] between him and you as a son. See he was
[1:52:50] at the beginning the word
[1:52:53] and morphe body he came in and lived in
[1:52:57] that body in the person of Melzdc. Then
[1:53:00] later we never heard no more of Melzdc
[1:53:04] because he became Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; You see, he was moving
[1:53:11] interdimensional.
[1:53:13] And that's why Jesus when he came to the
[1:53:15] earth,
[1:53:17] he was there there was no sin in him. He
[1:53:19] was not affected by sin. He had dominion
[1:53:23] over sin. That's why when he would walk,
[1:53:25] the devils would rise up and say, "Lord,
[1:53:28] are you here before our time?"
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; They recognized who he was.
[1:53:34] The people that were calling him
[1:53:35] Beelzebub didn't recognize who he was.
[1:53:38] Imagine the people that were supposed to
[1:53:40] recognize him called him a devil and the
[1:53:42] devils themselves said, "Lord, are you
[1:53:44] here before your our time?
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus."
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; You see, he was Jesus Christ. And and
[1:53:52] and uh he goes on here. He says, "Then
[1:53:54] later, we never heard no more. He became
[1:53:56] Jesus Christ. Melzdc was the priest, but
[1:53:59] he became Jesus Christ. Now you bypassed
[1:54:02] that because that form he knowed all in
[1:54:06] that form he knowed all things but you
[1:54:08] never been able to know.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; You bypassed your word body when you
[1:54:13] came to this earth.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; You didn't get to the part where you
[1:54:18] could actually live in the realm
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; of God in a theophonic body.
[1:54:26] You bypassed that. You bypassed the
[1:54:29] word. You came into a human body.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; You had to be born as a baby.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; You had to go through spiritual amnesia
[1:54:37] not knowing who you were.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; And then and then and then at a certain
[1:54:41] time the word was going to come to you,
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; the seed that was in you. It was the
[1:54:48] time for your word. the time that your
[1:54:51] part in the word because remember we
[1:54:53] read that that that that that uh the the
[1:54:55] mystery of God was being acted out in
[1:54:58] all of the believers in that particular
[1:55:01] time.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; And there's a portion of the word in you
[1:55:05] that must come into manifestation. The
[1:55:09] earth is groaning for the manifestation
[1:55:13] of the sons and daughters of God.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; That's what the scripture says.
[1:55:19] And so you bypass that. And he goes on,
[1:55:22] you come like Adam, like me. You became
[1:55:26] from the attribute to the flesh
[1:55:29] to be tempted. But when this life is
[1:55:32] finished here, if this earthly
[1:55:35] tabernacle be dissolved, we have one
[1:55:37] already waiting in that other dimension.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; That's where we go. That is the word.
[1:55:46] Then we can look back and see what we
[1:55:49] done. We now we don't understand it. We
[1:55:52] never we have never become the word.
[1:55:57] We have never become Now we are becoming
[1:56:00] the word made flesh in bride form. The
[1:56:05] son of man being revealed in bride form.
[1:56:11] the female. Remember, Adam,
[1:56:15] Eve, the Garden of Eden,
[1:56:18] everything had to be restored. But look,
[1:56:22] when this body receives the spirit of
[1:56:24] God, the immortal life inside of you, it
[1:56:27] throws the body in subjection to God.
[1:56:30] Hallelujah. He that's born of God doth
[1:56:33] not sin. He cannot sin. The attribute
[1:56:36] that's in you can't sin. It can't
[1:56:39] disbelieve the word. That's why you got
[1:56:41] to go back to the word because you are
[1:56:43] the word.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; You receive this message. It identifies
[1:56:47] you that you are the word in your day.
[1:56:50] Amen. He that's born of God doth not
[1:56:52] commit sin. Romans 8:1 there. There is
[1:56:55] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:56:58] that are in Christ Jesus. They walk not
[1:57:01] after the flesh but after the spirit.
[1:57:03] There you are. See, that throws your
[1:57:06] body subject.
[1:57:09] And what is it? It's the earnest of the
[1:57:11] resurrection. What is the earnest of the
[1:57:13] resurrection? The Holy Ghost.
[1:57:15] Grieve not the Holy Ghost whereby you
[1:57:18] are sealed.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; Sealed, brother, sister.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; Until the day of your redemption. Amen.
[1:57:26] It's the earnest of the resurrection.
[1:57:28] This body will be raised up again
[1:57:30] because it's already started. It was
[1:57:33] once subject to sin and mire and
[1:57:35] corruption, but now it's got the
[1:57:37] earnest. Oh, glory to God. It's got the
[1:57:39] Holy Ghost. It's quickening. It's the
[1:57:42] same spirit that raised Christ from the
[1:57:44] dead that dwells in you. It's turned
[1:57:46] heavenly.
[1:57:48] Now, that's the earnest that you're
[1:57:50] going in the rapture. It's the earnest.
[1:57:54] Then, when man is born again from
[1:57:56] heaven, he becomes a spirit babe in
[1:57:59] Christ. And then when this robe of flesh
[1:58:02] is dropped, there is a natural body,
[1:58:05] theophony body, a body not made with
[1:58:07] hands, neither born of a woman that we
[1:58:10] go to. Then that body returns back and
[1:58:13] picks up the glorified body.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For what? The glorified body
[1:58:19] is a theophony body that can be
[1:58:22] expressed right here on earth for
[1:58:24] another thousand years because they
[1:58:26] shall rule and reign with him
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; in the millennium.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Praise God forever more.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; Are you ready for the next
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; stage?
[1:58:39] Are you ready for the completion
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; of the rapture?
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; I'm looking forward to a rest, saints. I
[1:58:45] don't know about you.
[1:58:48] But I'm looking forward to that three
[1:58:49] and a half year rest. And then the two
[1:58:53] witnesses come on the scene. Then Moses
[1:58:56] and Elijah go to Israel. Then the
[1:58:58] awakening of the 144,000. Then there's
[1:59:01] going to be great tribulation. Then
[1:59:03] there's going to be
[1:59:05] a thousand years of peace.
[1:59:08] Glory to God. Amen. Praise God. Are you
[1:59:11] glad that God has given us this?
[1:59:18] We should be the happiest people on
[1:59:20] earth, saints. Praise God forever more.
[1:59:24] Glory to God. Amen. Let's sing that
[1:59:25] song. If the same spirit that raised
[1:59:27] Christ from the dead dwells in you,
[1:59:30] it'll quicken you, I'll tell you. Amen.
[1:59:33] Give me a key, sister. If the same
[1:59:37] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[1:59:40] dwell in you,
[1:59:43] it dwell in you.
