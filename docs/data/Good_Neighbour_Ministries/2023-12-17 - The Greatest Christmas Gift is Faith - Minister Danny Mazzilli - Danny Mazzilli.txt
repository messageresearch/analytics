amen we're going to talk about the greatest Christmas gift and week in you know we can talk about uh all kinds of gifts this is the time of the year where everybody's that's the that's the one of the main things on people's minds these days right oh I got to get a gift for this one I got to get a gift for that one and I got to get a gift for that oh and I'm wondering what gifts I'm gonna get well praise God you know today we can talk about the greatest gift the greatest Christmas gift that anybody could ever received is the gift of faith you know faith is talked about all the time time people say oh well have faith have faith you know I've got faith well today we're going to look at it and just look at it from the scriptures and we're going to see just how powerful that word is and how it's so necessary for us to be able to recognize what God is doing in our day amen praise God before we do that let's just pray father we are so thankful this morning we're so privileged and honored Lord to be able to um stand in this wonderful place Lord where you are present you were waiting for us this morning it's not anything that we deserved Lord all we did was hearken to your word it's something that that that Lord we could not deny when it was revealed in our hearts it's caused us to keep coming back lord to that Fountain to that that that Fountain of absolute abute faith and and joy unspeakable it's full of glory Lord It's Lord we we can't describe it lord it's it's Indescribable father and Lord this morning we ask that your spirit would just come and minister to our hearts in a simple way Lord make Christmas more real to us than ever before Lord only you can do that by the opening of your word and by the Simplicity of your presence move through each Pew this morning and discern the hearts and the lives of your children Lord help us to speak your word Lord help us to receive your word lord it's it's by your spirit Lord that we can Rejoice this morning Grant it we pray

that great work and let it be this morning that we can just Rejoice around the Throne of God in Jesus Christ's name amen praise God Amen praise God so let's um let's start this morning with um with our first scripture the greatest Christmas gift this morning it's a very familiar scripture um it's a timely scripture there's so much in this scripture that we can draw from this morning but we're going to just try to focus in on the gift the great gift that God has given us amen Luke 2: 8 to 14 reads and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of of the Lord Shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people amen for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of heavenly hosts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace Good Will toward men go to the next slide we'll continue and it came to pass as the Angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepher said one to another let us now go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which which has come to pass which the Lord hath made known unto us and they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph and the Babe lying in a manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the same which was told them concerning this child and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the Shepherds but Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart and the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them praise God the Lord add His blessings to the word you may be seated my my my what a time what an hour here God was displaying his word he was bringing to pass a word that had been prophesied all through the Old Testament that the Messiah was was going to come the Messiah was going to come he would be the savior he would be the Redeemer he would be the one that would take away all the sins of the world and restore the the the the kingdom back because in in those days you know Israel was scattered they were all wondering what was going to happen they were studying the word they were believing that there was going to be a change and there were people in the land that were all under bondage the Gentiles were under bondage Rome was was controlling the people was was uh uh it was it was kind of like a day like today amen where where the people were were kind of Uncertain didn't know what was going to happen didn't know if they had a future they were under the bondage of Rome and and under the the control of of of uh of dictatorship and Herod was in power and all he cared about was that he was the king he would be the only King and yet there was a there was a message that went out that Messiah was going to come and the Messiah was coming and then the prophecy started to get closer and the prophecy became more real just like today they talk about the coming of the lord they're saying he's going to be coming he's coming he's coming but yet he had already come amen and here we are living in a day where people are still crying out and they're saying he's coming he's coming he's coming but then there's a people there's simple humble people where the where the spirit of God has come and revealed himself and made known unto them that he is here amen and that we have a wonderful message praise God go to the next slide 2 Corinthians 9:15 you know this is in the new international version and I'll read it to you from the Amplified version it's quite similar but it says thanks be to God for his Indescribable gift it's an Indescribable gift this gift that we've received you know to the the people here people today they're you know they've made Christmas all about you know a baby being born in a manger and and they're surrounding it all around a baby being born in a manger and not recognizing that that that baby had a significance to it it was God coming to Earth it was the word made flesh and in that baby was wrapped all kinds of Prophecy there was prophecy wrapped in that baby that was going to bring Salvation to all that could believe and here Paul I want you to notice here in this scripture Paul when he when he when he when he wrote this um I want you to understand that Paul was a brilliant teacher of the scriptures he was taught by gelia and here he is he's you know he's trying you know Saul of Tarsus he was well respected in his day he was a keen thinker he was he was he had a vocabulary that could that could just you know mesmerize people he was a he was a leader and a teacher of Greek he he knew the Greek understanding he knew the Greek teachings he knew that he was a dictionary he was a walking dictionary amen praise God he was a he was a capable Communicator he and and more of his writings are in the New Testament than anybody else next to Jesus Christ I believe he's probably the one of the greatest theologians and thinkers that has ever come to this planet praise God I I never cease to be amazed by by his writings you know when you read them and and and and here he's he he comes to this place you know where where he was an amazing uh Communicator an amazing writer you know um and yet he pauses to a simple four-letter word when he came to the word gift and he couldn't put a description on it all he could say say was it it's Indescribable hallelujah it's Indescribable you know and here in the new Amplified version in uh in the same verse chapter uh 9 verse1 15 of 2 Corinthians he says now thanks be to God for his gift precious Beyond telling his Indescribable inexpressible free gift glory to God Amen this is without price when God gives you faith and God gives you a revelation of his word he doesn't put any condition on it it's not something that you did to deserve it you didn't deserve this gift you didn't uh do anything you didn't go to school and become a great Theologian because there's many of great theologians that could that could be seated right here and that are preaching the word out there to hundreds and and thousands and millions of of listeners out there but yet they're preaching a word that is not revelated by the spirit of God and therefore the gift has no effect Jesus you know when when he stood there before all the Pharisees and the Sadducees he realized that they had made the word of God of none effect to the people because they had attached their own doctrines their own teachings their own interpretation I mean there's so many different interpretations on the word of God now especially when it comes to Christmas you know and and you know let's face it Saints Christmas is every day for us Christmas is not just December you know December 25th the world has commercialized it the world has has placed it into this season but really you know Christmas is all the time for for Sons and Daughters of God because Christmas is the worship of Jesus Christ and if you want to talk about the birth of Jesus it wasn't in in the winter in December it was in the spring when all the Lambs are born because he was the Lamb of God that would take away the sins of the world and he went to what when when the Angels were sent down the Angels were sent to shepherds in the field let's look at this Indescribable why is this gift too awesome for words I mean after all it's just a baby but it was Indescribable but it wasn't just an ordinary bab if it had have been an ordinary baby then fine then then you know then then you could say that you know it's just an ordinary child that's being born and to a lot of people that's what it was but to us we had a revelation and an understanding that it was more than just the child it was the word being made flesh in the day that he was coming to the Earth amen praise God and so when we look at this we look at this gift Jesus wrapped in swaddling cloth I want you to notice that you know when we read the scripture this will be a sign to you he's going to be wrapped in swaddling cloths I believe that that sign is still a sign today because when God comes he doesn't come to the Kings and all the great thinkers of the day they they're they're actually further away from this Revelation and this gift of faith than anybody else because the more you try to understand God and the more you try to scientifically uh understand the word of God and and theoretically understand the word of God the further away it takes you from God hallelujah he was wrapped in swaddling cloths in a Manger let's look at the next scripture or the the next slide it's a quote from Brother brandom listen to brother Bram he says way into the East and many hundreds of miles away from there the Magi was already on their Road they had seen his star and was coming to worship God's little gift package that he was sending to the world just a little while from then and the world was going to receive its greatest gift that it had ever received a little package wrapped up a little first little Christmas package that was ever wrapped in all the world God wrapped it up I want to break in on my thought and say this the greatest thing was ever wrapped in human flesh was wrapped in it God himself wrapped his own self in a Christmas package and sent it to the world why did they refuse it why couldn't they see it why did they turn it down why is it they didn't want it the same reason they don't want it tonight it wasn't handed to them in the custom that they were used to gifts being handed that's the reason it's rejected yet tonight is because it's not handed to the people in the custom that they have been used to receiving gifts but God wrapped his own package he's got a right to do it he the one that's giving it he has a right to wrap it in any way he wants to wrap it doesn't make any difference how he how it is he's got a right to do it because he's the one that's giving the the gift God can give Revelation and give an understanding of himself to whomever he chooses to give it to it's not something that you can can deserve that you can say I did this I did that I deserve this or I deserve that no sir it is only something that God can give because he has a purpose in giving it to you amen there's a purpose behind it so we can say that that baby was wrapped in Prophecy it was wrapped in history it was wrapped in everything that we would that that that that we would see fulfilled as as we look back on the scriptures and here we are today at 2023 and we can look back we're not looking at the baby we're not we're not talking about the baby today that was just a sign that was God humbling himself and coming to the Earth according to his word he said that he would come exactly that way he said that a virgin would conceive but yet when the Virgin conceived and she was right there in the midst of their of his own people they couldn't recognize it they didn't recognize it they didn't see the Simplicity of God's word and that's the thing that that people always tend to do they get so caught up into their own ideas their own interpretations their own ways that they should see the word of God and they'll always miss exactly what God is doing and God doesn't do it just you know uh I'm just going to fool them and I'm going to I said this and I'm going to do it this way no sir when God does something he does it exactly according to his word and and and the word will prove it a virgin shall conceive he shall be born in Bethlehem the city of David the city of God's bread everything that God did he did it exactly according to the way that he said he would do it and he always does it that that way and even here today we're going to be looking at how it is that he's doing it here today and yet people are in the midst of Christmas they're celebrating they're setting up their mangers in their homes they're putting the little baby in the manger and they're actually they're actually worshiping the little baby they're worshiping the little baby not realizing that that was only a sign that was God coming to to to Earth to to Simply uh fulfill his purpose in going to the cross that was the greatest victory that was the greatest gift that could ever come but the gift has fulfilled its purpose and today we need to recognize what the purpose of that gift was and how it affects us in our day and how salvation is being made available to a people in this hour and that it wrapped up in the prophecy of that little baby was you and your destiny was was you and and and the Rapture seeing you going to to the Cross when he went to the Cross you went to the cross with him because you were in him amen everything was wrapped into the prophecy of that child and here today we want to unravel that gift we want to see what the gift is giving us today we want to recognize what he's given us here in this day and in this hour amen praise God and so when we look at this we see that that that there's many wise but yet the Lord remember he's always own interpreter and he'll make it plain but why was it that he went to Shepherds and not to the high priests and the theologians of that day why did he bypass the rich and go to the poor you know you know Shepherds were were poor they were smelly they were always with their sheep they were there so much that they you know they hung around with their sheep so much that they smelled like their sheep it was like it was like they were uh you know the the simplest and the humblest people but yet God decides to go to Shepherds in a field to declare here the the highest God the the god of the universe comes to the lowest on Earth and and reveals and lets them know that hey um I'm here I'm here this day in the city of David a child has been born Christ the Lord he was telling them exactly and when they went there they saw exactly what God the Angels had told told them they would find amen praise God why did he bypass the smart intellectuals the learned and go to the humble and the unlearned why did he bypass them God was showing that he was the great Shepherd God was showing that that that that he could choose and and fulfill his word in a way that would baffle the the the the the high-m minded the wise and The Prudent but would would he he could reveal it to babes such as as us you wonder why did God allow me to see this revelation of himself in this day and in this hour how could I be so blessed and so you know So Unworthy but yet God chose me god listen it's not something that you did it's not be listen it's not your fault that God chose you so don't try and justify to your friends and your family when you're telling them about Jesus Christ and how he has changed your life and how he's the center of your life now that's not something you need to justify because you didn't do it it's him he chose you he's proving his own word in you it's not you got to prove something to the world or you got to justify that you know that that you serve God and that you that that that the word is a reality to you and and you know that that that the baby the revelation of the baby when you start to you know Fellowship around the word of God there's so much Revelation that just constantly pours into your heart what is it it's not something that you did it's not something that you need to justify it's because Christ decided that he was going to come to you because when he comes to any people it's because he wants to manifest his word to that generation remember that Hallelujah go to the next slide but when Jesus comes someday the great Shepherd of the sheep and you know we are sheep that's why he's the great Shepherd sheep he said my sheep hear my voice they will not follow any other voice that's why you you you can't you can't describe this this uh you know unveiling of the word and and the Revelation that's come to you it's not something you can you can uh describe to people it's it's in the Indescribable it's just something that God does and he says the great Shepherd of the sheep from Pentecost through Luther through all the ages that has accepted the light as it comes through the carriers notice what he says here not except the carriers I'll repeat that he says that has accepted the light that has come through the carriers not except the carrier except the light see went out he'll come to redeem I'm so glad I know he's coming again oh would you be numbered with his group would you be numbered there's only one way to do it not by joining a church but by being born into him and all the father has given me will come and no man can come except except my father calls him that's powerful Saints don't you see how real this is that that it's not something that you can just you know you can convince somebody into you need to you need to accept Christ you need to you you need to receive Christ we can we want people to receive Christ and our lives and our testimonies is something that we constantly are doing because we're Christians Christ is living living in and through us and what we're doing is we're looking for for all the rest of the Sons and Daughters of God to come into the body of Christ so that this can all finish up and fulfill the purpose and the plan of God but it's not something that we do it's something that he does he says all that the father hath given me will come we don't need to try and pull people into the church God is the one that opens the understanding and draws them he says the father father draws them the father pulls on them the father reveals himself to them just go back and look at your own experience how it is that you came to Christ it wasn't because somebody convinced you it's because he convinced you he revealed himself to you he made himself personal to you amen glory to God see that's all there is to it except it he's that that the only Christmas gift that I know of is the gift of God that He gave to the world his only begotten son and he's the same yesterday today and forever the word the word see believe him in this day the fullness of the Bible when those seven Mysteries back through those seven Church ages there were seven hidden mysteries now we're not going to get into all of that but you know God had a mystery right from before the foundations of the world and and that mystery is still unveiling itself and that mystery is what we're ministering on this morning that mystery of faith is what we're we're we're we're uh talking about this morning and that mystery is the body of Jesus Christ that's coming into its fullness in the day that we're living in so that we can fulfill the Rapture of the church amen praise God hallelujah glory to God so he bypassed and he looked and he saw us he saw you he saw that you would be the one that he would come to in that age and and and you accepted the light you know a lot of people they talk about oh I saw the light well what light did you see L listen do you know that there's only one light in this age right now in this time and season that we're living in the Gentiles there's a light to the Gentiles right now and do you know that that light is the message of this hour it is the message that God sent us a prophet to fulfill Malachi 4:5 it's it's the message that God sent us Revelations 10 1-7 that God sent us the seventh angel to come and to introduce the mighty Angel himself do you know that that that Revelation on the message of this hour if you miss that you're going to miss Christ in your day do you know that if they the the ones that followed John the Baptist and that heard what John the Baptist was telling the people that when he said I must decrease so that he can increase do you know that when he went off the scene and Jesus Christ started to increase that that the people there was only a handful that really recognized what was going on do do you see how important it is to recognize what it is that God is doing in our day that we're not to just get caught up into this Christmas spirit of gifts and giving and and and and uh you know that uh we got to decorate our homes with lights and you know we've got to flash this and Flash that and it it there's more to it the the true purpose of Christmas the real reason of Christmas is to recognize your day and its message there's nothing more powerful there's nothing greater there's nothing in this Christian dispensation this Gentile dispensation than to receive the message of this hour which is Christ being made flesh again in a people manifesting himself in a bride bringing a group of individuals attributes of God bringing them together to recognize that they are in the body of Christ who they really are so that they can come together Unity of unity of the faith to the body come into the fullness of Christ Hallelujah there's so so much going on saints of God but yet a lot of them are missing it go to the next slide why it had to be Shepherds help us Lord we pray give us of thy love and thy spirit and thy light we dedicate ourselves tonight to Thy word and to thy call are you dedicating yourself to this call are have you dedicated yourself to receive this message and and make this message your absolute because it is Christ people say oh I've accepted Jesus Christ well we'll see we're going to go a little deeper here to see you know uh if you've really accepted Christ because Christ is the word he'll never change and he says in Jesus Christ's name we receive your Christmas gift the word of God made flesh in us it's Christ in you your hope of glory go to the next slide Galatians 4:19 says my little children of whom I travail in birth again until what Christ be formed in you you mean Christ is actually going to possess my life possess my mind possess my spirit The Same Spirit that raised Christ from the dead is going to dwell in me you mean that's really what's happening you mean that's what's that that's what's really going on it's not just about being a church member I've been going to church my parents I go to my parents' church I've been you know I follow exactly what they've always told me never mind following anybody you need to come to Christ you need to come to your own personal revelation of the word of God Christ in you made flesh amen listen I want to read here go to the next slide in Luke 24: 36-42 I want you to just picture this scene here now remember Christ was on the earth Christ was making himself known he was preaching he he he did he did The Sermon on the Mount he was Healing The Sick there was there was thousands of of people hundreds thousands of people that were being healed and raised even raised from the dead there was Miracle upon Miracle he was preaching his word but yet when it all came right down to it they took him to the cross they rejected him they they they chose Barnabas over Jesus Christ the word amen that's how that's how far from God the people were and they didn't realize it they were in a a reprobate condition they thought they were worshipping the Messiah they thought they were waiting on the Messiah and that he was going to come but yet he was right there in plain made flesh dwelt among them doing the sign he says if you don't believe me believe the signs but yet even even the signs they couldn't recognize they couldn't believe that it was actually him we've had so many signs in our day praise God and listen to Jesus he says and as they thus spake now here now Jesus raised from the dead Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and said unto them peace be unto you but they were terrified they were frightened imagine they would they were walking with Christ they heard him speak to him they listened to all the sermons but yet when he appeared to them in the day that he was revealing himself as the Risen Christ they were petrified they were afraid they didn't know what was going on and and and look and and suppose that they had seen a spirit and he said unto them why are you troubled why are you so troubled and why do do thoughts arise in your hearts behold my hands and my feet that it is I myself handle me and see for a spirit hath no Flesh and Bones as ye as ye see as ye see me have and when he had thus spoken he showed them his hands and his feet and while they yet believed not they were still disbelieving I'm just reading you the scriptures you could see all kinds of things you know you could witness Miracles all the the the the the miracle of the Virgin Mary in Portugal the miracle of Saint so and so over here the miracle of this and the Miracle of that but yet when Christ comes and really comes it's it's a shock to the people they still can't recognize and when he had spoken thus he showed them his hands and feet while they were yet they believed not for joy and wondered he said unto them have ye here any meat he was now he was getting carnal now he was coming right down to where they were he wanted to show them listen come on it's me I'm here you got some meat you got some fish you got something you know so that we can eat and they gave him a piece of broiled fish and what and honeycomb next slide and he took it and he did eat before them so if you're wondering on an offside shoot here now if you're wondering if we're going to have a big wedding supper in that three and a half years uh of of honeymoon when we go into the Rapture we're going to be enjoying some food you'll be able to eat and enjoy food again because you're wondering well man you know I'm going to have a supernatural body am I going to still be able to enjoy because everybody that's one thing around Christmas everybody enjoys food a little too much but these are the words which I spake unto you he was reminding them of the things that he had said while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me me then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures and this is something that that only God can do that only only only God can give you the door opening experience to where when you read the word you can understand the word how many remembers you know before the Lord gave you his his Spirit you know you'd look at the Bible and you'd start in Genesis and by the time you got through a couple of chapters you just you didn't know where you were and this you know this you know an it was all the ancest you know you're wondering what is this all about why do I need to know all of this but God was showing in there that you are part of that that ancestry that you are part of that inheritance that you are in that lineage that you have been in the mind of God from before the foundations of the world and he's got a great great plan for your life amen glory to God so he opened it up and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behooves Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem and ye are witnesses of these things and behold I send the promise of my father upon you now here's the gift here's now where he's he's giving the gift glory to God he says but T ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high so there is a stage in your ministry in your Christian walk where you need to be endued with power from on high you could have heard the prophet's messages you could have gone to Jeffersonville you could have read every one of those tracks you could have listen listen to every one of those tapes you could be in church every Sunday you could be you you could you could be in your prayer closet every single day but until the spirit of the Living God endues you with power to live this word until the spirit of God comes in you and reveals unto you who you are and your part in the word of God you're just another church pew member you're just another member of a church you're just another traditional Church goer that just believes that Christmas is a time to give gifts a time to just you know to to to be nice to one another a time to just give to the poor yes this is a time to do all of those things but it's so much greater than that when you personally come into that Revelation that God has given you the greatest gift amen God has given you the overcoming power God has given you the ability to overcome this age and all the Temptations of this age God is giving you a future to know that you shall be changed in this Mortal body that breaks down on a regular basis that you feel the aches and the pains from that God God's going to deliver you from that God's going to give you a brand new body God's given you gift Beyond human comprehension glory to God Amen thank you Jesus now let's go to next slide now this is just simple I told you I don't got anything I haven't got like a real deep message for you today I got a Christmas message I got something that I believe is the greatest gift the greatest Christmas gift that anybody could ever receive and if you don't go back to your ABCs and you don't recognize and those that are out there online that are listening in there's a way to get the greatest gift that you will ever receive and I promise you your life will change from today if you can receive this gift Hallelujah acts 2:30 7 to 239 he says now when they heard this now remember the the the the the 120 Jesus said now you go into Jerusalem and you wait now they were all together they were all in the upper room they were all waiting because they knew something was going to come to them that was going to take them to the next stage of not just being a a somebody that saw and somebody that can just give some testimonies of what they saw but now they would be ued with power so that when their life was endued with that power and you start to testify to your brothers you try you start to testify to your family you tell your friends your testimony there will be an anointing behind it that will draw you into the body of Christ that will draw them into the body of Christ listen it wasn't brother Gabriel that convinced me when I went to go buy furniture 30 years ago in his little shop there and he handed me a tape it wasn't brother Gabriel himself but in brother Gabriel there was a seed there was a there was an anointing there was an election there was something there that would be released and when you as a son or daughter of God is because you've been endued with the power of the holy spirit in this hour and you testify and you share about what God is doing in your day and and what he's done for you and what he's what he's doing in our church and in our ministry and how he's Healing The Sick and all we we all hear those things but when you speak it indued with the power of the Holy Ghost it's different people will know it's different they will either accept it or they will get afraid and they'll run from it because it'll it'll it'll try to pull them into a relationship with God where now they're going to be exposed I've had a lot of people tell me oh Danny you know you know man are you a preacher you know because you know they they they go like but Danny I need to to clean up my life I I I can't come to your church I need to clean up no I said no you got it all wrong that's not the way it works I was worse than you I needed him to do the work because I couldn't do the work and until I experienced that he could do that work I didn't know what I was really coming into so so when you testify and the power of God comes off of your testimony people's lives can be changed and transformed Hallelujah so here now they had received the power from on high the promise that Jesus gave them he says I'm going to Endo you with power I'm going to give you a gift that's going to change all of mankind going forward you are going to be my testimony into the End of the Age until we come together again and break bread and drink wine oh saints of God what a time and here now now these were the now picture this scene when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and they said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do in other words we can see that you're full of the Holy Ghost we can see that there's something on you we can understand in our own language and yet you're speaking and everybody's understanding in their own language how is that possible there was a supernatural element around their testimony and there was will be one around your life around your testimony when you receive this gift amen and he says men and Brethren what shall we do and then Peter now remember Peter was present when Jesus came down and gave the Great Commission to go ye into all the world and preach this gospel tell them about this gospel and and he and Peter was right there when Jesus said go ye preach this gospel in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost Peter knew very well exactly who was standing before him because Jesus one time asked him who do the people say that I am and he told him exactly who he was he was God Almighty made flesh amen that's what he told them Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God you are the word made flesh in this hour I recognize you and so when when Jesus said in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit Peter knew exactly what he was saying he knew exactly that everything that he would do from that point on would all be in the name of Jesus Christ and that's why when he when he said to them then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized right there there's the tank you know you know but I was baptized as a baby not valid not valid you cannot repent as a baby you cannot possibly uh know what you're doing as a baby somebody's just pouring water onto you or dunking you under the water without any Revelation without any faith of what it is that's taking place in your life Jesus said he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved so here he says repent be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ he didn't say in the name of the father and of the son because Peter knew very clearly that Jesus Christ was the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost it's just like when when when when Jesus was on the earth and Phil came to him and says Lord show us the father he says if you've seen me you've seen the father you're looking at him have I been so long with you you see and that's the greatest that's one of the greatest Revelations that you can have and that's one Revelation that 95% of the church world out there is missing can you believe that as simple and here it is right there simple right in the scripture you know be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and sin is unbelief and you shall receive the gift what gift the gift of the Holy Ghost that's the that's the the the the the I will Endo you with power I will give you something that will override every thing in your life when that comes into your life that song that we sang Justified never done it in the first place that power comes in and it takes away every sin it remits sin it removes Sin from your life it takes it completely out of your entire history Hallelujah sure the devil's going to play with your mind and remind you of the things that you did and even the things that you're doing but the power of the blood Jesus is not an Indian giver he's not going to give you something that's only going to be partly good and and it's got a time sensitive thing on it no there's no time sensitive because God is not dealing with time he's dealing with eternity he's not dealing with your time body he's dealing with your attribute that's in you he's calling it to its position Hallelujah glory to God but this thing gets in the way this thing wants to figure things out this thing wants to know that it needs to do something that that you know that it's missing out on something maybe missing that it needs to no there's nothing you need to do he said repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the mission of your you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for This Promise is unto you to your children and to all that are a far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call hallelujah praise God forever more so there's step one in getting to that place where you can I remember I remember my my experience and and I believe that every son and daughter of God will will have that same experience that when they come into that understanding and that revelation of God's word they'll want to get to the water they're going to want to get to the water when Philip was telling the unic all about it and tell them about Jesus and the baptism and all those things they he he says where's where's there a pool of water I got to get to the water because I want I want the word to be fulfilled filled in my life I want to do it according to God's word because God will only honor his word amen praise God let's let's go to the next slide St John chapter 14 I want you to you know this these are things that we've read things that we've talked about but I want to remind you this morning I want to remind you of of this this incredible gift this Indescribable gift that God has given us it brings us into a relationship with him and he says and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter he's talking about the Holy Ghost here that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive you know how many times I've you know you testify and you know you want to you know share it with the people and you know step one is that they need to know that God has a provided way God God unveils his word and and and you know that if somebody is an act attribute of God you don't have to worry God will awaken that attribute it's God that calls the attribute but it's the scripture you know Faith cometh by hearing do you know that you cannot communicate with God through your five senses I don't care how much you try to communicate with God through your five senses you're not g to but he communicates to you through the five senses how by faith by hearing the word that's why we we we feed on the word of God and God's spirit rides the word it comes into you the Revelation awakens in you and now you please God now you're communicating to God by Revelation you can only communicate with God by faith not with this because there's a lot of people that can speak and pray longer than you and more eloquent than you but if if if there isn't Faith behind that word God doesn't hear it he says without faith it's impossible to please me amen so he says here even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live he shall live also at that day which day what day he's talking about that day he's talking about that day in your life in your walk when you come into that into that personal understanding of Christ where you come into that relationship with him on that day ye shall know that I am in the father ye in me and I in you hallelujah praise God bless the name of the Lord that's the only way that we can that we can come to Christ and know that we've come know that we've that that that we're doing what what is essential you know uh people just go to church and they don't have that that that process and that Avenue given to them and shown to them but that's why we're here that's why we're here we're here to testify of how God lit our light how he he lit our candle how he brought us into our relationship with him glory to God next slide Colossians 1:25 to 27 he says whereof I now Paul speaking here to the Colossians he says whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God we need to see here clearly that God has dispensations God has timing God has a time for each and every son and daughter of God to be called and placed into the word of God Amen which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery listen there's a mystery here that's being unveiled amen which hath been hid from ages and from Generations but now Paul understood that now was the time now was the body of Christ coming together because Christ had given up the ghost the spirit now was being made available to the people God was building the body of Christ God was going to build a gentile Church church God was going to put together the bride of Christ so that all could be restored listen to him he says but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man and perfect in Christ imagine how can you possibly be perfect I know for a fact there's a lot of imperfections in my life there's absolutely no way that anybody in this church this morning could say I'm perfect but Christ wants you to know that the part of you that is him the part of you that is him is perfect and that you have come into the mystical body of Jesus Christ by a divine revelation and there's no other way that you're going to come and that is the gift the gift of faith it's it's Revelation Saints it's the only thing that brings us into go to the next slide for by grace are you saved through I want to uh go to the next Slide by by grace are ye saved through faith I want you to replace that word and say Revelation it's Revelation that's what has given you the relationship with Christ that's what's brought you into that personal and that not of yourselves but what is it it's the greatest gift that God could ever give you it's the greatest Christmas gift that he could ever give you as a Son of God next slide brother bradam says here in the anointed times he says what is Faith he he says faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be it's something that's revealed to you the Rapture is a revelation that God has revealed to you it's not yet but it's going to happen and you know it's going to happen because you're already being changed you're already being being uh uh transformed your life is getting better and better in Christ Hallelujah faith is a revelation of the will of God so by Revelation amen praise God the next slide as we wind it down now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made made of things which do appear hallelujah praise God forever more listen to brother brandom here in works is Faith expressed now Faith is a revelation from God now Faith is a revelation there's where I want to stay there just a moment it's a revelation he has revealed it to you by his grace it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into Faith you you you ever have faith it's given you by the grace of God it's something that God freely gives but it's the one that he's the one that decides to give it he's the one that opens and no man can shut he's the one that shuts and no man can open you don't have to try and and force anybody to receive it he says and God reveals it to you therefore by therefore faith is a revelation and look what he says and the whole church the whole Church of God is built upon Revelation this ministry is built upon Revelation this is not just an ordinary Ministry Good Neighbor Ministries is not just another Christian Church in Burlington Ontario I want to make that clear this church is built upon Divine spiritual Revelation where God personally speaks to each and every individual when we come under this this uh this order of service and the minister stands before us here and ministers the word of God we are under expectation like the children of Israel that when Moses spoke Moses was speaking the mind of God speaking the word of God giving the children what they had need of God was supernaturally dropping Mana from Heaven well that was all a type God is doing that right now right here whenever we gather together it's because we come under a supernatural leadership of the spirit of God and that God speaks to us Us lip to ear God knows what we did last week God knows what we have in mind of doing this week God is aware of your sickness God is aware of your relationship problems God knows everything that you have need of but there's only one way that you're going to receive that Deliverance it's going to come by the preaching of the word because Faith cometh by hearing and by hearing of God's word hallelujah praise God listen and the Revelation is the only thing revelation of the word what is what is a revelation Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll build my church when he was talking to Peter and Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God Jesus looked to him and he said Flesh and Blood didn't teach this to you Peter this is not something that you got by going to theology school or something that you got by going to Sunday school or by being a part of your parents' church or by being a part of your aunt's church or your uncle's church this is something that God himself comes to you as an individual and he says I'm going to build my church this way I'm going to call every son and daughter of God that way and when they come together they shall know their God and they shall do great exploits because they have come into the supernatural anointed Ministry in the body of Jesus Christ amen he says here he says I'll build my church in the Gates of Hell listen I don't care if you're a son or a daughter of God and you've got Revelation you know where you stand this morning you know exactly where you're standing you know exactly where you are you know that the devil he's going to hit you left right and center but why do you keep coming back what keeps you getting up after you get beat down what do you think that is that's what God placed in you that's what God awakened in you that you're an attribute of God and that there's no way that the devil can deceive you somebody come along and say hey come to my church we got better programs we got better this we got we got a lot more people than you like people had to do with it I remember there was only a dozen according to the word of God that followed Jesus in his day and if there was only a dozen back then can you imagine today when here we've got we've got thousands of different denominations we've got all kinds of different teachings it's going to take a supernatural experience you're not going to find Salvation in joining a church or being a member your only salvation is in the body of Jesus Christ and there's only one way that you can get into that body you got to be born again by the spirit of God your old life has to die completely and you've got to enter into the newness of Christ amen hallelujah he says the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it faith is a revelation because faith has been revealed to you able by faith offered by Revelation Faith he keeps repeating here offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain Cain came with with fruits Cain he didn't have a revelation that it was by the blood you know a lot of people don't know that what is it that Cain did that was different he offered unto God he made a sacrifice unto God he brought the best fruits the best flowers the best of everything that he grew probably his best tomatoes and potatoes and everything else but Abel was given a revelation of the blood that it would need that that it would need a sacrifice that something would have to die that would that would have to replace that would have to stand in his his place he knew that it would have to be blood and he knew that Jesus Christ his father had revealed it to him because by faith Abel made an acceptable sacrifice what was it God went to him and says the Lamb of God is going to be coming 4,000 years down the road you're going to make this sacrifice unto me and I'm going to accept it you see it was revealed to him what he should do and then he lived it he manifested it and it pleased God Amen no other way praise God let the musicians come listen to Listen to uh the anointed ones in the in the end time brother BR says and the only way that one that that was received could have done anything different from his brother it was revealed to him he's talking about Cain and Abel for the Bible said by faith Hebrews 11 by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than of Cain which God testified he was righteous God was showing Jesus said the spiritual revelation of who he was who does man say I the son of man am he said Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God blessed art thou Simon Hallelujah he says Upon This Rock I'll build my Church the true revelation of the word this is the true vine again Hallelujah this is the true vine now ye are the branches I'm the vine you are the branches God is is is coming into a church once again to unleash his faith into a body re revealing himself making himself known giving you instruction and positioning within the word of God and the body of Christ to know who you are and your part in the word listen here in the Rapture he says but to the church the bride the Rapture is a revelation if you're in the body of Christ there's a Rapture Revelation that you are now feasting on and everything that we preach everything that you read everything that you feed on is giving you faith for the Rapture it's giving you rapturing faith it's giving you a supernatural understanding on the word of God that goes beyond your own thoughts your own ideas he says it's revealed to her that the Revelation the true bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the Rapture now it is a revelation for the Revelation is Faith glory to God you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation I know I'm driving this home but I want everybody to know about this great gift that God has given us I believe it's the greatest Christmas gift that we could have ever possibly received of God hallelujah glory to God let's read our last slide as we close it says here in 1 John 5:4 he says for for whosoever is born of God overcometh the world that's what we were talking about here all morning about the New Birth about the revelation of who you are about the faith that you need to take the Rapture about a supernatural church that is now coming together a mystical body a supernatural body the literal body of Jesus Christ you know that you are the literal body of Jesus Christ you say no it's just the attribute no in that body that you live in that you are walking in that you are talking through that you are living through that is now God's possession you are the body of Christ when you assemble yourselves you think you know oh I don't need to go to church yeah you need to go to church the body of Believers needs to come together needs to come into the unity of the faith needs to recognize and and and and overcome each other's faults and and each other's weaknesses and each other's strengths all those things because it's all part of you being perfected for the for the Rapture you being perfected into the body of Jesus Christ remember this body that you're in right now though it is not going to inherit the kingdom of God God said he's going to change it he's going to change it in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and God overcometh the world for whosoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our gift of faith and Revelation may God bless you this Christmas to go and be a testimony of Faith to be able to stand on that word regardless of what is being taught out there all the commercial enjoy the gifts enjoy the family enjoy the fellowship love your family show them
