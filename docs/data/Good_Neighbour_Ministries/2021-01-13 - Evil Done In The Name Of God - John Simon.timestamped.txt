[0:14] praise the lord it's good to be here
[0:17] another
[0:17] wednesday to give glory and honor to his
[0:21] mighty name
[0:23] my friends these
[0:26] online broadcasts are
[0:29] plain and simple no
[0:32] beauty to behold in them
[0:35] except for the word of god
[0:38] may the great holy spirit help you to
[0:42] get past style
[0:46] beauty symmetry system
[0:50] and that type of thing and see
[0:54] right into the fullness of god's
[0:58] great and precious word now
[1:01] in the book of revelation chapter 2
[1:05] reading verse 10 fear
[1:09] none of these things which thou shalt
[1:11] suffer
[1:13] behold the devil shall cast
[1:16] some of you into prison
[1:20] that you may be tried
[1:23] and ye shall have tribulation
[1:26] ten days be thou faithful
[1:30] unto death and i will give you
[1:34] a crown of life o blessed be the name of
[1:38] the lord
[1:40] amen a gracious heavenly father
[1:44] we have read thy word
[1:48] now maybe may the holy spirit break the
[1:51] bread of life
[1:53] and give us lord jesus
[1:56] bread that we may eat and live forever
[2:01] we ask this in jesus name
[2:06] amen praise god
[2:09] hallelujah
[2:12] amen this wonderful verse begins
[2:17] fear not my friends
[2:20] i tell you there
[2:24] is always a
[2:27] battle an engagement
[2:30] some spit form of spiritual warfare
[2:33] ahead
[2:35] that causes god to forewarn his people
[2:41] by telling them not to fear
[2:44] don't fear don't going to panic
[2:48] when you see these things around you
[2:52] perilous times chaos trial
[2:55] tribulation don't get into a panic
[3:00] don't you fear don't you worry
[3:03] but rest in his unchanging
[3:06] love and grace for god
[3:10] will take care of you till to the end
[3:13] oh what a savior redeemer and friend
[3:18] place your faith in him for he
[3:21] cares for you and he will see you
[3:24] through
[3:25] i would like to show to you today
[3:29] how satan by his evil
[3:32] actions through his people
[3:37] justifies those actions
[3:41] by using the defense
[3:44] of religion as its justification
[3:50] for its venomous and insidious
[3:54] actions all done
[3:57] in the name of god and that is what i
[4:00] would like to entitle this
[4:04] evil acts done in the name
[4:08] of god my friends
[4:13] god says fear not no matter if you're in
[4:17] the midst of deprivation
[4:19] lack need trouble trial or tribulation
[4:24] fear not now he doesn't
[4:28] god doesn't come out and just say
[4:31] tribulation is coming
[4:33] he's not blunt about it
[4:37] but he tempers it in the way
[4:40] that he expresses it
[4:44] because had he said it that way
[4:47] it would frighten us
[4:51] but he a great god like a mother
[4:56] time for her children to go
[5:00] to rest from their daily
[5:03] troubles trials
[5:07] to go to sleep and have a time
[5:11] of recuperation
[5:15] and she gently assures them
[5:20] by telling them well children fear not
[5:23] don't fear
[5:24] because i'm going to turn off the lights
[5:29] and when i turn off the lights it's
[5:32] going to get
[5:32] dark but at the same time
[5:36] you should disclose your eyes and
[5:40] go to sleep don't be afraid
[5:44] the lights are going out and it will be
[5:47] dark but one thing fear not
[5:50] do what your fear because you ought to
[5:53] remember
[5:55] i will be here oh
[5:58] thank god for his promise that no matter
[6:02] what happens
[6:04] he promised i will never leave you
[6:07] nor forsake you but i'll be
[6:10] with you to the end he will be with us
[6:14] all the way as uh dr
[6:17] pentecost has said god in the shadows
[6:22] always watches over his own
[6:25] my dear friends no matter what you or
[6:28] i may be going through god is
[6:32] somewhere in the background
[6:35] he is standing like the angel of
[6:38] god by the drapes in the room
[6:42] and casting his eyes upon you
[6:45] never to leave you never to forsake you
[6:48] but to watch over you with an endearing
[6:53] love oh the love of god
[6:56] this wonderful love that he has given to
[6:59] his children
[7:01] he's trying to tell us i'm here
[7:04] i'm with you god you fear what
[7:08] man can do unto you amen
[7:12] i'm with you and as paul said
[7:15] my grace is sufficient for you
[7:20] o glory to his marvelous
[7:23] name when you pass through the waters
[7:27] they will not overflow you your troubles
[7:31] will not be able to drowned you
[7:34] you will not be covered up you will not
[7:36] be carried away
[7:38] but you will be kept by the power of
[7:41] god through faith not even in
[7:44] death are you defeated because we are
[7:48] more than conquerors through him
[7:52] that loved us aren't you happy today
[7:54] that no matter what comes your way
[7:57] listen we are more than conquerors
[8:00] now i'm here i'm saying these things
[8:05] and it may sound easy to you
[8:08] for someone to say we are more than
[8:12] conquerors
[8:13] because i am not in your situation
[8:18] i am not in your trial i am not in your
[8:22] trouble i have mine
[8:25] and in that i know i am more than
[8:28] a conqueror what i am doing
[8:32] is calling upon you to bring up
[8:35] that kind of confidence and faith and
[8:39] trust shine light trust in god
[8:42] to remember i am with you
[8:46] i will never leave you nor forsake you
[8:49] but i'll be with you and through it all
[8:54] trust in jesus through it all trust in
[8:57] him
[8:58] and let him lead you by the hand
[9:01] all the way and he will safely carry
[9:05] you through oh glory to god even the
[9:08] great apostles
[9:09] says it clearly friends
[9:13] troubles will never triumph over the
[9:16] children of god
[9:18] death will not defeat the children of
[9:21] god
[9:21] for there is a resurrection and a
[9:24] rapture
[9:25] that awaits those that believe him
[9:28] trust in him and hold to his unchanging
[9:32] hand
[9:33] paul speaking from experience and from
[9:36] the unfailing realities
[9:38] of the living god wrote these words in
[9:41] romans chapter
[9:43] 8 verses 35 to 59
[9:47] who shall separate us from the love of
[9:50] christ
[9:52] shall tribulation or distress
[9:57] or persecution or famine
[10:01] or nakedness or peril
[10:05] or sword as it is written
[10:08] for thy saint we are killed all the day
[10:12] long
[10:13] we are accounted as sheep for the
[10:16] slaughter
[10:18] nay in all these things we are
[10:21] more than conquerors through him
[10:25] that loved us for i am persuaded
[10:29] that neither death nor life
[10:33] nor angels nor principalities
[10:37] nor powers nor things present nor
[10:41] things to come nor height nor
[10:44] deaths nor any other creature
[10:48] shall be able to separate us
[10:51] from the love of god which is in christ
[10:54] jesus
[10:55] our lord so do not fear
[10:59] do not panic do not get into a frenzy
[11:03] oh brother sister god's
[11:06] love casts out all your fear right
[11:10] now in the name of jesus christ
[11:14] may the spirit of fear leave the
[11:17] children of god that can believe his
[11:19] promise
[11:19] in this moment while i'm speaking and
[11:22] ever
[11:23] after fear not for i am with you
[11:27] i'll be with you right through to
[11:30] the end of the age until you rapture out
[11:34] of here
[11:34] until you enter the august splendor of
[11:38] his divine
[11:39] presence he promised that he will
[11:42] be with us every step
[11:45] along this way now notice what he says
[11:49] here in the word
[11:51] the devil will cast some
[11:54] of you in the prison
[11:58] that you may be tried
[12:02] at that time the jews were doing it
[12:05] the pagan priests were doing it
[12:09] the political powers of the day the
[12:12] governors
[12:13] were trying to carry favor with the
[12:16] public
[12:18] because the people love the arena
[12:22] they love the colosseum
[12:25] and they hurled christians
[12:28] by the thousands to their deaths
[12:32] destroying them by lions
[12:35] and gladiators and every other means
[12:40] but what has the devil to do with this
[12:43] it was
[12:43] lions killing them it was gladiators
[12:46] killing them
[12:48] it was governors persecuting them
[12:51] but remember behind all of this
[12:55] is was this satanic sinister
[12:59] evil person this spirit
[13:03] being unseen to human eyes
[13:07] that we as genuine christians
[13:12] recognize and use the
[13:16] biblical term satan for he is the one
[13:21] as our god being a spirit being
[13:25] is behind the scenes and
[13:28] making himself manifest through his
[13:30] children
[13:32] so is satan
[13:36] this evil wicked
[13:39] ancient spirit working
[13:43] through those that will yield themselves
[13:46] to him
[13:48] and he will perpetrate
[13:52] crimes beyond belief
[13:55] and killing thousands using
[13:59] as his instruments as he did in the
[14:01] garden using the serpent
[14:02] now he uses lions he uses gladiators
[14:06] and any other means of torture
[14:09] destruction
[14:11] that he might wipe out every every
[14:14] evidence of the manifested presence of
[14:18] god in his children
[14:21] my friends he is behind it all
[14:25] and the reason is because he hates god
[14:29] he hates the children of god and
[14:32] anything that god loves or he sets
[14:36] his heart upon satan hates it remember
[14:39] this
[14:40] anything or anyone god loves satan
[14:44] hates and because he hates whatever god
[14:47] loves he comes against it with his trial
[14:51] and tribulation that is why one of the
[14:54] apostles peter belief said
[14:56] counted all joy when
[15:00] when you you brought into trial and
[15:02] tribulations for the trial of your
[15:05] faith work and patience it causes you to
[15:09] know
[15:09] that god loves you god cares about you
[15:14] well you say well if he cares why does
[15:16] he allow this
[15:17] because he has them all to shape you
[15:20] just you try you
[15:22] break you and make you and maul you
[15:24] again as the potter with the clay
[15:27] and this is a painful process we may not
[15:30] and we do not have to understand
[15:34] what god is doing except to rest
[15:37] ourselves in his unchanging and endless
[15:41] grace
[15:42] that he might make us into vessels
[15:46] that he wants us to be we are here to
[15:48] fulfill
[15:49] his divine purposes let him do with
[15:53] us as he wills amen amen
[15:56] so let it be glory to god amen so
[16:00] satan is bound to destroy
[16:04] when you try to live for god
[16:08] thank god he was behind
[16:12] all the groups trying to destroy
[16:14] christians
[16:16] behind the romans
[16:19] who tried to destroy christians
[16:24] he was behind that
[16:27] mother church with inquisition
[16:31] that tried to kill millions thousands
[16:35] during the times of the dark ages
[16:40] and in all ages it's the same
[16:43] spirit of satan whether it be
[16:46] uh pharaoh or nebuchadnezzar
[16:50] or whether it be uh hitler
[16:54] or whether it be stalin doesn't matter
[16:58] it's the same spirit of satan
[17:01] trying to carry out this activity
[17:05] of destroying the body in which god
[17:09] lives the temple in which
[17:12] god dwells to tear it down and to
[17:15] destroy it
[17:16] oh my oh brother sister can't you see it
[17:20] this is what he did tore down the
[17:23] temples of god
[17:25] tears up the people of god which is the
[17:27] physical temple of god
[17:29] and he is still doing it in this hour
[17:32] as long as he can find vessels to carry
[17:36] out
[17:36] his evil ex now
[17:39] this study today
[17:43] is done and i'm doing it on this the
[17:47] 13th of january
[17:52] 2021
[17:55] now notice in revelation 13.
[18:00] revelation 13 for this number
[18:03] 13 has great significance
[18:06] 30th of january 13th uh chapter
[18:10] of revelation and this 13th of chapter
[18:13] of revelation
[18:15] we find prophecy concerning
[18:18] the united states of america
[18:22] for 13 is the number of a woman
[18:27] 13 is also the number of the united
[18:30] states of america
[18:33] strikingly true because that number also
[18:37] symbolizes
[18:38] the woman statue of liberty
[18:42] which represents the united states of
[18:45] america
[18:46] and this very number the symbol
[18:49] of that great nation which started
[18:54] with 13 colonies
[18:57] and the flag had 13 stars
[19:01] and 13 stripes
[19:04] and there we find as we read in the
[19:07] bible
[19:08] her destiny is in the word of god
[19:12] and where does god place it chapter
[19:15] 13 of the book of revelation
[19:20] we find this image mentioned
[19:24] within this chapter this image
[19:28] of the beast that was before
[19:31] the same beast that was in the garden
[19:35] of eden that wild
[19:38] hybrid beast and now
[19:42] we see in a spiritual
[19:45] form him raising his head
[19:49] and coming during the
[19:52] nicer council and we
[19:56] see in the future the same
[19:59] antichrist spirit of the beast
[20:04] this destructive ferocious evil spirit
[20:09] will be out and is outraging
[20:13] amen raging like a lion
[20:17] to to destroy the people of god
[20:21] and so he will the image being
[20:24] formed denominations formed
[20:28] like blocks of a building and after a
[20:31] while you'll take
[20:32] all the bricks or blocks and fit them
[20:35] together
[20:36] and make a shape a house an image
[20:40] to which he can use my friends
[20:44] do you see what i'm talking about that
[20:47] same being as behind
[20:51] the world council of churches
[20:55] and it will emerge and when it does
[20:58] emerge
[20:59] and we understand people begin to
[21:01] understand with their head
[21:03] it will be too late then recognize it
[21:06] now
[21:07] and may the holy spirit of the living
[21:10] god
[21:10] take the word of god and reveal it to
[21:13] you
[21:14] while there is yet time take your time
[21:18] to look into his word and to come
[21:20] against this ungodly
[21:22] satanic power against a
[21:25] a world council of churches anointed
[21:29] with this
[21:30] kind of evil power upon it
[21:33] which is not yet maybe showing its claws
[21:37] like a cat can be stroked while
[21:40] everything is fine
[21:41] but you go the opposite way and get the
[21:44] cat
[21:44] angry and out comes these claws that
[21:47] will rake and
[21:48] scrape and cut and tear because of the
[21:52] evil anger
[21:54] that will flow from them it's nothing
[21:57] but the
[21:58] two vines the evil vine coming against
[22:02] the true
[22:02] vine of god and a repeat performance
[22:06] is taking place and is about to take
[22:09] place
[22:10] with diabolical cunning and with
[22:13] cruel evil satanic ferocity
[22:18] those who fight the humble
[22:21] the simple people of god
[22:25] and scoff and try to destroy them
[22:30] and they try to do it in the name of
[22:34] religion
[22:36] they try to mask it in the way as if
[22:40] they're doing it
[22:41] for righteousness sake
[22:44] we're cleansing the church for god's
[22:47] sake
[22:48] we're doing it for jesus sake
[22:52] all done in the name of god
[22:55] all done in the name of religion
[22:59] wars
[23:03] torture inquisitions evil
[23:10] forcing people into
[23:13] systems and after a while that will take
[23:16] place
[23:18] they will form this image that will form
[23:20] the system
[23:22] and you if you refuse to be a part of
[23:25] that system
[23:27] you will not be able to buy nor
[23:30] sell or have a normal human
[23:34] life you will not be free they claim
[23:37] you'll be free
[23:38] but you won't be free because they'll
[23:40] force you
[23:41] into making a choice they will inject
[23:45] you whether you
[23:46] like it or not if you don't accept the
[23:49] evil injection of sin
[23:51] then you will not be able to eat
[23:54] buy sell fly conduct businesses
[23:58] all in the cunning-ness of satan
[24:02] it's for your good it's for the good of
[24:05] the
[24:05] house of god the people of god and the
[24:08] children of god
[24:10] and you are in the minority anyway and
[24:13] we have to take care
[24:14] of the majority so friends it's right
[24:17] upon
[24:18] you and you must take note of what satan
[24:22] is doing
[24:23] because he is preparing for his great
[24:26] big push that will accomplish his divine
[24:30] aims
[24:32] as i said they'll do it all in the name
[24:35] of god
[24:36] and in the guise and name of religion
[24:40] claiming that they're doing it for
[24:43] purity
[24:43] sake and righteousness sick
[24:47] organizing repudiating
[24:51] the little flock
[24:54] they expose themselves when they do that
[24:58] and therefore reveal that they
[25:01] are of their father the devil and that
[25:04] they are of the false vine
[25:08] the same false vine
[25:11] murderous spirit that was in cain
[25:15] that same false vine
[25:18] characteristics will be made
[25:21] and is being made manifest through
[25:25] them in this day and this hour either by
[25:28] the destruction
[25:29] of character destruction of the very
[25:33] physical person destruction
[25:36] of in every possible way and every
[25:39] dimension and
[25:41] that they can do it they will destroy
[25:45] you
[25:45] as much as they can oh my
[25:49] yes brother sister and their hatred
[25:52] proves
[25:53] that they are of that nickelodeon
[25:56] antichrist church and they are of that
[25:59] type
[26:00] of a canaan canis spirit
[26:03] that is upon them
[26:08] they shall cast you into prison says the
[26:10] word of god
[26:12] yes they'll drag you into courts
[26:16] they'll false you accuse you they'll
[26:20] sue you they'll try you they'll imprison
[26:22] you and of course
[26:25] they'll do it all in the name of the
[26:27] holy church
[26:29] they'll do it all in the name of
[26:31] religion
[26:32] they'll do it all in the name of jesus
[26:35] they'll do it all in the name of their
[26:38] defending
[26:39] righteousness they'll do it all
[26:42] in the name of decency because of what
[26:46] you
[26:46] may be preaching they'll do it all in
[26:49] the name of
[26:50] their outraged innocence
[26:54] they'll do it that way all done for a
[26:57] good cause
[26:59] this is the guys this is the
[27:02] evil mask that satan will
[27:05] use my friends to be able to commit
[27:08] his ferocious evil acts
[27:11] this is the same spirit creeping in
[27:14] taking prayer out of the schools
[27:16] taking my friends bible reading out of
[27:19] the schools
[27:21] taking out all those things out of our
[27:23] laws
[27:24] out of our uh our churches taking the
[27:27] out of the
[27:28] our leadership what is it it's satan
[27:31] behind it
[27:32] and he is yet angry angry
[27:35] against god for kicking him
[27:38] out of the heavenly places that are in
[27:42] christ jesus
[27:43] but thanks god that god through his
[27:46] love has brought us into his beloved
[27:49] and placed us into those same heavenly
[27:53] places
[27:54] and made us that you are the ones
[27:58] that will be in charge of the garden
[28:01] you are the ones that will say what you
[28:05] should say and receive the glory
[28:08] for i've placed these things under your
[28:11] feet
[28:12] thank god even satan satan
[28:15] is placed under our feet you will tread
[28:18] upon serpents

[28:23] your hands upon the sick
[28:25] and they shall recover why for we are
[28:28] more than conquerors through him that
[28:31] loved us
[28:32] oh glory be to god hallelujah
[28:36] and thou shalt have tribulation
[28:40] in 10 10 days of course we know
[28:45] that the church age of smyrna
[28:50] is a prototype or a a nursery
[28:55] of what it will be like
[28:58] during that time called the tribulation
[29:01] period so in this he's saying
[29:05] you will be cast into the tribulation
[29:09] tribulation for 10 days
[29:12] of course we understand that 10 days
[29:15] means
[29:16] 10 years for the
[29:20] efficiency smyrna church of smyrna
[29:23] ran from three or 2 a.d
[29:26] to 3 12 a.d
[29:30] oh praise god amen except for the mercy
[29:34] of god
[29:35] be true believers elected
[29:38] i'm not talking about people calling
[29:41] themselves
[29:41] christians but those that are the
[29:45] married wife they elected
[29:49] the the gods few
[29:52] his little flock his lambs
[29:56] that are despised rejected and killed
[29:59] all the day long
[30:00] in every way but thank god his love
[30:03] endures forever
[30:05] the love of god is greater far than
[30:08] tongue or men shall ever tell or thank
[30:11] god forever may his love flood your soul
[30:15] flood my soul flood our lives that we
[30:19] may walk talk
[30:20] live and move within this environment
[30:23] and atmosphere
[30:25] of the love of god flowing through us
[30:28] day by day glory to his name amen
[30:33] hallelujah friends the scripture further
[30:37] reads
[30:38] be thou faithful unto death
[30:42] he does not say be faithful until
[30:45] you die or until death but be
[30:49] faithful unto death and we
[30:52] we may have to seal our testimony with
[30:55] our blood we don't know thousands
[30:59] even millions have died during the ages
[31:03] like antipas the great martyr
[31:06] of god in the bible who held not his
[31:10] life
[31:11] dear unto death for the glory of god
[31:15] now you may think it's impossible to to
[31:18] be a martyr
[31:19] and we are all humans we we think of our
[31:23] flesh we think of our
[31:24] bodies and so on you think it's
[31:26] impossible
[31:27] but because of this
[31:31] perfect faith that dwells within you
[31:35] at that time if you are to face that
[31:38] god through that will raise
[31:42] up a standard in you that will
[31:45] give you the courage the faith the
[31:48] boldness that you will not even seek or
[31:51] feel
[31:52] but you will walk into god's divine
[31:55] purpose and into his will like
[31:58] danielle shadrach and abednego
[32:01] they walked into the fire singing
[32:04] praising
[32:05] and glorifying god and thank god his
[32:08] promise is still true
[32:10] i'll be with you for for nebuchadnezzar
[32:15] saw in the fire of fort man
[32:18] in the fire and that fought man the
[32:22] son of god jesus christ the same
[32:26] yesterday today and forever
[32:29] hallelujah that same fate
[32:34] that empowered polycarp
[32:38] latimer and ridley at the stake many
[32:42] others
[32:43] that died for jesus sake that same
[32:47] power will anoint you be with you
[32:51] overshadow you and and be with you every
[32:54] step of the way
[32:56] fear not little flock it is your
[32:58] father's good pleasure
[33:00] to give you the kingdom supreme
[33:03] faith will give you supreme grace
[33:08] to meet the challenge of that supreme
[33:11] hour
[33:11] blessed be god forever to him be all the
[33:14] glory
[33:15] and then it further reads
[33:19] i will give thee a crown of life
[33:23] this is not a promise of a man who says
[33:26] i'll do this i'll do that
[33:28] and when the time comes circumstances
[33:31] holds him blocks him and keeps him
[33:35] from doing or performing his promise
[33:38] this is the almighty speaking this is
[33:41] the great
[33:41] i am speaking he says i
[33:44] will give thee a crown of life
[33:48] oh thank god hallelujah my friend
[33:52] not even a cup of water given by someone
[33:56] to you passes by his
[33:59] eyes he will reward everyone
[34:03] and reward everyone that does
[34:07] something for his people or anything
[34:10] that his people
[34:11] does for him in his name
[34:15] he promises to reward them by giving
[34:18] them
[34:19] the crown of life that he gave to the
[34:22] martyrs
[34:24] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[34:26] hallelujah
[34:27] amen yes sir you can compare this to the
[34:31] crown
[34:32] that's given in the roman times in a
[34:34] race
[34:36] when they had the marathons and the
[34:39] winner of the marathon
[34:41] will be given a garland or crown
[34:45] platted out of palm or olive
