TRANSCRIPT
========================================
since just as surprised as you are see her Brotherhood florals and so we're here because he loved to assemble in the Church of God with the inspiration of God's Word under the revelation of this hour because we know that that's God with us amen and so that's so let's open our Bibles tonight thank you we're gonna be reading from first Corinthians chapter 13 we're gonna read verse 9 and 10 I'm going to read it from King James Version and then take it from the amplified version and before we do that let's just pray father we just thank you tonight Lord for the opportunity that we can assemble with you because every time you draw together with this purpose in our hearts of God to assemble under your revealed Word of God for this day Lord we get excited because we know that it greatly you are the seed father and so we just ask you to take control of the service now for a speaker to hear the Lord we surrender ourselves to your service Lord being you have control and may you just meet the needs in our midst tonight Lord speak to every need father you're still the same discerner of the thoughts and the hearts of your children and people leave here different than what we entered in Jesus Christ praise God 1st Corinthians chapter 13 verse 9 it says for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away in the amplified version the same scripture it says for our knowledge verse 9 for our knowledge dis fragmentary incomplete and imperfect and our prophecy our teaching is fragmentary incomplete and imperfect but when the complete and perfect total comes the incomplete and the imperfect will naturally become antiquated void and supersede [Music] so you know I was you know I got a call from past and our surprise our brother just could not be here and so when the call comes you know we have to be prepared so I just immediately started to get nervous you know I immediately actually what I did because I just got pulled work and so I and then I was still nervous and I said water prayer and so I went to prayer and you know I just trusted the Lord and I managed to put this together by the grace of God but you pray you pray and you believe and I believe that we can all be here so blessed and so encouraged because it brings him on the scene when we okay with certain expectation I come with certain expectations together we can do something by the grace of God and so here you know I want to talk about the title tonight is that which is perfect is come and you know collective in the message masterpiece brother privately the speaking here he says now watch every masterpiece is put on the foundation a sculptor he goes on and he says now the bodywork that come home to this great masterpiece was the prophets which was the work I hope you can really see the prophets not the moms it's not the moss that that is actually building the body that is actually giving you your walk giving you your experience with the boss just like the positive therapy speed and you break the law or you're gonna be penalized and there's laws that not pleased with it is word that's for everybody and when you break those possible there's a penalty to those lots but that's not the basis and the foundation of your walk it is not because then it becomes like it doesn't become an experience with God it becomes more of a master schoolmaster and student but we are not students we are sons and daughters of God and become with the revelation that we are a son and that's what the salvation that we experienced was it wasn't that we came to it all turn you know we we repented and on that day we were saved you're a son of all places that would not to you you actually work it brought you into a personal relationship with him and so that relationship was not based on the laws of the word it was based on him the word himself speaking to you and so this party that's being built up it's all for one purpose because back to the Darby it was God without a feed but we need to understand out of us out of this a reflection of Christ is a reflection of God coming down into a human vessel because you desire to fellowship with his after each image we have to express them we have to manifest them and place them in front of him so that he could see them experience them and just it just satisfied praise God it's like you it's like you fellowship with somebody that you love and they start to express back to you what it is that's in your thoughts your mind the the meaning behind the revelation behind what he said it pleases the other person yeah and it brings unity a breeze communion and it's a tremendously and so here now God was building back the body the Old Testament was leading to the coming of the Lord the first coming of the Lord and he used not the law but the prophets to speak the word so that so that the Spirit of God into a human form known as the Lord Jesus Christ somebody to go to the cross and redeem and bring Redemption for the body of Christ and then there's an apple from from you know from the frost and now there's another building of a new body of which is called the body of Christ in the female form it's Eve now being restored and in the same way that he brought Jesus Christ in the 2,000 years ago by the prophets by speaking a virgin shall conceive when that went forth was the Spirit of God prophesied that there would be a virgin so many hundreds of years down the road that would precede the Word of God and come into manifestation what was saying he's still the same yesterday the same thing is taking place now he's using his word to restore the e ya e the body of Jesus Christ known as the pride amen and so here now the prophets not the laws he says the prophets for the prophets was the vindicated word which makes the body not the patriarchs the prophets they were the word and so finally he started way back in the days of Moses and coming down through the prophets to each one and finally building up the body coming closer all the time and then come finally the great egg the head of it all the rest of the body just spoken it the foundation was laid by the Patriots but the body was built by the word Amen man which was the prophets and so in this day God has promised we would the whole ministry but within that ministry within that Bible history there are major prophets Fox of God and then have to speak the word incapacity and you as a son or a daughter of God when you receive your season you become the voice of reaching above getting to your position why is God lead us to get into our position because the body cannot be made perfect without each part in its rightful position can you imagine you take a body you take the arm and you attach it to the knee it doesn't look right it doesn't work right but whether the body is perfectly placed together and each individual recognizes their position in the body then everything starts to work normal everything starts that by itself your body gets weak and get sick it has the spoken word of God that set out of the Lord that he learned all of my diseases it's been spoken to your luck horse manure [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] to this message that church was not a place but church was actually the mystical supernatural of Jesus Jesus came on the scene their headpiece was put upon him the entire handiwork of duck we find him the perfect reflection of work for he was the word the fullness of the word now God has the perfect masterpiece and here we are now we're coming into our positions because the season is that he which is perfect has come which is perfect has come you see there has to come a time when that perfect word has to come to this body so that it can recognize exactly who she is they better praise God in Colossians 1 verse 17 it says that he is before all things and by him all things consist he's the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence his desire is to have total and complete preeminence in this but the only way that that can happen is that a perfect revelation of who he is in you has to be you have to come into your perfect revelation of the pocketable perfect in this what we start to look to try and be perfect in this because you're only gonna fool yourself this cannot be made perfect this this has to be changed in order to be made perfect change from up of this dimension - your party said chic today police speaking lives and you must be born again and must put on incorruption in order for this interruption it's got to become immortal you cannot become immortal in this flesh you've gotta be looking for perfection [Music] this is receiving God's perfect revelation of you your part and your place in the and so he cannot do that without you giving them full preeminence you've got a comfortable place where you completely and totally surrender your thoughts your ideas your interpretation get rid of your interpretation caucus its own interpreter and we're not looking to try and interpret this word and get into you know why on the Prophet said this you said it that way you know if you don't see exactly that way and you're missing it that's not what it is it's easy to be a parent it's easy to pull what the problem set but it's another thing to have the same spirit that was in the Prophet [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] you can't really rest when things are not in all situations around your life it's hard to get a good night's rest Sasa that you fall asleep for an hour and then look out if you wake up an hour later you're making better crime boss scared right to the ceiling and all those thoughts are poured into your head because [Music] [Music] [Music] because he uses your crane to play these spots in there to inspire you to speak those negative things this is being brought together by a prophecy of God's Word and then that season [Music] I'll ask you don't like we just ready for a personal Indians 13 you know if we continue to read on take a few minutes read back the chapter and see what it says you know we're always talking about you know we're like you know you can prophesy speaking tongues to go you can put your own interpretation you can get everything he says you can bring a problem you can bring this you bring up the lessons in your life be spoken because total success so you can know by your ministry by what it is that you're doing that how is that hear your part in this church because this don't try to live any higher then right here or goddess place - you can't fool God if you're the body of Christ and those placed you in this church you know for a purpose you need to get into your position you need to take you serious you need to realize that that's where God meets you when you're in your position [Music] speaking in tongues people you know get into arguments because they learn you know we didn't do it quite possible the Word of God and they come in there under the inspiration of God and say foolishness he says unless you come to a place where you received revelation wow you you start to operate in your position and Saints I'm telling you I have seen it we are seeing it as the leadership of this church we're starting to see how certain parts into their positions the right place before God wants them to be and they know that and that supernaturally God starts to vindicate that position you wonder why sometimes [Music] [Music] working at wherever it is that you're working that is a place of employment you have bosses they make certain decisions those decisions should not concern you you should be only concerned about what God is saying about you what your future holds is clear [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] for your position in your position not the way you see yourself so we give him the preeminence Ava and so we didn't love her in the message Christ is revealed in his whole word but Bruce has seeped out through the a to be stirred it up from the foundation from the first church age when the seed went in the ground the complete see that had come up through the feet Luther come back up and through Westie then into the Pentecostals the Tonys in the lips see now it's in the eyes prophetic work [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] and so forth now there's nothing but [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that which is perfect is come Wow things are going to change when that revelation which is perfect about you comes in to you personally if your walk with God things are gonna change around you're gonna realize that that all your reading is about of the station because that perfect work cannot fail so he said the next is the intelligence and we have no one temperature tomorrow see what Brad was was was was prophesied this why he was seeing exactly how this why he was gonna all come together 55 years later since the Prophet has gone off the sea and here we are and this body is a lot further along than it was back there and how you the left by the revelation they get received from this hour and how it's giving you perfect faith listen I don't know about you but I got involved in a lot of different things in life we turned a lot of different things you get excited for two months three months five months later and here we are some of us I'm twenty five hundred and twenty-fifth year of this message I work cycle the Word of God because I've seen come into supernatural manifestation you know they are so been me teaching them that we came from as a southern government because you are a son or daughter you always work that's why we feast on the fresh revelation that's why you've beast on his presence when you come into the house the Lord we thirst and under after you see and so here that what brother was actually seeing that intelligence to the box because it's all based on the word being spoken he's done the same yesterday today and forever don't look for anything to change your gonna go of the translation because of the revelation coming to the Bible ministry these open directly into you and you can see that you can contact with it there's a deep that possible doing in response and the spot takes place and something supernatural starts to happen and you start to realize this [Applause] [Music] what happened position as a song God you see the difference when you get that that's why that's why Holy Spirit left every church age because men started to put his own interpretation of the word let us never forget we do not put our alternate interpretation on where to go what happened to the seventh under doctrine both endlessly truth but when they take it and they make it into something where they say to somebody you don't see this there's something wrong you need to see you're not with your character you're falling back you're being left by a personality that's why you can't let my personality we can do that by the word it's the word that gets free from this pulpit that excites us and why we come into the house Lord they the 300 so the next is the intelligence and we have no intelligence of our own we have no strength of our own I can foresee those things it's God himself see it's becoming to a place and he's governed the body all the way through that he completed the body of Christ then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a breath that was taken out of his side Allu and so like Adam did the beginning like others plus rather at the beginning all right the entire Bible is the entire revelation of Jesus Christ making himself known to every page he made himself known to the victim Peter has a foundation the church waits like he did keep the devil kanessa this is everything that we see in the scriptures it's always a perfect type of what Christ is doing right now in the church everything regardless that's why he told Moses of you see Christ in every word of the Bible you're missing something you need to go back because this God himself condescending in the plan of redemption amen he comes from the beat up see he come from the head down until he come down so by herself become flesh at the foot of the ladder now here in the New Testament he brings himself right back - they have both to be proud even everything is a perfect type and so we now recognizing that God sent a prophet to restore the Word of God also recognize that in 1963 came down to me that was 1963 that's like 67 or 57 years ago correct me if I'm wrong okay 63 37 is a hundred and then 19's over 57 years right since the body of since the head came down to the body he's been working for 57 years now to us we think in time but to God he's eternal he doesn't think in time he doesn't need you as a creature of eternity he sees you as a son all that needs to happen is his thought expressed to you in who tomorrow brings you into your decision and it can change and that's why youth with this miracles sometimes because God can instantly change your situation it's really changed her sickness instantly change your financial position it's really changed your relationships and it can instantly do those things because he's got me but he needs us to come to my recognition of how Christ operates in the body to the place where you start to recognize how to apply the Word of God knowing what to do with the Word of God the wine now the intelligence controlling blood and so Betty started and rising sea from the feet he begin to build the church the bride coming back on back and now coming out into the head slowly where it all turns together and makes the one great transfigured body of Jesus Christ now not he says now it's set and dig itself the day between that time will be kind of like oh like a dis little dark thing so it'll be like you know the evening time it'll be kind of like where there'll be a lot of uncertainty and that's the page that were actually in right now that's why the message is flowing through this this change right now because it's in that stage of light and darkness and there's a great part of the way that's taking place because as the word gets Lord we deal it's what a manifest darkness and the microcephaly it's not that you are going to are so much that people are falling away though that most actually that you are progressive in the Word of God and you're moving on to those that don't have this revelation they just can't keep up they just can't stay with it there's some reason they just can't keep up that consistency they start this he says you have to make it over it as a son or daughter of God you've been given Dominion so you gotta be careful of what manse that's driving you and pulling you and taking you from the things of God the simple things of whatever position in the church I see some individuals you know their cleaners [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and we must stay in this discipline time and there's there's there's you know there's a lot of falling away that's taking place that should actually encourage you to see that Scriptures being just getting out much closer to the actual goal way of the church praise now I'm just going to continue reading here that Christ is revealed as a little girl he says but now it's in the I tell you to see see now there isn't one movie the faculty beyond the I is the is that my brother burger delivered he was a prophet he saw he was given patient he saw this church age and in the twentieth century bleep mess he saw that he had come to extort he saw [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] there was different people you see that was what I saw some kind of interpretation of but this is not the scene age this is the relationship and this is the seven seals and the seventh seal in particular that contains your name on the book of life this is a lot of supernatural column that you get sick and tired of these these these trials and the situations that you have you can see in Thailand but that something raises up in you which is called holy ghost [Music] what you are supposed to be glory so where that age now this is back to your eyes there's nothing that moves he says and now we find out that that part is she there is nothing beyond the eye then come the Pentecostal age that would come into the different fingers and things the Pentecostal age talk about Louise reviewing it all up toes and nose and so forth no it's in the past do you realize where he was we're not in the Isaac we're beyond where the supernatural [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this is he says now it's in the odds what good will you need eyes or need but if that eyes was there to see there has to be I first see and then that come he open the seven seals and reveal the evening [Music]
