TRANSCRIPT
========================================
here it's not like you're going to lose your position you know it's not like the young Bulls are going to come charging down the p and and and in like in Spain and just uh bully and push out to uh the older lions or something like that but the fact is that's what's happening right now and whether we like it or not you can't turn back the time right can't turn time back we're all getting older and they um are young and strong and smart and everything else and we need to see how we can integrate them into what God is trying to do for their hour how they can find their places in the body of Christ and in the kingdom of God amen amen praise the Lord because then all it will be to them is just a sing song and this is not just a sing song Amen it's more than music and and and everything else like that it's more than that every True Believer whether there be a young person or an adult must catch a genuine revelation of God Amen I'm not talking about the knowledge of the message I know people been in the message for 30 40 years and they still have really called a revelation when you C called a revelation then nobody has to actually be your um give you an Impulse you actually have it within you and and you want to do it you want to do something for God because you got something not me telling you not the pastor telling you but you got something because you C the Revelation then that Revelation RS you up and you equi by the Holy Spirit to do things for the glory of God Amen I didn't plan to talk like that it just happened to say that in passing but I hope it applies to you and touches your heart happy to see every one of you here praise the Lord good to see you sister glad that you're here in the house of the Lord glad to see every one of you God richly bless you here today um we're going to also have the Lord's supper or brothers prepared for that right right after the service uh we're going to have the Lord's Supper um and the washing of the Saints feet which means that the the the sisters will go downstairs and that's where they will do that and brothers will uh stay up here just like lighting this before I go to the uh teaching for today and you I've made allowance for the fact that we have to do all these things so it's not like I'm going to preach a 4-Hour sermon right or anything like that I factored it in because I I realized many years ago as I was the very first in Toronto um to change from the two services that we used to have um and that's way back in 19 uh 74 somewhere in there and 74 uh and um amen wow amazing wow anyway just to let you know that um there in Toronto of course there was only um there wasn't even a church there was no church there brother Bob ivany that was in in Miss Saga which was just a lot of farms and Bush and trees and stuff like that and that church has marked and changed they went to Streetsville and they went to Milton and uh and that church of course stands today as a testimony testimony to that um old brother's um work and victory I was talking this with uh brother Sak who was one of the early ones that was done basement just a few of them in basement and now there's a wonderful Church in Milton um where they're giving God glory and praise amen then because they were out in missa and of course the Subway Lines only ran as far as isling you didn't go any further um there's no way to get into Miss unless you got a taxi or a bus being a new immigrant at the time uh coming in 1972 um is hard to find a bus and a taxi plus it will take you so long that uh it was a waste of time so I went a couple of times and stop and then later on as you know witnessing to people that my house got filled and and then the church next door we started in the church next door brother Nelson at that time came his wife my wife we started just fellowshipping and then the church grew by the grace of God um and uh from that um from that uh later on as the Lord uh should gave me uh the vision of my car coming in this direction and going into the micro area and uh the tire blowing up and Sur enough when I obeyed that and we were on our way moving my furniture and coming down the tire went um on the car by the grace of God and so from that this church started in St Catherine uh by the grace of God started there and the church in Toronto that was there went into two parts brother Luke and brother uh Nelson uh there but we know that they both still exist um they're still there by the grace of God later on brother John T joined me when I was in um moved from St Catherine the church had grow and I was in uh Stony Creek wion Winona and the white church there and um was the worship leader now when I'm saying these things the devil is so cunning sometimes it makes it sounds like you're trying to put down the preacher but it's not that's not what I'm trying to do here I'm just trying to give you a background of the history of what went on um actually in this onario if you want to put it back way and so um as you know later on brother John felt the calling of God and he started the work up there and this church supported that by the grace of God did you know that yeah uh how many how many 100 chairs we literally gave 150 chairs and stuff like that you know we we gave for the for that church to really start to find its foing and to grow by the grace of God as to the petrolea church that's myself and brother uh Humes brother Brandon's old friend brother Tim Humes as father um that went in of course the olon brothers were in there first but what happened is that Jerry also left and went away and left about five people or so in there and so they they called for us and brother hes and myself went in there and preaching an old United Church Revival broke out we baptized sister Annie and her husband and several others and the Genesis of the church started to grow now that church still stands there today what I'm saying is you don't look at this church look at just the people in it the size of it or anything like that to know the real power of a church right that's not the power of a church look at all the churches that came out from this church and we don't hold any control or anything like that we just released it I mean if you start to talk about Grado if you talk about Africa if you talk about here and there it's there praise the Lord so just so that you know that that that's what the Lord has been doing um in this area but I'm sure to get more of I drift away from what really intended to tell you what uh let me get get to my subject here today we're going to be chatting all [Music] afternoon right let's read from Romans chapter 12 verse one only Roman Romans 12 verse 1 this it's such a short verse let's all read it together and I'm going to hear your voice right don't swallow your your voice uh open your mouth so I can hear it okay praise the Lord all right let us uh uh pray and then begin father we ask your blessing upon this entire service today we welcome brother Mike and his family back all those who are away we welcome them and we pray you'll bless and anoint the word of God to our hearts and lift us up father May the word of God Lift us up today as we commit ourselves to thee break every uh chain of unbelief father take away every uh contrary Spirit from us and father bring our hearts in subjection to the word we ser render All To Thee now and we pray that you will come forth and bless your people in spite of our shortcomings oh God take your glory in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen praise the Lord read out of Romans now I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God let you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service let me completed with the second verse and be not confirmed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God may the Lord bless our words please be seated of course we want to talk about sacrifice and mainly about a Living Sacrifice and Lord placed that uh so much on my thoughts so I just thought I'd talk about it for a while first of all the meaning of the word sacrifice out of dictionary.com no more finding a big dictionary and twisting the pages but digital they said here um it says here to make a sacrifice or offering to surrender or give up something or permit injury or disadvantage to forsake or forsake something for something else to dispose of your goods property Etc regardless of profit right uh as such now the sacrifice itself may be a animal a plant or human life or some material possession to a deity as in propitiation or in worship or homage the person or animal or the thing being offered is called that sacrifice the thing surrendered or devoted to the deity is called a sacrifice a loss incurred in selling something below its value is called a sacrifice also called sacrifice burn sacrifice amen just a few things I wanted you to have that now of course that's the natural meaning of that word um sacrifice a sacrifice is actually an outward expression of man's Duty uh towards God uh and this uh man's uh sacrifice is a symbol of his communion with God and it's a very important ingredient in our relationship with God let's talk a little bit about history as I lay in just a bit of a background here of course uh sacrifice uh started in the beginning the first evidence of it is in the Book of Genesis with uh Abel the Bible tells us Abel offered a better sacrifice in actual fact it seems like God instituted sacrifice because it wasn't strange um for Cain or Abel to bring a a sacrifice they knew they had to do some kind of a sacrifice to God but one had a revelation of what the sacrifice was to be and the other one had no understanding whatsoever but it started with uh Abel then later on we know that uh the heathens had their own way of sacrifice they sacrificed animals they sacrifice even humans we know parents will take their God and their child and throw it to the crocodiles in the Nile uh because they believe that was of God then we know that the um Philistines the amalekites the midianites they took their child and give it to the god shos which is a great big Stone god with a with fire in his belly and they would go and throw uh their child into the belly of that God thinking that that will create blessing for them and then later on you know other cultures other societies it was adults it was maidens that were taken and and offered to these Gods all uh all trying to uh of course appease that God of course as Believers now we know that they were just under the Same Spirit of King they they had no revelation of what kind of sacrifice they ought to offer righten and therefore they offered what they believe was the best thing they had right they choose the choices of their flock their best looking daughter the their most perfect looking and that's the one that they'll take and offer to these gods and of course that was wrong it was against the word of God Amen and now uh of course you know God himself said you know uh the Lord needed nothing the Lord has need of nothing other words that he doesn't really need anything praise the Lord the C on Thousand Hills belong on him what can you offer me that I don't already have you see so really the offerings that we make and the sacrifices we make it's not for our for for God really it's not for God it's for ourselves Because by the offering you make God knows what's in your heart and God knows your loyalty to him and your surrender to him okay so now so before the law that's the way it was then we understand later on how Abraham came along and Abraham offered up Isaac uh up on and Isaac went and he obediently obeyed his father and laid himself on that uh fire ready to be offered up and you know the story God stopped Abraham when he was about to uh stabed Isaac and uh told him no there's a ram over there he turned and there was a ram in the thicket and later on he went got the ram out and offered that uh to God um so so we see there clearly of course that God later on uh during the law instituted animal sacrifices animal sacrifices and of course that was only temporary because it was a tipe for the reality that was yet to come so now what happened is that they started to abuse even the sacrifices they started buying and selling of cows and sheep and you know and selling doves and and gradia it putting it in grades that if you're rich you can offer a cow if you're a little less Rich then you can come with a sheep uh if you don't have money for sheep then you can offer a pigeon right and then if you got no money even for that then you can offer a little Dove right you come with a little money and you at least you can get two dos and sell so they had a bre they ended up having a commercial uh situation going on in the temple courts right where they were gathering there and selling cattle and everything else like that so that's what the background of sacrifice is but of course sacrifice also has its significance which is it was anticipatory or a type of the Lord Jesus Christ who was to come that would be the ultimate sacrifice okay now in Switzerland there came uh this uh young man by the name of Abraham bener himself and his family left uh that Nation to come to the United States of America but while they were on the Atlantic Crossing it's not like today you getting a plane and Zoo you know you're there within hours or you get on a ship and the ship is going to take uh you know a couple of days or so to cross the ocean um my goodness it it took months right so during that Journey his parents died he was just a young boy I think he was about 10 years old and what happened that Dy he made the crossing landed in the United States of America here he was in a strange country a Strange Land but he did not give up amen he did not cry and complain somehow he managed and began to work brothers and sisters let me tell you uh by the way his parents were were were Believers but he wasn't converted but anyway the fact is that he was able to hold on amen amen and I want to encourage you whatever you may be going through right now hanging there amen hold on and allow God to have his way in your life amen anyway as he grew older teenag or so uh he happened to come in contact with a church and the preacher preaching the word he got converted he repented of his sins and became a Believer but that set his soul on fire that's the kind of young people I would like to see today uh who when they receive the word of God and their candle got lit according to the prophet he said then they need to go out with that Lit candle and spread the word amen instead what we find today we are encouraged to sit and serve right but God didn't call us to sit down God didn't call us to spectate he call us to participate amen he called us to be a part of his work of what he's trying to do and what he's trying to accomplish that's what God is doing in this hour in this season and time so this young man was on fire from God and uh he had heard about the suffering of the slaves in uh St Thomas the Virgin Islands under the US uh control uh and so back then there were uh s the slaves there some were s there some were in the South picking cotton other ones were uh doing the sugar and the rum and stuff like that on uh in St Thomas so he heard about their suffering and he decided he was going to go there and see how he could help them to his surprise when he tried to get there he was told nobody is allowed to go and preach to the slaves so he was shocked he was amazed nobody allowed to preach to those slaves except for slaves themselves a slave that's already a slave he can preach for a slave so he sat down he prayed to God but he was so on fire and he wrote a letter to the governor and the letter to the governor was to ask the governor to make him into a slave because he willingly now give up his entire rights to his freedom and everything else I'm talking about a young man just teenage give up all his rights because he wants to be a slave so he can go preach to the slave it so touched the governor that an knowing to him the Governor transferred the letter to the king and uh there the king sent back an authorization which was never given to anybody else to give him complete freedom of all the territories there so that he could go wherever he wished to go and preach to whoever he wished to preach to amen praise the Lord what I'm trying to show you is this man was willing to sacrifice himself and his freedom for the sake of the Lord Jesus Christ The Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ amen yes sir but here we are today we got all the freedom in the world that we can speak to any and everybody and now we don't use that freedom for God's glory uh we actually hold on and don't use it because of chist shamefacedness you know selfishness carnality oh you know somebody's going to insult me well they whipped him to death I mean he led himself to death um spit upon and everything else he said if I suffer I'm your Lord and Master and I suffer he said aren't you going to suffer too are you gr than your lord you going to have to have some of those things happen too if you're going to win people to Christ amen uh you uh uh he came to us when we were unlovely and when we were unloved is that right then he reached down his hand for us and we have got to learn to go beyond our comfort zone amen amen go beyond your comfort zone to reach out to people whom you may not personally like is that right people you may not personally like or love but you got to reach out that is Our obligation as Believers to make a sacrificial gift to the glory of God now I beee you therefore Brethren amen by the mercies of God that you present your bodies as a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable un to God which is your reason service now you know all sacrifices if they're going to be offered they first had to be killed you kill the Sacrifice from Elijah to Elisha to everyone and they kill the sacrifice the only sacrifices that we see in the Bible where the sacrifice willingly went and lay itself on the altar is Isaac who was a type of Christ who like a lamb allowed himself to be led to the slaughter and before his sharers he stood dumb right what was he doing he was showing us an example that we had to be living sacrifices for his glory amen all the sacrifices of the heathens had to die and when they were dead then they were offered but we are allowed the opportunity to consciously be aware of what they're doing and yes Lord surrender ourselves to him and give him our service not because somebody beat us there or or or we we have to be killed in that fashion but we willingly give him our service and everything we do for him we are ready and willing to sacrifice for the glory of God Amen now we thank God of course that uh for that he set us apart from all creation amen you are set apart from the whole creation as Servants of the Living God and called out for his glory that you might do what that you might offer him the sacrifice of your life of your service and David said I want to offer him the sacrifice of praise I want to give God the sacrifice of praise that is so important now friends when you offer that sacrifice of praise it's not always easy to praise God is that right yes sometimes you got to wake up yourself to praise God Hallelujah the sacrifice of prayer you got to offer to God sometimes you got to shake yourself to pray amen especially in this age that we're living in where Darkness seems to come right down and press on you heaviness comes and press on you sleep and press on you is that right oh yeah of course the devil don't want you to just pray to God or C down the holy ghost or like that so um he'll you know just make you fall asleep come absolutely I've literally been in a prayer meeting where there's an elder of the church and prayers going on and everybody glory to God hallelujah and everything else going and he falls asleep in in the middle of all that R and so around that time you know we had a visiting uh speaker from the United States and so the minister one of the ministers turned and said and now we ask our precious brother mallister to take our brother that's visiting before the Lord in prayer that God will have a breakout in signs and wonders and miracles Among Us the word to be fulfilled in everything like that and and then uh as in a SP second we realized that he's sleeping so one of us that was near him give him a little what like that but he's an old veteran you know so he starts out praying but he doesn't start out like you would have started out father tonight know he starts out at a high pitch as if he was in everything else oh God I come in the name of Jesus to pray for our brother our brother what's the brother's name Lord help us you know and there he was caught you don't want to be caught like that do you I said you don't want to be caught like that you it sounds like you well I hope you're not C like that to amen praise the Lord I hope everybody's a bit now everybody away now come on show that you know preaching is Warfare the devil is going to do his part and the preacher has to do his part to R back the territory so that's all I'm trying to do here for the glory of God glory to God so friends we are not here to offer dead meaningless sacrifices praise the Lord or worthless sacrifices amen and I'm not talking about when it comes down time for Lent you say brother I'm going to sacrifice fish today but it's only one day and tomorrow you can make up for the fish that you lost for the for the one day so that's no sacrifice whatsoever you need a real sacrifice f is that right and so you know you got to be able to really give up something you really got to let go of something completely with whatever that is you got to cease doing something that you used to do and say I won't do it anymore then you're talking about a real sacrifice other than that it's not a very real sacrifice so friends we don't want to offer dead sacrifices but living sacrifices to the glory of God so we know that the Lord himself is the ultimate sacrifice and he offered himself up for us amen praise the Lord now what can we do what can we sacrifice for him and for his glory if I want to turn let me turn this conversation have you ever stop and think about all the Young Veterans that died in the last Wars for us to be able to get our freedom you know most of them were just like 18 between 18 and 20 something years old they were just boys and they went to bathroom to be able to allow us to keep our freedom an old German submarine was found as far in the St Lawrence River so if they had a little bit more time they would have been trying to take North America to so don't think because Europe is far away we are over here that we were actually safe no they had already gone into Africa gone to South South America and they were penetrating North America too if that war wasn't stopped so you've got to understand here that we have got veterans that fought for our freedom and sacrifice what the ultimate sacrifice of their lives am praise the Lord their lives is the sacrifice that they make I want stop and talk also mention here and I'm just being brief with this subject here today I want to mention uh many of you can think about your own parents amen I don't think I have much to explain there but I know the sacrifices my parents made what about your parents they make any sacrifices amen and when it comes to parents uh it's equal because sometimes times I've seen some fathers that made some sacrifices that was so unbelievable they work themselves to the Bone to make sure that their families are taken care of is that right and any any real genuine man uh would want to be that way is that right a real a real man that's the way he wants to be want to provide he wants to protect um you know and he wants to uh preserve whatever is his uh by the grace of God so when I think about the sacrifices of my parents of the appearance of many other people that I know uh and mothers that I know would rather to go without eating a meal so that their children could have a meal amen I seen fathers that go without meals for days so that their family could have meal and that they could be taken care of by the grace of God you're talking about people that give that really offered up a real sacrifice it's in that light I'm asking you how far are we willing to go to serve God this is something that we just want to talk about you know we ought to be able to offer up the sacrifice of praise there's a scripture I'm looking at it 2 Samuel uh 2 4 around verse uh 24 also when David actually went to buy a piece of ground ground and uh uh and then this gentleman Aruna said to him you no you're the king you can have it I I'll give this uh land and property to you for free and David said no I will surely buy it from you for a price nor will I offer any burnt offerings to the Lord Lord my God which cost me nothing he will not offer any the god that cost him nothing and that he did not feel some sense of sacrifice amen many times we want to make sacrifices that cost us nothing amen well I guess I'll give a little extra in the offering this week because I have so much money left over and I used the word leftover advisably but um I'll just give the Lord a little extra because I have some leftovers and and you're not giving out of your need you're not giving it out like the Widow who actually needed that and yet by a revelation gave it for the glory of God so that's when you're talking about a real sacrifice right or else you you say you know brother Simon I don't have nothing to do today maybe this is the day to do something for the lord well that's good but uh that's not a real sacrifice because in the first place you have nothing to do you have all the time in the world and that's when you offer yourself to do something for the Lord we still welcome that but that's not a real Living Sacrifice praise the Lord but when uh you know I couldn't I don't know about brother Chris or brother this or brother that but uh somebody that's working for a few thousands of dollars a day and decide to say well brother you know I feel L the Lord that I should be in the church and I should do this and I should do that and I should do that so that's what the sacrifices they're losing something on one hand to be able to serve God on the other hand amen and so when we begin to die out to ourselves we begin to be ready and prepared to lose certain things that we can gain the grace of God and the love of God hallelujah amen Living Sacrifice I'm winding this down already because we have the Lord's Supper we have the baptism I'm not going to be but the fact is is that church attendants while you're alive and you're living you got to make the choice whether you be a church or not be a church right oh well I'll be in church on Sunday when everybody's there you know it's a good time for them everybody at least will know I'm in church but uh wednsday night there not you know not that many of them there so nobody will know that I'm there I'm not there so that's not important but you forgot the overall scripture for sake not the assembling of yourselves together at the manner of some else we don't want to get into all the little little um parts of it where okay I'm working on the ship that's why I couldn't be there or this or that as long as that's not the case we need to be in the house of the Lord amen praise the Lord okay we need to be in the house of the Lord and you say oh I went to work and I was tired well everybody and a worker was tired praise the Lord glory to God even the housewife at home that not a full day is time praise the Lord and of course if you have got work plus you got your regular work outside that you have to do then I know you're dou tired but then God didn't put in there um and if you're not tired forsake not is that how read it no he he didn't put anything on his said for sake not theing of yourself together as a manner of some else praise the Lord so we have to be in the house of God praise the Lord Brother himself talked about how many times he he had to get the church you know and and and he just hustling to get there because he was working on the lines and he had to run down because you know he used to the part lines run down get down get them from off of there quick and run and get this old beat up truck and scoop down the road he said and sometimes I only had enough time to uh pump some water in those old pumps they had there so he can wash his hands um like that and uh with all that sweaty clothes and everything else but he made sure he ran in the house of the Lord is that right brother Simon I can't come like that no you got to have a feather in your C right but God invites us to come into his house it's the act of obedience that's more important to God amen that you are in the house of the Lord because God has something for you to hear amen every Christian ought to read their Bible and pray amen of course if you want to make that that's a sacrifice that you have to make to read your Bible and pray every day praise God so you have to make that sacrifice that people will uh will see from the fruit of your life that you are a real genuine believer as you read your Bible and pray every day also it's a sacrifice to pay the tithes of your offering I was listening to hear I'm get a loud amen I want to pay my ti to my offerings praise the Lord yes sir uh it's something that we need to do for God's glory and uh sometimes it's a sacrifice at other times it's very easy for you to do but uh in all seasons and in all times we ought to obey the word of God and do what God says according to his word praise the Lord um and most of all when we come in the house of the Lord maybe you're down maybe you're feeling discouraged but let's offer him the sacrifice of praise amen and worship is that right God didn't call you as a Christian to be a firefighter when the fire God starts moving in the church God doesn't want you to put it out with your attitude and with your you know uh just a lowkey uh spirit and D everything no God wants us to add our lip of fire together with one another so that the place could be a blaze for the glory of God and praising God is a sacrifice but sometimes you got to sacrifice your PR your pride is that right because oh sister is not very expressive because she doesn't raise up her hand like that you know don't scream this way or whatever I'm not encourag you to be a vard you know uh that's not what I'm encouraging you to be but I'm telling you the same holy spirit that hit Miriam the same holy spirit that hit Mary the same holy spirit that hit them on the that Pentecost if it genuine she's going to make you act the same way or El out the spirit praise the Lord it'll make you be different you can't help it but that's the problem some people are afraid of how they might act if they let go and let the Holy Ghost have his way they're going to act different from themselves you're supposed to act different from yourself because it's not you as him and it's not yourself but the god of Heaven working and moving through your life praise the Lord so Brothers let me say this if you are going to finally uh off yourself to to be a Living Sacrifice you must repent of all your sins amen all your mistakes give them up and let go and let the Lord take charge of your life the greatest sacrifice you can make is to make your life an offering unto him amen Paul said that he has given his life to the Lord until he has offered it and now it has become a sweet smelling Savor or sacrifice unto the Lord his life his entire life become a sacrifice unto the Lord may the Lord bless you with this this meditation here today not really a message or a sermon but just a short meditation for you to think on this and see what it is that you will sacrifice for the Lord don't tell me pork don't tell me fish don't tell me any of those things I explain that to you because that's just natural I'm talking about spiritual things in your own life your own walk that you know within yourself that you would like to have transformed and changed uh by the spirit of almighty God praise the Lord we're going to change the order the service I'm going to ask for the might to come back up here uh maybe lead a few uh songs I'm going to let them um you leave a few songs brother uh Danielle uh you can get prepared now I'm going to look at myself from here while brother in this part of the service and as soon as he has been baptized we're going to do the Lord's um supper here Michael will take it U Back from me at that point give me a chance to do a quick change and be right back up okay bless you brother maybe we can stand at this time lord offer my life simple uh words but uh genuinely the truth I like what he said at the end there especially but Paul came to that place where his whole life became just a a perfume unto the Lord a sacrifice unto the Lord you know that happens today you know you just keep on surrendering keep on battling keep on pressing then one day you you find that it's like it just starts to become a perfume man automatically so uh praise God all that I am and all that I have I lay them down before you all my and all my
