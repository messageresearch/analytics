TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] hello friends brothers in christ once again it's marvelous to have the privilege of being here with you in the presence of the lord may the lord bless us all together as we look into the perfect law of liberty and freedom and deliverance most of all of eternal life god bless us all as we meditate and look into his perfect word given to us in this day and in this hour god bless you our topic for today will be the book of life and the white throne judgment now of course both are very huge large subjects but we want to at least begin to touch and teach on it the best we know how coming to you once again from god's storehouse the seven church age series in which we speak on this subject the background the wisdom the knowledge the inspiration uh that flowed through the 20th century prophet william marion branham god used him as the voice to this age that's what his purpose and role was to be the messenger to the seventh church age and the voice of god for this hour may the great holy spirit take the word of god grant it to us with understanding and with wisdom that we may take the word and apply it to this day apply it to the modern church and apply it to ourselves that we may recognize our position and place and time that we are in in the word of god in the book of revelations chapter 20 reading from verse 11. john speaking and i saw a great white throne and him not them and him that sat on it from the from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was no place found for them and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire of course reading from this scripture you will notice carefully it says and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life the books and the book of life now these books of course we should see them as the book of our lives our activities our works that we have done here on the earth you will read it in this very scripture itself you will be judged that which was written in the books according to their works so the books hold the evidence it holds of your activity of all of that you have done while up on the earth all your doings public and secret uh whatever it was the book of your life will be opened at the white throne judgment open for all to see for all are standing before the great white throne and there you stand alone and the book of your life is opened up for the seals are off of them nothing is hid anymore the great judge with fiery eyes the word of god which is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the mind looks and can see and know everything past present future whatever is going on and there you stand before him one to whom you cannot lie you cannot uh you cannot evade no lies no equivocation no machinations none whatsoever no slipperiness no clever whatever you can not for you are before the eyes of the living god who stares into your soul and sees your entire being amen the one who knows you before you were born the one who knows your entire path of life and the one who knows who you are standing before him every thought every word every activity and every doing private public whatever that one knows it and the books of our lives will be opened up before him nothing can be evaded it is the white tron judgment it is given unto men wants to die and after this the judgment yes my friends we must look clearly at the word of god may god help us to see whether we are in the first resurrection and rapture or in the second resurrection of the white throne judgment so the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged according to that which was written in that book of course in this study i cannot uh tell you everything about the book of life or about the white throne judgment i am giving you an overall picture as seen from the storehouse revelation given to the prophet william branham who fulfilled malachi 4 5 revelation 10 7 and made known to us the word of god for this day and for this hour whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire so we see the judgment is set the judge is there before us and before him the entire world but this is made up of the righteous and the unrighteous the believing and the unbelieving when i say the righteous will be in the judgment we are not speaking about the bride because the bride has already gone into the presence of god with the rapture and first resurrection she is caught up to the throne of god and is in the presence of god with our bridegroom jesus christ and the bible tells us more first corinthians 6 2-3 do you not know that the saints shall judge the world and if the world will be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters nor he not we shall judge angels how much more the things that pertain to life yes my friends daniel 7 9-10 i beheld till the thrones were cast down and the ancient of days did sit whose garment was white as snow his hair of his head white as wool the throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire and a stream issued and came forth from before him and thousands thousand thousands ministered unto him and tens of thousand times ten thousands stood before him the judgment was set and the books were opened amen for this is the opening of the books of the lives of all who stood before the great judge but let us notice carefully thousands upon thousands are ministering unto him this speaks of the bride ministering unto him being with him in the midst of the judgment judging the world according to the word of god first corinthians 6 2-3 that the saints shall judge the earth so with him she is seated with him ministering to him and judging the world together with him the question comes up who are these righteous ones that you're speaking of that will be in the judgment there's no other place these righteous can come up for the bride is already gone she's seated before them so who are these righteous where do they come from and where else could they come up there's these two resurrections the first one was gone and now it's the second left here amen they could not qualify for the first resurrection and rapture and so they find themselves left behind and left in the second resurrection which is a resurrection unto judgment the ones who qualify of course for the first resurrection and rapture which is the bride the bible clearly tells us they shall not come into judgment but have already passed from death unto life all blessed be his holy name i thank god for evermore for his grace john chapter 5 verse 24 tells us verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word amen and believe it on him that sent me amen hot everlasting life hath amen he has everlasting life praise god the believer of course is the one who has that eternal life and shall not come into condemnation hallelujah shall not come into any judgment but have passed which is to say they're permanently passed from death into life but not just carefully jesus must have yet another group in mind who at the judgment will receive eternal life amen not previously having received it as members of the bride yet they will have eternal life and not be in the bride but be servants or be ones that will be assistance with her john 5 28-29 marvel not at this for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation now we know in 4th john in john 5 28 and 29 that that is not the rapture this is the second resurrection which is one to judgment and damnation and it clearly tells us here because not only the dead in christ will rise from the grave at the time you know praise god we know that when you had the first resurrection the dead in christ rose up along with the living saints because in the rapture and the first resurrection some are already dead having died down through the seven church ages they are the ones that will be raised amen and the saints that are alive at the time the rapture takes place on the earth will be caught up with those ones that were already dead and buried and then raised up together as one group living and dead raised up caught up to meet the lord in the air oh praise god or what a meeting in the air what a meeting that will be my friends when we get together with god's great family praise god hallelujah amen now the bible tells us according to revelation 2011 15. how that the dead were brought before the lord and judged according to their works the first set do not go into a judgment they go into a rapture hallelujah this set of righteous and unbelievers they go into the white tron judgment before the great judge hallelujah now we face the question about these who would be given eternal life at the judgment since the epistles of paul clearly seems to point out amen that there are some found in the book of life who will either receive eternal life before the resurrection or after the resurrection and paul does not evade this truth but he speaks in the word philippians 3 11. if by any means i might attain to the resurrection of the dead hallelujah well we know that we're if we are believers we are all going in a resurrection whether we want to be in the resurrection or not we're going in a resurrection all will be resurrected amen so when paul says oh that i might attain to the resurrection of the dead obviously he's not speaking of the second resurrection no one has to attain to that because all will be raised up at that time to be judged according to their works activities doings but the first resurrection that is what he's speaking of that he wanted to be he was just saying i want to be in the first resurrection i want to be raised up in the first resurrection i don't want to miss it lord friends that should be our prayer also i don't want to miss it lord i want to be in the rapture i want to be in the first resurrection in the presence of the living god hallelujah amen praise god listen blessed and holy is he who had part in the first resurrection on such the second death has no power but there shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years hallelujah so the first resurrection the rapture and first resurrection has nothing whatsoever to do with the second death hallelujah for they already have eternal life they have no death in their future no hell in their future no fiery furnace in their future they don't have my friends any such thing in their future their future is clear all that stands before them is to continue to worship and to serve their lord with love with graciousness and to worship his holiness magnify him in his might giving glory to his marvelous and wonderful name praise god praise god hallelujah amen amen this second resurrection comes at the end of the thousand years of the bride and christ honeymoon after the marriage after the wedding is over after they've had a thousand years of millennia amen then is the second resurrection you can see why paul prayed and paul was saying oh i want to attend to the first i i don't want to be in the second because the force already has passed from death to life the second group that comes up with that second resurrection after the one thousand years of millennium will have to stand before the judge with fiery eyes at the white throne judgment now in that day there will be those who come up and come forth to eternal life and there will be the others that are caught in the stranglehold of the second death now we don't need to guess who these people are of these ones who are given eternal life in the presence of god because we are told that they are given them on the grounds that they have been kind and good to the brethren those who are raised and cast into the lake of fire will be treated be so because of their mistreatment of the brethren since this is the word of god we should simply accept what the word of god says for there is no argument here whatsoever as far as god's word is concerned amen hallelujah now think of matthew 25 if you will turn in your bibles or take a note matthew 25 31 to 46 in it it does not say that a shepherd is literally separating sheep from goats but in it as as a shepherd dividing sheep from goats there are no sheep in this particular time there are no sheep anymore in this particular area of time at the whitetron judgment the sheep are already in the shepherd's fold the sheep have already gone in the rapture this sheep have heeded their shepherd's call they have answered the voice of their shepherd and they've come in to hear is welcome come thou good and faithful servants enter into the joys of your lord so the sheep are already in the storehouse and now we come to the white throne judgment these do not have eternal life the first set who heeded the shepherd's call they have already gone into the fall with eternal life this other group is outside of the fold without eternal life they are in the judgment they are allowed to go but some are allowed to go in to eternal life but upon what grounds do these specific number go in to eternal life certainly not upon the fact that they already have his life in them certainly not they don't have it like the bride had it but they will receive it because they were kind to his brethren amen they are not his brethren but they were kind to his brethren oh thank god they are not his heirs of life whatsoever they do not share his throne with him like the bride but their names must have been on the book of life but not removed their names must have been on the book of life but not removed because of their love for the people of god how they recognize the people of god how they recognize they're truly genuinely born again no doubt they served some of those people of god helped and assisted some of those children of god and perhaps like nicodemus and gamaliel they stood for the children of god in the time of darkness and of trouble god rest their blessed souls i can think of of some of my own life that assisted that help that served that were a blessing that were kind of understanding there was some that be that did not ascribe or to the way of my teaching or preaching but they still loved god his word and recognized the sincerity the truthfulness the honesty the something they couldn't explain that was in the individual and somehow god placed it in their hearts to be kind loving to someone's like that my friends the names of many of those were not blotted out the names of many of those were not destroyed thanks be to god we serve a god rich in mercy we cannot tell him who to give mercy to and whom not to give it to but he will show mercy to whom he will show mercy for he is god the almighty god none before him none beside him and none after him the one true living god jehovah of the old testament jesus christ of the new testament the spirit of god made flesh in christ and reveal himself to the entire world emmanuel god with us blessed be his holy name amen so my friends we thank god for these that uh well that they they were many whose names were blotted out but these people their names were not blotted out or removed amen praise god because they recognized god's people as the living manifested word for their day and for their hour the manifestations of the word oh praise god they were witnesses to the glorious liberty of the manifestation of the children of god hallelujah glory to god now we know at this white tron judgment contrary to the teachings of many nations are not judged before here amen nations are not going into any millennium because they help the jews the millennium is already past and the bride is seated in judgment along with jesus meeting out judgment to the entire world this is very clear because the bible tells us and these wicked shall go away into everlasting punishment the lake of fire but the righteous into everlasting life hallelujah there is no record of two white throne judgments or two judgments no such a thing in the bible anywhere there is one judgment amen that will take place amen and in this judgment my friends we find out that they beast the false prophet being judged but my praise god one judgment and all the wicked will be judged in that judgment for this is the white throne judgment and they're judged according to their activities and deeds of what is written in the books amen we'll clarify this a little later for you'll find that the books is in the book amen are a part of the book now notice this is the second resurrection hallelujah souls under the they altar set forth in the fifth seal of revelation chapter 6 verses 9 to 11 and are given white robes and of course eternal life the bible says they're given white robes and eternal life praise god hallelujah now notice carefully none of these under the altar were killed for the testimony of jesus they were not like antipas god's faithful martyr who died for the word and holding fast to his crown and the name of jesus christ these are not born-again ones with eternal life as their inheritance and possessions they come up in the resurrection and they are given or receive eternal life from god because my friends of their works and their faith and their stand upon the word of god they might not have understood all of the word but what they understood of the word they took their stand upon that part of the word and held to god's unchanging hand amen these of course cannot breed a bride for their crying out for vengeance from under the altar amen yes sir but the bride is of the spirit of christ who said father forgive them for they know not what they do so they are not of bright material they are not a bright class or quality amen but they show that spirit of vengeance amen these are jews amen for their fifth seal the bride is already gone in the rapture at that time and these jews are not born of his spirit they don't even believe that jesus is their messiah but as they were blinded by god himself let me repeat as they were blinded by god himself blinded for the gentile sake so that the gentile bride might come in as a grafted branch to bear fruit for his coming glory amen because they were truly faithful to the word that they knew praise god and died for it multitudes of them died for it died for the word of god that they knew he did not allow them to see any more he did not allow them to see the church ages he did not allow them to see the the coming of christ he did not allow them to see jesus coming dying raised up on calvary raised up for our justification that he did not allow them to see and understand the coming of the holy spirit minister the apostles first church age paul right on down to our day even our brother branham wanted to go to israel and to let the gifts of god and the spirit of the voice of god in the in him speak yet the spirit of god says no you are not allowed to go elijah right when he comes again he will be the one that will speak to them amen oh praise god but god bless them for them hell to the word that portion of the word they knew faithfully many died on the hit law tied on the stalin and so on and other places in the world that might not be made large but many millions of them perish and listen to the listen to god's prophet of this 20th century and i want to quote this directly they were truly faithful to all of the word that they knew and they died for it multitudes died that's the holocaust under hitler stalin and will yet die that ending is prophecy that millions will yet die millions of the jews who are holding to that part of the world that they know the rabbis know their wise men no oh they hold to god jehovah's word amen and they'll die for jehovah's word but yet the we are being told millions multitudes of them are yet to die amen now we're talking about the second resurrection not only the righteous dead made up of these foolish virgins made up of the souls under the altar these foolish virgins of course missed the rapture but as the scripture tells us there were virgins to begin with they did not have the holy spirit and missed being in the bride five were wise they had the oil of the holy spirit the light of revelation lamp of god within their lives amen but because these people were a god-loving god-fearing separated clean living people trying to abide into the word of god according to what they knew of it and being a help to god's people and to the work of god that will come up at the end of time and they will miss the millennium but here in this second resurrection some of these will be given eternal life now all these people had their names in the book of life and their names remained in the book of life but whose names were those that did not remain in the book whose names were those that were removed from the book one the world system churches who fought the bride i will be those whose names are removed from the book of life and will be cast into the lake of fire oh what a terrible horrible future for such when we speak against denominationalism when we speak of marrying or aligning yourself with the false prophet false teaching false doctrine of course we know that uh maybe we sound like noah in the art door maybe we sound like alarmness but my friend may god open your eyes that you may heed the warning this may be god's last alter call to your soul amen the devil made sure he sends sent out myriads of men claiming to be ministers of light and said so many things until i i know how it sounds though to some listening but if you're a true genuine child of god there's something that'll strike your soul and you'll recognize that that's the truth that's the word of god give heed to the warning flee to christ while yet there is time to flee that you might come in their first resurrection oh glory to god hallelujah think of it names removed from the cuff life those who are of the world system churches with all manner of doctrines myriads of doctrines under many names of blasphemy against god their names will be blotted out and removed from out of the book of life borderline message believers message christians i should say amen in the message following this prophet's message not catching the fullness of the revelation just going by uh being able to say his words and and and say it all they don't worry about having a revelation of his intent meaning and inferences what inspiration what the holy spirit is trying to say by those words names will be blotted out from the book of life anointed ones at the end time right in this message oh my the same message falling upon them as upon the wheat the rain on the justin and the unjust brought shouting glory to god thanking god for this message this prophet this ministry in this hour but one with the spirit of christ and the other with the spirit of judas amen anointed with a genuine gift to preach anointed with a genuine gift to cast out devils heal the sick o my glory god and yet false and against the true word of the living god yet others within the boundaries of this message anointed with the spirit of balaam their names will be removed from the book of life in other words the anointed a demonic devil spirit of lust for money and agreed for gold agreed for wealth agreed my friends to be millions and millions and millions nothing is wrong with in itself because god promises to bless his people in wonderful ways but my friends they they greed and to organize one's self oh i tell you my friends they have this money lost amen and that spirit they can't help it their names will be removed from the book of life in the message but not of the message surely my friends we must know shortly the purpose of god stands in election hallelujah praise god you see my s within myself i i i want to go on i want to preach teach this message uh that's i'm speaking on right now but i feel a halting of the holy spirit to wind down at this point and i'll pick this up again and speak on this as god would lead come next wednesday with great anticipation let's touch again teach a little more on the book of life and remember i am not here to teach figments of the imagination oh but i'm calling pulling extracting all of the this from the storehouse of god's anointed revealed spoken word may god bless your hearts may god bless my heart may god inspire anoint and unveil the word of god before us that we may raise holy hands and hearts to heaven and say heavenly father i appreciate you i love you i adore you i bow down before you o great king o everlasting god we bless your name blessed be the father of lights may his spirit go forth and may carry the word to the very ends of the earth wherever his voice is heard take glory and honor father in jesus name my brothers and sisters friends in christ god bless you wherever you are and let's meet again next wednesday
