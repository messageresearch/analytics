[37:00] Jesus God bless every one of you uh I
[37:04] have a scripture here out of Exodus chap
[37:08] 32 verse
[37:19] 26 you know every speaker has their own
[37:24] way or or every uh Son of God called by
[37:29] the Holy Spirit God shapes them uh a
[37:33] certain way and they can't help that
[37:37] they have to be who and what they are
[37:41] and to bring the word of God to you so
[37:45] uh that's why Paul said let us not
[37:47] compare ourselves among ourselves
[37:49] because there's only one of you God has
[37:52] never made two things the same that is
[37:55] why he's the Great I Am
[37:58] no matter if you have twins they're not
[38:00] the same God knows the difference and so
[38:04] each one of us here is unique in in our
[38:08] own way praise the lord we all built
[38:11] that you understand we are the stars
[38:13] that were up there so you're a star
[38:17] that's what I'm telling you uh literally
[38:20] we're not talking about Hollywood we're
[38:23] talking about the Holy Woods of God we
[38:27] come from from the presence of almighty
[38:29] God and we are thankful for this great
[38:32] opportunity that we can be here on this
[38:35] Earth for this brief period of time to
[38:39] serve him down here while we are here
[38:42] praise the Lord uh if I can put H half
[38:47] of how I served him up there while I'm
[38:50] down here oh my goodness I'll be more
[38:54] than happy but praise the Lord let us
[38:57] just come together as one United and
[39:01] praising the Lord God bless you Exodus
[39:05] chapter 32 uh verse 26 let's read that
[39:10] together one
[39:12] voice then Moses stood in the gate of
[39:17] the camp and said who is on the Lord's
[39:21] Side let him come unto me and the sons
[39:26] of Levi
[39:28] gathered themselves together unto him
[39:31] praise the Lord father we thank you for
[39:34] the reading of the word and we pray that
[39:37] the great Holy Spirit whom seems to be a
[39:41] stranger to many uh not uh just hearing
[39:46] about him just worshiping him in a
[39:50] tradition but not recognizing the
[39:55] personal reality
[39:57] of your presence that you are really
[40:01] here and that you are really among us
[40:05] and that you really walk up and down
[40:09] among us when we come together oh God
[40:14] bring this reality right to us that we
[40:17] might recognize your living personal
[40:21] presence father not just another worship
[40:25] uh come together to sing sing on to read
[40:29] the scriptures but to experience and to
[40:32] be in the presence of the Living God we
[40:36] ask your blessing upon the word the
[40:38] stirring of the waters the quickening of
[40:41] the word let this word become wine to
[40:45] our souls and may the great Holy Spirit
[40:49] take all the praise the honor and the
[40:51] glory in Jesus name amen and amen amen
[40:56] please be seated
[41:00] did it doesn't matter which preacher it
[41:04] is how marvelous and how wonderful this
[41:07] ministry is in every congregation every
[41:13] congregation uh there was always these
[41:16] Kora and dayon
[41:19] spirits that always gain say the prophet
[41:23] as they gain say Moses in the wilderness
[41:26] how many knows the scripture amen well
[41:30] um I'm not going to preach on that but
[41:32] you have those same Spirits usually in
[41:34] every church and they G saing the
[41:38] pastor the question uh uh what the
[41:42] pastor is saying how he's saying it his
[41:45] style of saying it whether uh uh he's
[41:49] this or he's that way or the other way
[41:51] but God is warning all the church that
[41:56] regardless of way back then brother
[41:59] Brandon even said it don't say
[42:04] anything just don't say nothing you even
[42:08] have your own thoughts talk to God but
[42:11] don't say anything keep your heart and
[42:14] your mind upon the Lord praise the
[42:17] Lord uh I woke up early um uh a few
[42:22] mornings ago and I saw a certain uh
[42:27] Preacher Brother in um Toronto area I
[42:34] already spoke to him and saw this kind
[42:38] of thing going on in his
[42:42] congregation um of course I just spoke
[42:46] to him in general terms and let him know
[42:49] he needs to be vigilant watchful
[42:52] prayerful and let the great Holy Spirit
[42:56] um have his way within that
[43:00] congregation so we believe that the God
[43:03] we serve is still alive and
[43:06] living and that he keeps his word uh we
[43:09] all built differently but it's all for
[43:12] the glory of God and so a lot of these
[43:16] personalities because God takes the man
[43:19] but not the
[43:21] spirit so cor and dayon are gone but the
[43:24] spirit that was upon them it is still
[43:28] around and it will settle on anybody
[43:32] that uh creates the environment for for
[43:35] for them to settle on a bird will make a
[43:39] nest on your head if you make the
[43:41] environment right uh you see and that's
[43:44] what I'm trying to say in a nice way a
[43:46] thought will come in your mind if you
[43:50] create the uh mental environment for it
[43:54] and uh it'll just settle right there
[43:57] okay so we find out that there was a
[44:01] separation time in the
[44:04] wilderness and today what I'm talking
[44:08] about that that separation time has gone
[44:11] through several
[44:13] cycles and now that separation time is
[44:18] here it really is here and I'm not
[44:22] talking about you separating yourself
[44:26] from somebody else or from some
[44:29] Christian or some believer but there is
[44:32] a natural a supernatural separation
[44:36] taking place by the Holy Ghost brother
[44:40] brandham often Illustrated it by talking
[44:43] about the uh the the shock uh and talk
[44:47] about when the heat of the Sun comes
[44:49] upon it the shock naturally just curls
[44:53] away from the seed it not that it uh the
[44:56] seed
[44:57] wants to separate itself from the shock
[45:00] but the heat the the shock just can't
[45:03] take it anymore and it naturally just
[45:06] curls away uh from that seed right
[45:10] praise the Lord now so there was a
[45:14] separation in the wilderness and that is
[45:16] why Moses is saying there's now the time
[45:20] has come when we must make a a sober and
[45:25] serious decision amen of which side we
[45:30] are
[45:31] on who is on the Lord's Side who is on
[45:34] the side of the revealed word stand on
[45:38] that side Take A Stand upon on that
[45:42] revealed word hallelujah and who is just
[45:46] uh following the message uh take a stand
[45:50] for that if you want to do that but who
[45:53] is on the Lord's Side amen come nigh
[45:57] unto me not Moses it's the spirit of
[46:01] Christ in him was
[46:04] calling come nigh unto me as the spirit
[46:07] is crying out and calling for his sons
[46:11] and others to come close to him well
[46:14] some accepted the word that came through
[46:18] the prophet and understood by Revelation
[46:23] that that was God hiding in
[46:28] Moses and when he went to pharaoh and he
[46:31] asked who sent you Moses answered and
[46:34] said I am that I
[46:38] am of course he thought he was just
[46:41] telling him well I was told to tell you
[46:44] I am that I am but but he didn't realize
[46:47] it was God speaking through him and
[46:50] telling pharoh I am that I am amen I'm
[46:53] in him here now when I'm talking to you
[46:56] amen and if you don't listen this going
[46:58] to happen Frog's going to happen that's
[47:00] going to happen fli is going to happen
[47:02] uh uh snow is going to come this is
[47:05] going to happen like we are here today
[47:07] if God were to bring any of those things
[47:09] who's going to stop
[47:11] him you think you can take a gun and
[47:14] fire at the snow and say go back to the
[47:17] north no no sounds funny but God is
[47:21] saying like what he said to Job he said
[47:24] if I send the the the snow and the hor
[47:27] FR us who is going to tell it anything
[47:29] who's going to stop it he can just pile
[47:32] it up wherever you want and shut down
[47:34] everything if he wants to just like that
[47:36] don't even have to raise his finger what
[47:38] a mighty God we serve of course when we
[47:42] talk like this it sounds like you are
[47:44] talking vain
[47:47] imaginations to these people it sounds
[47:49] like you caught up in some religious
[47:53] fiction you know they caught up in a
[47:55] religious spirit and so they they're
[47:58] saying all these things but to those of
[48:01] us whom the reality of this word has
[48:04] struck our hearts you can't take this
[48:07] away from
[48:09] us and and I mean reality reality as
[48:13] much as you can be sitting in a room and
[48:16] literally feel the next person walk into
[48:18] the room you can be praying by your bed
[48:22] and you can actually know when that
[48:25] other person come and sits on one end of
[48:28] it listening to you the reality of God
[48:32] unfailing realities of the Living God
[48:36] Amen so you'll find out friends that we
[48:40] have got to take sides with this
[48:42] revealed word of the hour right and we
[48:47] found out that many people have walked
[48:49] with us as we sing the song there were
[48:52] many who started out in this race but
[48:55] but with this word going forward and
[48:57] moving on they failed to keep
[49:01] Pace when the rhythm of the word changed
[49:04] they didn't change with the Rhythm and
[49:06] they just want to keep playing the same
[49:08] music that was being played before but
[49:11] it's not the same amen even though we
[49:15] hear the same quotes we read the same
[49:17] scriptures we we sing the same songs but
[49:21] there is a an understanding and a
[49:24] revelation that only the Spirit of
[49:27] almighty God can give to you amen no
[49:32] preacher no teacher no matter how look
[49:37] my God I tell you I had an office there
[49:41] filled with loaded with books everywhere
[49:46] you talk about that you know the
[49:48] librarian in the in the um denomination
[49:52] at the time and you talk about the Greek
[49:56] and the Hebrew and the let me tell you
[49:58] those things are wonderful but when you
[50:01] come to understand God isn't asking for
[50:05] that we only need that for Earthly
[50:09] survival you've got to go and get
[50:11] schooling education as bright as you can
[50:14] to survive while you're on this Earth
[50:18] but for God to use you he doesn't eat
[50:22] any of
[50:24] that thank you Jesus all he needs for
[50:27] you to do is to surrender to
[50:31] him hallelujah hallelujah so that he can
[50:35] live in
[50:37] you and anything you want to know he'll
[50:41] let you
[50:43] know in other words instead it's not God
[50:46] coming to use your brains it's not God
[50:49] coming to use your mind he's invited us
[50:54] to come and use the vast uh uh
[50:57] intelligence of his mind the mind of
[51:00] Christ so you are Unlimited in your
[51:05] spiritual understanding not because you
[51:08] studied that's natural and that's good
[51:11] but that's not we're talking about
[51:13] that's good but I'm talking about
[51:16] spontaneity of the Holy Spirit flowing
[51:19] through the individual and God
[51:21] glorifying himself by him speaking his
[51:25] own word through the individual or
[51:28] individuals for his glory that's some of
[51:32] what we're talking about I can't even
[51:33] fully explain it but I just want you to
[51:37] understand that's why Paul said don't
[51:38] you understand that preaching is really
[51:41] a mystery it's not just uh getting up
[51:44] and uh putting together a nice uh um uh
[51:49] word of God whether
[51:51] extemporaneous whether it's uh one
[51:54] that's topical uh doing uh religious and
[51:59] exegesis and all this type of stuff it's
[52:02] good it's good and what those men
[52:05] whether they're in the denomination or
[52:07] outside what they're doing is good but
[52:10] that's not what he's asking for he's
[52:13] asking for us to surrender ourselves
[52:16] that he could live in us and through us
[52:20] that the Holy Spirit can glorify his own
[52:24] self amen
[52:28] Hallelujah flow through me Holy Spirit
[52:32] flow through me oh my that is what we
[52:36] need get out of the way and let him flow
[52:40] through you amen praise the name of the
[52:42] Lord godj hallelujah amen yes now a lot
[52:48] of people walk with us through the
[52:51] years but where are they now you see
[52:55] each one finds their position when water
[52:59] comes it drops to its lowest position or
[53:03] wherever it has to go it just trickles
[53:05] and goes there and so many come in to
[53:09] the message and then all of a
[53:13] sudden the many are not there wonderful
[53:16] people that you think were so strong and
[53:18] so firm and in natural things maybe they
[53:22] are but spiritually because of not
[53:25] really fully seeing the glory and
[53:29] magnificence of and Splendor of the
[53:32] scripture uh they just walk away
[53:34] thinking it's a normal natural thing
[53:37] they can just uh move from a church and
[53:39] move to a next church and uh every
[53:43] church is not the
[53:45] same and uh uh when you use the word
[53:49] church one by tradition and another one
[53:51] by Revelation amen you see praise the
[53:55] Lord
[53:56] I don't know what I'm saying fully here
[53:59] all of what I'm saying but if I say one
[54:01] thing that can lift you one step higher
[54:05] I leave here happy glory to God thank
[54:08] you Lord now they turn
[54:11] back and they died and are dying in this
[54:16] world's Wilderness y it's a Wilderness
[54:20] here today you know we living in a
[54:23] desert without bread and water
[54:27] you know Amos said the hour will come
[54:30] that the world will become so uh
[54:33] desperate like a desert spiritually no
[54:37] bread no water nothing amen you go out
[54:41] there searching for the fullness of the
[54:44] truth and you can't find it
[54:47] anywhere Amen brother brandham said a
[54:52] world built upon deceit and lies
[54:57] everywhere from the sales clerk to the
[54:59] boss to the this to the that it's just a
[55:03] lies pouring out everywhere you
[55:06] understand we are in the middle of a
[55:08] stream of s satanic and demonic
[55:12] activity this it's getting so thick and
[55:16] dark as it was in Egypt but this is a
[55:20] spiritual
[55:21] Darkness until people are
[55:24] comfortable living walk and existing in
[55:27] that manner and the devil is
[55:31] normalizing his lies his murder his
[55:35] hatred his stealing everything he's
[55:38] normalizing it and the people are dying
[55:41] in the willness
[55:44] again you know what
[55:47] testings and the trials of this life are
[55:51] killing a lot of people's
[55:53] faith and they don't realize it
[55:56] the Lord test them test them test them
[55:59] burning them through the fire and
[56:00] everything else he already told you
[56:03] there is no testing I can give you that
[56:05] can really overcome you not testing that
[56:08] I will give you he says that I'm going
[56:11] to give it to you that's going to really
[56:13] kill you or take no see you of yourself
[56:17] you got to give him you got to
[56:20] surrender right you got to give up and
[56:24] then that will happen but the people the
[56:27] the trials and testings are killing them
[56:30] so many are dying through their testings
[56:33] but they you see the the elect bride she
[56:37] lives ripens and matures by those same
[56:44] testings The Heat Of The Sun dries up
[56:47] the spiritual life of one and it ripens
[56:51] and puts sweetness into the other one as
[56:56] they continue walking with the
[56:59] word and living in the s o n light
[57:02] shining upon them it baks the greenness
[57:06] and the sourness and the and the hatred
[57:09] and the unforgiving spirits and lying
[57:13] Spirits cheating and everything else it
[57:15] takes it out of them
[57:17] amen the Holy Spirit working by the word
[57:21] begins to take it out listen to brother
[57:24] brandom here in the unveiling of God now
[57:28] what's the shik kind of Glory
[57:31] today to break Beyond the Veil to see
[57:35] who God Is Standing before you now
[57:40] remember the Sho bread
[57:44] seed amen the word that we are living on
[57:49] in this day by these promises the sh
[57:54] kind of Glory right s up that true
[57:58] bread and brings it to pass makes it
[58:02] bread to the
[58:04] believer and that laid in the pages of
[58:08] that this Bible year after year after
[58:13] year the word for this age amen it's
[58:18] been laying in the Bible years year
[58:22] after years and men and women reading it
[58:25] but not seeing these things but the time
[58:28] has come when the word of God is being
[58:33] fulfilled now so while they were all in
[58:36] the desert Joshua Caleb and all the
[58:39] others were in the desert they were all
[58:42] suffering for lack of water is that
[58:45] right there's one time all of us were
[58:47] suffering for lack of the
[58:49] word we out in the denominations you
[58:52] know I'm reminiscing with the with a
[58:54] couple of Brothers how we were all out
[58:56] there in the denomination hungry for
[58:59] something you know something isn't right
[59:01] you you you but you don't know what and
[59:04] you don't know where to go or what to
[59:06] believe but that there was that thirst
[59:09] within your heart so there were
[59:11] suffering without water uh uh and here
[59:15] uh Joshua and Caleb were tested and
[59:18] suffering without food uh they felt the
[59:21] same heat they felt the same burning
[59:26] and uh they were burning up because of
[59:29] the sun amen just like anybody else if
[59:33] we're all outside we all going to feel
[59:35] the heat of the sun same as them
[59:38] unbelievers praise God I'm going to stop
[59:41] a moment you know the word
[59:43] unbelief unbelief is not
[59:47] disbelief right the person
[59:50] believes but uh to convey what I am is
[59:54] in my thoughts here on untie what do you
[59:57] mean something that was tied up you
[59:59] loose unravel something that was you
[1:00:02] know all together all of a sudden it
[1:00:05] starts falling apart now the Bible says
[1:00:09] unbelief the faith of that person begins
[1:00:12] to unravel it it starts falling apart
[1:00:16] because of what the heat of the way the
[1:00:19] along the way the testings the trials
[1:00:22] that come why would God put this but he
[1:00:26] knows
[1:00:27] why no wonder job says my God I never
[1:00:31] heard of anybody else been through
[1:00:33] trials like
[1:00:34] me I I can almost seeing job says but I
[1:00:39] don't care I though he kill me though he
[1:00:42] slay me I am going to serve him I'm
[1:00:46] going to worship Him brother Bram said
[1:00:49] even if he sent me to hell I'll still
[1:00:51] love him praise God but Abraham said
[1:00:56] shall not the judge of the Earth Do
[1:00:58] Right amen so if he send me to Hell he's
[1:01:02] still doing
[1:01:03] right whatever he does is
[1:01:06] right I I just lay my life in his hands
[1:01:09] and whatever he wants to do with me is
[1:01:13] Right amen so brother sister I don't
[1:01:17] know the toils of this road when you
[1:01:20] come to understand it will seem as
[1:01:22] nothing when we come to the end of the
[1:01:24] way
[1:01:27] amen Joshua and Caleb live under the
[1:01:30] same
[1:01:31] circumstances same conditions like the
[1:01:34] unbelievers but the scriptures say the
[1:01:37] difference was they had a different
[1:01:39] Spirit the scriptures said they had a
[1:01:42] different Spirit they had a different
[1:01:44] attitude upon them and I thank God that
[1:01:48] uh I didn't cultivate a different Spirit
[1:01:50] you didn't cultivate one you didn't go
[1:01:53] to Dale Carnegie courses or something
[1:01:56] like that to develop a a a a dynamic
[1:01:59] personality or read some psychologist or
[1:02:03] listen to some preachers as lot of
[1:02:06] message preachers are doing today
[1:02:07] preaching psychology instead of
[1:02:09] preaching the word of God uh how to be
[1:02:11] happy and how you can be this and how to
[1:02:13] be that and whatever else rather than
[1:02:16] sticking and staying with the word for
[1:02:18] the hour uh that type of thing but
[1:02:20] Brothers here it is even though they
[1:02:23] were undergoing the same trials they did
[1:02:26] not murmur even
[1:02:29] once they did not murmur against God or
[1:02:33] against the word against the prophet not
[1:02:36] even one time amen hallelujah I'm
[1:02:41] telling you brother sister we come into
[1:02:44] this world and there is something God
[1:02:47] deposited in
[1:02:49] us we call that the gene yes the
[1:02:53] seed in us God deposited it not because
[1:02:58] we have a better personality a better
[1:03:01] this than anyone else but against our
[1:03:04] own self God put something in there amen
[1:03:10] he put a captain that can control the
[1:03:13] ship for his glory for his honor and for
[1:03:17] his praise amen and that genuine
[1:03:22] certified seed of God in you gave you a
[1:03:27] different
[1:03:28] Spirit go back to when you were just
[1:03:31] young maybe just a child and somewhere
[1:03:35] in your heart you know that you were
[1:03:38] different doesn't matter I can remember
[1:03:42] I would stand there and I it could be a
[1:03:45] thousand people around me and yet I
[1:03:47] would suddenly feel alone yes I'm
[1:03:50] different but I didn't know why why I
[1:03:54] was like that how can I be in a whole
[1:03:56] crowd people all around me everybody's
[1:03:59] rejoicing happy with what they're doing
[1:04:02] and I'm there in the midst and I feel
[1:04:06] alone thank you Jes different God made
[1:04:10] us different for a purpose and for his
[1:04:14] glory amen hallelujah so because of that
[1:04:19] seed in you it makes you different and
[1:04:21] it gives you a different understanding
[1:04:23] to the same word that they
[1:04:26] brething you get a different
[1:04:29] understanding to that word that God gave
[1:04:32] to us
[1:04:34] hallelujah praise God praise the Lord
[1:04:38] but you know when all of these trials
[1:04:40] and testings are over God will lead us
[1:04:43] over to the promised
[1:04:45] land and all the other ones they borns
[1:04:50] are going to be found in the
[1:04:52] wilderness quotation again praise praise
[1:04:55] the
[1:04:57] Lord the pilgrim
[1:05:00] fathers oh so can we be
[1:05:04] thankful oh my I thought we were having
[1:05:06] that up there as pilgrims like Abraham
[1:05:12] separated uh himself from the things of
[1:05:15] the world all of our Associates Abraham
[1:05:19] was a pilgrim God has separated us from
[1:05:25] all the dead religions amen separated us
[1:05:30] and opened to us a new
[1:05:34] land a new
[1:05:37] message for this day am I saying that
[1:05:41] he's telling you that though we have the
[1:05:44] message he's saying but God has opened
[1:05:47] up a new land yes a new message for this
[1:05:52] day am I making up something no it's
[1:05:55] it's right there in front of you it's
[1:05:57] just that we don't want to accept what
[1:05:59] what's been given to us because it
[1:06:01] sounds too good to be true or
[1:06:03] unbelievable but it's the truth you see
[1:06:07] Pentecost came and it dried up how many
[1:06:09] knows
[1:06:10] that Pentecost has dried up back there
[1:06:14] and all of the rest of them good but
[1:06:17] there are good people in there you know
[1:06:18] that the scriptures telling you that and
[1:06:21] they have to come out so we have a
[1:06:23] Ministry and our ministry to do what you
[1:06:26] talking to your church friends you're
[1:06:29] talking to your religious friends share
[1:06:32] with them this message that a prophet
[1:06:35] has come amen it sounds simple but you
[1:06:41] have you heard that a prophet has come
[1:06:43] did you know about William brandham yes
[1:06:46] I heard about William brandham how they
[1:06:47] say he's this he's that and that you see
[1:06:50] but the way is opened already you can
[1:06:52] start talking about the prophet you may
[1:06:54] have to be the reproach for the word of
[1:06:55] God but you still have to share the word
[1:06:58] be share the word that's what you need
[1:07:01] to do praise God this is not the to day
[1:07:04] do you walk up to some do you know
[1:07:07] Jesus have you been born again it sounds
[1:07:11] good but that's the Pentecostal approach
[1:07:14] what we have to talk about is that God
[1:07:17] has sent a prophet in this 20th century
[1:07:21] amen and the name of that Prophet
[1:07:24] happens to be William man Mar and
[1:07:27] Brandon amen and he's proven by God by
[1:07:32] multitudes of signs wonders and
[1:07:36] miracles and then he progressed to where
[1:07:40] God Vindicated his word through
[1:07:44] him amen now Pentecost dried up
[1:07:49] see what did he do he opened up the
[1:07:53] Seven Seals of the last message amen he
[1:07:59] opened up the Seven Seals for us to the
[1:08:02] glory of God hallelujah amen let me tell
[1:08:06] you all of our trials and testings down
[1:08:08] here will soon be over and all those

[1:08:18] to their Homeland bright and
[1:08:21] fear I I I want to uh go back to some of
[1:08:25] by the message I preached a few weeks
[1:08:27] ago and talk about the eagle again can I

[1:22:57] to change but we understand now is that
[1:23:00] you're going to change from a flesh body
[1:23:02] to a theophany body that's going to
[1:23:05] become and so we as Christians we don't
[1:23:07] die we just move from one body to
[1:23:10] another body right praise the name of
[1:23:12] the Lord we move into another body and
[1:23:14] we thank the Lord praise God hallelujah

[1:23:50] nothing to do with
[1:23:51] it a young man can walk in into the
[1:23:55] message tonight and the Holy Spirit can
[1:23:58] reveal himself like he did to Paul by
[1:24:01] the next day midday and he can walk away
[1:24:04] and be the most powerful apostle that
[1:24:06] God wants to use it has nothing to do
[1:24:09] with how many years you've been
[1:24:11] following this how many courts you know
[1:24:14] is how much God favors You by revealing
[1:24:18] his word to

[1:26:28] this and that stay on the word of God
[1:26:31] hallelujah amen yes sir praise God so
[1:26:36] now you remember that the apostles
[1:26:39] followed Jesus like a lot of people have
[1:26:41] followed this message how many knows
[1:26:44] that praise the
[1:26:46] Lord but amongst those that was
[1:26:49] following the message or following Jesus
[1:26:52] who was the message of that day
[1:26:55] there was one named
[1:26:57] Judas Bible says and Judas was amongst
[1:27:02] them and uh they came out of Egypt with
[1:27:06] Mo Moses and Kora and Dayan was amongst
[1:27:10] them we're talking about spirits now
[1:27:13] we're not here talking about people but
[1:27:16] those spirits come upon
[1:27:18] people and use them and they think
[1:27:21] because they're thinking their own
[1:27:23] private sec secret thoughts nobody knows
[1:27:26] God doesn't know God knows everything he
[1:27:29] knows you you can't he says um brother
[1:27:32] Bram said look an insect can't even move
[1:27:35] the antenna and he doesn't know about he
[1:27:37] knows about he does you can't even move
[1:27:40] it you know I was like I said brother
[1:27:43] Ernest fander was telling me he says you
[1:27:45] don't understand how sensitive the
[1:27:47] spirit on that man was that he was
[1:27:50] telling me how great God used him with
[1:27:54] the miracle and healing over here and
[1:27:56] raising up the dead here and I just
[1:28:00] thought uh you're just boasting you're
[1:28:03] talking about
[1:28:04] yourself he said that man immediately
[1:28:07] turned and said what did you say
[1:28:10] Arie my
[1:28:12] God and he said oh no I didn't say
[1:28:14] because he really didn't say anything he
[1:28:17] didn't say anything so he said oh no I
[1:28:19] didn't say anything he says come on
[1:28:22] Ernie you know better than that you know
[1:28:25] better than
[1:28:26] that telling me you didn't see anything
[1:28:28] he said well you know I just thought
[1:28:31] that you were boasting about yourself he
[1:28:34] says you're right but not the way you're
[1:28:37] thinking I was talking about those
[1:28:40] things because he used me to do those
[1:28:43] things but I was really boasting in him
[1:28:47] like David said in God I boast all the
[1:28:50] day long right but I'm boasting in him
[1:28:54] because those things were done through
[1:28:56] me as an instrument right but it's given
[1:28:58] him glory and honor and praise
[1:29:01] Hallelujah but so sensitive that just
[1:29:04] one little thought picked it up right
[1:29:06] away see God is like that you can't even
[1:29:10] think you know any un we think sometimes
[1:29:15] you can be in prayer I can talk myself
[1:29:18] being in prayer and and your thoughts
[1:29:20] just go off a little bit like that and
[1:29:23] right away you have to pull yourself
[1:29:25] back and say oh my goodness Lord Jesus
[1:29:28] help us amen and allow because that's a
[1:29:32] human being is built that way and Satan
[1:29:34] is constantly bombarding your thoughts
[1:29:37] your mind the greatest battle ever
[1:29:40] thought is to keep yourself focused and
[1:29:43] let the word of God take control of your
[1:29:45] life amen praise the Lord can I go on a
[1:29:48] little bit
[1:29:50] more amen praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:29:54] praise God so three and a half years
[1:29:57] they were following Jesus you know that
[1:29:59] Jesus lived for three and a half years
[1:30:02] praise the Lord and the other three and
[1:30:04] a half Daniel 7th weeks you know that
[1:30:08] and how he's going to come down in
[1:30:09] Israel there but anyway praise the Lord
[1:30:13] they followed they were actually
[1:30:15] following Jesus the
[1:30:18] word he was the Living Word and they
[1:30:21] were following that amen you just was
[1:30:24] following that so following the message
[1:30:27] what are you talking about I followed
[1:30:29] the message I've been in it for three
[1:30:32] years Judas was too so so what it's not
[1:30:35] just following the message it's coming
[1:30:38] to a place where the Holy Spirit begins
[1:30:41] to give you a revelation of the
[1:30:45] message an understanding between you and
[1:30:49] him amen like an understanding comes
[1:30:51] between husband and wife amen
[1:30:55] unspoken understanding but it's there
[1:30:58] and they can talk without talking
[1:31:01] because they have that spiritual
[1:31:04] understanding they're United the spirits
[1:31:07] are one spirit with spirit will meet the
[1:31:10] Holy Spirit deep calls to the deep and
[1:31:13] they will meet and they will be able to
[1:31:16] fellowship and Converse praise God and
[1:31:19] sometimes uh the
[1:31:21] conversations uh the human part of you
[1:31:23] can even put it in
[1:31:25] words cuz there's not words to put it in
[1:31:28] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:31:31] remember that they all heard the message
[1:31:33] from Jesus we all heard the message from
[1:31:35] the prophet in this day we all heard the
[1:31:37] message it right directly but they were
[1:31:40] hearing this message not from just
[1:31:43] brother William brandham but from Jesus
[1:31:46] himself who was the god Prophet amen you
[1:31:50] know I said God Prophet because all the
[1:31:53] others were
[1:31:54] prophets of God who had sent them right
[1:31:58] but now Jesus was God
[1:32:02] himself come down in this body named
[1:32:06] Jesus to be his own
[1:32:09] prophet and to speak through him God
[1:32:13] speaking to the world through him and
[1:32:16] that's why the Pharisees come to such
[1:32:18] trouble because they didn't recognize
[1:32:20] who that really was they recognized the
[1:32:23] body that it come from Nazareth that it
[1:32:25] come from Mary that it come from Joseph
[1:32:28] over there over here and they were just
[1:32:30] talking about that but they weren't
[1:32:31] looking at the other part that can break
[1:32:33] bread and all of a sudden showing that I
[1:32:35] am still the
[1:32:37] Creator break the bread like that all of
[1:32:39] a sudden it becomes all thousands of
[1:32:42] Loaves and thousands of fishes I'm just
[1:32:45] in a body but I am still the
[1:32:47] Creator he's trying to show them who he
[1:32:50] was he goes to Lazarus grave who can
[1:32:53] call call back the dead gone for three 4
[1:32:57] days into the great beyond and say
[1:33:00] Lazarus come
[1:33:01] forth that voice went right out to the
[1:33:05] great beyond and bring him right back to
[1:33:08] where who can do that he showing them I
[1:33:11] am powerful I am capable I have the
[1:33:14] authority I'm the great Creator I I I'm
[1:33:18] just limit myself into this body so that
[1:33:21] I can just display some of myself to you
[1:33:24] not all but some of myself and you can
[1:33:27] be able to see what nature what
[1:33:30] personality what kind of being that I am
[1:33:33] invisible or your eyes can't see me yet
[1:33:36] you will be able to recognize amen by
[1:33:39] seeing all of this glory to God
[1:33:41] hallelujah hallelujah amen yes sir
[1:33:46] praise God they heard the
[1:33:49] word but you know even though they heard
[1:33:51] the word you know what Jesus said
[1:33:54] before he left he says you need to go up
[1:33:58] to
[1:33:59] Jerusalem and receive the Holy Ghost but
[1:34:03] you shall receive power amen after not
[1:34:08] before even though you got all that word
[1:34:11] all that message all those quates you
[1:34:15] can put them all together you can preach
[1:34:18] like Peter and Judas and all of them did
[1:34:21] with that and have even powerful min
[1:34:23] ministries of preaching the word and and
[1:34:26] casting out devils and even Healing The
[1:34:28] Sick and yet he said but you will
[1:34:32] receive
[1:34:33] power after that the Holy Ghost is come
[1:34:37] upon you amen then you'll be
[1:34:41] Witnesses unto me praise the name of the
[1:34:44] Lord hallelujah praise God the Holy
[1:34:46] Spirit breaks all of this to you himself
[1:34:49] praise the Lord yes sir and so we find
[1:34:53] out
[1:34:55] that Judas was hearing Jesus himself and
[1:34:59] yet he was
[1:35:00] deceived right you heard this message
[1:35:03] and a lot of people still deceived uh
[1:35:06] what they were uh in what they doing
[1:35:08] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[1:35:11] and you know with Judas that how you
[1:35:14] know he had a Ministry the Bible says he
[1:35:16] had a Ministry I think it's in Acts
[1:35:18] chapter 1 where Peter was speaking Peter
[1:35:21] was saying and you know he had a part of
[1:35:24] this
[1:35:25] ministry right he was preaching the word
[1:35:29] when the disciples came back said Lord
[1:35:31] even the devils are subject to us in thy
[1:35:34] name he was casting out Devils yes he
[1:35:37] was he was going up around telling that
[1:35:40] Jesus was the Messiah he was preaching
[1:35:44] the literal message amen but Le said yes
[1:35:48] that's wonderful you're doing it at that
[1:35:51] level because the message tells you to
[1:35:53] do do it because I said to do it you you
[1:35:56] just went out and you start doing it and
[1:35:58] of course you're going to get the
[1:35:59] confirmation of it that what I'm saying
[1:36:01] is the truth but you shall receive power
[1:36:04] only after the Holy Ghost has come upon
[1:36:07] you so you can be
[1:36:09] Witnesses of
[1:36:11] me
[1:36:13] Hallelujah so today we have a lot of
[1:36:16] people who walk with him the same way
[1:36:20] the message right uh through the they
[1:36:23] walk through the first pull they walk
[1:36:26] through the second pull and under the
[1:36:29] third
[1:36:30] pull the word went into another
[1:36:34] dimension the word went into another
[1:36:36] dimension is that right praise the name
[1:36:39] of the Lord hallelujah so so we see the
[1:36:44] the the music score just suddenly change
[1:36:48] and and they realize it change and they
[1:36:50] keep walking and yes they're walking
[1:36:52] they're walking with him and a lot of
[1:36:55] people are going to be saved that are
[1:36:58] not in the bride you know that you
[1:37:00] realize the book of life has different
[1:37:03] uh parts to it those who are the har for
[1:37:06] the 4,000 going to be like guards and
[1:37:09] those who are going to be servants and
[1:37:10] those who are going to be this and be be
[1:37:12] that but the bride elected lady elected
[1:37:16] for
[1:37:18] himself that's going to be with him in
[1:37:20] the throne and there are going to be
[1:37:22] other believer but they'll have to take
[1:37:25] a lower place somewhere else they the
[1:37:28] same piece of cloth but it's just wasn't
[1:37:31] allowed to be within the
[1:37:33] pattern but God by his grace put you in
[1:37:37] the
[1:37:38] pattern that you can be a part of him
[1:37:41] praise God forever more hallelujah amen
[1:37:45] the word goes into another dimension and
[1:37:48] this is a dimension of
[1:37:50] Revelation just like it was in the old
[1:37:53] Old Testament when he died on Calvary
[1:37:56] crucified the word of God there what
[1:37:58] happened the veil of the temple rent the
[1:38:01] veil of the temple rent the Bible says
[1:38:03] an angel came and rent it came with a
[1:38:06] sword and rent it praise God but look
[1:38:09] look it's it's all in the scriptures
[1:38:12] it's your eyes got to see it's the Holy
[1:38:14] Spirit got to make it known don't you
[1:38:16] understand the prophet himself go and
[1:38:18] preach that uh Resurrection the the
[1:38:22] crucifixion of Jesus Christ Christ was
[1:38:24] the second
[1:38:25] crucifixion of Jesus Christ well isn't
[1:38:28] the temple veil going to be rent again
[1:38:31] don't you understand the word is ripped
[1:38:34] again and only the elect allowed to go
[1:38:37] in and see what's in there for the glory
[1:38:41] of God hallelujah amen and God unveiling
[1:38:45] himself and revealing himself by the
[1:38:48] word hallelujah amen yes sir the
[1:38:53] disciple had the word but Jesus told
[1:38:55] them plain you got to have acts 1 18
[1:38:59] right praise the Lord how be it when he
[1:39:02] the spirit of Truth is come you have the
[1:39:06] truth you got the message but when he
[1:39:09] the spirit of Truth has
[1:39:12] come he will guide you into all
[1:39:15] Truth for he shall not speak of himself
[1:39:20] but whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[1:39:23] he speak and he will show you things to
[1:39:28] come praise God hallelujah hallelujah
[1:39:32] praise God they were told by the Lord
[1:39:35] Jesus in simple words that when the Holy
[1:39:39] Spirit comes that he will give you
[1:39:43] Revelation power to preach and teach the
[1:39:47] word the power of Revelation you'll be
[1:39:50] teaching the word but for with the power
[1:39:52] of
[1:39:53] Revelation to teach the word to heal the
[1:39:56] sick and even perform Miracles you
[1:39:59] believe that God still perform
[1:40:01] Miracles you don't go out for a Healing

[1:43:41] only passing through them he's just
[1:43:42] using them but it's not them there's no
[1:43:46] great man little man no big man amen
[1:43:50] praise God look through the years have
[1:43:53] seen it some use money to make
[1:43:55] themselves big some use education to
[1:43:56] make themselves look big some use their
[1:43:59] cultural background and this and that to
[1:44:01] elevate
[1:44:03] themselves that's not what it is might
[1:44:06] give you a Earthly Ministry that looks
[1:44:08] big that's fine but that's not what this
[1:44:10] is brother sister this is a letting go
[1:44:13] and letting God have his his glory
[1:44:16] through you for his glory and honor
[1:44:19] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:44:21] Lord God Amen we still have some time
[1:44:24] you don't
[1:44:25] mind
[1:44:27] okay
[1:44:31] hallelujah praise the
[1:44:33] Lord you remember you know that Peter
[1:44:36] had a spoken word from Jesus himself you
[1:44:39] know Peter had the spoken word the
[1:44:41] literal because Jesus was speaking so if
[1:44:44] you had talk about spoken word it was
[1:44:46] coming out of the mouth of Jesus right
[1:44:48] to
[1:44:49] Peter and when Jesus was speaking the
[1:44:53] word listen what he says in Matthew 28
[1:44:58] 18-20 and Jesus spake unto them saying
[1:45:01] all power is given unto me you don't
[1:45:04] mind my kind of taking my time right
[1:45:06] take your
[1:45:07] time in heaven and in Earth go ye
[1:45:12] therefore and teach All Nations
[1:45:15] baptizing
[1:45:17] them in the
[1:45:19] name notice it don't say names
[1:45:24] singular one name for this person that
[1:45:28] is Father Son and Holy Ghost I'm just
[1:45:32] taking a natural thing here just look at
[1:45:34] it naturally it's not plural it's
[1:45:37] already telling you it's one person so
[1:45:39] it says here name in the name of the
[1:45:43] father and of the son and of the Holy
[1:45:46] Ghost teaching them to observe all
[1:45:48] things wheresoever I've commanded you
[1:45:50] and lo I Am With You Always even today
[1:45:53] end of the
[1:45:54] world but on the day of
[1:45:58] Pentecost it's got to be that Peter
[1:46:00] disobeyed
[1:46:02] Jesus it means that uh Peter maybe
[1:46:07] rejected what Jesus said but that's not
[1:46:09] what happened before he had the Holy
[1:46:12] Ghost Jesus said that after he received
[1:46:16] the Holy Ghost and it comes upon Him
[1:46:19] amen by Revelation Peter OD what Jesus
[1:46:24] meant in Matthew 2818 and 19 by
[1:46:28] Revelation he
[1:46:29] understood and therefore he didn't go
[1:46:31] back and repeat the
[1:46:34] quote and
[1:46:36] say in the name of the father Glenn I
[1:46:40] baptize you in the name of the son in
[1:46:43] the name of the Holy Ghost I'll dunk you
[1:46:46] one more time no he didn't repeat that
[1:46:50] because he knew the name of that person
[1:46:53] who is Father Son and Holy Ghost is
[1:46:58] Jesus
[1:46:59] Christ so when they ask him men and
[1:47:02] Brethren acts 238 what shall we do to be
[1:47:06] saved he says
[1:47:08] repent be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:47:12] Christ
[1:47:14] hallelujah hallelujah praise God is
[1:47:17] right there for the remission of sins
[1:47:20] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:47:22] the Holy Ghost praise God hallelujah you
[1:47:27] see the baptism in the name of Jesus
[1:47:30] Christ is not just a simple thing
[1:47:32] sometimes we think that it's the just
[1:47:34] the preaching on the pulpit is powerful
[1:47:36] but the water baptism the person just
[1:47:38] goes into the pool and go under and they
[1:47:42] come back out it's not as simple as that
[1:47:45] you receive the Holy Ghost after that
[1:47:47] the spirit of the you gone through the
[1:47:49] water baptism the spirit will come upon
[1:47:51] you and begin reveal himself to you
[1:47:55] Peter says don't you know you go in the
[1:47:57] water as a as a old man you come up as a
[1:48:00] new man amen you go into the water and
[1:48:03] you come back out and it's it's like
[1:48:06] your sins being washed away amen you're
[1:48:09] leaving them behind you're planted as a
[1:48:12] old man you come up as a new person to
[1:48:14] live for Glory of the glory of God
[1:48:17] hallelujah how many people out there are
[1:48:19] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ are
[1:48:21] you talking about it
[1:48:23] are you letting your friends know about
[1:48:24] it you know the Bible tells us Ezekiel
[1:48:27] that son of man you know these things
[1:48:30] and if you don't warn the
[1:48:32] wicked their blood will be required at
[1:48:35] your
[1:48:35] hands but if you warn the wicked and
[1:48:38] they don't want to listen and they go on
[1:48:40] then the blood is on their own head but
[1:48:43] you be sure you warn them let them know
[1:48:46] it's not just going to a church you're
[1:48:48] religious you're a good person you're
[1:48:51] you're moral you have integrity and that
[1:48:54] sort of thing that's wonderful but you
[1:48:57] must bear the name of your husband and
[1:49:01] the name is Jesus Christ amen you come
[1:49:04] to him and you take him in your life you
[1:49:06] take him in your heart you're baptizing
[1:49:09] his name you're walking his name praise
[1:49:11] God you wear the the Ring of
[1:49:13] righteousness upon you uh praise God and
[1:49:16] he cover you with the robe oh Hallelujah
[1:49:20] you're ready for the Rapture glory to
[1:49:22] God God hallelujah yes sir so Peter only
[1:49:28] begin to get Revelation fully after the
[1:49:33] Holy Ghost came upon you I won't talk
[1:49:35] about that but they can get Revelation
[1:49:37] before but it's just spotty it's just
[1:49:40] here and there they get little breaks in
[1:49:43] Revelation right in the message they'll
[1:49:45] get a little break here a little break
[1:49:47] there but to have continuous Revelation
[1:49:49] where it it literally takes you over and
[1:49:51] controls you
[1:49:53] praise God for his
[1:49:55] glory amen hallelujah Peter said repent
[1:49:59] be baptized every one of you in the name
[1:50:02] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:50:03] sins you will receive the gift of the
[1:50:05] Holy Ghost for the promises what unto
[1:50:08] you that's them that were back
[1:50:11] there unto your
[1:50:14] children and to all that are a far off
[1:50:19] even as many as our Lord our God shall
[1:50:23] call Amen brother Bram said don't you
[1:50:26] understand is God still calling yes if
[1:50:29] he's still calling then this is for you
[1:50:32] yes this Holy Ghost is for you but you
[1:50:35] see the devil is cunning brother
[1:50:36] brandham talked about oh the days uh of
[1:50:40] all those Miracle meetings and those
[1:50:42] revivals are passed so some of them
[1:50:45] don't expect to have healings and the
[1:50:48] Holy Spirit moving in that kind of way
[1:50:51] anymore the prophet said says oh towns
[1:50:54] is not the initial evidence that doesn't
[1:50:56] mean that there is not real
[1:50:58] towns I speak in towns but I
[1:51:02] privately amen yes sir but you you
[1:51:06] understand see the devil always wants
[1:51:08] the Believers to throw out the baby and
[1:51:11] the B water the the the dirty water
[1:51:13] throw out the baby also no but no
[1:51:16] Mother's going to do that she'll throw
[1:51:17] out the dirty water and keep her
[1:51:20] baby amen and that's what exactly what
[1:51:23] God did through out the dirty water and
[1:51:25] keep his
[1:51:26] Jing right now what I'm saying to you
[1:51:30] brother and sister is that people say oh
[1:51:34] look I've gone to some of the major
[1:51:37] Church in this message these are
[1:51:39] churches with thousands maybe a few
[1:51:42] thousand people and I just start talking
[1:51:46] I haven't even gone five 10 minutes and
[1:51:49] people start shouting and crying and
[1:51:52] spirit of God start moving and after I'm
[1:51:57] done Minister may get up and said you
[1:51:59] know uh we are not Pentecostals we are
[1:52:03] believers of the message of brother
[1:52:08] brand well of course it's an it's a
[1:52:13] indirect uh you know uh thing to me that
[1:52:18] uh you're too much
[1:52:20] Pentecostal they don't
[1:52:23] understand that the foundation stone
[1:52:27] brother brandham said and the Capstone
[1:52:30] is the same
[1:52:33] Stone
[1:52:35] Alpha and Omega is the same amen they
[1:52:40] don't understand it one is here without
[1:52:44] having maybe a full Revelation Paul was
[1:52:47] the one that caught the full Revelation
[1:52:49] and began to spread it there but over
[1:52:51] here was everybody capable of receiving
[1:52:53] it right now
[1:52:56] Alpha
[1:52:58] Omega right so what I'm saying to you we
[1:53:01] are the original
[1:53:03] Pentecostals but the devil got it so
[1:53:06] much that it becomes like a curse word
[1:53:08] in the message if you say Pentecostal
[1:53:12] but you it's the Holy Spirit working on
[1:53:15] the life of the believer it will not be
[1:53:18] behave like it in the Pentecostal
[1:53:20] denomination
[1:53:23] uh um a pause here you know before Jesus
[1:53:27] came the devil sent the Pharisees and
[1:53:29] the Sadducees to start to put on an act
[1:53:32] of how a a a real righteous person
[1:53:36] should be and it was just a act so that
[1:53:40] when Jesus would come the people won't
[1:53:43] believe him because he's we have already
[1:53:46] already a pattern
[1:53:48] here and we've seen through a hundred
[1:53:51] years how a really good person will act
[1:53:53] and you come here and you breaking the
[1:53:55] whole thing
[1:53:56] up you saying that you're they're the
[1:53:58] devil and and and you are the Son of God
[1:54:02] and before Abraham was I am my goodness
[1:54:06] you see it's the same thing so the devil
[1:54:10] does the same thing Prophet speaks about
[1:54:12] healing he speaks about miracles he
[1:54:14] speaks about Pentecost said the
[1:54:18] system the days of the Pentecostal
[1:54:21] system is done it's dried up it's over
[1:54:24] it's gone not the spirit that was there
[1:54:27] that spirit is for every one of us it's
[1:54:30] Jesus
[1:54:31] Christ but the devil wants to scare you
[1:54:34] off from that amen praise the Lord look
[1:54:38] you know that right in this church when
[1:54:41] the little Revival broke
[1:54:44] out uh on in The Little White Church
[1:54:48] which would even people weren't even
[1:54:49] considering in the church it was just
[1:54:52] the thought it was like a barn or
[1:54:54] something but nevertheless people people
[1:54:57] would come in full of demons and scream
[1:54:59] and run out the doors some will fall on
[1:55:02] the floor the Holy Ghost would would be
[1:55:04] having his way praise God people will
[1:55:07] come in sit down and then the Holy
[1:55:09] Spirit start telling them their whole
[1:55:11] say not by calling them out but the
[1:55:13] preacher will start talking and
[1:55:15] preaching exactly their situation you
[1:55:18] can't know that somebody told you I want
[1:55:19] to fight the preacher but it was the
[1:55:22] whole Holy Ghost you see and and the
[1:55:25] church was like that day after day some
[1:55:29] of you are still here that saw some of
[1:55:30] those things and my goodness people were
[1:55:34] coming as far as
[1:55:36] windso
[1:55:38] Aur they coming they were coming from
[1:55:43] everywhere filling that place that could
[1:55:46] that only had we only had a um what you
[1:55:50] call it we are only allowed by theity to
[1:55:52] have 12 people in there but it was
[1:55:55] filled filled always filled up and the
[1:55:57] spirit of God was moving well of course
[1:56:00] they said oh you guys are all
[1:56:03] Pentecostals oh my goodness what is this
[1:56:06] going on how can you leave the messaging
[1:56:09] and then another day after the preaching
[1:56:11] of the word that same brother will come
[1:56:13] back and say oh man Brothers you
[1:56:17] brothers are so full of the word I don't
[1:56:20] understand uh my God is something else I
[1:56:23] said brother why don't you make up your
[1:56:25] mind we full of the word or full of the
[1:56:27] spirit or
[1:56:29] which which one is
[1:56:32] it but you don't understand the word
[1:56:34] works with the
[1:56:38] spirit the White Horse is the word and
[1:56:41] the rider is the holy spirit he rides on
[1:56:44] the word and comes to us praise the name
[1:56:46] of the Lord
[1:56:48] so again we see the separation time that
[1:56:51] was in in the
[1:56:53] wilderness we see it here now in the
[1:56:55] book of Acts because the the Holy Ghost
[1:56:58] made a difference and without doing
[1:57:01] anything they were separated from
[1:57:03] anything that was not like him you know
[1:57:06] Judas went and hanged himself how many
[1:57:09] knows that Akil D the field of blood he
[1:57:13] hanged his own self and anybody that may
[1:57:17] they smart they're good people but
[1:57:19] you'll hang yourself after a while
[1:57:21] you're own life and your own actions and
[1:57:24] activity you're going to be left hanging
[1:57:27] right that way and you'll be doing it
[1:57:30] yourself now let's go to the Old
[1:57:32] Testament we find out here in J I'm
[1:57:35] going to move quickly now because we're
[1:57:37] almost uh to our
[1:57:40] time in Joshua
[1:57:43] 2224 uh praise the Lord you don't need
[1:57:45] to put it up now sister I'm just going
[1:57:47] to run through a few things here before
[1:57:49] we leave this is talking about giving
[1:57:52] you so you can write that down I'm not
[1:57:54] going to read out the scripture the the
[1:57:56] the tribe of Reuben after they had had
[1:58:00] the battles and they fought and defeated
[1:58:02] the enemy and they followed Joshua you
[1:58:05] know when Joshua was giving out the
[1:58:08] lands they they had a desire because
[1:58:12] Moses while Moses was alive to that
[1:58:16] tribe of Reuben he spoke to them that
[1:58:18] they could live on the side the
[1:58:22] Wilderness side of Jordan so you
[1:58:25] understand the Wilderness side of Jordan
[1:58:27] and the Canaan or Promised Land side of
[1:58:31] Jordan right so when the battle was over
[1:58:35] instead of them staying in the promised
[1:58:37] land with Joshua and the others they
[1:58:40] said oh no we listening to the message
[1:58:42] of
[1:58:44] Moses and we going back and we going to
[1:58:47] live on that side back in the wilderness
[1:58:50] side they decide to go back you can read
[1:58:53] the whole chapter when you have the time
[1:58:55] right so what I'm saying it was a
[1:58:58] natural separation Joshua didn't chase
[1:59:00] them out Joshua didn't send them back
[1:59:03] Joshua didn't tell them anything they
[1:59:05] decided this is not for me I prefer and
[1:59:08] they even set up their own altar in
[1:59:10] their own way and Israel wanted to go
[1:59:12] fight with them and then Joshua said no
[1:59:15] no no leave them they want to do that
[1:59:17] leave them alone and um they just let
[1:59:20] them go so that separation is here now
[1:59:24] it's happening right now and so um we
[1:59:27] see that's going on as we speak now then
[1:59:30] we go Jesus now we come to Jesus and he
[1:59:33] said you know the Kingdom of Heaven is
[1:59:37] like a man who threw a net in the
[1:59:39] sea right do you know the prophet calls
[1:59:42] the message like a big net and that he
[1:59:45] would throw the net out he says but when
[1:59:47] the net comes in he says quoting here
[1:59:52] uh this is in um is that scripture I
[1:59:57] think it's in Matthew anyway Matthew
[2:00:02] 1347 to 51 just so you can study it when
[2:00:05] you go home uh see you have that he said
[2:00:09] the scavenger fish the prophet says man
[2:00:12] brings the net in and he brings in
[2:00:15] scavengers right Turtles
[2:00:19] crawfish fish is in there too
[2:00:22] and then uh other he says snakes spiders
[2:00:27] crabs all coming in the same net right
[2:00:31] praise God my goodness of course we know
[2:00:35] that um um that he's speaking of
[2:00:38] Believers those Spirits are around
[2:00:41] people right praise the Lord praise God
[2:00:44] and so the time has come now he said
[2:00:48] when The Messengers the angels are going
[2:00:50] to start separating
[2:00:53] separating finding the fish right and
[2:00:58] those ones can go back in the sea if
[2:00:59] they want to but they got to keep those
[2:01:02] fish for the glory of
[2:01:05] God read the scripture and you can go
[2:01:07] through that yourself Hallelujah now I'm
[2:01:10] going to bring this thought where the
[2:01:12] brother brandom is speaking about the
[2:01:14] Kent Vision when he said I was standing
[2:01:17] in the Sun and I I preached the word and
[2:01:20] came to a climax and wanted to go to
[2:01:23] another Climax by the time he finish the
[2:01:26] second pull people start uh walking away
[2:01:29] because when the seven seal was open
[2:01:31] there was nothing in it in the sense so
[2:01:34] that your eyes could see you can read it
[2:01:36] over a thousand times and it doesn't say
[2:01:38] anything in there like the other ones
[2:01:40] tell you this this this that uh and it
[2:01:44] don't know what opening on the seven
[2:01:45] seal what was there because it's
[2:01:48] something Supernatural came out of the
[2:01:50] seals
[2:01:53] it was the coming of the
[2:01:55] Lord the coming of the Lord to his bride
[2:01:58] coming as a thief in the night coming to
[2:02:00] his bride to get her out of here and he
[2:02:03] never understood that praise the name of
[2:02:06] the Lord hallelujah so we see therefore
[2:02:09] that Jesus spoke about that separation
[2:02:12] coming but the preachers The Messengers
[2:02:15] The Angels will do that by the preaching
[2:02:18] of the word they're not going to
[2:02:20] deliberately go out there preaching to
[2:02:23] uh no they just preach the word and the
[2:02:25] word is going to allow that to happen
[2:02:28] praise God next brother brandom speaking
[2:02:32] about uh that's the 10th Vision about
[2:02:35] the people walking away from him before
[2:02:39] he could get to his
[2:02:41] climax because they felt natural hunger
[2:02:45] they got to they got to make money they
[2:02:47] got to have a job they got to eat they
[2:02:49] got to wear he says you know they had
[2:02:51] natural longer he says but for
[2:02:55] biscuits rather than this Rich word that
[2:02:58] they're receiving they rather to go find
[2:03:01] biscuits and he tried he said he tried
[2:03:03] to call out to say no don't go stay I am
[2:03:07] coming to my climax this is the word of
[2:03:10] God it's it's being Vindicated stay with
[2:03:13] the word amen nevertheless they went out
[2:03:17] he says but you
[2:03:19] know I wa I stood there
[2:03:22] because I knew a small group will come
[2:03:26] back when the evening Shadows Fall
[2:03:29] evening time when the Shadows Fall
[2:03:32] there's a small group coming back that
[2:03:34] they're going to hear the rest of that
[2:03:36] message when it hits this Climax and I
[2:03:39] believe that it's hitting the climax
[2:03:41] right now praise God hallelujah because
[2:03:44] when they came back and and the people
[2:03:45] start asking where where is the prophet
[2:03:48] where's the prophet praise God
[2:03:50] hallelujah he said oh he's
[2:03:54] resting praise God well I don't have to
[2:03:57] explain that the prophet is resting
[2:03:59] right now am praise the Lord and in that
[2:04:01] time that little group that comes back
[2:04:03] goes into his climax praise God and
[2:04:06] that's the group praise God I'm talking
[2:04:08] about they're separated by the word
[2:04:11] itself praise God hallelujah Now quickly
[2:04:15] closing
[2:04:17] now amen in you remember he spoke about
[2:04:22] the preview of the church how many many
[2:04:25] talks about those young ladies that were
[2:04:28] marching and they were marching to the
[2:04:31] sound of the music you can find that I'm
[2:04:34] going to give you I got these Pages here
[2:04:36] but this you know not going to go
[2:04:39] through all of that just going to give
[2:04:41] you words choosing of a bride and it
[2:04:44] starts paragraph
[2:04:46] 198 to paragraph
[2:04:49] 214 you have all weak to be able to look
[2:04:52] at these things oh my goodness see so
[2:04:55] they were marching he says on one group
[2:04:59] when they're marching looking so Grand
[2:05:01] as they went past but the other group
[2:05:04] were so
[2:05:05] filthy amen filthy dressed and filthy
[2:05:10] how they're walking and twisting and
[2:05:12] moving themselves like that and then he
[2:05:15] ends up by saying and these started
[2:05:20] marching one
[2:05:22] One Step Up they marched right up into
[2:05:26] the skies and then they went to marching
[2:05:30] amen and other ones they marched too to
[2:05:35] the they March to the edge of the cliff
[2:05:37] but instead of going up they went
[2:05:40] down amen praise God hallelujah oh my
[2:05:45] and one of them that was marching tried
[2:05:49] to look look back some foreign girl
[2:05:52] either this or that he mentioned a few
[2:05:55] countries here and he said and I woke up
[2:05:57] saying don't do that don't do that don't
[2:06:01] get out of Step Hallelujah I screamed
[2:06:04] like that and woke up with my hand out
[2:06:06] like that hallelujah oh my praise God my
[2:06:11] friends I want to ask you is it later
[2:06:13] than we
[2:06:15] think could she already be called Chosen
[2:06:19] and sealed away there were won't be one
[2:06:22] extra one in that you know could it be
[2:06:26] possible oh yes oh yes praise the Lord
[2:06:31] hallelujah so I believe the time is now
[2:06:34] when the bride is going to start coming
[2:06:36] out of the
[2:06:37] shadows out of the kitchen where she was
[2:06:40] with all the pots and pants and them old
[2:06:43] cousins making a mockery of her she's
[2:06:47] coming out of the Shadows now God is
[2:06:50] going to bring her into public view
[2:06:53] praise the name of the Lord and um he's
[2:06:56] going to and she's coming with the same
[2:06:59] sound of the same uh if you want to call
[2:07:02] it music amen as they had in the first
[2:07:06] church age when they March P she's
[2:07:10] coming back now with the same sound of
[2:07:13] the same music amen praise God and not
[2:07:17] only that she's keeping ranks right
[2:07:21] coule brother Braham said one of them
[2:07:22] looked back and starting to misstep and
[2:07:25] he said no don't do that keep in step
[2:07:28] Hallelujah so we got to keep ranks we
[2:07:32] got to stay disciplined with the word
[2:07:34] and move with the same sound of the
[2:07:37] music amen praise the Lord hallelujah
[2:07:40] keeping step with the message and
[2:07:43] knowing the Rhythm and
[2:07:46] changes of the word like the men of
[2:07:49] isachar the tribe of isachar men the
[2:07:52] Bible say men who knew the times and the
[2:07:56] seasons when Israel how they should go
[2:08:00] out when they should come in when they
[2:08:01] should turn this way or that way these
[2:08:03] men were given inspiration that tribe to
[2:08:07] tell the leaders elders of Israel this
[2:08:10] or that or the other praise God
[2:08:12] hallelujah I want you to notice that
[2:08:14] both groups thought they were going into
[2:08:16] heaven both groups thought they were
[2:08:18] going in the
[2:08:20] rapture and both groups walk to the edge
[2:08:23] of the
[2:08:24] cliff confident that they're going in
[2:08:26] the Rapture but when one group steep
[2:08:30] down step out they went down and the
[2:08:33] other group went up so you see brother
[2:08:38] brandham said after you caught in the
[2:08:40] Rapture there's a lot of people going to
[2:08:42] still be preaching what do you think
[2:08:43] they're going to be preaching it's this
[2:08:46] message and they going to be preaching
[2:08:48] about the
[2:08:49] Rapture and wake up to realize the
[2:08:52] Rapture is gone how could it be gone
[2:08:54] wasn't this supposed to happen that
[2:08:56] supposed to it's already happened but it
[2:08:59] happened so simply that you didn't know
[2:09:02] it right you didn't recognize what was
[2:09:06] going on it's all look look took place
[2:09:10] finished gone already closing with this
[2:09:13] thought of the deep call to the Deep
[2:09:17] that's the last quotation he says now
[2:09:20] friends when our life here on this Earth
[2:09:23] is over and our last prayer and all our
[2:09:27] battles are all done all the smoke is
[2:09:31] dried up gone away all the arms are now
[2:09:36] stacked the bibles are now
[2:09:40] closed and we come to your house Lord
[2:09:44] that great morning breaks Eternal bright
[2:09:47] and fair when the chosen ones Shall
[2:09:50] Gather to their home beyond the skies
[2:09:53] the poet said Lord as we see the great
[2:09:56] table stretched out there for that
[2:09:59] supper thousands of miles long looking
[2:10:02] across the table at each other battles
[2:10:04] scarred veterans tears of joy running
[2:10:07] down their cheeks the king comes out in
[2:10:10] his beauty of Holiness walks along the
[2:10:14] table take his own hands and wipe the
[2:10:16] tears from our eyes saying don't cry no
[2:10:20] more it's all over enter into the joys
[2:10:25] of the Lord Friends toils of the road as
[2:10:29] the musicians come of will then seem as
[2:10:34] nothing when we get to the end of the
[2:10:38] way praise the Lord may God bless your
[2:10:41] hearts today if there any that's not
[2:10:44] baptize be sure to be baptized in the
[2:10:47] name of Jesus Christ speak to one of the
[2:10:49] elders amen
[2:10:52] and that God will use you and that God
[2:10:54] will grant you the baptism the Holy
[2:10:56] Ghost as the prophet said the baptism
[2:11:00] Holy Ghost in This day without
[2:11:03] sensation amen praise God hallelujah let
[2:11:08] the Holy Spirit have his way in your
[2:11:10] life let him show you that you have a
[2:11:14] different Spirit on you no matter what
[2:11:17] your family says what your relative says

[2:11:23] word of the Living God we are not here
