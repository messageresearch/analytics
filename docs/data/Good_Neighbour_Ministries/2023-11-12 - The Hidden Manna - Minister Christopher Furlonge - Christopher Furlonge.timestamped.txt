[0:35] God bless you Saints and welcome into
[0:38] the house of the Lord amen I'm going to
[0:40] read from 1 John chapter
[0:44] 2 verse 15 it says love not the world
[0:49] neither the things that are in the world
[0:52] if any man love the world the love of
[0:55] the father is not in him for all that is
[0:58] in the world the lust of the Flesh and
[1:01] the lust of the eyes and the pride of
[1:04] life is not of the father but is of the
[1:09] world and the world passeth away and the
[1:13] lust thereof but he that doeth the will
[1:16] of God abideth
[1:20] forever praise God God bless you Saints
[1:23] let us all
[1:25] Rejoice today as we gather and
[1:28] fellowship around the word of God As we
[1:30] sing these songs the purpose of the
[1:33] singing and the songs is to lift the
[1:36] Lord Jesus and all that does is pull us
[1:40] up into Heavenly places where All Things
[1:43] become possible and while you're singing
[1:45] and you're rejoicing in the Lord you're
[1:48] receiving the blessings and God is
[1:51] speaking and God is preparing our hearts
[1:54] to receive his word amen praise God
[1:57] there's nothing greater than coming in
[1:59] into the house of the Lord and preparing
[2:02] for his word God bless you brother

[13:37] writer of the
[13:39] song he talked about what inspired him
[13:42] about this
[13:43] song he had heard a story of this man
[13:46] who I guess he was from Iran and Muslim
[13:49] guy who had got converted into
[13:51] Christianity and this man went against
[13:54] all the laws went around the country and
[13:56] raising up churches he would raise up 10
[13:59] Church 10 people 10 churches with 10
[14:01] people and they would go around and they
[14:03] would be ministering the gospel he
[14:05] eventually got arrested and was being
[14:08] persecuted by the government what they
[14:11] will do they will let his fingers grow
[14:13] out and take a visce grip and pull one
[14:16] nail out for each of the churches he
[14:19] rose up we might not have to go through
[14:22] that but let us look at our situation
[14:25] and see where where we could be more
[14:27] given unto the Lord where we can
[14:29] let ourself go give our away and some
[14:32] probably we've been persecuted by our
[14:34] our family probably by somebody at work
[14:37] but today just to remind you to give
[14:39] yourself more unto him there's many

[1:33:04] concealed from the rest of the
[1:33:09] worlden

[1:43:28] cannibal you see they failed to real
[1:43:32] recognize what he was speaking about
[1:43:35] because Jesus loved to speak in
[1:43:37] Parables and it only takes Faith or
[1:43:40] Revelation to understand what he was
[1:43:42] speaking about and Simon Peter knew what
[1:43:46] he was speaking about when he said to go
[1:43:48] baptize amen so when Jesus said to feed
[1:43:51] on my flesh amen and drink my blood you

[1:44:28] people Amen to feed his people to feed
[1:44:32] the pl amen hallelujah and that's what
[1:44:35] is happening today that hidden
[1:44:38] manner amen that was St up God is giving

[2:08:52] school WhatsApp group chat okay it's for
[2:08:56] parents that have children in their
[2:08:59] Sunday
[2:09:00] school and it'll be moderated by Sister
[2:09:03] Marsha she will be sending out or maybe
[2:09:06] already has for some of the parents um
[2:09:10] you'll receive a message uh inviting you
[2:09:13] to this group chat as a parent that has
[2:09:16] a Sunday school child or children
[2:09:18] children in the ministry and it'll be
[2:09:20] used basically to collaborate on special
[2:09:24] events activities okay when they're
[2:09:27] doing song specials or upcoming events
[2:09:30] that they need to do practices for then
[2:09:32] they can notify you through this group
[2:09:35] chat and also for parents when they want
[2:09:38] to um you know communicate that their
[2:09:41] child will not be in the Sunday school
[2:09:44] because they may be sick or for whatever
[2:09:47] reason it's good for the Sunday School
[2:09:49] teachers to know in advance it helps
[2:09:52] them to properly prepare and they'll
[2:09:55] also be praying for your children if
[2:09:57] they're sick or whatever the situation
[2:10:00] might be amen so be looking um for that
[2:10:03] it's going to be strictly for parents
[2:10:05] that have Sunday school children that's
[2:10:08] who will be a part of this group
[2:10:12] chat uh Sunday school just a reminder it
[2:10:15] starts with two classes uh we have two
[2:10:17] classes
[2:10:18] ages is it 3 to five or 3 to
[2:10:23] six it's 3 to
[2:10:26] S okay so it's for children 3 to 7 and
[2:10:30] then there's another class that is from
[2:10:33] 8 to 12 amen and so those Sunday School
[2:10:38] classes they start at 10:25 am sharp
[2:10:44] it's important that you bring your
[2:10:47] children in before 10:25 so that the
[2:10:51] Sunday School teachers can start right
[2:10:54] at 10:25 sharp because they need to be
[2:10:57] we want to run it for about 30 minutes
[2:11:00] it needs to stop no later than
[2:11:04] 1055 at the very latest because some of
[2:11:08] the teachers do have other Ministries
[2:11:11] within the ministry for example they're
[2:11:13] in the worship team and so we are
[2:11:15] expecting that at 11:00 a.m. when the
[2:11:18] sun when when the song service starts
[2:11:22] everybody's in the sanctuary parents
[2:11:24] have their children and they're in the
[2:11:26] sanctuary with their children getting
[2:11:29] into the worship in order to prepare for
[2:11:32] the word the worship team they're going
[2:11:35] to be starting right at 11:00 am. and so
[2:11:38] those Sunday school teachers that are
[2:11:40] involved they need to be up here before
[2:11:44] 11:00 a.m. and so we want to remind the
[2:11:47] teachers even that they must finish
[2:11:50] their classes must finish their classes
[2:11:54] by 1055 am so that everybody can be in
[2:12:00] the
[2:12:01] sanctuary in the
[2:12:02] worship and when I say everybody that
[2:12:05] means everybody deacons trustees ushers
[2:12:11] whatever uh Ministry you might have even
[2:12:15] the cleaners your cleaning Duties are to
[2:12:17] be done either either before or after
[2:12:20] the worship and the word because we want
[2:12:24] everybody to be in the house of the Lord
[2:12:27] to receive the word of God that is going
[2:12:29] to come down every Sunday every
[2:12:33] Wednesday we we uh uh you know we want
[2:12:36] this proper order in place it's a part
[2:12:38] of the body coming together in the unity
[2:12:42] of the faith it's the things that are
[2:12:43] being preached amen and so it shows
[2:12:48] if you're actually catching the
[2:12:50] Revelation when you get into your
[2:12:54] position and you follow the leadership
