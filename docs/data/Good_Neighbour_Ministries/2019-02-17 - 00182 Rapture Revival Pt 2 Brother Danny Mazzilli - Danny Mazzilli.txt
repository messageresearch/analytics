TRANSCRIPT
========================================
yeah yeah well we're still only 21 years old praise God amen well it's good to be in the house the Lord once again this morning we ministered here back in January the rap should be fine it's exactly one month ago and I knew I wasn't finished there yet and I know I'm still not finished because there's just so much that we can draw from it and its really a series that have been on for the last 10 years which is called calling the resurrection it's all under that inspiration of the Holy Spirit you know really inspires me in that area and you know today you'll understand even more how the gifts operate in the body of Christ and how it is that the Lord we use in certain ways and how each and every one of us is uniquely designed by the hand of God amen for a certain and appropriate time this season amen so praise God we're going to continue along that line you can put up the first slide we're going to take the same scripture that we took from January the 12th I believe of us and then we'll move on there will be some whole-step that are seeing you notice but it's just the way the Lord just inspired you know breaking down drawing from and pulling from what has been been available to us in the storehouse that God gave us through a vindicated prophet amen praise God we are feasting and we have a storehouse that's that's eternal amen and eternal small house is full of nuggets a lot of people often turn around saying why you just got to say exactly what the Prophet said nothing more nothing less that's because they don't have a revelation on what the Prophet said it's just that simpler because if they had a revelation of the mind of God and the revelation and how God gives revelation and how its divided now it's personally inspired every son and daughter of a drive because we all have a part that we must fulfill then you won't say things like that you can drop from the storehouse and you will receive inspiration in its season important to what God asks you to do amen praise God forevermore so before we do us to pray father what a privilege and what an honor for each and every one of us this morning that we can assemble under the message of this day this hour knowing that it is your spirit that comes and ministers to each and every lead that it is you the mighty to let us come down in this day this hour that operates to a fine ministry to perfect your church and to get her ready for the fulfillment of the rapture of the bride Lord what a privilege bless and prosper speaker and here this morning thank you for reading our pastor box from ready Lord willing Oh God many years of experience that we continue to drop on and continue to feed upon Lord we are so blessed that you placed a living candle in our midst you could do the praise the glory and the honor bless us now we pray heavenly places in Jesus name communion according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundations of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption there's a there's a time when you as a son or a daughter of God will be adopted he will be placed you will be positioned in the mock of Jesus Christ it is absolutely essential for each and every southerner God to receive this because it's his promise he did it from these four the foundations of the world so we are just now manifesting it in its time and in its season adoption of children by what by Jesus for us Tolu himself they want to say there's three times he's saying right there to himself because this is about the plan this is about his plan redeeming his own to himself according to the good pleasure of their go know his will praise God do the Lord has blessed us Coubertin next slide I don't want to use the clicker ok soldier this way you can be a part of the service and you can receive - amen praise God it says your mother says that when you see BP dance because it's brother branham's money he says but to the church the pride the rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her that the revelation the truth private Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture revelation one morning that's going to fulfill all the December eesti month line upon line precept upon precept but then Cox didn't truck one last revelation and it's going to change it's gonna translate you it's going to move you from this dimension directly into the other dimension amen praise God next slide Ephesians chapter 2 verse 21 it continues to say in home oh the building hit me bringing together brought unto an holy temple in how many bodies are going in the rapture the bottom of Jesus Christ and when you were called into this revelation is because you were positionally being placed and adopted as a son or a god of God to fulfill a certain part in the word so that that revelation of the rapture of the church being translated can be fulfilled you must find your position to be placed through the mystery of word through the word being preached through Malachi 4:5 restoring the word of them revelation 10 to 7 the mighty angel coming down and now the fivefold ministry speaking the word perfecting the church positionally placing give you direction of instruction according to his purpose and season and his word next brother and says here now preaching usually catches the center brings another confirmation by the word but teaching places the man positionally what he is and we can never be able to have faith until positionally we know what you now in the united states of this fair land as an ambassador of this nation to Russia that if they have officially sent me to record all the power that the United States ask is behind me my word is just the same as the United States and I have been recognized as an ambassador and you has a son of God that's been positionally placed by the Word of God have been given an authority you do not have to bow down to the circumstances that that are in your life that control you in any way shape or form if I talked to you would have not picked by the Word of God to do demons you can speak the word because but please not 14 you [Music] [Music] [Music] in the south this work cannot return for big next time anyone this is number of the brand sweet anyone who attends this church for any length of time without hearing about the need to have the [Music] Ministry of the Lord because that's who we are we exist to disciple ministers I'm not just talking about ministers that come and stand behind the pulpit but you are cleaning the washrooms water Minister because we're going to string them to the bar because it's his house you have [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that's how much for that's how much confidence to be the keys to the kingdom all such great promises he's given to the church how many emotion you not be activated you can't just be some church members sitting at the Pew we didn't wake up without having a purpose without having a desire to bless and edify the body of Jesus Christ [Music] [Music] [Music] or recognize those things and that's why your deacon or your pastor or the Holy Spirit come and minister to you to a friend to the mob through whatever it is because he does not care how he's going to give to you name because his revelation is divided to spire it's no man can give revelation that's why it's rather than how he comes to speak dog who's that dog [Music] there's no you should be this is wonderful you can see how all these things because it expresses and now Christ in the church is just be made know the whole thing is the revelation of God to take heed back to her right position again with her husband notice and Donna's husband of the church and the church is his bride all if the judge only knew its position [Music] [Music] receiving perfect beauty so that you can the rapture when it knows what it is what's one of the primary reasons that we exist is for you happy to discover God's purposes to the Lord we have about seven seals or seven Church ages or anything like that when God calls an individual it's a supernatural event here in okay he comes he calls and then he gives the Holy Ghost to you wakens that attributed body waters that seed that's in there from before the foundation of the world and then he needs and died and I'll just bring you this it's gotta bring it to her you recognize who you are because the problem of their church denominational world reach the point of the rapture is because they take the word and they just keep their own interpretation the first church a second church a stir and it kept progressing it kept moving on and kept moving on until we are here to the same spirit which is positionally placing them that's why I try to listen the rapture revival because because we need to be we need to be open up out of that sleep state that the Scriptures said wake up out of that sleepy condition because the foolish virgin she was sleeping she didn't hear the call of the bridegroom he's probably not the wise here [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] it's by doing ministries how to discover your purpose what and how God made you to be determines what he intends for you to do [Music] I will see more [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] listen so you for example that's what they do there just because [Music] [Music] all these experiences were deliverance you were gonna take you certain experiences and supernatural things and they wanted to that cannot build or add by the body this a total waste right that's the same might deal with Christians would don't discover their ministry there's many many different mysteries like I can't give it up just that this this is like an introduction and then for them because us Lord needs fervor for me to come to Mister again because I'm having so much fun and bless you from this this series that I believe there's so much more that we can drop prophet but we're just gonna hide that we they have certain things so we get you thinking and get you looking within yourself that would be a total waste doesn't deal [Music] [Music] [Music] you need to discover your unique design you can't see this because this is something that's been used teachings there's a lot of teachings out there but let me tell you something you when you take that teaching you start breathing to manifestation of you so you need to discover a very needy designer for your ministry you're given gifts and abilities in serving God and others this is not just about serving stuff a lot of people what certain Lord while you serving yourself because you you know you know you know edify your brother or your sister in the way that you're serving the Lord you can be in a position in the church and be miserable what I'm talking about works here you can tell the difference when somebody's operating in their office they don't show up they put things of the world the things of God more oh yeah listen this is the awkward area it's going to be you know things are going to be exposed because remember this is the only time this is a perfecting time this is not an officer not because it's convenient you are going to be in town and you know things are [Music] it's not because Jesus he said it was to love it was now I'm not talking about correcting and something has his ways of correct even identifying and dealing with the people in the church he has [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] but you're gifted of God it's not work it's a battle but it's not work it's different you're just naturally able to do the things just gives you you can be the best cleaner nobody please my brother what he does the class because it's clean that's one aspect of his ministry what yeah it's a part of a ministry [Music] [Music] your character your gifts are building by defeating on the word assembly yourselves and remaining sensitive to this leading through a prayer life occur tonight assembling yourself people are taking it to life but you can be a mystery here and one of you are in ministry operating in your ministry to realize that you are overcome because you received when you receive this message [Music] because the situation supernatural [Music] receive the word about you Dennis your master of life you're you're receiving the healing virtue that come from the word about the receding toll the genre that provided all of your needs he's just supernaturally killing me with his word we can be by ourselves okay simple questions [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so these place those spiritual gifts it will show demonstrate vindicated a man must be sometimes pastor Simon calls we must been brother I can't take the service time I am stuffing I've been preparing I think what we rounded the Lord's I said what I got love this is good [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] next personality where it is my personality best suit need to serve if your are going your to communicate with people and you know you love kids if you've got natural abilities and you've got a personality that goes with your abilities and how do you know that they can pulse with your abilities is when you operate and that ability your personality shines it doesn't it doesn't [Music] [Music] sometimes I would see what I thought there was something to come to me but my wife my brother said go easy see our personalities are designed in a certain way for a purpose but then we need to know how to harness you and develop and grow in Christ a lot of the Spirit on the mind of Christ to take a hold of that personality that seemed still that seems a little bit hard but that went up needs to use it under the desperation under the leadership of the revelation and decision it does its purpose you see that's the thing that's where we need to come and realize how we've been built how we've been designed and how we are in the body of Jesus Christ where is my personality used in the situation's into the people into whatever it is into your hats you'll be seen because it's God's love God's Way when it's not about think there's a huge difference when it's being done and you don't want to do it experiences experience Lord Jesus because you know I've just had so many experiences most of my fault because it's pity or whatever else but then a lot of them because God [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so you need to look at the positive aspects of your experiences [Applause] [Music] [Music] revelation nothing you can only have to see you were let them speak to her [Music]
