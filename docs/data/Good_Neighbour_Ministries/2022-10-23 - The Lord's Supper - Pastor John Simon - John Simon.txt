before set cross bow foreign [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah self-sacrifice amen testimony [Music] kings and Lord of lords you know I'm sure as you all you know I am and who is seeing me all are that you know our hearts are heavy in terms of the sudden loss of our dearly beloved sister Johnson and um it's on my heart to share you know two aspects of a testimony with you about her because if you read you know be reflecting on the same thing you know when these moments in time happen in our lives we just start thinking about that person and how much they've meant to us and our history with them may the Lord help me and I pray this testimony it would be a blessing to you and our dearly beloved sister I you know come to reflect in real life I've known her practically all my life when I first came to Canada as a young teenager from Jamaica my mom and my aunt my grand Aunt sister Dale as you all may remember her we're a believer that the Pentecostal Church Western United Pentecostal and they were there with sister Jonathan sister Gloria and those Believers at that time and so I came to first know her from the Pentecostal church back then and so we all went there for a few years and until our wonderful Lord you know called our dear sister Johnson out and she learned of this message of Malachi 4. and just like the woman at the well and like Philip who went to speak to Nathanael when she received this amazing word and you know the living word for today the fullness of the word right that God sent it through his prophet she left the Pentecostal Church behind and she came and became a part of this ministry right but then what did she do she told Gloria she told my grand Aunt sister Dale she told my mom and then by God's grace the Lord quickened them opened their eyes and they came and they were also here Fellowship him and then surely enough after a while me the teenage meme moved out of Pentecost and you know we did our worldly things for the times that we were doing that but then you know by God's grace the appointed time that he would open my eyes and would call me out from you know living a life that wasn't to glorifying him and sure enough he was my grand Aunt sister Dale but then who was my first bride to church our beloved sister Johnson because she was the one who was taken them to church for all those years and so the first time when I came to the ministry and I was able to go with them and she brought us so initially in my beginning stage of my conversion it was Mr Johnson who was taking me to church then eventually no brother Michael asari and his family right because her car was full which was a good thing a good problem to have for them brother Michael was a blessing to me all those years as well could then his family and on Tuesday nights I would go up with Gabriel over the Desmond so a blessing to them as well but by God's grace I look back and I realize wow you know how wonderful it was that the Lord called her but what did she do she went and she told her friends she told others within the denomination that no there's more there's this word of Malachi 4 the prophet that God has sent you know to open if our eye for this last day's message right but that was one aspect and how much of course you know through the years our dear sister had been such an amazing blessing to myself and family and of course if you know with her singing and in our choir and everything just um amazing wonderful sister right but then the other part of the testimony that I'd like to share and brother Anthony gave a sneak peek of it a moment ago if you may recall a couple weeks I mentioned that our sister you know our small group out of the you know the 40 days of Prayer Ministry our small group continued and still continues to this day over a year later for the glory of God and so we continue to meet each week you know blessing each other and would you believe that the two weeks ago um you know in our fellowship we always will share a prayer request for each other and then take turns praying over that request so our two weeks ago when sister Johnson gave her prayer requested you know at that time it wasn't actually for her family you all know how much you were always praying for her family for the Lord to you know Quicken himself in them but this time our beloved sister was praying to be used by the Lord she was like she wants to wherever she goes that she can meet people and speak to people she's like she wants to be able to take new people to church because if you know she takes brother Abraham and family sister Jennifer but she was just Desiring to meet someone and her exact weather I must can go on the road if I'm at the store feed someone that I can speak to she says tell them about this wonderful message and bring them to church so at that time part of the reason why he stood out to me so much and I remember it so much is because I'm the one who prayed for that request and then of course by extension was praying from the rest of us in our group that the Lord would use us in that way so this was two weeks ago Thursday and that weekend that same weekend is when she was struck with the bell's palsy and so that the following Thursday which was you know a week ago now when we met you know by God's grace she came to the fellowship again and we prayed for her right and we were talking about that and we're a theme sister look you were praying for the Lord to use you to avenge life to be a witness and now the enemies strike in your body you can't drive anymore you know because of the condition she couldn't speak very well they said you wanted the Lord to use you to speak to others and to be able to take them to church and the enemy came and struck you physically and with your you know in your body but they said you know sister and of course we all prayed again believe in our Lord that he would heal her which we know he has and you know he delivered but I also now realize that of course our beloved sister has laid that down for us right and now we get to live that and we get to take that and then every time we go somewhere and we are able to be used of the Lord she was like Lord let there be somebody who's ready to receive this word that I could speak to them that with what she said so I wanted to share this for that we now we can take on that prayer we can take that mantle and every time there's an opportunity don't let the enemy give a self-doubt and let us hold back right but let us move forward and speak boldly as our sister would do to tell others and bring others to church amen if I wanted to share this with you to say that with her last prayer request within our group to be used of the Lord to be a blessing and I trust the Lord that by God's grave each time you witness it'll also be a testimony unto her for the glory of God so God bless you all Hallelujah when the road is [Music] [Music] foreign is [Music] [Music] [Applause] yeah thank you very much God bless you all it's wonderful to come into the house of God and hear the Cry of the Holy Spirit in the hearts of the Believers we certainly thank God for that that as I sat in the office and heard Believers worshiping singing bringing glory to God I can hear the voice of the spirit singing through them and glorifying uh his word we thank God for the presence of the Holy Spirit today we are gathered together and we are gathered here to have the Lord's Supper of course there are some that says it's the Lord's Supper so it should be you should take it in the night uh but the Bible says as often as you do as often as you come together as often as you want to right it doesn't lay any uh lines laws or restrictions on the time the day the place or whatever you can take it under a tree uh under this right circumstances so those are just legalistic human things using the Bible to enforce laws that God didn't put there there are no no laws in the New Testament we're not on the law we are on the grace and we are set free by the grace of God and by the Holy Spirit that doesn't mean we do foolishness it doesn't mean we become Lawless and rebellious but we keep to the word of God now I'm just speaking in general because for the true uh elect and Believers that is something that they don't even need an explanation for right but this is heard not just by you but by all so therefore we we need to know that that we are not here by tradition we are not here by practice or habit uh but we are here uh because we want to celebrate and memorialize uh the life of the Lord Jesus Christ because we are so thankful for what he has done for us and what he is now doing in US we are grateful to the Lord and we will ever be grateful and we will ever Praise Him and magnify his name throughout all the Eternal ages it will be an endless time of worship in the presence of the Living God now we have his presence with us partly because we see through a glass now Darkly so therefore we were in church maybe we are in the presence of the Lord but Satan with his distractions of life which we must participate in the systems around us we have to work we have to eat we have and then our minds slip away briefly to be able to accomplish that and sometimes in the middle of it if the word will take control comes back but what I'm saying we're going to a place where there'll be no distractions thank you there will be no time when your mind will be off of him because the Real the full realization that I and my father are one [Music] myself and God are one and the rivers run into the ocean amen and the ocean pushes back its life its power and its strength into the rivers so are we United with god with the life of God flowing from Deep to deep to deep from place to place believer to believe up that is how we begin to recognize that we are here praise God and His divine presence so I want you to know that that we are here uh of course thanking the lord for what he has done for us praise the Lord let me just get myself organized here a little bit praise God Hallelujah so when we come to this communion it's a powerful thing it's a living thing we come not to enter into the presence of an imaginary God but we are here in the presence of the Living God this great of power and presence of the person of Jesus Christ in the form of which he is in now amen praise the lord we come to reaffirm our faith and what we have said through our lifetime since we believed that this is what we believe we believe the word of God for this age and for this hour as expressed by God's prophet in this age and this time we are so thankful for that now I want you to know that we will continue to hold to the essence of our faith until he calls us home or we are raptured into the very presence of the Living God so let us hold this precious treasure as Paul said in our Earthly Tabernacles let us hold us in our hearts and preserve it there and keep the change don't let the parent presence of God flow out of you don't uh don't stop the bloodletting don't let the blood flow out from you but keep that change that the blood makes within your heart and within your life praise the name of the Living God hallelujah praise God now shall be stand to our faith faith and you may repeat after me because the question is what do we believe and who do we believe I know out there in the uh Church World they have the Apostles Creed but really that is not the real Apostles Creed because uh we do not stand on their lie of the trinity and three gods in one we believe one God expressing himself in three attributes offices is that right look I am a father I'm a son I'm a human being it doesn't make me treat people I'm the same person but those are my attributes those are my typos that I have that is how we believe amen so repeat after me I'll say it and then you repeat it aloud we believe in a revelation of one God the creator of Heaven and Earth get out we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ living in a human body Emmanuel God With Us we believe he was conceived by the spoken word that he suffered under Pontius Pilate was crucified dead and buried then rose again from the dead he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of power [Applause] and from there he is coming again [Applause] [Music] the judge broke the living and the dead foreign [Music] we believe in the Holy Spirit [Music] who lives in the true church we believe in the Forgiveness of sins we believe in the resurrection of the body and life Everlasting amen praise God God bless you please be seated you know while Jesus was here one of the last things he did he appeared to when he rose from the dead he appeared before the disciples in the little room and in that little room he spoke peace to their hearts because the first thing that words from his mouth that they heard was peace be unto you amen peace be unto you and I believe that communion or this time of communion with the Lord and with my fellow Believers is a good time for us to express and experience the peace of God within our hearts and within our lives amen praise God I believe it's also a good time for us to be able to forgive one another if there is anything to forgive but it's a wonderful time for us to forgive one another and let the Lord work within our lives I believe also it's a time we can use it as a time of restoration restoring relationships relation restoring friendships different situations that may be in our lives praise God so my friends I want to say like Jesus peace be unto you let me repeat it I want to say like he said when he walked into the little room he said Peace be unto you May the peace of God Rest remain and abide with you now and forevermore to his glory unto his praise amen now I want this to be an interactive service praise the Lord I want every one of you to participate in this service is that okay praise the Lord everybody so let's all stand right now and I want you each one of you to turn to your brother your sister or somebody you're free you're not stuck to the Pew you can get out of there and you can walk around that's okay uh we're here at home when you're in your house you don't sit in one chair and don't move from it you go and do whatever you have to do so that's what I'm telling you feel free to circulate move around and say peace be unto you to that individual or individuals as God puts it in your heart Hallelujah come on let's move around peace be under you peace peace wonderful peace coming down from the father above hallelujah oh May the peace of God rest and remain Among Us here today peace be unto you God bless you brother peace be to you brother Glenn peace be unto you sister peace the peace of God rest and remain with you and your family Hallelujah glory to God there is a river that flows from deep within there is a fountain that frees the heart from sin Hallelujah May the peace of God circulate move rest upon each one of us lifting away from us stress trial trouble and tribulation and freeing us to worship the name of the Living God peace be unto you sister peace the peace of God keep it in your heart brother God 's peace be with you and in you Hallelujah are you troubled are you tried may God's peace rest upon your soul I want to ask the elders that will be Distributing the elements to take their positions praise the Lord you please be seated now God bless you real good amen now we will have the Lord's Supper not right now but take your position here praise the Lord amen now we are not in a hurry are we this is a sacred time in the presence of the Lord so we we are not in a hurry that doesn't mean I'm going to keep you until later this afternoon I did not process a period of time that I'm going to do this in but I believe the Lord is in charge of that but it's certainly will be before or by one o'clock but we will do what we have to do if it finishes before then praise the Lord if it finishes right then amen wonderful praise the Lord as these stewards brings the emblems to the front and the elders are standing here in position it just reminds me of the elders that were by The Throne of God in heaven standing by throne and worshiping and honoring the lamb and giving Glory To His Marvelous and wonderful name I just love this this type of worship we're in the quietness and the Simplicity of this hour we can experience the love the Comfort the warmth and the presence of a not a dead God but a living God who works and moves among us to confirm the word that was given to us praise God and for this is why we are gathered to bring Glory praise and honor to his mighty name amen yes sir how I love him with all my heart praise God Amen now what we are going to do a little differently today is that I will the Lord will help me to bless the emblems that are before us they'll be on the table here before us and then what will happen is that the elders will go forth and serve you not both of them at the same time but the bread will be distributed first you will then hold that after which there'll be some remarks blessing and then the Elder with the wine will then go forth and distribute that of course they will need assistance and that means that that Elder will be going down this aisle and some assistant will be on the other side so that the plate can go back and forth on Hinder and as swiftly as possible okay is this being understood all right praise God and we we know that because uh this is not to be entered into lightly uh it's not to be entered into uh something frivolously this is not Coke and crackers this is the bread and wine has given to us by the Lord Jesus Christ and when I say Bread and Wine literal bread and real wine not grape juice or Pepsi or something like that but the real wine and there's a reason why he said that because he said I am the bread of life if a man eat of me he will live forever is that right we believe that now the wine with the stimulative effects is to represent the Holy Spirit who comes into our lives to Quicken us to a better life to an empowered life amen and to go forth amongst the people that are permeating influence that will stimulate their lives and cause them to want to live and walk with God so it is important also we must not take it lightly where you know that we must as Believers or as people we ought to be conscious of having a right relationship with God and with each other so as we come let us bear these things in mind that we our relationship is right but God you say well brother Simon I know I've done this last week or yes he says now even if that is the case let a man or a woman a person examine themselves uh you don't need me to come and examine you or ask you what you did you don't need to confess to me you need to confess in your heart to him and he knows all things so so we we don't take this lightly it's a supernatural uh operation of the Holy Spirit taking place even right now while we are gathered here together I'm just a representative standing here to be a voice for him that he may receive all the praise and honor and Glory and we are here to hear his voice and to obey his voice and for him to have his honor that is due to his wonderful and marvelous name oh praise God I want to make also clear to you uh many churches have closed communion and what that mean is only their members are allowed to partake or participate only people that they know are can participate but that is to say that we can judge who is right and who is not right who's living right and who is not living right that's not for me to do that's not for any man to do God knows the heart and he is the one that takes care of that as that is one of the main reasons why we have open communion the communion worship and service is open to all anyone but let me I say it you take it at your own risk for the Bible says if a man or a woman does not examine themselves and they because you can repent he says you repent you get rid of those things even instantly in his presence and go ahead and take the communion is that right but if the person rejects Rebels and does not want to uh receive the word of God he says that's the reason why many are sick and why many sleep that are amongst you because of unbelief and Rebellion against the word of God therefore let us be sure while I'm even talking while the service is in progress that we examine ourselves let me search our own hearts as the songwriter says search me o God and know my heart today oh praise God may God search your hearts mate we search our own hearts and ask the great Holy Spirit praise the Lord to search US cleanse us and make us into whom we should be you say oh but I've done this great sin I don't done well if you just take it lightly that's up to you but let me tell you there is no sin no wrong that is so great that God can't forgive and won't forgive Paul who killed Christians slaughtered them turned around and was was comforted and became a real believer and more than that made an apostle of the Living God Paul raised his hand to heaven and said oh Lord God I am the chief of sinners [Music] the chief of Sinners and yet God accepted him washed him cleansed him forgave him and brought him into his kingdom the same one who said Comfort one another with these words brethren we are not here for long because the Lord himself was promised he would descend with a shout the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God we which those that are dead will be raised up and we who are alive will be caught up in the presence of God in the twinkling of an eye there shall we forever be with the Lord do you believe it I believe it that is the reason why with the whole heart from my from 12 years old to this time amen and I'm not ashamed of my age to seven to seven I'm telling you this is real this is not a religious thought this is not a feeling but this is a reality that is within the heart of the True Believer he's coming again according to his promise this Bible amen blessed be the name of the Lord praise God hallelujah so I've made that clear that we have an open communion now now I will come and I will ask God's blessing upon the bread that is right here before Us Praise the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord thank you brother praise the Lord God bless you just to show you that it is real bread but because of our time I'm covering it again okay I want you to know that this is the bread and now this bread as I say as some believe that miraculously and mysteriously this bread turns into the body of Jesus now the scripture doesn't say that he says take it in remembrance of me the bread only represents his broken body his bruised bleeding and crucified body this is what this bread represents one man was testifying uh how that people were saying why do you take so long to take the Lord's Supper and he answered and said because when I take the bread and I start chewing it takes me about two three minutes to do that because it's not just chewing on the outside but I'm thinking on the inside and praying on the inside and thinking on the inside for what he has done for me through the broken bread as Isaiah said he was bruised for a or our transgressions amen he is the one that took on all our iniquities and by his stripes we are healed so we thank God for this and we give him praise honor and Glory so this is the bread given the Lord says it was broken for you not for him but it was broken for you and may God bless sanctify this bread here today let us pray are gracious and eternal God and Heavenly Father as we raise up before you this platter of bread broken for you we pray that the Holy Spirit of the Living God will his presence will come upon this blessed sanctify it use it father this emblem that you ordained use it for your glory and for your honor that you may even heal your Earthly body touch your people and bless them as we partake of this which you have given as our Elder now begins with some help to distribute this bread I ask you just to hold it and wait until the wine is distributed I'm going to ask the musicians to come up and play some appropriate music in the background while all this is going on you will be served also amen he was nailed to the cross for you me he was nailed to the cross for me on the cross crucified for me he died he was nailed to the cross for me do you think you can sing it if you can then hum it and then if you can't talk about it is that right praise the Lord he was nailed to the cross for me he was nailed till the cross for me on the cross crucifying for me he died he was nailed to the cross for me again he was nailed to the cross for me for me he was near till the cross for me on the cross crucified crucified [Music] for me he died he was nailed to the cross [Music] think about it [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] Saw the Light and the words of heart rolled away it was there by faith I received oh thank you Lord thank you Lord I am happy all the days thank you [Music] at the cross at the cross we're right first saw the light and my heart rolled away it was there by faith I received my sight and now I am happy all the days hallelujah know praise the name of the Living God hallelujah and in the same manner Jesus spoke about us taking the cup and here before me [Music] is the great emblem of the wine and we thank God for it it represents of course his precious blood and that blood as we set before represents the great Holy Spirit as we partake of this may be in our hearts be able to say Lord May the blood from your body cleanse my body cleanse my soul my spirit Set Me Free by the precious blood of Christ the Lamb of God who died for our sins oh praise God the dark day of Calvary up calvary's hill he went not for his sin for he was a lamb without Spartans and or blemish but for our sins that we may be washed clean white without spot or wrinkle washed and saved by the blood of the Lamb make as we partake a gracious father we ask thy blessing upon this wine that represents the blood that flowed freely from your body May the blood in the form of the Holy Spirit flow into our being and may we all be quickened here today quickened by your divine presence quickened by your love and grace in Jesus name amen and amen praise the Lord you may distribute now the wine will be distributed and you will receive it just hold that also and wait go ahead brother [Music] I first [Music] you can do that roll away it was there by faith I receive my sight now I am happy all the days [Music] was in for crimes that I have done he grown upon that tree I'll be thinking Grace I know and love oh why should he love me so [Music] that cross at the cross where I first saw the light [Music] burden of my heart roll away [Music] it was there by faith I receive my sight and now I am happy all the names hmm [Music] it was there by faith I received my sight oh God I'm sure every one of you here can testify I don't know whether it's incremental whether it was complete total whatever but somewhere your contact with this gospel this message this great Holy Spirit a change took place in your entire life and now you can't look back you're on a journey where there is no turning back maybe I'll keep pressing on in the presence of the Living God it's too late to turn back now
