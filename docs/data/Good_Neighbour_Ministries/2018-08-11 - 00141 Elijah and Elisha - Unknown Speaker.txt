bring the greetings from all the ministers I know up in Alberta and BC Saskatchewan and overseas from Africa her places we've been and Esther for God as people we're just happening with be with you thank you for the opportunity once again I think it's been three years since we've been here about three years so was getting to be a location wife was missing your family thank Tim also from the can sister Kelly hospitality putting up with us and putting us up working with a brother their pastors and the small work and things that are really starting to grow there and a real fight a man here when you're doing pioneering work I've learned he left he's a real soldier and a pioneer he's young man of yonkers of myself his wife they have no children after their believing for children and recently he his wife was diagnosed with cervical cancer and in part because they said they did some further tests on her in Kenya and said it's not cervical cancer it's tuberculosis now that's strange to me and when we heard it we thought well this is just a lot you know they don't know what it is we banded together we pray fast when we prayed with them and recently that shock of having that diagnosis sent her sister into a real depression and she began to lose her mind and she begin to act differently it's like her spirit had drifted because of that shock so they ended up putting Internet in a hospital and it was just not characteristic ever gone in in their home and I see how they live too sweet she was all the goodbyes open raised in the message different fates and all of sudden Richard month so he just got in front and prayed to believe that comma Hartman things got a little worse you know just before the devil gives up during it almost gets worse hunt and that spirit was just control of her so we kept hanging on we kept believing with him and supporting him and everybody could very expensive to go from Ethiopia to Kenya and hospitals all those things and finally just about two weeks ago she just come around [Applause] they're very happy now and they're spending some time together we can do before they could drink - is he under ministry there so you know he won't believe God's killing the moment he just been determined to get into life imagine and stop the work from going forth ten o'clock zeros there baptized of Pentecostal news for their brother at speaks five languages actually speaks Ethiopia and we're praying that God will give him a revelation of the message of the out of his people baptized him in a pool I think he wanted to try to do it secretly and we said well that's fine you know we could probably get a hotel we went to the hotel there's water what hinders us do you really believe this we went through the scripture again but he hesitated because of his church and his affiliation in their support so I have it off and then that day just everything seemed to come together we got in the pool and baptized the Lord Jesus Christ and I come up with him he looked it was a member of his congregation [Music] [Music] the other thing that's the Ethiopia is recently the government is cracked down one of the brothers should be Ghana that was also a mystery to us all the people he had to leave the country because the government which is mostly Orthodox the Orthodox Christianity there that's forty five percent and thirty three percent and then the problem is about ten percent but they're making inroads processes are many zeros so they want they want to surpass that you want to suppress that so it's a you have to be a doctor of theology you have to have a Theological Seminary certificate in order to be an established church so they're making it harder and the door is seemingly maybe closely but God willing the way others still just internment to depress on there even though the other brother have to go back now it will be and wonderful wonderful things God's doing there we the last time we were there about a young brother over Limpy the nannies and whatever camp of Mike Stewart from Edmonton miraculously young man feel free healing from cancer and that and he's totally free of that and he just has a wonderful testimony about that so he shared that with the Saints over there the Bobby Darin definitely sick and very very sick having that these he's a very slight band through a lot of things viruses and things before before that Trevor asked abscess on these teeth that has dutiful and just different things were were happening at very sick I have to really nurse it back to health and they couldn't go to the remote areas that we wanted to go so we had been up staying at this about the which is the Capitol and he because that happened we we set up meetings in this to the cattle and water than was ever possible with 46 graduating ministers Pentecostal bottles we came in to meet the head of the brother that takes care of it he's a doctor in divinity opportunity they called the doctor I thought he was a that's a lot of your doctor in theology all okay so so we got be said in love with any time to come in mister we've understood their little bit on the countdown and you know this age and what is expected for this ages it was just wonderful went to his home and it is home made the brain for a baby and they have heard that I pray for several other couples there and there's now three babies ever born [Applause] so anyway he heard of this beer in his coffee just treated us like kings and he said would you pray for my wife just be there beside a lot of them do our children and can't happen so I said I just said yes you know that would be fine I just would like that work with you and the Holy Spirit just said just move me to ask them because brother that had been witnessing to them I told them about the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so I just felt to ask him straightly if God will give you a child I said will you be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ as opposed to the neighborhood father son which he's a doctor that was a real challenge and they both agreed and then I asked them what what do you want I just got a text 2 weeks ago [Applause] I'm looking forward to see them began to speak for them so people you'll be and your prayers and missionaries and that missionaries sometimes are forgotten and you don't see them and they're not here and you know about their labor pray for the missionaries reminded when you consider myself I complain too much I gotta have my air conditioning for the car stretching all the way up and then so I want to share that with you respiration there so people just get right to work a little more great I notice all the hair changes and the body state agency but we hopefully were disclosure to the Lord to change amen I hope that's your desire this morning I want you to just pull on the word this morning as we go to the Lord in prayer we're going to turn to 2nd Kings chapter 2 for a scriptural story and we'll up dispute the Lord in prayer and how many have we found your presence Lord Jesus or the songs of silence on me I will touch my heartstrings with brother John find that song Lord Jesus used please Lord don't refuse me surely there's a work that I can do even if it's humble lord up by Milton from Lord heaven to problem today by the way you lead us how does that follow the Lord as Venus this morning Lord Jesus come forgive us of our sins from in this congregation that's before me anything that we've got our standard that we preach you in any way or to spoken a word of season from us for Earth cleanse us by thy blood this point Jesus though our being the bleeding word watch us this morning mother finds us from all these things we know to do right puppy don't do the thought many times Lord we're like that we're a human thought only from dead father come this morning Lord [Music] pleading for your never father may we always find ourselves in the house of the laughs follow you all the days of our lives miss we connect the service to you we commit our vessels to use us father use the gift each one that way the gift in the Saints to receive the word let's read from second kings and I want to take a little thought here this morning on a live chat and Elijah a man whose bride price of the proctor to says that he came to pass when the Lord would take up to heaven by our little buddy that Elijah went with Elijah from yoga and I just said to Elijah remember how the price in the rough Christ think of yourself as a life Terry here at preethi for the Lord has sent me to Bethany what is Bethel the house of God he's sending a backhoe and a large incentive has a Lord liveth and as I so liveth I'm not easy so they went down to Bethel and the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel a fourth to Elisha and said on the another step that the Lord will take away and he said they were going to happen so they came here with us so here he is a holder bees and I just set up in verse six Terry I pray thee here for the Lord he said let's see let's see where we've closed and yes this person and their logic took the banjo I wrapped it together and small the waters and they were divided here as ever so that they too went over on dry ground and it came to pass and what they were gone over and Elias ass what I shall do for thee now look at this now is he says ass work I do not come alert but a light which is plus power which was my lack of spirit is not the spirit of the man when is the Spirit of Christ the light come today is Lord Jesus Christ big event so he he says that's where I shall do unto you he did say listen thus saith the Lord it was like Jesus himself said very nice now talk to us what we say so I shall do for thee before I be taken away from me [Music] [Music] if they are CP when I take it from me it shall be so unto thee but if it if not if you see me if you if you stay with the message on the subject before I share a little bit with you on this as the Lord inspires me and it came to pass as they still when often top that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and parts of both the suckers and I like to went up by a whirlwind attack oh if he would just swing down near his money and then that was in caught in a whirlwind of Revelation in a whirlwind of his presence and here I just saw I like that yes sir Elijah thought the bride season she understands and he cried my father my father to share to this room that horsemen there up and he saw him no more and he took off on his own two pieces and he took up also the mantle of Elijah and fell on him and went back and stood by the Bank of Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said where is the Lord God of the night amen I like that statement and he also had spent when he also had spent the waters they party together and Elijah went over when the sons of the prophets which were to be with Jericho saw him they said the spirit of Abijah does rest on the life the Spirit of Christ that's our position and they came to meet him and bowed themselves to the ground before him and they said behold now there was fifty strong man let them go after thy master this question I like to send whatever you say no restrictions so you can only ask for that from the church [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] sometimes and it's very hard to control but Albarn how many one refill I just up while I was praying for rain but he wanted to take the picture Bible said let the rain fall and there was such a refreshing amen God has that Congress is why I give a gift to my father but I just want to be sensitive for the Holy Spirit this morning and and talking about this now the line is questioned and then there was a response from Elijah and then have that response you know I like to say that's a hard thing for adults peer that unfortunately sphere that maybe never had happened before but there's nothing [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you know the problem we'll just watch the church so these are the it's really separated [Music] this message has been accepted beyond the for you for youth and our students of the passage this morning and the terminal but we know that the Bible says that the pure light will use five we use five times a map so there's there's a student that's great five is great it had to be the spirit of logic at the end time so we see now that this question of faith there's been many questions yes so when Elijah prayed ask that question feel free in the end it is subconscious faith he knew something was telling him
