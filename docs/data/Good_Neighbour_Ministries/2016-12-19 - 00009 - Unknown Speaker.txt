this wedding supper of the lamb for course Lord bless us we pray as we think on these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen the Lord richly bless you every one of you who are here tonight listen to the two verses out of Matthew chapter two now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and I come to worship him praise God hallelujah God bless you please be seated amen praise the Lord as you know we're having service tonight in Li of upcoming uh Christmas day is going to be on Sunday itself and we know family is going to be families are going to be here and there and everywhere and occupied at that at that particular time and uh so we thought we'll have this service tonight amen and uh just Worship the Lord that way so that we can all do whatever we have to do praise the Lord amen uh let me make this comment too uh because I I was talking with somebody and they say oh no we um I'm I'm want to make sure that no matter what uh people have to come on Sunday and this and that I said well uh brother that's not the way I really uh see it uh I know that we even though Sunday is very important it's the resurrection of Lord and so on and so on yet um we understand that we're not under traditions and laws Paul said let no man judge you as the days and holy days and new wounds and and all these kinds of things uh if we just uh were going to just like uh you know upcon just like that then that's was a different matter but uh just so that you understand that we are doing this because it would be better uh for the church at this particular time even BR said you should be in church on Sunday but if you really have something to do you know some people have to do this or that if you're making an excuse you're going to but if you have to do this then you have to do it what else you going to do to build your house do whatever you have to do praise the Lord all right I just thought I'd make those comments because I I in case you meet some of those kinds of people that want to make those kinds of comments you'll know how to talk to them praise the Lord amen well we just read the scripture and simply told us that Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea and we we have touched on that telling you what Bethlehem was all about now uh uh I'm quoting brother BR then if he was born in Bethlehem and he is our Bethlehem then all true believing children of God are born in Bethlehem with him amen is that right praise the lord we are born in Bethlehem with him see then every one of the True Believers in Christ is born in Christ and they are born in God's Bethlehem I was born in Bethlehem you are born in Bethlehem right that's the way it is and anyone else can be born in God's Bethlehem God's true House of Bread of eternal life where you can sit and eat and live forever amen praise the Lord well wonderful that we can be born in Bethlehem but uh it's not so much talking only about Bethlehem back there because that's where Jesus was born when he came the first time and when he came the first time in flesh he was born in Bethlehem but he promised the son of man would be revealed again amen right again according to Luke he will be revealed again now understand that that doesn't mean that Jesus personally is going to come back with the flesh physical body that he had Back in the New Testament but he's coming back in the form of his bride amen and as he was the head of the body and just like how God first formed Adam and then afterwards he formed Eve he did the same thing in the new creation first the head came which is Jesus Christ amen which is the second Adam and then comes the church made out of the same material that Adam was made amen Amen brother said that in Christ is revealed in his own word also in Christ is the mystery of God revealed if he is the word then she to be the word amen because it's the same material that makes him he took a part of that to make heren praise God and so we are a part we are him she is actually him now being revealed amen the uning of the Mighty God is now taking place we sing the song God in flesh appearing oh come let but are you thinking what you're really singing It's not him appearing back there it's here he's appearing now in Simplicity in Bethlehem again in in a Manger who's the manger you're the manger I said he said a rotten stinking manger of sin but he is Born Again amen is that right he is born again in you and I born in Bethlehem once again so we want to praise God that at least my heart your heart could provide a resting place for the savior of this house amen and that we could be chosen elected and and placed positionally in the age as I as I was reading today brother Bron the word is alloted to every age a part of the word is alloted to every age a part of the enti church is made up of people called out of every one of these Church ages and each one of those ages had a promise a word is alloted to that age and you and I are a part of the word for the age in which we are called out of Amen because your name is a part of that word that's why you could be called out amen and so you are a part of that word that was alloted or predestinated to come up or appear or be made manifest in this age amen you could not come up in another age because this was the age where you were supposed to be a part of what God is doing amen because because he was now going to unveil the entire body because Through the Ages he was building the body starting coming up come back to Luther the whole thing was destroyed and then back in Luther he started with defeat come right up to to Wesley where he preach Holiness which is to get rid of the waste from the body and that's right there and we call this W too so and it goes right up until it came to the the age of Li amen where we have the Pentecostal but then he promised during the age of the Pentecostal he would send a prophet with the coming of the Prophet we enter the seeing age because he was a seer right a Seer is a seer of the word like Noah was a knower of the world you understand what I'm saying yes so he sees the word and recogniz it and so he he was uh there during the seeing age but the hour would come when God use him to do what restore the word restore the word of God bring back the word so what now that it could be blessed in the bride so all the word of God is in Christ amen and Christ is in the church amen and now the bride has the word and she knows what to do with the word because what the word is in the bride even as he said glory to God so the word in the bride makes her a word Bride for this hour to unveil God and to be a part of the anointed word glory to God you not just a denominational word amen out there but you are a part for the revealed word they got the Bible but you are the revealed word they got the written word but you are the revealed word they got the dead letter but you are the Living Word the word lives in you that's how we say oh I serve a living God Amen why because God is now in flesh that's what makes him a living God he lives in you and me praise the Lord because I live you shall live also so we don't serve on ID but serve a living God hallelujah and he lives in you and I he was born in Bethlehem oh praise God and to be born in Bethlehem is to be born into the world Amen born in the world praise God now um I've been to Israel many times and brother Bill here several in the congregation and when we get there sometimes uh uh we're taken on a trip to the West bank and in the West Bank is Bethlehem right and we will go to Bethlehem and they would show us supposedly in a great Cathedral there the spot and the it's the very spot they claim on which Jesus was born and they just leave a small opening where people can just go and fear down because it's more really was a cave right and uh and they put a star on the spot to Mark the spot where Jesus laid but we don't know if that's the exact spot where he laid but the fact is this time of year where we are with Christmas traditions that they have out there thousands of tourists millions of them pour into Israel and they are everywhere and and and to be honest it's not different than the than going over there and turn yourself into a right now you know what that is that's when a Muslim visits uh um Mecca then he's titled a hat right that's what he comes and this honored position and honored name to to know that you visit Mecca but the Christians are doing the same [Music] thing they're literally going on the pilgrimage that Bethlehem and think that's going to make them Hol I walked on the very spot where Jesus walked I was at the very tomb where Jesus Jesus was and they have to put a steel barrier because some of them want to rush in the Tomb and lay on the the on the place there where the body was right they have to put up a steel barrier like a gate and everything else to block them out because they have this idea it's going to make them whole here it's just as much as um well let me pass that but the fact is they're going on pilgrimages and preparing to go to pilgrimages right straight to Bethlehem but they failed to recognize Bethlehem of today little Bethlehem of today is not a city it's not a city but it's your soul Liv Bethlehem is your soul where God has now come as sinful as we are messed up as some of us are you know uh you know God has come and found a resting place within our hearts amen hallelujah oh praise God what is it what did David say he says my soul my soul has found a resting place upon thy altars oh God Amen praise God even the sparrow found the resting place upon thy altars oh God and he has found the resting place in our hearts amen and this is little Bethlehem that we have here today by the grace of God and we have again you and I and we visited by our savior amen I have a visitation from God Amen why do you think you see the word because the Lord himself has come to you and visited you that's right amen Christ the word is born in you again recognize the song we normally sing sometimes let the word be BN with my heart amen praise the Lord we sing the song about the word being born again within our hearts and that is exactly what's happening the time when he came to be born he had to use a Virgin by the name of Mary to be able to get the flesh into which him the great spirit could go into and live so that people can see him on the earth is that right amen and that flesh to come through a virgin amen so he was virgin born but when he comes this time because the woman being in the scripture called the weak of vessel we as Sinners we did not control virgin but he had to come and redeem us first amen that's right so that when you are redeemed Justified Sanctified the Holy Spirit can and come into redeem the Flesh in other words it's not flesh that the priest tells that him it's okay for you to come now but he has redeemed you himself is that right he has washed us what in his Precious Blood himself so he knows when you are washed When you clean never mind what anybody else says no matter why you little stumbled and there if he has washed you he says then you're all right amen praise the Lord and now he comes in and he fills you with himself and he is the word praise the Lord I'm filled with the word you are filled with the word and the word Quicken is the Holy Spirit Wine I mean gra juice quick it it it it has it becomes Spirits right it becomes liquor and it has a kick to it it it has something that will make you move is that right glory to God but the thing about him he didn't even need gra juice he turned the water into wine is that right and that he was just showing that he's going to take the water of the word and pour it into you and I cuz that's typ the symbol of the man with the water Po in the Zodiac that's what it was it was that age where you pour the water of the word right into every one of us praise God and pour him and then turn that water into wine when you c a revelation the word that you've been reading and hearing even for years even the message that you've been following for years all of a sudden something clicks SP and there you go the water that was in you turn into wine and you feel an Impulse within your heart you feel aescent something pushing a a a pull a movement going on inside of Praise the Lord hallelujah oh praise God forever more God himself Anointed The Most Holy place that he might come and dwell in there like when he came down when Solomon prayed the purifying smoke came down because what God himself anointed that Holy place in which he was going to come and he offered a tabernacle glory to God and that's why you here anointed by the Holy Spirit anointed by the word of God Amen to receive him the savior of the world within the heart this is Christmas oh yes this is Christmas amen I want to see out there this is Christmas to bece in Heavenly places in Jesus Christ and recognizing your day your hour your father your lord your master wonderful com might God and everlasting father Prince of Peace that's really Christmas with your heart but they made it something else until this seems like nothing and that seems like a wonderful thing and it's great out there but they have to drink liquor to get in the state that we in amen is that right praise the lord we voluntarily coming here and we say oh come let us adore him or we sing oh little town of Bethlehem how still we see the oh my God some of them never sang some of those songs all year but you see when they drink and my name is John but I don't make whiskey John walk whiskey or they drink some other label and and and start to get into their bloodstream whatever go all of a sudden they get religious you ever noticed that when these drunk people start to get drunk they start to get religious and all of a sudden they're singing HS man never Su all year but now Christmas time singing H and all of a sudden NE by be by G forget everything whatever in this drunken State when it comes to the liquor worn off after the few the one week binge once it wear off he's back to AR and fight with his neighbor again and he repeats that cycle wait till the next Christmas again and then he goes back in the same state where he loves everybody because the influence of the drinks are upon him we don't have to wait for that we have the Holy Spirit that taught us to love our brothers our sisters our mother our father we we have the Holy Spirit that stimulates us every day praise the Lord if you stimulated I am amen amen glory to God hallelujah oh yes God's bread was born there in Bethlehem now being born in Christ we are then born of God in Bethlehem in Christ Jesus now sitting together in Heavenly places eating of he himself amen eating of him and who is he that we are eating we are eating the word that is the reason why he said except the man eat my flesh and drink my blood but they didn't understand it said this man is making us a but he was talking about them getting to understand or catch a revelation of the word that he was teaching them and they ought to Feast on that word and receive the Holy Spirit the quitting power within their hearts and life but they walked away from him because they didn't understand they thought he was telling them to drink literal blood and and to and to begin gwing on his bones and eat his flesh like that as Cannibal and the Bible says that uh around 580 of them because he had a lot of disciples other the first and second P walked away from him amen they walked right away from him you know that 580 of them left them left him because only 120 were in the Upp room amen and you'll find in the gospel it actually mentions the number that he had about 500 disciples at one time praise the Lord so here it is brothers that we are talking about little Bly hand you can only sit with one objective here the word of God and we are here to feed upon the word of God in God's spiritual Bethlehem eating God's spiritual bread that he gave us amen amen and we are enjoying this heaven angel food praise God this is Christmas you're eating Angel's food Hallelujah you know why can I say that because even Paul said that we are receiving things which even the angels were not permitted to look into can you imagine that the Angels were not permitted to look into this and God is breaking the seals to human beings God is opening your understanding to the word of God and you recognizing him why because it's between husband and wife amen and he is revealing to her it's for her it's not for the angels for her amen and revealed to her praise Goden a preach mess that many years ago how could you reveal it to them because they were never lost so they don't know what it is to be Sav amen they don't know what it is to be saved praise the Lord and they are servants we are Sons and Daughters amen they don't want to be a and a daughter they just know what it is to be a messenger in a servant so so those things could be revealed to them it had to be revealed to us amen because we are his children we are his wife praise the Lord and reveals the word of God to us amen how many of you brother bras in this hour in this season that we're living in are willing to forget your Traditions how many is willing to forget all them creeds amen that disagrees with the word all the all the people are worshiping under the way they are celebrating Christmas Xmas whatever they want to call it it's under the influence of creams it's under the influence of tradition I mean you know by now that these things are um where you have Listen to In the bible where you hear old ten you Wasing the tree and they got you was in the tree and you don't know ten bar means Christmas tree Christmas sing the tree right and you don't know what you're singing so that's why talk to you la too because you don't understand whatever they say you take it and you oh it's deep go but then the devil could be cursing you in Latin and you wouldn't even know could be swearing that you in Latin you wouldn't even know anything because you don't know so he got you singing old Tenon Canon and you singing about that washing in the tree which Jeremiah prophesied that the day will come when they're going to cut a tree from the forest and they going to put two pieces of wood Crossways nail the tree and the wood so that the the tree can stand up straight then he said they deck it with lights properly speaking from way back there and put all excuse me said all kinds of shiny things he saw on the street and they they worshiping the tree and behold that is the case what's going on right now glory to God a nothing wrong with you having a Christmas tree as long as you know it's just a tree amen it's nothing it don't mean nothing but if you even have the tree and you are ignorant of what it really represents it's just like me going to Africa and going go down and just buy one of those mask and go to India and buy one of The Masks of one of those gods or or China where they have those dragon mask buy one and put it in your house and you don't even know that some the witch doctors use those masks so they could call down the devil amen because they saw that demon in their vision and then they carve The Mask according to what they see so that they can ATT trct the devil to come on them and then speak through them and manifest himself through them and that's what they do so so these people I'm saying that these people without Revelation don't know how dangerous they're going and they're doing these things and calling down those kinds of spirits on them not recognizing what they're doing because the devil bring them into a religious atmosphere amen so they think it's all right because they're in a religious atmosphere the devil is religious himself fact he believes God more than many people do because Bible says the devil believes enough to tr some of them have enough Faith to even fear God with the stuff they're saying and how they're doubting you can't tell there is no God he will tell you to say there is no God but he will not tell you that there is no God because he knows there is a God and have to answer to that God when he comes to the End Amen that's why he always every time Jesus comes come to Tor me before the time so he know there's a Time Com when going be tormented and Fire is that right so so we know that so here we are looking at the word now forget the Traditions forget them treats and darkness why why haven't we got a Revival why haven't we got all them things of God going on what's the matter with Pentecost it's because they have organized themselves amen see you can't organize the true Pentecost amen you cannot make an organization of the true Pentecost because Pentecost is a blessing you believe that he said Pentecost is the power of God and if it is the genuine genuine pente it will never ever bypass the word for agreed amen praise the Lord so right away if you say oh I'm Pentecostal but you believe in Trinity then you're not genuine absolutely why there come a lot of false prophets all you think is a one man when the one man comes and just prophesy that's said the Lord that's the false prophet or or let's say I'm not calling him that but let's say benan or somebody like that you might say oh that's a false prophet no it's any body that goes contrary to the word amen is that right cuz a prophet is one who speaks from God testifies for God and when you testify wrong and on one hand you're getting miracles signs wonders healings and people falling on the ground claiming they have the Holy Spirit and then you turn around and you're talking about the Blessed Trinity and you're talking about three persons in one God then in Act fact you're a false prophet amen performing lying wonders amen you're a false prophet because you're speaking the word but the word of God you're speaking is false Doctrine and secondly the Wonders shall perform when a sign or a wonder is performed like brother said it's supposed to point to Christ amen you not to believe signs only is not not just the sign you to follow after but the sign should be pointing to Christ any sign board Point somewhere you don't sit on the sign post and think you have arrived because it says the way to London and and and points that way you sit at the sign post and say oh I right in l no you're not in L you got to follow go where the sign points to and if the sign is pointing in a wrong direction because some devil moved then uh if it's a lying sign see so if they on one hand they're getting healings wonders Mir but at the same time they're getting these signs but the same time they're telling you uh the Blessed Trinity and baptism is in the ti of Father Son and Holy Ghost you know that's a light one because it's pointing in the wrong direction when it should be pointing to Christ that Israel the Lord thy God is one Lord amen praise the Lord hallelujah oh yes sir a genuine Pentecost will but will never ever bypass the word and take a Creed it will always take the word amen amen so we are we are in Bethlehem candidates for the kingdom of God and we are feasting on the word and grow GR in eternal life amen praise the Lord eternal life is in you but you're growing into it you're getting used to it now you're getting climatized you get pressurized as you mooved right into this eternal life that God has given you amen see Bethlehem is the center of God's bread amen but it was also see is also the place of water water for the journey just like Israel had water praise the Lord they Israel have a sitten rock but now we have the word The Rock follow them the word is with us every step that we take amen amen see we have byass treed and drinking and bypass drinking stack making water from Sister Hallelujah and now we have come the drink as the opening of the world Amen so it's not the rock that sitten and opened up but now it's the word that's opened up to usen and out of the word is coming what Waters of eternal life that there is water for natural life but this is the Waters of eternal life it's coming right out of the world hallelujah amen yes sir so by doing that the scripture there is open the found in the House of David glory to God and that Fountain is open in the House of David here again today by the grace of God not water B bashing from a fountain there but a fountain here praise God David said I looked I saw a river with streams that make glind the city of God hallelujah I believe that's right out of him it comes right out of him and when it gets in you what did he say out of your vales well FL rivers of Living Waters that will make other people around you be blessed by the word that comes out of your mouth hallelujah praise God hallelujah amen yes sir listen this is not just me saying that but he said this is the fountain in the House of David again glory to God founded in the House of David again we are back in Bethlehem again where we can say Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen praise God Hallelujah to have give us lifegiving Journey for our lifegiving journey praise the Lord from Earth to glory for our lifegiving journey think about it that the seals are open is not that simple but uh I'm not going to hold you uh too long tonight but Genesis 26 if you want to write it read uh write it down and read it at home Genesis 26 from: 12- 25 it outlines the story of Isaac and how Isaac went back to wear Abraham was and when he was there the Bible says in Genesis 26 that he found Abraham had dug some wells now not all the types we know that you got them Church ages up there but uh Abraham had dug a bunch of wells and those Wells uh made him wealthy and was crushing with water water was always there but when uh Isaac got back there he found that the Philistines were so envious of him being Abraham's son that they stopped up the the wells they threw garbage they threw all kinds of rubbish and everything else inside of those wells until the wells were contaminated and stopped up and for years those Wells were like that because they wanted to block Isaac from getting to fresh water they blocked you I from getting to fresh water is that right but the Bible tells us that Isaac took his servants and he unstuck the wells amen hallelujah unplugged everything else and open them up so that the waters could flow again that is what the Lord Jesus Christ did for us for the opening of The Seven Seals he unsto every one of the wells so that the truth of the revealed word could flow down to us and a fountain is once again open in the House of David glory to God hallelujah oh my can you remember David how David was a fugitive one time and actually we were taken to that cave where David uh could have killed Saul and at the same time the guy was telling us he says from where where David was here you see uh right over the mountains and he showed us you have to climb over a high mountain not these Hills that we call mountains a real mountain he said it's about 18 miles to the other side to Bethlehem if if you wanted to really walk there you talking about ruged country brother there's no highways or nothing like that it's ruged country and hot sun and you know David being a fugitive from his own people a type of Christ he's a fugitive got to run from these churches because they will attack him at any time you bring them the word they attack the word you tell them the truth they attack the truth you try to open the word to show them something as long as they see him they want attack him so he's a fugitive from his own came to his own they received him not but as many as received them to them gave he the power to become the sons of God glory to God so David The Fugitive Christ The Fugitive knocking on the doors of his own church to get in to his own church and they won't let him in and he's a f fugitive going everywhere searching for a welcome heart that would receive him that he could place his word in there praise God but there was David and brother BR said David as a fugitive running he says hot hungry thirsty and he said David must have stopped and started to think of when he was young and uh would bring his father's sheep to the Wells of Bethlehem and how he would just rush to that uh well and drink the fresh clear clean cool water he said all the very s of it made David desired to have a drink of water from Bethlehem and uh in passing you know he just briefly said oh I wish I could get some of that cool fresh water from Bethlehem now brother Bram said but he didn't realize to his men that were with him brave men men of renown one of them jumped into a pit on a snowy day where a lion was trapped and went to there and fought the line and killed it man like that that were Brave he said when David spoke he just said oh you know I wish I could get a drink of water from that from Bethlehem again he said but he didn't realize his wish was their command amen and the Lord's wish is our Command is that right Hallelujah he didn't notice it but some of those men slipped away and when they slipped away they climbed over those mountains but brother Bron said it wasn't just walking up rugged mountains he said the Philistines were there and they fought their way 14 to 18 miles through the enemy back to back so the enemy can't get at them go down got the water put it in the you know the car it in skins if they T it on their back or their waist I don't know he says and he said the first time they might surprise them but the second time the Philistines know they're coming back and they're waiting for them praise the Lord and we are that group now because they had the first manic lost and that kind of shocked them but now know about us we coming the last Church AG now and the devil knows about us and destroying everything at amen some of you see K you back go your head he destroy everything he can at you because he knows now the church is coming back the bride is coming back oh glory to God and the Bible tells us despite the Philistines knowing that those men Drew their sword time for the reveal word and and CH their way through 18 miles of Philistines why because what brother brother Don rean preach a great message if you ever could get it off the site uh a drink for the king they brought back just one drink for the king glory to God hallelujah just so the king can have a drink glory to God God is Ling to see a lot of church rise up am a lot of people rise up amen in the power of the Holy Spirit yes Lord that can recognize their day and their hour and make the word manifested so that the public can know that we serve a living God that he's not dead but is alive forever more and it's not just some Spirit floing around but if he gets a body that can use that somebody that can surrender and let go and have his way that God will flow through them and work through them for his glory in other words we have to bring to them the reality that God lives that the Lord Jesus Christ lives and if he lives in nobody else he lives in me he lives in you and you must let the world know that that he lives in me praise be to God hallelujah how wonderful think about it we need man today like that see man that have an experience with god oh oh man who who's got experience not just knowledge so a lot of people got knowledge they know the message they know everything else but they never the devil they never they never had Supernatural experiences they can talk about the supernatural experiences brother bradam had but they had Supernatural experiences of their own to know God Amen praise the name of the Lord and that is what that devil was telling them sons of yeah Paul we know amen the spirit real Paul come against us G many times we know Paul Paul we know Jesus we know but who are you right you you you don't have no reputation in hell we not scared of you because we never even heard your name so that's where this is at brother sister that you've got to ask God to move in your life until the water becomes wine and you have not only a belief in your head but you have an experience with in your life when you meet God face to face and the Lord allow you to meet challenges by Devils by all kinds of stuff and overcome them and recognize my God is real he's real in my soul my God is real for he has washed and bl from many his love for me oh it's like pure gold amen my God is real or he lives way down in my soul think about David the type of Christ crying for a drink of fresh water think about it those men chop their way right through there now think about it Christ here is represented both in David and in those men I've never seen this he said he is represented here as both King and Warrior because he cut his way through and broke through the Enemy Lines of death to bring us the Waters of eternal life for today is all right glory to God he bust through the enemies praise God to bring us the Waters of eternal life for today that we could drink glory to God hallelujah think about it now we didn't conquer anything he already conquered
