I've been praying. I know I have to stand here and that's my responsibility to pray, but I've been praying and I know that the spirit of God is here in our midst. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I am excited this morning because, you know, it's one of those messages where God changed it again. Amen. And uh he always, you know, when he does that, it's always something special for somebody. I hope more than some one person. Amen. That's what a a minister always hopes that it's more than one person. Hallelujah. But if we're walking with him, you you you just can't come into a a building, a church, and you know, we got to walk with him every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's every day. It's a life. Amen. That he wants. And that's what the word has declared in this hour. He wants to live. In that day, you'll know that I'm in the father, the father, and me. I in you, and you in me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, we we praise the Lord for that. Amen. God bless you all. Go. God bless you, brother Simon. Good to see you. Amen. Hallelujah. I don't get nervous. I get I get blessed when brother Simon was always there when I'm ministering the word of God. Amen. Because I know there's faith. Hallelujah. And that's what we want. We want faith this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that we can not only get the minister out of the way, but get you out of the way so the Holy Spirit can speak to you. Our pastor Danny, sister Jennifer, we were with them this week. They send their greeting and their love and they'll be back next week. Amen. Continue to remember brother Chris and sister Freda. They're heading out for a few months to do what God wants them to do in Trinidad. So, let us continue to remember. Let us pray one for another. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible has uh commanded us. And I believe the spirit of God moves us to pray one for another, even more as you see that day approaching. Hallelujah. The day is getting more evil and evil. Let's pray for one another. Amen. Hallelujah. God bless you. Let us turn to the word. Amen. I want to title this this morning. Hallelujah. The seventh seal revealed sets us free indeed. Hallelujah. Free has been on my mind and free has been in my fellowships with the brethren and and and and and just being set free. Hallelujah. I don't know which way it's going to go this morning. Hallelujah. But we trust the Holy Spirit. He knows. Hallelujah. So, let us turn to the scriptures. Romans 6:4. Let us have a good time in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Set me at liberty up here. Amen. Set me at liberty. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Romans 6:4. Therefore, we are buried with him by baptism into death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Knowing this, that our old man is crucified this morning &gt;&gt; with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. For he that is dead is freed from sin. Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him. &gt;&gt; That's now. Hallelujah. Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more. Hallelujah. He's alive and well. &gt;&gt; Death had no dominion over him. For in that he died, he died unto sin once. is paid already, my brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's It's about coming to recognize that we are free. &gt;&gt; Sin is paid for. &gt;&gt; Oh God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When the sons and daughters of God are set at that liberty by faith. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. The word of God is bringing her to that. Amen. But in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye yourself to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God, &gt;&gt; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal bodies. That ye should obey it in the lust. Hallelujah. Don't let it rain. You got the power. You got the birth. You got the Holy Ghost. You got everything that God has given you. Amen. To not let it rain. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Therefore, neither yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin, but yield yourself unto God, as those that are alive from the dead. Oh, I know I'm alive from the dead. Amen. I know I was dead. That's all I know. I know I was dead in sin. Amen. But I know I'm alive this morning. &gt;&gt; I'm alive in him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Thank you, Lord. Amen. I'm just going to have a good time. Amen. And your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. For sin shall not have dominion over you. I'm declaring that this morning. Sin shall not have dominion over you. For ye are not under the law, but under grace. &gt;&gt; What then? Shall we sin? Because we are not under the law, but under grace. God forbid. Know ye not that to whom you yield your servants, yourselves servants to obey, his servants, ye are to whom you obey, whether sin unto death or obedience unto righteousness. Hallelujah. Let us turn to John 8:31. I know these are long scriptures, but there's so much in here. Hallelujah. The word says it better than any man could ever say it. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. John 8:31. Oh, glory to God. Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, if you continue in my word, then you are my disciples indeed, and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." They answered him, "We be Abraham's seed, and we are never in bondage to any man. How sayest thou, ye shall be made free? Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, whosoever committh sin is the servant of sin." They didn't understand. We're going to get into it, but they didn't understand what sin was. And the servant abideth not in the house forever, but the son abideth forever. If the Son therefore shall make you free, you shall be free indeed &gt;&gt; in all things. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I know that ye are Abraham's seed, but you seek to kill me. What? The revealed word. &gt;&gt; They seek to kill the revealed word, and they still do it that same spirit today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. because my word had no place in you. I speak that which I have seen of my father and ye do that which you have seen of your father. They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Oh, listen closely. Put on your spiritual thinking caps. Amen. I love it when somebody comes to me afterwards said, "Brother, when you made that statement, this this open up that open up that open up. That shows that you're in the spirit. Hallelujah. Oh God. Jesus said unto them, "If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham. But now you seek to kill me, a man that had told you the truth which I heard of God. This did not Abraham. Yay, do the deeds of your father." Then said they to him, "We be not born of fornication. We have one father, even God." Oh my. Jesus said unto them, "If God were your father, ye would love me. For I proceed forth and came from God. Neither came I of myself, but he but he sent me." Oh my, so much in there. Let us pray. Father, we thank you, Lord, that we can stand here this morning, Father, washed in the precious blood. Lord, we are on a journey, Father. A journey of perfect faith. A journey that you started, the plan of redemption coming to an end, Lord. And here we are this morning, Father, Lord, asking for you to come and speak to your children, and do what you need to do, Father. For you said, "My word has gone forth not only this morning, but it has gone forth through a prophet, and it will accomplish what it's set forth to do. It will not return to you void, Father. And you have spoken a bride without spot or wrinkle. You spoken a bride with perfect faith, total deliverance. Lord, you spoken free indeed. Father, we are free this morning, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh God, let us see the light. Let us see the light, Lord, that we may recognize our freedom this morning. Even if it's just one area of bondage, Lord, &gt;&gt; one area where we're we're we're chained up. Father, &gt;&gt; open those prison doors this morning. &gt;&gt; Your prophet cried out to a brother and said, "Brother, God is setting his people free. &gt;&gt; He's opening the prison doors and he's setting the captives free. You're the same yesterday, today, and forever. Lord, come Holy Spirit and set your people free. Father. &gt;&gt; Oh, grant it, Lord. &gt;&gt; We lift you up on high, Father. &gt;&gt; Bless each one, heal each one, deliver each one. May we enter into that tent, Lord, which I believe we are in that tent now. And Lord, may we believe when we walk out of these doors, something has changed. Amen. God bless you, saints, as you're seated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What is sin in the visible union of the bride of Christ? I'm going to read a few quotes here. What is sin? Sin is unbelief. Amen. That changes everything. That changes the perspective of our minds in this hour. Hallelujah. When we interpret the word of God, when we look into the word and read the word. Amen. So many people say and so many times the devil condemns people on their on their actions or or on their behaviors. Smoking, drinking, lying, all these things. Amen. But that's not sin, my brothers and sisters. Hallelujah. We got to come a little bit higher and see what sin really is. &gt;&gt; Sin is unbelief in what? The word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That is greater than anything. You can hide behind religion. You can you religion is a a covering. You can hide behind the message. You can be hide behind all your quotes that you quote in your scriptures. Amen. But sin is unbelief in the revealed word of this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Disbelieving what God has spoken about you. Amen. Disbelieving that God has promised things in this hour. You know, let me say it, my brothers and sisters, not outwardly because nobody would say it outwardly. Amen. But God exposes everything. There are people today and the scripture says, "Where is his coming? Why is he delaying his coming?" Hallelujah. There are people, amen, that are disbelieving in the rapture today. Disbelieving that God is able to change these bodies. Amen. Hallelujah. If that's what sin and unbelief is. Amen. You got to get to a place with him by revelation that you recognize the difference between your flesh &gt;&gt; and your soul. If you do not get there, amen, this flesh will have you in unbelief. Amen. Hallelujah. That seed of God inside of you has got to be awakened. And when it's awakened, that's what we call the new birth. Hallelujah. That's your life. That's your salvation. That's what saves you is the new birth. Amen. Not because you came to an altar. Not because you confessed something with your mouth or testified. Amen. Not because signs and wonders worked through your life. Amen. You can have all those things. Brother Brandham says you can be anointed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day of your life and still go to hell. &gt;&gt; It's the word that brings forth the life inside of us, the new birth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. The word unbelief in God which is the word. Brother Brand is speaking here 10 virgins and 144,000 Jews. See the trumpet sounded and he can go free. It's God's grace. It's the year of Jubilee that completion. Hallelujah. The day now listen. The day of sin is over, brother. &gt;&gt; That's what he's saying. It's over. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, God. What's going to bring this rapture on? What's going to bring this perfect faith on? Oh my. Glory to God. I tell every one of you serving sin on the tapes or visible audience, everyone that is serving sin, the day of sin is over. Jesus died. You don't have to serve sin anymore. Hallelujah. What is sin? Amen. You don't have to bow down to the creeds or denominations or the dogmas or the traditions. You don't have to bow down in fact to anything anymore that this world that this flesh has to offer you. Amen. Hallelujah. He who the son of man has made free is free indeed. If you want to go free and be free in the sun, cut loose from all things and serve him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's called surrender. It's called cutting loose. Amen. You know, the Holy Spirit, the preacher can preach words, but the Holy Spirit speaks to his sons and daughters. Hallelujah. He speaks all this that still small voice into your heart. Amen. And I'm telling you, each and every one of us that are walking with him, you hear that voice saying, "Cut loose." Hallelujah. He's revealing things to you. How can I overcome? How can you overcome? Amen. By the one who's already overcome. Amen. He's the one inside of me. He's the one inside of you that is overcoming this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's setting you free this morning. Amen. When he reveals his word to you, when he speaks into your heart, amen, when he shows you things to come into your life and he exposes sin, he exposes darkness. Like, like David said, Lord, if there be any evil inside of me, take it out of me. God will expose everything in our lives. What? To set you free. Amen. And sometimes we stay right in our sin. Sometimes we stay right in our unbelief because it is unbelief. Because when the word of God reveals to you, Amen. And you don't step out by faith and obey and believe that word of God, it becomes sin to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And sin has a penalty, a punishment behind it. Now, if you're a son and daughter of God, hallelujah, you're going to learn a lesson. And you're going to learn it real good. But you're going to learn it. Amen. Hallelujah. Because the seed inside of you cannot sin. But if you don't want to, then your organization, your master, what is your organization? See, we we read this and we think is that is is the churches out there is your master. Whoever you serving will put a mark on your ear and you won't be able to hear it anymore. If God ever speaks to your heart, come. Let me repeat that. If God ever speaks to your heart, come. This is the time. And for you to refuse it, then you receive his mark hardening from the truth, the revealed truth, the present truth of this hour. You know, you look at that and you you think of them out there not receiving the message, my brothers and sisters. Hallelujah. But there's a revealed word in the message. There's there's a written word in the message. There's an unwritten word in the message. Amen. Hallelujah. And God is speaking to the people in the message. Amen. Hallelujah. And revealing truth to them. This very scripture is taking place right today in the message. Remember, it has to be that way in order for the scriptures to be fulfilled. Amen. It has to come to pass, my brothers and sisters. It came to pass, like I always said, in Jesus's life. It came to pass in brother Brandham's life. It has to come to pass in the bride. Hallelujah. Amen. What does the mark of the beast do? Puts you right back into Romanism, denominationalism in your mind. And you'll never come to in and be free. You will serve that forever. That's the mark of the beast. That's hard, friends. That's cutting. But that's what I'm I'm not responsible for just what the Bible says, what the truth says. Amen. Hallelujah. You see, my brothers and sisters, when the Pharisees responded to Jesus and said, "We're not in bondage. We are Abraham's seed." They didn't understand that Jesus came to set them free from unbelief, sin. They were bound by the law, by the flesh, by the carnal nature which is at emity against God. The flesh and the carnal mind is an enemy of the spirit of God. Jesus come by the new birth through the cross to set us free from that unbelief. You see, they didn't understand. They were looking back at the law of who? Moses. Moses is who? the prophet following that law, creating traditions, creating their own interpretations of what? That law, what? Moses's message. And here come Jesus. Amen. Saying, hallelujah, you need to be set free from your sin. And here they are saying, we're not in bondage. We're Abraham's seed because the law says so. We follow the prophet Moses. We believe the message. We say what he says. &gt;&gt; That's repeating the law. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what they were doing. They were saying what the prophet said, saying what the tapes say and believing that they were in sin, not recognizing that same blindness is here today, my brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; And God wants to deliver his true children. Amen. &gt;&gt; This word got to be preached in such a way that you can see the false anointed, the false ones at the end time &gt;&gt; so you can receive the true word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Oh my brothers, sisters, this stirs on my heart because this is what I see. This is what God's opened my eyes to see. Hallelujah. This is the greatest gospel, the greatest message, the greatest freedom that you could ever have. Hallelujah. Amen. The greatest unbelief. Hallelujah. Our flesh, this carnal mind. And the because the Pharisees did not see that they they all can see was the law. All they can see was the law. That they were obeying the law. They could not be set free and born again. You know, that's the way it is today. The devil has deceived and lied to people in this message because you believe God sent a prophet because your intellectual education could understand the Bible or understand the prophet. Amen. Hallelujah. The devil works in all different kind of ways of deception and tells people when they're truly born again that you're not born again. And tell people that are not born again that you're born again. Oh yes. Hallelujah. Oh yes. By experience. I've got experiences with the Lord. You can have experience after experience. Amen. You can have the gifts manifested in your life and operating in your life. You can have all these things and still not be born again. Brother Van preached the message. Be certain of God. Hallelujah. I'm not here to tickle your ears. I'm not here to pat you on the back and say that you got the Holy Ghost and that you're born again. I'm here to tell you the truth. It's for you and God to know for yourself. Amen. for you to be certain of God and who you are that you're born again &gt;&gt; because this is a leosian church age. It's lukewarm. It's lazy. Amen. Satan is cooling down the church in the messages today. Cooling down the people from driving, from being persevering, from being desperate. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a desperate time. This is between life and death. My brothers and sisters, oh, I love to preach a a good uplifting message to you all. Oh, to encourage you and strengthen you and pat you on the back. Hallelujah. But life and death stands before us. &gt;&gt; And I can't stand before God. Amen. And stand here if I don't preach the truth &gt;&gt; that this is taking place. If he's opened my eyes, he opened a minister of the eyes. I'm not going to stand there. Amen. Hallelujah. and say, "You're okay. I'm going to preach against sin." Amen. If I'm the last one standing, which I don't believe I will be, I'll preach against sin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He has set us free. &gt;&gt; He has set us free. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Who the son of man has set free is free indeed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Those who see, those who understand this morning, those who recognize, oh God, will rejoice, &gt;&gt; will rejoice. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because there's something inside of them. They know they've been set free. Hallelujah. They know they're forgiven. They know they're washed and cleansed. They know God, the attribute of God lives inside of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; What's going to move this church in the power of the resurrection? Amen. In the quickening power, what's going to take the dynamics? Amen. Hallelujah. The mechanics and put the dynamics on it, man. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, when she recognizes, when she recognizes who she is, &gt;&gt; she recognizes who he is and what he's done. Amen. That's what he's done. Amen. He has risen me from the dead. He has risen you from the dead. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're born again. &gt;&gt; You got the resurrected power of God inside of you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The spirit of truth has come. &gt;&gt; It's him that's been guiding you. It's him that's been speaking to you. It's him inside of you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When that consciousness becomes a reality in your life, amen. and it possesses you. It It takes over your life. Hallelujah. Then you become anointed one. Hallelujah. Amen. Not a false anointed, but the anointed of God in these last days. Oh my. Amen. today because believers are blind to the fact that they need to be set free from this carnal nature and the flesh because they follow the letter of the message of the Bible and may even have a lot of experiences and the devil can produce every experience that the spirit of God can give you but he cannot produce the new birth. He can he can impersonate everything. Amen. everything, my brothers and sisters. Hallelujah. Brother Brandham has seen that woman walking. Amen. Justified, sanctified, baptism of the Holy Ghost, the gifts manifested through her life, seeing her walking right down the line, and then boom, fell right into the pits of hell. Hallelujah. Why? Because she rejected the word for her day. &gt;&gt; Amen. She rejected it in her life. Where do you reject it? You might say, "Brother, I believe it." Oh, I believe it. I believe God sent a prophet. I believe what you're saying. Amen. Hallelujah. Then go out. Brother Brandon said, "It's not good enough just to agree with the message. It's not just good enough to fellowship around the message." Amen. &gt;&gt; But become the message. &gt;&gt; There's a different story when you become the message. When you have to die to yourself, &gt;&gt; you have to surrender your life to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But not in part. You got to open every door of your heart. You got to open your spirit. You got to open your mind. &gt;&gt; You got to open yourself to the word that the word can come in and do the work that it needs to do. &gt;&gt; It needs to cast out devils. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. I say that cuz I know God has cast out devils out of me. And I'm telling you this morning, God needs to cast out devils. He needs to cast out unbelief. He needs to cast out traditions. He needs to cast out your culture, your way you think, the way you do things, the way you act. He wants to change you completely. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Sometimes he's got to shake you to the core. &gt;&gt; Yes, he got to shake you to the core. Amen. If you walk out here wondering if you're born again or not, that's good. That's good. Hallelujah. Because that's going to get you on your knees. that's going to say, "Lord God, Lord, take my life." Amen. What is this message? What is this word of God? What are we doing? What is this this morning? Why are we here? Are we coming because of a building that that is a tradition of church? We're coming to hear the word of God. Amen. To make you feel religious and good and walk out of these doors. Why are we here? We're here to put on Christ. &gt;&gt; We're here for this word that's been spoken in these last days to become a manifestation in our lives. &gt;&gt; We're here to die. We're here to get judged. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. He's my judge this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not going to be judged there because he's my judge here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He's judging me right now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Judge me, Lord. &gt;&gt; Search me, Lord. See if there be anything in me. Take it out of me. &gt;&gt; I want to be free, Father. &gt;&gt; I'm in your presence. I want to be free. I don't want this morning to go by, oh God, without you touching me and setting me free. &gt;&gt; I know I'm not walking the way I should be walking. I know there's boundaries over my head. I know there's something holding me back. Hallelujah. I know something is binding me. Don't stay in that condition. Cry out to God. The word is here to set you free. &gt;&gt; Yes, brother &gt;&gt; in your doubt. Just believe in who you are. Satan has told you for many years that you're not a son and daughter of God. And today you're still believing that. You got to be set free from that. &gt;&gt; You got to be loose from that bondage, that demon. &gt;&gt; That's a devil. Any lie of the devil is from him. He's the father of lies. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Don't worry, my brothers and sisters. If you're conscious of what's being spoken, that's a good sign because the false anointed ones, the Pharisees and Sadducees of this message, they never recognize who they are. Jesus never knew uh Judas never knew who he was. Pharisees and Sadducees thought they were servants of Moses of the most high God. We are Abraham's seed. Even here was the living word telling them that they're in sin, that they need to repent, that they need to be born again. The living word, the living God that they're claiming to serve. Think about it. It blows my mind. Standing right in front of them and here they are standing like that because they couldn't recognize. They're blinded to it. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; My my my. They're here today, my brothers and sisters. They're here today. Amen. They'll come and they'll preach. Maybe they'll preach over this pulpit. They're preaching all over a lot of different pulpit. Amen. But it's for you to recognize. Amen. Hallelujah. It's for you to recognize. Amen. Glory to God. Only Jesus Christ can do that. goes back to what Jesus said. Unless a man is born again, he cannot see or enter into the kingdom of God. My brothers and sisters, you know, I can't get away from this. Hallelujah. I'm sorry, but you know, if you don't start right, you don't end right. And that's a that's a problem with a lot of people. Amen. That come into the gospel. They don't start right. Hallelujah. So, they're never going to end right. And we have to start the way Jesus told us to start. Amen. It's it's a death, a burial, and a resurrection. Amen. Amen. You need to be born again. Hallelujah. You need to know that you're born again. How how you going to know? I I don't know. I can't explain that to you. But all I know is that, you know, God was moving in my life. God was dealing with my life. God called me supernaturally and and revealed this word. I was a Catholic. Amen. I'm just going to share this with you. I just feel led. I was a Catholic and and and and and I was about to commit suicide. I was in a bad condition, a mental condition. And and I went to the Catholic church and I told I said, "God, uh this is all I know who you are in the Catholic church. If you don't come and deliver me cuz I was in bondage like you wouldn't believe. You don't come and deliver me, I'm that's it. I'm finishing my life. I can't put up with this torment anymore." And I was in bad torment. And I I I went into the the the confession box and the priest I poured out my heart. I poured my heart to a man and he said, "Oh, go say some Hail Marys and some our fathers and all that stuff." And I I felt I'm just going to say it plain. I felt raped. &gt;&gt; I felt raped, defiled. I walked out of that because I knew I was going to end my life. Wasn't a joke. I walked out of there starting to cry. I went to the altar and I knelt down and I couldn't even say anything. And I heard a voice, you won't find me here. When that voice spoke to me, hallelujah. I got up. I walked out of those doors. I walked home crying and weeping on the streets. People looking at me say, "This is a crazy man. Call the cops." I'm crying and weeping on the streets. I'm saying, "Oh, God, if you're not there, where are you? &gt;&gt; Where are you?" And a couple weeks later, I'm sitting on the couch. I couldn't move. I was so depressed and so out of it. But that voice kept me from taking my life that day. And then my brother comes home. Amen. He got a job at Campbell Soup and he said, "All these brothers are talking about." He said, he had me a paper with the cloud and all that on. I'm going, "What is all this? I don't want this stuff. What is all this cloud stuff?" You know, my mind was all messed up. But then he said, you know, they were telling me about Acts 2:38 and you say that there's no power in Acts 2:38 and doing what God tell us to do. He says, you know, they're telling me in Acts 2:38 that you got to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin. And my my brothers and sisters, I'm telling you, a light came on inside of me and I said, "What did you say?" My brother's like, "You know, those who know Paul, what do you mean? What do you mean?" I said, "What did you just say?" What? I don't know what I said. What did I say? So, what did you just say? Repent. Right there, I recognize, my brothers and sisters. For the first time, I recognized I was a sinner. &gt;&gt; I didn't know I was a sinner. &gt;&gt; I didn't know I was in sin. &gt;&gt; What blindness. And a light came on and I said, "Oh, God, give me those people. Get them down here." Amen. Brother Vishnu and brother Gee and all that came down and started talking. And I'm just sitting there and I'm listening. I don't understand a word they're saying. And I come to a Wednesday night service. Amen. And I walk in there and I'm I'm shaking. I'm telling you, demons were shaking me like you wouldn't believe. But something was pulling me. Even my brother, he started hearing the singing. He's going up the stairs. He stopped and I grabbed him. Something inside of me grabbed him and pushed him up the stairs. I said, "Get up there." Unconsciously, "Get up there. I don't know. I don't know what's going on." I said, "I'm already gone. I've already lost my mind anyways. Get up there. And I walk in there and I see these people. I don't know what I'm doing here. And I walk be past the kitchen there. The the the oven is open with the heat coming out. I see a little black man there writing some notes down. I'm looking over. I said, "Okay, I'm not going to lean. I didn't say it, but I'm not going to lean to my own understanding right now." I sat down, brother, and this man of God got up there. Amen. start preaching the word. I didn't understand word saying, but my head was blowing up was pounding a world when it was going around me and around me. Hallelujah. As he was preaching the word of God. Amen. And and then I seen a I seen a light start coming around my life. I seen that light that night and and and I I said to my brother, "We're going home." I said, "You see the light?" I said, "You see the light?" He goes, "What light?" I said, "Do you see the light?" "I see the light." Because you got to remember, I think I'm I'm still in I'm in that condition still. I think I'm going crazy now. I'm really lost it. I see a light. I see a light glowing around me. I'm driving in the car with him and I'm sitting in the pastor's seat because I couldn't drive at that time. I wasn't mentally stable to drive. And I and I I I I seen a light and it was I go, "Hey, I seen a light, man. It's it's on the buildings. It's following us." My brother's going, "Oh, God. What did I do tonight? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; What did I do tonight?" I said, "No, no, no. It's following us. I'm like this. It's following us. Think what he's thinking." Amen. I get down. I get downstairs and I knock on my door. My wife's there. She lived with me for three and a half years. You want to ask her how I was like? This This This is Brother Tim that is raised from the dead. Go ask her what I was like before. Oh my I knock I knocked on that door. She opened the door and she stood back like this. Hey, she's right here. She goes, "What happened to you?" And I'm going, "Oh my god, here we go again." That's what I'm telling you the truth. &gt;&gt; And I said, "What do you mean what happened to me?" She goes, "There's a light around you." &gt;&gt; And then when she said that, that presence of that light came upon me. and she knew from that day I was never the same man. I was a violent man. I I was a violent man. I can't tell you if you're born again, but I know God is real. When I was getting baptized, when I was getting baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, hallelujah, brother Simon is sitting there baptizing me, he put me down and when my my head cleared the water. Hallelujah. I didn't know the Bible. Hallelujah. I seen a coffin close and I went into like a trance and all I remember is [Music] and I was floating like this. And all I remember is brother Simon picking me up out of the water and I'm going, "Oh, God. I I I I can't explain it. I can't explain it this morning." But I knew my life was never going to be the same. I knew something happened inside of me that I was never going to be the same. 33 years later. Oh, ups and downs and battles. Amen. But I'm pressing on the upward way by the grace of God. Hallelujah. I know he's real. Glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; That's all I know. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I can't explain it, but I experience the living God. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He started the work inside of me. Amen. He's going to finish it. &gt;&gt; No matter what the devil tries to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is going to finish it. &gt;&gt; I'm going I'm going up. &gt;&gt; I'm going up. I'm going up not because of me, because of him. He called me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He resurrected me. &gt;&gt; Amen. He did this in my life. &gt;&gt; I was dead. &gt;&gt; I was dead. &gt;&gt; I was dead in sin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now I'm alive. &gt;&gt; Oh God, I'm alive. You see, I don't look at this flesh. Go ahead and look at this flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll be the first one to tell you it's not perfect, but I'm alive &gt;&gt; and I know him in the power of his resurrection. &gt;&gt; Every day I've known him in the power of his resurrection. Cuz that power will never the blood will never cease. Amen. To lose its power until the church of God be saved out of this world to sin no more. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Ah hallelujah. Oh my. Let us be very clear. When you are born again that gives you the power to be free indeed. There is no power to set you free like like being a reli being religious or following the law or being legalistic or believing that God sent a prophet or believing you say this because you're in the message and you listen to the tapes. That's all good. If the spirit of God hasn't given you the new birth inside of you, it's all good. But if the spirit of God hasn't given you the new birth, hallelujah, you will definitely take this word, the prophet's message, the law, like Moses's, like the Pharisees and Sadducees. You'll take it and you'll produce the same thing. Amen. Must be born again. Freedom only comes when there comes an awakening to you out of your sleep and slumber of the flesh. Romans 6 4 it says we are buried with him in Christ and now we walk in newness of life in the likeness of his resurrection. Hallelujah. And our body of sin body of sin in is done away with with we are no longer slaves to sin. That's the power of the token life that sets us free indeed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not. Listen, my brothers and sisters, it may sound like a paradox. Amen. Until it becomes real to you, but I ain't a slave to sin. &gt;&gt; I'm not in bondage to sin anymore. &gt;&gt; Why? Because of me. &gt;&gt; Because I said so. &gt;&gt; Because I did something. &gt;&gt; I just explained to you. And I can go on and on with experiences. Hallelujah. But he did it. &gt;&gt; He did something. Amen. &gt;&gt; I I rest my faith in him in the finished work, what he did in my life. If I stand before the devil and all his attacks with this God, amen, that raised me from the dead that is doing these things. Amen. &gt;&gt; The gates of hell will not prevail. &gt;&gt; I said the gates of hell will not prevail against a born again believer. It has no power over you, &gt;&gt; oh God. But by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Through faith, by faith, we take the word that has been given to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; And take the sword. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I remember that message brother Simon preached many years ago. Classic messages. Take the sword off the wall. &gt;&gt; Take take it out of your holster. Amen. Get it out. Get the word out and start using it, my brothers and sisters. Stop letting the devil bind you, control you. Amen. Oh my. Thank you, Lord. Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. &gt;&gt; Oh, liberty. The spirit of the Lord is in our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. We say we look at it. It's in the building. Here it is in the building. I know he's here. Hallelujah. But where the spirit of the Lord is, there's liberty. Listen, the spirit of the Lord is here. He's there. There's liberty. &gt;&gt; Amen. Freedom. Amen. Freedom. Hallelujah. I believe every word of God and I believe in the true freedom. Amen. I believe in total deliverance. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe in the healing power. I believe in everything. Hallelujah. And my faith is going to take me to every one of those promises that God has ordained for me. You You hear what I'm saying? My faith is going to take me to every one of those promises and they are going to manifest in my life. &gt;&gt; That's what the song says. If you don't want to go, don't hinder me. Hallelujah. I'm going in that direction with the word of God in my life. Amen. Hallelujah. You want to follow the world. You want to follow your flesh. Amen. You want to follow your pleasures. You want to follow your cultures. You want to follow your traditions. Go ahead. Don't hinder me. Hallelujah. I'm following the revealed word that's becoming alive inside of me. Amen. &gt;&gt; All I see in my life, Amen. I have desires. I'm a passion like passion man just like any one of you. I have desires and all that, but all I want to see in my life is God and the word made flesh in my life ever since day one that he called me. Amen. That's all that's in my heart. Amen. Because he is alive in there, not because of me. Amen. Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. I thought I was get getting near the close here. Lord is slowing down the time for me. Amen. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Hallelujah. The Bible passage speaks about not drawn back from the liberty given to believers. In Galatians 5:1, it says, "Stand steadfast, therefore, in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and do not entangle again with the yoke of bondage." Oh God, help us, Lord. Galatians 5:1 is part of Paul's letter to the Galatians where he's addressing the issue of legalism and the importance of faith in Christ for salvation. Oh, it says and warns us in the scriptures. Amen. And we all tempted in this area. All of us. Even myself, I've gone through it where in your mind, Satan will try to bring you back. When God is setting you free by grace, by the revealed word, I know what I'm saying here. Satan will try to bring you back into bondage to the law, to works. Oh yeah. In your heart. I'm not saying that works, we need to do works. We need to do things, but in your heart. Amen. And when you do that in your heart, then you start believing by your works and by the law that you're saved, that you're okay, that you're accepted in God. And that's a lie of the devil. Because you're taking away the the the his death. You're taking away the cross, the power of the cross, the resurrection. You're taking away everything. Hallelujah. Amen. And you're putting it on yourself. Hallelujah. Glory to God. The liberty mentions refers to the freedom from bondage of sin and the law that believers receive through faith in Jesus Christ. The yoke of bondage refers to the system and rules and rituals that we part of the old testament law which could not save people from their sin. It will not save you today from your sins. all your works, a legalism spirit, all these things will not save you today. Hallelujah. Paul urges believers to stand fast in the liberty. Meaning they should remain steadfast in their faith, in their revelation, and not swave by those who promote to you to return to legalistic practices. It's here. It's being preached in this message. God has set his people free. Amen. Just like Paul said, he said, "Certain ones creeped in amongst you to spy out your what?" Liberty in Christ, your freedom in Christ, your revelation in Christ to bring you back where? Into bondage to the law. He said, "Watch out for that. For Christ has set us free and set us at liberty, my brothers and sisters, to walk by faith." Hallelujah. To walk by faith in what he has done. We are free. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. This freedom is not a license to sin, but rather a call to serve one another in love described in Galatians 5:13. For you, brethren, have been called to liberty. Only do not use your liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but through love serve one another. Hallelujah. And that's for believers. Amen. The Bible stating, "My soul will have no pleasure in those who draw back," is found in Hebrews 10:38. Now the just shall live by faith. If any man draw back, soul shall have no pleasure. You see, there's no drawing back. God don't return. God don't go back. God don't retreat. Amen. And Amen. His believers, his sons and daughters of God, don't draw back. They keep going forward. Amen. I'm going forward this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're going forward this morning. &gt;&gt; That's why you're here. You want to go forward. Amen. &gt;&gt; In what? Deliverance. Hallelujah. Do I need more still more deliverance? Yes. Do you? Yes. That's why we come and hear the word. Not to draw back into our pleasures and into our mind and and drawn back that we're okay. We're not okay. Amen. I'm not okay. I never say I'm okay. Amen. I say by the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. By the grace of God, today I will go forward in his name. &gt;&gt; Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. If Jesus would have only repeated Moses's law, think about it. In his day have been the same law, but he was li he was but he was the living word. If mo if Jesus would only repeat Moses's law for his day, he couldn't because he was the living word. &gt;&gt; They they said we we we when we listen to you, Jesus, the law comes alive in our hearts. You see, he was the that token. Amen. He was the seventh seal. When he spoke the word, it came alive in their hearts. The living word of the day. It's not the prophet's day anymore. It's the bride's day and the bridegroom today. And we know the prophet was part of the bride. the bridegroom today bringing the word to pass again in flesh. When a true ministry speaks today, the message comes alive and the manifestation takes place today in the life of believers. That's God riding the trail again. When they rec they recognized who the Messiah was because when he spoke the law, he spoke the written word, it came alive in their hearts. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God came alive in their hearts. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They experienced freedom. The freedom that God gives, the freedom from sin. something you can't explain, but you experience when God speaks to you. Amen. But when the law speaks to you and you're just repeating the law, Amen. It's death. It's death today to repeat the law. Hallelujah. The law, the word, Amen, has come alive. It's a living ornament. Amen. And we are living epistles today. &gt;&gt; It's the seventh seal. Amen. Today, that's why brother Brandon couldn't preach it. There is no words to preach the seven seal. &gt;&gt; How can you preach Jesus? &gt;&gt; You experience him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He gets inside of you and he reveals himself to you. He lives inside of you. He manifests inside of you. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; How am I set free? How do you explain that you're set free? But you know you've been set free. You know you were in bondage to certain sins in your life. But he came and set you free. He changed your life. He changed your thinking. He changed your ways. Hallelujah. He changed your desires. Everything is changed inside of you. &gt;&gt; How can you truly preach that? You can't preach that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There is no words for the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; There's no words for the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm my own interpreter. I will make it plain." &gt;&gt; I don't need nobody to interpret me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is that day that we're living in now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's not the day of man anymore. Hallelujah. It's the day of God. It's the day of Jesus Christ today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is where he's coming to take control. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is he's the head of the church. &gt;&gt; He's the head of the body. &gt;&gt; Oh God. Amen. I believe he's real. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe he can lead and guide people today. &gt;&gt; I believe when I pray and I speak certain things, it'll come to pass if it's in God's will &gt;&gt; and he reveals his will in your heart. &gt;&gt; Thank you, God. Some of us don't even pray for two minutes, five minutes. How do you get in the spirit to know his will? How do you get in the spirit to know his mind? Hallelujah. Oh God. Amen. Thank you, Lord. Our prophet told us that this revealed world word will bring rapture and faith. It will bring us to perfect faith. It will bring us to total deliverance. That means total freedom. We are total freedom. We are not of our flesh. We are the soul that's been born again. The seed of God in us that lives inside this flesh. And all the channels of this flesh, hallelujah, the five channels of the flesh, the five channels of the spirit, all are under subjection to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my, I believe it with all my heart. &gt;&gt; No disbelief in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. What God has spoken in these last days will come to pass. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says, "Amen. There will be a bride. Oh my, he was looking at everything. People relied on religion, people relying on traditions, people relied on churches, people believing that they're saved. All these kind of things in his day. But he said, "There will be a bride that will take this word." Amen. And become this word, become the very manifestation of this word. Oh God, that's the battle. That's the battle of sin today. That's the battle of unbelief today. That Satan's battling us. Everything he's thrown in Satan's Eden, thrown at you. Everything, distractions, all these things. Oh my. You think Brother Brandham seen in his day all the distraction, all the sin, all the worldliness, all the pleasure, all the things that drawn the people away. What about today? &gt;&gt; What about today? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But a word's been spoken. Amen. The literal word of God has been spoken out of a mouth of a prophet. The voice of God has spoken out and said, "There will be a bride. There will be a real bride that will follow that word, that will live that word, that will become that word in this day. She will know. She will know who she is in this day. She'll know the father that lives inside of her. Oh God, &gt;&gt; she will know her God and she will do great exports. Amen. She will do great things in these last days. &gt;&gt; Oh my brothers, don't worry about tribulation. Don't worry about the market of beasts. Don't worry about the government's trying to shut us down and take everything. We can't buy, we can't sell. Oh my. I know God in that day, my brothers and sisters, is going to raise the standard. Amen. You're going to see by the word of God, by thus sayeth the Lord has been spoken. Amen. The spoken word will come into manifestation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The creative power of God once again is going to speak through the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's what he's doing. That's why we're here today. &gt;&gt; That's why we die daily as Paul says. &gt;&gt; That's why we surrender our life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. to believe this word. &gt;&gt; If you don't believe this word in its fullness, my brothers, you're going to be left behind. Tribulation, I'm going to tell you the truth. Tribulation is going to purge you. Hallelujah. The rapture is on right now. Amen. For you here, for you online, forever where you are. Hallelujah. The time is now. &gt;&gt; Hear the voice of God and come now. Hallelujah. Who says you got tomorrow? You tell me in your phone, in your calendar, that you got tomorrow. You You tell me you got next week. You got next month. I'm doing this. I'm doing that. Are you? Who said you are? &gt;&gt; Come. Come now. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, brother, I'll come next week. Come now &gt;&gt; in your heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In your surrender. Hallelujah. Jesus said, "You and your traditions made the word of God in unffect." The Bible says, "Lay aside every sin and that easily besets you." Think about that this morning. What's besetting you? What hinders you? What gets in your way this morning? Or are you that blind that you can't even see that? That's between you and God. Hallelujah. Our culture traditions, religious traditions, human traditions, our intellectual traditions, our education traditions, all have an effect on making the word of God of none effect. Think about how powerful that was. Think about traditions. That's why I I've been preaching on it. Jesus said it's so powerful, my brothers and sisters, in our life. And we all brought up into this world in this body of flesh with traditions. There's traditions all around us. It's like habits. We break one habit and another habit comes back. That's the human nature. Traditions are all around us. Our culture is all around us. But Jesus himself said because of those things in your life and you accept them and I see it. I see it manifesting in people's lives. You're making the word of God of none effect. The real word, the living word. And what happens? You become religious. You become dead. The word of God has no effect in your life. Oh my brothers and sisters. Hallelujah. It's the rising of the sun. He is the one who opened those seals. He is those seals. The whole word of God is Christ and Christ is the seals that was opened. What is the opening of the seals then? Revealing Christ. Hallelujah. Revealing Christ in your life. That's what we're talking about. And the very seventh angel which represents the seven churches all complete and we couldn't even see it. They took the picture not us and there he's standing there supreme judge showing that he's the alpha and no omega the beginning and the end. What identification? Quickening power did that to us. Quickening power let us see his coming. Quickening power snatched us from death to life. Quickening power gives us discernment to know what's right and what's wrong, what to do and what not to do. It's quickening power. It's quickening power in your life this morning that you're here. It's quickening power that you're overcoming. Hallelujah. that you're receiving the word. Amen. It's quickening power, my brothers and sisters. You couldn't do this on your own. I couldn't do it on my own. How can I have a testimony? How can you have a testimony like you have without the quickening power &gt;&gt; of God in your life? Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Quickening power did all these things in our lives. with all that evidence collected with us now this morning. Oh, I think of that song on that resurrection morning when death's horrors will be broken. We shall rise. Hallelujah. We shall rise. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; We shall rise. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; In him, we become a part of him. That Easter that revealed the secret of God like it was then. life after death. We now are alive who were once dead in sin and trespasses. That true Easter seal has broken death. Amen. I believe that Easter seal has broken over my life. Hallelujah. I believe it's broken death over my life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh God. Hallelujah. You talk about rejoicing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I can't die. &gt;&gt; I've already died to myself. I'm already dead in Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm hidden in him. &gt;&gt; I know I'm in him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. Is this real? &gt;&gt; Is this word real? Is it alive inside of you? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Jesus. &gt;&gt; That God, is he real and alive inside of you? &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; These are not words anymore. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Amen. I know I'm going to get to a place I'm not even going to preach with notes anymore. Hallelujah. Amen. He's becoming so real. He's a living Amen. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Amen. Amen. Oh my. And now God by his Holy Spirit has broken a seal from around our lives. And Christ has revealed that he lives in us. He has revealed that he lives in us and now we are quickened with him. &gt;&gt; Where he is, I am. Where he is, you are this morning. Oh God, not only Jesus in his own body, but Jesus in bride form now can say, "Me who you see standing here this morning is also in heaven." Oh yes. What are you talking about, Tim? Hallelujah. Just like when Jesus said to Nicodemus, "You must be born again." What are you talking about, Jesus? go in my mother's belly again at this age. What are you talking about? What are you talking about, Tim? You're standing here. I can see you. And you're in heaven, too. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm in heaven. &gt;&gt; How can I Oh, brother. How can this be happening to me? My God, my life, my the the life that has changed me, me preaching up here. Oh my god. I I would die if anybody asked me to to come and speak anything at a wedding or anything. I would die. I'd be in a corner going, I'm having a heart attack. &gt;&gt; Thank you, &gt;&gt; God. what he's done for me in my life. Things that I see, things that come out of my mouth. I fellowship with my wife and some of you brethren, things that come out of my mouth sometimes after I go, "Holy cow, didn't even finish grade 10. &gt;&gt; Never passed the spelling test." &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that to put myself down. &gt;&gt; Good. Let me put myself down so Christ could be put up. &gt;&gt; Never passed a spelling test, a history test. None of those tests. I was a tough guy. I was a bodybuilder, good-looking guy in school. I just made my way through as a jigalo through school. That's all I was. That's all I could be. I'm just telling you the truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. because he can't read it at all. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true. And I'm not like, brother Brad, I'm not supporting that. I'm just saying the life of Jesus Christ, the living word of God and what he's done. He's raised us from the dead. If this is not raised from the death, I dead, I don't know what is. Who can do greater to me in my life? Who can do greater to you in your life &gt;&gt; than what Jesus done? &gt;&gt; You tell me. &gt;&gt; You tell me who compares to this. You tell me what compares to you in your life. &gt;&gt; If God be God, then serve him. &gt;&gt; If God be real to you, then serve him &gt;&gt; with all your heart. &gt;&gt; Stop being lukewarm, lazy, lack. Stop being half devoted to this kingdom of God here &gt;&gt; and serve him. &gt;&gt; If you find something greater than go, &gt;&gt; I say go. &gt;&gt; But I have I I'm staying right here &gt;&gt; in Christ. &gt;&gt; Not in this building. In Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me try to wind this down. Amen. Thank you, Lord. the token. Apply it, church. Apply it. &gt;&gt; Don't fail. Will you not? Don't let the sun set. I'm reading what the prophet is saying here. Don't rest day or night. Don't take a chance. It won't work, children. What won't work? All you're playing around, all you're hiding behind religion, it won't work. You must have the token. You must be born again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You say, "I believe." Yes, I believe. I go. Yes, I go. I believe the message that is all right. Are you hearing me? That is good. Not saying it's not good. It's not all right. But you must have the token. &gt;&gt; There's something different there. &gt;&gt; You see something different? &gt;&gt; Do you hear brother Brandham tabernacle? Do you hear Good Neighbors Ministries this morning? &gt;&gt; You must have the token displayed. &gt;&gt; Without it, all your believing, think about it, is in vain. You live a good life. You listen to what the word says. See, that's the problem. That's the unbelief. We don't listen to what the word says for us to do. The word says you go to church, you try to live right. That's fine. But that's not it. When I see the blood, that's the token. And the token is here. Just to come this far. Think about it. Just to come this far in the message for so many years following, believing with zeal and then you start falling away. falling away. Your experience, your desire for God being everything in your life starts falling away. The world starts creeping in. The water starts coming into the boat. Oh God, when I see the blood, that's the token. And the token is here. Hallelujah. I believe the message. You obey the message. Come into Christ. So obeying the message means &gt;&gt; not just quoting it, not saying I believe it, but it means come into Christ. &gt;&gt; Come into Christ. That's the key there. You say, "I believe every word you said, brother Brandham." Isn't that Is it not where I just I just get thrilled when the Holy Spirit I believe every word you say, Brother Brandon. Isn't that the same spirit? I say what the prophet says. Say everything the prophet says and say it the way he says it. You say every word you said, brother Brandham. That's good. He says that's good. Here's a prophet's own mouth. But that's not it. &gt;&gt; That's not it. Saying what the tapes say, saying what the prophet says, that's not it. &gt;&gt; Do you believe in the Holy Ghost is alive today? You believe he still speaks today? You still believe he has man of God that he can reveal his secrets today? &gt;&gt; Well, that's not it. That's a lie from the pits of hell. Brother Bradom said, the lady said to them, "Did God allow you to say things that make people go this way and that way?" He said, "Yes, God deliberately made me say things that are in the message that make people go this way, off that way, off." But he knew the Holy Ghost, Christ, this the the mighty angels come down to get this bride &gt;&gt; would lead her into all truth, &gt;&gt; would guide her and lead her into all truth. Because when the spirit of truth comes in her, amen, she'll be able to divide the word of God right down the middle. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Take your religion, take your religious culture and your religious duties. I want Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, get what I'm saying here? take your message, take all your books and take all the tapes, but give me Christ. &gt;&gt; When I look when I listen to the tapes and I seen a man of God, a prophet of God, which I believe with all my heart, I seen Christ. Amen. I seen Jesus Christ in my experiences that I I I I spoke today and many many more. I had all those before I even knew God sent a prophet because I was experiencing Christ. It's been Christ from the beginning is going to be Christ right to the end. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I see men of God today and no other men than I believe that the prophet of God that has given us. We have nothing to preach. We'd have nothing to manifest. Amen. If the prophets of the Old Testament didn't speak and prophesy Jesus coming, Jesus wouldn't have came. You understand? So I believe the prophet. I believe the spoken word. Amen. But I see Christ. I don't see a man. Hallelujah. He never pointed He never once pointed you to him. Hallelujah. I'll be finished here in a minute. The very life that was in Christ be in you. When I see that, I'll pass over you. You see why we preach the way we preach. That you know that you know that you know. If you don't know, don't leave here today without crying out to God. Don't. You don't know if you have tomorrow. Hallelujah. There's been churches, churches, brides, brides. But there has to come one. Hallelujah. There has to come a real bride. There must come one. Not only with the mechanics, but the dynamics of it that makes that church live. as I invite the musicians up and move in the power of his resurrection until we come to that place. And that's the place where we're coming to. That's the place that the Holy Ghost is leading us to to that place. What place? The dynamics on the mechanics making the church live and move in the power of his resurrection. And as he being the bride, being the groom, the bride has to come forth because it's part of him. These are prophecies here. This is me and you if you believe you're the bride of Jesus Christ. And it can only be the manifestation of the fullness of all the revelations. any other that's spoken of the bride, it can only manifest. If it does something different from the groom, it isn't the bride because she is flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone, life of his life, power of his power. She is him. She is him. Hallelujah. As a man and a woman are one and a woman taken from his side, she has taken a spirit of a feminist spirit from him. The flesh of his side made both mechanics and dynamics. the wife, the spirit of him and the and the flesh of him and put it together and made mechanics and dynamics. That's what sets us free indeed today. Surrendering your life to who? Christ, the seventh seal. He is the token. He is the very life of God in us manifesting the word of God today. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen. Thank God. I am free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Free. Free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From this flesh of sin, from this world of sin. Amen. I've been washed in the blood. I've been born again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm saved. I'm saved by his wonderful grace. I'm so glad that I found out that he can pull me out and show me the way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh God, &gt;&gt; thank God. I am free. Amen. I am free this morning. You're a son and daughter of God. Hallelujah. You are free. Oh, you might not believe it so much. You might be still bound. Hallelujah. But you're free this morning. Who the son of man sets free. All the fathers give me my hand will come. I won't lose one. Oh, the son of man is set free is free indeed. &gt;&gt; My brothers and sisters, all I expect out of my life, Amen, is freedom. To be set free more and more, hallelujah. It doesn't matter how much Satan fights. He can't stop this inside of me. this work that God has started inside of me. Nobody can stop it. Amen. Why? It's the seventh seal. It's Christ himself. Oh, God. [Music] God is going to interpret his word. He is interpreting his word in this day and age. You know, Christ can stand right in flesh, right in front of people today and as and every other day they wouldn't recognize him. I said to the brothers in the back room there, I said, "We look back, I sit there and I think about this sometimes. We look back at all the prophets. We look back at Jesus. We look back at the apostles. We look back at brother Brandham and we look at ourselves as nothing. We're always looking back [Music] and looking at that. And God said to me, "Who are you? Who are you?" Remember, I didn't say to myself. God said to me, "Who are you? Who are you that I would bring you here in the last days? Who are you that I would trust you with the fullness of the word of God? Who are you that I would live inside of you like in no other time? I will possess a vessel like at no other time. Who are you that will stand on the last days and preach my word right to the end, right to the rapture? Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see, we never recognize what God is doing and what God is in flesh today. Who are you sons and daughters of God? You're not a housewife. You're not just working at this a carpenter. You're sons and daughters of the living God. You've been predestinated to stand on the earth in this day and bring forth Jesus Christ again. The fullness of the word, not in part, but in fullness. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; God is going to live in a people. There's going to be a bride. Amen. That's going to be fully possessed by his life. Amen. &gt;&gt; I come to claim my own. I come to wrap everything up. And there will be a move of God that the world will never see again in the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe today that God's doing a work in me. And I believe that work he's doing in me is going to manifest that. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Cuz if you don't believe that, that's unbelief. That's sin. I believe that. &gt;&gt; I believe everything that he has spoken and I don't need to interpret it. I don't need to understand it. I don't need to know how he's going to do it. I believe by faith he's going to do it. &gt;&gt; I know what he's done in my life. I know what he's done this far. He's going to do the rest. Don't doubt. That's why that angel of love only believe my brothers and sisters, we are believing more than what they believe in back there. We got the fullness of the word. Only believe the fullness of the word on this day. Amen. Let us stand. Let us sing that song, brother Mike. Hallelujah. Are you free? Are you free? &gt;&gt; Oh, let's worship then. Amen.

You're not listening to brother Tim. Brother Tim cannot do nothing for you but believe with you. If you know there's freedom that you need in your life, lift your hands to him. Father, who the son of man sets free is free indeed. We don't pray to a god in the sky or a god of a past age, an ancient God. You're a living God. You're here this morning, not only in the atmospheres, Father. Your spirit, but the person of Christ is here within us. Father, you have declared it. You have spoken it. Father, through the cross of Calvary, Father, you went down into hell, you took the keys of death, hell, and the grave. Hallelujah. You stuck it right off of Satan. No more you'll have power over my children. No more you'll control them. &gt;&gt; But I died and I rose again. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I am resurrected this morning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Satan, that's God's property that you're holding on to. And you know you have no authority to hold on to it this morning. As the people surrender their hearts, as the people repent and confess that very sin in their hearts right now, the blood of Jesus we apply to them. Loose them right now be gone from them &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. My brothers and sisters, whoever you are, you are free. Never go back and entertain that sin anymore.
