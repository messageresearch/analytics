[35:58] Lord to deal with in your life I can
[36:01] imagine that that woman she was carrying
[36:03] those water pots but there was much
[36:05] heavier burden that she was carrying
[36:08] when she was walking to that well amen
[36:11] and she just she just needed something
[36:14] beyond what she could possibly imagine
[36:17] to happen she had no idea what she was
[36:19] going to encounter that morning amen or
[36:22] that evening and I believe that if we've
[36:25] come with that kind of you know that
[36:27] kind of a heart to know that listen
[36:30] we're we're we're serving the Living God
[36:32] that he's he's able you know sometimes
[36:35] we don't see him sometimes we you know
[36:37] we we get discouraged we find ourselves
[36:39] in situations where we just need the
[36:41] Lord so bad and you know he just you you
[36:44] pray and nothing happens you pray and
[36:46] nothing happens you pray and then all of
[36:49] a sudden something starts to stir up and
[36:51] then you get yourself into the presence
[36:53] of the Lord and then all of a sudden
[36:55] under that kind of a burden and
[36:57] desperation God speaks amen amen praise
[37:01] God I believe this morning that he wants
[37:03] to speak to some of us this morning amen
[37:07] praise God and so um you know before we
[37:10] go to the word of God let's just um you
[37:15] know I want to share some things with
[37:17] you uh you know from from this week I
[37:20] had a you know very wonderful
[37:22] interesting wonderful kind of a week
[37:25] this week many things going on but you
[37:27] know um I was I was here during the week
[37:31] and I was studying and I was just you
[37:32] know praying and you know and I said you
[37:34] know what I got to go for a walk you
[37:36] know cuz I realized man I'm sitting too
[37:38] much you know you got to get up you got
[37:40] to move you got to exercise I said I'm
[37:43] going to go for a walk you know so I got
[37:45] out and I went for a walk I went down
[37:47] through the neighborhoods Here for a
[37:49] Good 20 25 minute walk and I crossed
[37:52] over to the other side and as I'm
[37:53] walking across you know I'm looking at
[37:55] the church and I'm and I'm just I'm just
[37:57] saying oh man praise God I'm looking at
[38:01] this church I said Lord it's incredible
[38:03] what you've done for us and it just
[38:06] started you know going through my mind
[38:09] on how he brought us from where we were
[38:12] amen and here you know uh uh here he's
[38:15] given us this beautiful church and you
[38:17] know I kept walking along and then I
[38:19] finally got all the way down to the
[38:20] lights down by Fortinos there and I
[38:22] crossed over and I'm walking back and
[38:24] I'm just pondering on the Lord and I'm
[38:26] looking at everything I'm looking at the
[38:27] homes I'm looking at the addresses on
[38:29] the home and I'm looking at all the
[38:32] different addresses and you know you're
[38:33] just you're just walking right and and
[38:36] then I started to ponder I started
[38:37] looking at the address and then I
[38:38] thought about our address and I said
[38:41] 5270 New Street you know just thoughts
[38:45] right but I said you know Lord I know
[38:49] that everything is in the
[38:53] word we are the word we are the
[38:56] expression of the word and every detail
[38:59] in our lives was in his book in the word
[39:05] of God and I thought you know when I
[39:07] started to ponder I said 5270 I started
[39:10] to think about chapters you know like
[39:12] how many books in the Bible have 52
[39:14] chapters you know 52 and then I thought
[39:17] 70 and I thought man I don't know if
[39:20] there's a book that has a 70th
[39:23] verse but the first thought that came to
[39:26] my mind was the book of Isaiah and so I
[39:29] went immed I'm walking and I open my
[39:31] phone and I go to Isaiah 52 go ahead put
[39:34] it
[39:35] up and Isaiah 52 reads you know now I
[39:40] got 52 and I got seven to 10 because I I
[39:45] said well there's no 70 but then I said
[39:48] okay well 5 * 2 is 10 and then the next
[39:51] number 7 * * 7 is 70 I said okay so
[39:57] we'll read to verse 10 and so I read to
[40:00] verse 10 and it says how beautiful upon
[40:02] the mountains are the feet of him that
[40:05] bringeth good
[40:07] news I said Good Tidings which means
[40:09] good news and then I was reading there
[40:12] and I'm going good neighbor Ministries
[40:14] the Lord is good you know and I just
[40:17] kept reading and that publisheth peace
[40:19] that bringeth good tidings of good there
[40:22] it is again that publisheth salvation
[40:26] that saith un to Zion thy God reth thy
[40:30] Watchmen shall lift up the voice with
[40:32] the voice together shall they sing I
[40:35] believe God has raised up Watchmen in
[40:37] this hour God is God has raised up uh
[40:40] you know uh under the five full ministry
[40:44] that's that that are the Watchmen of
[40:45] this hour to bring the word of God for
[40:47] this hour and it was just all pouring
[40:49] into me and and and then for they shall
[40:52] see eye to eye when the Lord shall bring
[40:55] again Zion oh he's bringing this bride
[40:59] back together again he's restoring the
[41:02] body of Jesus Christ and they shall see
[41:04] eye to eye you will not get a different
[41:07] Revelation than I've got in this word in
[41:10] this message you you can't get a
[41:12] different Revelation because it's Christ

[42:10] know if we've ever noticed that if
[42:12] anybody ever noticed that in the
[42:14] scripture but that just came all you
[42:16] know like a tremendous blessing as I was
[42:18] walking and I was pondering and I was
[42:20] thinking about our lives in Christ
[42:22] listen what it told me was that this is
[42:25] exactly where we're supposed to be amen
[42:28] this is the house of God that He gave
[42:31] unto us this is our home this is where
[42:34] we get fed this is where he wants to
[42:37] meet us amen praise God this is a
[42:40] glorious you know glorious thing to the
[42:44] Sons and Daughters of God when you come

[42:48] you start pondering about your whole
[42:49] life that led you here and I started to
[42:52] think about my whole life you know and I
[42:55] started to now now God is in numbers
[42:57] yeah God is God is is listen mathematics
[43:01] was not created by Newton or whoever it
[43:04] was that that came up with you know math
[43:06] formulas and this and that God is
[43:10] perfect and perfect in his in his
[43:13] numbers in his in his uh his thought
[43:16] there's nothing he's omniscient he's
[43:18] omnipresent there's nothing that that he
[43:20] misses I know you're standing but no I'm
[43:23] we're already preaching amen the Lord's
[43:26] already showing us here because the this
[43:28] whole thought is going to flow here

[43:33] that because they need to know that that
[43:35] this is something that that he he he did
[43:39] this and this is where we're supposed to

[43:48] if if you know is this real you know
[43:50] because sometimes you got to go back and
[43:52] you got to you got you got to think

[50:47] into my mind and my heart I was
[50:49] rejoicing I was I was getting
[50:51] stimulation like crazy but then you go
[50:53] to put it into words and it's it's
[50:55] almost impossible possible how do you
[50:57] put Revelation into words you can't put
[51:00] Revelation into words I realize it's
[51:03] Unwritten this aspect that we're looking
[51:06] at we you know we're going to be looking
[51:07] at the book and how it's ready to be
[51:10] revealed in the last times and what's in
[51:13] the book and you know one of the aspects
[51:16] of the book is that you know let's read
[51:19] the scripture and let's go from there
[51:21] amen praise God cuz I got you standing
[51:23] and I realize amen first Peter uh 1
[51:26] verses 3 to 5 blessed be the God and

[51:39] you need to be begotten again now you
[51:42] can take that word again and my goodness
[51:45] I don't know we we could go from from
[51:48] Genesis to Revelation amen but you know
[51:51] you can be born again you can be you
[51:54] know there's there's just too much to
[51:56] get into there unto a lively Hope by the
[52:00] resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
[52:02] dead so this is a key element the
[52:07] Resurrection The the anointing the
[52:09] spirit of God to to to resurrect
[52:14] something that was not aware not alive
[52:18] amen from the dead to an inheritance
[52:22] Incorruptible that's what we're going to
[52:25] that inheritance is not just another
[52:28] place but it's also another body it's
[52:32] another aspect of our existence as
[52:37] attributes as uh uh thoughts and a part
[52:42] amateure Gods a part of God Amen praise
[52:45] God Incorruptible and undefiled and that
[52:49] fadeth not away reserved in heaven
[52:53] heaven is not some place a billion miles
[52:55] up there Heaven is just another
[52:57] dimension brother brandham says it's
[52:59] right here in the church it's just
[53:02] another dimension that you're gonna pass
[53:04] that if this Earthly Tabernacle be
[53:06] dissolved you're going to move right
[53:07] into that heaven amen it's kept who are
[53:11] kept by the power of God through faith
[53:14] listen it's Revelation that's keeping
[53:16] you it's Revelation that's brought you
[53:19] here this morning it's Revelation that's
[53:21] going to change your vile your mortal
[53:24] bodies to make them incorruptible it's
[53:26] going to take the power of God unto
[53:30] salvation ready to be revealed in the
[53:34] last time you may be
[53:36] seated praise God
[53:38] hallelujah glory to God Amen you know
[53:42] it's just impossible for us to possibly
[53:45] you know um uh understand the
[53:51] book you know there's there's like
[53:54] there's there's there's millions of
[53:56] church Church es this morning all
[53:58] over the Earth that are reading from
[54:01] this very same Bible they're reading the
[54:04] same very same scriptures amen but yet
[54:09] there's something about the word of God
[54:12] that unless the spirit of God unless the
[54:15] Holy Ghost unless you've been awakened
[54:19] unless you've been you've been revealed
[54:23] unless you've been unveiled amen unless
[54:27] the part of you that that that God wants
[54:29] to use in this time in this dispensation
[54:32] in this hour is awakened the word of God
[54:36] will could will have none effect it'll
[54:38] be traditions of man they're reading the
[54:41] same book the same Bible but yet there's
[54:44] things within the word of God look we
[54:46] just drew out of this one scripture more
[54:50] than probably you could possibly imagine
[54:52] you could preach you could preach 10
[54:54] sermons on this very scripture why
[54:58] because it's
[54:59] Eternal the word of God is eternal the
[55:03] Bible is only a written book but yet
[55:07] that book it contains the whole plan of
[55:11] God the whole uh you know God the
[55:15] self-existent one the whole Mind Of God
[55:18] is contained within that book but yet
[55:21] people read the scriptures and you get
[55:24] all kinds of different interpretations
[55:25] from it One Believes there's three Gods
[55:28] Another One Believes there's no God
[55:29] another one believes that there's this
[55:31] and one believes you baptized that way
[55:33] another one believes you can baptize
[55:35] this way but without the
[55:37] spirit without the the anointing of
[55:40] God's word upon your life it's only
[55:44] letters it's only religion it's only
[55:48] tradition you're just doing everything
[55:50] by works you think that oh if I go to
[55:52] church more I'll get more yes there's
[55:55] that's true truth but you got to have a
[55:58] revelation of coming into church you got
[56:01] to be coming because you're coming to
[56:02] meet with him not to be seen by your
[56:06] brothers and sisters not to be seen
[56:08] putting your money into the plate so
[56:10] that everybody can see that you give
[56:12] that's not what being a church a part of
[56:16] the body of Christ is all about amen
[56:19] there's so much more to the word of God
[56:22] Amen praise God let's go to the next
[56:24] scripture
[56:26] well before yeah let's read that
[56:28] scripture having made known unto us now
[56:31] this is this is this is you know we're
[56:34] looking at the book we're looking at
[56:36] what's going to be revealed how the word
[56:39] is going to be revealed in the last time
[56:41] because we're in the last time amen amen
[56:44] there's
[56:45] listen Revelations 10 said time shall be
[56:50] no more so we need to we we need to
[56:54] understand what took place through
[56:56] through that Ministry that would bring
[56:58] us to a place where time now yes we're
[57:01] living in time yes we are in time bodies
[57:05] this is this is what we're we're in
[57:07] right now but we are being
[57:10] translated the Rapture is in progress
[57:14] the Rapture is a revelation so we need
[57:16] to understand how it is that the Rapture
[57:19] is going to take place in our lives and
[57:21] it's not going to be by intellectual
[57:23] understanding I can only tell you so
[57:25] much and you can only read so much
[57:28] commentaries by men and and other but
[57:30] the Rapture is a Divine thought
[57:33] revelation of God that once it comes
[57:37] into you you you become the Rapture you
[57:40] start to Quicken you start to move out
[57:43] of this world's ways and the ways of
[57:47] this world you start to operate and move
[57:49] in a totally different way than the rest
[57:51] of the world you become strange amen
[57:54] very true but he it's having made known
[57:57] unto us the mystery of his will and his
[58:02] will is written in the word it's in the
[58:06] book everything about our inheritance
[58:08] everything about where we came from and
[58:11] everything about where we're going is
[58:12] all written in the book Hallelujah and
[58:16] we need to understand the mystery of his
[58:19] will amen according to his good pleasure
[58:24] which he hath purp purposed in
[58:27] himself so people want to interpret the
[58:31] word people want to put their own
[58:33] interpretation of the word there's a
[58:35] scripture that says lean not unto your
[58:38] own
[58:40] understanding God is his own interpreter
[58:43] God will interpret for
[58:45] himself what it is that he's doing
[58:48] remember this book is is is all about
[58:53] Christ it's all about God's plan
[58:56] everything from A to Z amen praise God
[58:59] which he hath purposed in
[59:01] himself that in the
[59:04] dispensation of the fullness of times
[59:07] now did we not say that Revelations 10
[59:10] 1-7 the mighty Angel come down put one
[59:13] foot on the land one on the sea and say
[59:15] that time shall be no more so we need to
[59:18] move into that realm of Faith where
[59:22] where where time has come to an end for
[59:25] this world
[59:26] am time is still happening we're still
[59:30] progressing the world is moving on
[59:33] everything is progressing all prophecy
[59:36] around us is still being fulfilled but
[59:39] you are the church you are the body of
[59:43] Christ you are the bride you are the one
[59:46] that's going to receive a revelation for
[59:49] the Rapture and our focus is on the
[59:53] Rapture our fulfillment of scripture is
[59:57] going to be people are going to know
[59:59] that we fulfill the scripture when they
[1:00:01] don't see us anymore where they can't
[1:00:04] find us where we're going to be gone in
[1:00:06] the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:00:08] and this is a process this is a process
[1:00:12] and and don't ask me how this process is
[1:00:16] going to un unveil itself in your life I
[1:00:20] just know how it's working in my
[1:00:22] life you know we're just going to bring
[1:00:25] the word of God God and the word faith
[1:00:27] cometh by hearing that's why I said you
[1:00:29] need to pray you need to pray because
[1:00:32] what I what was being unveiled to me and
[1:00:34] what was stimulating me while I was
[1:00:37] studying all of this I can't convey it
[1:00:39] to you all I know is that that that God
[1:00:43] is real God God God discerns my heart he
[1:00:47] he he discerns my needs he knows exactly
[1:00:49] where I'm at he's placed me where I'm
[1:00:52] supposed to be and that gives me Faith
[1:00:55] to know that I'm in the word of God that
[1:00:57] I'm seeing it I'm seeing it so listen
[1:01:00] the dis of the fullness of times he
[1:01:03] might gather together in
[1:01:05] one not in a hundred different
[1:01:08] churches in one and that's why it's
[1:01:12] important to understand now it's not I'm
[1:01:13] not saying that this is the one
[1:01:16] place no
[1:01:19] Christ he's the only provided place
[1:01:23] where God has placed his name
[1:01:27] it's where he's placed his name it's the
[1:01:29] mystical Supernatural body of Jesus
[1:01:32] Christ amen that we might Gather in one
[1:01:36] all things where in Christ both which
[1:01:40] are in heaven and which are on the earth
[1:01:44] even now he just makes it clear here in
[1:01:48] him even in him so
[1:01:51] everything that is being
[1:01:53] manifested that that is Eternal exactly
[1:01:57] okay we need to make this clear all
[1:02:01] things that are written in the Bible are
[1:02:03] not
[1:02:05] Eternal there's a lot of characters and
[1:02:08] individuals that were written into the
[1:02:10] word of God that had a beginning and an
[1:02:13] end that was their story it started and
[1:02:17] it ended there but you as an attribute
[1:02:21] of God you were in him before you came
[1:02:25] here
[1:02:27] you were in his thoughts you were
[1:02:30] already uh having fellowship with him in
[1:02:33] his mind you were an eternal thought and
[1:02:37] you can never not
[1:02:40] be that's that's the part of the word
[1:02:44] that is
[1:02:46] Unwritten that's an element of the book
[1:02:49] that you can't put words to it just
[1:02:52] comes into
[1:02:53] manifestation God just interpet rets it
[1:02:56] in your life all of a sudden things
[1:02:58] start to happen around you I didn't
[1:03:01] understand what was going on 30 years
[1:03:03] ago I didn't understand that the that I
[1:03:06] was hearing the word from friends and
[1:03:08] people were telling me about the word
[1:03:10] and I had a nephew that was constantly
[1:03:12] telling me I need to give my heart to
[1:03:14] Christ and I had a truck driver that was
[1:03:16] telling me I needed to go to church on
[1:03:17] Saturday or I was going to go to hell I
[1:03:19] had I I had all kinds of but nothing
[1:03:22] triggered me right nothing triggered me
[1:03:25] until until this came until this
[1:03:28] Revelation came not because it was you
[1:03:32] know
[1:03:34] uh
[1:03:36] ordained in in a certain uh um
[1:03:40] experience no it was because of the time
[1:03:44] and the season that the word was going
[1:03:46] to manifest in our lives in my life it
[1:03:51] happened to start through brother
[1:03:53] Gabriel another messenger yeah you see
[1:03:57] God has his ways and times and that's
[1:03:59] why he comes to everybody
[1:04:02] individual in his time and in his season
[1:04:06] amen praise God so both which are in
[1:04:08] heaven on Earth everything that's
[1:04:10] Eternal is is Christ because he is the
[1:04:14] self-existent one having no beginning
[1:04:16] and no end so that's what we're talking
[1:04:19] about in whom also we have obtained an
[1:04:23] inheritance being pre destinated
[1:04:27] according to the purpose of him who
[1:04:29] worketh all things after the counsel of
[1:04:32] his own will like is there anything else
[1:04:35] that needs to be said there you see
[1:04:37] people read this scripture and they
[1:04:39] don't realize that this is the story of
[1:04:43] Jesus Christ in the Plan of Redemption
[1:04:47] and that everything that was in his mind
[1:04:50] that was in his mind that was
[1:04:53] eternal was was going to go through a
[1:04:56] plan known as The Plan of Redemption and
[1:04:59] at some point in time the water of the
[1:05:02] word was going to was going to touch and
[1:05:05] come upon your life and at that
[1:05:07] appointed time you were going to awaken
[1:05:09] to who you really are not a
[1:05:13] churchgoer not a not not somebody that
[1:05:16] that that that can that can do great
[1:05:18] works of the flesh no a son or daughter
[1:05:22] of
[1:05:23] God because you're you're only a son or
[1:05:26] daughter of God here on Earth did you
[1:05:29] know
[1:05:32] that son or daughter is just a
[1:05:35] description it's just a word it's just a
[1:05:38] a a description of what something is
[1:05:41] just like Hammer just like
[1:05:45] tool okay just like screwdriver just
[1:05:49] just like house it's it's a word that
[1:05:51] describes something but here we're known
[1:05:55] as Sons and Daughters of God when the
[1:05:57] Holy Spirit quickens you by the Holy
[1:06:00] Ghost and that attribute starts to
[1:06:04] manifest in your life and that starts to
[1:06:07] show that you're actually a son because
[1:06:09] you received the Holy Ghost you've
[1:06:12] received the spirit of God you've
[1:06:13] received the seed word has germinated
[1:06:16] that attribute that was that was waiting
[1:06:20] for its time and season let's go
[1:06:23] on so here now listen listen go to the
[1:06:26] next uh slide here so in
[1:06:30] Luke 24 25-27 then he said unto them oh
[1:06:35] fools and slow of heart to believe all
[1:06:38] that the prophets have spoken ought not
[1:06:41] Christ to have suffered these things and
[1:06:43] to enter into his glory and beginning at
[1:06:46] Moses and all the prophets he expounded
[1:06:48] unto them all the scriptures the things
[1:06:52] concerning
[1:06:53] himself he started to expound to them he
[1:06:57] you know I could imagine that that he
[1:06:59] started to tell them about I was in
[1:07:01] Moses I was the one that stood there and
[1:07:04] went up to pharaoh and said thus sayeth
[1:07:07] the Lord I am that I am he was probably
[1:07:10] their hearts were burning within them
[1:07:12] thank you Lord as they were walking
[1:07:14] along he was telling them expounding
[1:07:16] everything about himself because he is
[1:07:19] the
[1:07:20] book he is the beginning he is the end
[1:07:24] everything that that he was expressing
[1:07:27] throughout the whole Old Testament
[1:07:29] through every character and every
[1:07:30] individual was Christ it was God it was
[1:07:34] the self-existent one it was Elohim it
[1:07:37] was him expressing himself through every
[1:07:40] action and every aspect because listen
[1:07:44] go to the next slide listen to brother
[1:07:46] Braham he says Christ The Mystery of God
[1:07:48] revealed he is amen the principal theme
[1:07:52] of the entire Bible amen
[1:07:56] he is the entire Bible if you read the
[1:08:00] Bible and you don't see Christ in every
[1:08:02] verse of it go back and read it again
[1:08:05] amen Oh Glory to God and I'm telling you
[1:08:08] you listen I don't care how many Church
[1:08:11] you know they you got you've been to
[1:08:13] Sunday school you've gone to church for
[1:08:15] so many years you belong to baptist
[1:08:18] Presbyterian Methodist that's got
[1:08:20] nothing to do with
[1:08:22] it it's got nothing to do with where you
[1:08:25] came from in the church that you belong
[1:08:28] to this is a new calling this is a
[1:08:31] different calling this takes you beyond
[1:08:35] denomination this takes you beyond just
[1:08:38] churchgoing and and and church formality
[1:08:41] amen praise God hallelujah you got to be
[1:08:44] able to see Christ in every aspect of
[1:08:46] the word if you can't see Christ in
[1:08:48] every verse of the Bible then you read
[1:08:50] it you read it again because you've
[1:08:53] missed something the Bible is Christ
[1:08:56] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:08:58] Word was with God and the word what was
[1:09:01] God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:09:05] dwelt Among Us God took himself a human
[1:09:08] body and he dwelt Among Us in
[1:09:11] [Music]
[1:09:13] time when you read in the beginning God
[1:09:16] created there is Christ see every from
[1:09:20] that to the Amen in the Book of
[1:09:22] Revelations is every word testifying
[1:09:26] of Jesus
[1:09:27] Christ Oh Glory to God let me tell you
[1:09:30] Saints I praise God you know I can't
[1:09:34] begin to explain to you this is
[1:09:36] something that you've got to catch on
[1:09:38] your own this is the word of God that
[1:09:41] that that Revelation is not something
[1:09:43] that that is conveyed it is received
[1:09:46] because he gives it thank you Jesus he
[1:09:48] lets the word go forth and then he rides
[1:09:51] a portion of that word right into your
[1:09:53] heart brother he's he he knows exactly
[1:09:57] what you need sister he knows exactly
[1:09:59] where you're at exactly how and he'll
[1:10:02] speak to you and you'll think he's
[1:10:04] talking
[1:10:05] about you know the Book of
[1:10:08] Revelation and yet as he's talking about
[1:10:11] that book there's something inside of me
[1:10:14] that's that's stirring up I can't quite
[1:10:17] I'm seeing something and and it's and
[1:10:20] it's real like all of a sudden he starts
[1:10:21] to flash back some experience that you
[1:10:24] may have had this week or some thought
[1:10:26] that you were pondering on or something
[1:10:29] that you were reading in the scriptures
[1:10:32] amen something that that you know
[1:10:34] because the body of Christ it's a
[1:10:36] supernatural body remember God is the
[1:10:40] he's he's the all in all there isn't a
[1:10:44] thought that you can think that he
[1:10:45] hasn't already
[1:10:46] thought there isn't a prophecy that
[1:10:49] you're going to see come to pass that
[1:10:51] was not already finished in his mind
[1:10:54] Hallelujah praise God you know we were
[1:10:56] talking there yesterday I was talking
[1:10:57] with brother Mike I was saying you know
[1:11:00] I said man you know when when when the
[1:11:03] elections were going on and and Trump
[1:11:05] was going to be going back you know he
[1:11:07] was he was you know in the in the the
[1:11:09] race for the for the White House God
[1:11:12] started you know speaking to my heart
[1:11:13] again about the last Trump the last
[1:11:16] Trump and I was actually going to put a
[1:11:18] a service together and then I realized
[1:11:20] that the service that Pastor Simon was
[1:11:22] going to minister was the one that I
[1:11:24] wanted to minister at
[1:11:25] because of the timing of what was being
[1:11:27] revealed to me you see everything is
[1:11:30] timing right but that's just the mind of
[1:11:32] God we can tap into those things at any
[1:11:35] time what where God wants us to allow us
[1:11:38] to tap in but it was in my mind in my
[1:11:40] thoughts and I was wondering oh praise
[1:11:42] God because I remember in 2016 when when
[1:11:45] when when President Trump was was was uh
[1:11:48] you know running for president I
[1:11:50] ministered a message on the last Trump
[1:11:53] back then and he ended up coming into
[1:11:56] Power amen and so I said well you know
[1:11:59] here it's coming back again but I
[1:12:01] couldn't quite understand it but then
[1:12:03] yesterday you know we're we're
[1:12:04] fellowshiping brother Mike says oh you
[1:12:06] know I listened to his a brother you
[1:12:08] know he's from I think Arizona and he
[1:12:10] was talking about the brother and he was
[1:12:11] saying you know he brought out a thought
[1:12:14] on on on uh on Trump you know now we
[1:12:17] know that
[1:12:21] Trump listen unless he's bir
[1:12:25] by the word of God a moment before he
[1:12:30] translates Christ is only using the
[1:12:34] vessel okay we see that God raised up
[1:12:38] many many individuals in the scriptures
[1:12:42] that were vessels of honor and dishonor
[1:12:46] amen I don't see God in that man but I
[1:12:49] see God keeping that man for a
[1:12:52] purpose that I do see amen amen but I
[1:12:56] don't see the Fulfillment of scripture
[1:12:58] other than how I tie it back to the word
[1:13:00] of God not as as an attribute of God I
[1:13:04] I'm sorry I I can't see those things not
[1:13:06] at this point okay but anyways we'll let
[1:13:10] we'll let the Holy Spirit interpret like
[1:13:11] I said but then he says yeah but the
[1:13:13] brother you know he brought out a good
[1:13:15] point he was ministering and that I
[1:13:17] believe was the mind of the Lord he says
[1:13:19] a president can only have two
[1:13:22] terms and this will be the last
[1:13:26] Trump because he'll only be able to run
[1:13:30] and be be be president in this term now
[1:13:32] that he's going to be president for four
[1:13:34] more years and so that'll make him the
[1:13:37] last
[1:13:39] Trump and how that ties back to
[1:13:41] scripture and how that pertains to us
[1:13:44] well God will interpret it but I believe
[1:13:46] he's got a great part to play in
[1:13:49] bringing about everything because he's a
[1:13:51] money man he's all about business he's
[1:13:55] the right kind of guy that can put a
[1:13:56] business deal together and man I'll tell
[1:13:59] you if anybody can put a business deal
[1:14:01] together it's
[1:14:03] Trump he doesn't care what he's got to
[1:14:05] do he can make it happen amen he has a
[1:14:08] way of putting business deals together
[1:14:10] and there's going to be business deals
[1:14:11] that are going to have to come together
[1:14:13] in order to fulfill
[1:14:14] prophecy where the where the Beast
[1:14:17] system is going to have to come into
[1:14:18] fullness and there's going to have to be
[1:14:20] a money deal and there's going to need
[1:14:21] to be uh uh you know where people will
[1:14:24] not be able to buy or sell and listen
[1:14:26] but you know what guess what we're not
[1:14:28] here for that we're gone before all of
[1:14:30] that but yet you are witnessing
[1:14:34] prophecy being
[1:14:36] Vindicated by modern
[1:14:39] events these things are this is a listen
[1:14:42] he holds the highest seat as a president
[1:14:47] on Earth because they look to the United
[1:14:49] States as the
[1:14:52] country okay now there's Russia Ria and
[1:14:55] there's China and they see themselves in
[1:14:57] certain ways but we know what brother
[1:14:59] brandham said we know exactly what the
[1:15:02] word says about America and how they
[1:15:05] started and how they're going to end
[1:15:07] amen and so we need to see prophetically
[1:15:11] where Trump fits in to the whole plan
[1:15:16] amen he fits in somewhere because we are
[1:15:20] here and these things are happening in
[1:15:22] our day praise God brother Philip amen
[1:15:26] I'm excited because I I'm seeing the
[1:15:29] word come into manifestation we we can't
[1:15:33] identify every little part but all God
[1:15:35] wants you to do is identify with the
[1:15:38] word that you are where do you fit in
[1:15:41] what are you are supposed to do in this
[1:15:44] day and in this hour how are you going
[1:15:46] to be a part of the body of Christ and
[1:15:48] manifest the word that's going to edify
[1:15:51] the body for your local church with
[1:15:55] which the whole local church is going to
[1:15:57] be caught up together we which are alive
[1:16:00] and remain shall not hinder them that
[1:16:02] sleep the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:16:05] first and we which are alive doesn't
[1:16:07] mean just us in the church here all the
[1:16:09] body of Christ wherever they all he said
[1:16:12] that he's going to bring together all
[1:16:14] things amen praise God he's going to
[1:16:17] draw them from this church that church
[1:16:19] from here from there from the north from
[1:16:21] the south from the East and the West
[1:16:23] they're going to they're going to be
[1:16:24] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:16:26] an eye amen praise God hallelujah and
[1:16:29] this is what we are looking uh toward
[1:16:32] Saints praise God hallelujah amen and so
[1:16:37] here now um let me go to
[1:16:43] uh the
[1:16:45] next so here Jesus was speaking in Luke
[1:16:49] and what what was he doing he was
[1:16:51] basically opening the scriptures to the
[1:16:56] disciples giving them a clear revelation
[1:16:59] of who they were okay who he was sorry
[1:17:03] and and and by the time that he got you
[1:17:06] know we talked about this last week when
[1:17:08] we had the Lord's Supper he was breaking
[1:17:10] the bread he was breaking the word to
[1:17:12] them he was unveiling the word to them
[1:17:15] he was making them aware of
[1:17:19] their their
[1:17:21] purpose they they they had a purpose in
[1:17:23] walking with him yes they were going to
[1:17:26] be the first church God Was preparing
[1:17:29] them giving them what they had need of
[1:17:31] opening the word to them opening their
[1:17:33] part in the word so that they could come
[1:17:36] into their position amen praise God and
[1:17:40] that's what he was doing he was
[1:17:41] expounding himself amen hallelujah and
[1:17:45] so here now in in Christ The Mystery of
[1:17:48] God revealed we want to move on here now
[1:17:52] because this message Christ mystery of
[1:17:54] God revealed I can't get enough of it I
[1:17:56] don't know about you but you need to go
[1:17:57] back and listen to it again listen to it
[1:18:00] again because it is so full of nuggets
[1:18:05] amen and and things where and and you
[1:18:08] you've heard it before you've listened
[1:18:09] to it before but let me tell you we are
[1:18:12] progressing into a season of the
[1:18:14] fullness of time and as we progress in
[1:18:18] the word of God you are going to hear
[1:18:20] things that you never heard before am
[1:18:23] because this book is it's got things in
[1:18:25] there that are Unwritten they're they're
[1:18:28] they're they're they're destined for a
[1:18:30] certain time and season amen it's it's
[1:18:34] not it's not going to be like you know
[1:18:37] don't put your own interpretation just
[1:18:39] listen feed on it and let you know go
[1:18:42] back and and and let these sermons you
[1:18:45] know stir you know go back listen and
[1:18:47] and you'll hear things that you never
[1:18:49] heard before and all of a sudden it just
[1:18:51] becomes more it makes more sense and I
[1:18:53] I'm just telling you all you're going to
[1:18:54] see is more of Christ amen and you're
[1:18:57] going to see him in you amen he goes
[1:18:59] here and he continues in the in Christ
[1:19:01] The Mystery of God revealed he says
[1:19:03] you've got to make the picture look
[1:19:05] right it's God's great picture and there
[1:19:09] is only one way you'll see it that when
[1:19:12] you see Jesus Christ there there is the
[1:19:16] entire Bible he's the principal theme of
[1:19:20] The Bible amen and so brother Brenham in
[1:19:24] 19 1963 he preached this message saying
[1:19:28] that he wanted to title this message
[1:19:30] based on the entire Bible go back listen
[1:19:35] he talks he says and I want to name it
[1:19:37] Christ The Mystery of God revealed and I
[1:19:39] want to base it not on the topic of the
[1:19:42] book not on the topic of redemption not
[1:19:47] on a topic he says upon the entire Bible
[1:19:51] right the whole book amen everything
[1:19:56] that that that we need every mystery
[1:19:58] every thing that that that we thought we
[1:20:02] knew was going to be was going to be
[1:20:05] revealed in a way like we had never
[1:20:07] heard it before but that's only if
[1:20:09] you've got an attribute if you've got
[1:20:13] election if in you was was the mind of
[1:20:16] God before the foundations of the world
[1:20:18] you were you were expressed for this
[1:20:21] time that's why in this time there will
[1:20:23] only be a group that going to receive it
[1:20:25] like when Jesus was on the earth how
[1:20:27] many actually received him like this is
[1:20:31] history there was a dozen that actually
[1:20:34] recognized and even then they had to
[1:20:36] come into their position in the word
[1:20:39] they had to feed on the word they had to
[1:20:41] be with him John would ask questions but
[1:20:45] then John that's why when you read the
[1:20:46] book of John John was was so close to
[1:20:49] Jesus because Jesus was giving him
[1:20:51] Revelation and upon revelation of of who
[1:20:55] he was and who Jesus Christ was the
[1:20:59] relationship you see that's what this is
[1:21:01] all about it's our relationship with him
[1:21:04] amen so the whole
[1:21:07] Bible was being uh this message of
[1:21:11] Christ The Mystery of God was based on
[1:21:13] the the entire word of God because he is
[1:21:16] the entire word of
[1:21:19] God he goes on and he says he is the
[1:21:22] principal theme of The Bible he was in
[1:21:25] the prophets he was in the Psalms he was
[1:21:29] in the history of the Bible the Bible is
[1:21:32] a prophetic book it's a historical book
[1:21:35] it's a book of love it's a book of songs
[1:21:38] it's a book of life and in there you
[1:21:41] find Christ he was in the prophets he
[1:21:44] was in the Psalms he was in the history
[1:21:47] and he also in the Bible is the things
[1:21:51] that is to Come Oh Glory to God you mean
[1:21:55] you mean there's things to come you mean
[1:21:58] that you mean the word is going to
[1:22:00] progress into our day and there's going
[1:22:03] to be things that that we're going to
[1:22:05] recognize and that we're going to hear
[1:22:06] in the word and that we're going to come
[1:22:08] to realize that's me that's that you
[1:22:11] mean you mean that's my time you mean my
[1:22:14] season is coming that where I've got to
[1:22:16] manifest the word of God you young
[1:22:18] people let me tell you you you you just
[1:22:21] don't realize but there's going to be a
[1:22:23] moment and there's going to be a a time
[1:22:25] if it hasn't already happened where you
[1:22:27] are going to realize that Jesus Christ
[1:22:30] is a reality and that he was not just in
[1:22:33] mommy and daddy telling you to come to
[1:22:35] church he's going to have to become real
[1:22:38] to you he's going to have to open
[1:22:41] himself up to you he's going to come
[1:22:43] into the deepest parts of your heart and
[1:22:46] your mind and your soul and he's going
[1:22:48] to discern situations and all the hurts
[1:22:51] and all the pains and all the heartaches
[1:22:54] and all the things that that that that
[1:22:56] that that have torn you apart over the
[1:22:58] years even being under you know even
[1:23:01] being brought up in this message there's
[1:23:04] a lot of young people that they were
[1:23:07] mishandled they were
[1:23:09] mishandled by their own parents because
[1:23:12] their own parents were living off law
[1:23:15] all they could do was put law put law
[1:23:17] but now the law has been set aside and
[1:23:20] Grace has
[1:23:22] come until Grace comes com into your
[1:23:25] life you'll just know everything by law
[1:23:28] you'll just oh that's because my parents
[1:23:29] said so no you need to you need to be
[1:23:32] able to say because the word says so
[1:23:35] because the word tells me who I am not
[1:23:37] my parents my parents told me I was a
[1:23:39] bum that I'd probably amount to nothing
[1:23:42] because I was I was rebelling against
[1:23:44] the word and there's things we said to
[1:23:46] our children that we need to go back and
[1:23:48] say I'm
[1:23:50] sorry we need to make those kinds of
[1:23:52] things right so that we can get things
[1:23:54] things in the right perspective so that
[1:23:56] they can have the same experience that
[1:23:58] you've got the reality of God
[1:24:02] personal he comes to everybody at
[1:24:06] different
[1:24:07] times hallelujah praise God
[1:24:10] Amen and he says here he he was the
[1:24:14] Psalms he was in the history and he also
[1:24:18] in the Bible is the things that is to
[1:24:20] come so he was before until after after
[1:24:24] what does that make him then the same
[1:24:27] yesterday
[1:24:29] today and forever he will do the same
[1:24:33] things that he's done for you he'll do
[1:24:35] them for your friends for your family
[1:24:38] for your loved ones for your children
[1:24:41] for your husband or for your wife he
[1:24:43] will do the same thing because he is not
[1:24:47] the respector of persons he said my
[1:24:51] sheep hear my voice all that the father
[1:24:55] hath given me will come not one of them
[1:24:59] will be lost I don't care you might you
[1:25:02] might say my son's a bum my daughter's
[1:25:04] not going to make it they're serpent
[1:25:06] seed they're you know this person my
[1:25:09] boss he's serpent seed this one here
[1:25:11] he's this he's that let me tell you
[1:25:13] something God took what looked like
[1:25:16] serpent
[1:25:17] seed okay I don't know about you but you
[1:25:20] just look at your own life it didn't
[1:25:22] reflect Jesus Christ at at all I I
[1:25:26] sometimes I wonder and I say my God but
[1:25:28] you know what while we were yet
[1:25:32] sinners while we were yet in that
[1:25:35] unbelief and in in that adultery and in
[1:25:37] that fornication and in that we were we
[1:25:40] were believing this and believing that
[1:25:42] he still loved you because you are a
[1:25:45] part of him you were with him when when
[1:25:48] when he was expressing all of these
[1:25:50] thoughts in his mind before the
[1:25:52] foundations of the world
[1:25:54] he he he saw you exactly the way he
[1:25:57] wants you to be and you are going to be
[1:26:00] that because he cannot he said my word
[1:26:03] shall not return void and if you are the
[1:26:07] word that went forth you can't be void
[1:26:10] you've got to express him you've got to
[1:26:13] show Christ you've got to bring him on
[1:26:15] the scene amen praise God hallelujah
[1:26:18] glory to God he's the same yesterday
[1:26:21] today and forever amen glory to God he
[1:26:25] says listen he says wherefore in First
[1:26:28] Peter and it's not up there but I've got
[1:26:30] it in my notes Here 1 Peter 1:13 he says
[1:26:32] wherefore gir up the loins of your mind
[1:26:35] be sober and hope to the
[1:26:39] end for the grace that is to be brought
[1:26:42] unto you at the revelation of Jesus
[1:26:46] Christ Jesus Christ is going to
[1:26:49] reveal himself to you personal am what
[1:26:54] is the revelation of Jesus Christ it's
[1:26:56] the opening of the word it's where the
[1:26:59] word becomes your life becomes your
[1:27:02] reality becomes your absolute amen
[1:27:05] you're not going to rely on the word of
[1:27:07] man anymore you're although you're going
[1:27:09] to listen to the word of man you're
[1:27:10] going to reason with the word of man but
[1:27:12] the word that is revealed to you
[1:27:14] remember it's revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:27:18] This Book of Revelation if you look at
[1:27:20] it the Revelation means a apocalypse
[1:27:23] people think it's a apocalypse meaning
[1:27:25] some some great you know terrible
[1:27:28] destructive events no a apocalypse if
[1:27:30] you go look at the actual meaning it's
[1:27:34] revealing it's the revealing the
[1:27:37] revealing of Jesus Christ that's why
[1:27:39] it's the revelation of Jesus Christ and
[1:27:43] the whole book of Revelation it's all in
[1:27:45] symbols it's all symbols and it's all
[1:27:48] written in certain ways and unless the
[1:27:50] revelation of Christ the Holy Ghost is
[1:27:53] in you it's just a book and you and most
[1:27:55] people they can't understand it they
[1:27:58] can't put it all together they don't
[1:28:00] understand what it means that and a lamb
[1:28:02] stood a bleeding lamb before the
[1:28:05] foundations of the world and he had a
[1:28:07] book in his hand they don't understand
[1:28:10] what that was all about but that's what
[1:28:12] we're going to be looking at here that's
[1:28:14] what we that's what's being revealed
[1:28:16] right now that's going to Quicken us
[1:28:18] it's going to give us faith for a
[1:28:21] Rapture there has to be something in the
[1:28:23] word that's going to change our mortal
[1:28:25] bodies we're going to put on
[1:28:27] incorruption because right now we're
[1:28:29] Incorruptible bodies we're we're we're
[1:28:32] having corruptible situations in our
[1:28:34] lives we're we're facing circumstances
[1:28:37] that we don't want in our lives and
[1:28:39] God's going to give us the faith to
[1:28:41] break out of those things for so that
[1:28:44] those things can fall away from our
[1:28:46] lives and that we're not going to be all
[1:28:47] caught up into those things amen he's
[1:28:50] lifting the veil so that we can
[1:28:53] recognize the Mysteries that were
[1:28:55] released when those seals unlocked the
[1:29:01] book hallelujah praise God forever more
[1:29:05] now he says here in the message the
[1:29:08] seventh seal he says now the eighth
[1:29:10] chapter only reveals the
[1:29:13] scene the scene of the seventh seal
[1:29:16] where nothing else is revealed notice
[1:29:19] that there was just a half hour of
[1:29:21] Silence when that seal was opened
[1:29:24] now nothing is not revealed in the
[1:29:27] seventh seal now he has something to now
[1:29:32] has nothing to do with the seventh
[1:29:34] chapter of Revelation has nothing to do
[1:29:37] with chapter
[1:29:39] 7 chapter 8 you see this is the whole
[1:29:42] thing that's why thank God he sent a
[1:29:46] prophet thank God he sent Malachi 4
[1:29:50] thank God he sent Revelations 10 1-7 so
[1:29:53] that there could be a seventh Messenger
[1:29:55] on the earth that would be able to take
[1:29:57] the word just like Luther Luther was at
[1:30:00] a at a certain appointed time and season
[1:30:03] right in the Catholic church and God
[1:30:05] decides to go and visit him and open the
[1:30:08] word to him and say the just shall live
[1:30:11] by faith Martin Martin all these
[1:30:16] teachings that you've been uh under and
[1:30:18] all these Catholic doctrines and you
[1:30:21] know you got to have a a priest that's
[1:30:22] got to absolve you of your sins and
[1:30:24] you've got to go through a a a Holy
[1:30:27] Father and you've got to have a p no he
[1:30:28] says no he says the just those that are
[1:30:32] that are Sons and Daughters what you're
[1:30:34] trying to be Martin you're trying I I
[1:30:37] see that your heart is for me he says
[1:30:40] you need Revelation you're going to live
[1:30:42] by Revelation and when that struck him
[1:30:46] all of a sudden now he could read the
[1:30:48] word himself he could see himself in the
[1:30:51] word of God he could see that hey wait a
[1:30:53] minute this is all about me this is not
[1:30:55] about me interpreting it for somebody
[1:30:58] else and putting my own interpretation
[1:30:59] on it and that's why the Reformation
[1:31:02] took place and started with Martin
[1:31:05] Luther because that was the breaking
[1:31:07] away of the Holy Spirit allowing the
[1:31:10] word now to be restored so that it could
[1:31:12] come through and come down through
[1:31:15] Martin Luther then John Wesley on on on
[1:31:18] on uh uh being Sanctified by the word of
[1:31:22] God to Pentecost which was to receive
[1:31:26] the Holy Ghost and receiving the Holy
[1:31:28] Ghost makes makes way for Christ
[1:31:32] himself that's why a lot of people can
[1:31:34] receive the Holy Ghost they can speak in
[1:31:37] tongues they can get the sensations they
[1:31:40] can sing like Angels they can prophesy
[1:31:43] they can do all those things but if
[1:31:45] behind that is not an
[1:31:48] attribute God
[1:31:50] himself then that Spirit can lie that
[1:31:54] Spirit can can deceive that's why
[1:31:56] brother Bram says man he says I I seen
[1:31:59] one guy he was he was prophesying and
[1:32:02] and anointed like crazy and another one
[1:32:05] here prophesying and anointed but then
[1:32:07] God gave the prophet the ability to
[1:32:10] discern the lives and he says that man
[1:32:13] was living like a devil that man had all
[1:32:16] kinds of unbelief but yet he was in the
[1:32:17] church because he had only received a
[1:32:20] baptism and you need more than the
[1:32:22] baptism the baptism just makes you makes
[1:32:25] you susceptible for for for the word
[1:32:28] himself to come personal directly to you
[1:32:32] to where now he'll speak to you and
[1:32:34] he'll say now listen you need to go into
[1:32:36] that tub over there you need to be
[1:32:38] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you
[1:32:41] you want to be my wife then you got to
[1:32:43] take my name my name is Jesus you need
[1:32:46] to be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:32:48] Christ and if that attribute is not
[1:32:51] there that person will turn around and
[1:32:52] say I already got baptized
[1:32:55] I was baptized when I was a
[1:32:56] baby that's not scriptural the word is
[1:33:00] speaking to you can the word go against
[1:33:04] his own word never can do it that's why
[1:33:07] if your life doesn't reflect an uh the
[1:33:11] word of God so baptism he that believeth
[1:33:15] and is baptized how does a baby believe
[1:33:18] oh but my parents believed and so I can
[1:33:21] just live any way I want
[1:33:24] because my parents believe for me they
[1:33:25] baptize me so when I die I'm going to go
[1:33:27] to heaven but I can live any way I want
[1:33:31] but yet God wants to come into your life
[1:33:34] wants to place you into the body because
[1:33:37] you were brought here to this Earth for
[1:33:39] a purpose and you need to and until a
[1:33:42] person really discovers their purpose
[1:33:44] they can never be fully satisfied I
[1:33:46] don't care what anybody says you'll look
[1:33:49] to money to get satisfaction you'll look
[1:33:51] to sex you'll look to food you'll look
[1:33:53] to all these things and you'll get
[1:33:55] temporary
[1:33:57] satisfaction but Jesus when he went to
[1:33:59] that woman at the well he says you'll
[1:34:01] never thirst again if I give you a drink
[1:34:03] of this and let me tell you I don't
[1:34:07] thirst anymore I don't thirst for the
[1:34:09] things of the world anymore I use the
[1:34:12] things of the world for the for the
[1:34:14] benefit and for the glory of God but my
[1:34:16] purpose and my life and my whole focus
[1:34:19] is the word and what he's got planned
[1:34:22] for me and I know that that that this
[1:34:24] world is falling apart and I know that
[1:34:26] he's got something that's going to take
[1:34:29] us out of here so that we don't have to
[1:34:31] go into that amen praise God and that's
[1:34:33] his word and so that is different when
[1:34:38] you've received the Holy Ghost and the
[1:34:41] connection now wakens that you were
[1:34:44] always a daughter of
[1:34:46] God and when I say daughter of God
[1:34:49] remember Adam and
[1:34:50] Eve in the garden before before there
[1:34:54] was Adam and Eve read it go back and
[1:34:57] read the scriptures it's all there after
[1:34:59] you hear messages like this where the
[1:35:01] word is being unveiled you go back and
[1:35:04] you read it you're going to see things
[1:35:06] differently you're going to see that
[1:35:08] Adam was expressed in the very image of
[1:35:11] God he was God what he did was he
[1:35:15] expressed himself in human
[1:35:17] form as Adam and in Adam was both male
[1:35:22] and female amen because in God is both
[1:35:25] male and female but God what he did was
[1:35:28] when he took
[1:35:30] Adam he separated the female from the
[1:35:34] womb of the man and called it
[1:35:37] woman and she was now the female
[1:35:41] aspect of Adam because remember this is
[1:35:45] all about the Plan of
[1:35:46] Redemption the whole Paradox is that we
[1:35:49] got to go back to God's Plan of
[1:35:52] Redemption cuz without understanding The
[1:35:54] Plan of Redemption this is all
[1:35:58] confusing why would God allow Eve to
[1:36:01] fall why God knew that you know why
[1:36:04] allow her to fall why not just you know
[1:36:07] play out the plan exactly the way
[1:36:09] because he wanted to be a
[1:36:12] redeemer don't ask me what and why God
[1:36:15] does what he does all I know is that I'm
[1:36:18] rejoicing in the part of
[1:36:22] redemption it's is wonderful to know
[1:36:24] that that we we actually are fulfilling
[1:36:26] the portion of redemption so when Adam
[1:36:29] you go back and read it when he when he
[1:36:31] first expressed Adam it says and he
[1:36:34] called their name Adam and Eve had not
[1:36:37] even been expressed yet because God saw
[1:36:40] his Plan of Redemption God saw that he
[1:36:43] was going to have a church because Eve
[1:36:45] is an is is a is a type of the end time
[1:36:48] Church she was the one that fell at the
[1:36:51] beginning but the second the Bible says
[1:36:54] was Jesus Christ who is a quickening
[1:36:57] spirit that is going to take the bride
[1:36:59] take all the Amnesia off of her awaken
[1:37:03] her to the understanding of who she is
[1:37:05] in the word of God so that she can come
[1:37:07] into her rightful position as the bride
[1:37:11] the wife the word made flesh in her
[1:37:15] day amen glory to God hallelujah I know
[1:37:19] that's a mouthful but go back read pray
[1:37:23] and see see what the Holy Spirit reveals
[1:37:25] to you and you will see that that
[1:37:28] everything was the expression of God is
[1:37:32] all the expression of God hallelujah
[1:37:36] amen praise God so here now he says now
[1:37:40] the eighth chapter only reveals the
[1:37:42] scene the scene of the seventh seal
[1:37:44] where nothing else is revealed now
[1:37:46] nothing is not revealed in the seventh
[1:37:48] seal now has nothing to do with the
[1:37:51] seventh chapter of Revelation it's the
[1:37:53] revealing of the seventh seal is
[1:37:57] perfectly
[1:38:00] mute there was silence in heaven when
[1:38:02] that seventh seal was open why what's
[1:38:05] going
[1:38:06] on thank God we had a prophet thank God
[1:38:12] that the word has been
[1:38:14] revealed amen he goes on to say here he
[1:38:18] says and if and if I only had time I'd
[1:38:21] try a few places to show you all the way
[1:38:25] back from Genesis this seventh chapter
[1:38:28] this seventh seal is spoke of from the
[1:38:32] very beginning in Genesis this seventh
[1:38:35] seal these seals moved right on up so
[1:38:39] here he is he's saying now it's all
[1:38:41] silent it's all mute but then he says
[1:38:43] but if I had some time and this is what
[1:38:46] we're doing we're the ones that are that
[1:38:49] have the time we're the ones that have
[1:38:51] received the Revelation we're the ones
[1:38:53] that the word has been opened up to now
[1:38:55] that we can go back into the word of God
[1:38:58] and he's saying that that seventh seal
[1:39:01] was being
[1:39:02] revealed already in the Book of
[1:39:05] Genesis but yet it was the unwritten
[1:39:08] aspect of the
[1:39:09] book we're going to be we're going to be
[1:39:12] moving into because you know one of the
[1:39:14] things that that I've learned you know
[1:39:17] as a minister now is that you preach a
[1:39:20] message with the end in mind sure
[1:39:23] because you're moving towards something
[1:39:25] that that that God has revealed but God
[1:39:28] needs to bring it in a way where
[1:39:30] bite-size you can receive a a young one
[1:39:32] can receive a little bit the Lambs can
[1:39:34] receive it the sheep that you know feed
[1:39:37] my Lambs feed my sheep God wants
[1:39:39] everybody to catch their portion here
[1:39:42] amen new Believers people that are just
[1:39:45] coming in that have never heard the word
[1:39:47] in this way is because it's a time and a
[1:39:50] season for all things this is your time
[1:39:54] this is your season it's not because you
[1:39:57] you by chance no it wasn't by chance
[1:39:59] that I just went I didn't know Gabriel
[1:40:01] for ready I had no idea who he was but
[1:40:04] my partner said oh my wife deals with
[1:40:06] this guy he does he makes beautiful
[1:40:08] Furniture go see him tell him that my
[1:40:10] wife sent you he'll give you a good deal
[1:40:12] I said okay I need Furniture I had no
[1:40:15] idea that there was an attribute in that
[1:40:19] vessel that had an appointment with
[1:40:21] another attribute
[1:40:24] I had no idea but all he did was he
[1:40:26] handed me a tape he didn't understand he
[1:40:29] I said man you gave me an amazing deal
[1:40:31] this is incredible he asked me are you a
[1:40:33] Christian I said I don't know I was
[1:40:36] brought up Roman Catholic I said but if
[1:40:39] that's Christianity I'm a hypocrite man
[1:40:41] I just told him straight oh he goes
[1:40:43] that's
[1:40:44] good you know if you got to know brother
[1:40:46] Gabe to understand that he says well
[1:40:49] that's good he in his mind he was going
[1:40:52] oh my God
[1:40:53] finally somebody that that that that
[1:40:55] that that you know that that that that
[1:40:57] that's really you know saying the right
[1:40:59] thing man okay here listen to
[1:41:02] this I had no idea but there was an
[1:41:05] Awakening in a time and a season for
[1:41:07] every one of us we don't know when it's
[1:41:10] going to you could be in this message
[1:41:11] for 20
[1:41:13] years and this morning God lifts the
[1:41:16] veil amen he could just remove the the
[1:41:19] the the the blinders on your eyes
[1:41:21] because of tradition because of things
[1:41:23] that you were taught because of how you
[1:41:25] interpret things we don't want to put
[1:41:28] our own interpretation on things we want
[1:41:30] to let the Holy Spirit just in the
[1:41:32] Simplicity unveil himself and make
[1:41:35] himself real to us personal Hallelujah
[1:41:39] he says this seventh seal is spoke of
[1:41:42] from the very beginning in Genesis so
[1:41:44] here let's go to the next slide and he
[1:41:48] says you know in the beginning God
[1:41:50] created the heavens and the Earth right
[1:41:53] from the very beginning God Elohim the
[1:41:56] self-existent one if you go back and you
[1:41:59] study the actual you know words and you
[1:42:02] take God it's not God God is a word that
[1:42:05] was put into writing the actual word is
[1:42:08] Elohim self-existent one one that was
[1:42:13] was all omniscient omnipresent could
[1:42:16] create worlds because the Bible says
[1:42:18] that the worlds were framed by the word
[1:42:21] of God all God had to do was think a
[1:42:25] thought but once it becomes
[1:42:28] word it it expresses it
[1:42:31] manifests that's why you you were
[1:42:33] walking you're just a walking soul on
[1:42:36] Earth but inside of you by election by
[1:42:41] predestination from before the
[1:42:43] foundations of the world when you were
[1:42:46] coming out of your mother's womb and
[1:42:49] that baby that body was living off of
[1:42:51] the mother
[1:42:53] it would feed off the mother it would
[1:42:55] Breathe off the mother it was living off
[1:42:58] of the mother but until that baby was
[1:43:00] delivered from the
[1:43:02] womb a breath of life came into that
[1:43:06] which is the soul and that Soul had an
[1:43:10] attribute in it if it was an attribute
[1:43:14] of God the Bible says there are children
[1:43:19] of God and there are
[1:43:21] children of the wicked one that's why
[1:43:25] you got to go back to Genesis remember
[1:43:27] Genesis is the seed book for all things
[1:43:30] everything that originated originated in
[1:43:32] the Book of Genesis you got to go back
[1:43:34] there and you're going to see that Eve
[1:43:36] was not defiled by eating an apple she
[1:43:38] was defiled by a sex act with the
[1:43:42] serpent and two children were born Cain
[1:43:45] and Abel one's a murderer the other one
[1:43:49] has a revelation to bring the right
[1:43:52] sacrifice God
[1:43:53] receives Abel's sacrifice because God
[1:43:56] revealed to Abel that it was going to
[1:43:57] need to be a lamb of blood that would
[1:44:00] need to give life in order to redeem
[1:44:03] life see God was expressing the whole
[1:44:05] Plan of Redemption right back there in
[1:44:07] the Book of Genesis everything was being
[1:44:10] expressed right there Eve was a type of
[1:44:12] the church she was going to fall just
[1:44:14] like this church today you've got all
[1:44:16] kinds of denominational churches but
[1:44:18] they've rejected the word of God they
[1:44:21] they'll tell you that we believe God but
[1:44:22] then you when you tell them simple
[1:44:24] little things like baptism in jesus'
[1:44:26] name or you know Trinity and you try to
[1:44:29] explain to them that there's only one
[1:44:30] God the Jehovah of the Old Testament is
[1:44:33] Jesus of the New Testament there's no
[1:44:35] three Gods God is not going to there's
[1:44:38] amateur Gods which are the sons and
[1:44:40] daughters of God the attributes of God
[1:44:42] but it's all God expressing
[1:44:46] himself and this is the fellowship
[1:44:49] that's why there's Fellowship in the
[1:44:51] body of Christ and so here now listen to
[1:44:54] Revelations 4 10-11 the four and 20
[1:44:58] Elders fell down before him does it say
[1:45:02] them but I thought there was
[1:45:06] three no him that sat on the throne and
[1:45:10] worshiped him it doesn't say
[1:45:13] them nowhere does it ever say
[1:45:16] them that liveth forever and ever and
[1:45:19] cast crowns Before the Throne saying
[1:45:22] thou Art Worthy oh Lord it doesn't say
[1:45:27] Lords Lord Jesus
[1:45:30] Christ Lord father Jesus Son Christ the
[1:45:35] Holy Ghost but all three are the same
[1:45:38] person his name was
[1:45:40] Jesus on Earth amen that's just a name
[1:45:44] remember you know names okay words
[1:45:48] there's so much more to words we have to
[1:45:49] go beyond the words we got to go into
[1:45:51] the logos the mind the thought that was
[1:45:54] in the word that's what that's where we
[1:45:59] awaken thou oh Lord to receive glory and
[1:46:03] honor and power for thou has created all
[1:46:07] things does it say some things all
[1:46:11] things when Jesus rose from the dead in
[1:46:13] Matthew 28:19 he come before the
[1:46:16] disciples he was in his theophany body
[1:46:18] he took he he moved into his theophany
[1:46:21] again just like under the order of of
[1:46:23] mzc we're going to be looking at all
[1:46:24] that next week but look he comes and he
[1:46:26] stands there before them and he says all
[1:46:29] power read it go back and read it
[1:46:32] Matthew 28 19 all power did he say some
[1:46:36] power he said all a l has been given
[1:46:41] unto me in heaven and on Earth is there
[1:46:44] any other power is there any other Lord
[1:46:49] no he said all power has been given unto
[1:46:51] me now go into all the world and this is
[1:46:55] where you know they take they they took
[1:46:58] the the trinitarian doctrine and the
[1:47:00] baptism in the name of the father and of
[1:47:02] the son because he goes now go ye into
[1:47:04] all the word
[1:47:07] world baptizing them in the name read it
[1:47:13] of the father and of the son and of the
[1:47:16] Holy Ghost and Peter was right there who
[1:47:19] they claim was the first pope which he
[1:47:21] wasn't he was right there when when
[1:47:24] Jesus said those words and you go read
[1:47:26] ma Acts 2:38 where where they went to
[1:47:29] Peter and the disciples after they were
[1:47:31] ministering and filled with the Holy
[1:47:32] Ghost preaching to the people and said
[1:47:34] what must we do to be
[1:47:36] saved Peter read it said repent every
[1:47:41] one of you turn away from your your your
[1:47:44] your Traditions your doctrines what you
[1:47:46] thought was the truth repent that's what
[1:47:48] repent
[1:47:49] means and be baptized in the name name
[1:47:53] of Jesus Christ that's what he said and
[1:47:56] 3,000 people were baptized go to Acts 19
[1:48:00] you'll hear it again and they were he
[1:48:02] asked them how are you baptized he's
[1:48:04] asking them clearly he says I can see
[1:48:05] that you're disciples and you you're
[1:48:07] praising the Lord Jesus and everything
[1:48:09] else just like you can go into churches
[1:48:10] and they'll be in there saying
[1:48:11] hallelujah praise the Lord and you go to
[1:48:13] them you say how are you
[1:48:15] baptized now you don't want to be doing
[1:48:17] that in a way like you know you're
[1:48:18] trying to show something because this is
[1:48:21] revealed this is something that God God
[1:48:23] calls God calls so all you want to do is
[1:48:25] you want to Fellowship you want to talk
[1:48:27] about the word of God we we can't
[1:48:29] convince people you try to convince
[1:48:32] somebody to come into this church I'll
[1:48:34] guarantee you another person will
[1:48:35] convince them out yeah okay you got to
[1:48:38] let them come by their own free moral
[1:48:40] agency let the Holy Spirit speak to them
[1:48:42] by the word of God faith cometh by
[1:48:43] hearing God chose the foolishness of
[1:48:46] preaching to call his sons and daughters
[1:48:49] so that they could receive the word and
[1:48:50] come to their position in Christ
[1:48:53] amen we don't want to convince
[1:48:55] nobody but you you you you you just let
[1:48:58] them know how are you baptized and
[1:48:59] they'll tell you they they don't even
[1:49:00] know a lot of people oh I got baptized
[1:49:03] at the church you know do you remember
[1:49:04] how the minister baptized you because if
[1:49:07] the minister doesn't have a
[1:49:09] revelation to impart faith faith cometh
[1:49:13] by hearing the word and if he's got a
[1:49:15] revelation and he's baptizing you in the
[1:49:18] name of the Lord Jesus Christ under a
[1:49:21] revelation of God
[1:49:23] than that anointing God is obligated by
[1:49:26] his word he says repent be baptized in
[1:49:28] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you
[1:49:30] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:49:33] Ghost that's God's promise that's not
[1:49:36] your promise you can't make that promise
[1:49:37] that's God's promise God calls God uh he
[1:49:41] that's why when when when the disciples
[1:49:43] were there and the people were leaving
[1:49:44] him because remember it was only a few
[1:49:46] that recognized who he actually was and
[1:49:48] they turned around said Lord how come
[1:49:49] they're all leaving how come they're
[1:49:51] going he turned around says unto you it
[1:49:55] has been given and I'll I'll just I'll
[1:49:58] elaborate on that unto you I gave the
[1:50:01] Revelation the logos the thinking the
[1:50:03] mind the thought what I meant and what I
[1:50:06] what I what I wanted to you to to see is
[1:50:10] what I revealed unto youall but he says
[1:50:13] but unto them read it it has not been
[1:50:16] given he says my sheep hear my voice and
[1:50:21] they won't follow any other once you've
[1:50:24] heard his voice and I'm not talking
[1:50:26] about my voice I'm not talking about
[1:50:28] some preacher's voice I'm talking about
[1:50:31] that voice on the inside of the inside
[1:50:33] that you know that my God this is truth
[1:50:36] I cannot deny this you you you you just
[1:50:39] realize it's it's absolute truth like
[1:50:41] I'm seeing it I can't help it that's why
[1:50:44] Jesus said when I give you that
[1:50:45] Revelation don't worry he says the Gates
[1:50:48] of Hell will not Prevail against it
[1:50:50] nobody will take it out of you because
[1:50:52] that'll be me in you on that day you
[1:50:55] shall know that I am in the father ye in
[1:50:57] me and I in you Christ in you your hope
[1:51:02] of glory your hope of Salvation it's
[1:51:05] Christ in you knowing that you've come
[1:51:07] into a
[1:51:09] relationship hallelujah praise God we're
[1:51:12] almost we're almost there so what is
[1:51:16] it it's Christ it's god let's go to the
[1:51:20] next scripture we're going to finish up
[1:51:22] off with just a few scriptures here to
[1:51:24] show you the deity of God and how God
[1:51:27] was going to operate and how he did it
[1:51:29] through Christ how he's the same
[1:51:31] yesterday today and forever and how he's
[1:51:33] going to do it through you and me
[1:51:36] everything that he did when he came here
[1:51:38] on Earth as Jesus Christ he was the
[1:51:43] second Adam remember three things got to
[1:51:45] be restored from the Garden of Eden
[1:51:48] because the original plan was Adam and
[1:51:50] Eve in the garden they were given
[1:51:51] dominion over over all the Earth go back
[1:51:53] and read it whatever Adam named it
[1:51:56] that's what it was why because he had
[1:51:58] the book he had the Revelation he had
[1:52:01] the whole plan he had the whole Mind Of
[1:52:04] God he was God expressed and he could
[1:52:08] name anything he could tell the tree to
[1:52:10] move from here and go to there he he was
[1:52:12] eternal there there was no death God
[1:52:15] said the day you eat thereof that day
[1:52:17] you shall surely die and when she went
[1:52:19] and made love with that serpent the Veil
[1:52:22] was lifted off of them because she went
[1:52:24] back and and and Adam knowing the Plan
[1:52:27] of Redemption knowing that what his wife
[1:52:30] had just done knowing that that that
[1:52:33] because she did that death had to there
[1:52:37] was going to be death because the word
[1:52:38] said the day you eat thereof you shall
[1:52:40] surely die he knew that so he says I got
[1:52:43] to give myself and that's why he gave
[1:52:47] himself with her he took on her sin like
[1:52:52] Jesus Christ when he went to the cross
[1:52:53] and he took our sin on him so that he
[1:52:56] could redeem Eve amen and Eve now was
[1:53:01] was was being redeemed and now Christ
[1:53:04] knowing what he was doing
[1:53:09] he became
[1:53:11] sin so that we could become him right
[1:53:15] but notice what they did read the
[1:53:18] scriptures they went hid themselves
[1:53:20] because they knew they were naked
[1:53:23] why does eating an
[1:53:25] apple make somebody aware that they're
[1:53:28] naked if that's the case we need to go
[1:53:30] into all the bars where the women are
[1:53:33] dressing with nothing and hand out
[1:53:36] Apples because they need to wake up
[1:53:39] they're naked but the Bible said that it
[1:53:42] that in the last days in the time of
[1:53:43] leod DEA they would be naked wretched
[1:53:46] miserable blind and don't know
[1:53:51] it but but that's not their
[1:53:54] fault they need the
[1:53:56] word and if you are the word to them
[1:54:00] then they got an opportunity to wake up
[1:54:03] out of their Amnesia of who they thought
[1:54:05] they were and come into a recognition of
[1:54:08] who they really are they're Sons or
[1:54:10] Daughters of God expressing the word
[1:54:12] amen praise God hallelujah amen glory
[1:54:16] let's go to the next scripture here in
[1:54:17] John 1 1:4 in the beginning was the word
[1:54:20] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:54:23] was God the same was in the beginning
[1:54:25] with God all things that were made
[1:54:28] listen all things that were made by
[1:54:32] him all things were made by him and
[1:54:34] without him was nothing
[1:54:37] anything was not anything made that was
[1:54:40] ever
[1:54:41] made now is there another
[1:54:44] Creator God
[1:54:47] Alone in him was life and the life was
[1:54:50] the light of men and listen in John 1:10
[1:54:53] he says he was in the world and the
[1:54:56] world was made by him who's who they
[1:54:59] talking
[1:55:00] about Jesus Christ and the world knew
[1:55:04] him
[1:55:08] not glory for there are three that bear
[1:55:12] record in heaven the Father the word and
[1:55:16] the Holy Ghost and these three
[1:55:19] are one
[1:55:24] H this book is becoming more real and
[1:55:28] more real as we move along here Hebrews
[1:55:32] let the musicians come we just got a
[1:55:34] couple more scriptures in the book of
[1:55:36] Hebrews he says
[1:55:40] here um now Faith is the substance of
[1:55:43] things hoped for the evidence of Things
[1:55:46] Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a
[1:55:50] good report
[1:55:52] through faith we understand that the
[1:55:55] what the
[1:55:56] worlds I don't know how many worlds have
[1:55:59] been in the past there may have been
[1:56:02] other civilizations and I believe there
[1:56:04] was a lot of people say oh you talk
[1:56:06] about the Bible you're so you're so
[1:56:08] shortterm
[1:56:10] minded no I'm talking about the Plan of
[1:56:13] Redemption for this world right now
[1:56:16] there is no other plan you want to go
[1:56:20] back before this world and you want to
[1:56:22] try to figure out what God did before
[1:56:24] this world go ahead but that's already
[1:56:27] done what's
[1:56:29] concerned what's concerning you now is
[1:56:32] what you need to come
[1:56:34] into context with amen through faith we
[1:56:39] understand that the worlds were framed
[1:56:41] by the word of God so that things which
[1:56:43] are seen were not made of things which
[1:56:46] do
[1:56:47] appear you
[1:56:50] cannot fathom God God is his own
[1:56:53] interpreter he will bring things to pass
[1:56:56] in his time and in his
[1:56:59] season next scripture Ephesians unto me
[1:57:03] who am less than the least of all the
[1:57:05] saints is this Grace given that I should
[1:57:08] preach among the Gentiles The
[1:57:10] unsearchable Riches of Christ what are
[1:57:12] the unsearchable riches of Christ the
[1:57:15] things that we've been fellowshipping on
[1:57:16] here this morning the hidden mysteries
[1:57:19] of God's word and guess who the hidden
[1:57:21] Myster are you coming into manifestation
[1:57:26] recognizing your
[1:57:28] position the world is looking for
[1:57:30] Mysteries yet one is standing right
[1:57:33] there in front of them when you're
[1:57:34] testifying of the word of God and you're
[1:57:35] telling them God has sent his word and I
[1:57:38] believe the word and the word is now
[1:57:40] living in me manifesting through me
[1:57:43] listen he says and to make all men see
[1:57:46] what is the Fellowship of the mystery
[1:57:49] this is what we this is what we're
[1:57:51] feasting on this morning morning which
[1:57:52] from the beginning of the world hath
[1:57:54] been hid in Christ it's always been in
[1:57:59] Christ and that's why the book has to be
[1:58:02] open and that's what we're going to be
[1:58:04] looking at next week he says who created
[1:58:06] All Things by Jesus Christ amen praise
[1:58:10] God Colossians 1:12 to20 but before I go
[1:58:13] there I want to read a quote
[1:58:15] here brother Braham speaking he says and
[1:58:18] I stood there a little bit till the Holy
[1:58:21] Spirit revealed it I said the entire
[1:58:24] Bible as much as being revealed to man
[1:58:28] through
[1:58:29] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:58:32] of the Holy Ghost the baptism in jesus'
[1:58:35] name and all these things has being
[1:58:38] revealed but there is secrets that's hid
[1:58:42] inside because the Bible is sealed with
[1:58:45] Seven
[1:58:46] Seals and that's why that you got to
[1:58:49] read the book of Revelation you got to
[1:58:50] see Revelation 10 1-7 you've got to
[1:58:53] recognize that God sent another
[1:58:56] messenger in the in the full restoration
[1:58:59] of the word by the name of William
[1:59:01] Branham you need to see his placing in
[1:59:03] the word of God so that you can see that
[1:59:06] through that Ministry Christ himself
[1:59:09] came down put one foot on the land one
[1:59:11] on the sea to open those seals to open
[1:59:16] the Mysteries that were in the book
[1:59:18] because the Bible said in Revelations
[1:59:20] 1:10 he stood there and he had a book
[1:59:25] open it was an open book that the mighty
[1:59:27] Angel stood there so that book contains
[1:59:31] things that we need to understand
[1:59:33] because in there is our placing in the
[1:59:36] word of God so that we can fulfill our
[1:59:39] part so that this world can go on to the
[1:59:41] next stage after the Rapture is
[1:59:45] fulfilled so he says here the Bible is
[1:59:47] sealed with Seven Seals I must go there
[1:59:50] to find it that morning who when those
[1:59:54] seven angels come down and blasted the
[1:59:57] Earth and rocks flew Every Way Seven
[2:00:00] Angels stood there and said Return to
[2:00:03] Jeffersonville from where you come from
[2:00:05] for the Seven Seals of the seven
[2:00:08] Mysteries will be
[2:00:11] opened and we thank God that the book
[2:00:16] has been
[2:00:18] opened he in Christ the mystery he has
[2:00:22] shown or revealed it in every type that
[2:00:25] it's in the Bible therefore the entire
[2:00:28] Bible is the revelation of God's mystery
[2:00:31] in
[2:00:33] Christ H he says the entire Bible is an
[2:00:36] expression of one goal that God had one
[2:00:40] purpose he wanted to achieve in the
[2:00:42] entire Bible and all the acts of the
[2:00:46] Believers in the Bible has been a type
[2:00:49] in type expressing what God great goal
[2:00:52] is and now in this last day he has
[2:00:56] revealed it and shows it and God's help
[2:00:59] well you'll see it right here this
[2:01:01] morning what the Lord has had in his
[2:01:04] mind all along and has expressed
[2:01:09] it praise God hallelujah we are being
[2:01:14] expressed we are the word being
[2:01:17] expressed God is is is revealing himself
[2:01:21] through a people
[2:01:23] again glory to God Amen and we'll read
[2:01:27] this last scripture and we'll close
[2:01:28] giving thanks unto the Father which hath
[2:01:31] made us meat to be partakers of an
[2:01:34] inheritance of the Saints in light who
[2:01:38] hath delivered us from the power of
[2:01:40] Darkness this is our whole life this is
[2:01:43] everything from Genesis to Revelation
[2:01:45] and hath translated us into the kingdom
[2:01:49] of his dear son in whom we have
[2:01:52] Redemption through the blood through his
[2:01:55] blood even the Forgiveness of sins who
[2:01:58] is the
[2:01:59] image of the invisible God the firstborn
[2:02:04] of every creature Jesus Christ was the
[2:02:07] image of the invisible God and when you
[2:02:11] receive the word you start to take on
[2:02:14] the image the bride the the female part
[2:02:18] of Jesus Christ you start to take on the
[2:02:21] very image of Eve that was not deceived
[2:02:25] the one that would not be deceived the
[2:02:26] one that would not accept the doctrines
[2:02:28] of man the one that would not accept the
[2:02:30] trinitarian doctrine the one that would
[2:02:32] get properly baptized the one that would
[2:02:35] that would hear the word and and be
[2:02:37] willing to submit to the word of God
[2:02:40] hallelujah you become the invisible
[2:02:43] image the firstborn of every creature
[2:02:46] for by him were all things created that
[2:02:48] are in heaven and that are in Earth
[2:02:51] visible ible and invisible whether they
[2:02:53] be Thrones or dominions or
[2:02:56] principalities or Powers all things were
[2:02:59] created by Him and for
[2:03:03] him don't try to make this about anybody
[2:03:06] else it's all about his plan amen and he
[2:03:10] is before all things and by him by him
[2:03:14] all things consist and he is the head of
[2:03:17] the body the church who is the beginning
[2:03:20] the firstborn from the dead that in all
[2:03:23] things he might have preeminence he
[2:03:24] wants preeminence in your life this
[2:03:27] morning he wants he wants to have total
[2:03:30] preeminence in your life so that you
[2:03:31] will surrender unto him amen glory to
[2:03:34] God for it pleased the father who's the
[2:03:38] father the self-existent one the one who
[2:03:40] planned it all the one that's expressing
[2:03:43] all of this that in him see it was all
[2:03:46] in him should all the fullness dwell and
[2:03:51] having made peace through the blood of
[2:03:52] his cross which was our way
[2:03:56] back from Earth to
[2:04:01] Eternity to reconcile all things unto
[2:04:05] himself himself it's all going back to
[2:04:08] the mind of God to the Elohim into that
[2:04:12] existence into that place that he's gone
