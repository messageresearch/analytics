[24:46] certainly uh love the uh wonderful
[24:49] weather that the Lord has been giving us
[24:51] here in the month of September. How many
[24:52] are enjoying that?
[24:54] like uh August, you know, we were
[24:56] getting burned up, but um by the grace
[25:00] of God, we are now um having probably
[25:03] one of the nicest uh falls that we've
[25:05] ever had that I can remember every day
[25:08] just being so uh beautiful and um
[25:11] comfortable by the grace of the Lord. I
[25:14] believe it's just a reflection of his
[25:17] perfection. Amen. Praise God. And so uh
[25:20] today we are happy that we are going to
[25:22] be able to dedicate um a young child
[25:25] today. Uh if you want to just come

[25:32] just come and sit here at the front.
[25:34] Amen. Praise God. We want to welcome
[25:37] everybody into the house of the Lord.
[25:39] Visitors, friends, family. Um we want to
[25:43] welcome those that are online. We

[25:48] our services uh here every Sunday, every
[25:52] Wednesday night. Praise God. And um we
[25:55] just ask that if you're enjoying the
[25:56] services then subscribe to our channel
[25:59] and like the services. It's just a way
[26:02] of uh you know uh sharing this message
[26:06] uh because we are bringing uh a very uh
[26:10] present stage message of the ministry of
[26:14] Jesus Christ. And so we want this
[26:16] message to go um into the uttermost you
[26:20] know uh wherever the Lord wants to send
[26:22] it by the grace of God. And we know that
[26:26] um media um these days, social media is
[26:29] a very powerful instrument that's being
[26:32] used by many across the world. And so uh
[26:35] we want to use it for his glory. Amen.
[26:38] Praise God. So when you're on there and
[26:40] you're, you know, going through YouTube,
[26:42] stay away from the garbage. Just let

[26:46] that that are of God so that you can
[26:48] receive what you have need of. Amen.
[26:51] Praise God. We want to also um just
[26:54] announce for those that don't know that
[26:56] uh brother Ed Biscll from uh Vancouver
[27:00] from Bible way has gone to be with the
[27:02] Lord. He's gone to receive his reward.
[27:05] Amen. A wonderful servant of God and um
[27:09] who was a good friend and witness of
[27:13] William Branham in the early days of his
[27:17] ministry. Uh brother Biscll was 90 years
[27:20] old when he passed.
[27:22] Um, but as a young man, he has quite a
[27:24] testimony of how the Lord moved in his
[27:27] life and used our prophet William
[27:30] Branham, the messenger for for our day,
[27:33] for for the day that um uh you know that
[27:36] he was certainly a young man at the
[27:38] time. And um if you get a chance, you'll
[27:41] want to go online and, you know, look up
[27:43] Ed Biscll and listen to his testimony. I
[27:47] am a witness. And um you'll really be
[27:50] blessed by it. I'm sure you'll you'll
[27:52] really be blessed. So, let's keep the
[27:54] family in prayer as they at this time,
[27:57] I'm sure, are missing him. And um but
[28:00] they also rejoice to know that he's back
[28:03] into that dimension. He's in the sixth
[28:05] dimension. He's looking at himself. He's
[28:07] saying, "Brother Brandom, it was the
[28:09] truth. Everything that we preached, it
[28:12] was the truth." He's seeing himself, you
[28:15] know, young and and full of vigor and
[28:18] full of the the glory and surrounded by
[28:20] the young sons and daughters of God, the
[28:24] uh uh in their theophony bodies, eternal
[28:26] bodies. Amen. So, we are certainly
[28:28] grateful for that. Praise God. And so,
[28:31] this morning, um we're we we're going to
[28:34] have a baby dedication, then we're going
[28:36] to have uh the word, and then we're
[28:38] going to have the Lord's supper. Amen.
[28:40] So, um, we're going to try to move as
[28:43] quickly as we can. We will, um, stop,
[28:46] uh, ministering at around 12:30 to move
[28:50] into the order of the service of the
[28:51] Lord's supper and the footwashing. And
[28:54] this will, um, give us an opportunity to
[28:56] be done at, you know, close to our
[28:58] regular time, maybe a few minutes after.
[29:01] Praise God. But just enjoy the presence
[29:03] of the Lord this morning. Just, uh,
[29:05] enter in. Come today with expectation.
[29:08] And I trust that you've come with
[29:09] expectation that the Lord will speak to
[29:12] your heart and give you something that
[29:14] will give you strength to keep pressing
[29:17] this tremendous gospel that God has
[29:20] placed upon each and every one of us for
[29:23] this day and for this hour. Amen. Praise
[29:25] God. And so, um, I love being a part of
[29:29] this faith community. Amen. We're a part
[29:32] of the mystical body of Jesus Christ.
[29:34] Amen. and uh you know, we're one great
[29:38] wonderful family of God. We can support
[29:40] one another. And today, we're going to
[29:43] have the dedication of a new child.
[29:45] There's a there's a new addition to one
[29:47] of the families within the family of
[29:50] God. Amen. And you know, there's a
[29:53] there's a an understanding that's been
[29:55] said that the first thousand days of a
[29:58] child's life are the most influential,
[30:02] the most powerful. It is it is a
[30:05] programming stage of their lives. Amen.
[30:08] The first thousand days and that that's
[30:10] from their conception when it actually
[30:14] becomes
[30:16] uh birthed in the womb of the mother.
[30:19] You know the mother you've seen it many
[30:20] times. They'll they'll caress their
[30:22] belly and they'll they'll feel the
[30:24] movement as the child is growing in
[30:25] their stomach and that child is already
[30:28] feeding off of the atmosphere and the
[30:30] love of the mother and the father. Amen.
[30:33] Praise God. And so, um, in that time
[30:36] frame, it's a very crucial window and
[30:39] it's a time that requires special
[30:42] nurturing and input into those children,
[30:44] &gt;&gt; into that baby. Amen. And so it's been
[30:48] known that um that there's there's like
[30:51] millions like there's literally a
[30:54] million neuron connections being made
[30:58] per second in the baby's brain while
[31:01] it's developing. It's the fastest growth
[31:04] and development of the bl of the brain
[31:07] that the child or any human being will
[31:09] go through is in that first thousand
[31:11] days of their life here in this
[31:14] dimension. Amen. And so it's very
[31:17] important, you know, that that we
[31:19] understand that and especially for us as
[31:21] a household of faith that believe God's
[31:24] word and know that training up our
[31:26] children in the way of the Lord places
[31:29] the token, the life of God, the the the
[31:33] faith that that we carry, it gets
[31:36] imparted unto the children. Doesn't make
[31:39] them sons and daughters of God. They'll
[31:41] have to come into their own relationship
[31:44] at that time and season in their lives.
[31:46] But by nurturing them and by by making
[31:48] them uh you know uh susceptible to that
[31:52] environment, you're creating a a a much
[31:55] uh a much better potential for that
[31:59] child. Let's just put it that way. Amen.
[32:01] Praise God. So today we've got Hosea and
[32:04] Hope that have brought their son Ryan.
[32:08] We've already baptized their daughter.
[32:11] What's her name?
[32:12] &gt;&gt; Leah. Yes. We've already baptized or not
[32:15] baptized.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; Dedicated.
[32:19] &gt;&gt; Dedicated. Amen. That brings up
[32:22] something, doesn't it? No, you don't
[32:23] want to get me preaching on that now, do
[32:25] you? That's just the old nature. You
[32:27] see, you know, you know, we we like I
[32:30] came out of Roman Catholicism. I went to
[32:32] a lot of baby baptisms. I was baby
[32:34] baptized. You know what I mean? But we
[32:36] know that there's no such thing in the
[32:38] scripture. Amen. We dedicate our
[32:40] children unto the Lord. And today, uh,
[32:43] Hosea and Hope, they're they're um
[32:46] they're they're they've decided that
[32:48] they want to dedicate their their Ryan
[32:50] unto the Lord. Amen. And you know, we as
[32:53] a church see that we have an important
[32:55] role in being supportive and creating
[32:59] the the kind of environment that the
[33:02] family along with Ryan are going to
[33:05] require in order to raise their children
[33:08] in the faith of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[33:11] Praise God. And so today is, you know,
[33:15] today is more about parents than it is
[33:16] children, believe it or not. Okay? You
[33:19] as parents have a special role in
[33:22] raising your children in a way that will
[33:25] bring glory to the Lord. Amen. And so um
[33:30] you know that the best decision that you
[33:32] could have ever made was to actually
[33:34] dedicate your your son and your daughter
[33:37] unto the Lord. Amen. There's no greater
[33:40] decision at this stage in their lives
[33:43] &gt;&gt; because what you're doing is you are
[33:44] placing that child into God's hands.
[33:48] You're placing the future, the health,
[33:50] the well-being, the protection. We
[33:53] believe in the power of the Holy Ghost.
[33:55] Amen.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; That that God God will honor his word
[33:59] that if we raise and we train up our
[34:01] children in his way, he will not depart
[34:03] from their life. He will meet them at
[34:06] some point and they will have to make
[34:07] their own decision.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so today, you
[34:12] know, Jose and Hope, you're making a
[34:14] public declaration that you by the grace
[34:17] of God and the help of his people, his
[34:20] family. Amen. That you'll raise Ryan in
[34:24] a way that'll give glory to God. Amen.
[34:26] And no other reason do we And now
[34:28] another reason that we do this
[34:31] in in public is because we know that it
[34:35] takes more than just a family. It takes
[34:38] a village to raise a child.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and God has given us this
[34:44] wonderful community of faith that we,
[34:46] you know, that we have certain um
[34:49] ability here, abilities within our our
[34:51] Sunday schools and and and teachers and
[34:55] deacons and and people that are that are
[34:58] there to to assist in the training of
[35:01] the family, guiding and directing them
[35:04] when there's hard times because it's not
[35:06] always easy.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; No,
[35:08] &gt;&gt; it's never always easy. Don't think that
[35:10] because you you you you dedicate this
[35:12] child unto the Lord that you know that
[35:15] things are going to get easy or that
[35:16] you're declaring that you're a Christian
[35:18] that that your life has to be a bed of
[35:21] ease. It's not going to be. One of the
[35:23] one of the most greatest challenges in
[35:26] this day is to actually bring children
[35:29] up in the Lord.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; It's a great challenge, but it also can
[35:36] provide great rewards. Amen. Praise God.
[35:40] And so today, Ryan can can know and Jose
[35:45] and Hope, you can both know that this
[35:48] community is here to support you. that
[35:51] when you come and support this ministry
[35:55] and you come and you you come with
[35:57] expectation to receive God's word, your
[36:01] purpose in coming to receive it is so
[36:02] that you can have the faith to train up
[36:06] Brian, to train up Leah, and to bring
[36:09] them up to know the Lord Jesus.
[36:13] It starts with you as the father and
[36:17] then with you as the mother to come
[36:19] under the headship and the leadership of
[36:22] the spirit of God.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; And so at this time, let me ask you a
[36:26] question. Come on, move forward and come
[36:29] on up here. Just going to ask you a
[36:32] couple of quick questions. Do you commit
[36:34] yourselves to nurture and care for Ryan
[36:39] &gt;&gt; as parents?
[36:41] because it's a great responsibility
[36:44] and you're making this declaration
[36:46] before us as witnesses here today.
[36:49] You're responsible to care for that
[36:52] child, Jose. You're responsible to
[36:55] provide for that child, for your wife,
[36:57] and for your children, Jose. God holds
[37:00] you as the head and the leader of the
[37:02] home to take the responsibility,
[37:06] to take the burden, to take the pressure
[37:10] of this life. Because like we said, one
[37:12] of the greatest challenges in this
[37:14] dimension right now is to serve God and
[37:18] to raise children
[37:21] to the Lord by faith. And so I'm asking
[37:25] you, do you commit yourselves to raise
[37:28] Ryan in the Christian faith and invest
[37:31] in his life and Leah's life spiritually?
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. And do you commit yourselves to
[37:41] seeking help
[37:43] when times get tough
[37:46] and not just, you know, trying to handle
[37:48] everything on your own? That's what this
[37:49] community is for.
[37:52] you commit to to, you know, putting
[37:55] aside your your human pride when things
[37:57] get rough and tough and and are willing
[38:00] to come and, you know, call your deacon
[38:03] or call your pastor and say, "I need
[38:05] some support. I need some help." Are you
[38:07] committed to do that?
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Good.
[38:12] And let me ask the congregation here
[38:14] this morning,
[38:16] do you commit yourselves to creating a
[38:18] community of love and support around
[38:21] this family
[38:24] and their children?
[38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. That's what the body
[38:31] of Christ does. That's the beauty and
[38:35] the the benefits of belonging to the
[38:38] body of Christ. You are surrounded by
[38:42] people of faith that believe that God
[38:45] can do great things.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; In our lives.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. This time I'd like to
[38:52] take Brian
[38:55] and offer him and dedicate him.
[39:00] Oh, how sweet.
[39:03] How fresh.
[39:06] I love the fragrance of a fresh new
[39:09] baby.
[39:10] Praise God. Let us pray. Our gracious
[39:14] Father,
[39:16] what an honor and what a privilege it is
[39:18] this morning, Lord, to hold this new
[39:21] life, Father. Lord, it's it's just a
[39:25] reflection of you, Lord, that you can
[39:29] make all things brand new, Lord. You can
[39:32] you can do things that are so
[39:35] miraculous, Father. And here we have
[39:38] Jose and Hope that have, Lord, that have
[39:41] made this decision, Father, that they
[39:43] want Ryan, Lord, dedicated to you.
[39:47] They're asking you, and we're asking you
[39:49] as a community of faith this morning,
[39:51] Lord, to join us here and to let your
[39:54] spirit and your anointing come upon this
[39:56] child. Lord, we dedicate it to you in
[39:59] the name of Jesus Christ. That your
[40:01] spirit will go before him, watch over
[40:04] him, that you will encamp him about with
[40:06] angels, oh God, protecting his every
[40:09] breath, his every move, his every step.
[40:12] Lord, may your anointing come upon Jose
[40:15] as a leader of the home, as the provider
[40:18] uh oh God, upon hope as the mother,
[40:21] Lord, the nurturing uh uh giver of of of
[40:25] this child, Lord God, may your spirit so
[40:28] anoint them, oh God, with your with your
[40:30] faith, Lord, give them a revelation,
[40:33] Lord, of this tremendous responsibility
[40:36] that you have placed within their hands,
[40:38] Father. Lord, let your spirit take
[40:40] control. And may this child one day,
[40:43] Lord, decide and and and make public
[40:46] declaration that that that I will serve
[40:49] the Lord. Lord God, may you go before
[40:52] him, watch over and direct and guide
[40:54] this entire family. Remember little
[40:56] Leah. Lord, continue to uh uh place your
[41:00] your spirit and hover over her life and
[41:03] protect and guide her. Oh God, in the
[41:05] name of Jesus Christ, Lord, we commit
[41:07] this entire family, this community,
[41:10] Lord, into your hands and we give you
[41:12] thanks for this new life in the name of
[41:16] Jesus Christ.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; Ryan, I dedicate you in the name of
[41:21] Jesus
[41:24] for his glory. Amen. Thank you.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; God bless you, sister.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; I love that. I I I really uh really
[41:46] appreciate the Lord. You know, anytime
[41:48] that um that uh there's a child to be
[41:52] dedicated, um I I rejoice. Amen. I
[41:56] rejoice. So I thank God for that. Let us
[41:58] continue to keep them in prayer and
[42:00] believe that the Lord will do a great
[42:01] work in their lives. Praise God. Let's
[42:04] change the order of the service at this
[42:07] time. Let's all stand.
[42:13] Brother Desmond, you can give this to uh
[42:16] the family. Amen. It's a dedication
[42:19] certificate.
[42:23] Let us pray. Father, as we now change
[42:26] the order of the service, Father, we're
[42:27] asking that your spirit now would just
[42:29] come. And Lord, place that anointing
[42:32] upon your servant to speak and upon your
[42:35] children to hear what exactly you would
[42:38] have for us today, Lord, simple as it
[42:41] might be, Father, but let it let it
[42:43] profoundly affect our hearts that we may
[42:47] search deeper, Lord, into that
[42:49] relationship with you, Father. Because
[42:51] truly, Lord, that is that is our desire,
[42:54] Lord, to walk with you and to and to
[42:56] have a closer walk with you. But Lord,
[42:59] we need your word. We need to hear what
[43:02] you have for us. And Lord, won't you
[43:05] speak to us now? Granted, Father, Lord,
[43:08] you're the only one that can speak to
[43:10] individual hearts and know every single
[43:14] person exactly where we're all at. Lord,
[43:17] I have a need. Your people have a need.
[43:20] Father, may you bless and prosper us now
[43:24] in Jesus name. Amen.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Let's go to our first
[43:29] scripture. Um today we're we're going to
[43:32] continue uh where we've started a few
[43:34] weeks ago. We've been looking at the
[43:36] purpose of God. Last week we looked at
[43:39] the purpose of the Holy Ghost. We're
[43:41] today the Lord just laid it on my heart,
[43:44] you know, to make it a question. What is
[43:47] the purpose of the Holy Ghost? We're
[43:49] going to be digging into it as much as
[43:51] we possibly can and just allow the Holy
[43:53] Spirit uh you know to reveal to us
[43:56] things that that that that we need to
[43:58] know. We need to hear. We need to
[44:00] understand in a greater way what the
[44:03] Holy Ghost is all about in our personal
[44:07] lives. Amen. Praise God. And so, let's
[44:11] read our scripture from Luke chapter 1
[44:14] from verse 34. I know it says 35 up
[44:17] there, but it's actually from verse 34.
[44:19] It says, "Then Mary unto the angel said
[44:24] un then said Mary unto the angel, how
[44:27] shall this be
[44:29] seeing I know not a man?"
[44:32] And the angel answered and said unto
[44:34] her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon
[44:38] thee, and the power of the highest shall
[44:41] overshadow thee. Therefore also that
[44:45] holy thing which shall be born of thee
[44:48] shall be called the son of God.
[44:52] And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth,
[44:56] she hath also conceived a son in her old
[44:59] age. And this is the sixth month with
[45:02] her who was called barren.
[45:07] For with God nothing shall be
[45:09] impossible.
[45:11] And Mary said, "Behold
[45:13] the handmade of the Lord.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Be it unto me according to thy word."
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord add his blessings to the
[45:23] word of God. Amen.
[45:26] You know, the very first time that we
[45:30] hear the phrase and the words Holy Ghost
[45:34] are in the book of Matthew
[45:37] 1 verse 18. And it said it in this way.
[45:41] Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on
[45:44] this wise.
[45:47] When as his mother Mary was espoused to
[45:50] Joseph before they came together, she
[45:55] was found with child of the Holy Ghost.
[45:59] It's the very first time that we hear
[46:02] that phrase Holy Ghost.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know um it's it's
[46:07] tremendous when we look at this because
[46:11] this is what we've you know that the
[46:12] Lord has led us to dive into. We want to
[46:15] understand why you know like like last
[46:18] week we talked about how you know the
[46:19] the hol that the spirit of God was
[46:22] mentioned in the Old Testament. Then the
[46:24] Holy Spirit was mentioned but never the
[46:26] Holy Ghost in the Old Testament. But yet
[46:29] it shows up in Matthew 1 verse 18 for
[46:32] the first time as the Holy Ghost
[46:37] being the father of the son, the child
[46:42] that was placed supernaturally
[46:45] in
[46:47] the womb of Mary. Amen. Praise God. Mary
[46:51] had no idea that there was a prophecy.
[46:54] Maybe she had heard maybe she had gone
[46:56] to church and maybe she had heard about
[46:59] this prophecy that you know that that a
[47:01] that a that you know in Isaiah I believe
[47:04] it was in Isaiah
[47:06] 7:14 where Isaiah cried out and he said
[47:09] therefore the Lord himself shall give
[47:11] you a sign 700 years earlier. Behold a
[47:16] virgin shall conceive and bear a son and
[47:20] shall call his name Emmanuel. And what
[47:23] does Emmanuel mean? God with us.
[47:28] She had no idea that she was actually
[47:31] going to be the manifestation of that
[47:34] prophecy.
[47:36] Amen. There are people in this day and
[47:39] in this hour that don't realize that
[47:43] within them lays a prophecy
[47:47] of the Holy Ghost
[47:49] that's going to bring you into a
[47:52] manifestation
[47:54] as a son and as a daughter of God in
[47:57] this age.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Mary was in that time. But what was God
[48:04] doing? This was a great time. This was a
[48:07] this was a dispensational change. We
[48:10] need to recognize what God was doing
[48:13] because we mentioned last week that the
[48:15] difference between Holy Spirit and Holy
[48:18] Ghost and the spirit of God was in that
[48:23] it was the same God. It's the
[48:25] self-existent one. It's it's the creator
[48:27] of all things but in different
[48:30] manifestations
[48:32] and in different dispensations.
[48:35] And so God here now was coming into the
[48:38] dispensation
[48:40] of the Holy Ghost where it was now going
[48:43] to be God in man. God was now coming to
[48:48] the earth to identify himself not above,
[48:54] not God above.
[48:57] Not God just with, but God in.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; And this is the hour. This is the
[49:03] dispensation
[49:05] that we are now continuing
[49:08] to to unveil the mighty God to continue
[49:12] to bring the word in the day that we're
[49:16] living in the manifestation of God in
[49:19] this hour. She had no idea that she
[49:21] would be the word
[49:24] made manifest in her day.
[49:28] But when she but but but something was
[49:30] in her. Something was in her. The Holy
[49:33] Ghost had come upon her. The scripture
[49:36] says
[49:38] &gt;&gt; it had come upon her. And when the Holy
[49:40] Ghost comes upon an individual, it
[49:43] begins a process within their life
[49:46] &gt;&gt; to actually identify with God.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; That God is actually a reality.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; It's one thing when the Holy Ghost comes
[49:54] upon an individual. It's another thing
[49:57] when God gives you a revelation
[50:00] &gt;&gt; of himself, not only with you, but in
[50:03] you.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. She had no idea
[50:08] that she would bring forth the Christ,
[50:11] the anointed Messiah,
[50:14] God, coming into the dispensation of God
[50:19] and man uniting here on earth.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. She had no idea. The scripture in
[50:26] Isaiah 9:6 said, "For unto us a child is
[50:30] born, unto us a son is given, and the
[50:35] government shall be upon his shoulder,
[50:38] and his name shall be called wonderful."
[50:40] Pay attention, counselor,
[50:43] the mighty God.
[50:46] And and you know, you go out there and
[50:48] you ask people about the Holy Ghost and
[50:50] about the Holy Spirit, they'll say he's
[50:52] the third person
[50:55] in the Godhead.
[50:58] Three gods in one.
[51:01] I just read the scripture here from
[51:03] Isaiah and we can show you many
[51:06] scriptures that make it very clear there
[51:08] is only one God.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; But God changing his veil. God
[51:15] manifesting himself in different
[51:17] dispensations in different individuals.
[51:21] Amen. Praise God. Manifesting himself
[51:25] to the world. And whenever he did that
[51:28] and he come upon a prophet, they would
[51:31] get anointed with the word of God and
[51:33] they would say, "Thus sayaeth the Lord."
[51:37] &gt;&gt; They would have the word of the Lord
[51:39] flowing through them. Amen. And all the
[51:43] prophets of the Old Testament, they were
[51:46] all announcing the coming of the
[51:48] Messiah. He's coming. He's coming. He's
[51:53] coming. And then here,
[51:56] a young, beautiful virgin
[51:59] is chosen to actually be a carrier of
[52:04] his coming.
[52:05] What a time, saints. She had no idea
[52:08] that she would have to bear the
[52:10] reproach.
[52:12] Let me finish that scripture. The
[52:13] counselor, the mighty God, the
[52:15] everlasting father, the prince of peace.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Is there anybody left out there?
[52:24] They just said that that son would be
[52:26] all of those things because God was
[52:28] going to come down and manifest himself
[52:31] in the form of a man.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:35] because he had to fulfill his word that
[52:39] if a man's sin, a man had to die. So he
[52:41] had to take on a man body in this
[52:44] dimension so that he could take that
[52:46] body to Calvary and make it the
[52:50] sacrifice for you and me to show that we
[52:55] would have a way back.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; This was his process. There was a great
[53:02] dispensation and a great change taking
[53:05] place on the earth. And a lot of people,
[53:07] they'll go to church every Sunday and
[53:09] they'll talk about, "Oh, Jesus is my
[53:11] savior." G. But until he's actually come
[53:15] in, you you can't even call him Lord.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are told in this
[53:22] scripture that Elizabeth had conceived a
[53:25] son. God was Now look at this whole
[53:28] dispensation. Look at this this whole
[53:30] event what God was doing right at this
[53:32] very time when when his announcement was
[53:35] made to to to Mary. Not only did the
[53:37] angel bring the news about the coming of
[53:40] the Messiah,
[53:42] he also brought news that hey, by the
[53:44] way, your cousin Elizabeth, she's with
[53:47] child, too,
[53:49] and she was known to be barren.
[53:53] God's going to do things in such a way.
[53:56] Listen, when God does something, it's
[53:58] not going to be the way you think it's
[53:59] going to happen.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; And the world, the whole church world is
[54:03] believing that, oh, the coming of the
[54:05] Lord is at hand. He's coming. He's
[54:07] coming. He's coming. They're always
[54:08] looking into the future. They're always
[54:11] looking to see what God is going to be
[54:13] doing. They're always looking back at
[54:15] what he did, but they failed to see what
[54:17] God is doing right now. Amen.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; And I can imagine in that day when Mary
[54:22] received this salutation, she she now
[54:26] would have to bear the reproach of the
[54:28] word of God. Amen. I hope you're seeing
[54:31] yourself somewhere in here this morning.
[54:32] Amen.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; She had something in her that was able
[54:36] to respond back and say, "Be it unto me
[54:39] according to thy word.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; I'm not afraid to accept this reproach,
[54:44] this reality of the Holy Ghost that's
[54:46] come upon me. I know what I've seen. I
[54:49] know I what I heard from the angel.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; She had no idea that she would have to
[54:56] bear this kind of reproach.
[54:59] But Mary was reassured when when the
[55:01] angel said, "Listen, your your cousin is
[55:04] also with child." And he and the angel
[55:07] was telling her, "So so don't don't
[55:10] think anything's impossible with God."
[55:13] In other words, God was raising her
[55:15] faith.
[55:17] God was placing in her
[55:19] a a prophecy that that she was going to
[55:23] actually be a part of because when she
[55:27] walked into the presence of her cousin
[55:30] Elizabeth, the the child leaped within
[55:34] Elizabeth's womb.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it it heard it it knew
[55:40] what God had said. and and and Mary at
[55:43] that moment, it must have just taken her
[55:46] her her faith to another level. Amen.
[55:49] God will will do things in your life
[55:52] that he's not going to leave you in a
[55:55] condition where where where you're in a
[55:57] condition of confusion.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; He will do things in your life. You just
[56:01] got to be open to it. You've got to be
[56:03] you've got to let him in. Amen.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; You've got to make a way. You got to let
[56:08] the Holy Spirit deal with the situations
[56:11] in your life.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't be afraid of making
[56:14] mistakes.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, we're going to be looking at some
[56:17] things here today. Amen. Praise God. We
[56:20] need to know that with God, all things
[56:23] are possible.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; There's nothing that God can't do. And
[56:27] God was reassuring to Mary and letting
[56:30] her know, listen, you're going to see
[56:32] things like you've never seen before.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm doing I'm doing something here
[56:38] on earth that that that that is going to
[56:41] that is going to change everything. All
[56:44] the 4,000 years of history, everything
[56:48] that your fathers were teaching you, all
[56:50] the the all the the Pharisees, the
[56:52] Sadducees, the the great leaders, the
[56:54] religious leaders of that day,
[56:57] they couldn't recognize when the word
[57:00] was being made flesh right before their
[57:02] very eyes.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; They'd read the scripture, but they
[57:04] couldn't see it. They were blind.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; It's repeating itself.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:12] Glory to God. And so, you know, we
[57:16] looked at a lot of things last week. We
[57:17] said, you know, if you talk to about 80
[57:19] or 90% of people and ask them about the
[57:23] Holy Ghost, you're going to get all
[57:25] kinds of different questions and they're
[57:27] actually going to question whether they
[57:28] even got it.
[57:31] Don't tell me
[57:33] that you don't question sometimes within
[57:36] your heart because you're you're you're
[57:39] in this great battle between the old
[57:41] nature and the new nature.
[57:43] You're you're you're you're you're in a
[57:45] world where you've come to know God and
[57:47] God gives you a baptism of his spirit
[57:50] and all of a sudden God lifts a lot of
[57:52] things off of your life and the very
[57:54] next day you're making mistakes again
[57:57] and you're wondering what is going on.
[58:00] Well, this is what we want to look into.
[58:02] This is what this is what we want to
[58:04] take a deep dive into so that we can get
[58:06] a better understanding of how the Holy
[58:10] Ghost is operating and what the purpose
[58:12] of the Holy Ghost is. Amen. Praise God.
[58:15] And so we've discovered many different
[58:17] things. You know, we can be anointed of
[58:21] the Holy Spirit. We can actually be be
[58:24] uh you know uh surrounded by the Holy
[58:26] Spirit. We can have, you know, um h the
[58:30] presence of God where we feel his
[58:32] presence and his love and yet you still
[58:35] are not saved. It doesn't save you. All
[58:39] you've done is you've come into a an
[58:41] anointing. You've come into a baptism.
[58:42] You It's like going into the water
[58:44] without a real experience having taken
[58:47] place on the inside of you to actually
[58:50] wash you. Because water is a
[58:52] representation of separation.
[58:55] It leaves your old life completely
[58:58] behind. And when true experience happens
[59:02] in an individual, your your entire life
[59:05] is flipped upside down. You're never the
[59:08] same. You're never the same person.
[59:12] Amen. Praise God. And so, we looked at
[59:16] all those things. But here, let's look
[59:18] No, here I'm just going to read this.
[59:19] This is a quote here that I I read last
[59:21] week, and and it's worth reading again.
[59:23] Here it says, you say, "Well, Brother
[59:25] Brandham, I believe." You say, "I
[59:28] believe." You say, "Pastor Danny, I
[59:30] believe,
[59:32] but I've never received the Holy Ghost."
[59:36] You know, that's a good thing if you're
[59:38] honest with yourself. I remember when I
[59:41] came to this church and I was listening
[59:44] to the word that was coming forth.
[59:47] I came to a place where I went to the
[59:50] pastor and I said, "Pastor Simon, I want
[59:53] the Holy Ghost because I did not believe
[59:57] that I had the Holy Ghost."
[1:00:00] And that's a good thing. If you come to
[1:00:02] a place where you don't know where,
[1:00:06] that's a good start because if you
[1:00:09] really want to go with God, you really
[1:00:10] want to walk with God, then you need to
[1:00:12] be honest with God.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; You need to be honest where you are
[1:00:16] right now. Now, if you don't know where
[1:00:17] you are right now, how you going to know
[1:00:18] where you're going?
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; He says, listen, he goes on. He says,
[1:00:23] uh, he says, you no, you don't believe
[1:00:26] yet. This is what Brother Bram's saying
[1:00:28] to the to the person. No, you don't
[1:00:29] believe yet. You're right. That's good
[1:00:31] that you said that. You're just
[1:00:34] believing unto belief.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; You have hope.
[1:00:39] He says, you don't know nothing about it
[1:00:42] until you've received the Holy Ghost.
[1:00:45] You say, "I accept Jesus Christ as my
[1:00:48] personal savior." Have you received the
[1:00:50] Holy Ghost since you believed?
[1:00:53] That's the real question.
[1:00:56] He says, "If you don't, you can't even
[1:00:58] call him the Lord because he's not
[1:01:00] Lord." Lord means that he's ruling over
[1:01:04] your life. You have completely and
[1:01:06] totally surrendered unto him.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; He's now your Lord. Go back and study
[1:01:12] what Lord means. landlord when the when
[1:01:15] it was the landlord, he owned the land.
[1:01:17] He tell you to come on, he tell you to
[1:01:19] get off
[1:01:21] and you were completely at his mercy.
[1:01:24] Amen. Praise God. And so he says, he
[1:01:27] goes and he says he's a historical being
[1:01:30] that you have accepted.
[1:01:34] He says, he says, but when you come into
[1:01:37] but when but when he comes into you by
[1:01:40] the Holy Ghost, he is your Lord. No man
[1:01:42] can call Jesus Lord only by the Holy
[1:01:45] Ghost until you are born of the spirit
[1:01:47] of God. And the Holy Ghost is in you.
[1:01:50] Then if you are born into this kingdom
[1:01:53] and you're part of the church, the body
[1:01:56] of Christ. Amen. You're called out.
[1:02:02] You're a called out one. Then you see
[1:02:05] it. Amen. So there's something, you
[1:02:09] know, that we're being challenged by
[1:02:11] here.
[1:02:12] We're being challenged about what is the
[1:02:14] Holy Ghost and how, you know, how should
[1:02:17] it be affecting my life? Amen. Praise
[1:02:20] God. You know, you can go to the next
[1:02:23] slide. It says here, you know, in the in
[1:02:26] the message, and I just all I did was I
[1:02:28] put it into point form in the message,
[1:02:31] what is the Holy Ghost? Brother Brandham
[1:02:32] 1959. There was these these four
[1:02:36] questions, these three these three
[1:02:38] statements that he made. And number one
[1:02:40] was you cannot come and receive the Holy
[1:02:43] Spirit, the Holy Ghost unless you know
[1:02:46] what it is.
[1:02:47] And then he says, "And you cannot
[1:02:49] receive it if you know what it is unless
[1:02:52] you believe it's given to you." You got
[1:02:54] to know that the that the word for this
[1:02:57] hour was meant for you
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; because the moment that the message of
[1:03:02] the hour comes to you, it lights you up.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Yes. It it immediately you you you see
[1:03:11] that everything that you've been taught
[1:03:13] when you start to compare it to the
[1:03:15] word,
[1:03:16] you can see it as clear as day that it's
[1:03:19] it's it's wrong. Like today, baby
[1:03:21] baptisms, there's no such thing as baby
[1:03:24] baptism. When you see the word for your
[1:03:27] day and it starts to shine light on the
[1:03:30] gospel, the light that's in you now,
[1:03:34] which is God's representation that he
[1:03:37] placed in you, not when you were born
[1:03:40] here into this earth. No, before you
[1:03:43] came to this earth, before the
[1:03:45] foundations of the world, there was
[1:03:47] representation that you could receive
[1:03:50] the light of this hour. And immediately
[1:03:54] you recognize that's for me.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; You need to come to that place. This
[1:03:59] word is for me. And then he goes on. He
[1:04:02] says, "And then you cannot know whether
[1:04:03] you got it or not unless you know what
[1:04:07] the results are that it's supposed to
[1:04:09] bring in your life. It's not supposed to
[1:04:12] just make you speak in tongues and shout
[1:04:14] and and praise God and hallelujah and
[1:04:17] sing like an angel."
[1:04:19] It's supposed to bring you back to the
[1:04:22] word.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; It's supposed to lead you and guide you
[1:04:26] into all truth.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; That's what's going to change your life.
[1:04:31] That's what's going to change your walk.
[1:04:33] It's the word. It's the word that
[1:04:36] changes your walk. Amen. It's not by you
[1:04:41] trying to, you know, go to as many camp
[1:04:43] meetings as you can and get the
[1:04:45] anointing of the spirit on you and get
[1:04:47] all excited about, you know, about God
[1:04:50] and about the minister because, oh, he
[1:04:52] can bring the word in such a way that,
[1:04:54] you know, it just really tickles my
[1:04:56] soul. He says, "Oh, your your sins are
[1:04:58] forgiven. They've been placed in the sea
[1:05:00] of my forgetfulness." Hallelujah. Praise
[1:05:03] God. Hallelujah. You need to dig deeper
[1:05:06] into that. Amen. Because when you come
[1:05:09] to the Lord and you first come into that
[1:05:13] that experience with God and you go to
[1:05:16] the waters of baptism and you get
[1:05:19] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:05:22] Christ and you get buried in that water,
[1:05:25] you come out of that water as a as a as
[1:05:28] a sinless brand new baby.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Your old sins are washed away.
[1:05:38] But then you go on, listen, I I I'm
[1:05:41] talking to everybody here uh this
[1:05:43] morning, okay? Everybody remembers when
[1:05:46] they got baptized and I I remembered as
[1:05:49] clear as day because God supernaturally
[1:05:52] took that drug addiction right out of my
[1:05:55] life. Boom. Gone.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; I was washed. my life. Whatever my past
[1:06:01] was, he made it so clear to me that that
[1:06:04] past is dead and buried.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; He made that clear to me.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; When when you know, you know, we we
[1:06:14] think that just because God makes it
[1:06:16] clear to us that God is just going to
[1:06:18] forget. No, no. God doesn't. God is the
[1:06:21] almighty God. He knows the end from the
[1:06:23] beginning.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; You think God is just going to forget
[1:06:25] everything? He'll never bring it up
[1:06:28] again. I can tell you that because he
[1:06:30] stands behind his word.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; But he also knows that you're going to
[1:06:34] come up out of that water and you're
[1:06:36] going to go out back into the world and
[1:06:39] you're going to make all kinds of
[1:06:41] mistakes again.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. And you thought that you were,
[1:06:47] you know, you're you're you're life is
[1:06:49] going to be perfect from that day on.
[1:06:51] Let me tell you, World War III broke out
[1:06:54] in my life
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; after that experience. Amen.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, God did wonderful supernatural
[1:07:02] things, but there was a mighty battle
[1:07:04] that started because the enemy does not
[1:07:07] want to let go of any of you.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; And don't think for one minute that you
[1:07:13] are, you know, that that, oh, I'm a
[1:07:15] Christian and I you can receive the Holy
[1:07:17] Ghost. You can actually receive the Holy
[1:07:19] Ghost and still go out there and make
[1:07:21] all kinds of mistakes.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; And you need to know that. You need to
[1:07:26] know that because a lot of people, they
[1:07:28] they they think that once, you know,
[1:07:30] they've they've come to church and they
[1:07:32] get baptized and they they receive the
[1:07:34] Holy Ghost that their life is going to
[1:07:36] be perfect.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; How many perfect people in here today?
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I had
[1:07:42] battles this week.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; I have to deal with mental battles. I
[1:07:46] have to deal with situations in my life.
[1:07:48] I got to deal with sin
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; because sin people think, "Oh, I don't
[1:07:53] drink. I don't smoke. I don't swear
[1:07:55] anymore."
[1:07:57] I get a bunch of you one time watch you
[1:08:00] under some pressure at work and see if
[1:08:01] that
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know what
[1:08:05] I'm talking about.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me you're perfect. Oh, I
[1:08:10] don't do any I I don't I don't think any
[1:08:12] sin. When I see a beautiful woman
[1:08:14] walking down the street, I just
[1:08:16] immediately turn my head.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; People want people want to put even
[1:08:25] within this message, they want to raise
[1:08:27] the children in such a way that they
[1:08:29] want to tell them, listen, you don't
[1:08:31] talk to any boys, you don't talk to any
[1:08:33] girls, you don't flirt with any boys,
[1:08:35] you don't flirt with any girls. And
[1:08:38] we've put so much boundaries, so much
[1:08:40] wall around these children that they
[1:08:42] don't under they don't even know how to
[1:08:44] react
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; when they get into a real life situation
[1:08:48] because you can shelter them all you
[1:08:49] want in the house of the Lord. But I
[1:08:51] promise you for those two hours that you
[1:08:54] got them here on Sunday, you could watch
[1:08:55] them, but you're not going to be able to
[1:08:57] watch them the other seven days of the
[1:09:00] week,
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; six days of the week.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Come on, saints. We're talking about a
[1:09:07] reality of serving God. Do you want to
[1:09:09] serve God?
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Do you want to know that the Holy Ghost
[1:09:13] has a purpose in your life? And if you
[1:09:15] can line up with that purpose, if you
[1:09:18] can come in tune with God's desire and
[1:09:20] and and will for your life that all of a
[1:09:23] sudden you can be empowered by his
[1:09:26] ability to do things in your life. But
[1:09:29] you need to be aware. You need to be
[1:09:31] conscious. You're not some clone or
[1:09:34] some, you know, some some uh you know,
[1:09:37] uh uh you know, I'm just going to I'm
[1:09:39] just going to activate this this uh app
[1:09:42] here. Activated. And now all of a
[1:09:44] sudden, you're like a robot. Comes to
[1:09:46] church. Comes in every Sunday, sits
[1:09:49] down. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; God don't have robots.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; God has individuals with free moral
[1:09:57] agency.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; He wants you to serve him because you
[1:10:00] love him. Amen.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; So, you know, we could, you know, we
[1:10:08] could go on and on about the different
[1:10:10] manifestations of the Holy Spirit, but
[1:10:14] here now go to the next slide. Here's
[1:10:18] the definition of Holy Ghost and Holy
[1:10:20] Spirit. In the Bible, Holy Spirit and
[1:10:23] Holy Ghost means, and we mentioned this
[1:10:25] last week, but I just refined it down a
[1:10:27] little more, separated and set apart for
[1:10:32] the purpose of God.
[1:10:34] Now watch God's purpose in relation to,
[1:10:40] with,
[1:10:42] and in
[1:10:45] to
[1:10:47] with, and in man.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:52] This is what we're interested in
[1:10:53] understanding.
[1:10:55] Because when when people say, "Oh, you
[1:10:57] need to be holy, man. What do you mean I
[1:11:00] need to be holy?
[1:11:02] You You want me to be something that I'm
[1:11:04] not?
[1:11:06] I be ye holy as God is holy." You know
[1:11:09] what makes God holy? The fact that he
[1:11:12] had a plan in his mind and a purpose
[1:11:15] that he was never going to alter. He
[1:11:17] says, "Heavens and earth are going to
[1:11:18] pass away, but my word will never pass
[1:11:20] away."
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Because God had a purpose in his word.
[1:11:24] God had a thought behind every thought,
[1:11:28] every individual, every person that he
[1:11:31] called. When he called Mary, he was
[1:11:34] calling you. He saw that you would see
[1:11:37] yourself in the word
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; because you're a part of the word.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; You You're a part of his thoughts.
[1:11:46] So when God thinks a certain thought,
[1:11:48] that's why brother Brandham says if you
[1:11:50] don't see Jesus Christ from Genesis to
[1:11:53] Revelation, you need to go back and look
[1:11:56] it over again.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the thought of God from the
[1:12:00] beginning
[1:12:02] had you in there.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; And so how do you know that you've got
[1:12:07] the Holy Ghost? is when you connect with
[1:12:10] God and his thoughts by revelation.
[1:12:16] Revelation brings you into an experience
[1:12:20] where you actually start to walk with
[1:12:22] God.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; A lot of people go into that tank, come
[1:12:27] out of that tank, they go out and back
[1:12:30] and live in the world just the same way
[1:12:32] they were living before they went in.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Why? because they have not received the
[1:12:38] revelation of God's identification
[1:12:43] and manifestation
[1:12:45] with them personally.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Remember, it's God's purpose
[1:12:52] to in no uh to
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; with and in.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And until he comes in, you're just
[1:13:04] a work in process.
[1:13:06] There's a lot of us in this place that
[1:13:08] are still in process, including the guy
[1:13:10] you're looking at right here. You see,
[1:13:13] there's two natures that we're going to
[1:13:15] constantly have to deal with. Whether
[1:13:17] you like it or not, you're going to
[1:13:19] fight that nature. Just like Jacob and
[1:13:21] Esau,
[1:13:23] just like, you know, that that that the
[1:13:25] the one is going to is going to actually
[1:13:28] control the other. And at some point,
[1:13:32] you've got to come to a place where you
[1:13:34] yourself need to realize that the
[1:13:37] message of this hour, that what the Holy
[1:13:40] Spirit is doing right now in the present
[1:13:42] stage of his ministry is going to direct
[1:13:46] and guide and and and and lead those
[1:13:52] that came out even under William Branham
[1:13:55] 60 70 years ago.
[1:14:00] People are holding on to ideas of what
[1:14:03] the Holy Ghost is
[1:14:05] in this message, not realizing that they
[1:14:09] don't really have a clear understanding
[1:14:11] of the progression of the Holy Ghost.
[1:14:13] They might have it, but they need to be
[1:14:16] awakened to what he's doing now.
[1:14:19] They need to they need they need they
[1:14:21] need some revelation to bring them into
[1:14:23] the present stage of the ministry. Now
[1:14:26] let's I'm going a little bit ahead of
[1:14:29] myself. So here now when we look at this
[1:14:32] God's purpose in relation to with and in
[1:14:36] is the three-fold purpose of God. God
[1:14:39] above us God with us when Jesus Christ
[1:14:42] came and now the Holy Ghost God in us
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; to manifest himself in the bride of this
[1:14:50] last age.
[1:14:52] Amen. Glory to God. And so we need to
[1:14:55] understand these differences.
[1:14:58] So now I want to we got 15 minutes.
[1:15:03] I'm going to take a quick sip
[1:15:10] and we're going to see how far we can
[1:15:11] get because then we'll finish this and
[1:15:13] we'll just continue. I don't know how
[1:15:15] many weeks we're going to go on this. I
[1:15:16] don't know. as I study it,
[1:15:20] there's just so much more as you go
[1:15:23] deeper into it. There's just it just
[1:15:25] keeps unveiling itself. So, I don't know
[1:15:27] how how how long, but I trust that
[1:15:29] you're going to receive what you have
[1:15:30] need of. Let's let's look here now at
[1:15:33] the Holy Spirit to Holy Ghost
[1:15:36] dispensation
[1:15:38] of what was happening back when Mary
[1:15:41] received this message that she was going
[1:15:44] to bring forth Emmanuel and that there
[1:15:47] was going to be a forerunner. That was
[1:15:50] John's prophecy being manifest right
[1:15:52] there and then too. Behold one that will
[1:15:55] be crying in the wilderness, prepare ye
[1:15:58] the way of the Lord. Amen. Praise God.
[1:16:01] Let's look at this dispensational change
[1:16:03] for the coming manifestation of God.
[1:16:05] Now, God was coming for the first time.
[1:16:10] God was going to manifest in man on
[1:16:14] earth and he was going to he was going
[1:16:17] to experience the whole process, the
[1:16:20] entire process.
[1:16:23] Thank you. But I got a napkin.
[1:16:26] I finally my wife says, "You need to
[1:16:28] bring a napkin up there." I said, "Yeah,
[1:16:30] I know. I keep forgetting,
[1:16:34] but thank you for reminding me to do
[1:16:37] that." And so here now, God was God was
[1:16:40] going to be for the first time, God was
[1:16:42] going to take on human flesh
[1:16:45] and he was going to come under obedience
[1:16:47] to that human flesh. We need to see this
[1:16:50] whole process that that Jesus himself,
[1:16:53] God himself
[1:16:55] was going to go through. Remember, he
[1:16:58] was a child. He was a baby. He was born
[1:17:00] a baby. He was born a He grew like a
[1:17:03] young man. He grew into a teenager. He
[1:17:05] had to he had to deal with all the same
[1:17:08] things. The Bible says that he came
[1:17:10] under obedience.
[1:17:12] obedience to the word that was within
[1:17:14] him, to the Holy Ghost, to the purpose
[1:17:16] of God that was in him. He was showing
[1:17:20] in the first fruits exactly what the
[1:17:23] word will do in your life when you
[1:17:26] receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Let's read our next scripture
[1:17:33] in John.
[1:17:37] He goes on here in in uh Matthew 3:es 9
[1:17:40] to10. He says, "And think not to say
[1:17:44] within now you got to picture the
[1:17:46] picture the scene here now." Okay?
[1:17:47] Picture John. He's now, you know, around
[1:17:50] 30 years old because he was only 6
[1:17:53] months older than Jesus. Okay? And here
[1:17:56] he is now and and he's got this
[1:17:58] anointing on his life that he was the
[1:18:01] one that would be crying in the
[1:18:03] wilderness. Picture he's now in the
[1:18:06] midst of all these religious
[1:18:08] organizations of the day. And as you're
[1:18:11] picturing him, I want you to picture
[1:18:13] William Branham when he came on the
[1:18:15] scene because everything runs in
[1:18:17] parallel here. And this is what this is
[1:18:20] what God has given us the ability to
[1:18:21] recognize because if we see him the same
[1:18:24] back there, we will see him the same
[1:18:27] right here.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Because he's the same yesterday, today,
[1:18:31] and forever. And so here now he's
[1:18:34] rebuking these Pharisees and think not
[1:18:37] to say within yourselves, we have
[1:18:39] Abraham to our father. For I say unto
[1:18:41] you that God is able of these stones to
[1:18:45] raise children unto Abraham. And now
[1:18:47] also the ax is laid unto the root of the
[1:18:50] trees. Therefore, every tree which
[1:18:52] bringeth forth not fruit, not not not
[1:18:56] forth good fruit is heed down and cast
[1:18:59] into the fire.
[1:19:00] He's rebuking the people of that day.
[1:19:04] Why was he rebuking the people? They
[1:19:07] didn't invite him into the
[1:19:10] into the temple. They wouldn't invite a
[1:19:12] wild man like John. See, God was doing
[1:19:16] something so different, so irregular
[1:19:20] from the way that the people would have
[1:19:22] thought that God was going to come.
[1:19:26] But they failed to see the scripture
[1:19:27] that says he's going to be one a wild
[1:19:30] man that's going to be crying out in the
[1:19:32] wilderness, make ye way for the Lord.
[1:19:35] He's going to come. But they they
[1:19:38] thought he was a crazy man. A lot of
[1:19:40] people heard William Brandham. They
[1:19:42] heard his his teachings. They listen to
[1:19:44] the way he preached the word of God.
[1:19:46] They say, "This guy doesn't even know
[1:19:47] his own vocabulary properly. We got
[1:19:50] better vocabularies than he did.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; But he had the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; He had the word of the Lord.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's one thing that's going to
[1:20:00] catch the attention of the true sons and
[1:20:03] daughters of God. Not emotion, not
[1:20:06] atmosphere, not, "Oh, brother, that was
[1:20:09] a powerful message, man. Yeah, you
[1:20:11] because you're so charismatic, you get
[1:20:13] the people all wound up and you get them
[1:20:14] shouting and screaming." God wants you
[1:20:17] to recognize the word.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; That's what catches the attention of the
[1:20:21] sons and daughters of God. Amen.
[1:20:24] They failed to see the word. Amen. And
[1:20:27] now he goes on, go to the next slide. He
[1:20:29] says here in verse 11, I indeed, now
[1:20:31] he's telling them, I indeed baptize you
[1:20:34] with water unto repentance,
[1:20:37] but he that cometh after me is mightier
[1:20:40] than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to
[1:20:43] bear, he shall baptize you with the Holy
[1:20:46] Ghost and fire.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; And listen, here's the interpretation.
[1:20:51] whose fan is in his hand. And he will
[1:20:54] thoroughly purge his floor, and he'll
[1:20:57] gather his elect,
[1:21:00] his sons and daughters.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Those that have representation,
[1:21:05] those that have an attribute of God, the
[1:21:08] scripture says, those whose names were
[1:21:10] written in the Lamb's book of life from
[1:21:13] before the foundations of the world.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; God ain't some, you know, Mickey Mouse
[1:21:19] businessman. He's got his business all
[1:21:22] together. Amen. He knows exactly what
[1:21:24] he's doing. He knows exactly who you
[1:21:26] are. He knows when you were going to
[1:21:28] accept or reject him. You were going to
[1:21:31] do it by free moral agency. You weren't
[1:21:33] going to do it by by some robotic
[1:21:36] sensation. No, it's going to make sense
[1:21:39] to you. It's going to it's going to
[1:21:41] register in you. It's going to it's
[1:21:42] going to set off something inside of
[1:21:45] you. You don't know why, but you just
[1:21:47] believe.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, that's that's a true son
[1:21:51] or daughter of God. They'll tell you,
[1:21:52] "No, no, I believe God. I may not see it
[1:21:56] yet, but I believe it until I see it."
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Because I already know that with God,
[1:22:00] all things are possible. There's nothing
[1:22:02] impossible for God.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Until you get to that place where the
[1:22:06] absolute is that God can do anything.
[1:22:08] Don't you put any restriction on God.
[1:22:10] The minute you do that, you've limited
[1:22:13] yourself to God's blessings.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; God can do absolutely anything. whatever
[1:22:19] he wants. And he says, "I'm going to
[1:22:20] gather in all the wheat into the garner,
[1:22:23] but he will burn up the chaff with
[1:22:25] unquenchable fire, and then come Jesus
[1:22:29] from Galilee to Jordan unto John to be
[1:22:32] baptized of him." You think that God is
[1:22:35] going to bypass his own word?
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; No, sir. And look what John goes on to
[1:22:40] say. I'm just going to read it. It's not
[1:22:41] up there, but I'm going to read it. But
[1:22:43] John forbade him, saying,
[1:22:46] I have need to be baptized of thee, and
[1:22:49] comest thou to me? You see, he knew who
[1:22:52] he was. Amen. Jesus answering said unto
[1:22:56] him, suffer it to be so now, for thus it
[1:22:58] becometh us to fulfill all the word.
[1:23:03] All the word. If God is going to birth
[1:23:06] sons and daughters of God, he's going to
[1:23:08] do it the same way. He listen Jesus the
[1:23:12] purpose that he would come and become
[1:23:14] God in man was so that he could make a
[1:23:17] way for us to get back to where we were
[1:23:20] before we got caught here.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; We bypassed our theophes to come into
[1:23:25] this dimension. But this process that
[1:23:28] Jesus uh did 2,000 years ago was the
[1:23:33] antidote to restore us back to where we
[1:23:37] could receive our theophes right now in
[1:23:41] this age and in this dispensation.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; This is what we are in the process of.
[1:23:48] You having made contact by revelation to
[1:23:51] the word of God means you made contact
[1:23:53] with your eternal body.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's already hovering
[1:23:59] around you. Just like a mother just
[1:24:01] prepared to give birth to a child, the
[1:24:03] spirit is waiting for that child, the
[1:24:06] breath of God comes in, the life of God
[1:24:08] comes into that child when it takes that
[1:24:10] first breath and it becomes a living
[1:24:12] soul. Amen. Praise God. And here Jesus
[1:24:16] is saying that that when he and and
[1:24:18] Jesus when he was baptized went up
[1:24:20] straightway out of the water. He went
[1:24:22] into the water. shows that he got
[1:24:24] baptized in water. People say, "I got
[1:24:26] baptized as a baby. It's good enough."
[1:24:28] It ain't good enough. You need to be
[1:24:31] rebaptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:24:34] Christ, fully immersed and buried so
[1:24:37] your old life can be left behind.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; And then you shall receive the gift,
[1:24:45] read it, Acts 2:38,
[1:24:47] the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[1:24:50] Amen. Praise God. A lot of people think
[1:24:54] that, oh, if I just get baptized, then
[1:24:56] I'm saved. No, that's just the
[1:24:58] beginning.
[1:25:00] Glory. And he saw the spirit of God
[1:25:03] descending like a dove and lighting upon
[1:25:05] him. And lo, a voice from heaven,
[1:25:07] saying, "This is my beloved son in whom
[1:25:11] I am well pleased."
[1:25:14] So Jesus now was displaying that he was
[1:25:17] now going into his public ministry. And
[1:25:21] in order for him to go into the into the
[1:25:25] next stage of his ministry,
[1:25:28] he needed to receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:25:32] You think what? Yes. Did you hear what
[1:25:36] the voice said? This is the human vessel
[1:25:40] that I am going to put my spirit in,
[1:25:44] that I'm pleased to dwell in, to be in.
[1:25:48] Because in that Holy Ghost anointing and
[1:25:52] baptism that Jesus received right there
[1:25:55] in the water in order to fulfill the
[1:25:56] word would place him into the purpose of
[1:26:00] God to go to Calvary.
[1:26:03] It was that anointing that came on him
[1:26:06] which was the purpose of God now by the
[1:26:09] Holy Ghost by the person of God himself
[1:26:14] coming in to to to empower him to give
[1:26:17] him the power to give him the strength.
[1:26:19] Remember he was still a man but he was
[1:26:23] God and man united.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; He was listen when he went to Gethsemane
[1:26:28] he said oh God take away this cup. He
[1:26:32] came to the grips of having to go
[1:26:34] because he saw what he would have to
[1:26:36] face in that crucifixion.
[1:26:38] And you know that God, brother Bram said
[1:26:41] that God actually left him in Gethsemane
[1:26:43] because God could not go to the cross.
[1:26:46] The sin
[1:26:48] that was on you was taken upon him
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; so that he could take it to the cross
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; so that you now would have the blood,
[1:26:59] the formula, the Holy Ghost. He says,
[1:27:02] listen, there's a scripture that says
[1:27:04] that they that they that they were not
[1:27:06] empowered yet. Out of your belly shall
[1:27:08] flow rivers of living waters. It was
[1:27:11] talking about the Holy Ghost coming back
[1:27:13] on the people, but it had not yet been
[1:27:16] given up because the Holy Ghost had to
[1:27:19] come back on the people in order to
[1:27:22] start this process of bringing us back
[1:27:25] to our eternal destinations,
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; our eternal bodies.
[1:27:32] Hallelujah. So here now, we got five
[1:27:36] minutes and then we're going to end it
[1:27:37] right here.
[1:27:40] Let's go to the
[1:27:43] next quote.
[1:27:47] Jesus brought God to human lives.
[1:27:50] This is what was taking place. God was
[1:27:54] made human. When Jesus was born, God
[1:27:58] became man
[1:28:00] that he might become fellowship with man
[1:28:05] in man to what? achieve one purpose and
[1:28:09] that is to bring to man what God is. Not
[1:28:14] what a church is
[1:28:16] but what God is.
[1:28:20] This is what's going to change and put
[1:28:23] us in the rapture.
[1:28:26] What God is. He says here Jesus came
[1:28:30] that he might present God to man and man
[1:28:34] didn't want it.
[1:28:37] Jesus came that he might and man didn't
[1:28:39] want it. The Holy Spirit comes today in
[1:28:41] like manner to present God to man which
[1:28:45] is by the Holy Ghost. But man wants to
[1:28:48] go to church
[1:28:50] wants to replace. He wants to just make
[1:28:52] a church experience the Holy Spirit in
[1:28:54] their lives. No. No. He says, watch it.
[1:28:58] It drowns his thinking. He cannot he
[1:29:01] cannot fathom it. And we must learn that
[1:29:04] God is not known by intellectual
[1:29:07] conception. God is known by the new
[1:29:10] birth,
[1:29:12] by the Holy Ghost, not by any other way.
[1:29:16] Jesus, the Bible has plainly quoted us
[1:29:19] that no man can call Jesus the Christ
[1:29:22] only by the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:26] And if you've never received the Holy
[1:29:28] Ghost, you don't know that he is the
[1:29:31] Christ. For that's the only way
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; that you will that he reveals himself.
[1:29:36] It's the only way that he reveals
[1:29:38] himself.
[1:29:40] Now, I want you to notice
[1:29:43] God was doing this and yet the people of
[1:29:46] that day could not recognize that he was
[1:29:49] what he was doing because John was
[1:29:51] baptizing unto repentance.
[1:29:55] Why was he bapti? Why was he offering
[1:29:57] baptism unto repentance? You ever think
[1:30:00] of that? What did they have to repent
[1:30:02] of?
[1:30:05] They see John knew that there was no way
[1:30:09] that they were going to receive God in
[1:30:11] the way that he was going to come.
[1:30:13] He knew by the way that they were
[1:30:16] treating him, by the way they had
[1:30:18] rejected him, by the way that they had
[1:30:21] rejected the word, by the way that that
[1:30:24] Herod had sent out a decree to kill all
[1:30:28] the firstborn when when the when even
[1:30:30] the the the the rumor was heard of a of
[1:30:32] a of a Messiah,
[1:30:36] he knew that the that the the the people
[1:30:39] could not receive. So they had to repent
[1:30:42] of the condition that they were in. They
[1:30:46] would never receive Christ. And those
[1:30:48] that heard John and recognized John,
[1:30:52] they received the baptism of John and
[1:30:57] they were at least now at least able to
[1:31:01] receive the Holy Ghost
[1:31:04] when it was to be made available.
[1:31:08] John knew the condition of the people
[1:31:10] just like William Branham when he came
[1:31:13] he knew the condition of the people. He
[1:31:16] saw that that the people the Holy Spirit
[1:31:18] had had revealed to him that the that
[1:31:21] that Luther had a portion of the word.
[1:31:23] Wesley had a portion of the word.
[1:31:25] Pentecost had a portion of the word. But
[1:31:27] they needed to receive the giver of the
[1:31:30] word
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; because the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:34] only makes way for the Holy Ghost
[1:31:37] himself.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. They were
[1:31:42] bound by the tra their own traditions.
[1:31:46] They got bound by their own ways that
[1:31:48] they expected God to come on the scene
[1:31:50] and reveal himself and and give them the
[1:31:53] Holy Ghost.
[1:31:57] they wouldn't be able to recognize to
[1:31:59] accept John's message and being baptized
[1:32:02] opened the door for the for the new
[1:32:06] birth now to be recognized because every
[1:32:08] time there's a dispensational change, it
[1:32:12] requires a new birth.
[1:32:17] I'm going to stop right there.
[1:32:19] Next week,
[1:32:22] we're going to look I'm just going to
[1:32:24] read one quote to you
[1:32:28] and then we're going to close it off.
[1:32:33] And this is the quote.
[1:32:36] It's from spiritual amnesia.
[1:32:39] And this is what we're going to be
[1:32:40] looking at next week. A new birth is
[1:32:43] required in this hour.
[1:32:47] You need the Holy Ghost
[1:32:51] dispensation for the bride age to
[1:32:54] receive Christ in the present day.
[1:32:56] Listen what brother Bram says. He says,
[1:32:57] "You that wants the Holy Spirit, you
[1:33:00] wants the experience, not an emotional
[1:33:03] excitement. You want the Holy Ghost, the
[1:33:06] life, the germ of life inside you. and
[1:33:11] you want to get rid of that amnesia
[1:33:14] that's making you you can't identify
[1:33:17] yourself. You see, when the Holy Ghost
[1:33:20] comes into your life, it not only
[1:33:23] identifies who God is, it identifies
[1:33:26] your relationship to God. It gives you
[1:33:29] your identity. It places you in the day
[1:33:33] that you're living in to recognize the
[1:33:35] word that's being brought forth and what
[1:33:38] it is that you are actually supposed to
[1:33:40] manifest in this hour. And he says here,
[1:33:43] you can't identify yourself. You don't
[1:33:46] know where you stand. You don't know
[1:33:48] what you are. Let's get rid of it right
[1:33:51] now. There is a new birth here for you.
[1:33:56] A real genuine new birth.
[1:34:01] Praise God forever more. Let the
[1:34:03] musicians come.
[1:34:08] We're going to be looking a little
[1:34:09] deeper into this next week, saints.
[1:34:12] We're going to look at the
[1:34:14] manifestations
[1:34:16] of the Holy Ghost and the stages of our
[1:34:19] walk with God and how it is that you can
[1:34:22] actually come, you can repent,
[1:34:26] you can be sanctified
[1:34:28] and you think that you can sanctify
[1:34:30] yourself.
[1:34:32] You think that you can get sanctified.
[1:34:34] Do you know what the word sanctified
[1:34:36] means? It means God getting the things
[1:34:41] out of your life that are interfering
[1:34:43] with his purpose.
[1:34:45] That's what he wants to sanctify you
[1:34:47] from. You could be doing great things.
[1:34:52] You're in the house of the Lord every
[1:34:53] Sunday. You're there at your posted
[1:34:55] duty, but all week long you're living
[1:34:58] your old life.
[1:35:04] It's good you're in the house of the
[1:35:05] Lord every week.
[1:35:08] It's good that you're here and you're
[1:35:09] praying,
[1:35:11] but how is it affecting you in the way
[1:35:14] that you're going to go out there and
[1:35:20] draw other people to Christ? Bring that
[1:35:22] last one in. Anoint the atmospheres
[1:35:26] around your work.
[1:35:28] And and and you listen, this is this is
[1:35:31] coming to a to to a point, saints. We've
[1:35:34] we've got to get serious with the word.
[1:35:37] We can't we can't just go on the way
[1:35:39] that we are. If the Holy Ghost is just
[1:35:42] about coming to church and and you know
[1:35:45] doing a routine every week and coming up
[1:35:47] here and singing some songs and letting
[1:35:48] the preacher say a few good sermons and
[1:35:51] then we leave here and and nothing
[1:35:52] changes in our lives. No, no, no real
[1:35:55] transformation, no real change. Remember
[1:35:58] when the Holy Ghost comes in, the old
[1:36:01] nature comes under under a a a smashing.
[1:36:05] It starts to get broken. It starts to
[1:36:07] get shattered. All the things that you
[1:36:09] thought were the way that you should
[1:36:11] live and the way that you should act and
[1:36:13] and and your life, it starts to break
[1:36:16] up. It starts to it's you know, there's
[1:36:18] a work for you to do. There is a
[1:36:20] sanctification process and you're a part
[1:36:22] of that sanctification process. And when
[1:36:24] and that's why we need to assemble
[1:36:26] ourselves every Sunday, every Wednesday
[1:36:28] night because the only thing that's
[1:36:30] going to sanctify you is the word. Amen.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that's going to
[1:36:35] that's going to sanctify give you the
[1:36:37] power by the word. The scripture says in
[1:36:41] Ephesians, the washing by the washing of
[1:36:44] the waters by the word you get washed
[1:36:47] and you get cleansed and you get
[1:36:49] separated. Remember water is is a is a
[1:36:52] is a is is a a type of separation. Your
[1:36:56] old life, you got to leave that old life
[1:36:58] completely behind.
[1:37:00] That's the process of the Holy Ghost in
[1:37:03] your life. Not easy. But hey, he never
[1:37:08] said you're going to be perfect here.
[1:37:10] And brother Brandham said that this old
[1:37:12] nature is going to be sticky right to
[1:37:14] the very end. You're going to have to
[1:37:16] deal with this old nature. Amen. Praise
[1:37:18] God. Let me stop right there. Praise
[1:37:21] God. Let's go to the Lord's supper.
[1:37:23] Amen. Let's change the order of the
[1:37:24] service. Let the brothers prepare
[1:37:26] themselves.
[1:37:27] Amen. Let's just sing one song. Brother,
[1:37:32] are you washed
[1:37:35] by the blood?
[1:37:37] Glory to God.
[1:37:40] What key is that in?
[1:37:43] [Music]
[1:37:45] Are you washed
[1:37:48] in the blood?
[1:37:51] In the soul cleansing blood of the lamb.
[1:37:57] Are your garments spotless? Are they
[1:38:00] white as snow? Are you washed in the
[1:38:04] blood of the lamb?
[1:38:08] Oh, have you been to Jesus for the
[1:38:12] cleansing? How are you washed in the
[1:38:16] blood of the lamb?
[1:38:20] Are you fully trusting in his grace?
[1:38:24] Divide. Are you washed in the blood of
[1:38:28] the lamb?
[1:38:30] Are you washed
[1:38:34] in the blood?
[1:38:36] In the soul cleansing blood of the lamb?
[1:38:42] Are your garments spotless? Are they
[1:38:45] white? As nor are you washed in the
[1:38:50] blood of the lamb.
[1:38:53] Are you walking daily by the Savior's
[1:38:58] side? Are you washed in the blood of the
[1:39:02] lamb?
[1:39:04] Are you wash this moment in the
[1:39:08] crucified?
[1:39:10] Are you washed in the blood of the lamb?
[1:39:15] For you are
[1:39:18] in the blood,
[1:39:21] in the soul cleansing blood of the lamb.
[1:39:26] Are your garments spotless are they
[1:39:30] white as snow are you washed in the
[1:39:34] blood of the lamb.
[1:39:38] [Music]
[1:39:40] Amen. Praise God.
[1:39:42] Let's just uh put up the um Lord's
[1:39:46] Supper presentation.
[1:39:48] Amen. Glory to God.
[1:39:55] I'm going to read here
[1:40:01] from Corinthians chap 10 16 and 17.
[1:40:07] The scripture says, "The cup of blessing
[1:40:09] which we bless, is it not the communion
[1:40:12] of the blood of Christ,
[1:40:16] the bread which we break,
[1:40:18] is it not the communion of the body of
[1:40:22] Christ?"
[1:40:24] Paul is asking in question here.
[1:40:27] When we come into the communion, when we
[1:40:29] come into the Lord's supper, I trust
[1:40:32] we're coming in
[1:40:35] and it's about a communion
[1:40:37] within the body
[1:40:40] that the body, the bread representing
[1:40:44] the body, you should be including
[1:40:46] yourself now in this body.
[1:40:50] And the Lord's supper when we do it,
[1:40:53] we're doing it in communion by
[1:40:55] revelation that now the word is in us
[1:41:00] and that we are remembering what the
[1:41:03] Lord did. It was the it was it's what
[1:41:06] brought us together. It's what's given
[1:41:09] us communion. And that's why Paul is
[1:41:12] saying this is about communion around
[1:41:14] the revelation. The wine which
[1:41:16] represents the revelation of the word.
[1:41:19] It's bringing us together by revelation
[1:41:23] into a fellowship
[1:41:25] into a a a a supernatural
[1:41:30] uh connection and unity within the body
[1:41:34] of Christ that gives us a a a power to
[1:41:39] live and to manifest the word of God in
[1:41:42] this day and in this hour. The Lord's
[1:41:44] supper means so much more than just
[1:41:47] remembering Jesus, what he did at the
[1:41:49] cross. That's a finished work. It's
[1:41:53] finished, saints. He himself said, "It
[1:41:55] is finished."
[1:41:57] But he's now given us his word, the
[1:42:00] bread, and his spirit, the wine, so that
[1:42:04] we can now commune and live and manifest
[1:42:08] the body.
[1:42:11] and the purpose that God had in going to
[1:42:13] Calvary. And so for for we being many
[1:42:17] are one bread. See, he's he's saying now
[1:42:20] even though there's many of us here, we
[1:42:22] are the one body and one body. For we
[1:42:26] are all partakers of that one bread.
[1:42:29] We're all feeding now on the word.
[1:42:33] This is the Holy Ghost.
[1:42:36] This is his desire. This is his purpose.
[1:42:40] when we come together in the unity of
[1:42:42] the faith to take the Lord's supper.
[1:42:48] The next scripture says here in
[1:42:50] Corinthians
[1:42:52] chapter 11 verse 23-2,
[1:42:57] for I have received of the Lord that
[1:43:00] which also I delivered unto you,
[1:43:04] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:43:07] which he was betrayed took bread.
[1:43:12] He understood. In other words, he Paul
[1:43:14] had a revelation of what Jesus was
[1:43:17] doing. Jesus was restoring us. He knew
[1:43:21] exactly why the bread had to be broken,
[1:43:24] why the body had to be broken, why his
[1:43:27] blood had to be spilled.
[1:43:31] Jesus, the Lord Jesus, the same night in
[1:43:33] which he was betrayed, took bread, and
[1:43:35] when he had given thanks, imagine he was
[1:43:39] giving thanks because he knew that this
[1:43:41] was going to this was going to finish it
[1:43:45] all. It was going to finish the part
[1:43:48] that he had in order to bring us back
[1:43:51] into that fellowship with him. Amen. And
[1:43:53] he break it and he give thanks. And he
[1:43:55] break it and said, "Take, eat. This is
[1:43:59] my body which is broken for you.
[1:44:04] This do in remembrance of me." Brother
[1:44:07] Desmond or Brother Phillip, would you
[1:44:10] please take the bread
[1:44:12] [Music]
[1:44:13] and give thanks unto the Lord? And let's
[1:44:15] all just bow our heads unto the Lord.
[1:44:18] [Music]
[1:44:25] [Music]
[1:44:42] [Music]
[1:44:46] Amen.
[1:44:48] After the same manner also he took the
[1:44:50] cup and when he had sucked, saying,
[1:44:52] "This cup is the new testament in my
[1:44:55] blood. This do ye as often as you drink
[1:44:58] it in remembrance of me. Brother
[1:45:01] Desmond, would you give thanks for the
[1:45:04] wine?
[1:45:06] It's not the literal blood of Jesus
[1:45:08] Christ.
[1:45:11] It represents the Holy Ghost that's in
[1:45:14] you now.
[1:45:18] [Music]
[1:45:33] [Music]
[1:45:46] Oh Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:45:54] [Music]
[1:46:01] Amen. Praise God. You can begin to give
[1:46:05] out the bread.
[1:46:07] Maybe another brother on each end
[1:46:11] will assist.
[1:46:14] But as this is taking place here, Paul
[1:46:18] tells us to examine ourselves
[1:46:22] to truly examine our hearts and and our
[1:46:25] lives. And you know,
[1:46:29] for this reason, you know, people living
[1:46:32] wrong, living hypocritical lives and
[1:46:35] then thinking that they can just come
[1:46:37] into the house of the Lord and eat the
[1:46:39] bread and drink the wine.
[1:46:42] Now, I'm saying that, but I'm also
[1:46:44] saying that if your heart cries out to
[1:46:48] God and truly repents
[1:46:52] and exam, that's why he says, "Examine
[1:46:53] yourself."
[1:46:55] Examine yourself and say, "Lord, I I
[1:46:58] made I made a lot of mistakes this week.
[1:47:00] I made a lot of mistakes. Lord, I need
[1:47:04] your spirit to come and cleanse me so
[1:47:07] that so that you can wipe these this sin
[1:47:10] out of my life. You can blot the sins
[1:47:14] out of my life. Blot it out of my own
[1:47:16] memory. Lord, take it away
[1:47:19] so that I can approach you in the right
[1:47:21] way.
[1:47:23] He is faithful.
[1:47:26] He is faithful to to to forgive you and
[1:47:29] to release you if you truly repent.
[1:47:32] That's what that's what the church is
[1:47:34] all about. People say, you know, I don't
[1:47:36] need to go to church. You know why you
[1:47:39] need to go to church is because you need
[1:47:41] to hear the word tell you that you are
[1:47:43] forgiven. That you it's it's where you
[1:47:45] can you it's where you can confess your
[1:47:48] faults one to another. It's where you
[1:47:49] can fellowship around the word and allow
[1:47:52] the Holy Spirit to deal with you and to
[1:47:55] cleanse you of the things of this world
[1:47:58] so that you can live a life
[1:48:03] under the purpose of God.
[1:48:07] That's a holy life.
[1:48:10] A life that's set aside for the Lord to
[1:48:13] use you in the way that he wants to use
[1:48:15] you in this day and in this hour.
[1:48:18] We're not called just to be church
[1:48:20] members. Say, "Lord,
[1:48:23] fill me with with that desire to to give
[1:48:26] testimony of what you're doing in this
[1:48:28] hour. Give me the boldness. Give me the
[1:48:30] courage to be a faithful witness of this
[1:48:33] word that you've placed in my heart.
[1:48:36] Lord,
[1:48:39] this is what the communion is about.
[1:48:42] Understanding that God wants you to know
[1:48:44] that he's in the body. He's in you. He's
[1:48:48] with you. He wants to He wants to stir
[1:48:51] you. He wants to bless you. He wants to
[1:48:53] prosper you. He wants to give you all
[1:48:56] that you have need of. But remember,
[1:48:59] it's got to line up with his purpose for
[1:49:02] your life. And that's where we need to
[1:49:05] surrender and say, "Lord, take away any
[1:49:07] of the things that are going to
[1:49:08] interfere with your purpose in my life."
[1:49:16] Examine yourself.
[1:49:26] Thank you, Lord.

[1:52:05] At this time,
[1:52:07] let us all partake of the bread together
[1:52:11] in the unity of the spirit
[1:52:14] and Giving thanks.
[1:52:19] [Music]
[1:52:25] [Music]
[1:52:44] And now as we partake of this wine,
[1:52:48] we know that it is not transformed into
[1:52:51] the blood of the Lord Jesus, but it
[1:52:54] represents the Holy Spirit in our lives
[1:52:59] that we've accepted it, we believe it,
[1:53:03] we know what what it does, what it's to
[1:53:07] produce in our lives. We recognize it
[1:53:10] and we accept it with thanksgiving in
[1:53:12] our hearts. Blessed be the name of the
[1:53:14] Lord. God bless you.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us just give thanks unto the
[1:53:31] Lord.
[1:53:34] Oh Jesus,
[1:53:37] thank you so much. Father,
[1:53:40] blessed be your wonderful name, oh God.
[1:53:42] We magnify thee, oh God. We give you the
[1:53:44] glory, Lord. We welcome you into our
[1:53:46] lives, Lord. We welcome a fresh start in
[1:53:50] our lives, Lord. Lord, a a refreshing
[1:53:52] from your presence, oh God. A fresh new
[1:53:55] start, a fresh new walk, Lord Jesus. We
[1:53:58] are so grateful, Lord. Blessed be the
[1:54:01] name of the Lord God. Hallelujah.
[1:54:04] Amen. Let us
[1:54:06] let us read from St. John chapter 13. So
[1:54:11] after he had washed their feet and had
[1:54:14] taken his garments and was set down
[1:54:16] again, he said unto them, "Know ye what
[1:54:19] I have done to you?
[1:54:22] Ye call me master and lord, and ye say
[1:54:25] well, for so I am. And if I then, your
[1:54:29] Lord and Master, have washed your feet,
[1:54:32] ye also ought to wash one another's
[1:54:35] feet.
[1:54:36] For I have given you an example that you
[1:54:39] should do as I have done.
[1:54:44] And so at this time, we will be washing
[1:54:47] one another's feet. And as we do that,
[1:54:51] we pray for one another. We ask Lord
[1:54:55] wash away any place that they may have
[1:55:00] gone.
[1:55:01] Maybe their feet took them into some
[1:55:04] unbelief somewhere. Lord, wash it away.
[1:55:07] It represents humility when we pray one
[1:55:11] for the other. When we can take on one
[1:55:14] another's burdens and pray for one
[1:55:16] another, understanding one another, that
[1:55:19] we are human, that we make mistakes,
[1:55:21] that we can make mistakes. Don't be
[1:55:23] washing, you know, your brother's feet
[1:55:25] or your sister's feet with any kind of
[1:55:27] thought in your mind or any lying spirit
[1:55:30] that the that the enemy would try to
[1:55:31] put, oh, I know this and I know that.
[1:55:34] You don't know nothing. This is where
[1:55:36] God allows us to come and and repent and
[1:55:40] be and be washed and be cleansed of the
[1:55:43] old life and the things that we
[1:55:45] sometimes do in making mistakes as human
[1:55:49] beings.
[1:55:51] So, I'm going to have a closing prayer.
[1:55:55] I'm going to ask brother Philillip to
[1:55:56] come and close us in prayer now. And
[1:55:59] then the sisters will be able to leave
[1:56:03] and go and
[1:56:05] wash each other's feet. And the brothers
[1:56:06] will stay and we will wash each other's
[1:56:09] feet and then we will be dismissed.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, gracious God. We so grateful and
[1:56:17] thankful that by your grace we be
[1:56:19] partakers of this communion in
[1:56:21] remembrance of you. Lord, as we come
[1:56:24] into the second part of washing each
[1:56:27] another's feet, may you bless the saints
[1:56:30] as they wash feet. Bless everything that
[1:56:33] we do, Lord, in the name of our Lord
[1:56:36] Jesus Christ and take us to our various
[1:56:38] homes and bring us back the following
[1:56:40] week on Wednesday. God bless the
[1:56:42] Wednesday services and bless everything
[1:56:45] we do in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Thank you, brother Phillip.
[1:56:52] God bless you saints. Have a wonderful
[1:56:54] week.
[1:56:56] Go out and think about go back and
[1:57:00] listen to you know the messages brother
[1:57:03] Brandham ministered on what is the Holy
[1:57:05] Ghost and what was the Holy Ghost given
[1:57:07] for. go back and you're going to see and
[1:57:10] hear things that you never you just you
[1:57:12] thought, "Wow, praise God." You know,
[1:57:16] the prophet had revelation, but you
[1:57:20] know, when something comes out in its
[1:57:21] season, it's just sweet. It's just so
[1:57:24] sweet. Amen. Praise God. God bless you
[1:57:27] all.
