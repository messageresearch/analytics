have a very simple message it's christmas time and we just have a message we'd like to bring to you out of matthew chapter 2 verses 1 and 2. the scripture has been read so many times and we'll read it again for we know that god is eternal now when jesus was born in bethlehem in judea of judea in the days of herod the king behold there came wise men from the east to jerusalem saying where is he that is born king of the jews for we have seen his star and are come to worship him mean lord bless the reading of his word here today father we ask your blessing upon the word we pray that the great holy spirit will send forth his light and his truth and oh god drive away the darkness of unbelief and ignorance superstition and fear may the great light of god enlighten the darkness in the human spirit and reveal to us what we need to know in the hour and day in which we live filled with crisis and chaos but thank you lord in the middle of it we can flee to christ and find a place of safety and rest in jesus name amen and amen may the lord bless the word and please be seated as we go into the word of god i'm aware a lot of you have emails you've got names you've got problems you've got situations and it's being prayed over that god will reach out and make your needs uh your problems solved your needs met your body's healed amen in every possible way now uh i'd like to go um to the news i'm reading from the news and i'd like you to listen as i read from the current news christmas star set to light up the night on december 21st with this year's winter solstice comes more than just confirmation of our our already cold weather and fleeting daylight a rare christmas star to appear in the skies a great conjunction of stars is happening on december 21st 2020 it is the meeting of the planets jupiter and saturn then rare celestial event christmas star will the star of bethlehem appear on december 21st i'm just reading just the headlines and some of these things christmas star what does the bible say about december 21st the great conjunction that's about to take place now brothers and sisters oh um lots of people have christmas trees how many know what a christmas tree is how many of you know oh you know what a christmas tree is okay uh praise the lord uh and people decorate the christmas tree and put all kinds of things on the christmas trees and uh most of the time on the top of the tree they'll have a star and the star sits on the top of the tree now i'm quoting from holiday history which says decorating a christmas tree ahead of the holidays is a family tradition in many households memories come to life while unpacking ornaments streaming lights hanging tinsel on the tree young children vying for the honor to be trust lifted into the air and to nestle an ornament onto the top of the tree and that will either be a star or an angel which is the most common top for a christmas tree but originally the infant jesus is the one who adorned the top of christmas trees however however this trend later evolved instead of a baby on the top of the tree into a star which are both significant christian symbols in the nativity of jesus of course the star of bethlehem is also referred to as the christmas star that guided the wise men are the magic to the birthplace of christ in classic christian story of jesus of nazareth's birth see praise god i'll stop there as far as that is concerned hallelujah i just wanted to make sure that i laid that foundation that you're aware now what actually happened is that the lord gave me this thought of the of the significance of the christmas star and i had already written a few notes by hand on uh some papers actually praise the lord i still have the original year of all my scribbles and scrolls and um while thinking on these things you know i had to talk to brother eastman in new york and while talking with him from one thing to the other he said oh he said did you hear of this astonishing event that's taken place uh you should look at it on december 21st they were supposed to be the christmas stars appearing after over 800 years it's suddenly coming again and appearing in the skies i said what i said what did you say he said the christmas star is appearing i said oh my god i i'm already preparing uh a talk or a sermon on the christmas star he said what you sure you didn't read it in the newspapers or hear it in the news or somebody told you before i said no i said not at all it just struck me to focus on this so uh i said that the fact that you're telling me now just confirms to me that's what i'm supposed to speak about amen praise the lord hallelujah so i thank god for it and thank god for him and for the thought that was there expressed praise the lord hallelujah now of course we realize here that i want to talk about the significance of this christmas star the significance of it appearing at this time in the skies this is something that even the nominal christian world recognizes that it's a mystic star something is fixing to happen they don't understand what the significance of it is but here it is after 800 years suddenly putting in an appearance my god back in the bible matthew 2 1 2 our text we have heard it preached we have read it over time about the wise man following the star from the east coming towards the west and uh as they looked at the star they were in the east so the star had to be in the west and so they were going west towards this star and they looked follow the star in the sky but praise god i'm placing it into your heart and mind just a little droplet don't you said the thought uh look at the star in the sky that the wise men looked at back there that's not the star you are to look at now they looked at the one in the sky but you keep your eyes on the one in the tree praise god so i thank god that our star was on the top of golgotha's hill hanging on the top of our christmas tree and we give him praise and we give him thanks and we give him glory because he came down and gave his life for us and that's why he is the star of our lives that's why we said king of my life i crown thee now thine shall the glory be oh hallelujah because he is the star and the hope of our lives oh glory to god amen hallelujah my god we give him glory amen now before jesus was even born out of balaam's mouth came the prophecy that all jacob will rise a star amen a star would arise praise the lord and we thank god that this great star of numbers 2417 has arisen out of jacob now that was the very start and scripture that caused the wise men to recognize what was happening for when they saw that star appeared being wise men they had revelation which is what made them wise to recognize the significance of what was taking place and as i was looking online at some of this one of the astronomers was showing that way back then when the first star appeared it appeared in whatever constellation but then he showed it was under the sign of leo and virgo leo mainly and there it was shaped in the form of a lion and he said you know so when i saw that i realized oh so when the wise men looked they realized a king a newborn king out of the land of the tribe of judah is a right about to come up on the earth hallelujah glory to god amen i thank god that our star has appeared amen and our star which is a reflection of the great star god sent us a church age messenger and we by looking at that messenger recognize that the newborn word or the birth of the word was to take place which we know it has taken place oh praise god the seals are open all the swaddling clothes have been taken and here is the newborn world exposed and revealing itself that we are able to hold on to it praise god and bring all of our gifts and potentials that are in our lives and we give him all our talents we give him all our gifts we lay ourselves at his feet and we pray that he will take us and use us for his glory and honor amen that is the reason why i'm here to have a real christmas which is the worship of christ and the way to worship him is first you must recognize who he is or else you worship but you know not who you're washing but with the revelation you know who you worship not just using the word jesus or christ but recognizing who he is amen and laying your life at his feet amen praise god hallelujah so before he was born he was signified by a star hallelujah revelation 22 16 calls him the bright and the morning star glory be to god hallelujah jeremiah 31 35 he says and he the almighty giveth the stars to give us light praise god so the stars are here to give us light what about that bright and morning star it's to bring warning in your heart brother sister it's to drive away the gloom it's the hill the coming of the sun it's the hill the rising of the sun i thank god that the day star of peter has shined into our hearts and caused us to be able to see the light of this hour that we might walk truly with him for the glory of god amen hallelujah oh my when you look what do you see do you see what i see oh star a star oh hallelujah i see a star and the star i see is christ amen christ revealing his own word christ reveals his own prophet christ revealing his own people oh blessed be the name of the lord that's the reason why i'm here this morning beside myself because we are in the prophecy we are part of the prophecy and we are walking in the light of this hour glory of god hallelujah amen amen praise god long before us god sent a messenger and after that messenger there's a lot of lesser lights amen you know what i'm talking about i'm paying honor to all those men and ministers that came at the time of brother branham after the prophet and god used them in partial ways each one of them bringing out a part of the truth this one preached and he emphasized thunders the next one preached and he emphasized two soul the next one preached and he emphasized holiness or healing or something else but god use them for a purpose the real bride comes now looks at the whole thing and she sees the entire picture amen she doesn't just see a part of it but she sees the entire picture and gives glory and praise to god i thank god for men like brother coleman i thank god for men that brother vale i thank god hallelujah for every one of them i don't want to name all of them padarus and this one and that one and the other one there were so many of them that god was using in startling and marvelous wonderful ways but there were use of god to bring out a part of that truth so that when we look now we can take all of it and the thing fits together like a hand in the glove glory of god hallelujah and we give him praise and honor and glory for what he has given to us amen hallelujah amen yes sir now hallelujah when you see a star uh you know what it takes to be a star i'm not talking about the star in the sky she they're following the movie star but we are following the mystic star we are following the morning star while they're following the movie stars you know what it takes to be a star then you become famous you get credibility and people begin to follow you people begin to amp you or copy what you wear and how you dress or uh how you act and stuff like that what i'm saying is that the people of the world take politicians movie stars business leaders successful people and they make them into their stars and put them at the top of their tree but the top of our tree has one star and that star is jesus christ our lord hallelujah we want to be like him we want to walk like him move like him move in his spirit and be a part of his great economy we look around and you see all these young men young women they paint up and and they wear all kinds of shorts pants all kinds of various things that are contrary to the word of god and they are going after these stars of the world but we are looking our eyes on the bright and morning star who is jesus christ amen and we are following him and walking in the light of the world amen hallelujah thank god forevermore i give him glory and i give him praise praise god aren't you aren't you happy that he is our star he is the king of our lives and we want to crown him now as the song said thine shall the glory be hallelujah lest i forget gethsemane and calvary oh god may crown you back up divine submission and humility to the will and plan of god hallelujah yes sir so he was the great star that spoke to moses in the burning bush he was the pillar of fire amen he was the time he shined in that time of darkness lord of god hallelujah i believe as the prophetess said that he was the star that struck paul from off of his intellectual horse of higher learning and struck him to bite the dust my friends of humility and to cast off that and to put his faith in jesus christ and into present truth not dead truths buried in the libraries of the world but living present tense truth god revealing himself moment by moment making himself known and revealing himself to the true child of god hallelujah paul looking upon the person of the resurrected christ was struck by the brilliance from the effulgence of the light of god that was coming from the divine personage of jesus christ and you know a jew never says lord if you say lord you're saying god and he said lord who art thou lord and that god in that light answered i am jesus hallelujah whom thou persecuted us amen for he was in his people where he always is in the true believer so that when you're persecuting them you're rarely persecuting him and paul recognized that the star that struck him off of his horse was jesus christ the great pillar of fire came and struck him off of his horse praise god i'm so glad my friends that he's the same yesterday today and whatever oh star of wonder star of light star of wondrous beauty bright westward leading still proceeding guide us to that perfect light i want to share with you brother branham speaking listen god sent his angels before but he sent him zen to moses now but one night while in my office in that room when he appeared to me for he has appeared to me many times and when he did so he comes in the form of a star right i've seen him many times but then when it became visible it was a man the star was a man weighing about 200 pounds you see i was sitting in the room i was reading my scofield bible i heard something i looked up and i saw a light i thought it was an automobile turning the corner and the light reflecting in the room but this light got brighter and brighter i looked at the door there was no automobile and when i looked the light got greater and just above me when i looked there hung a great star and the light from the star was a a greenish yellowish green shining on the floor and out of that light of that star come walking through that light a man that looked like as i said before would weigh about 200 pounds he was a huge man whoa oh my he was more of an olive complexion he had dark eyes and was close to me as this microphone is right now on the platform and you know the microphone would be somewhere like here oh my and i couldn't speak and he said fear not i am sent from the presence of almighty god to tell you of your peculiar life your peculiar birth amen and this gift of divine healing that you must bear to the world peoples of the world if you'll be sincere and will get the people to believe you there will be no disease can stand before your prayer not even cancer oh my when he said i'll come to pass you'll tell the people their diseases and you will if you'll be reverent before long you'll tell the people even the sins of their lives and the things that they have done oh praise god friends i want to tell you it has come to pass now not the meeting now he's speaking now brother branham uh brother bosworth is speaking here and saying well he's in the building he wants to come to the platform and there come this brother with his wife and baby i walk to the platform and my see i traveled all over the world and thousands have called me a divine healer but i'm not a divine healer you see the preaching divine healing doesn't make me a divine healer more than preaching salvation will make a man a divine savior see oh my see but then about that time while i was speaking the glory and power of god came down and there happened to be a photographer standing there to shoot a picture and when he looked he almost had a heart attack it come in so many meetings a great world of fire moving oh my and that took the picture see here not long ago i was at the foot of spring feast spring street in jeffersonville in the month of august and there that world of fire come out of the skies visible to about 10 000 people on the banks moved to where i was the voice the voice screaming out of it oh hundreds fainted on the banks of the river and all the newspapers carried it mystic star appears over minister while baptizing oh my you see and while i was speaking of that one night here in the building i started praying for that little boy the mother and father brought he was crippled his feet were drawn up like with polio i was holding the little fellow in my arms and i was praying and while i was praying that light suddenly appeared and got real bright in my face with my eyes closed i thought the custodian had turned on the light oh my but i kept praying and it got brighter and brighter and brighter when i raise my head down come through the room that bright and morning star right up where i was holding the baby see i don't know what happened whether i dropped it or what happened but when i looked it hit the floor and the feet crooked feet straightened out oh my the mother sitting in the front raised her head and began screaming until she fainted and fell on the floor and the little boy started running around the platform hollering for his mother there in the corner was a nazarene girl pretty attractive young woman setting playing the piano when she looked and seen that star she threw up her hands got real white for she knew that she was intimate friends of that couple whose child was crippled and seeing what happened and seeing the star she ran away from that piano for she was playing to him the great physician now with snail you've heard it and there as soon as she ran away right before 5 000 people them ivory keys continued playing the great physician now is near the sympathizing jesus he speaks the true pink heart to chair no other name but he thought my friends it played not just one word one sentence but though it played the entire him through hundreds began screaming and pouring to the altar screaming at where with their handkerchiefs crying god have mercy on me a sinner i pray someone today hearing this will cry out in their home in their room in their heart oh god have mercy on me a sinner amen forgive me cleanse me of my sin and receive me into your kingdom as a child of god mr lacey looked and said well there's been a lot of hypocrites they've painted them saints and even the savior with lights around them but that was nothing but artists work but this this is not psychology this is not something else the optical light struck the the optical lens of this camera and psychology won't do that oh my praise god hallelujah it's real friends i said it's real and i know it's real because when the message came to me wild yet a boy young man in the nation of guyana just kicked out of the pentecostal denomination just started the first church in the message in that nation storms bricks bottles everything and thrown on top calls all kinds of names and after the service standing there with the four or five brothers on a bridge the site of a bridge talking and there was a bush behind them out of that bush came a ball of light about this size and it was not moving fast it was just moving slowly i didn't know whether because i read about brother branham i'm you know just imagining things or so so i said the brothers do you see anything so they turned around for their password to it and then they oh my god and they backed away there was this light rising up going slowly well i said well i still thought well we all follow the message of brother branham maybe maybe we're just imagining because we read so about him so i ran to my aunt's house which was like where this house is but across it was across a canal and so i ran over there and bang bang it was about midnight they were sleeping bang bang bang on the door so they came out said what's the matter boy what's going on i said do you see anything and they said oh my god what is that and there was the light moving so what is that what is it i i've never seen anything like and just about that time it went like this and took off like a rocket faster than light right up into the skies and disappeared oh my friends i don't know if that is what brother branham saw i don't know if that's the original pillar of fire but if it is then i was allowed to see it i was allowed to see it an experience that is real it's not a joke of course that caused me to believe the message even more because this is not somebody telling me i'm seeing it amen with my natural eyes and it takes spirituality to see that it was right there the sinners my were there they saw it amen and they recognized what it was my brothers and sister let me tell you the christmas star amen oh my was a reflection of the bright and morning star a reflection the christ our lord is born today he is born on the earth praise god i'm glad that i can say that he is born as the savior in the manger of my heart he lives in me praise god he walks in me amen and i give god pray praise and honor and glory for that amen hallelujah oh praise god hallelujah amen yes sir think about it oh my he says friends settle yourself down now the r has come upon us there's been a lot of playing religion and playing church but god is now calling out his people for his name amen oh my and he is vindicating it by signs and wonders now when i just came to the ministry he's speaking again an astronomer astrologer came to me speaking about cycles and and that this great star amen that came of the star that came back in the days of christ and how they represented shem ham and jeffers the sons of noah and so on like that these different stars yes see for you must recognize that those three wise men were following in actual fact three different stars in another place he said of course it was venus jupiter and saturn uh venus mars i think and saturn right together they were following different stars but when you see them stars moved in the heavens and came together as one on the earth the three who did not know each other moved on the earth and met each other at the bethlehem gate oh my following three different star but then they formed into one morning star that hung over christ oh my think of it and when they're separated they never went back to their orbits and never have since then oh my it was supernaturally given and so she said your gift your star was sent in commemoration of the greatest gift that god ever gave to the earth he sends back sometimes something in cycles something lesser but in commemoration of what he did the first time amen and i believe the significance of this christmas star that you can see in the sky anytime after 5 5 30 tomorrow night it'll be there for all to see amen but this time it's not three stars it's only two stars oh jupiter and saturn and there's going to be a conjunction which is another word for a mystic union gonna come together symbolizing christ and his church becoming one oh the first birth was the headship being born but now it's the son of man being revealed again in the bridefall and then the capstone or head comes down on your nights with the body making the full stature of a perfect man fulfilling the scripture in him dwelleth the fullness of the godhead bodily oh christ this body in the hour making himself known this is the house that he has built for himself not the house that solomon built but the house he has built for himself no you're not you are the temple of the living god and that the holy ghost lives in you by faith oh praise god amen amen amen oh think of it that here it is he is the same yesterday today and forever glory to god hallelujah amen they were watching for jacob's star to arise and here we are today watching as the old song said be you watching and waiting to what a sight to behold he's coming again lord of god so i'll be waiting and i'll be watching for we do not know what time he shall appear are you watching are you waiting are you looking for the rapture oh praise god i'm in expectation for the rapture it can be any day now our lord is coming oh praise his blessed holy name oh my for believing christians this is out of redemption by judgment christians sometimes are looked down upon and made fun of but we become warriors for christ amen who is a warrior in here for christ raise your hand up who is a warrior for christ oh praise god hallelujah oh my see oh wow they are warriors bloody word sprinkled in the blood hallelujah the old rugged cross going before us the morning star there lighting up our way leading us somewhere i don't care what the world says it's what god says the entire field belongs to us oh praise god hallelujah if this tabernacle be gone we've got another tabernacle waiting for us out yonder there is nothing for us to be scared about hallelujah oh my my my lord of god hallelujah that's the way it is hallelujah oh praise god he says you know i love nature law having a shadow i like to study nature and i got to studying the nature of a nightingale how he sits at night looks up to the stars and when he sees them he begins to sing and i thought oh what a lesson oh my oh if i said if i could walk out tonight and ask that star little star what makes you shine if the little star could speak back he'd say brother branham it really isn't me shining amen it's the sun that is shining on me that causes meat to shine that's the way it is with every true born again christian their lives give off a testimony or something giving that testimony living a life for christ then it's not the individual see it's the holy spirit in them reflecting back his light through that individual making his light to shine in a dark sinkers world oh glory to god i'm glad i'm a part of that i said i'm not glad i'm a part of that i'm a glad i'm a chip off of the old diamond i'm glad that i'm just one little facet to shine one light amen my the color of my light might be different from the color of your light but whatever all these mystic lights come together they make up the great light hallelujah of the great mystic star the christmas star the morning star the bright and morning star hallelujah oh my oh praise god forevermore what is it oh praise god the morning star is only reflecting the supreme light of the sun that is soon to come the morning star is so bright amen it hails the coming of the sun and that's what we are doing we are saying even so come lord jesus even so come lord and we are in this world to heal the coming of the sun so why don't you morning stars that are here today it's time to get up and go healing his coming shine you morning stars rise up shine for the light is come and the sun will rise upon thee or praise god more and more revelation will come to you god will make himself known to you more and more hallelujah o praise god when we see the morning stars rising and shining to the glory of the resurrection of jesus christ it shows that the supreme one is now pressing his way in oh praise god he's coming back he's pressing his way his darkness in this world unlike the angel that came to daniel and said i had to fight my way through he's pressing his way back to us amen it's rapture time praise god it's rapture our praise god oh hallelujah that's our christmas amen christ on the tree the star on the tree amen dying for our sins living in love me dying you save me thank god forevermore oh my see the supreme one is pressing in and while he is doing that the other lights are gathering are you gathering here today are you gathering around the world while the other lights are out gathering in praise god but the morning star is shouting to them hold on it won't be long until it's daylight hold on keep holding on oh my a sister murphy used to sing just keep holding on daylight is soon coming oh praise god hold on for these morning stars are now shining in the world lighting up the world before the great darkness that is amongst them shining but a great thunderbolt from heaven is coming it's the coming of the lord oh glory to god are you watching for the thunderbolt you're not scared of the seven thunders matter of fact when it thunders you know it's god speaking hallelujah oh praise god is the voice of god to the age age hallelujah i'm glad that god predestinated me to be nothing but a stargazer somebody said brother simon why are you talking about the seven star messenger over and over again because i'm a stargazer amen i like to look at the stars natural spiritual and to gain the spiritual significance of what the star is reflecting amen praise god hallelujah them angels came and sang to the shepherds amen and them maggies stargazers in the east followed that mysterious star of light to the west that led them to the christ amen i'm glad friends i read another place where he says don't you know that the morning star the eastern star and the western star or evening star is really the same star it depends on the time of the day and where you are standing whether you will call it morning or evening just like we are in the world today amen the one part is in darkness and one is in light he says just depends on where you're standing and we were standing in the seventh church age so we've seen the star in the west but but it's now going back east again glory to god hallelujah i'm glad that god made these things known to us that our eyes have been opened the eyes of our heart has been opened oh praise god aren't you glad for as the star appeared to them then listen to this so has the holy ghost appeared to you now oh glory to god you see that parallel the star appeared to them them to do what to lead them to the perfect light and now the holy ghost has appeared to you so that you do not go the mechanical way by putting your name on some book and settle down and say you are born again oh my receive the holy ghost and he will lead you to christ he will lead you to a deep life a spirit-filled life a happy life being led by the spirit is that message oh my praise god i i love that praise god even as the star led those three wise men to the christ even now the holy spirit who is the star anyway is leading us to the perfect light he will guide you into all truth and show you things to come don't you understand friends out of question and answers uh he says here don't you understand what i'm saying that the stars of in the heavens represents the spirits of man here on the earth amen oh don't you realize that you are a star every christian is a star a star to guide the lost to guide to weary to guide the traveler all those who are seeking him a star cannot do it by itself it must be led by the blessed holy spirit and you are to reflect the brilliancy of god within your life do you believe it amen you must abstain from the things of the world and to live godly and soberly in this present light life to reflect the light of the great one that has shined on you amen we're reflecting the light of him who has shined upon us lord of god what are we then to do we are to rise and shine for the light of god to the dying and the depths of the darkness of this world and reflect and shine the very presence of the lord jesus hallelujah and when your star has finished his course it takes no honor for the star just brought men to their destination showed them the perfect light the great perfect light see and then it takes no one to itself we take none on ourselves you see then we go our way oh my glory to god think of it the lord jesus we point them to jesus christ not to a myth not the one called santa claus right uh i read where he says he says at christmas they point them to santa claus he says it's nothing but satan misdirecting the people christmas time he point them to the myth of santa claus and then at easter he points them to the mid of some chicken or egg or rabbit away from jesus and onto a chicken or egg or a rabbit instead of pointing them to the lord oh my but we are not here to point people to mythologies we are pointing them to the unfailing reality of the living god we're pointing them back to christ back to the word back to a living god not a dead god buried in the pages of this bible but one who lives in us walks in us and every day we have supernatural operation taking place in our lives because we are having instant present tense revelation continuously as god lives within us and make himself known to us hallelujah amen praise god oh my oh fear not little flock from the cross to the troll from death into life he went for his own in power on earth all power above is given to him for the flock of his love listen and what does the christmas song star say to you now quoting brother branham speaking and what does the christmas star say to you now only believe let's all sing it only believe all things are possible only o hallelujah thank you lord o lee believe on [Music] all things are possible oh lee that's the message of the christmas star that's the message of the christmas star that's the message of every lesser light every lesser star every lore light they burn they shine their lights but their light is to only believe and lead men and women of christ to receive his light and life oh church of these last days or you called out an elected body of christ you have been promised by by the bible by the word of god that he'll give to you the bright and morning star only believe hallelujah what the bright and morning star what does it signify it heralds the coming of the full revelation it heralds the coming of the sun it heralds the brightness of the day he's called the day star the word will become so lit up that will be your christmas tree oh praise god that will be a true life praise god and christ will be the star on the top of the tree while the light is being made known oh church of the living god you christians you abrahamic seed all you children of god you stars of the morning you who come from the dust of sin and the rust and the bucket heaps of sin god has made you into shining stars to shine side by side as a wife will do with her husband with the bright and warning star hallelujah the bride is to shine along with him right by his side to shine a man o church shake yourself if you don't realize rise up get out of the dust and get the dust off of you and let's believe and know that god is here and he's alive forevermore praise god hallelujah only believe all things are possible to them that believe hallelujah praying a prayer he says heavenly father the day is growing dim now the signs of your appearing are now at hand we see the church just a handful of elected are being called out predestinated from before the found beginning of the world and their names were placed on the lamb's book of life before there was even a foundation of the world and the holy spirit has gone out and sought them out throughout the nations around the world until he's called them here together a little group but oh all the father has given me will come to me and all that comes to me i'll give him everlasting life and i'll raise them up in the last day so when we see this little group gathering itself together out of every denomination out of every church every village god is getting that little group ready and letting the morning star revelation shine upon them and we see them speaking of the coming and appearing of the lord jesus himself amen praise god hallelujah amen praise god aren't you happy friends i'm trying to wind this up now if that's all right with you hallelujah the bible says when they saw the starter rejoiced with great joy i don't know if they rejoice you ought to rejoice because you are seeing the star uh i won't go into that because i will take me another route there because he said the rest of them didn't see the star but the wise men saw the star hallelujah it passed right in front of them and all over them they didn't see it but the wise men saw the star unto you it's given to know they see the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but unto them it is not given glory to god hallelujah or praise god he is pulling them out of every church every denomination and out of every nation and every people pulling out a bride for his blessed name oh god fill their hearts with joy today make them happy lord they are set in hot buildings walking cold weather they walk through rain sleet snow and everything else but they are here because in them they know where the carcass is the eagles will be gathered together and my sheep know my voice and a stranger they will not follow praise god forevermore oh praise god have you seen he says his star here in the west i want to ask you that have you seen his star here in the west what kind of a star is it is it a church star oh no he said it's the holy spirit and he's moving in human beings we have seen a star and that has caused us to come and want to worship him amen what is it wise men wise women wise people humbling heart they have seen his star and they are here to worship him that is in god's wrap gift amen think of it god by his word his law has made molecules that's the law of god then god made atoms when god made the sun and out of the sun from the sun came the stars for them stars are little pieces of the sun did you get that oh my not the s-u-n only but the s-o-m oh praise god out of that sun come them stars little pieces of the sun come flying off oh my you see what did they what why why what did he have what happened there you see that's his attributes that are now displaying themselves oh praise god his attributes came out of him and now the attributes are on the earth and they're displaying themselves i was remarking to my wife coming down the street oh by the way that is from a message called thy house i was remarking to my wife coming down the street how the moon and the star and that star was right there hanging just above that cross oh my i guess i look at things that way maybe kind of complementary to my belief in god and in my ministry but that's the way i see it what he saw the star on the top of the cross and we see the star on the top of golgotha's hill we see the star hanging on the cross and they have the star on the top of the christmas tree but don't understand the full significance they may even say oh it represents jesus but they don't understand the full significance but we understand that that one pointed to him that he was going to hang on a tree and die for our sins and to make us his christians amen praise god your whole world has become a petrifying sword oh my there is no clean thing anywhere every holiday unclean because santa claus has taken over christmas and birth in the manger and the rabbit and the chicken and new hats on the ladies have taken the place of the resurrection where does god appear in all this see man has made it all commercial but we keep our eyes upon his star is there where we're going to keep our eyes on keep your eyes upon the stars let's all stand as we look to the lord jesus in prayer of course there's much more i could say and there are other brothers and preachers ministers that are opening up the word that can tell you more about the star i depend upon the lord to send the word wherever he wishes for it to go glory to god hallelujah i'm so glad the conjunction of the stars the bride and the bridegroom telling you that's what's happening in this day and in this hour amen that is the wife being born now it's the wife coming on the scene now is the wife about to give a last display before the rapture and they're going away to be with the lord hallelujah oh thank you lord heavenly father my soul rejoices lord i thank you lord god for your word that you have sent to us in simplicity may the simplicity and power of the word of god strike our souls lord and bring forth something from us not just a human excitement but to bring forth the light and life and power of the holy spirit that we might reflect jesus christ to the people to the world to the nation and you will receive all the glory and the honor and the praise and you will be exalted so here we are father
