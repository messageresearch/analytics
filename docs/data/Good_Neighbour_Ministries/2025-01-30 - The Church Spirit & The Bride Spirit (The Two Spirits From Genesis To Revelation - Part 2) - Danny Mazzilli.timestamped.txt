[18:26] amen praise God
[18:30] amen so let's um continue we're going to
[18:33] we're going to be on the seals for for a
[18:35] while um studying them so I trust that
[18:39] you've been taking the opportunity to go
[18:41] back and and read them study them listen
[18:45] to brother brandom in the uh Seven Seals
[18:48] there is so much in there that um it's
[18:53] just uh almost impossible you know
[18:56] brother brandham said I know he me
[18:58] mentioned it in the second seals he says
[19:01] when the anointing would come into the
[19:03] room there when he was studying if he
[19:05] had to write down and bring to us what
[19:10] was revealed to him he says it would
[19:12] take him three
[19:13] months on one of the
[19:16] seals on the amount of Revelation and
[19:19] the things you got to understand he was
[19:21] a prophet and when God would unveil the
[19:24] word to him he would see Visions he
[19:27] would actually see
[19:29] the events and the things that were
[19:30] happening and and to write everything
[19:33] that he would have uh seen while under
[19:36] that anointing he says would have taken
[19:37] a months to bring it to us so you can
[19:42] imagine how much Revelation there is in
[19:45] the word of God that we can only touch
[19:48] the highlights and you know even the
[19:50] things that we break into is just the
[19:52] grace of God what God reveals to us amen
[19:57] so um
[19:59] know that uh there's just so much more
[20:02] than what we could even possibly imagine
[20:04] in this study but let's read our
[20:07] scripture we we're going to continue
[20:09] where we kind of left off last week
[20:11] we're looking at the two Spirits from
[20:13] Genesis to Revelation because we know
[20:16] that um uh the spirit of God has been
[20:21] moving
[20:22] from before the foundations of the world
[20:25] everything was in his mind he saw the
[20:28] whole plan in his mind and we are
[20:32] actually by studying the scriptures
[20:34] we're seeing the things that have
[20:36] happened and then as we continue in the
[20:39] scriptures and we uh under the
[20:41] inspiration of the Holy Ghost we see
[20:43] what is happening and it brings us into
[20:46] our day and how the holy spirit is
[20:48] moving in the body of Christ at the same
[20:52] time Satan has been there he's that
[20:55] second spirit that wants to impersonate
[20:58] the Holy Spirit wants to be worshiped as
[21:01] the Holy Spirit and so um those two
[21:05] lines have been operating in the church
[21:07] and so tonight let's read our scripture
[21:09] from Matthew
[21:11] 24:5 it says for many shall come in my
[21:14] name saying I am Christ and shall
[21:18] deceive many the Lord add His blessings
[21:21] to the word of
[21:23] God and so as we um as we continue this
[21:27] study we're going to be looking at um
[21:29] the next slide here the church Spirit
[21:32] and the bride Spirit you may be
[21:35] seated um we know that uh even within
[21:39] the
[21:40] church there is a church spirit and
[21:43] there is the bride spirit and like we've
[21:46] been saying we are so much further down
[21:49] the road now to where we are in the word
[21:51] of God and how this how these seals have
[21:55] been opened back in
[21:57] 1963 and how now the seventh seal uh
[22:01] continues to unveil itself right into
[22:04] our day and we see that as we as we come
[22:08] into the Capstone and as we head into
[22:11] the full revelation of the Rapture and
[22:14] the and the church is gathered and
[22:16] called out and brought together we begin
[22:19] to see that these two spirits that are
[22:22] operating within the church are so close
[22:26] that they would deceive even the very
[22:29] elect if it was possible go to the next
[22:31] slide SE is not air with the Shu brother
[22:34] brandham speaking here he says notice
[22:37] see how close it looks Matthew said in
[22:40] St Matthew
[22:42] 24:24 he said that the two spirits in
[22:45] the last days and notice what he says
[22:47] here the church
[22:50] Spirit of the church
[22:53] people and the bride Spirit of the Bride
[22:57] people would be so close together till
[23:01] it would deceive the very elected if it
[23:04] was possible that's how close and so
[23:08] when we look at how close now we're
[23:11] actually looking within the boundaries
[23:14] of the message of the hour because
[23:16] remember the pale horse rider okay as as
[23:19] we go into all of these Riders and we
[23:22] look at the seals we're going to see
[23:24] that it was Satan that was riding
[23:27] through those
[23:29] ages and you know when we look at the
[23:32] the first seal we need to recognize that
[23:35] these writers they started
[23:38] out in the first church age that's where
[23:41] they actually started to ride and move
[23:44] into the churches and through the church
[23:47] ages and
[23:49] so these uh spirits of these false
[23:55] anointed christs okay because they come
[23:58] in the Name of Christ and they come for
[24:02] one purpose and that is to deceive the
[24:05] real true church to try and deceive to
[24:09] try and get them to you know leave the
[24:12] word and and by leaving the word I don't
[24:14] mean by just you know walking away from
[24:17] Christ I mean by just taking one
[24:21] deviation off the word will be enough
[24:25] that in the end they were they will
[24:27] think that they are actually worshiping
[24:29] Christ but actually find out that
[24:32] they're worshiping the
[24:34] Antichrist and so these seals it's so
[24:38] important for us to go through them and
[24:41] to recognize what's really truly
[24:44] happening and how it is that this
[24:47] deception will come so close that it
[24:50] would deceive the elect if it was
[24:52] possible and so we're going to continue
[24:54] now let's read um the scripture from
[24:57] Revelations 10:1 to
[24:59] 7 and I saw another Mighty Angel come
[25:02] down from heaven clothed with a cloud
[25:05] and a rainbow was upon his head and his
[25:08] face was as it were the Sun and his feet
[25:11] as pillars of fire and he had in his
[25:14] hand a little book open and he set his
[25:18] right foot upon the sea and his left
[25:20] foot on the earth and cried with a loud
[25:23] voice as when a lion Roth and when he
[25:27] had cried seven Thunders uttered their
[25:31] voices and when the seven Thunders had
[25:34] uttered their voices I was about to
[25:36] write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[25:38] saying unto me seal up those things
[25:42] which the seven Thunders uttered and
[25:45] write them
[25:46] not let's continue next slide and the
[25:49] angel which I saw stand upon the sea and
[25:53] upon the Earth lifted up his hand to
[25:55] heaven and swear by him that liveth for
[25:58] ever and ever who created heaven and the
[26:01] things that are there that therein are
[26:05] and the earth and the things that
[26:07] therein are and the Sea and the things
[26:11] which are therein that there should be
[26:14] time no longer but in the days of the
[26:18] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[26:22] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[26:26] be finished as he hath declared to his
[26:30] servants the prophets amen praise God
[26:35] saints that scripture of Revelations 10
[26:39] 1-7 should just make you so excited and
[26:44] happy to know what God has done for us
[26:48] in our
[26:49] day up until that time when brother
[26:51] brandham was on the earth and his
[26:54] ministry was unveiling itself it was all
[26:58] culminating to come to this very time
[27:01] where the seals would be open and the
[27:04] mysteries of God the mystery of God
[27:07] would be
[27:08] revealed and so as we look through this
[27:12] we're looking here and
[27:15] recognizing that the timing of it was
[27:19] very
[27:21] important nothing could
[27:24] happen to move us on to the next stage
[27:28] of the church ministry until those seals
[27:32] were
[27:33] unveiled it it said in Daniel 12: 8 to10
[27:39] that it said and I heard but I
[27:42] understood not then said I oh Lord what
[27:45] shall be the end of these things and
[27:48] when he said go thy Way Daniel for the
[27:52] words are closed up and sealed till the
[27:55] time of the end and so the end time is
[27:59] when the seals were to be
[28:01] revealed and it was and and we're going
[28:04] to come to realize why it was so
[28:07] important that it
[28:09] was the time of the end that it would be
[28:12] so important that it would have to wait
[28:13] until then for those seals to be open
[28:17] and so he goes on to say here many shall
[28:19] be purified and made white and tried but
[28:23] the wicked shall do wickedly and none of
[28:26] the wicked shall understand but the wise
[28:29] shall
[28:30] understand and
[28:32] so when we recognized that God had sent
[28:36] a prophet and I know a lot of the world
[28:38] and and and still up to this time the
[28:41] denominational Christians they haven't
[28:44] recognize the Fulfillment of scripture
[28:47] they haven't recognized the Fulfillment
[28:49] of Malachi 4 that behold he would send
[28:53] us Elijah the prophet but the thing is
[28:56] is that when you read that script
[28:58] scripture you see that behold I send
[29:00] unto
[29:02] you and we need to realize that that the
[29:05] opening of the word and the spirit of
[29:09] God the holy spirit in in your life is
[29:12] when when God gives you a revelation of
[29:16] what he's doing in your day and so those
[29:20] that recognize the coming of William
[29:23] Branham and the Fulfillment of his part
[29:27] his prophetic
[29:29] Ministry they will come to realize and
[29:32] recognize the importance of the opening
[29:35] of these
[29:36] seals only they will be excited only
[29:42] they will be enlightened only they will
[29:44] be uh uh feasting on the revelation of
[29:49] his word only they will recognize how
[29:53] important this season of the opening of
[29:57] the seals were and are to us
[30:01] now and so you'll notice that in the
[30:07] opening of the
[30:09] scripture in Revelations 10
[30:13] 1-7 he said that he was not permitted to
[30:17] write what he heard the Thunder saying
[30:21] and so when we look at the actual
[30:23] opening of the seals if you go back into
[30:27] the book of Revelation chap 4 5 and 6
[30:32] you'll notice that there
[30:36] was a king that was sitting on a throne
[30:40] and in his hand was a seven sealed book
[30:44] and this book was sealed to the one that
[30:46] was in the throne and when they began to
[30:52] utter and to speak what the seal was
[30:56] when they opened the first seal it was
[30:59] talking about someone that was going out
[31:04] to
[31:05] conquer that would have and when we're
[31:07] looking at the first seal and I'm just
[31:09] giving you an example here when those
[31:11] seals were
[31:13] open there was a mystery under each and
[31:16] every one of those
[31:17] seals but you'll you'll see and notice
[31:21] that the seven Thunders was not
[31:24] permitted to be written at that time
[31:28] because Redemption had not been complete
[31:31] yet because John was weeping and crying
[31:35] and saying who would be worthy to open
[31:37] those seals and to loose the the mystery
[31:41] that was under those seals The Plan of
[31:44] Redemption the book who would be worthy
[31:46] to open the book and Christ
[31:50] had not come yet to
[31:54] fulfill the
[31:56] actual plan of r Redemption by going to
[31:59] the cross and that's why it's so
[32:01] important for us to understand that
[32:05] until Christ actually went to the cross
[32:09] and Redemption was
[32:12] complete he could not come and take the
[32:15] book out of that right hand of him that
[32:18] sat on the throne and you get you also
[32:21] need to understand that the Book of
[32:23] Revelations and everything that John saw
[32:26] was in symbols
[32:28] everything was in
[32:30] symbols nothing was was actually written
[32:34] out he had to write out what he saw so
[32:37] he saw a white horse rider he saw him go
[32:39] out with a bow but then he had no arrows
[32:43] so it was all symbolic but there was a
[32:46] mystery behind it all and only when
[32:49] those Thunders and the seals were to be
[32:52] open would those Mysteries actually be
[32:56] revealed but in Revelation 10 you'll
[32:58] notice that the mighty Angel himself
[33:00] which was Christ was actually now coming
[33:04] down with the open book in his hand to
[33:09] reveal the
[33:12] mystery of Christ the mystery that was
[33:16] written under each and every one of
[33:18] these seals amen praise God so John was
[33:22] not allowed to write the interpretation
[33:25] of the Thunders because the lamb was to
[33:28] come down and take possession of the
[33:32] book okay until the
[33:35] actual sacrifice had been made the book
[33:39] could not be
[33:41] taken now we need to understand as we
[33:45] come and we look into this we need to
[33:49] understand that these writers they
[33:51] started way back right after
[33:55] Christ had risen from the
[33:58] dead that's when the deception started
[34:00] to enter into the
[34:03] church
[34:05] and when Christ actually
[34:09] came the second coming the first coming
[34:12] of Christ okay he came to make the
[34:16] sacrifice for all those that were in the
[34:20] Old
[34:21] Testament that were all making
[34:25] sacrifices with animal sacri sacrifice
[34:29] they were they were they were bringing a
[34:31] lamb they were bringing uh you know
[34:33] animal sacrifices for their sin because
[34:36] Christ had not come yet and so the only
[34:40] way that they could atone for their sins
[34:42] was through animal
[34:44] sacrifice but when Christ
[34:47] came in his first
[34:50] coming he paid the price for their
[34:56] sacrifice and all those that had died
[35:00] prior to his first
[35:03] coming the atonement was made for them
[35:06] at that
[35:08] point but the church ages and the
[35:11] Gentile
[35:13] church and for us and the Seven Church
[35:17] ages that led right up to us right after
[35:20] Christ died he went back to the throne
[35:25] to mediate for those that were were to
[35:28] come in the seven Church
[35:30] ages and it's important for us to
[35:34] understand that while he was on the
[35:38] throne he was
[35:40] making intercession for all those that
[35:44] came from the Ephesian Church all the
[35:48] way down to
[35:50] leoda and that's
[35:53] why when he left the
[35:56] throne he could could not leave the
[35:58] throne until the last one had come
[36:01] in under the seven Church age
[36:05] dispensation because there was bride
[36:08] members that were all under each one of
[36:11] those seven Church ages but the fullness
[36:14] of the word had not come
[36:18] yet until the fullness of the
[36:21] word it was
[36:23] all
[36:25] portions until it came to where
[36:29] the Catholic church had control of the
[36:32] of the word because remember those two
[36:35] Spirits they started to operate we know
[36:38] that that it started from before the
[36:39] foundation of the world and it's been
[36:40] running all the way through that's why
[36:42] we were looking at Jacob and Esau you
[36:45] know all the way through you'll see
[36:47] those two Spirits constantly fighting
[36:49] Cain and Abel Jacob and Esau all the way
[36:53] through all the way down but most
[36:56] importantly for us to
[37:00] recognize in the seven Church ages the
[37:03] Gentile
[37:04] dispensation okay that there were bride
[37:07] members in each of those
[37:10] dispensations and Christ was on the
[37:13] throne after the order of MDC the high
[37:17] priest making intercession for all the
[37:21] Sons and Daughters of God that were that
[37:24] were attributes through each of those
[37:27] dis
[37:28] dispensations but because they only had
[37:31] parts of the
[37:33] word and the fullness of the of the
[37:37] mystery hadn't come yet because that
[37:40] could only come under the seventh Church
[37:43] age messenger okay and so until we got
[37:47] to 1906 Pentecost and then when brother
[37:52] Branham when William Branham came on the
[37:54] scene he's the seventh Church age
[37:58] messenger okay and it's important for us
[38:01] to understand so so Christ is on the
[38:04] throne he's making intercession for all
[38:07] the Sons and Daughters of God right up
[38:11] to just before the opening of the
[38:16] seals
[38:18] because he left the
[38:21] throne and when he left the
[38:24] throne there was no more
[38:28] mediation no more
[38:30] intercession for the
[38:33] church ages and the last one in
[38:36] particular being the Pentecostal Church
[38:39] age you need to follow me here okay
[38:41] because this is
[38:43] important this is why the seventh seal
[38:46] and the opening of the seals is so
[38:48] important we need to see why God had to
[38:52] like he said in in uh The Book of Daniel
[38:55] seal it up until the time of the end
[38:58] because it would only be then that the
[39:01] mystery of God would be revealed and the
[39:04] and Eve could be completely
[39:08] restored so under those seven Church
[39:10] ages Christ is on the
[39:13] throne after the order of MDC the high
[39:16] priest that he's making because Luther
[39:18] all of a sudden gets a revelation on
[39:21] justification and breaks away from the
[39:23] Catholic church that was the beginning
[39:25] of the Reformation but Luther was still
[39:28] drinking smoking living you know he had
[39:32] a revelation on
[39:34] justification that the just shall live
[39:36] by Revelation by faith but he was still
[39:40] sinning they were still under under the
[39:42] sin dispensation and that's why Christ
[39:45] had to be there making an atonement for
[39:48] their ignorant sin in other words like
[39:52] if you go back into the Old Testament
[39:54] you'll see in the Book of Numbers where
[39:56] once year the high priest would have to
[40:00] go and make a sacrifice for all the
[40:04] people and they called it uh the the the
[40:07] the sacrifice for
[40:09] ignorance because even though the
[40:11] children of Israel would come and
[40:13] actually bring a sacrifice because they
[40:17] knew they sinned remember when they knew
[40:19] that they would sin then they knew that
[40:21] they'd have to bring a sacrifice but
[40:24] then there was sin that they were doing
[40:26] that they were ignorant enough they
[40:27] would be doing just like you and me
[40:30] we're not we're not aware sometimes and
[40:32] and and we're caught by by the Trap of
[40:34] sin because as long as in you're you're
[40:37] in this flesh over here you're
[40:40] susceptible to
[40:42] deception you're susceptible to human
[40:46] weakness and your mind is is your your
[40:49] your carnal mind is actually at Amity
[40:52] with God and it still will because of
[40:56] the nature that's in it and it's not
[41:00] what gets redeemed remember it's not
[41:02] this that gets
[41:03] redeemed this gets changed am it's the
[41:07] attribute it's the part of God that you
[41:09] are that's what God
[41:11] redeems but your nature and your flesh
[41:15] is weak and it still makes mistakes even
[41:20] in
[41:21] ignorance but the blood of Christ is is
[41:24] available to us now
[41:27] the atonement now to the bride is Christ
[41:32] himself the Holy Ghost himself that's
[41:36] the blood the blood is the Holy Ghost
[41:40] amen and
[41:43] so
[41:44] these Church AG attributes Sons and
[41:48] Daughters of God they would still be in
[41:51] sin and that's why Christ would have to
[41:54] be on the throne mediating
[41:58] interceding allowing the blood to
[42:00] cleanse them constantly cleanse them
[42:02] because every son and daughter of God
[42:05] remember every attribute of God is a
[42:09] part of
[42:11] God and their Redemption their coming
[42:15] back has to come the same way by the
[42:19] blood but they are gone now they died
[42:23] under their age and they no longer sin
[42:27] and brother Braham said that the last
[42:30] one when the last one would come in that
[42:33] was under those seven Church age
[42:36] dispensations when that last one come in
[42:40] then he would leave the
[42:42] throne because now it was time for him
[42:45] to take the book and go down to the
[42:48] Earth with an open
[42:51] book and unveil the
[42:54] mystery of Christ now now in the bride
[42:59] in the church in order to
[43:02] bring the church that is presently on
[43:05] the
[43:07] earth to redeem them to the
[43:12] Rapture the in other words the Rapture
[43:17] Revelation could not
[43:20] actually
[43:22] begin until Revelations 10 1-7
[43:27] was
[43:28] fulfilled you following
[43:31] me now you need to
[43:33] see he left the throne that's why on the
[43:37] opening of that seventh seal and we're
[43:39] going to be looking at all this as we
[43:41] move down but I'm just this is still the
[43:43] introduction because you need to have
[43:44] the foundational
[43:46] understanding there was a on the opening
[43:49] of that seventh seal there was a half
[43:51] hour of
[43:52] Silence why is there silence in heaven
[43:55] while he was there on the throne there
[43:59] was there was the 24 Elders the four
[44:02] beasts that were around the throne there
[44:04] was there was constant worship praising
[44:08] God and especially when he had taken
[44:11] when the lamb the bleeding bloody lamb
[44:14] because that was that was the he had
[44:16] come to the stage where now all the Old
[44:19] Testament Saints okay and all those that
[44:23] were in the book remember the B ible is
[44:28] the book and the book is the book of
[44:32] redemption and the Book of redemption
[44:35] was written from before the foundations
[44:37] of the world everything that we're
[44:39] reading here and every Old Testament
[44:42] scripture right up until Revelations the
[44:45] the last book in of Revelations was all
[44:48] written in the mind of
[44:51] God because he is the
[44:54] book he is the unveil in of the book and
[44:59] everything that we're seeing when we're
[45:01] reading from Genesis to Revelation we're
[45:05] seeing a play the actors all the all the
[45:09] actors and changing their masks showing
[45:13] themselves in all the different
[45:15] characters but it's all God it's all
[45:18] Christ it's him unveiling his word so
[45:22] everything that's why you know it was
[45:25] all played out from before the
[45:27] foundations of the world but then we in
[45:31] our day get to
[45:34] experience the portion of the word that
[45:37] is ordained for us
[45:40] now and that's why the evidence that you
[45:44] have the Holy Ghost is your ability to
[45:47] see what God is doing now through the
[45:51] scripture you should be able to see
[45:54] yourself in the scripture
[45:58] when you can see yourself in the
[46:00] scripture you're actually experience
[46:04] what's called perfect Faith a revelation
[46:08] that God is in you fulfilling his word
[46:12] through
[46:13] you then you see it through the church
[46:17] then you see every office every
[46:20] position and so now do you see the
[46:24] importance of the timing of of the
[46:27] opening of those seals and that it had
[46:29] to it had to be
[46:32] under in the days of the
[46:35] voice of the seventh
[46:38] angel well the seventh angel we know if
[46:42] you go back and do a study of the seven
[46:44] church and we're going to be looking at
[46:46] each one of them as we when we get to
[46:48] the first seal we're going to see how
[46:49] the first seal actually ties in with
[46:52] Paul the Ephesian age then the Sardis
[46:56] age
[46:57] and then all the other ages as they come
[46:59] down and we see how each horse rider
[47:03] ties in to each one of those
[47:05] ages and those Messengers and the
[47:08] anointing that was on each of them and
[47:12] how you know uh
[47:15] uh that first horse rider went out to
[47:18] conquer to conquer what to conquer the
[47:21] church but he didn't have a crown a
[47:25] crown was given to him
[47:27] so he would he would start out as a
[47:31] deceiver and it would keep moving along
[47:35] and his form of deception was moving
[47:38] through each Church age each Church
[47:41] age
[47:43] amen and so
[47:45] now when we come to this time
[47:50] here of the opening of Revelations 10
[47:54] 1-7 we come to realize
[47:57] that we've come to the
[47:59] end of the
[48:02] age where Christ is required to make
[48:06] intercession for the
[48:10] church Through the
[48:12] Ages when we completed the Pentecostal
[48:16] Church age under the seventh Church age
[48:19] under the seventh angel
[48:23] messenger William
[48:25] Branham there was no more blood on the
[48:31] throne
[48:33] required because all of those that were
[48:36] under those ages we've we're we're
[48:38] Beyond those ages now we're no longer
[48:42] even though we're we're we're in
[48:44] technically we're in the seventh Church
[48:46] age but in the midst of the seventh
[48:49] Church age remember the messenger to
[48:51] each age always comes at the end of the
[48:55] church age
[48:57] and so the messenger that came to the
[49:00] seventh Church age William
[49:03] Branham was to
[49:05] introduce the mighty Angel because it
[49:08] was it was the mighty angel that came
[49:10] down with the book open not brother
[49:13] brandham it was
[49:15] Christ amen it was
[49:20] Christ let's let's read
[49:24] here let's go to the next
[49:27] slide
[49:29] now he says here in the breach between
[49:32] the seven Church ages and the Seven
[49:33] Seals and this is really what we're
[49:35] covering here okay is the
[49:38] breach now oh the whole creation lays in
[49:42] his hand now on which the whole Plan of
[49:46] Redemption is sealed by seven mysterious
[49:49] seals in this book that he
[49:54] took now watch and he alone can reveal
[49:58] it to whomever he will he's got it in
[50:01] his hand see now he promised it would be
[50:05] at that time now for it for it is sealed
[50:11] by Seven Seals of mystery the book of
[50:15] redemption so the mighty angel that
[50:19] comes down is Christ he's got the book
[50:22] in his hand and the book is open amen
[50:26] praise God
[50:27] go to the next
[50:30] Slide the sealed
[50:32] scroll now if we go back to Revelations
[50:36] 5:1 that
[50:39] scroll and I saw in the right hand of
[50:42] him that sat on the throne a scroll
[50:44] written inside and on the back sealed
[50:47] with Seven
[50:49] Seals the one that was sitting in the
[50:51] throne was
[50:55] Christ he had the
[50:57] book he had it in his hands go to the
[51:00] next slide if you look at this scroll
[51:04] you see that each
[51:06] scroll was intertwined within itself so
[51:10] when they would open the first one it
[51:12] would reveal what was written on the
[51:15] back side of the actual
[51:18] scroll and then the second one it would
[51:21] reveal what was on the backs side and
[51:24] all of those Mysteries
[51:26] they all took place under the seven
[51:30] Church
[51:32] ages up to the seventh up to the Sixth
[51:35] Seal up to the end of The Sixth
[51:37] Seal all the Mysteries that were written
[51:40] under there took place played out like
[51:44] we said all the actors all the ones that
[51:46] were that were being called under each
[51:50] Age and and and the Mystery that was all
[51:52] under there it was all being played out
[51:55] through the deception and everything
[51:56] else but it wasn't
[51:59] revealed there was confusion so many
[52:02] people trying to figure out the Book of
[52:04] Revelation they couldn't figure it out
[52:06] why because it's not something that you
[52:09] can figure out it has to be
[52:12] revealed
[52:13] supernaturally and inspirationally from
[52:16] God himself to each individual that's
[52:19] why they could hit a lot of the teachers
[52:23] and the and the preachers all through
[52:25] and the and the and the ones that wrote
[52:27] all the commentaries on the scriptures
[52:29] brother brandham himself said that when
[52:32] he came to that first
[52:33] seal he would actually have made a huge
[52:37] mistake in coming out in saying that
[52:41] that white horse rider all the way up
[52:44] until that time it was understood that
[52:47] that was Christ because they see Christ
[52:50] coming at the end on a white horse but
[52:53] his name is the word of God
[52:57] and it was Christ that comes and that's
[53:00] when we come back with
[53:02] him after the three and a half year
[53:04] tribulation we're not going to get into
[53:06] all that right now
[53:09] but had the opening of The Seven Seals
[53:12] not taken place under the seventh Church
[53:15] age
[53:16] messenger the whole world would have
[53:19] been still under the
[53:23] deception even though
[53:25] 99 9% of the religious teachings out
[53:29] there are under
[53:32] deception because it only takes
[53:35] one One Drop of Poison in a glass of
[53:38] water and it'll kill you 99% pure
[53:44] filtered clean spring water but One Drop
[53:47] of Poison and you're
[53:49] done and that's
[53:51] why nobody can come to the fullness of
[53:55] the revelation of the word of God and
[53:58] the interpretation on the word unless
[54:02] the spirit of God the word of God the is
[54:06] in the
[54:08] individual that's why in this in this
[54:11] age that we're in right now this under
[54:13] the seventh seal mystery of the word
[54:17] that's unveiling to the church because
[54:20] Christ had to come himself
[54:23] amen that's why it could never be in
[54:26] personated because it's Christ himself
[54:30] in
[54:31] you in the true
[54:34] elected Sons and Daughters of
[54:37] God and so we're just looking at this
[54:40] scroll here and and there was only one
[54:43] that could be worthy to open it there
[54:46] was only one that could actually make
[54:49] the perfect
[54:51] sacrifice remember if a man sin a man
[54:54] had to die but but every man that was
[54:57] born into this world was born in
[55:01] sin and so there was no man that's why
[55:05] that's why John when he when he was you
[55:06] know in in in Revelations uh five when
[55:09] when he's talking about no one was found
[55:12] worthy in heaven on Earth below the
[55:16] Earth in other words anybody that had
[55:17] died that had lived that had come to the
[55:19] Earth there was absolutely nobody that
[55:21] was worthy because it had to be the
[55:25] blood of a
[55:27] perfect
[55:29] sacrifice and the only perfect
[55:32] sacrifice was Jesus Christ that's why
[55:35] the scripture says we're not we're not
[55:38] Redeemed by the blood of man we are
[55:40] Redeemed by the blood of
[55:43] God it was the it was the it was Christ
[55:47] himself that's why Mary there was no
[55:50] blood there was no egg there was nothing
[55:52] it was absolutely the word of God that
[55:57] was spoken in seed form into the womb of
[56:00] Mary she was only a carrier she was not
[56:04] the mother of God God cannot have a
[56:08] mother he has no beginning and no
[56:11] end she was strictly a carrier for the
[56:15] perfect sacrifice and that's why when he
[56:17] went to Calvary and made the
[56:21] sacrifice it was
[56:24] finished redemp could now be completed
[56:29] all those that were in the Old Testament
[56:31] that had died under the Bulls under the
[56:34] under the blood of bulls and goats the
[56:36] perfect sacrifice had come and every son
[56:39] and daughter every any every uh uh seed
[56:44] that was Christ seed that was the seed
[56:49] of
[56:51] Adam every one of those seed the Seed of
[56:54] Abraham those that were that were the
[56:56] the the the promised seed that were by
[56:59] the spirit of the promise of the word of
[57:01] God not the the the deceptive seed the
[57:05] one that took place through the serpent
[57:08] but the seed of God the whole lineage of
[57:10] Christ every one of those that died
[57:14] under the blood of bulls and goats were
[57:18] redeemed when Christ came and gave up
[57:21] The Ghost and and intercession was
[57:24] complete for them of the Old Testament
[57:28] they didn't need intercession anymore
[57:30] and that's why when he went to the
[57:33] throne he was making intercession for
[57:35] all those that were under the seven
[57:36] Church ages now he takes the scroll he
[57:40] steps out into Revelations 101 to7 with
[57:43] the open book and now he's ready to
[57:46] complete Redemption and to call every
[57:49] son and every daughter of God and so
[57:53] now as this plan begins to unveil
[57:58] itself we realize that there's two
[58:03] spirits that are going to always
[58:07] be in the
[58:10] church and unless the spirit of Christ
[58:13] is in
[58:15] you which is the
[58:17] word the Holy
[58:19] Ghost the word for your
[58:22] day you'll be deceived
[58:26] because you've got now the church
[58:28] Spirit and the bride
[58:31] Spirit the two Spirits are
[58:34] not message Christians and
[58:37] denominational Christians remember we're
[58:40] way down the road now you're not going
[58:42] to be deceived by Pentecostals out there
[58:46] because you've got Oneness you've got
[58:47] Tess you've got
[58:49] trinitarian you know that they're way
[58:51] off the
[58:52] word and there is no more
[58:57] redemption or
[58:59] intercession for the church
[59:02] ages so don't be looking to try to
[59:05] convert the
[59:08] churches it's only
[59:10] individuals it's only attributes Sons
[59:13] and Daughters of God that dispensation
[59:16] of the church ages is over Luther the
[59:19] Lutheran Churches they had the message
[59:21] for their day it moved on it went into
[59:25] Wesley they had the message for their
[59:27] day the spirit of God moved on into
[59:30] Pentecost from Pentecost it moved into
[59:32] the gifts of the Spirit and then from
[59:35] the gifts of the Spirit it went to the
[59:37] messenger of Malachi
[59:39] 4:5 the messenger of Revelations
[59:43] 10:7 and the ministry became that was
[59:46] the that was the ministry of that day
[59:48] and and there was many Believers that
[59:51] came out of those churches that followed
[59:53] William
[59:54] Branham right out up until the opening
[59:57] of the
[59:58] seals and any of those that that were
[1:00:01] under that church age dispensation of
[1:00:04] the Pentecostal Church age there was
[1:00:07] intercession available for them the
[1:00:09] blood was on the throne the lamb was on
[1:00:12] the throne making intercession for them
[1:00:15] right up until the opening of that of
[1:00:18] those Seven Seals a great event took
[1:00:22] place in in 1963 when those seals were
[1:00:25] opened
[1:00:27] it was brother brandham said it in in uh
[1:00:30] in the in the breach we'll probably come
[1:00:33] up to it here but he said it was the
[1:00:34] most Sublime time it was the most
[1:00:38] important time for the
[1:00:41] church but right after the opening of
[1:00:44] those seals many of those that were
[1:00:46] following William brandham started to
[1:00:49] leave William
[1:00:50] brandham because they couldn't
[1:00:54] take the continu ation of the word
[1:00:58] that's why those that were under Luther
[1:01:00] when Wesley came the ones that
[1:01:03] recognized they went on into Wesley's uh
[1:01:07] the church age under sanctification the
[1:01:11] ones that were under Wesley when
[1:01:13] Pentecost came along they recognized
[1:01:15] they went on into the Pentecostal
[1:01:18] dispensation the ones that recognized
[1:01:20] William Branham under the ministry where
[1:01:23] he was under the first and second pull
[1:01:25] where he was having great meetings you
[1:01:28] go back and look at them you'll see the
[1:01:30] meetings that he had there was thousands
[1:01:34] and thou hundreds of thousands of people
[1:01:36] worldwide that were healed it was one of
[1:01:38] the it was the most Supernatural
[1:01:41] Ministry since the days of Jesus
[1:01:46] Christ that's there was even more
[1:01:50] healings and more Supernatural under
[1:01:53] that Ministry because of the fact that
[1:01:55] he went world
[1:01:56] wide traveled the world seven times into
[1:02:00] meetings where there was thousands of
[1:02:02] people even one meeting where there was
[1:02:04] over I don't know a couple of hundred
[1:02:06] thousand people they filled stadiums
[1:02:09] they fil it was city blocks of people
[1:02:12] and then they'd have to bring in tractor
[1:02:14] trailers you can go back and and and
[1:02:16] find articles and see pictures newspaper
[1:02:19] articles showing tractor trailers
[1:02:23] bringing out tractor trailers full of
[1:02:25] stretchers and and and and crutches and
[1:02:29] all kinds of beds hospital beds because
[1:02:32] people had actually gone in come in on
[1:02:34] in ambulances on stretchers because they
[1:02:36] heard of this healing campaign under the
[1:02:39] ministry of William brandham that they
[1:02:41] would that they would bring busloads of
[1:02:44] people and they would walk
[1:02:45] out because of the supernatural but God
[1:02:48] was doing that for the people to get
[1:02:52] their attention to listen to the word
[1:02:55] that was coming out remember signs and
[1:02:58] wonders are wonderful but but the signs
[1:03:00] and wonders have a purpose to draw the
[1:03:03] attention of the people to the
[1:03:06] word that's why when Jesus was on the
[1:03:09] earth he drew crowds when he was doing
[1:03:11] the signs and wonders but the minute
[1:03:13] that he said to them unless you eat my
[1:03:14] body and drink my blood there's no life
[1:03:18] in you and you have no part of me they
[1:03:20] couldn't understand that he was talking
[1:03:22] about him being the word his body he was
[1:03:25] going to give up his body he was going
[1:03:28] to die for our sin and unless we would
[1:03:30] take that word and eat that word and not
[1:03:33] literally eating his body it's not
[1:03:36] talking about cannibalism he's not
[1:03:37] talking about drinking his blood his
[1:03:39] blood is the Holy
[1:03:41] Ghost and unless you can receive the
[1:03:43] Holy Ghost you have no part with
[1:03:47] him hallelujah praise God
[1:03:50] Amen and so
[1:03:56] it's wonderful you know we're just
[1:03:57] listen this is a study and so we we come
[1:04:01] and and and we and we just we're just
[1:04:04] hitting things and your faith I trust
[1:04:06] that you're praying you're believing
[1:04:07] when you come to these Services you're
[1:04:10] you're you're you're pulling on the word
[1:04:12] of God so that he can give you
[1:04:14] Revelation and understanding here I know
[1:04:16] these are a lot of things that you've
[1:04:17] heard before but let me tell you
[1:04:19] something there are things that you have
[1:04:21] not heard in your spirit
[1:04:24] yet and it's those things that are
[1:04:27] revealed to you supernaturally by
[1:04:29] Revelation that's what's changing your
[1:04:31] body that's what's that's what's uh line
[1:04:34] upon line uh changing you and placing
[1:04:38] you uh uh in in Heavenly places where
[1:04:41] your body is being changed uh you know
[1:04:44] for for the Rapture the quickening of
[1:04:46] the spirit for the Rapture amen praise
[1:04:49] God
[1:04:50] Allelujah amen
[1:04:52] so notice
[1:04:56] let me just go
[1:05:03] here let's go to the next
[1:05:06] slide and the whole thing together makes
[1:05:09] the
[1:05:10] book and it's sealed with Seven
[1:05:13] Seals and being it's on the backside is
[1:05:16] because it's wound up that's why when I
[1:05:18] showed you those seals the Mysteries
[1:05:21] that are that are written under the
[1:05:22] seals the seal the seal mystery is on
[1:05:25] the inside and it only says the white
[1:05:28] horse rider or the black horse rider and
[1:05:31] the whatmore on the outside but the
[1:05:34] mystery of the whole book is in them
[1:05:37] seals from Genesis to
[1:05:39] Revelations a complete Plan of
[1:05:42] Redemption is revealed in these Seven
[1:05:47] Seals think about that
[1:05:51] Saints unless 1963
[1:05:55] took place and the seventh angel
[1:05:58] messenger William
[1:06:00] Branham had not
[1:06:03] come to introduce the mighty
[1:06:07] Angel because remember the mighty Angel
[1:06:09] is
[1:06:11] Christ the voice of the seventh angel in
[1:06:16] the days of the voice that's why it's
[1:06:17] called voice of God
[1:06:20] Recordings because it wasn't William
[1:06:22] brandom it was the voice of God that
[1:06:25] came down and opened these Seven Seals
[1:06:30] so that the whole Plan of Redemption
[1:06:33] could be
[1:06:36] unveiled they've been talking about it
[1:06:38] from Genesis they were looking onto the
[1:06:41] coming of the Lord looking onto the
[1:06:42] coming of the Lord the the coming of the
[1:06:45] Messiah all through the Old Testament
[1:06:48] and then he
[1:06:50] comes but they're looking for Redemption
[1:06:52] they were looking even when Christ came
[1:06:54] are you not now going to restore the
[1:06:56] kingdom see they were all looking for
[1:06:58] the promised land they were all looking
[1:07:01] for that for
[1:07:02] that land that was told to Abraham that
[1:07:06] hey I'm giving you all the land you're
[1:07:09] going to go in there it's going to be
[1:07:11] all yours it's it's he's talking about
[1:07:14] back to
[1:07:16] our state that we were in before the
[1:07:19] foundations of the world when we were
[1:07:23] with God in that Eternal place
[1:07:27] that's what he was talking about and
[1:07:29] these seals opens up that whole Plan of
[1:07:33] Redemption now remember this
[1:07:37] okay I'm going to read here from
[1:07:41] uh the seven Church age book now
[1:07:45] remember this Christ in the true church
[1:07:49] is a continuation of the book of
[1:07:54] Acts but the Book of Revelation shows
[1:07:57] how that the Antichrist Spirit would
[1:08:00] come into the church and defile it
[1:08:03] making it lukewarm formal and Powerless
[1:08:07] so in other words The Book of Revelation
[1:08:10] exposes Satan revealing his Works
[1:08:14] attempted destruction of God's people
[1:08:17] and the discrediting of God's word right
[1:08:20] down to the time he has cast into the
[1:08:23] Lake of
[1:08:24] Fire Satan fights that he cannot stand
[1:08:28] it he knows that if the people get the
[1:08:30] true revelation of the true
[1:08:33] church and what she is what she stands
[1:08:37] for and that she can do the Greater
[1:08:40] Works she will be an invincible
[1:08:44] Army that's why Satan would constantly
[1:08:48] be be trying to deceive and why he
[1:08:51] deceived every Church age is because he
[1:08:54] didn't want the church Church to come to
[1:08:56] that place where she would recognize who
[1:08:59] she
[1:09:00] is he couldn't receive Revelation but
[1:09:03] she
[1:09:04] does and she will be an invincible Army
[1:09:07] if they get a true revelation of the two
[1:09:10] Spirits within the framework of the
[1:09:12] Christian
[1:09:14] church and God's spirit discern and
[1:09:18] withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan
[1:09:20] will be powerless before her that's why
[1:09:24] it's so important for us to
[1:09:26] understand the purpose of the opening of
[1:09:30] these seals because one of the uh one of
[1:09:34] the Mysteries that was under those seals
[1:09:37] was the mystery of iniquity The Mystery
[1:09:40] of the Antichrist spirit that was
[1:09:43] operating in the church amen working in
[1:09:47] the
[1:09:48] church glory to God and so she will be
[1:09:51] an invincible Army Satan will be
[1:09:54] powerless before her
[1:09:55] he will he will be as definitely
[1:09:59] thwarted today as when Christ with stod
[1:10:03] his every effort to gain power over him
[1:10:06] in the
[1:10:08] desert when the bride gets to a place
[1:10:11] where she real we're going to close now
[1:10:13] in the next five minutes when she gets
[1:10:14] to a place where she realizes that now
[1:10:19] he's come down to possess
[1:10:22] her that's why Jesus said on that day
[1:10:25] shall know that I am in the father I am
[1:10:28] the one that was in the
[1:10:29] throne the one that was in the throne is
[1:10:31] in
[1:10:32] me and I now in
[1:10:36] you because remember the book gets
[1:10:41] passed
[1:10:43] on to the
[1:10:45] church and this is what we are going to
[1:10:48] continue to look into as these seals
[1:10:51] unveil itself and the whole mystery of
[1:10:54] iniquity and the whole mystery of
[1:10:56] deception and the Mystery of the church
[1:11:00] the bride church that is within the
[1:11:03] worldly
[1:11:05] church and now even bringing it even
[1:11:08] home the bride
[1:11:11] age that's in the message
[1:11:15] age the mess age of this age that we're
[1:11:19] in right now that the deception now is
[1:11:23] within the confines of the message
[1:11:27] the holy spirit is going to show us
[1:11:29] clearly how it is that we cannot ever be
[1:11:34] deceived amen and so yes Satan hates
[1:11:38] Revelation but we love
[1:11:41] it with true Revelation in our lives the
[1:11:44] Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us
[1:11:47] but we will prevail over them amen
[1:11:51] praise God go to the next slide here in
[1:11:54] the breach between between the seven
[1:11:55] Church ages and the Seven Seals he says
[1:11:57] now when we go to Breaking these seals
[1:12:01] you're going to see it goes Plumb back
[1:12:04] to the scripture all the way back for
[1:12:07] each one of those seals the whole thing
[1:12:10] together the whole mystery lays right
[1:12:13] here in the seals see every mystery of
[1:12:17] the Bible every mystery of the
[1:12:20] Bible everything that you know you would
[1:12:23] read and you couldn't fully quite
[1:12:26] understand is going to be made
[1:12:29] clear and what we're going to come to
[1:12:32] realize is that the great mystery was
[1:12:34] always Christ
[1:12:37] himself changing his
[1:12:40] mask going from one character to the
[1:12:44] other knowing exactly his whole Plan of
[1:12:48] Redemption that in the end he would be
[1:12:50] the Victor he would have the victory
[1:12:54] over that other spirit that would try
[1:12:57] that tried so hard even before listen
[1:13:00] this this deception started before the
[1:13:03] foundations of the world when Satan drew
[1:13:06] a third part of the angels to himself to
[1:13:09] worship him and it was and that whole
[1:13:11] deception that whole plan it came and
[1:13:14] fell down onto the Earth and that's
[1:13:18] why when we go back to Genesis which is
[1:13:21] the seed of everything that started on
[1:13:25] on Earth we see it
[1:13:28] clearly the two Vines the two
[1:13:31] Spirits the spirit of the true church
[1:13:34] and the spirit of the
[1:13:35] Bride amen the spirit of the
[1:13:38] Antichrist and the spirit of
[1:13:41] Christ amen praise God and
[1:13:45] so the whole mystery lays right here in
[1:13:48] these seals see every mystery of the
[1:13:50] Bible lays in these seals and the seals
[1:13:53] cannot be broken
[1:13:56] until this
[1:13:58] time amen praise God God bless you let
[1:14:02] the musicians
[1:14:07] come and we'll read the last slide all
[1:14:11] these
[1:14:13] evildoers because we're going to go our
[1:14:15] next session is going to be on the first
[1:14:17] seal all these evil doers of the Seven
[1:14:20] Seals has been working mysterious in the
[1:14:24] church and pay attention he says and
[1:14:26] we'll find out in a minute that even
[1:14:29] work in the name of the church
[1:14:32] remember the greatest
[1:14:35] deception is when you can convince
[1:14:38] somebody to believe a
[1:14:40] lie thinking that it is the truth and
[1:14:44] the greatest deception is going to come
[1:14:47] down and operate within the
[1:14:51] church no wonder I've been so against
[1:14:55] denomination now he's talking about
[1:14:56] denomination back
[1:14:58] then because he saw through the seven
[1:15:00] Church ages all the deception through
[1:15:04] those seven Church ages how those
[1:15:05] writers were writing through there the
[1:15:07] the Deeds of the nicians and all of
[1:15:10] those you know deceptions every time
[1:15:13] that the church would receive truth
[1:15:16] Satan would come in sit himself into the
[1:15:19] church make himself look like a
[1:15:22] Believer but he was an unbeliever
[1:15:26] a make believer and would deceive the
[1:15:28] church age and that CH and that age
[1:15:32] would just that church would die but the
[1:15:35] spirit of God would keep moving on Amen
[1:15:38] no wonder I've been so against
[1:15:39] denomination not knowing why CC they end
[1:15:43] up now it starts back here in a mild
[1:15:47] form just keeps getting worse and worse
[1:15:51] on down until and the people go right
[1:15:54] into it saying oh yes this is just
[1:15:57] fine but in the last days these things
[1:16:00] are made
[1:16:02] known Amen in the days of the
[1:16:06] voice of the seventh
[1:16:08] angel the mystery of Christ would be
[1:16:12] revealed we're going to continue this
[1:16:15] it's um I'm excited about it because
[1:16:18] there's just so much in here that that
[1:16:20] the holy spirit is is going to unveil to
[1:16:23] us and all it's going to do it's going
[1:16:25] to make you realize more and more who
[1:16:27] you are because that's the only way you
[1:16:30] can defeat the enemy you want to
[1:16:32] overcome all the circumstances that
[1:16:35] you're dealing with out there every
[1:16:37] single day listen we all got problems we
[1:16:40] all got to deal with sickness we all got
[1:16:42] to deal but but but God has given us a
[1:16:44] revelation of who we are and the
[1:16:47] greatest Revelation in this hour is to
[1:16:49] know that not only who we are but who is
[1:16:52] in US fulfilling him his own word and so
[1:16:56] when Satan puts sickness on this vessel
[1:17:00] that God is housing if you've got a
[1:17:03] revelation that this vessel is being
[1:17:06] used of God then you can tell Satan to
[1:17:10] get off the
[1:17:12] vessel kick him
[1:17:15] out God's got a purpose for you here on
[1:17:18] this Earth for this time he didn't call
[1:17:20] you to be a defeated Christian he called
[1:17:23] you to manif EST the fullness of the
[1:17:26] word which is something that you cannot
[1:17:29] manifest in a Christian denominational
[1:17:32] church out there they're so far from the
[1:17:35] word of God they think they've got the
[1:17:38] word they have the form of godliness but
[1:17:40] they deny the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:43] when it comes into their lives and tells
[1:17:45] them to line up with the
[1:17:49] Scripture it shows the spirit that's
[1:17:51] actually on them when you tell them you
[1:17:53] need to repent and be back baptized in
[1:17:55] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:17:58] they turn around and say to you I was
[1:17:59] baptized as a baby I was baptized in the
[1:18:02] Baptist Church how are you baptized I
[1:18:04] don't know some of them will say I went
[1:18:07] to the water do you remember how you
[1:18:09] were baptized were you baptized in the
[1:18:11] name of the Lord Jesus Christ or were
[1:18:13] you baptized into the titles of Father
[1:18:15] oh I believe I was baptized into the
[1:18:17] titles I said well can you show me
[1:18:19] scripturally because the spirit of God
[1:18:21] said when the Holy Ghost comes Jesus
[1:18:24] says I will send you the comforter which
[1:18:27] is the Holy Ghost and it will guide you
[1:18:30] into all truth so if it's going to guide
[1:18:33] you to all truth it's going to guide you
[1:18:34] right back to the word and the word
[1:18:37] shows clearly every single baptism in
[1:18:40] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I know
[1:18:42] you've heard that a hundred times but
[1:18:43] there's somebody out there that hasn't
[1:18:44] heard
[1:18:47] it and one of the
[1:18:49] Mysteries is to know who you are in the
[1:18:53] scripture
[1:18:55] and where you identify in the scripture
[1:18:58] and if you're identifying with the
[1:19:00] unbelievers those that rejected the word
[1:19:04] that's why Jesus says they have ears but
[1:19:07] they don't hear me they have eyes but
[1:19:09] they can't see
[1:19:11] me but then he says but unto you he's
[1:19:13] talking to his disciples it's been given
[1:19:15] to know the
[1:19:17] mysteries of the Kingdom you see you
[1:19:20] talk about the Mysteries but those
[1:19:23] Mysteries are now known
[1:19:25] they've been made known after 1963 the
[1:19:28] seals were opened and the Mysteries have
[1:19:31] been unveiled and Christ is now in his
[1:19:34] church making himself known amen praise
[1:19:37] God let's pray father we just so
[1:19:41] appreciate Lord the Simplicity of your
[1:19:45] word
[1:19:47] Lord you've made it so
[1:19:50] simple we we just can't miss the
[1:19:54] simplicity
[1:19:55] of how clear your word is and and the
[1:19:58] scriptures but yet it's hidden to the
[1:20:01] eyes of the wise and The Prudent and
[1:20:03] it's made known unto babes in other
[1:20:06] words people that are not so smart and
[1:20:10] so wise but you hid it you said you you
[1:20:12] said in the scripture it's hidden from
[1:20:14] the wise and The Prudent and it's
[1:20:17] revealed unto simple people that are
[1:20:20] willing to take your
[1:20:22] word for what you say
[1:20:24] [Music]
[1:20:26] Lord I pray that you will
[1:20:28] move in the hearts of the people those
[1:20:32] that that are listening in that may hear
[1:20:34] these these things father may they go
[1:20:37] and search the scriptures Lord for in
[1:20:39] them they think they have eternal life
[1:20:42] and this is the hour where the great
[1:20:44] deception the greatest deception the
[1:20:46] Bible said that the whole world all in
[1:20:51] the Book of Revelation said all would be
[1:20:53] deceived and except those whose names

[1:21:07] name being called we're grateful father
[1:21:10] that we can and and to hear our name

[1:21:18] under subjection to it Lord and thank
[1:21:21] you so much father for what you're doing
