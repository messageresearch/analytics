[23:16] stress I see the the tests and the
[23:18] trials coming right it's just because
[23:21] you know these things come you know
[23:24] especially to the Elders of the church
[23:26] right that are ordained to min of the
[23:28] word to get us out of that channel right
[23:32] to you know any distraction any
[23:34] hindrance any trial test that Satan
[23:37] could throw at us is to get us out of
[23:39] that channel and that channel if you get
[23:42] out of that channel it stops the the
[23:45] flow of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives
[23:48] Amen in our gifts and that's what feeds
[23:51] us man don't feed you it's the Holy
[23:54] Spirit through the gifts through the

[24:49] going to go to Revelations
[24:51] 3:14 and then Isaiah
[24:54] 61 and like I said before all these
[24:56] scriptures have a meaning they have a
[24:59] purpose why a minister brings these
[25:01] scriptures and are led to bring these
[25:04] scriptures the truth has move forward
[25:07] into the
[25:08] Capstone Hallelujah Matthew 251 says
[25:14] then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be like
[25:16] unto 10 virgins which took their lamps
[25:20] and went forth to meet the
[25:23] bridegroom five of them were wise and
[25:26] five were foolish
[25:29] they that were foolish took their lamps
[25:33] and took no oil with
[25:36] them but the wise took oil in their
[25:40] vessels with their
[25:43] lamps while the bridegroom terth they
[25:46] all slumbered and slept all of
[25:50] them both the wise and the
[25:54] foolish and at midnight there was a cry
[25:58] behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out
[26:03] to meet
[26:05] him then all those virgins
[26:08] arose and trimmed their
[26:11] lamps and the foolish said unto the
[26:15] wise give us oil give us your oil for
[26:20] our lamps have gone
[26:22] out what
[26:24] happened they all arose they were all
[26:27] sleeping and SL number then the cry went
[26:30] out the word the Revelation the seals
[26:33] were
[26:37] open give us of your oil we know oil is
[26:41] a type of
[26:42] Revelation for our lamps have gone
[26:46] out but the wise answered said no not so
[26:51] lest there be not enough for us and you
[26:55] but go ye rather to to them that sell
[26:58] and buy for
[27:00] yourself and while they went to buy the
[27:03] bridegroom came and they that were ready
[27:06] went with him to the marriage and the
[27:09] door was
[27:12] shut afterwards came also the other
[27:15] virgin saying Lord Lord open to
[27:19] us but he answered and said verily I say
[27:22] unto you I know you not watch therefore
[27:26] ye know neither neither the day nor the
[27:29] hour wherein the son of man
[27:32] cometh wow what a

[27:37] scripture I can see this scripture where
[27:41] is this scripture going to be fulfilled
[27:43] is it out there in a
[27:45] denomination how can it be fulfilled out
[27:47] there in a
[27:49] denomination how can this setting and
[27:52] this
[27:54] scene of the the play this is a script
[27:57] to the play be fulfilled out there like
[28:01] we've been talking about all through
[28:03] this
[28:04] series Revelations
[28:08] 3:14 and unto the angel of the Church of
[28:11] the leoan write these things say the
[28:13] amen the faithful and true witness the
[28:16] beginning of the creation of God I Know
[28:19] Thy works that th Thou Art neither cold
[28:23] nor hot I would thou were cold or hot so
[28:28] then because Thou Art
[28:30] lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will
[28:33] spew thee out of my mouth because thou
[28:36] sayest I am rich and increase with goods
[28:39] and have need of
[28:42] nothing

[30:27] that had an ear let him
[30:30] hear what the spirit said unto the
[30:34] churches not what the man
[30:38] said but what the spirit said unto the
[30:42] churches Isaiah

[31:42] would say in that hour Lord I've
[31:44] prepared I've studied I have notes
[31:46] before me Lord but come great holy
[31:49] spirit let there be Faith sufficient for
[31:52] this hour Lord for this age in this
[31:56] place and them that are hearing abroad
[31:59] Lord bring us into that place Lord that
[32:02] we need to be tonight father not by
[32:05] might not by power but by your spirit
[32:08] sayeth the Lord when the spirit of Truth
[32:11] has come it will guide us and lead us
[32:15] into all truth Come Holy Spirit we
[32:18] invite your presence tonight bind every
[32:21] Power Of Satan I know he's a distractor
[32:24] I know he's a Hinderer I know he's a
[32:26] liar tonight father
[32:29] and as a
[32:30] deceiver Lord expose him in each and
[32:33] every one of our lives so that we may be
[32:35] set free and who the son of man sets
[32:38] free is free indeed free to receive and
[32:42] see the word for this hour so that we
[32:45] may go out and Manifest this truth Lord
[32:49] that you have given
[32:51] us Grant it Lord in Jesus name we ask
[32:54] amen you may be seated God bless you hey
[32:59] amen so we talked about I'm not going to
[33:02] recap everything but we talked
[33:05] about you know in jesus' day with the
[33:07] Pharisees and Sadducees and what they
[33:10] did with their Traditions made a word
[33:12] the word of God of none effect we talked
[33:15] about the Dark Ages how the word came
[33:18] down through the Dark Ages and how uh
[33:22] that nickel and spirit rised up and
[33:25] tried to take over the church and have
[33:27] the minion over the church we see that
[33:30] Luther Wesley right up to Pentecost amen
[33:35] started restoring back truth to
[33:37] us hallelujah but it didn't stop at
[33:41] Pentecost Hallelujah and we see that God
[33:44] sent us a 20th century prophet and we
[33:47] believe that he is a prophet of God
[33:49] William brandham amen but we also see
[33:54] that he was also in and he was sent to
[33:57] the pent costal
[33:59] age Hallelujah but we also see as the
[34:03] word progressed in his ministry we also
[34:06] see the Turning of a corner we seen the
[34:10] word come to a place amen that it had to
[34:14] come to a place where it
[34:17] changed and that is what we call the
[34:19] opening of The Seven Seals and we know
[34:23] that it wasn't of man because when we go
[34:25] back and we look at the first six seals
[34:28] we can see that God revealed to a man
[34:30] and God allowed a man to speak those six
[34:33] seals but in the seven seal there's
[34:36] nothing that man could have said there's
[34:38] nothing that the prophet could have said
[34:40] to us because that seven seal is Christ
[34:44] alone and him
[34:46] alone and he was showing there and
[34:49] proven there that is him he has come on
[34:52] the scene and he has taken contr control
[34:55] of his the church he is the head of the
[34:57] church amen he's the one that is going
[35:00] to reveal what this truth this Rapture
[35:03] in faith that we need this perfect faith
[35:06] that the bride needs to change a body in
[35:08] this hour no more No Greater Faith than
[35:12] in any other age than what is in this
[35:15] age to change our bodies as we are
[35:18] living to be
[35:21] transformed that is a
[35:23] faith that is greater than any other
[35:26] Faith amen
[35:29] and only he can do that that's why he
[35:31] said I'm not leaving it to a prophet I'm
[35:33] not leaving it to man but I'm coming
[35:37] myself and all we are as a five-fold
[35:40] Ministry are yielded vessels to speak
[35:43] his word but he has to ride on that word
[35:47] and reveal it to us because this
[35:49] Revelation this body change is only
[35:52] going to come by Revelation by it being
[35:55] revealed to you
[35:58] unless the spirit of truth
[36:01] comes it will guide you and lead you
[36:03] into all
[36:05] truth so we can see that in the message
[36:07] as a whole there's a part that's
[36:11] Pentecostal and we see that in that
[36:14] Pentecostal age before the seals yes the
[36:17] seals were
[36:18] breaking Revelation was coming out like
[36:21] the serpent seed we talked about things
[36:23] were starting to unfold but they weren't
[36:26] made clear even brother bradam when it
[36:28] came to the opening of the seals he said
[36:31] this Bible is a new Bible this message
[36:35] is new Hallelujah to me we can see and
[36:39] recognize by faith that something
[36:42] transformed in him something changed in
[36:45] his
[36:46] walk in his
[36:48] ministry and by recognizing that we can
[36:52] understand that there is something
[36:54] different in the message when we hear it
[36:56] preach than just a Pentecostal
[37:00] message remember a lot of these
[37:02] preachers have come out of Pentecost
[37:04] into this message or any other
[37:07] denomination Hallelujah and they take
[37:09] the quotes and they make the Pentecostal
[37:12] message more glorified more Rich more
[37:16] exciting to the people and people are
[37:19] swallowing
[37:21] that oh yes that's what's taking place
[37:25] but the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[37:27] starting to recognize because I can see
[37:30] it and I can and I and when I fellowship
[37:33] with the bride of Jesus Christ I can see
[37:36] that they're starting to understand and
[37:38] pick these things up remember this is
[37:41] not going to be a public show and that's
[37:44] not saying out
[37:47] there it's not out there it's here it's
[37:51] amongst the ranks of the message the
[37:53] message has grown to such a place that
[37:57] God is not going to make this truth his
[38:00] truth known as a public show
[38:03] anymore but as
[38:06] individuals now
[38:08] remember the Capstone age is what we're
[38:13] in has always been
[38:16] rejected just like back then brother
[38:18] Bram talked about the Capstone on the
[38:21] pyramid was
[38:24] rejected so this Capstone this Capstone
[38:28] age in our hour that we're living in is
[38:30] going to be
[38:32] rejected the word the revealing of the
[38:35] word to the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[38:37] going to be
[38:39] rejected but not to
[38:42] her she receives
[38:45] it she sees it and she receives
[38:50] it the whole
[38:52] age is rejected what this whole age this
[38:57] Pentecostal age this leoc and age no
[39:01] that's not what he's talking about
[39:03] here this Capstone this bride age this
[39:08] time and season that God is going to
[39:10] bring his word to the another level with
[39:14] her you see we have to go through the
[39:17] steps the message has to go through the
[39:20] process justification sanctification
[39:24] baptism with the Holy Ghost and then the
[39:26] Holy Ghost himself you cannot Escape
[39:29] even in your experience you can't escape
[39:32] that but if you got to True new birth
[39:35] inside of you that's what takes you
[39:38] through that
[39:39] experience that's what moves you through
[39:42] the steps that you're going through and
[39:46] and causes you to keep overcoming as you
[39:49] place yourself in that position of the
[39:52] holy spirit in your life
[39:58] the age is rejected and who is living in
[40:01] this age is rejected too good people but
[40:06] not recognizing the bride age gross
[40:09] Darkness upon the people of cour of this
[40:13] course this is a prophecy of the day
[40:17] that we are now living in you see the
[40:22] oil the
[40:23] Revelation has moved into the Capstone
[40:27] air
[40:28] age every age when the word is revealed
[40:32] that is the oil for the age and once
[40:36] that age is over it starts blending out
[40:40] and going into it Luther had oil had
[40:44] Revelation and it started blending out
[40:47] but when Wesley came on the scene that
[40:49] Luther age that people were living in
[40:52] the oil had run
[40:54] out and then you go right down to where
[40:58] and now here Pentecost had the
[41:01] oil but now it's run out my brothers and
[41:07] sisters you see where the foolish virgin
[41:10] is not in Pentecost the
[41:13] denomination but in the Pentecostal
[41:17] experience age experience right
[41:21] here
[41:24] hallelujah amen
[41:27] recognizing your day in this message
[41:30] brother
[41:31] brandham why do they do
[41:34] that you see I'm taking these right out
[41:38] of the message of the
[41:40] hour I'm not denying and I'm not
[41:43] rejecting any of the message of the hour
[41:45] in the
[41:46] quotes but seeing the
[41:50] Revelation that God is revealing to me
[41:52] in this
[41:54] hour and seeing it right in the message
[41:58] and
[42:00] recognizing Now you listen to what he's
[42:02] saying here remember people are always
[42:05] looking at what God
[42:08] did
[42:09] hallelujah what God's going to do but
[42:13] failing to recognize what he's doing
[42:16] right now and that was the foolish
[42:19] virgin failing to recognize right now
[42:28] they want a Great
[42:30] Awakening they're crying believing that
[42:33] there will be an
[42:35] Awakening they're good
[42:38] people why is it what is
[42:41] wrong think about it what is wrong
[42:44] brother Tim I'm in a messes church I
[42:47] listen to the brother brandham
[42:50] tapes what is
[42:54] wrong they have not recognized The
[42:57] Awakening of the
[42:59] Bride see by being a Christian not a
[43:04] denominational but a Christian he's
[43:09] saying they feel the pull of the
[43:13] hour but they haven't recognized what's
[43:16] been
[43:18] done that's what's making them feel that
[43:20] way they know something is supposed to
[43:24] happen but they see they're look looking
[43:27] for it way off in the
[43:30] future we know that something is
[43:33] supposed to we've been preaching about
[43:35] it it's being preached constantly that
[43:38] what is supposed to happen What like
[43:41] Jesus said don't go and look for it over
[43:44] here look for it over there it's
[43:46] happening right in your midst the
[43:48] kingdom of God Has
[43:50] Come amen and I believe the kingdom of
[43:53] God has come in this hour to us amen
[43:58] you're hearing by the spirit the kingdom
[44:01] preached every
[44:07] time when it's happening right by you
[44:11] very good people but they don't
[44:13] recognize the bride age they're not
[44:16] placed into that Capstone by the New
[44:19] Birth by the revealing of those seals in
[44:23] this
[44:24] hour now remember it's a proc process
[44:28] that we are going through amen I want to
[44:31] encourage you tonight too I'm going to
[44:33] tell you the truth but I I want to
[44:35] encourage you Amen to keep pressing on
[44:39] Hallelujah keep pressing forward some
[44:43] when a a baby is born it's not an adult
[44:46] overnight H Allelujah but I know when
[44:49] you're born again because I can look
[44:52] back at my experience 30 something years
[44:54] ago I know when you're born again again
[44:57] a new life has come inside of you and
[44:59] something happens to you Hallelujah
[45:01] something is different inside of you no
[45:04] matter what you here oh I've been tried
[45:07] tried to be deceived by the devil over
[45:08] the years many
[45:11] times especially listening to many
[45:14] different voices out there there's a
[45:19] danger Hallelujah especially to young
[45:22] babies there is a danger to listen to
[45:26] many voices is out
[45:28] there mature adults can filter amen but
[45:33] even they are wise to know not to listen
[45:37] to too many voices out
[45:39] there
[45:49] Hallelujah well if your eyes are not
[45:53] open you can only see the church ages
[45:56] from the past
[45:57] you don't understand that the key word
[46:01] of this age is your past
[46:05] word think about it my brothers and
[46:07] sisters what is the greatest word in
[46:10] this age this age this leoc and age when
[46:14] we talk about a word that everybody
[46:19] has
[46:20] password password password gets you into
[46:24] everything how many passwords do you
[46:26] have here tonight I know I got a bunch
[46:28] of passwords you can't get into your
[46:31] technology you can't get into your
[46:33] computer or what ever it is without a
[46:38] passw Hallelujah and leoan is built on a
[46:43] pass
[46:44] word
[46:46] hallelujah glory to God and what it
[46:49] takes in this
[46:51] age everybody is living off of a past
[46:56] word
[46:57] think about it my brothers and sisters
[46:59] think about it they got stuck people are
[47:03] stuck on a
[47:05] password people are believing in the
[47:07] password people are accepting the
[47:10] password and they're stuck what are they
[47:13] stuck on that God sent a prophet they're
[47:18] stuck on that they haven't moved past
[47:21] that yes God sent a prophet but why did
[47:25] he send a prophet to restore the word
[47:28] what did the word do what is it supposed
[47:31] to do bring a bride into maturity call
[47:35] out a bride perfect a bride clean a
[47:39] bride deliver a bride bring her to that
[47:44] place that she's walking with God
[47:48] alone but Satan using the same message
[47:53] same word using the process of growing
[47:57] and maturity in the word and how it
[47:59] changed to keep people in a past
[48:02] age believing in the
[48:07] password you got to change your
[48:10] password Hallelujah whoever you are you
[48:13] got to change your
[48:16] password to the Eternal Word of
[48:21] God let me say that the message of the
[48:24] hour is
[48:25] truth but the message is in two parts we
[48:29] know that if you know the message and
[48:31] you study the message and you can divide
[48:34] the truth is in two parts it's coming
[48:37] out and going in the Pentecostal part of
[48:42] the message calls you out every single
[48:46] one of you here tonight have been called
[48:50] out the message has called you
[48:54] out that's guaranteed if you're
[48:57] listening to this and you believe that
[48:59] God sent a prophet and you believe the
[49:01] message of the hour and you're going to
[49:03] a message Church you have been called
[49:09] out but there's a going
[49:13] in you have C been called out to come in
[49:18] to go
[49:20] in not to stay here just like in the
[49:24] just like in the Tabernacle we're not to
[49:26] stay in the outer court or the inner but
[49:30] to go behind the inner Veil that is the
[49:34] process that we have to take
[49:37] hallelujah amen but in that process
[49:40] Satan is always there the liar the
[49:43] deceiver taking like he did with Eve the
[49:46] same word and that's what you got to
[49:48] recognize my brothers and sisters that's
[49:51] what I have come to recognize to see to
[49:54] take he takes the same word word and
[49:57] tries to keep me in a past age keep my
[50:00] condition my experience in a past age
[50:04] and not let it move
[50:07] forward
[50:09] amen
[50:10] [Music]
[50:12] hallelujah if you believe the message of
[50:14] the hour and you are following it in a
[50:16] message church that only means you have
[50:18] come out it doesn't mean you have gone
[50:20] in yet the leoan age is part of the
[50:25] Pentecostal age which is the coming out
[50:28] but the opening of The Seven Seals being
[50:31] revealed to the individual bride is the
[50:34] going in into the Capstone age or the
[50:37] Rapture
[50:38] age producing perfect
[50:41] Faith
[50:44] hallelujah
[50:47] amen we should never think that we have
[50:51] arrived
[50:53] never because that was what Satan will I
[50:56] got the the message I got the tapes I
[50:57] got this I got all Revelation no That's
[51:00] what Satan will use to deceive you from
[51:03] going
[51:06] forward this is an age that we're living
[51:09] in in the in this message we've come out
[51:12] but we're still living on a password
[51:14] this is the age where everything is
[51:17] connected together technology theology
[51:20] man's opinions and understanding and
[51:23] everything has a password connected to
[51:25] it you see this this oil in this age has
[51:30] run
[51:31] out it's
[51:35] finished gone and now the foolish virgin
[51:38] are manifesting in this message and
[51:42] living off of a past word the Bible said
[51:45] there will be two in the field and two
[51:48] in the bed and I'll take one and I'll
[51:51] leave
[51:52] one
[51:54] physically we are all in in the same
[51:57] place
[52:01] leoan but spiritually the bride is in a
[52:05] different place she's not in
[52:08] leoan
[52:11] Hallelujah she's in a different
[52:14] dimension
[52:16] altogether go back to the scriptures
[52:18] that we read in the opening and go back
[52:22] to the message I know it's Wednesday
[52:23] night Hallelujah and our flesh some of
[52:26] us will fight us more than others go
[52:29] back and listen to it
[52:31] again now listen Satan's
[52:34] Eden I'm still trying to lay something
[52:37] down here Satan's Eden the God of this
[52:41] world today the worshipper person of
[52:45] this world today is
[52:49] Satan the person who is worshiped and
[52:52] the people are ignorant of worshiping
[52:55] Satan but is Satan impersonating himself
[52:58] as the
[53:00] church think about it
[53:02] Saints I know when we read these quotes
[53:05] I mean I used to I always looked because
[53:08] it wasn't revealed to me that it's here
[53:11] now it's here
[53:13] manifesting I know it's very difficult
[53:16] for some of you very difficult but when
[53:18] God when you start seeking God will
[53:21] start opening in your eyes and even some
[53:23] of you are starting to see things
[53:26] starting to recognize things things that
[53:28] you don't you didn't understand why
[53:30] you're Discerning certain
[53:33] things because God wants to reveal truth
[53:36] to you and show you my brothers and
[53:38] sisters this messes culture this messes
[53:42] Traditions that we have going around and
[53:44] moving around
[53:46] Hallelujah is not what it perceives to
[53:49] be they worship Satan thinking that they
[53:52] are worshiping God through the church
[53:55] but it's the way Satan has done it all
[53:58] you say but wait a
[54:00] minute we preach the
[54:04] word the message of the hour we preach
[54:07] it look back here at my text tonight now
[54:11] I'm I'm not I'm not talking I'm brother
[54:13] Brand's talking
[54:14] here Satan was the one that preached the
[54:18] word to Eve first in the
[54:25] beginning as God said
[54:28] see it's to
[54:30] interpret
[54:31] something such as a statement or action
[54:35] wrongly and
[54:37] misinterpret that part of the scripture
[54:39] that applies to the day that you're
[54:42] living
[54:43] in he will let you know all about Jesus
[54:47] and what he did was perfectly well you
[54:51] listening stay with me he will let you
[54:54] know all that Moses did was perfectly
[54:58] well he even lets you know everything
[55:01] that brother Bram did was
[55:04] well but to let you know about the bride
[55:08] age about your part in the word think
[55:11] about
[55:12] it and how to bring your part into
[55:16] manifestation oh no he won't let you
[55:18] know that he ain't going to let you go
[55:21] that
[55:21] far because he doesn't want amen Jesus
[55:25] is coming he know what he had to deal
[55:28] with with brother
[55:29] brandham the the manifestation of the
[55:31] wave sheet that came to maturity he know
[55:35] what he had to deal with with him he
[55:37] don't want that being spread like it was
[55:40] on the day of Pentecost little Jesus is
[55:43] all over the place and that's what the
[55:45] message is supposed to do just like it
[55:48] did back there amen with the apostles
[55:52] the pillar of fire spread out and went
[55:55] into them
[55:56] and there was Jesus all over the place
[56:00] my brothers and sisters that's the
[56:02] deception of this hour that's the
[56:04] deception of Satan trying to take the
[56:07] word and stop this manifestation from
[56:10] coming to pass in the
[56:12] bride that's why he's got to be exposed
[56:15] to the highest
[56:18] level am I the only one or no I'm
[56:21] not but I'm I got to be true to what I'm
[56:25] seeing
[56:27] this is what's burning on my heart just
[56:30] like when the prophet came he had to
[56:32] speak the truth what he was seeing
[56:34] amongst the denominations ministers
[56:36] called anointed in this hour God to
[56:39] speak the same truth and we've heard it
[56:42] for many years the two seeds the two
[56:45] spirits in the churches through our
[56:47] former Pastor being exposing these
[56:51] things hallelujah it's still here the
[56:55] bride still needs this word to sharpen
[56:58] her sword sharpen her discernment in
[57:01] this
[57:03] hour oh yeah he'll let you know about
[57:07] everything about every other age but he
[57:10] won't let you know your part in the word
[57:13] how many people are worshiping brother
[57:14] Brenham I've seen videos is right on if
[57:17] you know go on Instagram or whatever Tik
[57:20] Tok or whatever I've seen pictures of
[57:22] brother Brenham and people are
[57:24] worshiping them bowing down before them
[57:28] building up an idol like Daniel is
[57:31] happening right now my brothers and
[57:36] sisters
[57:37] Satan
[57:39] always trying to distract the people
[57:42] from finding their part how can they
[57:44] find their part in the
[57:46] word how can they recognize who they are
[57:50] you see that's the greatest thing that
[57:51] brother Bram said in this hour when she
[57:53] recognizes who she is she'll be
[57:56] Invincible Satan hates
[57:58] that he didn't say he hates you
[58:01] worshiping brother Bram or picture or
[58:04] being religious or wearing long dress
[58:07] and having long hair but he hates when
[58:10] people recognize who they are in this
[58:13] hour and that's what's raising up that's
[58:16] what the Holy Ghost is building within
[58:18] us Building a Church a super Church an
[58:23] invincible Army to take this word
[58:27] Hallelujah so that when we speak the
[58:30] word oh brother I pray nothing happens
[58:33] this you got to be built up you got to
[58:36] be strengthened and built up in the word

[58:42] the people that say that God don't hear
[58:43] my prayers or nothing happens when I
[58:45] pray is the people that don't recognize
[58:48] who they are in this hour that's why
[58:51] it's very important that God get you to
[58:54] a place you don't need to experience all
[58:57] the the Miracles and all the feelings
[58:59] and uh speak in tongues and all these
[59:02] things that even in this message calls
[59:04] the Holy Ghost still think about it
[59:07] preaching it as the Holy Ghost
[59:10] still the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[59:12] all these things bringing the people and
[59:14] leading them into
[59:16] deception but no it's recognizing who
[59:20] you are is the most important thing
[59:23] that's what operates the sword of faith
[59:26] amen the word of God in this
[59:28] hour
[59:31] Hallelujah he knows brother brand
[59:33] speaking

[59:42] talking she can do the Greater Works
[59:45] invisible
[59:46] army they get a true revelation of two
[59:48] Spirits within the framework of the
[59:50] church and by God's
[59:52] spirit by God's
[59:55] spirit not no other
[59:59] Spirit not ministers catching the
[1:00:02] pastor's spirit and manifesting it but
[1:00:06] by God's
[1:00:08] spirit and withstand the Antichrist
[1:00:11] Spirit Satan will be powerless before
[1:00:14] her Hallelujah yes Satan hates
[1:00:17] Revelation but we love it because it
[1:00:20] says who we are it reveals who we are
[1:00:24] with a true Revelation in our Liv lives
[1:00:26] the Gates of
[1:00:28] Hell shall not Prevail you see where it
[1:00:31] is Saints you see what we should be
[1:00:34] seeking for in this hour but Satan is
[1:00:37] trying to take this Pentecostal message
[1:00:41] in this message and make you go and run
[1:00:43] after
[1:00:45] it he that has an ear let him hear those
[1:00:49] who have eyes to
[1:00:52] seea it's not what it
[1:00:54] is the bride is having a
[1:00:58] Revival right
[1:01:00] now and you're saying oh brother we're
[1:01:03] the church is not packed out and we're
[1:01:04] not he having healing lines and having
[1:01:06] all different kind of Miracles the word
[1:01:10] Revival is what's Tak place right now
[1:01:13] the word is unfolding in the bride it's
[1:01:16] revealing to the bride it's bringing her
[1:01:19] to a
[1:01:20] place
[1:01:24] Hallelujah glory to
[1:01:26] God Satan's Eden
[1:01:29] 1965 but now the cunningness of the
[1:01:32] devil now makes the people believe that
[1:01:35] they are Christians when they're not
[1:01:37] Revelations 3:14 the leosan church age
[1:01:40] that how the church would be in these
[1:01:42] last days and it said it would be
[1:01:45] sitting as a widow and have need of
[1:01:47] nothing it was rich increased with Goods
[1:01:49] poor miserable blind naked didn't even
[1:01:51] know it think about it didn't even know
[1:01:54] it
[1:01:56] now remember he's speaking to the Church
[1:01:58] of this
[1:02:00] age now can you discern between the
[1:02:03] lines he's speaking to the message of
[1:02:07] this
[1:02:09] age message is different than the word
[1:02:12] well brother the message can't be
[1:02:14] different is a
[1:02:15] word it all depends which way you
[1:02:17] interpret it
[1:02:21] Hallelujah it is different than this
[1:02:23] opening of the seals
[1:02:26] wretched naked blind don't know it the
[1:02:29] last phrase that last word is makes it
[1:02:32] so striking they think they are filled
[1:02:35] with the
[1:02:36] spirit they think they are filled with
[1:02:39] the
[1:02:42] spirit they're all ready for the Rapture
[1:02:45] the leoan church age is the Pentecostal
[1:02:48] Church age because it's the last Church
[1:02:51] age Luther had his message Wesley had
[1:02:53] his message and Pentecostal had had
[1:02:56] their message it also said that because
[1:02:59] you are lukewarm neither hot or cold the
[1:03:02] emotions of the outside the mental
[1:03:06] conception of the
[1:03:08] gospel because he said you are that
[1:03:13] way because you believe it that way
[1:03:17] because that is your
[1:03:21] experience in the message
[1:03:26] I will spw you out of my mouth in other
[1:03:29] words it made him sick to see the church
[1:03:32] in that
[1:03:34] condition think about
[1:03:37] it trying to do God a
[1:03:40] service without being his
[1:03:43] will now watch close it gets to that
[1:03:45] Razor Edge now between right and wrong
[1:03:50] now remember it falls on one or the
[1:03:53] other side it comes write down to make
[1:03:56] it more accurate Intense or
[1:04:00] effect sometimes like a Raaz a razor
[1:04:03] between the difference is between right
[1:04:06] and wrong you see it's coming right down
[1:04:10] to the razor's
[1:04:12] Edge that's where it's coming down to
[1:04:16] and that's where it'll come down to In
[1:04:18] your experience right down to the
[1:04:20] razor's Edge so
[1:04:23] close doesn't it say that it will
[1:04:25] deceive the very elect if it were
[1:04:27] possible it'll be so
[1:04:30] close stay with me
[1:04:34] hallelujah it's not to be it's got to be
[1:04:38] every word of God not just almost every
[1:04:40] word what does it mean by
[1:04:43] that it's got to be every word brother
[1:04:46] brother I believe every word I believe
[1:04:49] everything brother brandom said I
[1:04:50] believe everything the Bible
[1:04:52] says but that's not what he's saying
[1:04:55] when he's said if you take one word away
[1:04:59] or if you add one word he's talking
[1:05:02] about the age that you're living
[1:05:04] in you can't take a word out of the age
[1:05:09] that God has ordained for us to be
[1:05:13] in amen you can't go in Wesley's age and
[1:05:18] believe only Luther and bring it over to
[1:05:21] Wesley you're taking a word away
[1:05:31] hallelujah it's got to it's got down
[1:05:34] today not Luthers or methodists or not
[1:05:37] Pentecostal but that razor intense age
[1:05:41] this age is a razor intense age where
[1:05:46] the Antichrist anointing is so perfectly
[1:05:50] it would deceive the very
[1:05:53] elect perfectly that that
[1:05:57] anointing he said that anointing is so
[1:06:01] perfectly it'll deceive the very elect
[1:06:03] if it was
[1:06:05] possible they
[1:06:07] fall on the wrong side if they don't
[1:06:10] watch it like a wedge watch brother
[1:06:14] Brandon speaking here watch be careful
[1:06:18] we're not living in the Pentecostal ages
[1:06:20] now we pass that age just the same as we
[1:06:24] pass looser and Wesley we have gone past
[1:06:28] that
[1:06:30] age trying to do God a service without
[1:06:32] being his
[1:06:35] will the church ages begins with a
[1:06:38] message that is the oil in the lamps as
[1:06:42] the church ends the oil runs out in the
[1:06:45] last age the Pentecostal age the oil has
[1:06:48] run out and the people are trying to
[1:06:50] feed off of that age when that age has
[1:06:52] changed into another age called the
[1:06:55] bride age where the oil is today is that
[1:06:59] the people's fault it's The Minister's
[1:07:02] fault because ministers are the ones
[1:07:04] that are preaching and and when the when
[1:07:06] the when a a preacher is preaching the
[1:07:08] word of God and if he's preaching a
[1:07:10] Pentecostal message in this age that's
[1:07:13] what the people are
[1:07:15] believing and standing
[1:07:17] on I believe we've been hearing for many
[1:07:21] years now Hallelujah the caps Stone Age
[1:07:27] The Bride age Hallelujah that's what's
[1:07:30] brought me I know brought me to this
[1:07:32] place where I am in my walk because I
[1:07:35] have not been feeding off of a a Luther
[1:07:38] Wesley or Pentecostal age I've been
[1:07:40] feeding off of the Eternal Church Age
[1:07:43] The Bride age the word of God being
[1:07:46] revealed to bring a bride into
[1:07:49] perfection in this
[1:07:51] hour that's what's brought me to this
[1:07:53] place in my experience
[1:08:01] Hallelujah and both the foolish virgin
[1:08:03] and wise virgin are feeding off of the
[1:08:06] message but one is receiving Revelation
[1:08:09] oil to keep her lamps lit up and the
[1:08:12] others feeding off of a past AG Faith
[1:08:16] the seals are open to one and not to the
[1:08:19] other and both in the same message
[1:08:22] church both called Believers but one say
[1:08:25] this Revelation is wrong and fighting
[1:08:29] against it by using a Pentecostal quotes
[1:08:32] in the message not recognizing the
[1:08:35] opening of the seals the word spoken
[1:08:38] about the Capstone age the bright age
[1:08:42] yes many times brother Simon has stepped
[1:08:45] out by faith amen God revealing the word
[1:08:51] for the hour to him and bringing it just
[1:08:54] like have you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:08:57] since you believe this message people
[1:08:59] fought against him people called him
[1:09:02] false and then he start preaching that
[1:09:05] there's another age beyond the seven
[1:09:07] Church Ages which is the Eternal Church
[1:09:10] age who fights against who takes the
[1:09:14] quotes and fights against the truth is
[1:09:17] people right here right in the message
[1:09:20] not
[1:09:21] recognizing and then some will come out
[1:09:24] those who are elected and called will
[1:09:26] come out and recognize the truth
[1:09:30] hallelujah but the other ones will stay
[1:09:33] because that's all that they see that's
[1:09:35] all that they can recognize and receive
[1:09:38] because they don't got the seed of the
[1:09:40] age inside of them to produce the fruit
[1:09:43] of the age that they're living
[1:09:49] in h Allelujah that's when they're going
[1:09:52] to ask where did you get the oil

[1:20:05] position it's not no man's position this
[1:20:08] can't be touched with man's hands
[1:20:11] Hallelujah it was the pillar of fire
[1:20:14] that had to come and lead them right
[1:20:17] down into the holies of holies and the
[1:20:20] glory of God was in there till they
[1:20:22] couldn't see how to minister they

[1:20:53] used in the star s The
[1:20:56] Messengers no he's not using them that's
[1:20:59] not what's going to illuminate his
[1:21:01] personal presence which people think no
[1:21:05] to give light in the darkness any longer
[1:21:08] that's not what's happening anymore my
[1:21:10] brothers it will be Jesus himself
[1:21:13] speaking face to face as he shares his
[1:21:17] kingdom with us as he Reveals His
[1:21:20] Kingdom in
[1:21:21] us hallelujah
[1:21:24] Jesus has given us this description of
[1:21:29] himself in relations to the last age now
[1:21:33] listen the days of grace are winding
[1:21:36] up he has looked from the first century
[1:21:40] right through to the 20th century he
[1:21:43] told all things that concern these ages
[1:21:46] before he reveals the characteristics of
[1:21:49] the last age to us he gives us one final
[1:21:52] look at his own Grace
[1:21:55] gracious and supreme
[1:21:57] deity this is the Capstone revelation of
[1:22:03] himself thus sayeth the
[1:22:06] amen hallelujah let me try to wind it
[1:22:09] down
[1:22:09] here I'll skip over some things and
[1:22:12] bring it to the next
[1:22:16] Hallelujah Jesus himself when he came he
[1:22:19] knew he was the
[1:22:21] word he was that he was positive that
[1:22:25] for he was and when he was just 12 years
[1:22:30] old a little boy we find him in the
[1:22:32] temple debating with the priests his
[1:22:35] knowledge of who he was could surpass
[1:22:38] their traditions and he was teaching
[1:22:42] them men and when his own mother came to
[1:22:46] him dun said a word that was
[1:22:50] wrong catch watch the word correct the
[1:22:54] error
[1:22:55] the word always corrects the error and
[1:22:57] if the people could only see today that
[1:23:00] the word for the age corrects the
[1:23:04] error the whole thing is become an
[1:23:07] error but God's word is what is
[1:23:11] right he said the heavens and earth will
[1:23:14] pass away but my word will not pass away
[1:23:17] and the word that is prophesied for this
[1:23:20] day is
[1:23:21] correct the error
[1:23:25] of the day it corrects the error of the
[1:23:27] day you understand that the word itself
[1:23:30] corrects the
[1:23:31] error the people today say oh let us
[1:23:34] join a church let us join the message of
[1:23:37] the hour let us go to the council let us
[1:23:40] do all these things that's an
[1:23:43] error and the word comes back and
[1:23:47] corrects that error by identifying
[1:23:50] himself the hour and the time of the
[1:23:54] hour
[1:23:56] now we know these things to be true
[1:24:00] Hallelujah let's fite the musicians
[1:24:04] up
[1:24:05] amen the but the new
[1:24:08] birth is Christ is a revelation you have
[1:24:12] been born again or receiv received the
[1:24:15] Holy Ghost since you have been born
[1:24:17] again have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:24:19] since you have believed sorry this

[1:24:27] mystery if he has that's the new
[1:24:31] birth what are you going to do when you
[1:24:35] get all those groups together where the
[1:24:38] Revelation is perfectly in
[1:24:40] Harmony and God expressing through it
[1:24:43] his word by the same actions and the
[1:24:47] same things he
[1:24:48] did making his word manifest in this day
[1:24:52] oh if the church only knew its position
[1:24:55] position it will one
[1:24:58] day you see if it only knew its
[1:25:02] position then the Rapture will go when
[1:25:05] it knows it Christ is the mystery of God
[1:25:08] revealed
[1:25:11] hallelujah amen last statement
[1:25:15] here the gross darkness is here upon the
[1:25:19] earth and the people of this age is full
[1:25:23] of Darkness but the light has come to
[1:25:26] the bride to take her out of this
[1:25:30] age that is heading in One
[1:25:34] Direction but the Lord has put us in
[1:25:37] another
[1:25:38] Direction in another
[1:25:41] age where there is no darkness and only
[1:25:45] light is the shikina glory where the
[1:25:49] bride is coming into perfect Faith she's
[1:25:52] in there recognizing that God has
[1:25:55] forgiven her of all her
[1:25:57] sins because he wants her
[1:26:02] consecration in that inner veil in that
[1:26:05] most holy
[1:26:07] place let us the bride of Christ get
[1:26:10] that to that place with him let's lay
[1:26:14] aside everything that gets in the way
[1:26:17] and overcome and
[1:26:19] press with this perseverance and
[1:26:21] Desperation in this hour never give
[1:26:26] up if you have recognized that you have
[1:26:30] been called to be separated from this
[1:26:32] religious spirit of this age of this
[1:26:36] world or in this
[1:26:38] message then let us press on and love
[1:26:42] one another and pray for one another
[1:26:46] because we're all in this together my
[1:26:48] brothers and sisters those who are
[1:26:50] called are in this battle together
[1:26:56] hallelujah amen this this is something
[1:27:01] my brothers and
[1:27:04] sisters is a part of our
[1:27:09] faith Jesus manifested in his hour by
[1:27:15] exposing what the error was in the hour
[1:27:19] in the religious
[1:27:20] real people that were preaching in
[1:27:24] Moses's message Jesus come and expose
[1:27:29] the error that man's
[1:27:33] Traditions put on the me the the law
[1:27:38] made all kinds of traditions as we spoke
[1:27:42] about that's what he did he exposed the
[1:27:44] greatest part of his
[1:27:47] ministry and the greatest opening of the
[1:27:50] people's eyes in that day when Jesus was
[1:27:53] speaking was them recognizing that he
[1:27:56] was speaking truth and they were
[1:27:58] speaking
[1:28:01] error brother brandham came in the 20th
[1:28:06] century and he spoke the word of
[1:28:11] God and exposed the error of the
[1:28:15] denominations is that
[1:28:18] correct and that was a coming out for us
[1:28:21] we can see that he exposed the a of the
[1:28:26] denominations but he also manifested as
[1:28:29] the wave sheet he manifested a Faith
[1:28:32] That Grew that
[1:28:34] changed amen and he introduced to us
[1:28:39] Christ in this hour and as John said I
[1:28:43] must decrease and he must increase and
[1:28:47] we know Christ is the word the revealed
[1:28:50] word of the
[1:28:52] hour and same thing in this hour my
[1:28:55] brothers and
[1:28:57] sisters if
[1:29:00] John doesn't
[1:29:02] decrease and Christ
[1:29:06] increase then you're going to be in a
[1:29:08] past
[1:29:10] age believing a pass
[1:29:12] word and not recognizing the true
[1:29:16] message of Christ in this
[1:29:18] hour he said in that hour don't go when
[1:29:21] they say over here or over there they
[1:29:24] got the message they got the message
[1:29:25] they got the truth over here we see that
[1:29:28] happening in this message if you don't
[1:29:30] follow this person or that
[1:29:33] person the Bible teaches us
[1:29:37] don't in that hour don't follow those
[1:29:41] things but Christ has come in this hour
[1:29:45] in this
[1:29:46] day he's the one that
[1:29:49] descended in the cloud he's the one that
[1:29:53] opened up the seal heals he's the one
[1:29:55] that called out your name he's the one
[1:29:57] that's perfecting your
[1:30:00] faith he's the one trying to get you to
[1:30:02] a place to recognize his presence in
[1:30:06] your life his voice in your
[1:30:10] life when you come and recognize
[1:30:13] that oh there's a power in recognizing
[1:30:18] the ability that you have when you
[1:30:20] recognize him in your life
[1:30:24] that's what this message is supposed to
[1:30:26] do get a bride ready filled with
[1:30:29] Revelation oil of who she
[1:30:31] is my brothers but it takes desperation
[1:30:36] it takes
[1:30:37] perseverance like the Bible says you
[1:30:40] have not strived with blood you have not
[1:30:43] pressed in the kingdom of God with
[1:30:45] violence amen do you want it bad
[1:30:52] enough oh this a age we are all affected
[1:30:56] by this gross Darkness this age my
[1:30:58] brothers and sisters all the
[1:31:01] pressure
[1:31:03] work all these things are upon all of
[1:31:07] us my brothers excuse after excuses can
[1:31:12] be poured down upon
[1:31:15] us but we have to rise up that's where
[1:31:19] we have to pray for one another when we
[1:31:22] see one another families marriages
[1:31:26] falling into the Trap Of The Devil pray
[1:31:28] in the Holy Ghost pray for one another
[1:31:32] we're all affected in the flesh of this
[1:31:35] age
[1:31:38] Hallelujah
[1:31:41] God the Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:31:44] here
[1:31:46] waiting
[1:31:48] waiting for you to ask for isab to put
[1:31:51] on your eyes for the scale to fall off
[1:31:54] of your eyes and when they do you're
[1:31:57] going to recognize that he's always been
[1:32:00] here he's never left
[1:32:03] you he'll never leave you and never
[1:32:05] forsake you like Abraham said it wasn't
[1:32:09] God who left me I left the promised
[1:32:13] land he s he told me don't leave the
[1:32:16] promised land stay in it there was
[1:32:19] battles there was people that he had to
[1:32:22] kill he he had to overcome he had to
[1:32:26] wipe
[1:32:28] out not like Saul when God said destroy
[1:32:34] everything When God Says destroy
[1:32:36] everything he means destroy everything
[1:32:38] my brothers and sisters and you stay and
[1:32:41] you fight in your life until you destroy
[1:32:47] everything this is
[1:32:49] how this is going to
[1:32:51] come this is how you keep oil in your
[1:32:54] lamps don't take it for granted get that
[1:32:58] deception lie out of your head that
[1:33:01] you're
[1:33:02] okay you have no right to Proclaim
[1:33:06] because you're in this message and you
[1:33:07] believe God sent a prophet that you're
[1:33:10] okay or even look at your life no you
[1:33:14] got no
[1:33:15] right the Holy Ghost is the one that
[1:33:18] confirms his word and interprets his
[1:33:21] word let him come
[1:33:24] until he comes and you recognize in your
[1:33:27] life and interprets to you you are my
[1:33:31] son you are my
[1:33:34] child

[1:34:24] vessels to point you to
[1:34:27] Christ point you to him that you may
[1:34:31] seek
[1:34:32] him every message that comes forth is to
[1:34:35] get you to seek
[1:34:38] him to look to him ask him believe
[1:34:44] him that he is more than
[1:34:49] able father Lord Jesus

[1:34:59] heart I spoke it to my best ability
[1:35:03] Lord I know it's broken up in some
[1:35:07] areas it could be spoken
[1:35:10] better
[1:35:12] English that people may understand
[1:35:15] better but Lord there's nobody that can
[1:35:17] reveal it
[1:35:19] clearer than you can in the people's
[1:35:22] hearts
[1:35:24] I pray for each and every
