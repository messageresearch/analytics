[22:52] amen amen Mark 11:22 and Jesus answered
[22:57] and said unto them them have faith in
[23:00] God for verily I say unto you that
[23:03] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[23:07] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[23:09] the sea and shall not doubt in his heart
[23:14] but he sh but shall believe that those
[23:17] things which he said shall come to pass
[23:20] he shall have whatsoever he
[23:24] said therefore I say unto you what
[23:28] things soever you desire When you pray
[23:32] believe in that you receive them and ye
[23:36] shall have
[23:38] them and when you stand praying forgive
[23:42] for ye have ought against any that your
[23:45] father also which is in heaven May
[23:48] forgive your trespasses let's go to
[23:51] Romans
[23:53] 8:15 amen
[23:56] forgiveness
[23:59] forgiveness is always about forgiveness
[24:02] we can't get anywhere tonight if we got
[24:05] an Unforgiven heart or we haven't
[24:07] forgiven
[24:08] somebody that's just is going to block
[24:11] the Holy Spirit from
[24:13] you not from me maybe not from some but
[24:16] whoever it is
[24:18] forgiveness Romans
[24:22] 815 for you for ye have not received the
[24:26] spirit of bondage
[24:28] again to
[24:30] fear we heard we heard about fear last
[24:33] week but you have received the spirit of
[24:36] adoption whereby we cry ABA
[24:41] father the spirit itself bear witness
[24:44] with our spirit that we are the children
[24:48] of
[24:49] God and if children than hirs and Heirs
[24:54] of God and Joint HS with Christ oh my I
[25:00] mean join HS and hes with him so
[25:04] everything that he is I am everything
[25:07] that he did I can
[25:10] do all power in Heaven and Earth was
[25:13] given unto him where is
[25:18] he so be that you suffer with him that
[25:23] we may be also glorified together for I
[25:26] reckon that the suffering of this
[25:28] present time are not worthy to be
[25:30] compared with the glory that which shall
[25:34] be revealed in US of course not because
[25:38] all the suffering that we go through all
[25:39] the trials and is bringing his glory
[25:42] within
[25:43] us that's why Peter said rejoice when
[25:46] you come into many Temptations and
[25:48] trials Rejoice because glory is the next
[25:51] thing that's coming for the creatures
[25:54] was made subject to vanity not willingly
[25:57] but but but by reason of him who had
[26:00] subject the same in Hope because the
[26:03] creature itself also shall be delivered
[26:06] from bondage of corruption into the
[26:09] Glorious Liberty of the children of God
[26:11] for we know that the whole creation
[26:14] granth and travaileth in pain together
[26:18] until now and not only
[26:22] they but ourselves also which have the
[26:26] first fruits of the spirit even we
[26:30] ourselves grown within ourselves waiting
[26:33] for the adoption to wit the Redemption
[26:37] of our
[26:38] bodies God bless you as just seat
[26:40] it amen there's so much in here my
[26:43] brothers and sisters
[26:46] Hallelujah glory to God the
[26:51] manifestation you know there's a a great
[26:53] movement out there and I was thinking
[26:55] about um uh uh uh brother Danny's uh
[27:00] testimony of um you know before he came
[27:03] to the Lord he was in that movement of
[27:05] uh positive mental thinking and you know
[27:07] that's a great movement out there with
[27:09] the universe and uh the laws of God that
[27:13] they're using out there and and we don't
[27:15] realize that that you know sometimes
[27:19] they and doesn't even a scriptures say
[27:22] in Luke uh that the children of this
[27:25] world are wiser than the children of
[27:28] light be because of the fact they know
[27:31] the laws of
[27:32] God they know what God has delivered
[27:37] they might call it the universe amen we
[27:40] know who the universe is amen we we we
[27:43] not only tonight we want to look
[27:46] at um you know the laws of God we want
[27:50] to look at what they're looking at in
[27:52] the universe and all what God does right
[27:56] but we want to bring it back back to the
[27:58] Creator amen we don't just got the
[28:01] universe like they do right they they
[28:05] got all the laws of God that they're
[28:06] operating in but we got him amen we got
[28:11] him and that's a very uh very important
[28:15] difference to recognize in him
[28:18] Hallelujah but also recognize that we
[28:22] got the same Authority and power and
[28:25] even more to operate in this
[28:29] realm Hallelujah I'm just trying to lay
[28:32] something here and get out my thoughts
[28:34] here amen because they are operating in
[28:37] the Supernatural it is the spiritual
[28:40] that they're operating in they're
[28:41] bringing things into manifestation in
[28:44] their lives and changes in their lives
[28:47] amen because they're using what God has
[28:50] given them not not glorifying or
[28:54] crediting who it is that gave these laws
[28:58] but they're using them and they're
[29:01] manifesting them and that's why he says
[29:04] the children of this world are wiser
[29:07] than the children of light amen because
[29:10] we need to break into this amen and
[29:13] never before in this hour Hallelujah I
[29:17] don't know about you but when I hear the
[29:19] prophet and I and I see his life right
[29:23] what was manifested around his life was
[29:26] not natural natur Al it was
[29:29] Supernatural he was operating in the
[29:32] spiritual realm Hallelujah he was in
[29:35] between Heaven and Earth all the time
[29:37] Hallelujah and that's no different for
[29:40] us though we're not a prophet we don't
[29:42] got that part but our part that we got
[29:45] is going to operate in the same
[29:48] Dimension that he operated in to bring
[29:52] it to pass to bring it into
[29:56] manifestation that's that's where God
[29:58] operates and that's how the word comes
[30:00] to pass
[30:03] Hallelujah to receive a manifestation
[30:06] the promises of God must be received by
[30:11] faith must be received by
[30:14] faith it's impossible to please God
[30:18] impossible to go anywhere or make the
[30:22] next step if it is not by faith this
[30:25] walk and the just shall live by faith
[30:28] everything is by faith not by our
[30:32] understanding and our reasoning amen or
[30:34] how we can figure it out or put it all
[30:37] together it's by faith we
[30:42] walk in faith sometimes you don't know
[30:45] the next
[30:47] step sometimes you don't understand
[30:50] everything that's going on when it's by
[30:56] faith the the word we have received must
[30:59] be mixed with faith in our hearts and
[31:02] that's how to see the
[31:06] manifestation you may
[31:08] receive Hebrews 11:6 but without faith
[31:11] it's impossible to please him
[31:14] manifesting is not about attracting what
[31:17] you
[31:18] want manifesting is the awareness and
[31:22] understanding that you attract what you
[31:26] are they attract what they
[31:30] want and sometimes we pray amen
[31:34] sometimes we ask God in our lives for
[31:37] things that we want but that's not
[31:39] attracting the manifestation by the
[31:42] spirit of faith and Revelation in this
[31:44] hour for the Bride of Jesus Christ we
[31:47] want to attract who we are we want to
[31:50] attract our portion we want to attct how
[31:53] the Holy Ghost will use us in our
[31:56] lives and fall in line with that and
[31:59] when you see yourself falling in line
[32:02] with who you are and what God made you
[32:04] to be then you start seeing
[32:06] manifestations around your life of the
[32:09] supernatural you start seeing that word
[32:12] coming to pass amen what is the word
[32:15] made flesh is when the word starts
[32:18] manifesting when you and the word become
[32:20] one in the same amen your agreement you
[32:24] aligned your attitude your thinking in
[32:27] your thoughts your heart your soul with
[32:30] that word that's being revealed to you
[32:33] and then the manifestation starts taking
[32:35] place in your
[32:38] life so manifest the
[32:41] manifestation is about attrac in who you
[32:44] are not what you
[32:46] want Hallelujah remember let's go back
[32:49] into the scriptures here the greatest
[32:53] manifestation hallelujah or the greatest
[32:56] law of attraction scripture that has
[32:58] been given to us is what we read now if
[33:01] you listen to Jesus just going back here
[33:05] that whosoever shall say unto this
[33:09] mountain now you're saying unto this
[33:12] mountain because you're saying it by
[33:14] faith because you know in your life in
[33:17] your situation God has given you a
[33:20] word he always gives us a word in our
[33:25] situations he never leaves us or
[33:28] forsakes US in any area of our lives so
[33:32] he knows what's coming today he knows
[33:35] what's coming tomorrow he knows every
[33:38] test and trial because he approves it
[33:41] and he always gives a word to
[33:44] you sometimes it's
[33:46] wait sometimes it's be still but he
[33:49] always gives a
[33:51] word and that's the word that you got to
[33:54] speak to your mountain and your
[33:58] situation sometimes oh you trial oh you
[34:01] pain and heartache you're just going to
[34:03] work for the glory of God you're going
[34:06] to work for my
[34:08] good oh think about it said of crying I
[34:13] didn't say we cry ABA father didn't mean

[34:28] agree what you have for my life what
[34:31] you're doing in my life oh

[34:42] doubt in his
[34:45] heart that's the

[35:00] speaks something to you when he promises
[35:03] it to you it's already been released
[35:05] it's been released from the other
[35:07] dimension because God spoke it it's no
[35:09] difference than when God said let there
[35:11] be light and there was light no
[35:13] difference when he walked this Earth and
[35:15] he cursed the Fig Tree and he spoke to
[35:17] the Sea and the mountains amen it's no
[35:19] different when God speaks You by faith
[35:21] it's already been
[35:24] released and Satan knows there's a
[35:27] disturbance going on in a religious real
[35:29] in your life he sees the light coming

[40:44] now oh
[40:47] Lord
[40:50] manifestation as a broad topic as
[40:53] manifesting we can't get
[40:57] we can get very precise details on
[41:00] clearly identifying it but it is mainly
[41:04] understood as something put into your
[41:06] physical
[41:09] reality through your
[41:12] thoughts through your
[41:14] feelings through your faith through your
[41:17] beliefs meaning that whatever you focus
[41:20] on is what you bring into your
[41:25] reality you you see we look at these
[41:27] things and because we hear it so much
[41:29] out
[41:31] there hey we hear it so much out there
[41:35] that when we start listening to these
[41:36] things we automatically our religious
[41:40] legalistic spirit Rises up and says
[41:42] pushes us
[41:43] out listen it's not theirs it's ours
[41:47] it's
[41:48] yours this is what this is where it
[41:51] starts we we we we've heard it with the
[41:53] greatest battle ever fought it starts in
[41:56] the mind it starts it it started way
[41:59] back with God in the beginning God seen
[42:03] amen God
[42:05] visualized amen God
[42:08] spoke amen and then the word that he
[42:12] spoke which is him was manifested it's
[42:16] no different in our lives my brothers
[42:17] and sisters it starts in the thoughts
[42:20] God deals with our thoughts amen he
[42:23] speaks to our thoughts and he Reve heals
[42:26] to our thoughts his word he has to start
[42:29] every one of us individuals are
[42:31] different some receive Faith real strong
[42:35] real fast some receive it God knows the
[42:38] process of each and every one of us how
[42:40] to bring us to that place we're all
[42:42] different we're all individuals amen so
[42:45] but God speaks into our thoughts and he
[42:48] starts revealing in our thoughts and
[42:50] many times we leave it in our
[42:52] thoughts God in order to bring what we
[42:55] are are tonight who we are and the world
[42:58] into existence God had a process that he
[43:01] had to do and we're Made In His Image we
[43:04] got to bring forth that same process we
[43:08] got a battle amen we got a battle on our
[43:11] hands to go through that process because
[43:13] we bypass our theophany and we're
[43:16] working our theophany is being revealed
[43:18] more and more in US amen Jesus didn't
[43:21] bypass his theophany that's why he came
[43:24] as the anointed powerful Son of God
[43:28] speaking manifesting amen no delays in
[43:32] Jesus no doubting in Jesus just
[43:35] manifestation of God's Will and God's
[43:38] word that was in him to fulfill but we
[43:41] by past theophany so we have to move and
[43:44] grow into that and as faith and as we
[43:47] overcome that theophany is growing
[43:49] stronger and stronger and what is going
[43:51] to make us become my brothers and
[43:53] sisters in His image in his is
[43:56] likeness that's the manifestation that's
[43:59] the greatest manifestation that's taking
[44:01] place in this hour oh Miracles will come
[44:04] signs and wonders should be just the
[44:06] children's bread it should be just
[44:08] following us but we focus in this
[44:12] message we still focus on healing and
[44:16] miracles instead of moving in this
[44:20] perfect faith and this perfect
[44:22] realization and reality of God's word
[44:25] made flesh made real made a reality in
[44:27] our lives as
[44:33] individuals you may focus and manifest
[44:37] through meditation
[44:39] visualization or just your conscience or
[44:42] subconscious but if you don't mix it
[44:45] with faith you may end up not receiving
[44:49] your
[44:50] manifestation
[44:52] Hallelujah so don't stop
[44:54] visualizing
[44:58] don't God reveals something to
[45:01] you oh it's been so long so what Abraham
[45:04] 25
[45:05] years he knew God couldn't fail he
[45:07] didn't stagger at the promises of
[45:10] God keep what's in your heart keep
[45:13] visualizing
[45:14] it start breaking into a real a
[45:18] spiritual real where you're bring it it
[45:21] what God has revealed to you to reality
[45:24] if you don't you know God when God seen
[45:27] he seen and he said it was good God seen
[45:31] it if you don't see it coming into
[45:35] manifestation that was the same process
[45:37] with God when God spoke his word he seen
[45:40] it he seen the animals he seen the land
[45:44] he seen the the the the air the darkness
[45:48] the light he's seen everything that he
[45:50] spoke into existence before it manifests
[45:53] and came in and that's the same process
[45:56] that we have to go
[45:57] through but we we have an adversary the
[46:02] devil is and tries to being unbelief and
[46:05] dealt didn't Jesus always
[46:08] say Lazareth was dead four
[46:11] days the daughter that died when he came
[46:15] he says don't doubt believe have
[46:19] faith you see what he was doing you
[46:22] understand what he was
[46:24] doing
[46:27] Hallelujah the hidden word is made
[46:29] visible when the word was hidden within
[46:33] God himself he was invisible to the
[46:37] created world but God made himself
[46:42] visible first God gave utterance to his
[46:45] voice and given rise to light from light
[46:50] and then he sent his own mind into the
[46:53] world visible before for God alone and
[46:57] not to the world but God made him
[47:01] visible the manifested word for this day
[47:05] so that the world could be saved by
[47:08] seeing him this mind that entered our
[47:12] world was made known as the Son of
[47:16] God all things came into being through
[47:21] him now I just can't have the time to
[47:26] break that down
[47:28] but my the son gave us the law and the
[47:32] prophets and he filled the prophets with
[47:35] the Holy Spirit to compel them to speak
[47:38] out inspired by the father's power they
[47:42] were to proclaim the father's purpose
[47:46] and his will you see God right from the
[47:50] beginning was always in control of
[47:54] everything
[47:56] you know God uses man God speaks through
[48:00] man but man is never in control God is
[48:06] always the one in
[48:10] control it's been his plan from the
[48:13] beginning and he'll follow it through
[48:15] right to the
[48:17] end when we realize that and recognize
[48:21] that in our lives what rest what peace
[48:24] it would bring to us that God is in
[48:26] control of your life your experience
[48:29] your situations your needs tonight he's
[48:33] always been in control the same God that
[48:36] called
[48:39] you will bring you R through he's the
[48:43] author and the
[48:44] finisher amen and all it is my brothers
[48:48] and sisters we come to realize as we
[48:49] grow and we mature in Christ we come to
[48:52] realize it's God that's in control he's
[48:55] always been in control and all you can
[48:58] look back and see you can see in your
[49:00] life the experiences the victories the
[49:03] overcoming power the things that God
[49:05] delivered you from blessed you with all
[49:08] you can see is the manifestation of God
[49:11] in your life Hallelujah and then you can
[49:14] look back and see all the areas where
[49:17] you got in the
[49:20] way you got in the
[49:24] way
[49:28] of
[49:29] him hidden word was made manifest so the
[49:33] word was made manifest as St John
[49:36] declares when summing up all the saints
[49:39] of the prophets he announced that this
[49:43] is the word through whom the universe
[49:46] was made he said in the beginning was
[49:49] the word the word was with God and the
[49:51] Word was God through him all things came
[49:55] into being
[49:56] not one thing was created without
[49:59] him and further he adds on that the
[50:03] worlds were made through
[50:05] him and yet the world did not know him
[50:09] he entered his own creation and his own
[50:12] creation did not receive
[50:16] him there's only going to be one class
[50:19] of people on the Earth in this last day
[50:22] and always have been that can receive
[50:25] him and that's those that are
[50:27] predestinated and called those that are
[50:30] a part of him the attribute in the seed
[50:33] of God can only receive him and I'm not
[50:38] talking about what he's going to do I'm
[50:40] not
[50:40] here nobody has the right in the
[50:43] fivefold ministry to take God's place in
[50:46] judgment amen and who's coming in who's
[50:49] going out that's none of our business
[50:53] hallelujah we're here just to preach
[50:55] preach the word and God didn't tell us
[50:57] to preach that amen who's coming in
[50:59] who's going out God is the judge he he
[51:03] said I will judge the motive and the
[51:05] attentions of the people's hearts I will
[51:08] show Mercy on who I show Mercy on Amen
[51:11] all we have to worry about and focus on
[51:13] Amen is giving our lives fully
[51:15] surrendered and completely over to Jesus
[51:18] Christ that attribute can do nothing in
[51:20] this day and age amen that attribute is
[51:23] driven Hallelujah
[51:26] it's driven in this hour to give a
[51:28] complete
[51:29] surrender what do you see when you see
[51:31] the wave sheet in our day what do you
[51:34] see what do you see when you look who do
[51:37] you see when you look what kind of life
[51:41] was manifested before
[51:43] you how how that that's the seed of God
[51:46] that came to maturity that's the seed of
[51:49] God Amen that became one with God you
[51:53] seen the word for for for for the day
[51:56] his day be made flesh it's no different
[52:00] in our day my brothers and sisters
[52:04] Hallelujah and when we see the word made
[52:08] manifest you see the father God because
[52:11] the word is the Father the word is God
[52:15] and the word made manifest is God
[52:17] himself taking his own word and
[52:19] manifested amongst Believers nothing can
[52:22] make it live in this hour and this day
[52:26] but Believers Sons and Daughters of God
[52:30] it's not for the church world but it's
[52:32] for the elected predestinated in this
[52:35] hour they're the ones that are going to
[52:37] make this word live
[52:40] again
[52:42] Hallelujah glory to
[52:45] God who are you
[52:48] tonight who are you tonight you come
[52:51] just to church to hear a good sermon to

[53:04] hour for it it always brings the power
[53:09] it always bring when you come into a
[53:12] realization Jesus knew who he
[53:15] was Hallelujah that's why he can speak
[53:18] the way he speak with authority amen
[53:21] with power with demonstration because he
[53:24] knew who he was and he surrendered his
[53:27] life to who he was it's no different to
[53:31] us in your
[53:33] life that's why he says when a person
[53:35] comes to that place in their walk with
[53:37] God you go speak your
[53:40] world why you're not speaking a myth
[53:44] you're not speaking what you want but by
[53:46] faith you're seeing the word open up to

[53:52] that I'm opening up to you that's your

[54:32] mind and you can
[54:35] believe watch what God will do in our
[54:39] midst that's how simple it
[54:41] is but the problem is we got a flesh we

[55:52] was excited more than it was when when
[55:55] he when he when the promise was given to
[55:56] him oh that's what it does to a Believer
[55:59] that's what the word of God does to a
[56:01] Believer knowing that the word that's
[56:03] spoken is going to be made flesh in them
[56:06] and manifest in
[56:07] them oh

[56:11] Hallelujah this thing is greater than 33
[56:14] years ago when I was called I it was

[1:04:46] sometimes
[1:04:50] okay let's
[1:04:52] go the people say the universe manifests
[1:04:55] their desires and what they
[1:04:58] visualize what they don't understand is
[1:05:01] that God created the heavens and earth
[1:05:03] and the universe and in there he placed
[1:05:06] laws in there there's vibrations in
[1:05:10] there there's energy in there there's a
[1:05:12] law of sewing and reaping you talk about
[1:05:16] vibrations oh my you talk about energy
[1:05:20] you don't think that that's not you
[1:05:21] don't think you don't experience that
[1:05:23] you do experience that everything we're
[1:05:25] talking about here tonight when you
[1:05:27] break into faith and you start speaking
[1:05:29] the word and you start see the word
[1:05:30] manifest manifested you talk about
[1:05:32] vibration you know how much vibration it
[1:05:35] takes to bring something from the
[1:05:37] supernatural into the natural for you
[1:05:40] Amen to materialize what you've been
[1:05:43] what God has spoken to you what he's
[1:05:44] promised you amen you talk about a
[1:05:47] vibration a lot of vibration going on in
[1:05:49] Sarah's body Amen to receive a son after
[1:05:52] she was passed the age age of given

[1:05:58] impossible but God's real of vibration
[1:06:01] and energy and spoken word hallelujah
[1:06:04] started coming and breaking down
[1:06:06] Hallelujah and that's what changed her
[1:06:09] body oh we break into vibration and
[1:06:12] energy all the time they don't
[1:06:14] understand what it is but God wants us
[1:06:17] to understand God wants us to take these
[1:06:20] law of sewing and reaping he wants us to
[1:06:23] understand the these things and apply it
[1:06:25] to our
[1:06:27] lives Satan always beating us down
[1:06:31] because he knows once you he doesn't
[1:06:33] care about them now listen to me he
[1:06:36] doesn't care about them you go on Tik
[1:06:38] Tok you go all that you see all kinds of
[1:06:40] people talking about manifestation the I
[1:06:43] spoke to the universe I visualized it I
[1:06:44] spoke it this that this came that came
[1:06:46] this came that came he's not going to
[1:06:48] touch them he's not going to bother them
[1:06:51] with those laws because they don't have
[1:06:53] the mind of Christ they don't got
[1:06:56] Christ's character and Christ's word
[1:06:59] because he knows if you catch that and
[1:07:02] you start moving and operating in that
[1:07:04] real you're going to be like Jesus
[1:07:05] Christ that walked on the earth and he
[1:07:07] knew he knew what it was like when
[1:07:09] Christ walked this Earth Hallelujah he
[1:07:12] knew what it was like oh my um you're
[1:07:16] talking about a million VTS going
[1:07:18] through the devil when he tried to touch
[1:07:20] Jesus amen hallelujah and then the
[1:07:22] apostles caught into it the apostles
[1:07:24] started moving into it amen and even
[1:07:27] their Shadow healed them even their
[1:07:30] Shadow
[1:07:34] delivered that's why he doesn't want you
[1:07:36] to know that's why he tells you and when
[1:07:38] you read all these things I was getting
[1:07:40] blessed reading all this stuff amen I'm
[1:07:43] sure brother Danny his background
[1:07:45] knowing all these stuff bringing it back
[1:07:46] to the word now oh my you see they don't
[1:07:50] have an adversary they don't have a
[1:07:52] devil fighting them fighting their flesh
[1:07:54] like we do cuz he doesn't want it to
[1:07:56] come to pass in our lives cuz he knows
[1:07:59] that we're not looking for our own wants
[1:08:01] but we're looking back to the word he
[1:08:03] knows that we are part of that word and
[1:08:05] he knows if if we're set free from that
[1:08:09] that word is going to come in flesh and
[1:08:11] it's going to manifest in our
[1:08:13] lives you need to understand that
[1:08:16] amen so you may understand the battle
[1:08:19] that you're going through
[1:08:21] hallelujah oh maybe God don't want that
[1:08:25] for you maybe as a Christian you
[1:08:27] shouldn't have that
[1:08:30] listen let me tell you if God spoke it
[1:08:34] to
[1:08:34] you you can see it identified
[1:08:37] there in the word of God it's
[1:08:41] yours God wants it for
[1:08:44] you and the quicker you can get rid of
[1:08:46] that liing
[1:08:48] devil the quicker you can start seeing
[1:08:51] it that's why he said my brother
[1:08:53] brothers and sisters he Brother Brad
[1:08:55] seen it so many times people had Faith
[1:08:59] he spoke you are
[1:09:01] healed you know that's no different
[1:09:03] tonight oh no no I know I know what
[1:09:05] you're thinking your only brother Tim
[1:09:08] your only brother Danny your only
[1:09:09] brother Simon you're not brother
[1:09:13] brandham so it can't happen but brother
[1:09:17] Bram says listen when he it wasn't
[1:09:19] brother brandom doing nothing
[1:09:21] anyways think about it when he when God
[1:09:24] showed him you are
[1:09:26] healed and then they started they
[1:09:29] started oh yeah yeah and then they
[1:09:30] started doubting he says don't doubt
[1:09:31] don't doubt you're going to take it away
[1:09:34] from you it's going to go away from you
[1:09:37] your faith brings it to you your doubt
[1:09:40] takes it away from you you know
[1:09:41] sometimes they manifest that I'm going
[1:09:43] back and forth here tonight sometimes
[1:09:44] they manifest that more than
[1:09:47] we that's why I said the scriptures
[1:09:50] they're wiser the children of this world
[1:09:53] but listen that's ain't going to stay
[1:09:55] that scripture ain't going to stay being
[1:09:58] fulfilled for much longer that scripture
[1:10:01] is going to come to pass and it's going
[1:10:03] to be for another day gone by very very
[1:10:05] soon because when this bride of Jesus
[1:10:07] Christ amen starts rising up and taking
[1:10:10] the things that God has given them this
[1:10:13] was created for you it was created for
[1:10:16] the Sons and Daughters of God it's for
[1:10:19] us to bring forth the word but they use
[1:10:22] it to bring forth their lust and their
[1:10:24] desires and their and their wealth and
[1:10:26] all these things but it's for us to
[1:10:28] bring forth the word and to manifest it
[1:10:30] in this
[1:10:32] hour
[1:10:36] Hallelujah the Bride of Jesus Christ has
[1:10:39] been predestinated to go right to the
[1:10:41] source himself and when she does she
[1:10:44] enters into his mind and his will she
[1:10:47] sees the perfect will of God and by
[1:10:50] faith it's revealed to her what God
[1:10:53] wants for her to manifest that is her
[1:10:57] part in the word and that's where she
[1:10:59] takes these laws of God and brings it
[1:11:03] forth in her
[1:11:04] life oh
[1:11:09] my glory to God I still got a few
[1:11:12] minutes here Saints
[1:11:15] amen thank you
[1:11:19] Lord skip over a couple things here so
[1:11:22] we can get down
[1:11:25] we therefore ought to be able to align
[1:11:29] the manifestations of God in our lives
[1:11:31] with the things that are necessary for
[1:11:34] developing and polishing our faith in
[1:11:36] him three things that are necessary for
[1:11:39] developing and polishing our faith
[1:11:42] number one the idea that God actually
[1:11:46] exists that means the word made flesh
[1:11:50] today oh yes I believe brother brother
[1:11:53] Tim God exists I believe there's a God
[1:11:55] ah they're saying that out there too
[1:11:57] that won't mean
[1:11:59] nothing that that's not what he's
[1:12:01] talking about here that God actually
[1:12:04] exists what are you talking about where
[1:12:06] is God today what's God's purpose
[1:12:10] today in me in you God
[1:12:14] exists oh yes God Is possessing his
[1:12:18] possession God Is possessing people in
[1:12:21] this hour oh yes God is walking God is
[1:12:25] living God is speaking God is thinking
[1:12:28] God is visualizing Hallelujah through
[1:12:30] people in this hour oh yes I believe
[1:12:34] that God exists in me
[1:12:37] hallelujah
[1:12:39] amen second a correct idea of his
[1:12:43] character Perfections and
[1:12:46] attributes oh yeah very important to
[1:12:49] know his character H Allelujah his heart
[1:12:52] his ways
[1:12:54] number three a knowledge of that life we
[1:12:56] are pursuing is in harmony with God's
[1:13:00] will we are a prisoner to the revealed
[1:13:04] word in our hearts we are in harmony
[1:13:08] with his perfect will you know Jesus in
[1:13:10] The Garden of
[1:13:12] Gethsemane he knew Calvary he knew the
[1:13:17] suffering and even for a slight moment
[1:13:19] there father if it be
[1:13:22] possible but it wasn't possible because
[1:13:26] he knew his will that's why he came back
[1:13:27] and said not my will but thy will be
[1:13:31] done and that was for us my brothers and
[1:13:34] sisters amen not our will but his will
[1:13:38] be
[1:13:39] done when we align with his will his
[1:13:43] heart for our lives oh you're going to
[1:13:46] see the supernal the manifestation of
[1:13:49] the word in your flesh experiencing it
[1:13:53] in in your flesh oh you can talk about
[1:13:56] the word made flesh the word made flesh
[1:13:58] but if the word is not experienced in
[1:14:00] your flesh you don't know what it is
[1:14:03] what it means the word made flesh
[1:14:05] applying the
[1:14:07] token and seeing it manifest in our
[1:14:11] lives
[1:14:13] Hallelujah glory to
[1:14:17] God now Faith is a
[1:14:19] substance going to start winding it
[1:14:22] down Hallelujah and by it we understand
[1:14:26] all those things are done it's not an
[1:14:30] imagination it's not it's a
[1:14:34] substance especially brother BR speaking
[1:14:37] here perfect
[1:14:39] Faith see if you had perfect faith
[1:14:43] you'll look straight to God and believe
[1:14:47] it and walk
[1:14:49] away we we read that so many times but
[1:14:52] listen put that in your experience say
[1:14:55] God if it's not in your experience say
[1:14:57] Lord help me to get to that place amen
[1:15:00] get to that place I I know I got no he
[1:15:03] doesn't want you to have faith my
[1:15:04] brothers and sisters he wants you to
[1:15:05] have perfect Faith Hallelujah perfect
[1:15:08] realization of who you are amen that you
[1:15:11] can look straight to what God is
[1:15:13] revealing to you and walk away and
[1:15:16] believe it other words it's done it's
[1:15:19] over it's
[1:15:21] finished it it can do nothing but
[1:15:23] manifest in my
[1:15:26] life whatever God promised
[1:15:29] you
[1:15:32] Hallelujah you don't need you don't have
[1:15:35] to no need to come into a prayer line
[1:15:38] that's still big in the message
[1:15:40] everybody needing to come into a prayer
[1:15:42] line you have no need of these things
[1:15:45] because your faith has done made it so
[1:15:48] already that's the problem prayer lines
[1:15:52] and all these things that happen happen
[1:15:53] is because people don't have the Faith
[1:15:56] said brother Tim that's that's pretty
[1:15:57] tough pretty hard statement Prophet said
[1:16:00] it if you had Faith go back in perfect
[1:16:03] Faith the message if you really got
[1:16:05] faith you won't need to come into the
[1:16:06] prayer line You'll stand right where you
[1:16:09] are and you receive whatever you have
[1:16:11] need of if you got perfect Faith tonight
[1:16:15] in your need you don't need brother Tim
[1:16:18] you don't need any of the other
[1:16:19] ministers to pray for you you can
[1:16:21] receive it tonight
[1:16:23] wherever you are you can receive
[1:16:26] whatever you have need of tonight that's
[1:16:29] why you said when the Holy Ghost is
[1:16:30] moving and the words coming forth and
[1:16:33] there's something on your heart claim it
[1:16:37] amen claim it in his presence you're in
