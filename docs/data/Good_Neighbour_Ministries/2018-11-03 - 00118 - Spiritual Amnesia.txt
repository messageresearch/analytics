discipline yourself both discipline that's like a curse wanna discuss it yes discipline come to Creighton okay the word death oh my experience is when I take this work and I shove everything and I believe this work and I stay on that work no matter what it comes back recently I just say what the worker says he ate my situation what glock me looks me Oh you look got some of your expenses God reveal to you does he cease faithful he revealed to you the answer sometimes you don't like the answer and you went on your own the whole thing's got chaos messed up you got yourself with the silent approach aged Oh God also God like the brother said the other week there were message respects you're single God we're gonna blame God for anything and the clay telefónica anything what some like each other why you telling the potter why is this happening my life why am I going through this white light why are the situation why do I have these drugs why can't I over it's because God reveals to us step-by-step semesters revealed the whole thing to you when he revealed one step and sometimes you think is so simple sometimes you think all this item or a more spiritual just listen to that one step all the way it couple of yourself just refer to it and he'll review the next step and then he walked into your deliverance if you be walking to victory that's how Bulls Saints God tests us and tries us the secret belief we're not going to take it off we're not breaking not need your help enough upon us because sudeesh walked under these were this world here to to partake in this world and any form whether you do it like desire or not that spirits here and it's we're not immune to it none of us is immune to it but our defense our we got is the Word of God by staying in the Word of God I'm just going to pull us off here I got a lot more to say I'm just going to continue this series closed off with a couple of things maybe doing remembers we are the corner of Sunday pursue growth finally we need to develop a hundred forgotten we are to be intent with what we have the two materially but we should never be content with where we are spiritually our desire should always be to learn more about God and an experience more of his power in our life and to serve Him more fully the moment you feel that you have arrived spiritually you become a clear shot for the devil's arrows when you feel you are strong enough you begin standing on your own strength rather than his and that makes you bonneville read widely read dig deep keep learning we used to measure yourself by how you compare to others people think of some spiritual other words make their standards of comparison to Jesus fenders and you won't have to worry about the feeling that you have arrived it's not the truth defending yourself to Jesus not anybody else competitor month the Bible says Paul says is Carla and how many times now we compare ourselves spiritually I can create that up great is good and I read and I know the word just question I can fellowship what the work is much said but you're better south of Jesus you'll have a problem anymore it should always fall short as we get older we will remember everybody's thinking in fact we forget lots of things some memory loss comes with the territory but we must work hard come back and fight to spiritual memory loss there's too much at stake here and if you are ever struck down with awful disease and peace away at your mind leaving you helpless go fret the disease may take you from some memory of those promises Network but rest assured he will never forget and interchange book vocalization shows that the energy sphere would come into the church and the Bartlett at making lukewarm making horrible and bothers that that was the pike that we're fighting today each and every individual walk it exposes the Satan that reveals his works his attempted destruction on cos people and discrediting the Word of God I hope that's what's happening tonight exposing him break down the time he's cast in the lake of fire he fights the church the bride he cannot stand it I'm telling you tonight if you receive the work every situation circumstance in front of you and even your own self working on your self your own pride your interpretation to put blocks inside you you can't stand it can extend the meeting every time to work instead because why walk because you might receive something that will destroy take up a good luck and set you free we're here together we're here as a body of Christ we're here together Saints he has not going to be on three job or what no I'm here with you fighting together you are my brother you're my sister like he loved my keeper he if I don't care for you in love for you in that way and I to get back in my spirit I see too many people always need myself the devil who works on people so much over and over all to myself I just going to worry about myself like they have this same thing I've not said they can elicit their on their disobedience well sometimes you can't go around certain people that are under certain conditions but you can't read you can't read woke up some people are danger at times they're in danger they don't even thought I might be in danger but God might reveal to you I'm in danger that I'm a cop of so many things it's all possible things God reveals it to you I know my brother's keeper he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that of the people this is the church age world get a true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the greener works she will be invincible if they get a true revelation of the two spirits working in the framework of the Christian Church and by God's Spirit desert would stand and by spirit Satan becomes populace status vital decisions come off into God's Word what we not speaking to myself to come often every day every memory expert tells you that the key to remember the person's name is to repeat it up when you first when you are first introduced now look at the natural type of spiritual repetition helps memory that's what type of spiritual we need to come back to God's Word again and again and again God's Word gives us the perspective that we need we need to remind ourselves of God's truth God commands God's standards set aside specific disability type everyday to read your Bible write down what you learn memorize key verses high-tops truth deep in your heart worship regularly not that you just come to church worship all the time why would they do that they want a Great Awakening they're crying believing that there will be an awakening they are good people why is it what have they done they have not recognized the wakening of the bride you see he's singing here the church a swamp the people are looking for a Great Awakening out there but they're not recognizing that the bride has been awakened she has been awakened you and I was up to question here today the influence of the Word of God deepen the amnesia keep the memory diseases that you didn't see needs instead sin means I believe keep the sin he kept illegally learn away from you [Music] and be the Christian they feel the cold yeah but they haven't recognized what's been done something has been done and what has been done can never be preached by that the Seventh Seal was kept under revelation that's why 23 to seven Silver's doesn't ever really he was his pocket because it's hidden and only revealed to the bride but something ended up something had been done in your hearts something in the done your walk God the great work that you and he said he pressing on deep breathing no stop the lay into you everything will be thrown at you a key in the world [Music] they're saying something this must happen but they look at it part way on the future to come you know those ugly in the message to be looking for these prophecies wait a future with the company right now they're happening to make your heart the Spirit of God which is the word of God I weren't a spirited like we'll put the bride in her place the preacher but the Spirit of God the Word of God will put the bride in her place causes she recognizes because she recognizes her position in the work that she's in Christ she recognizes her position in the word [Music] that she is in Christ you see our part of the Saints but not beat one of your faith is I can never do that anyways we gotta think is faith well she recognizes her position this is how where it's too late there's a lot more I can say a little bit more but this hours too late when we look to the Word of God when we look at the truth that's another truth who Steven sit here to make our identity who we are recognizing our position our worship that we are Christians not church members but we are bride that's supposed to produce this unlike not just the fruit of the Spirit my light I hear tonight the death light also side identity that we live is that I live my hand up there was in psyche that's what's taking place he's recognizing that that was going on in her life she recognizes our position in the work she recognized her [Music] like what he wants to do with her is today recognizing as they are realizing what is also they have amnesia of mental diseases Alzheimer's dementia spiritually speaking remember remember remember always the Word of God remember who you are remember what your call for your call sustained in this work your call the word drive not work right word right is it apparently it's not for everybody I'll take this way it's not for everybody or to the prize for you because you know you feel not good that we took the purse to the court not just of the book but anywhere God speaks you know surrender you on the side but screw what you need to push the side of the best crew for st. look we need to proceed and come to him he'll meet you there he'll do what he said he'll do the things that you're seeing not manifest in your life and that's respected you have to not to a place where God wants you you're doing everything yourself come to the end of that and come to him and God will do for you let's pray father [Music] it's a place that all the places stand in your closet because you see things so clearly but you can't speak it forwards but you promise Lord that my sheep will hear my voice and stranger they will not follow I pray for those sheep tonight one [Music] I've surrendered by night that I may stand here tonight Lord and God do things I've got your window through so I can stand here and be an instrument that your voice can come through now my voice with your voice and a spiritual rent I've seen rent where you are or if you're here tonight where two or three are gathered together by me I am in the midst of that and when we got into consciousness in our experiences and you become our spiritual I deserve it opens up we start seeing move and operate on this flesh this world and so many times in taxes or temporary amnesia mark but tonight loudly your spirit break every shop lines whatever people are seven that free the name of Jesus the rock with the word of God's revelation of what God is spoken in this hour it's what you have spoken in this hour father it's the truth it reveals the message of the hour that was the truth that means the weight and that is the life and no matter what is going to come any other way but this way grunting Lord bless your people and all the saints of God Jesus Christ see father we know that the Stars and the trials of the hurt painted and the written in these last days on the hard way I'm here playing because your sons and daughters of God and I'm here you're the boat would be turns 30 you said peace be still me because you had your sons and daughters [Music] and we are your sons and daughters Lord we are believing that the greater works is being done within us that we can do anything great if you'd won there's more than you through you

message but the cow takes spits it out and takes me back up and choose over and it gets better baby listen help me to this help me to feed I know it's going to make me become my enemies there's power the word is power there's power when I consecrate myself and I read that word and listen to that voice there's power because there's something inside of me that's connected to that that deep is calling to the deep the Spirit of God is moving upon the face of the waters of the work of God Oh God everybody shake themselves lordy this day and age we live in Lord I don't know how you gonna do it
