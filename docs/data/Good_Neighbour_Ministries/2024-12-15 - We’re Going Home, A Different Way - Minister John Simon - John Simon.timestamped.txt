[30:49] was taking place and until you come to a
[30:52] place where something changes really on
[30:55] the inside then baptism becomes
[31:00] meaningful then it shows that something
[31:03] on the inside has been identified with

[31:24] unic and they were walking along and
[31:27] Jesus had been on the scene and Philip
[31:29] was talking to him and you know he had
[31:31] heard these things but then all of a
[31:32] sudden Revelation struck his heart it
[31:35] struck his heart and he was talking
[31:38] about the scriptures Philip was
[31:39] expounding on the scriptures and
[31:41] immediately the unic said where's water

[41:50] the
[41:51] Lord amen uh we come with a me with a
[41:56] message today
[41:58] um from the Lord and I want to thank the
[42:01] Lord for it amen um you know of course
[42:05] every Minister will uh receive a thought
[42:09] from God and then he'll go to the word
[42:13] the Bible the quotes whatever to support
[42:18] the thought or Revelation that God gives
[42:21] to him however in doing so I couldn't
[42:24] find anything on this matter
[42:27] anywhere so I said this is very strange
[42:31] because it's very very very simple too
[42:34] right nothing or or shaking but is to
[42:38] bring attention to himself to his word
[42:42] and for his people it's between him and
[42:45] his people amen because the whole story
[42:47] of redemption is a love story the love
[42:50] of God for his people uh a love of God
[42:53] for his wife and he unveils it as we
[42:57] know um just like an onion just take the
[43:00] peel one after the other and it comes
[43:03] right down He makes himself known to his
[43:06] people so I'm trusting today that as we
[43:09] come together um with our brothers uh
[43:13] permission I'll bring forth the word and
[43:15] I pray that you will talk to me talk to
[43:18] the Lord respond to the Lord amen amen
[43:22] remember a a a church a service a
[43:25] worship service it's not the school
[43:27] schol
[43:28] room uh where we just sit down lined up
[43:31] and the pastor gets up here and speaks
[43:34] and and everybody stays quiet unless
[43:37] they asked the
[43:39] question and there is no uh wooden ruler
[43:42] that I have
[43:44] back hair to knock hit you on the
[43:48] knuckles or anything like that but uh
[43:51] respond just be normal be natural be who
[43:55] you are right if you don't uh if you
[43:58] like something I said said praise God
[44:02] Amen as I usually say I don't need Queen
[44:06] Elizabeth's approval for what I'm

[44:49] but Lord God it's just when the angel
[44:53] troubles the
[44:54] waters when the Holy Spirit Spirit comes
[44:59] when the angel of God draws near and he
[45:03] walks upon the word the waters may may
[45:07] that word come to life father giving us
[45:10] strength for the struggle giving us oh
[45:15] God that spirit for the battle that you
[45:18] might take glory and honor and praise
[45:20] today as we commit every little one
[45:24] every person uh from the oldest to the
[45:27] youngest into your great loving arms in
[45:31] jesus' name amen and amen the Lord bless
[45:34] you real good we're just going to read U
[45:37] um one text here out of Matthew Chapter
[45:42] 2 actually you can read uh 1
[45:47] to uh I believe it's uh
[45:51] 15 sorry not 15
[45:55] 12 one to 12 but we don't need to read
[45:59] all of that here today I'm just going to
[46:01] read this one
[46:04] scripture and speaking of the wise men
[46:08] and being warned of God in a dream that
[46:13] they should not return to
[46:16] Herod they departed into their own
[46:20] country another
[46:23] way that's what caught my attention
[46:26] there returned in another way amen
[46:30] praise the Lord God bless you uh please
[46:33] be
[46:40] seated now I'm just going to I'll tell
[46:42] you what I'm going to do I'm going to be
[46:45] preaching about the wise men but in
[46:48] reality I'm I'm really going to be
[46:50] preaching about you am and um uh I want
[46:55] you to know that I'm talking about the
[46:58] wise men but this applies to you and
[47:02] I um I will Begin by making Swift
[47:07] commentary on uh the scriptures
[47:10] concerning the wise men uh passing over
[47:13] it and then I'm going to go to what the
[47:19] Lord has placed upon my heart is that
[47:22] all right amen praise the Lord now is
[47:26] written Matthew 2:1 if you want to open
[47:29] your Bibles or if the scriptures up
[47:31] there you can follow it there quite
[47:34] easily right it tells you very
[47:39] much that when Jesus was born in
[47:43] Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod
[47:46] the king behold there came wise men from
[47:50] the East to Jerusalem of course we know
[47:54] those wise men uh they tell us they come
[47:57] from India Persia Hindustan uh they came
[48:00] from the East and that means they come
[48:04] from the East going west praise the Lord
[48:07] hallelujah and there they were and um I
[48:11] want you to know that when they came
[48:14] from the East they went to what was
[48:18] considered the seat of religion in those
[48:20] days which was Jerusalem amen and they
[48:23] went there and um they asked where is he
[48:27] born King of the
[48:30] Jews now we know that these men
[48:34] obviously knew about balam's prophecy
[48:38] that out of the root of Jesse will rise
[48:41] a star and uh when the star appeared it
[48:46] means that the Messiah was on earth
[48:49] now uh the sign of the star in the sky
[48:54] would
[48:55] signify that the Messiah was born and he
[48:59] was here and so therefore when they saw
[49:03] the star they recognize the significance
[49:08] of the appearance of that star we
[49:12] recognize the significance of the
[49:14] appearance of Malachi
[49:17] 4:5 we recognize the star of the seven
[49:21] Church Age and what it meant to the age
[49:26] of his is coming at this particular time
[49:30] in history to come upon the scene so we
[49:33] thank the Lord God that they saw the
[49:37] star now we understand that they all
[49:42] three of them didn't all of a sudden get
[49:44] a group group uh
[49:47] Revelation because of where they
[49:51] were each got an individual revelation
[49:57] and they each one saw the same star amen
[50:03] now we understand sorry I have to uh say
[50:08] this it's the same star but they saw it
[50:10] from three different points let me put
[50:13] it that way okay they saw it from three
[50:16] different parts different parts they
[50:18] were countries and they saw it in three
[50:20] different parts but you know that three
[50:23] becomes one right praise the name of the
[50:26] Lord here they were they got it
[50:29] individually now these wise men didn't
[50:31] know each other they had no connection
[50:34] with each other but they received the
[50:38] same
[50:39] Revelation and under inspiration of that
[50:42] Revelation think of it they left their
[50:44] homes their families everything else and
[50:47] you can read several of brother
[50:49] Brandon's messages uh uh and sermons
[50:52] hear them how he spoke they left their
[50:54] families and they packed up uh uh the
[50:57] camels and left individually where they
[51:01] were from going
[51:02] out and brother brand says one of them's
[51:05] wives asked him where are you going with
[51:07] all this stuff he said well I don't know
[51:09] how far it is I don't know how long it
[51:11] will take I don't know what I'm going to
[51:14] meet I'm going to walk with everything
[51:16] that I need because I don't know what
[51:19] I'm going to come
[51:21] across oh but thank God brother BR said
[51:24] totally different to us when we leave
[51:27] here we're not packing up we're
[51:32] unpacking every sin that is Li besets us
[51:36] every bad habit we're unpacking we're
[51:39] throwing off every weight that tries to
[51:42] come upon us we want to cast it away
[51:45] because we are leaving here to go in the
[51:48] presence of God Amen praise the name of
[51:51] the Lord hallelujah amen now where is he
[51:56] born King of the of the of the Jews and
[51:59] the wise men the theologians they didn't
[52:03] know they had no answer now remember
[52:06] these men were learned in the scriptures
[52:08] right they were learned in the
[52:10] scriptures but only when the wise men
[52:13] asked the question and then Herod says
[52:15] you'd better find an answer for me fast
[52:18] you you're making me look bad and they
[52:21] went search the scriptures and came back
[52:23] and says it's written in the scriptures
[52:26] in Bethlehem of Judea it's written by
[52:29] the prophet Hallelujah now these men had
[52:34] the
[52:35] scriptures it's not that he didn't have
[52:37] the same scriptures that the wise men
[52:39] had but the wise men saw the scripture
[52:43] had the revelation of the significance
[52:46] and the interpretation of the scripture
[52:49] Hallelujah but these men that were so
[52:53] trained and so learned saw the same
[52:57] scripture but they had nothing in them
[53:01] amen that can enable and Empower them to
[53:05] interpret the
[53:07] scripture and there they were blinded to
[53:10] the truth of the word of God
[53:14] hallelujah
[53:16] now he sent the wise men and said go and
[53:19] search diligently to find this uh child
[53:23] and when you found him find him then
[53:25] come and come and tell me so that I can
[53:28] worship him also we know that was a
[53:30] lie he just wanted to find where the
[53:33] child was to kill it which he did later
[53:36] on with all the others he couldn't find
[53:39] the one so he killed all right hoping
[53:43] that when he kills all he stamp out this
[53:45] message stamp out all of these people
[53:48] talk running around talking about a a
[53:51] star a message and all of this type of
[53:54] thing like that amen
[53:57] Hallelujah
[53:58] now they they stayed with Herod and the
[54:02] Bible said they
[54:04] departed and when they Departed the star
[54:08] appeared before them now brother Bram
[54:11] said do you know when they went to Herod
[54:13] the star left them that's
[54:16] right he says when you go to a
[54:19] denomination right there you're blinded
[54:21] and the light leads you right
[54:23] away but when you see the Bible says
[54:27] they departed from Herod they left the
[54:30] denomination they left that church they
[54:34] left that Society they were in they left
[54:37] that Lodge and they walk away from it
[54:40] they walk to the perfect light they walk
[54:43] away from all that was sin the star
[54:46] appeared the star appeared the light
[54:50] appeared again Hallelujah and when the
[54:53] light appeared and when there that
[54:56] religious institution the light of God
[55:00] LED them right to the perfect word I
[55:04] thank God for brother Brandon I said
[55:06] thank God for brother Brandon thank God
[55:09] for the Star Messenger that led us to
[55:12] the perfect
[55:14] word that same star LED them to that
[55:19] newborn
[55:21] child Hallelujah and there they met him
[55:25] praise God God after much trial and
[55:28] trouble look brother sister I don't know
[55:31] about you but I can tell you about
[55:33] myself it wasn't easy for me to come to
[55:37] the fullness of this
[55:39] message it wasn't easy for any of us to
[55:43] leave where we were in and walk away
[55:46] from it and follow this
[55:49] message under
[55:51] persecution under natural financial
[55:55] problem
[55:57] under emotional
[55:59] stresses under
[56:01] trials
[56:03] tribulations like nobody has ever seen
[56:07] oh think of these wise men leaving their
[56:10] homes they're coming with
[56:13] gold they're coming with
[56:15] frankincense they're coming with more
[56:18] these were all very expensive things any
[56:22] robber knows that you've got that kind
[56:24] of a gift on you it he will harass you
[56:29] give you all kinds of mental problems
[56:32] you wanted to know where it come from
[56:34] give you all kinds of physical sickness
[56:37] you want to where it come from you want
[56:39] all kinds of troubles your car wrecks
[56:43] breakdowns your life threatened every
[56:46] aspect of your life under danger why
[56:50] because God put a seed of life in
[56:54] you he put a attributing you and you're
[56:59] lead led by the word of God and while
[57:03] that word is leading you you're under
[57:06] threat behold their threatenings Paul
[57:09] said behold all their threatenings their
[57:12] blood thirsty that that's upon them oh
[57:16] God and stand with your people in this
[57:18] hour Hallelujah yes there it was they
[57:22] come across Hells and mountains and
[57:25] Moors and deserts under threat of
[57:28] robbers and everything else of course
[57:31] Satan is the biggest robber we know that
[57:33] right and the and the star LED them to
[57:38] this perfect child not in a Manger like
[57:43] they show us but in our house brother BM
[57:47] said they traveled for over two years to
[57:50] get where they were going and uh uh
[57:54] under inspiration he says now when when
[57:58] when when I was just uh coming to to
[58:03] know what God called me to do how that
[58:06] this woman that was an astrologer how
[58:09] many of you remember that story met
[58:11] him and said you young man he said
[58:15] there's a bunch of them were standing
[58:16] there talking young man you he says me
[58:20] he says yes you she says do you know
[58:23] that you're born under a star
[58:26] Oh my he says oh no no no I don't
[58:29] believe in that sort of stuff and she
[58:31] began to explain to him that you know
[58:34] just like how when the wise men you know
[58:37] uh followed the star each one
[58:41] following later on we understand it's
[58:43] Jupiter Saturn and Mars that those three
[58:48] stars right but as they approach
[58:53] Jerusalem the constellation
[58:56] cross and all three become one bright
[59:00] shining
[59:01] star and the prophet says here later on
[59:05] he's commenting on it he says while the
[59:08] stars were moving in the heavens and
[59:11] coming into conjunction on Earth these
[59:14] true three men who didn't know each
[59:16] other the spirit of God was moving them
[59:19] until their lives come into
[59:22] conjunction why do you think you're here
[59:24] today you think your here by chance
[59:27] you're not by chance you're here by the
[59:30] power of God by the spirit of almighty
[59:33] God let your here brought you into the
[59:35] house of God and we are now in a
[59:38] constellation of the revelation of the
[59:40] word of God hallelujah praise God praise
[59:45] God God moves in
[59:47] Simplicity it looks so ordinary oh I
[59:51] just felt like going to that church
[59:53] called Good Neighbor Ministries oh you
[59:56] you think it was like that no God lets
[59:59] you feel no he doesn't want you to be
[1:00:02] uptight feeling you under inspiration
[1:00:04] and you got to move like you you know
[1:00:06] like some people want to prove they're a
[1:00:08] Christian you got to have a Bible big
[1:00:10] like that for everybody no that's not
[1:00:12] the Bible on your chest it's the seed
[1:00:15] and the attribute of God in your heart
[1:00:18] that makes you who you are by the grace
[1:00:20] of almighty God hallelujah amen yes sir
[1:00:24] and you know when they
[1:00:28] came we understand that they gave him
[1:00:34] gifts and that's what everyone has to do
[1:00:37] is give him
[1:00:39] gifts give him whatever gift is in your
[1:00:42] life you may be not don't know that you
[1:00:45] have any gift for gifts and callings are
[1:00:50] without repentance brother Brandon said
[1:00:52] before you even repent or even talk to
[1:00:54] God that thing is in you it's there and
[1:00:58] maybe you even used to think why am I so
[1:01:01] strange why I feel so different you know
[1:01:05] as a as a child I used to wonder how do
[1:01:07] I know this I I don't know how I know
[1:01:11] but I know and I'm certain that I know
[1:01:14] Hallelujah and it's happening over and
[1:01:16] over again so what is it some other gift
[1:01:20] or thing was in you all the time from
[1:01:23] the day you're born and you didn't not
[1:01:26] know why you're made like that whether
[1:01:28] it's by dreams whether it's by
[1:01:31] significant other things that are around
[1:01:34] God placed something in you maybe you
[1:01:37] didn't even recognize it yet but I trust
[1:01:40] that you will recognize it today tonight
[1:01:43] tomorrow that you will recognize God put
[1:01:46] something in you and he wants to use it
[1:01:49] amen wants to use it for his glory and
[1:01:52] for his honor hallelujah amen offer your
[1:01:57] gifts to him gold frankincense M we know
[1:02:00] that speaks of his frankincense
[1:02:02] priesthood you know and the gold speaks
[1:02:04] of his deity and royalty and the mer
[1:02:07] speaks of his coming death right there
[1:02:10] you can see that those men didn't just
[1:02:13] read the scriptures they had a
[1:02:16] revelation they had a revelation of the
[1:02:19] scripture and that's why then knew what
[1:02:22] hallah that what were the gifts to bring
[1:02:28] they knew what gifts to bring because
[1:02:30] God had revealed it to them by the word
[1:02:35] now you got to remember when Abel Abel
[1:02:37] offered his
[1:02:39] Sacrifice by faith Abel oh so so so how
[1:02:45] could he get fith the Bible wasn't
[1:02:46] written
[1:02:48] yet how could he get Faith yes you see a
[1:02:52] lot of people think that faith comes
[1:02:54] just by uh reading the Bible it's good
[1:02:58] to read the Bible but real Faith perfect
[1:03:01] Faith the brother Bram said is a
[1:03:05] revelation and a revelation is by
[1:03:09] Grace a revelation you can't study it up
[1:03:12] you can't bring it down you can't beat a
[1:03:15] drum and bring it up or something it
[1:03:18] comes by
[1:03:20] grace and he only reveals to whom he
[1:03:24] Wills
[1:03:26] amen it's right in the Bible you'll find
[1:03:28] I'll give you the scripture later on
[1:03:30] where he said none knows the father none
[1:03:32] knows the son none knows the son except
[1:03:35] whom the father would reveal him and
[1:03:37] Noone knows the father except to him to
[1:03:39] whom the son will reveal him amen see so
[1:03:44] that's the way it is it's by
[1:03:48] Revelation and Revelation is not by
[1:03:52] reading the written word but the Holy
[1:03:56] Spirit revealing to you the unwritten
[1:04:01] word it's coming in contact with the Lo
[1:04:05] ghost you can't see the Lo ghost with
[1:04:09] your
[1:04:10] eyes unless he will permit you but uh by
[1:04:15] Revelation he brings you into contact
[1:04:19] with
[1:04:21] himself none can draw near to him unless
[1:04:24] he permits it none can come close to him
[1:04:27] unless he allows it amen praise God yes
[1:04:31] sir so they come with their gifts Lord
[1:04:35] and uh brought it to him the Bible said
[1:04:40] they
[1:04:41] worshiped and we know after that they
[1:04:44] prayed amen you know why they prayed now
[1:04:47] they have to go back to
[1:04:51] Herod and the Bible said they prayed I'm
[1:04:55] not going going to explain how they
[1:04:57] prayed what desperation in which they
[1:04:59] prayed and if they really prayed or they
[1:05:01] give a casual prayer Lord we have to go
[1:05:04] back there no they knew their life was
[1:05:07] in danger they knew everything was
[1:05:09] hanging online right so they prayed and
[1:05:14] L asked God what they should do let me
[1:05:16] tell you I don't care what corner you're
[1:05:18] in what problem you've got what
[1:05:20] situation you find in if you pray God
[1:05:23] Will Make A Way that God Will Make A Way
[1:05:28] hallelujah praise God forever more and
[1:05:31] when they prayed the Bible said they
[1:05:34] received a
[1:05:35] dream a revelation in other words the
[1:05:39] Revelation can come in form of a dream
[1:05:41] can come in form of an inspired thought
[1:05:45] it can come in the form of uh something
[1:05:48] out of the written word revealing
[1:05:50] Unwritten from written many ways praise
[1:05:54] the Lord but here we find that they were
[1:05:57] warned of God Amen in a dream don't go
[1:06:02] back to that denomination you came out
[1:06:04] of don't even go back to it get away
[1:06:09] from that thing and stay with the word
[1:06:11] of the Living God stay with the
[1:06:13] revelation of this hour oh praise God

[1:22:14] word of God brought you all this way
[1:22:17] through all this years he says he's
[1:22:19] bring you to that place when the Deep
[1:22:22] begins to call back to the Deep deep
[1:22:25] there's got to be something to respond
[1:22:28] to that call something has to be there
[1:22:32] to quench that thirst amen oh if he's
[1:22:37] caught your attention it's only one gift
[1:22:40] that you can give him and that is to
[1:22:42] give
[1:22:43] yourself do you believe that what more
[1:22:47] can we give him that he doesn't already
[1:22:51] own you can't get you we think we give
[1:22:54] him time and offerings the Bible says a
[1:22:56] cattle and a thousand hills belong to
[1:22:58] him right all the gold silver and
[1:23:01] everything in the ground is all his now
[1:23:04] what can we give him that he doesn't
[1:23:06] already own our gifts are gratitude our
[1:23:11] gifts are expressions of Love Back to
[1:23:14] God but we cannot outgive him in any
[1:23:18] possible way you see give yourself to
[1:23:22] God because God already gave you his
[1:23:26] gift right now the only thing you owe
[1:23:29] back to him is yourself to him wake up
[1:23:33] shake yourself look out there where
[1:23:36] we're at look those Wise Men We wise men

[1:23:55] highest he says glory to God in the
[1:23:58] highest who gave us our Lord Jesus
[1:24:00] Christ who we love and has brought us to
[1:24:03] this place we are his people bought with
[1:24:06] the price of his Precious Blood praise
[1:24:09] God now if you still have some
[1:24:14] stamina now we can start to really look
[1:24:18] into the word amen is that
[1:24:20] okay but before we look into the word
[1:24:23] let's sing a little song or chorus going
[1:24:27] home we're going home do we have that
[1:24:29] then you can put it up want everybody to
[1:24:32] going home we're going
[1:24:37] home we've got not long to
[1:24:40] stay for I've caught a glimpse of that
[1:24:45] Heavenly land thank God praise God we're
[1:24:50] going do you remember it now let's sing
[1:24:53] it go
[1:24:56] we are going
[1:24:58] home we've not got long to
[1:25:02] stay but long to stay for I've for I've
[1:25:08] caught a glimpse of that
[1:25:12] Heavenly land praise God where
[1:25:18] go in
[1:25:20] home amen now this wise men back there
[1:25:25] were going home by another
[1:25:29] way
[1:25:30] or I as I got into the office there I
[1:25:35] saw the Amplified Bible and I opened it
[1:25:37] and it says by another
[1:25:40] root right um and it made me look at
[1:25:45] something else there and it says they're
[1:25:47] going back by a different route a
[1:25:50] different way well you know you just
[1:25:53] avoided robbers and you going to go back
[1:25:56] the same way you don't think they'll be
[1:25:58] waiting
[1:25:59] you right well God knows that so he sent
[1:26:02] them back by a
[1:26:05] different by a different way amen praise
[1:26:09] God now they're going back home now you
[1:26:13] must recognize where we came
[1:26:16] from we didn't come from Earth if we if
[1:26:19] we are reected seed we come from above
[1:26:24] we are not of Earth we are of heaven we
[1:26:28] come from his presence the song says
[1:26:30] what this world is not my home I'm just
[1:26:35] a passing through my
[1:26:40] treasures somewhere beyond the
[1:26:43] blue the
[1:26:45] Angels yes
[1:26:48] sir the seventh
[1:26:51] angel can't feel at home in this world
[1:26:57] anymore yes so we come from the mind of
[1:27:02] God we were the original thoughts of God
[1:27:06] right and God's uh original intention
[1:27:10] was that we would come down here to be
[1:27:13] his spoken words Sons and Daughters just
[1:27:16] like Adam should have spoken the word to
[1:27:19] Eve telling her he wants a son he wants
[1:27:21] a daughter and that's the way it would
[1:27:23] have been but Satan perverted the whole
[1:27:25] thing and turned the plan upside down
[1:27:28] are you following me okay he turned it
[1:27:30] upside down so now here we end up coming
[1:27:34] to the Earth and before we could become
[1:27:37] what God wanted us to be amen we because
[1:27:42] when we left God we left in God's spirit
[1:27:47] image for he said let us make
[1:27:50] man in his own image right well no
[1:27:54] that's another topic you talk about that
[1:27:56] who's just us now we understand now that
[1:28:00] we are under Revelation that it's all
[1:28:02] his seed was in him and they were having
[1:28:04] a fellowship and they were talking and
[1:28:07] he was letting them know they're going
[1:28:08] to come to Earth here right and for them
[1:28:11] to come to Earth they going to have to
[1:28:13] become man and he's going to have to
[1:28:15] create flesh bodies and put them in but
[1:28:18] those bodies would be by his spoken word
[1:28:22] and not the All Flesh is is not the same
[1:28:24] flesh go and Paul will tell you about
[1:28:27] that right uh because we find out there
[1:28:30] that Jesus had flesh he said Spirit not
[1:28:33] Flesh and Bones but yet he could walk
[1:28:35] through walls and everything else and
[1:28:37] appear and disappear right that was the
[1:28:40] kind of Flesh that was We were supposed
[1:28:43] to be in but Satan now he wants to be uh
[1:28:48] trying to achieve creation uh you know
[1:28:52] uh without God uh chose the woman to use
[1:28:55] the woman as an instrument so we end up
[1:29:00] being trapped in a physical human body
[1:29:05] and as we say doing
[1:29:08] time and we've been doing time here in
[1:29:11] this prison of Earth inside of this body
[1:29:14] right and here we are and now we end up
[1:29:19] in a foreign land do you know this Earth
[1:29:21] is a foreign land Paul says we are
[1:29:24] aliens he says we are we we we are
[1:29:28] citizens of of heaven we not we not
[1:29:30] really from here praise God physically
[1:29:34] you are here but I'm talking about your
[1:29:36] soul inside you are not of this Earth
[1:29:39] praise God hallelujah we are the reality
[1:29:42] you know uh we are the ones with the
[1:29:45] eternal
[1:29:46] life right and we extraordinary people
[1:29:49] praise the Lord God hallelujah now you
[1:29:54] find yourself in a foreign
[1:29:55] land and you ask like I just went to
[1:29:59] South America and I wanted to be sure
[1:30:01] that whoever is going to guide me I know
[1:30:04] the person or the person knows somebody
[1:30:08] that I know and they're trusted and they
[1:30:10] have
[1:30:12] confidence I am not going to be led by
[1:30:15] somebody else into some dark spot robbed
[1:30:17] and choked
[1:30:22] and I I know you don't know anything
[1:30:24] about this that's why I have to talk
[1:30:26] about
[1:30:31] it right but here we as humans find
[1:30:35] ourselves in a foreign land instead of
[1:30:38] finding somebody we know we go and ask
[1:30:41] Mr
[1:30:42] Satan uh how we can get back
[1:30:46] home how are we going to return back
[1:30:49] where we come
[1:30:50] from right my goodness and of course
[1:30:54] being a good person as he think he is he
[1:30:57] gives you the best advice he knows amen
[1:31:01] first of all you need to join a good
[1:31:03] religion doesn't matter which one you
[1:31:05] can be Buddhist you can be Muhammad you
[1:31:07] can be Hindustan you can zoraster
[1:31:11] bahola swedenberg
[1:31:14] Mormon you whatever you want but you
[1:31:18] must be a religious person this is the
[1:31:21] kind of advice he gives to people yes
[1:31:24] lying because he wants to distract them
[1:31:27] from God's way because he presented
[1:31:30] himself that he's a Creator and we came
[1:31:33] to this Earth by way of the
[1:31:37] woman by the way of the woman praise God
[1:31:41] think of it so he says uh join a certain
[1:31:46] certain church and that church is the
[1:31:49] gate to Glory maybe you'll get back to
[1:31:51] Heaven that way and especially if you
[1:31:54] have uh the leader of that church say
[1:31:57] certain prayers over you sprinkle
[1:31:59] certain Waters or baptize you anoint you
[1:32:02] with certain oils you know um you know
[1:32:05] depending on what kind of oil it is you
[1:32:08] know I'm shocked I went into a store and
[1:32:11] they had uh bring back your husband
[1:32:17] oil there was another oil for
[1:32:20] wealth there was one another one to
[1:32:24] hold off evil to drive away this drive
[1:32:28] away that oils they have believe in that
[1:32:31] so he will go and tell you you know like
[1:32:34] that just go join a church become a good
[1:32:38] person especially now that you're
[1:32:40] getting old you know join a church when
[1:32:43] you're young dance enjoy yourself uh
[1:32:47] live while you're young you
[1:32:50] know time doesn't matter because you got
[1:32:52] a lot of time when you get old you can
[1:32:55] repent and go to church then but when
[1:32:57] you're young it's time to you know
[1:33:00] smooth moon walk and everything else
[1:33:02] those are oldfashioned dancing
[1:33:05] anyway but he'll tell you join a church
[1:33:08] but let me tell you joining a church was
[1:33:10] not going to take you in the presence of
[1:33:13] God we tell you become a member of a
[1:33:17] certain
[1:33:18] Society join a certain Lodge that has
[1:33:22] secret teaching
[1:33:25] right that will really show you how to
[1:33:28] receive
[1:33:29] Enlightenment right from the great eye
[1:33:33] of God and and to you become a man
[1:33:36] that's square and on the level uh like
[1:33:40] that so uh he'll teach you tell you all
[1:33:44] those kinds of Lies that's right not
[1:33:47] that those things are bad in the sense
[1:33:50] they they can make you a good natural
[1:33:52] person he can help you sometimes in
[1:33:55] certain situations amen but we are not
[1:33:59] called to do that we are led by the Holy
[1:34:03] Spirit through a prophet through the
[1:34:06] seventh star that has brought us this
[1:34:10] far amen and when the star brought them
[1:34:14] to the Christ child the star
[1:34:16] disappeared no more do you read them
[1:34:19] following the
[1:34:21] star there were now following a
[1:34:25] revelation that was given to them by God
[1:34:29] Matthew 2:12 being warned of God in a
[1:34:32] Dream by a revelation they went to their
[1:34:35] own own country in a different
[1:34:38] way they followed the Revelation that
[1:34:42] took them to their own country in a
[1:34:44] different way woman gives birth the
[1:34:48] water breaks the life comes
[1:34:52] forth Jesus
[1:34:55] uh John 3 Nicodemus was in a puzzle he
[1:34:59] was wondering what is Jesus talking
[1:35:01] about Jesus is trying to let him know
[1:35:03] you got to get back home in a different
[1:35:06] way right no man can come down go up to
[1:35:10] heaven except he first come down from
[1:35:13] heaven he had to be in the mind of
[1:35:17] God and then come down here trapped in a
[1:35:20] body but then to go back he came can't
[1:35:24] go back unless he was forc up there is
[1:35:27] that right you have to had to be an
[1:35:30] elected seed of God that was in God you
[1:35:34] come down you're trapped that's why we
[1:35:36] get all these things we we go into all
[1:35:39] kinds of stuff just like the people in
[1:35:41] the world
[1:35:42] did everything they did in the world we
[1:35:45] in here did it too sure it's not me just
[1:35:48] saying that Paul said he said Paul is
[1:35:49] trying to tell his own congregation he
[1:35:51] said you're sitting in front of me he he
[1:35:53] says we are all the saints of God but
[1:35:55] some of you were
[1:35:57] whoremongers abusing yourselves with
[1:35:59] mankind he says liars and he goes down a
[1:36:02] whole long list you're handing
[1:36:04] witchcraft you're handing this you're
[1:36:06] handing that he says such were some of
[1:36:09] you but he brought you out from the Mir
[1:36:12] clay put your feet on the Rock to stay
[1:36:16] praise God hallelujah we to him we give
[1:36:19] all glory and praise and honor
[1:36:21] hallelujah amen yes sir amen yes sir
[1:36:27] so God he's speaking to Nicodemus and
[1:36:31] Nicodemus didn't understand he said for
[1:36:33] me to get back home you mean I got to go
[1:36:36] back in my mother's womb to be born
[1:36:40] again Jesus said no you don't need to do
[1:36:44] that except a man be borned again he
[1:36:49] shall in no wise enter the kingdom of
[1:36:51] God then listen what he said he got he
[1:36:53] repeated it he says except you be born
[1:36:57] by
[1:36:58] water and by the
[1:37:00] spirit a woman gets birth the water
[1:37:03] breaks the life comes forth he says now
[1:37:06] you're going back but by the water and
[1:37:08] the spirit you see that's what Satan was
[1:37:11] trying to imitate and to copy he wanted
[1:37:14] to create like God could create and he
[1:37:18] chose the same kinds of methods but he
[1:37:20] chose it naturally but God is speaking
[1:37:24] spiritually here to us amen thank you
[1:37:28] Lord by the word of the water the word
[1:37:31] has got to break on you and when the
[1:37:34] water breaks catches your attention you
[1:37:37] see something in that Bible that you've
[1:37:39] been reading all them years all of a
[1:37:42] sudden it lights up you start to see
[1:37:45] lights upon the pages of the Bible the
[1:37:48] Bible becomes a new Bible to you there's
[1:37:52] not enough Mone markers in the world for
[1:37:54] you to mark all the passages that you
[1:37:57] think are significance after a while you
[1:37:59] almost have to give up because every
[1:38:01] word you read is a part of God
[1:38:04] himself oh bless God forever more the
[1:38:08] word breaks and then that Spirit of New
[1:38:10] Life comes Hallelujah yes sir I tell you
[1:38:14] friends man has asked as I said before
[1:38:18] the wrong person Satan and all the
[1:38:21] directions he's given you in your past
[1:38:23] they all failed but thank God there were
[1:38:26] still some men in the world they didn't
[1:38:28] bother to go and ask him amen they
[1:38:31] stayed away from him and they walk with
[1:38:34] God Enoch didn't ask the devil how you
[1:38:37] going to get back home but he walked
[1:38:39] with the word and the word showed him
[1:38:42] how to get home companionship with the
[1:38:45] word took him right back to his home
[1:38:48] Jacob didn't have to go and ask the
[1:38:50] devil but he lay there and as he lay
[1:38:53] there in a dream God showed them this is
[1:38:55] how you get back home he saw the ladder
[1:38:57] he saw the church ages he saw saints of
[1:39:00] God going up and down from top to bottom
[1:39:03] up and down carrying inspiration Divine
[1:39:07] communication under the power of the
[1:39:09] holy spirit amen yes sir oh my what

[1:39:24] him up and took him back in the presence
[1:39:26] of the Living God what about
[1:39:29] Jesus the Bible says and while he yet
[1:39:33] spake unto them he started to ascend he
[1:39:37] started going up you know the prophet
[1:39:40] said could be any time while we come to
[1:39:43] worship like

[1:39:47] moment you're

[1:40:54] here by human birth
[1:40:56] canal but we are not going back by human
[1:40:59] birth canal as we just read in John 3
[1:41:03] Jesus said no you're not going back that
[1:41:06] way amen you come down from heaven you

[1:41:35] to God you must be born again by God's
[1:41:39] provided way of the revealed word of God
[1:41:43] hallelujah yes sir praise the Lord so we
[1:41:46] have taken the word of God to be our
[1:41:50] guide to guide us and now now we are on
[1:41:54] our way home how many believe that we're
[1:41:56] on our
[1:41:57] way going home we're going home we've
[1:42:02] not got long to stay we've caught a
[1:42:05] glimpse of that Heavenly
[1:42:07] land because God sent a prophet to catch
[1:42:12] to reflect the light of the Sun and then
[1:42:15] reflect it back into the church age that
[1:42:19] we might see his
[1:42:20] deity we might see his glory and we
[1:42:24] might see his power expressed through a
[1:42:27] prophetic Ministry brother Brandon was a
[1:42:31] signpost he was there to point us we
[1:42:35] don't go and kneel down under the sign
[1:42:37] and say oh holy sign oh holy
[1:42:41] signpost no it's not the signpost go
[1:42:44] where the signpost is
[1:42:46] pointing praise the Lord so we're going
[1:42:49] where the SOS is telling us to go praise
[1:42:51] the Lord hallelujah amen yes sir I tell
[1:42:55] you friends we going back by
[1:42:59] Revelation amen we were allowed by God
[1:43:02] to see and because we saw we
[1:43:06] surrendered those men saw the star and
[1:43:09] they surrendered to the leadership of
[1:43:12] that star prophets said of course the
[1:43:14] star today is the Holy Ghost we
[1:43:16] surrendered to the leadership of the
[1:43:18] Holy Ghost amen praise the Lord see a
[1:43:22] lot of people get into fear because uh
[1:43:25] they say oh what you're saying there I
[1:43:28] didn't read it say like that in the
[1:43:31] Bible Well the Bible won't say like that
[1:43:35] because that part of the word is
[1:43:38] unseen it's an unfailing reality amen
[1:43:42] it's there in the word but it's not it's
[1:43:45] not the written word but it's there in
[1:43:47] the word he tried to explain it by
[1:43:49] saying my wife writes me a letter and
[1:43:51] when I read the letter I'm seeing more
[1:43:53] than what's written down on that letter
[1:43:55] I can see everything else that's there
[1:43:58] back of that and this is what the true
[1:44:01] bride sees when she looks at the word
[1:44:04] she just don't see the writing on the
[1:44:06] page she she sees beyond
[1:44:10] that because it's revealing it's making
[1:44:13] itself known it's exposing it's
[1:44:15] unveiling it's manifesting out of the

[1:52:02] life within them no matter how religious
[1:52:05] it sound no matters how messy it sound
[1:52:09] amen right no matter how many quates
[1:52:13] they know and it's good they have the
[1:52:16] rewards cuz you know in the book of life

[1:52:21] is not going to be in Bride doesn't mean
[1:52:23] only the bride going to be saved the
[1:52:25] book of life has positions 144,000 going

[1:52:38] know Prophet teaches us those things but
[1:52:41] so we got to understand they were not
[1:52:44] because they of all these quotes and
[1:52:46] they know all this and that and that
[1:52:49] they're going to be saved too but they
[1:52:51] will not be in included into the bride
[1:52:55] class of
[1:52:57] saints there will be somewhere else
[1:52:59] guard servants whatever there'll be
[1:53:01] somewhere else in the Kingdom but they
[1:53:04] won't be a part of that elected lady for
[1:53:08] the day and for this hour praise the
[1:53:11] Lord God I'm going to try to bring this
[1:53:13] uh to an end as quickly as I can but
[1:53:16] before I go further let me tell you this
[1:53:20] week I want all of you to go back read
[1:53:22] the book who is this
[1:53:27] MDC because it tells us our way back
[1:53:31] amen amen praise the
[1:53:33] Lord
[1:53:35] amen yes sir so we see our way back God
[1:53:41] shows us his int his original
[1:53:44] intention in the person of
[1:53:47] MDC how MDC came if you will read it you
[1:53:52] will will find he says here you see uh
[1:53:55] he came already in a word body theophany
[1:54:01] but you in order for you to stand
[1:54:03] Temptation you had to bypass your
[1:54:06] theophany right you had to come down
[1:54:09] here and be caught in flesh to be
[1:54:13] tempted then if you stand all the father
[1:54:17] has given me will come in other words he
[1:54:19] will come and call and all those if you
[1:54:22] stand all those who are his will I will
[1:54:26] raise them up in the last day amen
[1:54:30] hallelujah see praise God that's the
[1:54:32] kind of body he came with praise God he
[1:54:36] came in a theophany word body it and
[1:54:40] morphed itself and then it became
[1:54:45] flesh how are we going to go back we are
[1:54:48] going back in the reverse that's it
[1:54:51] there is the way not the way of the
[1:54:55] flesh but the way of the world we are
[1:54:59] going word became flesh that flesh might
[1:55:04] now go back to become the word and be
[1:55:08] the original what it was in the
[1:55:11] beginning the great Holy Spirit
[1:55:13] revealing to us his divine plan so he
[1:55:17] came with a word body that could form
[1:55:20] itself over a period of time into a
[1:55:23] flesh body right but we go back in the
[1:55:26] same way he came from a flesh body
[1:55:30] working its way back Revelation quickens
[1:55:34] you and brings you back to a word
[1:55:37] body praise the name of the Lord
[1:55:40] hallelujah amen we're going back to the
[1:55:43] godhead I said we're going back to the
[1:55:46] godhead I'm talking about in him
[1:55:48] dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead
[1:55:51] bodily all we were all in Christ we were
[1:55:54] all in the mind of God we were in the
[1:55:57] godhead then we flowed out from the
[1:56:00] godhead to this point where we are but
[1:56:02] we're going back to the godhead we're
[1:56:04] going back to Oneness we're going back
[1:56:06] to uniting time in him praise God
[1:56:10] forever more amen yes sir we're going
[1:56:14] back but another way praise God now we
[1:56:17] know uh and this the Holy Spirit was uh
[1:56:20] showing me this praise the Lord say that
[1:56:23] way that the the the original
[1:56:28] sin I myself we all get caught with that
[1:56:32] and we always say oh Eve was the one
[1:56:35] that commit the original sin yeah but
[1:56:38] the Holy Spirit was saying to me no she
[1:56:42] was only used to
[1:56:44] manifest what was your original sin
[1:56:47] right whatever happens in the heavens
[1:56:51] has to declare itself on the earth it
[1:56:54] was not the woman of herself it was
[1:56:58] Satan it all was in him with his
[1:57:02] perverted mind right this is what he did
[1:57:07] in the
[1:57:08] heavens now another place he says you
[1:57:10] know before you do anything long before
[1:57:13] you did it that thought was already
[1:57:16] there right even if it passed as a quick
[1:57:19] imagination it was there and then the
[1:57:22] act followers right so he already had it
[1:57:25] in his mind but just like anything else
[1:57:30] he has to use an instrument God could
[1:57:34] use his pure word and speak it let there
[1:57:36] be let there be but he has to use an
[1:57:38] instrument it just so happen he chose
[1:57:40] the woman to do that right is that right
[1:57:42] so this is what God was just showing to
[1:57:45] me don't just go blame the sisters or
[1:57:48] come down on the women just all the time
[1:57:52] no don't do that right because it's not
[1:57:56] them yes they were an instrument yes
[1:57:59] they were the first one to be to be
[1:58:01] deceived but it's not them it originate
[1:58:05] in heaven War originate in heaven Satan
[1:58:08] and his lies originate in heaven the
[1:58:11] original sin was not just in the garden
[1:58:15] the original sin was right in heaven and
[1:58:18] sake from Satan in his mind hallu
[1:58:23] yes yes sir so we see Satan with his
[1:58:28] evil mind srack the human race and got
[1:58:32] them trapped into bodies of
[1:58:37] Flesh using the woman as an
[1:58:41] instrument right and thus we bypassed
[1:58:44] our
[1:58:45] theophanies Hallelujah but now we're
[1:58:49] going back I said we're going back
[1:58:54] not by a woman but by the
[1:58:56] word not by the female but by the male
[1:59:00] not by the headship amen praise not by
[1:59:04] the the female but by the headship of
[1:59:07] the word amen Jesus said Upon This Rock
[1:59:10] I'll build my church and the Gates of
[1:59:14] Hell will not Prevail against it uh let
[1:59:19] me preach a little bit
[1:59:20] more let me year show her hands how many
[1:59:25] want but that's a kind of a
[1:59:28] trap cuz if you don't put your hands off
[1:59:31] everybody
[1:59:33] else I didn't mean it that way after I
[1:59:36] said it then I realized it oh my God
[1:59:38] some of them going to say oh my God he's
[1:59:40] smart he's just pulling a little stap
[1:59:42] it's nothing like that that was just
[1:59:43] innocently done but really I'm going to
[1:59:46] be finished very uh briefly it's exactly
[1:59:49] 1:00 so what is it if you give me 5
[1:59:51] minutes
[1:59:52] morning praise the name of the name of
[1:59:54] the
[1:59:55] Lord Upon This Rock I'll build my church
[1:59:59] it's based and built upon divine
[2:00:04] revelation divine
[2:00:06] revelation and as I said it's Revelation
[2:00:09] is by Grace you could have read the
[2:00:12] Bible 5,000 times but when your time
[2:00:16] comes like I've always quoted the quote
[2:00:18] where brother Bram said yes and they
[2:00:21] will will only know when it is time for
[2:00:25] them to know when your individual time
[2:00:29] comes the word will break the spirit of
[2:00:32] God will move across your life like that
[2:00:35] amen so Upon This Rock I build my church
[2:00:39] and the Gates of Hell will not Prevail
[2:00:41] of course the Gates of Hell going to
[2:00:42] fight it this is what he's saying here
[2:00:44] but it won't Prevail praise God
[2:00:46] hallelujah let me say make a statement
[2:00:49] here there's no person that has ever
[2:00:52] come in the presence of Jesus Christ or
[2:00:55] in the pr the real presence of God that
[2:00:58] ever went back out the way they
[2:01:02] came
[2:01:04] never Legion was mad as mad could be
[2:01:09] insane lost his
[2:01:11] mind he needed more than a
[2:01:14] psychiatrist needed more than a priest
[2:01:16] with a brass cross in front of him uh
[2:01:19] trying to rebuke the devil like by that
[2:01:22] no he none of those he didn't know what
[2:01:25] to do and they just left him in the
[2:01:27] tombs amen but praise God then came
[2:01:33] Jesus on the scene and he went back and
[2:01:36] was never the same again Bible says he
[2:01:39] was in his right mind why he met the
[2:01:42] word and when you meet the word you

[2:01:56] revealed word god straighten out your
[2:01:59] mind now you can see things by God's
[2:02:02] equation of his word amen what about the
[2:02:05] woman at the well she came and met him
[2:02:08] with her life one way she went back a
[2:02:11] different way come see a man that show

[2:05:59] same river that the children of Israel
[2:06:02] had to cross Jordan and go over into
[2:06:06] their promised
[2:06:07] land and you know the pillar of fire
[2:06:11] disappeared from that time never seen
[2:06:14] again until it comes back to the book of
[2:06:17] Acts wasn't seen again because they
[2:06:20] didn't need it they had the arrived they
[2:06:22] gone entered into their Promised Land
[2:06:25] praise the name of the Lord and now we
[2:06:28] are come to that place we don't need
[2:06:30] that star to guide us anymore it's
[2:06:33] brought us to the perfect word and the
[2:06:36] word takes us the rest of the
[2:06:38] way it take us across the chasm that's
[2:06:42] why you see he has holy spirit amen if
[2:06:44] it's up there you can see it the only
[2:06:47] person can take you over that is the
[2:06:49] Holy Spirit hallah Hallelujah by
[2:06:52] Revelation he takes you over yes sir
[2:06:55] amen praise God not by study not by look
[2:07:00] I've done all of that I've done the 21
[2:07:03] day fast up to 40 I never went beyond
[2:07:05] that oh my
[2:07:08] God prayed all night after my wife is
[2:07:11] sitting right there she can tell you
[2:07:12] pray all night and not just soft nice
[2:07:15] prayers but prayers that will rock rock
[2:07:18] the building praise praying in the
[2:07:20] presence of God all of that but that's
[2:07:23] not what it is that's not what it is
[2:07:26] brother and sister it's simply God chose
[2:07:30] you and elected youah and he choose to
[2:07:35] reveal or make known himself to
[2:07:39] you and he can do it through or by the
[2:07:43] simplest piece of scripture in here the
[2:07:46] written word is only a representation of
[2:07:48] the invisible God see see so we just put
[2:07:52] our faith we read the written word so
[2:07:55] that he has a Gateway or a way to make
[2:07:58] himself known to us praise the name of
[2:08:00] the Lord I want you to get hungry enough
[2:08:02] so that when I leave here you want to
[2:08:04] leave here like a bunch of race horses
[2:08:06] to get to your uh get to sual or
[2:08:11] Steakhouse or or whatever or if you have
[2:08:14] a roasted Christmas turkey at home you
[2:08:16] want to get out of here quick but man
[2:08:19] shall not live by bread alone
[2:08:22] but by every word of God is that right
[2:08:26] but while he is in this body he shall
[2:08:28] not live by the word of God only he
[2:08:31] needs some
[2:08:32] physical food for his natural body is
[2:08:36] that right brother praise the name of
[2:08:38] the Lord hallelujah so I said it and I
[2:08:41] mean it I'm going to be finished here
[2:08:43] hallelujah they got across Jordan it
[2:08:46] never was seen again and my closing
[2:08:48] thoughts now remember when Abra Abraham
[2:08:52] had the victory over the five Kings you
[2:08:55] remember that and you know I preached on
[2:08:58] that before the five Kings with your
[2:08:59] five senses is really what the spirit of
[2:09:02] God is teaching us Abraham is the type
[2:09:05] of the believer who by faith now
[2:09:07] overcome their five senses that tries to
[2:09:10] control their life the devil using your
[2:09:12] imagination your thoughts your your and
[2:09:15] so to control the believer but we got
[2:09:18] the victory over it we still have them
[2:09:22] senses but we don't trust them we trust
[2:09:24] the
[2:09:25] word our faith is in the word of God
[2:09:29] hallelujah no matter how my senses tell
[2:09:31] me one thing the word says something
[2:09:33] else is that right praise the name of
[2:09:36] the Lord so there he is coming back from
[2:09:40] defeating the five Kings and he is met
[2:09:43] by
[2:09:44] MDC what was he doing he was going home
[2:09:48] he's on his way going home and MDC meets
[2:09:53] him and what does he do he serves in
[2:09:56] communion right that's why when Jesus
[2:09:59] came later on he instituted it serving
[2:10:03] the communion the bread and the wine but
[2:10:05] MC had already done that back there
[2:10:08] right uh it's just that he came down
[2:10:10] into flesh and he did what he already
[2:10:12] done one he did up here and the next one
[2:10:15] he does here one he did to Abraham now
[2:10:18] we see Abraham's Royal F seed is coming
[2:10:23] back home after their victory over
[2:10:26] denominations over demons over Devils
[2:10:29] over trials and tribulation and they're
[2:10:32] going back home ready to go in a Rapture
[2:10:35] and again her comes
[2:10:39] MDC in the form of the revealed word his
[2:10:43] theophonic
[2:10:45] body making itself known to each
[2:10:48] individual believer and revealing it
[2:10:51] himself to them thank you giving them
