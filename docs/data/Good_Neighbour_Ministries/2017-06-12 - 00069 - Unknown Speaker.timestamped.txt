[0:29] when I tell you to then you put that on
[0:32] okay praise the Lord okay um as I was
[0:37] coming along actually I didn't intend to
[0:40] speak at all I thought brother coffee
[0:42] was going to be here but he you know he
[0:45] got a certain call with something and he
[0:47] was occupying he came back and I wanted
[0:50] him to give his missionary report right
[0:55] about what actually took place by the
[0:57] way um he called me just let me know
[1:00] that he was back and he was excited he
[1:03] didn't talk to me long but he was
[1:05] excited just to say well praise the Lord
[1:08] Pastor um you know I went back to that
[1:11] church that we went to uh in the woods
[1:15] there where we had to go down that uh
[1:17] dirt road and the car got stuck in the
[1:20] Stream and and uh stuff like that you
[1:23] know and um he said I went back there
[1:27] this past this past Friday Friday last
[1:32] to speak there after I had left on
[1:35] Thursday he went back on Friday night
[1:37] their service to speak there and he said
[1:40] he had a wonderful service and um he
[1:44] didn't feel like going back driving two
[1:47] hours back to the city so he stayed in
[1:50] the pastor's office in the back not an
[1:53] office like mine mine would be really
[1:57] nice uh and he said just lay on one of
[2:01] the chairs there and took his jacket and
[2:04] make a pillow and he slept in the
[2:07] pastor's office in there all right now
[2:11] um but that's not what this is about he
[2:14] said that uh he got a
[2:17] call uh on Monday and it was the pastor
[2:22] of that church and he said I I I don't
[2:25] know what happened he said but on Sunday
[2:30] he says crowds of people turned out he
[2:34] don't know where they came from and the
[2:37] church was jam packed and people all
[2:40] around standing
[2:43] outside and he asking him what what what
[2:46] happened how come you came here what did
[2:49] you what brought you here and stuff like
[2:52] that they just
[2:55] heard that I was
[2:58] there and they thought I was still there
[3:01] with my wife and that I was going to
[3:04] preach on Sunday so I don't know these
[3:08] people but somehow they heard and they
[3:10] come out in droves he said he had to go
[3:14] try to go and get things for them to sit
[3:17] on he used up all his extra chairs
[3:19] outside and people were still standing
[3:22] he said since the church started I've
[3:24] never seen anything like
[3:26] this oh praise God he says but he pre
[3:29] said anyways preach the word of God
[3:31] anyway and I trust that some of them
[3:33] were uh converted because some of them
[3:36] were
[3:37] Pentecostal from the Pentecostal Church
[3:40] round about and stuff like that and uh
[3:44] they they turned out so something seems
[3:47] to be happening there and we want to
[3:49] give for God praise for that prise thank
[3:53] you Lord
[3:57] hallelujah thank you Jesus
[4:00] I think that was wonderful I still have
[4:02] a peppermint in my for my throat
[4:06] here yeah you don't mind me just being
[4:09] normal
[4:13] right but we had a great time there in
[4:16] Africa and I just want to say that uh
[4:19] that we had a great time and the
[4:21] people's hearts and the response to the
[4:24] gospel is absolutely outstanding so we
[4:27] want to thank the Lord for that uh
[4:30] anyway brother coffee will speak for
[4:32] himself when he does come right he'll
[4:35] speak for himself let me mention this
[4:37] you change the subject sister CA how
[4:40] many remember Sister CA she was here Su
[4:44] K she's just graduated from University
[4:48] as a financial
[4:50] analyst and um so I just wanted you to
[4:53] know that that the Lord has blessed her
[4:55] and brought her through cuz you remember
[4:57] her problems uh um or you may not know
[5:01] her problems at one point she didn't
[5:02] have the money to pay the fees to finish
[5:06] uh this past year and uh God worked a
[5:11] miracle we a very wealthy person just
[5:15] paid
[5:16] it amen a Welling person just paid it uh
[5:21] she's never seen the person there's know
[5:24] the person person just gave the money
[5:27] and paid her fees so we want give God
[5:30] for the miracle that's the reason why I
[5:32] mention it actually that we still serve
[5:34] a miracle work
[5:36] amen
[5:39] amen and by the way the fees were not
[5:41] $1,000 it was more like uh I think it
[5:45] was something like
[5:46] $25,000 you know that finished up all
[5:49] paying up all other fees that she might
[5:51] have hold or whatever but I just took
[5:53] care of it so God we serve a mighty God
[5:55] Amen and God is able in all
[5:58] circumstances
[5:59] all conditions amen praise the Lord
[6:03] hallelujah well for the past weeks uh
[6:06] while I was here I uh was speaking on
[6:11] the uh bright Revival seven tunders
[6:15] character of Christ in you uh talking
[6:18] about various things of that
[6:20] nature and
[6:23] um it's so
[6:26] strange but as I was was coming
[6:30] along uh thinking about different things
[6:35] the Holy Spirit brought something to my
[6:38] attention and while the bridegroom
[6:42] tering they all slumbered and
[6:45] slept well you know I preached on the
[6:48] part where he emphasized that they all
[6:52] Slumber and uh you know let me warn you
[6:56] and warn the
[6:58] Believers that
[7:00] um it's not just the Sinners but the be
[7:03] himself prophesying that the Believers
[7:07] at the bright time are going to have a
[7:09] Spirit of Slumber sleep slow down look
[7:13] warm cold down uh everything is going to
[7:15] start coming on them burden the devil is
[7:18] going to put cares put burdens upon them
[7:22] to put them in the sleep a condition of
[7:26] Slumber amen and I F show you this past
[7:30] Sunday that uh to they slumbered and
[7:35] slept Revival he says means to shake
[7:38] yourself to wake up Amen to wake up
[7:42] that's what Revival so so what's
[7:44] happening we have the word the word
[7:47] starts to become so ordinary until we
[7:50] start not paying as much attention as we
[7:54] would and we start to spiritually fall
[7:57] asleep with our eyes open right M amen
[8:00] our eyes wide open and yet we are asleep
[8:05] to what God is doing I'm briefly
[8:07] touching on what what I said what the
[8:11] holy spirit said through me uh for his
[8:13] glory and I know that for fact because I
[8:17] myself was falling asleep I don't know
[8:19] about you but I was falling asleep and
[8:22] starting to Slumber amen because Slumber
[8:26] is not just normal sleep Slumber is when
[8:31] you are in deep sleep and uh and things
[8:35] going on around you and you don't even
[8:37] know what's going on around you
[8:39] Supernatural occurrences taking place
[8:41] and you're not really aware of it right
[8:45] but then uh they slumbered and slept but
[8:49] as I was just coming this is just just
[8:51] now holy spirit said uh if they were
[8:55] slumbering and they're
[8:57] sleeping what woke them up
[9:00] M and then it hit me the seven Thunders
[9:04] woke them up it was a voice of God
[9:07] behold the bridegroom cometh amen and
[9:11] they heard the Midnight Cry of God's
[9:14] voice they heard the blast of the seven
[9:18] Thunders and it shook them to their core
[9:22] amen amen we have a message brothers and
[9:25] sisters amen and this message should be
[9:28] shaking the word shaking the community
[9:31] and shaking our own Hearts amen and uh a
[9:36] way with just the C singing do you know
[9:39] C singing and even come to the message
[9:43] where people are singing the songs of
[9:45] the message through style through Talent
[9:49] through uh abilities human ability and
[9:53] stuff like that and do you know I can
[9:57] remember the time and the days not too
[10:00] long ago Even in our church in the early
[10:02] days people get up to sing a song and
[10:05] and and the tears flowing down their
[10:07] eyes amen cuz when just to sing yes
[10:12] Jesus loves me right away amen the Lord
[10:17] touches your heart amen when you sing
[10:21] the songs like he took my place at
[10:25] Calvary he took my place at calary
[10:30] yes when he was on the
[10:33] cross I was on his
[10:37] mind yes he knew
[10:41] me yes he Lov me oh God he who caused
[10:47] the Stars the entire Heavens to shine
[10:51] M what has happened now the people are
[10:55] singing the same songs but it doesn't
[10:58] have the R anymore because they're
[11:01] trying to make it so polished and so
[11:04] acceptable and and and that's some what
[11:07] God wants and we not here to make the
[11:10] message acceptable to you or anybody we
[11:13] want raw primtive Christianity like the
[11:17] apostles
[11:18] are amen that's what we need back in the
[11:22] Church of the Living God hallelujah amen
[11:25] instead of trying to polish it up and
[11:28] and and and put it on a new oxcar to try
[11:31] to bring it in that's what we need we
[11:34] need to go right back to the original
[11:37] like promise in the Bible amen
[11:40] hallelujah it's clear here brother that
[11:43] we need we who have been called in this
[11:47] last hour we are given the some toal of
[11:51] all of the seven Church agent all the
[11:55] revelations combined in one now the
[11:59] fullness of the voice of
[12:01] God
[12:03] hallelujah my god when we speak this
[12:06] word it's the same voice that John heard
[12:12] that he said seven Thunders under their
[12:15] voices Lightnings thunderings came out
[12:18] of the Throne of God hallelujah wow it's
[12:22] God's voice that he heard but he heard
[12:25] it through the Seven Ages right seven
[12:29] Thunders uttered their voices but
[12:32] actually one voice but it uttered down
[12:36] through the church ages so he heard it
[12:39] like what Rolling Thunder that's how you
[12:42] heard it like Rolling Thunder it went
[12:46] from one age to the next to the next and
[12:47] the next and the next it went down like
[12:50] that but in all of it it was one voice
[12:53] amen and what we have the prophet said
[12:56] is the voice of God is these last days
[13:01] we have the whole thing combined what a
[13:03] people we are to be and how we should
[13:07] come together in the house of God with
[13:10] humility and with Grace with sincerity
[13:14] with the love of God within our soul and
[13:17] the spirit of God within our hearts our
[13:19] hearts should be almost like broken for
[13:23] what he did for us and what we did to
[13:27] him because it's our sins that nailed
[13:30] him to the Cross amen amen praise the
[13:33] Lord our sins nailed him there to the
[13:36] Cross we are the ones that provided the
[13:39] spikes that placed him there praise God
[13:43] you you you see what I'm talking about
[13:46] I'm just making a little Point here
[13:48] today it appears to be a little Point
[13:50] here today but brother sister the only
[13:54] thing in this age uh that can wake the
[13:58] people up and wake up the bride and wake
[14:02] up the members of the Bride is the seven
[14:05] thunders of Revelation 10 amen when he
[14:09] the mighty Angel uted his voice seven
[14:12] Thunders UT their voices when he uted
[14:16] his voice the people heard it seven ters
[14:20] UT their
[14:21] voices the voice of the mighty Angel
[14:24] Christ The Covenant Angel come down
[14:28] among the speak to speak his own words
[14:31] and rolling thunder where we can hear it
[14:34] with our ears with our hearts amen and
[14:37] believe it not intellectually but it
[14:40] grabs your soul and you're moved by the
[14:43] spirit of almighty God Amen not moved
[14:46] even by the religious knowledge that we
[14:48] have people that follow this message for
[14:50] 30 40 years somebody called me up uh you
[14:53] know and said oh my God I heard this
[14:56] preacher brother that was preaching for
[14:58] so many years years that now his
[15:01] daughters are running around with shorts
[15:03] and he's saying he wasted his life for
[15:05] for 25 years and and and and he don't
[15:09] believe the message is the truth anymore
[15:11] and and stuff like that you know they
[15:14] don't understand it shows he wasn't
[15:16] converted in the first place amen if he
[15:20] was truly converted then he's committed
[15:24] blasphemy against the holy spirit amen
[15:27] yes sir but there not really truly
[15:30] converted but if you claim to be
[15:31] converted then he commit in blasphemy
[15:33] against the holy spirit amen and then we
[15:36] see the reaction in their life but you
[15:38] you understand what's going on I hope
[15:41] you can understand there Paul told us
[15:44] there must be a falling away first you

[18:35] just it's not the whole church just a
[18:37] few of us here I might as well stay home
[18:39] myself and relax and have a good time
[18:42] you know you know what's the use of
[18:44] going up and everything else like that
[18:46] but you know don't judge by
[18:48] appearances right you don't judge by
[18:51] appearances let God have his holy way
[18:54] praise the Lord some of the best
[18:55] Services I've ever been in sometimes is
[18:58] been on two or three or five people turn
[19:00] up to church amen is that right I don't
[19:03] know about you but that's a fact and

[19:25] honored to be there
[19:27] Hallelujah let's cry and say oh it was
[19:30] only us that was there and some you
[19:32] don't understand that because God select
[19:35] you that you're just like with his
[19:37] disciples he had some he had 500 of them
[19:41] but he only allowed 12 to be close to
[19:43] him and then he only allowed three to be
[19:46] really close to him so God has his own
[19:50] processes why he does things amen so

[20:41] by the ministers using C order and doctr
[20:46] to bind the Saints and bind the actions
[20:49] and activities of how you should bee in
[20:53] the house of God Amen we realize that
[20:56] that was a trap and and Satan used it
[21:00] and made them take the very word of God
[21:03] like Satan did and said did God say so
[21:07] and so and he called scripture to her
[21:11] and had her wondering what in the world
[21:14] is going on Amen I said he used
[21:17] scripture to amen praise God hallelujah

[28:47] way only low class people scream like
[28:51] that only untrained people speaking

[29:16] and I'm speaking in TOS praise the Lord
[29:19] takes you to another level praise God
[29:21] forever more because then you're cut
[29:23] away from just your your mind just your
[29:25] your conscious mind and breaks you into
[29:27] the Supernatural by the grace of God
[29:30] praise the Lord brother and sister oh my
[29:33] if you sitting here today and you feel
[29:36] that you just don't have enough of a
[29:39] portion of the Holy Spirit then ask God
[29:42] to baptize you to overflowing amen amen
[29:49] amen baptize me to
[29:51] overflowing SP off me and touching the
[29:54] lives of for the glory of God lord
[29:58] praise God I was in the book store the
[30:01] other day I don't know what's going on
[30:03] but as I was there you know I like love
[30:05] to be book stores new books old books
[30:08] whatever but then you know two men
[30:11] approached me and says who are you who
[30:13] who are you uh I said oh I'm just a
[30:16] preacher you know like that you know he
[30:19] says well you're a preacher then you
[30:22] must be well versed in Theology and
[30:26] stuff like that you know I studed
[30:28] theology I went to this I go to this
[30:30] certain certain big church over there
[30:33] whatever like that but you know I saw
[30:35] just saw you here there's something
[30:37] about you I said I I got to come over
[30:39] and ask you like that and and then he
[30:41] started doing the wrong thing he started
[30:45] testing he started saying oh yes he said
[30:48] well so so what what what what do you
[30:51] believe about um you know original sin
[30:55] and and these kinds you know original
[30:58] sin and this what happened in the garden
[31:01] and whatever like that you know I said
[31:03] well you know um I I said you know what
[31:06] sin is in the first place I said you
[31:08] know sin came from Adam Adam
[31:10] representative man you know because of
[31:12] sin on Adam as our representative we all
[31:15] died and in Adam we all died in Christ
[31:18] We Are All Made Alive and they start
[31:19] talking to him about the three tenses of
[31:21] sin and so on started to talk like that
[31:24] to him and begin to just open I quot in
[31:28] because I didn't the Holy Spirit didn't
[31:30] make me start talking about Eve and all
[31:32] this stuff like that I just touch him on
[31:34] the realm where he is where he lives
[31:37] because he's coming from a theological
[31:39] point of view so I started talking along
[31:41] that way got into eternal security
[31:44] because he was saying you're talking
[31:46] about eternal security I said well
[31:48] that's the only thing that's in the
[31:49] Bible is eternal security because God
[31:51] set it PL he said a son a servant goes
[31:54] out but a son abides in the house
[31:56] forever you can't your own son once he's
[31:59] a genuine son I'm not talking about
[32:01] every Christian but a genuine son you
[32:02] can't kick him out he's got your blood
[32:05] in you even he might be a disobedient
[32:07] son might be a sinful son might be a
[32:09] rebellious son whatever you want to call
[32:11] it but he's still a son you can't get
[32:13] rid of him God's Eternal his sons are
[32:15] Eternal my goodness after a while he he
[32:18] just couldn't take he walk away you know
[32:21] he's like his
[32:23] head but I told him I said I said you
[32:26] asking me this thing but I said you
[32:28] approaching this from the theological
[32:30] point of view but I'm not hermeneutics
[32:32] apologetics and expositions and this
[32:35] kinds of stuff well how do you preach
[32:37] your sermons do you preach it in this
[32:40] way or I said well I know you're talking
[32:43] about being topical or expository or
[32:45] this or that or whatever or textually or
[32:48] whatever I said but I don't think about
[32:51] that when I come to speak I said even
[32:53] though I know and knew about all that
[32:56] stuff I don't even pay any mind
[32:58] I just say what God put in my mouth he
[33:01] said so then all you do is just speak
[33:02] the word I said yeah you said it right
[33:08] I praise the
[33:10] Lord Hall glory to God but something is
[33:14] going on brothers and sisters yes and I
[33:16] believe the holy spirit is fixing to
[33:19] another wave is about is rolling in amen
[33:24] you know how the waves of the sea come
[33:25] in and then they pull back after a while
[33:29] but then when you think it's all gone
[33:31] all of a sudden you see it's coming
[33:32] again amen praise God I believe it's
[33:34] coming again amen and I believe
[33:37] elah said I hear the sound of the
[33:40] abundance
[33:42] of Amen praise the Lord I believe it
[33:45] amen and I expect it I don't know what
[33:48] you expect but I expect it amen praise
[33:51] the Lord and that's why I Rejoice that
[33:54] I'm a part of what God is doing and that
[33:57] this thing this message has had a shake
[34:02] down and uh uh now just a little bit of
[34:07] grave is left in the bottom after to
[34:09] shake down but thank God I am one of
[34:12] those I'm part of it amen and the less
[34:15] it's get is the more valuable you become
[34:17] to God the less it gets you become more
[34:21] valuable praise the Lord and it just
[34:24] shows you that God shaking the whole
[34:26] thing down amen
[34:28] and looking at his beloved is redeemed
[34:31] and he's going to pour His Spirit out
[34:33] upon us even in a more Mighty powerful
[34:36] way some of you who been having ailment
[34:39] you will suddenly find that you're
[34:42] healed you're going to find that you're
[34:44] well because God has more work for you
[34:46] to do amen he's got to use you and he
[34:49] has got to use you with a healthy strong
[34:52] body I'm not saying everybody because
[34:55] sometimes God allows some people
[34:58] to he didn't make you sick but he will
[35:00] allow you to have affliction so that the
[35:03] sinner could look on and see how The
[35:06] Godly is able to suffer and not curse
[35:09] God you understand sometimes God allows
[35:13] it so that the S can look on and said my
[35:16] God that man is really a Christian with
[35:19] all the challenges he got with all the
[35:22] problems in God I never one day hear
[35:25] that man say anything against
