[30:31] though so easily be said us
[30:34] and let us run
[30:37] with patience the race that is set
[30:40] before us looking unto Jesus
[30:43] the author and finisher of our faith who
[30:47] for the joy that was set before him
[30:50] endure the cross
[30:53] despising the shame and is set down at
[30:57] the right hand of the Throne of God Amen
[31:00] thanks be to God God bless you please be
[31:03] seated
[31:05] foreign
[31:09] you know that Jesus uh the Bible says
[31:13] without a parable he spake not
[31:16] in other words
[31:18] Jesus's sermons all his everything he
[31:21] said it was done by speaking parables
[31:26] well what's the parable a powerless
[31:29] story
[31:30] he was a storyteller
[31:33] he loved to tell stories and like for
[31:37] instance still asked him Master what
[31:40] should we do then he'll start with the
[31:42] story The a certain man
[31:45] and then you tell that story and then
[31:49] he'll from that story he's going to draw
[31:51] lessons
[31:52] and that's what we're going to do
[31:54] tonight we're going to draw truths we're
[31:57] going to throw out guidelines we're
[31:59] going to draw lessons that God wants us
[32:02] to know out of the word praise the Lord
[32:05] amen so I'm going back to uh brother
[32:10] Branham
[32:12] speaking telling this story
[32:15] and it was about a young boy
[32:19] who entered into a contest
[32:23] and uh the contest he entered into it
[32:27] because he wanted to make his name
[32:29] famous he wanted to be of a great name
[32:32] and become famous and there it is that
[32:38] um in this race this race had rules and
[32:43] and the rules as you know in every race
[32:46] that you give out there has to be rules
[32:49] you just can't go run anywhere and then
[32:52] come back and say you have a prize or uh
[32:55] do something like that you've got to run
[32:57] within the rules
[33:00] and so they were given rules and one of
[33:04] them was
[33:05] that they they will speak a secret word
[33:10] into to this young man
[33:14] and he was to keep that secret word in
[33:18] his mind
[33:19] amen now he was to run the race
[33:24] and to the end of the race
[33:28] then uh they would ask him
[33:32] to speak that secret word again
[33:38] and then they will open a gate and he
[33:42] would be able to enter in to receive his
[33:46] prize and the honor that's due to him
[33:49] for winning the race
[33:52] and all that was made up one to see the
[33:57] IQ of the young person that was running
[34:01] that race if they really just memorized
[34:05] it or if they're really
[34:08] internalize it at it within them so they
[34:11] don't have to think about it when they
[34:13] get to the end of the race they just
[34:15] speak the word it's nothing to them
[34:17] because it's part of them right and so
[34:20] this young man
[34:22] went and took the race amen hallelujah
[34:27] now he said this little boy was very
[34:31] Swift
[34:33] and uh and he knew that he could not run
[34:37] the rest of these young boys but
[34:40] nevertheless
[34:41] he went out and he practiced every day
[34:46] he just practiced and practiced every
[34:49] day for running
[34:51] he did physical training
[34:54] because you know if you're going to run
[34:56] you've got to build your body up right
[34:59] uh and he did all the lifting of weights
[35:04] and the jumping and the running and
[35:06] everything else so that he could be
[35:08] physically fit
[35:10] like you used to be brother Bill
[35:15] amen and uh then he did a lot of uh
[35:20] breath training training his lungs
[35:24] training his breath how to Pace himself
[35:28] how to uh run and not lose his breath
[35:32] but but to run with a certain pacing so
[35:37] that he will keep his heart at a certain
[35:40] rate and he will be able to achieve the
[35:44] greatest amount of speed that he could
[35:48] get and as much oxygen as that he could
[35:52] take in at that time so he did all that
[35:57] but that was no
[35:58] that was the physical
[36:00] then he went and started learning
[36:04] various techniques
[36:06] of running
[36:08] uh and because running as techniques you
[36:13] don't just come off the road and jump in
[36:15] the Olympics and just run and think
[36:17] you're gonna win like that because they
[36:19] have techniques that they actually use
[36:21] and strategies that they actually put in
[36:25] place and if you know it they'll use it
[36:29] and they'll get ahead of you and they'll
[36:31] run away with the prize and so this boy
[36:35] dedicated himself
[36:37] to learning all of those rules and
[36:42] practicing every day and so with all the
[36:49] strategy he did that uh I want to quote
[36:53] brother Brandon said this boy studied
[36:56] that race from every angle
[37:00] that he could
[37:02] uh and his heart and mind was in it
[37:06] and he studied it from every angle that
[37:10] he could
[37:11] oh yes he practiced all the techniques
[37:17] of of uh the technique of starting from
[37:21] the starting blocks you know that you
[37:24] just don't start from the blocks like
[37:26] that you've got to practice how to get
[37:29] out like a lightning bolt out of those
[37:32] blocks you know it reminds me of uh when
[37:37] I did some racing as a young man and uh
[37:42] my wrist happened to be one of the first
[37:44] in the morning and it just so happens
[37:47] that in the West Indies we have a lot to
[37:50] do uh falling every night to do Falls
[37:54] and so and I didn't have spikes and all
[37:58] these things like the uh Runners have I
[38:02] just had a plain uh you know sneaker on
[38:05] right and so uh and everybody expected
[38:09] that I would win but when playing the
[38:12] gun go went like that at night
[38:14] my foot slipped on the grass
[38:17] and if you are running a hundred yards
[38:20] by time your foot slipped like that
[38:22] there halfway already down down the way
[38:26] and uh that was it I lost the race I
[38:30] won't tell you the rest of it it was
[38:31] very embarrassing
[38:34] well I thought I was so fast that I
[38:38] would take off after them catch up with
[38:40] them and pass them but that didn't
[38:42] happen I was left in the middle of the
[38:44] field with everybody looking at me and
[38:46] laughing while the other ones run ahead
[38:48] so that's the way it was because but you
[38:52] see I practice all the techniques
[38:56] um I practice all starting out to the
[38:59] starting blocks and then in the middle
[39:02] of the race how to pace yourself and not
[39:05] go on burn out before you get to the end
[39:08] so that you could as we say Drive the
[39:11] last drive you know come out pop and get
[39:14] to the end there and blast through that
[39:17] tip like that so uh that's the way it is
[39:21] and then you've got to know the
[39:24] technique of when you come to the end of
[39:26] the race
[39:28] how to kind of throw yourself forward so
[39:32] that at least your head would get past
[39:36] that line that ribbon and you would
[39:39] become to the winner your entire body
[39:41] didn't get past the ribbon but you have
[39:43] got past the ribbon and you would be
[39:45] counted as the winner and that's this
[39:49] boy studied every angle every possible
[39:53] way of being able to run this race and
[39:57] he was sure amen that he would be the
[40:03] winner right now
[40:05] in the morning
[40:08] that race started
[40:10] and there was more than 150 boys lined
[40:13] up see there they were
[40:17] oh and while they were waiting for the
[40:22] gun he remembered all of his training oh
[40:27] my and so he got ready
[40:30] got to the line
[40:32] and there it was he had studied him all
[40:36] the rules he was he making himself ready
[40:39] for this and then the gunfired and when
[40:44] it fired you were out of the blocks and
[40:46] they were away see oh my and the boys
[40:51] jumped forward and this little chap was
[40:54] so physically fit that he was out front
[40:57] of all of them and jumped way ahead of
[41:02] the rest of them and down the track he
[41:06] went with terrific speed all there he
[41:11] was terrific speed terrific form you
[41:15] know what form means oh he's pacing his
[41:18] the way he was running was so beautiful
[41:20] as he came down the track right and
[41:25] well-trained he outrun the other boys in
[41:29] the race and he was quite a long time
[41:35] there at the end before the rest of the
[41:40] other Runners ever caught up with him
[41:43] oh my so that means he was a good minute
[41:48] or so ahead
[41:50] and in a race this is that's a lot of
[41:53] time because the seconds matter of fact
[41:56] would be a good distance much less a
[41:58] whole minute that he was ahead amen
[42:03] but all of the physical training didn't
[42:07] help him
[42:09] because he had forgotten the password
[42:12] secret word that was whispered in his
[42:16] ears he forgot the secret word so he got
[42:20] there a minute ahead but the time was
[42:23] spent walking up and down in front of
[42:24] the gate walking up and down in front of
[42:27] the gate hoping that he would remember
[42:28] and all the other boys I can't say all
[42:32] but some of the other boys ran to the
[42:35] gate remember the password walked
[42:37] through the gate and went right in Fast
[42:39] and went right in through the gate and
[42:42] he was left there he had forgotten the
[42:46] secret word the password
[42:49] the very thing that he was to say
[42:54] to let him get inside of that gate he
[42:59] forgot it all oh money he searched and
[43:03] searched through his mind and yet he
[43:07] couldn't find it there oh think about it
[43:10] all the he had been so interested in his
[43:16] natural and physical
[43:19] conditioning of his body
[43:22] till he had forgotten the man saying he
[43:26] was there for so on the on Down the Line
[43:30] some other boys they ran too they didn't
[43:34] run so fast but they remembered the
[43:39] secret word they remember the mystery
[43:42] word they remember the password
[43:46] amen hallelujah oh praise God and they
[43:51] entered in now listen
[43:55] and so is it today do you believe that
[43:58] praise God because I'm sure while I'm
[44:01] talking you are making applications in
[44:03] your own heart and seeing where he is
[44:06] seemed to be going with this that this
[44:09] is what many churches many groups many
[44:13] Believers have got themselves caught up
[44:16] with of how they look while they're
[44:20] running
[44:21] they're so concerned about their
[44:24] appearance and and their numbers and
[44:27] their this and this that that they're
[44:30] not paying attention or to the very word
[44:35] that that you know that like this boy
[44:38] they just try to memorize it they
[44:40] memorize the word they they practice
[44:43] mental elasticity or uh intelligence and
[44:48] uh their intelligence and their
[44:50] abilities in that way amen but God
[44:53] didn't call US Virgin reflection God
[44:55] didn't call us for yoga God call us for
[44:59] the to be formed in the shape of Jesus
[45:03] Christ by the word of God be confirmed
[45:06] amen praise the Lord so here it was he
[45:10] had forgotten the very thing that he
[45:13] wants to say that what let him get
[45:17] inside of that gate
[45:19] oh my you see so interested till he had
[45:25] forgotten the main thing amen and so is
[45:29] it today
[45:30] that uh so many churches and people are
[45:34] interested one in their buildings
[45:38] this is an age where there are so
[45:42] interested in church buildings
[45:45] I believe after a while if we are
[45:48] allowed to be here and I'm not saying me
[45:50] I'm talking all of us are allowed to be
[45:52] here for a long time you're going to see
[45:56] that the true bride is not going to have
[45:59] any more Church buildings
[46:01] she's not because actually just quickly
[46:05] mention this to you do you know Jesus
[46:07] never built a church in his life
[46:10] do you know none of the Apostles ever
[46:12] built a church
[46:15] es only started building from the nician
[46:19] council
[46:20] it's when the emperor Constantine began
[46:25] to give them large
[46:27] chunks of money to build these big
[46:30] ornate things to honor the the gods and
[46:34] the god of Heaven amen you see and and
[46:37] how they twisted and all that but the
[46:40] fact there's no buildings were actually
[46:42] built before then they started that and
[46:45] then the the Protestants now uh you know
[46:49] they want to be like the other nations
[46:51] like Israel when they went away from God
[46:55] they wanted to be like the other nations
[46:58] so they started building buildings
[47:01] because Constantine or wanted to
[47:05] consolidate his kingdom so he started
[47:08] giving the Protestants money also so
[47:11] that there can be a counterbalance to
[47:13] the other side and you know he was he's
[47:16] a politician so that's what he did and
[47:19] that's how I'm just showing you or
[47:21] saying to you that's how buildings come
[47:23] and now it's normalized to until if a
[47:28] preacher goes out and preach and he
[47:31] doesn't have a building nobody respects
[47:33] him
[47:34] nobody wants to go oh where where's you
[47:37] where are you keep in church or under a
[47:40] tree up up uh up the road there they're
[47:43] not gonna go there
[47:45] oh where you can uh oh um there's a cave
[47:49] I found on the Mountainside uh we're
[47:53] keeping Church there they're not going
[47:55] to go but that's where the apostles and
[47:58] the Saints and them kept Church
[48:00] amen uh under Big Trees in in little
[48:05] grottos and place little valleys under
[48:09] uh you know in caves praise God well the
[48:13] bottom of homes the basements wherever
[48:16] they could find their worship God
[48:19] and it's right in the book of Acts the
[48:21] Bible says and they Worship the Lord
[48:23] doing what going from the house to house
[48:26] that's all they had they didn't have
[48:28] buildings they I know you might think
[48:30] this and someone might throw this and
[48:32] say but they have the synagogues yeah
[48:34] but that was only for a while they
[48:36] didn't want them whenever they go back
[48:38] to the synagogue they started that when
[48:40] it just came out Pentecost started they
[48:43] kept going back to the cinema but that
[48:45] what they were preaching they didn't
[48:47] want them they didn't want them at all
[48:50] they didn't even want them first they
[48:52] didn't want them in the church and then
[48:53] later on and they want them in the city
[48:55] because these are the people that
[48:57] troubling they're using them they're
[48:59] bringing trouble all kinds of things and
[49:02] we're trying to teach the three-headed
[49:04] gods of you know Jameson this one and
[49:08] Venus and Jupiter and they're coming and
[49:11] preaching about one God and Jesus Christ
[49:14] and so on so there it is
[49:18] that he this young boy forgot the
[49:22] password
[49:23] right completely and now we find the
[49:27] churches have forgotten the main person
[49:30] and thing about what they were supposed
[49:34] to teach preach and to spread and now
[49:38] their attraction is their big buildings
[49:43] are there great um uh digital modernized
[49:48] buildings impresses the people and
[49:52] they're caught by that all together
[49:54] right see he said now they are
[49:57] interested in building great shrines
[50:00] they are interested in building great
[50:03] churches they want to have great big
[50:07] buildings and so forth amen they're
[50:11] interested in changing the style and
[50:13] keeping that church looking trim trim
[50:17] see oh what fine buildings and on the
[50:21] inside they want to have just plush pews
[50:26] for the people you see they want to push
[50:30] pills there and they want the hype uh
[50:35] fine organs I would say instrument uh
[50:38] musical instruments they want to have a
[50:41] lot of fine musical instruments amen but
[50:45] that's what's actually going on right
[50:47] now he says and when we look at the
[50:51] ministers they are just like that
[50:54] little boy that young man they go into
[50:57] all the theological training
[51:01] they take all the mental training and
[51:04] techniques uh you know they go into how
[51:08] to how to properly run the church
[51:11] they're taught those they're actually
[51:13] taught those
[51:15] um those uh not it's not isms those
[51:19] allergies Theology and they're taught
[51:23] all these things in that way right so
[51:26] here it is that's done yet he said
[51:29] there's study and study until they're so
[51:33] well trained they have to be called
[51:35] doctor
[51:37] they have to be called d l t h d l l d
[51:42] degrees you see they have forgotten what
[51:46] they are really running for they forgot
[51:50] the world
[51:53] they forgot the secret world
[51:56] Hallelujah here he says they really
[52:00] forgot the key word that they should
[52:04] always have amen but praise God like the
[52:09] real sons and dusts of God to get in
[52:12] that wonderful gate they have got to
[52:16] have God's word in their heart
[52:19] not in your mind not in your head not
[52:22] not just memorize it or seek it or even
[52:25] be sincere even understand it even to be
[52:29] able to pass it or to be able to break
[52:32] it down press it and bring it to a place
[52:35] where you have all kinds of notes about
[52:38] it that's good but it's got to be in
[52:40] your heart
[52:41] and you've got to believe it you can't
[52:44] have a revelation of it because it's a
[52:48] secret word to you alone amen and with
[52:51] that in your heart you're not having to
[52:54] think about it try to remember it you
[52:57] get to that gate and you run right in
[53:00] praise God hallelujah amen because that
[53:04] word is part of you amen yes sir they
[53:09] forgot the key word now see because they
[53:14] got too busy
[53:16] I find even with the True Believer even
[53:19] with myself the devil has gotten a world
[53:22] in such a state that he just tries to
[53:25] keep you so that your mind can't stay on
[53:28] the world so he's got too distracted
[53:30] with this with that you got to do and
[53:32] you gotta do these natural things to be
[53:35] able to get on with life but still we
[53:37] recognize their distractions to the True
[53:39] Believer from the word of God Amen yes
[53:43] sir and so we've been so busy with other
[53:47] things
[53:48] they are so busy with church plans
[53:52] making churches
[53:55] and not only the individual or the
[53:59] building a church but he says they are
[54:02] planning of building big denominations
[54:06] churches churches churches and having a
[54:10] big denominations under their name till
[54:14] there let me repeat he says they forgot
[54:18] the key word
[54:20] Hallelujah now if we go back to the
[54:23] pyramid here look we go back to the
[54:26] pyramid or go back to the way that some
[54:29] bridges actually the Chinese uh build
[54:31] their bridges in that way when you're
[54:33] building art
[54:34] you know that was even before the Romans
[54:37] uh the accrediting the Romans was the
[54:40] Chinese thousands of years before the
[54:42] Romans you would build a bridge with a
[54:45] half circle
[54:46] and in the center would be a keystone
[54:51] in the shape of a pyramid and that would
[54:53] lock the rest of the stones that go up
[54:56] against it
[54:57] right that they they just stay there
[55:00] because they're held together by that
[55:03] Keystone if you pull the Keystone out
[55:05] there knock it out with a hammer
[55:07] everything will start falling apart so
[55:09] he's not just saying key word here he
[55:12] he's referencing that we could catch on
[55:16] and remember that God's word this
[55:19] Revelation that we have is the Keystone
[55:22] to the entire Bible
[55:25] it's the Keystone to your entire life
[55:28] it's the Keystone to a church amen and
[55:31] to an age the glory of God see the I
[55:35] think they forgot completely the key
[55:39] word amen see and that is what has
[55:43] happened that we are in here today
[55:46] praise God I don't need to expand on
[55:49] that you can think of it how many are
[55:51] going to colleges theologies this not
[55:54] the other not for Natural Life they're
[55:56] thinking in terms of they're going to be
[55:59] more spiritual they're gonna be deeper
[56:00] in the word they can be more knowledge
[56:02] who's this bill uh you know I am I'm
[56:06] Senor so so or or I'm Reverend this this
[56:09] that there's such degrees what is this
[56:12] boy coming along here by the name of
[56:14] coffee what's golden he go to what what
[56:16] did he attend we're we're licenses where
[56:20] is your diplomas they don't want to hear
[56:23] you see and when they don't want to hear
[56:26] that they don't recognize the voice of
[56:30] the Holy Spirit
[56:31] they don't recognize what God is doing
[56:34] God always hide behind skin veils he
[56:38] hide behind Badger skins God hides
[56:42] himself always in Simplicity and reveals
[56:45] himself in the same way Glory God
[56:48] hallelujah amen praise God you see
[56:53] preparation is good but we must remember
[56:57] the message
[57:00] listen
[57:01] he's bringing the thought but he's
[57:03] changing it now amen but you know
[57:06] recently we had how many knows we had
[57:09] hurricanes in Florida
[57:11] everybody knows that you're aware of it
[57:13] right we got uh because we have
[57:15] satellites and we got TV we we got to
[57:18] know music you know news like that uh
[57:21] you know you're gonna have to wait for
[57:22] months maybe a year before you hear
[57:24] something that happened in England or or
[57:26] France or Africa but now the militant
[57:30] happens is on CNN and the minute this
[57:32] happens is on Sky News or BBC or
[57:35] something but you're going to know that
[57:37] something happened within the world and
[57:41] we have the Earth this uh hurricane
[57:43] coming towards Florida and everybody in
[57:47] that area was warned
[57:50] and they were told to get out evacuate
[57:56] Evacuate the area don't stay because
[57:59] this is one of the worst storms we've
[58:01] ever had uh from what we can see in over
[58:05] a hundred years we've never seen
[58:07] anything like this so run for your life
[58:10] get out of the area
[58:12] and move out your house isn't worth the
[58:16] things
[58:17] you know can be replaced but your life
[58:20] is at risk now so you've got to go but
[58:23] some of the people said no we're not
[58:26] leaving because my business is here
[58:29] my my Mansion is here by the seashore
[58:34] it's so lovely to watch the sun setting
[58:38] uh while I'm sitting having my uh dinner
[58:42] or coffee or whatever it's beautiful in
[58:45] the morning to see the sunrise over the
[58:49] ocean I'm not leaving you know there's a
[58:51] lot more hurricanes pass through and I
[58:53] never did really anything you know and
[58:57] my house is safer you know how people
[58:59] were talking they never bothered they
[59:02] didn't listen the newscasters get up
[59:05] there and it's not like one day
[59:08] an alarm went off as your hurricane is
[59:11] coming no maybe a week week and a half
[59:15] two weeks before they're telling them a
[59:18] hurricane is bad prepare get out of the
[59:21] area evacuate and so on like that and
[59:25] and we will help the government even
[59:27] offer to help them get them out of the
[59:31] area and it would not come out well he's
[59:34] telling him of this
[59:36] and now
[59:38] they were told of this great storm
[59:42] coming
[59:44] one man that was a poultry raise or
[59:48] chickens and he went to his neighbor and
[59:51] warned him that the storm was coming
[59:54] but the neighbor just ignored him and
[59:58] says you're talking nonsense
[1:00:00] have you ever heard that before oh my
[1:00:04] you tell them that you've got look
[1:00:06] judgment is coming you tell them like
[1:00:10] Noah had to tell them rain is coming you
[1:00:14] tell them fires coming from the heavens
[1:00:16] Brimstone hallelujah it's coming they're
[1:00:19] gonna say you're mad you're out of your
[1:00:22] mind but that's before I came to service
[1:00:25] they sat there noticing a tremendous
[1:00:28] increase
[1:00:30] in mental problems in the public I'm not
[1:00:34] talking about the mental institution now
[1:00:36] it's the same amongst the ordinary
[1:00:38] people it's become so ordinary that more
[1:00:42] people than we think
[1:00:44] have mental problems
[1:00:47] well we ignore a prophet has spoken just
[1:00:51] said the Lord it shall come to pass that
[1:00:55] the whole world will go insane
[1:00:58] and the only sanity really will be with
[1:01:02] the true children of God who have the
[1:01:04] mind of Christ
[1:01:06] they didn't take the world mind or that
[1:01:09] that they took on the mind of Christ and
[1:01:13] the mind of Christ is to think about the
[1:01:16] word of God when the Bible says seek on
[1:01:19] these things amen not on the things of
[1:01:23] Earth but keep your mind on the things
[1:01:25] of Heaven amen praise the Lord he says
[1:01:28] the neighbor told them you're talking
[1:01:30] nonsense and he just kept on with what
[1:01:33] he's doing and so you see when about
[1:01:36] this business never made any
[1:01:38] arrangements and you see but the other
[1:01:42] neighbor didn't bother him anymore he
[1:01:46] just continued to make his Arrangements
[1:01:50] and to be ready amen but oh the one who
[1:01:55] did not take the warning all his
[1:01:58] chickens were Blown Away With the Wind
[1:02:01] see Amen in other words it might be that
[1:02:05] not to their chickens man may have some
[1:02:07] form of business right he's saying his
[1:02:10] business all destroyed because of that
[1:02:14] hurricane well it's not a hurricane now
[1:02:17] it's worse than that this is Judgment
[1:02:19] coming it's a tribulation coming this is
[1:02:22] the harness of Revelation 19 coming this
[1:02:26] is the world consulate church is coming
[1:02:28] this is the power of the of that evil
[1:02:32] woman spiritual Jezebel coming amen yes
[1:02:36] sir and you're one that is coming and
[1:02:39] it's going to happen because a prophet
[1:02:41] has spoken and not only a prophet he
[1:02:44] spoke what is already in here that it's
[1:02:47] all coming and nothing can stop it that
[1:02:49] the word of God must come to pass see
[1:02:52] amen and so it tore first of all it tore
[1:02:58] up his chickens and blowed them away
[1:03:02] and kill them everyone
[1:03:05] and not only that his house that he
[1:03:09] loved so much was torn down
[1:03:12] amen yes sir and he himself was was sent
[1:03:19] or taken to the hospital amen
[1:03:23] and there he was on the brink of death
[1:03:27] all because he did not give heat to the
[1:03:31] warning
[1:03:33] God helped the people in this hour
[1:03:35] for them not giving heed to the warning
[1:03:38] and more and more
[1:03:40] we are beginning I I can sense it we're
[1:03:45] beginning to sound like something is
[1:03:47] wrong with us
[1:03:49] like
[1:03:51] um
[1:03:52] what's wrong with him what's wrong with
[1:03:55] her don't they know what age we're
[1:03:57] living in but we're not going by ages
[1:04:00] and times and this and that the word of
[1:04:02] God is unchanging
[1:04:04] and it's the same what it was and it's
[1:04:08] going to be it will remain the same amen
[1:04:10] see and so he failed to take heed to the
[1:04:16] warning then he repeats you see the
[1:04:20] message was already given
[1:04:23] but he would not take the message
[1:04:26] he failed to take heed to the message
[1:04:31] that was given to him and there's a lot
[1:04:33] of people today are not taking heed to
[1:04:36] the message of Malachi 4 5 Revelation 10
[1:04:40] 7. there's not taken into the message
[1:04:42] they think it's another Preacher Brother
[1:04:45] Branham just happened to be one that's a
[1:04:47] little more gifted like that and that's
[1:04:50] the way they're looking at it see but
[1:04:54] that's the same way it is today many of
[1:04:57] our people many of our churches we know
[1:05:01] what the Bible teaches they know what
[1:05:04] the Bible says and yet they don't heed
[1:05:08] the message but we heed it amen that
[1:05:12] Jesus said he that believeth in me
[1:05:15] though the words I do he shall do also

[1:05:23] we are not interested in other things
[1:05:25] amen God praise God we are not listening
[1:05:30] to other things but we want to take heed
[1:05:33] to the secret word to the message of
[1:05:36] this hour given to us by this prophet
[1:05:39] and we have to run amen I believe it we
[1:05:43] have to run praise God Amen but o praise

[1:05:57] but didn't know what they were going to
[1:06:00] say when they got there right that's the
