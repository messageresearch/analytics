the house of the Lord this morning amen it's good to be here it's good to be in God's presence um we're so excited this morning about the word of God and um we're just uh excited how the Lord is um going to continue along the um the thought that we've been ministering on regarding God doing a new thing I believe there might be just one more service after today's but we'll see what the Lord has for us amen praise God in the meantime we're grateful to be here I'm grateful that the Lord has restored my health I'm feeling much stronger by the grace of God those colds you know they only hit me very you know maybe once a year that's about it and it just lasts a few days but uh this one kind of stuck around my throat for a little while and of course we know you know the enem is going to attack wherever he can to try and get us to uh stop talking about him but he ain't going to stop us there ain't a chance anywhere anyhow that he can stop what he has started in our lives amen praise God and so um Pastor Simon's on his way back um we Comm communicated uh later earlier in the week and uh they were having a wonderful time they're very grateful for the rest that they're having and they're looking forward to um being back with us um by the grace of God Amen so um just a few things before we get to the word um the the roof repair is going to be starting this week by God's grace they're going to be starting here on Wednesday and um hopefully by next Sunday everything will be completed and it'll all be done and that'll be something that we can be very grateful for and um to to know that the Lord has taken care of that also you may have noticed that we've got a new sign uh on the front there um we decided that temporarily we would uh you know restore our sign make it um nice and fresh you know and legible again and so we we put uh you know writing on both sides and you'll notice that when you come in you'll see the sign and it's going to say say and it does say we're glad you're here we're glad you're here we're glad you joined us amen praise God and I know that you'll be glad that you came amen amen because it's always good to come into the presence of the Lord and to enjoy what he has for us amen so without any further Ado let's just pray and then we will go to the word father we are so grateful this morning Lord to be assembled to be in this atmosphere of Liberty father where your spirit just gives us uh Lord freedom to um yield ourselves and to accept and receive what you have for us father Lord I pray that you will speak to every need this morning Lord you can you're the only one that can do that in such a way that Lord when when you do it it's different from anybody else father it just burns within our hearts it gives us such Joy To Know that you are a a living Supernatural God that knows the needs of your children and that you can speak to us lip to ear it's what makes the Supernatural come in the mystery of preaching Lord and and this is what excites us this is why we we've been called and why we've been uh so excited to assemble ourselves every opportunity that we have Lord won't you pour out today Lord and bless your people Lord anoint the speaker anoint the hearers oh god let's leave here today Lord rejoicing father Lord you know every need Lord if there's any sickness in our midst Lord let them be touched through the word as it goes forth Lord if there's any uh broken hearts let them be healed father and if there's any that need to be enlightened to your word for this hour then let it be done in Jesus name we pray amen and amen praise God glory to God so let's get started um let's go to the first slide amen So today we're going to continue um we're we're in a uh I am doing a new thing series um today we're going to we're going to go to all things good with God part three last uh time we ministered we looked at um you know how all things are good with God and we looked at how God is um you know giving us the revelation of this hour to recognize the season that we're living in and how you know you can belong to a church but if you don't have an understanding of the day that you're living in then you're you're living under what um Can can be described as cognitive dissonance amen where you you know you're you're so locked into your own thoughts your own ways your own ideas um your own teachings that you you regret and you don't allow truth to actually penetrate you to so that you can be released and set free and properly positioned as a son or a daughter of God where God actually wants you amen and so um we're g to we're going to read the scripture from um Hebrews or sorry Romans chapter 8 and then we're g to um we're going to listen to our favorite song it says Romans 8:28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose amen praise God so go ahead let's let's play that song Stay standing sing with it I know you know the song by now you know if not the words are going to be up there you know um as we're you know ministering today I want that song to be going through your mind because you're going to see how um you know how good God is and how it is that he's working out everything in our lives amen praise God give us some volume give us some good volume some good base amen praise God let's get into the song Let's get into the [Music] atmosphere little more sing it all things work together for good we know that for those who love God all things work together for those who were called according to his purpose for those who are called according to his Pur w we know [Music] wo we know w we know all things all things work together for [Music] good all right here we go we know that those who love God all things work together for good we know that for those who love God all things work together for good with those who are called according to his [Music] purpose those who are called according to his purpose we know w we know [Music] w we know all things all things work together [Music] [Applause] for w we know wo we know w we know all things all things work together for good hey all right here's where it's found Romans [Music] 8 [Music] 28 hey amen praise God okay we're going to read a scripture and then we're going to have you sit down let's put up our first scripture amen Genesis 37 verses 5-9 today we're going to be looking at Joseph we're going to be looking at his life we're going to be looking at his character we're going to be looking at at his responses to the challenges that he came across and we know that this is one story that that that certainly gives and shows a tremendous amount of God's you know purpose and plan for his life and as we're looking at these scriptures and as we're looking at Joseph I want you to see yourself amen praise God it says here uh 37: 5-9 and Joseph dreamed a dream and he told it his Brethren and they hated him yet the more and he said unto them here I pray you this dream which I have dreamed for behold we were binding sheep in the field and low my sheep arose and also I stood upright and behold your sheaves stood round about and made abstinence to my sheath and his Brethren said to him shalt thou indeed Reign Over Us or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us and they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words amen you may be seated listen to brother brandham here in a quote in 1956 Joseph meeting his brother and brother Bram says now Joseph was born of his father and was loved of his father and hated of his Brethren now notice notice a perfect picture of the Lord Jesus I want you to notice how his life just typed in the Old Testament everything typed now look back there and see the picture oh I just had something happen here on my computer excuse me one second these things come up on the computer and then if you hit the wrong button I what I should do is I got to disconnect from the internet because something came up and I touched it and it shut down my page praise God and I have it all here okay here we go and so he says here he says look back there and see the picture there is the Shadow and you see what the positive is now notice Joseph being a type of Christ a type of the church a type of the Holy Spirit type he was a prince of prosperity just as Christ is just as the church today notice again that when he was born his father loved him and he made him a coat of many colors now there are only seven perfect colors in the colors all others are made off of these colors and the coat perhaps had colors in it of seven different colors Stripes of colors into the coat that the father made if you notice maybe Jacob didn't understand that at the time that signified promised one when God gave Noah the rainbow sign the seven colors it was the promise or a covenant one God had made a covenant that he would that that he would destroy the world no more with water and God's covenant was also carried over through Jacob into Joseph Abraham was election and Isaac was justification and justification and Israel was Grace and Joseph was Perfection that was the only one that had the color we see Jesus sitting upon the throne with the colors rainbow around him in Revelations 1 it was God's covenant with the people Christ here it is oh how I want you to see it Christ is God's covenant with his people not denominations but Christ is God's covenant as Joseph was hated and we know he was hated by his brothers so Christ will be hated when his word comes to the people amen and so here we can see that Joseph you know Joseph didn't try to have dreams okay when we're looking at all of this we want to see how you know everything types Jesus Christ all right and the and you've seen you know from the from the uh the quote that it doesn't only type Christ but it also types the church okay and so everything that we're talking about about here is talking about Christ and you because we are Christ made manifest in this day and in this hour bringing the word to the people bringing the word to the world right now okay and so here Joseph he didn't try to have dreams he just he just received the dreams you didn't try to receive Revelation because that's what dreams are when when God God wants to give Revelation he can give it in the night time or he can give it to you plain straight to your heart he can reveal things in your life that you never thought was even possible you didn't try to you know put on this Revelation that God has given you you didn't try to you know uh just pretend that you knew Jesus Christ no no when the Revelation came it became a reality and when it became a reality in your life and you started to express it in your life you start to notice that the world around you starts to change it doesn't really want to accept that Supernatural element that wait a minute you mean you know something that I don't know you mean all of a sudden you know more about God than I do that's what his brothers were were were trying to say they they they they heard the dream they heard the interpretation and you saw the way they responded what you mean you're going to be over over us you mean we're going to bow to you no this is all part of God's plan this was all part of God's showing and we're going to be looking at all of this to see that God has a great plan for the world Amen and Jesus Christ is the focal plan for the world it's not any other religion it is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen so he didn't he didn't choose his election go to the next slide what we're looking at here okay in um Genesis 37 9-11 he goes on he says and he dreamed yet another dream now this is the second dream and told it his Brethren and said behold I have dreamed the dream more and behold the Sun and the Moon and the 11 stars made abstinence to me and he told it to his father and to his Brethren and his father rebuked him imagine that his own family his father that that that Joseph was his favorite you see but but then you got to see that there's the human part and you got to see that there's election amen and he told it to his father and his and his brother his father rebuked him and said unto him what is this dream that thou has dreamed shall I and thy mother and thy Brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the Earth and his brother his Brethren eny envied him but his father observed the same next slide we're going to be looking here at Joseph's election election is not something that that that you know we choose no you know we decide to elect ourselves we don't elect ourselves to be a part of God's economy all right you know this whole plan of redemption once we you know once our our our understanding was opened and and we began to recognize what it was that that Christianity was all about we came to realize that it takes God to to call you personally amen this is an election that goes beyond human understanding okay we read in the scriptures that we were called from before the foundations of the world it's not something that that we decided to join this church I did not decide to join this ministry it was God that decided that it was time for me time for you wherever you are at the certain time in your life God decided that it was time for you to be placed as a son and daughter of God Amen to be placed in the body of Christ so that he could manifest his word and show the world that he had a plan amen praise God glory to God and so this election is of god it's not our choosing Joseph never chose Jacob heard the dream his brothers heard the dream they didn't like it but yet it was God's purpose it was God's plan God was starting to show something that he was going to do and in that dream is all of Joseph's experiences wound up into that dream that eventually his brothers and his father and all of of of the all of Canaan all the people would come to know that Joseph was a perfect type of Jesus Christ amen the Lord had a Plan of Salvation so to understand what is happening and get the bigger picture we're going to need to reflect on Joseph's life that's what we're going to do today reflect on his life and at the same time I want you to to to just you know sit back relax and see where you fit into all of this amen praise praise God and here in uh in his wonders to perform brother Bram says and little did maybe Joseph know that all this was just about to happen you know Joseph didn't understand those dreams fully all he knew is that he had these dreams and they were real to him but little did he know Joseph that all this was just about to happen but we don't have to know everything no that's the thing we just believe by faith and walk on God God doesn't doesn't have to tell us all his plans amen God doesn't have to tell you exactly where you're you're going to end up you know but but God is uh you know just letting you see enough so that when you go through certain situations and through certain Temptations and certain trials that there's going to be something in you that's going to rise up he's just giving you enough to know that it's going to work for good amen and so he doesn't have to give it just how he's going to make the Morning Star shine in the morning just just move on anyhow God takes care of his own and when you're prayed for being sick you don't have to worry about just how God's going to move that cancer how God's going to make that crippled limb to come straight just go forward in faith that's up to God to take care of that you don't have to worry whether whether you'll keep your job if you accept Christ as your savior you don't have to worry whether the boss will be angry or your neighbor will turn on you down or your mother will say that you're you've lost your mind or your dad turn you away from home just go forward God will take care of the rest of it when we look at Joseph he's one of the most inspiring characters in the whole whole scriptures unlike his often earing father Jacob you know we all know the story about Jacob and how you know Jacob was you know he was a deceiver all he was interested in was the was the birthright amen but Jacob but Joseph um you know Joseph his his his character is a lot different he was one of the few people who were able to maintain his spiritual Poise at a peak of success as well as is in the midst of all the trouble that he went through even though his tremendous uh abilities his patience it all reflected through tribulation that he was faithful in Fame and success and in for and and even in a forgiving spirit amen all tributes to his character he displayed a character no matter what he was going through he showed that something was real in his heart and all that we go through in in life and all the situations that we have to deal with in day in and day out there's something inside of us that's going to rise up and show the character of Christ amen praise God it's because he knew God Amen his faithfulness in Fame his faithfulness in forgiving and all the attributes of his character what stands out above all else is his conviction that God had a specific purpose in his life he didn't fully understand it but he knew that that that had to be God because every time that he would face the worst situations he would he would just say God has a purpose in this amen he moved forward in a quiet conviction that his life was not merely a succession of coincidences but it was actually being directed by the power of of God and we can look at our own lives and know that listen the direction that we're moving in this is a god directed Life once you've been born again once you've received the spirit of God once you've recognized that God is a reality you're no longer living your own life the way that you did before you start to realize that your life is being orchestrated by the power of God amen amen praise God Joseph from a young age he believed God had a Destiny for him for his greatness in dreams God assured Joseph that he would rise to a position of leadership over his brothers and even over his parents it was revealed to him but he kept it all within him from Joseph's point of view these dreams were evidence of divine blessing listen when God allows you to recognize his word recognize that he sent a prophet recognize what he's doing in your day you need to realize that this is a tremendous blessing in your life amen this is something that goes beyond what you could have possibly put together or figured out amen praise God Jo Joseph enjoyed the fact that this was something that was revealed to him in his heart and it kept him uh so when we look at um you know Hebrews 1 and two it says hath in these last days spoken to us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds we need to realize that God is speaking directly to you lip to ear now at this stage in your walk you've got the ability to walk with God personally amen he's chosen now that that he's going to speak to us through the word of God through his son amen and and uh it it is true that God spoke through dreams like he spoke to to Joseph and to some people in the past but even then it was a rare or occurrence okay it's not often but but watch he says here in 1 John 4 veres 1 to 4 we need to realize that it's not just dreams we need to be careful of dreams we need to be careful of the occult we need to be careful of you know watching all these YouTube videos that try to give interpretations on the word of God and try to give interpretations of the end time and all of these different things because there's Spirits behind those things okay we need to realize that that that dreams can be given but yet we need to run them through the word of God and and in 1 John chapter 4 it says beloved beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of God every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God now we're now we're not putting this in the day when Jesus walked on the earth we're putting this into our day Jesus Christ is now in human flesh you believe that amen he said on that day you shall know that I am in the father ye in me and I in you so we need to realize the presence of God in this day and in this hour so that we can filter things only by the word of God only through the revealed word for this day and this hour and so if if if you tell somebody about the reality of God you know your experience well what makes you different from anybody else what makes you different from other Christians out there What Makes You Different is that you've actually come into contact with Christ himself he's walking and talking and living and moving in your life amen and you've recognized that and that is the evidence that the spirit of God is in you but when somebody rejects that that is not the spirit of God and watch and come in the flesh is so so uh and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God and this is that Spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world Amen praise God so Paul is giving us an excellent guideline on how to orient our thinking we need to we need to make sure that we're not too focused on you know too many interpretations of you know that that are being put out there in the world you can spend hours and hours just listening to different interpretations on God's word God's word is of no private interpr ration you want to know what the word says read the word if you don't understand it pray get on your knees and pray that the Lord will give you a revelation of the word amen praise God in Philippians 4 verse 8 Paul says to us finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are noble whatsoever things are just whatever things are pure whatever things are lovely whatever things are of good report if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy meditate on those things so in other words focus on the word meditate on the word amen praise God let's go on now next scripture Genesis 37 we're going to move along here it says and it came to pass when Joseph was come unto his Brethren that they stripped Joseph out of his coat his coat of many colors that was on him and they took him and cast him into a pit and the pit was empty there was no water in it and they sat down to eat bread and they lifted up their eyes and looked and behold a company of ishmaelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and bomb and myrr going to carry it down to Egypt and Judah said unto his Brethren what profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood Come and Let Us sell him to the ishmaelites and let us not and and let not our hand be upon him for he is our brother and our flesh and his Brethren were content then their passed by midianite merchantmen and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit and sold Joseph to the Israelites for 20 pieces of silver and they brought Joseph into Egypt next slide here we're looking at Joseph's rejection you know uh he was just imagine his own family his brothers those that he grew up with but he all he always knew that there was something different about him he always knew that you know that that he was not like them but these brothers were so wicked that they took him and they actually threw him into to a pit you know that's why these days you hear oh man that's the pits you know because sometimes we come into situations and times in our lives where you know things are just not working out things just aren't working out good everything is just looking like it's all bad amen but things don't stay all bad you see God has a purpose and a plan for those times when things go bad you might find yourself in a dry place he was in a pit there was it said clearly there was not even any water there he couldn't even quench his thirst they had they they were thinking they were just going to leave him in that pit and he would just stay there and he would just die there of starvation and of lack of water and sometimes you might find yourself in a situation where it's just dry nothing is happening nothing is real to you as much as you know as much as you want to to be Ze and as much as you want you know to to do good you you find yourself in a terrible situation it's an ugly time it's a terrible time but I want you to know that though God had placed Joseph in that pit it was because God had a plan for Joseph God inspired uh Judah to not kill their brother right there and then why because God had a plan for Joseph God has a plan for your life you can look back on times and situations where things didn't appear good but God allowed you to stay in a pit for a little while but then he's got a plan to bring you out of the pit amen praise God they took him and they threw him into the pit we aren't told the kind of pit that it is but it's a sister cut into the Rock to gather water it it you know it's a bottle shaped a narrow necked pit once you're down there you can't get out unless somebody brings you out amen the pit was empty there was no water in it praise God the bad news is that he will die of thirst after a few days and a truly miserable way to die that's you know something that you know that their brothers thought maybe they would have in mind but then all of a sudden inspiration strikes one of the brothers let's sell them let's make some money I want you to see here this is all a type of Jesus Christ all a type of what God was doing and showing in the life of Joseph with their brothers stripped and imprisoned uh in the sistern they they callously sat down and ate food can you imagine the kind of hatred that these brothers had that they could throw their brother into a pit and then they could go sit down and have a meal I'll tell you the devil some sometimes just rejoices when you're down he thinks oh boy I got him now I'm going to go and have a feast because I got him out of the way he got him down in sickness I got him fighting sickness over and over and over again it's he's going to stay down he ain't going to stay down not if the spirit of God is in there amen he's going to get right back up again because something is going to Quicken him out of the pit praise God hallelujah but the devil he can't he can't keep you anywhere so here now I want you to see the timing on all this now I want you like you know when you get a chance go back and read Genesis 37 um read you know actually start right from the story where Joseph you know starts his dreams there in chapter 37 and read all the way through right through to chapter 50 you're going to see events and circumstances that took place you know there was one thing when Joseph Joseph was asked by his father to go and find his brothers to go and check on them he went to a certain place he went to sheam because that's where the father thought that they actually were but while he went there do you know that Joseph met somebody they don't give his name they don't say who it was but that individual overheard the brothers talking and heard them say that we're going to dotham and so that individual was placed there for a purpose amen you see God knew that that that that Joseph had to go to dotham God knew that Joseph was going to go into the pit God knew exactly everything that Joseph would have to deal with and all the circumstances so so we need to see that God is the one that's orchestrating all of this amen praise God and so um they drew uh Joseph out of the pit and they sold Joseph to the Israelites because God needed Joseph where in Egypt you know sometimes things happen in your lives sometimes you get a certain job you get something that that comes your way and you're wondering you know or maybe your parents decided that they had to move to a certain city and they left this city to come to that City and you wonder boy if I hadn't to come to that City I would have never met that individual if I hadn't been at the time in my life where I was actually looking to buy furniture I would have never met brother Gabriel you see but God had a plan in each and every one of our lives and he orchestrated in such Perfection that we could not miss this that we are now experiencing you are not a Christian by coincidence you are not somebody that's a part of this ministry by coincidence God had orchestrated and purposely planned all of your footsteps amen all we see in the last verse of the chapter that we just read is that Joseph was sold into Egypt and he was sold as a slave unto pontier let's go to the next scripture today is just a simple review and and look at Joseph's life amen in Genesis 39: 1-4 it says and Joseph was brought down to Egypt and pontier an officer of pharaoh captain of the Guard an Egyptian brought him of the hands of the ishmaelites which had brought him down tither and the Lord was with Joseph I want you to notice that the Lord was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian and his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made all that that he did to prosper in his hand and Joseph found Grace in his sight and he served him and he made him overseer over his house and all he had he put into Joseph's hands glory to God listen Joseph would never have been enslaved in Egypt he never would have faced a Temptation posed by pontier wife he never would have been thrown in prison so so so would never have met Pharaoh's Baker and cup Bearer he never would have had the opportunity to interpret Pharaoh's dreams and as a result rise to the highest position in the Egyptian government save that of pharaoh himself he never would have rescued the Egyptians from famine and so gained virtually unquestioned Authority in the kingdom and consequently he never would have been in a position both to save his family from starvation and more important still save them from the sins that had overspread their life as sons and brothers without this history there never would have been an exodus from Egypt the defying Redemptive Act of Israel's history and the precursor of the atonement of Jesus Christ the son of God everything was being expressed I want you to see how all of these things would have never happened had he not been hated by his brothers none of this would have happened could have happened if Joseph had gone straight to dotham and hadn't lost time looking for his brothers near sheam and if he hadn't happened upon that stranger when he did a man who knew where the brothers could be found because he happened to have overheard them talking he happened to be in the exact place to have heard them say let us go to dotham listen everything was not a coincidence everything was ordained of God Amen everything was in the plan of God our lives are under Divine Providence of God thanes Amen whether we realize it or not our lives are exactly where God wants us right now amen you didn't you didn't by accident join this ministry it's because God wants you to be a part of this ministry thank you Jesus you're not in this church because oh I decided because it's it's close by to where I live we've got a lot of people here that have to drive half an hour 45 minutes even up to an hour to get here amen this is Divine Providence this is God's grace this is God's calling in our lives amen praise God in Ephesians chapter 1 Paul's Paul tells us in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will it's God's will for you to be here it's God's will for you to get delivered it's God's will for you to hear the word this morning one one one sentence one one word something that will encourage you something that will lift you out of the situation the condition that you might be in you might find yourself in a condition where you're you're still in that pit you're still wondering what's going on in my life why why is this not working out why is this happened why is that happened don't worry you're under God's Providence you're under his Sovereign leadership you're under his Sovereign guidance you didn't come by accident God has a plan and he's going to show that plan to your life amen God is not doing isolated things I want you to know that God works every single detail so that it can work for your good good amen hallelujah you know sometimes we look at isolated incidents in the world he's not doing uh isolated incidents in the world or doing things that are utterly disconnected from one another he is working out a marvelous unified perfect plan that is going to bring together his gracious purpose in our lives amen and when we often we often you know we we wonder well why me why why am I in this this situation well you're just one of the parts of the jigsaw puzzle and maybe you're part of the puzzle hasn't been placed yet maybe you're wondering why is this why is that well maybe you just need to be still and let God positionally place you in the in the perfect plan that he has for your life under this ministry amen praise God oh God you know sometimes we cry out what are you doing Lord we don't understand the things that you you know that that we have to you know sometimes we just we we demand to know why these things are happening in our lives we demand to know his will you don't demand God you you surrender to God Amen you surrender to his will when the more important question should be why is this happening right now that's what's more important God's timing is always perfect am God doesn't do things out of cater he does things in a perfect time you know we were talking about that yesterday when you know brother Alvin and I were putting up that new sign and you know how how the Lord just worked it all out you know I said to Alvin I said you know brother Alvin look at this beautiful day God gave us this day today we're able to paint you know because the paint will dry in this weather with the sun and everything else you know I told them I said I actually went to go pick up the sign on Tuesday you know with the intention to come here and maybe do it on Wednesday and you know he had told me that it was going to be ready on Tuesday and so I thought okay I'll just drive by and when I went there the sign wasn't ready he says oh I'm sorry you know I couldn't get it done he says but I should have it done by tomorrow you know tomorrow afternoon sometime I said that's fine that's no problem just just send me a a message when it's ready and we'll come and grab it and so it all worked out perfectly fine I ended up going by on Thursday afternoon and there it was it was all ready to go and then I text right away and brother Alvin within a minute said I'm I'm available tomorrow to do it I looked at the weather I said praise God look at how this is all coming together you see God has timing I want you to know God has timing I know I'm giving you a simple example of God's timing but let me tell you there's things that are coming into your life and I want you to be still and know that in God's time it's going to be beautiful it's going to end up just beautiful when when Alvin and I got done we sat back and we looked at it we said man this is beautiful Hallelujah it looks fantastic and all we could do was say thank you Lord amen praise God you know when God wants to do things he just does it in his time and under his inspiration and you know if if we just surrender to God and just allow him to take control you will see wonders that he will perform in your life amen so the question should be more you know um uh but but what is his timing wait on the Lord and it's clear one of the great lessons that Joseph himself was learning in those days was precisely that to wait on the Lord you know you know we're just going to see certain characteristics of of Joseph here you know and so this is for Joseph and for us too a summons to Bow ourselves before his sovereignty to surrender to God's sovereignty in our lives amen you know his Sovereign will and say use me when you you know when and where and how you want to use me Lord you know are you are you willing to surrender yourself in that way amen you know God's looking for for us to to to build this ministry to move it forward for his glory to reach the lost you know know to to to reach those last few wherever they are I believe God is you know moving us into a public display of his word listen it's not a coincidence that Joseph is 30 years old when he actually gets placed next to Pharaoh he was 17 years old when he got sold into Egypt and it wasn't until 13 years later that he is sitting at the right hand of pharaoh it's not a coincidence it was is it was God's perfect timing do you know that Jesus Christ public Ministry started when he was 30 do you know that Jesus Christ was sold by his brothers for 30 pieces of silver do you know Joseph was sold by his brothers for 20 pieces of silver you know I was I was looking you know sometimes you see certain things and you know when when I was studying and I came across this little thing on on you know Joseph's life and Joseph's timing and how God's timing is perfect and how God typed everything in Joseph right but then the one thing that didn't match was 20 pieces of silver for Joseph and 30 pieces of silver for Jesus Christ and this individual you know he just brought it out and he's he's he's looking at all the timing he says and listen you got to take everything with a grain of salt but some things they kind of Step you know out of the out of the page right when you're reading it and he says he believes that Jesus Christ is going to come in [Laughter] 2030 and I said you know that's pretty good that's pretty good you know and then all the timelines and and and the 2,000 years and Jesus Christ you know ad30 right well you take 2,000 years from ad30 and where do you end up 2030 listen I'm not saying that he's wrong I'm not putting my life on it I'm not going to say that's what it is praise God hallelujah no I'm not saying that okay but I am saying that we're really close to some significant events the thing that they haven't recognized is that Jesus Christ is already here we're not looking for his coming we have recognized that he's already here amen we are those that are looking looking for our going we're looking for the Rapture we're looking for the quickening power which is Jesus Christ in us right now that's quicking quickening us by his word to take a dimensional change to go for that meeting in the air you see Jesus Christ has already come he's here in the midst of of the people just in the same way that they could not recognize Jesus Christ when he was on Earth he's the same yesterday today and forever brother Phillip they're not going to recognize him when he's here that's why when you tell them about the word when you tell them look at the scripture that's the spirit of God in you speaking going back to the word just like Jesus when he stood there and he opened the Scrolls and he said this day this scripture in Isaiah has been fulfilled they couldn't they what what are you talking about right away they wanted to crucify and blasphemy he's making himself God now listen we're not making ourselves God but God said on that day ye shall know that I am in the father ye in me and I in you that's what he said and so if we believe that then we recognize we know and we we we we we we see that the spirit of God is actually living within us amen praise God and this is something that they just cannot comprehend no they don't realize Jesus Christ is here now now preparing a people calling one here snatching one there this one but how is it that that he's doing it by divine revelation there's no other way that you're going to come to Christ you you can't be a part of God's Church Christ Church unless you come by the spiritual Revelation which is the rock that he said he would build his church not on Peter Peter could not possibly have been the rock that the church was built upon no even though the word Peter means rock that doesn't Peter he denied Jesus Christ after that three times and cursed imagine and God's going to build his church upon a person no sir he's he didn't even build it upon himself he built it upon divine revelation that he would reveal to you that you are a part of him that you are an Express attribute that was in God from before the foundations of the world and that you went into a spiritual Amnesia and you needed to come out of that Amnesia by the by the hearing of the word of God in your day and in your hour God has a timing for all things amen glory to God and we know God's timing is perfect and so we know here as we go on and we read the scripture Joseph was placed into pontier house and the scripture says you'll read it when you go and take some time to read it that pontier did not have to worry about absolutely anything he placed everything into Joseph's hands to the point where the the scripture says that all he had to worry about was what he ate imagine that imagine that you know here pontier had the spirit of God God in an individual living in his house and his house prospered I want you to know something everything that God has typed in Joseph was in Christ and everything that was in Christ he poured into the church he's poured that Prosperity into your life everything that you once you come under that Divine understanding that Revelation that you are in Christ Jesus you you are you are now you are now uh subject to all that God poured into Christ is now poured to you all the prosperity all the things that you would that you would pray for all that you would touch now now this is you got to take this into the proper context because you need to understand who you really are you're not making we're not better than anybody it's Christ in us that gives us this this this Spirit of prosperity around our lives we need to understand that it's Christ it's not you it's not me but it's you believing that it is Christ in you and that's what brings that that all those spiritual blessings into your life and here Joseph he knew that God was was was absolutely sovereignly in control of his life and here comes pontier wife to tempt him like you like you know like how Satan tempts all men yeah right he'll tempt you know you got to watch it young men and you young ladies too you know the enemy is going to test you to see if you know if if you know because maybe you you find an opportunity where where it can happen you got to watch Satan will try to set you up the the scripture said that all the servants were not in the house at that time why because Satan was setting Joseph up but God was allowing the setup God God knew that there was going to be a setup God knew that Joseph would be able to stand against the temptation but the enemy is a liar God is going to put lies on your life uh Satan is going to put God lies on your life Satan is going to tell people that you're this you're that and and that you're a fanatic amen he's going to try to make you you know uh something different and you know oh well he's a fanatic about Jesus I'm a fanatic about Jesus yes I am why because he's the one and only true Living God amen amen if I'm going to put my trust in something I'm going to put it in the absolute and Jesus Christ is the absolute praise God but Joseph he had something in him he had the spirit of God even pontier noticed that that Joseph had the spirit of God in his life and and and Joseph being tested the way that he was tested she tried to pull him to sleep with him and he said and I want you to notice what he said when you go back and you read this you're going to get a lot more I'm just laying in some of the thoughts that God you know blessed me with as I was studying all this he said he said can I sin against God he knew that his his his master had given him all the authority he says he's given me everything all rule over the house and everything else except he has not given me you he's telling uh you know uh Piper's wife he never gave me you he gave me everything else but he never gave me you and how can I sin against God not against pontier against God because he had a reality of God in his life and when you come into situations and trials and Temptations I want you to know that it's it's it's your relationship with God that's going to surface when the time comes that the Temptation tries to take you you thank you hallelujah praise God so all of these things God was showing the character of Joseph praise the Lord Jesus amen hallelujah let's go to the next now we're going to look at so that was looking at Joseph's faithfulness what we just looked at there we just touching on certain areas of his life certain aspects of his character amen so the next uh slide is the next scripture from Genesis 41:15 to6 and we want to notice that also before we go to this just go back to the other scripture or not not the scripture but the the Joseph's faithfulness I want I want you to know that that Temptation that Joseph faced he was falsely accused by Piper's wife and he was placed in prison for something that he never did but while he was in prison God didn't change Joseph's attitude I want you to notice that his same attitude that while he was under pontier that same attitude went with him into the jail he was still faithful he was still willing to do all that would please God not please man amen and this is a lesson that we need to draw from this from this uh you know uh thought here is that Joseph never bowed down he stayed faithful to his calling his election his placing all that God had done for him he realized that God had taken him out of the pit God had placed him and give him favor in pontier house he realized that this was just another setup another another display of God wanting to come on the scene because God had a plan for Joseph and while he was in prison you know the story I'm not going to go through all of it but while he was in prison we realized that um that there was a couple of Servants of pharaoh that were thrown into the prison and one was the Baker and the other one was the was the cup Bearer and Joseph was able to interpret their Dreams by the spirit of God it wasn't by his own ability you see God has given us the spirit of revelation God has given us certain aspects of our personal walk with him that that gives us uh blessings for those that we know it pours out blessings into our family it it blesses the places that we work you know that you can't help but be a blessing wherever God places you if if you've got the right attitude where God has placed you you will be a blessing there and they will know that you are a blessing but if you're the kind of person like the rest of the world where they get a job yeah well it's a job well it's a job you know I'll do only what I got to do and then man when that 4:00 Buzzard goes off boom right to the door right to the time clock I'm out of here you know that is not the kind of attitude that exists in Sons and Daughters of God I want you to see things here I want you to identify yourself in the areas I want you to surrender in certain areas where you feel like maybe I'm being a little selfish in these areas you know I need to I need to live more for others I need to allow my life to be a display that can help others not just myself amen and so while Joseph was was in prison he didn't have the attitude oh man I'm stuck here he didn't join himself with all those that were that were like the the the rebels and you know all the ones that um that were rebelling and wanted to fight all the time no Joseph he actually gained the favor of the head Jailer and all of a sudden he was running the jail within two years he was he was in there and he was he was running the show you know and yet here now a couple of individuals get thrown into jail Joseph identifies their dreams tells one that you're going to be restored tells the other one that your head's going to be removed and and from that event it wasn't until years later a couple years later that all of a sudden Pharaoh now has a dream and here now Joseph is still living the way that he was when he was living with pontier he was still loyal he he was still he had no attitude he was he was the one that was running the jail now go to the next scripture Genesis 41:15 to16 and Pharaoh said unto Joseph I have dreamed a dream and there is none that can interpret it and I have heard say of thee that thou can't understand a dream to interpret it and Joseph answered Pharaoh saying it is not me God shall give pharaoh an answer of Peace you know Joseph could have looked at this opportunity and seen man you know what I'm gonna I'm going to go to pharaoh and I'm G to make him think that I am the most spiritual individual that he's ever met you know you know sometimes listen God's giving you revelation of this message you want to know how you can help others and bring others to Christ humble yourself humble yourself Joseph was showing humility in his character he didn't turn around and tell Pharaoh I know I can interpret your dream no he made it very clear that God was with him that God started a work in my life and God's going to finish this work in my life I don't know how it is that he gives me all this wisdom and understanding and organizational skills and ability to do the things that I do but God has given me those things and and God is going to use them for his glory not for my not to raise me up not to do anything good for me he says I don't it's not in me he says but God will give you the interpretation amen praise God hallelujah he was showing a prime example of faithfulness to God during his entire life and during this particular experience and and then here he goes and he interprets everything for the Pharaoh and then he tells the Pharaoh after giving them the interpretation of his dreams and if you want to go back and read all about it it's really a blessing go back and read all the whole story again the inter you know after after this service here and hearing what you've heard you're going to see Joseph and yourself and your experiences and how God is working all these things out in your life and here he was showing his dream he told him seven years of famine or seven years of plenty seven years of famine and then he tells Pharaoh he says now you're going to need to appoint somebody you're going to need to find somebody that's got the wisdom in order to control all the Garners to put away a a a a percentage he told them 20% he knew exactly what needed to be done because God had given him the wisdom because God had a plan in his life you know know God places gifts in the church amen God places those gifts so that they can come to the surface naturally organically by the power of God by the leadership of the Holy Spirit God moves in Supernatural ways and he can place you exactly where he wants you to be and he'll start to use that gift in you because you have become humble enough to know that it's God's gift it's not your gift it's the people gift it's not the preacher's gift it's all the grace of God and with that in mind God knowing that his body is going to come together he knows every part that needs to get into its position he knows those that he needs to still shape their character shape their attitudes shape their pride remove that Pride humble them and get them to a place where they are totally surrendered unto him totally surrendered unto to him praise God and when when we get to that place like Joseph he got so yielded and so surrendered that God was giving him wisdom and understanding and leadership ability to do things that no man imagine the Pharaoh was like God on Earth he was like God on Earth and yet Joseph goes there interprets everything tells him what he needs to do Pharaoh sitting back there listening to him and saying wait a minute here is there anyone that could possibly be better than this individual right here and all his servants around said no no he's the man he's the one he's he's the one God was showing God was displaying that Joseph was being prepared to go and sit at the right hand of pharaoh hallelujah what kind of lessons do we learn from this humility when Pharaoh says says I hear you can interpret dreams it would have been easy for Joseph to say here's here it is in my notes it's nothing really just a little hobby I've developed over the years he could have said that but instead Joseph boldly says to this Pagan King it's not me God will give you an answer he was being bold you know Pharaoh could have turned around and said God what do you mean God I am God on Earth yeah but he was so troubled you see God works on both ends when God wants to Humble somebody let me tell you you get puffed up before God God will bring you right back down to the Earth just as quick as you puff yourself up he'll blow it right out of you hallelujah praise God but Pharaoh was humble enough to say no but instead Joseph boldly tells him this Joseph was clear on the source of his success and how it was that he could interpret dreams he he he took it and showed that it was all God he didn't let the Splendor of pharaoh in his Palace make him forget without God I'm nothing that's what he realized and until we get to a place to realize that without God in our lives without the spirit of God leading us directing us guiding us we're nothing amen we're going to fall into the traps of the enemy the enemy is going to trap you young people one way or the other is going to snare you with one Slicker and he's going to talk real sweet and cute to you and he's going to pull you away from God don't you let that happen don't you let the spirit of God uh in you uh keep it keep it keep it in the Forefront of your heart amen praise God Joseph without God I'm nothing he his source and his ability was all based on God amen hallelujah praise God Joseph he could have been you know he could have been like so angry listen some of the lessons that we learn here as we're winding down here faithfulness Joseph was a prime example of faithfulness during his his entire life he suffered a lot was sold into slavery he would have been easy to react in Anger to grow bitter lazy without caring about the world around him but Joseph didn't do that whatever t Joseph got God gave to him he did it with a whole heart everywhere he went success followed I'm telling you that if you from today you say I'm GNA serve God I'm going to serve God at work I'm going to serve God wherever I go I'm not talking about getting all religious on people I'm just talking about that internal Integrity you and God knowing being conscious of God Amen he was faithful to his master in in Piper's house and he was faithful to his master in the the prison Hallelujah he he was he was he was resistant to Temptation because of the spirit of God that was in him you stay in the word feed on the word assemble yourself whenever you possibly can that fortifies you with with the spirit of God around your life amen glory to God he was tempted day after day by that woman yet he held firm because he realized that he would be sinning against God hallelujah are you conscious of God every day in your life abolutely praise God Amen Hallelujah he chose relationship with God over relationship with the world Amen praise God it was showing God's sovereignty Joseph's life is also a great example of the sovereignty of God Amen praise God hallelujah seeming number listen he had so many disasters take place around him but he turned it all for good God turned everything for good am amen praise God he wasn't one he showed forgiveness Joseph was treated worse by his own family than any of us have almost surely ever been treated to the point where go you know your own family wants to kill you he faced some of the greatest challenges but he held to the word of God Amen he didn't hold any Grudge you know I was reading something this week you know he he didn't he didn't hold Grudge you know Joseph could have dealt with his brothers and dealt with them in such a way that when when when they came to him for for grain he could have he could have got real nasty with them but inside of him there was something that would not hold a grudge it was because the spirit of God was on his life you know I read something this we this week and I got a little bit of a of a a smile out of it and it's about American soldiers who during the Korean War had rented a house and hired a Korean man to cook for them and we're talking about holding a grudge this guy had an unbelievably great spirit about him the Americans loved teasing him they nailed his shoes to the floor they put grease on the stove handles they balanced buckets of water over the door so when he would open the the door they were being so nasty to him but this Korean brushed it all off and kept working with a smile holding no grudges finally the Americans just ashamed of themselves and wanted him to know that they were going to stop all the practical jokes the Korean ask you mean no more nail shoe no more no more sticky handle no more you mean no more bucket on door no more okay then I spit no more in your soup you see it's one thing when you hold a grudge and it's another thing when you actually Let It Go amen he was letting go of The Grudge right [Laughter] there hallelujah praise God you know some of the things as we wind down here just a couple more minutes some of the things that we need to realize you know there's so much from Joseph's life I just want to read Genesis 50 no I won't go there yet hold on I want us to that's going to be how we're going to end right there on that scripture you know there's some things that we need to learn from from what we've read here today and some of the examples of Joseph's character and there's there's a few things there's five things here that I that I wrote down down and number one was releasing your grudges you know sometimes we go through things in life and we have certain experiences and you know people hurt us and that can happen but we need to be able to let go of those things it falls under the same category as forgiveness we need to be able to forgive and I mean really forgive let go understand that you know listen you'll go and read all of this and you will see that Joseph's brothers they actually repented they actually came to a place where they realized that what they had done was wrong they came to a place that they they they feared that God was now go you know having Vengeance on them for what they did for Joseph they came to that place and Joseph displayed perfectly the the the character of Jesus Christ and that he forgave no matter what the circumstance you could look back on situations you could have had some bad conversations with with a loved one or a brother or a sister and had some scars that are still sitting there and their kind of wounds that you're not allowing the Holy Spirit to to mend and to allow the bomb of Gilead to allow his love loving bomb to come in and and and take away that pain and that sorrow it requires true forgiveness Letting Go truly letting go of your past understanding that everything that was in your past that that brought about those circumstances they need to be left in the past so that you can move on and be everything that God wants you to be he's got a plan look at the plan he had for Joseph it was a plan for the Salvation of the then world just like Jesus Christ is the savior of this world he's the only savior that can save anybody from from from what's going to come down upon this Earth it's going into the Great Tribulation there's going to be a complete uh massive destruction that's going to take place upon the Earth there's going to be many survivors but those that are in Christ will not have to go through that and that's what he's here to do is to bring you into that Ark of Safety which is Jesus Christ amen but you need to be able to forgive and let go of those things the other thing you need to do is you need to check your attitude everywhere Joseph ended up even in the dreariness of prison for two years he simply made it better only a good attitude can can position you and you can position you sorry you cannot defeat a person who chooses to make the best of a bad situation why because they got the right attitude I love the ability of Ronald Reagan listen to this despite having a bullet lodged in his heart he brushed off the Secret Service agents stood up buttoned his jacket and then walked into the emergency room this actually happened during the medical procedure he he he looked to his wife and he said honey I forgot to and to the surgeon about to operate he says I hope you're a republican you see he had the right attitude and he came out of that surgery we're using that in showing as an example but attitude will ultimately affect your altitude in life and in the body of Christ amen glory to God you need to trust God Amen regardless he was always taking listen he has always uh uh been there though though Joseph had some serious disappointments Joseph had to trust when he was in the pit Joseph had to trust when he was sold into slavery Joseph had to trust when he was facing that Temptation with Piper's wife he had to trust when he was thrown into jail Hallelujah and he had to trust God when he went up before Pharaoh that God was going to give him what he had need of Amen to overcome and he needed to trust God and we need to trust God praise God we need to understand that God is truly good amen God is in control of everything Hallelujah God elevated Joseph from prisoner in the dungeon to prime minister of Egypt but in the process he had to go through some time and some crime and all kinds of stuff that he never committed Joseph learned first of all that whatever happened to him personally was part of a larger purpose in which God's plan was being revealed in that case he could not hold grudges against his brothers no matter how badly they had behaved true they must they must learn of their sin and confess it and this explains the lengthy way in which Joseph really repeals his himself to them and his brothers and his brothers actually they came to a place where they they realized that they had sinned secondly Joseph begins to learn the answer to the question how will the promise made to Abraham be fulfilled God made a promise to Abraham Jacob Abraham Isaac and Jacob and in Joseph and Joseph was catching revelation of how God's promises were going to be fulfilled through the promise that was given to his great grandfather Abraham he was coming into to a realization let's read the final scripture now Genesis 50 let the musicians come when Joseph's Brethren saw that their father was dead they said to Joseph will pre-venture hate us and will certainly requite us of all the evil which we did unto him and they sent a messenger unto Joseph saying thy father did command before he died saying so shall ye say unto Joseph forgive I pray thee now the trespass of thy Brethren and their sin for they did unto thee evil and now we pray thee forgive the trespass of the Servants of the god of thy father and Joseph wept when they spake unto him and his Brethren also went and fell down before his face and they said behold we be thy servants and Joseph said unto them fear not for I am in the place of God am I in the place of God he was saying he was telling them clearly but as for you you thought evil against me but God meant it unto good to bring to pass at is as it is this day to save much people alive God had a purpose in Joseph do you know that God has a purpose in you amen do you know that your part in the word of God may lead that last one into the body of Christ which will lead to the Fulfillment of the body being completed and and the body going in the Rapture and allowing the Salvation that is that has come to this world to be fulfilled Jesus Christ has a great plan it's a much bigger plan than than than your individual plan but God has made you a part of that plan God wants you to recognize that all the things that have come into your life all the things that have that have hurt you that have made and given you those bad experiences they were all for a a a a greater purpose much greater than even yourself but for the purpose that that Christ might fulfill his purpose in the Plan of Redemption because Jesus said all that the father hath given me will come not one is going to be left behind every single son and daughter of God no matter what condition no matter where they are no matter the circumstances God is going to reach into that individual's life and God is going to use you to do it that's why you've been called to this Revelation that's why you've been called to this word that's why we we we we we see the word in in a much greater way because of the Revelation that God has placed placed on our lives we're not just church members we're not just members of Good Neighbor
