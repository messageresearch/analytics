[30:54] Glory to God. I just want to thank
[30:56] everybody for being um patient over the

[31:05] have uh stepped in and have stood in the
[31:07] gap and have um been there to uh
[31:11] continue the cause. Amen. To take the
[31:15] word of God to the people and to allow
[31:17] the word to transform lives. Amen.

[31:44] was ever a time we need to understand
[31:46] that the enemy is coming in from the
[31:48] weak spots, the rear, you know, when
[31:50] we're focused on doing certain things,
[31:52] he's there trying to come in from behind
[31:54] and snatch away some of the young ones,
[31:57] the, you know, the the the weaker um
[32:01] ones that are just coming into the Lord.
[32:03] But uh and even those that have been
[32:05] around a long time just snaring them
[32:07] away with deception and lies making them
[32:11] think that um you know this is not the
[32:14] the ultimate and absolute truth. God
[32:18] is the absolute truth. Amen. The
[32:21] self-existent one. Elohim, the creator
[32:24] of the universe. But you need to know

[36:19] Let's just um uh encourage one another.
[36:23] Amen. Let's pray before we go to the
[36:25] word. Father, we thank you for this
[36:27] opportunity now as we approach your
[36:30] word. We ask you would come and you
[36:33] minister, you take control of the the
[36:36] thoughts, the word that will be spoken
[36:38] through the vessel and Lord, the hearts
[36:41] and the and the and the minds of the
[36:43] people that you would uh uh inspire them
[36:46] with your word by riding the word in
[36:49] spirit and truth. Father, take control
[36:51] now. We surrender ourselves to your
[36:54] service in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[36:57] Praise God. Let's go to the word of God.
[36:59] We're going to be looking at a father
[37:01] under authority. I know it's Father's
[37:03] Day. You know, it's Father's Day. This
[37:06] title here, you know, when I started to
[37:07] look into it, the first, you know,
[37:09] initially I titled it a man
[37:12] under authority. You could place it a
[37:15] man or a woman under authority. And um
[37:18] it's it's coming under authority to a
[37:22] higher power.
[37:25] And what we're going to be looking at is
[37:27] while we while we, you know, look into
[37:30] these scriptures, uh we're going to see
[37:32] that when somebody is truly under
[37:35] authority,
[37:36] they're in authority. Amen. Especially
[37:39] when it comes to understanding the
[37:41] supreme authority of the universe and
[37:44] the supreme authority of Jesus Christ,
[37:46] our God. Amen. As the supreme authority
[37:50] in the universe. In the beginning was
[37:52] the word and the word was with God and
[37:54] the word was God. Amen. Amen. And the
[37:57] word was made flesh. So let's read our
[38:00] scripture and then you may be seated um
[38:02] from Matthew 8
[38:05] familiar scripture verses 5 to10. It
[38:08] says, "And when Jesus was entered into
[38:10] Capernaum,
[38:12] there came unto him a centurion
[38:15] beseeching him, and saying, Lord, my
[38:18] servant lith at home sick of Pauly,
[38:21] grievously tormented." And Jesus saith
[38:24] unto him, I will come and heal him. The
[38:28] centurion answered and said, 'Lord, I am
[38:30] not worthy that thou should us come
[38:32] under my roof, but speak the word only
[38:36] and my servant shall be healed. Now
[38:39] listen what he says here. He says, "For
[38:42] I am a man under authority." He knew
[38:46] that he was under authority. He had been
[38:48] given an authority because he was under
[38:51] an authority. You can't be given
[38:52] authority unless some something higher
[38:55] gives you that authority.
[38:58] And so he says, "I'm a man under
[38:59] authority having soldiers under me. And
[39:02] I say to this man, go and he goeth. And
[39:05] to another, come and he cometh, and to
[39:07] my servant, do this, and he doeth it."
[39:11] When Jesus heard it, he marveled and
[39:14] said to them that that followed, he
[39:16] says, "Verily I say unto you, I have not
[39:19] found so great revelation,
[39:23] so great faith. No, not in Israel. You
[39:28] may be seated. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[39:30] Lord. Wow. Think about that, saints.
[39:34] Here the Lord is saying,
[39:37] I haven't seen faith like this. And here
[39:39] all all he all he was saying was, "Hey,
[39:41] I I'm a I'm a man under authority, and
[39:44] if I say, you know, something needs to
[39:47] be done, they do it. They listen." What
[39:50] he was saying was that I know who you
[39:52] are. I know that you are the word made
[39:56] flesh. I know that you are God and that
[39:58] your word has supreme deity and
[40:01] authority here on this earth. And all
[40:04] you got to do is speak the word and my
[40:06] servant will be healed. You see, he was
[40:09] expressing faith that he knew who he was
[40:13] and he knew who Jesus was. Amen. And
[40:16] that placed him in a in a in a place
[40:19] where God himself looks and says, "Wow,
[40:23] this is amazing faith." Like, can you
[40:26] imagine? So, there's something in there
[40:29] that I believe that we can draw from
[40:31] today. That's where I I've drawn this
[40:34] this whole inspiration from, you know,
[40:37] and and more specifically, we're going
[40:39] to be looking at fathers, okay? Because
[40:43] to truly understand the position of a
[40:45] father, you need to understand the
[40:47] heavenly father. Amen. Before he was a
[40:51] father, he was God. He was the creator.
[40:55] Whatever he spoke, it was he only
[40:59] expressed himself as a father.
[41:03] Amen. But in that expression, he was
[41:06] showing that in all of creation, in
[41:11] everything that he would be doing here
[41:13] in this earthly existence, because this
[41:16] is our earthly existence. This is where
[41:19] we are. Deal with it. Okay. A lot of
[41:22] people, you know, they want to they want
[41:24] to look so much into what's coming in
[41:26] the future. They want to look back into
[41:28] the thousands and thousands of years and
[41:30] millions of years of the past. What good
[41:32] is that going to do you if you don't
[41:34] know where you are right now? What good
[41:37] is it going to do you if you don't know
[41:38] what what what's expected of you in this
[41:41] day and what God is doing today? That's
[41:45] what's important for us. And so here now
[41:49] he was he was recognizing his position
[41:53] and God was expressing fatherhood
[41:56] through Jesus Christ. Because listen to
[42:00] Jesus everything he said he says I do
[42:02] nothing lest the father shows me
[42:06] I and and then and then when Philillip
[42:09] you know one of his disciples goes up to
[42:11] him and says Lord you keep talking about
[42:14] the father I'm just you know I'm I'm I'm
[42:16] I'm exaggerating a bit he says can you
[42:19] show us the father you know you keep
[42:22] talking about him and everything that he
[42:23] does and Jesus just stopped and he looks
[42:26] at Philip he says
[42:28] have I not been with you for how long
[42:30] have how long have I been here? Look at
[42:32] everything that's been happening. Can't
[42:35] you see? He says, quote, "If you see me,
[42:40] you see the father." Thank you, Jesus.
[42:43] It's not I that doeth the works, but the
[42:45] father that dwelleth in me. He's doing
[42:48] the works. Thank you, Jesus. So he was
[42:50] expressing this whole plan of God having
[42:56] a family and fellowship with people on
[43:01] earth. God uniting with man. Amen. This
[43:05] is what his whole plan was. And when he
[43:09] came in Jesus Christ, he was showing
[43:12] that God could have a place on earth in
[43:17] human flesh.
[43:18] Even though Jesus was created by the
[43:22] spoken word when the angel went to Mary,
[43:25] Jesus was not a creation of a father and
[43:28] a mother coming together and the seed
[43:30] and the egg coming together. No, he was
[43:33] spoken word body. That's how Adam could
[43:36] have called every one of us before the
[43:39] fall in the garden of Eden. All he had
[43:41] to do was because God's creator, God was
[43:44] expressing his attributes himself. He
[43:47] was just expressing himself into Adam.
[43:50] And then Adam was given dominion over
[43:52] the earth to express out of himself. And
[43:55] that's why he took from himself
[43:58] out of his own womb of a woman and
[44:02] created a companion, the wife. And this
[44:06] is the whole plan of redemption that
[44:08] we're that this is everything that we're
[44:11] talking about here today. And so when we
[44:13] talk about father, we need to see it in
[44:16] its right perspective. And when we look
[44:19] at all these things that we're going to
[44:21] look at today, when it comes to being a
[44:24] father under authority,
[44:27] we can better understand how important
[44:29] and why it was that God placed the
[44:32] responsibility
[44:34] of a family in the hands of the father.
[44:40] The father is responsible
[44:43] not because of any other reason but
[44:45] because that was his plan from the
[44:48] beginning. Amen. We need to be able to
[44:51] see that.
[44:53] Let's go to the next slide. In Proverbs
[44:56] 29, it says when a when the righteous
[44:59] are in authority.
[45:01] Now, when we talk about righteous, I'm
[45:04] not saying that there's none righteous.
[45:07] Amen. There's nobody here that say, "Oh,
[45:09] I'm a righteous father." No. The only
[45:12] righteousness that we can claim is the
[45:14] righteousness of God himself, his spirit
[45:17] coming upon you, taking possession of
[45:20] your life, controlling your thoughts,
[45:22] and giving you the ability to have his
[45:25] righteousness operate through your life.
[45:29] Amen. You're just blessed to allow him
[45:31] to have have preeminence in your life.
[45:34] But he says, "When the righteous are in
[45:36] authority, the people rejoice. But when
[45:39] the wicked beareth rule, the people
[45:41] mourn." And it's so true. When you've
[45:45] got a a dictator in a in a in a country
[45:47] or you've got somebody that's completely
[45:50] uh you know, his righteousness, I it's
[45:53] what I say goes.
[45:55] It's if you don't do what I say, we're
[45:58] taking your head off. That's the kind
[46:00] of, you know, dictators and rulership
[46:03] that's going on in the world. And that's
[46:05] why this world will will only fail
[46:08] without the the faith and the revelation
[46:12] and the understanding of God's plan for
[46:15] humanity.
[46:17] Because pride takes over man. Pride,
[46:20] lust, the things of the flesh. You know,
[46:23] man, you know, like every man you you
[46:25] you look at any man that that's ever
[46:28] fallen, he's fallen because of three uh
[46:31] because of one of these three reasons.
[46:33] The pride of life, I'm the best. And you
[46:36] know, I'm the head supreme leader over
[46:38] here. If he's mobbed, I'm the boss over
[46:41] Chicago. Yeah. Boom. Now I'm the boss.
[46:44] You see what I mean? It's all about, you
[46:46] know, pride. And then the next one's got
[46:49] more pride. He says, "What? He called me
[46:51] what? Boom. Takes him out. You see, it's
[46:55] all and and and and everything is is
[46:58] doomed to fail because of that
[47:00] understanding of not understanding God's
[47:03] way God's ways. Amen. Pride of life,
[47:07] lust of the eyes, I got to have this
[47:08] woman. She's mine. I'll kill for her. Or
[47:13] the lust of the uh you know, lust of the
[47:15] flesh. Or the lust of the eyes. I got to
[47:17] have the biggest, the best. I got to be
[47:20] the richest. And he ends up falling flat
[47:23] on his face because of those elements,
[47:27] not understanding God's plan for man.
[47:32] Amen. And so if if there's if there's
[47:36] righteous authority and there's an
[47:38] authority in a father or in a man or in
[47:42] a woman that's positioned under the word
[47:44] of God, they come into authority.
[47:48] Amen. That's what we're going to be
[47:49] looking at here. Let's let's read on
[47:52] here. So, listen, here's a quote. Um,
[47:55] you know, when when,
[47:58] you know, when I started to talk about
[47:59] authority, I'm sure some of you, you
[48:01] know, might have been thinking, oh,
[48:02] well, you know, here we go. He's, you
[48:04] know, maybe the women start to think,
[48:05] oh, he's going to start hitting on, you
[48:07] know, how we got to be got we got to be
[48:08] under submission and, you know, all
[48:11] about submission to our husbands and
[48:13] this and that. That's so much um you
[48:17] know perversion
[48:19] to to you know people have put so much
[48:21] of a perversion on this message when it
[48:24] comes to that they just don't understand
[48:26] that that the wife and the husband is a
[48:29] type of Christ the husband and the wife
[48:31] being the church coming under the
[48:34] submission of the word of of his plan so
[48:38] that there's safety in the plan
[48:41] and so you know deacons you know when we
[48:43] start talking about this. You know, the
[48:45] pastor, oh, well, he wants us to line up
[48:46] with with his vision. We got to we got
[48:48] to see it the way he sees it. No, you're
[48:51] all individuals. And then some of you
[48:53] young people, you might think about
[48:54] authority. You might be thinking, "Oh,
[48:56] uh, he's going to he's going to tell us
[48:57] off because we're painting our hair
[48:59] purple
[49:01] or or you know, we're tattooed from top
[49:03] to bottom."
[49:05] That doesn't change who you are. If
[49:08] you're an attribute of God, an actual
[49:11] part of God, it doesn't matter what's
[49:16] what what you know, like listen, we
[49:18] could go back and look at our past and
[49:21] we could every single one of us would
[49:24] would say failed. Boom. Failed. Boom.
[49:29] Every one of us. But remember, this is
[49:31] not about our righteousness. This is
[49:34] about him coming in and cleaning out and
[49:38] taking over so that we can fulfill our
[49:42] part. Amen. We have a part in this whole
[49:46] plan of redemption. Amen. That's what we
[49:48] want. And so the authority that we're
[49:52] looking at today is the sovereign
[49:53] authority that God gives you when you're
[49:56] positioned properly in the word of God.
[49:59] Amen. And so here uh brother Brandham's
[50:02] uh you know from the message presuming
[50:05] he says here in 1962 he says now I'm I'm
[50:08] going to teach on the subject of
[50:10] presuming it's just presuming
[50:13] now if we were the Webster says that to
[50:17] presume is to venture without authority
[50:22] actual authority or to take it for
[50:24] granted
[50:26] that's the word presume means go without
[50:29] authority or just taking it for granted.
[50:32] Now that just take it for granted. Now
[50:35] that's to presume. Now Israel made a
[50:38] fatal mistake when they did this. Not
[50:42] only Israel, but everybody else that
[50:46] does it. It will be a fatal mistake when
[50:49] you presume to walk with God
[50:53] when God has not called you to walk with
[50:56] him. Now remember, you can't have real
[50:59] true authority
[51:01] if God hasn't called you to the position
[51:05] and you know that you've been given the
[51:07] authority.
[51:09] You don't a police officer has to be
[51:12] ordained an officer given a badge. He
[51:16] could be 4 foot2, but if he stands in
[51:19] front of the traffic and he goes stop,
[51:22] that car, which is a 5,000lb car, has to
[51:26] come to a screeching halt because that 4
[51:29] foot 75lb man put up his hand and a
[51:32] badge in his left. He's been given
[51:36] authority
[51:37] and therefore he's under the authority
[51:40] and he has the authority.
[51:42] Okay? So you need to be So here God has
[51:45] not called you to walk with him or when
[51:47] you presume to venture out upon things
[51:50] that's not scriptural thinking that
[51:53] it'll be all right. It's not all right.
[51:56] Eve presumed. She presumed it would be
[52:00] all right because Satan presented
[52:02] something looked awful nice but she
[52:05] presumed it. It wasn't the word. You
[52:09] don't want to do that. You want to stay
[52:12] with the word. Don't move from that.
[52:15] Stay right there. No matter if you
[52:17] stand. And remember, men that ever done
[52:20] anything for God stood alone
[52:24] with God. Amen. You're going to have to
[52:26] stand alone on on on your conviction. If
[52:29] you've really truly come to a conviction
[52:31] in your life, you got to be prepared to
[52:34] stand there aside from everybody else
[52:39] saying you're wrong. Amen. Because that
[52:43] shows that you truly have a a walk with
[52:47] God. You've come into a personal
[52:50] relationship with God. And remember that
[52:54] he says uh on the road there's only room
[52:57] for two. That's you and God. And you men
[53:01] that's ever done anything under the
[53:03] convictions by the word stood alone.
[53:07] Amen. We've had to be alone. We've had
[53:11] to stand alone. We've had to re bear the
[53:14] reproach of this word to stand with God.
[53:18] But I'm telling you, you stand with God
[53:21] in this time and in this season when a
[53:23] world is completely falling apart.
[53:25] There's wars going on right now. There's
[53:28] things going on right now that at any
[53:30] moment things could change in a moment
[53:33] in the world.
[53:36] You want to know who you're walking
[53:38] with. You want to know where you stand.
[53:42] Oh yeah. Oh yeah. So the thing is, you
[53:48] know, as a as a um as a Christian
[53:50] father, for example, I'm physically no
[53:53] different or better than any other
[53:55] father out there. I don't have any
[53:58] special abilities.
[54:00] But if I understand my position as a
[54:03] father that has come under the authority
[54:05] of the word of God for this day and for
[54:07] this hour, then then I'm given an
[54:11] authority by God. The word gives
[54:16] authority. God's not going to honor man.
[54:19] He's going to honor his word. And when
[54:22] you stand with his word, he honors that.
[54:24] Amen. That's why, you know, there people
[54:26] say, "Yeah, but you know, which church
[54:28] is God going to believe?" You know,
[54:31] there's so many different churches out
[54:33] there. They all teach different
[54:34] teachings. One's Trinitarian, one's God
[54:37] is going to vindicate himself.
[54:40] God will personally reveal himself to
[54:43] you. Personal. Remember, don't don't be
[54:47] looking at, "Oh, I went to Good Neighbor
[54:48] Ministries. Maybe that's the right
[54:50] church." No, no, no, no. We're not
[54:52] claiming any of that. We're claiming
[54:54] that you need to come into a
[54:56] relationship with Christ, God himself,
[55:00] so that you can know. Jesus said the
[55:01] gates of hell will not prevail against
[55:04] divine revelation. When he said to
[55:07] Peter,
[55:08] who's you know flesh and blood has not
[55:10] revealed this to you, Peter. How do you
[55:12] know who I am?
[55:14] He says, the father which is in heaven
[55:17] personally by revelation from his mind
[55:21] to your mind. And now you know he says
[55:24] that's how I'm going to build my church.
[55:26] One by one I'm going to call them that
[55:29] way personal. Amen. And so we don't hold
[55:34] any I I I don't have any great
[55:37] abilities. I'm no different than any
[55:39] other father out there. But I believe
[55:42] the word. Amen. And by by coming under
[55:45] the authority of the word, God now
[55:48] places an authority in my life. Amen.
[55:53] He places it in my life. That anything
[55:56] that comes into my life, it doesn't mean
[55:59] that I'm going to rule over every single
[56:02] thing or a person that comes into my
[56:04] life. No. But he allows me to stand in
[56:07] my position and to be fortified by his
[56:11] word. Amen. I don't have to argue. I
[56:14] don't have to push and fuss. I don't,
[56:16] you know, it takes a long time for us to
[56:18] come to realize this, but this is the
[56:21] maturity of the sons and daughters of
[56:24] God. When when I first came in, listen,
[56:27] I'm going to be the first one. My
[56:29] daughter's right here. You know, I've
[56:30] apologized many times. I made a mess of
[56:34] my position as a father and and said
[56:38] things and and, you know, did things and
[56:40] got angry in certain ways. Didn't
[56:43] understand. But I can tell you one
[56:45] thing, it was not out of, you know,
[56:48] hatred or any of that nature or or
[56:51] rebellion. It was because of the love
[56:54] that I had for them and for God.
[56:59] Amen. Because I can look back and
[57:01] there's I, you know, I could have done
[57:03] things a lot different. Yes, we can. And
[57:06] listen, we've all made mistakes. So, so
[57:09] you know, you're going to hear things
[57:10] today, you know, about fathers, you
[57:13] know, that and you're going to, you
[57:14] know, a lot of us that, you know, when
[57:15] I, when I was doing this study through
[57:17] the week, let me tell you, I got
[57:19] convicted a lot. E, I got into some, you
[57:22] know, some Lord God, wow, you know,
[57:26] thank you for for giving me this
[57:28] understanding now. I wish I had have had
[57:30] it more back then, but that's growing.
[57:33] That's how you grow. That's how you
[57:34] mature. You can't look back at your
[57:36] mistakes and sit and and and and you
[57:39] know flog yourself because of it. What
[57:41] good is that going to do you? You got to
[57:44] move on. This is the plan of God. And
[57:47] what you know what I'm coming to
[57:48] discover is that God's love and that
[57:51] fatherly love that he has and that I
[57:53] have now for my children. I never had
[57:56] this kind of love for them like I'm
[57:57] experiencing it now. That's right. I
[58:00] want them to be free. I want them to
[58:02] know that that that that we we serve him
[58:04] because we love him because and and I
[58:07] want them to be happy. I want them to
[58:09] know they're they're what God has called
[58:13] them for and and season and time. And if
[58:17] God has a place for them in this
[58:18] revelation, they got to come. There's
[58:22] nothing that can stop it.
[58:24] Amen. But I don't want to presume
[58:27] anything. I don't want to be presuming
[58:29] anymore. I want to be a father that
[58:31] understands that I've come under the
[58:33] authority of his word and that now
[58:36] whatever needs to to to be uh authorized
[58:39] to come into my life, God's going to
[58:41] allow it to come. Amen. And if God's
[58:43] going to stop something, he'll stop it.
[58:45] And if he wants me to speak something,
[58:47] I'll speak it. If he wants me to say
[58:50] yes, I'll say yes. If he wants me to say
[58:52] no, I'll say no. Because now I
[58:55] understand my position where it comes
[58:58] from why I you know and you as fathers
[59:02] you are the supreme authority in your
[59:05] homes.
[59:07] Not to dictate not a dictatorship
[59:10] but there has to be one that can say yes
[59:12] or no because there cannot be division.
[59:16] And a wife that understands,
[59:18] a husband that's under the authority of
[59:20] God, realizes that when she submits to
[59:24] her husband,
[59:26] she's got the protection of God on her.
[59:30] And that even when her husband gets out
[59:32] of line, God can deal with him and not
[59:35] so much with her.
[59:38] You see, this this is understanding God
[59:41] in in a way that you know, because
[59:43] remember, God will honor his word.
[59:46] And this is all pertaining to human
[59:49] existence.
[59:51] And as long as we're human, we got to
[59:53] deal with it. I don't care how
[59:56] spiritually minded you might think you
[59:58] are. You got to go to work tomorrow and
[1:00:00] you got to make money to pay the bills.
[1:00:06] So, we don't want to presume nothing. I
[1:00:08] know that that that you know I've
[1:00:10] recognized the word of God for my day
[1:00:13] and the position that it gives me and
[1:00:16] I'm not going to presume anything. Amen.
[1:00:20] Glory to God.
[1:00:22] And so, uh, I want to look here now, um,
[1:00:28] in understanding,
[1:00:30] let's let's go to the next slide,
[1:00:33] that there's that there's, uh, you know,
[1:00:35] there's a a resisting of authority out
[1:00:38] there. People don't want to come under
[1:00:40] authority.
[1:00:42] Pe, you know, you're naturally built
[1:00:44] that way. your your your nature is going
[1:00:47] to is going to resist authority because
[1:00:49] you're going to want your own way.
[1:00:52] That's just the way you're designed in
[1:00:54] your nature. Because remember when the
[1:00:56] enemy went that serpent went and
[1:00:59] deceived Eve, he got her to rebel
[1:01:01] against the word. He got her to
[1:01:04] disbelieve the word. And that's all that
[1:01:07] the enemy has to do is to get you to
[1:01:10] disbelieve the word. And the moment that
[1:01:12] you do that, you're resisting authority
[1:01:15] because you're not giving the word the
[1:01:18] absolute in your life.
[1:01:22] And we know that, you know, when when
[1:01:23] you've come into an understanding that
[1:01:25] that that the absolute is in you, you've
[1:01:29] still got to come to the maturity of
[1:01:31] being able to handle the power and the
[1:01:34] authority that God places in you.
[1:01:38] Because without character and with your
[1:01:41] own pride and your own ideas,
[1:01:44] you're going to be satanic in your
[1:01:47] decision-making.
[1:01:50] You're not going to be able to rule with
[1:01:53] God's character.
[1:01:56] Under God's sovereignty,
[1:01:59] by God's love,
[1:02:01] you'll rule because of your own emotions
[1:02:03] and you'll be controlled by your own
[1:02:05] emotions. But we need to understand that
[1:02:08] that that Jesus Christ when he was
[1:02:11] expressing fatherhood, it was fatherhood
[1:02:14] is an is an attribute. We need to see
[1:02:18] fatherhood for what it really is. It's
[1:02:19] an attribute. It's an expression of God.
[1:02:23] It's a way of bringing leadership and
[1:02:27] order to a home and to a to a a family
[1:02:31] and to a country and to a nation and to
[1:02:34] the world. Amen. Without understanding
[1:02:37] God's leadership and and what fatherhood
[1:02:41] really is in in Christ, the mystery of
[1:02:44] God revealed. I don't have the quote
[1:02:45] there. I just was reading it before I
[1:02:47] came out. It said here, "But what he
[1:02:49] wanted to do," he's talking about God.
[1:02:52] He loved fatherhood for he was a father.
[1:02:56] Yes. A father. Listen, what makes a
[1:02:59] father a father? The ability to create.
[1:03:02] Yes. Without a woman, he can't create.
[1:03:05] So the woman is very important here when
[1:03:07] it comes to understanding
[1:03:09] this whole plan of redemption. That's
[1:03:11] why he needs the church. He needs the
[1:03:13] bride. He needs people to recognize your
[1:03:17] your part in in the whole plan. And so
[1:03:21] he goes on, he says he loved fatherhood
[1:03:23] for he was a father and the only way he
[1:03:26] could express it was to become a son of
[1:03:29] man.
[1:03:30] He had to come and take on human flesh
[1:03:34] so that he could experience the human
[1:03:36] experience as a as a human being having
[1:03:41] having authority over the flesh.
[1:03:46] That's the reason Jesus kept saying the
[1:03:48] son of man. See, they didn't know what
[1:03:51] he was talking about, many of them. But
[1:03:54] now you get it. See, he wanted to
[1:03:57] express himself.
[1:03:59] That was his one of his great threefold
[1:04:03] purposes was to express himself,
[1:04:07] identify himself with human beings,
[1:04:11] to reveal himself in Christ. That's why
[1:04:15] he took on a human form.
[1:04:18] And secondly, to have the preeminence in
[1:04:21] his body of believers, which is the
[1:04:24] church, which is the wife, which is the
[1:04:27] bride.
[1:04:29] And so that his bride that he might live
[1:04:33] in people. That's what he says. So that
[1:04:35] God could actually live in people. Amen.
[1:04:40] And so the bride, the true church
[1:04:43] understands this relationship.
[1:04:46] That's why we're not playing church
[1:04:48] here. We're not, oh, let's go to church
[1:04:49] on Sunday. I'm telling you, 99% of the
[1:04:53] people that are going to church, they're
[1:04:55] doing it by tradition. Yeah, they're
[1:04:58] doing it because they want to please mom
[1:05:00] or dad or their friend or their their
[1:05:02] their their their pastor. They want to
[1:05:05] show up, but there's not a real true uh,
[1:05:09] you know, meaning and and and
[1:05:11] relationship with the self-existent one,
[1:05:14] almighty God himself. Amen. This is what
[1:05:17] we've come into contact. I had no idea
[1:05:20] that this was what I was going to
[1:05:21] contact when I went to go buy furniture
[1:05:23] from Gabriel.
[1:05:25] But God was in his life moving and
[1:05:29] preparing and calling and dealing with
[1:05:31] individuals that were lost on earth in a
[1:05:34] spiritual amnesia, not knowing who they
[1:05:36] were and had to bring them out of that
[1:05:39] amnesia. And so when when I went into
[1:05:41] that place, something happened
[1:05:43] supernaturally that opened my
[1:05:45] understanding to the reality of God.
[1:05:48] Amen.
[1:05:50] And that has to personally happen for
[1:05:53] you to understand what I just said.
[1:05:54] Amen. Hallelujah. And so when a man is
[1:05:59] under the authority and working under a
[1:06:01] higher authority, now we're talking
[1:06:03] about the wife and understanding the
[1:06:05] relationship because he wants this
[1:06:07] relationship with you.
[1:06:11] When a man is under under authority, for
[1:06:13] example, when when somebody is like uh
[1:06:15] you know like an estate and he's the
[1:06:19] head butler, he's the second in command
[1:06:23] other than the boss of that home and he
[1:06:27] runs, you know, the whole kitten
[1:06:30] kaboodleoodle. The man's got 35
[1:06:32] servants, 10 bakers. He's a
[1:06:35] multi-billionaire, runs an estate,
[1:06:38] and his top guy, he's been with him for
[1:06:42] so many years, and man, when he walks
[1:06:44] into the room, everybody goes, "Yes,
[1:06:46] sir." Right away. They make sure
[1:06:48] everything's
[1:06:50] perfect.
[1:06:52] He decides he's going to get married and
[1:06:54] he takes on a wife. And nobody knows
[1:06:58] this wife. Nobody has any idea who she
[1:07:01] is. All of a sudden, she shows up and
[1:07:03] she's living in the house and she's
[1:07:05] living in his room because she's his
[1:07:08] wife. The moment she comes into the
[1:07:11] room, everybody says, "Yes, ma'am."
[1:07:15] They'd never seen her before. They
[1:07:16] didn't know her before. But because she
[1:07:18] come under the authority of her husband,
[1:07:23] she immediately has authority.
[1:07:27] Thank you, Jesus. I want you to know
[1:07:30] that you believing this word that that
[1:07:33] everybody thinks you're cuckoo. Oh yeah,
[1:07:35] you're believing you're following this
[1:07:37] guy, you're following this, you're
[1:07:38] following that. You that have known that
[1:07:40] that that know that you have not come
[1:07:42] under the authority of some man-made
[1:07:44] teaching, but you've come under the
[1:07:46] authority of the living God.
[1:07:49] And you now as his wife have an
[1:07:52] authority because you know who your
[1:07:55] husband is. Yes, you understand your
[1:07:58] position in the body and in the family
[1:08:01] of God. And now a father that has this
[1:08:05] understanding when his daughter or his
[1:08:07] son gets sick and he goes and lays hands
[1:08:10] upon them knowing who he is and the
[1:08:12] authority that he has, even the doctors
[1:08:15] have to come submit to that father
[1:08:18] because he's got a higher authority.
[1:08:21] Because he's got the authority of God.
[1:08:23] Amen. You can lay hands on your sons and
[1:08:26] daughters. You can lay hands on the sick
[1:08:28] and believe because of your submission
[1:08:31] to God that God has given you an
[1:08:34] authority by the grace of God to lay
[1:08:36] hands on the sick and you're not going
[1:08:38] to cause them to recover.
[1:08:41] You're just submitting to what the word
[1:08:43] said.
[1:08:45] And the word says I can lay hands on the
[1:08:47] sick, pray over them, and if it's God's
[1:08:51] desire and perfect will for that person
[1:08:53] to be healed, they're going to get
[1:08:55] healed.
[1:08:56] Not because you believe it or don't
[1:08:58] believe it. It's because you believe
[1:09:01] God. They got to believe for the healing
[1:09:04] now. They've got to receive the faith.
[1:09:07] And if God wants to give it to them,
[1:09:09] he'll give it to them. Amen.
[1:09:14] Hallelujah.
[1:09:16] God started with man, has always dealt
[1:09:19] with the children of Israel, the
[1:09:21] families of the Old Testament through
[1:09:22] man.
[1:09:24] When you know when when we talk about
[1:09:26] father, we're here today. It's because
[1:09:28] it's Father's Day, we're talking about
[1:09:30] fathers. But understand this is God's
[1:09:33] way of doing things. We're looking at
[1:09:36] God's program. How it was that God dealt
[1:09:39] with the children of Israel. So you you
[1:09:41] go back into the Old Testament, God
[1:09:43] always dealt with the count of the
[1:09:45] families through what? The men.
[1:09:49] Through the men. Man, we know that that
[1:09:52] the woman must be a part of the whole
[1:09:54] earthly experience when we define man
[1:09:56] and woman. But in the beginning, it was
[1:09:58] not. So she was equal with Adam.
[1:10:03] She was absolutely Adam. He called their
[1:10:06] name Adam.
[1:10:10] But God had a plan
[1:10:12] and we're the ones that bring this whole
[1:10:14] plan back to what it's supposed to be
[1:10:18] from the beginning.
[1:10:21] And so the count of the families
[1:10:23] throughout the old, you know, testament
[1:10:26] was by the counting of men. The women
[1:10:28] and the children were under the
[1:10:30] leadership of the men, the fathers that
[1:10:32] were in the home who were named and
[1:10:34] counted. Even Jesus when he fed the
[1:10:36] 5000, read it, Matthew 14:21, "And they
[1:10:40] that had eaten were about 5,000 men
[1:10:45] beside the women and the children,
[1:10:53] resisting authority, not understanding
[1:10:56] how God has designed this whole plan of
[1:11:00] redemption.
[1:11:02] The problem today is that the churches
[1:11:04] are resisting. They're coming out with
[1:11:06] their own interpretation on the word.
[1:11:08] They want their own way of doing things
[1:11:11] and they're placing and resisting the
[1:11:13] word of God.
[1:11:15] But listen here. Let's go to the next uh
[1:11:17] slide in 2 Chronicles. For our fathers
[1:11:21] have trespassed
[1:11:23] and done that which was evil in the eyes
[1:11:25] of the Lord our God and have forsaken
[1:11:28] him. That's what that's what's going on
[1:11:30] out there. They're putting down a man's
[1:11:32] position. They're raising up. That's why
[1:11:35] women's liberation and everything else
[1:11:37] has become so strong and so powerful
[1:11:40] because they're trying to to weaken that
[1:11:42] position, that Godgiven position, not to
[1:11:46] raise up man, to make him a dictator
[1:11:49] over a woman and to make her his slave
[1:11:51] or anything like that. Get that all out
[1:11:53] of your head. We're talking about the
[1:11:55] plan of God and the way that God
[1:11:58] designed things to operate here on
[1:12:00] earth. The way of authority, he says,
[1:12:03] "They forsaken him and have turned away
[1:12:06] their faces from the habitation of the
[1:12:07] Lord and turned their backs. Also, they
[1:12:11] have shut up the doors of the porch and
[1:12:13] put out the lamps and have not burned
[1:12:15] incense, nor offered burnt offerings in
[1:12:18] the holy places unto the God of Israel.
[1:12:21] Wherefore the wrath of the Lord was upon
[1:12:23] Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath
[1:12:25] delivered them to trouble, to
[1:12:27] astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see
[1:12:30] with your eyes. For lo, our fathers have
[1:12:34] fallen by the sword. And notice, and our
[1:12:38] sons and our daughters and our wives are
[1:12:41] in captivity for this. The moment that
[1:12:44] they take away the proper position of a
[1:12:47] father in a family or a proper leader
[1:12:52] that is under the right authority in a
[1:12:54] country or in a nation, they put their
[1:12:59] families, their children, and their
[1:13:01] wives into captivity. Amen.
[1:13:06] That's why it's a mess. That's why the
[1:13:09] global economy and the and and the wars
[1:13:12] and and the problems that that exist is
[1:13:15] because they've they've taken out the
[1:13:18] proper positioning
[1:13:21] of God's authority on earth and they've
[1:13:26] resisted his authority. They've put it
[1:13:28] aside.
[1:13:30] And because of that, men's, women, and
[1:13:33] children are under captivity.
[1:13:36] We're going to look at a few statistics
[1:13:38] here. Listen to this.
[1:13:42] You can go to the next slide. A father's
[1:13:44] God-given authority. Listen, studies
[1:13:47] show a strong correlation between a
[1:13:50] father's faith and his children's church
[1:13:52] attendance. If a father regularly
[1:13:55] attends church, there's a high
[1:13:57] likelihood that his children will also
[1:14:00] attend as adults. And we're talking
[1:14:02] about a relationship with God here.
[1:14:05] And with studies indicating that 67% to
[1:14:09] 75% of such children will become
[1:14:12] churchgoers when their fathers
[1:14:16] go to church and have faith. Conversely,
[1:14:19] if a father does not attend church, only
[1:14:22] a small percentage of his children will
[1:14:24] become regular worshippers with some
[1:14:27] studies suggesting one in 50.
[1:14:31] I want you to pay attention here. This
[1:14:32] these are statistics. According to
[1:14:35] Lifeway Research, Father's Day is the
[1:14:37] holiday with the single lowest average
[1:14:40] church attendance.
[1:14:47] Pay attention. Statistically lower than
[1:14:49] Labor Day, Memorial Day, and even the
[1:14:52] 4th of July.
[1:14:55] This is interesting, especially when you
[1:14:56] consider that Mother's Day tends to be
[1:14:59] the day with the third highest church
[1:15:02] attendance
[1:15:04] after Easter and Christmas.
[1:15:09] So, Mother's Day is one of the most
[1:15:11] highly attended Sundays of the year and
[1:15:14] Father's Day is one of the lowest.
[1:15:16] What is that telling us?
[1:15:22] When both parents attend Bible study in
[1:15:25] addition to Sunday services, 72% of
[1:15:27] their children attend Sunday school when
[1:15:30] they grow up. When only the father
[1:15:32] attends Sunday school, 55% of the
[1:15:34] children attend. So when a husband and a
[1:15:37] wife both attend and they get into the
[1:15:39] study of the word and they they they
[1:15:41] have a desire for relationship with God,
[1:15:44] their their children, there's a 72%
[1:15:47] chance that their children will will
[1:15:49] will seek
[1:15:52] a relationship with God in some way,
[1:15:54] shape, or form.
[1:15:57] When only the mother attends Sunday
[1:15:59] school, 15%
[1:16:02] of the children attend when they grow
[1:16:04] up.
[1:16:05] It's a huge difference. Listen here.
[1:16:07] When neither parents attend Sunday
[1:16:09] school, only 6% of the children will
[1:16:12] eventually attend. Now, another survey
[1:16:15] found that if a child is the first
[1:16:17] person in the household to become a
[1:16:19] Christian, there's a 3 point there's a 3
[1:16:22] to 5% probability that everyone else in
[1:16:25] the household will follow.
[1:16:28] You see the importance of a father and a
[1:16:30] mother in their proper position. If the
[1:16:33] mother is the first to become a
[1:16:35] Christian, there's a 17% chance that
[1:16:38] everyone else in the household will
[1:16:40] follow. But watch, listen to this.
[1:16:41] However, when the father is first, there
[1:16:46] is a 93%
[1:16:48] probability that everyone else will
[1:16:51] attend.
[1:16:53] That's huge.
[1:16:56] What is that telling us? God has
[1:16:59] anointed fathers. God has a purpose in
[1:17:03] fathers in their position when it comes
[1:17:07] to his plan. His purpose, his plan of
[1:17:12] redemption, his plan of salvation.
[1:17:14] Fathers, it's it's an attack what we see
[1:17:18] out there. Well, you know, that's why
[1:17:19] the the the the church attendance is is
[1:17:23] down so much is because they've they've
[1:17:26] broken the influence of a father.
[1:17:29] They're trying to break it in any way
[1:17:31] possible.
[1:17:36] Dads, let me encourage you with these
[1:17:39] words which Moses spoke
[1:17:42] when it comes to the word of God. He
[1:17:45] says here, "And these words," you can go
[1:17:47] to the to the next slide.
[1:17:51] He says here in Deuteronomy, "And these
[1:17:53] words that I've commanded you today
[1:17:55] shall be on your heart." In other words,
[1:17:58] you know, we need to understand that
[1:18:00] that it's important to teach these
[1:18:03] things to our children that you shall
[1:18:06] teach them diligently to your children
[1:18:08] and shall talk of them when you sit in
[1:18:11] your house, when you walk, by the way,
[1:18:13] when you lie down, when you rise. Uh you
[1:18:17] shall bind them as a sign on your hand,
[1:18:20] and they shall be as frontlets between
[1:18:22] your eyes. You shall write them on the
[1:18:24] doorpost of your house and on your
[1:18:26] gates. What's he saying here? He's
[1:18:28] saying you need to teach them the truth
[1:18:32] of my word and my plan and my purpose
[1:18:35] and how I've designed this world to to
[1:18:39] have its proper order and authority
[1:18:43] so that we can have a world
[1:18:46] where Christ can have preeminence
[1:18:50] in the lives of the people. Our next
[1:18:55] slide says a word in season is the
[1:18:58] ultimate authority. We need to
[1:19:00] understand the importance of the
[1:19:04] progression of the word. You see, we
[1:19:07] were very blessed that God allowed us to
[1:19:10] recognize that he sent a 20th century
[1:19:13] prophet.
[1:19:14] You can go back into the Old Testament
[1:19:16] and you will see
[1:19:18] every single one of those books. God
[1:19:21] dealt with the people and he would
[1:19:23] always do it through a prophet.
[1:19:27] And we were blessed to receive a word.
[1:19:30] And I want you to notice here the word
[1:19:33] that came through that vindicated
[1:19:36] prophet through Malachi 4:es 4-6. Now
[1:19:39] look in verse four, it says, "Remember
[1:19:43] ye the law of Moses, my servant." That
[1:19:46] that's what we just read. And he was
[1:19:48] telling them to teach these things to
[1:19:49] your children. Teach those things. Make
[1:19:53] sure that you you you constantly talk
[1:19:55] about it about me, about my my ways, and
[1:19:58] how I want to have the preeminence
[1:20:00] because I've got a plan for this earth.
[1:20:03] And there's one way that you're going to
[1:20:05] come back to me, and it's got to be
[1:20:07] through this redemptive plan.
[1:20:10] And here he says,"Remember ye the law of
[1:20:12] Moses, my servant, which I commanded
[1:20:14] unto him in Horeb for all of Israel with
[1:20:17] the statutes and judgments." And he
[1:20:19] says, "Behold, I will send you Elijah
[1:20:22] the prophet before the coming of the
[1:20:25] great and dreadful day of the Lord." And
[1:20:27] I want you to notice what he says here.
[1:20:29] and he shall turn the heart of the
[1:20:32] fathers.
[1:20:34] God ordained it to be done through
[1:20:37] fathers.
[1:20:39] God has a reason why he wants it to be
[1:20:42] through fathers
[1:20:44] to turn the heart of the fathers to the
[1:20:48] children.
[1:20:50] A father once he's come into his
[1:20:53] rightful position and he has children,
[1:20:55] he's expressing the creative ability of
[1:20:59] God when he's bringing forth children.
[1:21:02] That's all a type of what God wanted to
[1:21:04] do from the very beginning. He wanted to
[1:21:07] have children so that he could have
[1:21:09] fellowship with those children. He could
[1:21:11] love those children. He could be with
[1:21:13] those children and have but the kind of
[1:21:16] fellowship that he had from the
[1:21:18] beginning there was no there was no like
[1:21:21] authority.
[1:21:23] There was no there was no authority. We
[1:21:25] were all equal.
[1:21:27] We were all attributes because we are
[1:21:30] actually God expressed in a different
[1:21:33] form. Thank you Jesus. But having the
[1:21:37] ability to know and understand that and
[1:21:40] when we come under that that authority
[1:21:42] of the law of God's way of of man having
[1:21:48] fellowship
[1:21:49] there's no jealousy. There's no
[1:21:52] hierarchy. There's no division. When we
[1:21:54] go back to our original position as
[1:21:57] attributes of God, there will be no no
[1:22:00] uh higher you're higher than me and I'm
[1:22:03] lower than you and no, we will be sons
[1:22:06] and daughters, attributes of God
[1:22:08] expressed in different forms, knowing
[1:22:11] one another and understanding one
[1:22:14] another that we are all a part of this
[1:22:18] universe of perfect intelligence known
[1:22:21] as Elohim, God here on earth he was
[1:22:25] expressed in a body and called his name
[1:22:28] Jesus but Jesus it's just a name but
[1:22:32] here on earth there's no other name
[1:22:34] whereby you must be redeemed back
[1:22:39] because he's like that code he's the
[1:22:42] missing code that without that code you
[1:22:44] can't reconnect back to your to your
[1:22:47] senses of who you actually are because
[1:22:49] your mind and his mind as the wife and
[1:22:52] as the husband And when they come
[1:22:54] together in this day and in this hour,
[1:22:56] remember Christ, the mystery of God was
[1:22:58] God reuniting himself with man, becoming
[1:23:01] one with man so that man could
[1:23:03] understand who he was and who God was as
[1:23:07] one supreme deity and being.
[1:23:11] Thank you.
[1:23:13] Only here we have authorities and and
[1:23:17] and and uh you know hire this and you
[1:23:21] know I'm a boss when I'm at work,
[1:23:25] right? You're a you're you're a boss
[1:23:27] when you're at work. You're you're a
[1:23:30] you're a an employee. You're you're
[1:23:32] you're a father when you're at home.
[1:23:34] You're a mother. You're you're a
[1:23:36] secretary. You're a you're a a machine
[1:23:38] operator. You're all those things. But
[1:23:41] you as an attribute of God once reunited
[1:23:44] with your your you're coming out of your
[1:23:46] amnesia and coming back to who you
[1:23:48] really are, you become God expressed as
[1:23:52] an attribute but with humility
[1:23:56] with love with a submission that goes
[1:23:59] beyond regular submission. Now you're
[1:24:02] now you're a different person. You're
[1:24:04] not you you don't have all of this pride
[1:24:06] and all of this, you know, that I'm I
[1:24:09] know more and I I understand more and
[1:24:11] all all these things.
[1:24:14] Amen. Praise God. A word in season. We
[1:24:17] want to thank God that the word was
[1:24:19] restored because without God sending
[1:24:22] that prophet to the Pentecostal age back
[1:24:25] in 1906 and and right up until 1965, we
[1:24:30] would not have understood God's supreme
[1:24:33] plan of redemption.
[1:24:35] We would not have understood what it was
[1:24:38] to have a real relationship. We would
[1:24:40] have been caught under these doctrines
[1:24:42] and under these denominational teachings
[1:24:45] and teachings of men and everything
[1:24:46] else.
[1:24:48] We don't follow William Brham and his
[1:24:51] teachings.
[1:24:53] We follow the one that he pointed us to.
[1:24:57] He pointed us to the word. And you can't
[1:25:00] have word without being word. You cannot
[1:25:04] connect with the word without being the
[1:25:06] word.
[1:25:09] This is something that that on that day
[1:25:13] you shall know. Amen. That I am in the
[1:25:16] father, ye in me, and I in you. Glory to
[1:25:19] God. Hallelujah.
[1:25:21] Amen. Praise God.
[1:25:24] You know, I've got another quote here.
[1:25:26] Brother Bam, talking about, you know,
[1:25:27] how the home is in crisis. You can
[1:25:29] barely find a Bible in a home anymore.
[1:25:32] You know, the world is in total chaos.
[1:25:34] This is back in 1950. You know, he's
[1:25:37] talking here back in 1958 talking about
[1:25:39] that, you know, you know, our Lord
[1:25:41] predicted such a time to come that there
[1:25:43] would be unrest among the nations. I was
[1:25:45] reading this quote and I said, "Wow."
[1:25:47] You know, I was just doing a search on
[1:25:49] on certain things, crisis in the home
[1:25:51] and stuff like that. And here and I was
[1:25:52] reading this and I said, "Wow, this is
[1:25:54] right now." And and you know, we've
[1:25:56] we're in we're we're among the nations
[1:25:58] perplexed of times, distress between
[1:26:00] nations. And when we've tried everything
[1:26:03] that's seemingly humanly possible to
[1:26:05] make it last just a little longer, but I
[1:26:08] believe that we're running out. I don't
[1:26:10] believe that there's anything else that
[1:26:12] we can do. We're just at the end. And if
[1:26:16] there was ever a time where family and
[1:26:18] and and disruption and and countries and
[1:26:21] and wars and all the things that we're
[1:26:24] at the end, they've tried dictators, it
[1:26:26] doesn't work. They've tried, you know,
[1:26:29] all different kinds of things. It's
[1:26:31] never going to work. It could be over in
[1:26:34] five minutes time that every nation
[1:26:36] would be laid to powder.
[1:26:39] You know that you know Israel attacking
[1:26:41] Iran strategically hitting all of their
[1:26:45] nuclear sites, taking out their nuclear
[1:26:48] scientists. They're strategically
[1:26:50] hitting these things. Netanyahu comes
[1:26:52] out and says it plainly. If we don't
[1:26:54] take these people out and get rid of
[1:26:57] this, these people are going to take
[1:26:59] nuclear power and they're going to try
[1:27:00] and destroy us. We know that these
[1:27:04] things, my God, we can see it's all
[1:27:08] lining up, saints.
[1:27:10] It's it's the world is in absolute and
[1:27:13] total chaos. But he says here, but a
[1:27:15] great crisis. He says, then also we have
[1:27:19] a home life crisis. It seems like that
[1:27:21] home life is running out into shallow
[1:27:24] water. Used to be in a home that the
[1:27:26] father was the head of the house would
[1:27:29] set down of a of a morning and he would
[1:27:32] speak with his family and they would all
[1:27:33] take out the old family Bible and just
[1:27:36] read it a little bit. You don't see that
[1:27:38] no more. And when the day was done and
[1:27:40] ma had the dishes washed, they'd all
[1:27:43] gather in. That's all gone aside.
[1:27:48] Why?
[1:27:50] Because they want to break the influence
[1:27:54] of a father.
[1:27:57] God has ordained fathers for a purpose.
[1:28:02] Next slide. We're going to wind it down
[1:28:04] here. In Joshua chapter 4,
[1:28:07] listen here. He says, "And Joshua said
[1:28:09] unto them, pass over before the ark of
[1:28:12] the Lord your God into the midst of
[1:28:15] Jordan, and take ye up every man
[1:28:20] of you a stone upon his shoulder,
[1:28:23] according unto the number of the tribes
[1:28:25] of the children of Israel."
[1:28:28] God was numbering his men. God was
[1:28:32] showing that he would place upon each
[1:28:35] and every one of those ordained
[1:28:39] for the time and for the season to be
[1:28:42] carriers of the word
[1:28:45] to be those that would have the word of
[1:28:47] God upon their shoulders. Stone means
[1:28:50] revelation
[1:28:52] means understanding of who and what it
[1:28:55] is that they that they're representing
[1:28:57] and who they represent as sons and
[1:28:59] daughters of God. and especially as a
[1:29:01] father, a man. And he says that this may
[1:29:05] be a sign among you that when your
[1:29:07] children ask their fathers,
[1:29:11] who was teaching them? Their fathers.
[1:29:15] I know a mother is listen a mother has a
[1:29:17] great position in the home and and she's
[1:29:20] absolutely
[1:29:22] in in second command when it comes to
[1:29:25] the the the leadership of that home and
[1:29:28] that family because she needs to
[1:29:29] understand the authority of God in the
[1:29:33] home. And when she does she places her
[1:29:36] husband in the position that he is
[1:29:39] responsible for that family.
[1:29:43] You're not doing it in a way like, well,
[1:29:45] you that's your problem. No, she
[1:29:48] understands his position and understands
[1:29:51] that when she submits to that position,
[1:29:54] God comes in and does everything needed
[1:29:57] in order to provide for that home and
[1:29:59] that family.
[1:30:01] It's God. Listen, he is the Lord God
[1:30:04] that provideth all of our needs. He
[1:30:06] provideth all of our needs. I am the
[1:30:08] Lord God that health all your disease.
[1:30:10] Not you deal. You don't heal anything. I
[1:30:13] the Lord do all these things. I have
[1:30:16] spoken it. I will perform it, sayeth the
[1:30:18] Lord. It's not about you doing anything
[1:30:21] but submitting to the authority of God's
[1:30:23] word.
[1:30:26] Hallelujah. And so this is what he was
[1:30:29] saying. Ask their fathers in time to
[1:30:31] come, saying, "What mean ye by these
[1:30:33] stones?
[1:30:35] What did this all represent? Why was it
[1:30:37] that you were given this responsibility
[1:30:40] from God to take on this this position
[1:30:44] in the body as a father
[1:30:47] because God has ordained it thus
[1:30:51] to make man
[1:30:54] be a father
[1:30:56] given the responsibility
[1:30:58] by God himself
[1:31:01] to the individual.
[1:31:11] Next slide.
[1:31:14] In Ephesians chapter 4,
[1:31:17] it says, "And ye fathers,"
[1:31:21] doesn't say mothers, does it say
[1:31:22] mothers? No.
[1:31:25] It says, "And ye fathers, provoke not
[1:31:27] your children to wrath, but bring them
[1:31:30] up in the nurture and admonition of the
[1:31:33] Lord. And if you go and you break that
[1:31:35] all down, bringing them up, it means
[1:31:37] teaching them. Who's the teacher in the
[1:31:40] house? The father,
[1:31:43] you know, I I I look back many years and
[1:31:46] I I realized that I missed I missed out
[1:31:48] in a lot of ways that I didn't, you
[1:31:50] know, I wasn't, you know, I was working
[1:31:51] so much. I got so caught up with the
[1:31:53] with business and everything else. And,
[1:31:56] you know, we could all look back and,
[1:31:57] you know, we'd be we'd be going to ball
[1:32:00] games. We'd be going golfing. we'd be
[1:32:02] going to to this and to that. You know
[1:32:04] that the average uh man only spends
[1:32:07] about 2 to three minutes a week
[1:32:12] one- on-one focused with his children
[1:32:16] because they're so busy with life and so
[1:32:19] busy with with making the money, so busy
[1:32:22] with their their hockey games. They
[1:32:24] spend about 17 hours a week watching TV,
[1:32:28] though.
[1:32:32] and can't even do five minutes with
[1:32:34] their children.
[1:32:36] No, but this is this is the world that
[1:32:38] we're in now. It's been designed
[1:32:40] entertainment and and and the way that
[1:32:42] that everything has been motivated for
[1:32:45] men and for women to get out of their
[1:32:48] rightful godly positions.
[1:32:51] And what who suffers? The children.
[1:32:55] There are more uh single children
[1:32:59] families than ever before and it only is
[1:33:02] only getting worse.
[1:33:05] And it's a proven fact that a woman that
[1:33:08] that is a single mother,
[1:33:12] the highest percentage of poverty is in
[1:33:14] that home
[1:33:17] where the father is missing
[1:33:19] and that woman, you know, is bringing up
[1:33:21] that child by herself. She's in a state
[1:33:25] of poverty on average.
[1:33:30] What is it? Fathers are missing.
[1:33:34] They're missing an action.
[1:33:36] They're getting caught up and distracted
[1:33:38] from their rightful positions. And
[1:33:41] that's why, you know, like, you know, I
[1:33:42] said, it's Father's Day. I'm not here to
[1:33:44] rebuke the fathers. So, don't get it
[1:33:46] wrong. You guys should be rejoicing to
[1:33:48] know that if you're a God called father,
[1:33:50] you've got an authority in your life
[1:33:52] that you can start from this day. If
[1:33:55] it's a little clearer for you today
[1:33:57] after hearing what you've heard that
[1:33:59] you've that you've been positioned
[1:34:00] because you're under the authority of
[1:34:02] God. You've been given an authority,
[1:34:05] then you should be a happy person to be
[1:34:07] able to walk out of here and and to know
[1:34:09] the things that you need to do as a
[1:34:11] father. Amen. to bring more more
[1:34:15] prosperity prosperity and peace and love
[1:34:19] and rest and take the pressure from your
[1:34:21] wives. Your wives should not be, you
[1:34:24] know, being given, well, they're your
[1:34:26] kids. You deal with them. No, they're
[1:34:29] your kids. And the scripture says, "Ye
[1:34:31] fathers," read the next scripture as we
[1:34:34] close here. He says here, he says in
[1:34:37] Colossians 3, "Fathers, provoke not your
[1:34:41] children to anger, lest they be
[1:34:43] discouraged."
[1:34:46] We got to know how to communicate with
[1:34:48] our children. We got to not be in a
[1:34:51] sergeant mode when we're at home. We all
[1:34:54] did it. We all blew up in that area.
[1:34:58] I think back at a lot of times where
[1:35:01] just just it was just all you know
[1:35:03] carnal had no clear revelation. I love
[1:35:07] the Lord but I still had no real you
[1:35:09] know clear revelation on my position as
[1:35:12] a father because I I failed in so many
[1:35:15] ways in those areas.
[1:35:18] I would say things that would pro that
[1:35:20] that would get them angry.
[1:35:23] That's not the way to deal with them.
[1:35:24] But when you do and you take you do you
[1:35:27] know why a father yells at their
[1:35:29] children.
[1:35:31] It's because they're not willing to take
[1:35:32] the time to sit down with them and talk
[1:35:35] to them for a while
[1:35:38] and explain to them.
[1:35:41] They want it to be done instantly. They
[1:35:43] want I told you not to do that. Get out.
[1:35:49] No. It's it's it's because we're we're
[1:35:51] living in a in a time where everything
[1:35:53] is instant. Everything's got to be in
[1:35:55] in, you know, like right now. And if
[1:35:57] you're not listening to me right now,
[1:35:58] you're going to get the belt right now.
[1:36:03] It's because we're not willing to take
[1:36:05] the time
[1:36:07] to communicate, to sit and spend
[1:36:11] real quality time with our children.
[1:36:16] I hope that you know that you you taking
[1:36:18] all of this in the right way. Fathers,
[1:36:21] listen. We listen, we we all made the
[1:36:24] boo boos. We all made the mistakes. But
[1:36:26] you know what? There's nothing wrong
[1:36:28] with sitting down with your children,
[1:36:30] even if they're adults, right now, and
[1:36:31] saying, "Hey.
[1:36:33] We made mistakes. We're human.
[1:36:37] We all make mistakes, but our intentions
[1:36:40] were right. Our intentions were always
[1:36:43] good.
[1:36:45] A real father, mother loves their
[1:36:47] children. There's no way you can
[1:36:49] separate." Listen, if you've got an
[1:36:51] understanding of God's love, you know
[1:36:54] there's nothing that can separate you
[1:36:55] from that love.
[1:36:58] And when a son or a daughter has an
[1:37:00] understanding of their father or
[1:37:02] mother's love, they know that that love,
[1:37:04] they could never be separated from that
[1:37:07] love. Regardless of how angry or how mad
[1:37:11] we get or how foolish sometimes and
[1:37:14] whatever it is, you cannot break that.
[1:37:19] If you have God's love,
[1:37:22] it only takes one to have it. Let's all
[1:37:25] stand. Let the musicians come.
[1:37:34] Happy Father's Day
[1:37:37] to all the fathers out there that have
[1:37:39] an understanding,
[1:37:41] that desire to be
[1:37:44] in line with God's
[1:37:47] interpretation of fatherhood. If you
[1:37:50] have that desire today, you've just
[1:37:52] stepped into a place where all things
[1:37:55] can change and all things are possible.
[1:37:58] You can have a new walk with God. You
[1:38:00] can have a new walk with your families,
[1:38:02] with your children, those that you love
[1:38:07] because you understand that you've come
[1:38:10] under authority
[1:38:12] to the supreme authority
[1:38:15] which is almighty God himself Jesus
[1:38:19] Christ the same yesterday, today and
[1:38:23] forever. Let us pray. Father,
[1:38:26] thank you so much Lord. We can truly
[1:38:30] call you father,
[1:38:33] but in a way, Lord, that's so much
[1:38:36] greater in understanding, Lord. Like,
[1:38:39] we're it's like we're we're we're it's
[1:38:41] more than just you. You're you're our
[1:38:43] father. You're our partner. You're our
[1:38:47] we're one. We we've united by the word
[1:38:50] of God in this day and in this hour,
[1:38:51] Lord, in such a way that it brings us
[1:38:54] into such a fellowship of of divine love
[1:38:57] that that surpasses the understanding
[1:39:00] that we have as human beings. Lord, take
[1:39:03] us and move us and direct our lives in
[1:39:06] the way that you want us to go. Lord, so
[1:39:08] that we can so that we can uh just
[1:39:11] expand upon all of this and be better
[1:39:14] human beings, better fathers, better
[1:39:16] mothers, better children, better
[1:39:18] friends, better bosses, better workers
[1:39:22] in every way, shape, or form. Father,
[1:39:25] Lord, you know exactly where we're at.
[1:39:27] You know exactly who we are, where we
[1:39:30] are. Lord, have your way in our lives.
[1:39:38] We surrender ourselves to you, Father.
[1:39:43] I have a father.

[1:55:00] He lifts weights. Okay. Protecting me.
[1:55:05] He is really kind
[1:55:09] and he also helps me a lot. He also
[1:55:14] you he also he also protects me. My dad
[1:55:20] super power is the power of kindness
[1:55:25] and never for giving up never giving up
[1:55:30] kindness and nice and being nice.
[1:55:39] technology. I guess he is he's a builder
[1:55:45] and he is the and he made a company and
[1:55:50] the company he made is a builder's job
[1:55:54] was the one I was talking about before.
[1:55:57] I said he made a company
[1:56:00] build cupboards. He works in the office.
[1:56:09] Whenever I pretend to laugh, but he asks
[1:56:13] me like to laugh, then I laugh and then
[1:56:16] he starts laughing.
[1:56:18] When we tell him jokes that make him
[1:56:21] laugh,
[1:56:25] he plays with me. What else? Um,
[1:56:31] he makes me and my sister laugh.
[1:56:35] He makes us uh watch movies. He he he he
[1:56:40] provides he he give us food and and he

[1:56:46] we need.

[1:56:56] And and if I had enough and if I could
[1:57:01] pick all the dads in the verbal
[1:57:05] every single person, I would pick the
[1:57:09] dad I have right now.
[1:57:16] I would give him
[1:57:21] something that he always wanted. What is
[1:57:24] it? I don't know. But if I find out and
[1:57:29] I would give it to him if I can.
[1:57:34] I I think I'll buy him a like a a brand
[1:57:40] new house and and I and also a Jeep. My
[1:57:44] family always use having a Jeep.
[1:57:50] Whoa.
[1:57:52] A hammer.
[1:57:55] I mean, it depends. Like, if I grow up
[1:57:58] and have all the money I want, I could
[1:58:00] buy him a house,
[1:58:07] play with him.
[1:58:10] When I went to Florida, then we took
[1:58:13] pictures

[1:58:38] a lot. Can you show us?
[1:59:13] Let's just give them a round of

[1:59:34] bring me the water.
[1:59:37] Yes. Also sometimes he he tries his
[1:59:39] front hand.
