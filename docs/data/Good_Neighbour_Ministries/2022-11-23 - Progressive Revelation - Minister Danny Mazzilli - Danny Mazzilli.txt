praise God forevermore is that your desire tonight [Music] amen God bless you Saints you may be seated thank you thank you brother Bill praise God it's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight I'm trusting that um you've all had a good week up until now and that it's just going to get better from here on in by the grace of God because when we get together in the house of the Lord every single time that you gather Yourself In God's Presence under this type of ministry atmosphere where you're under expectation that the word of God is going to speak to your needs then you will leave much better than you came in and you'll be blessed and you'll you'll understand things better you will grow in the Lord you won't understand why it is that you continue to overcome but it's as a result of you feeding on the word of God and and whether you're here or whether you're there at home watching on YouTube if your faith is to receive something from God you're going to get it it's just as simple as that amen because we're not living in the hour where it's man that's feeding you this is the hour where God is feeding you it's always been that way for the true Sons and Daughters of God they expect to hear from God receive from God Be strengthened by the word of God and overcome by the word of God Amen praise God so tonight we're going to be um we're going to be continuing uh on a on a series that we've started um he's calling my name amen He's Calling My Name I know that you know that uh he's been calling your name otherwise you wouldn't even be here it's it's it's it's a supernatural thing you know this this call Upon Our Lives it's not because we decided to join that church because all the pastor seems to be you know a really good pastor and you know he he really knows how to preach the word that's great that's wonderful if you want to belong to a denominational church but if you're belonging to the body of Jesus Christ it's because something supernatural has taken place in your life and that you know now that you are not in a a membership of a church body but you're actually a part of the mystical body of Jesus Christ amen praise God and so tonight we're going to be um uh looking at uh a thought here next slide uh you can't see it there I guess I don't know why in mine it's it's all blue but for some reason it's oh I see it's not really coming through properly for some reason but that's okay um the thought is on progressive revelation okay that we have been you know when you actually were called of God is because God called you by revelation and so let's just go to uh prayer and then we're going to get into the word amen father we are so grateful tonight Lord that we can assemble knowing that your spirit your presence is with us here tonight Lord and will take control lift us all up into Heavenly places and speak to our needs so that we can leave here different than we than what we were when we came in father that is our desire Lord granted tonight Lord remember our pastor remember the saints that are at home that have needs tonight Lord remember all those that are sick and Afflicted Among Us Lord and won't you just raise them up father all these prayer requests that have come through Lord that child that um that that that fell in in Trinidad Lord I pray that you'll remember that child tonight Lord that your spirit is ministering we know that you're ministering there right now and that you will raise that child up in the name of Jesus Christ Lord we just we just commit all things tonight into your hands Lord we love you we appreciate you we thank you Lord anoint the word speaker and hearer father For Your Glory in Jesus name amen praise God so let's look at the first scripture very familiar scripture okay that that's looking better next slide okay so there may be an issue with the um with the actual file but I'm going to read the scriptures so the scriptures from Hebrews chapter 11 verses 1 to 11. familiar scriptures but I want you to pay attention here while I'm reading the scripture I want you to keep in mind about the thought that we have here tonight that that Revelation is something that is Progressive in our lives amen the progression of Revelation is what we as Sons and Daughters of God are inspired by you can't continue to serve god with passion and with with Zeal and uh you know with with that with that uh motivation uh unless God is inspiring you unless God is revealing himself more and more to you amen and and this whole uh um experience that we're having is leading us into the Rapture and the Rapture itself brother Brown said the Rapture was a revelation but within that Revelation there is progression and the and the progression of the word is never going to stop and wait for anybody it's not going to wait for you you will notice that that uh you know as the word progresses you're going to see some that are just going to be left behind it's it's not because uh you know uh you are better or or any different than anybody else but it's just because you have an attribute of God within you that allows you to receive Revelation to progress into the fullness of the rapture this is not about uh joining a certain church and if you belong to that church you're going to go in the rapture no it's an individual walk with God so pay attention here uh verse one now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen always replace the word faith with revelation okay it's a substance it's something real it's something that that you know that that you don't see it but there's evidence by it living in your life through your life and allowing you to continue to walk this walk with God buy it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear we understand that the word of God has a supernatural power to frame the worlds to frame your world to frame your life to give you everything that you have need of in order to overcome in this Dimension and this walk that you're walking that you're overcoming listen you all have battles every single one of us has battles that we need to overcome we wouldn't be an overcomer if there wasn't something to overcome amen by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead dead yet speaketh God Vindicated by giving a revelation to Abel exactly what it was that was required as the sacrifice and through that experience God was vindicating that Abel had revelation of what he was doing and in the same thing in your life when you offer up your gift your walk your ministry whatever it is that God has placed upon you that when you when you offer it unto the Lord and you're offering it because God has revealed to you your ministry God has revealed to you what he requires God is progressively revelating you to move on with him it testifies that God is in your life and that you're on the right track and it also inspires you to know that you're on the right track perfect Faith listen perfect Revelation is when you can recognize your part in the word and actually see it being fulfilled in your life that's the element that the whole church world out there can't recognize that's not something that they can receive only the attributes of God can actually receive this kind of faith and this kind of perfect faith by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God now we we just read right at the beginning of Hebrews 11 that with that well you're going to see it that without faith it's impossible to please God amen he had a testimony that he pleased God why did Enoch please God because he had the ability to receive faith in his life and actually live it speak it back to God speak it back to the body of Christ that's how you are a nourishment to the body of Christ that's how it is that you edify the body of Christ is when you're able to receive divine revelation of god of what he requires of you to do in the body and then when you do it and you actually act and you because you're hearing you're recognizing now you're acting right it shows that that God is in you because this is not the hour where where man is going to interpret God's word no God is his own interpreter God will make it plain God is going to show exactly what he's going to do because without faith here's the next scripture without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him you know these scriptures they just keep coming to life they just never stop uh you know uh unleashing that progressive revelation that that we are feeding on on a daily basis he that cometh to God must believe that he is you need to know that greater is he that is in you that he that is in the world you need to know that you need to recognize that otherwise you you'll never overcome in this hour because this is the most deceiving hour on the face of the Earth next scripture by faith by Revelation Noah being warned by God of things not yet seen moved with fear fear of God because he came into a real true experience with God and when you have that real true experience with God you will have a fear of God knowing that God knows your life God's watching you God God knows your whole you can't you can't hide he requires that he he requires for you to know that there's nothing that that you should hold back from him there's nothing that you should keep from him there's nothing that that you should be ashamed of if you make mistakes you overcome you you seek re you repent and you seek the Lord and you move on this is how we overcome this is the hour that that that you're you're Justified there's never been a time like this time how are we going to go in the Rapture how are we going to have rapturing faith if if we've got condemnation all around us all the time oh I shouldn't have said that I oh boy I made a big mistake no no just deal with it and get on with your walk deal with it you're this is the hour of maturity where you come into the maturity of the word where you recognize that this is not about play church this is listen there's world events that are taking place right now all around us that are leading us into a tribulation this world is going into Great Tribulation whether you like it or you don't like it it's just the way it is the scripture said that this is where we're headed and so we can't change that so this is this is a time where you need to really know who you are moved with fear prepared an ark for the saving of his house by which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by revelation it's not going to come any other way you know I I often think about like lord it's it's incredible how that passion and that desire and that Zeal for the word of God it's it's it's it's it's there it's a fire it's in my life but it but I come to realize that it's because he keeps giving revelation he's progressively giving Revelation to overcome on a daily basis everything that we face amen this is how you know that you are an attribute of God is because it's not something you do all you do is you you know you you overcome by coming to church by reading the the word by listening to the word by you know by by doing the things that you know are going to feed your relationship with God when you do that God does the rest brother Burnham says that when you go to church Jesus Christ is waiting there for you he's already there waiting for you to come into His presence so that he can speak to you so that he can feed you and give you everything that you have need of so that you can overcome and feel confident as a Son of God feel feel uh uh encouraged by the word of God and know that you are a son or a daughter of God and that you will overcome there's nothing that can take you down not in this hour this is the season where God's going to interpret his word and all he's looking for is yielded vessels that recognize that that have come into perfect revelation of who he is amen praise God by faith verse 8 Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should later receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went think about it Saints you don't know everything that tomorrow holds you don't know that you're gonna go to work next week and and maybe there's going to be a big layoff you don't know that but because you started this walk with God by Revelation and you know that you know that you know that that he's the author and the finisher of your faith that he is Jehovah Jireh that's going to provide all of your Finance you know that you're going to be you've got the same faith that Abraham has when you walk with God in that way and you trust God that much I don't care if you go to work next week and you get laid off God has a better job waiting for you [Music] amen there's nothing too hard for God is there anything too hard for the Lord praise God he didn't know where he was going but by faith verse 9 he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise the same promise you are experiencing the same promise for he looked for a city which hath with hath foundations whose Builder and maker is God everything that that we are working towards and I'm talking about the things here on this Earth all that you do all that that that concerns you your your family your home your job your relationships all those things are being molded and shaped by God for you as an attribute of God you're living in this world but you're not of this world you know it you know for sure how many have been recognizing that more and more you look out there you look at the conditions you look at the situations you look at what's going on around you you know you're not of this world foreign but your world is being controlled and molded and shaped by God by his word we read the scripture the worlds were framed by the word of God everything in your life is Being Framed by God's word you can you can have confidence to know that everything works for good you know that you you go do certain things you build certain things and you make a mistake it's okay it's going to work for good it's got actually going to work for your good how many can look back on their lives now and see all the trials and all the situations and the things that that we've gone through and look back now and see that you know what God has done in your life the character that he's developed in your life the wisdom that he's given you and to know that God worked all those things for good through faith verse 11. and this is a type of you and me Sarah herself received strength conceived seed and was delivered of a child when she was past the age because she judged him faithful who had promised praise God forevermore you can believe for for Supernatural things to take place in your life if sickness comes into your life or comes into your home or comes into your family if God can can reverse Sarah's organs to the point where she can give birth to a child why can't God heal your organs or heal your body or heal your son or heal your daughter or heal your mother or heal your why can't he it's simple why because we are faithful to believe the promises of God Amen praise God and our our next scripture is um is from uh Ephesians chapter 3 verses three to six it says how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as I wrote a four in few words whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ which in other Ages was not made known Unto the Sons of men as it is now revealed unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit that Gentiles should be fellow heirs that's you and me and the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel praise God forevermore listen something must take place now we're talking about progressive revelation things something has to take place in order for something else to take place that's how things work and if you look back this whole Bible from Genesis to revelation is God giving progressive revelation that's going to lead us into the Rapture in this day and in this hour we need to recognize the season of the word we're not looking for Moses we're not looking for for Jeremiah or Isaiah or John the Baptist no no no we are looking for the rapture we are in the season of The Rapture after the Rapture we are three and a half years in Fellowship with the Lord and the Saints for three and a half year honeymoon but guess what we got to come back and there's going to be another thousand years of time ouch but not for you and me yeah we have to come but we will be in Eternal bodies it'll be a lot different than the way we are right now it's been a progression of Revelation coming down from Genesis all the way down to this day and this time and this season and so you're either in progression or regression your walk is either progressing with God or you're standing still or you've gone back this is the hour where the word is moving on the truth is moving on and you have to recognize that you're in that progression that you're in the Rapture by Revelation and you're waiting upon Revelation lying upon lying precept upon precept when you come into the house of the Lord you are receiving Supernatural strength by the word of God to be translated your your cells are being changed you are now in the state of transformation you are going to be changed this Mortal shall put on immortality that can only happen by the supernatural word of God people talk about the Rapture but you have to be in it you have to be experiencing it by the word you have to be a part of the body of Christ you've got to belong to a church where you know that you are feeding on divine revelation that you're being revelated and inspired and you're receiving the stimulation that comes from the Revelation that's what that's how you know that you know that you know that you're being changed that you're not just a church member you're not just by by tradition you're you go to church once a week or twice a week or whatever it is this is not tradition this is Supernatural change that's taking place right now in the body of Christ every single person on Earth has a place in the word of God including the atheist there's everything that that that that that we know that we read in the word of God we're seeing it being manifest and being fulfilled in the world around us as the word progresses everyone's placing in the word becomes evident your progression in the word you're walking with God and your your personal experience with God shows where you are in the season of the word that's why we have to take inventory every now and then that's why you know uh it starts right here in the house of the Lord where God speaks to us and gets us to do a checkup you know and it's not a checkup like the doctor it's a checkup from the neck up what's going on inside here and what's going on inside there to find out where you really are where like where's your experience with God how real is it to you do you know that you're being changed you know that change is taking place in your life do you know that that that that that that you're progressing in the word of God only attributes of God can recognize this this is the thing that is a bit of a paradox as an attribute of God you will recognize the supernatural element that's taking place every time you feed on the word of God every experience that you your walk is is is every day all the everything that you're doing as an attribute of God you are conscious of God you are conscious of God this is is lazy this thing here it'll it'll pull you in directions that you don't want to go it gets tired it gets angry it gets you upset before you know it you've got you you get into little you know little uh struggles with with uh with your friends with your family sometimes with your brothers and sisters and and and you wonder you know like but that's this that's that's understanding the difference of of what it is to be a Son of God to be a daughter of God and what it is to be a human being we need to be you know spiritually minded but we also need to be Earthly minded we can't be all spiritually minded you can't be totally 100 spiritual and live in this earth you'll be miserable you'll be fighting constantly people will be looking at you and they don't want to be around you because all you talk about is Jesus this Jesus that oh you know you need to change this you need to change you're condemning people all the time you don't sin in your life there's sin here that's in there it's the grace of God that you are where you are tonight you didn't do anything to deserve revelation it's God that gives Revelation it's God that gives faith it's him that gives you the ability to progress and to look at tomorrow and overcome tomorrow and deal with next week and next year and everything else that you've got to deal with amen you can react to the word but there is a huge difference to reacting whether it is by fear or whether it is by faith some people react by fear some people are living you know and and and and all their decisions are based on fear as Sons and Daughters of God if you're going to fear anything fear God but don't fear anything else do not fear what man can do but fear what God can do and know that God can make all things possible to them that believe it's one thing to be able to recognize the word of God and act upon the word of God and then there's one and then there's people that that that that will recognize the word of God and react to the word of God there's two different things acting is knowing what to do with the word reacting is fear oh I don't know how how am I going to deal with this how am I going to deal with that pray one knows what to do with the word the other one guesses and is wondering we we're not Wanderers praise God Amen Hallelujah this is this is the time in the season where the revelation of the word and you know we've been feasting these last you know well it just it's just constant you know we're we're blessed that we have the ability to to Feast on the word of God under a pastor that that is inspired that that comes here yields himself sets himself aside and then you having faith you start pulling on that word and and and we recognize how it is that we are being uh uh revelated by the word of God to overcome the situations that we're dealing with on a daily basis and you know there's you know there's many uh controversies that are going on right now even within the message you know about you know like situations where oh you can just belong to a tate Ministry actually you should just belong to a tape Ministry you should only be listening to the prophet that's nonsense we listen to the prophet we hear the the we quote the prophet listen here's a quote right now in front of me here God is his own interpreter now remember you Christians were his thoughts before there was a world and you are the manifestation of his thinking before there even was a world you were in Christ amen in God in the beginning that makes you then you see his subjects and the whole thing is God himself materializing himself tangible so he could be handled seen and so forth and that's what God is the whole thing and that's from 1964 God is his own interpreter and she and people want to what want to tell us and say that all you just you just you just you just push play and you only listen to the prophet and you don't need to be under a Ministry so all of a sudden God is only speaking through tapes no and that's the thing that's that's that's where like it doesn't even make sense to me God took a mule and spoke through a mule to Balaam and so now all of a sudden God is only speaking through the tapes that's not my experience with God I hear God speaking through people that I just first meet sometimes you will hear God speak in all aspects of your walk you know um I was listening to you know uh uh you know I was listening to a testimony on the voice of God and the testimony was a was about a brother in the Congo and he he's a pastor of a tape Church now I want you to catch what I'm saying here okay I'm not putting anything down I'm I'm bringing a thought and a point here that that really blessed me when when God revealed it to me he's a pastor of a tape Church in a small City in the Congo and what happened was he had ruptured blood vessels and needed immediate surgery and so they went that he could not get to the church for the immediate surgery so a bunch of Believers got together and they put on the message uh um a message from 1961 faith and they all anointed him with oil and after the tape they listened to the tape they anointed him with oil they prayed over him he was healed and it was a wonderful testimony praise God of course God can do that why can't God do that God honored their faith God showed that he was present because he meets Faith he gives Revelation to the individuals if he wants to heal that person he gives them a revelation of their healing and they're healed yeah did it have to come through the tapes absolutely not because it's God God could do it through the tapes is the tape Ministry fine sure it's fine if that's what they want to do but if somebody raises up in that Ministry that gets the anointing on them to preach the word and to quote the pastor then there's absolutely nothing wrong with that because that is the mystical body of Jesus Christ and we cannot put a boundary on that so that when so if somebody comes to me and says no brother no no you you don't need to be under and it's happened somebody has actually said that to me no no no you need to be listening to the tapes you should not be under a pastor I said what I said what are you gonna do you get to sit and argue with them I said well brother I you know I understand that that's your interpretation on it but I'm doing just fine because because God feeds me I listen to brother Branham every day every single day I listen to brother Branham and I feed on it and he speak and God speaks to me through those messages all the time but I go to church I got a I got a pastor I'm a part of the body of Christ I'm receiving perfect faith in my walk with God because I'm experiencing God in my personal walk in my day the day that I'm living in I don't need I I don't need other people's experiences I'm having my own I know God in the power of his resurrection and that's what's taken me in the rapture I don't got time to to argue with people and to spend time telling them well this is no brother you you know you're wrong you're this you're that not this that's not the hour for that we've gone way beyond that God doesn't want you to get caught up into those things if you want to have fellowship with them you want to share what's on your heart give them your testimony if the Holy Spirit wants to speak to them he's going to change them turn them around and and put them right on the right track it's not it doesn't mean that they're lost it just means that they're in a certain time and in season and condition in their lives and they need to progress because there's progressive revelation that will take you out of that kind of that kind of of confusion amen absolutely we can't stay in that kind of confusion we support the voice of God we support the tablets we support that work it's a it's a fantastic those tablets are fantastic I rejoice in them that are receiving them because God can speak to them and God can lead them and direct them and if that's where their faith is and that's all that they have need of in order to be raptured off this Earth I'm not telling God what to do you can't tell God what to do God has every single son and daughter of God chosen from before the foundations of the world you can't change any of it you can't do nothing to change any of it so all of a sudden now you've got to have only a certain way that that that that the message has to go out and no no we will not come under that kind of confusion but we need to understand it we need to understand why there is that these things are happening right around us but if we're walking with the Lord and we want to we want to be uh you know walking with confidence we want to know where we stand we need to know where we stand and that we are not going to be uh told how we are going to receive the word and how that we are going to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and how that we are going to no God is his own interpreter [Applause] amen in 1962 brother Branham says now this is the house that God dwells in not a building with a big Bell on top of it and a high steeple see but a body thou has prepared me a body that God can dwell in God can walk in God can see in God can talk in God can work in amen living instrumentally of God this is the hour that we are living in this is what we are feasting on this is the progressive revelation that is giving us the overcoming power and the ability to overcome amen hallelujah you can't put listen if you come into a situation where you're talking with somebody and they believe oh it's just take this ministry or whatever and they want to put you outside the circle don't worry just draw the circle a little bigger and say brother I'm going to make it bigger and I'm not drawing you outside because I believe that revelation will take you exactly where you need to go amen I'm gonna love you I'm gonna pray for you I'm gonna believe that God is able because this is the season of the Capstone Ministry Saints we are not living in the days of man where where it's it's all about the missionary and getting out there and and going into the it's it's being done God is doing it regardless God has his way of reaching and and we are a part of that we're doing it we're we're actively involved in those things amen praise God but this is the hour where God is becoming real to individuals amen praise God God is living in us hallelujah praise God forevermore so I'm not going to put anybody outside I don't want that kind of a spirit I don't want to have that kind of a spirit that's going to put people outside no we need to understand that God gives revelation God reveals in his time and season and he makes all things beautiful in his time and season amen praise God glory to God how can we limit God in any way he is the he is only obligated to his word and Revelation cometh by hearing the word not hearing with your physical ears because almost everyone can hear but it's a different thing when you can hear and recognize the ministry and the mysteries of God unto you it has been given to know the Mysteries can you see now how important it is to recognize that you have an attribute that you have a receiver it's the attribute that receives Revelation by the way did you know that it's the attribute that the Deep call to the deep that that that that that responds your conscious mind is only conscious of what's going on but it's the attribute that connects and receives the word and overcomes in you that's the greater that is in you he that is greater than he that is it's the attribute that's what's overcoming every sin every situation sin cannot stay on you sin cannot be imputed upon you blessed is the man whom God doesn't even impute iniquity that was a revelation that David received that that Revelation and realized oh my God nothing can separate nothing can separate us from the love of God yeah praise God forevermore so I looked up we're going to be closing here in a couple minutes so I looked up what it is a definition of progressive revelation and this is what I found progressive revelation is the doctrine in Christianity it's they call it a Doctrine because this is off the internet that the sections of the Bible that were written later contain a fuller revelation of God than the earlier sections there's a lot of Truth in that because there's revelation you're wondering how in the world is this body going to be changed how is it going to be you know changed from Mortal to immortal you know It's Supernatural you can't really quite put a mental scientific explanation on it but revelation changes everything Revelation makes all things possible all God has to do is change your body all you have to do is give you a revelation of the body change and in a moment that's why it's going to be in a moment in the twinkling of an eye because it's going to be a revelation that's going to instantly change your body you see what I'm saying so uh so they believe that God didn't tell people his entire plan all at once as they would not be able to handle it and that's why this Progressive walk with God and God had it this way that that the word when when we go back to Genesis right from the very beginning and look at even in the days when Jesus came on the earth and and what he was revealing and what he was doing and manifesting amongst the people and now here we've been progressing from the you know through the through the seven Church ages and and and come down all the way to this time and season we can see that that God has progressively been feeding you and I in this day and in this hour to take us fully through to the rapture it's a supernatural event glory to God Amen Let The Musicians come so without a receptor in you sorry you're not going to be changed it's as simple as that but can I tell you that you've got one or that you don't have one that's not up to me that's up to God had a plan it's called The Plan of Redemption all that the father hath given me Jesus said will come not one of them is going to be left behind every single son and daughter of God my sheep will hear my voice and it's not a literal voice but it is revelation that is constantly being given for us to overcome from day to day to day you know while brother branham's message was taking place and brother Branham was preaching and talking about the calling out of the Bride and you know talking about that that that uh this day this scripture is being fulfilled before their eyes talking about God meeting a type with Abraham and then lot and his wife and his children coming out of Sodom and Gomorrah all everything that he was saying the world the church world was hearing all of those things and yet there was still a Billy Graham on the Earth there was still an Oral Roberts on the Earth but yet God was showing in 1963 when he came down that time would be no more time would be no more for those types of churches but not for the bride actually we've got time like I said we're going to be coming in here for another Thousand Years and we're going to be in that element of time but we'll be in Supernatural bodies but the whole thought here is that everything is going on around us things are still happening around us but the word is taking the church out of the world supernaturally taking one here taking one there everything is still going on time shall be no more we're living in a in a time and in a season where we're feasting on the Eternal Word of God but the rest of the world is going on in time everything looks normal in the rest of the world but not in your life not in your situation in your ministry we belong to a Supernatural Ministry Saints we don't belong to a church we belong to the body of Christ this local body right here and we're blessed to be a part of it and it's because of progressive revelation God feasting and feeding us his children praise God God bless you Saints I trust that these few words were an encouragement to you let us pray father we're so grateful tonight Lord that this wonderful process this walk with you lord it's not something that we started but we're a part of it now there's nothing we can do to change it we're a part of it Lord we rejoice in it father we're excited Lord to know that tomorrow is a brand new day and that you will give us the strength and the faith to overcome every circumstance every situation everything that we have need of Father we thank you for that Lord we ask that you would just continue to bless and prosper this ministry oh God continue to pour out your word and your spirit Lord over these next few weeks as as the brothers come Lord Brother Tim this Sunday and brother Philip next Wednesday and brother
