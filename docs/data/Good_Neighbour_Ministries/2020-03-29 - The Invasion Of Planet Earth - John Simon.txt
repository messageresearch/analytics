TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] our gracious Heavenly Father we pray for your blessings on this service here today Oh God forgive us of our sins and blesses unknowing to God your servant with the power and blessing of the Holy Spirit as we minister under the present conditions we pray for our prime minister and his dear wife and children we also pray dear God for all leaders that are above us in authority I also pray Lord Jesus for my fellow ministers around the world I pray for my fellow believers that are waiting on the coming of the Lord preserve them Oh God bless them and keep them give them a wonderful Sunday Sun rise in the presence of Almighty God for me ask it in Jesus name Amen I will read the scriptures at this time out of Revelation chapter 9 verses 1 and 2 and the fifth angel sounded and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit and he opened the bottomless pit and there arose out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the Sun and air were darkened by the reason of the smoke of the pit and from the book of Revelation chapter 12 verse 12 therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he but a short time friends today I'm going to be brief I'm reaching out and I will not get into anything too doctrinal on Wednesday night at 7:30 teaching will be given for my local church good morning friends I'm pastor John Simon of Good Neighbor ministries of Burlington Ontario just an old-fashioned preacher just trying to be a good neighbor by ministering this sermon this word of warning to help my fellow citizens in knowing what to do and how to live in this dark hour of fear anxiety and crisis our entire world is now under an invasion and we are all now under attack many world leaders have used the phrase we're at war they say it but do not fully understand what kind of war it is our governments are under attack our economic system is stretched to the breaking point our churches and their ministers are even being hindered from their ministry our culture and Wale way of life is under attack we are facing the breakdown of marriages that break down of families and the fabric of our society is straining under pressure now with the presence of this code at 19 every individual is personally under attack your body your mind with fear and worry and your soul with doubt and unbelief we are all experiencing an invasion and some are calling out the army to defend us a good friend of mine told me he saw the tanks rolling into the city armored vehicles great guns many soldiers but we are not fighting an army of tanks bombs and bullets we are under invasion but not by an army of planes or rockets missiles or millions of men I want you to know seriously today folks that as I speak planet Earth is now being invaded by an unseen army and that is my topic here today the invasion of planet Earth [Music] we're experiencing right now a pandemic of biblical proportions in the book of Exodus we are told of a great final horrible plague and we seen and read and heard about the plagues that fell upon that sinful nation of Egypt that was in rebellion against our God Jehovah in my view our present condition we can see is rebellious and that we live on a sinful planet a planet and a world system that is arrogant with its power with its greed and with its selfishness that system is now experiencing somewhat of a biblical plague of viral infestation by unseen armies straight from the pit of hell unseen armies of disease demons evil spirits sin and death it is written in the scriptures for all to read for all the take note Ephesians chapter 6 verses 11 to 13 put on the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand in the evil day and having done all to stand well the whole armour of God is the whole Word of God it's the whole revelation of God's Word that is our defense that is our great wall of defense that protects us from all the works of Satan and his evil cohorts now let me ask the question what is a virus I added to my computer I checked on Google and here is the answer that I receive biologically of course Google says it's a microscopic parasite predominantly viruses have a reputation for being the cause of contagion spread disease and even death a microscopic infective agent that is able to multiply itself within the living cells of a host that is what is a virus now that's speaking physically biologically now I want to speak digitally as if we're talking about computers but I'm making a spiritual application at the same time it says a computer virus is a piece of code which is capable of copying itself and typically having the effect of corrupting an entire computer system and destroying its data when your computer is under attack do you do the first thing you want to do is to call it Jim and when your mind your body is under attack I'll advise you to do the same thing call a technician call on Jesus Christ call ungodly men ministers of the gospel that can render prayer service healing to you if of course cop I believe doctors and the work they do it's wonderful and it's marvelous they have their place and we as ministers have our place and together we can accomplish much for the glory of God now if you have a computer and it's under attack you also want to depend on your firewall we as Christians we depend on our firewall of the great Holy Spirit of the Living God who puts a wall of fire about us and that's why Christians do not have the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind again if your computer is under attack you deploy an antivirus software to search and destroy certainly we ought to ask the great Holy Spirit there's an old song that says search me O God and cleanse my heart today see if there be any wicked way in me amen cleanse me from every sin and set me free that is what we want God to do in our hearts we place in there in the computer a software that will D crap affiant and delete every virus and everything that is corrupting your system and here we want the Holy Spirit to come in our lives to t crappy fire lines from every wrong thing that we have done and with our humility and prayer for forgiveness we would but ask God to delete our sins by placing them in the sea of his forgetfulness as he has said let's ask him to uninstall any program any action in our lives that may open gateways for demons Devils viruses of the spirit world to get into your system now we all know that when physically you our body is under attack you need to get a checkup and if you are suffering right now from an attack of kovat 19 you urgently need to get a checkup spiritually every Christian every believer every person if you're in doubt of your standing with God you need a checkup and right person to check you up is the Blessed holy spirit I will also ask you to trust your doctor to give you the best viral medicines and to help you with your immunity wash your hands a Christian is asked to wash his hundred cleanse your soul in the blood of the Lamb he says and I will pass I will pass over you we are asked also to isolate and socially distance ourselves as advised by the government and our medical authorities certainly we also ought to clean up our surroundings and disinfect roundabouts you and lastly monitor yourself every person should monitor their health to see where it is and at the first sign of an attack take steps to have a recovery by trusting your doctor by going for a check-up by washing your hands by practicing social distancing by cleaning up and monitoring yourself constantly and consistently now the minister I must bring to your attention that we are living in the Generation X Generation X is described as the right so insanity could believer those that they should have a firewall should by taking the Word of God within their heart that is the protection God gave them in the garden but they doubted God's Word they walked away from God's Word ring and terror you know that by placing the Word of God in our hearts as David said that he puts the Word of God in his heart that he will not I and we also ask God to fill us with his blessed Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit in us with this baptism of fire of the Holy Spirit he becomes air to fire it certain in the scriptures forsake not the assembling of yourselves together as the manner of some is now a true believer knows they need a personal connection to God you also need a connection to a group you need to be connected to a church or a community of faith somewhere it's alright to believe but you must all wrong a real believer knows they need a god-sent man of God or minister in their life and in these times of natural and spiritual pandemonium and infestation and contagion of sin everyone needs to be in the care of the best doctor there is today I want to recommend to you a marvelous and a wonderful doctor I'll give you his name and I trust that you rush to him run to him as quickly as you can I believe in his office there is still room I want to recommend Jesus Christ as the very best doctor for your soul mind and body yes let me repeat his name is Jesus and it is on public record that he's the only doctor that never lost a patient and that is the only lawyer that never lost a case among many other wonderful names he is called a great physician while here on earth there was no disease or sickness that he could not cure he cures all diseases of soul mind and body if your sin sick if you feel lost and hopeless don't give up don't give in and if you've had a setback with your life your home your business I say don't give up don't give up if you have that setback because if you believe you can experience a wonderful comeback where there is life there is always hope repent come to Jesus now turn your heart over to him God loves you and I love you and that's the way it should be are you having battles of the mind you suffering from nervous tension come to dr. Jesus by confessing your sins to him if this covet 19 virus or any other sicknesses don't be fearful only believe all things are possible to them that believe believe God's Word also believe in the power of prayer if you have a Bible right now place your hands on it while I pray if you have no Bible place your hands upon your heart while I pray Heavenly Father it's bringing it in their heart I pray that you will reach out your hands of mercy and touch them when they are heeled that man healed that woman raised up that teenager break that habit Lord O God raised him up out of a sickbed answered a prayer for their loved ones in the name of Jesus Christ I ask it amen and amen there's an old song that says and I'll try to sing it the best I can as I said I'm an old fashioned preacher my voice cracks if it doesn't sound professional that's wonderful I just love the Lord and I love to preach pray and sing for his glory he for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities surely bore all of our sorrows and by His stripes we are healed if you can believe God right now be healed in the name of Jesus Christ friends in the midst of this vision of planet Earth by Satan spirits of disease wickedness lies and licentiousness let us remember the lessons of Pearl Harbor as you know Pearl Harbor was under attack by Imperial Japan they were attacking the American naval base in Hawaii was about 8 a.m. on Sunday morning December 7 1941 now listen and pay attention to this this impending pawn to US forces they were warned about the enemy and that the enemy was planning to invade but they ignored the warning I hope you do not ignore God's warning they knew the enemy was assembling ships planes men and munitions but yet they sat there ripe for invasion why they ignored the warning and so is it today churches are ignoring the warning the peoples of the earth have been repeatedly warned of the coming of plagues and of coming judgement and a world to come planet Earth was warned by many sermons of God throughout the centuries but they ignored the warnings many even laughed at men of God burnt them at the stake boiled them in oil court drawn court to them call them all manner of names some have said nonsense you're just a gloom and doom preacher some have even said you're mad but on on Pearl Harbor it is said they had a big dance party and I believe that's the way this world is going now stumbling on a drunken state in a drunken party attitude enjoying itself let's lift a day for tomorrow we die with no thought that after death there comes a judgement from the presence of Almighty God military officers were busy giving passes for members of the military to attend this great marvelous dance as they thought which trucks were rolling in I can see them filled with beer and wine and all manner of spirits for that party for they were going to have a wonderful time in in their view that was life that was real living meanwhile the enemy fleet was drawing closer and closer danger was at the door sin was at the door plagues was at the door sickness was at the door death was at the door but they failed to heed the warning anyone who tried to warn them as I'm trying to warn you were mocked you were laughed at as us in our modern day jokes about preachers on the on the TV or on radio oh that preacher was preaching about the end of the world about plagues and and prophecies and all these things but friends though they prophecy waits and delays it shall come to pass according to the Word of God heaven earth will pass away but my word will never pass away you gloom and doom old fashioned preacher you you may not say it but you may think it but one night on that night before the attack on Pearl Harbor my friends as I said they partied all night they accused the preacher of fear-mongering the next morning when the alarm was given most were found in a drunken stupor others were fast asleep and so could not answer the call because they fail to heed the warning and so it is at the coming of the Lord over two thousand years ago Jesus already prophesied and said what would happen here are its words for nation shall rise against nation this is 2000 years ago and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places all these are the beginning of Sorrows in ordinary language it's of the coming of the itself its face these are just signs not a of the Tribulation Period Matthew 22 8 he also said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man they did eat they drank they married weddings they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark just as are they eating drinking partying womanizing having a great time while danger is at the door invasion is upon us that devil is upon you sickness is upon you sorrow trouble nervous tension is upon you heart heart attacks at a higher rate than ever before anxiety mental problems everything is upon us at this time the Bible tells us likewise also was it in the days of God they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded see they were caught up with business they occupied have no time for God when he says even the wealth you have I give you the power to get wealth and he says if I give it I can also take it away heed the warning lest you fall in the hands of an angry god but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed I believe that is this day I believe that is this hour at any moment our Lord Jesus can come at any moment that Saints of the Living God can be raptured out of here friends ER is late it's late on God's time peace please don't turn away while I'm preaching from what you're hearing here today I'm not here to preach psychology to you I'm not here to tickle your ears I'm here to preach the truth to you and many times the real medicine that you need is not sweet it may be bitter not only in your mouth but right down into your stomach don't turn away from what you're hearing today folks check your life check it against the Word of God and see how your life lines up with God's measuring stick how measure your life let the Holy Spirit come to your heart speak to you you may have even been thinking that you need to turn your life around you need to change your lifestyle you need to change the way of your way of living just come asking me of his forgiveness right where you are you can bow your head and if you're somewhere where you can't bow your head you in on the inside you can bow your heart in humility to God say lord dear Lord forgive are you just a church member trusting in just attending a church will save your soul or just a churchgoer please search your heart today are you truthful church member are you honest church member are you sincere as per God's forgiveness ask him for his cleansing power and in conclusion for protection against this deadly virus covet 19 let me repeat we are all required by our various levels of government to check ourselves for any symptoms of the virus whether its kovat 19 or sin 666 let us check ourselves check or bodies and search our hearts and see whether we truly be in the faith and if we truly believe the Word of God as it is written in the Bible we are encouraged by our government to wash our hands wash our hands with water I also encourage you not just to do that but wash yourself with the washing of the waters of the Word of God ask God to clean up every condition in your life we're asked by our government to have some social distances distancing or to socially isolate ourselves and monitor ourselves continuously especially if we were out of the country and we've just returned it is imperative and important that we heed the warning your health and your salvation of course is an individual affair you may say to me well pastor Simon mind your business well my business is really God's business and I'm about my father's business I'm part of the company of God and sons and that is why I'm here speaking to you and with you here today in these troublesome and dangerous times it is shocking to me to realize that there are some who still believe that this is all a joke this is all a conspiracy but regardless of what conspiracy theories you may hear all the jokes and making light of the directives you've received spiritually about the Word of God and the warnings out of God's Word I want to encourage you here today heed the warning but naturally and spiritually take the test get yourself treated immediately most of all get the vaccine as soon as it is available but spiritually I want you to know that the vaccine for sin has always been available and it's available for anyone who wants it and you can have it now just ask God to forgive you of your sins repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins and he will baptize you and give you the presence of the Holy Spirit within your life again I refer to another well-known song there is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins where sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains may you lose all your virus symptoms right now even while you are listening to me in the name of Jesus Christ and may you also lose all your sin stains that have stained and sullied your life leave your past behind you're a better person than you think you are god bless you all today I'm Pastor John P Simon and this life stream is brought to you sponsored by good neighbor ministries Burlington Ontario along with its faithful friends and supporters if God is willing I'll be here again with you next Sunday same time same place meanwhile he God's warning god bless you [Music]
