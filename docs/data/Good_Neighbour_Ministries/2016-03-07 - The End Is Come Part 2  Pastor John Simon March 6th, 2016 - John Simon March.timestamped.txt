[0:00] the guts right the gods which is maybe
[0:03] Germans uh or austrians and stuff they
[0:07] start fleeing to intelliness that
[0:09] fleeing the road and flooding Rome and
[0:12] at first they they blocked the borders
[0:14] and everything else like that and they
[0:16] wouldn't let them in because they used
[0:17] to fight against those very Germans you
[0:20] know but then when it got really bad
[0:23] what did the Emperors decide he's going
[0:26] to open the door and receive all these
[0:29] Gods inside and that was a symbol or a
[0:33] start of the fall of the Roman Empire
[0:37] Mass migration because of War the next
[0:42] thing was
[0:44] the rise of Christianity and the loss of
[0:48] traditional Roman values
[0:50] back then it started to break down
[0:54] the country broke down because they lose
[0:56] their traditional balance now it's
[0:58] reverse the others yes Christianity is
[1:01] breaking down yes and the nation is
[1:03] losing its Christian violence yes amen
[1:05] this is what is taking a blimps and
[1:07] lastly the weakening of the army because
[1:12] they started to hire mercenaries today
[1:15] they called them up contractors private
[1:19] contractors and so money was going out
[1:22] and the nation's failed I want you to
[1:25] see that comparison so that you can see
[1:28] how modern events are made clear by
[1:32] prophecy and by history if you can look
[1:34] back you can literally see what is going
[1:38] to happen and what is happening and
[1:40] interpret your season and your time of
[1:43] what is actually
[1:45] taking place Hallelujah amen praise God
[1:50] brother sister
[1:52] I'll tell you here in the Genesis
[1:54] chapter 35
[1:56] verse 34 he saw
[1:59] one crucial moment he had when he had to
[2:02] decide
[2:04] if he's going to take that massive
[2:05] package or not is that right and as a
[2:09] result you stole this verse right now
[2:11] every one of us is presented with the
[2:13] same Choice are you going to take the
[2:16] mess of the world's population the world
[2:18] is going to feed you you know they're
[2:20] going to get two jobs they're going to
[2:21] get you opportunity you joining to drink
[2:23] with every person there swear go down to
[2:26] the hotels in the bars with them and
[2:28] slap the boss on the back and
[2:30] smoke the cigars together yeah you want
[2:33] to get jobs
[2:42] you know but let me tell you one moment
[2:45] of mistake and you want to suffer a
[2:47] lifetime of regret
[2:49] and this is the choice you have to make
[2:51] and we are presented with the same
[2:53] choices whether we will go the way in
[2:55] the world and accept their Rewards or we
[2:59] will take them away with the Lord
[3:01] despise you amen take nobody with the
[3:05] Lord's response you the Bible says in
[3:07] Hebrews 12 17 for he is
[3:11] of repentance even though he sought it
[3:15] carefully with tears once you cross a
[3:19] certain line after a while my friends
[3:21] that doesn't matter anymore you cross
[3:24] the line and there you pass the place of
[3:27] no return
[3:29] lastly as I close off this message
[3:32] the Airness of
[3:35] one man
[3:36] was marching on the street
[3:39] with a black car and of the world the
[3:44] end of the world the end of the world
[3:46] you know what the next day
[3:49] they found him
[3:51] that he was dead in his house while he
[3:54] was censored
[3:55] is that again that something was coming
[3:57] but it was the end of his word
[4:00] but you know
[4:02] life started and life has to happen
[4:07] for his appointment of the man wants to
[4:10] die
[4:11] and after this the judgment
[4:14] the art is going to come when your
[4:17] rights are going to roll back in your
[4:19] head
[4:20] and The View
[4:23] the midst of death
[4:25] lays upon your foreign
[4:40] comes
[4:47] for you
[4:49] to those for me you see the Bell Tolls
[4:53] and when that part comes
[4:57] in the words of a Great Western
[5:00] troubadour
[5:02] together as a man dress himself up in a
[5:05] short pants like he's gone after school
[5:07] days I think you're going to deceive
[5:09] that
[5:16] you can't deceive death
[5:19] one man heard that death was coming for
[5:22] him
[5:23] and he decided that he if he could get
[5:25] past that one day he will be able to
[5:28] live so he locked up the doors of his
[5:30] house
[5:31] sustainable house because somebody in a
[5:34] chair from the side is gonna dead by
[5:36] drowning
[5:38] and he locked his house up and said we
[5:40] could pass through the day he'll be fine
[5:42] well come towards the evening six
[5:45] o'clock fast now he says hey he got over
[5:47] it and everything else cleaned the
[5:49] windows open and everything else now he
[5:51] goes to the washboard to watch his face
[5:53] and when he did that collapse at the
[5:55] same time you don't know for what reason
[5:57] he breathing
[6:01] it's just a handful of water
[6:04] took him to his nostrils
[6:06] you see when is the time comes for you
[6:09] to go you have to go yes regardless of
[6:12] who you are
[6:14] is

[6:28] talking this morning about my wife's
[6:30] uncle uh his aunt her aunt who's still
[6:33] alive who's always sickly and me and
[6:36] those who got me treated there and he
[6:38] was a man that was so vibrant and
[6:40] everything else left back and tell me
[6:41] what the medicine and this thing he said
[6:42] oh come on I mean I'm strong right I'm
[6:45] strong I'm healthy and everything else

[9:52] December of yourselves together
[9:57] talking together sharing our faith one
[10:00] with the other encouraging one another
[10:03] building up one love encouraging one
[10:06] another
[10:07] paying your time to giving your
[10:09] offerings there's a reason why God tells
[10:12] us to do that is to give you a liberal
[10:15] spirit
[10:16] and get you out of the spirit of all
[10:18] Scrooge
[10:20] where everything is me me me me me
[10:22] and take you out of your state of the
[10:26] human condition of suffering from eye
[10:29] trouble everything is
[10:32] right so so God wants to take away your
[10:35] eye trouble they'll get the scouts under
[10:37] your eye right and make you into a
[10:41] balanced person praise the Lord amen so
[10:44] pay your tithes give offerings above
[10:47] your tithes don't just say oh I've been
[10:49] my times I love my juice that's it no
[10:51] you must be such a liberal person that
[10:54] you will have a stream of Living Water
[10:56] that's constantly giving giving given
[10:58] giving sometimes when you don't have no
[11:00] real natural reason to give amen foolish
[11:06] because we help this one we hope that
[11:08] one we give to that point we give to
[11:10] that one what pops out of one said there
[11:13] is he that seemeth as if he scattered
[11:20] because the poor you sow is the more you
[11:24] reap amen we're not sowing because we
[11:27] want to have human Acclaim and for
[11:28] people to know what we do for God is
[11:30] here yes yes God knows everything that
[11:33] we do
[11:34] secretly or publicly he knows all about
[11:37] it amen so always have a liberal spirit
[11:39] because a liberal spirit is always given
[11:42] telling God that I believe you and I
[11:45] trust you that you have never stopped
[11:47] the flow of my source of supply and

[12:33] being a church member it's not doing
[12:35] anything with whether you believe the

[12:39] says you need to us believe and you also
[12:41] need to be loved amen
