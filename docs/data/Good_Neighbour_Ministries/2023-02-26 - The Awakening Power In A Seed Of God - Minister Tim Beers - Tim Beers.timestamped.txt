[42:05] position is a great honor
[42:07] amen
[42:10] you know with with with with man it
[42:12] seems impossible

[42:17] we look through the flesh we look at our
[42:21] flesh and our weaknesses right we'll
[42:23] never be able to achieve anything for
[42:26] God but if we look to the spirit and the

[44:29] to even think I never thought
[44:33] like I said in a million years never
[44:35] thought
[44:37] and I was in the flesh I was going to
[44:39] decline
[44:41] but I one thing I know and the only
[44:43] thing I know
[44:44] with this whole experience with me is
[44:46] he's told me not to decline
[44:48] that's all I know
[44:51] the rest is walking by faith walking in

[44:56] and allowing the Holy Spirit
[44:58] to use us
[45:00] for his glory and honor

[46:06] one I want to title The Awakening power
[46:08] in a seed of God there is Great
[46:11] Awakening power in the seed of God we
[46:14] want to turn to Hebrews 4 12.
[46:17] and then we're going to read from First
[46:19] John 3 9.
[46:23] Hallelujah
[46:27] for the word
[46:29] for the word of God
[46:32] is quick
[46:36] pay attention put on your spiritual
[46:37] Minds
[46:39] let everything from the day or whatever
[46:41] leave it behind
[46:44] let's enter in
[46:48] is quick and Powerful
[46:51] and sharper than any two-edged sword
[46:55] piercing
[46:57] even to the dividing asunder of Soul and
[47:00] Spirit
[47:02] and the joints and Marrow
[47:05] and is a discerner of the thoughts and
[47:09] intense
[47:10] of the heart
[47:13] let's go to John First John 3 9.
[47:24] whosoever
[47:27] is born of God
[47:30] now listen doeth not
[47:33] commit sin
[47:37] whosoever is born of God
[47:42] do it not commit sin
[47:44] for his seed
[47:46] the attribute the part of God the word
[47:49] of God
[47:51] remaineth in him
[47:53] or her
[47:55] and he cannot sin because he is born
[48:01] of God
[48:05] wow
[48:07] you know Jesus said to his disciples
[48:10] I believe Jesus repeat it we only see
[48:13] what we see in the Bible
[48:15] and what we read but I believe Jesus
[48:18] repeated a lot of things over and over
[48:21] until he came to the place where the
[48:23] disciples responded back and Jesus said
[48:26] do you now see
[48:29] that's why 80 90 of preaching is
[48:32] preaching the same thing over and over
[48:35] because we don't get it we don't see it
[48:38] right away
[48:40] right but when we seek didn't see into
[48:43] the word of God and we seek in the
[48:46] spirit
[48:47] eventually it breaks open to us and we
[48:51] get it
[48:53] Who We Are
[48:56] let us pray father in the name of Jesus
[48:59] Christ
[49:01] the almighty who is in our midst
[49:05] not only in our midst but in US
[49:09] we pray in the name of Jesus Christ let
[49:11] Thy word go forth
[49:13] let the prison doors open let the chains
[49:17] fall off father
[49:19] I declare it in the name of Jesus Christ
[49:21] let eyes open let hearts
[49:26] come subject
[49:28] and obedient to the word this morning
[49:31] Grant these things father in Jesus
[49:34] Christ's name we pray amen you may be
[49:37] seated
[49:41] that's what the word is
[49:44] the word of God
[49:47] is the seed of God
[49:51] the seed of God is the attribute of God
[49:54] that lies within us
[49:58] everything that the word is speaking in
[50:01] this hour pertains to the bride pertains
[50:06] to you and me
[50:10] God is bringing his word to try to get
[50:14] us to realize
[50:16] as we're going to see as we go along
[50:18] here how many times the prophet through
[50:21] the spirit spoke when she recognizes who
[50:25] she is
[50:26] when she comes to that realization of
[50:29] who she is and that is what's taking
[50:32] place in this hour
[50:34] There's a Great Awakening happen in The
[50:36] Bride of Jesus Christ
[50:38] because once that Awakening comes to
[50:41] that place of perfect faith in her then
[50:44] the Rapture will go
[50:47] and I believe the third pull is
[50:50] operating now it is not true man it's
[50:54] through his Spirit through the revealing
[50:56] of the word by his spirit in this hour
[51:03] those that are filthy
[51:05] let them be filthy still those that are
[51:09] righteous let them be righteous still
[51:12] this is the hour
[51:14] that those scriptures are being
[51:16] fulfilled
[51:17] and filthy don't mean you know just like
[51:20] Wicked we look at Wicked and we look at
[51:23] murderers and it's not that's not what
[51:26] God considers Wicked
[51:28] unbelief manifesting in an individual is
[51:32] what God considers Wicked
[51:37] the word of God
[51:39] is referred to as a seed there are a
[51:44] total of 44 verses in the New Testament
[51:47] where the Greek word Sperma was
[51:51] translated seed
[51:54] to conceive and give birth to the
[51:58] Miracles you need and you must first
[52:02] plant God's word like a seed in your
[52:07] heart
[52:08] we believe the word like Mary
[52:12] was Mary conceived the first
[52:16] Royal Seed of Abraham came on the scene
[52:20] because Mary believed what the angel
[52:24] spoke to her
[52:26] and she said be unto me
[52:29] all the things that evolve around it I
[52:33] know no man how can this be but still be
[52:37] it unto me
[52:38] My Flesh my life my weaknesses who I am
[52:44] but be it unto me according to the word
[52:48] that I'm hearing the word that's
[52:50] speaking to my heart
[52:52] be it unto me
[52:55] I believe it's the same thing today
[52:58] Mary is conceiving a miracle marries the
[53:03] bride
[53:06] you have to plant it
[53:10] in your heart
[53:13] you can't keep it in your mind
[53:16] you got to put it in your heart
[53:24] our hearts were created by God to bring
[53:26] forth fruit
[53:28] when his words planted in them
[53:32] just as a seed has to remain in the
[53:34] ground over time to germinate sow the
[53:37] word of God has to abide in US
[53:41] Jesus said in John 15 7 if you abide if
[53:45] ye abide in me and my words abide in you
[53:48] ask what you will and it will be done
[53:50] unto you
[53:52] you know it's not just you know these
[53:56] these scriptures are not just lightly
[53:58] given
[54:00] listen to what he's saying
[54:02] if the seed
[54:04] if the word
[54:07] if the birth abides in you and you know
[54:10] it
[54:12] ask what you want what do you think he
[54:14] said that for what do you think he said
[54:17] speak to this mountain
[54:19] and don't doubt in your heart and it
[54:22] will be removed it's not base and in in
[54:26] in James people you know we pray we pray
[54:30] James says you ask a miss you ask
[54:33] according to your flesh your fleshly
[54:35] desires but when he speak in the word of
[54:38] God and he's telling you to speak and
[54:41] ask he knows it's not you it's the
[54:45] attribute it's him inside of you
[54:48] speaking and asking what it has need of
[54:52] there's a word in us that needs to grow
[54:56] to be watered to come into full maturity
[55:00] to take over this flesh
[55:02] it speaks to us inside it reveals to us
[55:06] inside what we have need of and when it
[55:09] does that's when we ask and that's when
[55:12] we speak
[55:13] and then that's when you see the answers
[55:17] oh yeah
[55:21] we live too much
[55:23] too much by this denominational system
[55:26] this this this this carnal system that
[55:29] we're out here of religion
[55:33] but this ain't religion this is a
[55:36] supernatural Living Word of God it's the
[55:40] living life
[55:42] that he wants to possess in his vessels
[55:47] who are his vessels I don't know
[55:50] but he knows
[55:52] amen
[55:55] what would happen if you plant a seed in
[55:57] your garden and then you dig it up each
[55:59] morning to see what is what is happening
[56:02] it would die
[56:04] it'll never produce fruit
[56:06] you have to have faith
[56:08] that the seed is doing what God created
[56:12] to do did he not say I have started to
[56:16] work
[56:17] I will finish it I am the author and I
[56:20] am the finisher of your faith
[56:24] we need to trust more
[56:26] we need to rest more
[56:29] we need to walk in his spirit and
[56:32] confidence more
[56:34] and his ability
[56:37] when we don't trust
[56:39] when we don't believe when we worry we
[56:41] doubt
[56:42] or we get self-pity upon us
[56:46] we get depressed all these things is
[56:49] because we don't believe
[56:52] and we don't trust in him
[56:54] that he's more than able
[56:58] to do what he said
[57:01] did he ever give you a timeline when he
[57:03] reveals something to you
[57:06] no
[57:07] Abraham
[57:09] you're going to have a son by Sarah
[57:14] and you're going to be a father of many
[57:15] nations
[57:18] Abraham's like praise God
[57:20] just like when he said Abraham go
[57:22] separate yourself from your family
[57:25] because they're unbelievers and they'll
[57:27] have you in the same frame of thinking
[57:28] in mind
[57:29] you'll go by their interpretations
[57:31] you'll go by their thoughts and their
[57:33] opinions
[57:34] come come
[57:36] and walk with me Abraham and be thou
[57:39] perfect
[57:41] when you walk with God you are perfect
[57:43] because you're walking with the perfect
[57:45] one
[57:47] but God never told Abraham it was going
[57:50] to be easy
[57:51] God never told Abraham how long
[57:54] but God told them you're going to have a
[57:56] son you're going to have a land and your
[57:58] seed will sojourn amen
[58:02] and I will deliver and I will set free
[58:04] and I will multiply
[58:07] and did he
[58:10] yes he did
[58:12] God said are you going to send a prophet
[58:14] to us in the last days did he
[58:16] he did
[58:23] the seed is the source of the origin
[58:27] or beginning of anything in the Book of
[58:30] Genesis it tells us see time Harvest
[58:33] principle will remain as long as the
[58:36] Earth does
[58:37] the law of sown and reaping Jesus
[58:40] applied this sea time Harvest principle
[58:43] to the word produced in the Kingdom
[58:46] in Mark 4 26.
[58:49] the spirit through the Apostle Paul
[58:52] applied sea time and harvest principle
[58:55] to giving and sowing of money
[58:59] second Corinthians 9 6 and to our
[59:03] actions and behaviors Galatians 6 7 the
[59:07] truth that is there
[59:09] all are all kinds of things called seed
[59:12] and all kinds of fields to sow in into
[59:16] we can reap a harvest out of what he's
[59:19] saying here we can sow
[59:22] because that's the law of God and we
[59:25] cannot change the law of God as long as
[59:27] the Earth stands what you sow you reap
[59:31] so whatever you're sown into you're
[59:34] going to reap in that field if you're
[59:37] sown to your flesh you're going to reap
[59:39] to your flesh
[59:40] your soul to the carnal mind you're
[59:43] going to reap the carnal mind which is
[59:44] death you show to the spiritual mind
[59:46] you're going to reap the spiritual mind
[59:48] which is life
[59:50] it's up to you it's your choice you have
[59:53] been given free more agency God has left
[59:56] you alone he's let the Earth alone to
[59:59] make their own choices this morning
[1:00:02] to what you will sow
[1:00:05] what you will believe and receive
[1:00:07] from his word
[1:00:11] if you lack wisdom you lack
[1:00:13] understanding
[1:00:14] ask
[1:00:16] God open my eyes
[1:00:19] There's a Great Awakening a great move
[1:00:22] happening a secret catching away in
[1:00:26] individuals happening
[1:00:28] that they cannot explain
[1:00:30] listen it's not going to be explained to
[1:00:32] you it's not going to be laid out to you
[1:00:33] by men
[1:00:35] no preacher no no sermon is going to
[1:00:38] tell you this that secret catching away
[1:00:40] in
[1:00:41] only he himself
[1:00:43] only he himself can tell you
[1:00:46] that's between you and him individually
[1:00:51] it will show where your faith is at
[1:00:54] it will show where your heart is at
[1:00:59] the angel Messner came in our day and
[1:01:02] sold seeds to the bride
[1:01:04] the spoken word of God is the Original
[1:01:06] Seed out of the mouth of a true prophet
[1:01:10] there came seeds of perfect faith
[1:01:14] of rapture and revelation of overcoming
[1:01:17] power to change everything in her soul
[1:01:21] and to awaken the seed of God to the
[1:01:24] power to live this word
[1:01:27] The Awakening of the Bride is the
[1:01:30] Harvest coming into maturity
[1:01:34] this is Harvest Time
[1:01:37] and the Harvest time is the bride coming
[1:01:39] into our maturity
[1:01:41] there is going to be a real bride
[1:01:44] there is going to be a bread that will
[1:01:46] stand on this Earth
[1:01:48] that will Manifest this word
[1:01:51] why because it's been spoken
[1:01:54] it's been spoken through a prophet it's
[1:01:56] thus say it the Lord
[1:02:00] just like California is going to go
[1:02:03] under is thus saith the Lord
[1:02:06] even now they're starting to say after
[1:02:08] all these years we had a prophet way
[1:02:11] back there said that California is going
[1:02:14] to break off and slip into the ocean now
[1:02:17] I just read and listened to a program
[1:02:20] that now the scientists are saying that
[1:02:24] California could break off and slip in
[1:02:27] the ocean
[1:02:29] never in all these years have they said
[1:02:32] that
[1:02:34] I don't eat them
[1:02:37] I don't need them out there I don't need
[1:02:40] to trust in them
[1:02:42] oh my
[1:02:43] if you're still trusting in them out
[1:02:45] there
[1:02:47] the political world
[1:02:49] the medical world
[1:02:51] the financial world
[1:02:54] God help you
[1:02:56] because it's going one place
[1:02:59] it's going right into tribulation
[1:03:02] amen
[1:03:04] God's intention was when he spoke the
[1:03:08] word that it would become materialized
[1:03:11] and made flesh within humans
[1:03:13] his chosen ones there is nothing that
[1:03:16] God hasn't spoken that stays dormant
[1:03:19] but the scripture says in Isaiah 55 11
[1:03:22] so shall my word be that goeth forth out
[1:03:27] of my mouth
[1:03:28] it shall not
[1:03:31] return unto me void
[1:03:33] but it will it shall accomplish that
[1:03:36] which I please and it shall prosper in
[1:03:39] the thing whereto I sent it
[1:03:43] his word has already gone forth it's
[1:03:47] already been spoken out of his mouth
[1:03:50] we are speaking what he's already spoken
[1:03:54] amen the seals have been opened you know
[1:03:59] when a seal is sealed that means it's a
[1:04:03] finished work that's why Jesus on the
[1:04:05] cross said it is finished
[1:04:07] and when all the seals were sealed is
[1:04:11] because there was a finished work behind
[1:04:14] those seals and in this day amen in this
[1:04:18] day the seventh seal was opened by the
[1:04:22] Lamb of God
[1:04:23] and when he opened those seals that
[1:04:26] finished work came forth
[1:04:29] and was spoken
[1:04:31] there are finished work here this
[1:04:34] morning there are Finnish people here
[1:04:36] this morning that the work has already
[1:04:38] been done and finished
[1:04:40] all over brother Tim I don't understand
[1:04:43] I don't come into the realization of
[1:04:45] that you will
[1:04:47] you will it's happening amnesia's break
[1:04:50] in The Awakening is taking place upon us
[1:04:53] it's happening as you believe
[1:04:57] the word
[1:05:00] the word
[1:05:06] oh my do you see why it has to be said
[1:05:08] over and over and over I can even still
[1:05:11] feel it in here you're not catching it
[1:05:13] some are not catching it but God will
[1:05:16] speak it over and over
[1:05:18] when you are ready to catch it
[1:05:20] amen
[1:05:22] you might be fighting up
[1:05:24] let me tell you if you're a son and
[1:05:26] daughter of God
[1:05:27] you know you're only going to fight up
[1:05:28] so much
[1:05:30] because God is going to deal with you
[1:05:32] why because you got to catch it
[1:05:35] amen
[1:05:37] you gotta catch this
[1:05:39] this is Rapture in Revelation Rapture
[1:05:41] and faith we gotta leave here
[1:05:44] we see out there gross Darkness we see
[1:05:47] prophecies being fulfilled third world
[1:05:50] war right on the brink
[1:05:52] tribulation setting up
[1:05:55] they're getting themselves in in gear
[1:05:58] and getting themselves in order and so
[1:06:00] is the bride
[1:06:02] who am I
[1:06:04] Hallelujah
[1:06:06] whatever God has to do it's not in my
[1:06:09] notes but whatever God has to do if he
[1:06:11] has to break you he'll break it
[1:06:18] oh my
[1:06:21] because my word will not return to me
[1:06:25] void
[1:06:27] oh thank you Jesus I look at that I say
[1:06:30] thank you Lord
[1:06:32] oh my the attribute is separating from
[1:06:35] the flesh so much there's such a like
[1:06:39] Paul said the wicked man this who's
[1:06:42] going to save me but he caught a
[1:06:43] revelation amen he said I fought the
[1:06:45] good fight or fight what a good fight
[1:06:47] the fight inside of him amen between the
[1:06:50] Flesh and the attribute the seed the
[1:06:52] faith that had to come to his Perfection
[1:06:54] inside of him that he had to manifest
[1:06:56] the word first day and fulfill and I
[1:06:59] fought that good fight and I I finished
[1:07:01] my course I kept the faith oh my I kept
[1:07:05] the revelation of God of who he said I
[1:07:08] am
[1:07:10] and now there's a crown waiting for me I
[1:07:13] know there's a crown awaiting for me I
[1:07:15] can see heaven like P like uh uh Stephen
[1:07:18] said I see the heavens open I see him
[1:07:21] sitting at the right hand of God
[1:07:24] well these are just words
[1:07:26] oh
[1:07:28] Hallelujah glory to God thank you Lord
[1:07:32] amen First Peter 1 23 being born again
[1:07:36] not of corruptable seed but of
[1:07:40] Incorruptible by the word of God which
[1:07:42] liveth and abideth forever
[1:07:45] God's word is alive
[1:07:48] God's seed contains life
[1:07:51] the sower Souls the word and the seed is
[1:07:55] the word it contains power it contains
[1:07:59] life that's what's inside of me that's
[1:08:02] what's inside of you if you believe if
[1:08:05] it's been revealed to you
[1:08:09] so why don't we just
[1:08:12] put aside
[1:08:16] I know it's easier said than done
[1:08:18] put aside
[1:08:20] and let him
[1:08:22] oh my
[1:08:26] words are seeds
[1:08:30] you can sow bad or good words into your
[1:08:34] relationships
[1:08:36] thoughts are seeds
[1:08:38] you can allow good or bad thoughts to be
[1:08:41] sown in your mind
[1:08:43] it's all part of the process here
[1:08:46] and you're going to hear it over and
[1:08:47] over
[1:08:51] actions attitudes and behaviors are
[1:08:54] seeds
[1:08:58] love is a seed kindness is a seed Mercy
[1:09:01] is a seed patient is a seed thankfulness
[1:09:04] is a seed even a smile is a seed
[1:09:09] even your worship is a seed
[1:09:12] just this give somebody a smile
[1:09:16] you're sown a seed
[1:09:19] oh my
[1:09:23] money is a seed
[1:09:26] you know that
[1:09:28] money is a seed
[1:09:31] that's the way I look at it when I pay
[1:09:33] my tithes and my offerings and that
[1:09:36] I don't pay it to a man I don't pay it
[1:09:38] to I pay it to God it's a seed
[1:09:40] it's the seed that I'm sowing and I
[1:09:43] approach God
[1:09:44] with that seed and I said Lord I'm
[1:09:47] approaching this seed into good ground
[1:09:50] believing
[1:09:51] that you're gonna open up the windows of
[1:09:54] Heaven part of blessing
[1:09:57] let him interpret the blessing I don't
[1:09:59] interpret it
[1:10:00] God knows what's best for my life
[1:10:04] like you said in a high call if he wants
[1:10:06] to supply my needs day to day then I'm
[1:10:10] okay with that
[1:10:12] that's that's my windows of Heaven
[1:10:15] opening up and blessing me
[1:10:18] you know there's coming a time like
[1:10:21] brother Danny's preaching the great
[1:10:23] squeeze is on
[1:10:25] there's coming a time financially this
[1:10:28] digital system Catholic Society is
[1:10:30] coming into effect is part of the new
[1:10:32] world order the mark of the beast
[1:10:35] is coming and it's going to control
[1:10:39] oh yes I'm not trying to put fear in you
[1:10:42] I'm trying to show you that this is
[1:10:44] reality that's trying to put Faith
[1:10:46] inside of you
[1:10:47] that your supply doesn't come from them
[1:10:50] it comes from God Supply it your needs
[1:10:54] every day out of his Treasures in Heaven
[1:11:02] he took the Raven and fed the prophet he
[1:11:06] took the barrel of oil and he kept
[1:11:10] filling it up over and over
[1:11:12] is he the same God today
[1:11:16] he's not just yesterday but he's today
[1:11:19] and he's going to be forever the same
[1:11:22] God
[1:11:25] Hallelujah
[1:11:29] my Lord I got to get into my message
[1:11:31] here I'm not even into it yet before I
[1:11:33] lose my voice
[1:11:37] but whatever God's will is
[1:11:41] God's word is powerful
[1:11:44] it's a sword
[1:11:47] it's a two-edged sword
[1:11:50] now remember when I am speaking this
[1:11:54] remember the word of God is a seed
[1:11:58] the seed is the attribute
[1:12:01] and where is the attribute it's inside
[1:12:05] of you
[1:12:07] so this word is a sword inside of you is
[1:12:12] cutting like a two-edged sword
[1:12:15] it's Discerning the very thoughts and
[1:12:18] intents of your heart
[1:12:22] it's all back to you
[1:12:25] and your walk
[1:12:28] that word convicts you
[1:12:31] the same word that saves you
[1:12:34] everything God can do in his word he can
[1:12:37] do because he is the one the word
[1:12:42] God's word prevails
[1:12:46] you see it prevails where in you
[1:12:52] there's something you can overcome
[1:12:56] no
[1:12:58] maybe you haven't overcome it yet
[1:13:01] because you're praying for the faith to
[1:13:05] become stronger and clearer so that you
[1:13:08] can walk out
[1:13:09] like the enemy comes in as a flood
[1:13:11] unbelief comes in as a flood in an area
[1:13:14] of your life that you're battling and
[1:13:16] that you're struggling with but then God
[1:13:18] comes with Revelation and raises a
[1:13:20] standard and causes you to live make his
[1:13:23] word inside of you more real
[1:13:27] so the word is more real
[1:13:29] than that
[1:13:32] that flood
[1:13:34] that's how you overcome that's what's in
[1:13:37] a seed inside of you it prevails
[1:13:41] we always look into ourselves we're
[1:13:45] always looking to our own abilities what
[1:13:47] man can do
[1:13:49] as soon as you realize and recognize it
[1:13:52] has nothing to do with you
[1:13:54] this walk this battle this overcoming
[1:13:58] has nothing to do with you he said I
[1:14:01] have already overcome I have finished
[1:14:04] the work it's him inside of me that is
[1:14:08] overcoming
[1:14:10] not me
[1:14:13] people still get confused with the
[1:14:15] process of sowing a seed and believing
[1:14:19] really
[1:14:21] what can you believe
[1:14:23] you say you believe what do you believe
[1:14:27] you can't believe you're just saying it
[1:14:29] it's a mental Faith you're just saying
[1:14:31] it that you believe you can't believe
[1:14:33] unless something is revealed to you
[1:14:35] when it's revealed to you by him the
[1:14:37] word
[1:14:38] who you are then you can believe
[1:14:42] you can't even believe what's being
[1:14:44] spoken here this morning that this
[1:14:46] pertains to you unless it's revealed to
[1:14:48] you
[1:14:51] Hallelujah
[1:14:53] God's word prevails over everything not
[1:14:57] just some things
[1:14:59] okay
[1:15:00] I don't I come to a place in my walk I
[1:15:02] don't care I don't care anymore about
[1:15:06] anything but the word of God if it says
[1:15:08] it prevails over everything so no matter
[1:15:11] what comes in my life what struggle I
[1:15:14] have it's going to Prevail over it
[1:15:17] it's going to conquer it
[1:15:19] amen Hallelujah
[1:15:23] Hallelujah
[1:15:24] God's word is powerful
[1:15:27] or you can say the seed the attribute is
[1:15:31] full of power
[1:15:33] it's not weak
[1:15:36] it's not crippled
[1:15:38] but it's full of power I'm talking about
[1:15:41] you and your walk and what you're
[1:15:43] believing
[1:15:44] what you got inside of you is full of
[1:15:47] power
[1:15:49] so when you're approaching the throne
[1:15:51] when you're approaching a circumstance a
[1:15:54] situation take the full power of the
[1:15:57] word of God that's inside of you in
[1:15:59] prayer and speak the word of God

[1:16:11] not only physically but emotionally
[1:16:14] mentally spiritually he sent his word
[1:16:19] he already sent his word out
[1:16:22] now it's germanizing hearts in good
[1:16:25] ground this morning in the bride he sent
[1:16:29] his word and he healed and he's healing
[1:16:32] and he's continued to deliver and it's
[1:16:35] overcoming
[1:16:42] oh my
[1:16:45] foreign
[1:16:52] Hallelujah
[1:16:55] Hebrews 1 3.
[1:16:57] the word of God says
[1:17:00] his powers over all nature
[1:17:04] because God's word created nature
[1:17:08] we look in Genesis
[1:17:10] and we see that
[1:17:12] God spoke
[1:17:14] let there be let there be
[1:17:16] the great creation came into effect
[1:17:18] right
[1:17:21] but then Jesus
[1:17:23] spoke to the wind and the Sea and they
[1:17:25] obeyed the word
[1:17:27] they obeyed him what was God doing
[1:17:29] what was God showing
[1:17:32] he was saying I'm not just back there
[1:17:35] when I spoke and said let there be let
[1:17:38] there be but I'm here now in flesh and
[1:17:41] I'm showing you that the God who created
[1:17:44] nature
[1:17:45] is control in nature
[1:17:48] and the god who's control in nature and
[1:17:51] speak into nature and it's obeying him
[1:17:54] is inside of you
[1:17:56] in a form of an attribute a seed of God
[1:17:58] growing by faith into perfect Faith
[1:18:01] every day
[1:18:06] you know other is coming to a place in
[1:18:07] in in
[1:18:08] now in this time
[1:18:11] it's coming to a place
[1:18:15] where that door is shutting we're saying
[1:18:16] it over and over
[1:18:18] and the and the Revelation the revealing
[1:18:21] of the word the third pull is being
[1:18:23] spoken and it's creating life into the
[1:18:25] Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:18:27] those those those grounds those hearts
[1:18:29] that are prepared and wanted
[1:18:33] that there could be somebody sitting
[1:18:36] here or ending church for 30 40 years
[1:18:38] not wanting it and a soul comes in at
[1:18:41] the last minute and the ground is good
[1:18:43] it's toiled up is is God has dealt with
[1:18:47] it and it's good ground and it wants it
[1:18:54] remember the third pull is going to go
[1:18:56] to them and the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:18:57] and bring her to perfect faith and
[1:18:59] perfect Rapture Revelation but it's also
[1:19:02] going to preach to the loss
[1:19:14] when he cursed the fig tree
[1:19:17] it died
[1:19:19] curse those things in your life
[1:19:22] curse the things that are tormenting you
[1:19:25] curse the devil bind the devil

[1:19:33] everybody else's life bind them in your
[1:19:36] life
[1:19:37] get to enough faith that you can bind
[1:19:39] them in your own life and see that and
[1:19:42] then maybe God will allow you to bind
[1:19:43] him in somebody else's life
[1:19:46] oh we want to bind the devil all over
[1:19:47] the place but we can't even control the
[1:19:49] devil in our own life in our flesh
[1:19:54] devil speaking manifesting acting
[1:19:57] through flesh
[1:19:59] and we want to bind them that's nothing
[1:20:01] but a religious demon from the pits of
[1:20:04] hell
[1:20:04] manifesting
[1:20:12] all physical laws obey spiritual laws
[1:20:16] because the spiritual law was first
[1:20:21] you understand that

[1:20:36] spiritual revelation of the word of God
[1:20:38] in you
[1:20:40] God's word has power to call things into
[1:20:42] being he called Abraham a nation
[1:20:46] he called Peter steadfast he called the
[1:20:49] world into being while he also called us
[1:20:53] healed he called us more than conquerors
[1:20:57] he has called us a glorious church he
[1:21:00] has called us a royal priesthood
[1:21:03] a friend of God
[1:21:06] and he's called this world to
[1:21:08] destruction
[1:21:10] you understand
[1:21:12] he has the power to call into existence
[1:21:15] what he has spoken and he's already
[1:21:18] called a bride
[1:21:21] he's called a race a royal priesthood
[1:21:25] unto God he's called individuals in
[1:21:28] these last days
[1:21:33] oh my
[1:21:36] now God's word

[1:21:41] not only to give life but also to
[1:21:45] deliver warnings bring judgment and
[1:21:48] Punishment punishment to the disobedient
[1:21:50] is not my word like fire declares the
[1:21:53] Lord
[1:21:54] and like a hammer that breaks the Rock
[1:21:58] in pieces
[1:21:59] Jeremiah 23 29. God's living word is not
[1:22:04] something to read or listen
[1:22:07] to passively and then forget
[1:22:11] James taught Christians to look intently
[1:22:16] into the perfect law that gives us
[1:22:19] freedom and to focus on doing what it
[1:22:23] says
[1:22:25] not just a hearer but a doer

[1:22:49] inspired by God and is useful to teach
[1:22:53] us what is the truth and to make us
[1:22:56] realize what's wrong in our lives it
[1:23:00] corrects us when we are wrong it teaches
[1:23:02] us to do what is right God uses it to
[1:23:06] prepare and equip his people to do every
[1:23:08] good work

[1:30:41] I don't know about you if you need more
[1:30:42] evidence you need more and more
[1:30:45] now if the seed wasn't on the earth it
[1:30:49] could not live

[1:30:53] and also germatized
[1:30:55] no matter how long it keeps in the

[1:32:03] he had to come back and germatize awaken
[1:32:07] shine his light his quickening power

[1:32:30] sanctification not just the baptism and
[1:32:33] the gifts

[1:33:56] never know the power of the seed if you
[1:33:59] are not walking in a covenant
[1:34:01] relationship with God

[1:35:07] that's the way it works
[1:35:10] I don't want to sow it to my carnal mind
[1:35:11] I don't want to sow it to the Natural
[1:35:12] Things of this life
[1:35:15] you know what what's happening me I know
[1:35:17] there's a change taking place inside of
[1:35:19] me that things are being dropped off
[1:35:21] desires are being dropped off of my life
[1:35:24] rapidly
[1:35:27] I'm telling you
[1:35:28] listen
[1:35:30] if that's not happening to you because I
[1:35:33] believe I'm in the spirit of God I
[1:35:36] believe I'm walking with the spirit of
[1:35:37] God and in the in the movement of the
[1:35:39] Bride of Jesus Christ and in the mind of
[1:35:41] Christ and if that is happening to me I
[1:35:44] know it's happening to her each
[1:35:46] individual that's walking with God
[1:35:48] and if it's not happened to you oh God
[1:35:53] may God wake you up
[1:35:55] in this late hour
[1:35:58] Hallelujah
[1:36:01] I want that Covenant relationship more
[1:36:03] and more with him
[1:36:06] Hallelujah
[1:36:07] James 3 1 once you understand the power
[1:36:10] of your words you won't just say
[1:36:13] anything
[1:36:14] that's the problem we don't understand
[1:36:16] the power of our words
[1:36:18] we remember God gave the law sown and
[1:36:21] reaping
[1:36:22] it's to everybody
[1:36:25] what are you going to sow you're going
[1:36:26] to constantly show the carnality in your
[1:36:29] life
[1:36:29] what do you think you're reaping a
[1:36:31] harvest what do you think the atmosphere
[1:36:33] brother Brown said go and speak our
[1:36:36] world a world that you want and walk in
[1:36:40] it and live in it by what by the Spoken
[1:36:43] Word by what you speak around your life
[1:36:51] not negative not doubt not fear not
[1:36:55] unbelief
[1:36:57] you know when those times come
[1:36:59] when the enemy comes
[1:37:01] be still
[1:37:04] be still
[1:37:06] and know that he's God
[1:37:09] just don't say nothing
[1:37:11] until you can speak by the spirit do not
[1:37:15] say nothing
[1:37:17] because you're just
[1:37:20] gonna so evil upon yourself
[1:37:23] and a separation between you and God
[1:37:29] the power of soul and seeds into your
[1:37:32] marriage
[1:37:33] by speaking faith in your relationship
[1:37:37] then you can come into agreement that
[1:37:39] the word of God governs and controls
[1:37:41] your marriage in all areas
[1:37:44] you both let the word judge the
[1:37:46] situation
[1:37:49] marriage problem solves right there
[1:37:52] best marriage and counsel I can ever
[1:37:54] give you
[1:37:56] oh brother Tim this does this and that
[1:38:00] and he he does this and that
[1:38:02] that's all nonsense
[1:38:04] let the word of God
[1:38:06] sow the word of God in your marriage sow
[1:38:08] it in your relationship
[1:38:10] bring the word if I'm wrong let the word
[1:38:15] stand there and let me be wrong and let
[1:38:18] me agree with the word
[1:38:21] if she's wrong let the word judge it
[1:38:25] oh but you know my husband is a little
[1:38:28] you know
[1:38:29] High Strung or he's this way or that way
[1:38:32] or my wife a little bit this way and
[1:38:33] that way
[1:38:37] if that's where you're going to stay
[1:38:39] that's where you're going to stay
[1:38:42] doesn't matter about any of that stuff
[1:38:44] let the word of God judge
[1:38:48] let it be the one that guides and leads
[1:38:52] and speaks into your marriage into your
[1:38:55] hearts
[1:38:55] line up with the word
[1:39:02] Hallelujah
[1:39:04] amen
[1:39:07] second Corinthians
[1:39:08] okay let's try to get to some things
[1:39:12] here
[1:39:14] I'm on page seven and I got 11 pages so
[1:39:16] I'm gonna have to just skip through some
[1:39:18] stuff and continue
[1:39:20] second Corinthians 10 5 once you
[1:39:22] understand the power of your thoughts
[1:39:24] you just won't think anything
[1:39:26] second Corinthians 15 3 Once you
[1:39:29] understand the power of your presence
[1:39:32] you just won't go anywhere
[1:39:35] huh
[1:39:39] you just won't go anywheres
[1:39:42] I wonder I wonder sometimes where we go
[1:39:45] what kind of atmospheres we go in what
[1:39:47] kind of places we go to
[1:39:51] maybe you're like Legion
[1:39:53] that you know walks around the dead in
[1:39:55] the tombs the deadness of this world
[1:39:59] and you need Jesus to come to cast those
[1:40:01] demons out of you
[1:40:02] because the areas and places that you go
[1:40:04] things that you speak atmospheres that
[1:40:07] you're picking up influences that are
[1:40:09] influencing you is not the word of God
[1:40:13] all I can say if you're a child of God
[1:40:16] God is going to deal with you if you're
[1:40:19] not you're just going to mingle on that
[1:40:21] stuff
[1:40:22] and you're just going to fall right into
[1:40:23] that stuff
[1:40:26] I want to go where the spirit of God
[1:40:28] leads me Sons and Daughters of God are
[1:40:31] led by the spirit of God
[1:40:33] he can lead you he can guide you
[1:40:36] and he ain't going to go and lead you
[1:40:39] anywhere is where he's not
[1:40:42] Lord David said if you don't go up
[1:40:45] before me don't let me go the footsteps
[1:40:48] of the righteous are ordered of the lord
[1:40:50] they're blessed coming in and going out
[1:40:52] because he's leading us
[1:40:55] we wake up in the morning great spirit
[1:40:58] of the Living God that lives inside of
[1:41:00] me lead me and guide me today
[1:41:02] go before me remove every trap every
[1:41:06] snare every hinders of the devil that's
[1:41:08] that he has set for me and break the
[1:41:11] power of Satan
[1:41:14] every morning I say that
[1:41:16] because I realize what I'm in here I'm
[1:41:20] in a battle I'm in a fight
[1:41:23] I don't see with these eyes that see
[1:41:26] these Natural Things there's a spiritual
[1:41:28] warfare going on
[1:41:30] demons trying to to snatch people's
[1:41:33] Souls
[1:41:35] he knows his time is short
[1:41:39] but you need to know who you are and
[1:41:42] that's what God is doing
[1:41:44] opening up your understanding
[1:41:46] breaking the spiritual amnesia
[1:41:49] oh when she realizes we're going to get
[1:41:51] to it
[1:41:53] not that you haven't heard it before
[1:41:55] you're going to hear it again and again
[1:41:58] until it becomes real
[1:42:01] why go on behind the veil
[1:42:03] is not a one-time event or experience
[1:42:07] it's a lifestyle
[1:42:10] settle it forever
[1:42:13] settle it forever what you want to do
[1:42:17] you commit yourself to God
[1:42:21] he'll commit himself to you
[1:42:23] if you're not committed
[1:42:26] that's the worst torment though you
[1:42:28] realize that you're you're standing
[1:42:29] between the dimensions even here this
[1:42:32] morning
[1:42:33] you're standing in between Dimensions
[1:42:35] when you if you're not surrendered to
[1:42:37] the word of God I don't care how perfect
[1:42:38] you are in your flesh but if you are in
[1:42:40] your heart you're surrendered to the
[1:42:42] word of God
[1:42:44] then you are in a dimension where the
[1:42:46] spirit of God is but if you're not and
[1:42:49] you're coming to church and you're just
[1:42:50] playing church and religion
[1:42:52] you're trapped
[1:42:54] in a dimension
[1:42:56] between hell and heaven this morning
[1:43:01] because you haven't settled it with God
[1:43:03] you haven't got to a place where you've
[1:43:05] given up everything for God
[1:43:08] and your own life you haven't died to
[1:43:10] your own life
[1:43:12] your own ways
[1:43:14] and said Lord I surrender all that I
[1:43:17] know all that I can I surrender to you
[1:43:26] at least you can say Lord I don't
[1:43:27] understand
[1:43:29] but help me
[1:43:32] this age is so dark so wicked so
[1:43:36] lukewarm lazy lazy in the mind
[1:43:41] people don't want to press in
[1:43:43] people don't want to get desperate
[1:43:45] that's another part I'm going to do
[1:43:47] don't want to get desperate
[1:43:49] but the seed of God gets desperate
[1:43:53] it's desperate every day
[1:43:56] amen
[1:43:57] it's perseverance every day
[1:44:00] it doesn't take a day off
[1:44:03] it doesn't relax or be lazy it's gonna
[1:44:06] it's got a mission it's got a purpose to
[1:44:09] fulfill the seed of God and every day

[1:44:20] don't sleep or Slumber even when you're
[1:44:22] waking up sometimes that's why you wake
[1:44:24] up at two or three in the morning you
[1:44:26] don't understand because it's the word
[1:44:27] of God inside of you trying to speak to
[1:44:30] you
[1:44:31] it's moving it's working it's fulfilling
[1:44:35] our carnal mind don't understand but
[1:44:38] that's what's going on
[1:44:40] that's what's going on
[1:44:42] be still in those times maybe he'll
[1:44:44] speak to you

[1:55:48] now when you get all that group together
[1:55:50] where the Revelation is perfectly in
[1:55:53] Harmony and God expressing it through
[1:55:56] the word by the same actions now listen
[1:55:59] the same actions
[1:56:02] the same things he did back there
[1:56:05] making his word manifest oh if the
[1:56:10] church only knew his possession
[1:56:13] it will one day
[1:56:15] hallelujah it's spoken it will one day
[1:56:20] she will recognize who she is she will
[1:56:23] recognize her position oh yeah there's
[1:56:26] hope there's power in the seed this
[1:56:29] morning
[1:56:30] oh my
[1:56:33] then the Rapture will go
[1:56:36] when it knows
[1:56:38] what it is
[1:56:40] oh my
[1:56:43] when it knows what it is
[1:56:46] of All Saints
[1:56:49] I'm I'm sitting up here and I'm like
[1:56:52] oh God
[1:56:54] do you think it needs to break on me
[1:56:56] more
[1:56:57] yeah
[1:56:59] it does
[1:57:01] but I'm looking at this and I'm
[1:57:03] rejoicing this is my life
[1:57:05] it is my life
[1:57:08] 32 years ago he called me
[1:57:11] by Supernatural experiences
[1:57:14] I would need another three four hours to
[1:57:16] tell you what he's done in my life
[1:57:17] supernaturally
[1:57:22] that same God
[1:57:24] I know I've been born again
[1:57:26] and you're saying Brother Sam what are
[1:57:28] you saying this for
[1:57:29] both on yourself no
[1:57:32] no
[1:57:34] I know I've been born again
[1:57:37] I know that the life of God that is
[1:57:39] spoken in the word of God lives inside
[1:57:41] of me
[1:57:43] because he has testified
[1:57:46] over and over he has proved to me over
[1:57:50] and over he has confirmed to me over and
[1:57:53] over
[1:57:55] so there's a time that has to come to a
[1:57:57] place where you're like am I a son am I
[1:58:00] a daughter of God to where you say I am
[1:58:04] because you know what that does
[1:58:06] it changes everything my brothers and
[1:58:08] sisters
[1:58:09] changes everything
[1:58:11] because then you walk different
[1:58:13] you walk with the power and authority
[1:58:15] that he has given inside of you because
[1:58:17] you know it's him inside of you

[1:58:21] devil can bring at you
[1:58:23] your flesh might be but you're not

[1:58:34] tool for me to come here
[1:58:36] I'm I can't wait to drop it off every

[1:58:59] this ain't real to me anymore
[1:59:03] I got no hopes and no plans no Futures

[1:59:51] you're not interested in living it
[1:59:54] but debating it
[1:59:56] the people who took his Revelation from
