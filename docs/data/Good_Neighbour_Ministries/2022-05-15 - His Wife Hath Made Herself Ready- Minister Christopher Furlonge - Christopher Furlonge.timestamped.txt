[0:39] the eyes of the lord are in every place
[0:44] beholding the evil
[0:46] and the good

[0:53] but hevestness daring is a preaching in
[0:56] the spirit
[0:59] and food despises father's instruction
[1:03] but he that regarding reproof is prudent
[1:08] in the house of the righteous is much
[1:11] treasure
[1:12] but in the revenues of the wreaking is
[1:15] stronger
[1:17] the lips of the wise dispersed knowledge
[1:21] but the heart of the
[1:25] the foolishness
[1:26] of the wicked is an abomination
[1:29] to the lord

[49:26] today
[49:29] god bless you bless you
[49:31] hallelujah
[49:34] have you been called unto the marriage
[49:36] supper
[49:38] of the lamb
[49:40] amen
[49:42] hallelujah he has been calling through
[49:45] all these ages
[49:47] but at the end of the seventh church age
[49:51] amen

[50:14] place
[50:16] it takes place after
[50:18] the wedding
[50:20] amen and when you have our wedding
[50:23] amen
[50:25] in in
[50:28] your customs
[50:29] as it's customary here
[50:31] amen
[50:33] is when two people are joined together
[50:36] amen in holy matrimony and they become
[50:41] one
[50:42] amen hallelujah so as we have read from
[50:45] the scripture
[50:46] amen
[50:48] when
[50:49] does
[50:50] the bride becomes a wife
[50:54] amen
[50:56] is when she takes the oath
[50:59] amen
[51:00] hallelujah and is committed onto one man
[51:05] amen
[51:06] then she becomes a wife
[51:09] amen
[51:10] hallelujah
[51:12] praise god
[51:14] and where
[51:15] does this wedding takes place
[51:18] in heaven
[51:20] or it sticks to this here
[51:23] because here it is
[51:25] she has been addressed
[51:27] as wife
[51:29] not wife a bride
[51:31] she's been addressed as a wife not a
[51:35] bride so there has to have some kind of
[51:39] intimate
[51:40] relationship
[51:42] happening
[51:43] amen
[51:45] right here
[51:47] amen for her to be acknowledged as wife
[51:52] you getting it
[51:53] amen
[51:55] so when god called you
[51:58] man you repented of your sins amen
[52:02] you went into water baptism

[52:08] that you're going to follow him you
[52:10] commit your life to him you're going to
[52:12] obey him amen you're going to do the
[52:15] things that he's saying amen it's then
[52:18] you took the oath off becoming a wife to
[52:21] him
[52:22] you're getting it
[52:24] amen so it's no more floating around
[52:28] no more hunting for somebody else
[52:30] you're committed to one person the lord
[52:34] and savior jesus christ
[52:37] hallelujah
[52:38] thank you lord jesus blessed be his
[52:40] wonderful name
[52:44] i no longer call you bride
[52:47] i call you wife
[52:48] amen
[52:51] hallelujah so you see as we have read
[52:54] the marriage of the lamb has come and
[52:56] his wife had made herself ready
[53:01] and what the word ready means
[53:03] amen
[53:04] is be prepared
[53:06] mentally or physically
[53:09] for some kind of action or an experience
[53:16] are you ready
[53:18] for action
[53:20] and an experience
[53:23] amen this morning
[53:25] today
[53:28] hallelujah
[53:31] another word for already is
[53:34] willingly disposed
[53:37] inclined to agree to
[53:40] someone's proposal
[53:43] amen
[53:45] being cautious
[53:49] heedful
[53:51] attentive and watching
[53:55] amen
[53:56] so as we have read
[53:58] the scriptures i've been instructed all
[54:00] these years
[54:02] to be ready to be watchful to be waiting
[54:05] for what
[54:07] for him
[54:09] to take us out here
[54:11] hallelujah
[54:13] thank you lord jesus
[54:15] hallelujah
[54:19] so just as we see
[54:23] how vashti
[54:25] had refused
[54:28] the king
[54:29] the king's commandment
[54:32] man
[54:34] to come into his presence
[54:37] to present
[54:38] her
[54:39] to the people
[54:41] just as
[54:43] that king typing
[54:44] our lord and savior jesus christ
[54:48] he is seeking
[54:50] a wife
[54:53] amen
[54:54] just as eliezer
[54:57] was seeking
[54:59] a wife for isaac
[55:03] all through the ages
[55:05] god has been seeking for a wife for
[55:08] himself

[55:17] responded to that call
[55:22] hallelujah praise god
[55:24] and you amen obey that call
[55:28] thank you jesus so we see esther was to
[55:32] become a bride

[55:37] so there was a stage from becoming a
[55:39] bride from being a bride to being a wife
[55:43] amen

[55:50] right
[55:51] she refused and
[55:53] in the
[55:54] in those days the law was if you refuse
[55:57] a commandment especially from the king
