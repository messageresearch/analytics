[31:25] pure word
[31:27] of God and his word was fulfilled in its
[31:33] fullness all when those seals were open
[31:37] all Mysteries were
[31:40] loosed they were loosed now he's here to
[31:44] come and reveal them to you because each
[31:47] and every one of us until God opens our
[31:50] eyes we are a
[31:54] mystery we're even a mystery to
[31:56] ourselves
[31:58] when you were out in the world you were
[32:00] a mystery to yourself you knew there was
[32:02] something different about you you just
[32:05] knew it there was an atmosphere around
[32:08] you that you could not recognize but you
[32:11] could
[32:12] feel you couldn't understand but you
[32:15] knew it was
[32:16] different until that new birth came
[32:19] until that word when it was God's
[32:21] appointed time and season to send forth
[32:24] his son in your life to awaken that seed
[32:27] of God for you to come to recognize who
[32:31] you are yes we have seen the life when
[32:34] we're listening to those tapes and we're
[32:37] seeing what are we seeing are we
[32:39] worshiping a man are we worshiping up a
[32:41] personality when I listen to those tapes
[32:44] I hear and I see with my eyes eternal
[32:49] life being
[32:51] manifested in a man Jesus
[32:55] Christ man
[32:57] manifestation is not about
[33:00] attracting what you
[33:02] want
[33:03] manifestation is an awareness and an
[33:07] understanding that you attract what you
[33:10] are that's what we're attracting what we
[33:14] are in these last days but we have such
[33:17] a concept and and and a mental uh uh
[33:21] thing in our mind a view in our mind
[33:25] amen as we heard before this message
[33:28] will put a view preachers when they
[33:31] preach pastors they put a view of God an
[33:35] image an imprint on your mind and each
[33:38] and every one of us have that imprint in
[33:41] our minds of who God
[33:48] is what is the manifestation of the
[33:51] spirit the Greek word translate
[33:54] manifestation means to display to show
[33:57] to demonstrate to give an
[34:01] Evidence the Holy Spirit displays God's
[34:04] power through each of us as means of
[34:07] helping the entire church each of us the
[34:12] spirit is manifested in one particular
[34:16] way and some other useful ways other

[34:22] purpose we all have a a portion of faith
[34:27] amen we are called to
[34:30] fulfill in the word of
[34:33] God hallelujah this ain't about church
[34:37] this ain't about a religious feeling but
[34:39] we have a portion of word Allelujah that
[34:43] we are called to fulfill and that's what
[34:47] the spirit in US seeks us Amen to seek
[34:52] after the kingdom that's within us to
[34:55] look and and and seek after that word
[34:58] that God placed in

[35:03] determination that's our drive that's
[35:05] our goal Lord what did you place inside
[35:08] of me hallelujah it's a constant
[35:12] progress a constant seeking a pressing
[35:15] in an overcoming a pressing through a
[35:19] battle that we are constantly in in this
[35:25] life if you want to put it this way to
[35:27] find out who we really
[35:30] are and the prophet said when we
[35:32] recognize when the bride recognizes who
[35:35] she is she'll be
[35:37] Invincible
[35:40] hallelujah

[36:08] that's going to come forth
[36:09] tonight I want
[36:11] it it
[36:13] surpasses something that goes way
[36:17] beyond our need our
[36:19] necessaries way Beyond it surpasses
[36:23] it you know we have a frame of mind
[36:26] sometimes where we think God is a god of
[36:29] lack oh you might not say it with your
[36:32] mouth but your actions your life and
[36:35] what you believe in your heart remember
[36:38] God knows your heart God knows what's in
[36:40] your mind he knows your
[36:45] thoughts and sometimes
[36:48] we we look at lack in our lives we look
[36:52] at un need needs unmet in our lives and
[36:57] we look to God and say Lord you said
[37:00] you're going to do this you said you're
[37:03] going to do that and we don't even
[37:05] realize that we are blocking the
[37:09] channel it's our view it's our faith
[37:12] it's what we believe who God is and what
[37:16] he is and and how much he has we we say
[37:21] it God is Rich my father is rich in
[37:24] Hells is in land he's rich and abundance
[37:27] of everything all spiritual things amen
[37:31] but in our own Hearts we deny ourselves
[37:34] we deny the blessings of God we deny the
[37:37] cross and what he purchased for
[37:41] us and so many different
[37:47] ways quit thinking about
[37:51] barely
[37:53] barely getting by in life

[38:21] still take the laws of God and bless
[38:23] their lives and where do you find in the
[38:26] world word of God that God said that

[46:32] things listen if you're a son and
[46:34] daughter of God you say well brother
[46:36] Tim you know God's word you know that's

[49:21] soul it's for the soul it's for your
[49:24] spirit Joy Peace Love Revelation and for
[49:28] the
[49:30] body what's the body
[49:33] need it needs all that but it also needs
[49:37] clothes
[49:39] right and I I don't I don't know about
[49:41] you but if if you are uh a proper
[49:45] husband you don't want your wife dressed
[49:47] in
[49:50] rags amen I don't think Jesus wants us
[49:53] dressing in rags
[49:56] I don't I don't agree with with with
[49:59] with these people that have cars that
[50:02] are broken down if you're passing
[50:04] through and you're coming your way up
[50:07] okay that's fine but PE I'm talking
[50:09] about people's mentality in their mind
[50:11] that stay there and
[50:14] believe that that a broken down car with
[50:18] a sticker on the back saying Jesus loves
[50:20] me I'm blessed by
[50:24] Jesus
[50:28] it's the mentality of the
[50:34] mind living Abundant Life means Joy
[50:37] gratitude fulfillment living the life of
[50:41] abundance also involves accepting and
[50:44] celebrating ones individually and living
[50:47] in a way that reflects one true self
[50:50] this includes following your
[50:54] passion reflecting your true self who
[50:57] you really
[50:59] are not being somebody who you're not
[51:02] but being at Liberty and being free who
[51:05] the son of man sets free is free indeed
[51:09] in every area of your life so you can be
[51:14] yourself God Made You individually
[51:17] special and he purposed you and he wants
[51:21] you to be yourself and express that's
[51:24] who he's going to Express through he
[51:27] planted it in his mind that's the way he
[51:30] created you your personality everything
[51:34] in such a way that he can come into it
[51:37] and express
[51:39] himself he don't want he and he can
[51:42] express himself through a vessel that's
[51:44] not being themselves because that would
[51:46] go against his word you're mixing oil
[51:50] and water you got to keep it all
[51:53] oil all together
[51:56] in sequence and how he created you
[52:00] that's what God's that's what Revelation
[52:02] does when it comes into your life it it
[52:04] aligns everything about
[52:08] you every strength that you have every
[52:12] gift that you have every portion of
[52:15] faith that God's placed inside of you
[52:18] starts coming out and manifesting in his
[52:21] fullness that's the Abundant of life
[52:24] that's within us
[52:26] oh Hallelujah Lord help me
[52:30] Jesus what does God say about Liv in
[52:32] abundancy in
[52:34] abundancy scriptures say that God will
[52:37] provide an abundant life to those who
[52:39] seek the kingdom of God first and his
[52:41] righteousness abundance is is this sense
[52:45] means a life full of everything you need
[52:49] to sustain yourself in joy and purpose
[52:53] it's our view
[52:56] of God it's our view of the
[53:00] word it's always our
[53:04] view that will show our
[53:07] abundance that will manifest our
[53:09] abundance in our
[53:10] life how we view God's
[53:18] word Jesus speaking here we must expose
[53:22] the
[53:23] thief the thief of
[53:26] abundance right before Christ said these
[53:29] words he reminded us that the thief
[53:33] comes to steal kill and
[53:37] destroy you said brother Tim you already
[53:39] said that twice now unless is three
[53:42] times I don't know if I'm going to say
[53:43] it
[53:45] again I said I want
[53:47] to hammer something
[53:51] home God wants to hammer something home
[53:57] so that you can leave with
[53:59] something you may understand even if you
[54:02] understand so hold on a minute something
[54:05] is telling me in my mind that the devil
[54:08] is
[54:09] stealing my abundance stealing my joy
[54:12] stealing my my wealth stealing my
[54:15] inheritance stealing something from
[54:23] me the Ste Ste and kill and destroy
[54:27] Satan is a destroyer of life in all his
[54:31] faculties and every
[54:34] area family marriage Health Freedom
[54:40] peace Beauty strength growth
[54:43] wealth he is stealing one of those
[54:47] things from your life but we have to
[54:50] recognize
[54:51] it and
[54:54] command
[54:55] the devil to give it back to
[54:59] us sometimes we got to command the devil
[55:03] because it's the way we
[55:05] think the way we interpret things
[55:08] sometimes our view on the word of God
[55:12] sometimes steals the abundance of the
[55:16] word from us the effects of the word
[55:19] from us oh remember what are you talking
[55:22] about brother Tim remember Satan came to
[55:26] Eve he didn't use some other
[55:31] theology he used the
[55:34] word he took the very
[55:37] word and he took the word and perverted
[55:40] it he misspoke it misrepresented
[55:45] it misplaced
[55:49] it 99% of it didn't God say
[55:56] she took it in her mind think how
[55:59] powerful that is my brothers and sisters
[56:02] she took it in her mind and believed it
[56:05] and then she went out and act on it we
[56:08] look at the original sin we look at the
[56:11] fall of Man we look at the evils that's
[56:14] in the world we look at this flesh we
[56:16] look at death that we see every day Wars
[56:20] crime violence all these things is
[56:23] because she took the word
[56:25] that that the devil spoke to her and
[56:28] believed
[56:33] it that's why God is so determined Amen
[56:38] to speak to us the word of Truth The
[56:41] Word of Life and for us to stay with
[56:44] that
[56:45] word that he has given us I'm not
[56:48] talking about the letter the letter kth
[56:51] I'm talking about the revelation of the
[56:53] word we are not to mingle with that
[56:56] revelation we are not to interpret it
[56:58] God will be his own interpreter when he
[57:01] reveals it to you he will manifest
[57:06] it we are
[57:08] vessels written Epistles read of all men
[57:13] the life that was manifested in flesh
[57:16] that we seen with our eyes that same
[57:19] life has come back into us the Bride of
[57:22] Jesus Christ and it's living it life out
[57:25] through us like Paul said it's not I who
[57:29] live he said oh Wretched Man that I am
[57:33] he's seen the difference between his
[57:35] life his past life and now the life that
[57:38] he lives is not his life but it's the
[57:41] Life of Christ and how can we in
[57:44] ourselves interpret the Life of Christ
[57:47] he interprets his own
[57:50] life we Just
[57:53] Surrender our vessel
[57:56] we just yield Our Lives to him that's
[57:59] why brother BR said it made it so simple
[58:02] read your Bible simple and pray every
[58:09] day and let God let go and let God
[58:16] hallelujah oh when God gets a man in
[58:19] that
[58:20] place gets him in that place where he
[58:24] can live
[58:25] that's his determination in this
[58:28] hour Jesus said that you may have life
[58:32] in spite of all your
[58:34] weaknesses in the flesh your
[58:36] shortcomings your mistakes your
[58:39] failures oh in spite of all these things
[58:42] Jesus said that you might be filled with
[58:44] the spirit of God with his life you see
[58:48] you know why he's saying that you know
[58:51] why he can fulfill that because the seed
[58:53] of God cannot
[58:56] sin it's not imputed to the seed of God
[58:59] any
[59:01] iniquity you see where the power lies in
[59:05] recognizing and knowing who you are and
[59:07] see where the power of God lies with
[59:09] inside of you to express and to manifest
[59:12] out of your life is when you get to that
[59:15] place when you realize that the seed of
[59:18] God that's inside of you you come in
[59:20] contact with it Hallelujah you're
[59:23] speaking to it
[59:25] it's revealing to you every day there's
[59:28] a fellowship going on between you and
[59:31] the spirit the life of God with inside
[59:33] of you and when that grows to such a
[59:37] place of maturity you recognize that the
[59:40] life that you used to live the life in
[59:42] this flesh oh God has nothing to do
[59:46] there is no sin in the life that you're
[59:50] manifesting oh
[59:53] my oh
[59:56] Jesus
[59:58] Hallelujah Jesus I said I have come in
[1:00:01] this age that you may have life and more
[1:00:03] abundantly in spite of the most evil
[1:00:06] darkest Wicked deceiving age I have come
[1:00:11] and I have overcome all the powers of he
[1:00:14] of

[1:00:20] Earth is given to me I overcame hell I
[1:00:23] overcame everything that can come
[1:00:26] against you everything that the devil
[1:00:29] can throw at you Jesus said I've
[1:00:31] overcame it Hallelujah and I've given
[1:00:35] you power to tread on serpents I given
[1:00:38] you the word of God to take in your
[1:00:43] life to create an atmosphere around your
[1:00:45] life around your home around your
[1:00:48] possessions around your inheritance I've
[1:00:51] given you that power for
[1:00:53] that stop looking at this and stop
[1:00:56] looking at that looking all over the
[1:00:58] place look here it's your own home where
[1:01:02] God wants to display himself and
[1:01:03] manifest

[1:19:11] inside of you when you speak it and go
[1:19:13] forward you don't see things manifested
[1:19:15] in your life doors opening up Red Seas
[1:19:18] opening up because you're paralyzed go
[1:19:21] scared

[1:19:38] remember Jesus has already overcome
[1:19:41] everything that we might face
[1:19:45] hallelujah
[1:19:48] hallelujah we must watch over our
[1:19:51] mind
[1:19:53] this is the
[1:19:54] territory that is the first place the
[1:19:57] enemy attacks we need to be constantly
[1:20:00] aware of what type of thoughts enter our
[1:20:04] mind what thoughts we
[1:20:07] accept Hallelujah you know if Eve would
[1:20:10] have took what Satan said to her back to
[1:20:13] her husband and said you know Satan said
[1:20:16] this that we shall surely not die her
[1:20:20] you know what her husband would have
[1:20:21] said which was the type of Christ Adam
[1:20:24] would have said no God said we will
[1:20:29] die and that's what he's saying
[1:20:33] here you need to know if the thoughts
[1:20:36] are demonic or Godly the Bible says
[1:20:39] bring every thought under the
[1:20:45] obedience Allelujah if the enemy can
[1:20:49] control your mind he controls your
[1:20:51] thought patterns when you agree with
[1:20:53] those thoughts you believe them which
[1:20:56] leads to actions your actions go
[1:20:58] according to what you think when you are
[1:21:01] watching the territory of your mind you
[1:21:04] won't just let any thought come there

[1:23:09] that the prophet came to that place
[1:23:10] where he had the devil's number oh
[1:23:13] my my brothers and sisters that's where
[1:23:16] we got to be that's where we're going to
[1:23:18] that's why we're here tonight that he
[1:23:20] has nothing to pull on us us we just
[1:23:23] ignore
[1:23:26] him we're so much in love with the Lord
[1:23:34] hallelujah hallelujah the flu is so
[1:23:36] cleared out it shouts
[1:23:39] Hallelujah it shines
[1:23:42] out clearly certainly just as clean and
[1:23:46] clear for the word of God to work
[1:23:48] through the power of God there's your
[1:23:50] Battleground there's your Battleground
[1:23:52] is back here at the beginning the mind
[1:23:55] is the gate to the spirit your mind
[1:23:58] opens up and accepts the spirit or
[1:24:01] rejects the spirit not doesn't mean only
[1:24:03] Holy
[1:24:04] Spirit could be an unclean spirit it's a
[1:24:08] worldly Spirit a doubting Spirit a fear
[1:24:11] Spirit it doesn't matter what kind of
[1:24:14] spirit it is your mind opens up the
[1:24:17] channel it's now it's up to you it's
[1:24:20] your free more agency it's your choice
[1:24:23] now God give you the word he give you
[1:24:26] the sword he's been instructing you he's
[1:24:29] been training you all these years now
[1:24:33] he's given it to you you take it you say
[1:24:37] to this mountain you speak and go
[1:24:40] forward you take my power you take my
[1:24:43] word you take my spirit and you go
[1:24:48] forth there's nothing more greater that
[1:24:51] he wants to see
[1:24:52] for you you think a father when he built
[1:24:56] a business up or an Empire up he wants
[1:24:59] to see his son come one day into that
[1:25:02] power and then see see him stand back
[1:25:06] and see his son take that
[1:25:09] Throne take that control and that power
[1:25:12] and use it and there's nothing more
[1:25:15] glorious for the father to see that son
[1:25:19] manifest in that power amen and there's
[1:25:22] nothing glorious for the Lord when he
[1:25:24] sees what he did on the cross what he
[1:25:26] overcame in Garden Gethsemane what he
[1:25:29] purchased for us amen taking his power
[1:25:33] his authority and using it in our
[1:25:40] lives if you're at a place where it's
[1:25:42] still oh the Lord the Lord the Lord the
[1:25:44] lord I can't do nothing then your faith
[1:25:47] needs to
[1:25:48] come to this
[1:25:51] place because because these are the
[1:25:52] prophecies for the bride in the last
[1:25:54] days this is what's going to produce a
[1:25:56] body change in her Hallelujah when she
[1:25:59] puts on this
[1:26:00] word
[1:26:02] hallelujah When Faith is revealed
[1:26:04] there's a space of what we call time
[1:26:07] before there's a
[1:26:09] manifestation and in that space of time
[1:26:12] there is understanding and those two
[1:26:14] things understanding and time those
[1:26:16] things relate to us and not God you see
[1:26:20] brother brother Braham said that when
[1:26:22] God revealed to Abraham you're going to
[1:26:25] have a son he revealed Faith he gave him
[1:26:28] Faith now 25 years is a space of time
[1:26:33] and what did what what happened in that
[1:26:36] time and and understanding well time
[1:26:40] went by and it went by and it went by
[1:26:43] you know why because God don't deal with
[1:26:45] time what he spoken he said what he's
[1:26:48] spoken will happen and he confirmed it
[1:26:51] all the way down no matter what time or
[1:26:55] understanding that Abraham and Sarah had
[1:26:57] when they went with the bondswoman
[1:26:59] that's their understanding that's why
[1:27:01] the Bible says lean not to your own
[1:27:03] understanding God didn't say by the
[1:27:05] bonds wom God didn't say that he's going
[1:27:08] to uh pass down the sea through Ishmael
[1:27:11] he said through Isaac to the one son
[1:27:14] through Sarah that I
[1:27:17] promised and then here come the
[1:27:20] manifestation you see
[1:27:22] God was faithful and true to his word
[1:27:27] but why was there an ishmail and a Bond
[1:27:32] woman because of this say lean not to
[1:27:35] your own
[1:27:37] understanding this got in the
[1:27:39] way in that space my brothers and
[1:27:42] sisters when God Reveals His word
[1:27:44] there's always going to be with us time
[1:27:47] and
[1:27:48] understanding that has nothing to do
[1:27:50] with God God only sees what he's
[1:27:53] revealed God only sees what he's
[1:27:55] promised us and when we can get to a
[1:27:58] place where we get rid of time and our
[1:28:00] own understanding and only see what God
[1:28:02] has revealed to
[1:28:04] us then you're walking by faith
[1:28:09] hallelujah
[1:28:11] amen let me just pass over a few things
[1:28:15] here bite the musicians
[1:28:18] up
[1:28:20] Hallelujah Acts 1 8 and N we shall
[1:28:25] receive power when the Holy Ghost comes
[1:28:27] upon us and in us and we will be
[1:28:30] witnesses to people will witness the
[1:28:33] manifestation of the power of God
[1:28:35] through the Holy Spirit they will see
[1:28:37] the word becoming a manifestation before
[1:28:40] their very eyes again in these last days
[1:28:43] I will do a short and quick work I will
[1:28:46] do a manifestation the Lord
