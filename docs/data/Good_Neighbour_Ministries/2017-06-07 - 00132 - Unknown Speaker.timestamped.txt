[0:34] good please be
[0:38] seated now uh lights please so that I
[0:41] can easily
[0:45] um kind of tell you what's happening
[0:49] okay first of all uh this is one of the
[0:53] brothers that we have
[0:55] supported and
[0:57] um this brother as you know know you may
[1:01] not know he was in the bush actually
[1:03] brother coffee witnessed to him I went
[1:07] over there um some years ago about four
[1:11] um and um he ministered there was
[1:15] ministering in the bush and I felt his
[1:18] ministry was a little bit higher than
[1:22] that and he's a brother he's a goget
[1:25] he's young his wife is Young he had his
[1:28] young wife and first child in the bush
[1:31] there and they were ministering and so
[1:34] we went and preached the gospel there
[1:36] for them um with all the mosquitoes and
[1:39] everything else like that anyway I felt
[1:42] that he had more talent and and
[1:44] anointing use it closer to the city now
[1:49] so I I told him I said brother you
[1:51] should move out but he didn't think it
[1:53] was wise but anyway what happened the
[1:56] denominational people stirred up some
[1:57] trouble there and he finally had to move
[2:00] out and he moved very I kind of
[2:03] directed closer to arra the main capital
[2:06] city on the outskirts and him his wife
[2:10] young wife they started
[2:12] witnessing but people got attracted for
[2:15] them and what happened is that um he um
[2:19] the chief or in the area noticed the
[2:22] change in the lives of the people and so
[2:25] he called him in and and and told him
[2:28] that he wanted to help him make it short
[2:30] he offered him to give him some land and
[2:34] so we sent you we sent down $1,000 from
[2:38] here and um with that the chief gave him
[2:43] uh I don't know if I can't tell how many
[2:45] to three four or 5 acres of land but
[2:48] it's a large set of land that he's even
[2:50] farming on it and the church is still on
[2:53] it and so he started the church there
[2:57] with just poles and attached roof
[3:00] and again we heard about that and again
[3:04] we contributed or sent uh the money for
[3:08] him to be able to start building this
[3:11] little building that you see there and
[3:15] through the three or four years uh we
[3:18] kept helping him and this is just a
[3:22] little bit this is a bit with the result
[3:25] of our sending maybe five or 6,000
[3:30] over theal of the brother right amen see
[3:33] the result of it amen One
[3:35] [Applause]
[3:42] Soul not one soul is worth more than
[3:45] that but it's not one Soul as you can
[3:48] see by the grace of God and he's just

[11:40] next sister Simon taking
[11:43] [Music]
[11:44] pictures the pastor's
[11:48] wife this is the young the next Pastor
[11:51] older
[11:52] man young
[11:56] Minister okay that's that's
[12:01] fine that's fine Brother for for this
[12:04] you can hit
[12:06] brother we have a lot more that we can
[12:13] show see that okay
[12:18] now this whole that brother Michael's
[12:22] Church even though it's on the edge of
[12:25] the city it's not in the
[12:27] city so of course all of this is news
[12:29] was is the signment the driving the
[12:32] traffic the traffic jams like you never
[12:35] seen traffic jams even more than you see
[12:39] here in
[12:40] Toronto cars in the city the city has
[12:44] millions and it's like confusion but
[12:48] seemingly they get less acci than we
[12:51] do anyway we had to drive two almost two
[12:55] hours outside of the city so when I say
[12:59] outside of the city two hours
[13:03] outside and then we turned down a dirt
[13:08] road and of course this so where are we
[13:12] going we're going down a dirt road and
[13:15] the car is going up and down it's it's
[13:18] not the road when you imagine our road
[13:21] it's dirt it's holes it's B holes we're
[13:24] going and there bushes on two sides
[13:27] looks like they're going in the middle
[13:28] of nowhere like the taking you somewhere
[13:30] to kidnap
[13:34] you foreigners with clothing and
[13:37] everything and bags so so anywhere we're
[13:41] going and then at one point she said the
[13:44] car can't go any further because there
[13:46] is little not little big holes in the
[13:50] ground and everything you can't possibly
[13:51] see how a car could go there but somehow
[13:55] you're making the TR the car is going
[13:59] then we hit to a point where a stream
[14:01] goes across the
[14:03] road you said oh no this is it she said
[14:06] let's get out now because we may have to
[14:09] you know walk in the water and get on
[14:11] the other side and walk up they said no
[14:14] no no no no you don't get out Mama
[14:17] staying they call her mama you staying
[14:20] don't come
[14:21] out and everything so she stayed in and
[14:24] it drove and T the car goes into the
[14:27] ditch and it got
[14:33] stop and the car come out but you know
[14:38] how it is that nothing worries and
[14:41] bothers them some of the brothers that
[14:43] were there got down there and pushed
[14:47] Ando pushed it out and came up on the
[14:50] other side and drove in and uh of course
[14:54] the driver that brought us when he got
[14:56] to where the church is he just turned
[14:58] back left took his car and went back he
[15:01] wasn't a Christian he was the driver
[15:04] given to me by one of the like I told
[15:07] you there's very wealthy man there a
[15:11] good friend of the president that gives
[15:14] me a car and a driver so he sent the
[15:16] driver with the vehicle and this guy
[15:19] couldn't take it and he
[15:22] just he's from Africa and he turned back
[15:25] and he went back right anyway uh so so
[15:29] we went up there and that's how we got
[15:30] to the church I just want you to know
[15:32] it's not a
[15:33] picnic and we didn't go there and just
[15:37] have a some people will use the term
[15:40] sometimes when I go on a ter vasion you
[15:43] go on a vasion or something it's not a
[15:46] vacation uh or anything like that and um
[15:49] of
[15:50] course I wasn't thinking of a mosquitoes
[15:53] and everything but every time a mosquito
[15:55] come around they worry about her getting
[15:58] with uh by the mosquitoes because that's
[16:01] why they make you take yellow fever
[16:02] shots malaria before you go there you
[16:05] can't you can't even go in the country
[16:07] unless you show the documentation that
[16:10] you had the shots right so I want no
[16:15] it's not I come back when I come back I
[16:17] don't consider that so I say oh it was a
[16:19] wonderful trip and this and that but
[16:22] when I take her with me then I become
[16:24] conscious that hey wait a minute all
[16:25] this stuff here I don't even mention
[16:29] because I take it for granted because
[16:31] I've been going to Africa over and over
[16:34] but now I become conscious that little
[16:36] things that I come it means
[16:39] something so I thought I need to tell
[16:42] you that and that was during the day we
[16:44] went to that church now this church is
[16:47] in the city of
[16:49] ARA in the city of ARA and this is night
[16:54] time so the pictures would not be as
[16:57] clear but we went there in the Night by
[17:00] the grace of God uh that's the reason I
[17:03] couldn't get a picture of the outside of
[17:06] the church this is another brother
[17:08] brother op the first brother that we uh
[17:12] started to help things are more um uh is
[17:17] different for him but this is the what
[17:20] he has put up also in the
[17:24] City by God's grace uh the building he
[17:29] has is uh believe 30
[17:33] 50 30 by 30 30 by 50 30 by 50 uh and so
[17:41] and all the membership are not there
[17:42] because it rain it rain and that is this
[17:45] crowd just like my crowd you know when
[17:47] it rain or during the week Wednesday
[17:50] night you know the people I'm looking at
[17:52] here not here uh they're somewhere else
[17:55] wherever so he was embarrassed just
[17:58] sometimes like I
[17:59] and he was embarrassed that all of his
[18:02] uh Church did not come out but
[18:04] nevertheless we had a wonderful service
[18:07] move on
[18:08] Brothers praise the Lord
[18:12] hallelujah stop this is the pastor and
[18:15] his wife brother op and his wife myself
[18:19] and my wife sister Simon praise the Lord
[18:23] of course brother coffee was there with
[18:25] us and we took a picture of some of the
[18:28] the brothers that assist this pastor uh
[18:32] there by God's grace move
[18:38] on and that's it there's no more
[18:42] pictures that's all right if there's no
[18:44] more pictures
[18:45] then that's as many as I took I didn't
[18:48] want to extend it but we thank the Lord
[18:52] for those Brothers um I just want to say
[18:56] uh with what we sent to help this
[18:58] brethren just look at what they did amen
[19:01] look at what they
[19:02] [Applause]
[19:09] come and there's not a value on these
[19:12] Souls now I told these
[19:15] brothers I said now we want to take you
[19:18] to our next phase now because you're
[19:22] still in a state where um conditions
[19:25] where people look at the church and it's
[19:27] just a little
[19:29] Thing by the sideway we want to be able
[19:31] to first of all be able to supply them
[19:35] with
[19:36] fans proper fans at least they don't
[19:39] have air conditioning but they can have
[19:42] some electric fans up in the ceiling to
[19:45] make it a little cooler for the people
[19:47] because I felt it as you can see um uh
[19:50] so they need and those are things that
[19:53] we can supply by the grace of God that's
[19:57] not hard for anybody to do here uh I can
[20:00] tell one of the young
[20:02] peop even if you're selling newspapers
[20:06] do you think God will help you to be
[20:07] able to um buy a fan for us to be able
[20:11] to send to
[20:14] Africa and I'm sure among the young
[20:17] people alone can supply those
[20:20] FS what about us adults I mean what is
[20:23] one F to
[20:24] [Music]
[20:26] you I I I know it's church needs four
[20:30] right to put up in their ceilings uh so
[20:33] that they can at least cool the place
[20:36] while um they having their services and
[20:39] I tell you it's a different heat than we
[20:42] have here it's so it's so hot there it
[20:45] was 90 something degrees of course I
[20:47] remember one day it was 90 something
[20:49] where you sit there and you're not
[20:50] moving and yet
[20:52] to just watch if you start to
[20:55] move and they move
[20:59] and they move more than
[21:01] us praise God hall because they don't
[21:04] just worship God and clap their hands
[21:06] only they are dancing praise God
[21:09] remember that's a different culture and
[21:11] you don't say oh that's not you know I
[21:14] don't know the prophet would say about
[21:16] that we brother R joined them when he
[21:18] was in South Africa and the brothers
[21:21] were telling him the same thing well you
[21:23] know that music is a little lightly and
[21:26] he's dancing with them he say you don't
[21:28] know what's going on he says they're
[21:30] worshiping they're worshiping the same
[21:32] God only they don't know his name yet
[21:35] right and they are trying to worship him
[21:38] and ask for his protection when they go
[21:40] to hunt those lions and he said that's
[21:42] why I came down and I was dancing with
[21:44] them because I know who they were
[21:45] praised and who they were worshiping in
[21:48] that regard so you got to understand
[21:50] that praise the Lord let me repeat this
[21:53] and and let you understand it what early
[21:57] uh what the Christianity has done
[22:00] originally and what the Pentecostal is
[22:02] even
[22:03] doing they they go saying they're going
[22:06] to christianize the people but instead
[22:08] of that they americanize them or try to
[22:13] transport your culture here and place it
[22:16] on the people and think that's what
[22:17] makes them Christian that's not what
[22:20] makes them Christian is a change of
[22:22] heart right is the change of the heart
[22:24] is what makes them a Believer that's
[22:26] right praise the name of the Lord you
[22:28] know brother Bram uh uh went there in
[22:31] South Africa and preached the gospel and
[22:33] there was what over what two or
[22:36] 300,000 people jammed up and he never
[22:40] went a preach telling them take off all
[22:42] those loin cloths and pull off this and
[22:45] do he just preached the word and he said
[22:48] as he preached the word he noticed the
[22:51] women slipping away they're slipping
[22:54] away and coming back covered you didn't
[22:56] have to tell them nothing when the Holy
[22:58] Ghost anointing come preach the they
[23:00] going to
[23:02] change their own way have to go
[23:05] criticizing people you know like uh I
[23:08] was in I'm diverting a little bit in
[23:11] Ohio where a certain Minister there was
[23:13] an Indian preacher came over and he was
[23:17] saying oh he says brother he says you
[23:19] got to go back to India and tell all
[23:20] this women not to wear the saries like
[23:23] that you know with their arms showing
[23:25] outside and you know the Sor being like
[23:28] that maybe their breast will show and
[23:30] he's turned on like that the brother
[23:32] says yes brother the brother was very
[23:34] patient he kept saying yes brother and
[23:37] you know and after a while the man got
[23:38] tired of it right and L didn't know that
[23:42] this man was a captain in the Indian Air
[23:45] Force and a brilliant man intellectually
[23:48] just that he wasn't showing it he say he
[23:50] says what are you he got angry said what
[23:52] are you talking about you're telling me
[23:55] about the women in the S he says go just
[23:58] go all on the street there and look at
[23:59] your women what are you talking to me
[24:02] about you just shut up and hold your
[24:04] peace and don't say nothing else because
[24:06] he didn't want to really explode and get
[24:08] on he just shut him up in that way but
[24:11] we got to understand that this is what
[24:13] has been happening culture being
[24:15] transported rather than Christianity
[24:17] trying to turn them into English or turn
[24:20] them into French or whatever rather than
[24:22] turning them into
[24:24] Christians you don't have to dress like
[24:26] you they don't have to sing like you
[24:29] they don't have to have your kind of
[24:31] music that you love amen they just have
[24:34] to use the music that they already have
[24:37] and praise God and give God the glory in
[24:40] that way so I just thoughted mention
[24:42] that in passion we going there to
[24:44] christianize
[24:46] them not to make them Canadian or
[24:49] American or English or whatever praise
[24:52] the Lord amen so um uh it was wonderful
[24:55] to take the gospel we want to be able to
[24:57] help them even more
[24:59] and I would like for us to um ramp up
[25:02] our missionary
[25:03] program amen CU we know reliable men
[25:08] that we can
[25:10] support by the grace of God and we will
[25:13] and we want to support them by by God's
[25:16] grace amen uh this building here in the
[25:20] last building in
[25:22] arra they uh both of them need help but
[25:26] this one needs to be able to build his
[25:29] building properly I just looking at it
[25:31] you can tell it's not um uh like it
[25:34] should be anyway and we want to have you
[25:39] place your support there to be able to
[25:42] do something like that for the glory of
[25:44] God amen amen why you stop and think how
[25:48] long we have on the earth even if you
[25:50] live 100 what's 100
[25:53] years do what we can while we are here
[25:58] amen praise the Lord I remember going to
[26:03] Trinidad but before I went to Trinidad
[26:06] there was a brother Indian brother from
[26:08] Trad that would come to Guyana and help
[26:11] to spread the gospel brother di
[26:15] Oar and this man would uh walk about
[26:19] with no shoes on his feet bef footed
[26:23] walk around like that and helping us
[26:26] with preaching the gospel and preach he
[26:28] was a preacher too that's where in
[26:30] Bethlehem Tabernacle our brother Albert
[26:33] green is now the pastor of the church
[26:35] there would about three 300 people in it
[26:38] anyway so um he used to come over there
[26:42] and preach the gospel then he invite me
[26:44] over I went to visit him in Trinidad
[26:46] preach for him brother vindal was under
[26:49] his ministry at that time and he was
[26:51] just a young young man and I visited
[26:55] with him when he was under the bottom of
[26:57] a house preaching to 50 people or so and
[27:01] selling eggs for brother the rable jars
[27:05] business and those days this is not to
[27:08] belittle brother de brother um Vin but
[27:12] to show you that even how his ministry
[27:14] raised from there until now it's
[27:17] worldwide and a powerful Minister but um
[27:22] brother Ry uh went on with this ministry
[27:26] for many years and then he died
[27:28] when he died they they found out even
[27:32] his wife didn't know because he grew to
[27:36] be a wealthy very wealthy man he was
[27:39] humbl to God God began to bless him he
[27:42] end up having rice fields can Fields
[27:46] malls he got super
[27:49] wealthy surrendering to God and doing
[27:52] the will of God and took his own
[27:55] money and they found out he built Church
[27:58] in BR he built Church in this island he
[28:00] built Church in that Island nobody knew
[28:03] he built Church in that Island he was a
[28:06] pastor but he took his money and he
[28:08] built churches built churches a whole
[28:11] bunch of churches that he built with his
[28:14] own money and then they understood why
[28:16] God bless him that way why he grew why
[28:19] he expanded to that point right now
[28:21] where his actually his his children are
[28:25] in no
[28:26] need all of them themselves are now
[28:29] wealthy thanks be to God so I'm asking
[28:32] the
[28:33] question why don't are we have people in
[28:36] here that capable of doing that uh why
[28:40] do we have to always uh you know uh
[28:44] appeal for funds we do that because to
[28:46] give all of you the opportunity cuz you
[28:49] can't lift the burden on just certain
[28:51] people and all you can have a part but
[28:53] all you don't have the capacity but I'm
[28:56] just opening your minds now don't don't
[28:58] don't take what I'm saying wrong I'm
[29:00] saying you got to understand why God
[29:02] positionally placed every one of you
[29:04] here in his church it's so that you can
[29:07] do your part amen look I'm not here for
[29:10] you to enrich me I'm not rich and you
[29:14] not enriching me because I'm giving most
[29:16] of whatever comes to me away anyway amen
[29:19] praise the Lord and I am helping where I
[29:22] can for the glory of God what I'm saying
[29:26] that Brothers we got to see this thing
[29:28] is
[29:29] real this thing is not a joke that's
[29:32] right this thing is not something I'm
[29:34] watching you to see what you do before I
[29:36] do or you do what God put in your heart
[29:39] amen glory to God Amen somebody say oh
[29:43] I'm going to back that one I'm going to
[29:45] back that one I'm going to support that
[29:47] one I'm going to build this I'm going to
[29:50] buy that I'm going to do this that's how
[29:52] it's going to be and then our hearts are
[29:54] so real that we a to reach out and touch
[29:57] the people for the graise of God the
[30:00] last one has got to come in that means
[30:02] we got to send out this gospel we have
[30:05] to send it out everywhere for the glory
[30:07] of God hallelujah and change the lives
[30:09] of the people praise God hallelujah amen
[30:13] and the Lord has helped me to grant me
[30:15] some favor like I said a member of the
[30:18] parliament was there to to meet
[30:22] me uh the car that the former president
[30:25] us is a older now but uh I was granted
[30:30] that same SUV again to use with a driver
[30:33] um by God's grace so I want to be able
[30:37] to use some of that influence to be able
[30:39] to do what a lot of the brothers there
[30:42] even though some of them have big
[30:44] churches
[30:45] 1,500 800 whatever but they don't have
[30:49] the reach they don't know these people
[30:52] and some of them can't even dare to
[30:53] approach these people or talk to them
[30:56] like that but God
[30:58] has granted me that and we want to be
[31:02] able to use it for his Hallelujah uh I
[31:06] didn't realize it but I was going to
[31:08] bring I felt to bring the book influence
[31:11] but now I understand I'm not preaching
[31:13] from it but influence God allows you to
[31:17] Grant give you favor and he gives you
[31:19] that not to use for yourself but to be
[31:22] able to use it for the gospel that's
[31:24] right to touch the lives of people amen
[31:27] praise the Lord
[31:28] uh I was already told you know uh if you
[31:32] if you want anything any kind of
[31:35] registration this you know that anything
[31:37] concerning that uh I'll take care of it
[31:40] I'll see that it happens praise the Lord
[31:43] amen and if you know if you don't know
[31:46] about Africa nothing happens unless you
[31:48] know
[31:49] somebody or you got washes of money to
[31:53] spend if you have money money lots of
[31:56] money opens doors
[31:58] other than that you got to have
[32:00] influence if you don't have influence
[32:02] you tell us you go somewhere and you say
[32:04] oh uh or the gentleman goes with you and
[32:07] say Mr s and oh you know him oh right

[32:17] some line in the Heat and wait for hours
[32:20] and hours and come back day after day or
[32:23] week weeks like that so praise God the
[32:27] Lord bless

[32:34] um know some things about me so you got
[32:37] to you you I want to give you a little
[32:39] more understanding of who is your pastor

[33:23] exposion go back to the first one
[33:26] brother first one

[33:36] there this is after in 20 uh in
[33:42] the early part 20 whatever it was I went
[33:47] in we went in myself and brother P went
[33:51] into the middle of the Sudan war in the
[33:55] bush flying in on an old Russian plane
[34:00] the wings held together by
[34:05] wires and goats and chickens and
[34:08] everything in the plane with
[34:12] us and antinoff or they call it anyway
[34:15] we flew in landed on a dirt
[34:19] patch and went into uh a Sudanese
[34:24] Village in the city of not City Town or
[34:28] Village called Nial province of Nial and
[34:31] we there we came out there is no hotels
[34:35] there there's no houses there there's
[34:38] only the native HS called
[34:41] Tas they kind of rounded like that and
[34:44] the door is low like this dressed like
[34:48] the eye of a needle right when Jus said
[34:51] you must need go through the eye of a
[34:53] needle is that if you arrive L to
[34:55] Jerusalem there was just openings like
[34:57] that
[34:58] big enough for you to need them and go
[35:00] through so you need to humble yourself
[35:02] so we went through that and then you
[35:04] into that Tuka and there's a skin there
[35:07] that's all protecting you from any wild
[35:09] diny Ms that would want to come track
[35:10] you out in the
[35:12] night so that's where we slept and of
[35:15] course mosquitoes are going around and
[35:17] everything else and of course the toilet
[35:19] it's just an open pit that's some
[35:22] distance away and of course there's no
[35:24] electric lights it's bit black you can't
[35:26] see your hand even if you put it like
[35:27] that
[35:28] right in front of
[35:30] you so and uh of course the uh in the
[35:34] night you want to go to the washroom of
[35:36] course I didn't go to the
[35:39] washroom I just stood right beside the
[35:41] thing there I wasn't going
[35:44] any and even to go out of it was was a
[35:47] nerve rack but you can't see anything to
[35:51] protect yourself or no if I mean that
[35:53] they're telling you when you get out of
[35:56] the of the homo that they had turn
[35:58] across make sure that you knock out your
[36:01] shoes well you knock out your shoes
[36:03] scorpions snakes anything could be in
[36:05] the shoes so it was like
[36:08] that it was like
[36:10] that anyway we we stayed in there we
[36:14] preach the gospel not under a temp not
[36:16] in a Auditorium like this but under a
[36:19] huge
[36:21] tree and word has gone out that these
[36:25] two Bishops were coming
[36:28] and people walked for one week from in
[36:32] the bush so there was thousands under
[36:35] the tree and we preached the gospel
[36:38] there a young man went with us and he
[36:42] was
[36:43] playing uh one of these
[36:45] instruments and he came with us he was
[36:48] just
[36:49] young uh let me let me tell you this
[36:51] quickly when he came out of the Bush it
[36:54] wouldn't it didn't take long he ascended
[36:56] to fame
[36:58] and prosperity now he's a he's one of
[37:01] the leading saxophonist in the United
[37:04] States and he's out of my sight now I
[37:06] don't even hear from him anymore but he
[37:09] went in with us we weren't even thinking
[37:11] about that but he came out
[37:13] back so there we were and we preach to
[37:18] the people under the under the street
[37:20] under those
[37:21] conditions you don't mind if this is the
[37:23] service for today you're not hearing
[37:27] preaching as you think of
[37:29] preing but we preach to them and then
[37:32] you know to welcome us they kill the
[37:35] goat and they and they began to roast it
[37:39] on the fire and then they throw it in a
[37:41] pot and they cook it like that and
[37:44] myself and um the others that were with
[37:47] us uh were there and so we at when
[37:51] you're eating the meat and eating the
[37:53] sto there is grit there is sand in it
[37:57] everything else you know we didn't spit
[37:59] it out or anything like that we e but
[38:02] that's where we are you're a missionary
[38:03] you read praise God I'm not used to this
[38:06] turn up my nose my
[38:09] face in front of them like no I we we
[38:13] went right there amongst them and we
[38:16] took part of everything else glory to
[38:19] God and
[38:21] anyway I was able to meet these soldiers
[38:25] you know then you see troops going by AK
[38:28] 47 you know was war so I met we sitting
[38:32] with the leaders and we drinking coffee
[38:35] or tea or whatever they have on this
[38:38] Green net stuff you know soldiers use
[38:41] anyway make that short cut that we came
[38:44] back out we did what we could you know
[38:46] we sent 40 foot containers maybe twice
[38:48] to help them Ram jammed with stuff from
[38:53] here in Canada uh cost us thousands of
[38:56] dollars to send in
[38:58] but it was an assistance be help people
[39:01] by God's grace praise the Lord now we we
[39:06] eased up on doing a lot of that stuff we
[39:08] we sent stuff like that the grenader the
[39:10] island the grenader and and a team went
[39:13] over we distributed it that's action
[39:17] praise the lord we actually acting on
[39:19] the word and doing things for his glory
[39:22] amen amen so Mak it sure after we came
[39:27] back
[39:28] maybe a year or two years later I
[39:31] received
[39:32] this in an official envelope with the
[39:36] official seal of the government of South
[39:39] Sudan the northern Sudan is
[39:44] Muslim and a lot of terrorism there and
[39:46] they were the ones that were killing the
[39:49] people in southern Sudan who most of
[39:52] them are Christians at a presbyterian
[39:55] Baptist nazarine Lutheran and so on Amen
[39:59] and they were killing them and that's
[40:01] where I had a meeting with all the
[40:03] priests and ministers and everything
[40:05] else and none of them were fighting one
[40:07] another you know they realized one thing
[40:09] that when the Muslims come down they
[40:11] weren't asking you which denomination
[40:12] you
[40:14] belong as long as you're a Christian
[40:16] you're dead that's simple so you'll be
[40:19] surprised they got together and we had a
[40:21] wonderful meeting there by go the grace
[40:24] of God so this invitation came
[40:28] Mo it up
[40:30] now and you can read it if you
[40:34] like look at how they address this is
[40:37] kind of
[40:44] respect and brief what that is doing is
[40:47] inviting
[40:48] me to the
[40:52] inauguration of the
[40:54] president of Southern so that and I'm
[40:59] showing it to you now I'm just showing
[41:01] it to you I don't walk around showing it
[41:02] to everybody but I'm showing it to you
[41:04] now so that you see I'm not just talking
[41:06] words to make myself look good or
[41:09] something like that I rather hide it but
[41:12] I'm I felt led today to show it to you
[41:17] who have never seen this or you don't
[41:19] really know about it except my tofe so
[41:23] you see it there and signed by the Pres
[41:27] pres president he's still he's he's in
[41:31] power right now this is the present
[41:34] president that's his official
[41:36] Citizen and by the way when I was going
[41:38] there I went to the airport and they
[41:41] said the um you need a
[41:44] visa and I called him he laughed he says
[41:49] you don't need a visa he says those
[41:51] little clerks don't know what they're
[41:53] talking
[41:54] about he said you show them that letter
[41:58] they have to let you through they have
[42:01] to let you through so I told them I said
[42:05] well all I have is this letter when I
[42:08] pull the letter out and the supervisor
[42:10] saw it the supervisor oh yes sir it's
[42:12] sir and sir and everything else in
[42:14] backpack everything is taken care of
[42:17] when I landed in Ethiopia to take the
[42:20] last flight into the Sudan same thing
[42:22] happened they were trying to stop and
[42:24] then I pulled out the letter and I
[42:26] showed them by the way the atmosphere
[42:28] changed everybody's running around
[42:30] everything else and of course I went
[42:32] over there praise the Lord are you
[42:34] moving it before I tell you brother it's
[42:37] okay now it's all right but that's okay
[42:41] um I want you to see this also not just
[42:44] over in Africa but here in the United
[42:47] States if you can read it you'll see
[42:49] that's from the state of
[42:52] Virgin right that this took place here
[42:57] by going in there and preaching in where
[42:59] the pastor church he had at the time and
[43:02] do helping in the community having
[43:05] Community meetings inside the community
[43:07] uh there by the grace of God this
[43:10] was issued to
[43:12] me by the grace by God's uh giving me
[43:17] favor okay move to the next one up
[43:22] brother okay that's I'm bringing this
[43:25] home now that's showing you
[43:27] right here in the city of
[43:32] Hamilton uh we did a great uh campaign
[43:36] there called Orban Harvest we brought in
[43:40] brother Brooks we brought in the LA Fon
[43:42] we brought him you know brother P came
[43:45] in and so like that and we for from
[43:49] Friday Saturday and Sunday we carried
[43:51] this on and during that time we
[43:55] collected from various merchants and
[43:59] various business peoples candles soup
[44:03] big corporations different ones giving
[44:06] food some give use clothing membership
[44:09] gave what they had and so on and for
[44:12] those three days we were giving out food
[44:15] and
[44:17] clothing
[44:18] without uh any donations or anybody we
[44:21] refus to take any
[44:23] donations we wanted the people to
[44:26] absolutely know that we not here like
[44:27] the denominations to trick you into
[44:30] joining them by giving you food and
[44:33] clothing to obligate you we are here to
[44:35] do the will of
[44:37] God and um as a result of that in the
[44:42] middle of the meeting we were preaching
[44:44] we preached the gospel using wisdom not
[44:46] just going out there and you know
[44:49] blasting them with a prophet right away
[44:51] but telling them about the doctrines of
[44:53] the Prophet how it differs from the
[44:56] denomination and in one of those
[44:58] meetings as you know the Holy Spirit
[44:59] fell and people came and true themselves
[45:02] in the baptism time we baptized a sister
[45:05] from Iran that was a Muslim all her life
[45:08] but when she heard the word on that
[45:10] fashion of the Holy Ghost she just went
[45:13] into the water with baptized her and her
[45:15] husband Victor praise God and others
[45:19] were baptized in that meeting amen
[45:21] praise the Lord and that is the reason
[45:24] why the church that we had in hon
[45:27] up on the mountain there was about 300
[45:32] people in it and on a Sunday it was jam
[45:34] packed with like 450 people and no
[45:37] parking and and there was no more place
[45:40] and that's why we moved from there and
[45:43] of course you know from that some of the
[45:47] grandon church came from here as a
[45:50] result of that uh because there was no
[45:53] more place and stuff like that and
[45:55] things were getting cramped
[45:57] and uh so anyway so that's the
[46:01] Commendation from the mayor for how it
[46:06] affected the community people that were
[46:08] not members of the church never became
[46:10] members of the church would be you mean
[46:13] no no charge you mean nothing and they
[46:15] would be walking away
[46:17] crying nobody ever gave me anything for
[46:20] nothing nobody ever done anything they
[46:22] would be going away literally weeping
[46:26] and we were able to um track that we
[46:30] helped over 6 to 7,000
[46:34] people and that hit the
[46:37] newspapers and of course it caught the
[46:40] eye and ears of the powers and so they
[46:43] issued that uh to myself and my wife
[46:52] next and and and again the next here I
[46:57] believe Again by the grace of God can
[47:00] move it up again
[47:03] brother
