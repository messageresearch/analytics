each one of us are unique in our own way and and the spirit of God ministers through us and gives you something amen and that's how we're building up this body amen a mighty Army amen you may be seen it amen Mighty Army being built up in this hour Hallelujah Faith unto Faith Glory unto glory amen pressing on to the kingdom of God Amen hallelujah it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen amen let us go to uh the scriptures tonight this Bible study so we'll just be read in a lot of scripture and some quotes and and pray that God will give us a little bit of inspiration on it Hallelujah and God will speak to your heart somehow some way that you'll leave today and and uh something will open up to you amen Ephesians 4 16 is a pretty lengthy scripture here because I want to talk about um uh character under the power of the third pull will overcome a character that's under the power of the third poll which we know the third poll is the revealing of the word amen so a character under the revealing of the word will overcome in this hour God has given us everything that we have need of he's given us everything we there's nothing that he's lacked in this bride and and nothing that uh you know uh Abraham might and Sarah might have thought you know or they might have thought in that day you know there was something lacking but when God speaks his word when God gives a promise everything is there everything that it that is needed is released through the spoken word to make it come to pass and fulfill so everything that is spoken and that's what we have to we have to come into the house of the Lord not only the house of Lord but seven days a week we gotta believe that in our heart regardless of what we're seeing or what we're experiencing we got to believe that above anything else we got to believe this word when we start believing that word like this we're going to start seeing that same character that was developed in the prophet in US amen Ephesians 4 16. from whom the whole body fitly joined together and come backed by that which joint every joint supplyeth according to the affection working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love this I say therefore and testify in the Lord that yea henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having the understand and darken being aliated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their hearts who being passed feeling have given themself over to lucidness which means sexual weakness to work all uncleanness with greediness but yea have not so learned Christ if so be that ye have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus that ye put off concern in the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that ye put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness amen as we go along here you're seeing the character of God amen it's all in the scripture wherefore putting away lion speaking every man truth to his neighbor for we are members one of another be ye angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labor working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to give to them to him that needeth let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of your Redemption let all bitterness and all wrath and all anger and clamor and evil speak and put away from you with all malice be kind one to another tenderhearted forgiven one another even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you wow wow Hallelujah first Peter 5 8. one more scripture before we have our seats a little shorter one be sober be diligent because your adverse Theory the Devil is a roaring lion walking about seeking who he may devour whom resists steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in the Brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace who had called us onto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen settle you Hallelujah let us pray father we thank you Lord for your word tonight thank you for your people but most of all thank you for your presence oh God we are nothing without you lord we're just reporting for service father both speaker and hearer Lord we have gathered together today Lord under this Supernatural tenth father of Revelation father Lord that only can be given by you by your spirit father flesh and blood has not revealed it but my Father which is in heaven has revealed it father we're asking you said ask abundantly that we may receive we're asking tonight Lord that you would come Lord and that we may receive Revelation father Revelation unto Revelation father Lord that that you can fulfill what you have spoken in our lives we are called for a purpose Lord and we are here for a purpose Lord oh God Lord let that be fulfilled now father bind every contrary Spirit Lord take control of the atmosphere and give Liberty to the Sons and Daughters of God here tonight Lord take us and move us in Every Which Way father fill us and possess us father that you may be glorified that we may lift you up and that you may draw us unto you father higher in the word tonight father we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you succeeded amen thank you Lord be sobered be aware of Hallelujah don't be sleeping be awake Hallelujah be steadfast recognize the devil resist the devil amen and when we suffer it says right here our suffering brings us to a place of perfection he he makes us perfect he establishes us he strengthens us he settles us down that we may be still in this life Hallelujah so we're not tossed to and fro amen the devil seeks who he he's tossed to and fro he's seeking who he may devour but God is doing the opposite to his people he's building a character in them amen we see the wave Sheep amen we see Jesus Christ as our wave sheet we see that same wave sheet came into the prophet of the Living God we've seen the character being built even Jesus himself had to learn obedience amen by the things that he suffered he had to learn it he was God in flesh but he had to learn it and even more so us he didn't bypass this theophany we bypassed it into a sinful nature we were darkened aliated as separated from God the seed was not awakened alive so the only thing that we lived the only thing that we knew and we understand and that developed most of our Lives was our sinful nature that's that is that is you know my brothers and sisters that is the power when I look at that I don't look at my weaknesses I don't look at the generational things that were passed down I don't look at the things that are impossible in my life amen we see those things amen we all do when we look in the mirror we see those things but I look to the word of God I look to the power of God I look to the spoken word because that's the only thing in this hour that's going to cause us to overcome Brother Brad says justification ain't good enough sanctification ain't good enough in this hour baptism of the Holy Ghost is not good enough it's the Holy Ghost himself amen because it's got to produce a Rapture and there's only one person he is the resurrection in life he's the only one that can produce a Rapture in US so he's got to have the full preemness in US oh my we are not just a religion we are not just a Community Church amen we're gathered under the spiritual tent of the supernatural God transforming human beings Hallelujah you talk about alienated from this world you talk about aliens they are aliens to us and we are aliens to them they glorify the flesh they worship the flesh they're they're exalt In the Flesh they're feeding the flesh making us stronger and stronger and here we are dying out to the flesh amen died out to the flesh oh my glory to God Luke 10 18. and he said unto them I beheld Satan as Leighton fallen from heaven behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and on scorpions and of all over all the power of the enemy and nothing by Shall any means hurt you now listen to that Hallelujah we see Satan has fallen we see that Satan is defeated if we get an understanding in a revelation in our hearts God will reveal that to us that Satan is a defeated foe he can never never overcome or conquer a son and daughter of God He Has Fallen not only that we have been given Power To Tread on him to tread on serpents on scorpions and all the power of the enemy that will come into your life all I need listen I need to speak my own world I need to create my own atmosphere and go live on it amen I gotta work out my own salvation so what is in my life Hallelujah that is the scripture for what's in my life the Scorpions amen the snakes all the demon power that came along and try to follow me through my life I have been given power over them and it's up to me as an individual and up to you as an individual to overcome those powers in your life and there's only one way to do it is by the word Satan cannot fight against this word Hallelujah listen Saints we don't desire to be perfect in the flesh when we try to control the circumstances in our life and the people around us amen that's where we get into trouble God doesn't want us to be perfect in the flesh but he wants us to become Godly amen with his values his attitudes his characteristics God's goal in our life on this Earth it's not the con is to conform his character development in US he wants us to grow up spiritually and become like Christ becoming like Christ doesn't mean losing your personality or becoming a Mindless clone laughs some you know what you say well you know some people when they get religious when they get under law in this hour and they get legalistic they lose their personality they lose they lose their mind listen it's okay to lose your mind if you get Christ's mind you got to make sure you get Christ's mind but if you lose your mind and you just lost your mind and you're gone crazy religiously crazy that's not good in this hour God doesn't want us to lose our personalities I don't want to lose my voice Hallelujah was doing good there but amen but he wants to change our character not our personality because it's in the character right is where the flaws are it's in the character that controls the whole person so by changing that character that character then amen shines through that personality and that's what God is doing in this hour Hallelujah every time you forget that character is one of God's purposes for your life you will never become frustrated by your circumstances you wonder why is this happening to me why is why am I having such a difficult time one answer is that life is supposed to be difficult is what enables us to grow remember Earth is not heaven so when we think you know and we get frustrated by the circumstances in our lives and by the situations we're we're losing sight that God is working on our character amen God is developing our character he's doing a work within us as the Bible says Rejoice through your trials and your troubles and your situations amen all things are working for our good to a Believer they're walking in that kind of Faith they're walking in that kind of understanding they know whatever happens to them has to be permitted by God to develop inside of them a character to rule and to reign in this hour no more questioning why is this happening to me why did I go through that we did that at the beginning when we're babies when we didn't have the understanding but this is the hour that are understanding amen is higher than that many Christians misinterpret Jesus promises of the Abundant Life and John 10 10. to mean perfect health a comfortable lifestyle constant happiness full realization of your dreams didn't relief from your problems through prayer and faith oh my how many times we pray that I know I have in the past as soon as we pray and there's a problem there's a situation as soon as we pray we want instant relief and we even speak it sometimes let it happen now let it be done now and it might happen I'm not saying it's not going to happen I'm not interpreting nothing I'm just telling you God is The Interpreter right let us I'm trying to show you a character here as we go along here little by little makes God give us something here tonight show us a little bit in the character that he wants to be developing us maybe you start seeing that developing in you he's already doing that within you Hallelujah amen in a word they expect Christian life is to be easy they expect heaven on Earth here we say in right here we just said remember Earth is not heaven but Christians expect heaven to be on earth think about it eh Hallelujah oh my God what what God puts up with us as he's grown along that's why there's nobody like him no one like my Lord Jesus oh God by the grace of God hallelujah I'm just so privileged and I just thinking about that today how honored and privileged I am just to stand up here to be in this position it's just a just just it's just a miracle I thank the Lord that's all I got is just just Thanksgiving for the Lord eh you know just think we just preach one message just one anointed message from God just like that Lily in the valley comes up and lets up perfume out once and a bypasser comes by and smells it and it fulfills God's purpose just to be elected Amen to do something not only do something but hear the truth of the hour hear the word of God it's always been like that down Through the Ages my brothers and sisters when Jesus came he was nothing he was a carpenter's son he was brought up in Nazareth all kinds of names connected to him isn't he isn't he's so-and-so's brother or cousin or whatever look at the way they thought of him but he was God in flesh the prophet came Amen in this hour never been a prophet like this Prophet to the whole world all the churches amen and look at the way they treated him it's always the same way a prophet is not welcome in his homeland Hallelujah and they look at us amen it's not it's not it's you know what it's not what I think or what you think of yourself is what God says about you it's the anointing around your life that he's placed around your life and what he's doing in your life what he's confirming Hallelujah if it was up to me my brothers and sisters no way I would have been gone a long time ago but it's him it's always been him and now I recognizing that and when you recognize that in your character you just let go and let God have his way I don't understand tomorrow I don't understand how I'm going to do this or how I'm going to do that I don't need to I don't need to that's what was Moses's problem amen every time he came up against a challenge he had to go back crying to the Lord Lord I did this but Pharaoh did this I did this but Pharaoh did this in his musicians until it came to the time amen where God says now do you believe now do you believe it doesn't matter what Satan puts in front of you how he challenges you how he tested you you got to know that God Is Bigger and greater I know you're going to come out of it oh my Hallelujah now character for the third poll the church age here power with with character is fifth to rule suffering is part of this character building is part of controlling the power by faith in us Jesus learned obedience for the things he suffered moreover God builds character in the circumstances of our life he does he does this as we experience situations in which we are tempted to do the exact opposite of what character looks like character development always involves choice when we make the right choice our character grows and we become more like Christ in the suffering there are choices in the trial in the temptation in the bondage there's choices that we have to make Hallelujah God for God knows the plans that he has for you plans to prosper you not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future Jeremiah 29. 11. now remember before if you go back and read that a lot of people use that that scripture for just prosperity and you know God you know lifted people up but remember what God under the context that God is saying this scripture is because if you read before that Israel was rebelling against God's Commandments his voice and God allowed them to go into slavery into bondage that wasn't God's plan that wasn't God's purpose right for is perfect will for them but because of their Disobedience and their Rebellion God is saying here I know all the plans that I have for you I want to bless you and prosper you spiritually even in your trials and your troubles I want to bless you there's a blessing there a spiritual awakening a spiritual growth in it but it's our rebellion and our Disobedience sometimes that puts us in the devil or the flesh bondage and slavery but God comes back and says I know what plans I have for you those are not my plans for you those are the plans that you're creating for yourself by your choices and your decisions not to obey me and follow me Hallelujah amen yes you know my brothers and sisters preachers taken this this uh message taking quotes and taking Revelations from The Prophet's message putting a looking like a very nice spiritual message together tickle the ears of those in the message that are looking to be entertained by a religious spirit Hallelujah like Timothy said in the Bible he says denying the very power to live this life they didn't they they oh they they're here but they deny the power my brothers and sister it's not about putting this and putting that and making it look so pretty and so well put together amen Paul says I Don't Preach though not I preach the gospel not only in word but I preach it in spirit and in demonstration and in power of the Holy Ghost because that's the only thing that's going to set us free we don't want to be a polished up church we want to be the Bride of Jesus Christ we want to be a living Epistles run of old man we want to be Overcomers we want that same life that was in Christ that same power that overcame in Christ and overcame in the profit in Us in this hour Hallelujah amen it is the same with God's word unless we tap into the power in the power in the proper way of this tremendous power we do us no good or produce nothing in our lives this is the connection between knowledge and Power if we know the word then we experience this power when we experience this power we we experience God's power tapping into God's word therefore requires things that every things that we can do when we read the word of God you see unless you had the written word you cannot get to the unwritten word to tap into God's power what did Brother Bradham say he said simple read your Bible and pray every day we need to tap into the word of God the Bible also says for a lack of knowledge of what the word my people perish so we need to be in the word not just come on Wednesday night or come on Sunday morning and get a little fill get a little trickle in us but we need to feed on this word every day where you have to overcome this age the busyness of this age the circumstances around your life that this age produces that is where you personally need to overcome and get into this word maybe stop making yourself so busy so occupied get down in prayer and fasten and seeing how what the Lord will reveal to you and make known to you how you can separate your life more for the work of God each one of us is called to a different level read the word the base connection that begins the power flows is made by reading the word once you feel God's power through the word surgeon through your life by reading it and by it being revealed to you then it will come naturally every day once you start breaking into that word and that word starts speaking to you listen once I get a taste of a good dessert you better keep that thing away from me especially if it's chocolate I'm not going to go and I'm going to go and I'm going to seek out I'm going to find it Hallelujah my body ain't gonna like it but I'm gonna want it sometimes I hear somebody's making a certain thing I don't care how I feel I'm going that is with the word of God once that word starts becoming real and life to you and starts speaking to you amen but it takes a Desperate Heart sometimes it takes desperation and perseverance sometimes it takes you to press through sometimes your flesh the unbelief that's in your life the doubts that go through your mind oh my what a battle we're going through Hallelujah but we got a mighty God we got a mighty word amen Hallelujah responds to the word in obedience there's danger in thinking that if we read the Bible we have done God's will we read the Bible in order to know God's will but the next step is obedience however is what transforms knowledge into power and power is what creates change in us a powerful living is produced by a powerful obeying they all go hand in hand together we can't leave anything out in our walk in our experience with this word so obedience read the word obey the word the power comes from the word that's the thing that creates change Hallelujah an Awakening seed learns obedience Jesus learned obedience by the things he suffered his experience and and testing and trying he went through brother Brandon went through many experiences where he had to learn obedience to listen to God first not his family not the preachers he was tested by losing his father his brother his wife his daughter when brother Brandon went to Africa God told him to stay and preach in a certain place but he didn't he listened to the preachers he got sick and he almost died yes yes you hear what I'm saying yes and he almost died until God delivered him and he said every time he goes God makes it hard on him because of that time he didn't listen to God it's just God keeping his son under obedience amen reminding him every single time Amen to obey listen to me when I'm when I'm speaking to you obey my voice because I know what's best for you doesn't God know what's best for us he knows our life he knows our tomorrow he knows everything the trust and and leave everything in his hands and let him control everything in our lives Hallelujah amen to be sold out vessels Hallelujah surrender to the headship of the word is a vessel under subjection then all things are possible to them that are sold out Hebrews chapter 12 God says chastening you we are not fit to rule until we've been tested the third pull the revealing of the word knocks out all the wrong understanding that came from our past life or our education our denominational thinking our knowledge or religion just like he did with Moses he took in 40 years to knock out all of Egypt out of him and it takes time to be holy it takes God time to deal with us not because of him but because of us because God knows what we can handle and he doesn't give us anything more than what we can handle amen glory to God God this was not like Pastor Simon always says it's not a it's we're not going to break it's a Bend it's a turning of a corner in our lives what we're going through the changes that take place Hallelujah the trusting God and everything that comes your way that come to a place of faith and realize and recognize and be alert be sober that everything that happens around your life is coming into your life for a purpose and reason you talk about being positive you talk about being certain and confident nothing brings that like this like the word of God does in our lives when God tells us who we are and what we're raised up for and that nothing can harm us no power in hell can come against us that Gates of Hell will not Prevail against us but we need to walk a certain way we need to walk in the path that he's given each and every one of us we need to go in that path my brothers and sisters we can't go to the left or the right that's why the prophet seeing the vision of the Bride getting out of line and he screamed get back in line that's us that's me that's you in our walks in our lives sometimes the spirit of God speaks to us get back in line get back focus on this word on the life your purpose of your calling and your position Hallelujah amen the bride gets to see the prophets failures and mistakes and how was how he learned and grown Moses his mistakes his temper as we look in the Bible we look at the children of Israel brothers sisters we are standing here today and we get to look back and see all that amen we have everything in this hour we are the last ones the Baton is handed to us I believe with all my heart am I am I saying God told me the time no but I believe by what I see by faith what I see the prophecies being fulfilled I what I see what God is doing in my life and what he's doing in The Bride of Jesus Christ's life and how the word of God has come into a place my brothers and sisters I see in the spirit that God is trying to take his church his bride to another level of faith another level of Deliverance another level of where we're coming another level of surrender Our Lives to him I see it in the spirit being released to the people you just open up your heart and believe God that's how he comes in amen and he does the work he does the change and he does the creating but Mary said beat unto me according to Thy word that I'm here in this hour the word that you're hearing beat unto me according to Thy Word when God is speaking and want to make himself more real to you want to deliver you he's he's speaking out of his word trying to bring Faith to you you have to believe it you have to say Let It Be unto me in my situation I believe it Lord and I'm walking by faith walk by faith not by sight get rid of sight and walk by faith and then when you walk by faith amen you're walking with him Hallelujah oh my God Amen we learn and we see the prophet the battles even the prophet said my brothers and sisters obey surrender let go and let God that you may have less Battle Scars you talk about Battle Scars sometimes we battle scar ourselves you know that's a great movement out there the spirit of the devil battle scarring people in their flesh cutting themselves and all that stuff my brothers and sisters let's not give ourselves any more battle scars than what we should by not listening to the voice of God the prophet said right here we need to be aware alert and conscious of how God is maturing us through suffering through testing through trials through molding through shaping you say brother Tim yes that's good I know that but when you're going through it are you conscious of it do you recognize it because there's a different attitude there's a different response the way you speak the way you act or sometimes the way you don't speak sometimes going through these testing and trying times you need to be still and know that he is God inside of you working inside of you and don't say a word because at the moment you might not understand and that's where the devil plays on your mind and and go by your feelings and let your feelings and your emotions and your memory and all these things start getting to you and then you start speaking you see he can't impersonate this word because he knows nothing about it he don't understand it he only understands where you are at when you speak don't show him anything don't tell him anything do you understand what I'm saying when you're going through the testing in the trials be still that I have only seen one thing and that is your faith your belief and your trust in God my God is more than able to take me through this Red Sea my God is more than able to depart it open this sickness my God is more than able to heal it oh my I don't know I got this uh when I was putting this together I got these two uh things mixed up here but I don't know why I put them together like that and I just hopping on the computer I guess I got here hold in anger is drinking poison expecting the other person to die okay hold in Anger within us resentment is drinking poison and expecting the other person to die we don't want to drink Satan's poison we don't want to drink his lies his deception that's all he's a father of Lies everything he speaks to you is a lie if we understand that we don't listen to Liars you know if you knew somebody in the flesh that are compulsive liars you wouldn't believe a word they say but here's Satan he can't impersonate it he knows nothing about it he don't understand it but when he speaks to us he speaks lies and we believe him first Peter 5 10 after you suffered Exodus 23 19. I will not drive them out in one day but little by little this is how I deliver the Deliverance comes why speak to the storm when you can't keep your mind and your spirit in order think about it my brothers and sisters let's put things in order here God has an order amen and and building character we try to speak we pray speak to the story speak to this speak that we try to take the beam out of our own brother our own sister's eyes when we got one in our own eye and we can't bring our flesh under subjection to the word we can't keep our mouths shut sometimes from speaking unbelief and doubt and lies and we try to speak all this other stuff we have to get rid of that stuff God knows what he's saying when it comes to reality your mind opens it up brother I'm saying here your mind either accepts it or rejects it that's it friends God let none of them miss it you see it's your mind that opens up the door or closes the door and listens to your conscience or listens to your memory or listens to your affection but when your mind closes itself to these things and let God's spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of this stuff out every Delta is gone every fear is gone every sensation of Doubt is gone every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the word of God and Satan cannot battle against that no sir that's what it's all about my brothers and sisters amen glory to God Hallelujah for participators tonight preach to me preach to me too I'm preaching to you I'm we're I'm I'm just I'm here too you know three like brother Simon always says you know I'm pointing one finger at you pointing a word at you tonight three are pointing back at me amen I'm saying oh God give me strength help me Hallelujah preach the word amen it's blessing my soul because it's the truth whether it hurts me or takes the hide off of me it's the truth and I want to be like this word Hallelujah no sir Satan can't battle against that word amen when you filter everything out in your life everything that comes your way a person a a an individual that that comes to that place with God totally surrendered like the high calling amen it pleases you oh my for God to chasten you try you test you whatever he wants to do in your life it pleases you oh yeah yeah you can say oh yeah please I don't know if I would be too pleased with some things right now maybe years ago some things you know now I'd be pleased I see God Amen but get into that place that's where we're going my brothers and sisters we're going somewheres we're on a journey we're going somewheres we come to church not to warm up the Pew or to be religious we are going somewhere something is happening tonight within us by the spirit of God something is developing in US revealing to us tonight by the spirit of God Sunday Morning by the spirit of God we're on a journey we're overcoming we're all Overcomers to him not overcometh I will grant to you to set with me on my throne that's where we're going tonight to sit with him on his throne Hallelujah Glory thank you Lord the Bible says it takes time for the bride to come into that perfect Faith perfect character to Manifest this third pull it's going to take a lot of time to deal with the Flesh and weaknesses and her own thinking and her own interpretation so that God can trust her with the spoken word because without it she would be prideful selfish arrogant ignorant of that spoken word hello I can I look at these scriptures and say oh God 32 years I've been walking and I can see that God has taken me through a lot of this stuff and I I see myself growing am I there no I'm I'm here tonight because I'm going there Hallelujah I'm going there it's developing in me but I see a process amen that's that's that's the that's the thing that brother Brown said when the bride recognizes who she is when she recognizes the process that's taken place in her that she can look back and say my I that was me I used to think that way that was my understanding but here I am God you took me onto a higher level God you're raising me up higher that's what's taking place overcoming casting out unbelief Casino Devil's Castle of unbelief God cast out unbelief from our lives Hallelujah glory to God amen for I reckon that the suffering of this present time is not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in US amen now we look at that that's going to be there hey man we're going to be known as he is knowing there but that scripture right there the suffering that we're going through is not going to compare to the Revelation he's going to bring out of our Lives the character the victory amen the spirit of God that's going to manifest out of our lives you see when you're born again you don't need more of the Holy Ghost don't listen to that when you're born again you've got the Holy Ghost the thing is the Holy Ghost wants more of you think about that think about that we got this illusion in our minds from denominational thinking amen from from from from from uh lack of uh uh Revelation back there that was brought up down through the church ages now God fill me for the Holy Ghost I need more of the Holy Ghost I thought that way no I got the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost Wants More of Me then you're going to see that you are filled with the Holy Ghost when the Holy Ghost gets more of you he has more to manifest through you oh God filled me more filled me more no you just got out of the way you just died out to yourself you just got victory in an area so the Holy Ghost can manifest himself more in your life Hallelujah because that's a that's a lie of the devil especially to the young people when they're born again how many times you see them why do you think there's altars why do you think there's altars and people come to the Altar for that one reason I guarantee you most of the time God fill me full of the Holy Ghost give me more than the Holy Ghost I did that once at a cap meeting when I first came in and I'm talking about supernatural experiences in my life and I I came to the altar I knelt down and outside I was praying God fill me full of Holy Ghost give me the Holy Ghost I felt the shoulder a top of my shoulder I said brother you got the Holy Ghost get back to your seat you don't need more of the Holy Ghost never understood it I said oh okay all right thank you Lord you heard my prayer but that's not what it was that was my understanding amen Hallelujah amen Hallelujah glory to God character is a victory it's not a gift like we talked about gifts there's gifts in the body but gifts are not it amen character is a victory just because you got a gift it don't mean you got character because there's a lot of gifts out there without any character and they're satanic and they're be used of the devil false teaching false lion Trinity devils but character is a victory characters when you overcome and you go through the testing and you go through the Garden of Gethsemane and just like the wine has to be pressed amen that's what Guardian Gethsemane means you get pressed and pressed and the goal gets beaten and beaten until it shines then the victory comes then the character comes oh my let's not lose sight of that this is more precious than gold my brothers and sisters when a church is not being tested and tried and under persecution a church is dying but when they're under that they're growing they're striving amen they're over Covenant in the spirit of God don't worry about what comes our way my brothers and sisters get on your knees and pray and speak that word and thank God for the victory amen thank God for the victory you're blessed in the church Lord you're bringing in such should be saved Lord glory to God you're adding to the church daily Lord glory to God Satan can't stop it Glory a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character satanic but Power with characters fit the rule and since he wants us to share in his throne on the same basis that he overcame sat down on his father's Throne then we have to overcome and sit down with him on his throne this little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to compare to the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in US Oh Glory Hallelujah amen thinking not strange concerning the fiery trials that come to try you that is what Peter said it's not strange that God wants us to develop a christ-like character that that comes through suffering Hallelujah Hebrews 12 6 8 for whom the Lord loveth he chasten he scourgeth every son to whom he receiveth but if you be without chastisement therefore all you are partakers then you are bastards not Sons so praise God Hallelujah Hallelujah amen Hallelujah Brother Brad I'm speaking here I'm going to try to wind this down in uh Christ is the mystery of God revealed by having the revelation of this secret made known unto them by his grace it means the church that he is trying to get into okay question and answers 1964. then he said that which is in part will be done away with when that which is perfect has come or when that which is perfect is made knowing okay the greatest anointing that was ever to anybody was was on Jesus Christ the anointing is not emotions the anointing is supreme power in control of known exactly what and how and that is what is here now we always say it the Rapture is here now perfect faith is here now that's what is here now exactly knowing the inner Veil it has always been that third pull three is perfection the ministry comes to its Perfection when it reproduces Christ again in the natural amongst human beings Souls that are in prison now the third pull is beginning to move you see it is within me now it's here now tapping into the power of the word the reveal word the third pull is here now Hallelujah character under the power of the third pull now will overcome it's not going to come my brothers and sisters it's here now everything you have need of is here now God has given it to us the seals are open that Mysteries are revealed you are revealed you are those you're part of those seals Hallelujah you know it's all about understanding it's all about recognizing it's all about an Awakening in this hour it's all about perfect Faith coming in this hour that's why you're hearing these messages the series of brother Danny is preaching on perfect faith my series Great Awakening the mystery all these things that are taking place is happening right now and it's what the bride is of need of you know just like the you know the brother Brian said when you get there you're going to look at that devil and you're gonna go that was the guy that caused all this problems that that guy caused all that problems what am I trying to say if you look at somebody naturally in the world and somebody you know this guy here doesn't bug me he doesn't threaten me he doesn't intimidate me he's nothing I'm so far above him you know how we think naturally right and out in the world we think that we don't even bother with certain people because of their attitude or whatever but we bother so much and we listen to the devil so much and why why because we don't know the word enough to know whose voice is speaking to you just like Martin Luther when he was lying there in bed and the devil came right to in his bed with the crown on his head and all that stuff says Martin Luther worshiped me worship me I'm the Lord Jesus worship me he looked he knew the word he knew that the Saints at the end would Crown the Lord Jesus Christ he looked he says Get Behind Me Satan he turned over and went to bed and another guy was preaching a a great Revival series under a 10 meeting back in the day I forget his name right now but the power of God was moving healing miracles signs and wonders night after night he was preaching day after day just went back into the room and he went to take a little nap and he felt the darkness come over the room he felt a dark presence come into the room and he turned over and he looked and he seen a back a black smoke starting to shape into a person like that and he looked over he goes oh it's you get out of here he went back to bed that's how much attention he paid to him that's somebody who recognizes God and experienced God Amen that knows God and the power of his resurrection Paul said I want to know him and the power is right you know God in the power of his resurrection then you'll know that the devil's no match for you Hallelujah let's try to wind this down here one of the last things that the bride will face to bring forth this third pull manifestation is rejection that is coming through the bride not in the denominations in the message right amongst you rejection the word when it's always made flesh and always comes into his manifestation when Jesus was the appointed time many times he said it's not my time but when it was his time to come into manifestation and fulfill his ministry Hallelujah where he came he said I my father are one of the same where he went and the temple said uh today this scripture is fulfilled that he was rejected oh my my brothers and sisters this bride is going to face rejection when Jesus proclaimed that he was one with the father making himself God he was rejected despised and forsaken this bride will have the character and the understanding of who she is to face that rejection in this hour God has given us everything in this hour oh my the bride carries a heart of an overcomer those who sail into deep Waters develop something very key to maintain an overcoming heart the scriptures speak that in the last days those who will remain and gain great blessings will be those who carry an overcoming heart we are Overcomers we are constantly overcoming we never stop overcoming every day you wake up and you put your feet on the ground you're an overcomer oh Hallelujah glory to God you take your first step you know faith is taken go walking outside your door going into your car going to do the things that you know you have to do it takes Faith to do that and when God speaks to you during the day in the midst of all your your your your natural life God has the preeminence and he comes and he moves you this way and he comes and he moves you that way how many times does this happen I know there's lots of you have testimonies amen I'm walking down and the next thing you know I stop and I'm ordering something at at the food place and I stop I look over and the Holy Spirit there's a guy over there in a corner like this and the Holy Spirit says go over to him you'll walk over to him and then you start speaking you start seeing the hand of God moving and things happen I'm not going to tell you what happened but things happen that's how God moves and manifestes himself in our midst Hallelujah an overcomer walks with a plan a and no plan B Attitude they have fully given themselves to God in his ways they have a mindset that says everything in me that is not of God needs to go well many make peace and justify their strongholds their flesh their weaknesses an overcomer never contends or makes a peace with the Enemy I preached the whole message on that one time making a treaty with the Devil you don't bug me I don't bug you let me tell you he's a liar don't forget that don't make no treaty with him he tells you to put down your sword and he won't bug you he's coming back on the other side to hit you never let down your sword never compromise with the word of God never compromise with this world this flesh that's why the Bible says the enemies of your own household Jesus said I'll separate you from your mother your father your mother-in-law your brother-in-law the Bible doesn't say that that's still the word of God watch out the spirit of compromise comes through that Avenue sometimes be alert be diligent your adversary to devils like a roaring lion seeking to devour you they are single-minded deep water people learn to become single-minded When Storms Come they cannot entertain the what ifs or would have beens or could have beens or should have been kind of thoughts no more of those things it's God's word and that's it it's either Faith or dealt Hallelujah let me read this quote here I got a couple quotes and then I'm going to close Allelujah I want to get this thought down Hallelujah this process here they don't know what the overcoming means and I begin to think of this text then overcome and keep life in you when life went out that's what brought that log to that condition see and it made it worse than ever when it laid in the branch where the water was and then there you take a Christian that's supposed to be a Christian let the life of God go out from him and experience the joy of serving Christ and living in a church where such is going on he rottens twice as quick living under that if we are trying to follow this message of this hour he says what brother I'm speaking here we're trying to follow this message of this hour we should live constantly in the Life of Christ see because it don't lay don't you lay around and know that these things that you're supposed to do and you don't do them what is he saying here God is speaking to your life God has given you instructions he's dealing with you he's revealing things to you he tells you to move like he always does Through the Bible in a Direction that's what he's saying here and you don't do that he that knoweth to do good and do it not to him is sin unbelief then when you become Dodie and rotten when you separated from the life of God so strive with all that is in you to stay in the life of God that is in you to be fruitful and bear in Fruit we see this age that we're living in it's one of the grandest ages of all ages the laosian church age the grandest of all Church ages because it's the ending of time and the blending of Eternity and then it's the greatest sinful age that's ever been sinful the greatest unbelief we can see that there's never been a there's never been an age like this look at brother bradham's day it's a joke I I believe the prophet's seen he's seen he seen it seed for him he's seen it with those people back there that were following his ministry and not have no clue of what's going on out here the ones that are gone on the age that we're living the unbelief that we're fighting now but how greater is the word he says when the enemy comes in like a flood I will raise a standard he says I'll make my word more real to you there's never been an age where God is making his word more real to his people than now he's going to make it so real that nothing else matters to her and it's going to Quicken her the quickening spirit in her is going to Quicken her so much it's gonna Quicken her out of here oh my whoa Hallelujah you ever get caught up in the word of God oh my you get caught up in the word of God you start rejoicing in the word of God and I I get up I start walking around and I feel like I'm I'm walking on clouds I feel like the room is is I go what am I losing my mind or something what's going on here oh I'm walking in the spirit of God Amen I see that increase in more and more and more oh my I believe it's the Rapture in our lives amen invite the musicians up and Satan his power he's God is a perverted power it ain't no real power death is only a perversion of Life a lie is only the perversion of the truth Mist told see adultery is the righteous act misuse everything that Satan has that he's got is something that's been perverted Hallelujah greatest battle ever fought Hallelujah amen but if that channel has been cleared out and been purged and filled on the inside with the Holy Spirit don't even come into memory no matter what Miss Jones did or what she didn't do it's you and God together and nobody else is YouTube there you are Hallelujah there's the battle kill him dead at the beginning stop them dead in his tracks stop that lie stop that unbelief dead in his tracks when Satan comes to you oh my don't you do that at all you throw aside everything and open up that channel and say God your word is eternally true and it's for me it's for me you got to say that brother Brian you got to say God your word is for me amen it's for me Hallelujah when you do that it releases the power with inside of you a belief inside of you that castes out demons that this word is for us it's for you it's for me my brothers and sisters Hallelujah glory to God Hallelujah amen if the whole church fails if the whole world fails yet I cannot fail because I am taking your word there's the battle that's the thing glory to God you must overcome by the third poll the revealing of his word in your heart and believe that the character of Christ is being formed in you then you become in His image the image of him and his characteristics in this hour Oh Glory to God my brothers and sisters if you take a look at my notes it's nothing you think preaching his notes as you take a look at my notes you go what what the heck you didn't preach that I preached some of it but that's the way it is that's the way the spirit of God moves amen sometimes you come up here you don't know what's going to go on you got notes you got things but you don't know what and and and and and it's a place that's why they say preaching is an awful place to be in but man he never fails he's always faithful because he loves us he loves you it's not because of me or the preacher it's because of his love for me and you he wants to get this to you so bad he wants to awaken you so bad to this truth Amen in this hour let us stand Hallelujah Glory thank you Lord for your love Grace and your mercy Lord thank you for what you're doing in the Church of the Living God and the Bride of Jesus Christ thank you for what you're doing here Lord continue Lord to lead us by faith father Hallelujah we walk not by sight but by faith father you oh God leading his dear children along
