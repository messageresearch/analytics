[0:14] coming soon
[0:16] it's jesus
[0:18] in all of his glory
[0:21] thank god
[0:23] not just an imagination
[0:26] not just a worldly prince
[0:30] but
[0:30] here comes jesus
[0:32] coming soon
[0:34] coming in all of his glory
[0:37] the effulgence of his glory
[0:40] and we are here to welcome him back our
[0:44] lord's return to earth again
[0:47] thanks be to god
[0:49] that we are
[0:51] alive in this glorious marvelous time
[0:56] the golden age
[0:59] of the elected seed
[1:01] of the living god
[1:03] that with our own hearts and eyes we
[1:07] shall behold him
[1:09] as he makes known himself to us
[1:13] once again my friends
[1:16] brothers and sisters in christ
[1:19] united us one in him
[1:23] i come to you in the name of the lord
[1:26] with the word of god
[1:29] again
[1:30] i enter into god's storehouse
[1:35] which was stopped
[1:37] full
[1:39] with the goodness of god
[1:42] by this prophet of malachi 4 5
[1:46] brother william marion branham
[1:50] you wonder why
[1:51] do you mention him so often
[1:55] it's because i recognize
[1:57] who and what a prophet is
[2:00] how that a genuine prophet especially
[2:04] this 20th century prophet
[2:09] at the last part of his ministry
[2:13] the lord jesus himself
[2:16] used this vessel to speak through it
[2:20] and to bring to us the fullness of his
[2:23] word to him be the glory the honor and
[2:26] the praise
[2:28] and tonight
[2:29] we will enter into the storehouse
[2:33] where there are wonderful fresh
[2:36] green vegetables and fruits
[2:40] of the life
[2:42] ministry
[2:43] and
[2:44] the holy spirit's
[2:46] own products original
[2:49] so god bless us
[2:51] as we go into revelation chapter three
[2:56] uh reading verses one and two
[3:00] and speaking on the topic
[3:03] bible teaching
[3:05] of the seven church ages
[3:07] on the
[3:08] denunciation
[3:10] or
[3:11] condemnation
[3:13] of the age
[3:14] of sardis
[3:16] let us pray
[3:18] gracious heavenly father
[3:21] for the reading of thy word
[3:24] we are thankful
[3:26] we are grateful
[3:29] may your great spirit so anoint us and
[3:33] anoint the word
[3:35] to thee be the glory the honor and the
[3:37] praise
[3:39] as we attempt to step aside lord
[3:42] and let you have the forefront from this
[3:46] word of god
[3:48] in the name of jesus christ amen and
[3:52] amen
[3:53] revelation chapter 3
[3:56] shall be turned in our bibles
[3:58] and read verse 1
[4:02] and unto the angel of the church in
[4:06] sardis
[4:07] write
[4:09] these things said he
[4:12] that had the seven spirits of god
[4:16] and
[4:17] the seven stars
[4:20] i know thy works
[4:23] that thou hast the name
[4:26] that thou liveth and are dead
[4:30] be watchful
[4:32] and strengthen the things which remain
[4:37] that are ready to die
[4:40] for i have not found thy works
[4:44] perfect
[4:45] before god
[4:47] amen
[4:50] hallelujah
[4:52] in every other age that we have studied
[4:56] we found that god always praised the
[4:59] believers
[5:00] in that particular age
[5:04] and then
[5:05] he would denounce
[5:07] the false vine or the
[5:10] false church
[5:11] that had intertwined itself
[5:14] within
[5:16] the that age
[5:19] but in this period
[5:22] because
[5:23] of the disregard for the lord himself
[5:29] disregard this respect
[5:32] for the very word of god itself
[5:37] his entire
[5:40] words to this age
[5:43] rings
[5:45] with condemnation
[5:47] for the actions
[5:49] of and deeds of the people of this age
[5:53] true and false
[5:56] listen to the voice of god
[5:58] he says i know thy works
[6:02] oh praise god that's not just like when
[6:05] a man says with partial knowledge i know
[6:09] this or i know that this is the
[6:13] all-knowing
[6:14] all-seeing god saying
[6:16] i
[6:17] know your works in entirety
[6:21] i know thy works beginning to end
[6:25] from the very motivation to the very
[6:28] fullness of action god says i know thy
[6:33] works
[6:36] hallelujah
[6:37] my friends
[6:39] works
[6:40] in their rightful place
[6:42] are good
[6:43] for faith
[6:45] without works
[6:47] is dead
[6:49] you can have all the revelation you want
[6:52] but actions must follow
[6:55] that the revelation may be made
[6:57] manifest
[7:00] but
[7:01] something about these works
[7:04] that
[7:05] incurred god's
[7:07] dysplasia
[7:10] you see
[7:12] as i've said some works are good
[7:15] but somewhere in there
[7:18] in their works the works of the people
[7:21] of sardis
[7:23] there was some spiritual deficiency
[7:28] there was some kind of uh
[7:31] wrong
[7:33] motivations
[7:35] and intentions
[7:37] that was discerned by the spirit of god
[7:41] that caused these works to come up
[7:44] before god
[7:46] into god's attention
[7:49] now
[7:50] what were these works
[7:52] that we are speaking about first of all
[7:56] the people of sardis
[7:59] had superseded the leadership of the
[8:02] holy spirit
[8:04] by establishing
[8:06] a church hierarchy
[8:09] a church hierarchy of church leadership
[8:14] by man
[8:16] instead of accepting the leadership of
[8:18] the holy ghost
[8:21] similar to when
[8:23] god provided israel with
[8:26] with his leadership
[8:28] and they said well uh we still need a
[8:31] king
[8:33] they wanted a man that they could see
[8:37] hear touch feel
[8:40] before they could believe and follow god
[8:45] and here again that same spirit
[8:48] raises up its head
[8:50] not in israel
[8:53] but in the church of god
[8:55] and rejecting
[8:58] the leadership of god himself
[9:03] which was satan's intention from way
[9:06] back before the foundation of the world
[9:09] when he wanted to reject god's
[9:12] leadership
[9:13] and bring everything under
[9:16] his tales
[9:18] now notice carefully
[9:22] they
[9:23] also their works were tainted
[9:27] because
[9:29] you see
[9:30] they were presenting the word of god
[9:34] but they presented it tainted
[9:38] mixed in
[9:40] or intermingled
[9:42] with creeds
[9:44] with dogmas
[9:46] with church orders
[9:48] and various things
[9:50] whose origins
[9:52] were man-made and were not of god
[9:57] their worship
[10:00] was also tainted
[10:03] for they
[10:04] did not worship in the spirit
[10:07] as god wanted his church from the
[10:10] beginning to worship
[10:13] in the spirit
[10:15] and having an invisible
[10:17] union and communion by the presence of
[10:21] the holy spirit revealing the same thing
[10:26] to all the believers so that there
[10:29] could be
[10:30] an inner
[10:32] oneness
[10:34] achieved by the works of the holy spirit
[10:38] in them
[10:40] instead
[10:42] they cast aside
[10:44] the worship of god up through the holy
[10:47] spirit
[10:49] an accepted
[10:51] a system
[10:52] of liturgies
[10:54] they accepted
[10:56] a system
[10:58] of man made uh sets of how to worship
[11:03] how to do this certain creed how to do
[11:06] this certain worship at a certain time a
[11:09] certain season all laid out for them in
[11:12] the form of a system because in their
[11:16] minds that is orderly that is organized
[11:19] that is predictable we know what's
[11:22] coming next but this holy spirit
[11:25] it moves like a wind it changes it it
[11:29] does things in such way which we can't
[11:32] predict you see satan hates revelation
[11:35] but sons and daughters of god
[11:38] are led by the spirit of god
[11:41] and the spirit and the wind blows where
[11:44] it lists
[11:45] and no man no devil none knows where it
[11:49] comes and how it goes
[11:52] but we who believe
[11:54] we only know to or surrender submit and
[11:59] to follow to the direct will promise
[12:03] of god
[12:05] their works were tainted
[12:09] there were spotted feasts
[12:11] coming before god
[12:14] because instead of producing the full
[12:17] pure word
[12:19] they were presenting god with
[12:22] the worship of mary olitree
[12:26] and she
[12:27] began
[12:29] to take a greater place in their eyes
[12:33] than the very jesus christ who died for
[12:37] their sins and rose again
[12:40] they started to worship her
[12:43] lift her up
[12:45] instead of lifting up jesus
[12:48] so that he could draw all men
[12:51] unto himself
[12:54] and their worship of mary
[12:56] to the point
[12:58] where they started to subtly begin to
[13:01] insert her
[13:04] into the godhead itself
[13:08] and brought down
[13:10] the son jesus christ
[13:13] to a lower
[13:15] place
[13:16] and position
[13:18] rather than him being exalted
[13:21] as the mighty everlasting god in christ
[13:26] they
[13:27] spiritually demoted him
[13:31] and saying that his mother is greater
[13:35] mary
[13:36] greater
[13:38] than jesus christ
[13:41] they demoted him
[13:43] so far down
[13:46] until they brought him to
[13:50] it the subservience
[13:52] under the title of a man called the pope
[13:57] you see
[14:00] they put a man over the head of the
[14:02] eternal god
[14:05] and brought him in subservience you say
[14:08] what are you talking about brother simon
[14:11] let me let me give you some
[14:13] understanding of this
[14:16] in the old days
[14:18] when there was a king
[14:21] and that king got very old and
[14:24] he was ready to die
[14:28] then
[14:29] what would happen
[14:31] is that when he died
[14:33] or after he died
[14:36] the people will say well
[14:39] we know that the sun is the ear
[14:42] we know he is the new king
[14:45] but he is young
[14:47] he doesn't have political experience he
[14:51] doesn't have the maturity
[14:54] to be able to lead the kingdom so we
[14:58] will appoint
[15:01] a royal regent
[15:04] to be able to
[15:07] uh guide the king
[15:09] train the king
[15:11] until he comes to maturity
[15:14] then he will be able to take over his
[15:18] kingdom
[15:20] well
[15:21] under religious
[15:23] ranks and religious terminology
[15:26] we have the term
[15:28] where the popes call themselves
[15:31] vikers
[15:32] of christ
[15:34] vikers of christ
[15:37] so in other words they brought the
[15:39] christ the word
[15:41] the the
[15:43] god in flesh
[15:44] is brought into subservience
[15:48] a law order
[15:50] then the
[15:51] regents
[15:53] that men have declared upon this earth
[15:57] until the word comes to its fullness
[16:01] he will reign
[16:03] supreme
[16:05] he will advise the word think of it
[16:09] a man born in sin shapen and iniquity
[16:13] come to the world speaking lies
[16:16] and will present himself
[16:20] as a viker of christ
[16:22] a regent
[16:24] to rule over the word to advise the word
[16:29] to walk beside it
[16:32] and to take its authority and to use it
[16:36] as if it his own
[16:38] is it his own
[16:40] and to say i am here
[16:44] representing the word and i'm in place
[16:46] of christ
[16:48] i am here
[16:50] as the one
[16:52] to be in place of christ
[16:54] you see this is really spiritually what
[16:58] folks ought to understand and recognize
[17:02] that is really happening
[17:05] now we know those who fought in the
[17:07] early church
[17:10] many of them
[17:12] their lives
[17:14] were lost destroyed
[17:17] given up unto death
[17:19] and those who would not
[17:22] became pawns in the hands
[17:26] of the so-called church
[17:28] of that day
[17:30] even peasants
[17:32] kings
[17:34] scepters and crowns tumbled down
[17:37] at the feet
[17:39] of that
[17:40] jezebel religion
[17:43] see
[17:44] and
[17:44] soon the lives of the saints of god were
[17:48] not even their own anymore
[17:52] neither were their lives christ
[17:54] belonging to jesus christ anymore
[17:58] because now they were captured
[18:02] and belong
[18:03] body and soul
[18:06] to the spirit
[18:09] and leadership
[18:11] and vikrant
[18:14] or vicarage of the
[18:16] church of rome
[18:19] church of rome which taught
[18:22] and still talks
[18:24] about the blood of christ
[18:27] and yet encouraging
[18:29] or encourages
[18:31] the purchasing of salvation
[18:34] with money
[18:36] they're brought there
[18:38] paid and bought
[18:40] for the forgiveness
[18:42] of their sins
[18:44] either by paying true gold
[18:47] or the gore
[18:49] of penance
[18:52] the wealthy ones
[18:54] in the church then and now
[18:59] they
[19:00] find themselves
[19:04] that they could
[19:06] buy
[19:07] or pay for indulgences
[19:12] because
[19:13] pope leo the tenth
[19:16] allowed them to buy these indulgences
[19:20] for their sins
[19:22] that were not yet even committed
[19:26] in other words you could pay ahead
[19:28] for sins that you may even commit in the
[19:31] future
[19:33] and the pope will then
[19:36] supposedly forgive those sins now
[19:40] therefore
[19:42] those wealthy ones
[19:45] could plan their crimes ahead of time
[19:50] with no compulsion
[19:52] no feeling no conscience
[19:56] they didn't have to think about it
[19:58] because they believed their sins were
[20:02] already forgiven
[20:04] and paid for
[20:06] so they planned their awful crimes
[20:10] and proceeded
[20:12] to carry them out
[20:15] knowing that
[20:16] their
[20:17] their sins
[20:18] were already forgiven and permitted
[20:22] remitted
[20:23] by
[20:24] the pope
[20:27] of course the word of god was kept from
[20:30] the people
[20:32] so they could not know the truth
[20:34] what god has in store
[20:36] it was as it were that there were
[20:40] spiritually shut up
[20:43] in a dungeon of the church of rome
[20:47] yes my friends there they were
[20:51] they were shut up there
[20:53] as a man
[20:55] awaiting death
[20:57] already as a debt sentence of
[21:00] denomination upon him
[21:02] and he is waiting
[21:04] in these prisons with stained glass
[21:07] windows
[21:08] awaiting
[21:10] the sentence of death
[21:13] to be carried out
[21:14] upon him of course after natural death
[21:18] comes the judgment
[21:20] amen
[21:21] this great
[21:23] drunk with the blood of the saints
[21:26] of the ages
[21:28] before that time until that time and
[21:31] will do so again in the future right now
[21:36] she is on a pause where she she puts on
[21:40] her beauty
[21:42] that that throws you off your guard and
[21:46] lets you think that she's harmless but
[21:49] my friends that spirit will revive
[21:52] itself again
[21:54] with inquisition
[21:55] and a gore and rivers of blood that will
[21:59] be shed by this harlot of the book of
[22:03] revelation with no thought
[22:07] for she has no thought
[22:10] of any judgment or any
[22:12] such a thing upon her lake of fire and
[22:16] all of that
[22:17] she that that doesn't cross her thoughts
[22:20] she just
[22:21] goes ahead savagely
[22:24] killing
[22:25] men women
[22:26] the saints of god both with spiritual
[22:30] and physical death
[22:33] now towards the end of the fourth age
[22:38] and you know
[22:40] on the beginning
[22:42] of the
[22:44] of the fifth age
[22:46] uh let me
[22:48] repeat myself or let me
[22:50] reiterate something here
[22:53] listen says the servant of god
[22:56] we we know
[22:58] that each church age
[23:01] overlapped into the next age
[23:05] you see the church ages overlap
[23:10] even when it is announced that they have
[23:13] ended
[23:15] that is
[23:17] the official announcement
[23:20] but the age still keeps traveling
[23:22] through time
[23:24] and the other one starts and also
[23:27] traveling through time so all the ages
[23:31] are traveling
[23:33] parallel to each other
[23:35] and going all out and they will all end
[23:39] when we come back to
[23:41] eternity again
[23:43] so the official announcement just made
[23:47] but the ages left over so the first the
[23:51] fourth church age officially ends
[23:54] but then it laps over with the fifth
[23:58] as they continue traveling out there
[24:02] together
[24:03] now in this fifth church age
[24:06] the invasion of constantinople
[24:10] took place
[24:12] and i must say
[24:14] we have to thank
[24:17] they the turks the turkish people
[24:22] and the learned scholars
[24:25] of the east
[24:27] with their
[24:28] greek manuscripts
[24:31] that were brought to the west
[24:35] and so
[24:37] the purity of the word of god
[24:41] again began to be
[24:43] disseminated
[24:44] amongst the people amongst the believers
[24:48] but not only were these
[24:51] brothers these men fine wonderful
[24:54] teachers of the world of and of great
[24:57] importance
[24:59] but
[25:00] also from there came the invention
[25:04] of what today we know as
[25:07] modern printing presses
[25:11] printing presses were invented
[25:14] back then
[25:16] they were discovered
[25:18] and
[25:19] this facilitated the mass production
[25:24] of books
[25:26] and so
[25:27] we find the great hunger and demand
[25:31] for for for the bible
[25:34] uh could never be answered for the
[25:36] people's hearts were so hungry for the
[25:38] word of god
[25:40] then
[25:41] god
[25:42] enriching mercy and grace
[25:46] raised up great man
[25:48] anointed with the holy spirit
[25:52] man such as martin luther
[25:56] who was one
[25:58] man such as john calvin
[26:02] there was zwingli
[26:06] and these were just some luminaries of
[26:08] that time but there were many many more
[26:12] whose names
[26:15] we don't know because they were not uh
[26:19] like mainline figures we don't recognize
[26:22] them or they're not too well known
[26:25] however the mighty work of god
[26:28] turned around
[26:30] and these mighty men that god used
[26:33] some of them
[26:36] they were
[26:37] turned around and hindered the very work
[26:40] that they started
[26:44] they did not oppose
[26:46] how did they hinder the work
[26:48] they did not oppose the marriage of
[26:52] church and state
[26:53] at the nicean council
[26:56] they actually fostered it
[26:59] they actually wanted it
[27:01] my friends
[27:03] they actually
[27:04] spoke about the defenders of the faith
[27:07] and the defense of the gospel just
[27:10] imagine
[27:12] man whose life is like the like the
[27:16] evening breeze
[27:18] and moves and goes off like the smoke in
[27:21] the evening
[27:23] turns around and says we are the
[27:26] defenders
[27:28] of the face
[27:30] of the um of an omnipotent eternal god
[27:34] that there were going to be the
[27:36] defenders of the faith and the stamped
[27:38] documents and made it official
[27:42] oh my lord god have mercy
[27:45] amen
[27:47] yes sir
[27:48] in spite of all of luther's teaching and
[27:52] preaching
[27:54] against outside interference into church
[27:57] matters
[27:58] he could not stop
[28:01] the
[28:02] thought the idea
[28:04] the the false teaching
[28:07] of archbishops
[28:09] bishops
[28:11] neophytes and whatever else
[28:14] in the midst of the church they were
[28:18] setting up the spirit of the devil was
[28:20] setting up a hierarchy within the church
[28:24] and luther tried his best to stop it but
[28:27] he could not stop it and it
[28:31] prevailed and this concept of church
[28:34] government
[28:36] took over
[28:37] and though there came out of the
[28:40] uh church at that time out of the harlot
[28:44] yet in mind
[28:46] they were still shackled to her
[28:49] by
[28:50] this church government i wan i'm i'm i'm
[28:53] still i'm i'm pointing now
[28:56] how'd that form of church government
[29:01] taken on
[29:02] various names
[29:04] whether we want to say superintendent
[29:07] instead of pope one whether one is a
[29:09] general superintendent instead of pope
[29:12] whether we want to say chief presbyter
[29:14] instead of pope whether we want to say
[29:17] chief apostle instead of pope whatever
[29:20] terminology we want to use
[29:23] that
[29:24] or that form of false
[29:28] man-made church government
[29:30] has traveled down
[29:32] through
[29:33] time
[29:34] to this very hour in which we're living
[29:39] has been accepted
[29:42] by the daughters of the harlot
[29:45] and my brothers it still is here
[29:49] prevailing today
[29:51] their thoughts of what a bishop should
[29:54] be
[29:56] a church bishop
[29:58] and a bible bishop
[30:00] is absolutely
[30:03] far apart
[30:04] and not to be understood by them
[30:08] in their minds
[30:10] the bishop a bishop
[30:12] of the church
[30:13] should be won
[30:15] in
[30:16] glorious rich
[30:19] regalia
[30:21] robes
[30:23] gold
[30:24] covered with rubies precious stones
[30:28] until
[30:29] they must be addressed
[30:31] as princes
[30:33] of the church
[30:35] forsaking the very truth of the word of
[30:38] god
[30:39] that they who want to be the greatest
[30:42] let them be the least
[30:44] let them be servants
[30:46] amen jesus rode on a donkey no now
[30:51] they're riding in the best
[30:54] that the world could provide
[30:57] they wear the best
[30:59] the world can give
[31:01] they eat the best they live the best
[31:04] my friends
[31:06] contrarian in opposition
[31:08] to the word of the living god
[31:12] oh praise god hallelujah
[31:15] we know that luther used poor judgment
[31:19] and incited a battle
[31:22] between the peasants and their lords
[31:25] which caused hundreds of thousands to
[31:27] die
[31:29] zwingli later his party
[31:32] persecuted
[31:34] into prison
[31:36] a godly brother
[31:38] dr hubey meyer
[31:40] oh my lord have mercy
[31:44] and then was later responsible
[31:48] for his death
[31:49] of burning by fire
[31:53] calvin
[31:55] also no less
[31:58] he demanded the arrest
[32:01] of our precious brother servatus
[32:05] who had seen
[32:06] by revelation and began to teach
[32:10] the doctrine of the oneness of god
[32:14] the state
[32:16] of course
[32:17] stirred up the state which is what the
[32:19] church usually does hide in the
[32:21] background stir up the government and
[32:24] the state
[32:25] and they arrested
[32:28] brother servatus
[32:31] and
[32:32] tried him
[32:35] and
[32:37] took calvin's dismay
[32:39] they burned him at the stake
[32:42] now this was not really calvin's
[32:46] intent
[32:47] for this brother to be killed and burned
[32:50] he just wanted to put the fear of god in
[32:53] him and to scare him a bit
[32:55] so calvin was actually sorry that he did
[32:59] that
[33:00] but nevertheless
[33:02] his
[33:03] caller calling out to the state
[33:06] caused the death of this brother
[33:09] now in their denominational zeal
[33:14] bringing about all these
[33:16] tragic results
[33:19] we find out
[33:21] a brother that lived in those times who
[33:24] was a a
[33:26] a historian of note
[33:29] coming yes
[33:31] he wrote
[33:33] one thing is needful of us
[33:36] for we have a great number of teachers
[33:39] and that is the reason for the multitude
[33:43] of sex
[33:44] that we have
[33:46] no names are even left
[33:51] each church reckons itself
[33:53] as the true one
[33:55] and of the and the purest one
[33:58] and the truest one
[34:01] while
[34:02] among themselves
[34:04] they persecute what each other with the
[34:08] bitterest of hatred
[34:10] oh my think of it
[34:13] brother sister he further said
[34:16] scarcely anything is said
[34:19] of the power of the keys of the church
[34:22] for the church has lost the power of
[34:25] binding
[34:26] and of losing
[34:29] the sacraments were given to us
[34:33] they claim
[34:34] oh my
[34:36] and now faith revelation has been split
[34:40] or fragmented into a thousand ver
[34:43] different parts
[34:46] amen
[34:47] what can help us
[34:49] the only thing that can help us is
[34:51] return back to the word
[34:53] back to christ
[34:55] back to the original faith the original
[34:59] position and condition that god wants us
[35:03] to be in
[35:05] amen hallelujah the return of jesus
[35:08] christ as the only
[35:11] true leader and that we should walk in
[35:14] the footsteps of our king
[35:17] no wonder at the beginning of this
[35:21] i said coming soon coming soon our jesus
[35:26] in all of his glory oh thank god amen
[35:31] coming back to earth again hallelujah
[35:35] amen i believe he's here i believe he's
[35:38] with us amen until they are of his
[35:42] physical are coming amongst that amen
[35:44] but now brother sister
[35:48] hallelujah
[35:49] we find out
[35:51] amen that we should not be satisfied
[35:54] with anything else
[35:56] but the revealed word of god
[36:00] which
[36:01] belongs to us all
[36:04] and i stress that
[36:06] because we are not here to franchise
[36:09] the word of god we are not here
[36:13] to hold
[36:15] any kind of a document
[36:19] that gives us
[36:20] a franchise on the word of god yes this
[36:25] one he his franchise is on
[36:29] hot dogs or hamburgers his franchise is
[36:32] his fried chicken his franchise is on
[36:35] roast beef
[36:37] now uh his franchise is on healing his
[36:40] his franchise is is on holiness his
[36:44] franchise is on this his franchise is on
[36:47] the sacraments his franchise is on
[36:50] and so on i'm trying to say none of us
[36:56] not true believer
[36:58] has a franchise on any part of the word
[37:02] for
[37:04] the word of god
[37:06] is given to us
[37:08] by revelation true grace alone not true
[37:13] learning wisdom knowledge
[37:15] or inheritance
[37:18] we don't inherit
[37:20] faith but it's by the grace of god
[37:24] hallelujah amen
[37:27] my friends
[37:29] i believe god is revealing himself in
[37:33] and through this book we call the bible
[37:37] amen and we will obediently submit
[37:41] and follow his commands
[37:45] there is only one life
[37:47] but death
[37:49] comes in a four in a thousand forms
[37:52] now we know that denominationalism
[37:55] is spiritual death
[37:59] there's only one christ hallelujah
[38:04] but thousands of antichrists
[38:08] there's only one life
[38:12] but thousands and thousands
[38:14] of denominations
[38:17] amen
[38:19] if we are wise
[38:21] as true believers
[38:23] we'll come back to the word of god
[38:26] and come and walk in the true light of
[38:29] life
[38:30] jesus christ
[38:31] our heavenly leader
[38:35] now
[38:36] as you can see
[38:38] this
[38:40] era
[38:41] of time
[38:42] gave growth
[38:44] to
[38:45] the spirit or of denominationalism
[38:50] because since the time of paul
[38:54] the
[38:55] spirit of denominationalism
[38:57] was in its
[38:59] infancy
[39:01] and just about starting to rear its head
[39:05] to grow itself through the ages
[39:09] into
[39:10] maturity to this time
[39:13] and finally will come into its power and
[39:18] glory
[39:19] under
[39:20] the one world church
[39:24] that is yet to come
[39:26] but has now already started to emerge
[39:33] in the book of corinthians
[39:37] when the saints of god
[39:40] already had dissension
[39:42] where paul had to say are you not
[39:44] colonel
[39:46] listen
[39:48] one says i am of paul
[39:51] another said i am of apollos
[39:54] another one says i am of saint peter
[39:58] they already had the spirit
[40:03] of genomic nationalism
[40:06] rearing up its head
[40:08] in the first church age
[40:11] it was in its infancy
[40:14] but it has been growing through the ages
[40:18] until this time
[40:21] when it is now my friends preparing for
[40:25] the
[40:26] end of it all
[40:28] to come to the fullness of a one world
[40:31] church
[40:32] an image
[40:34] to the beast
[40:37] now my friends
[40:39] at that time they started out by having
[40:42] one was of luther the lutherans
[40:46] one was of john huss the hussites
[40:50] one was of zinc zwingli
[40:53] the zwingli party
[40:55] and so on
[40:57] that was the fragmentation of the body
[41:02] of the lord jesus christ
[41:05] and they were living under a name
[41:08] but they were dead
[41:10] because that name was not the name of
[41:13] christ
[41:15] they died the minute they organized
[41:19] and those great groups
[41:22] wanting to have the preeminence
[41:25] just united themselves together and grew
[41:28] bigger and bigger as as a church they
[41:31] grew bigger and bigger by taking over
[41:34] the others like nimrod conquered the
[41:36] nations around him that conquered all
[41:39] the other churches around them brought
[41:42] them under their fold and grow into this
[41:45] great religious monstrosity
[41:48] and this evil harlot
[41:51] beast image system according to this
[41:55] bible of the book of revelation that now
[41:58] presents itself as the holy
[42:02] mother church
[42:05] now we see it here friends
[42:08] that when they did that
[42:11] that this
[42:14] first denomination
[42:17] the lutherans
[42:18] coming out
[42:20] of
[42:21] the
[42:22] roman church who is the mother of
[42:24] denominations she is the first organized
[42:28] church when they make that claim it's
[42:32] true
[42:32] they are the first
[42:34] certified
[42:36] organized church
[42:38] all the other denominations regardless
[42:41] of what they claim protestants are not
[42:44] they actually are daughters to the
[42:46] harlot
[42:48] taking
[42:49] various tweaking a little bit here
[42:51] tweaking a little bit there but
[42:53] somewhere in there
[42:55] maintaining the original shape and form
[43:00] of charts government order and doctrine
[43:05] as was given to them by their mother and
[43:08] they don't recognize it
[43:11] but this is a proven fact that this is
[43:14] what they're doing
[43:16] oh my
[43:18] think of the word of god fulfilling
[43:21] itself in this hour
[43:23] my lord
[43:25] today what do we have
[43:27] the baptist would be glad if all the
[43:28] methodists came over to them and filled
[43:30] their ranks
[43:32] pentecostals would be happy if all the
[43:34] baptists all the methodists all the
[43:36] other churches will come together and
[43:38] come to them and fill their ranks as if
[43:42] they're the open door to heaven but we
[43:46] know that the only door is jesus christ
[43:49] himself now the this
[43:53] then i'm a national spirit
[43:58] as motivated
[44:00] certain works
[44:03] that
[44:04] god abhors
[44:06] and is against
[44:08] because it has motivated them
[44:11] to write manuals
[44:13] amen they began to write manuals trying
[44:17] to protect
[44:18] their so-called revival of their age and
[44:22] their time
[44:24] it's dying out so before it dies
[44:27] let's let's have a skeleton of it let's
[44:30] let's put together a manual of it
[44:35] and then they began to teach creeds and
[44:37] dogmas
[44:40] furthermore
[44:41] they started to set up
[44:43] offices
[44:45] positions
[44:47] attractive to ambitious spirits of man
[44:52] who love to have great titles great
[44:55] names
[44:56] they
[44:57] they don't want to be great in spirit
[45:00] but a nobody in the world
[45:02] no they want to be recognized known and
[45:06] to have great titles gilded and gold oh
[45:11] my what a world we live in
[45:14] and they want to know that they are part
[45:18] of a great church government
[45:21] and then each one claims
[45:25] he or she alone speaks for god
[45:29] the best
[45:30] trained the best qualified
[45:33] amen
[45:34] to speak for god
[45:36] but that's exactly what the popes have
[45:40] done
[45:41] and is doing
[45:43] and so they're right back where they
[45:45] started
[45:47] they may not realize it but they're back
[45:49] to mother again
[45:51] they're back to being with her
[45:54] under the feathers of our wings again
[45:57] and don't know it as revelation 3 tells
[46:01] you're blind
[46:03] miserable naked and you don't even know
[46:06] it you don't recognize where you are and
[46:09] when someone tells you about it you
[46:11] claim i'm not blind i know what i'm i'm
[46:14] doing i know exactly what you're doing
[46:16] oh well continue my friends thou ask the
[46:20] name says the word of god
[46:23] that thou livest
[46:25] and you are dead spiritually
[46:28] once you are denominated
[46:30] you are spiritually dead
[46:34] you say yes but we are having revival
[46:37] and we're jumping and we're speaking in
[46:39] towns we're having healing we're having
[46:42] holy sacraments we're having charisma
[46:44] we're charismatic uh
[46:46] catholics we're charismatic methodists
[46:49] we're charismatic
[46:51] my friends that's as much as if you cut
[46:54] off the head of a snake or a worm
[46:57] and the body keeps wiggling and twisting
[47:00] that's moving around that does not mean
[47:03] it's alive thou hast the name that thou
[47:07] live us and our dead back to the word of
[47:10] god repent of your sins repent of your
[47:14] past and to those of you are hearing
[47:17] this think upon these things back to
[47:20] your bible search the word of god and
[47:23] see whether things these things that are
[47:26] being said to you from god's storehouse
[47:29] of his word of this day amen whether
[47:33] these things are so for they are so they
[47:37] are in the bible they are thus seek the
[47:40] lord not from me but thus set the lord
[47:44] from god himself through the prophet of
[47:46] this hour amen hallelujah yes sir praise
[47:50] god this age
[47:53] was blessed to bring about
[47:56] the great reformation
[47:59] but instead of being praised
[48:01] it finds itself in a unique position
[48:06] of being rebuked
[48:08] by the lord
[48:10] because it brought the reformation
[48:14] but at the same time it sought the seeds
[48:19] of denomination that will grow
[48:22] and flower in the ages that were to come
[48:26] amen
[48:28] yes sir
[48:29] and we know
[48:30] it will organize itself back
[48:33] until it organizes itself back into the
[48:37] bosom of the harlot church
[48:40] after god opened the door of reformation
[48:44] of revival for them to escape
[48:50] god
[48:51] open the doorway
[48:53] for them to
[48:54] get out of the roman dungeons
[48:57] and away
[48:59] from the
[49:00] a pagan
[49:02] church
[49:03] of that time
[49:06] amen
[49:08] and we find what when that came out
[49:10] there was not truly
[49:12] a spiritual
[49:14] body as it should have been
[49:18] but they came out and instead of
[49:21] following the fullness of the word
[49:23] they had a streak or strain
[49:26] of political
[49:29] things mixed in
[49:30] a mix of them
[49:34] at the time i want you to understand
[49:38] that the people of that time
[49:41] were crushed
[49:43] crying bleeding
[49:45] suffering
[49:47] under the yoke of rome
[49:50] the financial strain
[49:53] the physical
[49:55] tortures
[49:56] the hunger in their hearts
[50:00] and they were longing
[50:02] to run or to flee
[50:04] from rome
[50:06] god opened the door
[50:09] through reformation
[50:11] my friends
[50:13] so protestantism
[50:15] they did not just see it
[50:18] as a spiritual escape
[50:21] but they saw it as the means
[50:24] of a political escape
[50:27] from their natural financial and
[50:30] political religious systems that they
[50:33] were imprisoned in
[50:35] i'm showing you the birth of modern
[50:38] protestantism
[50:41] my friends
[50:44] they hated that roman system
[50:48] with its politics
[50:50] and financial bondage
[50:53] and hardships that it placed upon them
[50:57] instead of them having a great spiritual
[51:01] move of god
[51:03] with all the earmarks
[51:06] of the influence and power
[51:09] of the holy spirit
[51:11] uh upon them
[51:15] god
[51:17] using the holy spirit to bring about
[51:21] another pentecost in their midst
[51:24] instead of them allowing god to do that
[51:27] my friends
[51:29] they have turned the work of god
[51:32] and used
[51:33] the influence
[51:35] of god and the holy spirit
[51:38] the righteousness
[51:41] of god
[51:43] the wrath of man
[51:46] started to work out thinking it will
[51:49] produce the righteousness of god
[51:53] that parallels of course israel in
[51:55] history
[51:57] when they left egypt they wandered in
[51:58] the wilderness
[52:00] for many years
[52:02] and many of them did not make it to
[52:04] canaan's land so will it be today many
[52:08] will not make it into the glory land
[52:11] amen
[52:12] oh my so the yoke of rome
[52:16] let us have this clearly
[52:19] even at that time
[52:21] the beast whose head
[52:23] the beast was not killed
[52:26] but his head was only wounded
[52:29] and so
[52:31] a romanism
[52:34] its power was just partially broken
[52:38] was never completely
[52:40] broken whatsoever
[52:43] and man
[52:45] could receive the word of god
[52:49] and now yield to the holy spirit
[52:52] without the former fear
[52:56] that was upon them
[52:58] and this my brother sister gave us a
[53:01] window of time
[53:03] between then and now
[53:06] when men can freely praise god
[53:09] receive the influence of the holy spirit
[53:12] and do the works of god
[53:14] back then
[53:16] when they have that window
[53:18] great men begin to come forth
[53:20] and it opened up the doorway
[53:24] for the
[53:26] wesleyan church age
[53:29] it opened up the doorway
[53:32] my friends for the great missionary age
[53:37] that was to follow
[53:39] this age
[53:40] of sardis
[53:43] may god help every one of us
[53:46] to recognize
[53:48] the denunciation
[53:51] the condemnation
[53:53] of this
[53:55] denominational spirit
[53:58] that was allowed to

[54:26] under the domination
[54:28] of the lawless one

[54:34] as we take
[54:36] sight and look before us
[54:40] through this telescope of god's word
[54:43] and see what lies ahead see what is
