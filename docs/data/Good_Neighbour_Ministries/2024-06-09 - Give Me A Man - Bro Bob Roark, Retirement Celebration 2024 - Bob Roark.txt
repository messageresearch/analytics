our Shield how he was our armor through it all amen praise God Amen you know I had an opportunity to uh visit um one time with uh Pastor Keith Reed there in Linden Jamaica it's many years ago but I I I certainly can never forget it because boy they are uh one group of fire man I got up behind that Pulpit within three minutes we went from zero to 999 they had me doing upside down flip and everything else they were pulling so hard on the word of God I believe the fire it really moves in that place Hallelujah I can tell you that amen praise God we had such a wonderful time praise God so now I'm going to give you an opportunity to hear a few words from our brother he's um you know he's he's traveled many places he's seen many many miracles and the move of God praise God and we' like him to share just a few minutes because you know this is a celebration amen but we're celebrating him and his wonderful mercies and grace and the way he pours out through the Ministries and we're going to hear a lot more this evening at the celebration there's going to be testimonies there's going to be um you know songs so this this has only just begun amen come ahead brother Keith God bless you my brother let's welcome him amen God bless you Amen in Jamaica we say Wan we certainly give honor to the spirit of God and I'm just happy to be here with you all in this memorable occasion um it's not every day we have a service like this because most times um you know a a church does not change its Pastor unless somebody's dead but uh I I'm glad that brother John Simon is alive amen praise God hallelujah you know we we we see our whole time as a crossing over you know brother Chandler um today is a memorial service um brother beruti this week and then we heard of brother Franks who were gone you know and um it it tells us that God God is doing something but I I I certainly want to say to our precious Pastor who is retiring and I don't know if that is a correct political word in the church um that we we thank him in Jamaica we certainly say thanks to you you have been a tower of strength to us and um brother Thomas Brady who was my pastor you know he has some very dear friends and um it it's like who is his friends is my friends and I can remember when I took over the church in lindstad actually preached them out of a denomination from Monday to Friday and on Friday night all the sisters had resigned as ministers to the church so I was forced to be pastoring but brother Brady had always that I should um take over from him so he he he had that long succession planning that he said brother Keith don't wait until you hear that I can't stand in my Pulpit I want you to come and stand there no actually I am like the uh Butler that was in the prison with Joseph because actually when we actually decided that you know we we forget what we were supposed to do he has already being two years can't Pastor can't even communicate today and um you know it it's such mixed reaction to remember the many times that we've had that he had share that testimony having meet the prophet and it has been the highlight of his life from that day until the day when he speak no more that day with the letter in his pocket and sitting there with a trouble in his heart and brother brandham said I see a colored man he's not from here I see many Waters do you know God know what your name is Mr Brady you have a letter in your pocket and it's not for you it's for your wife and her feet is stolen it had to be God and so we've seen the Mighty God unveil before us in this day what kind of people are we to be in this hour and I also want to say to my precious brother Simon I I thank God that you are still strong and I I concur with brother um George simith that says we have some calls to call you because God's not finished with you yet but something that we must also realize that is precious wife sister I know many nights you might have rest your hands on him and because he he has problems in the church we can say he's an overcomer amen praise God God a and to think that he's passing on the Batton to a man who is strong who the church accept and there is no separation or turbulence in the church we say thanks be to God Amen and so we we say also to my precious brother darnie and his wife now you're taking the buttton it's not an easy Road no no no no no you you know I I look at when Paul charged Timothy he said I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead as is appearing in his kingdom he said preach the word be instant in season and not a season he said for a time will come when they will not endure some Doctrine but after their own love shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ear and they shall turn their ears away from the truth but he said watch thou in all things now my friend God has set you as the Watchman over the house of God and we never understand many times we' ignore what the wife of a pastor go through as he carry the load of taking care of the Soul of men as a matter of fact today is my wife's birthday happy birthday Francine because sometimes she's got to stand between him and the people many times we take the word and we beat down the wives and the women and so but there are strong Towers also who stand between the minister and the people sometime to guard him to make sure that he keeps his sanity you know so I say to you my sister stand with your man stand with your husband no matter what take side with him pray for him sometimes been fasting for him because the road is not easy you know just uh four weeks ago I was in Uganda and um God is really let my heart to work with the people of that country and you know sometimes it's to go among people who doesn't English is not their first language as my brothers speak of that they don't hear Brother Brandon's voice in English somebody sometimes has got to interpret that voice to them and interpretation is not a word but a concept of the meaning of a thought is so important to bring across to a people but I tell you one thing God is the same wherever we go I thank God that in my short time and I stand among Elders I've seen the dead raised I've seen the dying raised from the dying bed I've seen the power of God by the power of the Holy Ghost eel instantaneously amen and so we say like the apostle Paul today it comes not in words only but in power and the demonstration of the Holy Ghost amen and my brother Brooks who I'm trying to get help me pray because in September I need him to be in Uganda just help me pray and sister help me pray because I know if I win you to get him to go he'll be there amen but last night I was on the phone with brother Gideon and he said please brother brother George brother Brooks they would be good for Uganda you know I can remember just a few years ago we were sitting having breakfast as I just share a testimony with you and my wife get a call and um I was not hearing what was being said but I know something was wrong and as I begin to understand what was happening my trustee one of my trustee was driving through the mountains and um you know right there around the wheels he blocked out and died and the vehicle you know actually just go to the Rock and it just rests right there they so they called to tell us what was happening there was three persons in the vehicle they called the police and you know as I heard it it's like a state of emergency I run to my room and I grab my Bible and as I pull it apart I could see the red letter in Acts 1 and verse 8 for you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and as I was swiveling down to my knees something speak within me and said read the next verse and the next verse begin to say and he was taking out of their sight I didn't go on my knees then I said Lord not today not today I said Lord as I begin to Pace the floor and pray I said Lord let him come back in the house of God and share a testimony of everything that happened today and I begin to tell him who I know that he is because he's a Healer he's a deliverer he's a problem solver he's a burden Bearer and there's nothing that we can ask and believe that God won't to do it and as I paced the floor the inspiration struck me called them again and pray into his ears now how can you pray into the ears of a dead man you see God is not like us and the foolishness of man it takes to bring the power of God and I dial sister Dixon and I said sister Dixon she's screaming brother K is gone he's dead they say he's dead as I put the phone at his ears ke as I put the phone at his ears and I begin to call almighty God creator of Heaven and Earth Hallelujah bring my brother back to life amen and I prayed until she changed her scream she said brother Kate is trying to talk to you amen you know they took him in the hospital the doctors they didn't take him to the dead house they take him into a Ward and the doctors test they said we don't know what what happened cuz we don't see anything but you know as I went by his bed he be to tell me he said brother Kei he said I came out I could look at everything they were doing with my body he said I went back home I went around the house he said the flowers and the garden was the most beautiful I've ever seen it he said I was going up into that light he said I was looking over the city of Kingston and I said Lord how did I live in that mess up place for so long he said I didn't want to go back he said but when you call me I heard your voice amen so I tell you I've wrestled with demons i' pray for the demon possessed and I know one thing the god I serve if he can raise the dead I remember I was in just a little bit I was in Liberia and as I preached the young people it must have been 50 of them in the Altar and I was just going around and laying hands on them and brother C Caleb Duke and he touched me he said brother Keith there was a woman that is possessed with a devil you want to pray for her I said yes sir but when I turned around ah she was like a Raging Bull they were holding her and she was trying to come at me I said in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth come out of her and she lost all strength she swiveled down on the ground and she was a fast asleep snoring when everybody was leaving the church she was still there on the floor snoring my God is a mighty conqueror amen hallelujah what a day it is when we ought to realize that all that God had to do he has invested it in us and we are so privileged we have received a message that is Vindicated by God and this message is not for public show but that which you stand in need of God will solemnly and sovereignly by his grace produce it little bride we're not in the winner circle but we are the winner amen may God bless you as we see our elders retiring going on May we who are carrying the TCH of the gospel of Christ realize that we have just a little window to run the last mile of the road and let me tell you he said none that my heavenly father give me shall be lost they are going to come to the revelation of Jesus Christ and God has put it in us

to enjoy with you and you're here this morning uh and I'm sure you're here because there's something in you uh of that was worth you coming and you're honoring respect for brother and sister Simon uh uh is just unequal and I thank you so much for you being here today thank you and God bless you um 1st Samuel chapter 17 and I will Scurry through uh some remarks this morning everybody has heard the story uh or the event of David and Goliath so we'll just look at this uh kind of an over overview not reading the entire uh uh story uh and just glean some things that I think would be possibly important uh I I think it would be enhancing to our life on planet Earth and in our uh relationship with the Lord uh should I say Fellowship when you're born again your relationship is established and the word again h e a i n and you you the British people uh you pronounce that correctly it's a gain and you know I I'm from the south it's [Laughter] again uh 1st Samuel chapter 17 and let's just read uh for time's sake verse number 10 and then we'll take an overview of this uh story and this event and the Philistine this is Goliath I defy the armies of Israel this day give me a man that we may fight together and you can be seated thank you so much so with brother Dany uh brother Tim the deacons and and all uh this is a a qu of undertaking to say the very very least and uh you know brother Danny's been scurrying I I I mean there here everywhere and uh it's a very quite a gigantic un undertaking and we're very appreciative of the hospitality uh once again the pleasantries uh that we've enjoyed and and my wife Beverly is uh W with me on this occasion actually it's only the second time I think uh since we brought the uh the we chartered a bus up and uh we we certainly enjoyed that brother brandham said that when God calls the man he calls his wife so sister Simon it's also for you and uh and the young lady sitting to your uh to your right uh I didn't know who she was but we're glad to have Grace today to me have you ever seen a newscast maybe it's all a Serial murderer and the psychologist or psychiatrist may may be asked by the interviewer can you ever can you get in inside their minds to see how they think well whatever answer that may be provided here you have a book that got in in to the Creator's mind and these are his thoughts pinned on paper uh which thoughts are a Prelude to a word that is spoken now thought is that word unspoken and I'm quite thrilled as you would know about this person of Christ that he FS all and all everything everywhere with himself so fills everything everywhere with himself so there's not a a period of of time and whatever those circumstances that time that that season or period of time uh has challenged an individual with and you will be challenged I will be challenged and uh that that he fills everything with himself at all times omnipotent probably we would not have been as versed with the word omnipotent had it not been for brother brandham the word om uh omnipresent had it not been for brother brother renam uh the word infinite probably not not as been as acquainted with those expressions of this infinite being if it had not been for brother Brenham and he said after the seals uh he made the comment uh of this nature he said the Bible has become a a new book Hallelujah the word new in there's two Greek words for new in in the New Covenant or new testament and one of them is NEOS NE oos the other is canos k a i n oos and I I'm sorry that one of those words I should have been more exact but what one of those words mean that is applicable to that word uh that brother br expressed was uh it it is elevated to a a new level of quality so that's what happened to the Bible it was elevated to a new level of quality so when I look in in in the word into the mind of God what we are seeing the the decision making the verdict that he has issued uh toward particularly his family yes sir to you amen and his verdict and decision cannot change if he declared whatever that declaration is he declared it he doesn't have to redeclare it he doesn't have to reestablish it but it one one time and it's established forever oh lord your word is established it can it can't change it doesn't possess the ability to change but it possesses the ability to change what it's around so I'm I look at this mind of God and could I read you just a few things that would I think be of value actually uh in Genesis 1:1 the Bible says in the beginning God now in the beginning Elohim Elohim uh because there's nothing uh at that point to worship him in the beginning Elohim and and so this is a a new one for you Genesis 0.1 God he started start he began the beginning so I look into this great mind just for a few moments and we'll get uh back to 1st Samuel 17:10 uh the Bible says about you in 2 Corinthians 5:17 uh if if any man be where in Christ he's a new creature sir that word New Creation not renovated but a new creation old things are passed away in know the old and it's commonly called The Old Man Paul referred or use that expression the old man all that was attached to that oldness has passed away behold everything has become new amen everything has become new and he knew that knew no sin but became sin that we could become righteous the righteousness of God and if any man be in Christ he is the righteousness of God uh Ephesians chapter 1 would you like to maybe if you don't mind just turn there and we'll read uh chapter a number of verses of chapter one if you were confined or limited just one uh letter that Paul wrote uh now in my if for this is my opinion for me it would be Ephesians all all the great truths of of Redemption is provided in Ephesians 1 so let me just share with you few of the remarks that your heavenly bridegroom said about you and I believe that we'll come come away and think my goodness he sure thought a lot of me I'm highly thought of around 130 times in the New Covenant in the New Testament the words in him in whom in Christ is pinned by the first age messenger in him in whom in Christ so in verse number three of chapter one blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who is who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in the heavenlies in Christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world you were saved before you were saved you were healed before you were healed you were delivered before you were delivered you were filled with the Holy before you were filled according as he has chosen Us in him uh before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him him in love verse number six real quickly uh to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he has made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption and I'll pause here for just a moment now uh brother Brooks did a beautiful job on Friday evening brother Smith last evening and I told Brother George uh and now we really didn't know it uh his son William is good friends with uh he was like a father to me and uh this November will be two years of his deceased being deceased and uh so at his funeral service uh William and his wife were there unmistakable I could recognize William being a brandom having I mean it's just when I say A brandom you understand what I'm saying just have those family characteristics and and I think there were uh six speakers and I said after it was over with you're never going to get me to come last because everybody has said what they have said you stole every every line and every paragraph every statement every sentence uh that that I so uh so here you understand what I'm saying in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins now uh the translators uses the word forgiveness but when you look that up the best word that could be used is remission remission of sin in verse uh 10 that in the dispensation of the fullest of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ uh both in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom we have obtained an inheritance now this is your heavenly bridegroom this is he's your father God speaking to you and speaking to me speaking to his uh redeemed uh purchased possession and we we'll just uh skip a little bit right here uh verse 17 this is a prayer that is uh that Paul has prayed uh and it's really powerfully gripping that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usw who believe now his ability the word power means ability just simply God's ability his life has become your life amen the exceeding greatness so uh his ability exceeds greatness now my finite mind and perhaps yours uh maybe finds it a little sometimes a little awkward to try to uh assimilate these words and and and their their life their nature their empowerment their molding their uh their sculpting to how that we think and how that we think is how that we talk it's inevitable uh because it goes together you think it you will talk it and Jesus always talked the word of God always now we are in a human body that we uh uh you know we kind of slip of what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us work who believe according to the uh working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ and he now uses a point of reference that he is qualifying what was said here H about his ability now the word power means ability or or another word is Authority so the point of reference that he is using to to enhance what he has just previously spoken is the resurrection which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead set him at his own right hand in the heavenlies far above can we say far above all principality far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and has put all things under his feet and gave him to be head over all things to the church or to the body which is his body the fullness of him that fills all and all you know when when we just contemplate I have his fullness it may be measured but the measuring uh is a part of his fullness in this body Hallelujah so now we'll go back I wanted just to express to you uh some of the father's words to you uh you know know it's nice to get a uh some words of that magnitude in nature uh from somebody that knows you better than anybody Lord so the the fragment of verse number 10 is give me a man so that's my subject to you give me a man and uh actually Jesus liked and put value on fragments he said take them up so this fra fragment here uh give me a man uh to fight if you wanted to fast forward to uh uh Luke chapter 1 you don't have to turn uh there's a gentleman that is kind of uh well stricken in years now you know we don't like to use those those expressions will stricken uh but his name was Zacharias he had a wife and his na her name was pardon me uh his her name was Elizabeth and they a around this time there's this Angelic activity so uh here's an angel that comes to Zacharias and tells him now you your wife is uh kind of up in years but you you you all are going to have a b a boy his name's going to be John now Zacharias disbelieved now what made this worse for them was Zacharias and Elizabeth had a precedent and that precedent was Abraham and Sarah so they had a precedent of Abraham and Sarah and by them having this precedent in the history of Israel uh that just didn't allow them to escape uh so easily so Zacharias was uh uh stricken with without uh uh with speechlessness let me put it like that uh if I said dumb I use the word speechlessness because actually that's a euphan ISM that takes the the bite off of the the and the sharpness off of what what was said now the angel of the Lord C comes to Mary and tells her something that is biologically impossible Mary had no president but this is what she said to the angel of the of the Lord she said be it unto me according to your word be it unto me you know I don't know how this will transpire but be it unto me sir according to your word and of course here comes the Lord Jesus Christ Emmanuel God With Us on the scene and uh he was given uh to the World on the world stage and I call him the Wonderman I think we all have our insights and ideas I call him the Wonderman I I call him the Superman this person of Christ the Wonderman of Eternity the Wonderman of God the Superman he was God's first Superman but he he was not his last you might want to think of the person sitting beside in front or behind you and and and look at them and they're part of the Superman uh super race because you are born born from above of Incorruptible seed imperishable seed seed that cannot die seed that doesn't have an INF in no kind of death dealing uh uh attributes about it you are rebirthed amen you are a son a daughter of God and that is an absolute fact sealed in the Eternal books of Glory Divine Hallelujah here at this person of Christ he he condescended in Al Scurry he con condescended from the realm of Eternity the realm of the invisible and he became the image of the invisible God he he divested himself of and took up of his own Glory he took upon himself the form of a servant he took upon himself Flesh and Blood amen hallelujah hallelujah and he lived like a man Walk Like a Man actually his body being an Earthly body it it gave him his badge of authority upon the Earth amen so here he is in this body he come he is thrown hell throws everything that he can that it can at this man called Christ amen every every imaginable situation every imaginable condition of human life of human mess every imaginable circumstance in in this Earthly realm he was it was thrown at him what did he do he had a word Glory Hallelujah and an ability to back up what he said so he became what we were he became what you were if you feel like you have gone too far oh my anything short of hell is the grace of God you need to say Amen there anything short of hell is the grace of God he became the curse in in in all of its ugliness in all of its tentacles of Destruction brother brandham so enlightened so much about that realm that we you know that most people don't uh live in uh such as any sickness or disease he said said now that's only what the medical community calls it he said but what it is it's a [Applause] devil why don't you tell somebody I you I'm not going to get your medication for a you why would you feed a devil you understand what I'm saying it it is a devil a destroyer Jesus said it fed thousands he provided fish when there was no fish he satisfied the claims of divine Justice he met every requirement of Divine Law I couldn't do it you couldn't do it but he did it and the beauty of it is he did it for you and you're you're the one that it's credited to he defeated death by death he defeated the curse by becoming a curse Satan is eternally defeated there cannot be Eternal Redemption without an eternal eternally defeated enemy so Satan the enemy The Ark enemy of God and Humanity he is eternally defeated that's right and you are as a recipient eternally alive actually there's a statement that I love and embrace it's in Hebrews 2:14 uh maybe Brethren you could put it up on the on the wall Hebrews 2:14 and and could we look at it read it together for as much then as the children are flesh partakers of Flesh and Blood he also likewise himself took part of the same that through death that through death because he didn't stay there that through death he might destroy I love those words he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil now other renderings and I I I love to read other renderings and this is what other renderings say that through death he may the word destroy means he brought to not now You mathematicians that are sitting here this morning uh early afternoon uh uh Zero from whatever is still zero he brought him to not let's let's just say that he was brought to not so Satan does what he does by intimidation he knows he can never get the upper hand of that that real that believer when they are word conscious Hallelujah when they are versed in the word as you people are and and have the root system that is deeply embedded in the soul oil of the of the word of God that he might render him powerless which is another state uh uh translation that he might re Reen re render him powerless that had the power of death that is the devil you let's just say it together Satan you you have no authority over me Satan doesn't have any authority over you hallelujah thank God his life his sacrifice his death made it possible and a reality of being born from above by his imperishable incorrupt Incorruptible kingly Royal seed now I like to I like to use those words if you knew where I came from those words are extremely meaningful to me his imperishable Incorruptible kingly Royal Hallelujah see do you brother and sister it is wrong it is inappropriate that the believer act uh common you're not common we should not act common we should not walk common we should not think common or commonality uh because you are you're uncommon you belong to an uncommon father an uncommon Kingdom uncom you have uncommon uh uh uh promises you have an uncommon uh uh Declaration of facts that that is provided to you the Living Word is your father you're an heir of God and a joint Heir with Christ you're an heir of God can we just breathe that in I'm an air not of the kennedies the RO Rothchilds uh uh Rockefellers or any prominent name of wealth uh uh which is okay but you're an heir of God you're an heir of him you're an heir of he that FS all in all with himself there back in the late 40s um there were some other another Angelic activity you'll remember these words I am sent from the presence of almighty God to tell you of your unusual ual life ever remember those those words to tell you of your unusual life God gave to the world a man I'll say it again God gave to the world a man it it is like that he provided the awesome dessert before the main Corp because he started out with uh with what would be revent and a common denominator with all humans they want they want to be better they want a better quality of life they they don't they don't want to be sick and they don't want to uh you you know on and on so it's almost like they started out with the dessert if you don't mind me uh me healing is it's not desert but in my trying to illustrate until the main course until that seventh messenger began to drop the morsels to the predestinated that that only God knew where they were brother Brooks it was on a playground uh brother George I think uh brother brandham came up up to the pickup said oh my look it's a fin looking uh bunch of preachers here a amen so God gave a man that would uh that through him the the attention W would be attracted so that we would be uh put in a position and order that we could hear what he's saying yes so when he when he began to drop those morsels to the predestinated eagle glory be to God you you didn't know who you was you might have been the a member of uh uh whatever religious order or system but when you begin to ingest and digest and assimilate not just for the sake oh I want to be a part of that group no no no no that doesn't work be because it's something to special to you the IND individual I know people that uh uh they let the the the uh the the females let their hair grow just to be a part of a group you know maybe maybe it's okay but when when you have a personal experience when when when when the Holy Spirit drops that word into your heart into your mind my brother and sister uh it doesn't matter what anyone else is doing it doesn't matter what they're thinking it doesn't matter where they're going it doesn't matter where they live it doesn't matter what they drive my brother and sister uh that that you are set apart and when you're set apart you're set above because you can't be set apart without being set above than Lord God gave us a man in 1966 brother TL osbor how many you ever heard the memorial addressed by Brother osbor sure it I I'm assuming that it would still be available friends it is Absolut absolutely magnificent and just an as an excerpt this is what brother Osman which brother brandham thought a lot of brother Os from what I get he and he said we had forgotten we had forgotten what God was like we had forgotten how he acted we had forgotten what he looked like but but he crossed our paths again first time it was Christ uh uh the word personified but this time he crossed our path again in the person of a little Kian and he showed us what God was like now I wasn't there and perhaps the majority of you wasn't wasn't there uh I remember the gentleman's name and I think he still living and if that be the case he's well over a hundred years of age his name was Ernest fure he's gone okay uh we had went we had gone to because uh brother Jackson Raymond Jackson was going to be at his uh facility in Christiansburg Virginia and so we went to hear Brother Jackson and at that time they brother fer was making provisions and you know in the planning uh stages of having brother brandham coming uh I believe perhaps in the spring of the following year but you know unfortunately that never happened and uh but the beauty of God sending a man that could tell a ring bull I'm sorry I've trespassed on your territory and now Brothers he didn't say now I don't have my gun he just said I'm sorry that I've trespassed on your territory because uh it was said of brother brandham that he was a Millenia man I remember Billy Paul saying when he was asked what are you what's the one thing that stands out uh with your father and his words were he knew how to handle every situation Well if I knew how to handle 20% of my situations I I would be doing pretty good but uh but Billy Paul brother Billy Paul said he uh he knew how to handle every situation so he crossed our path so the the ones that received the as I referenced the the morsels they they be they realized now I'm more than a product of a religious system or order they began to realize this is not only William bram's time this is my time and this is still our time well let me go from that point God give us a man God give us a man so in Guyana South America the Holy Ghost began grooming a young mid- teenager that in time will become a soul winner a magnanimous blessing an an equal inspiration a teacher a mentor I'm talking for me and a friend could I read it again I I did a good job with this folks don't don't don't don't stare at me too too hard so the Holy Spirit began grooming a mid teenager that that in time would become a soul winner a tremendous blessing and equal inspiration a teacher a mentor a friend brother Simon my path in life was crossed in the sun in the country of Singapore and I all I can say the rest is somewhat history and uh that that was the beginning of a beautiful beautiful uh fellowship at a mid teenager the Holy Spirit accompanied his preaching with Supernatural confirmation mid teenager brother Simon was experiencing the favor of God that the Bible says surrounds us like a shield he was experiencing healings not just a headache these that's important yes but they were physic IAL undeniable miracles signs devil screaming coming out of the the poor victims why was he able to do this and I'm just about through why was he able to do this no one had told him you can't you that you can't Hallelujah uh you know I know brother Eastman mentioned last night and I thoroughly enjoyed you know that portion of him describing their relationship and friendship over the over year the years and U uh the reason that brother Simon still calls out Devils today screaming I'm serious because that nobody has told him the state preser didn't tell him his uh professor in college never told him uh brother George never told him brother Brooks never told him brother Keith never told him uh that you can't do that that was only for one no the whole body is filled with a with an ability with a a a glory with a an authority look if you if you don't if you don't Faith doesn't require any kind of sense evidence Faith doesn't require you feeling better Faith doesn't require uh well uh uh things are different faith has one Foundation that it rests on and that is the word or the promise of God your condition may not change immediately overnight or in a week or or two weeks but my brother and sister you stay there based on the promise of God and I will guarantee you that ability of the master is going to start working its way glory be to God working its way through those conditions and and physical uh physical disabilities and what have you my brother and bringing you Deliverance bringing you Victory say Amen well I just can't get it off my mind well the doctor said this and the physician said whatever uh I remember uh I spent a number of years in the Air Force and I do want to remind brother Simon uh that there's a an initial I in sports that means injured reserve but in the US military brother George if you you remember IR means uh hang on don't feel sorry for me yeah when you're discharged from the the military they tack on two years I know what the Air Force did they tack on two years and uh it is inactive reserve and what they're telling you don't you don't get too comfortable with your uniform uh and letting the moss eat holes in it because you may be putting it back on within that twoyear period of time so uh so the IR the uh inactive reserve now he's he's only 18 months out I mean he's got 18 months to go he's only six months out so he's got to te keep his suits nicely pressed shirts nicely pressed shoes shine my say Amen see and ready for the call or duty at any time now you've that's been around brother Simon uh you know he's impeccably dressed his presentation is impeccable and that's the way the way it should be uh I like it when he's ministering with us for us and he he just breaks out in a into a song it just it's in in sync so no one told him that he couldn't do what he uh began to do and that he continues to do he had no religious platform but he had plenty of passion brother Danny referenced last night that brother Simon told him one day we're going to have a new building a new place to assemble that we can worship that's going to the building and property is going to be worth millions we're sitting in it today the reason that brother Simon makes a different difference rather is because he is different he preaches with depth and practicality he is set apart and set above he is he has an amazing spiritual resume that he is still working on so we're appreciative that brother Simon brother John Simon will not give up back up shut up or let up until he is taken up now I don't mean this for this but by any means to sound morbid uh it's just a part of life this is called the Dash and musicians you can you can come to your instruments if you'd like I read of a man who stood to speak at the funeral of a friend he referred to the dates on the tombstone from the beginning to the end he noted that the first came the date of birth and spoke of the following date with tears but he said What mattered most of all was the dash between those years for that Dash represents all the time that was spent alive on Earth and now only those who loved know what that little line is worth for it matters not how much we own the cars the house the cash what matters is how we live and love and how we spend our Dash so think about this long and hard are there things you'd like to change for you never know how much time is left that can still be rearranged if we could just slow down enough to consider what's true and real and always try to understand the way other people feel and be less quick to anger and show appreciation more and love the people in our lives like we've never loved before if we treat each other with respect and more often wear a smile remembering that this special Dash might only last a little while so when your eulogy has been read with your life's actions to rehash would you be proud of the things they say about about how you spent your dash can we just stand to our feet thank you once again for you allowing me to speak to you my lips get dry my mouth gets dry [Music] let's just sing what we sang while ago I'm not on an ego trip I'm not on an ego trip I'm nothing on my own I make mistakes I often slip just common Flesh and Bones but you see someday just what I say I'm of a special kind I want to emphasize it when he was on the cross the bride was on his mind yes he knew me yes he love me yes he whose Glory makes the heaven [Music] shine Oh So [Music] Unworthy of his Mery when he was on the cross I was on his [Music] M now Look of Love was on his face the thorns on his head his blood was on that Scarlet Ro it stain a crimson red and though his eyes were on the crowd he looked onad in time Glory Hallelujah glory be to God you're not an afterthought he knew yes he loves me he whose Glory makes the heavens shine now So Unworthy of his

said it's not so hard to die when I can see my home [Music] almost almost I've got a mention waiting I'm almost home almost home almost home I've got a mansion waiting there our amen every time I hear that song I think of that man right over there Lord Pastor John Simon you may be all seated just for a moment um I just want to uh take a few moments to um you know the transition and and uh the um you know you might want to call it a retirement we you know this weekend we we see it in a much greater way we see it as a a life of achievement and um there's a um a saying or a title it's emitis the word is spelled e m e r i t s so what about this term emor us what does it mean it's a Latin word referring to one who has earned his discharge by faithful service it's a kind of the opposite of dishonorable discharge in the military in 1 Timothy 5:17 it says let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor especially those who labor in preaching and teaching well I was honored a hundred ways while I was pastor of Bethlehem John Simon was honored and we could honor him a thousand ways as the pastor of eagles cry Ministries and later good neighbor Ministries and today it's very important for us to recognize this transition and for us as a congregation and his sheep to say Shepherd we release you we let you and your precious wife move on to the next stage of what God has has in store for you when you're in the service of the Lord and you are called of God as a Son of God we know it's an eternal call it's not a temporary call yes we do experience position here on Earth and God gives us certain positions and authorities but when we as Sons and Daughters of God are awak we recognize we have no beginning and we have no end and so it's important for us here naturally to release our pastor and his wife and to say we love you we support you we will always be there for you because you are our father and our mother spiritually and you will always be um in important and respected and you will have the double honor that you fully deserve for the years of dedication and service and and love that you showed towards us brother Bob made a statement and said a man of generosity I have not met somebody that's as generous as John Simon it's as simple as that he gives in every way and so because of that he's made us better sheep he's made us better people and he's given us examples of how to live and how to minister the word of life and the word of God and so um we've got a plaque that um was placed at the front you'll notice it as you come in the front doors there's the plaque there it's placed and it has been permanently glued to the glass and it will stay there as long as we are here and until we go and it says honoring Pastor John Simon and sister Desiree for dedicating your lives to the ministry of Jesus Christ and through your leadership through obedience to the holy spirit with love the good neighbor Ministries Family God richly bless you Pastor John Simon I'm now going to invite our pastor to come and to allow him to say a few words sister Desiree if you would come forward we'd like to present to you these flowers and we'd like you to come and stand here next to Pastor John God bless you thank you thanks be to God first of all I want to say welcome to every one of you represented here today I thank you for for uh returning to your roots uh I also want to uh thank God for friends and relatives that are here today I'm happy for those who have known me from Boyhood and those who have known me since God brought me into the ministry uh here on this point as you know I am not a pastor that ever took over any any church all the churches that have come out from this ministry were God allowed them to be founded by me the foundations were laid and then pastors were left to Carry On by the grace of God uh that's the way it has always been and God never never allowed me to build an organization or a church that's 3,000 thousands could have been but every time I would get to maybe 500 550 he'll just cut it in half back down to 250 sometimes it goes down to 120 and then it builds back up again it goes up and gets there well now things are going to really it goes right back down but I never noticed it that it was churches coming off churches coming off like that and then once I understood that I became at peace with myself and realized what God was doing with his own plan and his own program uh just I'm I'm not going to speak much because I have to speak tonight and and I don't want to uh I'm not wanting using a double barrel on you or acent right because some preachers want to use an accent 238s uh uh on you but I wouldn't do that but praise the Lord it was has been a wonderful ride a wonderful journey and I thank God for that called at 12 years old uh you know uh in the form of uh the face of the Lord Jesus Christ person of the Lord Jesus Christ coming I didn't know at that time who it was later it came to realized who it was and at 14 as our brother testified the burning of in my heart because I wasn't a member of any church I went to the Catholic school and the Catholic church because that's how we can get an education at the time and so that burning was so much that myself and Bishop Michael Patterson of uh Georgia buur Georgia uh took to the streets as young men and we began to preach make it quickly a Revival broke out there was still a Pentecostal Church there of about 2500 people because of that Revival that broke out in that city so we thank the Lord for that then he took me to the to the uh the Assemblies of God give me a scholarship went to their school and then the prophet's message came right and when the message came of course they said for certain doctrines which you hold that are contrary to our F Fai you are hereby excommunicated so I I I thank them very much for the letter because I said at least you admitted it is contrary to your faith but not to the word of God and I remember that uh wonderful gentleman wonderful people uh no problems there wonderful people but I was in the meeting up here in Al Alberta and first time in Canada brother Perry green had uh brought me up along with the uh the Johnson boy from not boy now man in Arizona and Fran liar from Switzerland uh we came up with a lot of stuff books and stuff like that to preach in the uh first real tent meeting they were having there for bringing the Believers together that came out from Brother branham's Ministry uh and so myself brother Hiller Brandt and brother uh B Blitz I believe yes uh the that helped to you know put up the tent there and we were working brother perigrine went back to Arizona because he had an emergency and so there I was uh and uh nobody knew I was a preacher and I didn't tell him I was a preacher we just did what have to be done the meetings started they were going on and then this little man comes through the crowd to me and brother says who are you this is brother Ernie fander he said who are you I said oh you know I'm just from Guyana I'm just a brother and Christ he said no no no he says I feel something coming out of you every time you shout hallelujah and amen and I wanted to know who's that so that's why he came down he says come and preach to my church and I said okay brother I'll come right and then he went and told them I'm a preacher they asked me to preach and then the Holy Spirit moved in a special way and that way um the preachers start coming with having churches with in those days it was a big church if you had two and three 100 people so um uh they asked me and I said no I can't come he said why so brother fandon said but you only has what five men in or five or six men in a farmhouse said so uh we have a big church I said no it's not like that I already committed to him I'm going there right so it worked out that way I went there and I can't tell you all of this anyway it was just marvelous my wife is standing up here too long and and but she stood by me for such a long time amen I did not even realize or C the years that actually being in Ministry over 64 years preaching the gospel my it's only when a brother mentioned it the other night and they wait a minute my goodness I'm old my goodness it's marvelous I thank God for that he gave me this Grace I'm not finished you know we just use the terminology of retirement but really Servants of God can't and don't retire but as far as human life the Holy Spirit comes to me in the night and says it's time for you to step down and step aside now he has something else that he has me to do but I don't know what that is yet but I've learned to just obey regardless of the circumstances so that's the reason if you're thinking and wondering of what's the reason that you do that if he can take Phillip at the height of a Revival or as we would say of success and move him out of there to go speak to one man he's still the same God why why do we why are we puzzled by these things right if you're really a servant of God you're moved by the spirit of God and the spirit of God just moves you praise the Lord hallelujah I'll mention to you also that you know the scriptures all Tidings in the church belongs to the pastor how many knows that but what God didn't allow me to do that I just have been taking a salary you understand taking a salary it's right there and from Young it's not from coming here but while young seeing the life of Billy gram uh and the example he never had any questions about him and money and and investigation nothing of the sort the man lived a clean wonderful life and that so struck me as a young man that I said I'm just going to stay that way and I'm going to walk in that kind of a way I just need to live I don't need to use or have the church to be the means of uh getting rich or this or that but I am going to just live God's life and live the way he wants me to live now I'm not saying that that that should be the way for everybody I'm just telling you that's the way he has dealt with me amen God may make another person prosper and have all that's wonderful and I will all the way praise God and thank God for them amen wonderful but this is the way I'm just talking of the way he has led me and brought me along to this time so I'm here and I thank God for it thank God for you all my friends and brothers and at this portion of time uh brother Danny who was standing here God has blessed him and God will continue to use him and his precious wife sister Jennifer I didn't choose them to be in this position I did not elect them in any way you the people elected them amen uh look I did not get behind the scenes and uh uh let's say by slight of hand or evil machinations of the human mind tried to uh twist people around around or use political Maneuvers and not it's the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit did that praise the Lord and I want to thank God for that because I can not this Bible this is still my Bible but I can hand the Baton to him hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord stand up brother then I know you you've seen him but but give him a second look look at him again praise the Lord and listen to him and God because it's not once you realize it's not the man anymore like it used to be in all these systems any man if God calls him and he stands in the Pulpit don't listen for just the man but listen to the voice behind his voice listen to that one and make God bless you and may you as a church will speak later this evening lead you and guide you and prosper and grow what God has given to us here this is our church home this is the place your brothers to and I'm sure God's hand will continue to lead you I'm cutting my throat now uh with Solomon says you get to a certain point just cut your throat so God bless you and thank you my friends thank you family thank you for all believers many Believers sited here and those of you online that are listening some in the country some outside of the country so all around praise the Lord uh churches raised up everywhere individuals saved everywhere thank God for that and lives influence by the gospel of Christ they all did not come to this message many are in other Pentecostal ranks even while I'm ad ministering a message just trying to tell them live a better life you come to know Christ tell him the gospel tell him about the prophet the message and they don't seem to take it you realize that maybe they're among not amongst the Chosen Few but God knows his own time maybe I'm not the one that they need to listen to maybe it's another person so I just let rest let things go on and let the Lord have his way God bless you for having patience with me while I'm speaking here and putting up with uh an old man an old preserve well you know they like to preserve things in uh liquids and vinegar and all kinds of stuff but I just thank God that he preserved me in Christ right I'll talk I'll talk about her tonight so uh just so she can be nervous between now and then so but God bless you SS to see God bless you real God take care God bless you all thank you so much thank you brother Danny uh if you got another minute because you got two hours um we do have the little guys uh ones who wrote actually wrote a poem for for pastor Simon and sister P so if those little ones can come those young ones I don't know how little they are or yep oh not so [Music] little now you you guys wrote this for oh yeah fantastic um on behalf of the Sunday School Ministry um we would like to dedicate this poem to pastor Pastor Simon and sister Desiree pastor Simon is great he has so many good traits he points me in the right direction whenever I need correction when I am sad Pastor Sim Pastor Simon
