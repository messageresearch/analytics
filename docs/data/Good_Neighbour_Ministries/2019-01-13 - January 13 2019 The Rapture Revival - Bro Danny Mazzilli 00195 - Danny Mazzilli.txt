TRANSCRIPT
========================================
are you with her husband noticing God is the husband of the church and the church is his bride all of the church only knew its position it knows what it is and that's our desire this one to the Lord to bring to our remembrance to revive us because he'll let me give you some descriptions of revive I love some of these district revive you know to go back to you look at translations in the Bible of the Greek and everything else it says tossed to live to restore but something you need to be [Music] that's a restoration to be there's people that are miserable we can't be by my work in the midst of the years reviving in the translation preservation means of life this is translation to live again to get you know to go back to your first love a lot of people in the first love of this word in this hour [Music] to [Music] [Music] exercise this is the true state he says it is just stir up the gift it says stir into a plane you need to know here are five people to dislike sebacio some people kind of goes up to the air on the bride [Music] [Music] is addressed we too have to merely pray for me Bibles forgetting that it is for us to stir into play as a city or you know that each and every one of us there's a theory but yes you know that God put out there please God being different for a purpose there is not one of us Isis that's I think that's the same not one of you God had a purpose for that that's why each and every one of us in the body has the purpose none of us to sing into it I hope you catch his prosperity if it's mine [Music] [Music] positionally placing sons and daughters of God holy is now setting in all the [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you said Jesus Christ my life but you never receive the Holy Ghost coming it's never too late you'll know you will know that you will know if you have the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the scripture says repent and be baptized repent not proceeding to repent repent means they turn away from what you thought was the truth just break it up [Music] [Music] [Music] she's not the same you need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because he is the core of the church the hospital gives his name to the bride and a bride that refuses to take her husband's name is not really truly married in her hospital she's staying independent [Music] yeah cyclically and that the Bible says in acts 2:38 you shall receive the gift of Jesus ascension which is the Holy Ghost into all truth you see how simple it is now once you come God provided with a complicated Network [Music] it just shows that there's an attribute that responds to was written in the Lamb's Book of Life the reason why you know your names right there's because you're here [Music] [Music] this is the book of Ephesians in this position you put back and beat the book of Joshua we'll see everything in the book of Ephesians positionally placing the body of Christ into their land giving them their portion of land Joshua he told them you take this part you take that part is because of his positioning and then there was perfecting this position because in craftiness even Christ seems I will see her there you don't want to get caught up in all these cutting practice they've got all these things in Egyptian pyramids and balsam cities across people are missing the extraterrestrials all that stuff it's got nothing to do with you and you were not back there you want to look at the history look into his name and find yourself next slide now what that Sun was placed position into the penalty he was joint-heir he was Detroit air to go back by the Sun because back to do is the father would give the subtler tool and we'll place that Sun under that Twitter and that Pluto would have to come back and let the the master know what the Sun is doing and how has happened and how is living if he's out there the women every night full of money that that that's waken if he's out there or what he's doing he wants to know this son has the right character to take his position as a joint heir in the kingdom and so he was just as much an authority because in the into the church in the oh this is going to preach that that can't I gotta pee oh it's only brother soldiers that's currently especially is next [Music] [Music] in the comes into the church [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] adopted into the family of God [Music] Thanks if the programs not also relatively small they're all sponsors is that it Oh next one we've got a ministry company that's just exactly like the lion Christ what does that this verifies the when this ministry comes into its fullness because the price is fully processing and the people are say oh he's coming [Music] because we place in the headship the body's perfect [Music] that's the oh that's the that's that's the actual return of Christ but he's the body of creation is waiting for the church to positionally find its place Oh would the weak yourself know when they'll stop secrets cancer bill some disease that's what we're striving for now to get in and be position we placed into the kingdom of God before these horrible plagues because the tribulation is coming in the Perkin urban interchange brother proud he says in these last days the true bride church christ seed will come to the headstone and she will be the super church a super race as she nears him they the bride will be so much like air that they look even be in his very image we are taking on the image of christ having the same abilities have the same unworthy though underestimate what you've heard the testimonies if you really missed if you miss Wednesday night service you missed a fantastic wonderful service because Desmond Ron you need to listen to that he brought some testimonies of how God is moving in his life through the supernatural healing of people and individuals that he's come into contact with you see each and every one of us all have different parts of the body of President remember and when you come to recognize what your position is I'm happy I'm always happy I got the joy in the Lord I feel I used to do it God that is his right do you know that God placed that in there because what people see him when people come into his presence and he's got that revelation with God all things are possible places having other people he tells them I believe God can you in the name of Jesus people come people and that people get back you see we all have a part of this ministry each one of us has something we need to allow Holy Spirit to use just that but you're not I've seen how it all fits together because we are all in a certain position we all have to operate as God has given us baby operated our positions and not the swapper to do asks us to do in this bowl or the rather speakin in the message to super Simon said he came to be the seal Abraham that he might show a super race now Abraham had a seed naturally not super see does full of supers to remember and Abraham had superseded in Jesus came that he might redeem the super seed of paper has raised you see how Abraham see if you've got the faith of Abraham and you are Abraham's seed then you are part of that super race you are part of that that that I've collected son and daughter God that God needs to positionally place in this thing at this hour so that you can fill your part in God super race the superseded Arab race but is sure to do it race with supernatural sides of a supernatural sons and daughters of God they are supernatural anybody else so I'm not talking about this don't ever lift this thing up you won't we be trying to lift this thing up something knocks it down it's that simple no God says I'm doing it I've spoken just get into your position let me use you how I need to use every one of you [Music] [Music] [Music] to support [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] our Lord if there's anything you want to oh god let you anoint them wash purge cleanse everything that's not a buter lives will not let the Spirit of the Lord raise a standard that we might live that we would be an example of your love your compassion your mercy and your grace you see on the department side you see everyone is crying that's asking for a change the one who changed your transform they don't want anymore whatever it is wonderful praise all that you've
