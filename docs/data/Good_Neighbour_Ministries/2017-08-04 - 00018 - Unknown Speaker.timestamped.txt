[7:38] Okay. So,
[7:41] [Music]
[7:48] so our object is a band-aid.
[7:54] [Applause]
[7:55] So, hi everyone. This is the Turner
[7:58] family. Over here we have the son, Abe
[8:01] Turner.
[8:03] We have Daniel Turner and we have Rachel
[8:06] Turner. So, Rachel and Abe Turner back
[8:09] from the church. But Daniel Turner
[8:11] stayed true to the Lord and attended
[8:12] church every Sunday. This is their
[8:14] story.
[8:24] Hey, bro. Hey, sis. What's up? Not much.
[8:27] You want to play hide and go seek? I'm
[8:28] so out. You're counting. All right, go.
[8:32] Okay. 1
[8:34] 2
[8:36] 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. Ready or not,
[8:45] hey, bro. It's not the king, bro.
[8:50] Two more weeks. Give
[8:53] me
[8:57] [Music]
[8:59] three. You get
[9:03] crushed. You get crushed.
[9:06] Yeah, that's okay. See this? I saw some
[9:10] money off it.
[9:16] Are you
[9:18] okay?
[9:19] Oh. All right. All right.
[9:24] Dad, you have to help Abe. He fell. I
[9:26] mean, he got beaten up.
[9:30] I'm serious. He's really hurt.
[9:34] A, are you okay? What happened to him?
[9:38] How did this happen? He got beat up by
[9:40] Latino.
[9:43] Let's go to God in prayer. No, we need
[9:45] to go to the hospital. Doctor, take it
[9:47] to the Lord in prayer.
[9:50] Bless my son. You know, you might have
[9:53] sinned his life, Lord, but you just have
[9:55] to keep him, Lord. Just save his life,
[9:57] Lord. Just heal him. Bring me to a
[10:00] doctor.
[10:05] Okay, I think it's okay.
[10:07] [Music]
[10:13] So since Abe was an atheist, he never
[10:15] accepted God's healing. Instead, he
[10:17] chose to go to the doctor and depended
[10:20] on science to heal him. Let's see what
[10:21] happens next.
[10:27] [Music]
[10:28] Okay. What's your uh health insurance?
[10:31] Insurance, right?
[10:34] No insurance.
[10:36] Do Do you guys have insurance? Uh is
[10:38] that I'm sorry.
[10:44] [Music]
[10:51] [Music]
[10:53] One hour later.
[10:56] Hey, can you just bring in those people?
[11:02] [Music]
[11:05] Oh, wow.
[11:10] Oh, he's he's okay. He's not okay. He's
[11:13] just a little bit of water. He's
[11:17] [Music]
[11:18] I think he needs sleep. I think he's
[11:19] just going to bring me home to sleep.
[11:20] There's nothing. I'm sorry.
[11:24] I'm sorry. Tylenol and sleep. I think
[11:28] he's just Tylenol. I'm sorry. That's
[11:31] all. Tylenol. We'll take it for Pastor
[11:34] Chris.
[11:37] [Music]
[11:41] After science failed him, Amy tried the
[11:43] unorthodox way of healing.
[11:49] All right, everybody. Let's sing that
[11:51] song. Right.
[11:53] [Music]
[12:04] Everywhere.
[12:13] All right, we got something special here
[12:14] today. Um, Sister Angela for the first
[12:16] time in a while told me, "Oh, I want to
[12:18] sing a song." So, come here, Sister
[12:19] Angela, sing a song.
[12:21] [Applause]
[12:26] [Music]
[12:34] Amen.
[12:37] There is
[12:39] power in the
[12:46] name. There is
[12:49] power in the name of
[12:55] Jesus to break every chain. Break every
[13:00] chain. Break every chain.
[13:05] to break every chain. Break every chain.
[13:11] Break every
[13:18] chain. Pastor Chris.
[13:25] Amen. Praise the Lord. It's good to be
[13:27] in the house of the Lord this morning.
[13:30] Amen. Amen. Let's jump right to our
[13:32] scripture here. Here we'll go to Isaiah
[13:34] 53 verse 4 to 5 just to let me know.
[13:38] Amen. If you guys have it in your
[13:40] Bibles. Amen. Amen. Surely he has bore
[13:44] our griefs and carried our sorrow. Yep.
[13:47] We did esteem him stricken, smitten of
[13:50] God and afflicted, but he was wounded
[13:53] for our transgressions. He was bruised
[13:55] for our iniquities.
[13:57] The chastisement of our peace was upon
[14:00] him and with his stripes we are healed.
[14:03] Amen.
[14:05] Amen. I think of an eternal uh band-aid.
[14:09] Amen. That's the blood of Jesus Christ,
[14:11] right? I think of a mom. Maybe a son
[14:13] falls off his bike and he's bleeding and
[14:15] the mom comes and carries around and
[14:17] puts on a band-aid. But that band-aid is
[14:19] only temporary.
[14:24] Amen. The blood of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[14:28] He's the same yesterday and today
[14:30] forever. He's right now. Amen. Praise
[14:33] the Lord. Yes. Believe it. Thank you,
[14:37] Lord. Amen. Pastor Chris, my son, he
[14:41] needs help. He got beaten up. We'll pray
[14:43] for him.
[14:44] Saints, come join me. Amen.
[14:48] [Music]
[14:51] Oh God, may you come, Father God, now
[14:54] and help, Lord, this man, Father God,
[14:56] same day. Amen. I pray you bless him,
[14:58] Father God, and help him, Father God.
[15:01] Lord, be so true to him, Father God. Let
[15:03] him reach out in faith, Father God. Oh,
[15:06] help him, Father. Just that eternal
[15:08] banning, Father God. Lord, that Lord,
[15:10] once he applies in his hearts, they'll
[15:12] be changed, Father God, from the inside
[15:14] out, Father God. Use him, God. Lord, I
[15:17] believe it's an eagle, Father
[15:19] God. Cry out, Father God, in Jesus
[15:22] Christ's name. Lord, let me accept
[15:24] healing right now. He's in Jesus
[15:26] Christ's name.
[15:28] Amen. Amen. Sister, brother, uh, Brother
[15:32] David, you can sing a song. All right,
[15:34] sister. That's all
[15:37] [Music]

[20:11] bad. Flashback.
[20:14] [Music]
[20:22] As they were swimming in the water, she
[20:24] fell out of the boat. And as her head
[20:26] sunk into the water, he reached out his
[20:29] hand. She couldn't breathe. and he grabs
[20:31] her and he pulled her out of the water
[20:32] and told her he would never ever let her
[20:34] drown again. And she kissed her on her
[20:35] cheek as she
[20:57] What are you talking about? Can you you
[20:59] go to camp or something? You were out
[21:01] there yesterday with that boy. That boy.
[21:04] That boy. He's touching you everywhere
[21:05] like this. What are you talking about? I
[21:07] want to go to camp. Go back to sleep. Go
[21:10] sleep off your faith.
[21:13] I mean, he goes to church. He plays
[21:16] guitar. I mean, it can't be that bad. I
[21:18] mean, he does love God, right?
[21:21] Flashback.
[21:28] You should try this girl. I don't think
[21:30] so. Yeah. Why not? No.
[21:47] [Applause]
[21:49] Wait. Oh my
[21:51] god. Seriously.
[21:55] [Music]
[22:09] Man, I feel awful now. It's so true. I
[22:12] mean, all those things I did, I don't
[22:14] feel good enough. I mean, I'm such a
[22:15] hypocrite. I mean, why would I want to
[22:16] go to camp after doing all that? I
[22:20] mean, seriously. I mean, I'm just going
[22:22] to feel so bad about all the wrong
[22:24] things I did. And I probably should go,
[22:27] though, when my meetup parents help me,
[22:29] right? I mean, seriously.
[22:36] [Music]
[22:58] your child.
[23:00] [Music]
[23:07] Oh, hey guys. in charge.
[23:13] [Music]
[23:16] Some of you might be thinking, I can't
[23:18] even meet this pimp because I got sin in
[23:20] my life. I need to get the sin in mind.
[23:23] Maybe some of you had drugs last week.
[23:25] Smoking the drugs.
[23:29] I'm here to tell you, maybe some of you
[23:31] read those songs. Maybe some of you were
[23:33] sitting here thinking, "Well, you know,
[23:36] Brother Diggs, I want boyfriend.
[23:39] And I just want to tell you that tonight
[23:42] we can get over this. There is an answer
[23:44] to the sin question. Amen. His name is
[23:48] Jesus. We're going to pray. So I want
[23:52] anyone that wants prayer to lift their
[23:53] hands tonight. We can close those doors.
[23:55] Okay? Just lift your hands. We're going
[23:58] to
[24:02] pray. Father, you're going to have the
[24:04] answer to the same question. And these
[24:08] do you see that he's with his risen
[24:09] hands, Lord, we just ask you that that
[24:12] you answer their requests, Lord, that
[24:14] you come into their life and you make a
[24:15] real change in their life tonight. We
[24:16] pray in your name. Amen.
[24:28] [Music]
[24:32] I feel so much better now. so relieved
[24:34] and all these issues that I've had. It's
[24:36] like it disappeared and I feel I'm
[24:39] feeling so good. God is so good. My
[24:41] child, I am so proud of you. You have
[24:44] stepped out of the cage that you put
[24:47] yourself in under all that misery and
[24:50] pain and suffering. But I just want you
[24:52] to know that the Lord said unto Samuel,
[24:55] "Do not consider his appearance or his
[24:56] height, for I have rejected him." The
[24:58] Lord does not look on the things people
[25:00] look at. People look at the outward
[25:02] appearance, but the Lord looks at the
[25:04] heart. Amen. I'm so thankful, my child,
[25:07] that you are finally here in church and
[25:09] not out there with those men.
[25:18] God, hallelujah, God bless.
[25:28] [Music]
[25:34] I've been
[25:38] changed.

[25:45] seen
[25:48] delivered. No more
[25:53] chains. I'm free.
[25:57] My
[25:59] [Music]
[26:00] past is
[26:05] over. So right now is the
[26:09] moment. Today is the day I've been
[26:16] changed. I've been
[26:19] [Music]
[26:20] changed. I have waited for this moment
[26:25] to come. And I won't let it pass me
[26:34] by. I won't go back. I can't go back to
[26:40] the way it used to be before your
[26:45] presence came and changed
[26:49] me. I won't go back. I can't go back to
[26:55] the way it used to be before your
[27:00] presence came and changed
[27:05] me. I won't go back. I can't go back to
[27:10] the way it used to be before your
[27:15] presence came and changed me.
[27:21] I won't go back. I can't go back to the
[27:26] way it used to be before your presence
[27:31] came and changed me.
[27:35] Hallelujah. Amen. God bless.
[27:44] Team number one.
[27:47] Number two. Number two
[27:58] will be
[27:59] different from all the other

[29:35] are.

[30:10] All right,
[30:13] disperse and don't come back till you
[30:14] found the princess. Yes, Captain.
[30:16] Excellent.
[30:21] When we do, princess, we come to rescue
[30:23] you.
[30:25] Oh, Captain, thanks for coming. I've
[30:28] waited for so long. I know you have.
[30:31] Well, let's thank Val for saving me.
[30:33] Val, where have I heard that name
[30:35] before? It's not so familiar. Some guy
[30:36] at a party or something.
[30:39] Watch the co razors.
[30:42] Thou shalt have no other guys before me.
[30:46] Good work. You're not the princess.
[30:48] You're a a gentle.
[30:51] I'll get you next time.
[30:55] We're safe.
[31:00] Crewman, report.
[31:03] A bit of an added to that last order. Do
[31:04] not come back till you have found the
[31:06] real princess. Yes. Disperse.
[31:12] Dear princess, we've come to save you.
[31:14] Captain, please come. This is terrible.
[31:18] I'm the real princess. Please save. No,
[31:20] I'm the real princess. What are you
[31:21] talking about? I'm the real princess.
[31:24] Get over me.
[31:27] My spiral razor's wrapping up again.
[31:30] Thou shalt not bring false witness
[31:33] against thy neighbor.
[31:35] Whatever.
[31:41] Thou shalt not kill.
[31:45] Another day dog is nobody safe. We'll
[31:48] catch you next time.
[31:57] [Music]
[31:59] Yes, have any of you found the real
[32:02] princess yet? Go. Don't give up. Keep
[32:05] looking.
[32:07] Cuz like someone like already find me
[32:08] already like Thanks.
[32:11] I have come to save you, but it better
[32:13] be you this time. I dealt with enough
[32:14] fakes and quads today. Oh, captain.
[32:20] I'm so glad you found me. These stingots
[32:23] have been treating me so terribly. Could
[32:25] you get those towels over there for me,
[32:27] please? Now, honestly, you're a lot more
[32:29] masculine than I would have pictured or
[32:30] liked. Your own isn't exactly on point
[32:33] either, but being that that feminine
[32:35] voice is quite convincing, of course,
[32:36] I'll
[32:39] grab the erasers.
[32:42] Jonathan 912. Thou shall not take the
[32:46] towels. Wait a second. Wait a second.
[32:48] Wait a second. There is no Jonathan
[32:50] 9:12, let alone taking towels when I
[32:53] have my scriptal razors on, so I should
[32:55] be able to know the truth or not. I feel
[32:57] so confused. So lost.
[33:01] I don't know what to think anymore.
[33:03] Captain, Captain, I found the real
[33:04] princess. Wait a second. First of all,
[33:06] who are you? And wait a minute. You're
[33:09] the real
[33:10] princess. Who are you?
[33:12] [Music]
[33:14] We'll get you next time, Captain.
[33:19] Everything I've never including those
[33:22] glasses. Okay. So, wait. Who are you?
[33:26] No, seriously. I haven't seen you on my
[33:27] ship before, but could you help
[33:31] anytime you get to this?
[33:36] Oh, Captain, you saved me. Yeah, you and
[33:39] everybody else today. How can I ever
[33:42] repay you? Give me a godly based
[33:44] handshake. Get on the boat. We're going
[33:47] home. Yay. You're sleeping in a separate
[33:49] room.
[33:58] First John 4. Beloved, believe not every
[34:01] spirit, but try the spirits whether they
[34:03] are of God, because many false prophets
[34:06] are gone out into the world. Hereby know
[34:08] ye the spirit of God. Every spirit that
[34:10] confesses that Jesus Christ has come in
[34:12] the flesh is of God. And every spirit
[34:14] that confesses not that Jesus Christ has
[34:16] come in the flesh is not of God. And
[34:18] this is that spirit of an antichrist.
[34:20] Wherefore you have heard that it should
[34:21] come, and even now already it is in the
[34:23] world. Ye are of God, little children,
[34:25] and have overcome them. Because greater
[34:27] is he that is in you than he that is in
[34:29] the
[34:30] [Applause]
[34:48] Thank you for seeing the game.
[34:55] What did you say?
[35:29] Now we are welcome.
[35:36] [Music]
[35:44] [Music]
[35:45] Okay, let's give everybody a round of
[35:47] applause
[35:49] because
[35:51] really you guys are really um excellent.
[35:55] You know, the acting, the originality,
[35:59] um the uh content, the scripture,
[36:01] everything was really really good. Um
[36:04] but our judges are going to give the
[36:07] final ultimate count and um so that is
[36:11] going to take place over the next maybe
[36:14] half hour or so as they submit all of
[36:17] their
[36:18] um findings and then um we will bring
[36:23] you back in shortly because right now
[36:26] we're going to go to the outside for the
[36:29] watermelon eating contest.
[36:35] Okay. So, so, so here's here's the deal,
[36:38] okay? Here's the rules.
[36:41] Each team needs to choose three girls
[36:45] and three
[36:47] boys from each team.
[36:51] Okay. So
[36:53] decide out of your team which three boys
[36:56] and three girls will be your watermelon
[37:01] eating machines.
[37:17] Now, the way that the scoring is going
[37:19] to work, okay, just so you know, is
[37:22] there's going to be a total of 20
[37:27] points. Okay?
[37:29] Well, it it actually equals more than
[37:31] that, but this is how it works. Watch.
[37:34] The winning team will receive 20 points.
[37:39] The second team to finish will receive
[37:43] 15. The third team will receive 10 and
[37:48] the final team will receive five. Okay.
[37:52] So, it's you got to it's it's a it's a
[37:55] eat to the end. Okay. All right. Eat to
[37:59] the end. Once the third
[38:01] team is finished, then of course the
[38:04] fourth team, you can stop eating at that
[38:07] point. It's entirely up to you. If
[38:09] you're enjoying the melon, continue to
[38:11] eat. All right. Um, so is that clear?
[38:15] 20, 15, 10, and five. Okay. Now, the
[38:20] other thing
[38:21] is those that are going to be eating the
[38:24] watermelons are not allowed to use their
[38:26] hands.
[38:34] The three girls on each of the sides
[38:36] need to tie their hair to the back.
[38:40] Okay? So that it doesn't get into the
[38:43] watermelon. All
[38:45] right? And your hands are going to be
[38:48] behind your back.
[38:51] If you move your hands
[38:53] up, you will be
[38:55] disqualified. Okay? So, you cannot move
[38:59] your hands up. Now, what you got to do
[39:04] is if you kind of like knock your
[39:07] watermelon over, well, you're going to
[39:09] need to grab it by the edge with your
[39:11] teeth and straighten it out again. Now,
[39:14] hopefully it's not going to fall over
[39:15] because we're going to cut the slices in
[39:17] such a way that you will be able to, you
[39:21] know, eat properly and it shouldn't
[39:22] really fall over. So, you know, just
[39:25] take your time. but yet go really fast.
[39:28] Okay. And
[39:30] um the best team win. Does anybody have
[39:33] any questions?
[39:36] Yes. Any questions? No questions.
[39:42] Okay. Good. We are setting it up
[39:45] outside. Everybody head outside. All
[39:48] right. Thank you.
[39:56] Rachel, prepare.
[40:25] We have four guys.
[40:38] [Music]
[40:50] [Music]
[40:55] And one of the boys is American. So you
[40:57] got to go to four girls. No.
