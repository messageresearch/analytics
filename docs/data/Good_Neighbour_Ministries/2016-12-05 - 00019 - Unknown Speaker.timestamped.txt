[0:00] but
[0:00] [Music]
[0:01] they to the
[0:05] Seminary and out there they train you in
[0:09] all the various Sciences which I've
[0:12] outlined to you before esy
[0:16] horms pedagogy and this and that
[0:19] comparative religion a whole bunch of
[0:22] subject they start to train and all
[0:24] these things in the Greek and whatever
[0:27] and after they sure that you have now
[0:31] changed from just being a simple country
[0:34] boy into a refined elegant and
[0:38] persuasive
[0:40] speaker then they will certify ordain
[0:43] and calling to the
[0:46] ministry and when you call the ministry
[0:48] and you have your certifications from
[0:50] the organization then they will
[0:53] positionally place you in a parish or a
[0:56] church of their choosing
[1:00] God does the
[1:01] opposite God calls a man first when he's
[1:04] a partner with a STW in his mouth and a
[1:06] BL overalls arm amen he calls the man
[1:10] first right and then when he calls the
[1:12] man the guy learns of the
[1:16] job because sometimes the very people is
[1:18] preaching to criticize him right is that
[1:21] right also God allows the people to look
[1:24] at the minister and see the minister
[1:25] growing they're growing and the minister
[1:27] is growing and he's making his mistakes
[1:28] in front of them is that right right and
[1:31] that he's just a man like them and they
[1:34] see that while he is being
[1:36] trained Hallelujah and sometimes God
[1:39] makes the people deny him Titan offering
[1:41] so that he can go hungry
[1:45] sometimes and people telling him you
[1:47] don't need to to have a car you need to
[1:49] ride a
[1:51] [Music]
[1:53] bicycle sounds funny but it's the
[1:57] truth CU I know I've Been Told
[2:00] why you the car the bicycle you to be
[2:03] poor and humble so God continue to use
[2:05] you just stay right
[2:09] there of
[2:12] course that's not things that a general
[2:14] will hold against people you know
[2:16] they're saying that out of ignorance and
[2:17] blindness they don't know the word and
[2:20] they being inspired to talk like that
[2:22] but I'm saying it to you for your uh to
[2:26] teach you something amen praise the Lord
[2:28] and I'm a living example
[2:30] I'm not quoting from some post Master's
[2:33] quotebook quoting from the
[2:36] book book of experience or the book of
[2:39] human
[2:43] life say Amen praise the Lord but this
[2:46] is what happens God trains the man I've
[2:49] been in the church where people wants to
[2:51] live the church and instead of leaving
[2:53] peacefully they're up to me and their
[2:55] nose is touching my nose and they're
[2:57] speaking on the spittle and everything
[3:00] and I stand right there said yes sir yes
[3:02] brother I understand what God knows how
[3:06] to break you down and make you like a
[3:08] sheep I was born in under the sign of
[3:11] AUST where I supposed to be a lion
[3:18] king but instead God knows how to break
[3:22] you and mold you and shape you until you
[3:25] become like Mary's little
[3:28] lamb amen praise the Lord glory to God
[3:32] and that's what God does he trains you
[3:34] right on the job
[3:37] amen and you're in the
[3:40] ministry you're
[3:42] called You're
[3:44] trained and even though you are
[3:47] trained uh you know you say oh being
[3:51] trained being in the ministry you guys
[3:52] are already sent no that guy is not sent
[3:55] until that Ministry is
[3:57] matur and then the Holy Spirit
[4:00] says now you go out there amen and I'm
[4:04] going to be with you you don't have to
[4:06] say anything because when they attack
[4:07] you they're not attacking you it's me
[4:10] cuz now I got control of you amen now I
[4:13] I'm controlling the whole SE praise the
[4:15] lord it's like the first second P
[4:17] brother Brandon was operating those
[4:18] first two but when it comes to the third
[4:20] he said oh no this is got nothing to do
[4:22] with you when you sympathize with people
[4:24] or anything else like that because start
[4:27] going right to the soul amen and that's
[4:29] the revealed word amen is that right
[4:31] praise God hallelujah and you can't give
[4:34] them no
[4:35] Revelation you can only speak the word
[4:37] but you can't give them any Revelation
[4:39] I'm the one that will interpret my own
[4:41] word you be standing there and they
[4:44] still see the figure of Willam but it
[4:46] will be the voice of God these last days
[4:49] the voice of the sign how happy that we
[4:52] are under that kind of inspiration and
[4:55] we are speaking and living under the
[4:57] influence of another
[4:59] so you see I repeat the prophet wants to
[5:03] make sure we learn this principle God
[5:07] takes the simple things to identify
[5:10] himself through is that right amen what
[5:13] if you were to paint a white a cream
[5:16] painting on this beautiful wall here
[5:20] what are you going to see it's not going
[5:22] to really stand out but when God wants
[5:26] people the people to see him sometimes
[5:29] he'll make you even look
[5:31] bad he'll make you look dumb he'll make
[5:34] you look foolish he'll even allow people
[5:36] to persecute you so that they can see
[5:39] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[5:43] and all those virtues in
[5:45] you man no human being can stand there
[5:49] and take that that's
[5:51] impossible if it was me like one
[5:54] Pentecostal Minister told me I give him
[5:55] my right and I left and I thr it in the
[5:57] ditch
[6:03] that's a natural human reaction but
[6:05] after a while people recognize that just
[6:07] that's not
[6:08] natural praise the
[6:10] Lord after watching one of our sisters
[6:12] in here for a long while a woman walked
[6:16] up to her said are you a
[6:18] Christian never witnessed to the person
[6:21] never spoke to the person never really
[6:23] tell are you a
[6:24] Christian okay just smiled at the
[6:26] question the first time I didn't answer
[6:28] but then they go around in another long
[6:31] Circle and another day comes back and
[6:33] you got to be a Christian now they were
[6:34] certain than you they're preaching to
[6:36] you now you got to be a Christian in
[6:39] other words you can't act and live like
[6:40] that and not be a Christian you have to
[6:42] be one and then they finally give him
[6:45] their testimony praise the Lord you see
[6:47] you are the voice of God in these last
[6:49] days am you are the Living Word you are
[6:54] here to interpret the meaning of what
[6:56] love is what Grace is what patience is
[6:58] and so on and SW so you the living

[9:27] 3,000 people coming under a bunch of
[9:30] trees they don't have a building but
[9:32] they walk for a whole week because they

[10:15] you know good
[10:19] smell keep
[10:29] I'm going to
[10:30] be like this teing
[10:33] tonight it's just going to keep going
[10:37] let's Hallelujah brother come
[10:41] here take up your cross and follow Jesus
[10:44] Hallelujah as we ease our way into this

[10:51] Christ not the spirit of commercialism
[10:54] Amen is that right amen where we keep
[10:57] our eyes on the word we know the truth
[11:00] of what this is all about and we are
[11:03] happy at this time of peace and joy in
[11:06] the presence of the Lord
[11:09] hallelujah and they're going to be
[11:10] eating and drinking and we'll be eating
[11:12] and drinking but we rejoicing at
[11:14] something totally than what they're
[11:16] rejoicing over and as long as you can
[11:18] have that line of demarcation you'll be
[11:22] fine I realize as I'm closing to repeat
[11:26] myself it's a time when you may get
[11:29] opposition because the things you used
[11:31] to do you don't do them no more the
[11:34] friends you used to have you don't have
[11:35] them no more places you used to go you
[11:38] don't go there no more you may have some
[11:41] opposition but even in those
[11:45] opposition there's a seeds of
[11:47] opportunity for you to be able to share
[11:51] the testimony that God has placed in
[11:53] your heart God richly bless you let us
[11:55] pray
