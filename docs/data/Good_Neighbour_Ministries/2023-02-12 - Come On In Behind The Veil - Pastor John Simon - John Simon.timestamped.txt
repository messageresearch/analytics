[42:28] if we don't have him or if we Gather in
[42:33] here right we can work ourselves up into
[42:36] emotion that's not the Holy Spirit work
[42:39] yourself into a sensation that's not the
[42:42] Holy Spirit
[42:43] uh if we can be here by the thousands
[42:46] but if he is not here
[42:49] we are just like a lodge
[42:52] just a gathering of people that doesn't
[42:55] mean a thing in the sight of God
[42:58] what he he we want is his presence yes
[43:02] we want the greater than Solomon to walk
[43:05] among the lilies
[43:07] and have the aroma the smell of the
[43:10] lives that were produced by the blood of
[43:13] Christ
[43:14] that's what we are here for I pray that
[43:18] he will draw near and anoint the word of
[43:21] God Amen praise God let's go to the word
[43:24] amen
[43:25] uh Exodus 35 it's before you
[43:29] and Moses
[43:32] gathered all the congregation that's
[43:35] from verse one let me get to verse four
[43:38] and Moses spake unto all the
[43:42] congregation
[43:44] of the children of Israel saying this is
[43:48] the thing which the Lord commanded
[43:51] saying
[43:52] take ye from among you and offering unto
[43:57] the Lord
[43:58] whosoever is of a willing heart
[44:01] right
[44:03] let him bring it an offering of the Lord
[44:09] gold
[44:11] silver and brass
[44:13] and blue and purple and Scarlet and fine
[44:18] linen and goats here and Ram's skin dyed
[44:22] red and Badger skins and him wood
[44:27] and oil for the light spices for
[44:29] anointing oil and for this sweet incense
[44:32] and oink stones and stones to be set for
[44:36] the ephod and for the breastplate and
[44:40] every
[44:41] wise-hearted among you shall come
[44:45] and make all that the Lord had commanded
[44:50] amen praise the Lord God bless his word
[44:53] Our Father we thank you for this the
[44:56] reading of the word we pray for every
[44:59] heart here and father we bind Satan
[45:03] and his activity we we arrest his uh
[45:09] evil suggestive thoughts
[45:12] the Lord that he tries to inspire we
[45:17] bind every movement of his
[45:20] uh oh God let the Holy Spirit take
[45:23] control now to thy glory and for thy
[45:26] honor amen God bless you please be
[45:28] seated
[45:34] God is saying that if you're coming with
[45:36] an offering come with your willing heart
[45:39] uh you have got to give it willingly
[45:41] right uh because it's not just the size
[45:44] of the offering or whatever that you're
[45:46] bringing or or whether it's a penny like
[45:50] the widow or or thousands of dollars
[45:52] like the Pharisee and the sad you see
[45:55] but it is the motive and it is the
[45:59] what's in the heart is what he is
[46:02] looking at right I think there's a
[46:04] saying a common thing it's not really
[46:07] the gift but it's it's what's in the
[46:10] person's Hearts that's giving me the
[46:12] gift well it's the same way with God
[46:15] it's not really the gift right but it's
[46:19] what God can see in the heart of the
[46:21] individual that is giving the gift that
[46:25] that's why it ends by saying so let them
[46:28] that are wise-hearted let them come and
[46:31] let them give this offering unto the
[46:35] Lord so God asks us to offer uh to him
[46:39] The Ultimate Gift which is the gift of
[46:42] our own hearts
[46:43] The Ultimate Gift of ourselves to give
[46:47] that to him that he might use that for
[46:50] his glory and for his honor praise the
[46:55] Lord last week we spoke about the
[46:57] unveiling of God God being unveiled and
[47:02] we touched on it in the this way first
[47:05] of all not the unveiling of the head of
[47:10] the body
[47:11] but the unveiling of the body itself
[47:15] right for Jesus we know is the head of
[47:19] the church the head of the body the
[47:23] bride or the wife is actually the church
[47:26] itself and that that as Eve was in Adam
[47:31] until God took her out we were in Christ
[47:35] is that right we were in Christ until he
[47:40] we were separated not to preacher touch
[47:44] on that again but just to bring you
[47:46] aware that I was talking about the
[47:49] lifting of the veil from off of the
[47:53] Bride God's Masterpiece God's great work
[47:58] of art that was covered up with a with a
[48:02] veil upon it the hour has come for God
[48:06] the Holy Spirit to lift the veil off and
[48:10] bring her are into public view that all
[48:14] might begin to recognize that there's
[48:16] something about this woman that's
[48:20] different amen the way she is different
[48:23] there's something in our heart makes her
[48:26] different amen so God lifted the veil as
[48:32] it was in the East that when there was a
[48:35] wedding
[48:36] the bride would have the veil on I
[48:39] believe it's the same in China I believe
[48:41] it's the same in India and some of the
[48:43] Asian countries they're covered with a
[48:45] veil and then the lifting of The Veil
[48:49] The bridegroom lifts that Veil and her
[48:53] face and features everything comes into
[48:55] Plain View God has and is doing the very
[49:00] same thing in this hour lifting the veil
[49:04] from off of
[49:06] various individuals elected of course by
[49:10] him that's wonderful and we praise him
[49:14] for that and we want to talk along those
[49:18] lines not on the same approach but we
[49:21] won't want to talk about the veil of the
[49:25] temple the old temple veil and that old
[49:30] temple veil as the scripture tells us he
[49:33] was telling them make that veil of of
[49:37] ram skins dyed red type of Christ and
[49:41] the suffering that he was to follow and
[49:44] then he says and along with the ramskin
[49:48] use Badgers skins
[49:51] and with the badger skins and the ram
[49:56] skin make that Veil oh praise God I'm so
[50:01] thankful that we have a veil like that
[50:05] mentioned here in the Bible listen out
[50:09] of the wonderful this wonderful message
[50:11] and I'm speaking about because it's an
[50:14] invitation here today
[50:17] as an invitation to every person in the
[50:21] building here today
[50:23] calling you to come in behind the veil
[50:29] to come in to his presence
[50:33] that the Holy Spirit of almighty God may
[50:36] take his own word that you might have
[50:39] heard for years and make the word live
[50:43] make the world real to you until you can
[50:47] see him in his fullness of his glory the
[50:51] resurrected Christ now living
[50:54] forevermore in our midst to God be the
[50:58] glory listen here God speaking in the
[51:02] Old Testament
[51:04] there were Badger skins and the badger
[51:08] Skins are the veil in God because you
[51:12] know how the temple was the outer Court
[51:14] the inner Court the holy of holies and
[51:18] how that the holy of holies had a veil
[51:21] that was there amen and no one could go
[51:26] Beyond the Veil except they priests amen
[51:31] could go behind that Veil and the high
[51:35] priest could only go behind there when
[51:39] the purifier God wanted to speak amen
[51:42] yes so the veil had a great importance
[51:46] because behind that veil was the pillar
[51:50] of Fire
[51:52] and you cannot go into the presence of
[51:55] the pillar of fire without a Divine
[51:57] invitation everybody wants the Holy
[52:00] Ghost everybody wants the power of God
[52:03] everybody wants the presence of God but
[52:06] you cannot come into that atmosphere and
[52:10] presence of the Living God without his
[52:13] personal Divine invitation
[52:15] you don't walk in the presence of a king
[52:18] or even an Earthly royalty without
[52:21] invitation you are invited to come
[52:25] behind the veil in the presence of God
[52:29] to have a conference with God where God
[52:32] can speak to you his word and then he
[52:35] interprets his own word he tells you
[52:38] about himself he makes the world clear
[52:41] to you amen you may understand it but
[52:45] now the author of the book is speaking
[52:47] to you himself and he is making the book
[52:50] clear that you might recognize what you
[52:53] saw what you heard what you heard quoted
[52:56] repeated or whatever to you now you
[52:59] begin to see now you begin to recognize
[53:02] the word of God for this day and for
[53:05] this hour amen yes sir see there it was
[53:09] so the pillar of fire was hid behind the
[53:13] veil
[53:14] and this is the invitation you are
[53:17] receiving not to stay outside the veil
[53:21] see the the glow of Pentecost the
[53:25] Afterglow you know you can put up a a
[53:29] veil but if there is a flame or a light
[53:32] behind the veil the light will just
[53:35] you'll see parts of it on the outside
[53:37] but the center and the power and the
[53:40] presence of that great light you will
[53:42] not see and this is what happens to a
[53:46] lot of people they are seeing the the
[53:48] glow but they're on the glare but they
[53:50] haven't caught the fullness of the
[53:53] presence of almighty God in his word and
[53:56] in his people amen now notice that Mo
[54:01] the word was in Moses and he was a
[54:05] prophet you see but he met the pillar of
[54:08] Fire
[54:10] it was God come down now to identify
[54:13] Moses
[54:15] by bringing him into that Pillar of Fire
[54:20] amen praise God and then veiling him
[54:25] praise God forevermore see God wants to
[54:29] bring us into the pillar of fire oh
[54:32] praise God and then you Avail to praise
[54:36] God oh praise His name no one else could
[54:40] go in
[54:41] not any person could now try to
[54:44] impersonate that at that time amen they
[54:49] could not do it and if they tried to do
[54:52] it they'll die with the rest Amen in
[54:55] other words you'll die just like the
[54:56] unbelievers you'll die like those who
[54:58] died in the other Church ages that that
[55:00] at the at the manner and drunk the water
[55:04] and then their bones were left in the
[55:06] wilderness not because they were not
[55:08] so-called Christians or Jews but because
[55:11] they did not recognize the fullness of
[55:14] what God was doing in their day and in
[55:17] their hour amen yes sir oh my now think
[55:21] of it
[55:22] one man went in behind there praise God
[55:27] because he's a type of the elected seed
[55:29] of God you believe that praise God oh my
[55:33] went in behind there right into that
[55:37] Pillar of Fire he walked right into the
[55:40] glory of God and into that Shekinah
[55:45] Glory and when he came out with the word
[55:48] for that age he was now shining with the
[55:53] glory of God till he had to Veil his
[55:57] face
[55:58] oh my and remember that was only the
[56:03] natural veil in other words what will
[56:06] happen to the spiritually left in this
[56:09] day in this hour when they walk into the
[56:13] presence of God like that praise the
[56:15] Lord oh praise God I want to tell you
[56:19] that I believe somehow some way I have
[56:23] walked into that realm I believe I have
[56:26] walked into the presence of God and into
[56:30] the purifier I believe somehow he has
[56:33] enabled me not just me but his unable
[56:36] some of you who have seen and believed
[56:39] that you have walked into though we were
[56:42] not conscious of it but that's what

[56:48] great Pillar of Fire praise the Living
[56:50] God hallelujah amen and now see when a
[56:56] man or a woman breaks through through
[56:59] that Veil into this Shekinah Glory of

[1:05:15] within you then when that happens you're
[1:05:19] awakened to the Shekinah Glory of the
[1:05:22] Living God then the Bible now becomes a
[1:05:27] new book together to you amen hallelujah
[1:05:32] the Bible becomes a new book because you
[1:05:35] are seeing what though you're reading
[1:05:37] between the lines you recognize what God
[1:05:40] is trying to tell you
[1:05:41] amen everybody can read the Bible
[1:05:46] anybody can read a letter I write to my
[1:05:48] wife
[1:05:49] but when she reads that she gonna read
[1:05:52] the parts that I can't write down
[1:05:56] because she is going to say oh my I can
[1:05:59] see him now while you're right in that
[1:06:01] thing he must be sitting in this desk by
[1:06:04] that chair and writing this thing and
[1:06:06] Bible open on one side and right in
[1:06:09] there and maybe you have a smile on his
[1:06:12] face those things are not like written
[1:06:14] down on the paper and that is what I'm
[1:06:17] trying to tell you God is now speaking
[1:06:20] to his beloved elected bride amen and he
[1:06:25] is talking to her and talking between
[1:06:27] these lines that you got written here
[1:06:30] it's important we read this we
[1:06:32] understand it but this is good but this
[1:06:35] is not the fullness of it he is letting
[1:06:38] you now come into His Thoughts of what
[1:06:42] he's thinking while he was writing this
[1:06:45] amen he wants you to bring you into his
[1:06:48] so that we can say we have the mind of
[1:06:51] Christ because we have entered in behind
[1:06:54] the veil where the glow Glory never
[1:06:57] fails we are sitting in the presence of
[1:06:59] the Lamb amen hallelujah oh my then you
[1:07:04] see you realize that Jesus Christ is the
[1:07:07] same yesterday
[1:07:09] same today
[1:07:11] but not in Jesus in you he is the same
[1:07:16] today praise God and will be so forever
[1:07:21] praise the Lord because what we are all
[1:07:25] priests and we can go into his presence
[1:07:28] royal priesthood is that right the Bible
[1:07:31] tells us that we are prison Kings to God
[1:07:34] we are of the royal priesthood we are
[1:07:37] priests after the order of Melchizedek
[1:07:40] praise the Lord because we are
[1:07:42] undergoing the same change from TF from
[1:07:45] from this body to glory amen Melchizedek
[1:07:49] came from glory to a human body now we
[1:07:52] are reversing changing back the other
[1:07:54] way we come from God we're going back to
[1:07:57] God we have been changed back by the
[1:08:00] glory of the power of the pillar of fire
[1:08:02] back into your keaphonic state where we
[1:08:05] can radiate the presence of the Living
[1:08:08] God from all your life that that's why
[1:08:10] those Apostles could just passed the SEC
[1:08:13] and some of them get healed because it
[1:08:15] was not them it was the presence of the
[1:08:18] Living God that was in them making
[1:08:20] themselves manifest not human effort oh
[1:08:23] I prayed for 21 days
[1:08:26] I fasted and I prayed and that's why the
[1:08:31] sick are getting healed no no no no no
[1:08:32] no no
[1:08:34] no that's good if you do that you're
[1:08:35] just making yourself Sanctified and
[1:08:38] prepared to be used as a vessel but any
[1:08:42] natural doctor will tell you are any
[1:08:44] good one I can't heal I can only cut and
[1:08:47] sow and give you the medicine and then I
[1:08:50] said let's nature take its course God
[1:08:53] has to do the healing God has to do the
[1:08:56] deliverance and so the real True
[1:08:59] Believer comes to a place of rest where
[1:09:02] they realize I can do nothing
[1:09:05] I can do nothing it reminds me all Bill
[1:09:09] Anderson wrote that song I only held a
[1:09:12] pencil but he wrote the song I can do
[1:09:15] nothing alone you can do nothing alone
[1:09:19] we can do nothing alone without him we
[1:09:23] are nothing we come from nothing and
[1:09:25] we're going back to nothing you come
[1:09:27] from the dirt and you're going back to
[1:09:29] the church oh praise God forevermore but
[1:09:32] thank God Satan will not keep the youth
[1:09:35] the real elect of God down in the dust
[1:09:38] and the dirt of some grave where we try
[1:09:40] to bury you because he is resurrecting
[1:09:43] his body wherever it is he resurrected
[1:09:47] that one and this one has going to have
[1:09:49] a sure Resurrection because I live you
[1:09:53] will live you've got to live if you
[1:09:55] identified in him you can't miss it
[1:09:57] praise God glory to God glory to his
[1:10:01] wonderful name oh A peculiar holy people
[1:10:05] giving what spiritual sacrifices to God
[1:10:09] hallelujah amen oh but for that you must
[1:10:14] really come in here you must get behind
[1:10:18] this Veil to see the unveiling of God
[1:10:23] hallelujah to see God right before you
[1:10:26] amen you must see him and that unveiled
[1:10:31] God unveiled that is his word now made
[1:10:35] manifest to you amen the word making
[1:10:38] itself manifest or the word unveiled to
[1:10:42] you amen praise God hallelujah yes sir
[1:10:46] remember old Solomon how many remembers
[1:10:49] who Solomon is
[1:10:51] how many remembers who Solomon is
[1:10:53] everybody knows him because he was the
[1:10:56] claimed to be the richest man of the
[1:10:58] world at that time so of course we know
[1:11:00] the richest man really was Adam because
[1:11:03] God gave the whole world to him and Eve
[1:11:06] and
[1:11:07] um yes for natural man's sake
[1:11:11] um they say Solomon but really Adam God
[1:11:13] says all of it is yours all the gold all
[1:11:16] the diamonds everything is yours
[1:11:17] whatever you say that's what's going to
[1:11:19] be that's the real riches praise the
[1:11:22] Lord but you see Solomon when he
[1:11:25] dedicated the Temple of the Lord these
[1:11:28] Badger skins were hanging there the veil
[1:11:32] amen oh my and then he came in behind
[1:11:37] that Veil as a pillar of Fire
[1:11:40] and as of a cloud
[1:11:43] praise God you see there's sermons right
[1:11:46] in there because the word becomes cloudy
[1:11:49] they're looking at the real thing but
[1:11:50] it's cloudy they they can't see anything
[1:11:52] it's like smoke they can't see anything
[1:11:55] but to to the elected of God it becomes
[1:11:59] a pillar of fire that makes everything
[1:12:01] clear amen hallelujah now see it went
[1:12:06] down behind there and it veiled he
[1:12:09] veiled himself back there from the
[1:12:12] outside world Hallelujah but by fact the
[1:12:18] believing of Israel knew that he was
[1:12:21] back there that in other words you don't
[1:12:24] have to see him with your eyes because
[1:12:26] you know who he is and he's revealed
[1:12:28] himself to you you recognize them and
[1:12:31] you know who is back there and now you
[1:12:33] see the Discerning of the Lord's body
[1:12:35] where you can recognize you know who is
[1:12:38] back there you talk with individual walk
[1:12:41] with individual and in fact five minutes
[1:12:44] he says you'll recognize oh my what's
[1:12:48] back of that Veil what's behind that
[1:12:51] batch of skin what's hiding behind there
[1:12:53] never mind the religious works the
[1:12:56] religious formality uh the religious
[1:12:59] acts that we may put on because there's
[1:13:02] a tactical kind of Christianity where
[1:13:05] people live by religious drama
[1:13:08] the Bible say I have to wear my dress
[1:13:10] long
[1:13:11] so I I obeying the Bible I'm walking in
[1:13:13] obedience that's not walking in
[1:13:15] obedience you're just doing that because
[1:13:18] you read it because it wasn't revealed
[1:13:21] to you amen that's a different standard
[1:13:23] reveal to you by God himself the word
[1:13:26] amen but we don't go off on that area
[1:13:29] praise the Lord hallelujah so he veiled
[1:13:33] himself from the outside world now you
[1:13:36] can be talking and believing in God in
[1:13:38] the spirit and Revelation and the word
[1:13:41] coming forth and you are the very Veil
[1:13:45] and the Holy Spirit the pillar fire
[1:13:49] veiled in you
[1:13:51] and they can recognize it say something
[1:13:54] strange about that guy that woman
[1:13:56] something is funny right they know
[1:13:59] something is going on but they don't
[1:14:02] know how to describe it or how to
[1:14:04] recognize what is really happening and
[1:14:07] all it is is God behind the veil
[1:14:11] and you don't care regardless of how
[1:14:15] many Hidden Worlds what they have to say
[1:14:19] now I'm friend he is hid from the
[1:14:22] unbeliever but the Believer by faith
[1:14:25] knows that he is back there praise God
[1:14:28] do you believe her by faith we know who
[1:14:31] is back there praise God hallelujah yes
[1:14:35] sir they know it because they already
[1:14:38] have mercy
[1:14:40] do you have mercy
[1:14:42] do you have mercy have you met with the
[1:14:45] God who is rich in Mercy oh praise God
[1:14:49] if you met the god of Heaven who is rich
[1:14:52] in Mercy then you have mercy amen and
[1:14:57] that's why they can be back there and
[1:15:00] know that the mercy seat that was back
[1:15:04] there in that that Temple is now here in
[1:15:07] the Earthly temples God sitting between
[1:15:11] the wings of the cherubim all the New
[1:15:14] Testament God reflected himself by the
[1:15:18] power of his word and inspiration of the
[1:15:21] Holy Spirit hallelujah oh my and back
[1:15:24] you see even then it was a great Secret
[1:15:29] and still it's a mystery it's a great
[1:15:31] secret even now hallelujah oh how
[1:15:35] wonderful this is that back in the Old
[1:15:38] Testament
[1:15:39] for anybody to attempt to go behind that
[1:15:42] veil was death
[1:15:45] there was instantly be struck down then
[1:15:48] the law behind that Veil that is why the
[1:15:52] high priest the priests or the high
[1:15:54] priests they always have to have bells
[1:15:57] around their ankles
[1:15:59] so that they can know their life when
[1:16:01] they're behind that Veil right they're
[1:16:03] still alive when it goes quiet and then
[1:16:06] I hear no movement they also had a cord
[1:16:09] a scarlet cord tied on their leg one of
[1:16:13] their feet so that when it gets
[1:16:15] completely quiet they're not hearing any
[1:16:17] noise they know well you must you know
[1:16:19] he's dead God struck him down for
[1:16:22] something or the other and then they
[1:16:24] will pull that cord they ain't going in
[1:16:26] nobody's going in there with stretcher
[1:16:28] and what not to try to bring them out
[1:16:30] they pull the cord in the sand until his
[1:16:34] body comes out before they could handle
[1:16:36] him oh you see that's the way it was
[1:16:39] where is God so anybody that went in
[1:16:43] there it was dead Amen to enter into
[1:16:47] that Glory was death if they were to do
[1:16:50] that hallelujah amen yes sir but what
[1:16:54] happened
[1:16:55] now to stay away from going into that
[1:16:59] glory is death amen it's changed he said
[1:17:03] this it's all changed the cycle just
[1:17:06] went around and now not to go in there
[1:17:09] comes death
[1:17:10] back then to stay away from it was was
[1:17:13] to go in there was death now my friends
[1:17:16] I tell you we are I want to bring your
[1:17:20] attention back to the world my mind is
[1:17:22] running uh like this so let me slow down
[1:17:24] praise the Lord God now we see of course
[1:17:28] think of the renting of the veil of
[1:17:32] badger skins at at uh in the temple when
[1:17:36] Jesus died
[1:17:38] that is what it was when they pierced
[1:17:42] his side and they tore him
[1:17:46] he was the human Badger skin that was
[1:17:50] the covering for God to hide and to
[1:17:53] manifest through through it so it was
[1:17:57] symbolized by the temple veil so when he
[1:18:01] got pierced when he got nailed right
[1:18:04] there the lightning of the angels from
[1:18:06] God come with a sword and tore the veil
[1:18:10] from top to bottom the height of the
[1:18:12] veil I believe was 21 feet amen so an
[1:18:16] ordinary man couldn't rip that Veil and
[1:18:18] it was about six inches thick so you can
[1:18:22] take your hand and like like we haven't
[1:18:24] tear the veil so it had to be the angel
[1:18:27] of God ripped the veil from top to
[1:18:31] bottom Hallelujah this body ripped out
[1:18:34] there and this one ripped that the
[1:18:37] symbolism was ripped and then the type
[1:18:40] the reality of it on the scene on the
[1:18:43] outside made known to the people amen
[1:18:45] and see oh praise God that was the veil
[1:18:50] was read the old Veil now to stay out of
[1:18:54] his presence for the veil is now rent
[1:18:57] and open then you must enter into his
[1:19:01] presence or death amen see it changes
[1:19:06] back and forth like that praise God and
[1:19:09] so you must watch the scripture to see
[1:19:12] the day that we are now living in when
[1:19:15] in other words recognize your day and
[1:19:17] your hour your hour might be outside of
[1:19:20] that and and you're fussing and fighting
[1:19:22] with that when you shoot your efforts
[1:19:25] should be within the veil where the
[1:19:27] glories never fail where your life
[1:19:30] you're living in the presence of the
[1:19:32] Lamb you praise God hallelujah think of
[1:19:35] it
[1:19:37] many years
[1:19:40] they were taking blood year after year
[1:19:45] sanctification for the cleansing of the
[1:19:48] sanctuary
[1:19:49] see there was sprinkling blood around
[1:19:52] the seat amen asking for forgiveness and
[1:19:57] running to altars and all of that oh my
[1:20:00] but now we find god with a mighty stroke
[1:20:04] of lightning struck that Veil and split
[1:20:08] the oil that that revealed from top to
[1:20:11] bottom and The Mercy Seat came into
[1:20:14] Plain View amen praise God hallelujah
[1:20:18] you may listen to the world like this
[1:20:21] and in a moment while I'm yet speaking
[1:20:23] the Holy Spirit comes with the sword of
[1:20:26] the word of God Hebrews 4 12 and smites
[1:20:30] that Veil Let's cross your mind
[1:20:31] hallelujah amen you see you're being
[1:20:35] invited to come to the inner Veil come
[1:20:39] into the inner Veil inside the veil
[1:20:41] where the glories never fail and to live
[1:20:45] in the presence of the Living God
[1:20:46] hallelujah amen yes sir the real genuine
[1:20:51] lamb is now come into Plain View not
[1:20:56] just the written words of the Bible but
[1:20:59] the real Lamb of God has now come into
[1:21:03] plain view to the elected Believers of
[1:21:06] the Living God because God had paid the
[1:21:09] price
[1:21:09] he was now the real Mercy Seat
[1:21:13] he had not come down and become one of
[1:21:16] us do you believe that
[1:21:18] the Bible says he come down that he
[1:21:20] might be tempted tested and tried with
[1:21:23] every Temptation coming to man and not
[1:21:26] fail in one single one to show you that
[1:21:29] by his grace you can do it too
[1:21:32] and even if you fail if you make
[1:21:35] mistakes if you stumble by the way he
[1:21:38] says my blood already paid the sacrifice
[1:21:40] paid the price for you amen oh praise
[1:21:45] God if you sin you have an advocate with
[1:21:48] the father his name is Jesus Christ the
[1:21:51] righteous amen yet you're without sin
[1:21:54] without any condemnation oh you're more
[1:21:58] than conquerors in him because your sins
[1:22:01] have been abducted into the bleach blood
[1:22:03] of Christ I don't care how much your
[1:22:06] life get messed up I don't care how that
[1:22:09] dress that that pants that shirt that
[1:22:12] cap or whatever got so messed up with
[1:22:15] filled with the dirt of the world if you
[1:22:18] get some good bleach and you put that
[1:22:21] thing in the bleach blood of Jesus
[1:22:23] Christ your Bible said it will cleanse
[1:22:25] your white or snow Hallelujah make you
[1:22:29] clean in the presence of the Living God
[1:22:31] Amen yes sir that's what we are here for
[1:22:34] not you cleaning yourselves but the
[1:22:36] blood of Jesus cleanses us and there's
[1:22:39] still Power in the Blood I said there's
[1:22:42] still Power in the Blood the power of
[1:22:45] the blood will cleanse you and make you
[1:22:47] completely clean where you are what
[1:22:50] justify
[1:22:53] by the grace of God hallelujah just as
[1:22:58] if you're never even sinned or made a
[1:23:01] mistake in the first place isn't that
[1:23:03] wonderful you know you go to a court and
[1:23:05] the judge say your pardoned it means yes
[1:23:07] he was guilty but I'm going to let you
[1:23:10] go off but this is not the case God is
[1:23:13] saying when I clean you you are
[1:23:16] Justified you as if you never made a
[1:23:19] mistake or sin in your life because I'm
[1:23:21] the one doing the cleansing now not only
[1:23:25] are you forgiven that you're Justified
[1:23:27] you've been clean completely praise in
[1:23:30] this presence I'm so glad see I'm
[1:23:32] Justified raise your hands say I'm
[1:23:34] Justified
[1:23:36] see I'm Justified
[1:23:38] I'm Justified oh praise God forever Oh
[1:23:42] What a Feeling oh what a reality that
[1:23:45] you are justified by the grace of the
[1:23:48] Living God hallelujah yes sir o praise
[1:23:51] God it's wonderful to know that this
[1:23:55] real genuine lamb paid the price on The
[1:23:58] Mercy Seat come into Plain View on the
[1:24:02] day of atonement something else you can
[1:24:05] touch on right there because the word
[1:24:07] atonement means coming back into act one
[1:24:10] minute right at one minute we come back
[1:24:14] to where we can come one back with God
[1:24:17] and say I and my father are one amen who
[1:24:22] praise God Amen but you see the people
[1:24:26] are blinded by Church Traditions back
[1:24:29] there
[1:24:30] and they may preach about the Jews and
[1:24:33] the Sadducees The Libertines and the
[1:24:35] Epicurean stoics and so on how they were
[1:24:38] blinded by Traditions back there not
[1:24:42] realizing they are blinded by Church
[1:24:45] modern Church Creeds dogmas systems of
[1:24:49] man made from the uh the minds of men
[1:24:53] smart men but that's not the word the
[1:24:56] will the way of God that he has in his
[1:24:58] plan amen so God is calling us back to
[1:25:01] the word
[1:25:02] to your original word
[1:25:05] not just to the written word but the
[1:25:08] unwritten word of God hallelujah amen
[1:25:11] what am I talking about there before a
[1:25:14] word is spoken the word is in your
[1:25:16] thoughts well it's in your thoughts it's
[1:25:18] not written yet and if you want to
[1:25:20] really go back to the original word you
[1:25:23] don't go back to the one that's already
[1:25:25] typed out and written here we had
[1:25:28] meetings last week and then we had uh
[1:25:31] presented on my desk there her precious
[1:25:33] sister was so gracious to take notes and
[1:25:36] we have that there but that's wonderful
[1:25:39] it's that's different from your actually
[1:25:42] being in the meeting hearing the words
[1:25:44] The Voice the emotions the inflections
[1:25:47] and so on that goes along with it and
[1:25:49] that's what God is saying you're you're
[1:25:51] blessed you're wonderful you have this
[1:25:53] it's good you need to continue to do
[1:25:55] this until you break into that but you
[1:25:57] must recognize I want you to go beyond
[1:26:00] and come into His divine presence praise
[1:26:04] the name of the Lord Glory Days
[1:26:05] wonderful name to think of it that God
[1:26:09] has brought them to this place amen so
[1:26:12] the Bible tells us that to this day for
[1:26:15] the Jews a veil is still upon their
[1:26:18] hearts
[1:26:19] that's one of the that's the veil you
[1:26:22] have to think about that that Veil over
[1:26:25] your heart could be a tradition
[1:26:27] it could be you were the member of a
[1:26:30] certain church and my father was a
[1:26:32] member of this church I was a this I was
[1:26:34] a lot I was a Pentecostal I was Baptist
[1:26:37] I was this and that becomes your Veil
[1:26:40] yeah it's veiling you from the rest of
[1:26:43] the truth the rest of the word because
[1:26:46] you're now living your life within those
[1:26:49] confines of that so-called Faith uh
[1:26:54] circumcised or ascribed by man they draw
[1:26:58] a circle and tell you this is this is so
[1:27:01] and so Circle this is a Baptist Circle
[1:27:02] you need to move him this is the Sun so
[1:27:04] circling me to move him and God says no
[1:27:06] I draw a circle above around all of them
[1:27:09] and you don't have to be in any of that
[1:27:12] you just walk where I tell you to walk
[1:27:14] amen oh Sons and Daughters of God are
[1:27:18] led by the spirit of almighty God who
[1:27:21] leads them and guides them you say oh
[1:27:23] that's going to bring confusion no
[1:27:25] because they are walking according to
[1:27:28] the word of God
[1:27:31] they're walking according to the
[1:27:33] directions of the heavenly father
[1:27:35] and that's God has a plan in everything
[1:27:39] the Pentecost it looked like confusion
[1:27:41] but it wasn't
[1:27:42] amen because it was God doing it you say
[1:27:46] oh you want rain well rain don't just
[1:27:48] fall like that rain comes out of a
[1:27:50] ragged Jagged booming lightning flashing
[1:27:53] wind blowing then the rain comes
[1:27:56] Hallelujah looks like confusion but
[1:27:58] that's the way God wants to do it amen
[1:28:01] not when we want it oh there's God the
[1:28:06] Bible says I am the Lord command ye me
[1:28:08] so I'm going to command God and they go
[1:28:11] around with this foolishness not
[1:28:14] understanding that if he is God how are
[1:28:16] you going to command him
[1:28:18] right and he says there's nobody beside
[1:28:20] me behind me before me nobody God has no
[1:28:24] competitor Satan set himself up to be a
[1:28:27] competitor but he he started a losing
[1:28:29] race because your creation to begin with
[1:28:31] he's not a Creator but a creation amen
[1:28:35] and he sees what God makes or what God
[1:28:38] does and he copies off of that and I say
[1:28:40] oh you see I made that no that's the way
[1:28:43] he does but we are following the Living
[1:28:45] God they veiled they are veiled with the
[1:28:48] same Veil over their hearts Hallelujah
[1:28:51] but when the genuine Mercy Seat come
[1:28:55] into Plain View
[1:28:58] this old hymn says lo Behold Him in
[1:29:02] plain view
[1:29:04] for he is the mighty conqueror since he
[1:29:11] rent The Veil into
[1:29:13] there he stands the mighty conqueror
[1:29:16] since he rent The Veil into
[1:29:20] veiled and blinded by Traditions amen
[1:29:24] I'm going to begin to wind this up uh
[1:29:27] veil by augmenter of systems
[1:29:30] veiled by the theologies of man veiled
[1:29:34] by the peer pressure of popular opinions
[1:29:39] amen sometimes even we Christians get
[1:29:42] caught with that well the whole world is
[1:29:44] bearing this style of dress so so I have
[1:29:48] to at least wear one like that right I
[1:29:51] might change it a little but I gotta
[1:29:54] look like everybody else the Bible
[1:29:57] doesn't tell you that you you different
[1:29:59] you're a different peculiar people for
[1:30:02] the glory of God hallelujah and this I
[1:30:06] just pass over it quickly but this what
[1:30:08] I'm talking about blinded by peer
[1:30:11] pressure of the popular opinions of man
[1:30:14] Mrs Jones brother Smith Brother this or
[1:30:18] that do it this way do it that way oh
[1:30:20] that's good way so you do it but you're
[1:30:23] not doing it because your heavenly
[1:30:25] father gave you a revelation of how to
[1:30:27] do it when to do it amen praise God and
[1:30:31] we are loved ourselves be blinded by
[1:30:33] these things we allow God to have his
[1:30:35] glory amen so they this great old Badger
[1:30:40] skins
[1:30:41] begins to hide the glory of God
[1:30:44] behind that skin aren't you glad
[1:30:48] that no matter what race
[1:30:50] no matter what color no matter what you
[1:30:53] call yourself the reality is it's God
[1:30:57] come down by his word to go hide behind
[1:31:01] your skin
[1:31:02] is that right this is not what the
[1:31:05] Revelation the mystery of God hiding in
[1:31:08] skin
[1:31:09] God and skin walking around God in the
[1:31:13] skin named Jesus walking around amen
[1:31:16] they couldn't even believe it
[1:31:18] and now he's in a many-membered body
[1:31:21] walking around oh I know him
[1:31:24] I know her yeah because God made it that
[1:31:27] way his plan that they'd be ordinary
[1:31:29] that is one that would not have the
[1:31:32] appearance of a Grecian God no but he
[1:31:35] walked in Simplicity and in humility and
[1:31:39] walking around like that but he was God
[1:31:42] because the spirit and power presence of
[1:31:45] God was flowing through him for the

[1:50:35] we had a wonderful uh meeting for the
[1:50:39] balloting
[1:50:41] of these nominations
[1:50:44] and you know myself and my precious wife
[1:50:48] sister Desiree or sister Pam as many of
[1:50:52] you know her and may be aware of her
[1:50:56] we went through that we went through it
[1:50:59] together say oh well uh how could two of
[1:51:03] you go through that do you trust them
[1:51:05] well you see the thing about it this
[1:51:07] church
[1:51:09] was founded and started by the grace of
[1:51:14] God through me
[1:51:16] uh are true us so therefore
[1:51:20] you don't have to even think anything
[1:51:22] like that if it comes down to that and
[1:51:26] we want to take that other side and that
[1:51:29] road we could name whoever we wanted
[1:51:34] did you hear me
[1:51:36] don't just stay silent I want you to
[1:51:38] know make sure that you understand it
[1:51:39] that I could do that and I have the
[1:51:42] right to do that and the power to do
[1:51:45] that but that's not what God wanted
[1:51:47] right so so so then so that you might
[1:51:51] clearly understand that nothing has to
[1:51:53] be done behind the scenes
[1:51:55] no nothing has to be done behind the
[1:51:57] scenes so praise the Lord I just left it
[1:52:01] in God's hand and we prayed that God
[1:52:05] would move in by his holy spirit
[1:52:08] and we prayed over the nomination box
[1:52:11] and the ballots that were there
[1:52:14] and then the opening of The Box
[1:52:18] the counting of it and the recording of
[1:52:21] it of which we will give the final
[1:52:25] accounting and keep it I don't mean I'll
[1:52:27] announce that but we'll we'll keep that
[1:52:30] as part of the history of the church
[1:52:32] it'll be there but now to let you know
[1:52:37] but this hour
[1:52:39] that there were
[1:52:43] eight nominations
[1:52:45] eight persons were nominated
[1:52:50] from the eight persons nominated
[1:52:55] uh about six
[1:52:58] of those individuals
[1:53:00] withdrew of their own accord
[1:53:06] an actual fact
[1:53:09] some of those individuals
[1:53:13] not some all of them have actually sent
[1:53:16] me
[1:53:18] written
[1:53:20] some emails some in handwriting
[1:53:25] attesting to their own withdrawal
[1:53:28] right so
[1:53:30] nobody asked them to withdraw or tell
[1:53:34] them to withdraw or influence them to
[1:53:36] withdraw they withdrew of their own
[1:53:39] accord
[1:53:40] different reasons some feel they were
[1:53:43] not really ready and so on and that's it
[1:53:47] but six persons withdrew and that leaves
[1:53:52] us with only
[1:53:54] two nominations
[1:53:56] and those nominations
[1:53:59] happen to be first of all
[1:54:02] our brother Tim beers would you stand
[1:54:06] brother Tim praise the name of the Lord
[1:54:09] praise the Lord ah Hallelujah
[1:54:14] God is God
[1:54:16] praise the Lord
[1:54:18] and we have the shortest brother in the
[1:54:21] church
[1:54:22] brother Danny mozilli
[1:54:25] praise the Lord
[1:54:30] God bless you praise the Lord
[1:54:34] God bless you I cause them to stand up
[1:54:36] that you if you don't know them you'll
[1:54:38] recognize them become more familiar with
[1:54:40] them and in the uh weeks ahead from now
[1:54:46] until July you will be able to because
[1:54:50] most of you already know them is that
[1:54:54] right
[1:54:55] is that right
[1:54:57] I I'm saying that and I want to have
[1:55:00] your Ascent to what I'm saying because
[1:55:03] later on you can turn around and say
[1:55:05] well I I didn't really know him
[1:55:08] you see I'm really doing so now I'm
[1:55:11] bringing this to you for you to
[1:55:13] acknowledge I don't know them
[1:55:15] but now when you knew them that might
[1:55:18] not have been on your thoughts but now
[1:55:20] they are nominated
[1:55:22] you will be thinking more in your
[1:55:25] thoughts
[1:55:26] of pastoral duties and responsibilities
[1:55:29] and things like that
[1:55:31] and that is what I want you to focus in
[1:55:34] on what God can do
[1:55:37] true individuals
[1:55:40] how we can use the badger skins
[1:55:43] to reflect himself
[1:55:45] for his glory because it's not my church
[1:55:50] it's God's Church
[1:55:53] I was only blessed and allowed to be the
[1:55:57] shepherd of this church
[1:55:59] but the real leadership of the church is
[1:56:04] Jesus Christ
[1:56:06] pastoral Ministry
[1:56:08] the the elders in the church right on
[1:56:12] down to the last person that does
[1:56:15] anything around here that's how the
[1:56:17] leadership goes right down by the Holy
[1:56:19] Spirit
[1:56:20] unto him be the glory so friends that's
[1:56:24] the way it is we have to to repeat we
[1:56:28] have two nominees and by the way let you
[1:56:31] to let you know all those who withdrew
[1:56:36] have I I have written
[1:56:39] uh records of that that will also be
[1:56:42] kept that you're not just listening to
[1:56:45] me making this announcement hearing my
[1:56:48] voice and hearing me say this
[1:56:50] uh and not having the backing for it
[1:56:54] right because I repeat because when this
[1:56:58] is all over this has got to be accounted
[1:57:01] for because the government has a part of
[1:57:03] this behind the scenes
[1:57:06] they have to know who will emerge from
[1:57:09] this and who will be the one that they
[1:57:14] can look to for the responsibilities
[1:57:17] right of the entire church
[1:57:20] it's not really it looks like usually it
[1:57:24] seems and looks like a very nice
[1:57:27] position but that's just the uh popular
[1:57:31] opinion and that's just the visible
[1:57:35] outward appearance but behind the scenes
[1:57:39] the real Pastor is a burden Bearer
[1:57:44] of the four beasts that were around the
[1:57:46] Throne of God they had the eagle the man
[1:57:49] there was one The Oxen that was a symbol
[1:57:53] of the minister who constantly Bears the
[1:57:56] burdens of the people
[1:57:58] constantly and so that is what it's all
[1:58:01] about along with just being the visible
[1:58:04] leader that receives acclimations and
[1:58:07] this stuff sort of thing then also there
[1:58:10] is a part where he Bears the
[1:58:12] responsibilities
[1:58:14] and so it's a serious and sacred thing
[1:58:17] and a sacred hour but I am blessed and I
[1:58:20] praise God that this is not a minister
[1:58:25] or ministers coming from somewhere
[1:58:27] outside
[1:58:28] uh that are being imported in
[1:58:31] but these are people who have come up
[1:58:33] right from amongst us from since they
[1:58:36] were young men
[1:58:37] right just married just starting their
[1:58:42] families coming right up and have grown
[1:58:44] right through those times right to this
[1:58:49] hour where the fruits of God beginning
[1:58:52] to show in their lives so God bless you
[1:58:55] both brother Danny God bless you God
[1:58:57] bless you brother Tim and may the Holy
[1:59:00] Spirit speak to the hearts of God's
[1:59:03] people now book of Acts it says and when
[1:59:07] they had prayed and fasted
[1:59:11] then
[1:59:12] they began to choose from among
[1:59:15] themselves
[1:59:16] and that's what I want you to do in
[1:59:19] these coming weeks ahead you begin to
[1:59:22] seek God praying your own heart maybe
[1:59:25] the person you nominated was not the one
[1:59:30] that stands here as a nominee uh maybe
[1:59:34] the person who you were thinking could
[1:59:36] take this position are not the ones that
[1:59:39] are here today but this is the way God
[1:59:42] wants to do it right as the brother
[1:59:46] Brandon said it clearly he says just he
[1:59:49] says many times I wanted this but the
[1:59:52] majority goes this way and I can see
[1:59:55] that it was God so I just went with the
[1:59:58] majority right so let the Holy Spirit
[2:00:02] have his way and I thank God the fruits
[2:00:06] of the ministry are right in front of
[2:00:08] you
[2:00:09] right from the fruits of the ministry
[2:00:11] you're not going to have something that
[2:00:14] was like a cloven foot that was hidden
[2:00:17] up or some kind of a clause or something
[2:00:21] but men that were raised up under this
[2:00:25] this ministry with a clear understanding
[2:00:28] of the word and growing in Jesus Christ
[2:00:31] and emerging and may God bless them both
[2:00:34] praise the Lord let's bar heads and pray
[2:00:37] for them briefly
[2:00:42] our gracious Heavenly Father
[2:00:47] we bring these two ministering spirits
[2:00:51] to stand before your throne
[2:00:55] and With Your Eyes Upon them
[2:00:58] with all the Angels
[2:01:01] surrounding them around the throne
[2:01:05] watching them
[2:01:07] Lord Jesus
[2:01:10] let the Holy Spirit have his way
[2:01:13] let him make his own choosing
[2:01:17] and then for your glory and praise may
[2:01:22] you be honored and worshiped and may the
[2:01:25] church grow and move on each one
[2:01:30] in his own time
[2:01:32] may you be glorified shall God be the
[2:01:35] glory great things he has done
[2:01:38] so lovely the world that he gave us his
[2:01:41] son now father we ask you to give us
[2:01:43] your pastor after your own heart
[2:01:47] for we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and
[2:01:50] let everybody if you agree with me say
[2:01:51] aloud amen
[2:01:54] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[2:01:56] so let it be amen means so let it be and
[2:02:00] that is what we say so let it be God
