[0:01] amen hallelujah it's true the brick is
[0:06] manmade am the
[0:09] stone is unshaped natural it's just
[0:13] natural but the main point is on
[0:17] shaped uh but let me make a point here a
[0:22] preacher a a stone
[0:25] Mason can quickly put up a wall with
[0:28] bricks mhm because they're already all
[0:32] of
[0:33] them the same size it's uniform right
[0:37] they have their fundamentals this is how
[0:39] Christian should be that's and
[0:41] everything you got to fit within that
[0:43] goal you know that you know when you
[0:45] make we been carp BL so I know Chris
[0:49] understand what I'm talking about every
[0:52] sit in the M every one is the same right
[0:56] so he knows that when he grabs put grab
[1:00] puts it there the measurements the same
[1:02] everything the same everything like that
[1:03] the same like that and he can quickly
[1:05] and swiftly put it up but the that's the
[1:08] reason why because bricks are all
[1:11] identical they're all identical but when
[1:15] you see raw Stones they're of different
[1:19] shapes they're of different size they're
[1:23] of different color yes and the stone
[1:26] Mason just can't go and grab and put on
[1:29] the wall
[1:30] he's got to pick up the stone and then
[1:34] he's got to evaluate it he's got to look
[1:37] at that stone
[1:39] carefully uh to know exactly how to chip
[1:44] is that right you know when I was in
[1:45] Israel the guy was telling me there when
[1:47] he has those diamonds behind of course a
[1:49] thick bulletproof B but he was telling
[1:52] me you know that you know his job asked
[1:56] him about his job he says every ship
[2:00] of that of that of that diamond you got
[2:03] he says sometimes you they can take a
[2:06] day or two days looking at di that
[2:08] Diamond walking around the diamond
[2:10] looking at it through the microscope
[2:12] before they even put a chisel or
[2:16] whatever to
[2:17] it because you don't want it to break in
[2:21] a certain way you want it to go exactly
[2:25] the way you wanted to go you don't want
[2:27] to spoil the beauty of the diamond you
[2:29] don't want to damage that believer's
[2:31] life uh by some pastoral abusive uh uh
[2:36] you know Behavior or something like that
[2:39] are you following
[2:40] me praise the Lord you want to chip it
[2:43] exactly the way God wants iten
[2:46] hallelujah
[2:49] amen bringing it naturally discipline
[2:52] your child without breaking the child's
[2:54] spirit it's the same thing I'm trying to
[2:57] say here you can discipline the child
[2:59] without breaking the child's spirit see
[3:02] so this is important we understand that
[3:04] the same thing goes you need a stone
[3:07] Mason brother says that quoting him just
[3:12] these things just comeing to me here
[3:13] where he says he says when you you you
[3:16] you repent and you come to Christ you
[3:18] said you're nothing but a stone rolled
[3:20] out of the gter you need a stone Mason
[3:22] to chip of the C amen and Shake you that
[3:26] you find your place in the body of
[3:29] Christ amen a lot of people get that
[3:31] problem because they don't want to
[3:32] submit themselves to a St me all right
[3:35] because it's painful somebody Ching away
[3:37] do is not an easy stuff right going be
[3:40] very painful stuff that you love that
[3:42] chip away this part you think was nice
[3:45] chip away and so it becomes very painful
[3:48] Pro procedure as it is amen so he's
[3:52] start to chip it to see how it will fit
[3:53] in and Chip it and shape it to fit and
[3:58] uh finally when he's done
[4:00] of course people start to declare oh my
[4:04] Believers from that church my God
[4:06] they're a work of
[4:07] art
[4:10] hallelujah amen let me feel good tonight
[4:13] brother that
[4:14] amen Paul said let me be a fool he said
[4:18] let me boast a
[4:20] little a preacher met um some Believers
[4:24] from this
[4:26] church um and said to me he said oh oh
[4:29] my God I met Believers from your church
[4:34] and if the rest in your church and never
[4:37] met a church with so many I would have
[4:40] never met a church with so many people
[4:42] like that in one place I have to come
[4:45] and see that myself amen amen so that
[4:49] preacher has to come here because you
[4:51] can't believe it right he just can't
[4:53] believe it praise the Lord amen so I I
[4:57] just thank the Lord I just say thank you
[4:59] brother appreciate that uh very very
[5:01] much it's encouraging amen amen cuz
[5:04] you're slugging away slugging away year
[5:06] after year getting dirt M everything at
[5:09] you you know and all kinds of stuff and
[5:14] and sometimes you're human sometimes you
[5:16] think what am I doing this for you know
[5:18] the devil come play with your mind what
[5:20] am I doing this for you know I really
[5:22] don't need to take
[5:24] this I'm old now maybe I should just sit
[5:26] them and rest
[5:29] that right but I heard a voice behind me
[5:32] say I sat down to rest from feet
[5:37] gr but then I Heard a Voice me say you
[5:41] got to keep on walking keep right on
[5:45] walk Walking in the light of the Lord
[5:49] you'll get to heaven somay if you walk
[5:54] the right way walking in the light of
[5:58] the Lord amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[6:01] Jesus I I have two more minutes and I'm
[6:05] going to use it it's not 9:00 yet so you
[6:08] can't start uh saying anything pray
[6:12] for
[6:14] amen and so we are all different and God
[6:19] gives us different
[6:20] [Music]
[6:21] talents diversities of
[6:24] gifts that's why when he drew the p
[6:30] every part of it is a different color
[6:33] and that color types the rainbow and
[6:36] then if you follow that up and want to
[6:38] preach a message you gone into Joseph
[6:40] coat of many colors and then you gone to
[6:43] the angel of the Covenant the same
[6:45] rainbow and you can go on and on it's
[6:47] always featured that way because praise
[6:50] the name of the Lord God loves variety
[6:53] amen doesn't love the same mess that's
[6:56] right like we seen the denomination they
[6:58] have to come cut right out of their
[7:00] lurgical book or they got their
[7:02] fundamental statements of faith and
[7:04] everything and you got to fit within
[7:06] those certain boundaries or you're not
[7:08] one of them you've got to you see God
[7:11] loves that variety uh there so here we
[7:15] find of we've got diverse talents
[7:18] diverse abilities diverse personality
[7:20] and then God in his uh in his wisdom
[7:25] will bring certain opportunities to you
[7:27] that he will bring to me amen because I
[7:30] don't have the talent to seize those
[7:32] opportunities amen you have the talent
[7:35] God will open that kind of opportunity
[7:37] for you glory to God and you seize the
[7:41] opportunity praise the Lord hallelujah
[7:43] amen you don't hesitate I wonder if God
[7:46] want no you don't have to wonder I mean
[7:49] an e see fresh me don't wonder just grab
[7:53] some tears amen because that's the way
[7:55] it's me praise the Lord he who hesitates
[7:58] is lost you don't hesitate you just
[8:01] seize the opportunity for God's glory
[8:04] and for his honor amen listen so we do

[8:37] he could do after Satan God had doomed
[8:40] the whole human race condemnation by
[8:43] adamic
[8:44] representation he turned the th around
[8:48] praise the Lord by the shedding of his
[8:51] blood and redeemed Us by the blood so
[8:54] that he can house himself in redeemed
[8:58] flesh today amen redeem how I love to
[9:02] Proclaim it redeem by the blood of L
[9:07] redeem through his infinite Mercy his
[9:10] child and forever I am glory to God

[10:53] going us stop on this teaching praise
[10:55] the name of the Lord you say brother
[10:57] Simon why would you continue on you can
[10:59] spend another two hours and Believers
[11:01] will appreciate it well I know that
[11:04] you'll appreciate the revelation of it
[11:05] but your body
[11:10] won't amen praise the name of the Lord
[11:13] look we have enough to deal with am with
[11:16] the stress factor in this
[11:19] world over all the other
[11:22] ages this age has more stress amen just
[11:26] driving your
[11:28] car what press you
[11:30] are I'm telling you I'm not kiding the
[11:34] devil will send off you say I'm a good
[11:36] driver that's nothing to do the devil
[11:39] will send all kind of people stop in
[11:41] front of you they come beside you
[11:42] they'll even give you a wicked
[11:45] grin and drive up and drive whatever
[11:49] like that so our lives are in God's hand
[11:51] is not can drive or or or this or that
[11:54] you got to place your life in the hands
[11:56] of God we live in that age where most
[11:59] stressful age and remember once the
[12:02] devil start to get a hint of who you are
[12:04] he's going to start to pull up out the
[12:06] tricks
[12:07] and that's right
[12:10] right he's going to pull Tricks and
[12:12] Treats on you and pull you around here
[12:14] put you around there so at the end of
[12:17] every week every everybody that goes to
[12:19] a job will feel like they're washed
[12:23] out I'm telling you but the fact is if
[12:27] your job is so fantastic so good or
[12:30] whatever you you anxious to get back on
[12:32] your job why do they have to have no
[12:35] work on Saturday I want to go in nobody
[12:38] talks like that if they have
[12:43] to that's right nobody goes in but the
[12:46] reason why because of consciously the
[12:48] devil is clawing at us as Believers and
[12:51] tearing at you trying to do everything
[12:52] he can in other words I know you're
[12:55] going to make it there now because water
[12:56] the blood but I'm going to make it like
[12:58] hell here
[13:00] you're on my my turf I'm going to make
[13:02] my head and he's going to do his best so
[13:04] you got all that to deal with and then
[13:06] you got to come in the house of God and
[13:10] then you got to go to hell and
[13:15] back you got to go back see see after we
[13:19] finish all this preaching and the
[13:21] Hallelujah and the shouting you got to
[13:23] come right back with come to reality and
[13:25] realize that you you got to go back to
[13:27] your job and this work you have to to
[13:29] there and that's why I try to stick as
[13:33] much as I can to this time frame amen
[13:36] that's the reason why I do that not
[13:38] because I can't preach long I can preach
[13:40] an hour two more hours and we can go on
[13:43] sh Hallelujah but then you're going to
[13:45] have to wake up tomorrow morning early
[13:48] and go to your workout sleepy and
[13:50] everything else and and that's not going
[13:52] to be good all right so so you
[13:55] understand what I'm doing amen and it's
[13:57] not because I want GL um preaching the
[14:02] word to you but especially in the middle
[14:04] of the week there are these concerns the
[14:07] same holy spirit that told me years ago
[14:09] have one service on Sunday when when I
[14:13] had the only Mage Church in Toronto at
[14:15] the time have one service on Sunday cuz
[14:18] what I was F have two services and the
[14:21] sisters with unsaved husbands family
[14:24] getting Frid there is anger there is
[14:26] argument there is this and the Holy
[14:27] Spirit said no
[14:29] they have to have time with their family
[14:32] too they got to have time to prepare for
[14:34] their work get their children ready have
[14:37] go on service amen and even if it's long
[14:39] when it's ended they can go and do
[14:42] whatever they can do so I instituted
[14:44] that back then and um it's been working
[14:48] till today and it's the same way the
[14:51] holy spirit says now before you can
[14:54] preach as long as you want when I'm in
[14:56] Africa of course I can preach as long as
[14:58] they want me to preach I they sit there
[15:01] all day I'm not move and I'm already
[15:04] washed out but the fact is here um you
[15:09] preach the word and then I let you go
[15:12] because that's the time frame and you
[15:14] need to be out and do whatever you have
[15:17] to do God bless you I kep you 10 minutes
[15:20] so you can uh find
[15:24] me shall we our word prayer
[15:27] [Music]
[15:30] godes him
[15:32] Simplicity and he reveals himself in the
[15:34] s yes sir you you brother BR said when
[15:38] you look what do you see you see what
[15:42] you're looking for he said if you if I
[15:45] send you to the barn to get me a hammer
[15:47] and you don't know what it is you can go
[15:49] there and kick it and don't know what
[15:51] you're picking up so you got to have the
[15:54] Revelation and the understanding and the
[15:57] wisdom of God I'm not talking about
[15:59] knowing the message you don't have to
[16:02] mentally know the message as he said I
[16:04] wash a woman in the woods c one
[16:07] Revelation and the whole thing begins to
[16:08] open up when preaching begin to preach
[16:11] all of a sudden she start to understand
[16:13] but he is that wisdom father we thank
[16:16] you tonight for the spirit and the
[16:18] anointing that is upon me and upon your
[16:20] people here opening up the eyes of the
[16:23] understanding of the heart and we pray
[16:25] that the word of God will take root and
[16:28] grow and and stabilize their foundations
[16:31] and their character that we truly will
[16:34] be the house of God this we ask in
[16:37] jesus' name amen take us safely to our
[16:40] homes protect us on the road from the
[16:43] from the weather and from the the people
