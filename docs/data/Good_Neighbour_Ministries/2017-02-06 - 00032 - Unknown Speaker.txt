TRANSCRIPT
========================================
ship Jesus Christ in this hour you're going to need to know that you're going to need to know that amen God bless you musicians thank you very much praise God for wonderful song service Hallelujah knowing that the Lord is um so pleased with worship amen that's absolutely essential before you come into the presence of God and expect him to you know feed you and meet your needs and give you what you have Hallelujah worship need to get out of this Dimension see worship is placing him first that's what it's doing it's placing him first you know your thoughts all your your adoration your love your uh your everything that's good you place it all into Christ Jesus and it just makes everything special when you enter into the word of God Amen praise God good to be in the house of the Lord this morning um we are here once again um by the grace of God Pastor Simon is now starting to turn his I know I know the way he thinks you know he's starting to turn you know the bolts moving in a certain direction and you know the things around him are what they are but uh I know you know he's only got a few days left and so he's already starting to turn his thoughts towards his home his ministry and his children amen and so continue to keep him in prayer that the Lord will just give him what he needs and strengthen him so that he can come back and be what God wants him to be amen amen praise God and so uh we stand here this morning by his grace by uh you know a thought and an inspiration that he laid upon my heart and uh you know I just when when they come I just write the things down I just kind of put it together the best that I possibly can but then it takes the Holy Spirit and you know that you know that if you if you you know you've been born again by the spirit of God you did not just join this church you did not just decide that you oh I think you know I live in a community so maybe I should belong to a church or you know you didn't just happen to choose because I know a lot of you you know um in your human thinking you've gone through a lot of struggles and a lot of battles when it comes to serving God under the under the revealed word for this day because it separates you it makes you different it gives you a different standard it makes you talk different it makes you walk different it makes you change the way that you were a lot of us we had to do a complete 360 amen a lot of our friends became our enemies because we did a 360 we didn't understand but it was God it's God's election it's God's time it's God's calling amen so um this morning we're going to be looking into the word of God slide one you can put that up and our thought today is who do you see in the mirror kind of strange right but who do you see in the mirror you know SL to you look in the mirror and say oh boy that's a handsome D or you might look in the mirr and say my God I'm getting old or you might look into the mirror and you might see things that that you know that that that you wish you had it changed or you know you look back at your life and you start to reflect back on the circumstances of your life and you look at a lot of different things and you know you you you might see things that you wish you could have been you might see things that you wish you hadn't done you could look back and you're looking in the mirror because when you're looking in the mirror you you're you're looking at yourself and you're wondering wow you know what would I have been or you know if I had have taken this road and then sometimes you might think wow if God hadn't intervened I wouldn't even be looking in the mirror right now that's right I wouldn't even got to that age you know you need to realize who you really are and what it is that God is doing in this this day and in this hour when you look into that mirror you know you want to you want to be able to see the right reflection you want to see goals and vision of where it is that you're headed and what it is that you want to do and what you want to accomplish here in this life you know um brother brandham spoke one time about a young boy that uh you know went to visit with his aunt you know in Kentucky and you know she had a big house and this boy he was you know I'm just going to paraphrase it and just kind of you know highlight it um but he said that you know uh this young boy he never really saw himself he didn't see himself at all and one day he went to his aunts and you know she kind of uh had a big mirror there from top to bottom and brother Brandon is talking about where he's talking about it's it's from the message three kinds of Believers and he says when you look into that mirror what do you see he saw him self he saw hey that's me but then where did he stand where he and this is the thought that brother Brown was bringing where do you see yourself would you have stood with Jesus you looking in that mirror this morning are you somebody that you could say I'm standing with Jesus I'm standing with the word of God or you one that's kind of you know you know you're you're always covering up some of you sisters you know you want to cover up this cover up that you know still using a little bit of makeup here and you know like trying trying to hide whatever it is you know because because something is you know is is in your in your character that maybe you're trying to hide or something that you're but you can't hide with God you can't be a make believer with God not if you've been born again there's just no way you could do it am amen and so you know he's talking about it in that way and we want to be able to look into the mirror of our lives next slide and so we're going to read from our scripture Jeremiah 1 4 to8 then the word of the Lord came unto me saying be before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations then said I ah Lord God behold I cannot speak for I am a child I am a child this is what you know sometimes we don't see that we're growing that we're maturing but the Lord said unto me say not I am a child for Thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak be not afraid of their faces for I am with thee to deliver thee sayeth the Lord let us pray father we thank you this morning Lord that Lord this is not something that we thought we would do or that we would join that we would just become a member of Lord but this this is a high calling this is this is something that took place from before the foundations of the world and so we want to see it in the right context this morning and Lord as we look into the mirror of Our Lives we want to see right we want to see things the way that you see them Father because that's what's going to make everything completely different from this day on if we can receive what you have for us today and I know that this is inspiration that you planted in my heart father if we can receive it today if the people can open their hearts and open their lives and and just be honest and know that you're here and that you're willing to change transform and do great things for each and every one of us Lord we can leave this place different than the way we came in and Lord that's what we place into your hands this morning anoint the speaker anoint the hear father in the name of Jesus Christ and Lord remember our pastor bring him safely him and sister desire protect them guide them watch over them Lord remember all those that are sick and Afflicted that could not be here remember brother philli and his wife father remember oh God uh Lord all those that are in need this morning may you just touch them whether they're present or whether they're not in Jesus name we pray amen and amen God bless you Saints you may be seated the word of God is supposed to be in Us in this hour and you just heard what the scripture said that he said I put my word in your mouth regardless of how you see it regardless of what you think you're capable of regardless of where you think you're at the stage because we're not all at the same level we're walking by the grace of God and we're moving by his grace and we're led by his spirit and it's by faith that we do whatever it is that we do we need faith we can't do it on our own and so you need to understand that you need to know that it's not by your own ability it's because God said so God told Jeremiah hey I'm putting my word in your mouth he says but you know I'm not capable of this I can't do this he says regardless he says I'm going to be with you I'm going to watch over you I'm going to watch my word in other words because it's his word it's the attribute that he placed in you that gives you the ability to receive the word of God and to actually speak the things that we speak in this day and in this hour and so we can't be afraid to speak the word of God and I'm not talking about because of zeal and you know going out there and trying to be something and speaking the word of God in that way no it's with a life that's right it's with a walk amen it's with a revelation amen hallelujah slide four that which is perfect is come in Corinthians 1 Corinthians 13: 9 to 12 it says for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away now notice what it says there I want you to pay attention when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part is done away when I was a child here we go I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away child things that's right for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then I know even as also I am know I'm going to read to you from the Amplified version this very same scripture it says here starting in verse 9 for our knowledge is in fragmentary incomplete and imperfect and our prophecy our teaching is fragmentary incomplete and imperfect but when the complete and perfect the total comes the incomplete and the imperfect will vanish away become Antiquated void and superseded listen carefully now when I was a child I talked like a child I thought like a child I reasoned like a child now that I have become a man I am done with childish ways and have put them aside for now we look in a mirror that gives only a dim blurred reflection of reality as in a riddle or Enigma but then when Perfection comes we shall see in reality and face to face now I know in part imperfectly but then I shall know and understand fully and clearly even in the same manner as I have been fully and clearly known and understood of God hallelujah you mean he sees me some some something a little different than the way that I see myself in the mirror you mean now God now we're talking about God seeing from before the foundations of the world first of all if he even sees you it's because you were an attribute of God and you were always in the mind of God so for that alone you should be jumping up and down here this morning saying Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus that you saw me that my name was written there that I was actually there that he actually saw you brother gab can you imagine that when he saw you he saw me amen to God because he saw game going down there and then he saw me walking into his J I don't know where you all fit in but we all fit in somehow some way together amen bless the name of the Lord and I'm glad that he saw me and that he sees me in a certain way glory to God Amen it's it's just unbelievable blessed be the name of the Lord many people are lost in their own desires though that's the problem amen people are all caught up in their own Ambitions unscriptural things and this and this kind of like you know kind of brings a separation law between you and your destiny and what God's purpose is for your life amen striving for the things of the world my goodness like the prophet one time you know the prophet one time he went hunting he took his wife and his little child he says I'm going to get me a bear you guys just stay here I'm going to get me a couger Hallelujah going to put him up on my wall you see he got caught up too he says I'm going to go catch me a big bear I'm going to put that bear in there and oh it's going to look good and everything else he got so caught up and so carried away the weather changed all of a sudden he remembered about his wife and little child back there my goodness he had to get back to Camp guess what no matter what he did no matter how much he tried to get back he was on a death walk yes sir oh boy I hope nobody's on the death walk this morning I hope people are understanding the priority and the reason and the purpose why God has called you into this church into this body for a purpose you're not to just spt with the world and get so caught up that you get yourself on a death walk I hope not come on he forgot he got all caught up but the grace of God came down oh glory to God his grace is still available for you morning it's still find yourself kind of lost you find yourself not on the right path and you know your priorities are a little bit out and you know a little bit mixed up don't worry God's grace is going to make a way for you to come back amen blessed be the name of the Lord that's what he does he's working this out in your life regardless of your situation he's working it out because he has called you he has placed you he has purposed in his your destiny and your purpose in this day and in this hour amen that's why we are here this morning we're not wandering here this morning we didn't wander into this place and wander into that wonder why I'm going here or going there he's no you know as a Believer you come to your posted Duty that's right that's your purpose in coming into the house of the Lord you come to take up your position in the house of God amen I trust that you come to take up your position there's too many people that are losing sight of their position they come to the house of the Lord they get so busy doing other things yeah what you mean in the house of the Lord yeah right here in the house of the Lord people come here because they're in a position and they think that that's all that there is to their position is just to do their little position and fail to sit in the service and receive the word right that's right amen they're going here going there going upstairs going downstairs going doing this doing that busy doing this busy doing that and forgetting the purpose that you come into the house of the Lord you've got a position but yet you've got to sit and receive instruction amen the word that gives you strength amen that gives you the ability to leave this place with confidence to know that you can face the enemy amen glory to God Amen take up your position get into Heavenly places in the word of God get into the worship and then re see the word just flows into your heart right Mo way amen glory to go slide number five when were you chosen you got to realize you were not chosen 2 years or 20 years ago you were chosen from before the foundations of the world Ephesians 1:3 it says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according what as you chose he chose he have chosen who us we're in him you were in him come on [Music] when 22 years for me this July sometimes I wonder Lord why in the world did you wait 33 years to come and I was in such a mess oh but glory to God hallelujah brother I got a testimony in my heart I know that God can deliver I know he's a [Applause] deliverer know there no one in here that's too difficult for God it's only his time that's all just his time oh when it's his time it's beautiful it's beautiful that's all I can tell you because I was looking back sometimes and I would wonder 33 years at all this and that look back at that old man that that that that that got annihilated by the grace of God when I went into that tank thank God that that life was buried a lot of people don't want to get baptized they want to hold on to their old life that's what they're saying they don't realize it it's because they they want to hold on to their old life no I don't want to be baptized I was baptized as a baby they got no Revelation daddy you got to you got to know what you're doing you got to know when you go into that tank that you're leaving a life behind and you're raising up Hallelujah you you'll live different you'll be different and Satan will know that you meant you the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will am that's how much he loves you no that's how much he needs you you're in his will my parents put me into their will because they love me amen your parents put you into their will because they love you they want to provide for you they want to they want to leave you something they want to they want to bless you they got something they want to leave it amen God wants to give us his perfect will we just need to receive it amen to the praise and uh the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will amen glory to God Amen yes Jesus you see you remember certain things you remember that you were in darkness when the light comes you remember when he said let there be light you remember those things now you can think about those things because your life was in darkness you were void you were without form you had no real uh you know understanding and the evening light came and it began to shine on you that's what this word does It Shines on you and it starts to raise you up it starts to change you transform you amen and he separates what the darkness from the light so all the you know all of a sudden you start dressing different you're not wearing those many scripts you're not wearing those tight pants you're not you know all of a sudden you're starting to line up with the word of God you're starting to not because God says this and says that but because you've received his Spirit that's right and in you wants to to to give back the Revelation that you've received and so when a woman when she dresses in in a modest way it's because she's been humbled by the presence of God right and she's been humbl to know that God loves her God really cares about her that she's a part of him and that that just makes listen if you ever come to that place you know what I'm talking about you're just humiliated here you're just humbled that's why you repent that's why you come to that place where you turn your life around because it becomes a reality to you the darkness gets separated from the light your Earth was covered with Darkness right your Earth was all covered in darkness amen and your life was without form and void but the spirit of God moved upon you and his spoken word as you began to hear it and receive it transformed you oh glory to God through the mouth of a prophet amen you heard the word that was to be restored you needed restored word you couldn't just you couldn't feed on on the Mana that their feet that they're feeding not on there that's right amen that's why people say what you follow a man no no we follow the word am the word of the Lord came unto the Prophet Jeremiah and the word went forth it was the man speaking the word but it was the word that the people heartened to it was thus sayth the Lord hallelujah God somebody showed me one time where he said thus sayeth the Lord through all the years of his ministry where it did not come to pass 100% am oh there's a lot that will say oh no he made mistakes and all he did he said this and he said that and he believed this and he believed that and then he changed his mind God doesn't make mistakes can a man make mistakes I'll probably make one tomorrow so will you so don't look oh I make mistake so will you I guarantee but not the word of God not the attribute of God it cannot disbelieve the word of God there is no way that anybody can tell me that the word of God makes any mistakes makes any kind of error no sir re god is perfect perfect has feing on this morning I'm feing on the perfect word of God I'm feeding on that which has come in this day and in this hour because I know that that is going to do it that's going to translate me that's going to take me from this Dimension into that other oh yes sir I'm not relying on man's ability no Sur glory to God the light of the hour began to separate the darkness from you do you know that you need light for the hour that's right you try and go into one of those denominational churches and get what you have need of first of all if you're going into them it should only be if you're on vacation somewhere and you can't find the the word a word me Church secondly cuz you ain't born again I'm just going to tell it the way it is you're born again well you know what I'm getting you know people tell me they leave this church they go to Pentecostal they go to a Reformed Church and this and that I ain't going to say a word because I can't give Revelation only God gives Revelation on his word it just shows that hey it's not their time or it may never be I don't know but you cannot be released loosed from the bondage of darkness in this day and in this hour without the Holy Ghost right but you just said the message of the hour yes I did because the Holy Ghost is the message of the hour without the Holy Ghost you can't see the Bible said Jesus said I will send you the comforter and he will guide you which is the Holy Spirit and he will guide you into all kinds of different churches and Creeds and denominational teachings he said the truth the truth it'll guide you to the truth and so that's the first question that should upon your heart what am I feeding on am I feeding on the truth that's right or am I feeding on some man traditional idea what they believe to be the truth that's right because if they leave brother Bram out of the formula it's just like leaving Moses amen just like leaving Joshua just like leaving Ezekiel and Elijah and every other Prophet where God intervened into the lives into the people into the Nations and turned them into another Direction where they could either meet with Joy or meet with the demon power that would possess their lives which one how you going to leave out the 20th century Prophet you can't do it it's impossible you may not see it right away but you will know to be like me I didn't see it right away probably about a year later I started to wow now I see why this was striking my soul now I understand what it was that when I listen to those tap I couldn't quite understand but it was just something would just happen now I see he's the prophet of Malachi 4 amen he's the prophet of Revelation 10 he's the voice of God in these last days to come and restore a church it makes sense look at all these 2,000 3,000 denominations how in the world am I going to know which is the truth and which is not the truth think about it how are you know how in the world were you going to say I know for sure I'm okay you're lost baby without this word without this Revelation you ain't been born again and all those old things went away your clothes changed your language changed your Ambitions went away come on you're you know what something began to Quicken the life began to penetrating your Earth and you started to change you started to become different and as you understand understanding is becoming enlightened by the word of God you're discovering that there's a seed in you and that seed is not some some seed that's given to every single person that's alive because a lot of people say everybody's got a soul not everybody's got a soul from before the foundations of the world that comes from the mind of God that is an attribute of God right some have souls that just live by it right but then they die that's why the Bible says and the soul that sin shall but what I I thought that Souls can't die I thought that souls are [Music] Eternal you know they got a teaching out there two Soul Doctrine whatever it is they need a revelation on what that is I got a revelation on it I hope you got a revelation on it amen if you've got a sole attribute that was placed from before the foundation a mind of God elected and placed in you when you took that first breath you came into this Dimension you you're going back to God you're a son or a daughter of God you can't you can't stop it if you tried because he said all that the father have given me they will come that's right glory to God and guess what the bride next slide they're forn they're called they're Justified and they're glorified Romans 8:28 says and we know that all things work together for good so I don't care where your situation is this morning I don't care where you're at I don't care if you're halfway there or quarter of the way there or you're you're you're bound up by anger or you're bound up by by you know by by uh uh lust and the things of this world regardless of that oh glory to God it's going to work for good because God's going to turn it around God's going to move you in the right direction you might be rebellious right now wa I felt something there you might be in a rebellious condition right now and you don't want to hearken unto the word of the Lord you want to go in a certain direction you say no this is the direction I'm going and I don't care poor old me I see it this way I don't care I'm not going to do this I'm not going to do that I'm going this way I don't care doesn't matter what he says doesn't matter what she says this is my will this is my what a son of a daughter of God be in that kind of a rebellious condition God help you you better repent you better turn to God you better look real close and where you're headed because if you don't hearken under the warnings of the Lord oh boy I can give you a lot of examples through the scriptures but we Hallelujah to get into that this morning I don't know where that came from but glory to God blessed be his name he says to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinated to be position to that he might be the first born among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and who he called them he also Justified and then who he justified he also glorified so you know what justification Saints when you come to that realization that you have not sinned and that you're sins are all washed away like we saying Oh Glory to God you're going to realize that by Revelation you never did it in the first place that's right because justification is that you never did it in the first place you were deceived you were in a deceptive condition amen but God turned you around because he forew you bless the name of the Lord taken out of him built up in his own image in his own likeness that's what he's doing right now she's she is light of his life that's who you are you got to realize that you were in him your life of his life you were in him your your your spirit of his Spirit word of his word you're coming into his very own image to be United with him he knew you and so he justified you that's right he knew you back there he also knew you would come into this life he also knew you were going to make mistakes he also knew you were going to go the wrong way he says I don't care right that's right she's I'm justifying her as though she never myself to her she's only going to say Thank You Lord bless the Jesus glory to God but now at the End of the Age the fullness of the word is com now we're leading into the meat here right the fullness of the word is com s Angels Came Down Seven Seals were ripped open those seals were ripped open for a purpose they were ripped open in a season in a time right at the perfect and the right time just when God had to reveal his word to call out his elected bride those Seven Seals were revealed bringing the fullness of the word remember we talked about that which is perfect when that which is perfect it when it comes let go of everything else Saints let go of it some people will let go of the word no no and they'll go fanatical and they'll take one little doctorine and they'll go off with it and they're way out in the right field somewhere thinking that they're that they're okay and they're often some seven sealed Doctrine saying well the seal ain't open the seven seal ain't open it's not open to them amen that's right but it's open to you amen if you've got a revelation to realize that that was the perfect word that was coming down to give us that which was perfect so that we could be perfected so that the fivefold ministry could actually have something to use glory to God they could have something to be anointed by they could have the word that was for their day so that they could know with confidence that they could that they could stand in their post of Duty and know that God was going to come down and back the bride he was gon to get a bride ready he was gonna he was going to do what he said he was going to do and he has a way of doing it he's going to Fan His five-fold Hand Ministry and he's going to he's going to get rid of all the wheat and put them into the Garner and he's going to take all the weeds and burn them that's right that's what the world is going to do amen because there's going to be a time of tribulation that's going to come upon Earth it's just that simple we cannot stop it amen when you see the word for your day when you see that that which is perfect has come it's because Redemption is drawing n the more you get the revelation of what I'm speaking on here this morning the more you feed on it the more you say amen and you receive it and you let it become a part of you it's because you are being changed it's because it's the season it's the time brother gave to go home it's the time sister it's the time brother to get ready and to put aside and Trust in the promises of God that he's going to do what he said he's Hallelujah it is not the will of God that we should perish right that's right no sir it's not his will that we should you know that that that we should be lost or that we should be in confusion that's not his will this morning it's not his will for you to be in a dispute it's not his will for you to be in in in financial Stress and Anxiety that's not his will he's here to give you deliverance from those things can receive it can can be changed you don't have to be under that bondage anymore Hallelujah glory to God he doesn't want you to go into tribulation that's right he's not going to let it happen there's way thank you Lord blessed be his name it's not his will he has come to take us out glory to God to raise us up blessed be his wonderful name to link us with our theophany glory to God because without that you can't go there that body is destined to go there to go to a meeting in the air blessed be the name of the Lord if you don't connect with that body you're going to miss that that's right amen that soul theop body it connects you with this world too but dear God it better be connected to God that's right it better be connected by Revelation amen a lot of people talking about the theophany a lot of people talking about the Rapture but they don't know what's really connected they don't know what's really involved in the connection they don't know that it's him secretly coming revealing his word making it plain personally individual individual individual he's giving you personal faith to know that he's real you haven't got to that place on your knees amen you need personal revelation you need personal faith and one of these days that body is going to pick you up glory to God it's going to take you out of this dimension in the morning in the twinking of an eye you are going to be changed and all of your burdens all of your mortgages right Hallelujah I'm TR in the them all that's all right every one of including the one in this church I'm believe in for before we leave this she left with what great substance Hallelujah nothing greater than a reation that is my provider he's going to provide he's going to make way Pro is M it's not separated and a little bit here and a little bit there no every promise you got to stand there you just got to stand I believe it I don't care what the doctor said I don't care what the banks the word of Lord standing on that word because he chose me it was his calling amen bless the Lord next Slide the gospel is hid to them that are not born again it's just that simple so don't be trying to drive this message into people's minds and trying to convince them that they got to receive it because in 2 Corinthians 4: 3 it says but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost now nobody likes to say hey you're lost and you shouldn't be going out there all right now somebody comes along and really pushes your buttons still over that just me you got to understand you can't get too zealous to the point where you're going to force something on anybody because in whom the God of this world had blinded the minds of them which believe not less the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them and in Luke 10:21 Jesus says in that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou H has so why are you trying to rip it open and say no look at this is hidden you got to see this mystery when he hit it he opens you can speak it you can you know say what you can you know testify what God is doing let them know what you're seeing just like you know it was coming to me I'd sit there and I'd Fellowship my God would sit down with brother Tim beers and we'd sit in Fellowship all and I'm just sitting there and I'm just sucking in every word because I'm just I'm hearing that's me I'm hearing that's that's true I I just couldn't help it I couldn't fully understand but the word of God was just so real it just simply flowed and it just it just made perfect sense but that's God because he decided not to hide it amen he decided to reveal it and that's what it is Saints it's all about re Revelation Revelation is God divinely opening your understanding so that his thoughts can flow into you amen hallelujah that thou has hid these things from the wise and the prudent so don't think just because he's a he's a theologian he's got his e l d d g lbb g so he should go nope not even the Pope not even the pope not even Billy gr son amen only God chooses to reveal to whom he chooses am and has revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seems good in that sight bless the Lord what slide is that sister nine number nine seven Sorry Seven seven go to number eight God is in full control you remember that we're slowing it down a little bit then we're going to move again amen God is in full control listen what the word says that they may know from the rising of the Sun and from the West that there is none beside me I am the lord and there is none else I formed the light and created the darkness oh yeah he created the circumstances that you find yourself in a lot of times you wonder Lord why because the light's going to shine soon son don't worry daughter when when the light shines on it don't worry that Darkness has to fle you try to turn on a light in a dark room and tell me the darkness is still there you'd have to be blind and that's what it is with a lot of people you go there you talk to them you tell them about the truth which is the light they say I'm as blind as a I can't see a thing it's dark in here why because it's God that opens the understanding he created the darkness I make peace and I create evil I the Lord do all these things wow Proverbs 16:4 he says the Lord hath made all things for himself yay even the wicked for the day of evil the day of evil is closer than you think oh yeah but he redeemed us he's made us new amen he's making us all brand new again because he was the beginning of the new creation you see when Adam came he was the first that man fell by but then the second Adam came and he's the one that we get raised up by Hallelujah the first Adam all died Adam was the head of a fallen ruined creation my goodness can you imagine and God has to get a new creation because every man that came from Adam had to come by sex did you know that there's only one that came by the spoken word and he came to turn around the curse and to redeem us back and that was the Lord Jesus that came by the spoken word and how are you coming this morning to be redeemed right exactly I put the word in your mouth you confess it that Jesus Christ is Lord you shall be saved a lot of people take that and they'll say hey they'll go to a bum on the street say just confess to the Lord you shall be saved just confess so there is the possibility that that person genuinely would rep p and that they could actually be saved but 95% of the time I don't know because they continue living the way they live
