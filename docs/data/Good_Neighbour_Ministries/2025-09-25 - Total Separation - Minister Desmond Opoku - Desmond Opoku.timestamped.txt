[26:02] Thank you. We're going to read our
[26:04] scripture
[26:05] from Numbers chapter 16
[26:10] verse one to 33. I think when I read 33,
[26:14] we got to see that. I still going to
[26:15] read a letter
[26:18] further down. So I pray you that the
[26:22] Lord will bless you and let us open our
[26:25] understanding and see what the Lord has
[26:27] for us.
[26:29] Father bless your word as we are about
[26:31] you in Jesus name.
[26:34] Now Ka the son of Isa
[26:40] the son of Kohhat the son of Levi
[26:45] and Dayton and Abram
[26:48] the son of Elia
[26:51] and on the son of Iot son of Reuben took
[26:58] men and they rose up before
[27:04] Moses.
[27:05] with a setting of the children of
[27:07] Israel. 250 princes of the assemble
[27:12] assembly famous in the congregation, men
[27:16] of rea. You understand? Say famous in
[27:20] the congregation,
[27:22] men of rea. Hallelujah.
[27:26] And they gathered themselves together
[27:29] against Moses and against Aaron, and
[27:33] said unto them, Ye take too much upon
[27:36] you, seeing all the congregation are
[27:39] holy.
[27:42] Everyone of them, and the Lord is among
[27:45] them.
[27:47] Wherefore then lift you up yourself
[27:51] above the congregation of the Lord. And
[27:54] when Moses heard this, he fell upon his
[27:57] face.
[27:59] And he spake unto Kora and unto all his
[28:02] company,
[28:05] saying, Even tomorrow the Lord will show
[28:09] who are his and who is holy.
[28:14] I will cause and will cause him to come
[28:17] near unto him. Even him who he had
[28:21] chosen will he cause to come near unto
[28:24] him. These two take he senses Kora and
[28:30] all his company and put fire therein and
[28:33] put incense in them before the Lord to
[28:37] tomorrow. And it shall be that the man
[28:40] who the Lord do choose he shall be holy.
[28:44] He take too much on you.
[28:48] You sons of Levi. And Moses said unto
[28:51] Kora, "Here I pray you, ye son of Levi,
[28:55] see it, see it, but a small thing unto
[29:00] you, that the Lord, the God of Israel,
[29:04] have separate you from the congregation
[29:07] of Israel, to bring you near to him, to
[29:11] do service to the tabernacle of the
[29:13] Lord, and to stand before the
[29:15] congregation, to minister unto them."
[29:18] And had brought thee near to him, and
[29:22] all thy breeding the sons of Levi with
[29:25] thee, and seek ye the priesthood also.
[29:29] For which cause both for both thou and
[29:33] all thy company are gathered together
[29:36] against the Lord? And what is Aaron
[29:40] that ye murmur against him? And Moses
[29:43] sent to call Dayan and Abraham the sons
[29:47] of
[29:49] push said we will not come up.
[29:54] These people are choosing themselves to
[29:57] rebel against God. Not Moses.
[30:03] Hallelujah. Is it small thing that thou
[30:06] has brought up brought us up out of the
[30:09] land that followed with milk and honey
[30:12] to kill us in the wilderness except thou
[30:14] make thyself together a prince over us?
[30:18] Moreover, thou has not brought us into a
[30:22] land that flowed with milk and honey and
[30:24] give us or given us inheritance or
[30:28] fields and vineyard. will thou put out
[30:32] the eyes of these men,
[30:34] they will not come out.
[30:37] And Moses was very wroth, and said unto
[30:40] the Lord, respect not thou their
[30:44] offering. I have not taken one from
[30:48] them, neither have I hurt one of them."
[30:53] And unto Kora, Be thou and all thy
[30:57] company before the Lord, how thou and
[31:00] they are, and they and Aaron tomorrow,
[31:05] and took every man his sensor, and put
[31:08] incense in them, and bring it before the
[31:11] Lord, every man his sensor. 250 senses,
[31:16] thou also in each of you has sensor. And
[31:20] they took every man a sensor and put
[31:24] fire on them and lay in there on and
[31:27] took in the door of the tabernacle of
[31:29] the congregation with Moses and Aaron.
[31:31] And Kora gathered all the congregation
[31:33] against against them into the door of
[31:37] the tabernacle of the congregation. And
[31:39] the and the glory of the glory of the
[31:42] Lord appear unto all the congregation.
[31:45] And the Lord spake unto Moses and and
[31:49] unto Aaron, saying, "Separate thyself
[31:52] from among this congregation, that I may
[31:55] consume them in a moment." And they fell
[31:59] upon their face and said, "Oh God,
[32:03] oh God of the spirit of all flesh, shall
[32:06] one man sin, and w thou be rough with
[32:10] all the congregation?" And the Lord
[32:13] spake unto Moses, saying, speak unto the
[32:15] congregation, saying, get up from about
[32:19] the tabernacle of Kora and Dayton and
[32:22] Moses rose up and went unto day and
[32:27] the elders of the Israelite follow him.
[32:30] You may be seated. Let me read. I don't
[32:32] want you to stand too long.
[32:35] Just listen what I'm reading because
[32:37] today I have a strange message and it's
[32:40] for everybody.
[32:41] Hallelujah. And he spake unto the
[32:43] congregation saying, "Depart, I pray you
[32:46] from the tents of these wicked men and
[32:49] touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be
[32:51] consumed in all their sins."
[32:56] So they sat up from the tabernacle of
[32:59] Kora, Dayton and Iberam, and every
[33:02] sight. And Dayton and Aberam came out
[33:04] and stood in the door of their tent and
[33:07] their wives and their sons and their
[33:10] little children. And Moses said, "Hereby
[33:13] ye shall know that the Lord has sent me
[33:17] to do all this work, for I have not done
[33:21] them of my own mind."
[33:26] If these men die the common death of all
[33:30] men or if they be visited after the
[33:34] visitation of all men, then the Lord has
[33:37] not sent me. But if the Lord make a new
[33:41] thing,
[33:42] and the earth opened her mouth, and
[33:45] swallowed them up with all that pertain
[33:49] unto them, and they go down quick into
[33:52] the pit, then ye shall understand
[33:56] that these men have provoked the Lord.
[34:01] And it came to pass as he had made an
[34:05] end of speaking all these words that the
[34:09] ground
[34:10] crave a cender that was under them. And
[34:16] the earth opened her mouth and swallowed
[34:18] them up and their houses and all their
[34:22] men that are pertain unto Kora and all
[34:25] their goods.
[34:27] Hallelujah.
[34:29] You know, you know what is what is the
[34:33] those grand opening and swallow them.
[34:37] This is the world.
[34:40] If you provoke God,
[34:44] God will not hear you.
[34:47] God will not listen to you. He will
[34:49] leave you to the world. That time the
[34:52] earth open and swallowed them. But now
[34:55] God is not open the earth and swallow
[34:57] you.
[35:00] We are in different different
[35:02] dispensation.
[35:04] God does not change. God mean business.
[35:08] You attack his servant, you attack him.
[35:12] This is very serious. That's why I said
[35:14] today message is not just a light
[35:19] message. It's a lesson for me and you.
[35:23] For what God has given to us, you have
[35:26] to cherish and embrace it. Hallelujah.
[35:31] Thank you, Lord.
[35:34] They and all their batten them down went
[35:38] alive into the pit and has closed upon
[35:42] them and they perished from among the
[35:45] congregation and all the Israelites were
[35:48] around about fled to the city of them.
[35:52] And for this, for they said, "Lest the
[35:55] earth surely up also."
[35:58] And there came out a fire from the Lord,
[36:02] and consumed the 250 men that offered
[36:07] the incense. And the Lord spake unto
[36:10] Moses. Speak unto Eleazar the son of
[36:13] Aram the praise that he take up the
[36:16] sensor out of the burning and scatter
[36:19] thou the yonder for they are hollow
[36:25] the senses of the is against their own
[36:28] souls. Let them make
[36:31] them blood plates for the covering
[36:35] that the altar that covering of the
[36:39] altar for they offered them before the
[36:41] Lord
[36:44] and they shall be a sign unto the
[36:48] children of Israel and the praise
[36:52] the praise. Okay, let me let me jump
[36:54] here. Let's go to 41. But on the moral
[36:58] all the congregation
[37:00] of the e the children of Israel mhammed
[37:03] against Moses and against Aaron.
[37:07] You see how rebarious the children of
[37:11] people the pe God people are rebarious.
[37:17] They were standing there and God
[37:19] swallowed them up but they still not
[37:22] learned lesson.
[37:24] God will never forgive none of us. He
[37:27] killed them. They were Israel. They were
[37:30] part of the congregation and God never
[37:33] spared them. Hallelujah.
[37:37] He have killed the people murmured
[37:40] against Moses and and saying, "Ye have
[37:42] killed the people of the Lord." And it
[37:44] came to pass when the congregation was
[37:46] gathered against Moses against they took
[37:50] they looked towards to the tabernacle of
[37:52] the congregation. And behold, the crowd
[37:55] covered. You know the why the crowd
[37:58] covered the the tabernacle? Because the
[38:00] tabernacle, the Bible said in the day
[38:03] God led them by a crowd cuz that God was
[38:08] in the tabernacle and the night by the
[38:11] pillar of fire. And that crowd is still
[38:14] here. The Holy Ghost
[38:18] is the same pillar of fire. He never
[38:20] changed. God never changed. Do you
[38:22] believe that God never changed?
[38:25] &gt;&gt; So if God never change what these people
[38:27] did and the children of God are doing
[38:31] the same thing, what to happen? You
[38:32] think God's going to spare us? No.
[38:36] Hallelujah. This message today is a
[38:38] warning to everybody
[38:40] because now is a serious time. There is
[38:43] no joke in the in the house of the Lord
[38:46] and there is no joke for the gospel of
[38:49] the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[38:57] Uh
[38:58] congregation. Behold, the crowd cover
[39:01] it, and the glory of the Lord appeared.
[39:03] And Moses and Aaron came before the
[39:05] tabernacle of the congregation.
[39:08] And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
[39:10] "Get you up from among this
[39:13] congregation, that I may consume them as
[39:17] in the moment." and they fell upon their
[39:20] faces. And Moses said unto Aaron, "Take
[39:23] the sensor and put fire therein from off
[39:27] the altar, and put a sensor, and go
[39:30] quickly into the congregation, and make
[39:34] atonement for them, for there is a rift
[39:37] gone out from the Lord." The page is
[39:41] begun.
[39:43] Hallelujah. God never spare you. If you
[39:47] speak against the servant of God whom
[39:50] God has given to you to lead you
[39:53] very very serious I don't know this
[39:57] message is is in my is burning in my
[40:00] heart
[40:02] if you believe Jesus Christ is the same
[40:05] yesterday today and forever listen what
[40:09] God is speaking I am a man I have no
[40:12] knowledge but I believe God and God
[40:16] speak through his what his gift.
[40:18] Hallelujah. Anybody who can stand here,
[40:22] do you believe that God sent that person
[40:24] to stand here? How many of you believe
[40:26] that?
[40:27] &gt;&gt; If you believe that, listen. Anybody who
[40:31] stand here, listen. That means God has
[40:34] something for he loves you. If God loves
[40:37] you, he chastise you. He warns you what
[40:42] is coming. Hallelujah.
[40:48] And Aaron took Moses
[40:51] and commanded
[40:54] commanded and ran into the midst of the
[40:57] congregation. And behold, the pledge was
[40:59] begun among the people. And he put a s
[41:03] put the incense and made atonement for
[41:06] the people. And he took between
[41:09] the dead and the living. And the pledge
[41:13] was stayed. Now they that died in the
[41:17] pledge was 14,000
[41:22] and 700. Beside them that that died
[41:27] about the matter of Kora and Aaron
[41:31] returned to Moses unto the door of the
[41:34] tabernacle and the congregation and the
[41:37] pledge was saved.
[41:40] You see the work of a pastor,
[41:45] the work of a man whom God has
[41:49] designated
[41:51] to lead you.
[41:54] He always stand between God and the
[41:59] congregation. What he does? He protect
[42:02] them. Do you believe your pastor
[42:05] protects you?
[42:07] Do you really believe your pastor
[42:09] protects you? Do you believe that your
[42:12] pastor God sent your pastor to lead you?
[42:15] &gt;&gt; If you believe that, listen to this
[42:17] message tonight.
[42:20] Hallelujah.
[42:22] Thank you, Lord. I just stop here.
[42:26] My message today
[42:29] is total separation.
[42:34] Total separation.
[42:39] You know David and Cola
[42:43] was they were congregation member.
[42:48] They believed
[42:50] they listen
[42:52] the same message that all of them listen
[42:56] from who? Moses. God give messages to
[43:01] Moses because God only chose Moses.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; God didn't p
[43:12] choose two people
[43:14] to lead his people because two people
[43:18] their mind. God know how he made
[43:21] everybody.
[43:24] God always choose one person to lead his
[43:29] people because God does not confuse.
[43:35] And now this modern age
[43:39] sometime
[43:41] the pastor get so much load and sometime
[43:45] he choose
[43:47] sometime a man renown man
[43:51] that he think when he goes out or when
[43:55] he's not there somebody can stand beside
[44:00] stand on the pulpit for him
[44:03] to lead the people.
[44:06] How did Dayton and Kora Kora warn the
[44:10] people's heart?
[44:12] They warn them by speaking to them and
[44:17] win their heart and he get much
[44:20] following. You see, you see it was not a
[44:23] a just a small people.
[44:26] Just one time it was 14,000
[44:30] outside the first one he killed.
[44:34] That mean this these people went to all
[44:38] the congregation where the pastor is
[44:40] preaching. Some people go for
[44:42] fellowship. Some people go went around
[44:46] the pastor
[44:48] and minister different what the pastor
[44:50] is preaching to them. And the people
[44:54] listen because they were men that they
[44:57] old they look mature. They has wisdom
[45:01] but that wisdom was deadly. wasn't from
[45:03] God because God said Moses is my
[45:06] servant.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; Listen to Moses.
[45:11] He is my servant. I chose him to lead
[45:14] you.
[45:16] So if God give you a pastor,
[45:19] listen to his word
[45:21] &gt;&gt; so that we don't fall into this because
[45:24] God does not change. God love his
[45:27] children. But anybody who will come
[45:31] against his children, God will never
[45:33] spare you. I'm telling you this is real.
[45:37] Know that
[45:39] if you know brother Abraham message, you
[45:42] know the people who take people away
[45:45] from the congregation is the people whom
[45:48] the pastor love and he left
[45:52] behind.
[45:54] said if I'm not there you are the one
[45:58] that you took
[46:00] in Africa if you go there are so many
[46:04] churches that what because the man the
[46:08] pastor trusted this man and he preached
[46:11] the message correct fantastic
[46:14] meanwhile I he went through the
[46:18] congregation by the time the pastor knew
[46:22] he wound sometime It takes the people
[46:26] who are rich or who are
[46:34] renown in the church, respected in the
[46:37] church, he wound their heart and take
[46:40] them away and destroy and take them out.
[46:45] Let me tell you, God will never spare
[46:48] anybody who does that. They have to go
[46:52] to God and repent
[46:54] &gt;&gt; that God will give it to them to the
[46:58] today message goes to everywhere, every
[47:01] church, every congregation, every
[47:05] minister.
[47:06] Hallelujah.
[47:09] Today this message when I bring I
[47:12] struggle but I know God has given me
[47:16] there's a warning
[47:18] that is coming God loves you we are
[47:22] about to go home
[47:24] &gt;&gt; all what I'm telling you stay with the
[47:27] word
[47:29] &gt;&gt; and God will never leave you
[47:32] &gt;&gt; we have walked so far
[47:35] &gt;&gt; we have reached a point of no 10.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; All what we have to get together in one
[47:43] accord. If we get together one accord
[47:46] and follow the shepherd, you will see
[47:49] what will happen to this church.
[47:53] And I feel the presence of God in this
[47:56] church.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; God is leading us.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:04] This man,
[48:06] God never forgave them.
[48:09] God told them, "You
[48:12] Kora
[48:14] told Moses, bring all the people." And
[48:17] Moses said, "If God choose you, God
[48:21] going to prove it."
[48:23] And he brought all of them there.
[48:26] And after that, instead of them to go to
[48:30] Moses
[48:32] and apologize for what they did
[48:38] or if you did something
[48:42] and
[48:45] it came out instead of you to go to the
[48:48] pastor
[48:50] and make things right, the people do not
[48:54] do it.
[48:57] They think that thing going to cover, it
[48:59] will never cover in the eyes of God.
[49:04] God want you to make things right. Even
[49:07] all your own brother on your own sister,
[49:11] you do something for your own brother on
[49:13] your own sister. The Bible said you have
[49:15] to go to him
[49:18] and do things right.
[49:21] Then God will hear your prayer. You know
[49:24] this time why God did not hear people
[49:28] with prayer
[49:31] and God answer every prayer.
[49:36] If you don't do right and repented,
[49:41] you're going to think
[49:44] you're lack of something but you are
[49:47] blocking your own prayer.
[49:51] I'm just telling you live right
[49:56] be happy
[49:58] joy don't put nothing in your heart
[50:01] against your brother or your sister
[50:03] don't talk don't murmuring against your
[50:06] pastor or any elder if you can't go call
[50:11] your deacon
[50:13] let your deacon take the matter and talk
[50:17] to the pastor and pastor is there to
[50:20] protect You
[50:24] God build them
[50:27] like a mother
[50:30] who
[50:32] how can a mother against her own
[50:36] children or it will never happen. They
[50:39] always die for them.
[50:41] When we were young, when there is no
[50:44] food home, my mother will make make us
[50:49] to eat the food and if he has to eat
[50:53] nothing for the whole night, he will
[50:55] give the food for us to eat so that we
[50:58] he will stand there and not eat. Why?
[51:01] The love that he has for us, the love
[51:04] that God has for you,
[51:07] he gave you a pastor.
[51:11] I'm speaking this in general. In this
[51:15] church, I don't see anything like that.
[51:18] But this is what God has placed in my
[51:21] heart.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:24] God loves you.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; God cares for you.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[51:31] Amen.
[51:32] Then
[51:36] God does not change his word.
[51:40] What he did to them,
[51:42] he does not change. You know, God does
[51:45] not change his word. Hallelujah.
[51:49] I think today I will never finish this
[51:51] message because this message at the end
[51:55] you're going to you're going to know how
[51:58] much God loves you. Hallelujah.
[52:03] Amen.
[52:07] God chooses servant to lead the saints
[52:10] of God.
[52:12] Sometime
[52:13] people underestimate
[52:16] what God has given to them. You know the
[52:19] old days if you read the Bible
[52:23] sometimes
[52:25] a small boy small man
[52:29] the big people are there but they put a
[52:32] small boy to be their king to lead them.
[52:36] Why? God knows why he put them there.
[52:41] to lead the big people.
[52:44] So God know why he give the pastors to
[52:48] the church. God call pastors.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:55] And you know sometime when the people
[52:59] the pastor trust somebody in the church
[53:02] and he handle everything to them to them
[53:05] to help them. It's not because they have
[53:09] bad thing but they give themsel of
[53:12] jealousy for Satan to come in
[53:16] and anoint them.
[53:18] Do you know
[53:20] when uh uh uh Ahab
[53:24] and uh uh one of the prophet Micaiah
[53:31] when
[53:33] God uh Jehoshaphat want to hear from God
[53:36] and he called Micaiah
[53:38] and Micaiah
[53:40] gave them the message from God. They
[53:43] refused to listen. And Makiah said
[53:46] because God sent
[53:49] false anointing from heaven to anoint
[53:52] your prophet to give it to you the
[53:55] message
[53:59] because they don't want to hear the
[54:01] prophet. They rejected what God has
[54:03] given to them.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; God does not change.
[54:09] God is the same yesterday, today and
[54:12] forever. He does not change.
[54:16] So God has chosen us. We are his people.
[54:21] Remember all the congregation of Israel,
[54:24] they were all God people. He said, "I
[54:27] chose Moses to lead my people."
[54:32] They were congregation.
[54:35] God chose them.
[54:37] But if you listen and stay under the
[54:41] ministry
[54:43] whom God has given to you,
[54:46] you are blessed.
[54:48] Everything that you do is going to be
[54:51] prosperous.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; God will prosper you way.
[54:59] If you want to be prosperous,
[55:02] you have to stay with the word of God
[55:05] and obey the elder, the pastor,
[55:08] especially the pastor whom God has given
[55:11] to you. If you, brother Abraham said, if
[55:14] you think he's off because the love that
[55:19] you have for him, God will turn him
[55:21] around
[55:23] and preach exactly what God want him to
[55:26] preach. Amen.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Because God, you are the children of
[55:32] God.
[55:34] Let me tell you, God is real.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; He does not change. I see. He does not
[55:40] change.
[55:42] What he did to them is a lesson from
[55:47] that day up to the time when we go
[55:50] through the rapture.
[55:55] Hallelujah.
[56:00] Sometime
[56:03] to my understanding
[56:06] not every minister
[56:08] love one another.
[56:11] But I stay in this ministry for a long
[56:15] time.
[56:16] I know people who preach in the pulpit
[56:20] of brother Simon, Pastor Simon.
[56:24] They pastor Simon heart is free. He
[56:27] allowed them to minister on his on his
[56:30] pulpit and they still don't love him.
[56:35] Now what can he do? He's a a servant of
[56:39] God.
[56:42] What the minister is doing
[56:45] is between him and God.
[56:49] But that person will never go free.
[56:54] Any minister that break churches
[56:56] sometime we we quote the scripture
[57:01] this scripture we always quote this
[57:04] scripture for marriage people
[57:09] what God has put together let no man put
[57:13] it ascender
[57:15] &gt;&gt; because there
[57:17] meaning
[57:19] who put church together say man or god
[57:23] &gt;&gt; if god put
[57:25] build his church and he put a minister
[57:28] and you come and put that ascender.
[57:31] Don't you know they have a curse on you?
[57:34] You bring it. No matter what you do, you
[57:37] going to answer
[57:40] not God does not forget nothing.
[57:43] Sometime they do that and some of the
[57:45] congregation went back
[57:48] where the earth open and swallowed them.
[57:52] What the world take them? They going to
[57:55] go to church no more.
[57:57] Who calls that? That minister. Who does
[58:01] that? This is a dangerous and dangerous
[58:05] dangerous
[58:07] that a minister could stand and preach
[58:11] against
[58:12] the pastor who is
[58:15] God have placed him on the pit to lead
[58:17] the children.
[58:19] Some ministers gathered together and
[58:22] gang against some of the ministers.
[58:26] God, this church here that brother Brown
[58:29] brought is not a denomination.
[58:32] God choose a minister and he gave him
[58:35] the word that the people need his
[58:37] congregation need. Your mother know the
[58:40] food that he gave it to you to grown up.
[58:43] You don't eat the strangest food.
[58:47] He always she always prepare food for
[58:50] you. Am I lying? Your mother put you
[58:54] love your mother food. Roti a lot of
[58:57] pepper you can eat but that person can
[59:00] eat.
[59:02] That's the way it is.
[59:05] Lasagna. Maybe I don't like lasagna but
[59:09] that's why he cook for his children. He
[59:12] doesn't he doesn't care whether you like
[59:15] it or not. This is my children. This is
[59:17] what I feed them. Is it you are
[59:20] responsible to see what he's feeding for
[59:22] his children? No. God is is God is
[59:26] responding for him. When the a time
[59:29] came, God said, "Stand back.
[59:34] Separate. Separate yourself." God
[59:37] separated them.
[59:40] Before God killed them, he separated
[59:43] them.
[59:44] You stand here and you stand here.
[59:48] And the Bible say where they were
[59:50] standing standing the earth open
[59:54] underneath them. There's no escape. And
[59:57] what happened?
[59:59] It swallowed them all of them inside.
[1:00:04] And after that the people saw instead of
[1:00:09] them to go to God and apologize to Moses
[1:00:13] to pray for them, they went around
[1:00:18] and go to God by themselves.
[1:00:21] And God say, "Okay, let them come.
[1:00:25] Let them come."
[1:00:28] And what happened?
[1:00:30] God was standing there for them to come.
[1:00:33] As soon as they came, they came.
[1:00:36] Moses saw there's another second wipe
[1:00:40] away.
[1:00:42] As a pastor always said, it's not the
[1:00:45] congregation.
[1:00:48] It doesn't matter what two or three
[1:00:50] people sitting here. What God gave you
[1:00:52] to him is what he going to preach to
[1:00:54] you.
[1:00:55] because he's responsible for one or two
[1:00:58] people who can stand for God.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is your responsible
[1:01:05] to know where you stand
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; to get out from this pledge that is
[1:01:10] about to happen.
[1:01:15] God, this message
[1:01:17] is God himself.
[1:01:20] It's not you. It's not me.
[1:01:24] is not a pastor. God build the church
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; and the gate of hell cannot prevail
[1:01:30] against it.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Is the Holy Ghost in here?
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; It's not a pastor here. Is the Holy
[1:01:37] Ghost in the pastor?
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Feeding the Holy Ghost children.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; So if you want to stay here, stay with a
[1:01:49] pure heart.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Let the Holy Ghost flow.
[1:01:54] And you're going to see the hand of God
[1:01:56] in our midst.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you believe that?
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:05] Thank you, Lord. Blessed be the name of
[1:02:08] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:02:12] Paul said
[1:02:14] in the midst of us
[1:02:17] the grievous
[1:02:19] wolf.
[1:02:20] If you read the book of Act
[1:02:23] 20
[1:02:25] 19 to 29 to 30 he said the grievous he
[1:02:29] was talking about the Ephesians the
[1:02:32] grievous wolf
[1:02:35] will come in. Who are the grievous wolf?
[1:02:38] It's not you that sitting there, the
[1:02:40] ministers
[1:02:43] that will go around and try to catch the
[1:02:47] weak ones among us.
[1:02:51] They will stand on the pulpit and preach
[1:02:54] the gospel.
[1:02:57] And if you weak and you don't stay with
[1:03:00] the word of God, by the time you he
[1:03:02] wound your heart,
[1:03:04] Dayton and caller, he took your way.
[1:03:08] The same thing what Satan did in the
[1:03:11] garden of when in the heaven from the
[1:03:15] beginning he never changed. That's the
[1:03:17] tactics he is using today too.
[1:03:22] He went among them. The Bible says Satan
[1:03:25] went among the congregation
[1:03:27] and he wound he
[1:03:30] the heart of onethird of the angel and
[1:03:34] took them away and brought them down.
[1:03:36] That's the devils that we are dealing
[1:03:38] with right now here.
[1:03:41] Let me tell you, we are in the spiritual
[1:03:44] war.
[1:03:46] Let God open your understanding.
[1:03:50] I tell you these things here, this
[1:03:52] message,
[1:03:53] this message.
[1:03:57] John the Baptist
[1:04:02] when the John the Baptist came
[1:04:06] The Lord, he is the one
[1:04:09] introduced the Lord Jesus Christ, right?
[1:04:14] As soon as he introduced the Lord Jesus
[1:04:17] Christ is finished.
[1:04:20] The ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:24] what? Grews up.
[1:04:28] He preached the gospel. You after that
[1:04:31] you never hear John the Baptist name
[1:04:33] again.
[1:04:36] All what you hear is the Lord Jesus
[1:04:38] Christ.
[1:04:40] The spirit of Elijah introduce
[1:04:44] the Lord Jesus Christ. Cuz John the
[1:04:46] Baptist was the spirit of Elijah that
[1:04:49] was upon him.
[1:04:52] Introduce the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:04:55] And then the Lord Jesus Christ preached
[1:04:58] the gospel to everywhere.
[1:05:01] How many people he got before he left
[1:05:03] the world?
[1:05:05] 12.
[1:05:08] The whole jud thousands of people. How
[1:05:12] many he got? 12.
[1:05:15] He came to separate them. He did a
[1:05:19] separation. So he took the best of them.
[1:05:23] All what he he want, he took all of
[1:05:27] them. Do you think the rapture will take
[1:05:29] the whole churches?
[1:05:32] No, today I heard in the news somebody
[1:05:35] said the rapture will happen today and
[1:05:37] we are still here.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Let nobody fools you.
[1:05:43] The disciple didn't know when the Lord
[1:05:45] Jesus Christ will go up. They never knew
[1:05:50] all what they knew said we are going to
[1:05:52] where they were going straight down to
[1:05:55] like a straight to Bethany
[1:05:57] was close to Bethany.
[1:06:00] while he was there. Then he gave them
[1:06:01] their last message and before they they
[1:06:04] realized he was going. And the Bible
[1:06:06] says when the Lord Jesus Christ came
[1:06:09] down, he went to hell and took those
[1:06:14] saints that was bound there. So when he
[1:06:17] was going,
[1:06:18] he to he went with them.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, God rich in mercy.
[1:06:27] If the apostles
[1:06:30] the Holy Ghost was was released unto
[1:06:34] them, they will never remain because
[1:06:36] they were part of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:06:38] They will go with them.
[1:06:42] You know,
[1:06:45] brother Abraham,
[1:06:47] that's a Malaka 4. Maka 31 was John the
[1:06:53] Baptist. Malachi 4:5 The same spirit of
[1:06:58] Elijah said he will come back again for
[1:07:02] our time.
[1:07:07] Hallelujah.
[1:07:09] And he came.
[1:07:12] I'm going to play a cassette for you to
[1:07:14] hear.
[1:07:17] He came.
[1:07:20] Why?
[1:07:22] because you are here. When he came,
[1:07:27] remember, just put in your mind when
[1:07:31] John the Baptist
[1:07:34] baptized the Lord Jesus Christ and the
[1:07:36] Holy Ghost came the Lord ministry.
[1:07:41] God was with them and preached to them
[1:07:45] till the day
[1:07:47] that he has to go to heaven. He never
[1:07:50] lead the saint
[1:07:53] and when he was going he went those
[1:07:57] people who were ready
[1:07:59] and he went with them. Now
[1:08:03] when the Lord Jesus Christ came back
[1:08:06] again for me and you cut a little I I
[1:08:10] cut little short here. You know I'm I'm
[1:08:13] cutting off. I have a lot of but I'm
[1:08:14] cutting off. I want to finish that.
[1:08:20] In the in the United States when Abraham
[1:08:25] was baptizing
[1:08:28] in the Ohio River, can you pray that
[1:08:31] cassette before I continue?
[1:08:36] And you hear
[1:08:41] this message is a court trial.
[1:08:45] a court try
[1:08:48] and if you have a time you can listen to
[1:08:50] that message. It's a blessing.
[1:08:54] Hallelujah.
[1:09:00] God is doing separation right now.
[1:09:06] So this message
[1:09:10] be listen
[1:09:12] and stay alert.
[1:09:14] So that
[1:09:16] when the time come you will know because
[1:09:19] we don't have enough time to stay.
[1:09:24] Hallelujah.
[1:09:27] The court trial
[1:09:30] 1964.
[1:09:37] Hallelujah.
[1:09:58] Hallelujah.
[1:10:15] I want the world to see that this
[1:10:18] message. It didn't came. We are not
[1:10:21] sitting here by ourselves. It's God
[1:10:24] himself has come down and is with us.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; I remember down there when I was a
[1:10:29] little boy,
[1:10:31] you've read my life story. You know the
[1:10:33] story. I remember on the river down
[1:10:35] there when I was a young Baptist
[1:10:37] preacher. I was baptized there about
[1:10:39] 10,000 people standing on the bank. And
[1:10:41] one afternoon my first great revival
[1:10:44] somewhat around a thousand converts and
[1:10:46] I was baptizing him out there in the
[1:10:48] water. The 17th person I was leading out
[1:10:50] into the water I heard a noise and I
[1:10:52] looked around. It's hot is on June 1933
[1:10:55] at the foot of Spring Street in
[1:10:56] Jeffersonville, Indiana. I was leading
[1:10:58] them out there in the banks all up and
[1:11:00] down. We're just crowded with people. I
[1:11:02] walk out and this little boy had seen
[1:11:04] him at the altar. I said, "Son, have you
[1:11:06] accepted Jesus Christ to be your
[1:11:07] personal savior?" He said, "I have." His
[1:11:09] name is Edward Calvin. And I said,
[1:11:11] "Edward, do you know what I'm doing
[1:11:13] now?" He said, "I do, brother Brandon."
[1:11:15] I said, "I am baptizing you,
[1:11:19] showing to this audience out here that
[1:11:22] you've accepted Christ as your personal
[1:11:23] savior. When I baptize you in the name
[1:11:26] of Jesus Christ, you take on his name.
[1:11:28] You rise for a new life. And when you
[1:11:30] leave here, you're to walk in new life."
[1:11:32] Do you understand that, Edward? He said,
[1:11:33] "I do." I said, "Bow your head." I said,
[1:11:36] "Heavenly Father, as this young man has
[1:11:38] confessed his faith in you, and as thou
[1:11:41] has commissioned us to go into all the
[1:11:42] world and preach the gospel, baptize
[1:11:44] them into the name of the Father, Son,
[1:11:45] and Holy Ghost, commission them to
[1:11:47] believe all things which you have
[1:11:49] taught. I therefore baptize thee, my
[1:11:51] beloved brother, in the name of the Lord
[1:11:53] Jesus Christ." As I laid him into the
[1:11:55] water, I come up, I heard something
[1:11:56] going.
[1:11:58] I looked at the crowd. I heard a voice
[1:12:00] saying, "Look up."
[1:12:02] I thought, "What is that Billy here? his
[1:12:05] mother two or three years before we was
[1:12:07] married. She was standing there. I seen
[1:12:08] her face white. She had a camera in her
[1:12:09] hand. Look up. I heard it the second
[1:12:12] time. I was scared. I looked around the
[1:12:16] people standing there just looking just
[1:12:18] dumbfounded. I heard it say again, "Look
[1:12:20] up." And when I looked, here come that
[1:12:23] same pillar of fire that led Israel
[1:12:25] through the wilderness. Thousands of
[1:12:27] eyes looking at it come right down over
[1:12:28] where I was standing. It said as John
[1:12:30] the Baptist has sent forth to forrun the
[1:12:32] first coming of Christ. Your message
[1:12:34] shall cover the earth and forerrun the
[1:12:36] second coming of Christ.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; That went into the newspaper on the
[1:12:39] Associated Press. Dr. Lee Bale here this
[1:12:41] afternoon picked it up plumbing Canada
[1:12:42] and around local Baptist preacher while
[1:12:44] baptizing a mystic light appears over
[1:12:47] right down in Dallas, Texas or Houston,
[1:12:49] Texas a few years ago when people
[1:12:51] doubted it and hardly know what to do. A
[1:12:54] fine Baptist preacher wanted a debate
[1:12:55] with brother Bossworth. There was no
[1:12:56] such as divine healing. when he lost the
[1:12:58] debate by 100%. He said, "Let me see
[1:13:01] this divine healer come forth and
[1:13:02] perform."
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; I come down to the balcony. I said, "I
[1:13:06] am not a divine, sir."
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; I said, "You wouldn't want to be called
[1:13:08] a divine savior." I said,
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; "You see,
[1:13:14] as John departed fall the first coming
[1:13:17] of the Lord Jesus, so your ministry will
[1:13:19] fall the second coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:13:23] Christ."
[1:13:25] So this gospel that we are standing
[1:13:27] under we are not worshiping man
[1:13:32] is the same ministry that Paul
[1:13:36] Peter all of them receive in the day of
[1:13:40] Pentecost the same ministry.
[1:13:44] And right now do you believe that the
[1:13:48] Lord Jesus Christ didn't go back because
[1:13:51] when he came down Peter and all of them
[1:13:55] time he finished the gospel first and
[1:13:58] before he left and when he left he went
[1:14:01] with the saint that were ready. So he is
[1:14:04] still here. He didn't went again. God is
[1:14:09] still here and God is in his people. God
[1:14:14] is in his ministers. He chose them
[1:14:18] as he chose Paul, Peter, John,
[1:14:24] James, all of them to minister the
[1:14:28] gospel.
[1:14:31] So I'm telling you, the Lord Jesus
[1:14:34] Christ is still here right now.
[1:14:38] He hasn't gone yet.
[1:14:41] The time he will leave this earth here,
[1:14:45] all the saints whom he has gathered
[1:14:48] together,
[1:14:50] he will go with them. That's we call the
[1:14:53] rapture.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the same thing.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; He came down John the Baptist time.
[1:15:03] He stood there and minister unto them
[1:15:06] and do signs and wonders with them till
[1:15:10] he says stay. I will send the comfort of
[1:15:13] the spirit that will come back and the
[1:15:17] last days I will come back again by
[1:15:20] myself and this is the last days that
[1:15:23] you heard it as John the Baptist fall
[1:15:26] around the first coming of the Lord
[1:15:27] Jesus Christ. So this ministry will fall
[1:15:30] around the second coming of the Lord
[1:15:32] Jesus Christ. It's not brother Abraham.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; It's the same Jesus.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you believe that?
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus Christ is still here.
[1:15:45] If you stay with him, you will see him.
[1:15:51] Do you know when the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:55] resurrected before he he went with the
[1:15:57] saints and went up?
[1:16:00] When he came back to comfort the saints,
[1:16:03] they were scared. They couldn't believe
[1:16:05] them. If you read Matthew 25
[1:16:12] down,
[1:16:15] he went
[1:16:17] and they couldn't believe he didn't.
[1:16:18] They were scared.
[1:16:20] And you know what? What he did? He said,
[1:16:23] "Give me food to eat."
[1:16:26] They did give him food and he eat in
[1:16:29] front of them.
[1:16:32] He ate that food in front of them. The
[1:16:34] same time he was a spirit. The same
[1:16:37] thing he did to Abraham. God was God.
[1:16:40] But he eat with he ate with Abraham.
[1:16:44] My friend, this gospel is not a joke.
[1:16:48] This gospel is real.
[1:16:51] Last week I was telling them in in a
[1:16:54] prayer meeting
[1:16:56] a young man
[1:16:59] he was he was uh doing his last exams.
[1:17:05] The same time he was doing his last
[1:17:07] exams
[1:17:09] he has a problem with a heart. Bad
[1:17:13] problem. They took him to to the
[1:17:15] hospital. They checked, they couldn't
[1:17:16] find nothing. And the boy was going
[1:17:19] through pain and they said he has to go
[1:17:21] to the a big hospital to do a special
[1:17:26] test for the heart. So the father called
[1:17:29] me and I said, "Let the boy call me."
[1:17:32] The boy called me.
[1:17:35] When he called me, I said, "Do you
[1:17:37] believe the Lord Jesus can help you?
[1:17:40] He can heal you. At the same time he can
[1:17:43] help you and bring your memory back for
[1:17:46] the exams that you are going to do. He
[1:17:48] said yes I believe.
[1:17:51] I pray with him.
[1:17:53] I pray with him on the phone
[1:17:58] and last about a week ago he called me
[1:18:02] and thanked me. He said when I pray with
[1:18:05] him the church stopped.
[1:18:08] Now the medication that the doctors gave
[1:18:10] it to him, he doesn't need them because
[1:18:13] he have no pain. So he throw all the
[1:18:15] medication out. You think it's brother
[1:18:18] Desmond? No, I have no power.
[1:18:23] I have no education.
[1:18:25] But I believe the Lord Jesus Christ. I
[1:18:29] believe the same message that Paul
[1:18:31] preached, brother Brian preached is the
[1:18:34] same here for you and me. And the same
[1:18:37] gospel
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; that the Lord Jesus Christ preached to
[1:18:43] the the saint there Braman preached to
[1:18:46] us and he demonstrated the Lord Jesus
[1:18:48] Christ for us because he was living on
[1:18:51] the scene said this is what is going to
[1:18:53] happen to you if you believe
[1:18:59] he is doing the same thing.
[1:19:03] You can see him you know he show himself
[1:19:06] to the disciple. If God want to show
[1:19:08] himself to you, he will show himself
[1:19:11] visible to you.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; What God wants to do, your heart desire,
[1:19:16] God will do it.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; God can heal every sick.
[1:19:24] When I went to Africa, another one
[1:19:26] there.
[1:19:28] I was about about a month or a month and
[1:19:31] a half ago.
[1:19:33] I went to brother Kofi's area there. I
[1:19:36] witnessed people.
[1:19:39] So one night I went to Manasim. Brother
[1:19:42] Robert preached there and straight down
[1:19:45] took a car straight down to that place
[1:19:47] because I witnessed about six or seven
[1:19:49] place. This was a 2 hours drive and the
[1:19:53] resi place when you go is a whining area
[1:19:56] like that.
[1:19:58] if you pass a certain a certain area and
[1:20:01] they said the the road is not good. I
[1:20:03] said good or no good I'm going waiting
[1:20:06] for me.
[1:20:08] Me and the brother one brother we went
[1:20:12] and when I went they were all ready in
[1:20:14] the room I opened the Bible I unveiled
[1:20:18] the Lord Jesus Christ onto them even
[1:20:20] they ready to be baptized.
[1:20:23] All of them are ready. I have two pe two
[1:20:25] places that people are ready to be
[1:20:27] baptized
[1:20:29] now and when I went there I minister
[1:20:33] unto them and when I'm finished minister
[1:20:37] and we are we about to leave so almost
[1:20:40] night and the road is not good I said
[1:20:43] and then they brought a six-year-old
[1:20:48] said dumb boy dumb he cannot hear he
[1:20:51] cannot speak
[1:20:54] for me to pray for him. You think I'm
[1:20:56] scared? I'm not ashamed for this gospel.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; If I pray for you, God know what he's
[1:21:03] going to do. Not me doing it. I don't
[1:21:06] look at myself. Whatever you think is up
[1:21:09] to you.
[1:21:12] So they brought I hold that boy head
[1:21:16] and I pray to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:21:20] to show himself to these people
[1:21:23] that is the same yesterday, today and
[1:21:25] forever. If it's God that does not
[1:21:27] change, he will show himself to that
[1:21:30] people there for them to believe that
[1:21:33] the message that we are in is not a
[1:21:36] Catholic. It's not denominational. It's
[1:21:39] the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; And I pray for him. And when I came back
[1:21:49] a month and a half I I for a little
[1:21:51] while when I came back a month and a
[1:21:53] half ago I had I had a call
[1:21:56] and I was talking then I I I I
[1:22:00] said how is the boy doing? They said yes
[1:22:03] I talk to him.
[1:22:05] They give that phone to the boy and I
[1:22:08] was talking with the boy on the phone
[1:22:12] and the boy don't want to go from the
[1:22:15] phone talking to me. Somebody who does
[1:22:18] not talk who are not here now he's in
[1:22:20] school learning. Is it the same Jesus
[1:22:24] Christ yesterday, today and forever?
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Is it the same thing he did under the
[1:22:30] ministry of brother Abraham?
[1:22:32] Who did brother Abraham or the Lord
[1:22:34] Jesus Christ?
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; So the Lord Jesus Christ is here to use
[1:22:40] you and me.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; When I talk this here, I feel goose but
[1:22:47] my now my skin is is tight with with my
[1:22:50] body right now because I believe it
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; and I see it and I know it's real.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; He want to use you and me. How much more
[1:23:01] we need?
[1:23:03] Let us follow our pastor.
[1:23:07] Do not m against him.
[1:23:11] Hold his hand.
[1:23:14] Don't
[1:23:16] mama against your brother, your sister.
[1:23:19] Love one another. That's what brother
[1:23:22] Abraham said. All this is based of love.
[1:23:27] If you love your brother or your sister,
[1:23:30] you always do what? Pray for him. Enjoy
[1:23:33] with them. Never mind how much what they
[1:23:35] do to you. Jesus said, "Father, forgive
[1:23:39] them. They know not what they do.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Have mercy upon them."
[1:23:46] Hallelujah. Do you believe that?
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; We are close to the rapture.

[1:24:10] long.

[1:25:31] When the Son of man shall come in his
[1:25:33] glory, and all the holy angels with him,
[1:25:37] then shall he sit upon the throne of his
[1:25:40] glory, and before him shall be gather
[1:25:43] all nations, and he shall separate them
[1:25:48] one from another.
[1:25:51] God said when he come, he will separate
[1:25:53] one from another.
[1:25:56] Hallelujah.
[1:25:59] as a sheep divided as as a head divided
[1:26:03] his sheep from the goats. And he shall
[1:26:07] set the sheep on the right hand, but the
[1:26:11] goat on the left. Then shall the king
[1:26:14] say unto them on his right hand, come ye
[1:26:19] blessed of my father, inherit the
[1:26:21] kingdom prepared for you from
[1:26:26] the foundation of the world. For I was
[1:26:30] an hunger and you gave me meat. I was
[1:26:34] test and you gave me drink. I was a
[1:26:37] stranger and you took me in. naked and
[1:26:42] ye clothed me. I was sick and ye visited
[1:26:45] me. I was in prison and you came to me.
[1:26:49] Then shall the righteous answer him and
[1:26:52] saying, Lord, when so we thee in hunger,
[1:26:57] and fed thee or test, and give thee
[1:27:00] drink,
[1:27:02] when
[1:27:04] when saw we thee a stranger, and took
[1:27:08] thee in, and naked, and clothe thee. Uh
[1:27:12] or when we saw when when saw we this
[1:27:17] sick or in prison and came unto thee.
[1:27:21] And the king shall answer and say unto
[1:27:24] them, verily I say unto you, in so much
[1:27:28] you have done it unto one of the least
[1:27:32] of these my brethren, ye have done it
[1:27:35] unto me.
[1:27:37] Then shall ye say also unto them that
[1:27:40] are in the left hand, depart from me, ye
[1:27:43] cursed
[1:27:45] into everlasting fire. Prepare ye the
[1:27:49] devil and his angels.
[1:27:53] The same way they turn on the rest he
[1:27:57] went down. The same way the people who
[1:28:01] stood with Moses
[1:28:05] and
[1:28:06] Joshua
[1:28:08] they were enter into the land
[1:28:12] with milk flow with milk and honey. So
[1:28:15] we who will stay the word he said we're
[1:28:19] going to be on his right hand side. Do
[1:28:22] you want his right hand side or you want
[1:28:24] his left hand side?
[1:28:26] is a question that I left on you in your
[1:28:31] heart.

[1:40:38] the tough is here.
[1:40:43] He has
[1:40:46] to leave God's ego.
[1:40:50] And I know
[1:40:53] he will guide me.
[1:40:57] And
