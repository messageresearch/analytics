[24:59] with our true identity you know when

[25:05] world and we're dealing with situations
[25:07] and family and
[25:09] circumstances you know you just tend to
[25:12] focus in on those things and forget
[25:15] you know our true identity and
[25:17] what it is that god is really doing in
[25:19] our lives
[25:20] because he is um
[25:22] constantly working
[25:24] on every aspect of our lives
[25:26] and he has one goal one purpose one plan
[25:30] and
[25:32] that is to
[25:33] take us
[25:35] in a rapture
[25:37] in this age amen praise god and that's
[25:40] what we need to get refocused back on
[25:43] amen to keep that at the forefront of
[25:45] our lives at all times understanding
[25:48] god's purpose god's will god's desire
[25:52] for his children
[25:54] that plan will never change
[25:57] he decided
[25:58] from before the foundations of the world
[26:00] exactly what he was going to do
[26:03] and nothing has changed
[26:06] because he is the same yesterday today
[26:08] and forever he cannot
[26:10] think something
[26:12] and then
[26:13] change his mind
[26:14] amen all he can do is look down through
[26:17] time
[26:18] and see exactly
[26:20] each and every one of us coming into our
[26:22] rightful positions as sons and daughters
[26:25] of god finding our place in the word of
[26:28] god recognizing that we're actually not
[26:32] you know the human beings that we think
[26:35] that we constantly battle against that
[26:38] we constantly have to overcome
[26:40] amen praise god
[26:42] glory to god so tonight we're going to
[26:44] go to the word of god and um
[26:47] we're going to be looking

[26:52] so so our title uh this evening is this
[26:56] is your time

[27:02] this is you know we've always heard
[27:04] recognizing your day and its message
[27:07] well
[27:07] you know a lot of people will uh look at
[27:10] that phrase and they'll identify it as
[27:12] oh well we've recognized that god sent a
[27:15] prophet and um you know that
[27:18] he brought certain messages and all we
[27:20] needed to do was to recognize that god
[27:22] sent a prophet and that's good enough
[27:24] i'm going in the rapture now i'm going
[27:26] to be the bride of jesus christ i am the
[27:29] bride of jesus christ not realizing that
[27:32] it's not just recognizing your day it's
[27:35] also recognizing your time
[27:38] your season
[27:40] your hour to manifest the word of god
[27:43] amen and and recognize that that this is
[27:47] this is the rapture age
[27:50] this is the age you know for us
[27:52] as sons and daughters of god uh we can
[27:55] feed and we do feed on the word of god
[27:58] every day and we do listen to the
[28:00] messages we do we attend church
[28:03] we do all that we know that we are
[28:05] supposed to do
[28:06] as sons and daughters of god but then
[28:09] there's that element of recognizing that
[28:11] you have a part
[28:13] you have a part in this
[28:17] rapture
[28:18] in this season and in this age that we
[28:21] are in
[28:22] and you need to recognize that that's
[28:24] the age

[28:29] and your life is going to manifest that
[28:32] and understand that
[28:34] you are
[28:35] ordained from before the foundations of
[28:38] the world

[29:21] the time and the season that we are to
[29:23] manifest your word lord bless prosper

[29:38] to each and every one of our lives
[29:40] granted we pray lord remember our pastor
[29:44] strengthen watch over direct and guide
[29:46] him
[29:47] in jesus name amen praise god god bless
[29:50] you saints
[29:52] and so let's look at our scripture
[29:54] tonight
[29:55] our scripture reading
[29:56] comes from
[29:58] second peter 1 15 to 9.
[30:02] and it says here
[30:03] moreover
[30:05] i will endeavor that ye may be
[30:07] able after my decrease
[30:10] to have these things always in
[30:13] remembrance
[30:15] if we for we have not followed cunningly
[30:18] devised fables when we were when we made
[30:21] known unto you the power and coming of
[30:25] our lord jesus christ but were
[30:28] eyewitnesses of his majesty
[30:31] now now you recognize here paul
[30:33] you know he's speaking here and he's
[30:35] bringing clear peter bringing clearly
[30:38] here that that he was an eyewitness
[30:41] to the coming of the lord jesus
[30:44] that it's not something that that he
[30:46] just you know uh thought up or you know
[30:50] uh was you know decided to join some
[30:52] group
[30:53] and and they would come up with these
[30:56] these uh uh circumstances no no he was
[30:59] an actual eyewitness
[31:01] and you as a son and daughter of god
[31:04] you must come into that element
[31:07] in your walk with god
[31:09] you can't just be
[31:11] somebody that's repeating something that
[31:13] was said or told to you
[31:16] you've got to be an eyewitness
[31:19] you've got to have recognized the the
[31:22] the power of jesus christ
[31:24] in your life that he's actually come
[31:26] into your life
[31:28] and taken you from from your old life
[31:31] and buried you into the water
[31:34] because the water a type of the baptism
[31:36] a type of your old life being buried and
[31:40] left behind having that kind of a
[31:42] reality that kind of an experience with
[31:45] god that you can know and say like peter
[31:49] that that listen
[31:50] i'm an eyewitness
[31:52] of individuals whose lives were changed
[31:55] i am an eyewitness my life has been
[31:57] transformed by the word of god i'm not
[32:01] the same person that i was before
[32:04] there's a reality to this
[32:07] for he
[32:08] received from god the father honor and
[32:11] glory when there came such a voice to
[32:14] him from the excellent glory this is my
[32:18] beloved son in whom i am well pleased
[32:22] and this voice which came from heaven we
[32:25] heard
[32:26] when we were with him in the holy mount
[32:29] we have also a more sure word of
[32:32] prophecy
[32:34] they witnessed it
[32:36] they saw the scripture that was spoken
[32:40] that said this was going to happen he
[32:42] was going to come he was going to
[32:44] fulfill scripture he was going to be the
[32:47] lamb of god that would take away the sin
[32:50] of the world he would be there would be
[32:52] one that would go to the cross and dive
[32:54] they they read the prophecy and then
[32:57] they witnessed the prophecy
[33:00] well you've heard a prophet in the 20th
[33:03] century he's spoken about a bride he's
[33:06] spoken about a rapture he's spoken about
[33:09] a church that's going to raise up in the
[33:11] last day that's going to be the
[33:13] manifestation of jesus christ in female
[33:16] form
[33:17] he spoke those prophecies and now you
[33:20] are witnessing those prophecies because
[33:23] your life is reflecting that very word
[33:29] so
[33:30] whereunto ye do well that ye take heed
[33:34] as unto a light that shineth in a dark
[33:37] place
[33:38] until the day dawn and the day star
[33:41] arise in your hearts
[33:45] knowing this first
[33:47] that no prophecy
[33:49] of the scripture
[33:51] is of any private interpretation amen
[33:56] so don't
[33:57] don't you know there's a lot of
[33:59] interpretations out there there's a lot
[34:01] of teachings on jesus christ the coming
[34:04] of the lord how it is that he's going to
[34:06] come what's going to happen all these
[34:09] different interpretations but the
[34:10] scripture says very clearly here that no
[34:15] no prophecy of the scripture is of any
[34:19] private interpretation don't you lean on
[34:22] to your own understanding
[34:24] don't you rely on your own ability
[34:28] oh i'm i i was good in school i i i'm a
[34:31] good scholar i got my phd i've got my
[34:34] lld i've got a four year university
[34:37] degree
[34:39] big deal
[34:40] when it comes to the to the power and
[34:42] the and the leadership of the holy
[34:44] spirit in your life it's christ in you
[34:47] that's your hope of glory
[34:50] amen the prophecy has got to be
[34:51] fulfilled in you
[34:55] for the prophecy came not in old time by
[34:58] the will of man
[35:01] but by holy men of god
[35:04] spake as they were moved by the holy
[35:08] ghost
[35:11] hallelujah
[35:12] glory to god
[35:14] brother branham was was was was a was a
[35:17] prophet
[35:18] he was a man of god that was moved by
[35:21] the holy spirit
[35:22] and the words that came forth they were
[35:24] the words of god
[35:27] amen praise god but a lot of people
[35:29] don't recognize that you need to have
[35:32] the same spirit
[35:34] that was on william branham
[35:36] to interpret the word of god for your
[35:38] day and your time
[35:40] [Music]
[35:42] glory to god next slide listen to
[35:44] brother branham here god is his own
[35:46] interpreter and if you get a chance
[35:48] listen to that message god is his own
[35:50] interpreter uh by by brother branham
[35:53] it's less than an hour it's full of
[35:56] nuggets that's where i was inspired to
[35:58] bring this message and listen what he
[36:00] says here now
[36:03] all we are today is the display of his
[36:06] attributes now you got to remember
[36:08] brother branham
[36:09] was walking in perfect faith
[36:12] he had a revelation of who he was
[36:16] he realized that he was not
[36:18] the son of charles and ella branham
[36:22] he came to that that that that epiphany
[36:25] in his life when when he met the holy
[36:27] spirit when he met him in that cave when
[36:29] he met him
[36:31] lip to ear and he heard his voice speak
[36:33] to him i trust you've had that kind of
[36:35] an experience
[36:37] because that's the kind of experience
[36:39] that's required in order to be in this
[36:42] rapture age
[36:43] in order to be in the rapture because
[36:45] the rapture is a revelation
[36:48] it's not something that you can join a
[36:50] church and because you belong to that
[36:51] church you're going in the rapture
[36:53] no you need to belong to jesus christ
[36:56] you need to know that the same spirit
[36:57] that raised christ from the dead dwells
[37:00] in you
[37:01] because if that spirit dwells in you
[37:03] it's going to quicken you
[37:05] it's going to change your mortal body
[37:07] it's going to translate you from this
[37:09] dimension of humanity and and frailty
[37:13] and sin and unbelief and weakness
[37:17] into a dimension of perfect
[37:21] love
[37:22] perfect realization
[37:25] of who you are listen to brother branham
[37:28] so he's in this state
[37:31] of perfect faith
[37:33] so now what what he's saying here
[37:36] people don't understand this when you
[37:38] know when
[37:39] sometimes you you try to witness to
[37:41] people and you tell them but you know we
[37:43] are attributes of god
[37:46] and they'll look at you an attribute
[37:47] what what do you mean what do you mean
[37:50] an attribute of god
[37:52] well brother branham knew exactly what
[37:54] he meant when he said
[37:56] we are
[37:58] today is the display of his attributes
[38:01] in god first he was not even god god we
[38:05] would just call him the eternal one he
[38:08] wasn't god because the word english word
[38:11] god means object of worship and there
[38:13] was nothing to worship him so he was the
[38:17] eternal one
[38:18] the main fountain of all intelligence
[38:22] and in this fountain of all intelligence
[38:26] there was not an atom
[38:28] molecule or nothing
[38:31] light nowhere star moon nothing else
[38:35] god
[38:36] what we know as god the great spirit
[38:39] that was eternal
[38:40] never did begin never did end
[38:43] he was there
[38:45] and in him
[38:46] was attributes
[38:48] in him was sons and daughters of god
[38:53] it and and you know like remember
[38:56] you gotta understand here
[38:59] the mind of god
[39:02] sons and daughters
[39:04] are just a definition
[39:06] it's so it's words
[39:09] it's just words
[39:11] but attributes are his thoughts
[39:15] are him
[39:16] actually him
[39:17] but because he was he could just express
[39:20] his thoughts
[39:21] and he could express it as anthony
[39:24] in a human vessel
[39:27] not anthony
[39:29] the human
[39:31] the attribute that's in anthony
[39:34] the attribute that's in you
[39:36] the attribute of god that is going to
[39:39] fulfill
[39:41] his purpose and his will
[39:44] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[39:46] attributes
[39:47] shall never pass away
[39:52] my attributes shall not fail
[39:55] my seed my attribute my word
[39:58] that which you are in this time and in
[40:02] this season you see how you need to
[40:04] recognize that you see how important it
[40:06] is that once you see that
[40:09] and i know you've heard it many many
[40:10] many times but there is a time and a
[40:13] season that the word will become more
[40:15] real to you
[40:17] that's how the rapture is progressing
[40:20] that's how it is that you are going to
[40:22] be changed in a moment in the twinkling
[40:24] of an eye the scripture talks about
[40:26] lying upon line
[40:29] precept upon precept here a little there
[40:32] a little you see you're receiving a
[40:34] little tonight
[40:35] if you're under that anointing if you're
[40:37] under that inspiration if you've come to
[40:39] church tonight and those of you that are
[40:41] that are out there in youtube world if
[40:44] you've come with expectations in your
[40:46] hearts that you're not just tuning in to
[40:49] listen to some sermon that's going to
[40:51] tickle your ears but that you've
[40:53] actually tuned into the program and the
[40:56] plan of god because god wants to awaken
[41:01] and place
[41:03] his attributes so that they can
[41:05] recognize the time and the season that
[41:08] they are in and what it is that they
[41:11] must fulfill
[41:12] and it's not because you're gonna do it
[41:15] you see this is this is how how great
[41:18] this is
[41:19] you go back and listen to that message
[41:21] god says
[41:22] god's his own interpreter
[41:24] god brings it to pass
[41:26] that's the interpretation
[41:28] not you saying oh well you know brother
[41:31] branham if you don't listen to the tapes
[41:33] and if you don't pay attention and you
[41:35] know you all you need is a tape ministry
[41:37] and you start speaking those kinds of
[41:39] things you're not even close
[41:41] [Music]
[41:42] to what the holy ghost is doing in this
[41:44] hour
[41:45] because the spirit of god is not in any
[41:48] of that
[41:49] though he's using man
[41:52] he's got a five-fold ministry but it's
[41:54] still jesus christ
[41:56] he's still his own interpreter he's
[41:59] never going to change that
[42:01] that will never change that will be the
[42:03] way that he will interpret his word
[42:06] from the beginning until the end
[42:10] so listen here
[42:11] he says now he was there and in him was
[42:14] attributes it was attributes to be god
[42:18] then his attributes to be a father
[42:21] attributes to be a son you see a son
[42:25] attributes to be a savior
[42:28] attributes to be a healer
[42:31] all these attributes was in
[42:34] him
[42:35] and now he
[42:36] these things that has unfolded since
[42:40] then are just his attributes being
[42:44] made
[42:45] manifest
[42:51] next slide and now remember
[42:54] you christians
[42:57] you were
[42:59] his thoughts
[43:00] before there was a world
[43:03] glory
[43:04] so already he he knew exactly the time
[43:09] and the season that you would come into
[43:11] manifestation as a son or as a daughter
[43:15] of god you're just it's just because
[43:17] you're you're you know because god
[43:19] is male and female
[43:22] god is male and female
[43:24] not in the way that the world is
[43:26] perverting it today because they have no
[43:28] revelation of god the eternal one the
[43:31] creator
[43:32] the one who created all things
[43:35] so they take the word they take certain
[43:37] ideas and they come out with neutral
[43:40] gender they come out with uh you know a
[43:42] heishi and they come out with a they and
[43:44] they come what is all that
[43:46] that's all perversion from the word of
[43:48] god that's all it is
[43:50] if they had a true revelation of god
[43:52] they would know that god is male and
[43:55] female expressing himself in an earthly
[43:59] existence and dimension it's only here
[44:03] that we see and we recognize one another
[44:06] in certain aspects of male and female
[44:09] but in god is the male and female
[44:12] attributes
[44:14] and it's displayed but he he was able to
[44:16] separate the truth when he took adam and
[44:19] he took eve out of adam it was a perfect
[44:22] like like just there alone should tell
[44:24] you right there it's plain and simple
[44:27] god god took the woman the womb of the
[44:31] man he took he took the woman from the
[44:33] womb of the man and created a woman and
[44:37] now we've got male and female to be
[44:40] expressed so that god could express
[44:42] himself
[44:44] have fellowship
[44:45] have a relationship
[44:49] you see how beautiful
[44:51] a man and a woman's proper
[44:54] identity and relationship lines up with
[44:57] the word of god
[45:00] but the minute you pervert it and you
[45:02] start coming out with neutral this and
[45:05] neutral that and men you know like like
[45:07] it's just all perversion sorry that's
[45:11] what it is it doesn't line up with the
[45:12] word they have no understanding of the
[45:15] true identity of god of jesus christ
[45:19] jesus christ even was just
[45:22] the word made flesh
[45:24] he was expressed as a redeemer so that
[45:26] he could come and go to the cross and
[45:29] die for our sin in order to fulfill his
[45:32] purpose his plan his redemptive plan for
[45:35] this earth it's only for this earth it's
[45:38] not it's for nothing more
[45:41] once we get changed and we get
[45:43] translated out of this dimension we go
[45:46] back to our eternal
[45:48] sunship
[45:49] eternal attributes of god if this
[45:53] earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have
[45:56] a brand new one we have a brand new it's
[45:59] it's always been there
[46:02] it's it's our it's our theophany body
[46:05] it's our eternal bodies
[46:07] time only exists here in this dimension
[46:11] there is no time or space beyond
[46:14] this dimension
[46:17] wow
[46:18] i i i could just
[46:20] i could hear these things over and over
[46:22] and over again because all it continues
[46:24] to do is just reinforce
[46:26] who we really are
[46:28] that we're not bound by
[46:31] listen
[46:32] don't get me wrong here you're no
[46:33] different than anybody else out there in
[46:35] the world
[46:37] you're you're susceptible to weakness
[46:39] you're susceptible to anger you're
[46:41] susceptible to to unbelief you're
[46:44] you're susceptible to tiredness and and
[46:47] grouchy and grumpiness and all those
[46:49] things
[46:50] you're absolutely susceptible to all
[46:52] those things but there's an attribute in
[46:55] you
[46:56] that that is god
[46:58] that cannot sin
[47:00] it came from god it's got to go back to
[47:03] god
[47:04] it overrides all of your grumpiness
[47:08] it overrides all of your weaknesses
[47:11] it overrides your your day your down
[47:14] days we all have down days we all have
[47:17] bad days
[47:18] we all make mistakes we're all human
[47:21] beings as long as you're in this human
[47:23] vessel you're going to make mistakes
[47:28] but he says here before there was
[47:30] a world you were in christ amen in god
[47:33] in the beginning that makes you then you
[47:36] see his subjects
[47:38] and the whole thing is god
[47:42] the whole thing is god
[47:44] the whole plan is god
[47:46] the rapture is god
[47:49] the deception in the world and all of
[47:52] the all of the things that the devil is
[47:54] doing in this world right now especially
[47:56] right now saints if there was ever a
[47:58] time you want to know who you are it's
[48:00] now
[48:01] because the world is in such confusion
[48:04] the people don't know what to believe
[48:06] anymore they don't know what the world's
[48:08] gonna come to they don't understand
[48:10] they're they get caught up into covet
[48:14] they get caught up into cancer they get
[48:16] caught up into hurricane they get caught
[48:19] up into war they get all these things
[48:22] but those things the bible said would be
[48:25] here
[48:26] so so so what are you surprised about as
[48:28] a son or an attribute of god when you're
[48:31] seeing the sure prophecy of god's word
[48:33] being fulfilled right before your eyes
[48:36] right here in 2022
[48:39] you can't change that nobody can change
[48:42] that but you can change your attitude
[48:44] you can change your vision you can
[48:46] change your outlook you can change the
[48:48] way you live today
[48:51] and not be caught
[48:53] by that
[48:55] and pulled down by circumstance
[48:59] materializing himself tangible
[49:02] so that he could be handled seen and so
[49:06] forth and that's what god is the whole
[49:09] thing
[49:10] it's all god
[49:16] next slide
[49:18] brother branham says here
[49:21] you are known
[49:23] when
[49:24] jesus christ
[49:26] lives in you by his life
[49:30] and promised word
[49:32] of this day
[49:34] reflecting in you
[49:40] you don't need to be
[49:43] running down the street with tracks
[49:46] and trying to convince people
[49:49] that hey it's the coming of the lord you
[49:52] know you got the big sign on your back
[49:54] and on the back it says armageddon is
[49:56] coming
[49:58] armageddon is coming
[50:02] that's not your part
[50:05] that's not your part your part is to
[50:07] display
[50:08] the life of
[50:11] in christ
[50:11] in many different ways
[50:13] you when when men see you living like
[50:16] him
[50:18] when he sees your character
[50:23] you know character is something that
[50:25] that that that is developed by the power
[50:27] of god in your life when you overcome
[50:31] character comes from overcoming
[50:34] character doesn't come by practicing
[50:36] character
[50:38] oh i think i'm going to learn about
[50:39] character and i'm going to try to make
[50:42] my character better good luck
[50:45] people that go for that they end up
[50:47] falling into the traps of pride
[50:50] i'm this i'm better than that i know
[50:53] more than this and i know more than that
[50:55] i can have more wisdom because i can
[50:57] learn more
[50:59] that's not going to work in this hour
[51:01] true character comes from
[51:04] being tested
[51:05] and tried as a son and a daughter of god
[51:09] your conduct with the word
[51:11] just exactly like he was the word being
[51:15] manifested then men will see
[51:18] jesus christ
[51:20] they won't have to look around anywhere
[51:22] else say what does this creed teach what
[51:25] does that creed teach they'll know what
[51:28] god is when they see
[51:31] you
[51:33] because you've got a
[51:34] message that's different than everybody
[51:37] else
[51:39] you've got a message that that that can
[51:41] tell people that you know when people
[51:43] are all caught up and they're all and
[51:45] they're all
[51:46] you know caught up into this world and
[51:48] everything else
[51:49] you can tell them about the salvation of
[51:51] jesus christ and that god is going to
[51:54] deliver
[51:55] a people in this age
[51:57] out of this dimension because what
[51:59] you're seeing now is not going to get
[52:01] better
[52:02] the prophecy says clearly that the world
[52:05] goes into great
[52:07] tribulation
[52:09] right now it's in tribulation
[52:11] you talk to those people that are in
[52:13] ukraine that were in ukraine that that
[52:16] whole country completely devastated
[52:19] okay
[52:20] they just went through a great
[52:22] tribulation
[52:24] that's what i call something because now
[52:28] bombs are dropping right in your
[52:29] backyard bombs are dropping in your
[52:32] neighbors killing people dropping on
[52:34] hospitals killing innocent children
[52:36] that's great tribulation
[52:39] that's just a taste
[52:40] of what is actually going to come upon
[52:43] the world not because we're saying it
[52:44] we're not doom's day sayers
[52:47] it's what the scripture says
[52:49] and everything that the scripture has
[52:51] said up until now
[52:53] it's come to pass
[52:56] so who are we to try and you know or
[52:58] anybody out there to try and say oh no
[53:00] but it's not gonna you know forget about
[53:02] what it says in the book of revelations
[53:04] that this earth
[53:06] shall burn as an oven no no no don't
[53:08] worry about that you know that that that
[53:11] this that these things are gonna happen
[53:12] that the scripture says those things no
[53:14] you have to recognize that all the
[53:18] scripture is going to be fulfilled
[53:20] god's word cannot fail
[53:24] and it's not because god says i'm going
[53:26] to bring this upon the earth no it's
[53:29] because of the law of sowing and reaping
[53:32] and the way that god designed the whole
[53:34] earth and he said very clearly it'll be
[53:37] man himself that will destroy
[53:40] the
[53:40] earth
[53:42] and that's why all the things that
[53:44] they're doing right from the
[53:45] commercialization
[53:47] of of currency and coins and and taking
[53:50] out of the earth and and all the metals
[53:53] and all the natural gas and all the
[53:56] natural things that man constantly
[53:58] sucking out of the earth from those
[54:00] things to
[54:02] government
[54:03] to where they can have their own laws
[54:05] and they can they can set the laws they
[54:07] can say who aborts who doesn't abort
[54:10] they can say who is uh you know uh can
[54:13] be considered you know uh they or a he
[54:16] or a she or a transgender or whatever
[54:20] and pride and have all these things that
[54:23] that's all government
[54:24] that's all government that's all man's
[54:27] interpretation of the world but god has
[54:30] an interpretation of the word that that
[54:34] the world has no idea about unless
[54:37] you're in it
[54:38] [Music]
[54:40] you've got to be a part of that word
[54:44] so the next slide says let your light
[54:47] shine
[54:49] matthew 5 16 let your light so shine
[54:51] before men that they may see your good
[54:54] works and glorify your father which is
[54:57] in heaven
[54:59] so your character your way of living
[55:02] you shouldn't be a religious fanatic
[55:06] you should not be a religious fanatic
[55:08] you should not be somebody that's
[55:09] constantly driving the word down
[55:12] people's throats and this and that
[55:14] that's not how you came
[55:16] just think about the way that you were
[55:18] changed how you were you know it was
[55:20] god's love that came into your life
[55:22] it was god's mercy that came into your
[55:24] life and took you out of out of a
[55:27] certain condition or you know a lot of
[55:28] people say oh
[55:30] yeah you you you had a problem i guess
[55:32] you had a really bad problem so you
[55:34] needed help so you went to the church
[55:40] i then i tell them my testimony and they
[55:42] sit back and they go
[55:44] oh
[55:45] that's different
[55:48] i wasn't looking for god
[55:52] god has a word to interpret
[55:55] god has a time and a season
[55:57] to interpret the rapture
[55:59] god has a people
[56:01] that he ordained from before the
[56:04] foundations of the world
[56:06] if you happen to be one of those whose
[56:08] names were written in the lamb's book of
[56:10] life
[56:12] guess what
[56:13] you're going to get a
[56:14] call you're going to get a knock
[56:18] something's going to knock on your door
[56:20] when you least expect it you might be in
[56:22] a terrible situation like i was under
[56:25] you know certain unbelief and and
[56:27] addictions and all those things you may
[56:30] not be you may just be somebody that's
[56:32] going to church that's got a that's got
[56:34] a heart for god god has attributes in
[56:37] every aspect that's why you don't have
[56:39] to have a crisis in your life
[56:42] to be called of god
[56:44] you just got to be an attribute
[56:47] you just got to be in the mind of god
[56:49] from before the foundation of the world
[56:51] where he wrote your name down in the
[56:53] lamb's book of life and once your name
[56:55] is called and it wasn't called anthony
[56:58] billy
[57:00] kofi
[57:01] michelle it wasn't called that way
[57:04] it was called when you heard the word
[57:07] and something struck you right inside
[57:09] there and it changed you and you knew
[57:12] that you were not you knew that you knew
[57:15] that you knew
[57:16] that something is different
[57:18] something has changed i have come into
[57:20] contact with
[57:22] a supernatural being
[57:24] this is supernatural because all of a
[57:26] sudden i'm set free from certain aspects
[57:30] my life is not the same anymore
[57:33] i'm completely 360 in the way that i
[57:36] perceive in the way that i see things
[57:38] because now you're seeing
[57:40] through the eyes of the attribute
[57:43] now you've put on the mind
[57:45] of christ
[57:51] but
[57:53] the next slide says you need to shine
[57:56] through the darkness
[57:59] and my god
[58:00] if there was ever a time
[58:02] that there was a lot of darkness
[58:04] it is right now
[58:07] you can look around you can you know
[58:09] right from and i'm and don't be looking
[58:11] too far
[58:13] when it comes to you know
[58:15] the the ranks
[58:16] and the fact
[58:19] that we are in this
[58:22] message teaching
[58:25] because remember
[58:27] if you go back and do a study of the
[58:28] church ages we're not going to get into
[58:30] all of that
[58:31] but
[58:32] everything started when jesus christ
[58:34] came to the earth christianity began
[58:37] then
[58:38] that's when god started to call
[58:41] his attributes for the rapture
[58:44] it all started back then
[58:47] those were the church ages and it all
[58:50] came down through those church ages and
[58:52] god was calling sons and daughters of
[58:55] god in each one of those ages
[58:59] and through all that darkness god was
[59:02] calling
[59:03] calling
[59:04] every age calling and and there was a
[59:07] progression of the word
[59:09] constantly progressing from from you
[59:12] know from luther when he broke away from
[59:13] the catholic church that was a
[59:15] progression of the word luther said that
[59:18] just shall live by faith in other words
[59:20] you need your own experience and
[59:22] revelation with god
[59:25] you need to know that you have an
[59:27] experience with god not going to a
[59:29] priest and having him interpret
[59:32] everything for you and tell you what you
[59:34] need to do
[59:35] what's wrong with you meeting god face
[59:37] to face
[59:39] there's no mediator between man and god
[59:41] the scripture says it clearly except
[59:43] jesus christ
[59:45] mary
[59:46] mary is one of our sisters in christ
[59:50] she was blessed because god chose her
[59:53] vessel to put his seed into in order to
[59:57] bring forth a human body so that he
[1:00:00] could dwell in that human body and go to
[1:00:02] the cross
[1:00:03] but once she fulfilled that part and
[1:00:07] brought forth that portion of the word
[1:00:09] her part was done
[1:00:11] that's it she's an attribute of god
[1:00:13] she's a vessel that god used for that
[1:00:16] but she's not a mediator today
[1:00:19] you can't get to heaven by going to mary
[1:00:22] you need to go directly to jesus christ
[1:00:26] it wasn't mary that died on the cross it
[1:00:28] was christ that died on the cross
[1:00:31] you know we don't want to get into all
[1:00:32] but see luther caught a revelation of
[1:00:34] that broke away from the church
[1:00:38] because he had an understanding that
[1:00:40] there was that there was a relationship
[1:00:42] between him and god directly
[1:00:46] and then there was wesley and you know
[1:00:48] he realized that you needed to have
[1:00:50] sanctification in your life that your
[1:00:52] life could not just go on and you could
[1:00:54] just live any way you want and be
[1:00:56] lustful and take two or three different
[1:00:58] women or men and live you know any way
[1:01:01] that you want no he said you need to
[1:01:03] have a sanctified life
[1:01:05] you know and so that was another
[1:01:06] progression of the word and then
[1:01:08] pentecost came along they received the
[1:01:10] gifts
[1:01:11] you know the speaking in tongues those
[1:01:13] were the gifts of the spirit
[1:01:16] and then god sends a prophet
[1:01:19] to bring restoration to all of it
[1:01:22] to bring clarity to all of it and that's
[1:01:25] that's where we were blessed that it his
[1:01:28] ministry wiped out all the confusion
[1:01:30] turned the hearts of the children back
[1:01:32] to the faith of the fathers amen praise
[1:01:35] god so that we could recognize who we
[1:01:38] you know that all this confusion all
[1:01:39] these churches all this this this
[1:01:42] teaching and everything else that that
[1:01:44] we would be able to easily come out of
[1:01:46] it because now we know where we're at
[1:01:49] you can't get somewhere unless you know
[1:01:51] where you are
[1:01:53] you need to know your destination but
[1:01:55] you also need to know your starting
[1:01:56] point you need to know where you're at
[1:01:58] in your walk with god and that's what
[1:02:01] we're trying to establish here tonight
[1:02:02] so that you can come to a place where
[1:02:05] you can recognize that you are an
[1:02:08] attribute of god and it's your time
[1:02:10] to shine it's your time to recognize
[1:02:13] it's your time to recognize your day
[1:02:16] your time your season what it is that
[1:02:19] god requires of you as a son or a
[1:02:21] daughter of god in this day and this
[1:02:23] hour
[1:02:26] not fanaticism we're not talking about
[1:02:28] finale we're not fanatics
[1:02:30] we're not we're not fanatics and and and
[1:02:33] you know we're going out there and
[1:02:34] telling the people you've got you've got
[1:02:36] all kinds of fanatics going on out there
[1:02:38] and people think it's okay
[1:02:40] you know they want to go there and they
[1:02:41] want to make a fuss over
[1:02:43] pride they want to make a fuss over this
[1:02:45] they want to make a fuss over that you
[1:02:47] know meanwhile they're they're getting
[1:02:49] caught up into what the world is
[1:02:51] supposed to produce and supposed to do
[1:02:54] that's not what we're supposed to do
[1:03:00] so ephesians chapter 6
[1:03:04] you know we're not going to go much
[1:03:05] further here
[1:03:07] i want to let you out here in the next
[1:03:09] 10 minutes or so but there's a lot
[1:03:12] that i have here
[1:03:14] and as the lord provides we will
[1:03:17] continue this little series
[1:03:20] on recognizing your time
[1:03:23] but ephesians chapter 6
[1:03:26] verses 11 to 12 says put on the whole
[1:03:28] armor of god that he may be able to
[1:03:31] stand against the wiles
[1:03:34] and i thought oh that's interesting then
[1:03:36] i heard a little bit about the wiles of
[1:03:38] the devil
[1:03:40] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:03:42] blood but against principalities against
[1:03:46] powers against the rulers of the
[1:03:49] darkness of this world against spiritual
[1:03:53] wickedness in high places
[1:03:57] we're not dealing with
[1:03:58] you know
[1:04:00] oh you know
[1:04:02] you're a baptist oh well you know you
[1:04:04] need to you need to be uh born again and
[1:04:07] you need to
[1:04:08] let go of the trinity and you know
[1:04:11] all these little no no no these no we're
[1:04:13] dealing against spiritual powers in high
[1:04:16] places
[1:04:17] they're moving
[1:04:18] right
[1:04:19] where you are
[1:04:22] if you're walking with god and you're
[1:04:25] recognizing the day that you're living
[1:04:27] in and you're recognizing that you are a
[1:04:29] son of god that's going to produce
[1:04:31] a rapture
[1:04:33] then you are the one
[1:04:36] that's
[1:04:37] facing spiritual powers in high places
[1:04:41] wickedness
[1:04:43] principalities and dominions sometimes
[1:04:45] we don't realize just how powerful those
[1:04:48] things are but the wiles of the devil
[1:04:51] are his methods
[1:04:52] his ways of deceiving you of of getting
[1:04:56] you
[1:04:57] into into a
[1:04:58] state of mind as a son or a daughter of
[1:05:02] god because listen
[1:05:03] satan knew that jesus christ was the
[1:05:06] real thing
[1:05:09] he saw the things that were happening
[1:05:11] around his life
[1:05:13] but he went to him at the time of
[1:05:15] weakness so let's look at the next slide
[1:05:19] wiles of the devil
[1:05:21] whiles are tricks or manipulations
[1:05:24] designed to deceive someone
[1:05:28] the tongue-in-cheek phrase a woman's
[1:05:31] wiles
[1:05:33] to the seductiveness of femme fatales
[1:05:37] in using charm or sex appeal to elicit a
[1:05:41] desired response from men
[1:05:45] listen the devil
[1:05:47] he's the same in the way that he moves
[1:05:50] in the way that he acts he went to eve
[1:05:52] back in the garden of eden and he
[1:05:55] seduced her
[1:05:57] he seduced her
[1:05:58] it wasn't an apple that she ate
[1:06:02] he deceived her into making love and
[1:06:05] bypassing god's word bypassing god's
[1:06:09] plan deceiving her to get her off the
[1:06:11] word hath god said
[1:06:14] putting question to the word of god and
[1:06:17] you've got to be careful of those things
[1:06:20] because the devil the wiles of the devil
[1:06:22] are those clever schemes used by satan
[1:06:25] to ensure
[1:06:27] us to ensnare us
[1:06:29] through temptation
[1:06:32] threat
[1:06:33] or intimidation
[1:06:36] we need to realize what it is
[1:06:38] and how it is that the devil is trying
[1:06:40] to deceive us
[1:06:42] to take our minds to try to get us off
[1:06:46] of who we really are
[1:06:49] what it is that we're supposed to
[1:06:50] produce
[1:06:52] how it is that we are the interpretation
[1:06:55] of god's word in this hour to produce
[1:06:57] the rapture
[1:06:58] to stay focused on the word of god to
[1:07:01] stay focused on why we assemble
[1:07:04] ourselves together
[1:07:06] not to just show up and be identified oh
[1:07:09] i was at church i go to church more than
[1:07:11] anybody else
[1:07:13] if you're coming to church with a
[1:07:15] revelation that you're meeting with god
[1:07:18] and that he's speaking to you lip to ear
[1:07:21] discerning your life discerning your
[1:07:23] needs giving you instruction on how to
[1:07:26] produce the word for your day and for
[1:07:28] your hour then you're going to leave
[1:07:30] here different
[1:07:31] [Music]
[1:07:33] it's your attitude
[1:07:35] of coming to church
[1:07:37] it's your motives for coming to church
[1:07:41] that's what god looks at in your heart
[1:07:43] that's what god recognizes in your heart
[1:07:46] but when you start acting in that way
[1:07:48] you start being a a dedicated vessel a
[1:07:51] yielded vessel a prayer warrior you're
[1:07:54] at the prayer meetings you're there
[1:07:56] praying you're there believing in the
[1:07:58] power of god to deliver your situations
[1:08:01] your family your friends
[1:08:04] to hear your brothers and sisters
[1:08:06] praying and believing for god to deliver
[1:08:08] them from the snares of the enemy the
[1:08:11] wiles of the devil
[1:08:14] then you will see god in action
[1:08:17] you will you will you will identify with
[1:08:19] the word you will recognize the word you
[1:08:21] will manifest the word supernatural will
[1:08:24] just automatically take place around
[1:08:27] your life because of your awareness
[1:08:31] and because of who you are
[1:08:33] remember this is not you performing the
[1:08:36] word the bible says very clearly jesus
[1:08:39] god said back in the old testament i am
[1:08:41] the lord god
[1:08:44] i have spoken it
[1:08:46] i will
[1:08:48] perform it
[1:08:50] god is going to perform it right through
[1:08:52] your life when you yield yourself
[1:08:55] remember the interpretation of god's
[1:08:57] word is when he interprets it
[1:09:00] not when you interpret it when you try
[1:09:02] to convince somebody that they need
[1:09:04] jesus christ listen you can tell about
[1:09:07] the lord but there are attributes of god
[1:09:11] and then there are
[1:09:12] children of the world
[1:09:14] and many children of the world are going
[1:09:16] to receive jesus christ but they are not
[1:09:20] attributes
[1:09:21] they are not
[1:09:23] eternal
[1:09:25] an attribute is eternal because it's a
[1:09:27] part of god and if you're an attribute
[1:09:30] you never had a beginning you'll never
[1:09:31] have an end
[1:09:33] you're going to just manifest the
[1:09:34] thought of god you're going to you're
[1:09:35] going to manifest fellowship and
[1:09:38] relationship and and and you're going to
[1:09:40] manifest god's attributes in its pure
[1:09:43] form
[1:09:44] people of the world that are that are in
[1:09:47] this children of this world because they
[1:09:49] came by by by procreation let every seed
[1:09:52] bring forth of its own kind when man and
[1:09:55] woman started to procreate they brought
[1:09:58] forth children
[1:10:00] but remember it's when the attribute of
[1:10:02] god lands inside your soul
[1:10:06] there's a lot of soul everybody's got a
[1:10:08] soul out there everybody lives and and
[1:10:10] consists and lives by the life of god
[1:10:14] but not everybody is an attribute
[1:10:19] even the trees out there live by the
[1:10:20] life of god
[1:10:22] because god spoken
[1:10:24] god spoke let there be the fish of the
[1:10:26] sea
[1:10:27] so when he spoke the fish of the sea the
[1:10:29] fish were created they have a life in
[1:10:32] them by the spoken word but that doesn't
[1:10:34] make them eternal they have a beginning
[1:10:36] they'll have an end
[1:10:38] anything that's of this world without
[1:10:40] the attribute in that soul will have a
[1:10:43] beginning and an end
[1:10:45] they will actually
[1:10:47] you know their bodies will go six feet
[1:10:49] under and their soul will go to
[1:10:52] judgment
[1:10:53] and they'll be judged according to the
[1:10:56] works of their flesh
[1:10:58] that's
[1:11:00] the
[1:11:00] so-called christian
[1:11:02] world out there teaching
[1:11:05] but attributes of god
[1:11:07] that's a different category altogether
[1:11:11] we're not making ourselves something
[1:11:12] better no
[1:11:14] the reason why we can talk and we can
[1:11:16] speak about these things is because the
[1:11:18] holy ghost revealed it to us
[1:11:21] we didn't teach these things to
[1:11:23] ourselves we didn't learn these things
[1:11:26] these are things that are taught by the
[1:11:28] spirit of god jesus christ said the
[1:11:31] comforter the holy ghost he will come in
[1:11:34] you he will lead you and guide you into
[1:11:38] all truth well the truth is christ the
[1:11:42] word
[1:11:43] there can only be one truth there's not
[1:11:45] 15 different interpretations that's why
[1:11:48] there's no such thing as a trinity
[1:11:51] it's god
[1:11:53] but it's god expressed in different
[1:11:54] offices father son and holy ghost that's
[1:11:57] why when when when peter and and all the
[1:12:00] all the apostles were there when jesus
[1:12:02] christ came down in that eternal body
[1:12:05] and stood before them and said go ye
[1:12:06] into all the world baptizing them in the
[1:12:09] name
[1:12:10] he was telling them the name of the
[1:12:12] father and the son and the holy ghost
[1:12:14] the name is jesus christ and that's why
[1:12:17] you'll only ever find baptism in the
[1:12:20] anywhere in the new testament in the
[1:12:21] name of the lord jesus christ
[1:12:23] you won't find it in the name of the
[1:12:25] father and the son and the holy no you
[1:12:27] won't find that anywhere
[1:12:29] that's man's teaching
[1:12:31] and the minute man
[1:12:33] hybrids the word takes the word puts
[1:12:36] their own interpretation puts their own
[1:12:39] uh doctrine
[1:12:40] okay teachings of man that's why when
[1:12:43] jesus christ was on the earth and he
[1:12:45] stood before those pharisees and he says
[1:12:47] because of your doctrines because of
[1:12:50] your teachings because of your your
[1:12:54] interpretation
[1:12:55] you've made the word of god of none
[1:12:58] effect to the people and that's why
[1:13:00] people you can talk to them until
[1:13:01] they're blue in the face but unless
[1:13:03] there's an attribute of god in there to
[1:13:05] receive
[1:13:06] and to hear what you're hearing and what
[1:13:09] you're speaking
[1:13:11] there'll be no response
[1:13:14] and so that's why you
[1:13:15] you're not trying to convince people
[1:13:18] to be a christian
[1:13:20] convince them to live a certain way
[1:13:24] there's no convincing here
[1:13:26] this is god
[1:13:27] being his own interpreter
[1:13:30] he will bring it to pass
[1:13:34] and so i want to close it off right here
[1:13:37] and next time we get together it'll be
[1:13:38] part two and we're going to look at
[1:13:40] examples of the wiles of the devil and
[1:13:42] how it is that he can can get to you
[1:13:47] at certain times in your life
[1:13:49] when you're weak
[1:13:51] when you're tired
[1:13:52] when you're discouraged
[1:13:54] when you're beaten up
[1:13:56] when you're beaten down
[1:13:59] understand something
[1:14:00] the testing is all part
[1:14:03] of the blessing
[1:14:05] the testing is all part of giving you
[1:14:08] the character that you need let the
[1:14:09] musicians come
[1:14:11] the testing is all part
[1:14:13] of god
[1:14:14] removing the amnesia from your life
[1:14:17] because when you came into this
[1:14:19] dimension and you landed in this human
[1:14:21] vessel the attribute of god that didn't
[1:14:25] get called until a certain time in
[1:14:27] season in your life
[1:14:28] for some of you you still
[1:14:31] need to wake up
[1:14:35] there's people that think they're awake
[1:14:37] but they're still asleep
[1:14:40] especially at this time
[1:14:43] how could it be so deceiving that it
[1:14:45] would deceive even the very elect
[1:14:48] if it were possible
[1:14:50] that's got to be pretty close to home
[1:14:53] in order to get deceived we're going to
[1:14:56] look at some of those things next time
[1:14:58] we come together
[1:14:59] god bless you saints let us pray
[1:15:03] father
[1:15:04] we are so grateful tonight for your word
[1:15:07] and for the
[1:15:09] inspiration that you've laid upon our
[1:15:10] hearts tonight to to speak and to hear
[1:15:12] lord i know that
[1:15:14] many have heard
[1:15:16] and many are rejoicing because i'm
[1:15:19] rejoicing from what i heard tonight lord
[1:15:22] i heard my name
[1:15:24] being called
[1:15:26] being placed
[1:15:28] i know that this is not
[1:15:31] who i am
[1:15:34] i'm identified
[1:15:36] as dan masili
[1:15:39] but there's an attribute that lives
[1:15:42] that identifies
[1:15:44] only with the word
[1:15:46] it cannot believe
[1:15:48] anything but the word
[1:15:50] it cannot disbelieve
[1:15:52] the word
[1:15:54] what a beautiful
[1:15:57] experience
[1:15:59] and
[1:16:00] victory
[1:16:01] in the love divine to know that we
[1:16:05] we can do
[1:16:07] we can only do so much
[1:16:08] but when we've done all that we can we
[1:16:10] just stand
