a great Victory amen Hal that's why I'm excited because I know what God has brought me through to stand here this morning Hallelujah and I have total confidence in him amen that he's going to deliver what he needs to deliver this morning Hallelujah the man the gift is to get the man out of the way when the man gets out of the the way all anything that stands is Jesus Christ and you hallelujah it's your faith this morning your faith in him and what you're Desiring of him to speak to you amen that's what it is this morning is between you and him Hallelujah you come expecting you come praying you come believing that God is going to do something great oh hallelujah amen then he's going to do do something great this morning in your life amen God bless you Saints amen Emmanuel hallelujah amen I said to brother coffee um before uh when he got back in the parking lot the first thing that came out of my mouth when I spoke to him I said brother coffee Africa was shooking amen Africa was shooken I believe it was shook amen the man of God that went over there preach the gospel amen bring this word of God that we've been feeding on you see the effects that it has when we go out this word amen that God has given us here when it goes and it becomes flesh and it goes out and it speaks oh my my brothers and sisters Hallelujah great word of God Amen God bless you brother Desmond amen it's good to be here this morning amen hallelujah let us turn to the word this morning I was think thinking we're entering into the Christmas season Hallelujah and I've been given a Sunday in this season here and I was thinking I want to continue on my uh series that I feel on my heart uh manifestation and the last time we preached on uh manifesting the life abundantly so I was thinking to myself you know what I I I'm just moving in this direction I don't have nothing I said Lord it'd be nice to have something that would uh you know relate to Christmas a little bit so I just Let It Go and I was just uh studying and and doing my thing there and then you know what he gave me the title Hallelujah he gave me the title it just came to me because I had no title so my title this morning is Oh Come Emmanuel and manifest your word hallelujah oh come Emmanuel not only god with us but God in us Jesus said I'll be with you and in you and you'll know in that day you will know that's the greatest Revelation that the bride is catching in this hour is that you will know in this day amen Isaiah 558 glory to God familiar scriptures you know big part of preaching is preaching 80% of already what's been spoken you know why because we don't get it the first time sometimes the second or third time and God has to keep repeating it over and over again just like when brother Bram said you know when they asked him brother Bram you got anything else to preach besides repentance you know one time two time three times say oh yeah I got a lot to preach but repent first and then we'll move on so that's the way God is God wants to drive it home he wants to make this word a substance and make it real in our lives and sometimes he has to drive it home over and over and over until the light bulb turns on as we say Amen Hallelujah the Lord is speaking here Isaiah 558 to12 Hallelujah he's speaking for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayeth the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts so God is making it very clear here there's a difference between our thoughts our ways and his thoughts and his ways it's very important to understand this amen for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and return it not hither but WTH the Earth and make it bring forth and Bud that it may give seed to the soar and bread to the eater now he's saying here so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whet I sent it if we can see in nature what he said there and we can see that it manifests in nature God is saying so shall my word be and that's what we want to see this morning that what word has been spoken in this hour what word has gone forth to us in this hour what did God say for ye shall go out with joy not sadness not sorrow but joy and be led forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall Break Forth oh yes when Revelation is striking and the Sons and Daughters of God are getting anointed by the Holy Spirit and moving in the power and the demonstration of the word hallelujah Break Forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands glory to God let us pray father we thank you Lord for your love grace and mercy this morning Father we pray oh God that Lord you have spoken it you have sent forth your word in this hour and in this day father through a prophet of Malachi 4:5 the word has been spoken Lord and I believe the word has been received father Lord Jesus the word was made flesh then but I believe is becoming flesh again father and Lord that's why we're gathered here this morning Lord to hear from you it's not by might it's not by power but by your spirit sayeth the Lord father speak this morning Lord speak the word of God into the people's hearts oh God may they recognize it's not a man but may they recognize the voice of God coming in these last days through the Bride of Jesus Christ once again father Grant these things I pray in Jesus name amen you may be seated glory to God and that's what it is hallelujah the voice of God through the Bride of Jesus Christ in these last days and we're going to see by the end of the service that the Prophet The Very message of the hour that we're claiming to believe has spoken these things to be so that the voice is in the bride Hallelujah nowhere's else but in the Bride of Jesus Christ glory to God that is the word for the hour Isaiah 7:14 God is speaking here and God has always done the same thing down Through the Ages he's saying behold the Virgin shall conceive through the prophet Isaiah and we can see that it took 800 years before that prophecy that was spoken there was an 800 year frame of time what we call time but God doesn't deal with time Hallelujah we deal with time and then a virgin conceived and BR forth what God has spoken that is the very evidence God is showing us in the word amen what he did then he's going to do today and that is what we should be looking for in this hour we have the ability the prophet said the bride has the ability to see this word made flesh and manif before her very eyes God has gifted her amen by the attribute inside of her to see that word made flesh in this hour that's what we're looking for we're not looking to go to church or join a church or be religious but we're looking for that word to come in flesh again in this hour as individuals Hallelujah John 1:1 says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God Amen and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that has always been God's process of bringing his word evolution in his word down into flesh it's no different in this day no different his main objective his main purpose in this hour is to bring that word in flesh again Hallelujah he don't care now what I'm saying get me what I'm saying he don't care about your good works he don't care about all all your good behaviors and all the fruits of the spirit they're all good they're all respected as a good person but God is determined because what God has spoken is not those things God has spoken that my word won't return void but it will accomplish and my word will become flesh in a people in these last days that's what's been spoken through a prophet a bride must come forth Hallelujah manifesting is not is not about attracting what you want manifesting is an awareness and an understanding that you attract Who You Are are the meaning of mystery something that is difficult or impossible to understand or explain oh you talk about mystery the Mysteries unfolding the Mysteries being revealed in these last days hallelujah and they are they are but they are still hidden they're being revealed they've been unfolded Hallelujah but there still hidden because the control has always been in the father's hands Jesus said flesh and blood has not revealed it to you but my father has revealed it to you Hallelujah so it's always revealed in the control of the father's hands even what has been done and what has been spoken in this hour through a prophet it's still in the father's hands it's still in his control to reveal it to whoever he Wills to his own his own children he knows his own my sheep know my voice and a stranger they will not follow my sheep know me and I know them glory to God hallelujah very important to understand my brothers and sisters hallelujah hallelujah that's where we get all the conception all the mixup all the false things that are moving around interpret patience of the word but God is his own interpreter he will make it plain do we understand when he said that I am my own interpreter I will make it plain I don't need nobody else to interpret this word brother Brand's speaking here you don't mind if I do some quoting because I'm going to be doing some because because a little bit more than normal because I want to prove by the message where the bride is and who she is and who the prophet said she is hallelujah brother Brandon speaking here in Shalom 1964 and so it is today that gross darkness is coming upon the people and here we are God has allotted his word to be manifested this day and it is the only light we have and God is going to let somebody manifest that word you hear that God is going to let somebody manifest that word somebody's going to do it he promised it and he works just exactly like he always did he has never changed his pattern of work he prophesies what will happen then he sends somebody down to vindicate that which we have it already amen he's already spoken it he's already sent the prophet to vindicate it now what is the next step that's where people stop they stop right there with the prophet the word has not stopped with the prophet my brothers and sisters as people that don't recognize and see by faith what was spoken by the prophet and it goes over the heads of millions because Darkness covers the earth at that time this time I'm not talking about back there amen everything I talk everything I speak the quotes that I bring and all these men of God we bring it for now this is present day truth amen this is what God is doing now when I always got together at the beginning with brother Dany and we got into Fellowship that's the first thing that he would say before we start fellowshipping brother Tim where is God now what is he doing now and that's what we want we want God now today these things have to be for us today I thank God for what he did back there Hallelujah he knows that I Rejoice I'm blessed over that but that ain't going to do nothing for me if I don't see what God is doing in my life now today I want to see the manifestation of the holy ghost in my life without it don't mean nothing I don't want to be religious I don't want to just join a church and go to a church and do good works no way I rather hey Paul said if this ain't the truth we might as well be out there partying being married and giving him doing all these things and that's what I'm telling you right now if this God this world is not real in my life then I don't want to play religion either it's God or nothing bottom line either I need to see the Living God or it's nothing and that takes that takes desperation in my life that takes me seeking like he said seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open to you that's not lightly that's with my whole heart mind body and soul you have to give this over the heads of millions because Darkness covers the earth at that time and people love Darkness not in here right not in any message churches right okay I got something better for you here people love Darkness better than they do the light cuz Darkness has a lot you listening oh Darkness has a lot of pleasure oh yeah in it well that changes a little bit eh pleasure I thought Darkness was evil I thought Darkness was you know blaspheming Darkness was this Darkness was that no Darkness has a lot of pleasure in it oh Satan likes to use the pleasures of this life to take you away from the word of God to take you away listen seek the kingdom first like we talked about the last service seek the kingdom of God first give your heart to the kingdom first and then God will freely add everything that you have need of all the blessings he wants to give you it'll just fall into place freely we don't seek after pleasure we don't seek after riches the things of this world we seek after God Amen Hallelujah and that's exactly what's coming to pass now is just before day the morning star has come out to hail the day coming and the Holy Spirit is showing its light it's coming a time when the light and darkness will have to be separated oh it's separating right now now my brothers and sisters this two seeds are coming to their full maturity now listen what he says here one from the other now listen the church and its order will take the order of the day and Christ and his light word promise will go into a Rapture so automatically your property thinking the church will take the new world order out there they're taking the the the order out there and then the bride will take the light of the word and it is true and go into Rapture but let me tell you the message the mess age god brother Bram said God is calling the bride out of the church he didn't difference that he didn't come at that time and say well there's going to be a message group and message churches that are going to be here on the earth he didn't difference that he didn't say anything about that he actually says listen be born again serve God in whatever church that is available to you at the time we have created messes churches where we gather together and we can see the mess in the message oh we can see it my brothers and sisters why is there so many different doctrines different teachings out there why we got the same message we believe the same thing why is there because that's what he was talking about the church the message will take the order of the Church of the message culture but the bride will take the light in this hour and she will be called out of that message that's the only thing that's left for them to do it's the dawning of a new day for many who are looking for his coming so many good sincere people today that's what burns their hearts so many good sincere people like Mary and Joseph Hallelujah brother Brown is speaking here we're nailing points home this morning we're going to nail it down be patient with me he speaking here and recognizing your day in his message they want a Great Awakening they're crying and believing that there will be a an Awakening they're good people I'm not saying people are bad why is it what have they done what have message people done they're sincere they believe they're right they believe what they're following is the truth all these different movements out there all these false doctrines they believe it what have they done they're good they're sincere dear people listen what he says they have not recognize the Awakening of the Bride remember what is sin unbelief see by being a Christian they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done that's what's making them feel that way think about it they know something is supposed to happen they know it of course they know it they're listening to the tapes they're coming to message churches and they're hearing preaching over the pulpit they know it they are heing it they know something's supposed to happen something is supposed to take place in this hour but see they're looking for it way off in the future to come listen when it's already happened right by you think about it well that's not me brother Tim I'm not looking for it in the future unless God reveals that to you you will not see that in your attitude in your behavior and that's the whole thing my brothers and sisters God is doing something right before us right today and that's where no man can help you no preacher can help you hallelujah it's between you and God lord what are you doing in this hour what am I missing what am I not recognizing when your word is coming forth what is being revealed Lord I don't want to walk out of the services saying oh I don't understand he was speaking all kinds of different kind of languages I don't understand what's going on what's being spoken these Services because let me tell you my brothers and sisters and and souls that are in prison now brother Bram spoke he said the preaching of the Revelation the preaching of the revealing of the word is going to be to the Sons and Daughters of God and to the lost and the lost will not hear it and we know that that this is the hour and this is the day that is being done if I can say anything this morning is to stir your hearts up to stop looking at for the future stop putting it off with an attitude that this is going to come in the future in my life when God is doing it right now this morning every time we get together God is doing it and moving in our midst and revealing things to us hallelujah whether you see it or not the word of God is going forth and being made flesh right before your very eyes we just look at it what what what are we seeing these testimonies that are coming forth these manifestations of God that are coming forth in our lives they're building faith in The Believer to recognize that what God has spoken he's actually performing it he's actually doing it in our lives it's not just a saying a religious saying a lot of people have made a lot of the things that have been spoken in the message a lot of the high words predestination election you know the spoken word is the Original Seed all these things they made it a sand they made it a religious uh a ritual that we speak these things oh we get into fellowship and as long as we can quote the uh the Bible or we can quote brother bradam to a te oh I'm spiritual I'm moving and Walking with God in my life a parent can do that I don't want to get into fellowship with a parot if I want to get into fellowship with a parrot I'll buy a parrot and I'll fellowship with him and I'll tell him what to say and he'll say it whatever pleases me I want to get into fellowship with the Holy Ghost God and flesh amen I want God looking through those eyes back at me and fellowshipping with me that very same word that being made flesh can discern the very thoughts in the intense of my heart that's what we're moving in that's what's manifesting right in our midst my brothers and sisters God is raising up a church God is raising up a bride in this hour oh yes my brothers and sisters whether you believe it or not Hallelujah whe oh I know what I'm saying whether you believe it or not I believe the message brother Tim okay amen you know brother Brown said perfect faith lies in the tapes he said that right but see God doesn't want the perfect Faith to lie in the tapes no he doesn't want it there a lot of people want to keep it there keep God in the Tes keep God in the prophet but not God today rejecting the fivefold ministry re rejecting the voice of God behind her voice where is he hiding today oh he's hitting himself again he's hiding behind the veil again in this hour he exposed himself to the prophet and we all seen it but he went back in hiding again and he'll only reveal himself to whoever he Wills that's why we got the mess in the message he doesn't want the the perfect Faith to stay in those tapes even the prophet didn't Hallelujah he wants them manifested in his bride oh yes because he said my word has gone forth to stay in the tapes no my word has gone forth and it will accomplish what I sent forth it to do Hallelujah glory to God thank you Lord amen youus thank you Lord now Faith is a substance it's not an imagination it's not a feeling or a sensation it's a substance that's a big thing right there my brothers and sisters how many people in this message are still going on that an imagination imagine I don't I don't want your imagination I don't care about your interpretation when it comes from your imagination I don't care about your interpretation when it comes by your feelings or your Sensations oh brother I got big Sensations so I believe that what what I'm saying is is right because I got big Sensations the rain falls on the just and on the unjust he pours out his Spirit upon all things now we're going to talk a little bit about how to get this word in flesh amen it's a substance especially perfect faith that is what I'm talking on tonight getting to perfect Faith that's what we're talking about get into perfect faith we want to get to perfect Faith perfect realization Hallelujah if you had perfect faith you'll look straight to the word of God and believe it and walk away whatever you're facing whatever you're going through in your life right now in your walk in your experience right now if you got perfect faith in that area you'll look straight to God God straight to his word and believe it and walk away that's it no doubt no fear no wondering no sensation no imagination but the word of God you look to and only the word Satan has got so many people off and on on so many things the diverting them detouring them distracting them with all these things when it's right in the word of God you'll look straight to the word and that's it and believe that word that's a message in itself do you believe the word hallelujah you'll have no need to come into a prayer line for somebody to pray for you not when you personally are looking to the word of God hallelujah because your perfect faith has made it done already it's finished it it's finished it it's like I said when I had uh way back in my testimony when I was delivered from certain pills that I was on for a year and a half two years I didn't have the faith to get rid of them I tried to stop them twice I couldn't get rid of them because I knew in my heart God wanted to deliver me from them it's not for everybody remember this is revealed by faith this is my testimony not yours amen amen amen so I tried to stop twice I couldn't stop them so I keep seeking the Lord and every time with more desperation and one night I was listening to this message greatest battle ever fought because that message was sent to the church and the Lord spoke to me and said it's finished it's over and when that perfect Faith came to me it was done I went through hell withdraws and everything in my body chemical imbalances everything I went through hell I thought I was going to die but God gave me a word he said listen what came in my heart if if I die I'll die believing God's word amen that's the thing when we die to believe the word of God that's being spoke to us will we allow our faith to get to that place that real in our lives I said I'll die but I will not because Satan came with fear with unbelief oh just go back go do this we can't go back back when God has spoken for us to go forward we can't God has no pleasure in the soul that draws back we got to keep going forward when he speaks no matter what it does I live I live to the Lord if I die I die in the Lord amen when you get to that place to surrender to God oh my then God is going to do something great in your life oh yeah oh yeah amen glory to God God promised the Abraham that he was going to have a son when it was impossible for Sarah to conceive God revealed to Abraham by faith then God had the to change Sarah and Abraham back to young man and woman to fulfill that promise the same promise is given to the bride today we are Abraham's seed in this hour Abraham's Faith seed look what Abraham had to go through look what he had his journey his life look how his Faith was tested along the way same way with us my brothers and sisters but you see even though Abraham took Hagar even though he listened to his wife God still wrote In the book of Hebrews that Abraham staggered not at the promises of God through unbelief so we can see the mistakes of Abraham in the flesh because remember there was a space of time of 25 years right that that that went by and listen my brothers and sisters we're all human and we're all Sons and Daughters of God but we're all human in this flesh in this Dimension and sometimes when God promises something or we're waiting for something the Manifest there's a period of time and in that time there's testing oh testing patience God brings us through the ringer sometimes to see if we believe his word he loves to test his children to believe see if they believe his word it's not a matter uh when time goes by it's not a matter if God is able to fulfill his word or he's willing to fulfill his word it's not a matter about that he has proven over and over that he's fulfilled his word and my brothers and sisters we are standing here today 2023 and God has proven his word God has made his Word Flesh again not only in a prophet Hallelujah I'm not looking just for the future future I'm not looking to the past let the profit and the future God's going to do it but I'm looking present now I believe with all my heart that this word has become flesh again and a People amen a predestinated people in this hour amen hallelujah glory to God you see God visited Sarah and revealed to her that she was going to conceive and the promise are going to be fulfilled that whole experience was God manifest in the third poll to Sarah perfect faith is going to visit the Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour oh just like it visits Sarah Sarah is a type of the Bride Abraham a type of the prophet and God visited Sarah and the third poll came to Sarah which is the revealing of the word and that's where she got the faith to conceive the child to go back in her body became a new body to receive the child can God not fulfill his word Hallelujah I don't know what I'm drinking here I thought it was clear but maybe God turned it into wine so if you see me staggering up here a little bit it's God doing it this is what you call Holy ghost's drunk Hallelujah glory to God let us move on here let us get this home here my brothers and sisters amen we're all joined together by faith here this morning looking for the word of God to to be made clear and real into our hearts amen hallelujah this is the way I preach most of you even know me Hallelujah I'm passionate what I preach and what I what I believe that's the way I am Hallelujah When Faith is revealed Hallelujah there's always a space of time look at Enoch the third pull in Enoch's walk Enoch walked with God by walking with the word now listen he walked with the word what are we doing we're walking with the word there's a transition there's a a transformation there's a change taking place here while you're walking with the word it's not that the word of God is taken un effect it's taken effect my brothers and sisters and that's what God is saying here Enoch walked with the word and by walking with the word he was walking with God and God was walking inside of him and the change took place Hallelujah God said to Enoch Enoch I've revealed so much to you you don't need to know any more in this flesh in this Dimension come home and be with me be with being coming to the perfect perfect love the perfect atmosphere realization of who I am come home like I said my brothers and sisters at the beginning are we playing Church Message Church being religious or are we walking like this do we believe that when we hear the word of God speaking into our our hearts that is actually the transformation taking place the change taking place within us I know nobody's going to say no everybody's GNA say Amen but this is real this is real amen if you really believe it hallelujah amen see Enoch was feeding on that word that is the mystery and miracle that that is unexplainable of the third poll what is it my brothers and sisters it's the creation of God it's not just preaching words to tickle your ears it's the creation of God that's going forth It's not brother Tim or any other minister it's the voice behind the voice it's the spirit that is being released behind the word of God Jesus said my my words are spirit and they are life it's the creation of God that's going forth every time the word is being spoke God is creating in me that's why we say created me a new heart created me renew my mind renew my heart this morning renew me Lord created me oh Lord is the creation of God himself listen creating in us the change that we need to live for eternity Jesus said be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect walking in perfect harmony with the spirit of Revelation upon us is the Perfection because he is the Perfection Hallelujah now Jesus say speaking here there's always the same process can can you change the law of sewing and reaping can you can you change the fact I know they're trying to do it out there but can you change the fact that you take a seed you have to put it into the ground moist ground good ground toil the ground put it into the ground let the sun shine upon it let water it and then let it come forth so every seed can you can't change that process and God has a process where his word enters into us and becomes one with us and flesh with us and that entry point I don't think maybe I'm wrong and I hope I'm wrong maybe I'm just making an assumption or assuming here but I don't think it's as important to us that entry point and as critical to us in our lives I don't know why but God keeps bringing me back to this this entry point of the Mind in the greatest battle ever fought that was through directly spoken by the prophet that God gave me this to send to the church now let us hear when Jesus said the Gates of Hell will not Prevail we all hear that what are the gates of hell my brothers and sisters you see the gates are always now listen are always on the outside of the property what does it do it keeps things from going out and it keeps things from coming in that's the gates of hell that Jesus was saying that will not Prevail against the Revelation the gates are our minds that's where the Great greatest b battle ever fought is Jesus said You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free you see you will know the truth and this last day you will know the truth all truth and it will set you free faith is the key and Truth and is what opens the gates of our minds to believe the truth that sets us free it opens up the door and sets us free from all lies doubts fears all the bondage of Satan of poverty that Satan has made us to believe in our lives God doesn't you know the lies that we have taken and brought over you know Moses he went into Egypt he met the pillar of fire but it wasn't over there yet it took 40 years to get Egypt out of Moses so God can use Moses oh my brothers and sisters it's been more than 40 years since the prophet has gone but I believe we're coming to the end here whoever takes his word and believes it God will bring it to pass that's what breaks the Gates of Hell in your life Faith in the truth that sets you free we can be blessed Satan doesn't have any power to stop your blessings of manifestation he cannot stop this word to you but he has the power to mentally block you from believing in your blessing and robbing you and bringing you in doubt and fear and that's what we have to fight that's what we're battling today because we know that the word will fulfill the word will accomplish God has the victory in the end God is the war those who I've Justified I've Sanctified those who I Sanctified I've already glorified he already got the victory in his bride in the word bride at this hour but he needs her to take the word it's when you say to this mountain when you say to this gate when you say to these things in your life it's you doing it he wants you to take the word he already proved it he already proved on Calvary The Garden of Gethsemane he already defeated the devil for us now he wants you to take the word of God and defeat the Devil oh my thank you Lord now listen we're going to do a few things hear it and start winding it down Hallelujah words are seeds words are seeds our minds we can so good or bad words in our relationships thoughts are seeds we can allow good or bad thoughts to be swn in our minds simple eh you change what you say you change what you see you change what you say if you're feeding on the word you change what you see do you want to be free you want to be free from man's and woman's opinions of you I don't want man's opinions of me I don't want what people think of me because this this flesh here I don't think much of it myself you know sometimes we live our lives it's not only out in the world right here right here we're not free we're not free from man's opinions of us their interpretations of us we're always looking over our backs to see who's watching us what they're thinking about us that's why insecurity anxiety all these things are in a rampage today everybody's caring about what people think of one another listen I want to be like that person that was playing the violin when he was playing the violin and he ended his tune there whether the people stood up and clapped or not they stood up and gave him stand in Ovation but he didn't care about that he looked to the balcony where the master was sitting and he was waiting for the Master's approval I tell you if we live our lives looking for the Master's approval in our lives we live a lot different life a lot Freer life a lot Freer of condemnation and guilt don't you realize that's the devil moving through flesh and carnality comparing one with another Hallelujah see when you walk like that my brothers and sisters you have nothing to prove then you have nothing to lose then you have nothing to gain but also you have nothing to hide I got nothing to hide I am who I am Hallelujah I am who I am oh God and ask the Lord he is who he is he is the word of God he has nothing to hide Hallelujah I will not hide my face I will not hide my heart I will not not hide my will from My bride Hallelujah glory to God thank you Lord as long as you stay under the authority his authority you will be in authority authority is always an alignment issue aligning ourselves with God's word and God's will not man's will or man's word or man's opinions or man's interpretations but God's word and God's will for our lives Hallelujah 2 Corinthians 5 uh 105 once you understand the power of your thoughts you just won't think anything James 3:1 once you understand the power of your words you just won't say anything second Corin iians 15:3 once you understand the power of your presence you just won't go anywhere what am I saying here once you understand what does that mean once you understand once you realize that the god that you serve is inside of you he's in Authority he's in control he's possessing the house he has full pramis in your life Hallelujah you won't take Jesus where you know he doesn't want to go where in your mind you won't take the word Jesus remember we're getting the mind of Christ now we won't take the word Jesus where he doesn't want to go where he's not in your mind you won't take him in your heart where he's not you won't take them in in in outside in the world into places into atmospher where he's not where he does not go when God can get a man or woman in his hands so possessed in that way then you become a hot potato to the devil Hallelujah the word in the bride has the power to speak her world then brother Bram say that you go speak your world speak the condition around your life and then go live on it I wonder what kind of world we have around us what kind of atmosphere we carry brother Brandon made that example he says I can't be around these are people in the church I can't be around certain people because of the atmosphere that they carry it's because the way they live their lives it's the way that they think in their minds it's the things that they speak whether people hear them or not it's the things that they place in their hearts the things that they see with their eyes the things that they allow to hear with their ears all these things creates an atmosphere around you then he says some people I just love to be around they have such a sweet atmosphere oh my brothers and sisters we want that atmosphere of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we want that atmosphere we got to a place in this hour we've seen what the world is doing we have walked long enough we have played messes Church long enough now it's time and I believe it's time happening I believe individuals are rising up cuz now it's time in this hour to put on this word and such a place that God will fulfill what he has spoken he's going to fulfill God is going to live it's not going to be just spoken over the pulpit it's not going to be just preached as a sermon but it's going to be lived as a sermon now that is the word made flesh again to today that's what the people are craving they're not craving church anymore the buildings that we see and all that stuff they're craving Sons and Daughters of God they want to see God in flesh again today they were in so much desperation before Jesus came Israel was in so much bondage they were crying for the Messiah and when he came on the scene he started manifesting God and flesh to the people and look at what it created my brothers and sisters and look in this hour when God became flesh again and a prophet look what the look at the attraction look at the hunger and The Thirst that the people had what what was it for a Kentucky man no it was God and a man it's God in a man are we putting it off to the Future that God's going to do it in the future and being lazy lukewarm powerless today to believe his word or are we recognizing today that today this is the day that the Lord has made I will rejoice and be glad in it I will rejoice over the word that is coming forth over and over today are we understand standing this morning or am I just speaking in Parables the life is being revealed God is speaking it's not man that is here it's God's presence it's God that is here in this hour he said I have spoken my word and my word won't return void to me but I'm here it can't be man doing it but God is here accomplish in it three kinds of people in the world today number one those who learn from their own experiences that was Solomon number two those people who learn from other people's experiences they are happy people but then number three those who don't learn from their experiences or other people's experiences they are fools they are fools Hallelujah Jesus said the thief comes to destroy and steal and kill but I have come I have come I'm not coming I have come I'm here to give you life and more abundantly Hallelujah I'm going to be finishing up soon just pray for me I I was wrestling and fighting all night two times this weekend I could have end up in the hospital but God had to manifest his word to me that he's real and he delivered me twice supernaturally hallelujah it's not about me it's about him because I have to believe this word that I'm speaking hallelujah amen let's run through this I got a couple pages left and break this bring this right home your mindset is the set of beliefs that shape you how how it makes sense it makes sense of the world that and yourself it influences how you think how you behave in any given situation it means that whatever you believe about yourself impacts the success or failures do you feel your life is within your control or your destiny to be a certain way do you believe in personal growth do you believe in transformation change or are you content to stay in your comfort zone things that we need to think about our attitude adopts adoption of our attitudes a progression press on is our attitude move forward is our attitude we're not looking to Perfection but we're looking to press on and move forward because perfection in this flesh and in this life does not exist but we can move forward and we can press on with this word hallelujah we have to be careful not to identify with our struggles with our weaknesses be very careful because they are not you when you recognize who you are you recognize you are not your struggles or your weaknesses or your failures or your sins you are not them but there's a blood Jesus Christ's blood that cleanses us so we have an atonement made for us that we can keep pressing forward and moving on with this word because that what I'm talking about this morning what the devil uses so much to stop us to condemn us from moving forward is our flesh give him the blood show him the blood show him Calvary show him the victory that Jesus gave to us and press forward with this word in your life if the enemy can control your mind he can control your thought pattern when you agree with those thoughts you believe them then they lead you into your actions your actions go according to what you think when you are watching the territory of your mind you won't let any thought come in there that is not of God now brother bran speaking here in greatest battle of F you got your senses see taste feel smell and hear they're all right but don't trust them unless they agree with the word of God don't listen to them now you got imagination conscious memory reasoning and affections they're all right if they agree with the word of God but if your affections doesn't agree with the word of God get rid of it if your reason disagrees with that word get rid of it right away if memory if your imagination if your conscience disagrees with that which which is on the inside get rid of it when God can get a man in his hands till he can get senses conscious everything cleaned out until he stands with God behind it in the spirit there there's not a devil in the world that can poke a doubt in there you want to know brother brother Tim how do I get to that place when you know there's not a devil that can poke a doubt in there you see your mind is a gate to your spirit your mind opens up and accepts the spirit or rejects the spirit you can have little conscience and little feelings and little Sensations and all these things we talked about all this stuff that has nothing to do with it but when it comes down to reality your mind opens it up your mind either accepts it or rejects it my friends Hallelujah now listen brother brandom notice the Harmony in the father and the son Jesus Jesus never did anything until it first shown to him by the Father John 5:19 so we just read this quote brother brand I'm talking about the mind and not accepting everything that's not of the word of God now he's speaking here the harmony between the father and the son now he's getting into the relationship that he had with the father this harmony now not tomorrow not in the future Brother Brad saying now exists between the groom and his bride the same Harmony why because she's got her mind under the control of the word of God that's why now listen he shows her his Word of Life she receives it not anything else not our emotions not our feelings not anything the word God don't come to you by feeling or emotion when he comes he's the word he shows you his word personally to you in your life he places that word because it's a part of you it's your part to fulfill now listen she receives it she never dealt it why can she never dealt doubt it my brothers and sisters because she has cleaning out her mind she's taken all reasoning all doubt everything that's against the word of God she's cast it out of her mind she's gone through the process that's why she's in this place now where she's in harmony with the father with the groom they becoming one and the same she never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death nothing can harm her what can harm you this morning what are you fearing this morning that that you believe or you think Satan can harm you with nothing can harm you this morning not even death death where is your sting grave where is your Victory but thanks be to God he gives me and you that Victory absent from the body present with the Lord me being here and all these men of God and the saints of God being here benefits you but me being gone benefits me Hallelujah for if the seed be planted the water will rise it up again here's the secret of this now listen we're winding it down now the word is in the bride as it was with Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs it and commands of the word in his his name for she has thus sayeth the Lord now we're going back remember to the beginning of the service put it all together my word won't return to me void my word has gone forth now my word is not staying on the tapes my word is not just staying my life in flesh is not just staying back there in a prophet we're bringing it home here today in me and and you if it doesn't bring Faith to me and you then what is it doing she performs it then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to P like a seed is planted in the water comes the full Harvest servant is perfect those in the bride do only his will no one no man no organization no movement can make them do otherwise they have thus sayeth the Lord or they keep still they have thus sayith the Lord I'm going to go on they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his Works while he was here on his Earthly Ministry and he did didn't complet it in this day back just with the prophet was not completed no sir so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must do but he will now fulfill through the bride are we listening that work which he left for this specific time seven Church ages pergamus Church age yes sir there's no longer the yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it's its own mouthpiece oh okay you know what we had a man of God and we still have a man of God in my life for 30 something years preaching over this pulpit and this man of God because of him I have boldness to speak the word of God because I I've seen this man of God which is our pastor Simon speak things that other people weren't speaking at certain times and it showed me and gave me the faith that when God wanted to come to me as an individual and say speak this I ain't Bound By Any tradition in this message or any person or personality in this message the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it's his own mouthpiece let me tell you and I'm going to speak what I believe in my heart this message is no longer the mouthpiece of God oh that's tough what do you mean brother Tim the mess age the message is in confusion now I'm not talking about the word I'm not talking about Christ I'm not talking about the bride no so God is turning to her who's her this is out of the prophet's own mouth God has turned into her he will confront her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her yes sir yeah that's what he said yes sir it is for it says in the last chapter of the Book of Revelations musicians come Revelation 17 the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear directly from God as in Pentecost that word bride will be the same as the first my brothers I want to finish this but I'm I'm just got no energy left I am drained yes listen to the prophet of God who appears in the last age what he says from God the bride will say the spirit and the prophet and the bride will say the same thing what they will say we will have have already been said in the word they are saying it now come out from amongst her and be separated the cry has gone out is going out now God still has a voice for the people in the world and he has given a voice to the bride that voice is in the bride Hallelujah let's stand I just got no more energies father just take control Lord as I commit myself to thee in Jesus name God bless you [Applause] Saints Oh Come Oh Come [Music] immanu and Ransom [Music] captive that Mo LLY Exile until the Son of God appear Rejoice REO [Music] shall come to [Music] oh oh come this spring come and our spirit and bur the GL CR of night and that's Dark Shadows put to Rejoice [Music] Rejoice you has come to all isra [Music] all of you in the house of the Lord lots of wonderful familiar faces uh here and we uh we just Rejoice to see you together amen God bless you real good um just a commentary in the sense that um uh I believe it's in the present stage of my Ministry 1962 brother brandham said oh at last the separating time has come the separating time has come and as I listened to brother Tim uh this morning and thinking of the other brothers and their Ministry of the word then I began to think of Ruth how she was stresing in the field which is to say the the Harvesters had already passed and now the bride uh Ruth was now picking up the last grains that happened to be still laying around somewhere searching for them so I'm applying that to the fact that we are in that level now where these brothers are preaching and we are actually searching we are seeking just to find that last one somewhere covered up by a layer of dirt covered up by layers of problems covered up in every way with every possible uh disguise Satan could put on them yeah Satan will just put mud on the son of a king or turn him to look like a beggar and look like something else when he is nothing of the kind but thanks be to God the separating time has come the Holy Spirit the real Holy Spirit uh you know I was thinking about it when the message came to myself and another brother we are still still in touch we still talk and the message came I was in the heights of Pentecost uh we were in the heights of Pentecost and then I can see that all these Miracle signs and wonders that were happening in me uh in Pentecost God was using us and you were having Revival and that sort of thing but then I could see that it was moving from that back to the word I hadn't heard about brother brandham yet so when his message came and I read that first book uh in the heart here and knew this was it it was the word is to come to the fullness of the word and where we are now is what brother Tim was doing trashing trashing trying to find the last seed the last ones that may be out here and so I pass by I see the churches the parking lots filled thousands of people and we know we have the truth and yet we just have a certain amount maybe a few hundred people and sometimes the human part you wonder why but no know the holy spirit said this is what I said it'll be a narrow way and few there be that will find it amen we have the highway and then we have Lanes in the highway right uh some struggle to even find the right Highway uh and then uh to they find the highway but they can't keep in their Lane but we thank God that the holy spirit is using these brothers to keep us in the lane now remember they all different they they can't be me and they are not me and I am not them we are part of the five-fold ministry and and I'm so thankful to uh brother uh our brother Tim using the reference of how the faith the perfect faith is not in the tapes it's not going to lay in the tapes the perfect faith is going to come into the hearts of God's people and that's where the perfect Faith becomes effective uh because faith without works is dead and it has to work through somebody amen and God always hides in Simplicity brother's last thought was on the hiding God hiding himself and he always hides himself to look so simple and looks like nothing it doesn't appear to be anything and he says if you're not watching that thing'll pass right by you and you would't even recognize what is going on I believe we are living in this time right now and I believe that that message that we heard for those who have ears to hears they will hear it and it will be a real blessing to them now in the weeks ahead we have our Christmas um uh dinner coming up is that right next week next Sunday okay next Sunday will be our Christmas Christmas dinner I hope all of you can be there there's no excuse for not being there you say brother Simon I can't afford it brother Simon I don't have money uh well God bless you because God has anointed and blessed some Believers enough to be able to say no I'll not only pay for myself I'm I'm going to leave enough for about 10 others or or so to be able to come if they don't have the funds okay now now it's right there so you don't have an excuse that of why you're not there because you couldn't afford it because just like he did the Believers now do it uh God has already made the way for you so so don't be afraid don't feel embarrassed or in any way but just walk right in and rejoice like everybody else when that time comes praise the Lord amen and God bless you in all the weeks ahead to the end of the year I believe it's 50 days left um uh uh towards the Handover or the turnover of this ministry to the hands of brother Danny and sister Jennifer misil and the word of God remember the faces may change is that right the color of the person may change the the they built of the person I'm sorry just my I'm just being natural that's all is uh may change but the word continues amen listen at the voice praise the Lord listen to The Voice and I know what I'm saying don't be influenced praise the Lord you know when I was very young and I began to preach the word the church filled up with a whole lot of young ladies no that's I'm telling you the truth it filled up with a lot of young ladies and um they were always talking to me nicely oh brother Simon over brother Simon and of course their mothers will invite me to their home and when I go they'll have their daughter serving and bringing out nice Delicacies and stuff like that and that I was so focused on the holy spirit that it it annoyed me uh and so I spoke to the elderly brother that was the one that um led us to Pentecost and said brother brother Alexander what's going on what's Happening why why where are they doing this and all he could do was just chuckle he just bowed his head and he had a big chuckle then he says Oh Brother these things happen because God could allow all of that happen but from amongst them the holy spirit will call out those that are really his okay he says other than that that attraction is caused by the Holy Spirit again right to bring them really to himself not to you so that you don't make a mistake and think that it's just attraction by you but this is to point back to the word amen praise the Lord I want you to know that we are not to be influenced by outward appearance let us be influenced only by the word I'll speak rank raw whether a black man is preaching it whether a white man is preaching it whether a Chinese is preaching it whether a Japanese is preaching it doesn't matter who is preaching it listen to The Voice hear the word of God amen and I can speak like that because um I went to school with every race and Jews white black everything else and um when my Ministry started it started that way I the church would start and there were only 6,000 whites in the country and maybe a few thousand Jews uh Portuguese a few but before I knew it my church was always filled with mixed it never was one set of people it was always mixed not by my choice not by my searching for anybody it just happens that way and I believe that happens because if your spirit is pure and clear God completely does that on his own and people know it you you just can't hide stuff like that it's right in you and as a brother preached you create an atmosphere around you and that atmosphere with you so I want you to know right now praise God let the Holy Spirit be the center of your influence amen is that right amen let him be the one that will charge and recharge and Quicken your life and keep you solidly in line with the word of God Amen praise God I I say these things because I know many times the um senior pastor or experienced Pastor older Pastor leaves and then a few people just want to uh leave and slide away this way or that way or the other way but don't let it be that way because who who who is your eyes on you're to look away to Jesus amen right praise the Lord I'll be around but you're not looking to me you're look into him and if you have really caught the revelation of this last prophet's message your eyes will be on him alone am is that right praise the name of the Lord God bless you I've sat under I've sat under women preachers I've sat under East Indian pastors I've sought under white pastors I've sought under black pastors I've sought under every kind and brother sister I always listen for the word amen and not when I'm in the message be even from before that's the reason why they threw me out of Pentecost because I always listen for the word and the word is the main thing we are to listen for now I'm not going to hold you any longer I think I said enough I just throw out a few things there um it's just for you to start thinking preparing your hearts preparing your minds because uh in the words of the Prophet two of us can't be on the scene at the same time right the spirit of God came down Jesus came down he said now I have to go now I don't have to go like he went I mean he's gone he's gone home but I I have to move off of the scene so that our brother's Ministry can begin to bloom and Blossom that it can grow that it can manifest itself in its individual way I know that our brother thinks it's happening now but really it's not happening now it's only after I step away then the spirit of God can transfer himself right as it did from Moses on down so the spirit of God moves like that God has a way of doing things it doesn't look like if it's oh there's no order there was you know there's no regimentation but God has his way of doing things amen and everything works out for his honor and for his glory so so I will be stepping away um as uh as of January first uh brother Danny and sister Jennifer here will be in charge of the church and the flock of God that is among you will follow the leadership of the holy spirit that will be projecting itself through them for God's glory and for God's honor are you willing to do that amen [Applause] praise the Lord the Lord bless you real good and I I want to thank God for all these wonderful brothers and many of them who have followed uh me and this message for this hour um some for 27 years some 30 some you know like that uh following the word but the hour has come now where um physically I look physically still physically fit um but I can escape the the Journey of Father time uh moving on and I just thank God I'm still able to walk without a stick or a crutch or anything like that I I want to thank God for that and I want to thank God for all of you who are here that have always prayed and supported the ministry in every possible way now the church is going to grow beyond what it is right now and um things are going to happen just let's leave it there but God's holy spirit is going to move in a wonderful miraculous and wonderful way that you hardly expect because it's not going to be of man it's going to be of God it's his choosing of what he wants to do praise the Lord Brother thank you for giving me this time to be able to speak to the people God bless [Applause] [Music] you par see everybody out you are dismissed oh uh with respect to the uh Christmas dinner okay um it is next Sunday and as you heard Pastor Simon say there's absolutely no excuse for anybody not to be there if you're in town and you don't have any other uh serious commitment and you're part of this church family then you need to be at the family dinner amen however he said just come on in and join us they have to have the dinner plates ready and we need to know exactly who's going to be there okay so you can come in last minute but we need to know
