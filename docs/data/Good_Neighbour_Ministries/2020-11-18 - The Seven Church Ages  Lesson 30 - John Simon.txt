TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] how wonderful it is to be in the house of god once again thanks be to our blessed lord jesus christ uh last week we came to the end of our talk and today we begin the end of the ephesians search age and now we come to the introduction and entry into the church age of smyrna or the smyrnian church age our scripture is this today out of the book of revelation chapter 2 verse 8 and unto the angel of the church in smyrna right these things said the first and the last which was dead and is alive our gracious heavenly father as we have read out of the book of life we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ that your great holy spirit will speak through your temple and glorify your name make your word clear father that we may hear that we may understand that we may see and perceive what it is that you are doing and making known to us for this day and hour we ask your blessing in the name of jesus christ our lord amen praise god hallelujah amen and unto the angel of the church of smyrna right these things saith he that was the first and the last which was dead and is alive now we just want to refresh your mind again at this time and show how we arrive at the names of these messengers to the various church ages now of course god has allowed us to be able to recognize this first of all by history history of the new testament church was not lost we know we have the scripture but the history of the new testament church was not lost but god allowed that also to be preserved so that we may have a record of the actions activities and methods of these various messengers down through the ages of the church of god just as much as the history of israel the nation of israel god did not let their history go but he recorded it in what we know as the old testament helping us to have a clear understanding of what happened to israel and now we see god allowing the knowledge and history of the new testament church to be kept so that we may be able to ascertain who the various messengers of these church ages are and now of course we know that the bible that was given to us israel's part that they played in the formation of the bible and then god supernaturally allowed divine corroboration of these facts by multitudes of scrolls that were kept that were uncovered discovered multitudes of of scrolls that were found in kumram there in israel and god blessed me and been able to visit there to see where the goat herder true stone to be able to get his goats to go moving and the stone went into the mouth of a cave and struck on a vessel and the hollow sound attracted his attention and there he went into the cave and found these uh scrolls within these uh these uh great big urns that were in there and other artifacts and other forms of archaeology have been uncovered that actually approves and corroborates the words of our bible the places the names the cities are all there in the bible and when they are followed up they can be found to be true and they they match what is being said in history concerning them praise god hallelujah so in reading the history of the new testament church we know paul was the first the original messenger to the church age and we particularly place paul as the messenger of the ephesian church age now all the other messengers that were to follow in history the closest of them to approximately with paul are the ones that may be and can be and will be identified as the messenger to that particular age so you see as paul was used to bring the people back to the word so were these messengers these angels angels meaning messenger messenger of god all these great uh messengers that were used of god were used of god to bring the people of the age back to the word the age that was before may have drifted away from the word of god and when they have drifted away from the word of god god brings a man on the scene and he will use that man as his his anointed vessel to bring the people back to his original word and so those are the ones that we will examine and look at as we see the ages progressing down through the corridors of time and out of these we will find one for every age will will stand out i will find that the one is friends one that is the closest uh to the word and one that will closely hold to the word of god in his pattern of life pattern of ministry and in the power of the word that flows through him now that one such a one would be the messenger for that particular age praise god now just read the read the history read histories read the book of revelation and you will find friends of all the patterns all the things said in the book of revelation and when you check it against history you will see how it matches or our history corroborates the things lots of the things that were said in this book of revelation lots of the conditions spoken of in this book of revelation can be seen through the lens of history we will be able to recognize the age and time in which we are living now of course the history must follow what the bible says forth we look at the history and where the when the history matches the bible and it shows the life of that man or messenger matches the bible and what was spoken of that particular messenger how he will be and how he would live it's there within the word of god now thank god the the bible is not a book of my friends that is difficult it's god really hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself in the very same thing and we thank god for that so we ascertain this as we look at the bible we see god operating in simplicity praise god amen and we also look to see god's vindication not only is the man the season and time identified by history cooperating with the words of the bible what it says about the conditions of the end times that would exist but also we recognize the by the vindication of the holy spirit the same god that vindicated abel in the garden of eden of eden the same god who vindicated moses by the pillar of fire the same god who vindicates his servants down through the ages right to the last messenger william marian branham over whom appeared the great halo of light the great appearance of the angels of god that came down and spoke with him on sunset mountain in arizona vindication by god also by science wonders mighty miracles and prophecy by the declarations of the holy spirit so god identifies his messengers then god vindicates his messengers and proves that they are his they are sent from him they are anointed by him they are used by him and vindicated by him to him be all the praise the honor and the glory are blessed lord jesus amen praise god now to look at the messenger my friends and using the principles and rules of god's own choosing we can unhesitately declare that irenaeus was exalted by the lord to this position of the messenger of smyrna now to speak of iranians first of all he was a disciple of the great saint polycarp amen so he was a disciple he sat at the feet of polycarp was taught the word by polycarp and moved and lived after the the model lifestyle and walk of the great saint polycarp it is no doubt that all the christian virtues and graces that flowed from his life my friends life that was consecrated was just marvelous and wonderful to behold now polycarp was a man holy dedicated to the lord and a great man an illustrious saint through all the ages his life lights up the pages of history and gives us a magnificent example of what it means to be a son of the living and servant of the living god when we look at his life he lived a blameless life in the presence of almighty god he lived a sincere honest life righteous in the presence of the lord and in view of the saints of the living god you will remember or you will if you don't remember let me make this known polycarp was martyred he was killed because of his faith in the living god and polycarp what a wonderful man no he felt that he was too old to flee for his life and he was such a sincere man that he did not want to endanger the lives of those that would try to hide him keep him or protect him so he told them to go and he gave himself up unto death but before when the authorities took him and carried him away before executing him he asked for permission to have a time of prayer and there history records that he prayed for about two hours and he prayed for the governor and he prayed for his brethren and the lord that god will keep them safe and protect them he prayed for his enemies that hated him and he prayed for his captors who had captured him praise the lord and he did this i am sure because in his heart of hearts he desired to have a better resurrection and to walk with the saints above glory be to god hallelujah he stood firm on the word of god they wanted him to deny the lord jesus they wanted to be to him to deny his faith but he stood firm in the light of opposition and refused to deny jesus christ and deny the true faith of the living god and so he died with a free and clear conscience of being ready to meet the lord the scene was of such they had prepared a stake and they tied him the great polycarp was tied secured to that particular stake but when that tied him to their surprise he told them he would not run he would not try to escape untie me i don't want to be tied so they took off the ropes from him and there he was surrounded by the wood around him and there lit all of the wood around him so the fire was lit and with the fire roaring around him the captors noticed that instead of the fire consuming him the fires moved away from him and would not touch him where he was a man kept by the power and presence of almighty god like daniel and the four boy and the boys and the free boys in the fairy furnace there it was the fire refused to touch him and when the fire would not touch him they reached through the fire and pierced him in his sight with a sword and when they did that out of his body gushed so much water that it drowned all the flames and killed the fire that was set to consume him oh my and then they saw his spirit leaving his body you see how can they see a spirit well it came out in the form of a snow white dove as it left his body and ascended in the air oh thanks be to god hallelujah on the wings of the snow white dove god sends his pure sweet love a sign from above on the wings of a dove on the wings of a snow white dove that was released out of his body his spirit in that form went to be with the lord hallelujah uh but for all this marvelous wonderful testimony of polycarp uh we find out that he of course was a disciple and student of john the revelator take this follow it john the revelator polycarp was one of his disciples taught by him walk with him finally he leaves the scene polycarp continues on taking the fullness of the word and walking with it with sincerity honesty and dedication to god and he was martyred when he was smart as we've said his spirit left his body in the form of a snow white dove and now we are looking through his religious walk he was not a militant he was not militant at all matter of fact he was not against the nicolaitan system he tend to believe in cooperation with them association with them and that he would be able to find fellowship by being able to get along with them not realizing see that that was a trick of the devil the devil can act smooth and and so nice like a cat and the moment that he is aroused the claws come out so we must be very careful of the nicolaitan denominational systems systems as a whole that we have around us amen so here was polycarp ending his days being tricked by satan and thinking that the fellowship and association with the nicolasians was all right then along comes irenaeus irenaeus was not so he was militant and against every form of organization his life's history tells us that the way he served the lord the powers of god the manifestations of the holy spirit that flowed through him and he taught the word with such clarity and confirmity praise god when we think of irenas his militancy when we think of the manifestations of the holy spirit a man who believed in the operations of the holy spirit of god in the midst of the church a man who believed and taught the clarity of the word of the living god now we know this because from history of irenius and his the churches he had raised up in the nation of france these churches were known to have the gifts of the holy spirit moving amongst them the saints of god were anointed by the holy ghost many spoken towns and prophesied under the divine inspiration of the holy spirit it was known by history that the dead was even raised up amongst them many a time under the holy spirit of the living god oh praise god healings miracles signs and wonders amongst them by the prayer of earnest prayer of faith hallelujah amen but the point that is being made he had the vindication but he himself stood against all forms of organization because he saw the danger in organized brotherhood let me use a word that was clearer in other words he was against ministerial fraternities ministerial some may call them holy orders he was against such things and stayed with the fullness of the word of the living god so he he went against these organized uh ministers uh meetings and ministers fraternities and ministers orders he stood out against that but with pastors and on other elders of the church of god and stood my friends solidly unified with the holy spirit's power and gifts manifesting within the his local church of the living god and god honored him with the powerless presence and vindication manifesting among the saints of god that were there with him thank god for a man like this we need more men of iranian's quality in this our day and our time to cut through the chaos cut through the madness cut through the blackness and bring the marvelous glorious light of our lord jesus christ and bring to the people what they should hear not what they think they should hear but what god wants them to hear and many times they will not be happy no child is happy when given the medicine that they really need they think they don't need it but you do need it you do not need to have one aspect of a thing but you want to hear god's point of view you may have your view you may have your idea with our human minds we think we have it and then god come overrides that and sends his word and speak to us what is thus saith the lord that we may understand the day in which we live we find that polycarp was clear and definitive in his understanding of the godhead i'm speaking now of how polycarp understood the godhead and since he was a disciple of polycarp who in turn was a disciple of john the revelator we know from that that he had the perfect correct biblical and scriptural teaching directly from god through john through polycarp then to him that there is only one god and the trinity or trinitarian doctrine did not exist it was not part of the world it came much later in human history it began to be presumed and propounded by so-called men of human learning but ignorant and like contrary like a mule to the fullness and clarity of the word of god for they are entrenched in their own ideas entrenched in their own ways and will not look to the word of god oh look and live my brother live look to jesus now and live oh praise the lord hallelujah lord of god look to jesus now and live now in volume 1 page 412 of the anti-nicean fathers we have this statement by arrhenius which he spoke or wrote on the godhead listen all the other expressions likewise bring out the title of one and the same being the lord of power the lord the father of all god almighty the most high the creator and maker and such like these are not the names these are not the names and the titles of a succession of beings but they are the titles of one and the same praise god thank god he taught the godhead correctly that father son holy ghost are not a succession of names of different beings but they are the titles of the one and the same being the one true god hallelujah amen one true not one triune as the devil tried to trick the world but one true god amen jesus christ the lord god almighty the mighty god the one and everlasting father and the prince of peace praise god hallelujah amen so you see irenaeus was pointing out that these are what titles just as the titles rose of sharon brighton warning star lily of the valley fairest of ten thousand these are only titles of one person amen but there because there is only one god and thanks be to god he has made that known to many of us that his name is jesus christ the lord jesus christ hallelujah all praise god forevermore are my thus friends irenius with strict adherence to the word of god with his wonderful understanding of the word of god and with the of a vindication the accompaniment yeah the presence of the holy spirit god's attendance of his meetings with his power his presence his angels amen god's sovereign grace was upon his entire ministry as he was used of god and it shows to us that he was and is the right choice for the age of slurner oh praise god it's so unfortunate that the other ages did not have in their messengers such a balance of fruit power and divine anointed leadership in the holy spirit and by the word of god for that hour may god rest his gallant soul may the lord bless this soldier of the cross for next week we will enter into stud going into the church day smyrna the city of smyrna the conditions of the times and prepare our hearts as we enter and unfold this church age the smurnian church age may god bless you may you take the name of jesus with you oh praise god forevermore i am blessed i am blessed i am blessed i thank god for you and give him all the glory god bless you until next week we will meet again around the word of god god bless you so much [Music] amen [Music] you
