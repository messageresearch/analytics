[3:06] get refreshed in the work I'm Billy
[3:09] I can easy sometimes you know it's not
[3:12] for me to get their imagination because

[3:21] about say leave up what this work first
[3:23] that's what we have to do sometimes I
[3:26] look beyond natural you know infirmities
[3:31] and something that I want the Word of
[3:33] God they meant Olivia the faeces one
[3:37] three does it be the God and father of
[3:40] our Lord Jesus Christ have blessed us
[3:42] with all spiritual blessings they say
[3:45] some are all all in heavenly places in
[3:50] Christ accorded as he has chosen us in
[3:53] him before the foundation of the world
[3:57] that we should be holy and without blame
[3:59] before him in love we just got to read
[4:02] these two just read the Word of God in
[4:05] this sea we don't have to do much park
[4:07] but minister the Bible says is bringing
[4:10] you into
[4:11] of what has already been said spoken by
[4:14] the Apostles by the Prophet our prophet
[4:16] and the Lord Jesus Christ himself that's
[4:19] it they been having predestinated us
[4:23] unto adoption of children by Jesus
[4:25] Christ to himself according to the good
[4:29] pleasure of his will to the praise of
[4:33] the glory of His grace wherein he had
[4:35] made us accepted in the beloved were
[4:37] already accepted in whom we have
[4:41] redemption through his blood and
[4:43] forgiveness of sin according to the
[4:46] riches of His grace where he had come
[4:49] towards us all wisdom and prudence how
[4:54] to make known unto us the mystery of his
[4:57] will for he's made known unto us he's
[4:59] forgiven us wisdom according to the his
[5:06] good pleasure that he had purposed in
[5:08] himself so he purposed in himself that
[5:11] he was going to do everything that he
[5:14] was he was going to do to us that the
[5:19] dispensation of the fullness of times
[5:21] might gather together in one all things
[5:24] in Christ both which are in heaven which
[5:27] are earth even in him in whom also we
[5:32] have obtained an inheritance being
[5:34] predestinated according to its purpose
[5:36] to the purpose of him who worketh all
[5:40] things after the counsel of his own will
[5:46] through the council is
[5:48] in our lives so this is speaking of him
[5:54] what is speaking of us is speaking of
[5:56] the Dominion he has in us and what he's
[6:00] done for us when he surrender our will
[6:03] to him we surrender our lives to him
[6:06] then we come under this promise this
[6:09] blessing amen
[6:12] 2nd Peter 1 verse 8 to 15 or if these
[6:29] things be in you and abound they make
[6:34] you that ye shall never be barren nor
[6:39] unfruitful in the knowledge of the Lord
[6:42] Jesus Christ
[6:44] Wow never but he a lot of these things
[6:50] is blind and cannot see afar and had
[6:55] forgotten that he was was purged from
[7:01] his old sins wherefore the rather being
[7:05] given disease to make your calling and
[7:08] election sure for if you do these things
[7:13] you shall never fall that's what we want

[7:22] mental amnesia dementia Alzheimer's

[7:34] age and this is all connected to the
[7:37] mind amen
[7:41] and forgetting is the biggest part of if
[7:46] you
[7:47] the science of it forgetting forgetting
[7:53] things

[9:46] trusting in our endeavors and that's
[9:48] what quickest us that's what strengthens
[9:50] us and that's what gives us Lord the
[9:54] ability to move and press on into the
[9:57] image that you have prepared for us
[9:59] that's what the absolute feeds off of
[10:03] that's what the attribute father grows

[11:30] miracles and we can lead different and
[11:33] changed he'd rather father in Jesus name
[11:36] we pray amen
[11:38] you may be seated I realize what this
[11:47] message together
[11:49] I got a few minutes they sign of
[11:52] increasing up ahead but we all do I just
[11:56] hit on some things tonight but there's
[11:59] so much in this series that would make a
[12:02] serious offer because it's it's a day
[12:06] that we're living it this age that we're
[12:10] living it it's the Battle of the
[12:12] pepperball true that we're facing every
[12:15] day brother Graham says the greatest
[12:17] battle ever fought is in the mind and
[12:20] this is where where you talk about in
[12:23] the greatest pilot reply talk about the
[12:25] victory of the life of Jesus Christ a
[12:28] victory unraveled
[12:29] has to come by the spine overcome
[12:33] because the mind is not what it is the
[12:37] channel is not what it is but the Word
[12:39] of God comes to the - holding to the
[12:41] mind and then it comes down to the
[12:43] channel and when the light comes down to
[12:45] the channel and everything is cleared
[12:48] out and purged out then the life of
[12:50] Christ comes and that's what we want we
[12:53] want the life of Christ in this last day
[12:55] we don't want religion we don't want a
[12:58] Pentecostal faith we want this faith the
[13:01] original faith the truth baby
[13:04] amen and in order for that to happen the
[13:08] channel has to be cleared up and too
[13:10] many times we're finding people that
[13:13] they're not people from here sir God
[13:21] every day I see here up to here for
[13:23] myself that has get worse and worse and
[13:26] last words people are becoming insane
[13:28] where I believe and Trust at times where
[13:31] I see people I'm not looking the other
[13:33] way because you see the uncertainty and
[13:36] being in possession I'm talking the
[13:38] church where there's a life
[13:42] problems happening and we must have the
[13:47] mind of Christ we must renew our mind in
[13:50] Christ in the Word of God daily we
[14:06] really realized and powered the forces
[14:09] of darkness is the evil that is out
[14:11] there of unbelief we're program since we
[14:16] have been driving a little bit of length
[14:17] because in this dangerous old godless
[14:20] yes religion yes big churches but but
[14:24] this no like openness to live the life
[14:28] of Christ or come lives have be mold and
[14:31] shape into Pacific including to the
[14:34] church our personality but in His image
[14:38] demon that's what this is all about
[14:41] that's what preaching the Word of God
[14:43] comes for and then what you sit in these
[14:47] pews what are you coming to church and I
[14:51] see I look at this right by something
[14:55] change me to the bone that I know I
[14:59] think
[15:06] pure Word of God I got no excuse each
[15:10] and every one of us have heard enough we
[15:13] have no excuse you're not put on this
[15:16] word to not overcome to not press it to
[15:20] the kingdom I don't care how young you I
[15:22] don't care for their teenager it doesn't
[15:25] matter
[15:25] God speaks to all the many cities all
[15:29] ages all ages because he said I won't
[15:35] lose one and we don't learn a lot space
[15:42] hallelujah and Matthew 16 you know the
[15:49] scripture is what we're going to go over
[15:50] them he said up to them but whom say ye
[15:57] that I am the Simon Peter answered and
[16:02] said thou art the Christ the Son of the
[16:06] Living God Jesus has said blessed art
[16:10] thou simon petrikov flesh and blood has
[16:13] not revealed about you but my father
[16:15] which is heaven and I say unto thee thou
[16:19] art Peter and upon this rock revelation
[16:22] I will build my church and the gates of
[16:24] Hell shall not prevail against it I will
[16:28] give you unto thee the keys of the
[16:31] kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou
[16:33] bind on earth shall be bound in heaven
[16:37] whatever else shall loose on earth shall
[16:40] be loosed in heaven now think about it
[16:44] he was given the keys we are keeping the
[16:47] keys the keys a thing and he says the
[16:53] gates of Hell will not prevail against
[16:56] the revelation and he also said 100 you
[17:01] say whatever you find
[17:03] Luce will be done but these are under
[17:07] conditions of Revelation these are under
[17:10] conditions that that word of God is come
[17:14] to you and you have come under beatings
[17:17] to that word of God what has been
[17:21] revealed
[17:27] spirituality Jie brother branham talking
[17:29] here just trying to find my study here
[17:38] that's so easy today and we forget
[17:42] sometimes what a Christian Church is we
[17:46] act like the world that shows that we
[17:51] got spiritual amnesia because now you
[17:55] don't act like that the Christian you're
[17:59] supposed to be you act like the world
[18:01] you receive the heart of the world and
[18:04] it causes this here we find that Israel
[18:08] had exposed to the world and had fell
[18:11] into its run and this prophet was sent
[18:17] to dig them out of it if we could I
[18:20] would tell them God by His grace chose
[18:24] Israel all the rest of the families of
[18:26] the earth Greece had did that he didn't
[18:32] give them the choice when he gave them
[18:36] houses that they never built God did
[18:41] that he gave them parks that they never
[18:44] want he eat the food that they never
[18:48] planted he gave them wells that they
[18:51] never done he gave you the victories and
[18:54] they never won he gave them grace that
[18:59] they never married
[19:00] God did that by His grace or his people
[19:04] his nose
[19:39] [Music]
[19:51] [Music]
[20:05] [Music]
[20:26] where we see that all things work
[20:29] together for good we place ourselves and
[20:37] 2018 today here without his race it's
[20:44] impossible
[20:45] I wanna describe here what that is
[20:55] now we're taught absolute eggs of
[20:59] spiritual brother breath he preached the
[21:02] message the spiritual amnesia
[21:06] it's going to be do you really good PTA
[21:12] is the state of confusion that occurs of
[21:15] meal inequality a traumatic brain injury
[21:18] TBI in which the entry person is deep
[21:24] disoriented and not able to remember
[21:27] events that occurred not with the injury
[21:30] the person may be unable to state his or
[21:36] her name with meat or she is and what
[21:40] type today's is the continuous memory
[21:45] returns PTA is considered to have result
[21:50] resolved
[21:53] why PTA blacks new events cannot be
[21:58] stored in the memory
[22:00] now type all the spiritual I want you
[22:04] just the soak it in because that's the
[22:06] message lost on you understand a little
[22:08] bit more about the third about a third
[22:15] of patients with black head injuries are
[22:18] reported to have islands of memories in
[22:21] which the patient can recall only some
[22:25] events during PTA the faces conscious is
[22:30] clouded remember brother Graham talk
[22:33] about that evil he's an eagle they said
[22:37] the cover was covered over his eyes his
[22:41] ways talk about where you can't see that
[22:43] evil because PTA involves confusion in
[22:52] addition to the memory loss typically of
[22:55] amnesia
[22:56] the term post-traumatic confusional
[23:00] state and
[23:01] and proposed as an ultimatum Deuteronomy
[23:12] 9 7 remember and forget not how bogus
[23:19] the Lord
[23:19] I thought to wrap in the wilderness from
[23:22] the day that thou eatest depart out of
[23:24] the land of Egypt until he came to the
[23:28] place he had been really rebellious
[23:31] against the Lord the Lord speaking here
[23:36] how can two walk together unless they
[23:40] agree Amos 3:3 the more you know who you
[23:45] are in Christ the more your behavior
[23:48] will reflect your true identity do not
[23:54] be conformed to this world now that does
[23:58] me just worldly things but the world
[24:01] Cosmo and every single one of us finally
[24:06] they by name because they are in the
[24:10] world were not moved beyond the world of
[24:12] one where in the world were tempted to
[24:15] be like the world pretended to think
[24:18] like the world but you see when we mix
[24:22] with the world you say brother - I don't
[24:26] got DJ I got a visa when you mix with
[24:31] the things of the world
[24:34] they're coming on your spiritual amnesia
[24:38] to the revelation of the word not to the
[24:47] alcohol the swab tube to lift an
[24:50] effective personal life you need to know
[24:52] and believe who you are in Christ in
[24:58] Christ it's critical to the lipid life
[25:02] as of God intended you to live the best
[25:05] way to renew your mind and experience
[25:07] the inner transformation is my know that
[25:11] thinking and speaking out loud
[25:12] the revelation God is giving you in this
[25:15] hour of who you are in Christ when you
[25:21] look through the message when I study to
[25:23] the message there's nothing I can see
[25:27] but the word coming to us to identify us
[25:34] [Music]
[25:39] because remember Jesus enough when he
[25:44] was in this healthy that peasant he knew
[25:48] all things even as a child he knew all
[25:50] things he was the plan
[25:53] he did my box no movie what we what we
[26:10] were born on desert but there's
[26:12] something inside of us say more than
[26:18] this this like it cost you to speak to
[26:22] us because it was the afternoon that
[26:24] held up in a we need us time you look at
[26:33] your life the situation around
[26:39] what was taking place because in this
[26:42] ears around there was an awakening there
[26:45] was a resurrection community arrived and
[26:50] I meet you in person with a gun I don't
[26:53] know I first heard the word of God I
[26:55] found out when I study here I don't need
[26:58] to accomplish much but the first thing I
[27:00] heard was the scripture that spoke to me
[27:03] and said you must repent and be baptized
[27:08] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[27:10] the remission of your sins and that ye
[27:13] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[27:14] when I heard that for the first time the
[27:18] blogs about the church religion that
[27:21] struck me so tell me why did you start
[27:27] to break there was an awakening to the
[27:32] seat of God what take place to return
[27:38] this word of God's sake this afternoon
[27:43] what
[27:48] it's gotta be the word got one for the
[27:52] GMB shall wait for me what's going to
[27:55] keep all these medical illnesses away
[27:57] from me
[27:57] both naturally is fiercely the Word of
[28:00] God did feed on the word that made don't
[28:06] tell me you just I just read it to you I
[28:09] know all these things but the Bible says
[28:11] the Apostle said bring these things and
[28:14] remember lastly to the saints of God
[28:20] because this world is so designed that
[28:23] make you forget this work is so designed
[28:27] to get your mind in such a place amnesia
[28:31] and that's when you forget who you are
[28:35] how many people are backslidden how many
[28:38] people are forsaken and why would the
[28:40] Lord what has he done
[28:42] they were sitting in the Word of God and
[28:46] they love spiritual media to cover the
[28:49] more or less the work
[28:56] nobody helped it unless you know your
[29:02] spiritual and lets you fall don't think
[29:05] you don't know unless you fall keep in
[29:09] the Word of God keep in the things that
[29:12] you know keep in listening to the Word
[29:14] of God the over and over seems to know
[29:21] everything about amnesia amnesia but
[29:27] that we do it has nothing told to you
[29:41] from the beginning the Holy One is great
[29:45] and strengthen money and power it's
[29:47] understanding is unsearchable Isaiah 40
[29:50] 21 it seems like ever since the
[29:54] beginning of time we keep forgetting
[29:57] that did not indeed they have everything
[30:02] they could ever want or vote for in the
[30:05] Garden of Eden and did not tell them to
[30:09] enjoy it all except one thing that tree
[30:16] when that was in the middle of the
[30:18] garden and how that we seemed fine went
[30:21] out until the serpent came along and
[30:24] tempted Eve to forget the whole of God
[30:28] at your school think about think about
[30:35] something so long
[30:41] [Music]
[31:01] stay in the work in a team or puckered
[31:06] darker the word Essenes intense us so
[31:10] much he Burgess us down it causes a
[31:16] heart beating heart situations are
[31:19] situations you ever experienced wave
[31:21] after wave after wave of things you're
[31:27] like Joe Blow this guy Oh
[31:31] Treasure Island less you can see when
[31:37] season you start growing into the Lord
[31:39] then you start fighting you start
[31:42] growing in this grace
[31:43] I think they can't get you can't make
[31:45] you hold this way on that way goes to
[31:48] your kids be dozen babies not you
[31:52] because that's what is designed as
