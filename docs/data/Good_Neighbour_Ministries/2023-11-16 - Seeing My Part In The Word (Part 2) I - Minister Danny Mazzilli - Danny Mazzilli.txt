opportunity for us to um study the word of God and to find exactly what the Lord has for us could I get some more monitor here on this side amen praise the Lord Jesus glory to God so tonight we're going to continue in the series that we've been um looking at and looking at the word of God and seeing our part in the word we've been looking at um uh you know seeing ourselves in the word and then once we see ourselves in the word then we've got to hone in on exactly what it is that God has called us to do and to recognize our part in the word of God Amen because um that's the difference between between really being called as a Christian and to the ministry of Jesus Christ is that if God is calling you he's calling you for a purpose he has a a purpose and a plan I need more monitor on this right here so I can hear this monitor here better please um praise God and so tonight we will start um by reading the word before we do that we'll go to the Lord in prayer and ask him to to come and anoint his word father we're so grateful this evening Lord that you have allowed us to come into your presence once again Lord as uh your minister tonight a vessel that uh Lord I can only offer and yield to you Lord it still takes your anointing to come and to ride the word of God and let your spirit move on the word to speak to the hearts of your children tonight Lord with expectation in their hearts I know you will answer and you will speak and you will provide what each and every one has need of here tonight Lord we just appreciate this uh Avenue that you've provided for us through the preaching of your word you um have a provided way Lord in this day in this hour and you've made it available through yielded vessels so won't you take control now and give us your thoughts your mind and your will for this day in each and every one of our Lives as we commit this word and all things into your hands now in Jesus name Lord we pray that you'll remember our pastor brother Desmond brother Kofi Lord in Africa sister Desiree Lord overshadow them with your spirit your presence continue to use them Lord in the capacity that you have uh anointed them Lord to be a blessing there and to touch the hearts and the lives there of your children in Africa we pray Lord we commit them into your hands we ask that you would bring them safely in Jesus name amen praise God God bless you Saints so our scripture tonight from 1 Corinthians 12 27-31 it says now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular and God hath set some in the church first apostles OST Les secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that Miracles then Gifts of healing helps governments diversities of tongues and all are all Apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of Miracles have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret but it earnestly the best gifts and yet show I unto you a more excellent way the Lord add His blessings to the word you may be seated amen praise God and so in looking at this scripture we see here that um that the Lord is telling us that we're all members and I want you to take note in particular in particular means that that uh each and every one of of you have something peculiar and something that you have been gifted with in order to edify and to build and to make up the fullness of the body of Christ amen praise God go to the next slide just in a review here from part one we were looking at these five-fold Ministry gifts and that they are for one the perfecting equipping giving you what you have need of okay for the ministry for the work of the ministry so that number two you can be an edification and you can be edified and you can receive what you have need of in order to bring your your your your gift into operation for the holy spirit so that so that we can grow in the unity of the faith in other words the body has to come into Perfect Harmony and perfect unity and you know it says all so that we can all come into the unity and so you know a lot of people will will have already come into certain levels of maturity nobody will have reached perfect maturity until all have come together in the unity because I want you to notice what it says here it says the unity of the faith in in other words the revelation of the body of Christ Christ of your position and of what the body is performing and fulfilling in this day because there's something that you are going to fulfill the portion of the word that you are going to fulfill when we look back from Genesis all the way to Revelation there's always been groups of individuals that are fulfilling the portion of the word in their particular day and then once that is fulfilled then things move move on to the next stage of the coming of the lord it's all based on and and you know if if you get a chance go back like I said go back and read Christ The Mystery of God revealed or listen to it or both I'll tell you there's a difference in listening and a difference in reading and then a nice blessing in doing both all right and you'll and you'll just know by your own experience I can't tell you but I just know that that you know the word just opens up in in so many ways when we read it and when we hear it all right and so um there's there's a portion that you need to fulfill and there's a portion and it's all bringing everything back to the purpose of God which is you know that God was going to manifest himself through Christ that he would have the preeminence in the church and this is what he's doing right now he is trying to have the preeminence Min in the church and by having the preeminence in the church he's bringing every single individual the faith that they need in order to come under subjection to the word of God so that they can get into their position for what so that we can increase in the knowledge of Jesus Christ in the revelation of his word to know what his purpose and his Plan of Redemption is all about so that we come into the full maturity of the Bride of Jesus Christ and that full maturity is the fullness of Christ it is Jesus Christ in his fullness in Bride form in this day and in this hour praise God and so the next slide says here brother brandham speaking he says putting on the whole armor of God now God fortified his army what with himself remember this is all all about Christ having the preeminence in your life so that you can be what he wants you to be and he says himself in the form of prophets Apostles teachers pastors what did he do what was God doing listen did you ever think what that offices of the church is it's God's dress remember the bride is making herself ready there's a paradox in that statement she's making herself ready how can she make herself ready when the scripture says that he's the one that's making you ready is because you're coming into a perfect realization by Perfect faith that you are the word for your day and that you have a part that you're going to manifest and by you manifesting your part by Revelation you're actually dressing yourself we're dressing one another in the body this is what we're looking at here so if it's God's dress inside dress an apostle a prophet a Seer for see before Satan ever gets to it done told it what it is see God's got prophets within the ministry Discerning the Lord's body Discerning the the the the things that are going to come to pass there's still prophets in this hour not major prophet like brother brandham but there's still the the gift of Prophecy and the and the prophetic Ministry of Jesus Christ because remember this whole Ministry is being operated by The Same Spirit it's always Jesus Christ amen God dressed up in his church these offices is God's dress wear when you see those offices pastors teachers evangelists what is that that's God's dresswear God's presence God's spirit and working through man praise God forever more and so here I want to read the Amplified version of the scripture that we read our our uh scripture for this evening and um when we look at it from verse 27 I want you to listen closely here now you collectively are Christ's body and individually you are members of it each part severally and distinct each with his own place and function that's important now listen so God has appointed some in the church for his own use first apostles special Messengers second prophets inspired preachers and expounders of the word of God third teachers then wonderful workers Wonder workers it's described as here than those with ability to heal the sick helpers administrators speakers in different unknown tongues are all prophets special Messengers question mark are all prophets are all Apostle special Messengers question mark are all prophets inspired interpreters of the will and purpose of God are all teachers do all have the power of Performing miracles do all possess extraordinary powers of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret these are all questions Paul is you know you got to understand here Paul was speaking to the to the Church of the Corinthians and and the Corinthians Church they had all kinds of things going on and they were in need of some serious correction and that's the thing today you know there's so many churches out there and they're all confused about God's gifts you got those in the churches there that are that are saying oh we need to appoint prophets we need to appoint Apostles we need to appoint evangelists we need to appoint healers you can't appoint those gifts those are gifts we read it in Ephesians God gives God gave God Anointed God has inspired and given these gifts so it's not something that we appoint by man or that we we can do ourselves this is something that he does so he says do all possess extraordinary powers of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret but he says but earnestly desire and zealously cultivate you know when you're when you're cultivating something you're planting seed well God is cultivating in you and me God is cultivating God is bringing out in you and in each and every one of us the gifts that he's placed in our lives because these are things that he still operates and it's he's The Giver of the gift and he's the operator of the gift in other words the plant is growing organically it grows and feeds off of the the natural nutrients that are around it so that it can grow while the church is organic also in that the holy spirit is the life of the church and his life is what operates and moves through each and every gift specifically and in particular because you all have distinctive abilities and each and we're going to look at each and every one of you has a gift cultivate the greatest and the best gifts and Graces it describes it here the higher gifts and the choice voest Graces what's Grace Grace unmerited favor you didn't do anything you don't do anything to to to deserve God's gifts you don't do anything to be a gift in the Church of God you didn't deserve it you didn't uh oh I you know I I was brought up to be you know a a a prophet I was brought up to be an evang evangelist because I love to travel I love to travel so I must be an evangelist you know a lot of people love to travel and because they love to travel and they belong to a church they want to be the Evangelist in the church because the church will kind of support that Ministry but it's only if God has called the individual it's not him calling himself to the ministry it's not saying I'm going to be the Evangelist you know because I have the ability I have the financial capacity to travel so it just kind of means that I should be the one doing it that's not the way it works this is a supernatural church that's the difference between the church organizations that are that are that are being developed and that that that's why there's thousands and thousands of different uh you know denominations of churches out there and there's some that are filthy rich that are that that have more money and can do so many great things but guess what they're not operating by faith they're not operating under the true uh anointing of the spirit of God because it is the spirit of God that operates and controls and uses and perfects all the gifts within the body amen praise God and then Paul says you know you know you know uh desire to have all these gifts but then he goes on and he says and yet I will show you a still more excellent way one that is better by far and the highest of them all love praise God what he is saying here is that even though you can desire to have all these gifts and it's good it's good to desire and to and to be used of God because that's what it is you want to be used of God but what do you want to be used of God to do what part is it that that that God wants me to be and and to and to so that I can edify and nourish and and build up the body of Jesus Christ it's not something that you want to make yourself it's a desire to serve God and what Paul is saying here he's say he's saying I want to show you something that's more excellent and that if you can just fall in love with him if you can just fall in love with the word if you can love one another and and appreciate one another in true agape love not felio love not oh you know I love you because you love me I'm going to do this for you because you do this for me that's not the kind of love that you will find in the body of Christ although we do appreciate one another we should naturally appreciate when we do things for one another because a lot of people they're too spiritually minded and they're no earthly beneficial in in the way that they that they oh well you know um that's just you know you have to do that for me because you're a Christian and if you're a Christian you should be nice you should be good you know a lot of people want to put on Christianity they want to they want to put a false front oh I do good you know you talk to people and they say oh you know like uh uh you talk about the Lord and you talk about salvation and the first thing that you know that they want to say to you is that oh I I I do good things you know I give you know I I've never killed anybody you know you you hear this coming out I never killed anybody you know no you never killed anybody physically but you use this tongue over there and the Bible says that you say something against somebody it's just as much as killing them you see God is looking at all the aspects and God is looking at the real love of God the real purpose and the motive within your heart for doing what it is that you do in the body of Christ and we want to grow in such a way that we can come to really truly appreciate one another and that means to humanly appreciate and say thank you I appreciate it when somebody says thank you if I do something for them if I go out of my way to do something uh you know and and I'm doing it it's not that I'm expecting it but when they say it it just edifies me and I know that it does the same for you because you're human you like to be you know acknowledged you like to be appreciated you that's part of you know being part human and a son of God because that's the Paradox remember we talked about it last week it's a paradox to be a Son of God and also to be a human being because you still got to deal with the with the with the Realms of this flesh and everything that we've got to deal with in dealing with one another and one another's characters and and shaping and rubbing and you know as iron sharpeneth you know these things like this is all part of the body coming into that perfect Unity of the love of God because we need to we need to shave off some of the things that you know that that are that are raw that are that are not the kind of things that are going to strengthen and edify the body of Christ so we need to be spiritually and physically balanced in our thinking so that we can operate as a church in human bodies and as sons of God in the Supernatural elements of the gifts that God has placed within our lives amen praise God and so let's let's go to the next slide so tonight what we're looking at is the diversities of gifts but understanding that it's the same spirit it's always the Holy Spirit that's operating and moving and and uh uh doing what it is that he does in each and every one of our Lives let's go to the next slide let's read First Corinthians um because what we're doing is we're actually looking at the the the book of Corinthians chapter 12 because it's in there that we receive a lot of instruction uh Paul you know speaking to the church so let's read the scripture he says here now concerning spiritual gifts Brethren I would not have you ignorant so he's he's he's he's rebuking the people as what he's doing you got to understand that opening statement it's like a rebuke to the people because the Corinthian Church they needed to be corrected they needed to be you know um uh brought back into a a level you know spirit and a level mind and a level way of dealing with the supernatural anointing that's that that's come down upon them because Paul knew that the spirit of God was moving there was no question that the spirit of God was moving and that people were actually displaying gifts and you know when you read through it you'll you'll see how Paul's you know you know correcting them and rebuking them about tongues and this and that but let's just look at it he says I don't want you to be ignorant you know that ye were Gentiles he this is all rebuking and we can look at this and we can see how it relates to us you you all were Gentiles carried away unto these dumb Idols you know like he's just speaking plain here he says you had a bunch of dumb Idols you you had them hanging in your cars and you got you know all these statues that you pray to and you know you've got all these Pagan you know uh teachings and upbringings that that you that you used to operate with because they were the Greeks and they had all kinds of different you know idols and they like to kiss idols and you know kiss statues and this and that he says he says you were Gentiles and you were carried away with these Idols even as you were LED wherefore I give to you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God calleth Jesus a cursed in other words he was telling them that you think you got the Holy Ghost just like a lot of the churches that are out there they call themselves Christian churches and yet they want to tell you that Jesus Christ is one in three Gods he's in a trinity and you if you've got the spirit of the Holy Ghost there is no way the spirit of the Holy Ghost is going to tell you to go and pray and say 10 hell mares it's just nowhere in the scripture because if you've got the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is directing and guiding and leading that church it cannot curse the word of God and to say anything and to tell people to go and do things that are contrary to the word of God have no Foundation of who Jesus Christ actually is they're actually cursing the word and they don't know it they're speaking Blasphemous things against the word of God and they don't know know it why because of their teachings because of their traditions because of their Pagan understanding on the word of God they were brought up to to to to worship idols and to worship people instead of worshiping Christ people will take a man's word over the word of God and that is exactly contrary that that speaking by the spirit of God calleth Jesus Cur and that no man can say that Jesus Christ is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost so he was rebuking them and saying guess what a lot of you don't even got the Holy Ghost because you don't even know who the Lord Jesus Christ actually is if you had the spirit of God and you had the Holy Ghost you would know that the spirit of God is God that Jesus Christ is God that the father is God that the there's only hear ye oh Israel the Lord thy God is one not two or three if you're going to be baptized you need to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins we don't baptize babies how does a baby believe how does a baby repent because it says repent and be baptized he that Jesus said he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved so how do you take a baby put him into the water or how you how do you just take anybody that comes to the altar while you're preaching the trinity in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit they don't even have a revelation of who Jesus Christ is if you're gonna if you're the bride if you're the if you're the church and you're the bride when a bride goes to the altar the bride takes her husband's name she doesn't take his title like if I'm if I like I am the CEO of a company but if somebody you know if I'm GNA marry my wife and she comes to the altar uh you know uh do you Jennifer take the CEO of this company to be your husband that's a title you're going to take the name I am a human being I'm a son I got a father and a mother but those are not my name those are my titles those are those are uh uh what I represent I represent a father I represent a son I represent a husband but my name is Danny and Jesus the Bible says there is no other name that man must be saved by but by the name of Jesus Christ you see this is all simple abcs on the word of God but how are you going to the reason why Paul is rebuking them is how are you going to actually be effective in the body of Christ as a True Believer without the holy spirit because it's the holy spirit that operates the gifts so we see here now there are and then he goes and he says but the H but by the Holy Ghost you cannot no man calleth Jesus a cursed and no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost and then he says now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit all in one paragraph he rebukes them tells them that you don't even know that you got the Holy Ghost and what even the Holy Ghost is and then he goes and he and he ends it by saying and by the way all those gifts that are manifesting amongst you there their diversity there's all kinds of gifts but they operate by one Spirit but in this church you guys are being controlled by Devils a lot of you are operating under under different Spirits because it's not the spirit of God that can go against the word of God and say I am the Lord and yet reject the baptism in jesus' name reject the godhead reject all all the the the the foundational teachings of the word of God and claim that they're operating the gifts just doesn't work that way so in in um let's go to the next slide so so what we're looking at here is we're looking at a study of the of the book of First Corinthians chapter 12 and then go to the next slide and and one thing that um you know in passing here Paul in his opening statement he said um that he does not want Christians to be ignorant and when you look into the scriptures there's three times where it talks about don't be ignorant and and just this is just in passing this was something that I thought I would bring and it says don't be ignorant of God's plan for Israel if you read Romans 11: 25 be not ignorant regarding Israel Israel is God's time piece Israel has been in the scriptures right from the book of Genesis and right to the very end the Book of Revelations when he calls the 144,000 everything that that that happened throughout the 6,000 years that we've been on this Earth has been surrounding the nation of Israel God used it as a focal point in order to bring his mind and revelation on his Plan of Redemption remember everything is based on God's interpretation God is his own interpreter why God chose Israel that's God's choice that's God's word God has the preeminence in the body of Christ that's his plan that's the way he did it from the beginning that's the way he's going to do it right into the end who are we to rebel and to tell god well why did you choose Israel to to give the land to and why didn't you choose the Germans or why didn't you choose the Italians or why didn't you no God has a plan God has a purpose and we need to not be ignorant of that so in other words don't let the things that are happening in the world bypass you but look through the scriptures and see how it fulfills and lines up with the word of God the next part he says be not ignorant about spiritual gifts okay because and this is what we're going to be looking at and then he says thirdly don't be ignorant about the second coming of Jesus Christ and the Eternal state in from first Thessalonians that we need to recognize and not be ignorant that Christ has already come he's here now a lot of people unfortunately many Christians are ignorant on these three examp exact points they don't want to acknowledge Israel they don't want to acknowledge that God has a part in Israel and is using them as a type and as a Time piece on what he's going to do because he used years and times and Seasons around the nation of Israel watch when the Fig Tree puts forth its figs watch when Israel goes back into its Homeland all these things all these things happened supernaturally after 2,000 over 2500 years Israel finds itself back in its Homeland that wasn't just a coincidence that was God's plan it was prophesied thousands of years ago that it was going to happen and God did it supernaturally a lot of people think all you know World War II is what forced Israel into their Homeland no no God's plan allowed World War to to bring Israel back into their Homeland okay God's plan plan overrides everything remember God is his own interpreter he will make it plain amen praise God but a lot of people are ignorant of these things and and especially these three areas is you know is what surrounds the whole church because everybody's waiting on the coming of the Lord everybody's waiting on the second coming of the Lord wait till the second coming of the Lord meanwhile he's already come and he's here and he's in a body and he's trying to have the preeminence in his church because every time that he would come to the church through the Dark Ages and then through the Reformation he would get kicked out of the church because man would start to introduce their own ideas their own doctrines you know their own ways of interpreting the word of God they they made him a trinity they the the Jova witness they make him Mighty God almighty God they you know there's all kinds of interpretations and whenever you put anything to interpret the word of God beyond what the word says you are committing spiritual idolatry against the word of God it's as simple as that it's as simple as when a woman takes another man while her husband still lives she's she's actually taking and going into idolatry scripturally it's all types and shadows and when somebody takes a man's interpretation on the word of God instead of God's word they are going against the word of God and that is a form of idolatry they're taking another man's seed another man see Jesus is the word and his word is what he is given to us and his word is his seed and that's why you know we can read in the scriptures on that day many shall come to him and say Lord Lord have I not done this in in your name have I not cast out devils and he's going to look at them and say I never knew you when you go back to Genesis and you read about where Adam knew his wife that was when a man comes together with a woman and places his seat seed in that woman that is he's impregnating her with his seed to bring forth another life well Christ pregnat us with his word which is his seed and it brings forth Jesus Christ it brings forth another son or daughter of God because it comes from God but when you impregnate it with a doctrine of another man and you take take on the teaching of another man you're going to bring forth the teachings and the seed of that other Doctrine and that's why it'll bring the birth of denominational churches other churches the Bible talks about it in the Book of Revelation as harlots harlots the mother church and its harlots in other words they're churches that have been birthed by man's teachings man's interpretations which are contrary to the word of God you see the Simplicity of that you see how it is that they've gone off the word by taking another Doctrine or teaching or they wna they want to they want to have saints here on the earth and they want to worship man and they want to worship Bishops they want to worship popes you got to worship the word of God let the word be your absolute there is no other absolute but the word of God Amen praise God H Allelujah and so he wanted them to not be ignorant of these things and uh so that that just you know in in uh in passing there but um if when we're looking at um at the at the at the word okay we're looking at 1 Corinthians chapter 12 we want to look at the understanding um and that we must have a revelation so the first thing is that we must have a revelation of Christ the word in our day okay and that's you know we we've covered that that part here in in what um in the comments that I've made amen but now I want to look at the diversities of gifts and understand that it's all the same Spirit there are differences of Ministries but the same Lord amen and there are diversities and activities but it's all the same God who works all in all amen praise God hallelujah and so when we're looking at these diversities of gifts Paul he goes on and he's going to go on and you know when we get into this chapter here we're going to see that there's nine different spiritual gifts that are mentioned here but there are still many other gifts outside of those nine spiritual gifts because we need to understand that the body of Christ when it's when it's the supernatural body there are so many parts in the body of CH we don't just have nine you know nine elements to our body there's there's thousands of elements to our body there's a lot of elements that we see and a lot of elements that we don't see and we need to realize that they all have an important part and if you can recognize that then then you'll you'll realize that you know you won't be left in a in a condition where you don't know if you're a part of the body of Christ there's going to be certain natural things that are within your life where you will know that you are naturally gifted and you will you will organically move into those positions amen praise God so diversity of gifts but the Same Spirit the gifts are diverse the Ministries are different and the activities are also different so you know you might have a gift of of um of cleaning and that gift of cleaning you know as a deacon might be to clean Spirits out of the church you see the gifts operate organically they operate by the spirit of God and so it's it's not just the way that we want to interpret the gifts we do have these m your gifts of Prophet evangelist those things will predominantly show themselves pastors teachers they will they will be clear those are things that that that actually supernaturally feed control and govern the body of Jesus Christ but then there are things that are within the body that just naturally and organically operate and move and do things that edify and nourish and strengthen the body of Christ now when we look at at different activities when we look at activity the the word activity is comes from the word ener jamata enata okay in the Greek now when we look at that word it means it's where we derive the words energy energetic energize from so it is the the word of active miraculous power so when somebody is you know oh man you you you got a lot of energy you know God is going to place individuals within the body of Christ that are going to be energized they're going to be people that that start things people that are that are good at at getting things started because you know like in in every body there's you know there's individuals that just like to sit back and they like to be led because they're just more the kind of people that need instruction they need to be led and that's okay and when you're in that kind of a position where you're okay to be led and you allow the spirit of God to use the governments within the church to lead you then you can you can be a great benefit to the body of Christ but when you're a lazy person and then somebody comes and asks you to do something and you Rebel and you don't want to do it then how is it that you're fitting into the body of Christ you see um this interprets itself this this action within the body of Christ and all the gifts and all the the aspects of the body they're not something that we have to constantly um you know push and shove if we can all all come into the unity of the faith in this area and we can all come into the understanding that the body has parts that that that work and operate in certain ways and understand it in love and we and we we project love into every situation then everything works so much better and so much more Supernatural amen it does require for us to be polite in the way that we you don't go to somebody and say Hey you lazy bum why aren't you at church cleaning on Saturdays that's not the way you do it there's a way of communicating and there's a way of of of appreciating and building up and edifying and encouraging the body of Christ this is about encouraging you might have you you might have the spirit of discernment on your life there are things listen as a deacon God placed me as a deacon within the ministry God supernaturally allows me to see things I I'm just I don't I can't explain to you how I discern the things that I discern you can't you can't you know Philip could not explain to you how it how it works how the gifts operate and how it is that the Holy Spirit but it's just things that supernaturally are revealed and it's part of the gift it's part of the calling it's part of the position in the body of Christ and when you know as a deacon and as you know part of the leadership and part of the governance of the body it's my position to direct and to guide and to correct the spirits that are within the church and sometimes the Lord will show that's why we ask you to go to your Deacon we want to allow the body to off operate organically the way it's supposed to operate and when we allow it to operate in that way everybody gets edified there's no schisms there's no oh well he talked to me that way and you know he came in and he spoke to me that way and he shouldn't be using that tone with me and this and that no listen sometimes the you got to remember everybody's got their National upbringings and you know some people have you know ways of communicating the way they the way they speak things uh you know that that seem to be you know maybe not the way you like to receive it but understand that if you stay humble and you don't Rebel and you just allow the spirit of God to deal with it God will correct even the highest office in the church that's why it's not your position to go and correct a higher position that's not the way it works it doesn't work that way under the authority of the Holy Spirit it says be subject one to another it talks about being respectful unto the Elders of the church and understanding the authorities and the positions that God has placed each and everyone in and when we recognize that then we approach it in a different way and we allow the supernatural to take control in the whole situation and so if the person was not right in the way that they dealt with the situation don't worry God will correct it God will deal with it through the offices that are within the body of Christ in the right way and when it's done that way everybody profits Hallelujah so here we're looking at the word enera okay it's the energy it's the supernatural power of the holy ghost that comes in to those different gifts that are within the ministry to bring them into their proper position to give them the energy and the and the faith and the and the uh understanding and the knowledge on how to operate in that position amen it's a so we've got a supernatural energy that that God moves through the church it's all the Holy Ghost but it's in the diversities it's in the ways it's the don't put your own interpretation on how the holy spirit is going to move and deal with whatever it is that he needs to deal with within the church this is Bible study tonight right amen praise God these are things that we need to understand these are these are things that you know like I'm being blessed by these by these reminders in the scripture and by allowing the Holy Spirit to to give us the interpretation by his spirit amen praise God and so there's these gifts there there's these Ministries there's these different diversities amen and we need to understand how the manifestation of the spirit operates and moves it has a way of Performing and operating in these offices within the church amen and and God will will call individuals and and give to them the supernatural ability to operate those gifts when he wants to do it it's when he wants to do it praise God hallelujah amen so there's there's you know different varieties and and uh we need to understand that God has made up the body with different varieties of individuals we're not all clones we're not all the same there's people here from from different cultures Africa Trinidad Jamaica you know uh England we've got Italian we've got we've got all kinds of different backgrounds and each each nationality has its own National Spirit you know some cultures are very hospitable they're always thinking about the other person you know if you ever come you know well now you know my parents are in a in a home now they're in a community but even when I go there my mother the first thing she says to me you want something to eat that's the first thing she always says come on let's go and get something to eat I said Ma I just ate we're going to eat in a couple hours let's sit down and let's talk for a little while okay all right 10 minutes later did you want something to eat it's it's the culture okay some places you'll go there and you want something to eat and they'll never mention a word about eating but we we need to understand that this is what we're dealing with within the body of Christ that we're not all going to be because everybody is called to the church and comes into the church not everybody's going to operate in the same way there's going to be diversities of how those particular gifts so two people can have the same gift of of of tongues for example okay okay but yet one has the gift of speaking in tongues and interpreting the tongues and one has only the gift of interpreting the tongues but it's all around the gift of tongues you see but we need to understand that those are the way these gifts operate and how God has designed and and made up each and every one of us in such a peculiar way that's why the scripture said in particular members of the body and he added in particular Allelujah so when we look at these different manifestations there's there's you know where um there's there's the gift for example the gift of uh prophecy okay that's a gift that God gives in order to bring Clarity future events bring Clarity on the direction of the church how it's how it's going to fit into the uh the the the the the prophecy that's now taking place it you know that that Spirit of Prophecy can come upon the pastor can come upon the minister that's that that's ministering can come upon the Evangelist it's God's spirit at any time he can prophesy and and bring H you know his interpretation and and Direction on Guiding and leading the church in a supernatural way it's it's understanding that these gifts are not just isolated to one individual it's organic it's God in his body it's God in his church anytime he wants to move we don't put any restraints on the Holy Ghost if the holy spirit all of a sudden wanted to speak and and and you know use this brother gersam here all of a sudden he gets anointed to stand up and to speak in tongues and interpret the word of God if it lines up with the word of God and then it's tested through the ministry by a by by the witness of three or two or three within the church then that gift has to be recognized and has to be um uh acknowledged as being the spirit of God because what he says comes to pass it's not what he says it's what the SP spirit is saying and so we need to keep things in their proper order and that's why when somebody speaks in tongues you could have a gift of speaking in tongues but if there's no interpretation Paul says you better keep silent because you're going to confuse the people because the people are looking to hear what the interpretation is and and for for some reason they're not getting any interpretation and so it's more where you got to know if you've got the gift then you've got to allow the Holy Spirit to truly operate the gift not just to speak in tongues I speak in tongues when I pray sometimes but it doesn't mean that there's an interpretation there no that's that's because there's such a commun communication going on in prayer at that moment that the that the language becomes unknown and it's and it's something that God is drawing and pulling out of you as an individual in a in a in a supernatural way in communicating and there's a there's there's a Euphoria and there's a revelation that will usually manifest after it happens and you will know as an individual you will not be left in confusion amen praise God and so we need to understand that these gifts that God has placed within the church they're not just for you because you have the gift it's to profit all that are within the church the gift needs to profit and is for the purpose of profiting all and God has given you a specific ability to operate in that gift God has designed you and made you in such a way that nobody else can take your place as the attribute of God that's why your diversity the way that God uses you will be unique in that he uses you in that particular way let's look at the next slide here so we're looking at diversities of gifts and now we want to look at um nobody can take your place and let's go to the next slide here there's a quote here from Brother brandham when God has called a person for a job to do there is no one can take its place nobody can take your place remember you are a member of the body in particular okay you are unique you are gifted you are here for a purpose and the Holy Spirit by the preaching of the word is going to place you positionally into that gift that's what that's what this whole series is all about I've got so much I've got so many notes and so many areas that the holy spirit's been leading me into but I'm realizing that that it's got to be done in a proper order and I just got to allow the spirit of God to to you know lay in these foundations I know these are things we've read but but through it God is is speaking and dealing with individuals not just people that are here but there's people that are online that are listening in that may may not understand what it is to truly be in the body of Jesus Christ and to be used of God and to be placed there with a gift for the use of the Holy Spirit he says here there is no one can take its place there is no one can take your place your peculiarity there it is okay how often I have wondered how I would like to take oral Robert's Place how I would like to take Billy Graham's place somebody like that like Billy Graham go speak to an audience of people call Sinners to the altar forget it and go home and have and not have to stand there and wrestle again I cannot be Billy Graham but neither can Billy Graham be me see nobody no nobody could be brother brandham brother brandham was the 20th century Prophet you know at his when he was here on Earth there was two other Messengers and here it is again these are all the types and shadows that are within the scriptures we're not going to we're not going to get into all of that but just briefly brother Bram he was he was the messenger of Malachi 4:5 the the one that the that would come under the spirit of Elijah to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers but Billy Graham and all Roberts they were to the the the nominal churches one was out to the Pentecostals the other one was all to the Protestant churches worldwide and that's why Billy Graham had such a worldwide Ministry that's why Oral Roberts had a huge Ministry in the Pentecostal Realms they had special Ministries and each had their calling brother bram's calling was for the for the the original church back to the original word and that's why those other denominations that that came out of Oral Roberts teachings and Billy Graham's they you go and you go into studying all of their their teachings and everything else and it's all full of oness Tess itarian they've got all kinds of different teachings on the word of God they've made man you know special evangelists and they they've you know put titles on man and everything else when the Holy Ghost he's the only one that vindicates his word and confirms his word and that's why brother brandham here was talking about you know that he could not take their places just like they could not take his place he was the one called to fulfill Malachi 4 5 Revelations 10:7 he says but neither can Billy Graham be me we are both I cannot be Oral Roberts or Roberts cannot be me you're each one set in God's economy just for its place one fasts all the time and communes with God while another one casts out Devils because this one is fasting but it's the whole body of Christ working together the unity you see it's all about the unity of the body not Unity of becoming clannish and you know you know just hanging around with certain people and you know uh being clannish brother brah says don't do that don't be clannish don't be you know separating yourselves and making yourselves you know well I I got more Revelation than them so I'm going to hang around with the people that got more Revelation and I'm not going to hang around with the people that you know that are that are you know oh they they just you know they they don't have as much re no that's that's arrogance that's not in the body of Christ there's Fellowship in the word of God and when we truly come to a place every single one of us every now and then we need to come down from our high horse sometimes God gives us so much Revelation that we're that we're moving in the Realms of faith that we get to where we we feel we don't need anybody else we don't need to fellowship with anybody else I don't need anybody to teach me about the word of God I got got the spirit of God inside of me and I and everything I need God is just going to give it to me supernaturally yes that's the way God works supernaturally but the moment that you make yourself an island you're going to be surrounded by sharks and you're going to find yourself in a situation where you're going to feel alone you're going to feel like you you don't have the God can lift the anointing at any time that he wants to on your life did you know that at any moment God can fill you and and and and re-baptize you with his spirit in his presence and and put upon you the spirit of wisdom and all of a sudden you can speak to situations and wisdom comes into you that's another gift that you know one of the spiritual gifts but wisdom is not looking at somebody and saying oh that person has a lot of wisdom I'm going to be the person that they come to for wisdom because I've been in business for so long i' I've got so much experience so they need to come to me that's not the way God God operates in the body God will use the the the experiences and the and and the ability of the individual if the individual is humble but if there's a spirit of Pride I know this and I know more guess what God ain't going to use you you might be the only one that that that thinks that you're you're you're you've got all this understanding and all this knowledge and all this wisdom but God's not going to use you God's not going to allow that Spirit of arrogance or that Spirit of Pride to be mixed with his wisdom that's why when the spirit of God is operating in a gift there's humility there's there's there's a humbleness there's a understanding and a respect for one another regardless of the position we are all Sons and Daughters of God and nobody is higher than the other when it comes to being a son or a daughter of God God I need to respect every single one of you regardless of who you are regardless of where you are at we need to respect and love and appreciate everyone for where we are that's the only way that the Supernatural is going to move in each and every one of these offices and these gifts it's when we get ourselves and we project ourselves into the gift then God can't use it God will just not allow it to have an effect and he will turn he'll actually turn the people away from you you'll wonder why they don't want to fellowship with you you'll wonder why they don't want to be around you it's because there's a spirit there that's that that's that's projecting something like I'm better than you we're not better than anybody nobody is better than anybody else in the body of Christ we are all joints that need to supply by one another and we need to recognize that in order to really truly Be an Effective church that can be effective even in the community and be effective to anybody because we're no better than anybody else it's just the grace of God that you can see what you're seeing it's God's grace that he's given you his Spirit to recognize what the word is actually saying to somebody else they read the word and it just like it just goes right over their head and no matter what you do you can't give give it to them because God gives Revelation not man man doesn't give Revelation and so you need to wait on the spirit of God to give each their portion of faith in their time and in their season amen praise God and so uh you know when you are you know given this gift and this ability remember it's not something that you gave to yourself or you earned but it's something that God gave you and at the same time the gift in you sometimes you got to remember we've got an enemy we're going to wind it right down now we've got an enemy that is constantly going to try and stop you from operating in that gift okay and so you're G to have to deal with that and you're going to have to deal with the reproach that comes with being in the body Body of Christ being a true called Christian in this day and in this hour you're going to have to bear the reproach of being a real Christian people are not going to like it that you're different that you're gifted in order to have the you know the gift of faith you know that faith is a gift God gives you the ability to receive Revelation by his spirit and that's a gift and when you're talking to somebody that can't receive Revelation and cannot see the word the way that you're seeing it they're going to reject you and you got to realize that's all part of being a part of the body of Jesus Christ next slide here brother bradam speaking here he says the reproach for the cause of the word 1962 he says you always have to stand this report reproach in order to give your testing to see every man that comes to Christ must first be child trained for the purpose that God has ordained you for and remember if you can just keep quiet remember if he has called you for this there is nothing that can keep it from happening if God has called you to the body of Christ God has called you to your position let the musicians come God has called you to this place there's nothing that can stop you there's not enough devils in torment what God's will will be made manifest you're born for a purpose and nobody can take your place you might have impersonators and everything else but they'll never take your place right God's word will Triumph the attribute that God has placed in you will triumph over whatever circumstance and whatever it is that you have to deal with in order to get to the place where God can can can perfect you for the use within the body of Christ he says God's word will Triumph it cannot fail there is where every Christian ought to stand knowing that and trials will come up and seem every way to you but remember God has a purpose and it'll all will work right amen I'm going to end it right there we've got more but we'll look at that Sunday amen by God's grace let's pray our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're grateful tonight Lord in um this study in the book of Corinthians and we're just thankful Lord that you bring out these simple aspects of your word and how your spirit is operating and moving through each and every one of our Lives Lord won't you just continue to
