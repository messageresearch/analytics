[29:48] 29. Father bless your word in Jesus
[29:51] name.
[29:58] Colossians chapter 1 verse 12-
[30:02] 29. This is Paul. Today we're going to

[30:16] made
[30:18] us meet to be partakers of the
[30:22] inheritance of the saints in
[30:25] light. Who had delivered
[30:28] us from the power of darkness and had
[30:32] translated
[30:33] us into the kingdom of his dear son.
[30:38] In whom we have redemption through his
[30:42] blood,
[30:44] even the forgiveness of sins, who is the
[30:48] image of the invisible
[30:51] God, the firstborn of every
[30:55] creature. For by him were all things
[30:59] created that are in heaven and that are
[31:03] in earth, visible and invisible.
[31:08] Whether they be thrones or dominions or
[31:14] principalities or powers, all things
[31:17] were created by
[31:19] him for him.
[31:22] Hallelujah. And he is before all
[31:25] things and by him all things
[31:30] consist. And he is the head of the body,
[31:33] the
[31:34] church, who is the beginning, the
[31:37] firstborn from the
[31:39] dead, that in all things he might have
[31:43] the
[31:44] preeeminence. For it is priest the
[31:47] father that in him should all fullness
[31:50] dwell
[31:52] dwell. and having made peace through the
[31:56] blood of his cross. by him to reconcile
[32:00] all things unto

[32:11] you that were sometimes
[32:15] alienated
[32:16] and enemies in your mind by wicked
[32:21] works. Yet now had he
[32:26] reconciled in the body of his
[32:29] flesh. Through death he present you holy

[34:22] present every man perfect in Christ
[34:26] Jesus where unto I also
[34:29] labor striving according to his works
[34:33] which workketh in me mighty
[34:37] May the Lord add his blessing for the
[34:40] reading of his word. You may be seated.
[34:44] Hallelujah. Today my message we going to
[34:48] talk a little bit about
[34:50] Paul. Paul one of the greatest
[34:55] apostle.
[34:56] Paul I think everybody knows about Paul.
[35:00] Paul is mostly all
[35:02] the wrote all the most of
[35:06] the the New
[35:12] Testament. Paul a servant of the Lord
[35:15] Jesus Christ as we all know that wasn't
[35:18] a as we all know Paul Paul wasn't a
[35:23] Christian. How many know Paul wasn't a
[35:26] Christian? I think everybody knows
[35:29] because he was a
[35:31] killer. Why Paul was a killer? Because
[35:34] he was he wasn't a
[35:36] Christian. But let me tell you about
[35:38] Paul.
[35:41] Paul was a man that was
[35:45] zerous for
[35:48] God. And he was a
[35:52] Jew. I read about Paul a little bit
[35:55] here.
[35:58] Rabbi Griia, also known as Griia
[36:02] Eder, was a prominent Jewish
[36:06] rabbi and a and
[36:09] teacher in the first century.
[36:12] He was leading figure in the
[36:18] Sanhedrin, the supreme Jewish
[36:21] court and is mentioned in the New
[36:25] Testament as a mentor to the apostle
[36:31] Paul. So Apostle was mentor and be
[36:35] teaching. He was teaching by a Jewish
[36:38] rabbi called
[36:40] Griia. Hallelujah.
[36:45] He is re he is reveal revealed for his
[36:52] wisdom, legal
[36:55] expertise and role in preserving Jewish
[36:59] tradition.
[37:01] So all the teaching that Paul
[37:03] got was pres the teacher that were he
[37:07] taught
[37:08] him what he taught him about tradition
[37:11] about
[37:15] law. He was expert in
[37:18] law and the same
[37:22] time about traditions of the
[37:26] Jewish.
[37:28] how the Jewish because he was a rabbi.
[37:31] So he know about Moses, the law of the
[37:33] word of God because he know how Moses
[37:37] God called Moses and Moses led them to
[37:39] the Jewish to the Israel uh to
[37:44] Canaan. So Paul Paul was taught by this
[37:48] man knowing he was serving God.
[37:53] So and and to serve God, you cannot mix
[37:57] tradition and the law of the human being
[38:01] together. You can't mix
[38:05] that. But they didn't
[38:08] know. To Paul didn't know. He was a
[38:10] young man, very young man. But he was he
[38:14] loved God. He was taught by his parents
[38:17] maybe as a Jew how they thought about
[38:20] the history how God delivered them
[38:23] through
[38:24] Abraham through uh Abraham to Egypt and
[38:29] then God called Moses and how Moses
[38:33] miraculously by the power of God took
[38:37] them through the wilderness to the
[38:39] Israelite.
[38:43] So at the same time this man was a
[38:46] teacher of the oral law law. He was a
[38:49] master of the Jewish oral law which was
[38:53] passed down through his generation of
[38:56] rabbis. So he was not converted by
[39:00] God. He was a law. He had law together
[39:06] with the tradition. So when this thing
[39:08] to get get together is a killer because
[39:12] if you don't obey the tradition they
[39:15] will use their own law to persecute you.
[39:18] So Paul learned much about
[39:21] that. And Paul
[39:24] had he knew he was serving
[39:28] God. He has a seed of God inside of
[39:32] him. Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[39:37] So when through all this
[39:40] learning tonight my message the topic of
[39:45] my message
[39:46] is God still moving through his
[39:52] prophecies. God is still moving his
[39:57] through through his prophecies.
[40:00] When God start working, he never
[40:04] stop. And
[40:06] anytime God is he raise a prophet, they
[40:11] prophesy for the future. The future the
[40:15] prophecies is like the light that is
[40:18] guiding them. So they have to follow
[40:22] that
[40:24] God God prophecies by his prophet
[40:28] anointed prophet something like Isaiah
[40:32] and all the prophets Samuel and all
[40:34] those
[40:36] prophets and God God started
[40:39] working he never
[40:42] stop he never stops he is always
[40:47] moving because it's a promise promised
[40:49] that one day he would take his children
[40:54] out from this earth because you remember
[40:57] we were all
[40:59] lost. So when he came he he has a mind
[41:04] to redeem his children back to him.
[41:08] Right? So all what he need that time he
[41:13] has to get somebody that he can trust it
[41:17] and put his spirit inside of him. So he
[41:20] started with who? Abraham.
[41:23] Hallelujah. Thank you Lord.
[41:31] Amen. Amen. Thank you Jesus.
[41:37] So when Paul was taught
[41:40] that the Jewish they
[41:45] always look what God has done for
[41:49] them because they miss the word of God
[41:53] with the tradition. They forget to look
[41:58] through the
[41:59] prophecies whom God has spoke through
[42:02] his prophets.
[42:05] So if they could have
[42:07] watched learn the prophecies in the
[42:11] Bible, they will not miss the Lord Jesus
[42:14] Christ. But thank God the Bible
[42:17] said God
[42:19] intentionally allow them to miss so that
[42:22] me and you can be drafted in.
[42:26] Hallelujah. The wisdom of God is
[42:29] marvelous and is tremendous. And let me
[42:32] tell you,
[42:35] Christianity is the sweetest
[42:39] religion in this world here because he
[42:43] has proofs.
[42:46] Hallelujah. Not just only proofs, he has
[42:50] reality
[42:52] and is still moving on the same way that
[42:55] it started. It never lose a beat.
[42:58] Hallelujah.
[43:00] So as we are sitting here today, let me
[43:03] tell you, you are blessed to be
[43:07] Christians. Not just to Christians, to
[43:10] this message that we are in right now.
[43:14] You see the same
[43:15] thing that happened to the Jews. They
[43:19] could not recognize the prophecies that
[43:22] is in the Bible.
[43:25] But thank God, God has opened our
[43:29] understanding for us to recognize our
[43:32] day, that we are living in the prophecy
[43:37] that was in the Bible. Hallelujah. How
[43:40] did the Jews forget? They couldn't
[43:45] recognize the the the prophecies.
[43:51] Paul because he learned through
[43:55] tradition and
[43:57] law of
[43:59] mankind. He didn't know to check the
[44:04] Bible. He was
[44:06] blinded the prophecies that what God
[44:09] said in the prophecy. Let's read
[44:11] something
[44:13] here. Let's check Isaiah 9:6.
[44:22] Just today we going to talk a little
[44:26] bit. Isaiah
[44:30] 96. For unto us a child is born
[44:35] unto unto us is a son is given and the
[44:40] government shall be upon his shoulder
[44:43] and his name shall be called wonderful
[44:46] counselor. the mighty God, the
[44:49] everlasting father and prince of
[44:52] peace. You forget about that that thing
[44:55] there. He said a child will be
[44:58] born and all the power and the
[45:03] government nobody shall be upon him.
[45:10] So if Paul could have recognized
[45:14] this, he would not miss the Lord Jesus
[45:17] Christ in his
[45:18] days. So when this thing
[45:21] happened, at the same time there was
[45:24] another one. Let's see Isaiah
[45:27] Isaiah Isaiah uh I think uh
[45:31] 40 40
[45:34] um
[45:36] three. This is a this is a this here was
[45:40] a
[45:41] prophecy that it has to happen in the
[45:45] days of
[45:46] Paul but because he could he
[45:49] learn in the word
[45:52] wisdom but he didn't go deep in the word
[45:56] of God though his heart he know he was
[45:58] studying God because Torah was
[46:01] everything to them remember that they
[46:03] believe in Moses so everything that turn
[46:07] away that Torah there is a persecution
[46:10] they will kill you they know they were
[46:13] worshiping God
[46:14] but was a wrong way they miss that with
[46:18] the word that's why you cannot miss the
[46:21] word of God with a worthy
[46:23] wisdom there's two separate things why
[46:26] the
[46:27] denominations are now off from the word
[46:30] of God said if you are shooting a target
[46:33] like this and you miss just a a a a a a
[46:36] little by the time you get to the door
[46:39] is one in o off the word of
[46:42] God. So you cannot do
[46:46] that. He said listen to this prophecy
[46:50] too. The voice Isaiah Isaiah 40 and3 the
[46:56] voice of him that cried in the
[46:58] wilderness prepared the way of the Lord
[47:01] making
[47:03] straight in the desert and highway for
[47:07] our
[47:08] God. He said for our God. Even this year
[47:14] shows that Jesus is God.
[47:19] He said for he preparing a way to meet
[47:23] straight straight way for our God who
[47:30] uh uh the prophet
[47:34] uh uh John John the
[47:37] Baptist who who prepare wasn't he the
[47:42] one that prepared a way for the Lord
[47:44] Jesus Christ. Yes. So he
[47:49] said, he said, "Make straight in the
[47:52] desert and a highway for our God." He's
[47:56] preparing to meet who? He preparing the
[47:59] way for our God. Who was God? The Lord
[48:02] Jesus Christ himself.
[48:05] Hallelujah. People does not understand
[48:08] this little little things here. When you
[48:10] see this, that means God has blessed
[48:13] you. He has opened your understanding
[48:16] because you want to know and God gave it
[48:19] to you.
[48:21] Hallelujah. The word of God is too good.
[48:26] Hallelujah.
[48:29] So when they didn't Paul was not looking
[48:32] for this prophecies in the Bible there
[48:35] so he miss it.
[48:40] The Jews forgot that God was moving
[48:44] forward through his prophecies. Instead
[48:47] they
[48:49] takes they stuck by their own tradition
[48:53] and
[48:55] rituals. This is what happened today.
[48:59] The church the the normal church in this
[49:03] world
[49:03] here they stuck in their rituals and
[49:07] traditions of the word of God they are
[49:10] not looking for what we going to see
[49:12] this we are walking through the
[49:15] prophecies right now because that
[49:18] prophecy God has prophesied those things
[49:21] till the day that we meet him to over
[49:25] there because that's our
[49:27] guidelines God give us a
[49:29] guideline, you know, because we never
[49:32] been there before. So he set these
[49:35] places there. When you get there, he
[49:37] said, you know that you on the right
[49:40] path.
[49:42] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
[49:46] This is exactly what happened today
[49:49] about our modern denominational
[49:51] churches. Pentecost, Baptist, uh bread,
[49:55] all kind of all kind of and so they miss
[50:00] mass because they are not looking for
[50:02] the prophecies that God has promises.
[50:06] Hallelujah. But God is still moving
[50:09] through his prophecies. Hallelujah.
[50:16] Hallelujah. We are moving by the word of
[50:19] God. By the word of prophecy. Let us let
[50:23] me tell you if you are not
[50:26] expecting the move of God, you will
[50:31] leave
[50:33] behind. How can you move with the word
[50:37] of God? You have to look through his
[50:41] prophecies because that's our
[50:45] guideline. You cannot move without the
[50:48] prophecies that is in the Bible. We are
[50:51] going
[50:52] home through these prophecies. Even our
[50:56] days after brother Abraham, this is the
[50:59] bright day. We still moving through the
[51:01] prophecies.
[51:05] and and and and and let me tell you this
[51:07] one here is very very
[51:14] interesting. So this has nothing to do
[51:17] with the message believer or
[51:19] preacher. These Jews were rabbis. They
[51:22] knew the word of God but they miss it.
[51:27] It doesn't matter how much you
[51:30] know, how much you
[51:33] study, how much you you your
[51:40] holiness. God has not locked
[51:45] that. I going to read something for you
[51:47] about
[51:50] Simeon. But Abraham speaking here. Let's
[51:53] take this one here. birth pain. The
[51:57] birth
[52:01] pain birth pain
[52:07] uh paragraph
[52:10] 145. We're going to read here. Everybody
[52:13] pay attention. This is very serious.
[52:20] Sorry, I need something here and I
[52:23] forget
[52:24] to I need I forget
[52:27] to put my phone in
[52:32] there.
[52:35] Okay. Okay.
[52:43] I uh this birth pain
[52:46] paragraph be birth
[52:49] pain paragraph uh let me check the the
[52:52] the the
[52:55] year birth be
[52:58] um okay pins I didn't see the year
[53:03] there and Simeon had
[53:06] prophesied listen here
[53:09] Simeon was a blind
[53:11] man but he was
[53:15] expecting so he
[53:17] check if you are not expecting you
[53:20] cannot
[53:21] get a woman has a child he's always
[53:26] expecting for the child to be
[53:29] born every woman every woman that has a
[53:33] desire to have a child he's always
[53:36] expecting to be a mother right if you
[53:40] are not expecting you cannot
[53:42] get. You have to expect to get
[53:45] something. If you expect to be rich, you
[53:47] have to be expecting to work and save
[53:50] your money and work towards
[53:52] that.
[53:54] Hallelujah. I I think nobody expecting
[53:57] to be poor. If you expecting to be poor,
[53:59] you'll be poor. Hallelujah. Is that
[54:02] right? Amen.
[54:05] Simeon he said he will not leave this
[54:10] earth here until he see the Messiah. So
[54:14] he was expecting Paul was not
[54:17] expecting because he has no idea how
[54:21] these prophecies in the
[54:23] Bible cuz he did
[54:25] not because when somebody is teaching
[54:28] you you always become like your teacher.
[54:33] What a sister taught you is what what
[54:36] what what you that what you're
[54:38] following. They told him anything that
[54:41] come against this Torah is deadly. You
[54:45] have to kill
[54:46] it because God is
[54:49] one. And the Jewish believe only one God
[54:52] and is really God is one but he has too
[54:56] many office and he has his prophecies
[54:59] that he work through. So if you miss
[55:02] that prophecies, you cannot get there.
[55:05] Let's read here paragraph 145. And
[55:08] Simeon has prophesied and said an old
[55:12] man he said the Holy Ghost told me that
[55:16] I will not see death until I see the
[55:20] Lord
[55:22] Christ right now. Who is leading
[55:25] you? Who is leading you? You just tell
[55:28] me who is leading you right now.
[55:31] The Holy Ghost, the same Holy Ghost that
[55:34] led Simeon is the same Holy Ghost
[55:36] leading you right now. It does not
[55:39] change. That's the spirit of God. If you
[55:42] don't know who is leading you, you will
[55:45] never see.
[55:47] Hallelujah. I I believe every Christian
[55:51] that has that desire to know the Holy
[55:54] Ghost, seeking for the Holy Ghost, he
[55:57] has a right to get it.
[55:59] If you don't have a Holy Ghost, you will
[56:01] never understand
[56:04] nothing. He is the one who is going to
[56:06] reveal everything to you. Me, I stand
[56:10] here, I cannot give you nothing. Until
[56:13] God gave me something, give me something
[56:16] to tell you.
[56:18] Hallelujah. And I believe the God that I
[56:21] serve is real God, he will never give me
[56:24] anything contrary about his word.
[56:28] Hallelujah. Do you believe that every
[56:30] minister that stand here is led by the
[56:33] Holy Spirit? How many believe
[56:36] that? I want to see your hand. How many
[56:38] believe that? Yes. If you don't believe
[56:41] that, you will not get nothing from
[56:44] here.
[56:45] Hallelujah. This is real. And the same
[56:48] Holy Ghost is the one that will take you
[56:50] to your
[56:51] destination. He is the light that is
[56:54] leading you.
[56:56] He is the one who's going to give you
[57:00] encouragement. Hallelujah. So, Holy
[57:03] Ghost is very very very important in
[57:06] your life. And your mommy, your pastor,
[57:10] your deacon, nobody can give it to you.
[57:13] Is God
[57:15] himself will give it to you. Even your
[57:18] husband, your wife, your children, they
[57:22] cannot give it to you. is individual
[57:25] affair. So you if you want to go to
[57:27] heaven, you got to strive to have a Holy
[57:31] Ghost. You got to know that you know
[57:34] yourself in your heart that you have the
[57:36] Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. This is very
[57:39] serious. This is not a joke. Without the
[57:43] Holy Ghost, you cannot get nowhere and
[57:46] you will never understand the word of
[57:47] God because Holy Ghost is God's spirit
[57:51] and he is the one who going to reveal
[57:54] himself to
[57:56] you.
[57:59] Hallelujah. Simeon said you will never
[58:02] die until you see God. Hallelujah.
[58:12] Brother Abraham, why some of the
[58:14] priests, you know, said, "Poor old
[58:18] fellow, he's just a little off." You
[58:21] know why? He got one foot in the grave
[58:29] now. And the other one sleeping. Why
[58:34] just let him alone? He's been an
[58:38] honorable old man by by his kind
[58:43] of the maybe he's kind of um this one
[58:47] you know that yeah the mind of
[58:50] mind but you see what did his have what
[58:55] did he have it was revealed to him by
[58:58] the Holy Ghost God
[59:01] himself never mind how much people
[59:03] criticize you with your lord scared
[59:07] head. The young man, you don't have a
[59:10] bushy hair. You don't have a
[59:14] ruster. A woman put a raster. The man
[59:17] put a rust and they go like this. They
[59:19] go like this. Like the dog has a a a a
[59:23] what do you call it? A a a saw in the
[59:25] ear that the the fries are bothering.
[59:28] You go like this. Do you
[59:31] understand? Never
[59:33] mind. Thank you, Lord.
[59:36] Hallelujah. Never mind how much they
[59:38] criticize you. Hallelujah. You're
[59:41] awkward. But that's where God want.
[59:44] You're handsome. You're beautiful in the
[59:47] eyes of God. Hallelujah.
[59:50] It doesn't matter how much you go to,
[59:51] how much they criticize you. This woman,
[59:54] they criticize him. They laughed him to
[59:56] the corn. He is cuckoo. He is cuckoo.
[59:59] The same thing they going to tell you,
[1:00:00] you are cuckoo. You follow this message,
[1:00:02] you become a
[1:00:05] oldfashioned.
[1:00:06] Hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. The word is
[1:00:10] going insane. But you are walking in the
[1:00:12] step of the gospel. You are you are on
[1:00:14] the way to heaven. Hallelujah. Never
[1:00:17] mind how much they criticize you, they
[1:00:19] talk about you. God loves you. God honor
[1:00:23] you.
[1:00:24] Hallelujah.
[1:00:26] Amen. They did that to Simeon.
[1:00:32] That's this that's the same thing that
[1:00:37] is revealed to you people in this
[1:00:40] afternoon. The Holy Ghost brought you
[1:00:43] here for some reason. You understand?
[1:00:48] The Holy Ghost brought you here for some
[1:00:51] reason. Your mommy, your daddy, your
[1:00:54] aunt, your grandfather, your grandma,
[1:00:57] they did not understand
[1:01:01] you. God is dealing with you
[1:01:06] personally. Don't let nothing, nobody
[1:01:09] criticize you. The day will come they
[1:01:12] will, they would like to run to you to
[1:01:15] get something from
[1:01:17] you. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. They
[1:01:21] did to Noah. Noah was building the ark.
[1:01:23] What did they do to him? They laughed
[1:01:25] him to scone. You you this baldhead old
[1:01:29] man. Look what you're doing. They
[1:01:31] laughed him. They drinking. They're
[1:01:32] smoking. They do all kind of
[1:01:35] dancing strip joint and all kind of
[1:01:38] stuff. But
[1:01:39] Noah knew God the Holy Ghost revealed to
[1:01:43] Noah that
[1:01:45] the rain is coming. So he has to
[1:01:49] prepare. He was
[1:01:52] expecting.
[1:01:53] Hallelujah. God has revealed to him.
[1:01:57] When God reveals something to you is
[1:02:01] real. Remember he's God who created
[1:02:04] everything on this earth. The God that
[1:02:08] you serving is almighty God. The creator
[1:02:11] of heaven and earth. Every living thing.
[1:02:14] When we read the word of God, you heard
[1:02:16] that every living thing. sea, land,
[1:02:21] everything. And that's the God that you
[1:02:24] serve. That's the God, that's your
[1:02:27] father, that's your mother, that's your
[1:02:29] sister, that's your all in
[1:02:31] all.
[1:02:33] Hallelujah. So don't look left, don't
[1:02:36] look
[1:02:36] right. Just look away to Jesus.
[1:02:42] Hallelujah. Oh, thank you.
[1:02:48] There's some the the holy the Holy
[1:02:50] Spirit look at this priest and
[1:02:55] cy here from Methodist, Baptist,
[1:02:58] Catholic and all. They were moved by the
[1:03:01] Holy
[1:03:03] Ghost. The hour the hour is here. So the
[1:03:07] Holy Ghost move on them and they've been
[1:03:10] looking for it. Hungary then
[1:03:15] Jesse one day you
[1:03:19] know didn't have
[1:03:22] television. Thank the
[1:03:24] Lord for that day. So they they so they
[1:03:29] they
[1:03:31] was they was down up upon the hillside
[1:03:36] of Judea. There was a baby born, a star
[1:03:41] appear and so for off. But after 8 days,
[1:03:47] the mother brought that little baby in
[1:03:50] the wrap in in wrapped a swadden
[1:03:55] clothes. A swadden clothes I am
[1:04:00] tell was they didn't have nothing to put
[1:04:05] on. It was a little little rag of a yolk
[1:04:09] of an ox. I am told that was his
[1:04:13] swadding clothes. Here comes Joseph and
[1:04:16] then coming with this little baby.
[1:04:22] I I I
[1:04:24] imagine the mother stood back from the
[1:04:27] distance with their little babies with
[1:04:31] needle work and everything said look
[1:04:36] look there
[1:04:38] see there she is see she was pregnant by
[1:04:44] that
[1:04:45] man here she comes
[1:04:48] in that Stay away from her. Keep your
[1:04:53] distance. They still think the same
[1:04:57] thing. But Mary with the baby in her
[1:05:01] arms, it didn't make any difference why
[1:05:04] they thought. Didn't make any difference
[1:05:06] what they thought. She knew who son that
[1:05:10] was.
[1:05:13] So and so does every believer
[1:05:17] that accept God's word accept go accept
[1:05:21] God's word into their hearts. I don't
[1:05:25] care what the system say. You know what
[1:05:29] it is. It is a promise of God. It was
[1:05:32] revealed to you by the Holy Ghost when
[1:05:36] you were over overshadow with his power.
[1:05:41] No man brought me here. No man brought
[1:05:45] anybody here. Let me tell you I came to
[1:05:48] this church one day I went
[1:05:50] back. It was if it's myself or somebody
[1:05:55] I will not be here. I cannot give my
[1:05:58] testimony now. God himself brought me
[1:06:01] here. The same Holy Ghost that led
[1:06:04] Simeon brought me here. The same Holy
[1:06:07] Ghost brought you here. Hallelujah.
[1:06:10] Thank you
[1:06:13] Lord. Oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:06:16] Jesus
[1:06:17] Christ. And so to everybody accepted.
[1:06:21] Okay. It was V to it was V to you by the
[1:06:26] Holy Ghost when you were overshadowed
[1:06:29] with his power. You know where it where
[1:06:32] it where it is at. No man has a right to
[1:06:36] preach the gospel until he's met God
[1:06:39] back on the back side of the desert in
[1:06:42] that burning bush to where there was no
[1:06:47] existential
[1:06:49] system and in the word and explain it
[1:06:52] away from you. Nobody can explain it
[1:06:55] away from you. You were there. It
[1:06:58] happened to you. I don't care what the
[1:07:01] system say. You are witness of it.
[1:07:04] Hallelujah. I feel like the old colored
[1:07:08] man I was talking about. I I ain't got
[1:07:12] room up here now. See, I felt very
[1:07:15] religious at this time when I think and
[1:07:19] that's right. God himself revealed to
[1:07:24] you the same thing he revealed to
[1:07:27] Simeon. The same thing revealed to you.
[1:07:30] Hallelujah.
[1:07:32] Simeon has a promise setting over in his
[1:07:36] study that morning. Oh, I guess there
[1:07:40] might been several hundred babies
[1:07:42] brought in every
[1:07:45] morning. Every morning about two two and
[1:07:49] a half million Jews in the country.
[1:07:52] These babies coming and more and many
[1:07:56] born every eight days. mother to come
[1:08:00] off offer offering for purification and
[1:08:04] how and now here come Simeon sitting
[1:08:08] there you know maybe reading the scroll
[1:08:12] of Isaiah I don't know but all at once
[1:08:16] why he was reading the scroll he was
[1:08:20] reading the
[1:08:22] prophecy a child will be born hallelujah
[1:08:27] so he was expecting. Are you expecting
[1:08:30] rapture? Praise God.
[1:08:33] Hallelujah. Now, if the Holy Ghost has
[1:08:36] made you a promise, the Holy Ghost has
[1:08:39] got to keep the promise. Has got to keep
[1:08:43] the promise. If it is really God, he if
[1:08:51] he if a man comes through and say a
[1:08:54] certain thing, God doesn't back it up.
[1:08:57] It isn't a scripture to begin with,
[1:09:00] forget it. And if he says it's so, it is
[1:09:04] so and God still doesn't back it up is
[1:09:08] still wrong.
[1:09:11] Everything that you say, you hear has to
[1:09:15] back up with the
[1:09:17] scripture. God has to confirm
[1:09:20] it. Hallelujah. Course God interpret his
[1:09:24] message. He his own
[1:09:26] interpreter. What he says comes to pass.
[1:09:29] Then God said hear him him for it is the
[1:09:34] truth. He said hear him for it is the
[1:09:37] truth. That's only common sense. If he
[1:09:40] say it is happens and it happens that
[1:09:44] tells it it must be very it must be
[1:09:47] every time exactly the truth because God
[1:09:50] does not tell
[1:09:52] lies. Hallelujah. And so then here is
[1:09:56] Simeon sitting there taking the
[1:10:00] persecution. You're going to take
[1:10:01] persecution till the day that we go over
[1:10:05] there. The persecution cannot stop us
[1:10:09] because we know that we know. We have no
[1:10:12] words to explain. When God tells you
[1:10:16] some do something, my brother, my
[1:10:19] sister, you cannot
[1:10:21] explain. When God speak to your heart to
[1:10:24] do something, no words can explain, but
[1:10:28] you find yourself doing and it will
[1:10:30] happen exactly what how God said it. I
[1:10:34] went through. So I know nobody don't
[1:10:37] have to tell me and I cannot
[1:10:39] explain so many times I cannot explain
[1:10:43] but it's happened exactly what is
[1:10:45] happening. Hallelujah. So everybody that
[1:10:49] a child of God have to have Holy Ghost.
[1:10:54] That's your endless hope that you have.
[1:10:57] That's the one that is leading you.
[1:11:00] Hallelujah. So don't pray with it.
[1:11:04] Anything that the preacher or the pastor
[1:11:08] said you don't understand it, go back to
[1:11:10] the word of God and check it
[1:11:13] out. Don't take my word. Check it out if
[1:11:16] it's true because you are the one that
[1:11:20] dying, not me dying. I cannot if you if
[1:11:23] you if you don't check it up and you go
[1:11:25] to heaven, the God going to ask you, did
[1:11:28] you have my
[1:11:31] word? Yes. said, but why didn't you
[1:11:37] check? Why didn't you
[1:11:39] check? It's your
[1:11:41] responsible, your responsibility to
[1:11:44] check the word of God. Don't let the
[1:11:47] Bible lay down there and that's it.
[1:11:51] Please. Hallelujah.
[1:11:59] So, and here was sitting there listening
[1:12:03] because he was part of the remnant, the
[1:12:06] word the the word was coming the word
[1:12:09] was revealed to him and all at once when
[1:12:13] the baby come into the temple when it
[1:12:16] was duty of the Holy Ghost to reveal
[1:12:20] that it was there. So he moved by the
[1:12:24] spirit of God. He didn't move by
[1:12:27] himself. He moved by the spirit of God.
[1:12:31] When spirit of God move you, can you
[1:12:34] recognize it? So that you don't fail
[1:12:37] what God want to use you to
[1:12:39] do. That's why you have to be familiar
[1:12:42] with the Holy Ghost. God want to use
[1:12:45] every one of us. You cannot He cannot
[1:12:48] use you if you don't know him. You can't
[1:12:51] you you you are not having familiar with
[1:12:53] his
[1:12:54] spirit. God can tell you go pray, go lay
[1:12:57] your hand upon somebody and if you if
[1:13:01] you don't have the spirit of God, you
[1:13:03] will miss it. You miss the word of God.
[1:13:06] You miss your paycheck.
[1:13:08] Hallelujah. It's very very
[1:13:12] important. Thank you,
[1:13:15] Jesus. Amen.
[1:13:24] um come right down along with the the h
[1:13:27] the line woman until he got down there
[1:13:30] where the little baby was. They they was
[1:13:34] all staying away from pick up the babies
[1:13:38] in the arms and the Lord let the the
[1:13:40] servant depart in peace for the eyes
[1:13:44] have seen I I okay I forgot I left
[1:13:48] something
[1:13:50] here the word revealed to him all at
[1:13:53] once the baby was in the temple when the
[1:13:56] duty of Holy Ghost revealed to him he so
[1:14:01] he moved by the spirit came out to the
[1:14:03] little steady room right down through
[1:14:05] the hall. Hit the line. Woman come come
[1:14:10] right down along the line of the until
[1:14:13] he got down where the little baby was.
[1:14:16] And they were saying they were staying
[1:14:19] away. They was all staying away from
[1:14:23] pick up the baby in his arms. Lord, let
[1:14:27] your servant depart in peace, for my eye
[1:14:30] have seen your salvation. And at at that
[1:14:33] time, another one of the little elect
[1:14:36] was elect in that day was Anna. Anna was
[1:14:42] another woman. He was moving moved by
[1:14:45] the same Holy Ghost. Hallelujah.
[1:14:49] So that's that's what so
[1:14:52] Simeon and
[1:14:54] Anna was
[1:14:57] expecting. So they
[1:15:01] recognize that day the prophecy that was
[1:15:04] supposed to fulfill that day.
[1:15:08] So this this message I I I have a long
[1:15:12] message. I cannot finish today because
[1:15:15] it goes on straight down to what I want
[1:15:18] to finish it up.
[1:15:21] So,
[1:15:24] hallelujah. Anna was expecting a Okay.
[1:15:30] Today people can sit in their
[1:15:34] churches their
[1:15:37] church day and night without seeing the
[1:15:41] move of the Holy Ghost in their
[1:15:44] church. Sometime people become
[1:15:48] stagnated. Stagnated is like a stag snag
[1:15:51] stagnate stagnated water is a water that
[1:15:55] doesn't move. So all everything is
[1:15:58] inside there. It cannot move. So it's it
[1:16:00] can't go. It's dead water. So when you
[1:16:03] are sitting the church, please don't
[1:16:05] don't just sit down. Get
[1:16:09] something. Grow. Grow in the Christ. We
[1:16:15] have to grow. I came to church. I didn't
[1:16:18] know
[1:16:18] nothing until gradually precept of
[1:16:23] precept. God had every day. And now God
[1:16:28] has called me to tell you what I learned
[1:16:33] from him. I didn't stand here by
[1:16:37] myself. I have no
[1:16:39] education. All what I know is Christ.
[1:16:44] Hallelujah. So everybody has a gift and
[1:16:48] God going God is going to use that gift.
[1:16:51] But unless you make yourself available
[1:16:54] so that he can use you.
[1:16:58] Hallelujah. Remember Paul was a young
[1:17:01] man. Salvation was in his
[1:17:04] gen.
[1:17:06] Okay. He acted what he trained for. He
[1:17:11] acted what he trained for. Paul killed.
[1:17:13] Not that he wanted to kill, but that's
[1:17:15] what he trained for. He was trained by
[1:17:18] the
[1:17:19] law. But one
[1:17:22] day, God met him in Damascus. That's
[1:17:26] where God has to change. He before he
[1:17:30] was
[1:17:31] Saul. So that name that Saul, God has to
[1:17:35] change the name to
[1:17:37] Paul
[1:17:38] because after before after he met God,
[1:17:43] he became a changed
[1:17:45] person. He became a changed person. Each
[1:17:48] and everyone I was not like this. Hey,
[1:17:52] let me tell you. You used to have a
[1:17:53] curry hair, bushy hair like this,
[1:17:57] handsome, no ugly like this time.
[1:18:00] Yeah.
[1:18:02] Handsome, bushy. Every woman see me,
[1:18:04] they want to marry me.
[1:18:08] Hallelujah. Thank
[1:18:10] you. But a time came when God got behold
[1:18:14] of me. All those things
[1:18:17] gone. Woman, this this everything gone.
[1:18:21] I'm a changed person. I became a new
[1:18:24] creation. Things I used to do, I do them
[1:18:28] no more. The places I used to go, I go
[1:18:31] there no more. The things I used to do,
[1:18:34] I do them no more. It's been a great
[1:18:37] change since I was born. Great change
[1:18:42] since I was born. Great change since I
[1:18:46] was born. great change since I was born.
[1:18:51] Been a great change since I was born. I
[1:18:55] was born in Christ. I'm a new creation.
[1:19:00] The same thing as the same thing Paul,
[1:19:02] God did to Paul. You cannot stay the old
[1:19:05] way. When God calls you, he give you a
[1:19:09] new test.
[1:19:11] The test of heavenly test. When you see
[1:19:15] somebody you want to talk to him about
[1:19:17] Christ, when I came to the message
[1:19:20] first, when I go to when I go to work, I
[1:19:22] cannot eat my lunch. I gather people and
[1:19:25] speak. By the time I ran the bell ring,
[1:19:28] I I put my I bring my food home. I
[1:19:31] couldn't stop talking. I had lesson.
[1:19:34] Then when I had lesson, then I came to
[1:19:36] work. I was crying. And they asked me,
[1:19:39] "Why are you crying? Are you are you
[1:19:41] hurt?" I said no. God has saved my life.
[1:19:46] If no, God saved my life. When I was in
[1:19:49] the world, if I was in the world that
[1:19:51] time, I was seeking for insurance to get
[1:19:54] money. But that time, something had got
[1:19:57] hold of me. God has saved me. So I was
[1:20:01] rejoicing.
[1:20:03] Hallelujah. I know God.
[1:20:06] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:20:10] So that's what happened to
[1:20:12] Paul. So when
[1:20:15] Paul God took him to the land and took
[1:20:20] everything that he learned from Galia
[1:20:22] away from him. Then he became God.
[1:20:26] Hallelujah. A masterpiece of God.
[1:20:29] Hallelujah. God. Paul became a
[1:20:31] masterpiece of God. Hallelujah. You see
[1:20:34] that that thing there? Paul, his name is
[1:20:36] there. As soon as that happened, he
[1:20:39] became
[1:20:40] what? A root. Thank you, Jesus. God
[1:20:45] planted him on the ground and they say,
[1:20:48] "You're going to flow out." Hallelujah.
[1:20:50] And Paul the the the the root start
[1:20:53] going to
[1:20:54] ground. He me persecution. Oh, glory to
[1:20:59] God. He start dancing. But he know what
[1:21:01] is persecution because he was doing it.
[1:21:04] They have to drive him. He he was
[1:21:07] preaching the
[1:21:08] gospel. So sometime they have to put him
[1:21:12] in a basket and roll him outside the
[1:21:15] door because the people were waiting to
[1:21:17] kill him. He know about that. When they
[1:21:20] were killing Steven, Paul was standing
[1:21:22] there.
[1:21:24] Hallelujah. Oh my. He said, "Now I taste
[1:21:30] I
[1:21:31] taste the sweetness of Steven.
[1:21:36] Hallelujah. When Steven was dying, he
[1:21:40] said, "Father, forgive them. They they
[1:21:43] know not what they
[1:21:45] doing." He said, "I saw the Lord Jesus.
[1:21:48] You are sitting on the
[1:21:49] heaven. Oh God, receive my soul."
[1:21:53] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. The
[1:21:56] sweetness
[1:21:57] of Steven, Paul tested it. And then when
[1:22:02] Paul came out, where is Rabbi Jones?
[1:22:05] Where is the devil that make me kill
[1:22:07] these people now? I'm going to come
[1:22:10] after you. Are you going after devil
[1:22:12] right now? We going after
[1:22:15] him. I rather preach and die than going
[1:22:18] the world
[1:22:20] there because I know there's nothing out
[1:22:23] there for me. I have Christ. I have
[1:22:26] everything. the creator of heaven and
[1:22:28] earth. The one who who saved my soul,
[1:22:32] who died on the cross for me, who healed
[1:22:35] my
[1:22:35] sicknesses. Oh, hallelujah. Who
[1:22:38] purchased my salvation on the cross? If
[1:22:41] God is in me, who can be against me?
[1:22:45] Hallelujah. You are children of
[1:22:48] God.
[1:22:50] Hallelujah. Aren't you happy?
[1:22:53] Aren't you happy?
[1:22:56] We're going to talk from Paul maybe if
[1:22:59] God
[1:23:00] permit. I have a lot of thing here.
[1:23:03] We're going to talk about on Sunday if
[1:23:05] the Lord
[1:23:06] permit.
[1:23:09] Hallelujah. We're going to talk how God
[1:23:12] has promised you through the prophecies
[1:23:15] and is working on you. Do you believe
[1:23:19] that he's working on you? Hallelujah.
[1:23:22] He's working on me.
[1:23:25] You see I am happy. I don't care. I
[1:23:28] think even the day that they would not
[1:23:31] if rapture terries and I'm not coming
[1:23:33] and they and they say I am dying or I
[1:23:37] dead and they knock in the coffin I will
[1:23:40] wake up and laugh at
[1:23:41] them. I am happy to
[1:23:44] go. Hallelujah. Where is Yeah. I will I
[1:23:50] will raise up while they knocking the
[1:23:53] the the coffin and I will
[1:23:57] goodbye. I have salvation. There's no
[1:24:00] death in me. This precious is what you
[1:24:03] are looking for. Put it there. I'll be
[1:24:06] stand there laughing at them. What is
[1:24:07] death to me? I don't
[1:24:10] care what because right now I am sold
[1:24:13] out for the gospel of the Lord Jesus
[1:24:16] Christ. Paul, they persecuted him.
[1:24:21] Saul, Peter, all of them. Do you know
[1:24:25] that they killed all of
[1:24:27] them? They persecuted them. Do you think
[1:24:30] you're going to go free? Why they
[1:24:32] persecute them?
[1:24:35] Jealousy. Jealousy. Because they don't
[1:24:37] have what you have. Satan make them
[1:24:41] jealous. You think when the Noah
[1:24:43] children were going inside the the the
[1:24:46] ark, those
[1:24:48] people when they realized there was
[1:24:50] raining, they tried to run inside, but
[1:24:53] God locked that ark
[1:24:55] there. You know that right now, God is
[1:24:59] about to lock the door. Nobody can come
[1:25:03] in. Exactly the same thing that is
