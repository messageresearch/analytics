[0:00] of the Lord. I'm still chewing on a bit
[0:02] that I have in the office here.
[0:06] Glad to welcome you to the house of the
[0:07] Lord today. Snowing outside,
[0:11] beginning to feel like Christmas and
[0:14] we're glad that we can be in the house
[0:15] of the Lord. So, you're welcome here
[0:18] today. May the Lord richly bless you
[0:21] knowing that after the service at 5 we
[0:24] have our Christmas dinner where we're
[0:27] going to get together and have a
[0:30] wonderful time of fellowship
[0:32] uh together like that. We welcome the
[0:35] Zanchises back from Korea. Uh God bless
[0:38] you both. Glad to see you here in the
[0:41] house of the Lord. Amen. God bless every
[0:44] one of you. I'm going to go to the word.
[0:47] Um, did we ever get that heat worked up?
[0:51] Oh, so we worked up our body heat. Ah, I
[0:56] see. The old fashioned way and praise
[0:58] God when we got together, clapped our
[1:01] hands and worked up the heat of the body
[1:04] and that took charge of the building.
[1:06] That's why we should close that back
[1:07] door.
[1:10] Are you starting to come now?
[1:14] Oh,
[1:16] okay. He praises. That's good. Praise
[1:18] the Lord. All right. So, everything is
[1:20] all right. Everybody's okay. Nobody's
[1:23] toes are freezing or anything like that.
[1:25] When I first came to Canada, of course,
[1:27] the uh guys were joking with me on the
[1:30] construction site. And so, you have to
[1:32] be very careful because, you know, you
[1:34] can break off your earrings.
[1:37] Of course, I didn't know. So, I was
[1:39] really scared.
[1:41] But that's the way it is. But we're glad
[1:44] that we can be in the house of the Lord.
[1:46] Uh we see visitors here. We're glad to
[1:49] welcome you. Glad for every one of you
[1:51] that are here today in God's house, in
[1:54] God's day. Um let's go to the scripture.
[1:59] John chapter 10.
[2:13] We're going to read verses 1 to 5 then
[2:17] 22- 28.
[2:22] Just before we read the word, let us
[2:24] pray.
[2:26] Praise the Lord. Our gracious Father,
[2:30] once again we are privileged and honored
[2:34] to come into your house and to lift up
[2:38] your name and to praise you. We are not
[2:42] here by form or fashion or tradition,
[2:45] but we come in the power of the Holy
[2:48] Spirit with the anointing of the living
[2:51] God upon us. May the may the scripture
[2:55] fulfill itself. May your people receive
[2:59] the word. May they recognize the voice
[3:02] of God in these last days. And we have
[3:05] come to worship him. Lord Jesus, may the
[3:10] scriptures come alive and may we
[3:13] recognize ourselves in the mirror of
[3:16] God's word and respond to your call. We
[3:21] ask your blessing now with the
[3:23] forgiveness of our sins that we may
[3:26] freely receive the word in Jesus' name.
[3:29] Amen. And amen. The Lord richly bless
[3:32] you. Let's read together.
[3:36] Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that
[3:40] enterth not by the door into the
[3:43] sheepfold, but climbth up some other
[3:47] way, the same is a thief and a robber.
[3:51] But he that enterth in by the door is
[3:55] the shepherd of the sheep. To him the
[3:58] porter openeth, and the sheep hear his
[4:02] voice, and he calleth his own
[4:06] sheep by name. That is where I take my
[4:10] thought from. And lead them out.
[4:14] Amen. Praise the Lord. Uh and when he
[4:18] had put forth his own sheep, he went
[4:20] before them, and the sheep follow him,
[4:23] for they know his voice.
[4:27] and a stranger will they not follow but
[4:31] will flee from him for they know not the
[4:34] voice of strangers. Verse 22- 28
[4:41] and it was at Jerusalem the feast of the
[4:45] dedication
[4:47] and uh it was winter and Jesus walked in
[4:53] the temple in Solman's porch. Then came
[4:56] the Jews round about him and said unto
[4:59] him, "How long dust thou make us to
[5:02] doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us
[5:05] plainly." Jesus answered them, I told
[5:09] you, and you believe not. The works that
[5:11] I do in my father's name, they bear
[5:13] witness of me. But you believe not,
[5:16] because you are not of my sheep. As I
[5:18] said unto you, my sheep hear my voice
[5:23] and I know them and they follow me and I
[5:28] give unto them eternal life.
[5:32] Oh, these pages are so thin. Uh, and
[5:37] they shall never perish, neither shall
[5:39] any man knock them out of my hand.
[5:43] Praise the Lord. God bless the reading
[5:45] of the word. Oh, praise God. to see for
[5:48] many faces. Please be seated.
[5:51] Hallelujah.
[5:57] I just like the brothers to pray to play
[6:00] a clip of a video of brother Graham uh
[6:07] under the anointing of the Holy Spirit.
[6:09] And just before I speak, uh somebody
[6:11] control the lights so that we can lack
[6:14] the effect of it.
[6:17] [Music]
[6:25] switched him off.
[6:29] God seeks man.
[6:32] Never did a man seek God in all the
[6:34] world. God seeking man. When man first
[6:38] fell in the garden of Eden and showed
[6:40] the strain of man man he God was unman.
[6:43] Jesus said, "No man can come to me
[6:46] except my father at home."
[6:48] It has to be through the father first
[6:51] and then I would like to explain
[6:53] something to you.
[6:56] Uh seeing a vision, how many people in
[6:58] here ever dream a dream? Let's see your
[7:00] hands. I guess twothirds of you. There
[7:04] is true that many people doesn't dream.
[7:07] That's your subconscious. We're taught
[7:09] here's your first conscience. Here's
[7:10] your subconscious. Now, this
[7:12] subconscious is what I'm trying uh for
[7:15] the Holy Spirit to work on this first
[7:17] conscience. I might ask this man here,
[7:20] any man along here somewhere, do you
[7:21] believe? Oh, yes, sir. You believe in
[7:24] here? Or what about this man down here?
[7:26] He's the one that runs the ship, not the
[7:29] man up in the powerhouse. It's the man
[7:30] in the engine room. Sometimes when you
[7:33] go to sleep, you go into this
[7:35] subconscious and you dream.
[7:38] And you dream of things you did when you
[7:40] were here.
[7:41] Then when you wake up, you remember
[7:44] things that you dreamed. You people had
[7:46] dream dreams many years ago. You dreamed
[7:48] them. You still remember. Well, there
[7:51] was some part of you somewhere. Isn't
[7:54] that right? Or you wouldn't remember
[7:57] something that you dreamed many years
[7:58] ago. Now the man who sleeps down, his
[8:01] subconscious is way back. It never gets
[8:03] to him. But a seer,
[8:06] his subconscious is not back there.
[8:08] Neither is it here. It's right here. He
[8:11] doesn't go to sleep. He's got his eyes
[8:14] open and he just sees. Now that
[8:18] God gave that man a place where he could
[8:21] sleep sound and not dream. God gave man
[8:23] the way to dream. Dreams. I'd say dream
[8:25] be a dream. You couldn't do it.
[8:29] And then God, what's in the church? Son,
[8:32] apostles, prophets, gifts of healing. Is
[8:35] that right? They're all for the perfect
[8:37] protecting of the church.
[8:40] Paul said, "If there come if you all
[8:42] speak with tongues and the unlearned
[8:44] comes in, won't he say you're all mad?"
[8:47] But if one prophesies and reveals the
[8:50] secrets of the heart, won't they fall
[8:52] down and say, "Surely God is with you."
[8:54] Is that right? Is that the gospel?
[8:57] Although Jesus Christ yesterday, isn't
[9:00] he today? You can believe him by
[9:02] speaking with tongue. You can grieve him
[9:04] by the Holy Spirit. and I believe him in
[9:06] the full measure that he is. The same
[9:09] Lord Jesus. He's not dead. He rose from
[9:12] the dead and here tonight
[9:15] here at the platform now
[9:19] and may be blessed in health. I've never
[9:22] been in this country before and as far
[9:24] as I know there's not a living soul that
[9:26] I can see before me that I know. Very
[9:29] few here on the platform. I remember
[9:32] him. I've seen the man there next to
[9:34] him. I won't remember his name, but and
[9:37] I brother Lindsay, just a maybe three or
[9:40] four ministers sitting here that I know
[9:41] in the building, but God knows all of
[9:45] you. Is that true? He knows all of you.
[9:47] Now, this lady standing here, God in
[9:49] heaven knows I've never seen her in my
[9:51] life as I know. Are we strangers? Lady,
[9:54] we are perfect strangers.
[9:57] But
[9:58] God knows her. Now, if Jesus is the same
[10:02] yesterday, today, and forever, let's
[10:04] change a picture. Now, what he was
[10:05] yesterday when he was going to find out
[10:08] something about a woman, he said, "Bring
[10:10] me a drink." She said, "Wow, it's not
[10:14] customary for this to happen. Jews and
[10:17] so forth are the Samaritans." But Jesus
[10:19] speaking to her, a little while, he
[10:20] found just where her trouble was. Is
[10:22] that right? Well, now Jesus has risen
[10:25] from the dead now and living in us
[10:28] tonight. A little plot. The world sees
[10:31] me no more, yet you shall see me. For I
[10:35] I'm the personal pronoun. I will be with
[10:37] you, even in you to the end of the
[10:40] world. That's the gospel truth. You
[10:43] might not have read it that way or
[10:44] thought of it that way, but that's the
[10:45] way it's written in the Bible. That's
[10:48] your feel. You might have bypassed it
[10:50] somewhere, but that's the way it's
[10:52] written in the Bible. I will be with
[10:54] you, even in you to the end of the
[10:56] world. Now
[10:59] I you know I'm waiting for something
[11:01] that is true. It's the angel of the
[11:03] Lord. And that's true. I'm just as
[11:05] helpless as it could be just like any
[11:07] rest of you. And I'm here perhaps with
[11:09] critics sitting there. How many ever
[11:10] seen his picture of knowing you can see
[11:12] where the scientific taken his picture
[11:15] at a great light and comes in. You can
[11:17] watch it. Yes. Many of you saw the
[11:20] thousands of copies been sold and so
[11:23] forth. The Douglas Studios in Houston,
[11:25] Texas has it for George J. lazy day one
[11:29] of the best in the research in America.
[11:31] take this big any way to advance this
[11:34] when he's actually deserve Jesus Christ
[11:37] himself as being the same destiny and
[11:39] toleration
[11:41] of course I wait for him whether he will
[11:44] help me you go to a doctor sick and
[11:46] upset he gives you an aspirin he's not a
[11:48] good doctor he's trying to get rid of it
[11:51] if he's a good doctor he'll diagnose the
[11:53] case so that something's going on of
[11:55] course it's just now happening now that
[11:58] is true let the people see by your left
[11:59] lifted That's right. See, it's that's
[12:02] crazy. That's what I see. Now, I I'm a
[12:06] stranger to you and never seen you in my
[12:08] life. Now, if the Holy Spirit that I
[12:11] have spoke of of Jesus Christ the same
[12:13] yesterday, today, and forever, if I have
[12:16] truly witnessed that to the people and
[12:20] declare it to be the truth, and he is
[12:22] the same, then he will reveal to me
[12:26] something to you that would help you to
[12:30] believe me. If you're you don't watch,
[12:32] you have need. Uh, but he does. Now, if
[12:35] God will permit that, would you accept
[12:38] your healing and or or whatever it is
[12:40] you want, finance or whatever it is
[12:41] you're you're just seeking for to ask
[12:43] him about or domestic troubles, whatever
[12:46] it might be, whatever it is, he'll know
[12:49] and he'll be able to let me know. Is
[12:51] that right? And that would make him the
[12:53] same as he talked to the woman at the
[12:54] well. Now, I'm only talking to you like
[12:56] he did to contact your spirit when I see
[12:59] you moving from
[13:02] you're
[13:03] you're a You've had a I see a great
[13:06] crash of some sort. It's an accident.
[13:08] Yes. And you it was a car wreck and you
[13:12] were thrown in the air like that. Yes.
[13:14] And it's strange you had somewhere in
[13:15] your neck. It's caused a a cancer to
[13:18] come into your neck or
[13:22] and you're some sort of a teach in the
[13:24] scripture and you believe that Jesus
[13:27] Christ makes you well. I do.
[13:31] Father God, in the name of thy son Jesus
[13:35] Christ,
[13:37] on the authority of God's word by a
[13:40] dying woman, I ask this evil thing to
[13:44] leave her. Satan, you are exposed. So
[13:48] come out of the woman as the church of
[13:50] the living God calls for you to leave in
[13:53] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[13:58] Thank you. Now just for just a moment
[14:00] just want to talk to you for you know
[14:02] it's gone now it'll stay there. We see
[14:05] how your throats
[14:07] praise the gone from her. The the
[14:10] gardener has left your children. She
[14:12] makes you wonder how be thankful have
[14:15] rejoice and be
[14:19] now just have faith in the Lord Jesus.
[14:22] Make him be your center of your thought
[14:24] right now. Lord Jesus, as you think on
[14:28] these things,
[14:30] while we were thinking on these things,
[14:32] they were more hard.
[14:35] Remember, Jesus the same yesterday,
[14:38] today,
[14:40] and forever.
[14:42] He is the same today. Now have faith.
[14:46] Watch this way, audience, and believe
[14:48] with all your heart and give me your
[14:49] undivided attention. Be in prayer.
[14:54] Keep faith in God.
[15:06] Now, I believe this is the way you need
[15:08] to listen to me. All right. Come near,
[15:10] sister.
[15:13] Of course, that won't hurt you now.
[15:14] That's that's just his presence that
[15:17] you're conscious of.
[15:19] an audience.
[15:22] I I'm
[15:24] I'm your brother. I This is not
[15:27] psychology. I felt like coming into the
[15:28] audience. It isn't. It's almighty God.
[15:32] See, it's not psychology. No, it is.
[15:35] Now, don't do that. Just think of being
[15:37] the Lord Jesus. See, and want a car.
[15:41] Now, sister, I just want to speak with
[15:43] you just a moment. We're strangers, I
[15:45] suppose. But Jesus Christ knows the both
[15:49] of us. This is our first time meeting on
[15:52] earth,
[15:53] but he knows you and he's fed you all
[15:56] your life. And he knows me. And if I,
[16:00] your brother,
[16:02] and by his grace, by divine gift that
[16:06] had nothing to do with it coming, when I
[16:09] was born a little baby, the first thing
[16:11] I can remember was a vision. down.
[16:17] I want you to look this way just a
[16:19] moment.
[16:21] Of course, you're sick
[16:23] and you're suffering with a a condition.
[16:26] It's a it's a dark spirit around. It's
[16:29] death
[16:30] and it's an a form of cancer.
[16:34] And the cancer is located on the breast.
[16:38] and you are senior examined by someone
[16:42] strong and it's a you got a a ruptured
[16:45] condition and the rupture is in the
[16:47] bowels and you have a stomach trouble
[16:51] also a severe heart trouble it caused
[16:54] you fainting a few days ago you're
[16:57] sitting sideway on the side of bed and
[17:00] nearly passed out looking towards your
[17:02] window
[17:07] are those things the truth that was true
[17:10] all truth or whatever it was where it's
[17:12] gone from you but what do you think that
[17:16] was that knows your life was it Jesus
[17:19] Christ you accept it to be that
[17:22] thank you you're willing you know that
[17:25] something supernatural is here and if
[17:28] you believe it to be the Lord Jesus as I
[17:30] preached it out of the word and you
[17:33] believe it to be the Lord Jesus yes I do
[17:36] I know there's a dark spirit still
[17:37] hanging at you yet? Something very
[17:39] serious.
[17:41] Say, I see you.
[17:44] Your name is uh Eva
[17:50] and your last name is York and you live
[17:53] in this city and your house number is
[17:56] 6136 Street. Is that right? You're going
[18:00] home to be well.
[18:03] Hallelujah.
[18:05] Praise God.
[18:07] Amen.
[18:09] God bless you. Thanks, please.
[18:13] Uh,
[18:15] I wanted you to actually see, you hear
[18:18] me, you hear us speak about the prophet
[18:20] of the 20th century. That's him, brother
[18:23] William Brand. All these evangelists
[18:27] today copied off this man who was the
[18:30] genuine original prophet of the
[18:33] generation. God promised in Malachi 4:5
[18:37] that he would send a prophet in for the
[18:40] Gentiles in this generation. The Jews,
[18:43] all the prophets were Jews, but one
[18:46] would come to the Gentiles. That's him
[18:49] that you just saw. And he's called
[18:52] people up, told them their names, tell
[18:54] them about their past, tell them about
[18:56] when they were a child, you did this,
[18:58] this this this and thousands of time had
[19:02] never once wrong. Amen. And he kept
[19:04] asking, "What did you think that was
[19:07] that that called your name or or spoke
[19:10] to you like that? Uh, do you believe
[19:12] that to be Jesus Christ?" And the woman
[19:15] says, "Yes." He said, "Thank you. Amen.
[19:18] Praise the Lord." Well, I'd like to use
[19:21] that as a background
[19:24] just to say to you, he knows your name.
[19:28] [Music]
[19:29] He knows your name individually and
[19:33] particularly
[19:34] God knows your name. Now we understand
[19:38] by divine gift of the Holy Spirit. He
[19:42] called out the woman, "Your name is Eva.
[19:46] Your last name is York. Your address is
[19:50] whatever 566 whatever street that you're
[19:54] living on." He knew her name. He knew
[19:57] where she was living. He said, "You are
[19:59] sitting on the bed and you passed out
[20:02] and you fell towards the left while you
[20:04] were facing towards your window." being
[20:06] a prophet, he was seeing a vision and he
[20:08] could tell her exactly what was taking
[20:10] place like that. Praise God. I'm not
[20:13] talking about psychics now. I'm talking
[20:15] about a real genuine prophet of God that
[20:19] stays with the word of God. He knew her
[20:22] name. He knew her address. He knew her
[20:27] condition. He knew her circumstances
[20:31] that was there. Praise the Lord. Now
[20:34] that was one of the first book I wanted
[20:36] the second pull. The discernment of
[20:39] spirit when I say pull I mean attraction
[20:42] to the word. The thing that attracts
[20:44] people to the word is the supernatural
[20:46] presence of God. Amen.
[20:49] And under that second P, the great
[20:51] Jehovah was displaying through the
[20:54] prophet that he knows our names by
[20:58] showing you that he knew that woman's
[21:00] name and many other people that he would
[21:03] call us like that and tell them what
[21:06] their name was. For instance, a good
[21:09] friend of mine, a minister, he's he's
[21:12] quite uh up in age now. uh doesn't go
[21:15] around the world as much now. Brother
[21:17] Thomas Brady out of St. An's Bay,
[21:21] Jamaica. I believe he may hear him
[21:23] preaching this morning uh with the
[21:25] little strength he has left. But he told
[21:28] me the story himself how that he went to
[21:32] North Carolina to visit a minister there
[21:35] and they heard that brother Brandon was
[21:38] coming for a meeting nearby.
[21:41] So they decided to to to go to the
[21:44] meeting. That morning before they left
[21:47] for the meeting, the postman came and
[21:51] brought a letter and the letter was
[21:52] addressed to him. So he he took the
[21:55] letter, went in the room by himself and
[21:58] opened it and read it. When he read the
[22:01] letter, it was his wife writing to him
[22:03] to tell him, "Tom, that's what she calls
[22:06] him. I stayed in their house." So, she
[22:08] says, "Tom, my my uh left foot is uh uh
[22:12] paining me and it's all swollen up. I
[22:15] went to the doctors. They don't know
[22:16] what it is. And now I'm just back home
[22:19] and I'm I'm trusting that God would
[22:21] would do something for me and and healed
[22:24] my left foot." And and so he folded the
[22:28] letter, put it back into his the breast
[22:30] pocket of his suit, and then left and
[22:33] went to the meeting.
[22:35] And the meeting started. Brother Brandon
[22:37] was preaching and everything. Then he
[22:39] got down to the park where he started to
[22:41] pray for the sick uh like that and
[22:43] stuff. And then he stopped and he he
[22:45] looked in the crowd and brother Bry said
[22:47] he looked directly at me and I was so
[22:50] scared I dumped in the crowd.
[22:53] And so he continued talking again a
[22:56] little bit more. And then when brother
[22:58] Brady was caught up, you know, he was
[23:01] all caught up with that what was going
[23:02] on.
[23:03] Then he spun around quickly and said,
[23:05] "Sir," somebody pointed to him, "It's
[23:07] too late. He can't." The whole crowd is
[23:09] looking at him, 3,000 people staring at
[23:12] him. So he said, "Sir." He says, "Uh um"
[23:16] He says, "Do you believe me to be God's
[23:19] servant?" He says, "Yes, sir, I do." He
[23:23] says, "Oh." He says, "Uh,
[23:26] you're not from here. Uh, I see water."
[23:30] Oh, go back to Jamaica, Mr. Brady. Your
[23:35] wife's left foot is healed. Thus sayeth
[23:38] the Lord. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[23:43] He knows your name.
[23:46] Oh, well, she said, and she's telling me
[23:48] her part while we sitting in their
[23:50] kitchen. She said, well, she didn't know
[23:52] that was going on. All she knows around
[23:55] the same time, just like when you read
[23:57] in the Bible when Jesus told the man,
[23:59] "Boy, your daughter is healed." And the
[24:01] Bible says in the same hour at the
[24:04] house, the daughter was healed and got
[24:06] up and started to eat and and was well.
[24:09] She said around the same time, she just
[24:12] saw a ball of fire come through the come
[24:15] out of the wall and slowly start passing
[24:18] over the bed. And by the time it got
[24:20] this way to walk the next wall, she was
[24:23] out of that bed and was whole and
[24:26] walking on that leg until the day she
[24:29] died just about two years ago. Praise be
[24:31] to God. Our God is the same God
[24:36] [Applause]
[24:40] and he knows our names. Do you believe
[24:42] he knows your name? Praise God. That's
[24:45] under the second book. He called out
[24:48] your name and he knows what our names
[24:52] are. Praise the Lord. He knows, in other
[24:55] words, what you're going through. Amen.
[24:58] He knows the problems that you have
[25:00] right now.
[25:02] Right now, he knows your problems and he
[25:05] knows what you're going through. So,
[25:07] don't let the devil tell you that you're
[25:09] alone and that nobody knows or that
[25:12] nobody cares because he cares. Yeah. And
[25:16] he knows exactly what you're going
[25:19] through at this particular time. Praise
[25:22] God. You see, back then, brother Brandon
[25:25] was only calling out the people's
[25:28] natural names. Calling out their natural
[25:32] names. But now we are under the third or
[25:37] the third attraction to the word. And
[25:40] God still calls us our names. Amen. But
[25:43] now it's not just your natural name.
[25:47] He's calling on your secret name.
[25:51] He's calling out your spiritual name.
[25:54] Amen. He's here to call on your
[25:56] supernatural name. By the revealing of
[26:00] the word of God. Amen. Amen. Praise be
[26:03] to God. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Oh, yes.
[26:07] call you by the name that you had with
[26:12] him before the foundations of the world.
[26:17] You never even knew that you had a name
[26:20] and then before the foundations of the
[26:23] world. You see when Jesus was born and
[26:27] he got his he came here they says his
[26:31] name shall be called Jesus. Amen. But
[26:34] really of course that was Jehovah of the
[26:38] Old Testament became Jesus of the New
[26:41] Testament. So his heavenly name was
[26:43] Jehovah. But then when he came to earth
[26:46] they had to give him an earthly name and
[26:48] they called him Jesus. In the same way
[26:51] you if you were a believer and he left
[26:53] you were with God and in God before the
[26:56] foundations of the world. But what
[26:59] happens when you got here and you come
[27:01] from mother and the father? name and
[27:04] your earthly name. But he not only knows
[27:07] your earthly name, he knows your
[27:10] supernatural name. He knows the name
[27:13] your name from before the foundations of
[27:16] the world. Yes, certainly. And that is
[27:18] the reason why that he could uh call you
[27:22] out by his grace unto his mercy. Amen.
[27:26] Now if we go through the Bible you will
[27:29] find that Abraham was in Ura of the
[27:33] chalicees
[27:35] which was below that to be Babylon today
[27:38] or Iran uh in Iran. So there it was my
[27:43] friends uh sorry Iran and so now we
[27:46] understand that God called Abraham.
[27:49] Abraham was there worshiping idols until
[27:52] he heard a voice said Abra. Abraham,
[27:56] get up and get out of this country to a
[27:59] place that I will call you. Amen. Now,
[28:03] what voice? Who knew his name? It was
[28:06] God that knew his name. God knew his
[28:09] name, Samuel. He was just a boy in the
[28:13] temple serving uh there uh with the
[28:17] priest Eli when there were he was
[28:20] praying in his little room in the back
[28:23] of the temple and he heard a voice
[28:25] saying Samuel
[28:27] Samuel
[28:29] Samuel and he says yes sir yes sir and
[28:33] he got up and went to the high priest.
[28:35] Is that right? Uh uh because he knew
[28:38] nothing about spiritual things. And the
[28:40] priest said, "Go back and you know, go
[28:42] to go back to bed or go back to prayer."
[28:45] Went back to prayer and he heard the
[28:46] voice, "Samuel,
[28:48] Samuel." Got him and went to the priest
[28:51] again. And the priest understood that
[28:54] that was not a natural voice, but that
[28:56] was a supernatural voice that was
[28:58] calling Samuel.
[29:01] So he said, "The next time you hear that
[29:03] voice, say, speak, Lord, thy servant
[29:07] hears." Amen. Praise God. So he went
[29:10] right back, began to pray, and again he
[29:13] heard the voice, Samuel,
[29:15] Samuel,
[29:17] Samuel. He said, speak Lord, thy servant
[29:21] ears. And then God begins to tell him
[29:24] that the old priest is going to soon be
[29:26] taken away, and I want you to be my
[29:29] prophet, and you're going to now take
[29:31] his place and stuff like that. God be to
[29:34] speak to him. You see, God knows our
[29:36] names. Amen. And he knows our names. But
[29:40] not only does he know your name, he
[29:41] knows your position in life. He knew
[29:44] that he was supposed to be a prophet.
[29:47] And he knew his name and told him what
[29:50] his position was going to be upon the
[29:53] earth. Now there was another man by the
[29:56] name of Gideon and he was poor, very
[29:59] poor, and they had harvested
[30:03] uh some grain and they tried to rob the
[30:06] Philistine government to his dad. But
[30:10] because instead of paying the taxes,
[30:12] they went and hid some of the wheat.
[30:15] And when they hid it, there he was with
[30:18] the wheat m. And suddenly a man in white
[30:21] appeared and said, "Oh, mighty man of
[30:25] Gideon, thou mighty man of others." And
[30:28] he looked around maybe to see who is
[30:30] this mighty man. Because he he said,
[30:32] "I'm the poorest of the poor." What
[30:34] mighty? Ah. He says, "The the poorest of
[30:37] the people in the nation and my father
[30:40] and I are the poorest of those poor."
[30:43] So, uh, no. He said, the angel says,
[30:45] "No, I'm going to be with you, right?
[30:49] Because I call you now to be the
[30:51] deliverer of my people Israel." Amen.
[30:54] Hallelujah. See, God knew his name.
[30:58] Amen. But he, Gideon, didn't even know
[31:01] his own self. He did not even know his
[31:04] own position. He didn't know what he was
[31:06] supposed to do. So God made it clear to
[31:10] him that you, my friend, are supposed to
[31:13] be deliverer. Jeremiah, God said to
[31:17] Jeremiah, before you were in your
[31:20] mother's belly, I knew you. Amen. And I
[31:24] called you by name and I called you to
[31:27] be my prophet. Yes, Lord. Amen. Praise
[31:30] God. God knows our names.
[31:34] You didn't just have them on this earth,
[31:36] but you are here for a purpose. Amen.
[31:39] And God wants to use every one of us if
[31:43] we will surrender our lives to him.
[31:47] Not the lifestyle that you're in right
[31:49] now. But God is calling you out here
[31:52] today by his grace. Not your natural
[31:55] name, but by the opening of the word.
[31:58] He's calling you to attention to pay
[32:00] attention to your life. Pay attention to
[32:03] your future. Pay attention to how you're
[32:05] living. The attention to where you come
[32:08] from, where you're going, who your
[32:11] father is, your real father is. Amen.
[32:14] Glory to God. Hallelujah. Amen. Oh,
[32:18] praise God. We remember that young
[32:20] virgin 18 years old. And there she was.
[32:25] Suddenly an angel appeared. Mary
[32:29] all the most blessed amongst all women.
[32:33] Why? Because she was to bear the Christ
[32:36] to carry the word for her day. She was
[32:39] blessed among all the churches to carry
[32:41] the word for her hour. Oh, God knew her
[32:45] name. Hallelujah. A prophet can prophesy
[32:48] Isaiah. You know the scripture who is a
[32:52] a virgin will conceive and bear a son
[32:55] and his name shall be called wonderful
[32:58] counselor a mighty God everlasting
[33:00] father and the prince of peace.
[33:03] Hallelujah. When Isaiah said a virgin
[33:05] will conceive God already knew her name.
[33:08] God knew the virgin's name. So my
[33:12] friends, the word of God will always
[33:15] come to the predestinated
[33:19] vessel that was predestinated before
[33:22] time to receive that word.
[33:26] It can't go anywhere else because she
[33:29] was supposed to be that virgin.
[33:31] Hallelujah. And all day the word of God
[33:34] couldn't go anywhere else to have to
[33:36] contact you. Hallelujah. As this brother
[33:41] preached, he has to pass your way. He
[33:45] had to pass your way. Oh, praise God. He
[33:48] could not bypass you, but he had to pass
[33:50] your way. Remember the woman at the
[33:53] well, he told his disciples, he said,
[33:55] "You all go on. I must leave. I need to
[33:59] go through Samaria."
[34:02] He needs to do what? Because he knew he
[34:04] had one sheep there. He knew he had one
[34:07] soul there, one person that he had to
[34:09] call out. Amen. Praise God. I'm sorry.
[34:13] The message of the hour is passing your
[34:16] way. Jesus is passing your way in the
[34:20] gospel. Hallelujah. Yes sir. So we see
[34:24] again here was Simon Peter a fisherman.
[34:29] And when he came he says, "Oh, your name
[34:31] is Simon." He says, "And your father's
[34:34] name is." He tell him what his name was.
[34:38] Tell him about his father's name and
[34:39] that his father was a good man. Later
[34:42] on, we find out that he had a brother by
[34:45] the name of Andrew. And Andrew came and
[34:48] went out and he went to tell his friend
[34:51] how the Messiah is on earth now and how
[34:54] the Messiah is doing this wonderful
[34:56] works. And so Daniel said, "Oh, I can't
[34:59] be bothered with that." Because he was a
[35:01] dean. was one that loved to study the
[35:03] Bible, do a lot of Bible studies, but he
[35:05] had no revelation. So, here he was. And
[35:09] he said that while they were sitting
[35:11] under a fig tree, cuz you know in
[35:13] Israel, they have the fig trees and then
[35:15] uh for it's it's shade to them. They
[35:18] have one in the yard and it's like a
[35:19] shade and it sit there and do things.
[35:22] So, it was a shade and that's what
[35:24] happened. So what happened is that uh
[35:27] when later on Philip came to him uh
[35:30] Andrew he said Philip came to him he
[35:32] said Philillip Philip gives him to
[35:34] Daniel let's go come and see at least
[35:39] you got to come and see you either heard
[35:42] about it you may not even believe it but
[35:45] come and see you heard people talk about
[35:47] this William Brandon talk about this
[35:49] passage you hear people talk about this
[35:52] uh seven church ages the mystery of God,
[35:54] fellowship of the Holy Spirit. You don't
[35:56] know about it, but at least come and
[35:58] see.
[36:00] Oh, and here comes Nathaniel walking. As
[36:04] Nathaniel was approaching, he saw some
[36:06] people and they were surrounding
[36:08] somebody. And as he was walking, all of
[36:11] a sudden, h Jesus looked at him and he
[36:15] said, "Oh, behold an Israelite that is
[36:19] is without dial." In other words, he he
[36:22] has not come to him. And he's just a
[36:24] plain simple man. Ah, and he said,
[36:27] "Master, when did you know me?" He said,
[36:30] "When Philillip was calling you, when
[36:32] you were under the victory, I saw you."
[36:35] Oh, praise God forever more. He knew
[36:38] about Daniel and was able to call him
[36:41] out. Not just his natural name, but it
[36:46] told him the circumstances surrounding
[36:48] him. And he recognized it was him that
[36:52] Jesus was talking about. I hope you can
[36:54] recognize him speaking to you today
[36:57] by calling out your name and your
[36:59] address. Not your home address, but the
[37:02] real address where you are living now
[37:05] under the circumstances that you're
[37:07] living now, under the conditions that
[37:10] you're living now, that he would call
[37:12] you out of that and that you would
[37:14] recognize that he's talking to you.
[37:16] Amen. Praise the Lord. He called them
[37:20] out into service. Praise God.
[37:23] Hallelujah.
[37:24] What about Saul? You remember when Paul
[37:27] was persecuting the Christians and here
[37:30] he was thinking that he was supposed to
[37:32] be the the defender of the law and
[37:35] everything else. And while he was doing
[37:38] that, all of a sudden, he was stripped
[37:41] off of his high horse. Sometimes some of
[37:44] us got to be knocked off of our high
[37:46] horse. M once we start thinking too much
[37:49] of ourselves, sometimes God have to
[37:52] knock us off that high horse so that we
[37:55] will begin to recognize that there's a
[37:56] God in heaven that rules over everything
[37:59] that we humble ourselves. No matter who
[38:02] we are, no matter what God bless us
[38:04] with, no matter how much we accomplish,
[38:07] no matter how many certifications we
[38:08] have on the wall, we must recognize that
[38:11] we are nothing before our maker. Is that
[38:14] right? We have nothing before maker.
[38:16] Humble yourself and God will come near
[38:19] you. Amen. Humble yourself and his
[38:22] presence will cheer you. You will not
[38:24] walk with the boundar.
[38:27] Humble yourself if you want to walk with
[38:29] God. Amen. So it's very important that
[38:32] we humble ourselves and recognize what
[38:36] God is doing. So here it is. The light
[38:38] came. He heard a voice from heaven say,
[38:40] "Saul, Saul, why persecute thou me?" And
[38:44] of course he says, "Who art thou, Lord?"
[38:47] Right away he acknowledged that was God
[38:49] calling him.
[38:51] And later on
[38:53] uh he went into the city and God went to
[38:56] a little old prophet and say, "Ananas,
[38:58] go there and baptize uh Saul. His name
[39:02] you his name is now changed to Paul. You
[39:05] go baptize Paul." Amen. First he was
[39:08] Saul, but now his name changed to Paul.
[39:10] Amen. That's a change took place there.
[39:13] And Ananas went up to him and said,
[39:15] "Brother Paul, receive thy sight." And
[39:18] he received his sight. He baptized him
[39:20] in water
[39:22] Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Amen. But the
[39:25] calling of their names was to call them
[39:28] into service. Amen. When God calls your
[39:31] name is to put you into action and put
[39:34] you into service. Hallelujah. And God
[39:38] wants to put every one of us here in the
[39:41] service for his glory and for his honor.
[39:45] Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. I want you
[39:48] to recognize exactly now what is in a
[39:51] name anyway.
[39:53] Listen to brother Brad. Praise God. Now
[39:58] the church name is associated with the
[40:02] nature of its character.
[40:04] Now sma means bitter
[40:08] and the name has to do with the
[40:10] character. Your name has the same thing.
[40:13] It has to do with your character. Your
[40:17] name does. Remember when Jacob was born
[40:20] they call him Jacob which means
[40:22] trickster, suppler. But when he wrestled
[40:25] with God, God changed his name to Israel
[40:29] meaning a prince with God. And Saul of
[40:32] Tarsus when his name changed it was
[40:35] called Paul. When Simon's name was
[40:37] changed, Amen. he was called Peter. See
[40:41] your name has an impression upon your
[40:45] character. Everything is named. You
[40:48] don't call something a chair just for
[40:51] the n for the word. It's because that's
[40:54] the nature of the thing. If you say
[40:56] tiger, you're talking about the nature
[40:58] of the thing. So name and nature goes
[41:01] together. That's why it's very important
[41:04] what you name your children too, right?
[41:06] Nobody wants to name their children
[41:08] Jezebel.
[41:11] Who wants to call their daughter Elijah?
[41:14] Is that right? You know, see who wants
[41:16] to do that? You don't want to call uh
[41:19] your son some kind of a name like uh oh
[41:23] Judas.
[41:25] Why would you call your child Judas?
[41:27] See, because that name carries, you
[41:29] could call it superstition, but that's
[41:31] the Bible telling me. Amen. That name
[41:35] puts a nature on that person or that
[41:38] animal. A dog is a dog because he's a
[41:41] dog. And a dog is a duck because if it's
[41:44] a dog, it walks like a duck, acts like a
[41:46] duck, is a duck. You can't call it
[41:48] something else. See, so the name and the
[41:51] nature goes together. And so your name
[41:55] has influence on your character. Amen.
[41:58] So because of your earthly name, you
[42:01] were born in sin.
[42:03] Your earthly name is connected with
[42:05] being born in sin. But thank God, he
[42:08] promised that if you repent of your
[42:10] sins, I'll give you a new name. I'll
[42:14] give you a new name. Praise God.
[42:16] Hallelujah. And that's a name that he
[42:18] knew from back up in heaven when he knew
[42:22] you from before the foundations of the
[42:26] world. Amen. Now, that name is going to
[42:28] be new to you, but it's not new to him.
[42:31] Is that right? New to you, but not new
[42:34] to him because he told the disciples, "I
[42:38] know my sheep
[42:41] and I call them by their names." He
[42:45] knows your name. and they're following.
[42:48] Why? Because they recognize my voice.
[42:51] Amen. When his voice calls your name,
[42:54] your condition, your position. Amen.
[42:57] Then what? You answer to your name. You
[42:59] can have a crowd of people here. And yet
[43:01] if somebody says, uh, Mary or John, all
[43:05] the Johns, all the Marys, turn right
[43:07] around because that's your name. Right
[43:10] now, it's not calling your natural name.
[43:13] But now we understand, brothers and
[43:15] sisters, that the seven seals are open.
[43:18] Amen. Hallelujah. And when the seven
[43:21] seals open, the names of the elected
[43:25] that were in the lamb's book of life are
[43:28] being called out by the preaching of the
[43:32] word. Amen. Your name is in this book.
[43:37] If you're an elected child of God, not
[43:40] James, John, Susan, a name like that. Is
[43:43] that right? But your name is in certain
[43:47] scriptures. Mhm. And when a minister
[43:51] begins to hit or preach on that
[43:55] particular scripture that the secret
[43:57] name is hidden under, right away
[44:00] something begins to grab a hold of your
[44:02] heart.
[44:04] grabs your attention
[44:06] because now it's not just the minister
[44:08] talking. It's God the great one calling
[44:12] your name by the preaching of the word.
[44:15] Amen. And your name is hidden under the
[44:18] representation
[44:19] of the word of God. Salvation
[44:22] representation to salvation
[44:24] representation from condemnation.
[44:25] Whatever that is. See, it's either side.
[44:28] Under Adam, all die. Under Christ, all
[44:31] are made alive. But he, Lord, y and uh
[44:35] that great thing is happening right now.
[44:38] And I believe he's here and he's calling
[44:41] out to some people here today by his
[44:43] grace to answer him to repent to change
[44:46] your way of life.
[44:48] Stop being just a church
[44:51] or somebody you claim to believe the
[44:53] message. Live it.
[44:56] Stop talking about it. You know what
[44:58] Nike's uh Nike was saying is just go do
[45:02] it. Just do it. Don't just talk talk
[45:05] talk talk do it. See, so that's the
[45:08] point. No, no. Just talk. A lot of
[45:09] people talking Christianity. They're
[45:11] talking religion. They're they're
[45:13] talking scripture. They're talking
[45:14] quotes. They're talking everything, but
[45:16] their life don't reflect what they're
[45:18] talking about.
[45:20] Don't just talk for a living. Release it
[45:23] in your life. You don't have to say
[45:25] nothing because your actions will speak
[45:27] louder than your voice. Hallelujah. Your
[45:30] reactions will speak louder than your
[45:32] voice and people will recognize that you
[45:34] are a question hardly without you having
[45:36] to say anything. Praise be to God.
[45:39] Hallelujah. Amen. Yes sir. I want to
[45:42] give you listen to uh brother speaking
[45:44] here now. He said if a man die shall he
[45:47] live again. The great shepherd is now
[45:51] calling his sheep, calling them out by
[45:54] name.
[45:56] The creative voice is calling them forth
[46:00] from the dust or changing the very aams
[46:06] even though they had not yet fallen
[46:09] asleep.
[46:10] Oh wow. Praise God. Hallelujah. It is
[46:14] the rapture. It is the great marriage
[46:17] supper. of the lamb. The great shepherd
[46:21] is calling for his sheep.
[46:24] Come home. Come home. It's supper time.
[46:28] Oh yes. Amen. Do you know that? Oh yes.
[46:31] Amen. The shadows ling.
[46:36] Come home. Come home in supper time.
[46:40] We're going
[46:42] home at last. Supper time. Feasting on
[46:46] the word of God. That's the supper that
[46:49] we are feasting on right now. A seven
[46:52] course meal prepared by the greatest
[46:54] chef. Amen. You know God is a baker. You
[46:57] know he baked bread in the wilderness
[47:00] for the Israelites there for 40 years. I
[47:02] mean that bread where there was no
[47:04] bakeries whatever dropping down out of
[47:06] the sky. He prepared meat and he knows
[47:08] how to prepare meat from there. Praise
[47:11] God. He made all kinds of of of foul uh
[47:15] lion foul fly into their camp and and
[47:17] and they they don't have to haunt them.
[47:19] They just were picking them up like that
[47:21] and preparing them to eat. God knows
[47:23] what he's doing.
[47:25] But in the last day now, this great chef
[47:28] is now prepared us a seven course meal.
