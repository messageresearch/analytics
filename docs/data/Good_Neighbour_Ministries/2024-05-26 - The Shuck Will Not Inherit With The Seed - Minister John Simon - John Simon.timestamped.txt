[36:31] the word of God goes forth and your
[36:35] spirit deep calling to the deep that the
[36:38] holy spirit will respond to you and you
[36:41] will respond to him and together we can

[37:06] one of you here in the house of God
[37:09] those that are not uh present are out
[37:12] there somewhere in the world God will
[37:15] protect them and bring them safely back
[37:17] to us again our older Believers that
[37:21] physically you know uh they're not
[37:24] capable of moving like they used to
[37:26] before and one day you'll get that way
[37:29] but uh if the Rapture permits but uh
[37:32] meanwhile we have to think about them
[37:35] too so some of them may be watching
[37:37] online right now I want them to know
[37:40] that we remember them can you say an
[37:42] amen am we're thinking about them amen
[37:46] and pray that the spirit of God will uh
[37:50] uh just uh confirm the word to them as
[37:54] much uh as he does to us that they will
[37:57] have the same reaction whether they're
[37:59] in their living room on their bed in
[38:02] their bedroom because of pain illness
[38:04] whatever uh it's that time of life
[38:07] they're free to do whatever they want as
[38:09] long as they're serving God and giving
[38:11] him their whole heart we pray God will
[38:14] bless us all together God bless you
[38:16] we'll turn give our first text up there
[38:20] I believe it's in
[38:24] Genesis
[38:26] 21 9 to
[38:35] 10 praise the
[38:41] Lord and shall we read the
[38:44] scripture and Sarah saw the son of Hagar
[38:48] the Egyptian which she had born unto
[38:53] Abraham mocking
[38:57] wherefore she said unto Abraham cast out
[39:00] this Bond woman and her son for the son
[39:04] of this Bond woman shall not be air with
[39:08] my son even Isaac amen praise the Lord
[39:13] God bless you our gracious father as we
[39:17] taught on these things and as the Holy
[39:21] Spirit just brought the Simplicity of it
[39:23] we pray that the holy spirit will bless
[39:26] us up and raise us up from being
[39:30] Earthbound like like the Hawks and the
[39:33] other rabbits but to be real eagles of
[39:36] God with sharp eyes and oh God
[39:40] Discerning of Hebrews 4:12 the spirit of
[39:44] Christ resting upon us living in us and
[39:48] may you be glorified in all this for we
[39:51] ask it in Jesus name praise the Lord God
[39:53] bless you please be seated
[39:58] the topic today is the shock will not
[40:02] inherit with the
[40:05] seed now if you will no this brother
[40:08] brenham's message it was the seed will
[40:12] not be air with the shock and he was
[40:17] correct because uh he was actually
[40:22] referring that the real seed is not in
[40:25] Pentecostal they're not going to take
[40:27] the Pentecostal message in other words
[40:30] those that died Faithfully in Pentecost
[40:33] they will inherit that inheritance that
[40:36] they had over there which is to be part
[40:38] of the Bride but not in this they're not
[40:42] going to be here so back then he had to
[40:45] say say it that the the seed will not be
[40:51] air with the shock that's right right
[40:54] but now we are in this day and we are
[40:57] saying it how we see it from the word
[41:01] that is the shock or the husk will not
[41:05] inherit the Kingdom with the seed they
[41:08] they have no place in it they can't see
[41:10] it they don't know how to enter it how
[41:12] are they going to be a part of it they
[41:14] can't be a part of it now let's that's
[41:16] just so you understand what direction I
[41:19] am going in with all that will be said
[41:23] praise the Lord and we look to the
[41:26] leodan church Age first of all a if you
[41:31] are still in any doubt about
[41:34] this ask God by his Spirit to fill you
[41:38] and Lead You for the elect can't be
[41:42] fooled do you believe that right I'm
[41:45] talking about the true elect I'm not
[41:47] talking about you think or you call
[41:50] yourself or you imagine but when you
[41:53] know that you have entered the king's
[41:56] chamber
[41:58] when you know you have stepped Beyond
[42:00] the Veil of this word when you know that
[42:04] you recognize him and he recognizes you
[42:09] and he is responding back to you as you
[42:11] live for him then you're in a different
[42:14] realm all together and you can't be
[42:19] fooled yes I'm telling you it's
[42:21] impossible when you become and you
[42:24] recognize not become in the sense of you
[42:26] know now going to become like it says
[42:29] you shall become the sons of God it's
[42:31] not meaning that you now become the sons
[42:33] of God but I want you to see this you
[42:36] can't be fooled why because the Christ
[42:39] lives in you the spirit of God lives in
[42:42] you how are you going to be fooled now
[42:46] not to say because of your flesh you may
[42:49] be temporarily thrown off balance
[42:52] because of your flesh but that spirit
[42:55] that is in you is going to show you
[42:58] right then or later or in the night or
[43:02] the next day he's going to make it clear
[43:05] clear to you that you will recognize you
[43:08] can't be fooled Hallelujah so don't let
[43:11] the devil put a spirit of fear upon you
[43:15] that you're going to hear something from
[43:17] somebody that's going to deceive you or
[43:19] lead you off this way or in that
[43:21] direction you can't be
[43:24] deceived praise God can can God be
[43:28] deceived about himself of who he
[43:30] is well oh my think about it so the
[43:35] elect there isn't any man can fool
[43:38] you Paul could not fool the elect had he
[43:42] been
[43:43] wrong and in the first Ephesian AG the
[43:47] elect there could not be fooled for they
[43:51] tried the false Apostles and Prophets
[43:55] and found them to be Liars and put them
[43:58] out Hallelujah his sheep hear his voice
[44:02] and they follow him praise God careful
[44:06] brother Simon remember those are our
[44:08] Brethren and you're talking about
[44:10] putting them out you you you're tough
[44:13] your hard you're talking about uh you
[44:16] know just let not come back here to this
[44:19] church go somewhere else but not here
[44:22] you're a little too tough no but it's in
[44:24] the word they tried by the word and
[44:29] found that there were
[44:31] Liars we didn't know there were Liars
[44:34] before but when our eyes got opened when
[44:38] we got the Revelation then these Giants
[44:41] begin to look like they were small they
[44:44] were Liars for who they are they try to
[44:47] make themselves Great Men great uh great
[44:51] images in in the messes great images in
[44:54] the world and we realize no oh oh boo
[44:59] down boo down boo P nothing nothing
[45:03] behind them because we are standing on
[45:06] the word of the Living God hallelujah we
[45:09] are the sons of God we are the children
[45:12] of God you are Daughters of God and sons
[45:15] of God walking in the light of this day
[45:19] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[45:22] thank you Lord amen now
[45:27] thinking man's
[45:30] filter Israel was all outwardly
[45:35] spiritual he says spiritually but he
[45:37] means
[45:38] spiritual all filled with God's goodness
[45:42] like the Pentecostals today claim
[45:44] they're filled with the spirit of God
[45:46] and some of them really live holy lives
[45:49] they live really live decent clean nice
[45:52] beautiful people but God is not looking
[45:55] at how beautiful you are outside God is
[45:59] Not Looking how how holy you dress
[46:01] outside of course that's important but
[46:04] God is not he's looking to see search
[46:07] for his sons and his daughters and see
[46:10] the seeds in his
[46:12] heart you you can fool me 100% of the
[46:17] time that you are here on Earth but when
[46:20] you get to glory god knows your heart
[46:23] you're not hiding from
[46:25] anybody right you you're just hiding
[46:27] from man you're not hiding from God you
[46:31] commit all kind of vile acts all kind of
[46:33] wicked things and then turn around call
[46:35] yourself a Son of God call yourself a
[46:37] child of God God knows all about it you
[46:41] can't hide it from him amen praise God
[46:44] in the book of his remembrance it's all
[46:47] written down and when the books are open
[46:49] they'll come right up before you where
[46:51] you can't deny it amen if man has tape
[46:55] recorders that can show you your
[46:57] from years ago and give you films of
[46:59] what you were doing God has better than
[47:02] that amen he knows your very thoughts
[47:05] the prophet said even your thoughts are
[47:08] heard louder in heaven amen the thoughts
[47:12] of your heart are heard louder in heaven
[47:14] than your words that you're talking
[47:16] about amen now
[47:19] notice filled with God's goodness they
[47:23] reverence God but that didn't work
[47:27] inside of them could not recognize the
[47:31] word itself they couldn't recognize the
[47:34] word itself and right there and then
[47:38] they absolutely put themselves out you
[47:42] see before we put them out they put
[47:44] themselves out because they can't
[47:47] recognize the word of God but when you
[47:51] are born of the spirit of God then you
[47:55] are a son of God
[47:57] you always was a Son of God Amen and you
[48:02] always will be a Son of God do you
[48:05] believe
[48:08] that and no way to separate it because
[48:12] you have eternal life and eternal never
[48:18] did
[48:19] begin you believe that am Eternal never
[48:22] did begin so you see Pentecost not just
[48:25] Pentecostal all the churches out there
[48:29] believe telling the people and teaching
[48:30] them they were saved on a certain day
[48:33] that's the day when you got eternal life
[48:36] it's when you got saved on a day and
[48:38] they right then contradict themselves by
[48:42] by saying that because you are now
[48:44] saying Eternal is not really Eternal
[48:47] because Eternal has no beginning it has
[48:50] no ending it's a big circle and it keeps
[48:53] going and going and going and going and
[48:55] it can never end amen amen so we see
[48:59] then that we have eternal life all for
[49:02] the grace of God that he would give us
[49:06] understanding of such mystery that's
[49:09] Grace you know brother Tim that's Grace
[49:11] that you can understand what you're
[49:14] understanding now you can't get it in a
[49:17] school they can't teach you it by Logic
[49:20] by the the theologic or theologians or
[49:23] they can't teach you by any of those
[49:26] Sciences
[49:27] this can only come by Revelation through
[49:30] the opening of The Eyes Of Your Heart
[49:32] the spirit of the Living God deciding
[49:35] your day your time your hour and make
[49:38] himself known to you other than that
[49:41] you'll sit right there amen may my my my
[49:45] listen my daughter had a dog the dog is
[49:48] dead now we all mourned for the dog and
[49:51] everything else but uh and truly we felt
[49:54] very
[49:55] sad but she had a a whistle and uh she
[49:59] used that whistle and the dog will raise
[50:02] his head up but when she blew the
[50:04] whistle I heard
[50:05] nothing is that something I heard
[50:08] nothing and the scientist said that's
[50:11] because the dogs hearing is so sensitive
[50:15] it's on such a higher dimension of
[50:18] hearing that when you blow the whistle
[50:21] yes you don't hear any sound but the all
[50:24] of a sudden all the dogs turn around and
[50:26] then that particular one that's yours
[50:29] they know that you're really calling for
[50:31] and they run to you well that's just a
[50:33] little human example of what the
[50:36] preaching of the words is doing now I'm
[50:39] standing here I preaching all of you
[50:41] sitting here everybody hearing my voice
[50:44] but the word that's going forth from
[50:47] within me is only coming to the elected
[50:51] ears of your heart only the elected ears
[50:56] those with elected ears amen you can
[50:59] understand with your head but we're not
[51:01] talking about that amen praise God we're
[51:04] not talking about
[51:05] intelligence amen praise God because you
[51:08] have human intelligence you have
[51:10] Supernatural intelligence you got two
[51:12] kinds of knowledge knowledge accumulated
[51:15] Knowledge from Human Experience books
[51:18] learning that you only can embe or take
[51:21] into your body or your being with your
[51:23] through your five senses there's no
[51:25] other way you take it into three of five
[51:27] senses but there is a six sense there is
[51:30] another way a second way of knowledge
[51:33] that's given only by God through the
[51:36] super sense through the revelation of
[51:39] the word that'll strike your soul amen
[51:43] you know if you really ever had a real
[51:45] Vision or a real uh dream where God
[51:48] reveals himself you'll understand that
[51:51] God will only speak one word you might
[51:55] just say go
[51:57] but within that go right what you hear
[52:01] is just go but what I hear when he says
[52:05] go I see the place where he want me to
[52:08] go I know what he want me to do when I
[52:11] get to that place all of that and much
[52:14] more than that wrapped up in one word go
[52:18] you understand Revelation is like that
[52:21] God just say one thing and a whole world
[52:24] opens
[52:25] up praise be to God
[52:28] hallelujah amen let me give you another
[52:32] example under the Pentecost Holy Spirit
[52:35] fell everybody ran out their doors and
[52:38] the disciples staggering out on the
[52:40] street hallelujah amen my God and he
[52:44] said what does this all mean amen oh
[52:48] praise God you know Peter answered them
[52:50] this is that praise God and he spoke the
[52:53] word of God and the Bible say
[52:57] said and they all heard it are not these
[53:00] people speaking
[53:02] Galilean what is the supernatural
[53:05] miracle that one from capid doia one
[53:08] from Asia one from this place one from
[53:10] the other place all around the world but
[53:12] all of us are hearing and
[53:15] understanding we understanding at the
[53:17] same time you see God only speaks one
[53:21] word and every race and Nation Under the
[53:25] Sun will understand it
[53:27] he doesn't have to go learning having
[53:29] language skills he's the author he's the
[53:32] Creator so when he speaks the word
[53:34] whoever they are they hear the word amen
[53:37] they don't care about nothing else they
[53:38] are hearing the truth they're hearing
[53:41] the word of God going forth praise God
[53:44] forever more hallelujah amen praise God
[53:48] now we see this that we have eternal
[53:51] life through Jesus Christ Our Lord God
[53:54] hallelujah thanks be to God God let me
[53:57] move on here before we get into
[53:59] something here amen amen yes sir now
[54:04] notice carefully in the word of God here
[54:08] the word cannot deny
[54:11] itself amen I have heard but now I
[54:17] see amen
[54:20] now because down in your soul there was
[54:25] a pred destinated
[54:28] seed which was eternal
[54:33] life you heard what the seed was and is
[54:37] what the seed is eternal
[54:39] life is in you you you didn't come at
[54:43] the altar and ask God now give me
[54:46] eternal life but the gift of God is
[54:49] eternal life and he already gave you
[54:53] eternal life that it could reside in
[54:55] your spirit
[54:57] and the habitation of God is now in men
[55:00] and with men and he lives in US moves in
[55:03] us has his being in us we become his
[55:06] Temple of the Holy Ghost because God
[55:09] lives in us hallelujah Solomon said I'll
[55:13] build you a house he said I'll build my
[55:15] own house amen the temple passed away
[55:18] the temple is broken down I went to
[55:20] Jerusalem and see the great Stones all
[55:23] on the ground all around but it wasn't
[55:25] just that Temple he was speaking about
[55:28] the heavens of Heavens he says can't
[55:30] contain me he says they can't hold me
[55:32] I'll build my own house and his house
[55:35] was what his house is an eternal house
[55:38] his house is an indestructible house
[55:41] amen praise be to God hallelujah amen
[55:45] I'm just holding that I don't go off on
[55:47] tangents here but see now down in your
[55:51] soul there was a predestinated seed
[55:54] which was eternal
[55:58] life always laying there always was in
[56:02] there and all that the father has given
[56:05] me will come to me there isn't any of
[56:09] them are as going to be lost Hallelujah
[56:13] you believe that am is anybody here
[56:15] going to be lost raise your hand oh I
[56:19] almost caught one couple of
[56:23] you no nobody that a real child of God
[56:28] can ever be
[56:30] lost you can't be lost because you are
[56:34] his sons and his daughters and you're
[56:38] walking in his grace amen praise the
[56:42] Lord God thank you Jesus oh praise God
[56:46] uh that's from the thinking man's filter
[56:48] sorry brother yes amen now when any
[56:54] thinking man hears the word of of God my
[56:57] sheep hear my voice and a stranger they
[57:00] will not
[57:02] follow why down in there is
[57:06] life and life connects with life is the
[57:12] same thing as saying the Deep calls to
[57:15] the Deep life connects with life well in
[57:20] other words life is not going to go
[57:23] somewhere to fall on something or
[57:26] someone where there is no life in there
[57:29] that it can germinate or wake up again
[57:33] bring to life again you see a person
[57:36] can't be borned again they can't be
[57:40] borned again if they didn't have some
[57:44] birth somewhere
[57:46] before right see that's why Jesus said
[57:49] how can a man go up up to heaven if he
[57:53] at first didn't come down from heaven no
[57:55] man can go back into heaven if he didn't
[57:57] come from there amen so we are not
[58:00] really from here when I say we not your
[58:03] flesh but the soul that's inside you're
[58:05] not from here that Paul said we are
[58:08] aliens we are strangers we are not from
[58:10] here oh your flesh was born in this
[58:13] country that country yes that's this man
[58:16] but that man inside is a Heavenly
[58:20] being amen he's
[58:23] Timeless amen I said You're Timeless
[58:27] your
[58:28] eternity you come from God and you're
[58:31] going back to God your father is really
[58:35] God he just used an Earthly man and a
[58:38] mother to produce a manifestation of
[58:41] Flesh that your soul can live in while
[58:44] it's here on Earth to serve its life's
[58:47] purpose and fulfill its mission that the
[58:50] father has placed within your life and
[58:52] within your heart amen I believe it it's
[58:55] the word of God praise God do you
[58:57] believe it oh praise God forever more
[59:01] amen yes sir I tell you this is truly
[59:06] the word that we are living by here in
[59:10] in this day and in this hour praise God
[59:14] look if I stumble around and go around
[59:16] like that it's because I'm going in and
[59:19] out and I'm just moving just the way
[59:21] that God wants me to move praise the
[59:23] Lord here now understand
[59:27] clearly amen praise the Lord
[59:31] that this word of God connects only with
[59:35] life in other words remember when Jesus
[59:37] went down in the water and when he came
[59:39] up what happens you see a dove coming
[59:43] down from the heavens and lighting upon
[59:46] him which we know that was the Holy
[59:49] Spirit coming down upon him we won't
[59:52] talk about the trinitarians having a
[59:54] problem with that uh uh saying how can
[59:57] it be one God when there is one coming
[1:00:00] from the heavens one sitting in the
[1:00:02] water and then I Heard a Voice so it's
[1:00:04] three as if God can't be in a million
[1:00:07] places at the same time and still be God
[1:00:11] he's answering prayers around the world
[1:00:13] right now while we're speaking by the
[1:00:15] millions and he's still one God he's
[1:00:18] healing people he's doing everything and
[1:00:20] he's still one God and adopted the
[1:00:23] Babylonian system of trinitarian ISM
[1:00:26] which was not is not even in the Bible
[1:00:28] and they triy to explain it as much as
[1:00:31] they can like he's a bunch of grapes and
[1:00:34] mocking him blaspheming against him he's
[1:00:36] like light he's like grapes he's like
[1:00:38] this three of that and three of that but
[1:00:40] there's only one God and his name is
[1:00:44] Jesus Christ amen Jehovah of the Old
[1:00:47] Testament is the Jesus of the new that
[1:00:50] Jehovah eternal spirit made a flesh body
[1:00:54] through a virgin brought it to birth
[1:00:57] amen and lived in that body that's why
[1:01:00] Jesus could say my father that dwelleth
[1:01:03] in me he do the works I and my father
[1:01:06] are one not three and one sat on the
[1:01:10] throne Revelation 5 amen one not three
[1:01:13] John said I looked and I saw one amen
[1:01:17] there's only one God hero Israel the
[1:01:20] Lord thy God is one Lord there's no
[1:01:23] other God beside me behind me before me
[1:01:27] only I Stand Alone amen the true and the
[1:01:30] Living God he is the one that we serve
[1:01:33] amen praise God hallelujah yes sir I
[1:01:37] certainly believe that life connects
[1:01:40] with life praise God what's the use the
[1:01:43] Holy Spirit falling on a piece of stone
[1:01:46] or
[1:01:47] brick you think that's going to come to
[1:01:49] life no he's going where we know there's
[1:01:52] a seed hidden under the dirt that's dirt
[1:01:56] you know but there's a soul there is a
[1:01:58] life there's a seed hidden under there
[1:02:01] the in individual might not have known
[1:02:03] it but all of a sudden the time comes
[1:02:05] for their Awakening the Holy Spirit
[1:02:08] strikes the seed and the Waters of Life
[1:02:11] begin to flow over it it begins to
[1:02:13] germinate and wake up and become its
[1:02:15] true self of who it should be amen
[1:02:18] praise the name of the Lord yes sir
[1:02:21] notice the Ephesian Church age the word
[1:02:24] of God is forever settled in heaven
[1:02:27] before one Speck of Stardust was made
[1:02:32] that word amen was there as it is
[1:02:36] written exactly in our Bible amen it was
[1:02:40] already there praise God I believe that
[1:02:44] praise God forever more the word of God
[1:02:46] is settled forever in heaven and it was
[1:02:50] already there praise God forever more
[1:02:54] Hallelujah yes yes sir now we we'll go
[1:02:58] over to the Smyrna Church
[1:03:05] age
[1:03:06] Hallelujah now what I want to bring to
[1:03:10] you here you'll see here in this quote
[1:03:14] now back
[1:03:16] then before there was ever a spec of
[1:03:20] Stardust before God was God for God is
[1:03:24] an object of washing
[1:03:26] and there was nobody to worship him
[1:03:29] that's we talking about before he even
[1:03:31] made Angels or anything he was there
[1:03:35] alone and there was nothing to worship
[1:03:38] him so he was not even God or known as
[1:03:43] God as yet until he made a creation that
[1:03:47] could worship him then he would be
[1:03:50] acknowledged and known as God right oh
[1:03:55] now so he was at the time only
[1:03:58] potentially God and he was known only as
[1:04:02] the eternal spirit the bride
[1:04:07] was already in his
[1:04:11] mind amen we were already in his mind
[1:04:16] way back in the eternities we were in
[1:04:19] his mind we were in his thoughts for he
[1:04:23] is the Eternal God and before he made
[1:04:25] any anything we were in his mind
[1:04:29] hallelujah amen yes she was there she
[1:04:34] was existing in his thoughts and what
[1:04:36] about those thoughts of God they are
[1:04:39] Eternal are they not hallelujah praise
[1:04:43] God forever more they're Eternal yes sir
[1:04:46] oh isn't that wonderful Proverbs chapter

[1:05:13] love me to inherit substance and I will

[1:05:18] Treasures the Lord now this begins to
[1:05:23] speak of Jesus Christ
[1:05:26] and also it's speaking of you and I the
[1:05:31] Lord possessed me in the beginning of
[1:05:34] his
[1:05:35] ways before his works of old before he

[1:05:43] you the Lord already owned you he

[1:15:06] Bible tells you there there were
[1:15:08] shouting and singing in the presence of
[1:15:11] almighty God and praising him and
[1:15:14] glorifying him amen oh and that same
[1:15:18] religion comes back in the Book of

[1:19:30] knowledge he cannot add to his knowledge
[1:19:34] then he is not omnicient praise the name
[1:19:36] of the Lord the best we could say is
[1:19:39] that some sometimes he will be but that
[1:19:42] is not scriptural he is omnicient he has
[1:19:46] never had a new thought about anything
[1:19:50] because all his thoughts he has always
[1:19:54] had
[1:19:55] you understand Hallelujah God has always
[1:19:59] had his original thoughts in him and no
[1:20:04] other new thought is going to be added

[1:20:10] oh what's that old song I love I used to
[1:20:13] sing back in Pentecost there's a new
[1:20:15] name written down in glory and it's mine
[1:20:19] thank God it's mine there is no new name
[1:20:22] written down in glory
[1:20:24] it was not written there it will never
[1:20:27] be there we sang the old sanki songs
[1:20:30] that used to say is my name written
[1:20:34] there on the page white and fair in the
[1:20:38] book of thy kingdom is my name written
[1:20:44] there and the old the other church that
[1:20:46] was opposing to that particular Church
[1:20:49] they sang back a song no not one
[1:20:59] no not
[1:21:02] one well you see we find now they all
[1:21:06] come down Through the Ages they each had
[1:21:10] a level of revelation that was right but
[1:21:13] other things that were not right and
[1:21:16] they didn't understand us
[1:21:18] yet until the word has come to its
[1:21:21] perfection in this day with the opening
[1:21:24] of the the seven seal with the sounding
[1:21:26] of the seven Thunders the breaking of
[1:21:29] the word he who WS the Key of David I
[1:21:33] open and no man shut and when I shut no
[1:21:37] man opens and the key of God's word is
[1:21:41] the holy spirit has come to open up the
[1:21:44] word and no Theologian can open up your
[1:21:48] understanding by by theological teaching
[1:21:52] by all the Sciences of theology they
[1:21:55] can't do it my God like friends I spent
[1:21:59] three years and there at the end of it
[1:22:02] when the spirit began to break the word
[1:22:04] I began to ask questions and that man
[1:22:07] bowed his head in tears but not tears of
[1:22:11] repentance or tears of sorrow but tears
[1:22:14] of anger if you could tear me limb from
[1:22:17] limb and then wrote me and wrote give me
[1:22:20] that letter and said don't come back
[1:22:22] don't bother coming back you were asking
[1:22:24] too many hard questions and hard saying
[1:22:27] like that but what is it I said but is
[1:22:29] it the word is it in the Bible Well it's
[1:22:31] in the Bible but it's different from our
[1:22:34] faith I say well thank you very much
[1:22:36] it's different from your faith that's
[1:22:38] all I need to know but in the word the
[1:22:40] word says it all it's right here in your
[1:22:43] Bible it's thus sayeth the Lord it's in
[1:22:46] the word of the Living God hallelujah
[1:22:50] amen yes sir that's the truth yes sir he
[1:22:54] is is omnicient now those thoughts of
[1:22:58] God are
[1:23:00] Eternal they are real praise the Lord
[1:23:04] God I thank God for that that God's
[1:23:07] thoughts were not like man's thoughts
[1:23:09] they're just like you can think
[1:23:11] something now you forget the next day
[1:23:12] and then it's not a reality to you
[1:23:14] anymore but God's thoughts are real he
[1:23:18] sees them from beginning to end in other
[1:23:20] words he saw he had you there as a
[1:23:22] thought but he also know you like we
[1:23:25] knew Jeremiah I know you before you were
[1:23:28] even in your mother's womb I I don't
[1:23:31] only know you as a thought back there I
[1:23:33] even saw you right through your whole
[1:23:35] life that you're supposed to be a
[1:23:37] prophet you're supposed to do this
[1:23:38] you're supposed to do that the steps of
[1:23:41] a righteous man is Ed ordained of the
[1:23:45] Lord God knows our lives he knows the
[1:23:48] path of life for every one of us and the
[1:23:51] spirit of Christ is here to lead us and
[1:23:54] guide us right into our path of life
[1:23:57] that we might walk with him and talk
[1:23:58] with him have fellowship with him you
[1:24:01] can read some of these quotes I would't
[1:24:03] read them all here amen praise God but
[1:24:06] we understand that this God is a mighty
[1:24:09] God and he wanted to display himself to
[1:24:12] us and for us to recognize him for who
[1:24:15] he is and also to recognize ourselves
[1:24:19] for who we are amen now at the ending of
[1:24:24] that quotation listen what it
[1:24:26] says Adam gives you the
[1:24:30] idea about the thoughts that was in his
[1:24:33] mind and the thought was eternal and had
[1:24:36] to be expressed so when Adam was formed
[1:24:39] of the Dust of the earth and a spiritual
[1:24:44] being created by God then Adam
[1:24:49] became God's thought expressed those
[1:24:54] Eternal thoughts were now manifested
[1:24:59] manifested where in flesh now you can
[1:25:01] see them but being in flesh doesn't mean
[1:25:05] they were not there before they manifest
[1:25:09] to your
[1:25:10] senses and your being an eternal child
[1:25:14] of God did not begin when you the day
[1:25:18] you were born and you become manifest in
[1:25:21] flesh you always was with God for you
[1:25:26] and him are one you are not God but you
[1:25:30] are part of him because he is your
[1:25:34] father and you have his image stamped
[1:25:36] within your heart that your nature and
[1:25:39] your your entire being is growing in His
[1:25:44] image that you might walk in his light
[1:25:47] and in his life amen praise God now God
[1:25:51] saw the real Adam and he saw ra you and
[1:25:55] me when he said uh let us make
[1:25:59] man let us make man now that's not a
[1:26:02] thing brother but praise the Lord let us
[1:26:05] make man of course we know that's not
[1:26:08] the trinitarians want to take that and
[1:26:10] twist it to say that was was three Gods
[1:26:13] talking to themselves and and saying let
[1:26:15] us make man but it's simple though we
[1:26:19] understand it the bride was already with
[1:26:21] him he's talking with his wife they're
[1:26:23] having a conversation let us make man
[1:26:25] and let's make body for ourselves he
[1:26:28] make one name Jesus Christ and the other
[1:26:31] one the other one is a many membered
[1:26:32] body the other way praise God but then
[1:26:35] we see it manifested now you know so
[1:26:38] many things passing through my thoughts
[1:26:40] right now I'm just picking here and
[1:26:41] grabbing there so if I seem that's why I
[1:26:44] said if I seem like I'm scrambling you
[1:26:46] make some sense out of
[1:26:49] it amen you know the TR word of God is
[1:26:52] truly Rich amen amen amen and it don't
[1:26:55] become rich by study oh I studied for 40
[1:27:00] hours oh I fasted all week I fasted
[1:27:03] three days that's good if God tell you
[1:27:06] to do it but that's not what gives you
[1:27:09] it it just puts you in a condition to
[1:27:12] receive it that's all it does it puts
[1:27:14] you in a condition that you might
[1:27:16] receive something from the presence of
[1:27:19] the Living God now we coming back to it
[1:27:21] so we see God let said let us make man
[1:27:25] amen and when he said let us make man
[1:27:28] I'm making this short now we end up now
[1:27:31] in a flesh body right and we would have
[1:27:35] been in that flesh body with no
[1:27:38] interruptions no problem that's where
[1:27:40] Satan's sin and
[1:27:43] suffering tests trials tribulation comes
[1:27:47] into view Satan interrupted God's
[1:27:50] program right interrupted God's program
[1:27:54] he can't destroy those supernatural
[1:27:57] beings that God sent here down Through
[1:27:59] the Ages but he can make hell for them
[1:28:02] on Earth make their life like
[1:28:05] hell and that tells them when the devil
[1:28:08] is so interested in you that he's bring
[1:28:10] so much trouble you know that there's
[1:28:12] something living in you that he hates
[1:28:15] there's something living in you that he
[1:28:17] hates he can't stand it amen and it's
[1:28:20] God that's living in you even though you
[1:28:22] don't know it for let me tell you rep
[1:28:25] you see gifts and callings are without
[1:28:29] repentance before the person even repent
[1:28:33] or become a Believer or a Christian they
[1:28:37] realize there is something going on in
[1:28:39] their life but they can't explain it
[1:28:40] they don't know what it is but it's they
[1:28:42] don't really until the word begins to
[1:28:44] open it's God was working on us all the
[1:28:48] time amen God working in our hearts in
[1:28:52] our lives all the time
[1:28:54] Jesus SC went to the scripture and he
[1:28:56] said in my father's
[1:28:59] house many
[1:29:02] mansions if it were not so I would have
[1:29:04] told you amen my father's house God
[1:29:08] himself being the house and inside of
[1:29:11] that house you end up having many small
[1:29:15] rooms and you say Mansions you know you
[1:29:18] are a mansion you are a house you your
[1:29:21] body is a house you see so in my
[1:29:25] father's house there were many
[1:29:27] mansions amen in Christ we were all in
[1:29:32] him we're all in him and in Christ
[1:29:35] there's a whole lot of True Believers in
[1:29:39] Christ not the man back there but that
[1:29:41] spirit of God Eternal being that was in
[1:29:45] him this great Eternal Elohim we were
[1:29:49] all in him praise God we just expressed
[1:29:53] as human beings in this flesh aliens
[1:29:56] strangers this world is not our home
[1:29:59] we're just a passing through we're
[1:30:02] passing through and we're going back
[1:30:03] where we come from oh praise be to God
[1:30:06] forever more Hallelujah yes sir amen
[1:30:10] certainly that's the word of God many
[1:30:13] mansions many bodies many temples amen
[1:30:18] praise the name of the Lord God you see
[1:30:21] God was already seeing himself as
[1:30:23] becoming
[1:30:24] material as becoming material and making
[1:30:28] a body coming into a body that's what
[1:30:31] they don't understand that Jesus Christ
[1:30:35] and God the father is not two different
[1:30:38] beings for the God the Father the
[1:30:42] eternal
[1:30:44] spirit created a body for himself is
[1:30:49] that right and he did that using a
[1:30:53] vessel called
[1:30:55] Mary that is why she could not have any
[1:31:00] association with a natural
[1:31:03] man because God himself sent an angel to
[1:31:07] speak the word and said You shall bear a
[1:31:10] son that word was God's germ God's seed
[1:31:16] God's life that was planted in her womb
[1:31:20] by the spoken word of God
[1:31:24] and that word that word came to life so
[1:31:29] Jesus Christ was brought to life not by
[1:31:32] the hand of the instrumentality of a man
[1:31:35] but by the word of God that's why he was
[1:31:38] pure holy sinless Untouchable praise God
[1:31:42] he said you find no fault in me you
[1:31:45] can't find any he was a lamb without
[1:31:47] spot and without blemish oh praise God
[1:31:51] he Perfection of all Perfections for God
[1:31:53] God was in Christ reconciling the world
[1:31:57] to somebody else
[1:31:59] himself God was reconciling the world
[1:32:02] himself praise God forever more thank
[1:32:05] you Lord hallelujah amen God the word
[1:32:11] was multiplying
[1:32:13] himself you know all those scriptures
[1:32:16] where Jesus said don't you understand
[1:32:18] the son of man must fall in the ground
[1:32:20] so that I can come back up and be
[1:32:22] multiplied thousandfold and so many fold
[1:32:26] it was God trying to tell you this is
[1:32:28] the way I'm I'm using this way to
[1:32:30] multiply myself praise God let me repeat
[1:32:34] here again this is not saying that you
[1:32:37] are you are
[1:32:38] God we are just little pieces of him
[1:32:43] Jesus himself said you are common g o DS
[1:32:47] you are common gods in other words you
[1:32:50] love all the all the traits the family
[1:32:54] traits the family actions you'll have it
[1:32:56] all in you because you can't help it
[1:32:58] because he lives in you amen praise God
[1:33:01] hallelujah just said that in passing at
[1:33:04] that time praise God so God typed this
[1:33:07] all in Adam before Adam was even
[1:33:10] flesh t a little bit on this before
[1:33:14] while Adam was yet a spirit being
[1:33:17] Genesis I believe that's uh uh one or
[1:33:21] two somewhere in Genesis uh you'll find
[1:33:24] that I don't have that here praise God
[1:33:27] somewhere I left it home but anyway we
[1:33:31] find out God's God created Adam and he
[1:33:34] told Adam uh I want you to go multiply
[1:33:38] reproduce multiply replenish the Earth
[1:33:42] but then we find out that Adam was still
[1:33:45] only a spirit man he didn't have a body
[1:33:48] as yet to do any of those things that is
[1:33:52] why you will go and see if this mentions
[1:33:54] a second time in Genesis 2 and God
[1:33:58] created man from the dust of the earth
[1:34:01] now this is the physical body now for
[1:34:03] that Spirit man to come and live in
[1:34:06] right see and that was made because he
[1:34:08] couldn't till the soil as a spirit being
[1:34:10] he couldn't do all those things so so
[1:34:13] then this body was made he could come
[1:34:15] living living that body praise God and
[1:34:18] when Adam came and lived in that body
[1:34:22] Adam came with his wife already in
[1:34:25] him right so really God is displaying to
[1:34:30] us his plan of what he done what he did
[1:34:35] amen that's how he chose to display it
[1:34:38] so that Adam's wife was in him right and
[1:34:43] when the time was he says Adam he says
[1:34:46] it's not good for a man to be alone he's
[1:34:49] telling you that he was there in the
[1:34:51] eternity all by himself alone and just
[1:34:53] dealing with his thoughts and so just
[1:34:56] like Adam's wife could not be a goat a
[1:35:00] horse a donkey a monkey a pirate it has
[1:35:04] to be a being on the same level as he is
[1:35:08] is that right so God took Adam took Eve
[1:35:13] from out of Adam's side she was not made
[1:35:17] with some other element or some other
[1:35:19] part but she and him were one
[1:35:24] and Jesus said I and my father are one
[1:35:28] and when you realize you are part of
[1:35:30] that eternal spirit I'm just a little
[1:35:33] part of that eternal spirit has shown on
[1:35:36] the day of Pentecost with the little
[1:35:37] pillars of Fire coming upon them there
[1:35:40] NE none of them are the original big
[1:35:43] Pillar of Fire that is the whole big
[1:35:45] house but each one had a little flame of
[1:35:48] that pillar fire in them praise God oh
[1:35:51] my and they can say I and my father are
[1:35:56] one I and my father are one I'm just
[1:36:00] Eternal as my father is eternal amen I
[1:36:04] walk with him I talk with him praise God
[1:36:06] and I commune with him I pray I
[1:36:10] fellowship and I talk with him in the
[1:36:13] quietness praise the name of the Lord oh
[1:36:15] blessed quietness blessed quietness
[1:36:18] praise God so here was Adam's wife in
[1:36:22] him
[1:36:23] and then with his wife in him he says
[1:36:26] now multiply Yourself Praise the Lord
[1:36:29] hallelujah praise God isn't don't we
[1:36:32] serve a wonderful God Amen Hallelujah
[1:36:36] I'm talking to you I'm watching the
[1:36:38] clock but at the same time I'm trying to
[1:36:40] get as much as I can out to you before I
[1:36:44] step down here praise the name of the
[1:36:46] Lord amen hallelujah yes sir Genesis 1:
[1:36:51] 26-28 that's where you're going to read
[1:36:53] where Adam was just a spirit being right
[1:36:58] Genesis
[1:36:59] 2:7 verse 7 and verse1 15 you find that
[1:37:03] that's where God created him with a
[1:37:05] physical body for him to live in so he
[1:37:08] could tell the soil and also he could
[1:37:12] multiply himself praise the Lord
[1:37:15] hallelujah praise God you believe what
[1:37:18] you're hearing so
[1:37:20] far I I go too far out on the world and
[1:37:24] you're going to start maybe thinking
[1:37:26] you're losing your mind because uh
[1:37:29] theologians have been telling us all
[1:37:31] kinds of things from the scriptures for
[1:37:32] so long and here you come with all this
[1:37:34] stuff you know where you getting this
[1:37:36] from then we said well um I'm getting it
[1:37:39] from by Revelation from the holy spirit
[1:37:42] because God sent a prophet seven sent a
[1:37:44] seventh angel to open up the word of God
[1:37:48] and but that word of God was just a um
[1:37:51] like you're going for a swim and what
[1:37:53] you call that board that you jump off of
[1:37:57] um springing spring board it it's just
[1:38:00] like a spring board that's what the
[1:38:03] prophet's message has been a springboard
[1:38:06] it's just like the mother Eagle kicking
[1:38:08] you out the nest and say okay You' seen
[1:38:10] all these things but you better go out
[1:38:12] there and do your own
[1:38:14] flying I can't fly for you anymore you
[1:38:16] got to fly for
[1:38:18] yourself praise God and you're going to
[1:38:20] experience everything I experience but
[1:38:22] you got to fly for your yourself you
[1:38:24] can't live off of my experience you got
[1:38:26] to get your own by going out there and
[1:38:28] flying yourself amen praise the name of
[1:38:31] the Lord God hallelujah amen yes sir how
[1:38:35] wonderful to know amen now first John
[1:38:40] the first chapter praise God forever
[1:38:42] more it's written now in the beginning
[1:38:46] was the
[1:38:47] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:38:50] Word was God and all of the word was
[1:38:55] made
[1:38:56] flesh all wasn't made Flesh on the same
[1:38:59] day but down Through the Ages God knows
[1:39:01] your times God knows the season God
[1:39:05] knows the age you're supposed to come up
[1:39:06] in and they were made flesh but they
[1:39:09] were back there as Spiritual Beings in
[1:39:12] him praise the name of the Lord God of
[1:39:15] course if you don't understand all of
[1:39:16] this go back and listen the message
[1:39:18] again and I'm telling you that it will
[1:39:20] be a real blessing to to your heart amen
[1:39:24] praise God so we find
[1:39:26] out God wanted to reproduce himself he
[1:39:31] want to in other words this is talking
[1:39:33] about the multiplication of the word God
[1:39:37] wanted to multiply the word like I
[1:39:40] mentioned before Jesus talking about the
[1:39:42] seed going in the ground it's all the
[1:39:45] same thing trying to tell you God had
[1:39:47] this intent or intention to multiply
[1:39:51] himself praise God Hallelujah and to
[1:39:54] come into material bodies the first body
[1:39:57] that God made that way of course uh was
[1:40:02] Jesus Christ amen and he was God's super
[1:40:07] God's Masterpiece amen and the bride
[1:40:11] coming from him she is his
[1:40:15] Masterpiece amen because she comes from
[1:40:18] him praise the name of the Lord because
[1:40:21] God's bride was in him Adam comes his
[1:40:24] wife was in him Jesus comes his wife was
[1:40:28] in him Adam was put to sleep his wife
[1:40:32] was brought to taken out from him Jesus
[1:40:35] on Calvary he was struck Jehovah struck
[1:40:38] him and there it was his wife was
[1:40:42] brought forth from him praise God
[1:40:45] hallelujah but because you see two
[1:40:47] beings standing there Adam and Eve go
[1:40:51] back the scripture says but he he called
[1:40:54] their name Adam one name and you can
[1:40:58] have a million billion Christians in the
[1:41:00] world and he called their name
[1:41:03] Christians Sons and Daughters who really
[1:41:05] believe the word of God hallelujah
[1:41:08] because God is showing that the wife
[1:41:11] came out of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:41:14] she is has been being made manifest
[1:41:18] Through The Seven Ages of the church
[1:41:23] through the seven edges of the church
[1:41:25] all the way from Paul 64 ad right on
[1:41:29] down to this time it went into the
[1:41:31] ground in the Dark Ages and through the
[1:41:33] ministry of Martin Luther amen God
[1:41:36] raised it up in a
[1:41:38] Reformation bringing the church to a
[1:41:41] rebirth amen and it started coming up in
[1:41:44] uh Luther amen Wesley then it came to
[1:41:48] Pentecost none of them had the fullness
[1:41:51] of the word as yet they had the word but
[1:41:54] not the fullness of the understanding of
[1:41:57] the word and God counted it
[1:41:59] righteousness and blessed them and use
[1:42:02] them for his glory and for his honor
[1:42:04] praise God but now the Sun is up the
[1:42:08] light is shining arise and shine amen
[1:42:12] people that sat in denominational
[1:42:14] Darkness have seen a great light and
[1:42:17] upon them the light of the world has
[1:42:19] sprung up and it's shining upon them to
[1:42:21] do what to wake up the seeds that were
[1:42:24] buried under the
[1:42:26] ground to bring them to life again
[1:42:30] praise God to bring them to a place
[1:42:33] where they can recognize that they are
[1:42:35] not just flesh and blood but they are
[1:42:38] Spirit beings Sons and Daughters of the
[1:42:41] most high eternity dwells within the
[1:42:45] eternal life is a gift of God you can't
[1:42:48] work it up you can't bring it down you

[1:42:53] can't study your way into it you can't
[1:42:56] pray your way into it you can't do
[1:42:58] nothing of yourself it is a perfect gift
[1:43:02] of God it's by grace and grace alone
[1:43:07] hallelujah
[1:43:10] hallelujah amen praise God hallelujah
[1:43:14] God help me I haven't touched my even
[1:43:16] touched my real

[1:43:26] know because you feel a little stiff or
[1:43:28] stretch it's okay it's not going to

[1:43:58] continue all right if you walk with a
[1:44:00] dinner bell or a whistle you know when
[1:44:02] to
[1:44:07] whistle all
[1:44:10] right now in the beginning was the word
[1:44:13] and the Word was made flesh this is from
[1:44:15] the future home of the Heavenly
[1:44:17] bride in the beginning was the word and

[1:44:26] attribute force that was in God Amen in
[1:44:30] other words are
[1:44:33] thought he thought of himself as being
[1:44:38] human and that transmitted him down to
[1:44:42] be

[1:44:46] word and
[1:44:48] morphe he began to and morphe himself uh
[1:44:53] down to Being Human changing by degrees

[1:45:04] transmitted him down to Jesus amen now

[1:47:45] God and all the father has given me
[1:47:48] welcome praise God because you was in
[1:47:51] him his ch chosen ones Beyond those
[1:47:54] Gates oh my God is worth everything
[1:47:58] praise God because the chosen ones will

[1:48:04] him just like Isaac just like Jacob they
[1:48:09] were in him praise God hallelujah now
[1:48:13] I'm going to stop here now because this
[1:48:15] will take me into my uh the rest of the
[1:48:18] subject and that's going to be another
[1:48:19] two hours so um if you're okay and you
[1:48:22] want spend the other two hours is okay
[1:48:25] but I wouldn't bring you under that
[1:48:27] pressure Modern Life modern society
[1:48:30] modern actions people try to make us
[1:48:32] like we were the oldtime Saints but we
[1:48:35] come in a different age even our flesh
[1:48:37] Constitution is different because of the
[1:48:39] things we eat the clothes we wear and
[1:48:41] the things we do we we we don't have
[1:48:43] that toughness like they had well we try
[1:48:46] to be but we we just the human flesh
[1:48:49] through the meats the food the
[1:48:51] preservatives this that that is broken
[1:48:53] us to this point where we can only have
[1:48:55] such length of life amen I I I heard of
[1:48:58] a man that lived
[1:49:00] for 140 years in the West
[1:49:04] Indies over in Jamaica and the same week
[1:49:08] I met another man who was telling me of
[1:49:10] his uncle in Trinidad that died at
[1:49:14] 129 so you see there are some of those
[1:49:19] um physical traits still there where a
[1:49:21] man could live maybe a thousand
[1:49:23] years but that's long gone because the
[1:49:26] whole world is polluted now and
[1:49:28] everything has changed and we are here
[1:49:31] holding to God's unchanging hand I was
[1:49:35] just about to get into uh T Isaac and uh
[1:49:40] Joseph right into this and begin to
[1:49:43] bring the rest of the word but we'll
[1:49:45] talk about that another time by his
[1:49:48] grace praise the name of the Lord I

[1:50:09] just a little bit of worship before
[1:50:12] service to get the hearts prepared the
[1:50:15] real worship should come after the
