[0:14] praise the lord it is indeed a joy being
[0:17] here with you
[0:19] on this wonderful night
[0:22] to think about the things of god
[0:25] and as the scripture tells us
[0:28] we should place our minds on heavenly
[0:31] things
[0:32] things of the lord
[0:34] and not so much
[0:36] upon things that are upon this earth
[0:40] welcome
[0:41] and the lord bless us together as we
[0:44] gather in his name to bring glory and
[0:48] honor to him
[0:49] praise the lord
[0:51] well
[0:52] i shall be reading from the
[0:55] book of
[0:56] revelation
[0:58] chapter 1
[1:00] and then i will go over and read
[1:04] a verse from chapter 3 of the book of
[1:09] revelation
[1:12] and i will be
[1:14] speaking on the subject of
[1:17] introducing the last church age
[1:21] and that is what i will be dealing with
[1:24] tonight
[1:26] introducing to you the last church age
[1:32] in revelation
[1:34] chapter 1
[1:38] reading
[1:40] from
[1:41] verse
[1:43] 12
[1:45] john said
[1:47] and i turned to see the voice
[1:51] that spake with me
[1:54] and being turned
[1:56] i saw seven golden candlesticks
[2:01] and in the midst of the golden
[2:04] candlesticks
[2:07] one like
[2:10] unto the son of man
[2:14] clothed with a garment
[2:18] down to the foot
[2:20] and girt about
[2:22] the paps
[2:24] with
[2:24] a golden girdle
[2:29] his head and his ears were white like
[2:31] wool
[2:33] as white as snow
[2:37] and his eyes
[2:39] were as a flame of fire
[2:42] and his feet
[2:44] like unto fine brass
[2:47] as if they burned in a furnace
[2:51] and his voice
[2:53] as the sound of many waters
[2:57] and he that
[2:59] had in his right hand
[3:02] and he had in his right hand
[3:05] seven stars
[3:08] and out of his mouth
[3:10] went a sharp to edge its sword
[3:15] and his
[3:16] countenance was as the sun
[3:20] shinet
[3:22] in his strength
[3:24] and when i saw him
[3:27] i fell at his feet dead
[3:30] and he
[3:31] laid his right hand upon me saying unto
[3:34] me
[3:35] fear not
[3:36] i am the first and the last
[3:40] amen
[3:42] now in
[3:43] chapter
[3:45] of
[3:46] this
[3:47] marvelous book of revelation
[3:50] the first part of verse 14 reads thus
[3:56] and unto the angel
[3:59] of the church of the laodiceans
[4:02] right
[4:04] these things saith the amen
[4:09] the faithful
[4:11] and
[4:12] true
[4:13] witness
[4:15] the beginning
[4:17] of the creation
[4:19] of god
[4:21] amen
[4:24] let us pray
[4:26] our righteous
[4:28] father
[4:30] our loving father
[4:32] we thank you for this marvelous
[4:35] privilege
[4:36] and now we will we ask your
[4:39] divine
[4:41] blessing
[4:42] upon these
[4:45] wonderful ripples of truth
[4:49] may they
[4:50] spread out
[4:52] across the land
[4:54] may they reach the elected
[4:57] wherever they are
[5:00] he or she or
[5:02] or young men young women
[5:05] whoever they are may the spirit
[5:08] or of the living god
[5:11] reach them father
[5:13] you said not one
[5:15] will be left behind
[5:18] all
[5:19] lamb of god
[5:21] oh by the sprinkling of the blood of
[5:24] christ
[5:25] may this word drop
[5:28] upon whomsoever thou wilt for we ask it
[5:32] in the name of jesus christ
[5:34] who died for our sins arose again for
[5:37] our justification coming again for lord
[5:41] god for our glorification
[5:43] through rapturing grace
[5:45] in the name of jesus christ our lord
[5:48] amen
[5:50] and amen
[5:53] here in revelation chapter 1
[5:58] we are seeing a glorious
[6:01] wonderful picture
[6:04] as john himself saw him
[6:09] walking
[6:10] up and down
[6:12] amongst the
[6:14] seven golden candlesticks
[6:19] and while he was walking
[6:21] amongst those candlesticks
[6:24] in his right hand
[6:27] were seven stars
[6:30] oh praise god hallelujah
[6:35] now of course seven candlesticks
[6:38] as the seven candlesticks that were in
[6:41] the old temple
[6:43] in
[6:44] uh amongst the
[6:47] israelites
[6:49] they find out that these seven
[6:52] candlesticks
[6:54] uh represent
[6:57] the
[6:58] seven
[6:59] church ages or the seven churches
[7:05] that were in asia
[7:09] symbolic
[7:10] and representative
[7:12] of the seven
[7:14] ages that were to come
[7:19] we will speak more on that
[7:23] the seven stars
[7:25] in his right hand
[7:29] were also
[7:31] represented representative
[7:34] of his preeminence
[7:37] and power
[7:40] over these
[7:41] seven stars
[7:44] which represented
[7:46] this seven messengers
[7:49] and of course an angel
[7:52] is a messenger
[7:54] so the seven angels
[7:58] to the seven church ages
[8:02] is what these seven stars in his hand
[8:07] his control his power
[8:10] is representative
[8:12] of
[8:14] now in our studies
[8:17] over the past year
[8:20] uh we have been blessed together
[8:24] to
[8:25] walk with
[8:27] him
[8:28] as john did
[8:30] spiritually we walk with him
[8:34] amongst these seven churches
[8:38] seven church ages
[8:41] we talked about the set the messengers
[8:45] we
[8:46] describe them each one
[8:49] replace them
[8:51] positionally
[8:53] in time and in the word of god
[8:56] we
[8:57] studied
[9:00] their portion
[9:02] of the word they were chosen
[9:04] to
[9:05] represent and to highlight
[9:09] to our hearts
[9:11] by the
[9:12] presence of the holy spirit
[9:14] upon their lives
[9:16] working through them
[9:18] using them for his glory
[9:22] and now after our
[9:25] journey
[9:27] coming to the ending
[9:29] of our journey
[9:31] in this glorious feast
[9:34] of the word of god
[9:37] we have come down now to the last church
[9:41] age
[9:42] better known
[9:44] as the
[9:45] laodicean church age
[9:48] as found in revelation chapter 3
[9:53] amen
[9:54] and there in this last church age
[9:58] hallelujah
[10:00] the last day
[10:03] of the
[10:04] week
[10:06] spiritual week
[10:08] we've come to the last day of this
[10:10] spiritual week just as much as in john
[10:15] chapter
[10:16] 7
[10:18] when the bible tells us
[10:21] when it came to the
[10:23] that great day now
[10:25] coming down to the last day
[10:29] it they
[10:30] feast but the last day of the week
[10:35] was the seventh day
[10:37] and at the ending of that seventh day
[10:41] beginning of the first day
[10:43] he lifted up his voice
[10:46] roaring like a lion
[10:49] speak seventh thunders
[10:52] blasting forth
[10:54] out of his mouth praise god
[10:58] and there my friends
[11:01] he's walking up and down
[11:03] the churches
[11:05] this great shepherd of the sheepfold
[11:09] with tender love and care
[11:13] walking up and down shining the light
[11:17] shining the light
[11:19] from these seven stars
[11:22] back into the church ages
[11:26] and now in this
[11:29] seven day week just before
[11:32] the eighth day
[11:34] comes the
[11:36] seventh messenger
[11:38] or last messenger
[11:41] of the age
[11:43] oh praise god
[11:45] and this study of course
[11:48] is just a broad outline
[11:51] or introduction
[11:53] to the last church age better known to
[11:57] us
[11:58] as the laodicean
[12:00] church age
[12:03] now
[12:04] of course laodicea means
[12:07] is a
[12:08] is a woman's name
[12:10] laodicea
[12:12] is a woman's
[12:14] name
[12:16] and
[12:17] leotisia itself
[12:19] means
[12:20] people's
[12:21] rights
[12:23] people's rights
[12:26] now let us talk about the
[12:29] characteristics
[12:31] of this
[12:33] church
[12:37] which will be
[12:38] and is
[12:39] in the seventh church age
[12:42] and the reason why we will
[12:45] or we must study
[12:47] the characteristics
[12:50] of the age
[12:52] is to understand what type of
[12:55] spirit
[12:56] what type of
[12:58] motivations actions
[13:01] are moving the people
[13:04] moving the church world
[13:06] and causing things to happen
[13:09] right
[13:10] because that
[13:12] church of leodisia that was back there
[13:17] was representative
[13:19] of the church age
[13:21] physically in which we lived now
[13:25] and therefore
[13:27] we
[13:28] will study
[13:30] the church age that was
[13:32] back there
[13:34] that we might
[13:36] have an understanding of what
[13:40] is happening here
[13:42] what is going to happen here
[13:45] right on
[13:46] out to fading out
[13:50] into the eternity
[13:53] for the la for the mighty angel cried
[13:57] one foot on the land one on the sea
[14:01] lifted up his hands towards heaven
[14:04] one with the open book
[14:06] crying with a mighty voice
[14:10] time shall be no more
[14:13] oh yes
[14:14] time for these ages
[14:18] have run out
[14:20] that is not saying
[14:22] all time for all universes all
[14:27] all planets
[14:28] is over but that time for the church age
[14:34] is over
[14:36] that is what
[14:38] we will be looking into all of these
[14:41] things
[14:42] as we consider
[14:44] laodicea
[14:45] the last church age
[14:50] we
[14:51] as we have said
[14:53] it is important
[14:55] for us to know
[14:57] the characteristics
[15:00] of the laodicean church age
[15:03] that was back there
[15:06] that we might understand
[15:09] the characteristics
[15:11] of our
[15:13] age as far as the world
[15:17] the world system
[15:19] the religious systems
[15:22] that we must
[15:24] survive and live in
[15:27] and that we may understand them how to
[15:30] walk
[15:31] this road
[15:33] that lies ahead before us
[15:37] now you'll say to me brother simon
[15:40] what what what are these characteristics
[15:44] of the
[15:45] leducian church age of which you have
[15:49] just told us
[15:52] now
[15:53] first of all
[15:55] we will find as we explore god's word
[16:00] that the laodicean church age
[16:03] is an age
[16:05] where
[16:06] it is predicted
[16:09] an age of women's rights
[16:14] women
[16:15] will rise up
[16:17] in great power
[16:19] an age
[16:20] where women will will be of great
[16:24] influence
[16:26] we will expand on these things later
[16:30] but i want you to recognize that
[16:33] pick that within your heart
[16:37] that this is a woman's age
[16:41] this is a woman's time
[16:44] a time of
[16:46] woman power
[16:48] female power female control
[16:51] female domination
[16:53] yes
[16:55] women
[16:56] are rising into power
[16:58] and there's nothing they can do to stop
[17:01] this
[17:02] for it is within the boundaries
[17:06] of god's word
[17:10] it is also
[17:12] a time
[17:14] of
[17:15] universal religion
[17:19] where we find
[17:21] that there is
[17:23] there will be and there is
[17:26] a push
[17:28] and a trend
[17:29] towards having
[17:31] universal religion
[17:35] everywhere
[17:38] there is a desire
[17:40] the hunger
[17:42] you see when one
[17:44] like that satan creates chaos
[17:49] then he creates the hunger it makes
[17:54] humans have the hunger
[17:56] for
[17:57] for seeing eye to eye
[17:59] finding unity somewhere
[18:02] uh
[18:03] finding common ground
[18:06] and thus we
[18:07] we now have a drive
[18:10] we have the push
[18:12] or urge towards having one
[18:16] universal
[18:18] religion
[18:19] whereby rulers kings governors
[18:23] presidents
[18:24] will no longer have to deal with uh
[18:28] thousands of disparate groups but
[18:32] one
[18:33] main religion
[18:35] making it simpler
[18:37] simpler to control simpler to discuss
[18:41] and
[18:42] speak with simpler to finance and so on
[18:46] but here it is we will speak on that
[18:50] during this talk
[18:52] on laodicea the last church age
[18:56] in our bible
[19:00] also
[19:02] ledecia
[19:04] is found to be
[19:06] an age of unions
[19:11] uniting time
[19:12] for the church of the living god
[19:16] uniting time
[19:18] for satan
[19:20] and his
[19:21] false vine
[19:23] also
[19:25] but naturally speaking it will be an age
[19:30] where there is a cry for union
[19:34] protection
[19:36] oh
[19:37] we see
[19:39] unions have grown in great strength
[19:44] and they will grow even stronger
[19:47] for out of those natural unions let me
[19:50] not go there now but we will we look at
[19:54] it the shadows of this
[19:58] here the hand
[19:59] is
[20:00] raised up
[20:02] the light striking against
[20:05] the hand
[20:06] throws
[20:07] the shadows on the wall
[20:11] we're looking
[20:13] my friends
[20:15] at
[20:16] that coming the shadow becoming reality
[20:19] in our day
[20:21] and in our time
[20:23] in this last age
[20:25] of laodicea an age
[20:29] of unions
[20:31] an age
[20:33] of a uniting
[20:35] time
[20:37] it will also be
[20:41] an age
[20:43] and of a call and a cry
[20:46] or let us use the stir of a demand
[20:50] for civil rights
[20:53] for equal rights
[20:55] all manner of rights
[20:58] there will be this pull this call a
[21:01] drive
[21:02] causing
[21:03] all kinds of uh social
[21:07] uh
[21:08] upheavals
[21:10] turbulence
[21:12] like the
[21:13] great waves
[21:14] of the deep my friends
[21:18] everywhere civil unrest
[21:21] cry for civil rights
[21:24] everyone seeking searching
[21:27] crying for
[21:29] demanding
[21:30] their various rights
[21:32] we will expand on that
[21:36] in the talks to come
[21:38] as we speak on this
[21:41] leo this year
[21:43] the last
[21:45] church age
[21:46] that will bring us to the consummation
[21:50] of all the ages put together
[21:54] be here
[21:55] as i said
[21:57] an age that will be characterized
[22:01] by
[22:03] cry for civil rights
[22:06] will be an age of politics
[22:10] man filled with politics
[22:14] and age filled with politics
[22:18] men experimenting
[22:20] in
[22:21] the laboratories of government
[22:24] to find the perfect means
[22:27] by which to govern civilization
[22:30] these
[22:31] are things we will talk about
[22:35] during our talk here
[22:37] on laodicea
[22:39] the last church age
[22:44] this
[22:46] will be an age
[22:48] of acumenism
[22:52] world council of churches
[22:55] as we have alluded to before
[22:58] that there will be a drive
[23:01] and a push
[23:03] towards having one universal religion
[23:08] and the world
[23:10] does not know what it is
[23:13] but here with ecumenism
[23:16] that religion that faith
[23:19] will be
[23:20] identified
[23:22] for it's already identified in the bible
[23:26] we will talk about these things
[23:28] but the drive the pull
[23:31] push towards ecumenism
[23:34] is seen felt
[23:37] an experience
[23:39] everywhere by those who live
[23:43] and work and move
[23:45] within the religious
[23:48] realm but also
[23:52] as that creates
[23:54] a disturbance
[23:55] in the spiritual realms
[23:58] in the natural realms of earth
[24:02] this last age characterizes
[24:05] the pollution
[24:07] the destabilization
[24:10] so of society of minds of hearts
[24:15] most of all
[24:17] it foretells
[24:20] us
[24:20] of great earthquakes
[24:23] striking
[24:25] the land striking the earth
[24:27] the earth will be struck by
[24:30] great earthquakes
[24:32] oh
[24:33] we will love to speak on these things
[24:38] in the weeks ahead
[24:40] as we talk about
[24:43] this last church age
[24:46] earthquakes
[24:48] you're seeing you're reading you're
[24:50] hearing of them everywhere earthquakes
[24:54] taking place earthquakes under the ocean
[24:58] just a few days ago one took place in
[25:01] the bottom of the sea causing a tsunami
[25:04] to go out to to uh oh
[25:08] kill and destroy and
[25:10] terrify my friends
[25:12] oh this is the age that we live in the
[25:16] last church age
[25:18] time is running out or has run out
[25:22] oh
[25:23] look about it
[25:24] an age of science
[25:27] this age
[25:29] this last age
[25:32] will be and is
[25:34] characterized by great scientific
[25:37] achievements
[25:40] great education
[25:44] man shall run to and fro the bible tells
[25:48] us
[25:50] and knowledge shall increase
[25:53] in the book of
[25:54] daniel aeronautical things
[25:58] will increase
[26:01] travel
[26:02] the speed
[26:04] of light
[26:07] the the desire for men to move
[26:11] everywhere go back and forth it's
[26:13] written in your bible
[26:16] i am proud to say
[26:18] that i am associated with one who knows
[26:21] all things before they even happen
[26:25] for his name is god
[26:27] the lord jesus christ himself who know
[26:31] it knows all things and i'm glad to be a
[26:34] part of his economy
[26:38] this last church age
[26:41] will also and is
[26:44] characterized
[26:46] as an age of materialism
[26:50] and riches
[26:53] everywhere
[26:54] is a cry
[26:56] for success and prosperity
[27:00] when men and women believe
[27:03] once they've
[27:04] made it into those ranks of riches
[27:09] realm
[27:10] of
[27:11] prosperity
[27:13] oh
[27:14] they have arrived at their nirvana they
[27:17] have arrived at their place of of of
[27:22] their dreams they come to the end of
[27:26] their rainbow and they believe they're
[27:29] sitting on top of the world we will
[27:31] speak on these things how men are
[27:35] carried away
[27:37] by this
[27:39] lust for life
[27:40] and this move from rocks to riches
[27:44] oh
[27:45] my friends as we delve into
[27:49] this last age of little dcl we will see
[27:53] these things unfold right before our
[27:57] very eyes
[28:00] it is also
[28:03] prefigured by the living god
[28:06] that this last age of leodisia
[28:11] will be an age of immorality
[28:16] unfaithfulness
[28:19] uncleanness
[28:20] [Music]
[28:22] oh friends
[28:24] you'll find it written in the gospel of
[28:28] luke
[28:30] chapter 17
[28:32] verses 26 to 30.
[28:36] it is right within the word of god
[28:40] as it was
[28:42] in the days of noah
[28:44] the days of lot
[28:46] sodom
[28:48] so shall it be in that day when the son
[28:52] of man is being revealed
[28:56] and so this last age
[28:59] this will be
[29:00] one of the defining
[29:02] characteristics
[29:04] of this age
[29:06] where there'll be more millionaires
[29:08] billionaires trillionaires
[29:11] all
[29:12] materialism riches all these things will
[29:16] be here
[29:18] violence
[29:19] and evil
[29:20] across the land
[29:22] you'll see it everywhere
[29:26] but it will also be characterized
[29:29] to be an age of apostasy
[29:33] or we may say an age of the falling away
[29:39] from the true faith
[29:42] falling away
[29:44] from the word of god
[29:47] reduction
[29:49] in church attendance
[29:51] reduction
[29:52] in any desire
[29:55] for religious knowledge
[29:58] for knowing the god who created and
[30:00] places here
[30:02] it'll die out
[30:04] within the hearts of men
[30:08] and in the church world
[30:09] that hangs on holds on claiming to
[30:13] believe
[30:15] there's coming there there is
[30:17] and there is coming even more
[30:20] of the cold winds
[30:23] called north winds
[30:26] freezing ice
[30:28] of dead formality and religion
[30:32] coming with a fixation
[30:34] upon the people
[30:36] becoming icicles
[30:39] becoming icebergs
[30:41] my friends
[30:42] terrible times are facing us here now
[30:47] upon the face of the earth in this
[30:49] during this last church age
[30:53] you may read in your bible 2nd
[30:55] thessalonians
[30:57] chapter 2
[30:59] verse 3.
[31:01] you may also read revelation 3
[31:06] verse 16
[31:08] speaking of the waves of spiritual
[31:12] indifference
[31:13] that will hit the
[31:16] slam
[31:17] like an asteroid into the face of the
[31:20] earth
[31:21] creating
[31:23] all manner of mayhem
[31:26] and religious destabilization
[31:29] and faith
[31:30] we'll find it everywhere
[31:33] amen
[31:35] yes sir
[31:36] but thanks be to god in this age
[31:40] we find the rebirth
[31:43] and the
[31:44] return of the spirits
[31:48] that were in
[31:50] the time of leodicia
[31:54] those wicked devils
[31:58] that were there from the time
[32:01] of noah
[32:03] accumulated
[32:05] with the same devils that were there in
[32:07] the time of
[32:09] pharaoh
[32:11] where they lost their bodies
[32:14] in the red sea
[32:17] those same devils that came back in the
[32:21] time of nebuchadnezzar
[32:24] and many perished
[32:27] under god's judgment with the
[32:29] handwriting upon the wall
[32:33] the accumulation
[32:36] of all those devils
[32:38] that were there
[32:40] by the rivers of babylon
[32:43] by the river euphrates
[32:45] yes
[32:47] all those
[32:48] wicked demonic spirits
[32:51] working in the church realm
[32:53] have returned
[32:55] all of them
[32:57] accumulated
[32:58] in ancient laodicea
[33:01] and now
[33:03] our adversary the devil has come down
[33:07] amongst us and he knows that his time is
[33:10] short for he is a creature
[33:13] oh and creature had to be made they had
[33:16] to be created and as such he has an end
[33:22] oh my and knowing that his time is short
[33:26] like a condemned murderer
[33:28] he decides now now he he's only have one
[33:32] life so he's going to kill us many and
[33:35] destroy as many and steal as many as he
[33:39] can steal from destroy from because this
[33:43] is the day and the hour when violence
[33:46] and evil are in their upswing at this
[33:49] time for the light is going out
[33:54] and as the light goes out
[33:57] the darkness comes in
[33:59] to rule
[34:02] oh brother sister
[34:05] let us walk
[34:06] with jesus christ
[34:09] that we may have our way of escape that
[34:13] he has planned
[34:14] i am the door
[34:17] you come through him
[34:19] and you'll be able to enter the doorway
[34:22] of escape
[34:24] oh praise god there is no safety zone in
[34:28] the day we are living in
[34:30] the only safety zone we can find is in
[34:34] christ the rock of ages hallelujah oh
[34:39] let us bury ourselves let us hide
[34:42] ourselves in the cleft of the rock oh
[34:46] praise god and jesus is soon to come
[34:50] with joy we welcome his appearing to him
[34:54] or her that hat and here to hear
[34:57] let them hear for the glory of god
[35:01] may the lord richly bless you keep you
[35:05] and bring you again into his divine
[35:08] presence for us to sink on these things
[35:13] in the light of his glorious coming
