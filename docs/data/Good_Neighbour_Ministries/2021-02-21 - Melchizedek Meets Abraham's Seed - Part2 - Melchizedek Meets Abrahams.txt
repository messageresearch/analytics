TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] this wonderful wonderful sermon this sermon is coming to you from good neighbor ministries burlington ontario canada i'm pastor john simon i'm very happy to be here with you and to share the word of god with you once again glory be to his marvelous and wonderful name thank god our subject for today will be melchizedek meets his seed melchizedek meets his seed our text will be will be found in hebrews chapter 7 verses 1 to 4. and it reads us for this melchizedek king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that king of salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the son of god abided a priest continually now consider how great this man was unto whom even abraham gave tenth give the tenth of the spoils praise the lord god hallelujah let us pray our gracious heavenly father how we thank you for the reading of the word o faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word and we rejoice today lord with joy in our hearts knowing that you are have given us your word so that we may develop or unfold the faith which is in us we give you the glory for this service today wherever this this sermon goes this message goes out let my hearts be touched may eyes be opened may lies be changed and most of all may you be glorified for we ask it all in the name of our blessed lord jesus christ amen praise the lord now last week we spoke about the great melchizedek and we discovered that melchizedek was and is actually god himself for it was god himself forming himself coming down from spirit form of being god coming into human flesh but in between spirit form and flesh god went into a state called the theophany a theophany body or a word body a word form body while he was in that theophany he was called mel cassidy back in those days of abraham this man seemed to appear out of nowhere they could not trace his descent as the scriptures that we just read they could not find his beginning they could not find his end they did not know where he came from what was his descent what was his genealogy there was no trace whatsoever for it and they could never find it for that person was god himself forming himself down coming down into flesh so between spirit and coming down he became a theophany then from the theophany god begins to end morphe himself coming into flesh which later when he got into that flesh he was named and called jesus christ jesus christ was really the flesh body or the flesh form of melchizedek which and who of course was god himself for in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself jesus said i and my father are one not two not three not four one amen when you see me you see my father so there was a oneness of god in jesus christ now melchizedek met abraham after his great battle with the five kings and defeated them and came back with the spoils and there melchizedek met him and gave him uh bread and wine and uh abraham in turn gave melchizedek a tenth a tithe or a tenth of whatever he had now we further learned that this was a type of how he would meet with abraham's seed abraham's faith seed that later on down through the ages of time god would once more come again to meet with abraham's fat seed or abraham's children of faith and that promise was made when jesus himself said as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the days when the son of man is being revealed praise god now we are living i believe we are living in those days now we are living in days of of lot the days of sodom sodomy and every evil thing upon the face of the earth and we are under these types of world conditions and he said when these conditions are prevailing upon the earth once again as it was in sodom so shall it be that the son of man would be again revealed revealed to whom this son of man would reveal himself as he did to abraham now he will be doing it to abraham's royal faith seed his generations of faith that has the faith of abraham with them what faith of abraham the same faith abraham had with no written bible no written scriptures nothing on paper no prophet at that time to say anything to him but the bible tells us that abraham heard a voice saying abraham rise up go out get out of your country and go unto the place where i have called you amen praise god and saw abraham now by faith which means he believed the voice he heard which means he had confidence in the voice he heard and the bible says he went out not knowing where he went in other words mentally he did not know where this was leaving him but he knew he could trust that voice that he had heard oh glory to god something spoke to abraham's soul and abraham knew glory to god that he could trust the voice of god that was leading him now if we were to turn in our bibles to genesis chapter 18 we find the story of god coming again to meet with abraham must have been a very hot day the blistering heat of the middle east coming down upon him his tents of his family his servants his herders were all around and abraham sat in his tent door and the bible tells us in the very word of god and the lord appeared unto abraham in the plains of memory and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood before him and when he saw then he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself before toward the ground and said my lord if now i have found favor in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant amen praise the lord now look i want you to see this abraham sees three men coming up the road and when they stood before him abraham of course had some sort of revelation for he recognized that though his natural eyes was seeing three yet his heart revealed to him this was the lord and the bible he did not say my lords read it in your scriptures genesis 18 he says my lord and bow down before him praise god amen but we have the opposite today they look at the at one god and now uh because of the the sin that's upon the human race the shock effects of sin as if a man were to hit you on the head with a with a good piece of stick or or something you'll see stars you see all manner of things and no doubt because of the knock upon the head of the entire human race now when this church world and the church people look at the one god hero israel the lord thy god is one lord and god does not change his mind about his word and so here it is but now when they look at one they see three and they tell you oh it's three in one but the bible doesn't tell you that the bible tells you there's only one god who manifests himself in three to under three titles there may be other titles but the main three titles that are there he manifests himself so let's look to the word of god what god speaks to us now the bible tells us if we're to follow this story that he invited the lord in any true child of abraham will invite the lord into his life and into their homes and for god to change their lifestyle change their home life change the pattern of life that they have within the home the next thing he called upon his wife sarah at that time abraham was a hundred and sarah was i believe 90 or 90 something years old and he called upon her to serve them some meat and bread food for them to eat and to show you god is not a vegetarian because the bible tells us in verse 5 verse 5 i will fetch a morsel of bread comfort in your hearts you shall pass on therefore are you come to your servant and make ready three measures of meal kneaded make cakes upon the earth abraham ran to his herd fetched a calf tender and good and gave it to a young man and he hastened to dress it kill it and prepare it and he took butter and milk and the calf which he addressed and set it before them praise god and god at the cakes at the beef at the but at the butter that was before him hallelujah and drank the milk that abraham gave to him so god was definitely not a vegetarian and harry at these things that were before him and then the great miracle happened for we know this was really melchizedek once again appearing to abraham and now he says to abraham now abraham where is your wife sarah now first of all he tells abraham what is the name of his wife without asking abraham what is her name if if it's god and his god it was god and he already knew her name god is god he knew where she was but he turned to abraham and said where is your wife sarah and abraham said oh she is there in the tent beside me amen hallelujah and then god turned to abraham melchizedek and turned to abraham this time next year your wife sarah shall not maybe might could be your wife sarah shall bear a son amen praise god right now while i'm speaking if there's someone anywhere across the world hearing my voice and you there told you that you're barren they told you you can't have a child that told you that you cannot have any one to one child to love to care oh and to mother then in the name of jesus christ believe the word of god receive a child receive one in the name of the lord and may the great holy spirit bring it to pass amen god said this time next year your wife sarah shall bear a son hallelujah and abraham well lord sarah and i are old and we are stricken in age and and it ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women you see he's telling her she's past childbearing age he's talking to god and telling him oh i'm all and sarah is past shall bearing age and sarah laughed between herself saying after him wax old how shall i have pleasure with my lord being old also amen and the lord said to sarah and she was in the tent behind the lord said to abraham why did sarah laugh and and hearing that sarah came out is there anything too hard for the lord amen the great creator became our savior and that same creator says is there anything too hard for the lord do you have any problem too hard for the lord do you have a situation you believe it's too hard for god you anything in your heart your life you give it to him right now you turn to him and say lord i lift my hands my heart to heaven i ask for your divine help your deliverance i ask you to grant me this thing that i'm asking you now my my husband my wife my child lord god deliver them give them back to me hallelujah glory to god amen oh my let me tell you if you can only believe all things are possible to them that will believe the word of god is anything too hard for the lord at the time appointed i will return unto thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son and sarah denied and laughed of course and said nay but i didn't laugh he said but thou you did laugh amen hallelujah and they rose and turned their face going towards sodom amen that same god once again has given to sarah the promise that she would bear a son you know the story and in her old age when it appeared impossible for her to bear a child sarah brought forth isaac or the promised child of god he came by a word from god he came on the scene by a promise out of the mouth of the living god hallelujah amen what a wonderful wonderful type for we know that jesus christ again another symbol but then the last day church that we are now in this church has become so old seven church ages have passed age after age after age and now it's like an old church very old thousands of years old how shall she bring forth a bride how shall she bring forth a child but god promised that out of that dead womb his spoken word he will bring about her a resurrection a life from the dead amen he'll bring one from the dead doesn't matter how much the church world out there appears dead amen they may say oh we're not dead they're jumping around they're speaking in towns they're clapping they're keeping a lot of noise with musical instruments and everything else but that's just as much as cutting off the head of a snake and the head is cut off the glory is departed but the body is still jumping around and wriggling around and it's still capable of biting you or or putting its uh its coils around your life but the thing is dead amen but this is coming forth out of the word of god by the promise of god in the last day that according to malachi 4 5 that god would send the prophet elijah in these last days and he would restore the faith of the children back to the apostolic fathers what the apostles had come back to us by the opening and revelation of the word of god and god used brother william marin branham in that role to bring about the fulfillment of his word we thank the living god amen so this last day church is now giving birth out of her we're coming out of it and out of it in a birth is coming a bride is coming on a promised seed it's coming a free seed it's coming the children of god anointed by the promised word of the day hallelujah god bringing us forth as word children children of the promise because we are born from the promises of god in this world amen so a bright church supposed to be born by the word when in the book of acts god promised in this day this last day that he would call out the people from among the gentiles to what to bear his name like a wife like a woman like a young woman getting married she begins she bears the name of the man to whom she is married hallelujah praise god now i can touch on the godhead right here because if the man is a carpenter if that man at the same time is in us mechanics and at the same time if he does some farming so he knows farming he's a farmer he's a carpenter and he's a mechanic when they get before the minister the minister asks him for his name and says we'd like for you to sign now this woman you take this woman to be your wife and he says okay sign the papers and he he writes down mechanic the minister said no no no no no no no i need your name but but but i i'm a mechanic that's what i do but that's i don't need that he said well then i'll i'll give you i'm a farmer no i don't need your title i don't need who you are or what you do yeah but i'm this i'm that no i need your name it's the same thing god comes in the titles of father god is a father god came created a body got into it lived in the body the father lived in the sun god was in christ the father that dwelt in him he does the work and now he says his name shall be called jesus for he shall save his people from their sins peter in the book of acts chapter 2 he says there there is no other name nor the name not mary not peter not james not philip not any other name given under heaven by heaven whereby we must be saved but the name of jesus christ hallelujah paul said all that we do let us we do it in the name of jesus christ hallelujah praise god aren't you happy that we are the manifested word seed children of the promised word of god for this hour on our descent is from the very generation and see life of god through abraham praise his marvelous name now i want you to see also that the promise of god catching into the womb of sarah was a type of burial and resurrection from the bowels or womb of the earth just as much as isaac went up the mountain with abraham and was supposed to be sacrificed but came back down jesus was supposed to be dead went into the earth and was dead and buried but on the third day rose back up with the glory came back down in the form of the holy spirit as a symbol and type of the fulfillment of the word of god now turning our attention from abraham let us go to john chapter four verses one and two when therefore the lord knew how the pharisees had heard that jesus made and baptized more disciples than john though jesus himself baptized not but the disciples he left judea and departed again into galilee that he must needs go through samaria and we'll get to the rest of the story for here the bible tells us he must needs go through samaria oh blessed be the name of the lord when god knows he has children he goes after them and the story tells us the story of the woman at the well the prostitute at the well better known as the woman of samaria at the well and the scene is set well there comes jesus and the bible tells us saint john chapter 4 that he had to go by there and there the bible tells us that he sat on the well well let me make this clear this was the same melchizedek now in the form of flesh named jesus melchizedek hallelujah in a flesh form now called jesus christ amen now we see that there was a well there dug by jacob many years before and it was about 11 o'clock in the day and he sent his disciples to get some food for them and while they were gone there was this woman that was ill-famed as women in towns villages cities everywhere we have such people we don't know the reason why they will do such things sometimes they're seduced sometimes they're forced sometimes they're willingly do that other times hardships come upon them various situations that we may never be able to explain or to be able to understand but this was a red light woman a marked woman of that time and she had many husbands but here was jesus sitting by the well and this woman came by the well at 11 around 11 o'clock now she couldn't come in the early morning when the virgins uh and the married women would come down to the well to get their water so people are of her status would wait until the well is clear and nobody is about to cheater chatter goth gossip or talk or call names and then she would go there to get her water because she could not mix with them because in those days the women the the prostitutes had a mark the their hair in the front was cut in a certain way where they could be instantly recognized by a man or any other person that they were free and open for service and here it was friends she came to get water she's about to put her buckets into the well and as she did that she heard a voice behind her saying woman bring me some water to drink now remember this is melchizedek this is melchizedek in the form of jesus the same yesterday today and forever the son of man has spoken of in the bible in the word form of flesh making himself manifesting uh manifested or melchizedek manifesting through flesh amen the word was made flesh and now it was manifesting through that flesh amen and i believe the same thing is happening today that the word again has returned and is manifesting true human flesh amen praise god now the woman spun around because she heard a voice i'll tell you my friends you may have heard church voices you might have heard the voice of some so-called called himself an apostle call himself a so-called church prophet call himself a great man in the world you might have heard many voices but when she heard this voice the bible said she turned around and i tell you friends it'll make you repent it'll make you want to change your life it'll make you want to turn around and go in the opposite direction from whence you were going but here was this woman oh my glory to god hallelujah amen and when she looked she saw a young jew just imagine a young jew that just about 31 years old and she a young prostitute come out there for water and he is asking her for a drink of water now that kind of a woman you know immediately what she will be thinking uh and how she is talking to him and uh uh you know she's he said to her um water um are you what are you talking about water in other words she's trying to find where he's coming from he says no if you knew who was speaking to you you knew you would know that i can give you all the water you want that you will never have to thirst again you'll never thrust again and say well how you gonna draw it the well is deep he said no the water i give is a water of eternal life if you drink it you'll live forever glory to god that's the water that we are giving out to quench the people's hunger and spiritual thirst people in this day in this hour that thirsting they're hungry for something real something true something honest this money begging money loving fame seeking name seeking numbers game that they're they're caught up in my friends people are looking for the reality of the power of god in the presence of the holy spirit working through the life of simple and humble people that will walk with god and god will walk with them amen hallelujah he spoke with the woman and she said you greater than our father uh uh jacob or abraham he said before abraham was i am amen oh my oh he said sir sir i perceive that you're some kind of a prophet she said well uh gone where is your husband she says i don't have any husband you see she was an unmarried prostitute uh uh an unmarried loose woman oh my he said to her you told the truth you have no husband because you're not married but i'll tell you right now you have five and one of them is not your own in other words you have five you've you've gone with five unmarried men and the four unmarried men and this fifth one you're planning to go with is a married man don't do it amen you see now we understand why the bible tells us melchizedek had to meet this woman because she was one of his genes one of those thoughts that was in the very mind of god before the foundation of the world and we she we just as her she came down into this human body to live and walk on the face of this earth full of sin deceit lies trips traps all manner of evil to cause us to stumble fail fall and to do every possible thing and god will look and god sees all our mistakes but there is a point where he is saying i would stand for it anymore for one of my children to go this far i can't allow it that is why we read in john 4 4 he must needs go through scenario yes he needed to go through there because he had to wait by the while he knew she was coming and he had to be able to arrest her a car catch her attention and draw her back to himself back to the word that she would recognize who she is that she is not just a a prin prostitute in this world but she's a princess with the living god come out of that kind of a life back to the word of god hallelujah be the princess that you are according to this word of god and god will back you up and be with you every step of the way hallelujah amen glory to god oh my hallelujah she said sir i perceive you're a prophet when messiah comes he is going to do such things like this call out people tell them the secrets of their hearts call them by their name never having met them tell them about all their situation without even knowing them and she realized it was not just the the flesh form outside but the person inside there that was speaking through that form to her was the lord god himself by this word making himself manifested through the word oh glory to god hallelujah she said that is the sign of messiah for when the sign messiah comes he is supposed to do those things ah now she is revealing that somewhere in her background she had some scriptural understanding somewhere she must have read her torah which is the jewish bible at that time so she must have been in a uh a godly home and somewhere along the line some evil person destroyed her life or virtue she found herself in a hard situation maybe father dead mother dead and having several children uh brothers and sisters younger than herself i'm not justifying that kind of a life i'm just telling you from the scripture that's what could have been her life and so she stepped over the line and she started going in that direction but she started going and the lord saw that was going too far because now she was going to take a married man somebody else's husband and he came down and put a stop to it right there right then hallelujah i'm too happy that we have a god like this god watching over us every single step of the way we give him the glory we give him the honor and we give him the praise glory to god hallelujah amen oh praise god i want you to know he promised to do that same thing at the ending of the church ages according to malachi 4 5 even sent back jesus but he would send a prophet in the spirit and the anointing of elijah according to malachi chapter 4 verse 5 and to that prophet the great angel of revelation 10 1 the mighty angel would come down and speak to that earthly prophet and reveal himself reveal himself and reveal the word of god reveal the mysteries of god to that prophet who would then unfold it to the rest of the elected seed that are scattered all over the face of the earth my friends let me tell you that has happened and is happening for our precious brother william marion branham has come fulfilled the word of god as never before and planted the seed warden in my heart in the heart of many others anointed with the word of god to to glean the end time harvest that is in the world today from every continent every corner of this world god the great shepherd is now calling for his sheep to come home come home back to the word back to this time an hour it's supper time now it's it's wedding separate time now it's time to feast upon the word of god for this day and time come out of all the crookedness and evilness of denominationalism oh praise god the holy spirit is here with his word to call you out and to bring his word to you and break the devil's back and kick him out of your life that you might live for the lord jesus christ and him forevermore oh praise god amen amen yes sir it was a promise that he would reveal himself again as the son of man so he promised he would come back to meet abraham's seed upon the face of the earth now i'm thinking of the eagle story where that eagle had an egg that the farmers took stole the egg like these church members these churches or denominations steal the people's heart away from god while telling you they're gonna make you love god they cause you to love them more amen praise god until people would kill for their church rather than to stand up for the truth that is in the word of the living god but one day just like jesus just like melchizedek he had to pass that woman's way he had to go through he must needs go through some area he knew he had a child there he knew he had an attribute there he knew he had a gene there and he had to pass that way to pick her up to to correct her and lead her and guide her in the right direction and so as us as he did so did this eagle pass over the burn yard amen that's like us in this rotten stinking world if you ever been in a a big style if you're building a burn yard with chicken chicken stuff on the ground and and dung and and cowed down and got down and everything else it's so smelly my friends and so there we are in this world surrounded by a world of sin and evil oh my god just like this but you know the farmer took that egg place it under him and the hand hatched i'll tell you friends that that egg all the birds create the same kind of warp that will hatch an egg so they take the eagle's egg and put it in a church nest in a denomination and the heat and the and the clapping and the worship and everything else it could cause a child to come forth but then the child doesn't know who he is who she is where they come from who is their father where are they going and so when the mother church or the mother hand says the ego doesn't know what they're talking about that doesn't they don't understand those towns they don't understand any of that sort of thing and so they don't know why how come she's supposed to be my mother but i don't understand her i'm not getting anything from that and then the brothers so-called those brothers of chicken brothers that he have and chicken sisters that you have all they are going around saying cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap well let me tell you there's a cost to any true pentecost there is plenty of cost for a petite a real petty cause you don't get that cheap you come in the presence of god you pay the price you my friends you go through fiery trials and testing and everything else but he promised that he'll bring you out by a mighty hand oh glory to god hallelujah amen another thing the young eagle realized they were there every time she all run to her when she do that he can't run in time plus they're scratching to get worms and dung and bugs to eat on the ground meanwhile he has a hunger within him that can't satisfy him those kinds of church doctrines and church litanies and church fundamentals and all those it can't fulfill him his hunger there's something in him hungering for the truth he must have the word of god and the power of the holy spirit within his life and so here he was not this happy with scratching he walked the threat to them you know they could run like that and but he had this big two long wings and he has to walk like that walk like that because of his two wings and and he got these nails on him the wrestling said brother why are your nails so long why are your wings so big why you have all why are you seeing the word like that why you have these uh things happening to you like that but you see he was different amen praise god even when the rest of them are clockwork and he tried to answer them back his voice coming out with an eagle scream hallelujah a voice of the eagle cry out of his voice mine out of him claim that voice hallelujah it scared the rest of them that kind of preaching and talking and explaining other words it got them scared they didn't want nothing to do with it and after a while they started to run away from him they didn't want to deal with that lady that child that brother that will speak the word in that manner but one day that mother eager realized she has a son and passed over that barnyard and let out the scream hallelujah oh my i believe the great eagle of god jehovah is passing over the barnyard of your neighborhood your area is passing over your nation and is letting out the scream come up higher come up to me amen rise up and come up glory to god hallelujah he says how am i going to come up and the mother eagle says son you got those two things called wings oh my god he said oh i didn't know i can use them yeah you got the old and the new testament and you don't know you can use them to fly oh my i'm going to teach you how to fly someone climb up fly up to that to that person's post fly up there and he he fly he he didn't like that and he flew up oh maybe maybe i can maybe i can oh maybe i can okay son just flap those wings and let the wind of the s let the wind catch it and when the wind gets under your wings you'll be able to fly he was scared but he tried it and you know what the wind caught his wings and lifted him off of that fence post and you know he tattered a little bit but after a while he was flying amen and here he was could fly up to where his mother was may the same holy spirit of the living god so anoint you that when you look into this word the word begins to come to life the old testament the new testament begin to come to life to you and open up to you until you can fly up you can go into the heavenly places in christ jesus to walk with him and talk with him and have fellowship with him glory to god amen amen now melchizedek met abraham after the battle why because those five kings had captured lot all friends maybe the devil captured your husband maybe the devil captured your wife maybe the devil captured your son your daughter your child maybe you have been captured by the devil oh but abraham went after them and captured those five kings which as i told you last week are a symbol or type of your five senses which satan plays upon your desires your motivations your imaginations your tasting feeling smelling and stuff he plays on that and pulls you away from god's presence but thank god abraham was an overcomer and he overcome all those senses of the world of flesh and the devil and brought la a lot back brother sister if you have received this word in your heart you can't sit still you want to get out there and call out for your brother your
