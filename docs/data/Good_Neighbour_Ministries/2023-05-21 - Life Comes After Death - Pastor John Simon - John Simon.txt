forevermore I'm happy to see some of my older Believers coming now with the warmth of the season coming into the house of God and of course I always think about them like I just mentioned to you one of those Believers that was with me originally from the very beginning um left and went to be with the Lord as you know a lot of smaller groups have come off from this church right uh it would have been a huge uh church but always it gets to that point where God takes off a group takes off a group I didn't understand that that person as a pastor you want to know why why are these people just go like that then you realize God is actually multiplying his word and that's what he's doing and he's got to use somebody to do that so using me as a planter grower distributor and all that I just come to understand that as I grew because as you preach you grow also praise the Lord so I thank God for you who are here still holding to God's unchanging hands amen praise the Lord um I will be speaking today and um I normally will just give my topic to brother Corey or whoever is out there and they'll take it to the back and I said I don't know what I'm going to actually call this uh and I don't know why uh why I don't have a like a topic right now but it's this it's the meat or the subject that you will have to pay attention to and I'm praying that somehow God will open his word to us and bless us as we walk together amen praise the Lord and why should I always be like a little ahead of the crowd not sitting back and waiting for somebody to say something to hear it and then go say it but always seem to break on these things for the glory of God anyway the Lord bless you welcome we're happy to have you in the house of the Lord here today God richly bless you everyone that's represented in the house of God or text that will be Matthew chapter 24. reading from verse 45 to 51 of course we could read a lot more but my emphasis is on the message that we have to bring here today and that is why but you can read that when you get home those scriptures uh when you do get home amen now Matthew 24 verses 45 to 51. praise the Lord who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his Lord had made ruler over his household to give them meat in his Jew season blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing verily I say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his Goods but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart my Lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to Smite his fellow servants and eat and drink with the drunken the Lord of that servant shall come in a day when he look at not for him and in an hour that he is not aware of and shall cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the Hypocrites there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth let us have a word of Prayer our righteous and gracious Heavenly Father here we come as helpless human beings Limited in thought word and action but you the great Eternal unlimited one being here with us today we invite your Royal Divine Supernatural presence Among Us we ask you father as we pay uh respects to Thy word that you will draw near and that the great holy spirit of God will make the word live again that you will anoint your servant you will anoint the hearers of the word as well as the speaker of the word father we surrender ourselves for worship and for thy Glory and Honor we ask this in the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord amen and amen God bless you richly please be seated okay really I paused there because really thinking about what this is going to be about is the the time of the message what we call the message of the hour what season are we in what is really going on at this time and I like to start by going and reminding you of Moses you remember Moses had a message from God to bring to the children of Israel now uh to you who are aware of the types and the Shadows you understand that as I was with Moses so will I be with thee now uh we know that the prophet of Malachi 4 5 brother William Marion Branham lightened himself in that position bringing the people of God out of denominational slavery enslavement into uh the Wilderness of the of this world that church world that we are in but leading us right onto the promised land of the fullness amen but there was a gap there was Israel there was a Wilderness Journey then there was a Promised Land the problem was in the wilderness Journey because the people's expectations is that they were going into the promised land shortly after a brief while there would be in the Promised Land however they found themselves encountering trials they found themselves uh encountering Heat they found themselves encountering poisonous snakes they found a problem of the bitter Waters of Mara the heat of the desert of sin all around them they had trials and problems no water in the desert but you see whenever they had a problem God solved it for them when they had no shade he allowed the cloud to come above them A Cloud by day and what was a shadow over them when they were thirsty Moses he said strike that rock out of the rock flown waters for them to drink and when there were sick he says for take a serpent put it on a pole raise it up and if they look there they will look and live oh praise God I want to thank God today we are in that same position spiritually that the great Holy Spirit of the Living God overshadows us with the wings of the almighty Jehovah God amen when we are thirsty he brings water for us spiritually refreshment to refresh our souls when we are hungry he feeds us with the bread of life amen they had Manna coming from above we have spiritual manner or Revelation coming to us but nevertheless in the midst of all this the Bible said the people began to murmur they saw the pillar of Fire they saw the miracle of water coming out of the Rock beginning from they saw pharaoh and all the devils and demons that held them under control before habits they could never get rid of situations they could not defeat they saw it their cigarettes their drugs there uh whatever their side all defeated and drowned in the red sleet see of the blood of Christ there were delivered and they recognized that they were delivered and then Into the Wilderness trials after trial not realizing God was testing and trying to prove who amongst them is his own word testing and trying to know who are his elect that will go over into the Promised Land and so we find out that we're having trials and there were murmuring complaining and crying but they never realized Moses and Joshua uh Joshua and Caleb sorry just one Caleb were having the identical trials but there were not murmuring and complaining they were just looking forward to get to that promised Landing what they were gonna do when they get over there they were just looking ahead of what they could accomplish for the glory of God but they were getting the same trials what is the difference 100 trials one complaint one warmer one cried one one to subvert the kingdom of a troll the leadership whoever else and the other was there supporting the leader and the others was there looking forward to the victory that was supposed to come and shouting Glory Hallelujah oh my one cringing and oh look this desert the heat of this desert oh my so hot I'm perspiring I'm sweating them tired I'm weary the other one was saying oh Shine On Me Lord shine on me let the light of the lighthouse shine on me praise God they wanted the light of God to shine upon them the sunshine light of God shining on the seed word planted within their hearts would then spring to life amen oh my no matter where God's life is hidden whoever it is hidden in the most unlikely places it will be hidden in hidden in a prostitute by the well yet it was hidden in a ruler of Israel named Nicodemus that seed of God germ of God lives in whoever ascends it and he appoints it to whoever wherever he wants it to be from the day before they were born as a matter of fact he said before you were born I already knew you I ordained you to be the Way You Are yeah yeah people may see your strange or different you're you're funny what God made you that way God places life within you that you will you will act like him when you act like him you are strange to the people and they don't recognize that it's not just the man the woman is God working through them amen hallelujah yes sir praise God Amen yes sir so Joshua Caleb could already see themselves across the Jordan and into the promised land while the others can only see themselves they're still in the desert and you are where you are spiritually speaking oh my praise God hallelujah do you know that some people had so much Faith some of that young generation had so much faith that they actually walk with seeds to plant when they get to that Promised Land praise God I hope some of you are walking with your seeds amen I hope you have seeds of life truth Revelation that you can share with others that's in your hearts and in your mouths that you can you can go and hand it to others that they also may live amen so we are to plant seeds of Faith nevertheless the Bible tells us that the coming of the Lord will not take place until there be a falling away first there must be a falling away in in a Paul speaks of it when he said Jesus actually said it he said don't you understand many of your fathers died in the wilderness they never saw the promised land Paul said yet they were baptized under the same cloud there were there passed through the Wilderness that Joshua Caleb and all the others came true they passed through it amen they came right out but yet they died they were Jews they were originals but there were not allowed to cross over because they were not God's germ God's seed his his thought his attribute for that day or for that time and so they were not allowed to cross over my they died right there in the wilderness o praise God I want you to know it's time to cross from this message into the promised land of the unwritten word and that is where the problem comes right there first of all they do not some don't believe there is any Unwritten word Unwritten scripture and nevertheless God says Ah John what you see that part don't write Unwritten scripture it's right there he says what you see here don't write because he didn't want John to say it write it for the devil catch it but he wanted to be able to communicate it directly to his his elected seed by the facility and faculty of Revelation that's why he said to Peter he said flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my Father in Heaven has revealed this under you and Upon This Rock of Revelation I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell will try to Prevail against it will fight them and by you know reproach them and Blacken their names and everything else but the Gates of Hell shall not prevail they shall not Prevail they're gonna fight it's going to fight it but it will not Prevail against it because of the rock of Revelation why do you think the prophet said this third Paul cannot be actually copied they can't impersonate it why because he actually didn't allow it to write as letters that the human mind thought I can conceive of and catch it pick it up and then the wisdom of Satan and the wisdom of man can analyze their bad structure and every everything else like that but he left it in the form of pure revelation pure rip Unwritten word that only the believer has the faculty to be able to pick it up the word is broadcasting in a way of length that there don't have the heirs to able to pick it up and that is why look I go back to my old dog whistle thing which you all know that dogs have such a cute hearing that sometimes there is a whistle that the the trainers can use and when they use it you don't hear anything coming out of it but the dogs are hearing that whistle at the high pitch and they can obey it because they're hearing it my praise God it's the same manner in the same way people are right around you all sitting in church hearing the same word hearing the same Bible being preached but Revelation is coming out of that written word and they elect our hearing it on a higher wavelength Hallelujah they're picking it up they're recognizing what God is saying for this hour not for any other day but for this day this hour this time praise God hallelujah people try to convince you they're hearing but they're hearing Luther right up to Pentecost what I am trying to tell you is it's not even recognizing and hearing Pentecost is to recognize your day and the message for your day and what God is saying in this hour and in this time by the word of the holy spirit amen praise God Amen and we find our friends that Joshua and Caleb enter the promised land to overcome the enemies amen because when they cross the promised land of course they have to overcome then they have to occupy and then they have to possess see you first got to overcome the land before you can occupy it take it over and then when you take it over you gotta plant your steaks I this is my land this land is my land Heaven is my home amen we're going home aren't we I said we're going home oh going home we are going home we ain't got long to stay here for I've got a glimpse of that Heavenly land praise God I'm going home do you believe that we're going home I said we're going home we caught a glimpse of that Heavenly land and we're going home trials and troubles are like water passing off from a duck's back because we're headed to glory amen we're headed to Glory but while we are talking like this I want you to recognize that there are many at this hour that are falling away because the message when from when it started to when this Rapture is supposed to take place it looks so long is there really a rapture is there really going to be a body change are these things uh uh you know maybe the figment of a a real good man he was a good man you know a real good Bible teacher a real evangelist you know we might even call him a prophet because there's many other prophets anyway so so so he was good but you know he didn't have much Bible schooling to Northwestern Bible College and so the things that he were saying sounded good and maybe they were true but uh somewhere along the line he must have missed something and and the Rapture is not exactly the way that he was trying to present it to us you see that's the way that a lot of them are looking at it and so we find there has been and is going on right now of Falling Away there is a falling away going on people are murmuring they're questioning what's brother Branham really the prophet is he really Malachi 4 uh maybe he he put himself in there and he's not the one just like they told Moses you must have carved that thing yourself and bring it down here because you want to control all these people you know so oh yeah him you have people who followed this message are now going out and on the internet opposing the message finding fault with what we call the message of course the real message came out of the message you understand and when I say message you differentiate the one message between what is called the message and what is the message that's revealed to the True Believer amen there is a difference there amen so you must understand that or right there now we understand that's happening people are murmuring people are complaining people are saying things and God is allowing that that this this waiting period that's going on right now to create boredom as it did in Israel boredom is creating dissatisfaction it's creating in them uh impatience and all the hidden up uh virtues seven deadly sins that were hidden up within persons that Satan tried to kind of cover them up with religiosity and even come in the message with a former Pentecostal Holiness upon them and they're covered with the leaves of all kinds of various things but the pressure of waiting is bringing out for faculties out of these people out of people that they you can't even realize my goodness I didn't know that was there hidden underneath that kind of appearance what I'm saying is going on right now it's happening right now but God has a reason our purpose for everything This is the End of the Age of the church ages oh my and the angels Messengers uh Servants of God are to separate the wheat from the chaff the sheep from the goats separate them how by the word Hebrews 4 12 the word is sharp quick it's a discerner of the heart the thoughts amen it'll let you know who you are by the power of the Holy Spirit praise the Lord God's spirit is doing that oh blessed be the name of the Lord let me throw a thought in here quickly let me pass over this you know uh Moses and the people of Israel were under the aaronic priesthood is that right do you know the day Jesus died the aaronic priesthood came to an end amen Jesus the word who was the message of that hour the moment he Jesus the word that was called the message they didn't really realize who he was or call the word the moment he died the aaronic priesthood died and another priesthood came into being and that's what Paul recognized and was saying we are now here as the royal priesthood because we are the Royal seed with the royal priesthood to bring forth the word of God what is that royal priesthood the five genuine five-fold Ministry everybody is calling themselves fivefold Ministry but a real seed will recognize immediately the difference between the true and the false amen but the spirit the Living God God brings for a nodding to the order of Melchizedek we won't even go down that road I'm not talking about a large order as the one man approached me on the street when I was just about 18 years old and said as something about you which order you from I am from he told me I am from the order of so and so I said oh you from that order I said well I'm just from the order of melchized he said order of now that's the highest oh my God they sent me to tell I said they sent you to tell me I said no let me tell you what I see and I began to tell him and he began to run you're right he began to run because I started telling him by the Holy Spirit what I see ahead of him but brother sister a different order is now in progress a different order is now in progress but it could only come into progress in its full potential if I won't say everything I can say but you can take it and think now it couldn't come into its fullness until after Jesus died when he died one died and the other one comes to life praise the Lord and that is why life I think brother coffee you were preaching this just preaching not this but preaching along these lines um you know a week ago about life comes out of a death when something dies something has to die for you to live brother Branham said it we know that but praise the Lord what I'm trying to tell you from out off and here I say it out of the death of this mess message comes the life of the Bride the bride lives and tries out of the message because her birth came out of this mess and out of the mess that they're calling today the message out of that mess comes the life of the bride and a manifestation of the word and of this royal priesthood making itself declared for the glory of God there's nothing like it because it's the holy spirit it's not man made or men trying to make themselves something or the other no far be it matter of fact that if they can hide they get away they want to be out of sight and let her eyes see Jesus only see Jesus and Jesus alone amen Just One Look upon his face will change your life change your heart change your walk even if you're a Believer and you're recognize amen and you see Jesus my God hallelujah it lets you into another plane oh praise God forevermore and so we find out brother Branham has asked as questions many years ago in this hour don't change anything you're doing for if Jesus is coming in the morning Preach Today like if he's going to be 10 years from today but live it like it's going to be at this hour he may appear don't you get yourself scrupled up in into anything but what I'm doing I'm trying to warn you about see what I see but don't be odd don't make yourself peculiar in other words he's trying to tell you just be a be yourself just be a human being don't try to walk around with the biggest Bible to prove you are the biggest Christian or you put on the holy the most holiest face you can find or something just go along and relax you are you God is the master artist and he never made two of anything not even twins are identical we say identical because of our human sight but with God this makes nothing two of nothing each one is singular separate each one is unique amen so a unique praise the Lord right where you are you're a star is that right brother Glenn amen see brother Glenn acknowledges he's a star so we thank God we have a star amen We're All Stars where were you when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy praise the name of the Lord I warn you don't be odd don't be peculiar don't change nothing but if you're doing something wrong or doing some evil repent of that see come back to God come back to the word continue on with your Evangelistic Services just like you always done you see what I'm saying people have come oh praise God the message has gone now this preached you know people are maturing in the word there's no need for uh Evangelistic Services anymore we don't have to do that because the last one is in or almost near in so we don't have to do that the prophet is saying no no no no no no no don't let the devil get you into that Spirit recognize you are to keep evangelizing and doing missionary work Evangelistic work Street side work reaching out wherever you can for the glory of God respective of the hour that we are living in amen continue for instance if you are working for a man and you know that it was 15 minutes before quitting time and you say oh 15 more minutes to go I might as well just go over here and sit down then you'll get docked with your pain for for that 15 minutes but I say if you are planting wheat plant your wheat amen praise God if you're digging potatoes dig them potatoes out to the ground preach the people out of sin preach them out of the church World preach them out of their cultural inhibitions preach them out to their situations let them dig them out of the conditions they're in bring them in from the fields of sin Let the Holy Spirit speak to their hearts and draw them into his divine presence amen glory to God this is what he's saying here oh praise God if nobody will eat well why should I dig them out nobody will eat them that don't make any difference dig them out anyhow somebody because well the time is at hand will sell off our farm cause the Millennium is going to start and I want need the farm right well you know I'll just give it to my children let the children have the farm the children them in the tribulation so at least they have something to eat off eat off off and then they sell out the farm oh my oh friends if I know he was coming tomorrow I and I was a farmer I'd put my crop in amen praise the Lord I'll preach the word I'll win your souls and have special meetings and let God draw lies closer to him by the power of the Holy Spirit even if I know he's coming tomorrow morning praise the name of the Lord yes sir he says don't if you're a mechanic Mike where Prophet says it Mike he says if you're a mechanic brother Brandon was speaking here not about you but he's talking about mechanics he said if you are a mechanic then stay a mechanic do your mechanics amen hallelujah praise the name of the Lord amen he said somebody the other day said oh I bought a new car he says I'm going to give a pastor I I'm going to give you my keys for that new car because the Rapture may come tomorrow and I won't need this anymore and he's giving us Pastor brother Branham says here see see he's saying his Pastor is going to miss it so he has to give the pastor his car keys because he is going in the Rapture and the pastor is going to be left behind oh my oh my sexy but if he comes tomorrow I want to be faithful at my poster Duty don't you don't you I want you to acknowledge it that you're going to be faithful at your postal Duty wherever you are for the grace of God listen I want you brother Brandon speaking to be a sin solid Christian oh my there's so many Christians uh losing it they're taking the message trying to analyze it debated twist and everything else these these uh types and shadows and representations and Parables and Proverbs in the word until the Mind becomes all twisted up amen or twisted up like that and going off in every possible way but I want to he said to a man saying Christians amen want you to be sane sensible amen it's similar to what I always say uh you know you also got to be practical is that right don't only be so spiritually minded that you know Earthly good you also have to deal with things here after you finish praying and shouting in here you still got to go and pay your rent tomorrow I'm sorry I'm starting to talk like this but I look look this is when the cooking gets down to gravy and grits and the bottom of the pot and I used to love that when I was younger and they finished I scrape that out I love that anyway whatever term you used to use we call it bun bun we call it this we call it that we dig it out and eat it praise because we feel the strength of everything settled to the bottom so it might not look as good as yours but I can tell you there's something in there there's something in there and I'm enjoying it praise the name of the Lord glory god so be a sane sensible solid Christian don't go wrong making yourself like an old lovely beautiful sisters but they're going to make their face up nobody should talk to them or approach them or anything like that because they're so spiritual but you still got to live right here you still got to live right here is that right praise the Lord you got to take care of all your natural things right uh interject here brother Tim but it's not proper preaching like this but you know some people says money is evil it's bad it's yeah and you spend all week working for it you curse it on a Sunday and go work for it on a Monday what sense is that it's not the money it's evil it's the love of money that's right that's what's evil it's you the evil is in you not in the money money is an inanimate object right it's something you can burn you can you can throw away man you know if you have money to burn you can burn it that's what I mean but praise the Lord hallelujah amen say brother Simon Don't Preach like that preach us serious messages about the half hour Silence of seven thunders in the heavens and all that that's good but this is part of it but it's not in the way you think it should be but this is the way it is and the truth is going to get true to you more than you can ever believe now uh he said um I'll be I'm I'll be standing right here preaching if he's coming tomorrow morning I'll be saying the same things I'm saying now if he's coming this is my post of Duty and when he comes I'll just move right on from there with him wherever he is going I'm gonna follow him amen but I'm going to stand at my post of Duty praise the name of the Lord oh praise God forevermore or if you're holding potatoes for those potatoes oh don't drop the when he comes then you drop the hole and then you take off with him but while he's not here yet he says keep pouring us potatoes amen praise God hallelujah oh my isn't that wonderful remember I I'm remembering uh again I've I spoke this to U.S Believers how that in the Old South these slaves were working and they were there picking the watermelons and the boss left and went out and they worked and the Sun is hot real hot and they say he's not here now he's not coming back for maybe half an hour or so or an hour so let's go and take a rest in the shade and there was a huge fence so the sun shining this way the shade there they sat behind the fence and they were there and while they're there this you know one of them or two of them start singing the boss thinks I'm working but I ain't the boss thinks I'm working but I ain't the boss thinks I'm working but I ain't then they heard a voice from over the other side of the fencing and the rascal thinks I'm going to pay him but I ain't ah you see it's the same thing keep working whether you see the boss or not and when he comes he will reward you he will reward you according to what you have done for his glory and for his honor amen blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah see drop that hole but don't drop it until that Jubilee trumpet sounds amen hallelujah and when you know it then you drop it and you run amen until that trumpet sounds you just do that for the glory of God hallelujah amen and praise God so it's time to cross from what man calls the message Amen brother Brandon I'm just showing you because you the devil would play play with words and try to mess with your mind you see Moses message was to the children of Israel when Moses died the aaronic priesthood continued on but it changed the moment the full word Jesus Christ came on the scene it passed away I wanted to know brother Branham over and over again typed himself as in the position of Moses leading the turian Dr Moses many many messages uh leading the turn to the promised land of what the fullness of the word right and we've come to that again so when I say leaving the message I'm saying leaving what they call the message of the Moses of our day leaving that outward part of it but the revelation of the word can never pass away it can never pass away for that is Eternal Word it cannot pass away and it's within the mess the message that is called the message am I getting you mixed up I hope you're understanding it's in the message so you got to listen to tape still you got to hear the prophet you got to hear it and out of that you will receive what God wants you to receive praise the Lord can I preach a little more now one disciple asked Jesus oh did this Z disciples asked him why did the scribe say Elias must first come Jesus said he's already come you didn't recognize it amen and they understood then it was John the Baptist those were elected Apostles and they still could not see who he was my uh is this telling me that even people in a message are going to question if this is real if if it's true are they going to have doubts or can they see the fullness of the word Jesus is giving it in type here where the Branham is saying it here again listen now now think of it the coming of the Lord you know is going to be a secret coming everybody is not going to know about it they're going to be saying that the Lord is coming or the Lord Has Come and they were saying it but actually know it and have a revelation that the Lord is here he's in our next his presence is with us he is in our hearts he lives in me amen praise God see the coming of the Lord is going to be a secret coming for two will be in the bed I'll take one and I'll leave one amen because election and predestination is from what before the foundation of the world you don't come now and say oh I'm going to get saved yeah but you can say that I'm going to get saved but you really can't be saved and be in the bride because she has already been elected from before the foundation of the world she has not been selected now she's being identified Now by her reaction to the word and her behavior Amen in relations to the word and so God is identifying her by seeing his own characteristics in her in the Believers that receive the fullness of this word oh praise God after he has proved his word prove this elect prove this people prove them in the wilderness of child's troubles tribulation trespasses he's tried them in every possible way praise God hallelujah that he recognizes them Hallelujah of who they are amen don't you know people are disappearing off the face of the Earth nobody can account for it amen and you say one of these days people may say to me you mean the tribulation that thing is that thing is on us now the tribulation is here I thought the church had to go in a Rapture and go through the tribulation go through that before the tribulation comes amen this isn't that the right now that's why I'm telling you the state of the message we are right in that hour right now where people are caught in that vertex where they can be sucked in by the devil and not recognize what is taking place right now Jesus may come before morning Jesus may come any moment he may come I don't know Prophet said it could be a hundred years away but that don't make no difference to me I'm living for him right now like if he's gonna come tomorrow morning or the next minute amen that's the way we ought to live for him and walk with him amen oh praise God forevermore amen yes sir my goodness think of it the secret you see that will be the secret coming of the Lord and these people being beginning to disappear and don't realize and understand that the Rapture could take place and they would not do it and they and there there was no nothing about that for that will be the secret going away of the church you see two things we'll meet the Lord in the air he is coming he said this is his secret coming and the Rapture is the secret going of the bride and the two meets the Lord meet together like Isaac and Rebecca met in the field now he meets the Lord in the air but it's all done so secretly because they're looking for a Rapture according to man's imagination they don't realize you are already being translated by the revealed word of God you are already undergoing your body change by God's power to transform you are already changing from Glory unto Glory until you step right into the glory land it's going on right now praise God why do you think Paul said we are not going to be asleep you see how Paul thought it was so eminent that it could happen any minute now he said we are not going to be asleep because when the Rapture comes he says some will be alive Hallelujah and you who are alive will be what changed changed when when you're alive you've been changed by the power of the Revelation or the word of the Living God hallelujah your change is going on what change you're changing from your mortal into immortality this Mortal shall put on Immortal amen praise God that's going on right now I'm in the process I'm in the process I don't know about you but I'm in the process amen the Rapture is really a process of change leading to the the the event right and that event is an instant but a process leading to an incident where the spirit of God takes you out of here by the grace of the Living God hallelujah look at the danger of it now he says the secret going away of the church the and you know that that's going on but many people will go right on preaching you got to realize that I can put the word in here preaching the message because before that he said Apostles and yet they could not see this they could not see what was happening here and they'll sincerely go on preaching saying they believe and even adding to the church building churches and going on like that not knowing the Rapture is done past and they're left behind you remember my message on Left Behind where I preach showing that people already being left behind they don't understand that they're left behind because others have caught the revelation of the last last prophets message the revelation of the message and they are moving in that Revelation and as they move out you're being left behind because what are they talking about what is this what you see you've been left behind you're left behind already right it's not then all of a sudden you from there gone up and you left on the ground now that's not what it's talking about you're being left behind by the unfolding revelation of the word of God that has caught the hearts of the True Believer and drawn them to himself by the third pole of the holy spirit amen drawn you closer to him amen wow oh my hundreds of people disappear parents from the earth people don't know nothing about where they went can't count it amen oh and you'll never hear from them that could be the rapture amen do you think because you're the member of some church or something like that amen you better take the whole word of God the whole word of God and hold on to it quit your Hollywood acting you know what he's talking about tetrical Christianity where the Christianity is a message Act message people usually has this costume you know the dress would be this way they shirt their pants the way they talk and so on they have a certain message suit they put on and you recognize them by that and uh this is what he's saying stop the Hollywood acting be yourself live your life but according to the word Liberty doesn't mean lawlessness Freedom doesn't mean folly it's not foolishness it's living by the word then you are truly free you are free praise the name of the Lord nobody's here to watch come and listen at your whole story if you're turning on a TV nobody is there to come and get close to you and give you a hug to smell your suit whether you had a smoke before you came in I'm not telling you you should have a smoke before you come in so don't go say brother Simon said he never said but I'm trying to tell you we don't have to put on anything because it's all by grace as preached the other night it's Grace this Grace has brought me safe that far far and Grace will lead us home is that right so oh but we've got to be perfect in the lord I can't make mistakes that the other day that guy was grinding on my toe but look I stood by the word you know a real Christian would just bang get off my toe so but that can be a Christian Paul said be angry and sin not right it's not that you can't be angry it's not you can't be displeased about something but you don't break the word and even if you did the Bible says there's an advocate but the father go back and repent about it so live the careless life I mean not in the way you think and care less but Jesus said not to have any cares so you're you're free from care and you live that life where you know you're free from care because even if you're you're facing things God is working things out is that all right I don't care what problem you have there's not one tangle in life that he can't undo there's no not that Satan can put together that can tie you up that God can't bring you out is that right do you believe him you trust him oh praise God forevermore Hallelujah he'll bring you out no matter whatever it is my brother sister devil wants you to uh disbelieve by saying oh you're you're too far gone your sickness is too bad that even the doctors give you up what the doctors got to do with God the doctor God Made You can he make just one part Ford made the car and then you know absence enough to know to make parts for the cars if they get a breakdown or something happens don't God know the same thing God can do the same thing for you amen praise the name of anything happen while I'm talking here with you because this has happened before not preaching on healing but the spirit of Christ is here and once he is here healing is here Deliverance is here Devils cast out in the name of Jesus Christ is right here amongst you for the glory of God because a great physician is walking up and down these aisles the great physician now is there even your back pain if you can believe it it'll leave you right now your blood pressure can leave your right now your eye problem can leave your right now I'm not preaching miracle healing campaign or anything like I'm just telling you he is here and because he is here every Darkness has to flee every Philistine has to go it's got to the park in the name of Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord God hallelujah amen I've said it before say it again I was speaking like that just talking like that and there's a brother there he was a brother and the next thing you know you coughed up a cancer on the floor just like that simple as that you see that's the way God works God doesn't want to put on and show the days passed when the miracle man of God has to come down off there and lay his hands on you and when you get healed say oh God thank God for brother Simon thank God for brothers and soul that there's a real Miracle Man but no now it's him I said it's him he is in our midst he is with us right here right now only believe all things are possible tell them that will believe the word of the Living God amen you live and raise the dead for that matter praise the name of the Lord Lord of God hallelujah amen think of it oh just hold to his unchanging hands see Hollywood just makes a brief bright light many of the stars that you used to worship and those Idols you used to Bow Down and Worship they're dare them God rotten in their graves amen hallelujah see there you can't compare Christ to to Hollywood amen Christ is not even in Hollywood Christ is in the individual amen oh praise God Hollywood glares before your eyes but the gospel glows with humility oh praise God o praise God he comes in human humility in a form of meekness gentleness and he'll pass right through you before you but you'll only see it if you are acquainted with the word you see and now brother Brown I want you to listen to this it's just little things here he says now he that had an ear to hear what the spirit is saying to the churches you see he that can hear I mean now can you repeat it again he said I mean now he that hear it and he uses the word today hear the word for this day for this hour let the spirit of God speak to you and if you were elected and given an inner ear of the holy spirit amen so that you can have that Supernatural intuition and you you know tuition means teaching so when I say intuition you know understand in our teaching and Paul says you have a witness you got the Holy Spirit you got the teacher in you he's going to teach you he's going to guide you he's inspire you he'll talk to you praise God Tim knows about it you know about it Gabriel the spirit of God will move it in you and reveal to you praise the name of the Lord I had to have um permission from the city concerning the church and one day I felt inspired go up to the city hall we didn't have no permission yet to change Bill do nothing and um you weren't there it was Peter myself and I forgot who else but anyway that's not important so what who are you going to I said I don't know but I feel like going up said but but you're going to make yourself look foolish are you going to go up there like that you don't know who you're going to I said I don't know but I feel inspired to go and we got right into the parking lot nothing Supernatural happened nothing happened I stepped open the door of the car and I stepped out as anybody would one foot out first and the moment I stepped out the wind blew and a piece of paper came and my shoe landed on it and I just said what is that picked it up and on it miss the song so so there's the name of a gentleman said okay there's the name that I have to go and see I go up to the city hall go up to the offices I said I'm here I'm not asking now I'm telling them because God done that I said I'm here to see Mr sunset you can't see him but how do you know he's here because he just goes between Toronto this is the man that's the head of everything not just the local one there how do you know he's up here he's from Toronto here I said that's not important I'm here to see him right so they're going until when he came out he said what is your situation when I began to tell him there was a man that was opposing the church he doesn't want it to be built he doesn't want this to happen that happened and stuff and uh you know I said well this is the the situation we have a neighbor opposing it and this other person opposing it and everything else and we need permission he said well I look into it let's have a hearing and they call for a hearing and we had a hearing in the city hall and I was there to represent the church and of course this gentleman was there and other people are coming up and saying well we don't want it there because you know people who were doing drugs will go and hide behind there and do their drugs and smoking and all kinds of stuff going on there and stuff like that so I said well how many years has this been happening back of that building and what was going on they said well so many years is going on he says and during those years you didn't come here and report it you didn't see anything bad was happening you didn't tell us about the drugs you didn't report about the smoke but now it's a church going in there all of a sudden it's drugs it's smoke it's just not going on well I say it's fast amen of course he asked he said uh plumbing department I sent you over to inspectors you didn't get everything it's all right and everything's fine what about you electrical everything is all right you asked the other one everything is all right he said well then I say it's past that's it there's no argument there's nobody higher than him to argue with anyway praise the Lord and it was passed but I'm just trying to show you God hiding in simplicity he leads us along he guides and leads his children for his glory in that way praise the name of the Lord amen of course a mentioned was ready some are already tired of waiting for this Rapture to come amen and they're saying again they're not saying the words but our Lord is delaying is coming the Rapture is delayed right but I'm here to tell you that like Ruth in the Bible we are to watch we are to wait and we are to work amen in the fields for the glory of God hallelujah we got to do that because look brother sister we are here you say oh well why should we do that this is just gleaning left but Ruth was still in the field gleaning you know what gleaning means it means she was going through all this shock and the straw that was left trying to find those last seeds that were under there hidden I don't care if I go got to go through ten thousand shock to find one elect that's the job God put us here to do we got to find them wherever they are brother sister let's run with the message amen praise God in the words of precious brother biscoll when he once said he says there is no other Church age after this one there is nobody else to run run let every one of us run with the message of this hour run with the word hallelujah and let them receive the revelation of this day praise God hallelujah amen yes sir o praise God hallelujah yes sir the bride amen is told to wait I want you to know that we are supposed to wait remember that the 10 foolish word the 10 virgins five were wise and five were foolish and the five was thinking the same thing the Lord is delaying the bread whom the lane is coming so we're going to go out we're going to go out and we're gonna get back before he comes is that right don't you take that chance don't you even think about going back out there and testing the waters in the world don't you even think of going back out in the church world and test the waters out there and thinking you're going to get back in time you may never make it back in time amen but while they were doing that what happened with the with the wise virgins there were busy trimming their laps they were trimming their lamps they were doing that let me bring you another thought there remember when the boss's son told that young woman he says look I'm coming back for you next year I want you to wait for my coming amen the rest of them laughing mocking and everything else but what does the story tell us during that year she was busy getting ready her wedding garments and that is what we are supposed to do get ready you're ready garments the marriage of the land has come and his wife has made herself ready oh praise God oh if you're not ready get ready I said if you're not ready get ready whether you've ready or not he's coming I said whether you're ready or not he's still coming so you're better here for the glory of God Amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen this gospel must be preached as a witness you say oh what's useless so many people out there lost and never mind it must be preached as a witness and how can you be a witness unless you're a true Witness in other words only the elect who have caught the genuine Revelation can really give a genuine witness of the word of God you got what I'm saying only they can give a true Witness it's not to get them saved but the God has to have something to judge them by and he only judges by his word so he has to have that out there did you hear this didn't you hear that did you see that man that woman didn't you see their attitude didn't you know something was different amen see the gospel must be preached as a witness preached in word preached by action preached by your life living Epistles living images of a living God manifested in the Earth today what a time what a season May the spirit of God bless you each one here to live our heads our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for the preaching of the word and we pray that the holy spirit will take these these truths father this mix uh part here Lord and may the Holy Spirit take that father and let the saints of
