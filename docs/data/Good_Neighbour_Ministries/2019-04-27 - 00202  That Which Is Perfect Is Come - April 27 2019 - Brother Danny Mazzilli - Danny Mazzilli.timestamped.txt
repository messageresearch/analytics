[0:00] yes he said in the city seven seas
[0:04] talking about eyes but you don't have
[0:06] eyes to see that we can't possibly see
[0:09] and then he goes up in bed with that
[0:11] come up heels in the seven seas guess
[0:17] what seals we're gonna do he opened
[0:24] those seals because there was a there
[0:27] was a change of watch it was going from
[0:32] the Prophet over to the right angel
[0:35] himself because that seventh seal that
[0:38] was open to interpretation he said to
[0:42] school on is water because Dada was
[0:44] gonna cover the scene he was gonna the
[0:48] intelligence mouth was gonna come and
[1:01] [Music]
[1:12] [Music]
[1:17] revelation
[1:18] [Music]
[1:22] yourself coming to you as an individual
[1:26] and not seeing Chris Paul David no he's
[1:34] calling you by the beat and responding
[1:43] you responded here in your position
[1:47] that's how that's how faster side
[1:50] windows that's how he knows it idiot if
[1:53] the word is having an effect on the
[1:55] people he knows that this is God's
[1:57] church that it's God that causes public
[2:00] places it's the Lord had asked to the
[2:02] church not any not googling out there
[2:06] and you pull people into the church
[2:09] because you can pull people I pulled a
[2:12] lot of people into this church
[2:21] [Applause]
[2:33] [Music]
[2:37] because his children because he's not
[3:44] gonna provoke his son to that he's not
[3:49] gonna provoke his children to the point
[3:50] with everything else something wrong
[3:59] with that because God is giving you the
[4:03] meeting over that hole and when you're
[4:04] in your position as a father
[4:09] son of God you can be quiet the Holy
[4:12] Spirit can you say what's the truth and
[4:18] you leave it at that
[4:19] you say what but but the word says even
[4:23] if that not hear about the word to take
[4:25] control in the situation well it's the
[4:28] same thing in anything that we do we use
[4:31] that as an example but here you are in
[4:33] the church listen God has placed
[4:35] trustees in the church
[4:37] they've been anointed to do the work
[4:40] that God has has described as what a
[4:45] trustee does in the Church of God and
[4:48] when that person understands their
[4:50] position and states in their position
[4:52] during doing that and God blesses it God
[4:56] gives somebody somebody needs God gives
[4:58] them and the same thing with a deacon
[5:00] safety with the pressure whatever it is
[5:02] whether they're in their position right
[5:05] God gives the right inspiration and
[5:08] gives authority in that decision so it's
[5:12] the mind page it's it's not the mind age
[5:16] it's the supernatural intelligence age
[5:20] witches now brother grabbed people's
[5:22] audiences now then when the dot-com
[5:25] he opened the seven seals and revealed
[5:27] the evening like taking all the
[5:30] mysteries that
[5:39] [Music]
[5:49] [Music]
[5:58] [Music]
[6:04] [Music]
[6:11] [Music]
[6:28] [Music]
[6:48] [Music]
[7:01] [Music]
[7:15] it's not so much
[7:34] [Music]
[7:47] that could never change and so now he
[8:03] says he says justification under new
[8:19] sanctification that's pulling his bride
[8:21] out he's creating his bride
[8:24] justification under another
[8:25] sanctification of the recipe and so
[8:28] forth you see he evolution of the Spirit
[8:31] being given more and more because the
[8:35] body is building coming to the head
[8:37] which is Christ the body of Christ
[8:40] now what Moses would have come to
[8:42] brought those message
[8:50] [Music]
[8:56] he says it would not work and I think
[9:00] Jesus message had worked every word of
[9:04] Moses and neither the Wesley's message
[9:07] every word in movement or Luther's
[9:11] message vice versa and today we are the
[9:14] last Reformation was Pentecostal and
[9:18] today we're moving for that and the
[9:21] Pentecostal message will mix with this
[9:24] because it's another day and that's why
[9:27] you know when you go sometimes you start
[9:30] the culture for some people and all
[9:32] their stock on hope you didn't save the
[9:34] way the Prophet said it's because don't
[9:38] get me wrong here and don't think that
[9:41] you know they they're not right
[9:44] they might very well be practical
[9:46] there's a dispositional change here it
[9:50] just like someone left on the other side
[9:52] of Jordan
[9:53] they were ordained and given their
[9:56] position and the portion of land on that
[9:58] side of Jordan not on this side just
[10:01] like leaders of pride just like Wesley's
[10:04] right just like that kind of gospel
[10:05] right that came up through the message
[10:08] of William Branham they'd have a place
[10:12] in the World Cup but those that
[10:14] recognize their thing and its message
[10:17] are feeding on something that is
[10:21] different you can't interpret it you
[10:25] can't put an interpretation up into
[10:28] supernatural experiences it just it just
[10:30] happens and so that's why you for some
[10:34] reason
[10:35] start talking you makes it those for an
[10:38] hour we both feel that connection it's
[10:41] because this is a different disposition
[10:44] and you're receiving something that is
[10:47] policing you into your part of the world
[10:51] your part is different everybody's got
[10:55] apart from each dispensational age is
[10:58] going to lead up to the rapture of the
[11:00] church and so here not he says that
[11:05] neither the Jesus message typically will
[11:06] smother busty and today be our last time
[11:09] Reformation was better than today or
[11:12] moving through that and the gospel
[11:15] message mix with this and that's right
[11:22] the message so covenant church is now
[11:28] going to another transformation and
[11:31] there's there's a change because the
[11:33] revelation is moving on the progression
[11:36] of the word is moving up and it's
[11:39] naturally going to leave both behind
[11:41] there that can't be see this it's just
[11:44] as simple as that okay
[11:46] and not like you can't interpret that
[11:49] because it's another day it will mix
[11:52] it's all the Word of God but it's
[11:54] building like the feet arms coming up
[11:56] forming a bride for the rapture
[12:00] Halloween I'm going to bypass a lot of
[12:05] this just goes down
[12:08] oh that's musicians come there's so much
[12:16] actually you know what
[12:20] I'm not going further because this next
[12:24] stage when I started eating this I
[12:27] started and it's so excited because
[12:32] remember asked misters we want that farm
[12:36] talk we want that that chain of thought
[12:38] you want that revelation that that
[12:40] excites us that lights up something
[12:43] inside of us that gives us the
[12:44] inspiration and the confidence and the
[12:46] courage the mystery of the story that's
[12:49] how he's doing it in the final mystery
[12:50] that's why somebody come up here and
[12:52] they they got their own agenda or
[12:54] whatever they were afraid for it will
[12:56] not feed the church not the future I
[13:00] just won't do it but there's so much in
[13:04] here and you know if you get a chance
[13:06] read the the seals will back to be the
[13:10] seals again read the breach between the
[13:12] seals the first church the first seal
[13:14] the second third reading reading they're
[13:16] having this bottom line of how God is
[13:19] progressing the word and giving you
[13:21] faith for a rapture and how how it's
[13:25] actually taking place and bringing you
[13:27] to a place where you'll actually start
[13:28] to know how to apply the word what to
[13:34] actually do
[13:35] the word because brother Kraft said that
[13:37] this will
[13:47] [Applause]
[13:59] [Applause]
[14:12] [Applause]

[14:23] spear an empty formerly breathe into its
[14:27] nostrils the breath of life and I will
[14:31] be able to be sold under the new
[14:36] creation using the Duster here to here
[14:41] but crowd you bag to walk again and
[14:49] through the ages like a brother
