good amen so tonight we're going to continue along um with the series that we've been uh looking at it's uh part of the rapturing faith series seeing my part in the word of God and tonight we're just going to look at an aspect uh we're going to title it in Heavenly places and we're going to look at um this aspect of our position in Christ and how it is that we are now moving in this realm of faith that has given us perfect Faith to receive everything that we have need of in this hour to overcome all that lays before us amen praise God Ephesians chapter 1 we can go to the first slide before we do let's pray father we so appreciate Lord this opportunity tonight to fellowship with you Lord to allow your word to move into our hearts and our lives and search and and uh dig up the things Lord that we want to let go father because this is certainly a time for the church to let go and leave all the old baggage behind father because we have a journey before us oh God that is beyond human understanding but yet your word said that we shall be changed changed and we shall be caught up together to meet you in the air Lord and so tonight we ask that we can move in that realm Lord where you can come and just uh speak to our needs Lord uh we just so appreciate and love you and uh Lord we can't do anything um greater you've already done the greatest in our lives for giving us faith and allowing us to see this message of the hour and sending us a prophet and giving us such uh grace and mercy oh God that we can keep pressing on Lord bless your people oh God anoint the speaker anoint the hearer tonight Lord we just completely surrender ourselves to you for service now in Jesus Christ name amen praise God Ephesians chap 1: 3-5 it says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundations of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will praise God you may be seated amen praise God we've been looking at uh seeing our our part in the word of God and you know the last uh service we were looking um we were looking at uh uh the book of Corinthians and how the Lord um has identified that we are each uh part of the body in particular we all have a unique placing within the word of God we all have a place that God is uh uh giving us uh Faith because we've all got a portion of Faith to fulfill the purpose and the plan of God in our personal lives and so God is calling each and every son and daughter of God into their place now he's calling us into uh into place uh to the attention of the word for this day and this hour and what it is that he wants to fulfill and we know that the great plan and the fullness of the plan is the rapture for the church now the next major event is the rapture of the church and we can see by the events that are going on in the world and the conditions we know that before the world goes into Absolute Total Chaos and tribulation the bride goes up in the Rapture and so we read in Ephesians where it talks about that that um that God is right now perfecting Ephesians chapter 4 through the five-fold ministry God is perfecting the Saints and bringing us into the fullness of Christ what does it mean to come into the fullness of Christ it is to actually come each and everyone in their position into a revelation that the body of Christ is now present on the earth com coming into its fullness through the unity of the revelation of the word amen and once this this body comes into the fullness of Christ which is Christ like we heard on Sunday uh Adam and Eve they were they they they were one they were of the same substance when God created Adam called their name Adam Eve was actually Jesus Christ but she would just expressed in in female form God was expressing his female aspect his female attribute through Eve amen praise God and so as we come into the fullness of Christ in this day then the bride Eve has to come to her rightful position in Christ we just read the scripture that that the all the spiritual blessings in Heavenly places are in Christ we've been given this position next slide listen to brother brandom he says Heavenly places oh how I wish I had time here I've got it marked right here in my Bible about Heavenly places what is Heavenly places Heavenly places just for a moment is the believer's position in Christ where the believer stands in Christ in Heavenly places praise God so it's in Christ that we come into our fullness so that the body can come into its perfect revelation of the unity of Christ and when that takes place we get translated but a lot of people are putting that that uh fullness of Christ and that Unity of Christ they're putting it somewhere into the future I want to say tonight that we're in Heavenly places right now that we're in Christ right now we need to come into that revelation of who we are right now we can't be putting it into a future event you see that's the problem everybody's always praising God for what he's going to do and they're praising God for what he's done but they fail to recognize what it is that he's doing right now let's go to the next slide in the book of Philippians it talks about now keep it in mind that that we're we're talking about coming into the unity of the faith and coming into the fullness of Christ okay but we need to realize that in that position there's a lot of benefits and we as Sons and Daughters of God you know a lot of us are because we're putting it off into a future event or past event we're missing the authority that God has given us now as Sons and Daughters of God to fulfill the word of God and to do the things that he wants us to accomplish in this day listen here he says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God listen Jesus Christ let's get this straight okay because that's one thing that 95% of the denominational Christian teaching out there believes in the trinitarian doctrine we need to make that one thing straight right here right now Jesus Christ is God Jesus Christ Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament unless you have a revelation of who God is there is no way that you can rightfully take your position and have the authority as a son or a daughter of God in this day and in this hour and you will be living a a an underprivileged life you will find yourself in a defeated condition you'll find yourself uh you know that that when you come into an emergency you're crying out to God or or or a situation comes up you're you're crying out to God and you're and you're and you're pleading for God to to to heal or to change the situation when he's telling us that we are joint HS in Christ that we are actually in the body in Heavenly places right now and you've got the authority right now and that when you when you approach Jesus Christ in prayer you should be approaching from the aspect of a relationship that you've got a personal relationship with him and that and that you you're you're seated together and that he can be pleased with your character listen he says thought it not uh being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men listen we need to also stay Bal balanced we are attributes of God we are Sons and Daughters of God but yet we're still only human and so we need to recognize that element but by faith and by Revelation and knowing that we're still in this world we still got to overcome we still got to deal with you know self and pride and all the things that this that this human uh vessel will try to you know uh um exalt itself and make itself something you know because that's the world that we're living in now that you know everybody wants to be somebody everybody wants to be known everybody wants to be the you the top dog but that's not the way he came and that's not the way he's going to leave it's going to be so humble and so simple that when the Rapture goes most of the world 95% of it is going to actually miss it what a Time and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross everything that was required has been paid everything wherefore God also hath highly exalted him he's talking about Jesus Christ now now this is where we need to pay attention and giving him a name which is above every name that is at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in Earth and things under the Earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father Hallelujah he has placed his body he has placed Jesus Christ in Heavenly places above every Power every Dominion there is no other name whereby man must be saved it's as simple as that and that's why there's no other religion but Christianity that is going to produce salvation everything else goes into the tribulation everything else goes into the a the the other aspects of the Fulfillment of the scripture whether it's the tribulation or whether it's Israel the 144,000 Moses and Elijah all of those things but right now what we're looking at is our position and the importance of us knowing where we stand in the authority that God has given us in our position listen it says here note in the verses that we just read or actually we're going to read the next we just read okay let's go to um Ephesians 1:1 19-23 next slide right and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the Heavenly places when Jesus went to the Cross everything was fulfilled he said it is finished so there's no more sacrifice required there's no more sacrificial Lambs required not for the Gentile church not for anybody that come into the realization that Messiah has already come fulfilled the purpose and the plan and has given us full Redemption everything that was required has been completed and we need to only recognize that once we are in Christ then we are fulfilled listen here what it says uh in verse 21 far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filth all in all Hallelujah so where are you where where are you situated tonight as a son or a daughter of of God if you're seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus then you've you've been given an authority you've been given a position you've been given overcoming power to deal with every circumstance every situation so that when you come into your position as you find yourself naturally finding your position within the body of Christ you're actually completing the body of Christ Christ and as the body is complete it comes into its fullness and when it comes into its fullness which it already is because it was a finished work in Jesus Christ then all authority and power is given to the body of Christ and if you're in the body you've got that Authority you've got that power amen praise God glory to God so here so it says here God raised Jes Jesus from the dead and set him above all principality so no power No Dominion no principality every demonic influence of sickness and and oppression and depression and what whatever Spirit tries to come and hinder your walk it's already under your feet as the as the Church of Jesus Christ everything that that that you need to overcome is already in you to overcome if you are in Christ in Heavenly places Hallelujah so he says they say God set Jesus far above not just above but far above all principality power might dominion and every name that is named so your position in other words if Christ seating in the highest position in the universe in all that is his name is above every name in this world above below there is no place where he is not supreme authority Hallelujah glory to God and so if he seated in the highest position where are you seated as a True Believer and an attribute of God where are you seated tonight are you seated in that uh with confidence seated in that position as a son or a daughter of God Amen far above every Power what is your position because you're in Christ so you need to ask yourself like don't just say oh I'm a Christian we're way ahead of that we're Way Beyond that Saints everybody's claiming to to you know there's so many people claiming to be Christians out there but God is going to vindicate and and truly show what what what it is to be a Christian in this day and in this hour and you need to be in Christ Hallelujah listen what he says and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses go to the next slide and sins wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience that spirit is so powerful in this day and in this hour Saints the spirit of Disobedience it does not want to submit to the spirit of God it does not want to submit to the word of God Amen it doesn't want to accept that God sent us a 20th century Prophet it doesn't want to Humble itself it wants to exalt man it wants to exalt their teaching man's man's uh intellect you know but because of the doctrines of man like Jesus when he came up against the Pharisees he says because of your traditions because of your teachings you've made the word of God of none effect to the people to the point where they rebel against the word when the word is presented to them but he says here where in in time past you walked in that same fashion you were under that same uh influence of the of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in Mercy Hallelujah for his great love wherewith with he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace are you saved you see that's you know Paul put that right in there by grace are you saved not to exalt and to think that you deserve this you didn't deserve it it's because you were with him before for the foundations of the world you were in his thoughts you were expressed into this into this age you were the last age thoughts attributes that God had to call in this day and in this season and and it's Saints it's just it's just Grace it's just Amazing Grace you didn't do anything to deserve it I think back and I say Lord how in the world did did I you know have this this grace that would come into my life but you can't help but see the word of God the way you're seeing it you cannot deny the word of God you can't you can't deny that you see it clearly in the scripture when Jesus said I will send you the comforter and he will guide you into all truth and then you try to say to somebody you need the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost comes by obedience to the word of God it comes by by by you initially like listen you don't you don't earn the Holy Ghost you don't work you don't do Works to get the Holy Ghost it's something that you were from before the foundations of the world but when the word comes to you it awakens that attribute within you it awakens so it allows your you know it it's hard to to put words to it but but it's a divine revelation to where your conscious mind and the mind of God connect and the mind of God is that attribute that you are are remember you are a part in the fullness of Christ you're in the body of Christ that means you are a portion of God you are literally a portion of God and so all that happened while you were in this human vessel is you came into a conscious understanding of your position as a Son of God as an attribute of God and that Enlightenment LED you into all truth all of a sudden you're you're able to recognize the truth you're able to see the eror you're able to see that God is not three in one God is one here ye oh Israel he made it clear to Israel that's why Israel one of the main things that Israel you know rejects the Gentiles is because of their trinitarian Doctrine because they believe in three in one no he said here he oh Israel the Lord is one and until that that foundation and that Clarity is in you as a son or a daughter of God you will be walking underprivileged you'll be walking you're not walking with Christ you're walking with man's tradition man's Doctrine man's teaching a church is teaching but you're not walking with Christ but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us hath made us alive has quickened us has has uh uh moved us into Heavenly places quickened us together with Christ by grace are you saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus hallelujah praise God let's let's read this uh quote here brother brandom he says but the real ordained of God that real Gene that real germ a soul of God that was in God before the foundations of the world remember you that's really got the spirit of God in you tonight you were here in Christ because he was the fullness of the word he was the fullness of the godhead bodily God was in Christ do you hear that God Elohim the self-existent one the only one and true God was in Christ reconciling the world to who himself to himself so God was reconciling the world to himself he wasn't it wasn't another being or another person person or reconciling it to somebody else we just finished reading that Jesus Christ was exalted and placed at the right hand which is the power of God Amen look at when Jesus was speaking to Nicodemus he says you know like no man has has descended except he that has ascended he that has descended has ascended and he's he that's standing right here right now he's still there he was trying to explain things to Nicodemus who was already in a state of confusion that God was standing right there before him speaking to him but he could not recognize it Hallelujah he was the fullness of the godhead bodily God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself do you believe that look he was in Christ than if you were in God a gene a word an attribute from the beginning then you walked with him here on Earth you talked with him on Earth right now you're having fellowship with Jehovah Elohim the self-existent one in your life every single day that when you you know when you're when you're you got to get your relationship right when you're praying you're praying all day long if you're a son or a daughter of God prayer is communication with God that's what prayer is it's communing with God it's Walking with God but yes we do have moments and times where we go into prayer we pray for the sick occasions emergencies all those things but it's only still an expression of your relationship you're seated with him in Heavenly places you're seated above the principalities the power Powers the dominions the prince of the power of the air you're seated above all of that and you need to take your Authority in your position and speak the word of God not not in a way that that you're pleading and you're you're you're you're crying out and oh you have to do this and that's not a relationship when my children used to come to me and and scream at me and you dad you got to do this you got to do that for me you have to buy me this you have I said what that's not the kind of relationship but when they commune with me and they're talking with me and they're talking about bikes and they how they love bikes and how they love to you know ride and how then I'm seeing something and all of a sudden I want to buy them a bike I want to buy them a good bike I want to give them the best you see that's how God wants to have that kind of a relationship that that that we can have that kind of a relationship not not out of fear not out of fear because you know when when when when my you know children are going to come to me and they're and they're going to and they're going to come to me shaking and I can see in their eyes that they're that they're fearful because maybe I'm G to uh you know because they think I'm going to react in the wrong way and I'm looking at them so relax what is it well God is looking at us and he wants us to have that kind of a relationship with him we're seated with him you're communing with him here on Earth you suffered with him on Earth you died with him at Calvary everything that that that he did remember Eve was a part of Adam she was bone of his bone flesh of his flesh she was taken from the very substance we are no different we are from his body we are bone of his bone flesh of his flesh we're going to be looking at all of that as we continue along in this little series here but here he's talking he says you suffered with him on Earth you died with him at Calvary and you Rose with him again and now you're setting Where in the Heavenly places with Christ you see do you see that position now why you know we pray and we think oh you know we need brother Anthony and brother Mike and the song leaders and the musicians you know to to to create an atmosphere that's exactly what they're doing they're creating an atmosphere so that the Holy Spirit Heavenly places is not somewhere up in the sky that's the other thing you know you've got to bring it all right home Heavenly places is right here we're right now in Heavenly places communing with the the word of God fellowshipping around the word of God I know God is speaking to certain situations and certain ways and the way that we have a relationship with God he wants us to have that kind of a relationship now where we mature we we we're entering into a level of maturity you know like when when you first you know it's that first love he wants that first love but he wants it in maturity he wants it in humility he loves humility he God hates Pride did you know that God hates pride and you know that pride is one of the the the worst enemies that we have because Pride wants to exalt this oh God is with me God does this for me God does that I can do this and I can do that because God no that's not the kind of character that Christ is looking for he's looking for a humble spirit that knows the relationship that believes that relationship knows that that God can't lie listen if he says I'm Jehovah Rafa that means he's going to heal all our diseases when he says I'm Jehovah Nishi he's going to fight every battle for you no matter what and if he says I'm Jehovah Gyra then you can believe and trust that God is going to provide all your needs and when you get all frustrated and you get you know where oppression comes down and depression tries to you know stumble you and and get you to a place where you're discouraged he is Jehovah Shalom that can give you peace but it's all the same God hallelujah communing with him setting together Heavenly places in Christ communing communing with him a listen communing with him the word what is it that we're feeding on tonight the word what is it that we're exalting tonight right the word we're not exalting a man we're not exalting a Doctrine we're not exalting a teaching we're exalting the word it's always been the word it's always going to be the word as it feeds into your soul because man shall live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God hallelujah praise God Amen praise God forever more so when we read here's here's another you know when we read Ephesians 2 here's another version but God being rich in Mercy because of the intense love which he bestowed on us caused us dead though we were through our offenses we were listen we were we were lost in sin we were caught in sin and you're still at times going to get trapped by sin did you know that you heard it God is God saved us but the blood of Christ is continually saving us keeping us making a way for us so that we can get back up because the enemy he's always going to throw a punch he's going to knock you down but Jesus Christ said I'll be with you even in you right through to the End Amen praise God and so even while we were through and dead through though we were through our offenses to live in Christ is by grace that you have been saved raised up with him from the dead and enthroned us with him in Heavenly Realms as being in Christ not with Christ not with it didn't say with Christ It said In Christ there's a difference you see if you're in Christ when the enemy comes and tries to smash you with with a blow he's got to get through Christ to get to you he has to overcome Christ before he can get to you and there's no way because he's seated far above he's seated far above every Power every principality that's why when we stay anchored in the word of God when we continue to feed on the word of God when we continue to listen to the tapes and feed on on on the on the messages that brother Brandon brought nobody nobody spoke the way he spoke other than when Jesus Christ was here on Earth and the messages and the supernatural that took place around his life God was vindicating that Supernatural not to exalt William Branham it was to exalt his word because the signs and wonders always follow the word amen praise God we we acknowledge William brandham we we recognize the Fulfillment of Malachi 45 we wouldn't even be talking tonight or even quoting these these uh these quotes if we didn't have the message of Malachi 45 to come and restore the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers we wouldn't have a message but the message has always been Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is now coming into his fullness where do you fit into this we know where brother bradam fit into it but where do you fit how do you fit into the plan of God how is it that you're going to be translated and changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye you need the revelation of the Rapture and the revelation of the Rapture is not in a man it's in Christ hallelujah praise God that's what we need to recognize the unity and dra bringing us together in the unity of the faith that is Christ in the in the five-fold ministry moving and and feeding and edifying and and building and placing and positioning so that you can come into the unity and the fullness of Christ remember it's when the fullness of Christ when when it all comes together we go up the body needs to be completed we are now in the in the final stages of completing the body of Jesus Christ Hallelujah glory to God so God enthroned us with Jesus in Heavenly places God meaning the prophecy the word the the the the the the from that he that he planned from before the foundations of the world he had a plan he had a Plan of Redemption and that Plan of Redemption included you and I to be enthroned in Christ Christ to be placed in Christ in this day and in this hour because it's only in Christ that we can if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you how's it going to dwell in you unless you are in him he says on that day ye shall know that I am in the father ye in me and I in you all that was in all that God had he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into who the church which is what the body of Christ the church is the mystical body of Jesus Christ but it's in it's in female form this is the bride Ministry now we this is Christ in his bride Ministry we need to recognize the ministry that we are under and how important it is remember it's always been the word when Jesus came to the Earth the the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us he is the same yesterday today and forever so in order to to recognize where Jesus is today you need to recognize where his spirit is what his spirit is doing who are who are in who are uh uh uh filled with that Spirit under subjection to that spirit and allowing his Spirit to live through their lives amen praise God so so he enthroned Us in Heavenly places does that sound like a church that's defeated if you're in Heavenly places does that sound like like a church that that that's going to that's going to diminish and fall apart not if we've got a revelation that we're in Christ and every part that's in that body is coming into the unity of the faith this church should become a powerful light for Jesus Christ to draw it says if we lift up Christ if we raise him up it'll draw all men unto him this church is going to grow by the grace of God it's going to grow because those that are in the body are alive they're they're living organisms and they're feeding and edifying the body and when somebody comes into a living body that's healthy they're going to feel that Health they're going to feel the wealth they're going to feel the joy that's in that body they're going to feel the welcoming Spirit that's in that body that's why we don't we don't want crabby Christians grumpy Christians no we don't need Grumps there's something missing when somebody's grumpy now I understand some people when they don't get their sleep and they get up too early in the morning they're a little grumpy that can happen okay I I'm I got to watch I need to get my sleep and I encourage you to get your sleep I've said that many times when you get proper sleep you you feel better you feel healthier and you are a happier person don't be getting caught where you're staying up Beyond 12 1 2:00 in the morning you get into that habit before you know it you you're not going to you're not going to be at your Optimum you need to get your proper sleep and so the body of Christ it recognizes what what it needs it recognizes how it edifies how it encourages and how it builds you know one with the other amen glory to God it's not a defeated church let me have a drink praise God no God designed the Church of the Lord Jesus to be triumphant because we are partakers of Christ's Victory when he went to the cross and defeated the enemy we defeated the Enemy by his stripes we are healed we're we're already healed that's why when sickness comes into your body you've got to realize listen I don't care about the the effects of it I listen I I don't like it nobody likes the pain nobody likes the effects of sickness but regardless God is Jehovah Rafa that Health all my diseases and we must stand on that regardless of the of what the enemy tells us regardless of the doctor's report we do the things that we know we should do if the doctor says go get therapy go get therapy but by his stripes I'm already healed I got to go and take a a Tylenol bu his stripes I'm already healed that Tylenol is dealing with this flesh but the attribute of God it cannot disbelieve God's word and that attribute is what's surfacing in this hour it's the one that's taking over it's remember he wants the preeminence you go back and listen to Christ the mystery of God revealed God wants the preeminence in the body how does he get the preeminence in the body it's when you when you claim his preeminence when you say by your stripes I am healed Lord regardless of this sickness regardless of this pain regardless of this this moved disc in my back or what whatever it is regardless of what it is we still cannot change the the the absolute which is the word of God he says I'm the Lord God that heals all he didn't say some he said all so we claim it and we wait until it's done if it takes the Rapture to do it well praise God let it be that's fine with me but if he wants to do it right now in the name of Jesus let it be done all you got to do is receive it because you're in the body you're in in Heavenly places you're he's he's over every Power and every principality he's over every sickness he's over every demon power that would try to oppress you and depress you and and bring you down you've got to stand in Christ Jesus where he's placed you Hallelujah and claim the word of God Amen because the believer is in Christ when Christ sat down the believer sat down with him far above principalities and Powers the church the body of Christ is in Christ the body is connected to the Head Jesus is the head of his body the church that's why he had to come down in 1963 it's all part of the plan Saints the head that's why when you go back you look at the cloud in 1963 it was on Sunset Mountain the sun had to come and set on the body that's what he was doing he was coming because he said there's no way that they're going to in that human understanding until I go down there and just remember all it is is that Christ came down to call those attributes that were ordained to be in this age okay so when he was coming down the head was coming down it was coming to meet with those attributes but those attributes happen to be in human bodies and so that's why we assemble ourselves you know oh I don't need to go to church I don't need to be in the church I can just watch it online yeah you can but let me tell you there is a difference when you come into the church and you are personally present in the church you get into that atmosphere of the word and the Holy Spirit starts moving down through the pews and all of a sudden this one receives a healing this one receives a a Deliverance this one gets depression and oppression leaves the body what is it it's the power of God because the body is a living body we are the we're going to look at a lot of different quotes not tonight but I've got a lot of quotes that's going to show you that you are actually the Flesh and bone of Jesus Christ you are the body that that that's coming together the attributes are in there but the body is physically coming together and they're meeting together because remember at some point this Mortal body shall be changed how's that going to happen oh no it's no but no that's just you know I don't need I don't need the the the the caral body no no you do need it while you're here in this Dimension and while your attribute is in this dimension in this body it's going to Quicken it's going to line upon line precept upon precept here a little there a little in the power in the midst of the Holy Spirit he's going to come down and he's going to deliver you and he's going to change you he's going to Quicken you he's going to lift you out of that unbelief that's holding you down that sickness that's got a hold of you one just all it takes is one word from the Lord to speak to that thing and it's done over because he's still a miracle working God we are not dealing with a natural God we are not dealing with Pagan Idols we don't put Idols up and go and bow down before them we don't do the 14 Stations of the Cross we don't believe in any of that stuff we go to the to the source which is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen hallelujah glory to God the church if Jesus the head triumph over the devil is the body of Christ to be less triumphant since we are in Christ absolutely not if he overcame every devil and you're in Christ and you've overcome you've already overcome you're already healed you're already at peace you already got shalom in you you're already uh uh provided with all of your needs all everything it's in God's Storehouse it comes to you exactly when you have need of it amen praise God hallelujah of course not it's our legal right to enjoy joint seating with Christ in Heavenly places in a position of authority and Triumph far above all principalities and powers and and if you will take advantage of your joint seating now now now taking advantage of your joint seating you know what taking advantage of your joint it's feeding on the word it's knowing that you're seated with Christ you're in Heavenly places the Holy Spirit surrounds you and you can feed on the word and everything you're feeding on is line upon line precept upon precept here a little there and you're being changed you're being transformed in the moment amen praise praise God hallelujah praise God the believer's position and seating in Christ it's a fact and it's already happened he hath that's a past tense word it's not something that's coming Saints that's why we need to get our perspective right we're already in Heavenly places we're already enjoying the benefits of as a son and a daughter of God we don't need to live underprivileged we can leave here tonight Victor glorious in the word of God to know that God tomorrow is going to I'm going to walk right into all my needs I'm going to walk into my healing I'm going to walk into my peace I'm going to walk into a fixed relationship with with this individual or that boss or one of my children whatever it is because God is is the God of Peace he's going to bring peace to my life Hallelujah I'm going to claim it all glory to God Amen you don't have to try to be seated in in Christ you are seated in Christ you don't have to try oh I got to I got to do this I got to do that no we're beyond that now this is not about the law it's not law that's going to save you it's your revelation of who you are in Christ and that you're seated with him that is your Authority that is your position when the queen gets called to sit next to the king in the palace that Queen is is is in a seat of authority she's recognized she's looked upon and she and when she speaks all the servants they obey her because she's under the king she's under the leadership of the king and the King has placed his seal upon her life hallelujah praise God they don't have to pray through to be seated with Christ oh Lord I need to be seated with you I need need I need this Lord and Lord I need you to heal that's not the relationship we should have when we pray it's not how loud you pray it's not how long you pray it's not how how eloquent and you start bringing scripture and this and that and oh it just sounds so wonderful it's your relationship and when you have a relationship and your son comes to you and he's sick or your daughter comes to you and they're sick and you're laying hands upon that child you are laying hands and you represent Jesus Christ to them not to make yourself Jesus Christ not to make yourself God I I I have this Authority that's not the character remember the only thing that we're going to leave here with is character Christ is looking for character he's looking for the right kind of attitude that can take that power that he's given and allow it to be expressed because of the relationship you are as to pray over that child you go there and you say father I'm so thankful for that relationship Lord that you've promised by your word that by your stripes we were healed Lord we were there with you we we're so grateful for this Revelation that you've placed in our hearts in the name of Jesus Christ be whole and walk away you don't have to get into all a screaming match and everything else there's times for that when demons start to act up and and you've got to pray and you've got to fight those powers and those principalities and you've got to deal with them there's times and seasons for everything but initially I'm just trying to con convey that relationship that that that we want to have in Christ amen we're seated in in Victory with Christ the believer's position and seeding in Christ it's a fact it's already happened the position was attained and was given to us and as we wind it down now when a Believer gets the revelation of their position in Christ it makes all the difference in the world it changes everything they'll no longer be def you will no longer be walking defeated some days how's it going well it's the weather's terrible and you know like like negative you got you got to be careful of your speech how you doing not bad oh so bad but not so bad do you see what I'm saying we're we're we're we're like we've come into a place where we're in Christ and God has given us authority to speak the word of God but we need to do it by relationship and so when somebody says how are you doing wonderful by the grace of God doing well the Lord is providing the Lord is good now you're not going to be overly religious when you're at work well praise God hallelujah brother the Lord's good you need the Holy Ghost don't you know if you don't get it you're going to hell that's not Christianity either doing fantastic doing great how are you you're looking good today you know like you're you're you're projecting you you have the ability to change atmospheres for uh with people around you even children whatever it is you carry an atmosphere hallelujah praise God so what is it you're you're you're you're you're aware of your position you're aware that you're walking in Heavenly places you're aware that you're in Christ amen and that all things are possible to them that are in Christ Jesus glory to God because of our position in Christ God is the strength of our life in the books of in the Book of Psalms of whom shall I be afraid Psalms 271 of whom shall I be afraid we we're not to be fearful Christians we're not to be living by fear we're not to be making Decisions by fear we're to make them by by Common Sense first of all and we always got to have an element of common sense to all of our decision making but understand that as a son or daughter of God you can believe in the Supernatural you can believe in miracles don't look at the circumstance and think well this ain't going to work out right because of this this because of that no don't look at it that way look at it this way it'll work out for good yeah all I know is that this situation is going to work out for good because I'm in Christ I'm in Heavenly places and everything that comes into my life it's going to have to work for good it can't work against me because he's for me hallelujah praise God he said what shall I we don't have to be afraid of anything including Satan demons evil spirits because Christ gave us the victory at the cross amen the body of Christ triumphant church we are what more than conquerors because we're in Christ being in Christ makes you more than a conqueror amen you've got Supernatural Grace amen glory to God our joint seating and ruling with Christ is the climax of The Redemptive work this this is all going to climax this is the great final uh part of of bringing the body together and finishing the body of Christ amen let the musicians come this is this is our part this is where Redemption comes into its fullness because remember he's only redeeming those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life our names were sealed from before the foundations of the world and he's come to redeem those glory to God Jesus exalted Hallelujah not only that but all Dominion Authority and power was put beneath his feet and because we are his church they're also beneath our feet it's as simple as that and we are the body of Christ we are the last true church did you know that we're the last true church we're we're in the last true church age after this it goes into into a totally different dimensional change we go into the Millennium 1,000 years of Peace Hallelujah but God is finishing up that last final church and that literal Body of Christ is going to fulfill the Rapture and when the Rapture takes place this the rest of the world goes into total chaos let's go to the to the last quote here the true church of Christ the bride is so sold out to him and his promised word till the very mind that's in Christ is in you that's that's where that's where we've come Saints we need to we need to allow the word to fully penetrate within our lives and accept it that's Christ in you what a difference and we find today that the modern Church a modern World Church the modern World Church and also the spiritual church are both pregnated to give birth to Sons one of them a denominational birth is going to be give one day to these days at the World Council of churches will which will produce the world the Antichrist which is going to come out through denomination all right that's exactly the truth I may not live to see it I believe I will but you young people remember that you heard a minister say that that'll finally wind up and this is the mark of the beast when she forms the World Council of churches this is all in full progress right now Saints okay it's all going into the World Council of churches but there's another body that's been pregnated by the word of God Amen the other look here here it is the other so that finally winds up and that is the mark of the beast the World Council of churches and she'll give birth to the son the Antichrist the other is pregnated by the word of God and will bring forth now listen here the body the finished body of Jesus Christ which is the bride the body of Christ isn't finished yet listen what what he saying here how many knows that a man and a woman is one and Christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes the one body again which is Jesus Christ in Heavenly places seated with his bride Hallelujah like Adam was at the beginning man his wife are are one now she the true bride so sold out to him that she used no mind of her own his mind of course in his will and his will is his word praise God she doesn't take compromise to anything else he's Jehovah Rafa my healer he's Jehovah Shalom he's my peace he's Jehovah Gyra he's my provider he's Jehovah uh Nissa he's he's the one that fights every battle for me I'm seated with him why should I live any different and live underprivileged when he made that promise to me may God bless each and
