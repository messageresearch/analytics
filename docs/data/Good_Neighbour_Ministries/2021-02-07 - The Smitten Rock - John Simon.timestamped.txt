[1:12] him
[1:13] god bless us all as i read from the word
[1:17] of god
[1:18] the book of numbers chapter 20
[1:23] reading from verse 7 to 11
[1:28] and the lord spake unto moses saying
[1:33] take thy rod and gather thou
[1:36] the assembly round about you
[1:41] and aaron thy brother
[1:44] and speak ye unto the rock
[1:48] before their eyes
[1:51] and it shall give forth his water
[1:56] and thou shalt bring forth to them
[2:01] water out of the rock so that
[2:04] thou shalt give the congregation and
[2:08] their beasts to drink
[2:12] and moses took the rod from before the
[2:15] lord as he commanded him
[2:18] and moses and aaron gathered the
[2:21] congregation together
[2:22] before the rock and he said unto them
[2:28] here now you rebels
[2:31] must we fetch you water out of this rock
[2:35] and moses lifted up his hand and with
[2:38] his
[2:39] rod he smote the rock twice
[2:43] and the water came out abundantly
[2:48] and the congregation drank and
[2:51] their beasts also praise
[2:54] god hallelujah
[2:58] let us pray a gracious heavenly father
[3:02] we thank thee for the reading of the
[3:05] word
[3:06] we pray that the great holy spirit
[3:10] the heavenly dove will
[3:14] rest upon us find a resting place
[3:18] within our hearts and speak lord

[3:28] lives be changed may your name be
[3:31] glorified and lifted up father

[3:38] in the name of jesus christ to the glory
[3:42] of god
[3:42] amen praise god hallelujah
[3:47] amen praise the lord
[3:51] now we realize we are
[3:54] coming into we have come into
[3:58] a great wonderful and marvelous
[4:01] age spoken of by
[4:05] the prophets and now by the
[4:08] prophet of this marvelous 20th century
[4:14] and we realize that the age we are in
[4:18] is no longer a pentecostal age
[4:23] the church has come through the seven
[4:26] church
[4:26] ages as have been prophesied
[4:30] and spoken of in revelation
[4:34] chapters one through three
[4:39] and we know that now we are
[4:42] no more in the pentecostal age
[4:46] for luther changed to
[4:49] the lutherans changed the methodists and
[4:52] then god started
[4:53] working with the methodists and then
[4:56] finally
[4:57] the pentecostals came out of the
[4:59] methodists
[5:00] god started working with the
[5:02] pentecostals
[5:04] but our god has marched on
[5:08] and now pentecost modern day pentecost
[5:11] i'm speaking of
[5:13] is one essential mess
[5:17] it is a cesspool of sin
[5:21] thank god this is not
[5:24] the pentecostal age
[5:28] this is the bride age
[5:32] this is the rapture time age
[5:35] for the rapturing people with a
[5:38] rapturing
[5:39] faith that have hearts open to receive
[5:42] the
[5:43] rapturing grace from god in heaven
[5:46] amen all things have been pointing
[5:51] to this marvelous time in this great
[5:55] hour down through the years
[5:58] many patriarchs prophets
[6:02] saints apostles longed for this hour
[6:06] amen they long for this day that they
[6:10] could be here
[6:11] in this age when they did not
[6:14] necessarily
[6:15] have to die but that they
[6:18] could be changed by god's
[6:22] power to transform
[6:25] oh my glory to his marvelous name
[6:29] how that the great holy spirit
[6:33] promised in this age through the apostle
[6:36] paul
[6:37] you shall not all sleep
[6:40] which means you shall not all die but
[6:43] some will be changed in the moment
[6:48] in the twinkling of an eye glory to god
[6:52] that is god's supernatural rapture
[6:57] the taking away of his
[7:00] bride as a thief
[7:03] in the night praise god
[7:06] i take him for the hour of the body
[7:10] change
[7:11] i thank him for this season
[7:15] of the catching up so we may be caught
[7:18] up
[7:20] in the presence of the living god
[7:23] hallelujah
[7:24] amen thank god
[7:27] we could be alive now an age
[7:30] of great truth and revelation
[7:34] but at the same time it's a great
[7:37] hour also of deception
[7:42] satan is now coming to the maturity
[7:46] of his deception
[7:49] and seduction my glory to god
[7:53] hallelujah thank god that god has
[7:57] raised the standard for when the enemy
[8:00] comes in like a flood god promised
[8:04] he would raise up a standard against
[8:07] them
[8:08] god has raised up anointed men and women
[8:13] anointed with the truth
[8:17] hallelujah praise god one may have an
[8:20] anointing
[8:21] and it may be wonderful spectacular uh
[8:24] attractive
[8:25] but listen to the voice listen to hear
[8:29] the truth
[8:30] the revelation coming from
[8:34] the word of god hallelujah so god has
[8:37] imparted to his church
[8:40] gifts of men anointed
[8:43] to bring forth amen anointed with the
[8:47] holy spirit
[8:48] with god-given ability to bring forth
[8:52] the revelation of god's word
[8:54] for this hour and to keep
[8:57] god's people lined up
[9:01] straight with the word of god
[9:05] for this day and for this hour
[9:08] i know paul said
[9:12] that there will be a great falling away
[9:15] and i know many will fall to the wayside
[9:19] especially in this hour cove it around
[9:23] plagued the realm sickness around
[9:26] a job no job nor this
[9:30] problems troubles tribulation trials
[9:34] and god has taken his people as it were
[9:37] in a wilderness and he said as i took
[9:41] israel out to try them and to prove them
[9:45] to see whether they really are were his
[9:48] people
[9:49] glory to god so is god allowing
[9:52] the same thing happening to us
[9:56] today amen so many are falling
[9:59] badder wayside
[10:03] giving heed to seducing spirits like eve
[10:06] did in the garden listening to that
[10:10] vile seducer speaking
[10:13] into her mind oh
[10:17] and departing from the word of god the
[10:20] tree of life
[10:22] whoa paul said to us perilous times
[10:26] shall come
[10:27] i believe we are living in those
[10:30] perilous times right now
[10:33] and that jesus said they'll be so
[10:35] perilous
[10:37] unless he shorten the days because of
[10:41] the
[10:41] evil and darkness that will be covering
[10:44] the land
[10:45] except he shortened the days no flesh
[10:48] would be raptured no
[10:49] flesh would be taken out from this place
[10:53] hallelujah so we realize as the old song
[10:56] says
[10:57] trouble sometimes are here filling men's
[11:01] hearts with
[11:02] fear freedom we all hold dear
[11:06] now is at stake humble your heart to god
[11:11] saves from the chastening rod seek the
[11:15] whip pilgrims trod
[11:17] christians awake oh jesus
[11:20] is coming soon morning or
[11:24] night or noon many will
[11:28] meet their doom trumpets will sound
[11:33] all the dead shallow rise
[11:36] righteously in the skies
[11:40] going where no one dies
[11:43] heaven word bound
[11:47] amen praise god i know sometimes
[11:51] it seems like if we appear to the people
[11:55] as if we are
[11:56] fanatic and that we are like
[12:00] old-fashioned and the reason why
[12:04] is because most of the sacredness
[12:08] of from the word of god and the age in
[12:11] which we live
[12:12] has been taken away by the acts
[12:17] uh and the lives of the people
[12:21] in the scripture which we read
[12:26] god told moses to take up
[12:30] his rod and take it with him
[12:34] behold i will stand before thee upon the
[12:37] rock
[12:38] hallelujah thank god the same holy
[12:41] spirit
[12:42] will stand on the same rock the same
[12:44] revelation
[12:45] you have i have the true saints have
[12:48] god will stand on his word heaven and
[12:51] earth
[12:52] will pass away but his word will never
[12:55] pass away amen praise god hallelujah
[12:59] my friends i want you to know that that
[13:02] rock
[13:04] was not just a boulder or a granite
[13:08] or a mass of rock only in the wilderness
[13:12] it was but it was a symbol and a
[13:15] type of jesus christ for in
[13:19] first corinthians chapter 10
[13:22] paul speaks of that rock reading from
[13:25] verse one to six
[13:26] he said our fathers at manna in the
[13:30] wilderness
[13:31] they drank from that rock in the
[13:33] wilderness
[13:35] and that spiritual rock was
[13:38] christ hallelujah so christ
[13:42] was the rock in the wilderness
[13:45] i'm thinking of an old song jesus is the
[13:48] rock and the weary land
[13:51] the very land a weary land
[13:54] jesus is the rock in the weary land
[13:57] he's a shelter in the time of storm
[14:01] yes jesus was and is that
[14:05] rock in a weary land
[14:08] of trouble and trial amen
[14:11] hallelujah praise god and
[14:15] it's so significant that
[14:18] israel went into the wilderness
[14:22] it was the same month that jesus christ
[14:25] himself
[14:26] was crucified upon the cross
[14:29] that they went in to the wilderness
[14:33] oh praise god hallelujah
[14:36] now friends remember in the beginning of
[14:40] the bible
[14:41] jesus christ was smitten in the
[14:45] form of a rock in the wilderness
[14:49] for the people to drink from that rock
[14:53] and to have shelter and shade
[14:56] from the heat of their troubles and
[14:58] trials the heat of the sun
[15:01] the heat of what was going on around
[15:04] them
[15:04] they could find shelter in his
[15:08] shadows oh praise god hallelujah
[15:11] i'm so thankful to god my friends
[15:15] that when we don't know what to do we
[15:18] can come to jesus christ
[15:20] and find shelter in him
[15:23] in our time of storm praise
[15:26] god so just as the rock
[15:30] was smitten in the wilderness jesus had
[15:34] to be
[15:35] smitten also that he could be recognized
[15:40] that he was that rock that was
[15:44] in the wilderness amen
[15:47] and for three and a half years he was
[15:51] smitten
[15:52] by the leaders of the jewish nation
[15:56] the rabbis the great teachers
[16:00] the great pharisees the sadducees
[16:04] the libertarians the libertines the
[16:08] epicureans
[16:09] many others that were there in that
[16:13] hour or in other words the theologians
[16:16] of that day they looked at him
[16:20] jesus the word and they
[16:23] kept criticizing finding fault
[16:27] marking his mouth every little word he
[16:30] spoke every action that he did
[16:33] they were ready to put their criticism
[16:36] upon it not knowing they were smiting
[16:39] the rock
[16:41] for three and a half years you were
[16:44] smiting the rock
[16:46] until finally he came to the kel
[16:50] golgotha's hill climbed the hill
[16:53] they hung him by his found him up there
[16:56] to die
[16:58] and there the bible says he was struck
[17:02] and there he died for our sins
[17:06] and our salvation pouring out what
[17:10] pouring out his life from him
[17:14] water from the rock type of day
[17:18] or symbol of the word of god
[17:21] pouring out of him praise god
[17:25] so that if that woman
[17:28] that was at the well would have been
[17:30] there
[17:31] i don't know if she was but if she was
[17:34] there
[17:35] she says oh this is the well that we
[17:38] really should drink from
[17:40] oh this is the rock where i can drink
[17:43] from the waters and i will never
[17:46] ever thirst again oh thank god
[17:50] he jesus was the word made flesh
[17:54] and in him was the blessed
[17:57] holy spirit of the living god
[18:00] and the only way that we could get
[18:04] uh the living waters
[18:07] of the holy spirit to pour
[18:11] out of him amen he
[18:14] had to be smitten or crucified
[18:18] so that the blood life could flow
[18:21] out of him and be made
[18:25] available for us to be able to receive
[18:28] it
[18:29] within our hearts and with our lives
[18:33] brother william aaron branham the
[18:35] prophet of this 20th century
[18:38] oh praise god called him
[18:41] the bloody bleeding lamb the bloody
[18:45] bleeding word the word that's
[18:48] bleeding the word is always pouring out
[18:51] revelation

[18:54] understanding

[18:58] god hallelujah that his loved ones
[19:02] could believe could receive him and
[19:05] believe him
[19:06] he is the bloody bleeding lamb
[19:09] that took our place oh ah

[19:16] thou dying lamb thy precious blood
[19:20] shall never lose its power till all the
[19:23] ransom

[19:28] more oh dear dying lamb thy
[19:32] precious blood hallelujah oh praise
[19:35] god friends at the cross
[19:38] at the cross where i first
[19:41] saw i first saw oh
[19:45] i received my sight and then
[19:48] the word was opened up to me praise god
[19:52] that's where i first saw the light and
[19:54] the light from god's word the
[19:56] understanding the revelation
[19:58] from god's word flashed before me my
[20:02] eyes were opened
[20:03] and i could recognize who i
[20:07] am and where i come from and where i'm
[20:10] going
[20:11] i'm not just a pig or a dog turned into
[20:14] a sheep
[20:15] i was always one of his
[20:18] own from before the foundation of the
[20:21] world
[20:22] i am only now recognizing
[20:26] who i am and who my father is
[20:31] he only use my earthly father and mother
[20:35] to bring me here but my real
[20:38] genuine father is up above
[20:42] hallelujah and i recognize my father
[20:46] i respect my earthly father love my
[20:48] earthly mother
[20:49] but that's the great real father of us
[20:52] all praise god hallelujah oh
[20:55] my my my praise god amen
[20:59] paul said we should be washed by the
[21:02] water
[21:03] of the world oh may the word of god wash
[21:06] me cleanse my mind
[21:08] renew my spirit just make me a new
[21:12] creature in christ
[21:13] by the washing of the water of the word
[21:16] of god hallelujah
[21:18] how can you be washed by the water of
[21:21] the word
[21:22] smitten why was the rock smitten
[21:25] so that it could open up the way was the
[21:29] words written
[21:30] that it could open up that it could
[21:32] reveal itself
[21:34] and we could recognize god in
[21:37] his word hallelujah amen
[21:41] for us to be able to get the benefits
[21:46] the blessings the privileges
[21:49] uh to become noise of the word
[21:53] and to recognize the day in which we
[21:56] live
[21:58] they theologians the doctors of
[22:02] letters of religion the dds llds phds
[22:07] whatever
[22:08] listen education is not bad it's good
[22:11] right
[22:12] it's good as long as it's surrendered to
[22:15] christ
[22:16] that paul said i count all my knowledge
[22:18] and he was the wisest man of his day
[22:20] i counted dull and ash that i might
[22:24] win christ hallelujah oh praise
[22:27] god my brother sister it's wonderful
[22:30] when we see here how god allowed these
[22:34] different groups back their
[22:38] fantasies uh pharisees and so on
[22:41] the various denominational groups as
[22:44] well as their great theologians
[22:47] to reject the word smite the word so
[22:50] that and the jews to reject the
[22:54] word and reject him and turn away from
[22:57] him
[22:57] so physically and spiritually
[23:01] so that we could recognize who he was
[23:05] because it was by their smiting their
[23:08] rejection
[23:10] and their pushing him the word away from
[23:13] them
[23:14] that opened up the opportunity for us to
[23:17] become
[23:18] beneficiaries when the life
[23:21] came out of him
[23:24] they drove him out from their midst
[23:27] but he came to me oh take god
[23:31] i said that drove him the word out of
[23:34] their midst
[23:35] but he came to us thank god he came
[23:38] looking for a woman by the well
[23:41] he came from the danielle he came over
[23:44] there for
[23:45] james he came for peter
[23:48] glory of god he came for sarah
[23:51] he came for darkness he comfort
[23:55] all those ones whose names were
[23:58] in that lamb's book of life many others
[24:01] they were right there and the holy
[24:03] spirit had come for them
[24:05] and so he crawled out to his own
[24:08] amen and praised god by smiting of that
[24:12] rock it opened up and seven seals gushed
[24:17] out of that
[24:18] the revealing of the word and the
[24:22] inspiration the will of god
[24:26] filling up your soul and pouring out the
[24:29] word for this hour to the hearts of them
[24:33] that we believe amen hallelujah
[24:36] oh praise god hallelujah somebody
[24:39] had to hear it before they
[24:44] could reject it my friends
[24:47] hallelujah a person does not
[24:51] is not a blasphemer just because
[24:55] they reject the bible a person is not a
[24:59] blasphemer
[25:01] because they walked away
[25:05] from the message the individual
[25:09] commits blasphemy of the holy ghost
[25:12] and crucifies him afresh within their
[25:16] heart and life by sitting
[25:20] sitting listening to this
[25:23] open revelation
[25:26] amen being preached and explained
[25:30] in its simplicity purity
[25:34] clearness to them and then to
[25:37] turn around and call it false doctrine
[25:42] and walk away from it they commit
[25:45] blasphemy against the great holy spirit
[25:49] yes my subject is
[25:52] the smitten rock i spoken on this
[25:57] i'm speaking on it and will speak on it
[26:00] again
[26:02] isn't it strange that everywhere that
[26:05] israel went the bible said
[26:09] the rock was present with them
[26:12] everywhere that israel went the bible
[26:15] said
[26:16] the rock followed them in the desert
[26:20] reminds me mary
[26:23] had a little lamb the lamb
[26:26] was white as snow and everywhere that
[26:30] mary went
[26:31] that lamb was sure to go
[26:34] oh thank god just the same way my
[26:38] friends that rock followed israel
[26:40] everywhere they went
[26:43] you me true
[26:46] elected believers who knew
[26:49] they couldn't tell what was the
[26:51] difference with them
[26:53] they thought something was wrong with
[26:55] them why
[26:56] were they seeing things from a different
[26:59] angle
[26:59] than most everybody else but you see
[27:03] that was the rock being with you
[27:07] and everywhere that mary wet the
[27:10] land the lamb was sure to go everywhere
[27:14] israel went the rock was sure to go
[27:18] and everywhere the true elected bride
[27:21] goes
[27:22] whether she knows who she was or she
[27:24] didn't know who she was
[27:26] that rock is sure to go and then it will
[27:30] open up and the truth the revelation
[27:34] the refreshing waters of life will flow
[27:37] out of it i'll praise god to inspire
[27:41] to anoint her soul and to bring her
[27:44] into a relationship with the lord jesus
[27:47] christ
[27:48] of course that river that that rock that
[27:51] followed them in the wilderness
[27:53] was that a rock that they could carry
[27:55] around
[27:57] and this is not something you can go
[27:59] into a school and go study it and carry
[28:01] it around with you
[28:03] is that something you can pack in a
[28:05] briefcase
[28:07] yes my friends this rock is a

[48:24] and denominations knew
[48:27] they would not have criticized and
[48:29] condemned
[48:30] this message of the hour because little
[48:33] did they
[48:34] know it's like a man stomping on a

[49:22] believe the opening of this word
[49:25] amen and have caught the revelation of
[49:28] that la
[49:29] this last prophet's message they would
[49:32] not do it amen thank god
[49:36] in our day
[49:39] again there was a smiting
[49:44] and the seven seals have been opened up
[49:47] to us
[49:49] amen and with that what happens
[49:53] immediately after
[49:57] the smiting of jesus christ on calvary
[50:01] the burial then there had to be a
[50:03] resurrection

[50:12] people who are
[50:12] carriers of the word the word
[50:16] lives in them they are now
[50:19] experiencing and will be experiencing a
