[31:52] everything
[31:53] what god has done for us
[31:58] what we're doing is nothing to what
[32:00] compared to what he has done you can't
[32:01] pay him back
[32:03] yeah so just a privilege
[32:06] that he has called us to be his students
[32:08] and daughters of god and
[32:10] we have his attributes as sons and
[32:12] daughters of god that see this in us
[32:14] so we thank god for that and without
[32:17] wasting much time
[32:19] today's bible says i'm gonna be reading
[32:21] a lot
[32:22] i'm not good canadian so you gotta just
[32:26] take it like that you're gonna be fine
[32:28] whatever god wants you to hear you hear
[32:30] it
[32:32] amen praise god
[32:34] um our first scripture from matthew 5
[32:37] verse 11 to 16.
[32:48] okay
[32:50] i think it's on the bottom
[32:53] blessed ie
[32:55] when men
[33:00] when men revile you
[33:03] and persecute you and shall say all man
[33:06] of evil against you falsely for my sake
[33:09] verse 12
[33:11] rejoice
[33:13] and be exceeding glad for great is your
[33:16] reward in heaven
[33:18] for so persecutedly the prophets which
[33:21] were before us
[33:24] ye are the salt of the earth but if the
[33:27] sword have lost its savour
[33:29] where will shall it be salted it is
[33:32] handful good for nothing
[33:34] but to be cast out and to be trodden
[33:36] under foot of men
[33:39] ye are the light of the world a city
[33:42] that is set on a hill cannot be hit
[33:46] neither do men light a candle and put it
[33:49] under a bushel
[33:50] but on a candlestick and you give it
[33:53] light onto all the eye in the house
[33:56] resistant let your light so shine before
[34:00] men that they may see your good works
[34:03] and glorify
[34:04] your father
[34:06] which is in heaven so when they see your
[34:08] good race they will glorify god in
[34:10] heaven so the glory is not for you
[34:13] it's for him and then matthew 7 24 to 27
[34:19] next stupid
[34:25] therefore whosoever hearing these saints
[34:27] of mine
[34:29] endure them i will liken him onto a wise
[34:32] man which built his house upon a rock
[34:35] that means on revelation of the world
[34:38] um
[34:39] the next race
[34:41] and the rain descended and the flats
[34:43] came and the winds blew and beat upon
[34:46] the house and fell not for it was
[34:48] founded upon a rock upon revelation so
[34:51] no matter what comes against the
[34:53] individual is not gonna
[34:56] push him around
[34:58] and everyone that hears this thing of
[35:00] mine and shall do them
[35:02] not shall be likened unto a foolish man
[35:05] which built his house upon the sun that
[35:08] is just intellectual there's no
[35:10] revelation behind that and the rain
[35:12] descended and floods came and the winds
[35:15] blew and beat them
[35:17] that house and fell
[35:19] and grit was a fall of it let's pray
[35:22] oh our gracious eternal god
[35:26] we are so grateful for this evening that
[35:30] we can come to thy throne of grace
[35:33] oh god of abraham isaac and jacob i ask
[35:36] for forgiveness if i've offended
[35:39] be in any way shape or form by thought
[35:42] or indeed ask forgiveness for my
[35:44] brethren oh god that you have that
[35:46] confidence that your blood or god's
[35:50] your blood of christ cleanses from all
[35:52] unbelief so you come to the electron
[35:54] boldly knowing that you hear us if our
[35:57] heart condemns that's not oh great
[35:59] eternal god i pray that you come and
[36:02] feed us give us a fresh word from your
[36:04] presence that at present stage turns out
[36:07] help your children i pray oh god that
[36:09] close my lips
[36:11] from saying anything that you do not
[36:13] want me to say
[36:15] may you help me to get myself out of the
[36:17] way so that you can speak to your
[36:20] children
[36:21] i take every spirit under my control
[36:24] made a great holy ghost heart prominence
[36:27] and bless your children as they hear
[36:29] your voice
[36:30] amen and amen please be seated
[36:34] yeah so i'm going to talk about these
[36:36] two scriptures um
[36:38] first is matthew five
[36:40] from twelve to sixteen and then my two
[36:42] seven twenty four
[36:44] we said that let
[36:46] your light so shine
[36:50] so that um
[36:57] let your light solution be forming that
[36:59] they may see your good race and glorify
[37:04] and glorify your
[37:05] father which is in heaven
[37:07] and
[37:09] paul
[37:11] described the faith of abraham
[37:14] as
[37:15] he
[37:16] when he was given account of abraham he
[37:19] gave that by faith abraham
[37:22] because the faith is what god and
[37:25] peter talk about west
[37:29] both of them are right
[37:31] because
[37:32] um
[37:35] paul talk about what god saw in abraham
[37:38] so the faith that you have
[37:41] will be seen by god and when you put
[37:44] that faith into works
[37:46] other human being said
[37:48] so the fed i was in abraham when it was
[37:51] manifested
[37:52] it produced rest
[37:54] and that's what peter was saying the
[37:56] works of abraham
[37:58] so
[38:00] if
[38:01] you have that seed of god in you and
[38:04] this word has been fully revealed to you
[38:07] and that faith of god in you
[38:09] it will bring forth it's my sorry my
[38:12] topic is what life are you reflecting
[38:16] that's my title what life are you
[38:18] reflecting so if that life of christ is
[38:21] in you and you are part
[38:24] of that chinese
[38:26] um
[38:27] paper
[38:28] that life will project outside
[38:31] effortlessly
[38:33] and people will see it
[38:35] and they will long to be like you
[38:38] amen it's not anything that you are
[38:40] putting up
[38:41] that your life will reflect christ
[38:45] but
[38:46] um
[38:47] unfortunately
[38:50] the
[38:52] christian world or so-called
[38:54] denomination people
[38:57] they have
[38:58] twisted the word of god
[39:00] and they have projected christianity
[39:03] in the eyes of people which is contrary
[39:05] to the word of god not only the letter
[39:07] but revelation everything
[39:09] so when you talk about christianity
[39:13] people have different perception
[39:15] of who a christian has to be
[39:18] but when that word is really revealed to
[39:21] you
[39:22] they will know that there's something
[39:24] different about you
[39:25] you are
[39:26] special among all the people they can't
[39:30] touch your life
[39:32] they'll know there's something about you
[39:33] but they can't
[39:35] explain it
[39:37] and always
[39:39] it's
[39:40] in contrast with the denomination world
[39:43] recently i just met a man
[39:46] i knew that he was a pastor we were just
[39:48] talking in terms oh
[39:50] i didn't tell you i want to do that i'm
[39:52] a pastor and have
[39:54] studied in canada for four years to get
[39:56] my education
[39:57] as if
[39:59] the education is the absolute for the
[40:01] word of god
[40:03] and i was trying to tell that it's good
[40:05] that you have gone to that bible college
[40:07] there's nothing wrong with the bible
[40:09] college to get whatever you have got the
[40:12] paul said that you count all of them as
[40:14] ashes
[40:15] you have to have the revelation of the
[40:17] word of god
[40:19] the education is good
[40:21] for natural substances
[40:24] but not when it comes the word of god it
[40:26] has to be revealed to you
[40:28] without revelation you can never please
[40:31] god
[40:32] amen that's why the whole church word is
[40:35] messed up they're missing the exact
[40:37] ingredient they're right and now bring
[40:39] them to god they don't want to have
[40:41] nothing to do with it
[40:43] so they have intellectualized it
[40:46] and make it education and make it
[40:48] programs
[40:50] and everything but programs is good
[40:53] don't get me wrong
[40:56] but programs should not do it
[40:59] you are the billboards of christ
[41:02] you are the advertisement
[41:04] when people see you they see jesus
[41:06] christ
[41:07] that's why i said what life are you
[41:09] reflecting
[41:12] because they're billboard
[41:13] yes
[41:14] if that billboard normally in this
[41:17] life now
[41:19] the advertisement is just to
[41:22] um
[41:23] what do i say
[41:24] the advertisements
[41:27] to
[41:28] for your senses and what they're
[41:30] advising most of them is
[41:32] just to entice you it's not the right
[41:34] thing
[41:35] the
[41:36] advertisement comes to your eyes and
[41:39] some of them are deceiving a deception
[41:42] but if somebody sell their product
[41:45] like if you have a pure gold you're not
[41:48] going to be scared for somebody to test
[41:50] it
[41:51] because you know it's quality
[41:54] but
[41:55] so if you are a true christian
[41:59] your life
[42:01] reflect christ
[42:03] you are the billboard
[42:06] you are the
[42:07] the main thing
[42:09] that people are about measuring christ
[42:11] by because remember
[42:14] in this time he has no mouth by your
[42:16] mouth
[42:17] he has no hands by your hands
[42:21] what life are you reflecting
[42:24] are you living a different life from the
[42:27] church eyes than what is reflecting on
[42:30] you on the job site
[42:33] is are you living everyday christian
[42:35] life
[42:36] or when you go to school it's a
[42:38] different life and when you come to
[42:40] church a different life
[42:42] the only animal that uh do is that's a
[42:45] camouflage
[42:46] he can just
[42:48] go here and fit here fit your bed a dove
[42:51] or a dove only eat
[42:56] fresh food eagle eater fresh food and a
[42:59] dog also cannot eat on dead substances
[43:03] and is there a crow that could eat the
[43:06] death substance and need the nice one to
[43:09] let a dog
[43:10] eat
[43:11] only the good one you cannot digest it
[43:15] so if you say
[43:18] that you have met god
[43:20] and the life of christ in you
[43:23] that has to automatically reflect
[43:26] effortlessly it doesn't mean that you're
[43:28] not going to make mistakes
[43:30] in your flesh
[43:31] because this place is for the devil has
[43:34] had to do with it
[43:36] so we're not looking at the flesh that
[43:38] god is looking at your desires
[43:41] so don't condemn yourself when you make
[43:43] mistakes
[43:44] he always gonna have that with you but
[43:47] at the same toking
[43:49] if that life is reflecting in you
[43:52] and you have that gold it will speak for
[43:55] itself
[43:56] amen so i'm gonna read this quotation
[43:59] now
[44:00] this is fun from let your light so shine
[44:03] um
[44:05] 6109 all three paragraph 103
[44:08] he said now
[44:10] the only way
[44:12] that the world will ever
[44:15] see christ
[44:17] is when he
[44:19] they see it in you and me
[44:24] that's the only way
[44:26] they will ever see christ
[44:29] their conscience are
[44:31] numb
[44:32] to their senses
[44:34] to the coal of the beds to the leaves
[44:38] and the grass and the flowers
[44:41] and the music
[44:42] and the message and so forth that we
[44:45] enjoy
[44:46] after we have found christ
[44:49] but until we got to a place that we
[44:51] display christ
[44:54] now remember that each one of you
[44:58] from tonight on
[45:00] tonight
[45:01] remember
[45:03] you are god's
[45:04] bill balls
[45:07] and you are god's advertising
[45:10] agents
[45:11] now the world will look at you
[45:15] to see what
[45:16] christ is
[45:18] so we don't want to smear a block
[45:22] a big lot
[45:24] of stuff on there
[45:26] that testified by things that we really
[45:29] are not
[45:31] first be that
[45:32] then when we be that then the world will
[45:34] see christ in you and in me
[45:39] so
[45:41] it's you and me
[45:43] reflecting christ to the people
[45:47] so
[45:48] when you become a christian you have to
[45:50] watch
[45:51] our work very well
[45:54] because sometimes your
[45:56] attitude
[45:57] your the way your character sometimes
[46:00] that will show outside
[46:01] it can push some people away from the
[46:04] gospel
[46:05] or it can bring people to christ
[46:08] so you have to do your part
[46:12] saving
[46:13] was god's advertising
[46:15] agent
[46:17] he advertised the billboard
[46:20] he didn't do any miracles
[46:23] but his life testified of jesus christ
[46:27] so that he was even willing to give his
[46:29] life
[46:30] when the time came for them to kill him
[46:32] he said you uncircumcised
[46:35] you speak like you say you're
[46:37] circumcised in the heart you have killed
[46:39] the prophets
[46:40] and the people were so mad
[46:43] but you know what
[46:45] out of about five thousand people
[46:48] that killed seven
[46:51] only one
[46:53] that led to god death on the side paul
[46:56] and he became
[46:58] he was the apostle that did the rest so
[47:02] once you live in the life of christ you
[47:04] don't know
[47:06] whom your life will touch
[47:09] whom will come to christ down the road
[47:13] so your every step every action that's
[47:15] why i put christ always before my face
[47:20] but you cannot do all that without
[47:22] having that seed of god because when
[47:25] that part of chinese is in you
[47:27] it reflect by itself effortlessly
[47:30] it's not you trying to
[47:32] be a christian it's not you meditating
[47:35] how to live
[47:37] that life will project itself
[47:38] automatically
[47:40] and if it's in you
[47:42] then it will be abraham says somebody if
[47:44] you say you got it
[47:45] and your life doesn't reflect it go back
[47:48] and check your relation something might
[47:50] have been wrong somewhere
[47:52] amen so we have the life of christiness
[47:56] we are the god advertising billboard
[47:59] so we have to watch our work we want to
[48:02] watch
[48:03] our life because
[48:06] all
[48:07] we are living in the end time
[48:11] and
[48:13] we
[48:15] as god's children
[48:17] our life
[48:18] has to be testing because when it talks
[48:20] about advertising
[48:22] if someone advertise something maybe a
[48:24] drink or a car
[48:26] and at that very moment i'm looking for
[48:28] a car it won't attract me
[48:31] if i'm hungry and i see people of
[48:33] advertising that is going to attract me
[48:37] but if somebody is advertising a car
[48:40] i don't care about it
[48:43] so when you live that life of christ
[48:47] and someone that have a seed of god in
[48:50] him
[48:50] who is thirsting after righteousness
[48:53] will long to be like you
[48:56] because your life is reflecting christ
[48:59] something that he lacked
[49:01] i was told i was talking to this mother
[49:03] when i was not a christian there were
[49:05] certain things that i said oh man i wish
[49:08] i'm a christian but this thing no way i
[49:10] cannot live this life
[49:11] but i told him when god called me it was
[49:14] the easiest thing for me to do
[49:16] why because it wasn't me
[49:20] something has taken place inside of me
[49:24] when something takes place inside of you
[49:26] it's no more you
[49:28] amen the things i used to do i do them
[49:31] no more
[49:32] no one that is adjusting they ask you
[49:36] for um caribana that taste is gone
[49:40] because you have become a new creature
[49:43] amen the old sister johnson is no more
[49:45] there he's dead
[49:47] he's crucified
[49:48] amen
[49:50] he died daily but when he came to the
[49:53] lord jesus christ the old person dead
[49:55] so when the devil tries to knock there's
[49:58] no entry for him anymore
[50:00] amen that place is full of jesus
[50:03] amen we're not going back amen we're
[50:06] going forward we're marking towards the
[50:08] high color of christ believing those
[50:10] things that are behind
[50:12] all the drugs every reliever will be
[50:14] walking across the high colon of christ
[50:16] that's the sage that we are living now
[50:19] amen all those things doesn't attract us
[50:22] anymore it has no pull on the son or
[50:25] daughter of god the taste of what has
[50:28] lost his hold on you
[50:30] it has no pull on you anymore because
[50:33] there is something else pulling you the
[50:35] true gene of christ the true seed the
[50:38] attribute of christ that is the new is
[50:40] pushing forward and pushing all those
[50:43] negative things away amen and is pushing
[50:46] they want to come out fully and display
[50:49] the quality of christ
[50:51] so that the world will testify
[50:53] that this people has been with jesus
[50:56] amen that's the emphasize
[50:58] the emphasize is not how much you can
[51:01] read it's not how much you can
[51:04] do miracle how much you
[51:06] can use the latin and
[51:10] everything and how
[51:12] beautiful your your room your churches
[51:14] or how
[51:16] wealth or this that you have they
[51:18] emphasize
[51:19] that what's in the bible is it the
[51:22] people saw that they have been withdrawn
[51:25] jesus christ because that life will
[51:28] project through you
[51:29] amen and some one time
[51:32] peter you wanted to deny christ but he
[51:34] said that your speech even deny you amen
[51:38] praise god so if you're a son or
[51:40] daughter of god
[51:42] you cannot help it
[51:44] but to reflect the lord jesus christ
[51:47] amen even when you're a child before i
[51:49] become a christian certain things that
[51:51] you do people like myself i was just
[51:53] thinking about it
[51:55] as a young woman you finish high school
[51:58] you go to a place like drinking bar to
[51:59] drink and smoke and then some people
[52:02] come say you bob natus they call me bob
[52:05] you are not a smoker
[52:07] you are not a drinker they come and
[52:09] point you just the way you even hold it
[52:11] doesn't mean that you are you you are
[52:12] good at it
[52:14] unconscious they're always telling me
[52:15] because i was trying to fit in
[52:18] but
[52:20] you consider you an oddball
[52:23] but something has what you're gonna see
[52:26] yourself that you're out but certain
[52:28] things you don't fit into that
[52:30] you are a stranger and pilgrim in this
[52:32] world
[52:33] amen we are not from here
[52:36] so our actions doesn't reflect earthly
[52:38] people
[52:40] our actions reflect the heavenly jesus
[52:43] that's why we are reflecting
[52:45] amen hallelujah
[52:47] praise god
[52:49] i as the sun reflect the silence we
[52:51] reflect the sound of god amen
[52:53] that's our reflection
[52:55] amen we have no choice hidden in
[52:58] our god is good
[53:00] all the time praise god hallelujah
[53:04] so
[53:06] just imagine
[53:09] brother paul
[53:11] brother
[53:12] peter and john
[53:14] when they came from
[53:17] about three days from pentecost
[53:20] and they saw this man
[53:22] who was crippled from 40 years
[53:25] but abraham explained
[53:27] that
[53:28] that man
[53:30] was asking money
[53:33] maybe to
[53:35] buy clutches
[53:37] so all that he was asking he was doing
[53:40] that to say can get banished you can
[53:41] walk by clutch or something
[53:43] so when
[53:46] peter and john
[53:48] told him that silver and gold had
[53:50] violent
[53:51] he said that the man was disappointed
[53:54] but behind the eye
[53:57] sparkling eye
[53:58] of an old pirate and a young john he saw
[54:02] something different about them
[54:05] so is you and me
[54:09] people sometimes can't figure you out
[54:13] they see something
[54:15] about you
[54:16] something special
[54:19] something that they cannot describe
[54:22] and they long to have that
[54:24] so the man long to have
[54:26] what peter and john had
[54:29] so no one already said that in the name
[54:31] of jesus
[54:32] rise up
[54:34] and take up your crotches
[54:36] but i'm saying
[54:38] he believed that amen and he just got up
[54:41] and began to walk walk oh when they said
[54:43] that in the name of jesus sign up all
[54:47] the bulls everything begin to work open
[54:49] amen all those clutches begin to untie
[54:53] and he just walked
[54:55] but
[54:56] when the people
[54:57] recognized
[54:59] they said that
[55:01] in chapter four they said that
[55:03] the pharisees and the rest they
[55:05] recognized that john
[55:08] and peter
[55:09] were ignorant
[55:11] and unlearning
[55:13] but they realized that they have been
[55:15] without
[55:16] jesus
[55:18] so the emphasize that we have being with
[55:21] jesus
[55:22] they went to the upper room and their
[55:24] life was not the same
[55:26] and the same god that was in them god
[55:29] has not died
[55:31] amen he hasn't changed
[55:33] god that was worth and the abraham the
[55:36] same god abraham died and god was in
[55:40] jacob isaac all of them god that was in
[55:43] abraham
[55:44] the prophet died but that god is not
[55:47] dead that god is in you and me today
[55:50] he's the president thanks god
[55:52] he's the one riding the trail through
[55:54] the bride
[55:55] he took his prophet he took his sins but
[55:57] he never died
[55:59] he's in you and me
[56:01] those attributes those sons of god those
[56:03] seed
[56:05] that are ready
[56:06] those that are hazed
[56:09] they have nowhere to go
[56:11] but to obey this way because you are
[56:13] part of him
[56:16] where can we go
[56:18] no wonder
[56:19] peter said where can we go
[56:21] thou alone has or eternal life
[56:25] the rest
[56:27] came there for what
[56:31] fish
[56:33] bread
[56:34] for money
[56:37] popularity yes
[56:39] but there was something
[56:41] that peter was looking beyond
[56:43] he wasn't looking after all the gifts or
[56:45] anything he won the giver of the gate
[56:48] he saw that thou alone has an eternal
[56:52] life
[56:53] and nothing in this world can entice us
[56:55] again
[56:56] after receiving this true word of god
[56:59] you and i know that nothing
[57:02] compares to this
[57:04] that we have
[57:06] not just the letter but the revelation
[57:09] part of it the written part something
[57:12] that speaks your heart
[57:15] nothing come close to what we have
[57:19] so is this popularity
[57:22] or fame or money
[57:24] what can separate us from the love of
[57:26] god
[57:28] nothing
[57:29] amen
[57:30] we are our back is like the door is
[57:34] closed we're chatting with god
[57:36] amen chatting with god amen hallelujah
[57:41] shouting
[57:43] with god
[57:45] in the
[57:47] secret place
[57:50] there in
[57:52] the spirit
[57:54] beholding his face
[57:59] true
[58:03] to strange in this
[58:06] race i know
[58:09] to be shouting
[58:12] with god
[58:13] we are shouting with god
[58:16] amen nothing
[58:18] in this world
[58:20] can separate us from the love of god
[58:23] amen so what i'm trying to say is that
[58:26] this christian life is simple
[58:31] they have made it so much
[58:34] to the outside world
[58:36] make it so complicated
[58:39] but god through his his grace through
[58:42] our pastor has let us know
[58:44] this is so simple
[58:47] just open your heart and let god come in
[58:49] and live his life through you
[58:52] that's simple as that
[58:54] he said that he that had
[58:56] what ceased from his own race has
[58:59] entered into what his rest
[59:01] so it's no more your worst is god living
[59:05] his life through you
[59:07] and when he's living his life through
[59:09] you
[59:10] it doesn't mean that every one of us
[59:12] will be doing science and wonders
[59:14] miracles healing the
[59:16] healing the
[59:17] sick raising the dead which reminds you
[59:20] because it follows us
[59:22] we don't fight for it is that right
[59:25] but abraham was saying saying over here
[59:27] is that
[59:28] um
[59:30] what
[59:46] yeah he said that what are we to do
[59:49] today
[59:51] no matter
[59:52] we don't have to
[59:54] have big audience
[59:57] we don't have to preach to ten thousand
[1:00:01] we don't have to even preach
[1:00:05] we can be god's advertisement board
[1:00:09] how do you know that your life might not
[1:00:12] start some young man
[1:00:14] on the gospel
[1:00:17] some of you older men
[1:00:19] see
[1:00:20] old women start some young man on the
[1:00:23] floor out there
[1:00:25] will you win
[1:00:26] 10 000 souls to christ
[1:00:29] is because that he saw christ in you
[1:00:33] you that presented christ to him in the
[1:00:35] simple power of the gospel you may never
[1:00:38] see a vision
[1:00:40] you may never put your hands on a sick
[1:00:42] person and feel the charge of almighty
[1:00:45] god make a skeleton
[1:00:47] of mind turn back to life again
[1:00:50] you may never see him standing beyond
[1:00:52] that in three or four
[1:00:54] rainbows you may never see his image you
[1:00:58] may never hear his voice but still you
[1:01:00] can be a signboard
[1:01:03] that will reflect jesus christ
[1:01:06] by a life that has being so pure
[1:01:11] and
[1:01:12] unadulterated from the world
[1:01:15] not cluttered up with dirty things
[1:01:18] around your life
[1:01:19] but a pure thing
[1:01:21] that it causes a hungry heart
[1:01:24] to hunger and test to be like you
[1:01:28] amen what he's trying to say is that
[1:01:30] you may not do big miracles
[1:01:33] which it has to follow their believers
[1:01:35] you are not what tied us down
[1:01:37] when god needs to use you for a miracle
[1:01:39] he will use it
[1:01:42] he wants to use you for everything he
[1:01:43] will use it
[1:01:44] but what he strives even if you don't
[1:01:46] see that in your life
[1:01:48] you can still live a clean christian
[1:01:50] life and that people
[1:01:53] long and thanks to be like you
[1:01:55] you can witness the people that people
[1:01:57] inside your life speak more louder in
[1:02:00] heaven than your worst
[1:02:02] is a life behind the name that the
[1:02:06] demon fear and tremble the life of
[1:02:09] christ in you
[1:02:11] that's what the demons fear and tremble
[1:02:14] so he might not do all those big things
[1:02:18] but if christ is reflecting in you
[1:02:21] it will bring one soul like they said uh
[1:02:25] moody or whoever it was don't say
[1:02:28] an old lady
[1:02:30] that witnessed to hear him
[1:02:33] and
[1:02:34] that lady
[1:02:36] when she did that
[1:02:38] she didn't know
[1:02:40] that god was going to use that dwight
[1:02:42] moody to bring millions to him
[1:02:45] so the life that you lead
[1:02:49] that's what thundered
[1:02:51] that's what the demon fear and tremble
[1:02:54] and that life is the life of christ is
[1:02:56] zoey
[1:02:58] so you that are
[1:03:01] you are caused
[1:03:01] god's children you have that life
[1:03:04] it's not something that you're gonna
[1:03:06] make it up but if that seed of god in
[1:03:09] you it will reflect itself
[1:03:11] but sometimes too
[1:03:13] there's a path that you have to do
[1:03:17] if you know
[1:03:18] that you're a son or daughter of god
[1:03:22] and you don't straighten up your life
[1:03:27] you might also lose the joy of your
[1:03:29] salvation
[1:03:30] that's why the vision that restored unto
[1:03:32] me
[1:03:33] the joy of work thy salvation
[1:03:37] there are certain things our decisions
[1:03:39] bringing stress
[1:03:41] there are certain trials that god
[1:03:44] we ourself bring those things to
[1:03:46] ourselves
[1:03:48] so when you're going through everything
[1:03:49] you have to set your your heart face and
[1:03:52] see
[1:03:53] why am i going through this
[1:03:56] is it something that i have done
[1:03:59] is it my choices
[1:04:01] or is it god
[1:04:02] try me
[1:04:05] because he promised he will not give you
[1:04:07] anything
[1:04:08] that you cannot also obey
[1:04:11] everywhere is going to make a way for
[1:04:13] you
[1:04:14] so you are victorious in christ jesus
[1:04:17] you don't have to worry about anything
[1:04:20] amen all is well
[1:04:22] all is well
[1:04:24] all is well
[1:04:26] amen hallelujah all is well
[1:04:30] just relax and let god have its own ring
[1:04:34] you don't have to worry
[1:04:36] with god always will
[1:04:38] and all things are possible to them that
[1:04:42] believe
[1:04:43] amen because faith looks beyond
[1:04:46] what you can feel
[1:04:49] because from i since we are young we've
[1:04:52] been thought to go by our feelings we've
[1:04:56] been taught to go by what we're hearing
[1:04:58] we've been taught to go by what we see
[1:05:00] where god's word faith looks beyond that
[1:05:04] he only
[1:05:07] looks the word of god
[1:05:09] and as i said that my word shall not
[1:05:12] come out void
[1:05:14] unless it accomplished
[1:05:16] what it was sent for
[1:05:19] amen so this one will come to pass
[1:05:25] no matter what it will
[1:05:28] come to pass it will be fulfilled
[1:05:31] nothing can hinder that
[1:05:33] he said let every man's word be alive
[1:05:35] that might be the truth
[1:05:37] amen he's the same yesterday
[1:05:40] today and forever
[1:05:41] god hasn't changed
[1:05:43] amen hallelujah
[1:05:46] praise our god
[1:05:48] hallelujah amen and amen
[1:05:52] praise god hallelujah so i'm going to go
[1:05:55] back to that my 2 7 24 to 26.
[1:06:01] i'll read it again
[1:06:07] no man
[1:06:13] therefore
[1:06:14] whosoever
[1:06:17] hear this saying of mine and the way
[1:06:19] them are lacking unto him are lacking
[1:06:22] him unto a wise man which built his
[1:06:24] house upon a rock
[1:06:26] that rock as i said it was revelation
[1:06:30] amen
[1:06:31] so when you build your house on a rock
[1:06:34] if you read the next verse
[1:06:38] it says that
[1:06:41] the nexus and then rain descended and
[1:06:43] the flash came and the wind blew and
[1:06:47] beat
[1:06:48] upon the house
[1:06:49] and it fell not for it was founded upon
[1:06:52] a rock
[1:06:54] no under job
[1:06:56] no matter what he went through
[1:06:59] his
[1:07:01] soul
[1:07:02] his mind
[1:07:03] everything he had that revelation of god
[1:07:06] in him
[1:07:07] so because god was inside of a part of
[1:07:10] him
[1:07:11] no matter what he went through he
[1:07:13] couldn't what distracts him from self
[1:07:16] god's when the trials come when he lost
[1:07:20] his wife you lost everything you have
[1:07:22] that unconscious horse inside of him he
[1:07:25] couldn't deny his maker
[1:07:27] even unto death he told his wife that
[1:07:29] the lord take it and the lord give it
[1:07:32] blessed be the name of the lord amen why
[1:07:35] because his house was built on solid
[1:07:38] rock
[1:07:39] not on sand
[1:07:41] the only thing
[1:07:43] as we head into us
[1:07:45] towards the end of this world
[1:07:48] the only thing that will keep you
[1:07:50] if your house is built on solid rock on
[1:07:54] revelation of the word of god
[1:07:56] brabram says somewhere that
[1:07:58] all other people all everybody
[1:08:02] all those people that say they are
[1:08:04] christians they are going to be just a
[1:08:06] mimic impersonation of christianity
[1:08:08] unless those that have whose name were
[1:08:11] written in the lamb's book of life
[1:08:13] before the foundations of this world all
[1:08:16] the rest are being personated of
[1:08:18] christianity
[1:08:20] amen if your name is in that book
[1:08:23] if you are part of god's attributes
[1:08:27] nothing
[1:08:28] can shake you
[1:08:31] the trust will come
[1:08:35] the sign they said some of the roots
[1:08:37] when it gets
[1:08:39] the wind comes
[1:08:41] the root goes down more down
[1:08:44] amen so if that house is built on solid
[1:08:47] rock on the pure revelation of god's
[1:08:49] word
[1:08:50] nothing can move i believe in the same
[1:08:53] faith
[1:08:54] the same thing
[1:08:56] that apostles had the same thing that
[1:08:59] the hebrew children
[1:09:02] they have faith in god
[1:09:05] they didn't care
[1:09:07] they have revelation
[1:09:09] of god's word
[1:09:11] and they said that we know
[1:09:15] have confidence
[1:09:16] that their god
[1:09:18] is able to deliver them
[1:09:20] but even if you chose not to
[1:09:23] they are not going to bow down to what
[1:09:25] that idol
[1:09:26] amen so is a true christian
[1:09:29] so is that man
[1:09:31] a son or daughter of god
[1:09:32] that have the attribute of god in him or
[1:09:35] in hell
[1:09:37] no matter what you are going through
[1:09:41] you are going through jesus
[1:09:43] no matter what may fall may come to your
[1:09:46] way your life is in his hands
[1:09:50] he will see you true
[1:09:53] don't look at the circumstances
[1:09:57] just
[1:09:58] grounded more in the word of god asking
[1:10:01] for more wisdom if you like it
[1:10:03] more understanding more revelation
[1:10:06] on that solid rock
[1:10:08] it will pass the test
[1:10:11] amen i believe that daniel had it
[1:10:14] that's why when they put him to the
[1:10:16] lion's den
[1:10:17] even in death
[1:10:19] he won't deny the word of god
[1:10:22] amen the lions
[1:10:24] god sent an angels to come and what
[1:10:27] protect him
[1:10:29] amen so that same god daniel god is
[1:10:32] alive
[1:10:34] he hasn't dead he hasn't died he's a
[1:10:36] living god
[1:10:37] he will never die he said the lord never
[1:10:39] dies no slumber
[1:10:41] amen he said living god
[1:10:43] what we have is a real thing
[1:10:46] amen
[1:10:47] somewhere he was saying that if i'm
[1:10:50] hungry i need food
[1:10:52] i cannot be worn by painted wood
[1:10:56] painted fire you when you are coding a
[1:10:59] rail fire to warm you up
[1:11:01] you need the holy ghost
[1:11:04] which is part of you if you fight if you
[1:11:06] have it when that reinforced it will
[1:11:08] bring you to more life because every
[1:11:10] sins shall bring forth the first time
[1:11:12] you manifest whatever i see inside of
[1:11:14] you
[1:11:15] you can't avoid that
[1:11:18] so
[1:11:19] brother paul
[1:11:21] also have the same thing
[1:11:24] he met god for himself
[1:11:27] he said that i did not come to you with
[1:11:30] enticing waste with men's words of
[1:11:33] wisdom
[1:11:34] i came in the power and demonstration of
[1:11:37] the holy ghost
[1:11:38] he threw everything that he learned away
[1:11:41] and only
[1:11:43] god
[1:11:45] led by the revelation of the word of god
[1:11:47] and that revelation was so much
[1:11:50] that even peter was saying that the
[1:11:52] abundance of revelation is too much in
[1:11:54] rapport
[1:11:55] and
[1:11:56] with that revelation
[1:11:58] when the time came
[1:12:00] you can say that
[1:12:02] great
[1:12:04] where is your victory then
[1:12:07] at in
[1:12:08] 1st corinthians chapter 2
[1:12:12] he said that
[1:12:20] first corinthians 2
[1:12:33] no sorry
[1:12:35] or in first corinthians chapter two he
[1:12:37] said that
[1:12:41] my under speech and my preaching was not
[1:12:43] with enticing waste of mind's wisdom but
[1:12:46] in demonstration of the spirit and power
[1:12:49] of the holy ghost amen
[1:12:51] that your faith should not stand in the
[1:12:53] wisdom of men
[1:12:55] but in the power of god
[1:12:57] amen
[1:12:59] praise our god
[1:13:00] hallelujah
[1:13:02] thank you jesus amen
[1:13:05] praise god hallelujah
[1:13:08] yes and in first corinthians chapter 15
[1:13:11] verse 55 he said oh death
[1:13:14] where is thy stink
[1:13:16] oh great where is your victory
[1:13:20] the stink of death is sin
[1:13:23] and the strength of sin is the law but
[1:13:26] thanks be to god
[1:13:28] please give us a victory through what
[1:13:30] our lord jesus christ amen so brother
[1:13:34] paul has that faith in god
[1:13:37] that
[1:13:38] he wasn't even scared of death
[1:13:41] so is us
[1:13:43] a time is coming
[1:13:45] and it's around the corner if that's
[1:13:48] that much i was saying those people
[1:13:50] believe us in cameroon
[1:13:52] what are they going through is death on
[1:13:54] their true ukraine they're facing it
[1:13:58] we're not gonna have it a flurry bed of
[1:14:01] ease
[1:14:04] there's going to be a time and even it
[1:14:06] is since i was wrapping up
[1:14:10] and the only thing that i would stand
[1:14:12] is the attribute of god the revelation
[1:14:15] that sin
[1:14:16] that will not shake
[1:14:18] because to shake everything
[1:14:21] apart from those whose name were written
[1:14:24] in the lamb's book of life before the
[1:14:26] foundation of the world
[1:14:28] and you have the revelation of it
[1:14:31] you know what god has done in your life

[1:14:46] that came you shake a lot of people up
[1:14:49] but you are so standing
[1:14:51] why are you standing something in you
[1:14:54] is god himself keeping you
[1:14:57] he's keeping his attribute
[1:14:59] he's keeping the part of himself
[1:15:02] amen no matter what comes your way
[1:15:05] our life is the hands of jesus christ
[1:15:07] amen nothing can shake us
[1:15:11] help me no persecution what shall
[1:15:14] separate us from the love of god in
[1:15:16] christ

[1:15:46] [Music]
[1:15:48] yes sunday i just came to office and it
[1:15:50] was just right on my eye
[1:15:53] i couldn't take my eyes off on the
[1:15:55] understanding of this i said the bible
[1:15:57] said sorry
[1:15:59] ye
[1:16:00] have not chosen me
[1:16:02] but i have chosen you
[1:16:05] and ordain you
[1:16:08] that
[1:16:08] you should go and bring forth
[1:16:11] fruits
[1:16:14] and that your fruit should remain
[1:16:17] that whatsoever you shall ask of the
[1:16:20] father in my name
[1:16:22] he may not give it to you so that god
[1:16:26] has chosen you
[1:16:28] and also has not ordained you
[1:16:31] not only their ministry has obtained
[1:16:32] your part of life
[1:16:35] whatever that god has ordained
[1:16:38] for you to pass through nothing
[1:16:40] can hinder that
[1:16:43] i wanted to bring a picture that i saw
[1:16:46] somebody's post on the facebook in
[1:16:47] africa there was um at this big block
[1:16:51] like that
[1:16:52] and there was a little tree that was
[1:16:54] growing inside
[1:16:56] and the tree has best
[1:16:59] up through the truck and has grown very
[1:17:01] tall and those blocks was around that
[1:17:05] tree
[1:17:07] whatever that the enemy threw up on you
[1:17:11] what god has ordained for you to do
[1:17:15] nothing
[1:17:16] when the time comes you're gonna spring
[1:17:18] forth
[1:17:19] amen
[1:17:22] night
[1:17:24] those comes the night the light is
[1:17:26] coming
[1:17:27] light is coming amen
[1:17:30] night and job remember light is carrying
[1:17:33] amen
[1:17:35] hallelujah god is in control
[1:17:37] amen so
[1:17:39] i think i'll bring it to end by reading
[1:17:42] first corinthians chatting verse
[1:17:45] 2 verse 4 to 9
[1:17:47] i'm not going to read or just
[1:17:50] he said that i had not seen
[1:17:52] and ye
[1:17:54] had not
[1:17:55] also heard what god has in store for
[1:17:59] those that love him
[1:18:00] and you love god so there are things
[1:18:02] that god has reserved for you
[1:18:05] so i want you to live here happy with
[1:18:08] your head high
[1:18:09] knowing that god has something resolved
[1:18:11] for you
[1:18:12] i have not seen
[1:18:14] and yet i've not heard
[1:18:16] what god has in store for you that means
[1:18:18] jesus can come amen
[1:18:20] amen so whilst living here think of that
[1:18:23] that living nothing not even death
[1:18:26] can separate us from the love of god
[1:18:29] amen and yeah god has something better
[1:18:32] in store for you
[1:18:33] amen that's what i have for tonight
[1:18:36] so we just think on this
