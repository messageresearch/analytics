[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] good morning friends it's good to be in
[0:17] the house of God on this marvelous
[0:20] wonderful sunny Sunday morning in God's
[0:25] house with God's people giving glory to
[0:28] his wonderful and marvelous name let us
[0:34] pray
[0:35] our gracious Heavenly Father we ask thy
[0:39] blessing upon this a bread of life we
[0:44] ask that you will send it forth to be a
[0:48] blessing to all those that will hear it
[0:52] we commit ourselves to thee for service
[0:56] Lord may a great holy spirit rest upon
[1:00] us and walk upon the water once again
[1:04] and take glory honor and praise in Jesus
[1:09] name Amen and amen
[1:13] god bless you friends brothers sisters
[1:16] in Christ we are again speaking on the
[1:21] second part of the subject the Living
[1:25] Dead oh praise be to God the Living Dead
[1:31] and as we read out of the scriptures
[1:34] first Timothy chapter 5 verse 16 for
[1:38] she's at limit in pleasure is dead while
[1:45] she live it now this scripture is
[1:50] speaking of wanton widows loose living
[1:55] widows living for the pleasure and
[1:58] enjoyment of sin and we're told by the
[2:02] scriptures that she is spiritually dead
[2:09] while yet physically alive and by this
[2:14] scriptural understanding we know that
[2:18] anyone who live
[2:20] a life of sin for the enjoyment of sin
[2:24] is one of the Living Dead I want to
[2:30] leave your old way of life I want you to
[2:34] make a change I want you to be able to
[2:38] say I'm turning around my entire life
[2:42] and I'm going into a different direction
[2:45] today I want you to come out from among
[2:50] the dead and walk in God's purpose and
[2:57] plan for you now we mentioned how that
[3:02] All Saints Day and Halloween night are
[3:07] really pagan worship and celebrations of
[3:11] the physically dead who can never return
[3:15] to us ever again now we know friends
[3:21] that the worship of ancestors the
[3:25] worship of these so-called dead
[3:30] relatives and frames is totally
[3:33] unscriptural and against the Word of God
[3:36] for no dead person really ever comes
[3:39] back it is Satan and his armies of
[3:43] Darkness who have exploited a loophole
[3:47] in religious teaching of today these
[3:52] demonic entities are impersonating
[3:56] people's loved ones and getting people
[4:01] to believe that their loved ones have
[4:04] returned to them that's a lie from the
[4:08] pit of hell that's a lie from Satan now
[4:12] you of my friends what time is it it's
[4:16] midnight darkness covers the land and
[4:19] gross darkness and blindness is upon the
[4:23] people who cannot recognize the way of
[4:26] God because of the confusing array of
[4:30] dynamic
[4:31] nations and different thought processes
[4:33] that are propounded and place out there
[4:37] and so men on women are walking and
[4:40] doubt not recognizing what direction
[4:44] they should take it is spiritually dark
[4:48] so dark so dark as it was in the land of
[4:53] Egypt it is the church age of Leticia
[4:57] where we go from walking in bright
[5:04] moonlight right on through the ages
[5:10] predicted to walk into this age of
[5:13] Leticia of a total brat black out of
[5:17] truth understanding wisdom and the light
[5:21] of God now during this darkness these
[5:27] evil demonic walking corpses are
[5:32] everywhere roaming the earth spiritually
[5:36] dead on the inside capable of any action
[5:42] and physically there are life
[5:47] spiritually dead but physically alive a
[5:52] walking corpse roaming the earth they
[5:56] may be all dressed up with a beautiful
[5:59] dress beautiful woman beautiful man
[6:03] beautiful suit handsome man like that
[6:07] animated by a spirit of enticement and
[6:10] seduction and blind it to the Word of
[6:13] God unbelieving people unbelieving
[6:17] people like in North Day and like lots
[6:21] they we're like this all friends look
[6:25] into the Word of God where Jesus himself
[6:27] said as it was in the days of Noah so
[6:33] shall it be in the days when the Son of
[6:36] Man is being revealed again and make no
[6:41] mistake friends the manifest
[6:44] Asians of these invisible invaders are
[6:47] here among us they have moved from those
[6:52] primitive days where are of people
[6:56] falling on the ground forming at the
[6:58] mouth and and long fingernails had long
[7:03] hair and drooling and dripping right on
[7:07] down to appearing like Angels of Light
[7:10] and of respectability and acceptability
[7:15] also but I tell you the book of
[7:18] Revelation chapter 9 speaks of them
[7:22] graphically and describes these horrible
[7:26] and unimaginable evil things that are
[7:30] coming upon the earth
[7:32] read your Bible book of Revelation
[7:35] chapter 9 it tells of them all kinds of
[7:39] locusts all kinds of scorpion-tailed
[7:42] animals insects and monsters looking
[7:47] like women with hit with tear like women
[7:50] and acting like evil beasts o friends
[7:55] it's coming upon the face of the earth
[7:58] and a part of it is already here run I
[8:03] would say run people run into Jesus
[8:06] Christ and ask him for the salvation of
[8:09] your soul repent of your sins and be
[8:13] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[8:15] Christ and he will forgive you cleanse
[8:18] you and accept you as one of his own let
[8:23] us face it without Jesus Christ in your
[8:27] life you're living in a nightmare this
[8:32] world is like a nightmare and you are
[8:35] living in it right now sweating and
[8:39] screaming and one day you'll wake up
[8:44] with a shout because you find your way
[8:49] slipping and sliding down into a glowing
[8:54] fiery Devil's pit of hell right now
[9:01] he'll parts of Hell has opened up a part
[9:06] of him is manifesting itself on earth
[9:09] now by the actions the activities the
[9:15] display of the inside to the outside you
[9:20] can see hell manifesting itself and we
[9:25] are living in the middle of a living
[9:28] huge asylum here upon the earth it has
[9:35] been said by the prophet of Malachi 4:5
[9:41] shall come to pass that the entire world
[9:44] will go insane people will be insane
[9:48] everywhere ninety sixty four when their
[9:53] eyes were opened listen we are living in
[9:59] a country insane institution 1965
[10:04] communion yes sir
[10:06] the entire world has become like a
[10:10] complete insane institution with the
[10:14] people on the merry-go-round of madness
[10:17] and all kinds of ungodly unseemly
[10:23] perverted poisonous and evil things
[10:27] taking place around us and the devil has
[10:31] so proliferated it that is now becoming
[10:35] normalize ungodly acts
[10:39] ungodly things being done right openly
[10:46] and it's accepted as a norm era seems to
[10:51] sit upon the throne lies seem to reign
[10:55] and the truth seems to be on the streets
[11:00] crying all my brothers my sisters back
[11:03] to the Bible back to the Word of God
[11:06] search the Scriptures and see it bends
[11:09] in you will see the truth don't just
[11:12] take what I say what the priests say
[11:14] what the Pope says or what the
[11:18] superintendent says take God's word for
[11:21] the Bible says let every man's work be
[11:24] aligned and my word be the truth that is
[11:28] how we should approach it brothers and
[11:30] sisters
[11:31] no this entire world is a pond of golf
[11:35] strain and that ghost train is speeding
[11:40] its way right to the last stop by life
[11:48] and by our nature we are displaying that
[11:55] we are on that train or when we're off
[11:57] that train I can tell you I'm not on
[12:01] that train I've left that train already
[12:03] I got off of it many years ago I gave my
[12:08] life to the Lord Jesus Christ and now
[12:10] I'm on the gospel train I'm on the glory
[12:14] train I'm headed home to glory but this
[12:19] other train is going in the opposite
[12:22] direction it's Satan ghost train and
[12:26] many people wrongly or rightly find
[12:31] themselves on that train by some mistake
[12:35] and they don't know how they get off oh
[12:38] stop the world stop the train I want to
[12:41] get off and it seems as if the train and
[12:44] the world keeps going around and they're
[12:47] handing up on it and that train makes
[12:50] stops along the way to pick up many
[12:54] other passengers and I run that time as
[12:57] possible that a person if they're aware
[13:00] of what's happening they can get off
[13:02] that's happens junctions in our lives
[13:05] comes trials troubles opportunity comes
[13:10] and we must know
[13:12] by the grace of God when we are to get
[13:16] off of that train that we are on many
[13:21] call it the rat race many call it the
[13:25] race of life but that's the that's the
[13:28] human race that's on that kind of a
[13:31] train and you are on a train that's
[13:34] going from stop to stop giving you
[13:38] opportunities why are you getting like
[13:39] to get off of that train but if you do
[13:43] not get off that train the last stop is
[13:47] going to be held hell is your last
[13:51] destination that that train
[13:54] ladies and gentlemen says the conductor
[13:56] the last stop coming up now and the last
[14:00] stop is called hell my friends you're
[14:04] headed for a town or a city that's
[14:06] called him and so we use the term hell
[14:10] bound hell bound there you are you
[14:14] bought your ticket by your actions by
[14:17] your nature listen a person can make
[14:20] mistakes and ask God for forgiveness and
[14:24] go on and God will wash them in his
[14:27] blood forgive them for their wrongdoing
[14:30] cleanse them from their sin like anyone
[14:33] else and my friends but then there are
[14:36] so many that it is their nature to sin
[14:40] not sin by a mistake but the nature the
[14:45] the desire is in them the unstoppable
[14:48] urge to sin is in them and so they are
[14:52] called a sinner not one that just sins
[14:55] and then ask God Oh Lord I made a
[14:57] mistake forgive me Lord I'm here I want
[15:00] to be your child your son your daughter
[15:02] I slipped up I messed up Lord I'm
[15:06] turning around I'm coming to you Lord
[15:08] forgive me of my sins that's totally
[15:12] different than one who sits on that
[15:15] train and loves the view and loves the
[15:19] enjoyment loves the pleasure love all
[15:22] those things and the Train
[15:25] many times for well knowing that train
[15:28] is hellbound i heard the man just today
[15:33] saying oh yes i'm gonna enjoy my life
[15:37] and even if i die this way then at least
[15:39] I lived well I don't I don't think
[15:42] that's really life you actually are dead
[15:45] when were yet living if you're gonna be
[15:48] thinking like that so that train is
[15:51] bound to its last and final stop which
[15:56] is him and many others are on that train
[16:01] and really don't know that they're on
[16:04] that train they got on the train by
[16:07] making a mistake
[16:10] and here we find them Revelation chapter
[16:14] 3 verse 17 that the Bible tells us
[16:19] clearly that many say I'm rich I'm
[16:24] increased with Goods but the Lord says
[16:28] but knowest thou not in other words but
[16:32] you don't know you don't realize no it's
[16:35] now not my friends that were blind you
[16:39] miserable and the spiritually naked
[16:44] lukewarm if you're even a church member
[16:47] and don't even know it and know it it
[16:51] not you're on that train and don't
[16:55] realize that you're on a train that's
[16:58] held bound honestly to Satan's pit now
[17:04] in his mission series o-h Ren the author
[17:09] mentioned that we are at war with the
[17:13] armies of darkness you know the
[17:16] scripture clearly tells us we are we do
[17:21] not fight against flesh and blood but
[17:23] against principalities and powers and
[17:26] spiritual wickedness in high places
[17:30] yes sir we are at war against
[17:33] the powers of darkness and the god of
[17:36] this evil age the book of Revelation
[17:41] chapter 12 the Bible tells us fear in
[17:45] the Word of God chapter 12 verse 7 and
[17:49] there was war in heaven and Michael and
[17:53] his angels fought against the Dragon and
[17:56] the dragon fought with his angels and
[18:00] prevailed not he lost neither was their
[18:05] place found any more for him in heaven
[18:09] and the Great Dragon was cast out the
[18:15] old serpent called the devil and Satan
[18:21] which deceiveth the whole world he was
[18:26] cast out into the earth and his angels
[18:32] were cast out with him all of these
[18:37] devils and demons another part of the
[18:41] scripture tells us this was one third of
[18:43] the angels that he was able to persuade
[18:47] right came with him down to this earth
[18:52] to infest to to possess the control the
[18:58] minds hearts and the bodies of men to
[19:02] live in them and to commit demonic acts
[19:05] all friends that is why the term was
[19:09] used we are living in an insane asylum
[19:13] surrounded by these walking corpses
[19:17] anointed and inspired by the devil and
[19:21] all of his evil works but thanks be to
[19:25] God we find out that he is a loser
[19:29] because in the book of Isaiah chapter 12
[19:33] we discover in the Word of God that
[19:39] Lucifer who became Satan the dragon the
[19:43] evil one that old serpent speaking
[19:48] his ancient wisdom was kicked out of
[19:51] heaven thanks be to God God kicked him
[19:53] out of heaven he will not put up with
[19:55] his actions as lies he will not put up
[19:58] with him with his evils hit with all of
[20:01] his see subverting God's kingdom and his
[20:05] great conspiracy God kicked him out and
[20:09] you never right if you can believe God's
[20:12] Word
[20:13] whoever you are no matter how humble
[20:16] your life is or how mighty your life is
[20:18] no matter her accomplishment you have a
[20:21] right to kick him out of your life in
[20:24] the name of Jesus Christ and claim a
[20:27] complete victory over him for the Bible
[20:30] says they fought but they prevailed not
[20:34] and they were kicked out where were they
[20:37] kicked up up cast out upon the earth
[20:40] so we rather now right here among us
[20:44] these invisible invaders in a further
[20:48] part of that chapter it calls him 200
[20:52] 200 million horsemen 200 million deep
[20:57] monic horsemen upon the face of the
[21:00] earth attacking the entire human race
[21:03] through Envy because God claims them
[21:07] blames them that they are his children
[21:10] and he created them and placed them here
[21:13] and replaced him as the one that should
[21:16] be in charge now you must understand
[21:18] that Satan actually the right from first
[21:24] being called Lucifer when he was in
[21:27] heaven
[21:28] and we know that Lucifer according to
[21:34] the Bible read isaiah 14 as we said he
[21:38] was the Light Bearer this main name
[21:41] means Light Bearer oh he was also the
[21:48] leader or worship leader up there in
[21:51] heaven he led the chorus he led every
[21:55] all the sing in the worship of Almighty
[21:57] God but after a while God
[21:59] jealous of the worship God was receiving
[22:04] and then he began to create an evil
[22:09] conspiracy against the Most High God and
[22:13] by telling mom tales which we call lies
[22:20] but his long tail he was able to pull in
[22:26] one turn of the excerpt of the Angels on
[22:30] his side and there with that third of
[22:33] the angels
[22:35] this evil one began to try to offer
[22:42] throw the kingdom of God but the Bible
[22:45] tells us and there was warned in heaven
[22:49] and Michael fought with his angels and
[22:54] defeated Lucifer and his angels and so
[22:59] when he was kicked out his nature
[23:04] changed his name got changed
[23:07] it wasn't Lucifer anymore he wasn't
[23:10] bearing any light anymore but he was now
[23:14] the Prince of Darkness
[23:15] he was now called Satan he was called an
[23:20] evil one he was called that great dragon
[23:24] he was called that old serpent yes sir
[23:28] and a Bible said he was kicked out he
[23:31] was cast out no wonder jesus said in my
[23:35] name if thou canst believe in my name
[23:39] you cast out devils your lay hands upon
[23:42] the sick and they shall recover oh yes
[23:45] so we as believers have the right to
[23:49] cast out the devil anywhere he rares up
[23:53] his head and we can recognize it we have
[23:56] the right to cast him out oh praise God
[23:59] for evermore
[24:00] that evil one that Prince of Darkness
[24:04] I also want to draw attention to another
[24:08] one of
[24:09] names he has many names dosa those are
[24:12] just names him so here it is he is also
[24:15] called Beelzebub no Beelzebub which
[24:20] means Lord of the dung heap or
[24:25] translation Lord of the Flies that's
[24:29] inspired many things in this modern day
[24:31] but that is the name of Beelzebub right
[24:36] which means Lord of the dung heap or
[24:40] Lord of the Flies or lord of demons
[24:46] Beelzebub and he was cast out in the
[24:51] name of Jesus Christ thank God we are
[24:55] not of his army but we are of the Lord's
[25:00] hosts we are of the armies of light I am
[25:05] of the army of light I trust you are of
[25:09] the army of light I want to ask whose
[25:13] army are you in in Romans 13
[25:18] in Galatians 5 Paul describes the works
[25:23] and the lifestyle of those who have
[25:27] membership in this army of Darkness he
[25:34] says in Romans chapter 13 listen closely
[25:44] verses 12 the night is far spent and
[25:53] that day is at hand let us therefore
[25:58] cast off the works of darkness and let
[26:04] us put on the armor of light works of
[26:09] darkness let us walk honestly as in the
[26:15] date time not in rioting and drunkenness
[26:20] not in chambering
[26:23] whirring and in wantonness not in strife
[26:27] and in envy envying but put on the Lord
[26:32] Jesus Christ and make no provision for
[26:36] the flesh and the book of Galatians Paul
[26:41] continues to describe the activities of
[26:45] this army of Darkness check yourself to
[26:49] see when whether you are a member of
[26:53] this army whose side are you on Joshua
[26:58] was asked the question and he said I am
[27:01] on the Lord's side I trust you will say
[27:04] the same today Paul speaking now the
[27:09] works of the flesh are manifest which
[27:12] are these adultery fornication
[27:16] uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry
[27:23] witchcraft hatred variance emulations
[27:31] wrath strife seditions heresies
[27:37] oh my praise God envyings murders
[27:42] drunkenness revellings and such like of
[27:49] which I tell you as before I have also
[27:54] told you in times past that they which
[27:57] do such things shall not inherit the
[28:01] kingdom of God my friends they are as
[28:06] late the coming of the Lord is an end
[28:09] and the entire world is deceiving itself
[28:16] the world is in a terrible state and
[28:20] trying to console itself in this modern
[28:25] age by science by technology trying to
[28:32] console itself that everything is
[28:34] alright never mind
[28:37] the signs in the climate never mind
[28:41] the signs in the heavens above never
[28:46] mind a signs upon the earth beneath
[28:49] earthquakes Wars rumors of wars nation
[28:56] against nation Kingdom against Kingdom
[28:59] as Jesus said in Matthew 24 pestilences
[29:04] striking the earth everywhere and still
[29:07] disobedient man refuses to listen to the
[29:13] voice of God into the science he spoke
[29:16] of over two thousand years ago that they
[29:21] will come upon here and when you see
[29:23] these things know that my coming is
[29:26] there look up lift up your head for your
[29:29] intentions right now think about it but
[29:33] the world keeps consoling itself with
[29:36] parties with all enjoyment with
[29:38] money-making with in every manner of
[29:42] distraction that Satan can provide their
[29:45] defense going in two different
[29:47] directions away from the Word of God
[29:50] trying to say everything is on right
[29:54] some will say oh brother Satan it's my
[29:57] life leave me alone I just want to live
[30:01] my life and have my way but be careful
[30:05] don't you be like a frightened little
[30:12] boy whistling in the dark and trying to
[30:17] convince himself that he's not afraid
[30:21] I'm not afraid I'm not afraid but he is
[30:24] whistling as loud as he can he is
[30:28] playing his boom box or his music as
[30:32] loud as he can and if possible he'll put
[30:36] Stoppers in his ears so that he can't
[30:39] hear the voice of God speaking to him
[30:43] but in reality you're whistling in the
[30:47] dark it is a very sign of
[30:50] fear it's the sign that something inside
[30:54] of you is telling you something is
[30:57] fixing to happen and you need to be
[31:01] prepared and get ready for the scripture
[31:04] says prepare to meet thy God and after
[31:09] death the judgment oh brother sister you
[31:13] say about brother Simon you're
[31:14] old-fashioned
[31:15] all that preaching about handling and
[31:19] going into a fiery pit it's all imagery
[31:22] it's it's not really it's just a
[31:25] pictorial Bible language it's not true
[31:29] I'm here to tell you friends too late
[31:32] will too late will be the cry you take
[31:36] that chance to leap in the dark close
[31:40] your eyes and step into the dirt beyond
[31:43] with no one there to greet or meet nor
[31:47] shining light to welcome you will be a
[31:52] horrible experience for you I warn you
[31:56] in the name of Jesus Christ give your
[31:59] life to Him while there is yet time to
[32:02] give your life and be not a member of
[32:05] this army of the Living Dead give your
[32:09] life to Jesus Christ oh yes they come
[32:12] going going through the graveyard trying
[32:14] to you know prove to everybody else
[32:18] around I'm not afraid I'm not a race
[32:20] Fred but it's whistling so loudly but
[32:23] you're really afraid of what lies ahead
[32:26] of you you're really afraid of the
[32:30] unseen that's in the dark you do not
[32:33] know what next is going to happen and I
[32:37] want to say this is that something I'm
[32:39] making up because as a boy I experienced
[32:46] this in my own hometown
[32:49] I went to the cinema at night and - I
[32:56] went to see the movie congratula and
[33:02] that was in
[33:04] neighbouring town I forgot I totally
[33:10] forgot that after seeing such a horror
[33:13] movie I had to get back to my town late
[33:20] at night and I had to walk through a
[33:28] dark unlit winding country road that
[33:34] made its way of all places through a
[33:39] graveyard
[33:41] that was one mile long graveyards on
[33:46] both sides of this pitch-black dark
[33:51] country road and there I was as a little
[33:59] boy inside trembling but not wanting to
[34:04] of anyone to know that I was afraid I
[34:10] was whistling away whistling away
[34:15] because I was afraid to walk through
[34:18] that graveyard
[34:19] well this world is a graveyard if you're
[34:22] not afraid if you're not recognizing
[34:25] what's going to this happening to this
[34:27] world how its heading down the the
[34:30] greasy pole right to you right my
[34:34] friends right down to a hill right now
[34:36] we need to take us stock of ourselves
[34:39] and ask the Lord Jesus to have his way
[34:42] with in our lives and so there I was in
[34:46] the darkness walking through this
[34:49] graveyard acting as if I was unafraid
[34:54] but very soon that was going to change
[34:59] because suddenly in the dark I heard
[35:04] such a blood-curdling screaming and
[35:07] screeching coming from the moms of tombs
[35:11] that was enough for me and with the
[35:15] fleet feet
[35:17] and running that you can only get from a
[35:20] little boy I ran I ran non-stop until I
[35:30] got home with beating something hard I
[35:34] got home and I want to say my friends
[35:39] don't you deceive yourself don't just
[35:45] live blindly in the darkness of this age

[35:57] because you're well-off or maybe because
[36:02] you're rich you're fashionable that you
[36:06] have no fears of your future don't

[36:32] yourself to be captured by such thoughts

[36:46] a slave to the dark side of life your
[36:51] secret dark side hidden from everyone
[36:55] but known only to you and on 1-liter him
[37:01] are the dark hidden secrets now in the
[37:05] midst of this call that 19 atmosphere
