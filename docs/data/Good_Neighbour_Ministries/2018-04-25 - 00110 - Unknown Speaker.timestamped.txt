[0:00] resource water water is the secret of a
[0:04] full spiritual experience John 7:37 it
[0:08] is often the symbol of the word of God
[0:11] and the Holy Spirit
[0:12] the word and the spirit know of God the
[0:16] hand and glove the word activates the
[0:19] spirit and the word only works or the
[0:22] Spirit of God is activated and John 6:63
[0:26] it is the spirit that quickeneth the
[0:29] flesh profiteth nothing the words that I
[0:33] speak unto you are spirit and life
[0:38] hallelujah
[0:39] we are on that journey amen
[0:43] becoming more like Jesus every way
[0:46] possible deeper is that bird that finds
[0:49] our desire for each person going a
[0:54] little deeper pushing out into the deep
[0:56] waters get the way from the north we
[1:00] have a deep spiritual hunger that
[1:03] resides in us and is calling out to God
[1:07] responding to God's call to those deeper
[1:10] the deep waters of God's Spirit is
[1:13] calling us to fill the deep places in
[1:17] our hearts brother Branham talked about
[1:20] the doors of your heart open up so many
[1:24] doors open up every door amen
[1:28] he wants full preeminence as we've been
[1:31] hearing he wants total control he wants
[1:34] total possession open up everything
[1:37] and how can you open up you open up as
[1:40] these shots you open up all your
[1:43] required this morning is whatever
[1:45] showing you do it obedience is better
[1:49] than sacrifice sometimes we fast and
[1:51] pray we come to church we do all the
[1:54] things of works and we do not open the
[1:57] doors we do nothing but in our hearts
[1:59] where we've shown us beginning and
[2:03] that's racist will be the better side
[2:04] place what good is all what good is love
[2:08] your works with another vain God
[2:11] oh that's a fearful thing it's not a
[2:16] fearful thing that a preacher prostitute
[2:18] and speak in God speaking to you that's
[2:28] the water beautiful thing
[2:29] not when you're not typical being the
[2:32] boss at work will be this or believe
[2:34] that when you're not obeying box they're
[2:41] conscious there's a witness we respond
[2:48] with our prayers our spiritual hunger
[2:50] that drives us to the Word of God
[2:52] worship there's a place in our worship
[2:55] where the waves of God's presence can
[2:58] come upon us again and again until we
[3:01] find ourselves in the deep waters and
[3:04] whatever we found ourselves with deep
[3:05] waters this morning if you might open to
[3:10] the deepest water than your worship to
[3:12] God you know that's all we really can do
[3:15] when God gives us when God sisters free
[3:19] gives us spinning
[3:19] he gives us delivers all we can do is
[3:22] really work
[3:27] worship is a pathway to deeper waters
[3:30] the presence of God reveals as we
[3:33] worship is like the relationship with
[3:50] Jesus Christ
[3:53] you know those life-giving worship we
[4:36] are willing we are thirsty we are pushed
[4:39] out from the shorelines determined and
[4:43] of deeper go deeper I will push the
[4:47] paths of my personal goods by
[4:50] distractions all those waves angled into
[4:53] the deep waters of God's presence with
[4:56] my breakfast for my worship with open
[5:00] expecting God villains brother
[5:06] shorelines this word we let the angle
[5:10] deep we might be knee-deep waste even
[5:17] those are losses the cecum 47 God's
[5:26] telling the prophet of all waving up
[5:28] into the deep spiritual waters of a
[5:31] spirit filled life can I ask you a
[5:34] question today are you afraid to wade
[5:38] into the deep because you think that God
[5:41] may require of you more honesty is one
[5:53] of the greatest greatest things that we
[5:56] can in our honesty request for anything
[6:03] honest one with the good I mean I got to
[6:10] a place where I don't
[6:11] myself I saw the end that's good I bring
[6:15] all that is what I don't know myself I
[6:19] don't like nobody to me go look at me go
[6:24] away you look at a man crying in a
[6:26] corner cry out to God for help that's
[6:29] how that's what I am but there's a God
[6:33] amen
[6:35] there's a God I put a seed put an answer
[6:38] you put a part of the self in you
[6:40] that's why I look to do you reason that
[6:46] if you don't commit your work fully than
[6:50] you won't be found
[6:51] give me a failing see if you saw that
[6:58] vision of the river as spring forth on
[7:00] God's throne and that river represents
[7:03] the power of the Holy Spirit there are a
[7:06] few truths here this is what I want to
[7:10] get into just a bulky one quickly I was
[7:36] the deeper depths on a relationship was
[7:40] God
[7:41] this passage talks about four stages of
[7:43] the flow of this river that takes us
[7:47] further steps and deeper our
[7:49] relationship with Christ and growth each
[7:51] time and the book to be more like Christ
[7:54] every purpose on the grounds of God's
[7:57] Word that was promised in the Bible that
[7:59] quickening power has given them to
[8:02] quicken that promise to them and when
[8:05] Jesus died he redeemed that back to them
[8:07] us the graves that belongs to the sons
[8:14] and daughters of God he demonstrated
[8:16] what God was how they're going to
[8:19] socialize that and put it into an
[8:21] organization we have no rights to do
[8:24] that it's the Holy Spirit today hunted
[8:27] on his heart that would believe the
[8:31] message everything in the Bible that was
[8:34] promised for that believer when you
[8:36] accept it in its fullness and the rose
[8:40] that you do he gives you the abstraction
[8:45] that when you accept it in its fullness
[8:48] and only God knows if you do you can't
[8:52] see you do and then you wonder why
[8:54] you're like the road you're walking
[8:57] going things ain't changing and you're
[8:59] not becoming like Christ because God
[9:01] knows that you're not accepting
[9:04] Vilnius accepted enough oldest is more
[9:09] than what we think and just believe it
[9:12] has left doors died out his commitment
[9:16] his Lord snow to the deep
[9:24] he gives you the abstract that and then
[9:27] they're promised that his name is in
[9:30] your possession and the Holy Spirit is
[9:33] there to quicken that to you know what
[9:37] kind of people should we be God's
[9:41] intention when he spoke the Word of God
[9:43] was that he may become materialized just
[9:47] like in the beginning he had an
[9:49] intention when he spoke the word the
[9:51] book in the book of Genesis
[9:52] let there be none to be better beat and
[9:55] her rods and there was and there was
[9:57] when he spoke of a ride let there be not
[10:01] to be that be dressed
[10:03] let there be a door letter be delivered
[10:06] letter be set free and there will be and
[10:10] there will be rest I don't know boom but
[10:15] there will be a bracket and door and his
[10:19] righteousness isaiah 55:11 so shall my
[10:24] word go forth out of my mouth and the
[10:26] shall not return to me void but it shall
[10:28] accomplish which i please and it shall
[10:32] prosper where goals we hear this let me
[10:37] tell you that word that blows out of his
[10:40] mouth that was born out of the mouth of
[10:42] the Pikeville ministry mmm that's the
[10:45] word
[10:46] because we have accomplished that part
[10:52] of accepted will accomplish that Burnham
[10:54] accepted shall prosper and where it goes
[10:59] is going right here because I accept it
[11:03] that's where it's going hey man we have
[11:09] an expressed image of the invisible God
[11:11] of his life what a revelation because we
[11:14] realized that pleasure then it brings
[11:17] forth life the Old Testament times in
[11:20] the taco taco which the Jewish people
[11:22] worship and pray constantly there were
[11:26] three main parts the outer Court the
[11:28] inner court and the most holy place
[11:30] which is the Holies of Holies but only
[11:33] the high priest could go behind that
[11:35] bear separated into intercourse or the
[11:39] holy holy series this was the place
[11:41] where the presence of God manifested in
[11:45] order to qualify for the privileges of
[11:47] meeting with God the priests have to
[11:49] undergo certain rituals and
[11:52] purifications
[11:53] and dressed a certain way act a certain
[11:57] way in a certain way to talk a certain
[12:00] way today they are all like to be and
[12:06] gods present not on the basis of rituals
[12:09] or traditions but the bases are not our
[12:13] righteousness in Christ we are called to
[12:18] that intimate fellowship with God
[12:23] related to him through prayer is our
[12:26] birthright as adoptions of sons of the
[12:29] Father elaborate bullet beyond the veil
[12:31] communing with God in his deepest levels
[12:34] that we'd be transformed you see back in
[12:39] the Old Testament that place of the
[12:42] Holies of Holies nobody can go in there
[12:47] just the priest was he here and go in
[12:51] there
[12:52] he had the dress he had to go through so
[12:55] many things and he could when he went in
[12:58] that place he still couldn't look upon
[13:00] the face of God he couldn't take it
[13:03] a smoke interract incident had to cover
[13:07] his face his eyes
[13:08] that's a holding on us and he had to go
[13:12] in there with a blood sacrifice of and
[13:15] the sprinkled on the mercy seat and he
[13:22] introduced and that did one person one
[13:27] priest go in there make the sacrifice
[13:29] all the sins of the people Jesus Christ
[13:46] on the cross when he died it was like a
[13:58] token now we come to that place with God
[14:05] and relationship with him but do you
[14:12] think this is toward the church you
[14:14] think is just keeping just believing
[14:16] God's an experience
[14:21] experience the deeper and deeper and
[14:24] deeper into that place with God give
[14:29] never satisfy your hunger and thirst
[14:33] thing all the way from the Living God
[14:35] for our fabulous Krypton and as you're
[14:41] peeking through and more and more
[14:45] because of my you have a willing heart a
[14:48] light that is Fredrik barbar you think
[14:52] God's gonna open up the boys here end
[14:54] episode have you know that their heart
[14:57] is not really belong the shorter their
[15:05] own comfort zone no but he knows he
[15:12] knows who this world he knows your
[15:15] thoughts that you're thinking right now
[15:17] he knows where you are
[15:19] good luck he knows your desires that you
[15:25] have
[15:28] [Music]
[15:34] the designers in here
[15:38] you can you fool can you say that you're
[15:44] sincere you're not can you say lots of
[15:46] you're not can you say all these things
[15:49] new compiler fun trying to be gonna put
[15:52] in front front of you but I've got not
[15:55] coming I tell you where the people is
[15:58] this is a simple message when people
[16:00] begin to a place in their hearts of the
[16:01] day they're honest before God my god
[16:07] your sins honest before God that
[16:11] something will take place Amen
[16:16] hallelujah the more even parts His grace
[16:25] the power of the working of the Lord in
[16:28] you you spirits the more the outer men
[16:32] will reflect his glory that's when his
[16:35] power will release through you the one
[16:43] problem we have in the message today is
[16:47] this too many believers talk about
[16:50] living behind the veil without even
[16:53] going away means too many preachers I
[17:00] expose myself
[17:02] you preach the gospel is best talk about
[17:06] the kind of available does it bring up
[17:14] you know the ability of knowledge
[17:17] because you can behind the veil to
[17:18] preach the gospel is human knowledge or
[17:20] you can preach this message to put it
[17:22] together those servants together
[17:26] occasionally denies people that are well
[17:30] educated at the bestest togetherness but
[17:33] you can behind the veil abrasive
[17:35] processes in your life like literally
[17:40] when you speak We Need to Talk
[17:42] testify business because behind that
[17:47] veil was kind of glorious you bring that
[17:50] into your life you are going to be
[17:52] walking there talking every decision
[17:55] that you can make everything that flows
[17:57] through you is godly is no Holies of
[18:00] Holies reflective your life that's
[18:05] what's lacking that's what changes
[18:09] people when God's Spirit is release a
[18:13] lot worse about you desire University of
[18:17] spirit and in truth not just truth about
[18:22] this knowledge of the truth but a spirit
[18:25] and in truth people are are sincere
[18:28] people are honest people aren't
[18:31] generally seeking God and what meet with
[18:35] God and what he changed
[18:43] but there has to be a person there has
[18:48] to be a minister be somebody that knows
[18:53] it that could bring God see that bring
[18:58] brother Chen for the Simon for the jack
[19:00] bring God draw yeah they're come like I
[19:08] said at the beginning we needed happen
[19:10] to come not me not you we need him to
[19:14] come our hunger their thirst before him
[19:18] I'm a characters and has a full of
[19:21] people here exported that are really
[19:23] desired for him to come
[19:24] I hope there's more than a handful but
[19:27] I'm John and not everybody desires for
[19:30] him to come because when he comes it
[19:37] changes everything
[19:38] you know how much have to do why behind
[19:49] the video it's not a one-time event it's
[19:54] an experience it's a lifestyle
[19:58] after you entered that lifestyle of
[20:01] intercession and prayer you live in that
[20:04] place living behind the veil is a
[20:08] supernatural lifestyle this means that
[20:12] whatever occurs in your life from that
[20:15] point on is the results of decisions you
[20:19] make that originate from the heart of
[20:22] God not your flesh every choice every
[20:26] decision every where your leg this is
[20:33] conducted controlled by that place that
[20:37] secret place where God speaks to you my
[20:43] glorious place they map
[20:49] yes it's not just my conviction of my
[20:53] heart
[20:53] Saints as I can feel my conviction of my
[20:57] heart is I just sell us the week on the
[21:02] pinky for things that he showed me to
[21:04] miss Ellison and I see it in such a way
[21:07] and I break it in such a way that it's
[21:10] real I don't put it in such a way that
[21:13] working all like flowers and you know
[21:15] all you know lightly lightly I see too
[21:18] many things being increased lightly
[21:20] enlightening people beloved brushes off
[21:22] though I don't see it that way every
[21:26] time God's peace the mountain rumbles
[21:31] the heart travels that's my experience I
[21:36] can only be that's all I can be now well
[21:43] this process is beyond the veil your
[21:46] spirit becomes more light than you
[21:49] dreamed possible it responds to the
[21:51] Creator it depends on the heights our
[21:56] unsearchable the heights
[21:58] your life is changed forever yet it is
[22:02] being changed that's the experience that
[22:05] you get my life has changed forever it's
[22:10] never the same
[22:11] that's why when I speak faith even
[22:13] though I'm strong with certain things in
[22:15] life left right and I need to overcome
[22:18] certain things like words are different
[22:21] I speak different life because my life
[22:23] it takes but at the same time
[22:28] this morning
[22:30] [Music]
[22:33] hallelujah you begun beginning to
[22:36] understand in a small way what deep the
[22:39] Psalms was that fella said when he wrote
[22:41] you hide you shall hide me and that
[22:44] secret place on your presence for the
[22:47] plot submit with the plots of flesh
[22:49] plots of this world pause even where all
[22:52] my ideas were all thinking you come to
[22:56] understand the difference between your
[22:57] cartr thinking and God's thinking you do
[23:01] you come to realize them when certain
[23:03] things always bump up Satan always tries
[23:06] to bring the urgency Saeko strives to
[23:08] bring something that gets you you know
[23:10] your anxiety level up or whatever
[23:13] company and he finished he sits in that
[23:15] car go by the populations looking at all
[23:17] the circumstances around you he starts
[23:19] burning fever he starts burning all
[23:20] these things and if he wants you to
[23:22] speak wants you to make a decision based
[23:24] on that I can begin to a place where you
[23:27] can control that you can get to a place
[23:29] understand your surroundings understand
[23:32] this is deceitful age understanding your
[23:35] flesh understand your weaknesses they
[23:37] need to say be still and not speak
[23:45] things not do things that happens on
[23:48] your flesh flesh profiteth nothing
[23:53] what brings you more battle scars
[24:01] it means total protection sickness is
[24:05] not allowed there fear all these things
[24:10] are not allowed there in that place the
[24:15] enemy of God Satan cannot enter there
[24:21] the understand cannot enter there that's
[24:26] a secret place for you and God you have
[24:30] paid the price you have died out enough
[24:34] you've gone to that place with God in
[24:37] your experience and only God and you
[24:43] were there why do I say that in the way
[24:47] it is because things no matter what
[24:48] things come into your life no matter
[24:51] what battles you get other words you get
[24:54] what things that may attack you it's you
[24:58] and God and God alone he does not touch
[25:01] that place he can never touch that
[25:03] person that's what God wants us to live
[25:07] out of that place was is to speak out of
[25:08] that place he wants us to make our
[25:10] choices and our decisions and everything
[25:13] that that that comes upon our lives out
[25:15] of that place
[25:21] but if I believe you cannot wait to
[25:24] return where you just begun your Spears
[25:27] of t see what it's like to be in that
[25:29] heavenly throne room the cost of moving
[25:31] into the Holies of all these few humans
[25:33] ever entered and the Holies of Holies
[25:37] spiritually speaking why why the price
[25:42] is simply more that most people are
[25:45] willing to pay you know for the psycho
[25:48] who says that a pension cost is plenty
[25:50] costs it is it is I cry out every single
[25:56] day because this or more deeper more
[26:02] deeper I get right the more there
[26:07] splashbacks up just think of it as we
[26:13] get into this a little bit here to go
[26:17] all this direction the Lord's gonna have
[26:19] us going but think of the prescription
[26:23] we read today when you heard ankle deep
[26:26] water it's not all that time to be
[26:28] negative when you're ankle deep water
[26:31] you know it's up to your ankles you've
[26:34] got a control system there's no
[26:36] resistance
[26:37] there's no straining you can walk never
[26:41] where you walk one get out of the water
[26:43] you can get out of the quick when I
[26:47] guess the ad is a little bit more
[26:48] uncomfortable you start feeling that
[26:51] that get to that place where goal
[26:55] control starting to lose a little bit of
[26:58] control
[26:59] a little bit longer you know then it
[27:07] gets up to your waist a little bit more
[27:10] you know when he gets up to your waist
[27:13] it starts getting that deep you know
[27:16] that yer possible because over for you
[27:37] [Music]
[27:41] just like the inner court you come in it
[27:45] cleanses you you repent of your sins
[27:49] it starts dealing with little things in
[27:50] your life you wanted a day out of court
[27:53] you start studying the Word of God are
[27:55] ruining the Word of God the Word of us
[27:58] are speaking to you more leading you
[28:00] into a deeper life
[28:01] what is pulling on you is pulling on
[28:04] that seat of God inside of you because
[28:06] there's a veil that has to be read in
[28:07] your life there's a bad line your heart
[28:11] that has to be ripped there's a seat of
[28:13] God behind that veil of the Spirit and
[28:15] you have to go behind that with inside
[28:18] yourself your experience with God and
[28:23] that transition with the Word of God
[28:25] speaking to you drawing me and asking
[28:28] you to give up and die out that's where
[28:31] it comes up to the waist it comes up
[28:36] [Music]
[28:51] [Music]
[29:11] but that is the greatest place for our
[29:14] you believer to get to because my you
[29:17] surrender to that goal and you know that
[29:19] he's faithful
[29:20] he's true promise that he spoke evil
[29:32] feeling like
[29:34] place so many people walk into these
[29:39] stages and these stages they stay a
[29:42] little deeper there they speaker sit on
[29:44] the church needy waist-deep never go all
[29:51] the way
[29:51] [Music]
[30:05] earth
[30:08] the usually takes the stress to bring
[30:11] the best out of the man God gets you
[30:14] down when you possibly many times get to
[30:17] yourself in a position to get yourself
[30:20] out of the way I think David got to
[30:23] these places when you begin to meditate
[30:26] over the Lord I begin to think of other
[30:28] things when you say when a time God puts
[30:32] us in tight corners where we look up
[30:34] many times he gets us on our backs in
[30:37] the hospital or our bed cellars so we
[30:40] can look up with great lessons but not
[30:42] comfortable the word thirst I was
[30:46] looking in the dictionary looking up
