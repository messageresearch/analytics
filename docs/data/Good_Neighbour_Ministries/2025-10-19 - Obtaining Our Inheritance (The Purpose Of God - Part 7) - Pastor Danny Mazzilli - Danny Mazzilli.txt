Greet the people, brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I'm very happy to be here this morning and to see all of you gathered into the house of the Lord. And I just pray that God's blessing will rain down upon us and give us a wonderful time of refreshing, revival, restoration, and that we'll walk in the light as he is in the light, having fellowship one with another, the blood of Christ cleansing us from all sin. May the great Holy Spirit take control today. Take control of the speaker so that uh you'll hear him speaking, but let's believe God that he will use his voice to speak to us and lift us higher in the realms of God. God bless you so much. Thank you for having me. &gt;&gt; Lord, Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. [Music] We're very grateful for our precious brother. I've got a couple of uh baptismal certificates here. I've got one for Sarah Hope. Amen. God bless you, sister. Where are you? I know you're here. I saw you. &gt;&gt; Oh, in Sunday school. Okay, you can give that to her. And uh brother uh Jesse Mitchell, you know, when when he comes here, you can just pass that on. Praise God. They were baptized um at our youth camp this year and uh we want to make sure that they get their uh their official um uh certificates. Not that the certificate does anything more than just remind them, you know, they can put it up on the wall and just remind them of what um their public declaration was before the Lord. Amen. to be baptized because we know that baptism when somebody receives the word for their day. Something changes on the inside of their hearts. They're immediately going to express something on the outside. The scripture says that it's an outward expression of something that has happened on the inside and their lives have been changed. Amen. And their purpose automatically changes now towards the service of the Lord Jesus. Glory to God. Amen. Praise God forever more. Amen. And so may God just bless the service this morning as we go to the word of God. Let's go um to uh to our scripture this morning. We're going to continue along the the lines that we were um last week and over the last this is part seven actually of the purpose of God. I don't know where we're going to end up with this. Um, but I trust that we'll end up in our theophies. Amen. Praise God. Because that is the absolute goal of the word for this day and for this hour is to translate us. And so, um, we've been looking at the purpose of God. Last week, we looked at being called unto adoption. We're predestinated the scripture that we read. And so let's read our scripture from E Ephesians 1:es 9 to1 11 saying having made known unto us the mystery of his will. This is what we're this is the message of the hour. This is what we're feeding on right now. It's the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth. So, meaning he's going to bring together, this is this is talking about the rapture. Those that are in heaven, those that have already been translated, they're already in their theophony bodies. They're in that sixth dimension. Now, he's doing the work on us so that we can be changed and brought into our theophies. Amen. So that we can all together like it says, both which are in heaven and which are on earth, even in him. Amen. In whom, now this is this is where we're going to be going today. In whom also we have obtained an inheritance. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Christ did not come without a purpose. He came to declare his inheritance, his book, his will. Amen. being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his own will. &gt;&gt; Amen. Father, we just ask you to take control and Lord, let your spirit have free course this morning. Take control, Lord. uh you're the only one that can break the bread of life to each and every heart and and discern each and every need that's here in our midst this morning. So won't you please come and and speak to us a little while and let our hearts burn within us, Lord, as you as you speak to us along the way. Grant we pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. You may be seated. Praise God. So today um you can go to the next slide. Today we want to look at obtaining our inheritance. Amen. We've been given an inheritance, okay? That Christ has made available for us. And um part of adoption is, you know, where where the son, he, you know, at first he requires tutors, he requires instruction, he requires the leadership and the guidance that comes through the father's uh workmen, through his angels, through the five-fold ministry. Amen. Praise God. This is what we're under now. You know that God is is perfecting the church, a perfecting sons and daughters of God for his purpose. Amen. And so, um, we have an inheritance. And that inheritance is what gives us the authority to take the father's business and to operate as a son or a daughter of God in this day and in this hour. Amen. Praise God. And so we're just going to look at a few of the quotes that we read last week and we're going to we're going to go from there. But just to lay in the background again, it says here, you can go to the next slide. It says, "Now a little farther now, now the 11th verse, which is what we read, it says, in whom also we have obtained an inheritance." And brother Brandham goes on to say, "And oh, an inheritance. Somebody has to leave you something to inherit it." Is that right? An inheritance. What inheritance do we have? Question. What inheritance did I have? I didn't have any, but God left me an inheritance when he put my name on the lamb's book of life before the foundations of the world. Amen. And we were talking about it last week. And you know, if we're going to have an inheritance and our father's going to leave us an inheritance, your name needs to be on the will. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, there's no inheritance for you. You might have thought you had an inheritance, but until the actual book is read, the will is read, you don't know if your name's actually there. &gt;&gt; And so here he's saying he's saying that that he put our names on the lamb's book of life when when you were born here. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; When you overcame here, &gt;&gt; when you when you started to attend church and started to show that you're a Christian on the outside, no. before the foundations of the world. He could predestinate by knowing that when the word would come to you in your day, &gt;&gt; you by your own free moral agency. And we're going to be looking at that today on on on aspects of really coming into our position and and position of authority. I don't want listen if I'm a businessman. If I hire somebody and I put him into an office in a position, I make him the vice president of the company or the CEO of the company because I'm the chairman of the board and I decide to put him into that position and I and I I look I'm going to check his character. I'm going to make sure that he knows his position and the authority that he has. Otherwise, he's going to make a mess of my company. &gt;&gt; He's got no character. He's got no real, you know, strength, no no uh no decision power making. Amen. And this is important for the Lord. &gt;&gt; He didn't just predestinate. Oh, I'll choose you and I won't choose you and I'll choose you and I won't. That's not that's not God's way. &gt;&gt; No, no. He could by forn knowledge he saw your character being developed. &gt;&gt; He saw you going through the trials. He saw you going through the situations that you needed to go through in order to pro, you know, to produce what what he would require from you in your position as a son &gt;&gt; or daughter. When I say son, I'm meaning daughter. It's all okay. Amen. Praise God. Glory to God. So here now he goes on and he says, "Oh, you say now wait a minute, brother. Jesus did did that when he died for you?" No, he never. Jesus come to purchase &gt;&gt; that inheritance because without him coming to give up his life, give up the ghost, the Holy Ghost, not to, you know, and he come down into into theophony and then give it back so that he could he could go and and and send down the Holy Ghost, which is your theophies. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Which is when you receive the word for your day, you've made contact with your theophony. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is what brings you into your position as a son, adopted son. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So read the very next the very next line. in whom we have obtained a parent obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the council of his own good. Go to the next slide. Look has predestinated us unto this inheritance. If I'm right, inheritance of something. If God is knocking at my heart and saying, "William Branam, I called you a long time ago before the foundations of the world to preach the gospel." &gt;&gt; What is he saying there? He's saying that he knew exactly what your position would be. &gt;&gt; Amen. He knew that you would you would freely take your position as a son or daughter of God. that when the Holy Ghost comes on you, your life now, your purpose changes alto together and it's his purpose now. &gt;&gt; Everything that you do, everything that you live, everything that you associate yourself with, your your schooling, your your plans for the future now, you're lining it up through his purpose for your life because it's his will that we're looking for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember, the will is the book that reads out and calls your name. And if your name is in the book according to his will, it's because he put you there knowing that he was going to adopt you. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah. I have an inheritance, an inheritance of eternal life. Now, God sent Jesus to make that inheritance real to me because there was nothing I could do to it to inherit it. It was blank. It was valid. There's nothing I could do. But in the fullness of time, God sent in his own good time, Jesus, the lamb, slain from the foundations of the world. His blood was shed that I might go to my inheritance to be what? What inheritance? The sunship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To be a son. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And we'll read the last one here and then we'll move on from there. And now this may just choke you to death, but did you know that men that are sons of God are amateur gods? Amen. &gt;&gt; We got to we got to come we listen. We need to come to to an understanding of what God is doing in this hour. &gt;&gt; When the rapture takes place and our bodies are changed in a in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, there's that's going to be a supernatural event that God is going to that that's going to manifest through your life. And there's going to be people that all of a sudden are going to realize, wait a minute, he was always saying that, you know, this was going to happen. She was always saying that this event was going to take place. They must have been sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So you need to come to a place where you start walking like a son, &gt;&gt; acting like a son, &gt;&gt; having authority like a son or a daughter of God, &gt;&gt; understanding your position in this day and in this hour. Amen. This is the hour that we're living in. This is what God is looking for. He wants to see sons and daughters coming into their positions by free moral agency. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says here now how many knows that Jesus said so that the Bible said did your law say itself that you are gods and if you call them gods which God said in Genesis 2 that they were gods because they were they had full domain over the dominion of the world. He gave them dominion over all things &gt;&gt; and he lost his godship. He lost his sunship. He lost his domain. And Satan took it over because of the original sin. &gt;&gt; But now watch. But and and and Satan took it over. But brother, we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Who will come back and take it over again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. We're going to have that inheritance in our hand. Praise God. He said, "Take the book." Oh, glory. Don't get too far ahead. waiting for the fullness of time when the pyramid gets up to the top. When the full sons of God will be manifested, when the power of God will walk out, hallelujah, and will take every power that Satan's got away from him. Amen. Yes, sir. It belongs to him. It belongs to to him, the the Lord Jesus. And and him being displayed in you now belongs to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're his wife. You're the one that he's called. Amen. Let's let's move on. Now, we're going to move on from here. Amen. That was just a recap of last week so that we can, you know, can can move into heavenly places and and see what the Lord has for us today. Amen. Let's go to the next scripture. In 1 Peter 1:3-5, it says here, "Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again." &gt;&gt; Again, &gt;&gt; has begotten. Where were you when the sons of God rejoiced? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise Praise God. Where were you? Amen. He's begotten us again. Amen. Glory. unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. Now watch, pay attention. We're talking about obtaining our inheritance. To an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. I don't know about you, but that that that that's telling me that there's something there there's there's a supernatural incorruptible something that's waiting for me. &gt;&gt; That's that's already present. Amen. That's already making itself known. That's making itself real and becoming a reality to me. This listen, when the prophet went beyond the curtain of time and he saw those theophies there, he was he was looking at all the sons and daughters of God from all the all the past ages. Amen. He was seeing everything. And you know there's there's something incorruptible that's waiting for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you've already entered into the word for this day and this hour, you're already experiencing it. You you you you're experiencing the revelation that comes with it. Amen. Praise God. And he goes here and he says to an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled. It fades not away. He says reserved in heaven for you. Amen. who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed when &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. Is this the end time? &gt;&gt; Isn't this the Isn't this the last time? &gt;&gt; Isn't Isn't this when something is is is going to manifest before us and and bring us into a time and a season? Listen, this word is progressing, saints. We're not we're not just going to church Sunday and Wednesday to just come here and and oh that sounds good. Oh, I heard that before. Oh, he he said that one before. I've heard that quote before. I've read that scripture before. Listen, the scripture needs to come to life in your day. &gt;&gt; You need to recognize what he's going to do for you right now. Amen. Praise God. It's going to place that inheritance in your hand so that you can deal with the situations that you're dealing with out in life. Amen. So you can overcome those situations that are the enemy tries to knock you down, tries to place you in a day gone by, &gt;&gt; tries to put you under a under a previous age. Amen. &gt;&gt; No sir. This age is the bride age. This is where the bride comes into her position. She recognizes the word recognizes what the word is to produce &gt;&gt; in this day and in this hour. Amen. And so we know we have in obtained our inheritance when we have progressed unto adoption where adoption now is is is is a reality. You can see that God was dealing with your life. God was molding and shaping and and even now there's things in your life around you right now that God wants you to get away from, break away from, overcome because this is adoption time. &gt;&gt; This is this is where the tutors take their hands off. Amen. And say, "Here he is. Let's look at what look look what he's he's become. Look how he's overcome. Look how he's dealt with these situations. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're no longer under the tutors &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost constantly having to correct us. Yes, we come to the church. Yes, we come under the five-fold ministry. Yes, it's the Holy Spirit that's speaking to us. But we have come to a place where now we recognize that he's in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wants us to act our age. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; listen to what I said. He wants you to act your age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not your immature age, but the age of the word for this day and this hour and what it's to produce. Sons of God, adopted sons. Not just adopted sons, but authority. &gt;&gt; Having authority in their positions, knowing what God is required. Amen. Glory to God. Yes, we need the anointing and the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Yes, those things are good because those are what gives us the ability to overcome and to do the things that we need to do from time to time. Amen. Listen, if we don't have the ability of the Holy Ghost when we pray for somebody, they're not going to get healed. &gt;&gt; But when the Holy Ghost comes and honors the word and you speak that word under the anointing, God is obligated to his word. If there's faith there, he meets that faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But we're not talking about just baptism. Oh, I'm going to go to another church meeting because that brother can preach. &gt;&gt; He can he can bring down the house and the people start running around and people start speaking in tongues and and and oh, there's such a such a baptism and the people leave the meeting and then you go to talk to the brother and the or the sister and you get into fellowship with them and say, "Brother, what did you get from there?" I don't know, but it felt good. That's not the hour we're living in. Amen. This is the hour where the word lays in a foundation. Brother, I I just heard that I've got some authority over over that sickness that that that I came into the house of the Lord with. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I've got something, you know, that that that's given me the ability to overcome this financial burden because I just come to realize that Jehovah Gyra, &gt;&gt; he's still alive. &gt;&gt; He's still willing. He's still He's right there just waiting for me as an adopted son to step into my authority and sign the check. &gt;&gt; Because when I sign that check, it's just like my father. &gt;&gt; He's backing that check. &gt;&gt; He's good for the money. &gt;&gt; Make the investment, my son. &gt;&gt; Make that investment, my daughter. I'm going to back it up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because you are you you've become a channel for me. You become a river of life. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You come to a place where you realize manifested sons of God in the last time. This is the time. This is what Peter was talking about. There's got to come a time where this is going to become reality. Saints, &gt;&gt; yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are you going to step into it? Are you going to allow yourself to stay under under oh well you know they just telling me I got to press play and obey. That's it. Just press play and obey. &gt;&gt; Well, what about you? Where are you? &gt;&gt; What? Well, what's your your position in this? Press play and obey. Obey what? &gt;&gt; What are you going to obey? &gt;&gt; You going to put on the my eagle belt? You see that? What are you going to do? Put on your ego belt. You going to get excited? Oh, no. I'm going hunting like the I'm going hunting like the like like like the like the prophet used to go hunting. And boy, we'd we'd get together and then we'd sit around the fire and then the Holy Ghost would come. No, no, no. He's at work with you. &gt;&gt; He leaves when you leave this place. He leaves with you. &gt;&gt; He's interested in all aspects of your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's looking at building your character. He doesn't want to see a different life when you live when you leave here. &gt;&gt; You might fool me. You might fool, brother Simon. You might fool the deacons, but you're not going to fool God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, sir. God wants character. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wants to place authority into the hands of character. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Now, here, let's go on. Let's move on. Next slide. 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 6-7. Because this is where we're going to headed. You know, we're going to head into this direction today. Because, you know, being a son or a daughter of God, there's testing. It comes with it. God has a purpose through it all. He says here, "Wherein ye greatly rejoice." You know, we just finished reading, you know, where where it says, "And and this this salvation, I'm just going to backtrack. This salvation which is ready to be revealed in the last time." So, he's talking about your your your your position as a son. you're going to be revealed in the last time. And then he goes on and he says, "Wherein you greatly rejoice." I mean, we're we're rejoicing in the word this morning. It's wonderful. I'm a son of God. Hallelujah. I'm in my authority. Glory to God. He says, "But though now for a season because you know what? You're going to have your ups and downs today, this morning. You come in here. Oh, praise God. This word, hallelujah, just getting so blessed." And then you go to work tomorrow morning. The first thing the b the boss says is, "Get in here. Somebody told me this, this, this, this. What do you do? Bang, bang, bang. You got three days laid off. You see, you're going to face situations. But he says, "If need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations. You're going to be tested, saints, that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than gold, that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ. that when that translation takes place, nothing is going to compare, saints, and nothing is compared to what we are receiving in this hour by the word of God being revealed. Amen. Glory to God. But yet, there's molding, there's shaping, there are things that that the Lord has to do in our lives. You know, let's bring this. Let's let's let's let's you know, it's so wonderful to hear you're this. You're a son. You're overcomer. you're all those things. It's another thing now to put the pedal to the metal and get on the road and go and deal and overcome the situations. Amen. Praise God. And so here for the next week or maybe two, I don't know. We're going to see how long we're going to take to get through this. But we want to we want to look to see what God requires in order for a son to enter into his adoption as a full son of God. Amen. To where that theophony and and and and the word in you becomes one. Amen. Praise God. Whether you really believe. Glory. So let's let's move on from here. How many's ready to go? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're going to take a little trip back through the Old Testament. Glory. And we're going to see where the Lord reveals. And you know, if there's things there that say, "Oh me, oh my, that's me. That's me. That's oh Lord, help me here. Help me there." Let it be so. Amen. Because you are ordained to be a son. &gt;&gt; It'll never you you can't there. There's no way you can't be &gt;&gt; unless you just aren't. &gt;&gt; Period. &gt;&gt; Let's go to our scripture. I'm going to take a quick drink. In Joshua, how many knows that Joshua is a perfect type of Ephesians? Now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of Nun. Moses minister saying Moses my servant is dead. Now now bring this right to the present stage that we're in. Saints, we're looking at the Old Testament, but I want you to place this now. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when I say when when the scripture says Moses my servant is dead, brother Brandham our prophet is dead. &gt;&gt; He has translated to his next placing &gt;&gt; in his theophony having fellowship with the saints. Amen. Praise God. But you and I, we're still here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now watch. Now pay attention to everything because we're just going to let the Holy Spirit show us here. He says, "Now he's dead. Now therefore arise, go over this Jordan. Now the Jordan that we're that we're in the midst of of of going over, okay, for a lot of people, a lot of people have already gone over. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But some people still got to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. And it takes the Holy Ghost to take you over that Jordan. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've been talking about the purpose of God and the purpose of the Holy Ghost and what it all does and how it brings his purpose into your life. And his purpose is to take you in and over. Amen. He's called you out and now he's going to take you over. Some have already crossed over. They're already feasting in the promised land on the word of God. I trust there's most of you here are are already feasting in the promised land. Amen. Praise God. But here he says, "My servant is dead. Now therefore rise, go over Jordan, thou and all the people unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel." And when we when when he talks about the children of Israel, you know, God's talking about his chosen people. He's talking about, you know, um uh the bride, right? The the the the sons and daughters. Everything was a type. Whenever he was talking about Israel in the Old Testament, he's typing the the the the the church, the the bride in the New Testament. Amen. And so you know here he's saying now every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses from the wilderness of this Lebanon even unto the great river the great river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and unto the great sea towards the going down of the sun shall be your coast. Amen. In other words you are a separated people. Yes, &gt;&gt; you have been given total possession of the land that that that lays before you. Amen. As a son or a daughter of God, God has given us a full inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are going to inherit the meek shall inherit what? &gt;&gt; The earth. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a a a a ruling of 1,000 years. And God needs ambassadors, sons and daughters that will rule and reign with him for a thousand years. And so he goes on, he says, he says, "There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses, as I was with William Brandham." &gt;&gt; So I will be with thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. So So you see it? He was with William Brandham. Now he's going to be with you. &gt;&gt; Like like try to keep it simple. Amen. I will not fail you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Nor forsake you. He just says, "Be strong and courageous of good courage, for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them." Amen. So God is reading that book of inheritance. He's saying that we've obtained the inheritance. He says the inheritance is for you to possess your land, the portion that God has given you. Listen, God didn't call you to become a part of this church or this ministry under the message of this hour to just be a nobody. You are somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're a daughter or a son of God. You're you're you're you're so special in the eyes of God. You've you he wants to place you into your position of authority. He wants to give you authority in your life as a housewife, as a as a preacher, as a deacon, as a trustee, as a as a a a cleaner in the house of the Lord. It you could be a cook for the for the events. You could all of these things if it's under the anointing of you coming into your understanding that you are now serving the living God. &gt;&gt; As you serve your brothers and your sisters, as you do your part in the house of the Lord, you're doing it unto him. &gt;&gt; You're doing it unto the Lord. Amen. Praise God. That's something that's that's that's greater than what you think. Amen. We're going to be looking at some of this. Go to the next slide. But he says here, you got to only be strong and very courageous. It's not easy to stand on this message and this word. It's not. Don't let anybody tell you, "Oh, it's easy. Just come to church." &gt;&gt; Like I said, you could live a life here and then be a totally different person out there. God wants you to be a son or a daughter. &gt;&gt; Now, And the rapture is in progress. &gt;&gt; And if it's in progress in your life, it's going to be displayed. &gt;&gt; You're going to you're going to have the purpose of God all around you. &gt;&gt; You're going to have the purpose of God when you fellowship. Your purpose is to fellowship on the word, but not in a religious way. We're not religious. People say, "Oh, brother, man, you're you're so religious." We are not religious. Amen. &gt;&gt; Religion is what's caused all the problems in the world because people take the word of God and they want to put their own interpretation on the word. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to put our own interpretation on the word. I'm reading quotes from a prophet. But that listen, that prophet, he only did one thing. He pointed us back to the word. &gt;&gt; That's all he was doing. He was pointing us back to the word. But because the church world out there and the church Christian world out there, they couldn't receive the pure word. That's why you go to somebody as simple as you believe in a trinity, three gods in one. There's nowhere in the Bible that there's three, they will you'll watch the hair come up on the back of their head. &gt;&gt; They get upset. &gt;&gt; Why? Because it's exposing their own doctrine. Amen. &gt;&gt; Which are the doctrines of the nicicoleans that were injected into the word of God. And that's why the word of God has become of none effect to the people. They can go to church. They can live any way they want. They swear. They they they they they commit adultery and this and then they go to church on Sunday and they say in the name of the father and of the son and have no idea who the father is, who the son is, &gt;&gt; who anybody is. They're just living a a a hypocritical life. That's not an adopted son. I'm sorry. We're we're we're way down the road. God's looking for adoption of sons and daughters that have come into their position of an understanding on the word. &gt;&gt; The word. Amen. He says, "Now watch." He says, "Be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed, for the Lord thy God is with thee wherethersoever thou goest." No matter what situation you might find yourself in, you might make mistakes. Don't worry about it. You might, you know, it takes time to to to really, you know, come into uh the the right character. God is molding and shaping you. You've you've had you've had certain character on your life for so many years. It doesn't happen overnight. It's a process. &gt;&gt; But he's with you. &gt;&gt; I'll never leave you. &gt;&gt; I'll be with you. &gt;&gt; I'll overcome with you. Oh, glory. He says, "Now then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, pass through the host and command the people, saying, prepare you victuals, for within 3 days you shall," now pay attention, "you shall possess, you shall pass over this Jordan to go in to possess the land which the Lord your God giveth you to possess it." &gt;&gt; Did he say that you're going to go over and you might possess it? &gt;&gt; No. that that that I that the Lord your God might give to you. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. He says you're going to possess it. &gt;&gt; Because I give it to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says you just got to receive it. &gt;&gt; You just got to step out and say, "I'm I'm ready. I'm putting my sword on." Joshua says, "Get yourself ready because to possess this land, you're going to have to fight for it. &gt;&gt; You're going to have to overcome a lot of situations." Amen. Glory to God. Go on to the next slide. Ephesians here in in adoption one he says our Ephesians our Joshua which is the Holy Spirit. Joshua means Jesus our savior. Joshua means the Holy Spirit representing it in the spiritual as that was in the natural. Amen. So, like in the natural where Joshua would give them their their their uh their tools of war and tell them to prepare themselves, get themselves dressed and put on the armor in the spiritual. God is saying, "Put on the word. &gt;&gt; Take on the word of God." That's the spiritual aspect of the word of God. That's the That's what Joshua has given us in this day. He's not saying put on the tapes. &gt;&gt; No, no. He's saying, "Put on the sword." Hallelujah. Glory to God. He's saying, "Take the word of God and dress yourself with faith." &gt;&gt; Faith only comes by hearing the word and by you and and God having a a a divine uh relationship of what his desire and his will and his purpose is in your life and through your life. He says they were they were everyone Hebrews when they crossed the river. But Joshua divided the land and give each one of his of his land according to the utterance of his mother at the birth where the Holy Spirit told her. Oh, glory to God. Amen. I believe that God has some mothers in this day and in this hour which are churches. Glory to God. That's come under the anointing and the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. the five-fold ministry that knows what under the utterance of the word that as the word goes forth through that ministry, it starts to positionally place sons and daughters of God because they they're under inspiration. The five-fold ministry is under an inspiration of of the mighty angel himself. He come down in 1963 to place authority in us so that we could call and speak and and and speak the resurrection of the sons and the daughters of God and call them out of their amnesia. &gt;&gt; And as the word comes forth, you come into church, brother, what what's my position? Where do I fit in? Just sit under the word long enough. The Holy Spirit is going to make it clear to you exactly what your position is in the house of the Lord. Amen. In the body of Christ. You don't have to worry. You don't have to try to put on a position. You don't have to try to be a minister. You don't have to. It will manifest itself when you die out to yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that's the first thing that needs to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Now, go to the next slide and just stay there for a bit. I'm just going to talk for just a few moments. Now, now that you are in the land, God is saying, "Work the land." He says, "Okay, I've given you the land. We're going to go in. We're going to possess the land." Now, you're in the land. Now, you got to work your land. Now, you as a father over the home have to take your position. You as a mother over the home have to take your position. &gt;&gt; You, the father's got to plant seed. So, if he's going to plant seed, what kind of seed does he want to plant in his children? He's going to plant the word of God. He's going to plant the the the you know what what's good, the things that are good, the things that are true, the things that are right. So, as a father, we want to lead and guide our homes and our families by the word of God. We want to plant the right seed. &gt;&gt; But, you know, there's going to be an enemy that's going to try to pluck up that seed. Soon as our kids get out into the world and they start going to school, all of a sudden, there's an interference that kicks in. You young people, you know what I'm talking about. But don't worry because if you're an adopted son or daughter of God, you've been given an authority. Oh, glory to God. You're not going to stay like that very long. You're going to become aware because that attribute that God placed in you from before the foundations of the world, that's going to come to surface at some point. As the word comes down, as the word gets spoken and it gets revealed, you wake up out of your amnesia. Even as a young person, I don't I'm not discounting anybody. This word of God, it can come to any son or daughter attribute of God. Whether they're in a 5-year-old body or they've been in this message for 30 years and they're still not awake. Maybe this is their time. &gt;&gt; How do you know? &gt;&gt; You see, because when God calls you, he calls you to a position. He places you. He's not going to place you here, there, over there. Well, one week you're over here, next week you're over there. God's going to place you into the body. You're going to know exactly who you are. You're going to know who your shepherd is. Amen. You're going to recognize the word that's coming forth because it's it's it's thundering in your heart. How do you know that the word I I'm I'm under the right ministry. Listen, I knew what right from the very beginning. It didn't matter that he was 5'8. Okay? It didn't matter. But the word was thundering through the man. &gt;&gt; It didn't matter. The word was coming and feeding my soul. It was bringing me into an a placing in the body. I I couldn't I couldn't help it. I could just see the word clearly. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. I was listening to the prophet, but everything I was hearing the prophet say, it was coming to reality in my own life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's how you know you can listen to the tapes. I got nothing against listening to I listen to them every single day. &gt;&gt; Every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Every single day. &gt;&gt; Amen. and and I love it. I feed on it because I hear things and I realize, oh, there you are, Lord. &gt;&gt; That's exactly the way you you you revealed it to me on Sunday through the pastor. &gt;&gt; That was you speaking to me. That was you confirming your word. That was you making it more of a reality. And and plus, now I can see in my own life how I got to apply it &gt;&gt; and not just a parrot that can just quote the tapes. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's going to have an effect on my life &gt;&gt; because now you by the power of your spirit under the anointing &gt;&gt; are speaking to me. And now I know it's just not my pastor speaking anymore. I've got the fear of God on me because God is aware of my situation. &gt;&gt; God's watching me. God wants to perfect me. God wants to shape me. How you going to get that if you're not under the understanding of who you are, &gt;&gt; where you're supposed to be? Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. When you make a mess and you need you need you need to own up to your mess. &gt;&gt; You need to realize, okay, you know what? I need to change certain things. I need to change my ways because I go to try to possess this land and the enemy is sitting right there and he says, "I have a right to be here because of this, this, and that." You say, "What?" this, this, and that. You heard the pastor, you heard the preacher, you even heard brother Brandham talking to you on the tape, and then I had to come and confirm it here, there, and everywhere else. You will know. Listen, saints, this is not some some, uh, you know, like, oh, uh, I just go to this church and, you know, he said so, I believe it, that's good enough. No, this is where you need to believe it. By your own experience, by your own revelation and experience and relationship with God, not you through somebody else. &gt;&gt; No, sir. Not because you identify with this person that you've got this person's revelation. No. A lot of people, they want to immediately go and they want to sit with the pastor. They want to talk to the pastor. They want to be at the head of the table with the pastor. They want to know exactly. They want to share and tell their testimony and everything that God's doing in their life and everything else. And because they're there and the pastor is sitting there and he's saying, "Uh-huh. Uhhuh. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's not going to cut it. gives you an inheritance, &gt;&gt; but with that inheritance comes responsibility. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. God, he's telling you, you got to be responsible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For your placing, &gt;&gt; your calling. This is the hour where you This is not just, oh, I belong to that church and that's good enough. No, you have a responsibility to fulfill the purpose of God &gt;&gt; that he placed in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. God bless you, Sister Sheila. &gt;&gt; I just saw you now. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you. I believe &gt;&gt; we can rejoice. Amen. Glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Listen, let's go to the next slide here. Listen to this. He says, "Thou son of David, have mercy on me." 1961. He says, "God told them way down in Egypt before, I give you that land, but he didn't say, I'll I'll go out there and sweep it all out and garnish the houses and hang up the curtains and everything. You all just move in." No. No. They had to fight for every inch of ground that they took. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're going to have to overcome. You're still going to I've been in the message for 30 years. I've been in the message for 10 me 10 years. I've been in the message for a week. I see people that have been in the message for a year overcoming more than people that have been in for 25 years &gt;&gt; because they've they've broken out of that complacency. They've they've come into the reality of God that God is a reality and their life completely. They're they're ready to to take on the enemy. They're ready to, you know, and God he, you know, he goes with them. You think just because they're young believers? Listen, I remember when I came to the Lord, I was I was a I I was a I was a wild man on fire. I'm surprised that I didn't get knocked out six, seven times from people because I was rude. I would just tell them, man, you you got to believe this or you're going there. like, you know, so zealous and so on fire for God, not realizing that God was, you know, looking for character and and and uh but you know, that that comes with time, right? Amen. But but because I was so on fire, because God knew that that I was one of his, you know, he says, "Oh, it's okay. It's okay. Let him let him have his time. Don't worry." And and then and you know, I get so excited. I remember one day I'm driving down the road. I'm listening to brother Brandham. driving going to the high going down to the food terminal. It's like 4:00 4:30 in the morning. I'm just rejoicing on the word of God and just praising God all excited. I'm in the left lane in in a in a van and I'm drive driving down the highway and I'm just rejoicing. All of a sudden, my phone rang and I look down at my phone and back then you could use your phone when you know because this is back in '94 95. I go to grab my phone. I look at it and it was blank. And I look up and it was a tractor trailer parked in the left lane, stalled in the left lane. And all I says, "Oh, God." And I went like this. And I'm telling you, my van came off the ground and moved into the other lane. Don't ask me how it happened. All I know is that God intervened that morning. &gt;&gt; Or I would have been plastered on the back of that tractor trailer. &gt;&gt; What was that? I'll be with you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'll be with you. Even though you get a little overzealous, you might get a little over excited. You might do this. You might do that. You might make I'm with you. &gt;&gt; He'll prove it to you. He'll you you will know that he is God. Amen. Glory to God. He says, "But I'm not going to sweep everything out." He says, "And I'm going to hang up all the curtains and everything. You're all just and you all just move in." No. No. They had to fight for every inch that they took. That's right. Fighting. Take it by every fight. every inch. But he said everywhere the souls of your foot land, that's possession. &gt;&gt; So don't worry, you can step on the enemy's ground. &gt;&gt; The moment you step on the enemy's ground, you possess it. &gt;&gt; He says you're going to possess the gates of the enemy, brother. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen. He says it's possession. You can step, go, move. Just move and and take take the land wherever you see that you got to move and you've got to go. Just don't worry. I'm going to be there with you. I'll be there. I'm over I'm going to overshadow that situation. You're not going to have to. You're going to overcome and do things that you never thought were possible. He says everywhere. He says that's the same thing it is today. Divine healing belongs to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. As an adopted son of God, you are you possess divine healing in you already. &gt;&gt; It's yours. Amen. Glory to God. The Holy Spirit belongs to us. It's our property. But you'll fight every inch of it. Yes, sir. But brother, footsteps is possession. Just keep on fighting. Take it. The devil say the days of miracles is passed. No, no, no, no. The days of miracles is not passed. He's still doing miracles. &gt;&gt; I see miracles all around here. &gt;&gt; Amen. The greatest miracle is when you can receive the word for your day and come under it and come under the the the headship of it and believe it and take it and and possess it in your life. And then you're going to see miracles take place. Amen. You'll see things happen that you didn't think were possible. He says he says, "Don't you believe that? Say you're a you're a liar. Tell Satan you're a liar, Satan." Amen. God said he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Take it everywhere your footsteps. That's possession. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Glory to God. Remember, listen, you can go to the next slide. Remember Moses had given them all the instructions on how to possess the land. Brother Brandham, he brought the word that would bring us back to our original faith. &gt;&gt; Okay? Moses didn't bring his own ideas. He didn't bring anything different. He brought thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; He brought the message of God to the people to turn them back to him. &gt;&gt; That's what that's what it was all about. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. told them not to mix themselves with any other peoples and nations outside of Israel. What was he saying? Don't mix this word. &gt;&gt; Do not mix this with some other denominational teaching. Don't mix my word. Just take it the way it says it. You show me baptism in the name of Jesus Christ, I can show it to you. 8,000 witnesses in the book of Acts alone where every single baptism was done in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. That's the word. &gt;&gt; You show me anything different, don't mix with it. I'm not mixing with baptism in the name of the father and of the son because they don't have a revelation of who the father is, who the son is, and who the holy ghost is. But Peter had a clear understanding when Jesus told him in Matthew 28, "Go ye and baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost." And what did Peter do on the day of Pentecost? 2:38 baptism in the name of Jesus Christ because he knew that Jesus Christ was the father. Jesus Christ came to be the son and Jesus Christ went back so that he could come back on us as the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; God himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. He had an understanding of that. And we've got an understanding of that. You got to have that understanding if you truly are going to be able to serve God in the reality of of this message in this word. You cannot be confused about Trinity. If you're in confusion of Trinity, you have not even been born again. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because the new birth is the Holy Ghost himself. And the Holy Ghost comes in you and it goes back to the word and it'll never say anything different than what he wrote in the word because he wrote it by men that were moved by the Holy Ghost. So, how's he going to go against his own word? And people say, "No, no, no, no. I believe my pastor. I believe my church. I believe the Baptist church and well go ahead stay with the Baptist church. What can I tell you? Because this is not for Baptists or Presbyterians or Pentecostals or Methodists or Jehovah Witness. This is for the sons and daughters of God, &gt;&gt; attributes of God, those that God had in his mind before the foundations of the world. Glory to God. Amen. And so as long as the children of Israel did exactly what Joshua told them, God promised to be with them. It's as simple as that. And if we take the understanding that when we come and we receive the word through the five-fold ministry, we see that it's from the word and what he quotes from the prophet is exactly with the word. They all line up. It's because it's him. is because he's making the word real and confirming it to you personal. &gt;&gt; The Lord said only be courageous. Now, you can recall from the scriptures that when the children of Israel fought Amalecch and his armies that the people would hold up Moses's arms, okay? And as long as his arms were up, Israel would prevail over the enemy. And there was a time when brother Brham was on the scene and as long as brother Brandham would go into those meetings wherever he went, the Holy Ghost was vindicating his word. And it didn't matter what minister would come in. Didn't matter what doctrine would would be set against him. No matter what they would say that they they call him a false prophet. They tell him it's telepathy. This and that. No sir. As long as he was on the scene, God was vindicating his word through the ministry, proving that the word that was coming from him was truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, as long as they held up brother Brennham in in the meetings and as long as the people would come and support those meetings, God through faith would heal the people. They'd come up before him. It wasn't William Brandham that was discerning who they were. When the woman come up and says, "You're not from here. I don't know. Do you know me, sister? No. Never seen you in my life. You're from another city. You've come here because the doctor yesterday told you that you had cancer and you had no hope. Is that the truth, sister? &gt;&gt; Yes. And she'd start screaming and crying. How did he know that? It was not him. It was God proving and vindicating his word that he had just spoken. and those that were hearing and listening would recognize that this was God bringing his word in the day that that they were living in. So Moses' arms were up. The message of the hour was on the scene. His ministry was was was in full progress, &gt;&gt; but he's no longer here. &gt;&gt; But they still want to hold up the tapes. &gt;&gt; They want to say, "As long as you as long as you listen to these tapes, you'll overcome. You will you you're the bride of Christ. long as you believe these tapes. No, no, no. That's not that's not what the word says. Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Now, Moses was dead. This is the this is the the scripture that we read. Moses is dead. He's off the scene. It's Joshua now. It's the Holy Ghost. It's Christ himself under the ministry of this hour that's presenting to you instruction on how to overcome and how to to to deal with your life so that you can come into your full adoption. Because that's what Joshua was was doing. He was placing sons and daughters of God so that they could come into their adoption &gt;&gt; and authority. and the children. Now, Moses was dead and the children had to come into their own revelation on how to fight the enemy themselves. But as long as they obeyed the word of the Lord given through Joshua, the Lord would fight alongside of Israel. Here we see a perfect example of the Lord fighting alongside of Israel. As we go to the next scripture, Joshua had to come into his inheritance. Amen. Joshua was a fighter. Joshua was a type of the Holy Ghost, but Joshua came into his inheritance. And he goes on here, and we'll read it from Joshua 10 7-10. He says, "Joshua ascended from Gilgal. He and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor. And the Lord said unto Joshua, fear them not, for I have delivered them into thine hand. There shall not a man of them stand before thee." Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly and went up from Gilgal all night. Now pay attention. And the Lord discomforted them before Israel and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibian and chased them along the way that goeth up to Bethon and smokeote them to Azac and unto Mea. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God was with them in their battle. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's read the next slide. Verse 11. And it came to pass as they fled from before Israel and were in the going down to Bethon that the Lord cast down great stones from heaven. Oh, glory. Upon them unto Azac, and they died. There were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. That's the God that we serve. &gt;&gt; Amen. You think you got enemies. It don't matter how many enemies are around you. God is going to slew a lot more. He's going to he's going to take care of a lot more situations around your life than you could possibly imagine. You just need to stay with the word. You just need to stay with the instruction &gt;&gt; because can you imagine you're out there, you're in the battlefield and you're and you're one of those soldiers and you you know like you know we listen I had to fight a battle this morning to get here. Everybody fights battles. &gt;&gt; It's a constant fight, saints. But wouldn't it isn't it nice when you when you could just you know you could just be still and you could keep your sword at the side and here you are you're just fighting this guy over here but you see 20 20 more coming from this side. Oh god, I'm dealing with this one over here and this one here. Now you got Now I get a call and oh I can see it's it's this brother here. He's got a problem. I get another call and there's oh there's another situation going on over here and and this and this situation and oh brother I need to talk to you. I need to see you this Sunday and okay all right you know so many battles but you know you're dealing with this one and then all of a sudden God just deals with situations because you be still. You get down on your knees you say Lord you promised. Lord you said you'd be there. Lord, you you promise. And all of a sudden, stones come down and deal with this situation. Another one comes down and deals with that situation. I'm relying on that, saints. You can step into that kind of a walk with God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. God was fighting right alongside them. Amen. The Lord did not say would do it for them, but he but that he would fight right alongside them. I'll be with you &gt;&gt; glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you do it all, when you listen, when you do all that you can do, &gt;&gt; don't worry. God will do the rest. &gt;&gt; He knows where your heart is. &gt;&gt; But if you're trying to do it all on your own, I can do this. I can do that. &gt;&gt; I see zealous, you know, I see zealous, you know, uh, brethren, you know, brother, I'm going to do this. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do just, brother, &gt;&gt; just do this. Show me that you can deal with this little fox right here. &gt;&gt; Cuz when you overcome that fox, then then then you're going to be able to deal with the lion. &gt;&gt; Okay? Cuz there's a you know that fox, one swipe of that and it's done. But that lion, he's going to be swiping at you. And you need to go through some things. You need to understand that you're an overcomer. You've you've been ordained to overcome, but you're not overcoming. Too many people are sitting back and they're not doing anything. They're not they're not stepping into their positions. They're not even going into the land. They don't even want to come into the land and and even say, "Okay, where's my placing? They're okay. I'm going." &gt;&gt; They don't even want to show up. &gt;&gt; My God, what hour are we living in? This is the hour where sons come into adoption. This is a maturity stage. This is the hour where where we recognize that we are sons and daughters of God. We're we're beyond the point of, "Oh, brother, how you doing? Oh, you know, things are hard. Things are tough. Ah, you know, miserable. Look at the weather outside. You're you're too negative. You're just drawn more of the negative to you. You need to get into the positive power of the Holy Ghost that has the ability to overcome whatever situation you have. &gt;&gt; You need to give God glory that he's with me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said he'd be with me to possess this land. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, next slide. Verse Joshua 10. He says, 'Then spake Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel and said in the sight of Israel, son, stand thou still upon Gibian, and thou moon in the valley of Agelon. And the sun stood still, &gt;&gt; and the moon stayed until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day, and there was no day like that before it or after it that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man. For the Lord fought for Israel. Listen, &gt;&gt; there had not been a day before or even after it. But this is a new day. &gt;&gt; This is adoption time. This is when the sons of God, where the earth is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; This is the age where the mighty angel himself comes down to declare, I have a book of inheritance, glory. I've got names in that book that I've given authority to to not only just possess the land, but to speak &gt;&gt; into the situations that need to be dealt with. Amen. Glory to God. There was, listen, the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man. He was not some supernatural giant. &gt;&gt; Joshua was just another man. What did God do? He hearkened to the voice of a man. &gt;&gt; Why? Because God wants to possess man. &gt;&gt; What was Adam in the beginning? Man. Let us What is the What What does Adam mean? Adam, the word Adam means man. God taking possession of man. He wants to dwell in man. He wants to manifest through man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Why did he do it? Because Joshua believed what the Lord had told him to do and was determined to do what God had asked him to do. Joshua was not willing to deviate &gt;&gt; from what God had told him. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says Joshua, I was with Moses. I gave him instruction. I told him exactly all the instruction I told him was listen to me. Go back to the word. Go back to the word. Listen to the word. Now you go do all that he commanded you to do. What did he command you to do? Go back to the word. Recognize the word for your day. Recognize what I'm going to do for you today. Listen to the instruction. I'm giving you the land. I'm telling you, I'm going to be with you. go in and possess the land. That's what he had told him he was going to do. And Joshua was not going to say, "Oh, I wonder if there's, you know, I wonder if God's going to really do it." No. No. He believed it to the point where he would not deviate in any way, shape, or form. He wouldn't look to the left. He wouldn't look to the right. He just looked straight ahead. He said, "This is what God has called me to do. &gt;&gt; This is what God wants me to do. God has anointed me with the Holy Ghost to do it. That is the purpose of God. I'm not going to deviate from that. God could trust Joshua &gt;&gt; to the point where if Joshua spoke the word, he'd say, &gt;&gt; "Stand still." &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; That was God's voice. &gt;&gt; That was God's purpose. That was God's desire in Joshua. He believed God. &gt;&gt; Do you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not willing to deviate from the purpose of God. He recognized that he was called to do it. If there was an obstacle in his way, it just had to move. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. Do you believe God that way? Listen, you can go to work tomorrow. You can go to situations tomorrow. If there's an obstacle, it's got to move. &gt;&gt; Not when you say it's got to move. You just wait. You just tell it to move. &gt;&gt; Move in the name of Jesus Christ. This is my authority as a son of God. You wait now on God to prove his word. He knows if you truly believe what you say. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's look at the next slide. Listen in the in the message of parad. It's a paradox. &gt;&gt; But God did it anyhow. What? By a man. He says, not a god, not some great angel come down from heaven. A man with faith in a mission that he was given to take the land. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. The word of God was behind it. I give you this land and everywhere the souls of your foot shall set upon that I give you. It's yours. Footsteps meant possession. And the sun is what? What? The achievement he was trying to do. See, his enemy was routed and he knew it. If the sun would set, then the kings would get together and they'd come back upon him in double forces. So the sun was going down and Joshua, a man commanded to do this, said, "Son, stand still." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You got situations in your life. You got a cancer. You got a heart problem. You got a blood pressure problem. You got that's just another enemy. Oh, the doctor says that I got blood pressure. I got diabetes. It's just the enemy trying to surround you. You say, "Stand still &gt;&gt; and be gone in the name of Jesus Christ and watch God come down." He's going to stone that enemy. He's going to stone that enemy because you're believing God's word for this day and for this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus said, "If you say to this mountain, if there is a mountain in the way, then we need to speak to that mountain. &gt;&gt; We need to deal with that." We're talking about adopted sons here. &gt;&gt; We're not talking about just speak the word. We're talking about you coming into your adoption &gt;&gt; where you recognize that you that you are what God says you are. &gt;&gt; There's a difference, saints. &gt;&gt; That's why when when when when the, you know, when the Holy Ghost was on the disciples and some of them, you know, they went to the sons ofKeva, you know, they went and tried to, you know, kick us. Paul, I know, &gt;&gt; Peter. I know, &gt;&gt; but who are you? &gt;&gt; Boom. Them right out. &gt;&gt; Beat them to death. Don't be trying to put this on, saints. &gt;&gt; Get down on your knees and say, "I want the real thing. &gt;&gt; I want the Holy Ghost for this hour." I That That's the power that's going to overcome. It's not by your own ability. It's not how well you know this quotes. It's not how well you listen to the tapes. It's not how many quotes you can quote. It's not who you know. Oh, no sir. If you know him, it's okay. But it's but it's all about you coming into your position as an adopted son who has obtained his inheritance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Let the musicians come. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Are we past one? &gt;&gt; 43. Okay, praise God. Let them come. If you say to this mountain, but if you are adopted now, this is your inheritance. Everything I've been telling you. If you if you've been adopted, you know where you're standing. Maybe you got a little bit complacent. You know, maybe you've been dealing with a little, you know, the battles have been heavy. Sure, they're going to get heavy from time to time. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; That's okay. God says, "Get back up again. &gt;&gt; Don't give up." He says, "I'm going to be there. I'm going to be with you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. We're going to continue next week and we're going to be looking at some some aspects of, you know, how we get into situations. Sometimes God wants to place us into our positions. God wants us to take the land and then, you know, we start walking for a while. We start, you know, serving the Lord for so many years and, you know, and then all of a sudden, we start to make, you know, deals with the enemy. In the Old Testament, they called it tributes where you start making deals with the enemy and say, "Okay, I'm still the boss. You can stay in my house, but you listen to me and do what I say." No. Okay. Come out. &gt;&gt; We're going to look at all those things. Amen. Praise God. Let's let's let's uh let's go to prayer. Amen. We've got a request here for for Sarah Hope. She's having burning pains in her eyes. Flash of light that can't properly Where is she? Amen. Are you okay to come here? Praise God. Let's all bow our heads, saints. &gt;&gt; Let's believe.
