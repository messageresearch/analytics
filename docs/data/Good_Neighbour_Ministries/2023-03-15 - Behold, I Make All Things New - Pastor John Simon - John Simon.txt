my name I know my redeemer but all creation testify it's life within me cries I know my redeemer I know my redeemer [Music] [Music] may the Lord bless you indeed he lives he is not dead but is Alive forevermore others believe that what we believe is just an imagination something fantastic a fantasy but to us it's a reality to us it's another dimension and it's right here it's it's nowhere else it's rather all around us but it's just a break from here to there you don't do that until God is ready I was uh reading today about um Albert Einstein and he had a physical problem and they took him to the hospital and they realized that something was going on with his heart a vessel had broke in his heart and they wanted to hurry and do surgery on him and he said no no I want no surgery I don't uh he wants he wants me to go then I'm ready to go I'll go because it's my time to go and I don't want any artificial means of keeping me alive that's how he described it at that time keeping me alive because I know it's my time to go friends it's something else when we know that it's our time our age to go praise the Lord I don't mean individually you know something specific but I'm just saying this is the age we're going out of here praise the Lord God bless you I'm going to be speaking uh briefly on Revelation 21 1-5 and God bless you Sister thank you thank you sisters um praise the Lord the Lord just laid this upon my heart uh to bring it to you and you know something when God gives you a thought and says say this you don't know if it's for everybody you don't know if it's for an individual you don't know what what it is all about all you know is that you're supposed to speak it and even if I said nothing else tonight I'll repeat what he said himself revelation 21 do you have that up on the screen one to five okay and behold I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city knew Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death need a sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that set upon the throne said behold I make all things new amen praise be to God and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful praise the Lord God bless you all tonight and bless his word father we as we are about to say a few words on your behalf we pray that the great Holy Spirit Will so father Empower us and Quicken us that we might bring forth your word on your level For Your Glory we ask it in Jesus name amen praise the name of the Lord God bless you amen praise the Lord uh you know I came back from Antigua and this thought the Lord placed upon my heart I was about to just leave and come do what I had in mind but um with with it this unfinished and anything else just the thought Holy Spirit brought me right back to this saying um that it's a new day it's a new every morning we wake up it's a new day and we have just woke out of our amnesiac sleep that we were all in we just woke up out of that and when we woke up it's a new day the the word of God brought us awake and made us all alive to the fact that we are walking in a new day it's a new morning it's Daybreak that's why he's called the day star and I'm glad for that and it became a new day from the time uh brother Branham said it is the rising of the the sun s-o-n praise God the son was now rising to shine upon us that we might all come to life and fully recognize who we are and what we are a purpose on Earth what we are supposed to do for his glory and for his honor praise the Lord amen I I want to let you know no matter what you have went through I have went through because you know I've been thinking on my own life praying on my own life and thanking God for his grace bringing me thus far and a blessing is Holy Name praise God and God is saying it doesn't matter what you went through before doesn't matter what Darkness your face before doesn't whatever suffering you might have faced before behold I make all things new amen hallelujah praise be to God now I want you to recognize all of that is now behind you as much as they they seals tells you that all the other ages are now behind us doesn't matter what happened in those ages doesn't matter what took place in those ages no matter how oppressed and uh suppressed the church was the Believers were but for us in this age behold I make all things new praise God every everything comes to this time when it's a new day for us and it's with unlimited possibilities that a day with unlimited possibilities where now God is looking for us to walk out with con confidence and faith in his word because we have to make this word live again Hallelujah because we we have had the season we're talking about the word bringing forth the word but the word wants to show himself alive that he is alive and he is among us and that he is walking with us praise God he is ready showed to us it's not by your works it's not by your human Faith it's going to move God and make him do things but the faith that he is talking about is having perfect faith in receiving and believing his word and that allows him to move Among Us spontaneously and to bring about any of his signs wonders Miracles healings Revelations whatever he wants to do he now has that opportunity because the bride has accepted the uh the the wonderful choice that he made for us amen when we place our lives in his hands thank God we are in this Eighth Day this new day A New Beginning praise the Lord and I tell you a brother sister it's marvelous and wonderful that we are alive and more so that we recognize what we are looking at in this day praise the Lord it is morning in my heart is not what the old song says it is morning in my heart because Jesus made all the Dark Shadows depart all the ghosts of your past all the hounds of Hell amen God has caused them to depart and now we can walk into this new day and this new age that he has given to us trials yes they're behind us not that you may not still have them but you're having them now in a different light because back over here when you had those trials those trials were like a burden but now when the Trials come you recognize that's only a test whatever trial whatever suffering it's only a test to bring you through for the glory of God amen hallelujah amen glory to God now I want you to know that for Israel and for the whole world and with its intricate and interwoven systems and patterns because that's how the world operates the world operates my education and operates by systems it operates by patterns and stuff like that and if any of those patterns are broken then it can't function like it really should you you saw the little um startup today about them talking about the bank in California and if the banking system doesn't work according to this system that they have set up then it shows every single thing out because they operate by systems uh well God operates my system too but not that kind of system because that system uh is one set up by Satan and Satan's system feeds on itself I think brother Branham is the term that eats its he eats his own right so it feeds on itself so when you look at the what the world is today it's actually like uh in the age of cancer where this this each cell is trying to eat the other cell and uh you know like uh folks they're dishonest they're lying they're cheating and everything and that's Satan's work and his work and his mind operating through people to see how much they can take away from this other cell how much they can rob that other cell how much they can cheat the other one and how much they can even kill the other one they don't really care about that as long as they survive why it's the system it's not even the people oh my yes Satan is way of plotting planning scheming and thinking to try to over throw God's kingdom he just brought that down to earth and setting up these systems under various names what do you call it a church where you call it a corporation when you call whatever you call it is the same thing that he's setting up that he had in his mind and it all works by him with his rumors with his suggestions with his lies and with his mental and spiritual poisoning of the mind that that he is doing right now in this day and age in which we are living in and so by education he's done that poison the minds of uh the the world literally and for those a few of us that God has brought out of that system we have unloaded a lot of those poisons that we have received in our hearts and in our minds and we rely completely now upon the word of God hallelujah amen yes so that's that's the way Israel operates it operates that way under regimentation it operates that way because that's the way that uh Israel always operated since the time of Moses they got to have systems and they got to work through those systems whether by a rabbi whether by a general whether by whatever they're working through those systems and by working through those systems uh Satan create the atmosphere to let you think that he is all seeing and that he is all-knowing but it's not all seeing it's not all-knowing he set up his system so if something happens in another part of the world his demons are traveling everywhere and they are messengers back and forth so he will become aware of what is going on uh regardless of which part of the world he is let me give you an example this is a strange show I'm talking tonight but um when I was young casting out the devil and um suddenly he stopped and saying hey oh you believe I'm a devil but I'm not a devil because you know just like talking about uh brother Branham just the same way you know I also know this so I know that I know that and so he says now look outside not right now there's a woman passing she has this color dress and this and that and the other she's this that that that we look out there there's a woman he says now um look at the clock the clock says this this is the time he says watch the fairy is now coming he's in a closed in room can't see out the fairy is now crossing the river this was a huge house so we were on we were in one of the top rooms of it um and you look out and there is the ferry coming across the river see those so-called lying signs and wonders were supposed to convince us that he was God and that he was the one doing that because that's also what brother Branham did amen but we didn't were not confused by that because under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit we already knew it was the devil to begin with so it can't change all of a sudden and turn from a devil to be in God we were still lying amen oh my praise God now of course you see that's where witches and wizards come in and that's where they will speak things brother Branham says they are gifted but they turn the gift towards the devil's side and by using those things they can tell the people partial truth they don't have all the truth but they can tell them partial truth and some of those people will be convinced and it can turn them away from God but for us we know we had a god-sent prophet we know the ministry was absolutely proven by God and we behold we believe that the Dynamics of an an actions of the true church is is moving into a new Direction totally different uh right now we still mixed in but uh it's moving in another Direction where God is going to start making things clear of who is in the Church the true bride or church I've used both simultaneously they're not the same but you understand what I'm saying that he wants to make it clear of who is his elected bearing in mind being elected and being Not Elected doesn't mean the person may not be saved you get me there that doesn't mean that the person may not be saved it just means that they're not in the bride they're not in the bride class of saints but they can be servants they can be whatever else God I don't know what are the duties in the Kingdom of Heaven but they will be doing something else praise God but uh those elected to be in the bright class you see I were going to have to go into the book of life and that sort of stuff but the fact is that the bride in her position is totally different separate from that and all these other categories they will turn around and be servants towards the bride 144 000 even those that maybe have been good to the bride while going to church while in churches and doing that but God is the one who decides who is going to be who is his own and who is not his own he alone knows that and that's why we are we don't judge those things but we rest completely upon the word of God Amen praise God it's a new day I believe it it's a new day and a new hour for any one of us to start over regardless of who we are we can start over and let God have his way praise God and now when you build you know you are building on a sure Foundation you know you're building on the true foundation You Know You're Building upon the word of God we have left all the turbulence and we are leaving all the turbulence of the ages past and we are stepping out into uh a new realm a new day we step stepping out on something which like he said to Joshua just follow me you have not passed this way before you haven't passed this way you you don't know really where you're going you just know the end point is Canon but in between you don't know but just follow me for you have not passed this way before and I say the same thing to you you unto myself you have not passed this way before and we are broke into a realm where we have no experience of it we don't know uh where it will turn us this way or turn us that way but one thing we know is that we are headed right into the kingdom of God and to be there on the throne of God right beside him bringing glory to His Marvelous and wonderful name praise God hallelujah friends we are now in the day of the changing of another dispensation we have come out of the dispensations that have passed and now we see a dispensation is just about to change and when I say just about the changes I've taught many times it doesn't change on a day it's already started changing right it's already started changing but then you your formally announced that it's changed when it comes to its apex when it comes to the peak of it you you announce that it's changed right but it's changing already and we've seen it going on right now we see how uh China is aligning itself with Russia we know the scriptures are ready foretold these things how that the Russian bear and the dragon are going to come down upon Israel it's written in the word of God and it must come to pass and we know that what's happening now they're lining themselves up in that way now Israel at the same time having their great their president uh Netanyahu praise God nothing but another Nathan so we see all of this taking place and what your spiritual mind watching uh Los Angeles California with your spiritual mind watching like the announced today America discovers that they have uh Alzheimer's to such a great degree they're gonna have to start to spend like 300 billion dollars cause people's minds are just leaving them people's minds are leaving them mental uh problems has descended upon the nation and so they're going to have to spend hundreds and hundreds of billion to try to solve that now God is going to prove to them money is not going to solve all the problems it doesn't matter how many trillions you throw of it it's not going to solve the problems you may hold it back a while but you can't stop God's pattern on God's plan and if prophecy says the entire world will go insane then the world will go insane Hallelujah and uh when the insane ones which I believe they already are in are in the majority you who believe you are saying you and I will be counted as the ones that are insane my when you see the court system and the way that is going right is wrong and wrong is right lies are the truth and truths are becoming lies just imagine the whole thing is turning upside down it's a topsy-turvy and it's turning upside down praise the name of the Lord amen yes sir so we want to thank God that he has made us aware of these things we know that this The Sensation that is changing which is well known to us it's now moving back from the Gentiles and right back over to the Jews now there's lots of arguments people want to get into well who is the Jew uh are all the people in Israel Jews uh um how do we know that they are Jews and there's lots of things that means that's not our business we don't care about anything like that all we know is that this power that was in the prophet with the prophet is wisdom and this Revelation that was in him is now going back to the Jews and God knows his own because the prophet says even they don't know what tribe they come from even though they don't know their real Origins it will take the two witnesses to come back and preach the word of God to them for them to begin to recognize where they really descended from where they came from amen praise God because remember there's going to be a lot of false Jews like you got false Christians that's why the Bible already says I'm going to say they're Jews when you're not right because you're not really a Jew you think you are but you're not it's the holy spirit will have to prove whether you are a Jew or you are not a Jew and that is all on the line now as it changes back from the Gentiles to the Jews for Paul made it clear that they were blinded for our sake God blinded them for our sake and they could not see they couldn't see when Jesus came that he was the Messiah and that he was the real lamb not the substitutionary lamb that they used to offer in the old Temple but the the lamb is a person and the person was Jesus Christ and he was to blameless lemon is the blameless lamb that offered his life for many amen praise the Lord and so they were blinded for our sakes Paul lightens us that they come from the original tree but we as Gentiles are grafted in amen we have grafted in that's how Paul describes it but you see we who understand it knows he's talking according to the flesh you grafted in but spiritually The Original Seed of God they're not grafted in they come originally from God the tree of life we descend right from the tree of life and that's why we are here tonight giving glory and praise the oak of the Lord God hallelujah but God promised to Israel uh praise God I did not put the exact scripture down here um where you can find it but you just look your concordance where God says you go I'm going to bury you among the Nations and when you are buried among the Nations swallowed up by the Nations behold I shall open up your Graves and I'll bring you out amen I'll open up the graves and I'll bring you out to the graves where you were buried well all the Holocaust and all of the things that they had to go through you you can see clearly that's like the whole nation was being buried God allowed them to be buried burnt chemicals everything else some of them their bodies were melted down to get the fat to make soap so they can use that for my goodness they're in every form and in shape there were buried among the Nations but God said that's only for a time for behold I'll open up your Graves and I'll bring you out of your Graves and bring you back to the land amen praise God and I thank God so that my eyes have witness you might have heard but I literally witnessed it they have returned to the land and they are in land right now praise God hallelujah they're in the land right now so what are we experiencing then if I bring you all to your Graves and I'll bring you back to your land he's literally speaking that he is bringing us to see there is a resurrection of Israel the resurrection of Israel not the resurrection of Jesus Christ but a Revival that goes for the whole nation amen is what's fixing to take place under the ministries of the two witnesses which is Moses and Elijah for Moses is the chief uh Prophet amen the chief law giver and Elijah is the chief Prophet if they believe nobody else they'll believe Moses if they believe no Prophet they'll believe Elijah because they always have a seat waiting for his return they know he's coming back and so they always have a seat for his return when he comes they even put a meal there waiting for him when he returns and it's going to happen but not the way they're thinking about it because is not going to go to Every House like Father Christmas or an old Nick amen but the Bible says that they're going to be killed in the streets for the testimony of the word of God and of Jesus Christ which means they are going to preach that Jesus Christ is the messiah they're going to preach that Jesus Christ is and was the Messiah and that they they killed them because they were blinded and that is why the scripture says in that day you will say how is it where you got these wounds where did you get these holes in your hands I got them in the house of my friends amen the Bible says and they will weep and mourn afore they recognize what they've done right now they say we didn't do it we never crucified them the Romans did it but the fact is you know the scripture tells you they stand behind the scenes and the religious powers influence the federal powers to commit the ACT right and this brother Brown said that's what's going to happen with the bride of course same thing is going to happen the the religious power will get behind the federal powers and incite them to come to persecute the Bride of Jesus Christ they will get behind all use all the federal powers like like like cats having his hand in the glove until he's ready to let the claws come out and grab a hold of you is exactly what is going on right now praise the name of the Lord hallelujah and this great uh this great transformation or this great dispensational change which is now taking place it actually already started from since the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ and the word started to be preached uh in uh in its stages right through the church ages is their eyes opening up more and more our eyes are opened up to the fullness of the word but spiritually the whole nation isn't woke up and it's waking up because of that that great uh transformation taking place from your Resurrection right on to the Rapture blessed be the name of the Lord praise God may the Lord bless you all here tonight and I pray that in your life my life the life of this church that God will show us what he means by making all things new praise the Lord Of course that means you're going to have a new pastor that means you're going to have a new way of doing things that of course means also that God is going to move the church into a new realm praise the Lord because I can see that doesn't take much for me to see that that the the church will move into a new realm and whoever God puts here God has plans for them because remember we all are not called to do the same thing and it doesn't matter it'll use the other person whoever that person is to do his will and bring about it with the word in the word but differently because we built differently and God does it that way that's the way he does it to accomplish his own goals now those persons or person may not even know who have God has in this mind what is God's plans and the plans will then begin to unfold until one day there is oh now I see amen and get a sense of direction not a general sense of direction but a specific sense of direction for the glory of God Amen Lord bless you all real good and I believe that this is surely coming to pass because God will make all things new for his glory praise the Lord O my praise God I left the other page at home I tore it out of the notebook I was writing on and I left the other page at home that's why I look to see whatever else I had here so praise God now just quickly I'll show you some photographs afterwards but Antigo is wonderful and uh the island is is a small island it is not as a big city like us Jamaica but it's a very small island you can actually drive around the entire Island in one day you can drive around the entire Island but we didn't do that because you're stopping to see various sites and then you'll have to do it again so we'll have to go back to see the other sites and uh it but it's beautiful countryside it's wonderful simple people but simple people with a high degree of um what should I say a high degree of intelligence even but they just have this appearance of being ordinary and and simple like that you wouldn't tell you wouldn't know all right and uh they live very simply you don't see any reason to have to you know show anything whether it's wealth whether it's powerful they don't see any need to do that so they just go around normally we met brother shibaba there of course he's professor in the University most everybody knows him not on the whole island they don't know him but in the major city and stuff the people know him and um uh the university there oh by the way I thought it was one but it's not one University it's about two or three but the one that he's teaching in um or professor over is the International University where students come from the United States come from Canada Australia England different parts of the world but whichever country and they go there to study to uh receive the their doctor's degrees and to be taught praise the Lord so that's where he is and he was very happy of course to see us and happy to find out where the church is at and even he came to church but he came just when it ended because he didn't know the way and it's the first time he was coming so he's kind of mixed up but he got there just as it ended and we stood outside having fellowship with him and married Therese had gone over there and actually she came back just this Monday and um we stood outside and we had Great Fellowship and we give God the praise and he was so excited because only the final the pastor is a the pastor is a pastor and a little businessman um and there it is that the he did not know that a supermarket that all the students loved and always loved to go to belongs to the pastor and that the pastor and his wife are usually there in that Supermarket during the day and he says that is only like a 10 minutes walk from my house and you were there all the time I hear them talking about the supermarket and everything else he says well you're going to see me now right you're going to see me now and he made the acquaintance of the pastor talked with him and now you know the way is opened up for that I must also said I had another opportunity his son Martin whom you know we married right here um he goes over and visits the dad but to my surprise more people knows him than even the father so what's he said I don't know but the boy takes the car and he goes out and he just talks to people and he has a whole lot of friends and um one of those friends which was a farmer was sick and so he asked me to go and I prayed for this gentleman that was sick that God would touch him because his body was with a stroke and like that and we praise the name of the Living God God's spirit began to move in him such a wonderful way actually when I talked to him I'm going to find out what's happening with that gentleman I have no doubt that by now he's well or getting well for the glory of God and so um and then on the Sunday we preach in the church and the sermon was one which you heard because you know uh prepared ground right that's what I talked about prepared ground and oh my just yesterday I spoke to um a few of the brothers there and they're still talking amen see you see don't take this for granted you take it for granted because you hear it a good time ago and now you understand but hearing that for the first time you mean to say that I was actually prepared beforehand for the glory of God Amen or you you won't be able to survive you couldn't receive the seed we went through the rocky ground and so on so God prepared the soil that would receive receive that seed he knows what human being was going to get that seed and that the seed would then the age and time and so on the seed would come to life and you know we began to talk like that and just like I'm talking tonight I just just wrote a few things down like that because I didn't feel that I need to go there and you know give them a whole lot too much at one time so I just stood up and started talking I would like that out of the Bible and it was good so they can see that it's coming right out of the word and take them to Mary and take them to Jeremiah and God said before I before you even born I knew you already you know I knew you already before you were in your mother's womb I knew you oh my and then we can explain he's telling him before you even came into flesh I knew you you had an existence before you come into flesh you were with me before you come in the flesh you were in my mind before you come in the flesh and so I knew you before you came here this is you just manifested and you coming here now to be a prophet amen and and I ordained you not by the system ordaining you from some degree or from the Seminary that you got but they ordained you to be a prophet before the foundation of the world Amen imagine that that brother Bill that a baby comes ordained oh my brother Bill a baby comes ordained Jeremiah was ordained before he was even fully on the scene so we talked about that and how Mary you know was ground prepared to receive the word and bring the word to a manifestation the word made flesh and took an angel to come and bring the word for her you know typed in brother Branham as that angel for our day and the bride be in the Virgin for this day and if you bring it individually God has a preacher somebody's going to bring the word uh amen and then God quickens you you come to life praise the Lord so we talked along those lines I'm not going to preach the sermon but uh uh God bless you we had a wonderful time they were praising God they were giving God the glory and one more thing happened there as I was preaching preaching and preaching I keep being pulled to two young boys that were sitting like in the third Pew they were just sitting there in the third Pew and you know I tried to keep preaching and not uh but it keeps pulling me there before I know it the holy spirit said um you're going to be raised up to be preachers amen the hand of the Lord will be on you and you will become preachers and God's spirit just moved on the congregation moved on those young men in a wonderful way praise the Lord hallelujah and so then I've just began I began to tell them that thinketh not strange these things happen because I started preaching when I was you know 14 years old you know calling get called at 12 14 I'm preaching and the word began to grow from that time to now so don't think it's strange just let the Lord have his way in a marvelous and wonderful way so that's another um remarkable thing that happened for God's glory and praise the other one I wouldn't talk about in the sense of the astonishment of the people and of a particular brother couldn't believe my age he's just shaking his head and coming back he says you're gonna be eating something I said I'm eating the word I'm eating the word here right he says no no no no no I know that we all believe the word and so on what do you eat right he's still not getting it that is not just what you eat but the Holy Spirit but then I had to quote him the scripture where God tells you that if you follow my word and the word gets in you and you grow by it uh you know your whole body your skin your this that you know the spirit of Abraham and all that it was a blessing praise the name of the Lord It's a Wonderful brother and the pastor wonderful they took us out to a beautiful uh Italian restaurant amen lots of Italians there lots of Italians on the island but I didn't go to that quarter Chinese are on the island they are everywhere anyway and they have restaurants and laundries on the island an embassy on the island and um yes sir and but mostly the island is dominated by the British Americans go in there also with their marvelous yachts and the British with their big yachts and millionaires billionaires multi-millionaires and and they feel free and safe because the island is basically um it's there's no danger to the point there is no snakes on the island there's no wild animals on the island so um there's nothing so the tourists are walking freely in the city and everything else alone women could walk alone or they walk together or whatever and they're not troubled I asked the brother I said brother what's going on what's Happening Here what's the crime rate he said brother there really is no crime rate because we don't have any crime right if if there's some little thing happens it's the it's the headlines for the newspaper over the whole country right now not to say that you don't have Petty crimes like somebody's stealing a chicken or a duck oh you know or something like that or in the city there might be a few pickpockets but not many because they're very strict and other than that people are saved and uh that's in a brief way what I can say about the island of Jamaica sorry Antigua that I keep going over that name the island of Antigua that uh it's a it's a blessed Island and peculiar peculiar in a sense I'm surprised that the humility of the people and how they move in that kind of a way we visited another place of repute called The Devil's Bridge and what that is is the Atlantic Ocean on this side of the island is the Atlantic and on the other side is the Caribbean Sea and they meet somewhere in the middle there but this side the water is rougher and on the side with the Caribbean Sea it's calmer Bluer and really nice so it's different but on the Atlantic side where it's kind of rough we were taken to a place called The Devil's Bridge and it's just water like um pounding against the rocky Coastline after Royal made a great big hole there until this piece of rock goes like that and there's nothing under it so they call it the Devil's Bridge and because it's a separation is there between a little bit of Separation the water goes under the bridge and then it pours out of this Gap that's there like that and friends I asked them well what is why you call it the Devil's Bridge he said because this has been here for many years and this you know it's growing more and more the fact is that many of the slaves that were brought here from Africa become so discouraged with their lot in life and they couldn't take it anymore and before I be a slave and suffer like this then they went and they committed suicide by jumping off for the Devil's Bridge into the Atlantic Ocean and that is why now it's a little tour site for people to go and see it but there are other sites with different other things I didn't get to go to the museum I didn't get to go to um you know there was there was a sir what's his name again duck yard Nelson Lord Nelson's dockyard where he brought the British Fleet to us there and by the British Fleet they were able to control the entire West Indies the French went and took that island but they could only hold it for about I think six months and that was it and they had to get out because the British were powerful in those days and they they control the island until now they have Independence but they still aligned with the British there very very much so praise the Lord and I would encourage you if you have an opportunity go visit the island visit the Saints on the island and have a wonderful time while you're there praise the Lord we're going to close the service here tonight our gracious father we thank you for these beloved saints of God who came here tonight with great expectation and father all you told them is that behold I make all things new please father
