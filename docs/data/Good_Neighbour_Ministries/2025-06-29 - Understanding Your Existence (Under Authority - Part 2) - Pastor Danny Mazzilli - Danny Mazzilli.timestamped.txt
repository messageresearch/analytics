[33:29] great expect.
[33:36] Amen.
[33:38] Praise God.
[33:40] Yes.
[33:43] Glory. Amen.
[33:48] Sorry for the technical issues this
[33:51] morning. We don't want to keep you
[33:52] standing too long. Uh you may be seated
[33:55] for a minute while we um just make a few
[33:58] comments and thank the Lord for his
[34:00] goodness. Amen. I want to thank God for
[34:04] um for the air conditioning. Amen. If
[34:07] you were here if you were here on uh on
[34:10] Wednesday night, you know exactly how it
[34:12] kind of felt in here. And if you if you
[34:15] were really still, then you were fine.
[34:17] But if you started to get a little too
[34:19] zealous for the Lord, you would you'd be
[34:21] sweating. So, um, we want to thank God
[34:24] because it's been a battle. I'll tell
[34:26] you, it's been a battle to get
[34:28] technicians. It's been a battle. But,
[34:30] uh, Brother Alvin had to go into
[34:32] supernatural sunship mode. Amen. And
[34:35] when you do that, when you when you just
[34:37] when you just say, "Well, you know, all
[34:39] I said to him, I said, "Brother, we need
[34:40] air conditioning on Sunday. That's all I
[34:42] know." And so, God is going to make a
[34:44] way. Just make yourself available and
[34:46] watch him do it. And God came on the
[34:48] scene and started inspiring our brother.
[34:51] and uh you know he was able to get the
[34:52] parts, couldn't get the people to come
[34:54] out. Then certain people were pricing
[34:57] the you know the parts for us at um I'm
[34:59] going to say eight times what we paid
[35:05] thousands of dollars. It was ridiculous.
[35:07] But anyways, God is good. Amen. God is
[35:10] good. God knows exactly what we have
[35:12] need of in the body right here in the
[35:14] local body. And he has placed
[35:16] individuals that have recognized that if
[35:19] they just get into their position,
[35:22] God takes control. God supernaturally
[35:27] will make a way in every aspect of that
[35:30] position. Amen. It puts them in a
[35:32] position of authority. This is what
[35:33] we're going to continue on uh talking
[35:35] about here today. And so I want to thank
[35:37] God for that. Um, God bless all of those
[35:40] that um that are, you know, taking the
[35:42] time to be here to help to do the little
[35:45] parts that they do in the house of the
[35:47] Lord, the cleaning. We need more
[35:49] cleaners. We need more cleaners. I
[35:53] believe there's anointed sons and
[35:55] daughters of God that are that want to
[35:57] be blessed. I don't know if you you know
[36:00] you understand, but when you get into a
[36:02] position in the body of Christ and you
[36:05] do it with with a pure heart, get ready.
[36:09] You're going to get blessed. It's as
[36:11] simple as that. I don't care what
[36:13] anybody else says. Get just get into
[36:15] that position and watch and see if you
[36:18] don't get the courage, the confidence,
[36:21] the blessing, the anointing that comes
[36:23] with it. And all of a sudden, you start
[36:25] to see other things in your life coming
[36:27] together. And you understand, you don't
[36:28] why? Whoa. This I've been dealing with
[36:31] this thing for so long. I didn't do
[36:33] anything different. Yes, you did. You
[36:35] got into your position. And when you're
[36:37] in your position, God pours out his
[36:40] blessings because that's the way the
[36:42] body works. There's a supernatural
[36:44] element to the body of Christ. Amen. And
[36:47] so, we want to thank God. Uh I want to
[36:49] thank God for the service on Wednesday
[36:51] night. If you haven't had a chance to
[36:53] listen in, brother Tombbe, Emmanuel
[36:55] Tombbe ministered on um you know, God's,
[36:58] you know, valley of decision, you know,
[37:00] the the Lord honing the the body and and
[37:04] allowing individuals that, you know, to
[37:07] to realize that, hey, if you're not
[37:08] going to step up, God is going to God,
[37:12] you just go back and read the
[37:13] scriptures. Listen to what he was saying
[37:15] and the scriptures that he read. God
[37:17] says, no, send them away. I don't need
[37:20] them. I need those those that I know are
[37:24] are are recognizing their position,
[37:26] realizing that they've got a life that
[37:29] they're walking with God. They've got a
[37:31] prayer life. They've got a a a they've
[37:34] got an understanding of their position
[37:36] and that God is with them. Amen. Because
[37:39] that's the position in this hour you
[37:41] need to know God is with you. Otherwise,
[37:43] you're in a position and you're just
[37:44] playing church. There's a difference.
[37:47] one by revelation and one by works.
[37:51] We're not looking for works. I don't
[37:53] want to hear all the things that you can
[37:54] do. I want to see them. I want to see
[37:57] God says, "I want you to I want you to
[37:59] get into your position, activate
[38:00] yourself, and do things for the glory of
[38:03] God." And then you watch God come on the
[38:05] scene. Amen. Glory to God. So, I really
[38:08] appreciated that message. I think it
[38:10] everybody needs to listen in on that.
[38:12] And uh God says, "I'll fight for you."
[38:15] That's what he told him. He says he he
[38:16] honed it down from was it 35 or 32,000
[38:20] uh soldiers all the way down to 300 and
[38:23] something and and he they went up
[38:25] against a mighty army and God said don't
[38:27] worry I will fight that battle for you.
[38:31] When you come into that understanding
[38:33] and you're in a battle, you understand
[38:36] that God is going to fight that battle
[38:37] for you. You could face anything.
[38:40] Amen. That's the courage that David had
[38:42] when he faced Goliath. Glory to God. I
[38:45] want to remind the young people about
[38:47] the upcoming meetings in July at Grace
[38:50] Tabernacle with Pastor Alistister
[38:52] Francis. I encourage every single one of
[38:55] you if you can make those meetings be
[38:59] there. Go. You're going to get blessed.
[39:01] I'm telling you right now. I I'm I
[39:05] believe it will. I'm going to be there.
[39:07] Okay? So, if you can be there, be there.
[39:10] Make a way. Take off that day. If you
[39:13] know you got to work that weekend or
[39:15] something, arrange for it now so that
[39:17] you can be there. I believe God is going
[39:20] to do something really special for our
[39:23] young people in these meetings. We've
[39:25] got our upcoming meetings that are
[39:27] coming in September. Okay? We want to
[39:29] start praying for those uh supporting
[39:32] them uh you know, keep it uh sharing you
[39:36] know what God is doing and how God is
[39:38] going to bless our young people's um
[39:41] fall meetings. Amen. Praise God. So,
[39:44] let's get into action, saints. This is
[39:48] the final stages of what God is doing.
[39:50] Amen. Glory to God. Amen. Let's all rise
[39:53] up.
[39:54] Let's rise up for the Lord this morning.
[39:57] We're going to go to um to our
[39:59] scripture. Um we're going to be uh Go
[40:02] ahead, put up the um
[40:05] put up the first slide there.
[40:08] I'm glad that you're here. We're glad
[40:10] that you're here. Anybody got the
[40:13] PowerPoint up there?
[40:16] Praise God. Amen. Glory to God.
[40:20] Thank you, Jesus.
[40:24] Things are coming together. I'm telling
[40:26] you, there's a lot of change that's
[40:28] going to come in this ministry. There's
[40:31] going to be you're going to see I'm
[40:33] talking naturally, okay? There's going
[40:35] to be a lot of natural change that
[40:37] you're going to start to see uh with the
[40:40] sanctuary being changed, our audio, our
[40:42] visual system being upgraded to the top
[40:45] of the line stuff. I'm talking top of
[40:48] the line. Amen. Praise God. God's
[40:51] already made it very clear that it's
[40:53] going to happen. All we need to do is
[40:55] say, "Thank you, Lord." And let it all
[40:57] unfold in his time and season. Amen. So,
[41:01] all these things we're going to we're
[41:02] going to we're going to strengthen.
[41:03] We're going to fortify our audio team
[41:05] with the best that God can offer. Amen.
[41:09] And um we're going to enhance these
[41:11] things for the glory of God. Amen.
[41:14] Because we're not this is God's
[41:16] business. This is this is the father's
[41:18] business and we must be about the
[41:21] father's business. Amen. Let's go to um
[41:24] our next slide. So, we're going to
[41:25] continue. We started um a couple weeks
[41:28] ago, we ministered on being under
[41:30] authority places you in authority. And
[41:32] we talked about a father's authority and
[41:34] how this is God's provided way for the
[41:37] body of Christ. And as I was studying
[41:40] this and going deeper into it, all of a
[41:42] sudden things just started to unveil and
[41:45] open up. And I said, "Wow, this is a
[41:47] series." And I believe that it's
[41:50] something that that if you if you just
[41:52] get in with me, get into the atmosphere,
[41:56] let the Holy Spirit just, you know, pull
[41:59] pull you just pull on the word of God.
[42:01] Amen. Let's let God use the gifts that
[42:03] are amongst us. Not just me on Sunday. I
[42:06] believe that it was even in the service
[42:08] on Wednesday night. I believe that it
[42:09] was in the service last weekend. I
[42:11] believe that it's it's all the mighty
[42:14] angel himself. This is what we have to
[42:16] realize that this is God in the final
[42:20] stages of his ministry where he is
[42:23] uniting himself fully with the church,
[42:27] the bride. Remember, there's going to be
[42:30] a bride that's going to come out of the
[42:31] church. You can no longer exist in the
[42:34] church.
[42:36] This is the time for the bride to come
[42:38] out of the church. Because there's a lot
[42:41] of churches out there under tradition
[42:42] and under under legalism and under
[42:45] bondage, not realizing that this message
[42:47] is moving on. And that's why people
[42:50] remain in in certain conditions because
[42:52] they have not recognized the turning of
[42:56] the dispensation and the season that we
[42:59] are now living in. Amen. Praise God. And
[43:02] so let's go to our scripture. We want to
[43:05] look at understanding your existence.
[43:09] Strange title, but you're existing here.
[43:13] And a lot of you are living in a hell
[43:17] existence.
[43:18] a nightmare existence.
[43:21] You're still overcoming things that you
[43:23] thought, "My God, why am I still having
[43:26] to deal with this situation? Why is this
[43:28] thing not gone in my life?" Why? Because
[43:31] you have not fully understood
[43:34] your existence in the body of Christ and
[43:38] your purpose and what God has anointed
[43:41] you to perform and to fulfill in this
[43:44] day. There's a bride that has a
[43:46] ministry. She's coming into that
[43:49] ministry with full authority.
[43:52] Amen. Because she recognizes that his
[43:55] authority once you've come under the
[43:58] authority of the word for your day and
[44:00] for this hour, it gives you authority.
[44:03] And you need to enter into that and get
[44:05] out of this these these conditions and
[44:08] these these terrible mental oppressions
[44:11] and depression and and sickness and and
[44:15] and relationship issues and all kinds of
[44:18] situations. Amen. It's time to rise up
[44:21] saints and come out of those conditions.
[44:23] Let's read the word of God. Our first
[44:25] scripture
[44:27] is from Colossians
[44:31] 1:es 12 to18.
[44:34] Let us pray. Father, as we now go to
[44:37] your word, we're asking you to raise a
[44:40] standard in the midst here this morning.
[44:44] Lord, let the people settle down in
[44:46] their hearts and just relax in your
[44:50] presence. And Lord, I'm going to yield
[44:52] this vessel completely. I'm giving it
[44:54] completely over to you, Father. Take
[44:57] control. Speak what needs to be spoken,
[45:00] Lord. I know that it's going to speak
[45:01] right back to me, too, because I believe
[45:03] in the supernatural possession of the
[45:06] Holy Spirit in the five-fold ministry.
[45:08] And Lord, let your ears be upon the
[45:11] people to have ears to hear what they
[45:14] need to hear so that they can live in a
[45:17] in a higher realm, in a in a more
[45:20] victorious lifestyle and victory around
[45:24] themselves and in their lives and and in
[45:26] their their homes and in their
[45:28] workplaces and in whatever environment
[45:30] that they're in. Lord, let them walk
[45:33] with you and have victory in these
[45:35] areas. Lord, it's time for this bride to
[45:38] be brought on display. Lord, I truly
[45:41] believe it with all of my heart. Grant
[45:43] it. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Giving
[45:46] thanks unto the Father, which hath made
[45:49] us meat to be partakers
[45:52] of the inheritance of the saints in
[45:55] light,
[45:57] who hath delivered us from the power of
[46:00] darkness. Hath, past tense, hath. Okay.
[46:05] do not stay anymore where you are. From
[46:08] this day on, we're moving on. Amen. And
[46:12] hath translated us, translated us into
[46:16] the kingdom of his dear son, in whom we
[46:19] have redemption through his blood, even
[46:22] the forgiveness of sin. So, you don't
[46:24] need to be holding on to any sin.
[46:27] You're forgiven. If you've entered in,
[46:30] you're you're washed. You're brand new.
[46:31] You you you're you never done it in the
[46:33] first place. Amen. Amen. Oh, glory. In
[46:37] who is the image of the invisible God,
[46:41] the firstborn of every creature. For by
[46:45] him were all things created. There's
[46:47] nothing that was not created that was
[46:49] created by him
[46:52] that are in heaven and that are in earth
[46:57] visible and invisible whether they be
[47:00] thrones or dominions or principalities
[47:03] or powers. Listen, did you hear what he
[47:06] said there? Whether they be thrones,
[47:08] dominions, principalities or powers, we
[47:11] fight not against flesh and blood.
[47:15] It's powers and he's given us dominion
[47:18] over all of them.
[47:20] Every single one of them. Amen.
[47:22] Invisible, visible, it doesn't matter.
[47:25] Whatever it is, God's given you dominion
[47:28] over it. Amen. Whether they be thrones,
[47:30] dominions, principality, all things were
[47:33] created by him and for him. And he is
[47:38] before all things and by him all things
[47:42] consist. everything.
[47:44] There's nothing that, oh, I I can do
[47:47] this. I'm that. I I'm I can I'm great.
[47:50] I'm I'm a great businessman or I'm I'm
[47:52] the best, you know, at doing this and
[47:54] that. No, no, no. That's not him. That's
[47:58] pride. That's that's that's the
[48:01] anointing of the principalities and the
[48:03] dominions because to recognize him in
[48:06] you is your hope of glory. And then you
[48:09] you you can't fail but to give him the
[48:11] glory and the praise because now you've
[48:13] come into his dominion, his authority,
[48:17] his kingdom, and everything has to come
[48:20] subject to him. And if you're in him,
[48:22] they come subject to you. Glory to God.
[48:26] And he is before all things, and by him
[48:28] all things consist. And he is the head
[48:30] of the body, the church, the body, who
[48:35] is the beginning, the firstborn from the
[48:38] dead, that in all things he might have
[48:43] what? The preeminence. You may be
[48:46] seated.
[48:49] Glory to God. Thank you, Jesus. That he
[48:53] might have the preeminence. Glory. So we
[48:57] want to look at understanding your
[48:59] existence, understanding our purpose,
[49:01] our position. Why do we exist in this
[49:04] day and in this hour? There's a lot of
[49:07] people that that are claiming
[49:09] Christianity. They're claiming Christ,
[49:12] but yet they are living defeated lives.
[49:15] They are living in a condition where
[49:17] they don't even understand their
[49:19] existence. And all they want to do is
[49:21] they want to end their existence. here.
[49:23] A lot of people, oh, I just want to get
[49:26] out of this dimension. There's going to
[49:28] be a time for us to get out of this
[49:30] dimension. It's going to happen in the
[49:32] moment and in the twinkling of an eye.
[49:34] Amen. But let it be in God's time
[49:38] because he needs you right now to
[49:39] recognize the and understand your
[49:42] existence and how he needs you to be in
[49:45] your position so that he can fulfill his
[49:48] plan and his purpose because it's all
[49:50] for him. Everything was for him. Go to
[49:54] the next slide. Brother Brandham
[49:56] speaking here in Christ is the mystery
[49:57] of God revealed. He says, "But what he
[50:00] wanted to do, he loved fatherhood
[50:04] for he was a father." That's who God is.
[50:08] We're listen father is only a word. But
[50:12] we, you know, God uses language for us
[50:14] to understand so that we can communicate
[50:17] here as human beings while we're in
[50:19] these human vessels.
[50:21] But his way of really really
[50:24] communicating to the sons and daughters
[50:26] of God, and you're already experiencing
[50:28] it, is by revelation.
[50:30] That's your true communion and
[50:33] relationship and fellowship with God.
[50:36] It's by revelation. But he uses words.
[50:39] And even the word father doesn't even
[50:42] fathom or or even come close to what he
[50:45] really is. He's the self-existent one.
[50:50] Amen. But here and the only way that he
[50:52] could express it was to become a son of
[50:56] man. He had to take on human flesh so
[51:00] that he could
[51:02] connect with man. Connect with with with
[51:06] man so that man could have an
[51:07] understanding that God was and is a
[51:12] reality. He's not just something that
[51:14] was spoken of in the Old Testament that
[51:16] the children of Israel experienced when
[51:18] they saw the pillar of fire. No, he
[51:20] wanted to come and manifest himself with
[51:23] his people so that he could go to the
[51:25] next step which to which is to be in his
[51:28] people.
[51:30] And so here now he says, see that's the
[51:33] reason Jesus kept saying the son the son
[51:36] of man. You see he had to come into a
[51:39] human form. He had to take on a
[51:42] supernatural human form, but yet he was
[51:45] human so that he could go to the cross
[51:47] and fulfill his promise that if a man's
[51:50] sin, a man had to die. And that's why
[51:53] you can never even you can't even talk
[51:56] about the Lord until you've accepted the
[51:58] sacrifice, which is the Holy Ghost,
[52:01] giving up of the Holy Ghost to come back
[52:03] upon you. Without the Holy Ghost, you're
[52:06] not going to understand what I'm saying
[52:07] here today.
[52:09] I'm not I'm not talking about a
[52:10] traditional Holy Ghost. I'm talking
[52:12] about the Holy Ghost in this hour.
[52:15] Christ in the present stage of his
[52:17] ministry until you come into that
[52:20] revelation. And that's what's that
[52:22] that's what all the churches are missing
[52:23] out there. They're feeding on Jesus
[52:25] Christ yesterday, but they fail to
[52:28] recognize what he's doing today in the
[52:30] power of his resurrection in the in the
[52:33] spirit of his of the Holy Ghost. And
[52:36] when you receive the Holy Ghost, you
[52:39] receive the ability to hear the word.
[52:42] Not just the word that to read the
[52:44] letter that that can kill, but the
[52:46] spirit. You can hear by the spirit and
[52:50] receive life through the word, which
[52:52] gives you the ability to overcome in
[52:54] this age. That's why your existence,
[52:57] some people are living in a hellish
[53:00] existence. They can't get over so many
[53:03] things. They got broken families, broken
[53:05] relationships, broken finance, broken
[53:09] health, all kinds of situations because
[53:12] they're not recognizing their authority
[53:15] and what God requires by you accepting
[53:18] the word in your day. Amen. Glory to
[53:22] God. And so he goes on here. He says,
[53:24] he's talking about many of them. But
[53:26] now, now you get it. Congregation says,
[53:28] "Amen." See, he wanted to express
[53:30] himself. that he was his
[53:34] that was his one of his great threefold
[53:38] purposes was to express himself identify
[53:42] himself with human beings to reveal
[53:46] himself in Christ and secondly to have
[53:50] the preeminence in the body of believers
[53:53] that is his bride that he might live in
[53:59] people. Do you know that was his desire
[54:02] right from the very beginning? He was
[54:04] God. He was the self-existent one. And
[54:07] when he was when he was all by himself,
[54:10] he had attributes within him. And every
[54:13] one of those attributes was God.
[54:17] Every one of those attributes was God.
[54:19] And when he when he said, "Let us
[54:22] make man in our image," he was talking
[54:26] to himself and all of the attributes
[54:29] because he had a desire to have
[54:32] fellowship.
[54:33] And when one of those attributes when he
[54:36] said, "Let us make man." And when that
[54:39] took place and Adam was formed in the
[54:42] image of God, in Adam was male and
[54:46] female. Do you know the whole universe
[54:48] operates on positive and negative? You
[54:51] can't have electricity without it. You
[54:53] can't have you can't have magnetism
[54:55] without a south pole and a north pole.
[54:58] And you can't have, you know, water
[55:00] pressure without high pressure and low
[55:03] pressure. You can't have light without
[55:06] darkness.
[55:08] You can't have good without evil. the
[55:11] whole universe and everything that
[55:13] because of this universe. I'm talking
[55:14] about where we are. Listen, I'm not
[55:18] going to get too too heavily spiritual
[55:20] here on you. I know where you're at a
[55:23] lot of you right now. You need
[55:25] deliverance.
[55:27] I'm talking about things in this
[55:29] dimension right here, right now, where
[55:31] you can get victory over those things
[55:34] now.
[55:35] If you can just receive what God wants
[55:37] to give us. Amen. This is not my ideas.
[55:40] I didn't go all of a sudden to decide to
[55:42] start preaching on this. This is the
[55:44] Holy Spirit wanting to set us free to
[55:48] deliver us from the situations that
[55:49] we're under. Amen. And I believe that if
[55:53] we just surrender to it, God will do it.
[55:55] We're going to have praise reports.
[55:57] We're going to have victory reports
[55:59] coming right out of this place. Amen.
[56:01] Because he wants to live. He wants to
[56:04] have the preeminence. Amen. Praise God.
[56:07] And so in Proverbs, go to the next
[56:10] slide. In Proverbs uh 29:2,
[56:14] he says, "When we read this last time,
[56:16] we we ministers, when the righteous are
[56:18] in authority,
[56:20] the people rejoice."
[56:22] And and and and look, but when the
[56:25] wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.
[56:28] Well, let me tell you who the wicked
[56:30] are.
[56:32] It's not your brother or your sister.
[56:35] It's not your boss.
[56:38] It's powers and principalities and
[56:40] dominions that are operating in this
[56:43] realm of existence.
[56:47] This is going to this is going to take a
[56:49] few services, but we are going to be
[56:50] breaking things down to see how this
[56:54] dimension that we are now in has so much
[56:57] influence upon our lives. And we're
[56:59] going to we are going to expose things
[57:03] in in each and every one of our lives so
[57:06] that we can be free. How many are
[57:08] interested? How many want to participate
[57:11] in that? Amen. Praise God. I want total
[57:15] deliverance, brother Phillip. Total. I
[57:18] don't want partial deliverance. When the
[57:20] day comes that that it's going to be
[57:22] that in the twinkling of an eye, all
[57:24] that's going to happen is we're just
[57:26] going to change from one dimension to
[57:27] the other. That's all that's going to
[57:29] be. But while we're here, we are going
[57:31] to progress into a total deliverance
[57:34] relationship with Jesus Christ and this
[57:38] earth. And every power and every
[57:40] dominion and every principality is going
[57:42] to have to come subject to the word.
[57:46] And if he's in you, guess what?
[57:49] Let's take a look at authority.
[57:54] Jesus had authority over his existence.
[57:56] How many knows that? He recognized when
[57:58] he came here on the earth. And to
[58:00] understand God's authority, we must
[58:03] realize that there's a conflict within
[58:06] the universe for authority.
[58:10] The enemy is a deceiver. He was a
[58:13] deceiver right from the very beginning.
[58:15] And he will use every avenue possible to
[58:19] deceive you and bring you under the
[58:22] wrong authority when you think you're
[58:24] under the authority of God. Meanwhile,
[58:27] Satan has you. Gossip spirits,
[58:31] uh, rebellious spirits, not willing to
[58:34] submit to your boss at work. You know,
[58:38] you're you're you're you're you're like
[58:39] a mule.
[58:41] When something when somebody says you
[58:43] got, you know, can you take care of
[58:44] this, take care of that, the leg comes
[58:46] out right away. Teeth, you know what is
[58:51] that?
[58:52] Oh, but I'm a Christian. I go to church
[58:54] every Sunday. That don't make that don't
[58:56] make you a son of God because you go to
[58:59] church every Sunday.
[59:02] What makes you a son of God is when
[59:04] you've come under the authority of the
[59:06] word and you've humbled yourself under
[59:09] God's plan and God's purpose and desire
[59:13] for you as an individual.
[59:16] You don't want to live a defeated life
[59:18] anymore. You want victory in your life.
[59:21] Amen. And so, and so the universe and
[59:25] eternity, you know, uh uh it it's based
[59:28] on on who's going to have the authority.
[59:31] Satan thinks he's in authority, but his
[59:34] rebellion right from the very beginning
[59:36] disqualified him immediately.
[59:40] So, don't think he's got authority over
[59:42] you when you are a son or a daughter of
[59:43] God. The moment you recognize your day
[59:47] and the message, which is the whole
[1:00:39] check.
[1:00:42] Oh, okay.
[1:00:48] having the the the uh God's primary goal
[1:00:52] in creation is to demonstrate and
[1:00:54] establish his preeminence
[1:00:57] in the body of Christ on earth in this
[1:01:02] time.
[1:01:03] Not
[1:01:05] in the days of of William Brham.
[1:01:08] No, not in the days of Moses. Not in the
[1:01:11] days of of all the other prophets. He's
[1:01:13] looking to establish preeminence in the
[1:01:15] church in this day and in this hour. And
[1:01:19] that's where he wants absolute and total
[1:01:21] preeminence. This is where everything
[1:01:24] comes together. This is where we
[1:01:25] culminate into what's called the
[1:01:27] rapture. Amen. So that's why we're
[1:01:30] interested in what God is doing today
[1:01:32] because that's that's what's going to
[1:01:34] translate us. That's what's going to
[1:01:36] change us. Amen. God and man in harmony
[1:01:40] having dominion over the earth. Amen.
[1:01:43] Remember, because God is God, all should
[1:01:46] be subject to him. Unfortunately, men
[1:01:51] and angels have refused. You know that
[1:01:54] listen when God you know God's first
[1:01:57] creation was angels
[1:01:59] because and those angels did you realize
[1:02:01] that those angels had to had to have
[1:02:03] been given free moral agency because why
[1:02:07] would they have rebelled against God and
[1:02:11] taken Satan's side because they were
[1:02:13] given free moral agency. So there was So
[1:02:17] in other words, there's a dimension
[1:02:19] where angels operate just the same as
[1:02:22] this dimension here where there's
[1:02:24] communication, where there's talk, where
[1:02:26] there's plans, where's the where there's
[1:02:28] deception. Amen. We're going to be
[1:02:30] looking at all those things so that we
[1:02:32] can expose the enemy wherever he might
[1:02:36] be, where he's got us defeated. Whatever
[1:02:38] it is, whatever you want. Listen, I hope
[1:02:42] in your heart this morning, you're going
[1:02:44] to you're going to put that thing in
[1:02:45] your heart and say, "Lord, this area of
[1:02:48] my life, this situation, this
[1:02:51] circumstance, Lord, I want I want your
[1:02:55] mind, your word for me so that I can
[1:02:58] receive it and I can walk out of here
[1:03:02] transformed and allow the word now to
[1:03:04] just do what it has to do."
[1:03:06] Then you just go into a a a state into a
[1:03:09] a a a place of rest where you just wait
[1:03:13] on God. Amen. And let him prove his own
[1:03:15] word. Amen. But you know, uh men and
[1:03:19] angels have refused to be subject to him
[1:03:21] and have been in rebellion towards God's
[1:03:24] authority. And that's why we've got
[1:03:26] demon power in this dimension that is
[1:03:30] absolutely in rebellion to the word of
[1:03:33] God. doesn't want anything good to
[1:03:36] happen in your life. Amen. Because he
[1:03:39] wants you to remain in that defeated
[1:03:42] condition. See, as long as you are
[1:03:44] constantly uh you know questioning, am I
[1:03:48] even a son or daughter of God?
[1:03:51] Am I even am I even uh uh you know born
[1:03:54] again? Gets you questioning yourself
[1:03:58] over and over again. If he can keep you
[1:04:00] in that kind of a condition, I need more
[1:04:02] monitor. If he can keep you in that kind
[1:04:04] of a condition, then you you're not then
[1:04:07] you're you're in a defeated condition
[1:04:09] and you know, you you don't come to
[1:04:11] church, you don't help out, you you
[1:04:14] know, there's volunteers requested, you
[1:04:16] don't show up, you're you're you know,
[1:04:18] there's fellowships, you don't really
[1:04:20] care to show up to the fellowships. Why?
[1:04:22] Because you're in a defeated condition.
[1:04:24] I don't think I want to go to church
[1:04:26] anymore.
[1:04:27] This brother doesn't This brother
[1:04:29] doesn't shake my hand and say, "God
[1:04:31] bless you to me. This one doesn't
[1:04:32] acknowledge me. This sister turns the
[1:04:34] other way. This this you're allowing the
[1:04:37] circumstances of the enemy to control
[1:04:40] your victory in the word of God and live
[1:04:44] so underprivileged as a son or a
[1:04:48] daughter of God that you're constantly
[1:04:50] in a defeated condition. What a terrible
[1:04:54] condition to be in.
[1:04:56] God help us to recognize what God really
[1:04:59] wants for our lives. Amen. Glory to God.
[1:05:03] What is it? It's rebellion
[1:05:06] in and it's evidenced and and we know
[1:05:09] that it's rebellion which is evidenced
[1:05:11] in the very nature of sin.
[1:05:15] Sin is choosing my way over God's way.
[1:05:20] That's what sin is. I'm going to do it
[1:05:22] my way. I don't need to do it God's way.
[1:05:24] You're rebelling. Sin is saying, "I want
[1:05:27] to be my own God." You know, that's
[1:05:30] Satan's lie. You know, that that was
[1:05:33] Satan's original lie when he went to Eve
[1:05:34] and he says, "You shall surely be like
[1:05:37] God
[1:05:39] if you do this because then you'll be
[1:05:41] able to create like he created."
[1:05:44] That was the lie in the beginning. Yeah.
[1:05:47] so that she could she and and and and it
[1:05:50] sounded good, you know, and you got to
[1:05:52] be careful because in even within the
[1:05:55] confines of this message where we are
[1:05:57] talking about that you are God being
[1:06:01] expressed in bride form and you've been
[1:06:05] given the authority by the word of God.
[1:06:07] Listen, if you don't have a revelation
[1:06:09] on what I just said and you don't have
[1:06:11] the character because you still got
[1:06:14] spirits that are controlling you, you
[1:06:16] you can't you can't be told anything
[1:06:18] because you're afraid the person's
[1:06:20] afraid that they're going to find out
[1:06:22] from somebody else cuz they know you got
[1:06:23] a gossip spirit.
[1:06:26] You see, God is not going to place power
[1:06:30] and authority into a character that
[1:06:34] hasn't fully submitted and fully humbled
[1:06:39] himself or herself to the supernatural
[1:06:43] power and authority of God within the
[1:06:46] body. It's as simple as that.
[1:06:50] Did you know that that's that's the way
[1:06:51] God set up the whole universe was based
[1:06:54] on authority? And God has and God shows
[1:06:57] it right from from his start right into
[1:07:00] the home. You know that a father is God
[1:07:03] in the home.
[1:07:05] He's he's like like God and and and the
[1:07:08] wife is like Eve, his helpmate. And the
[1:07:12] children are the garden,
[1:07:15] the offspring.
[1:07:17] It's like a church. the pastor is the
[1:07:20] supreme authority in that church. I'm
[1:07:23] not I'm not telling you that because I'm
[1:07:25] a pastor. I'm telling you that because
[1:07:27] if you can recognize that you can come
[1:07:30] into a place where where now God can use
[1:07:33] the office. Remember, don't look at the
[1:07:36] man. If you see me, a lot of you know
[1:07:39] me. You know my flaws. You know my
[1:07:41] strengths and you know my weaknesses.
[1:07:44] Don't look at those things when it comes
[1:07:46] to the office and the position. be I
[1:07:49] don't need to have a pastor. I don't
[1:07:51] need a man to tell me. I've come into
[1:07:54] the message of the hour and God just
[1:07:56] shows me directly good luck.
[1:07:59] Good luck. And and and and and they'll
[1:08:02] say that and I can look and I can see in
[1:08:04] their life they don't even got victory
[1:08:05] over the simplest little things.
[1:08:10] You see what I'm saying?
[1:08:12] Do we want to come under the the the
[1:08:15] supreme authority of of the word of God?
[1:08:18] So that so that we can in our ministry
[1:08:20] have full effect and authority over the
[1:08:22] circumstances in our lives. The only way
[1:08:25] is when you submit to the supreme
[1:08:29] authority of God's provided way within
[1:08:32] the body of Christ. As long as we are
[1:08:34] here on earth, God is not going to
[1:08:37] change his program.
[1:08:40] He's going to progress the program. Now,
[1:08:44] the mighty angel, and we know that he's
[1:08:46] the supreme authority,
[1:08:48] but he's still in in in the five-fold
[1:08:51] ministry. He's still operating through
[1:08:53] the father that's at home that has a
[1:08:56] revelation of God. Yes, sir.
[1:09:00] Simple, but so profound, so powerful.
[1:09:02] Saints, we want victory in our lives.
[1:09:05] And so, sin and rebellion says, "I want
[1:09:08] to be my own authority.
[1:09:11] I'm going to be authority. I'm going to
[1:09:13] call the shots. I'm going to say the way
[1:09:16] it's going to be.
[1:09:18] But how do we really truly get
[1:09:20] authority?
[1:09:23] I think for us to truly understand this,
[1:09:24] we need to look at one who wielded
[1:09:27] authority properly
[1:09:29] and and see what he did with it and how
[1:09:32] he obtained his authority.
[1:09:36] Jesus is the one we want to look at
[1:09:39] right now. We're just going to look at a
[1:09:40] few scriptures. We're just going to, you
[1:09:42] know, take some examples
[1:09:44] and and you know, if you go to the next
[1:09:47] slide in Matthew chapter, well,
[1:09:50] actually, before we go to that, I want
[1:09:51] to say this that God is light.
[1:09:57] And before there was anything, there was
[1:10:01] God. Do you know that there wasn't even
[1:10:03] light before God? It was when God said,
[1:10:07] "Let there be light that anything could
[1:10:09] actually be seen or recognized."
[1:10:13] Okay? And Jesus
[1:10:16] in John 1 John 1 verse 4 to8 it says,
[1:10:20] "Now listen here, and these things write
[1:10:23] we unto you that your joy may be full."
[1:10:26] Now I want I I I when I was reading the
[1:10:28] scripture, I I always read a few, you
[1:10:31] know, verses before and then after. I
[1:10:33] want to kind of catch the whole thought
[1:10:35] of what the Lord was, you know, kind of
[1:10:37] coming at. And he says here, "And these
[1:10:40] things write we unto you that your joy
[1:10:44] might be full."
[1:10:46] Then this then is the message which we
[1:10:49] have heard of him and declare unto you
[1:10:52] that God is light.
[1:10:55] God is
[1:10:57] light. And look what he says. and in him
[1:11:00] is no darkness at all. So if you come to
[1:11:04] a realization of what the scripture is
[1:11:06] saying here and realizing that that that
[1:11:10] he is pure light, he is pure God.
[1:11:14] There's nothing before him, nothing
[1:11:16] after him. He has the full and supreme
[1:11:19] authority. When that light comes into
[1:11:22] you, that becomes supreme authority in
[1:11:25] you. All right, you're talking now. If
[1:11:28] we say that we have fellowship with him
[1:11:31] and walk in darkness,
[1:11:34] we lie.
[1:11:37] Do you see? He's trying to make it clear
[1:11:39] here. Listen, God is perfect light. And
[1:11:43] if you want total deliverance and you
[1:11:44] want joy, like he said, so that your joy
[1:11:47] might be full. A lot of people are
[1:11:49] miserable. They're not living the in in
[1:11:52] the in the right condition as a true
[1:11:55] Christian in this day and in this hour.
[1:11:57] They're living underprivileged.
[1:12:01] They're not having that full joy that
[1:12:03] they're supposed to be having.
[1:12:07] Amen. And he says we lie and do not the
[1:12:10] truth. Do not the truth. In other words,
[1:12:13] you're living you're speaking and you're
[1:12:15] living contrary to the word of God.
[1:12:20] But if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:12:23] the light, we have fellowship one with
[1:12:26] another. All of a sudden, it brings the
[1:12:28] whole body of Christ together. It brings
[1:12:31] a unity of spirit. It starts to open the
[1:12:34] doors for fellowship with your brothers
[1:12:37] and sisters like you've never had
[1:12:39] before. A lot of people known each other
[1:12:42] for years and years and years and have
[1:12:45] no real fellowship.
[1:12:50] Oh, this is the hour where, listen, I
[1:12:52] don't know about you, but listen, this
[1:12:54] is the hour where the church,
[1:12:58] everything's going to get exposed.
[1:13:00] Everything's going to get the light is
[1:13:03] going to come upon it because this is
[1:13:04] the final hour.
[1:13:06] This is where the honing time comes.
[1:13:08] This is where God God's going to show
[1:13:10] his bride. God's going to show his
[1:13:12] elect. God's going to show the true
[1:13:14] church what's really in her. God's going
[1:13:16] to show if that perfect love, if that
[1:13:18] love capstone ministry is really a part
[1:13:21] of that individual and they've come into
[1:13:24] that recognition, they've come into that
[1:13:26] revelation. They've come into they've
[1:13:28] yielded themselves to the spirit of God
[1:13:30] for the message of this day. Amen. They
[1:13:33] have fellowship one with another. And
[1:13:35] the blood of Jesus Christ, his son,
[1:13:38] cleanses us from all sin. See, when you
[1:13:41] can enter into that kind of fellowship
[1:13:43] where you're naked before God, you you
[1:13:45] don't want to hide nothing anymore. You
[1:13:47] want to listen, Lord. Just ju just
[1:13:49] expose everything in my life, Lord. I
[1:13:51] want to be free. You know what? You know
[1:13:54] what happens? The blood comes and
[1:13:55] cleanses you. It washes you. It purges
[1:13:58] you of your sin and your unbelief, and
[1:14:00] you get set free. It's a supernatural
[1:14:03] experience, saints. We're not talking
[1:14:06] about playing church here. We're talking
[1:14:07] about coming into a relationship with
[1:14:09] God. Personal. Amen. It cleanses us. And
[1:14:13] if we say that we have no sin, we we
[1:14:17] deceive ourselves.
[1:14:19] We're all born in sin, shaped in
[1:14:22] iniquity, speaking lies. You're going to
[1:14:24] go out there tomorrow and you're going
[1:14:26] to make mistakes. But the blood of
[1:14:28] Christ, this is the hour where you've
[1:14:31] where where you're in the body of
[1:14:32] Christ. And so the moment that that that
[1:14:35] something some unbelief tries to poke
[1:14:38] its head through, the blood of Christ
[1:14:40] just swallows it up. Sin tries to poke
[1:14:44] itself out and and you say something,
[1:14:46] "Oh Lord, forgive me." Boom. The blood
[1:14:48] just sucks it right back in again.
[1:14:51] Hallelujah. This listen, his his
[1:14:53] attribute in you cannot return void
[1:14:56] because it's God. He says, "My word will
[1:14:59] not return void." It's God. His word in
[1:15:02] you is God. It's him. So it's He says,
[1:15:05] "You'll understand on that day that I am
[1:15:07] in the Father, ye in me, and I in you."
[1:15:12] Jesus had the authority. Amen. He had
[1:15:15] the authority of God because he knew who
[1:15:18] he was. He says, "I do nothing lest it's
[1:15:22] revealed unto me by my father. the works
[1:15:25] that I do, it's not I that doeth them,
[1:15:27] but the but the Father that dwelleth in
[1:15:31] me, not above me. He didn't say above
[1:15:34] me. He said in me.
[1:15:36] He said to Philillip, "If you see me,
[1:15:38] you see the Father."
[1:15:41] He was in a dispensation.
[1:15:43] Oh, glory to God. Amen. He's in a new
[1:15:46] dispensation in this hour. Amen. Glory.
[1:15:49] I tell you, this is just going to get
[1:15:50] sweeter and sweeter, saints. The very
[1:15:53] nature of Jesus as God clothed in human
[1:15:57] form expresses the authority of God when
[1:16:00] he was here on the earth. So humble but
[1:16:03] yet supreme authority.
[1:16:06] Glory to God. In John we are told that
[1:16:08] he was the beginning and everything was
[1:16:11] created by him and through him. So what
[1:16:15] who makes him who makes him god?
[1:16:20] People get so,
[1:16:23] you know, I was talking to somebody on
[1:16:25] the Trinity
[1:16:26] last week at the market. Super nice guy.
[1:16:29] I love him. You know, and he's zealous
[1:16:32] about the word of God. And you know, we
[1:16:34] were having some good fellowship over
[1:16:36] the last couple weeks. But then the
[1:16:37] other day, the Lord just led me into,
[1:16:39] you know, into well, you know, you know,
[1:16:42] it's like I just brought up it's like
[1:16:44] baptism. You know, we don't baptize
[1:16:45] babies. We believe in baptism in the
[1:16:48] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And you
[1:16:50] know an as an adult, you need to
[1:16:52] recognize that you're a sinner. He that
[1:16:54] Jesus said, "He that believeth and is
[1:16:56] Oh, did that set off what?
[1:17:00] We baptized babies. We we believe in the
[1:17:03] tree." I said, "I can't even find the
[1:17:04] word trinity in the Bible." He said, "I
[1:17:06] can show you tree." He said to me, "I
[1:17:07] can show you trinity in the Old
[1:17:09] Testament, in the New Testament." I
[1:17:10] said, "Where?" "Oh, I'll get it. I, you
[1:17:13] know," I said, "All right." You know, I
[1:17:15] just I just relaxed because I know where
[1:17:18] I listen, we know where we stand with
[1:17:20] this.
[1:17:22] We've we're way down the road now about
[1:17:25] getting into into, you know, I just
[1:17:27] said, "Brother, let's reason together."
[1:17:28] I said, "Sometime maybe we can have a
[1:17:30] breakfast or a lunch together." You
[1:17:32] know, he's one of my suppliers and and
[1:17:34] uh you know, and I said, "We'll get
[1:17:36] together sometime and we can get in on
[1:17:38] the word." And um he says, "Okay, well,
[1:17:40] we'll see." You know, praise God. But I
[1:17:43] saw something really raise up there and
[1:17:45] I thought, "Wow." I said, "This is a
[1:17:47] powerful thing." Trinity, you you got to
[1:17:51] be really careful because, you know,
[1:17:53] well, let's face it, 95 or 98% of the
[1:17:56] churches out there believe in the
[1:17:57] Trinity. So, you're a real minority. You
[1:18:01] know, they feel very powerful. Hey,
[1:18:02] John, is there a Trinity? Of course
[1:18:04] there's a tr Hey, you're a Catholic. You
[1:18:06] is there a Of course there's a TR. They
[1:18:08] could he could ask a hundred people at
[1:18:09] the market and 99 of them are going to
[1:18:12] say yes there's a trinity and the other
[1:18:15] one's going to say I don't know.
[1:18:22] It's a revelation saints. Amen. Praise
[1:18:26] God. And so
[1:18:29] uh let's let's read the scripture here.
[1:18:31] Let's go to Matthew chapter 7. We're
[1:18:33] talking about Jesus authority here. He
[1:18:35] says, "Many will say to me in that day,
[1:18:37] Lord, Lord,
[1:18:39] have we not prophesied in thy name, and
[1:18:43] in thy name have cast out devils, and in
[1:18:46] thy name done many wonderful works?" And
[1:18:48] then will I profess unto them, I never
[1:18:52] knew you,
[1:18:54] my God. Lord have mercy. Many are going
[1:18:59] to say, "Lord, we did this. Lord, we did
[1:19:01] that." But let's go on. I never knew.
[1:19:03] Depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
[1:19:07] Therefore, whosoever heareth these
[1:19:09] sayings of mine, and doeth them.
[1:19:13] In other words, manifest them in your
[1:19:15] life. Live them. Profess them. Join the
[1:19:19] church. Stand behind what you truly
[1:19:22] believe. Get behind the ministry. Stand
[1:19:26] on the word of God. And then allow the
[1:19:28] the supernatural to come and vindicate
[1:19:30] your your your position, your placing,
[1:19:33] your your your profession as a
[1:19:36] Christian. Amen. And doeth them. I will
[1:19:39] liken him unto a wise man which built
[1:19:42] his house upon a revelation.
[1:19:46] Hallelujah. The revelation is the key
[1:19:49] element to taking your position as a son
[1:19:53] or a daughter of God. Because look,
[1:19:56] he goes, "And the rain descended, and
[1:19:59] the floods came, and the winds blew and
[1:20:02] beat upon that house, and it fell not,
[1:20:06] for it was founded upon a rock."
[1:20:10] Hallelujah. If your experience is not
[1:20:13] founded upon a rock of revelation of who
[1:20:16] you are in this day and in this hour,
[1:20:18] I'm telling you, the winds are blowing,
[1:20:21] the storms are coming, the rains have
[1:20:23] been descending, the floods are coming,
[1:20:26] saints. There's a flood of wickedness
[1:20:28] and evil and and and there's a there's a
[1:20:31] there's a a a dimension which is now
[1:20:34] which is which is pressing into this
[1:20:36] dimension right now of war and
[1:20:39] pestilence and and and putting fear upon
[1:20:43] the people, putting them into a state
[1:20:45] where they don't know what to do. The
[1:20:48] world is going into war. It's going into
[1:20:50] chaos. People don't know what they are.
[1:20:53] young people. There's more young people
[1:20:55] in depression than has ever been in the
[1:20:58] history of North America right now.
[1:21:01] There's more suicide, teen suicide. They
[1:21:04] don't know what to do. They don't know
[1:21:06] how to identify themselves. They don't
[1:21:08] know their existence.
[1:21:11] They don't understand their existence.
[1:21:13] And it puts them into a condition where
[1:21:15] they they don't know how to live, what
[1:21:18] to do, where to go. I'm going to go talk
[1:21:20] to the psychiatrist. I'm going to talk
[1:21:22] to this one. I'm gonna talk to that one.
[1:21:24] It's just a vicious circle of demon
[1:21:26] power telling them, "Okay, that's okay
[1:21:29] for you to do." Okay, well, maybe
[1:21:31] that'll work, too. 300 bucks an hour.
[1:21:34] Hallelujah. Next. Okay, time's up. Got
[1:21:38] my next appointment. We'll see you next
[1:21:40] week.
[1:21:42] You want therapy? Come into the house of
[1:21:44] the Lord.
[1:21:46] You'll get therapy here. If you
[1:21:47] surrender to God and you believe God's
[1:21:50] word that he's a reality, he will.
[1:21:52] There's no psychiatrist that even comes
[1:21:54] close. He just says, "Leave."
[1:21:59] Sickness, leave that body. Sickness,
[1:22:02] loose my body. I know who I am. I am a
[1:22:05] temple of the living God. I have supreme
[1:22:08] authority over this temple because God
[1:22:10] has given it to me. You sickness, you
[1:22:12] got to leave this body. No more you can
[1:22:15] dwell in this place.
[1:22:19] Lord, these are the things that you can
[1:22:21] receive when you believe God.
[1:22:24] Hallelujah. Go to the next slide. We're
[1:22:27] getting to something here, saints. We're
[1:22:28] only just beginning.
[1:22:30] And everyone that heareth these sayings
[1:22:33] of mine and doeth them not shall be
[1:22:36] likened unto a foolish man which built
[1:22:38] his house upon sand.
[1:22:41] Well, I think I'll go and listen to this
[1:22:42] preacher this week. I think I'll listen
[1:22:44] to this one here online. I don't think I
[1:22:47] need a preacher. I don't know if I need
[1:22:48] a pastor. Well, maybe Brother Brandham's
[1:22:50] my pastor. Well, they're on sink and
[1:22:53] sand. They don't know where they're
[1:22:55] going. That every time they put their
[1:22:56] foot in, it sinks. They put it here, it
[1:22:58] sinks. They think they're going to find
[1:23:00] God. Listen, God is in his provided
[1:23:03] place.
[1:23:04] God is in his word until you come to the
[1:23:08] word personal. you and the word
[1:23:11] personal. Not you and and and and the
[1:23:13] teacher, not you and the pastor, not you
[1:23:16] and the deacon, not no personal. Then
[1:23:19] you then you can hear the voice of God
[1:23:21] through the pastor. Then you can hear
[1:23:23] the leadership through the deacon. Then
[1:23:25] you can hear all the things that you
[1:23:26] have need of. Amen. But you got to come
[1:23:28] to the word first.
[1:23:31] Repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:23:35] the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall
[1:23:38] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
[1:23:42] Young people, without the Holy Ghost,
[1:23:45] you're not going to make it. This age
[1:23:48] right now, the the the the the
[1:23:50] oppression and the deception that's
[1:23:51] coming in, glory to God. You want to
[1:23:54] know you got it. You want to know where
[1:23:57] you stand. Amen. Because your test is
[1:23:59] going to come. It's going to come. It's
[1:24:02] not going to get better on this earth.
[1:24:03] Things are not going to get better for
[1:24:05] us, saints. They're going to try to
[1:24:06] close us up. They're going to try to use
[1:24:08] our our church as a storehouse. They're
[1:24:09] going to whatever they want to do.
[1:24:11] That's fine. But we got Jesus Christ the
[1:24:13] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:24:17] Hallelujah.
[1:24:19] He says, "You're building on sand." And
[1:24:21] the rain descended and the floods came
[1:24:23] and the winds blew and beat upon that
[1:24:25] house and it fell. And great was the
[1:24:28] fall of it. Let me tell you, there's
[1:24:30] going to be a lot of people that are
[1:24:32] going to fall in this hour. It's
[1:24:34] happening already all around us, right
[1:24:36] around the ranks of the message. People
[1:24:38] falling away because they have not
[1:24:41] recognized the dispensational change of
[1:24:44] Christ himself by the opening of the
[1:24:47] word, by the opening of those seven
[1:24:49] seals, by the mighty angel putting one
[1:24:51] foot on the land and one on the sea and
[1:24:53] declaring the time shall be no more.
[1:24:55] They have not recognized the season and
[1:24:59] therefore cannot have the overcoming
[1:25:01] victory
[1:25:02] that only comes through a recognition of
[1:25:05] the book being open to you.
[1:25:09] Personal.
[1:25:12] Glory to God. We're going to get into a
[1:25:13] lot. And it came to pass when Jesus had
[1:25:17] ended these things, the people, now
[1:25:19] watch, were astonished at his doctrine.
[1:25:23] Doctrine
[1:25:25] For he taught them as one having
[1:25:28] authority and not as the scribes.
[1:25:33] That's why when they hear us talk about
[1:25:35] the Lord, they say, "Oh my God, you talk
[1:25:39] like, you know, like you got authority.
[1:25:41] You talk like you, you know, you don't
[1:25:43] talk like my priest. My priest says,
[1:25:46] come on in the box over here. You got to
[1:25:47] tell me what you did this week."
[1:25:52] No, no, no, no, no, no. This is this is
[1:25:55] this is the supernatural element that
[1:25:58] when you come into a recognition of who
[1:26:01] you are as a son or a daughter of God,
[1:26:04] you will speak as one with authority
[1:26:06] because not because you speak like that.
[1:26:08] It's because you have it. It's because
[1:26:11] you've recognized. It's because you've
[1:26:14] come to a place where you realize that
[1:26:16] that that that these things that that
[1:26:19] that have had control over my life, they
[1:26:22] shall have them no more.
[1:26:25] Now's the time. Amen. Let's let's move
[1:26:28] on here. He says here in Matthew chapter
[1:26:31] 8, listen. And when he had entered into
[1:26:34] a ship, his disciples followed him, and
[1:26:37] behold, there arose a great tempest in
[1:26:40] the sea. in so much that the ship was
[1:26:43] covered with the waves, but he was
[1:26:45] asleep.
[1:26:47] You know, Jesus is in your ship. You
[1:26:49] know that, eh? If you've truly entered
[1:26:52] in and you've come into that walk with
[1:26:54] God, he's in the ship. But it doesn't
[1:26:57] stop the storms from coming. The storms
[1:27:00] are still going to come. But it's when
[1:27:04] you know, but listen, let's read on. And
[1:27:05] his disciples came to him and woke him,
[1:27:07] saying, "Lord, save us."
[1:27:10] You see, they hadn't really understood
[1:27:14] what who was in the ship. They didn't
[1:27:16] really understand, you know, maybe
[1:27:18] you're not you're not clear yet. Jesus
[1:27:20] is on your side. He's with you. He's in
[1:27:23] you. He wants to possess you. He wants
[1:27:26] to lead you, guide you, direct you. But
[1:27:28] he's given you the free moral agency to
[1:27:31] say, "Yes, Lord. Yes, I recognize who I
[1:27:35] am. Yes, I'm going to take my position
[1:27:37] in the word of God. Amen. But he says,
[1:27:40] "And he saith unto them, why are you
[1:27:42] fearful? Too many people living under
[1:27:45] fear in this message." Too many people
[1:27:48] fearful of, "Oh, this, you know, people
[1:27:52] people are going to think this way about
[1:27:53] me because of this, you know, oh, look
[1:27:55] at my children. My children, I'm ashamed
[1:27:58] of some of my children." Everybody's
[1:28:00] ashamed of some of their children.
[1:28:04] That doesn't that doesn't place you in a
[1:28:07] in a in a lower position in the body of
[1:28:09] Christ. God don't have grandchildren.
[1:28:13] God has sons and daughters. He's
[1:28:16] interested in your attitude, your
[1:28:19] position, your courage, your strength.
[1:28:22] Are you willing to stand on the word?
[1:28:24] He's not interested in dealing with your
[1:28:26] children right now. He's still dealing
[1:28:27] with you. If you're still living in
[1:28:29] fear, he wants you to be completely free
[1:28:33] and set free from the bondage of the
[1:28:35] lies of the enemy. Because the lies
[1:28:37] going to the enemy is going to bombard
[1:28:38] your mind and your thoughts constantly
[1:28:40] telling you this that oh your wife, your
[1:28:43] husband, your your your your you know
[1:28:45] your your friends at work, they can't
[1:28:47] stand you. They're always talking about
[1:28:49] you. They're always this and that. And
[1:28:51] listen, if you've got the wrong attitude
[1:28:54] and you're and you're kind of one of
[1:28:55] these Christians that, you know, likes
[1:28:57] to point out everybody's mistakes,
[1:29:01] you're not welcome here.
[1:29:03] We're not looking for people to point
[1:29:05] out mistakes.
[1:29:07] The Holy Spirit will do that by the
[1:29:09] word. God will correct through the
[1:29:12] deacons. Spirits that need to be
[1:29:14] corrected, God will deal with them.
[1:29:18] You see, like we got to grow up. We got
[1:29:20] to come to a place where we understand
[1:29:22] God is God and God can do whatever he
[1:29:25] needs to do and deal with whatever he
[1:29:27] needs to deal with. And sometimes you
[1:29:29] just got to stay quiet
[1:29:31] and just let the Holy Spirit deal
[1:29:34] because you know they got the Holy
[1:29:35] Ghost. You know that they're just trying
[1:29:37] to overcome a situation. they you know
[1:29:39] that they're just they're that God is
[1:29:41] perfecting something in them and you see
[1:29:44] the progress as the deliverance comes
[1:29:46] and you rejoice because this is a this
[1:29:49] is not a your attribute is perfect
[1:29:53] but this ain't
[1:29:57] and it'll never be. That's why it's got
[1:29:59] to be changed. That's why it's got to be
[1:30:01] translated into another dimension and
[1:30:04] take on a new different celestial body.
[1:30:06] Amen.
[1:30:07] Hallelujah. He says, "Oh, ye of little
[1:30:10] faith." Then he arose and he rebuked the
[1:30:12] winds and the sea and there was a great
[1:30:15] calm. But the men marveled, saying,
[1:30:17] "What manner of man is this that even
[1:30:20] the winds and the sea obey him?"
[1:30:24] I believe he wants us
[1:30:27] to have that calm in our lives. We don't
[1:30:31] need to be yelling and screaming and
[1:30:33] freaking out on situations. Just look at
[1:30:36] the situation and say, "Peace,
[1:30:39] be still."
[1:30:41] Know who you are.
[1:30:44] Know that he's given you that authority.
[1:30:46] Oh yes. Hallelujah. We're going to wind
[1:30:48] it down here. We're just going to let's
[1:30:50] go to the next just another scripture I
[1:30:53] believe and then we'll be done. And
[1:30:55] there was in their synagogue a man with
[1:30:57] an unclean spirit. And he cried out
[1:30:59] saying, "Let us alone. What have we to
[1:31:03] do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth?
[1:31:06] Art thou come to destroy us? I know thee
[1:31:10] who thou art, the Holy One of God. And
[1:31:13] Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy
[1:31:15] peace, and come out of him. And when the
[1:31:19] unclean spirit had torn him and cried
[1:31:22] with a loud voice, he came out of him.
[1:31:26] Listen, you're going to have to overcome
[1:31:28] situations. The enemy is not going to
[1:31:30] give up that easy. Look, it tore him. He
[1:31:33] got mad. He didn't want to leave. He
[1:31:35] didn't want to leave the situation.
[1:31:36] Sometimes you're dealing with situations
[1:31:39] and and and there you know, it just
[1:31:40] seems like a constant battle, constantly
[1:31:43] having to deal with it. But keep your
[1:31:46] keep yourself
[1:31:48] uh you know uh rebuke and correct, but
[1:31:52] sin not. Try try and control. This is
[1:31:55] something that God is really dealing
[1:31:57] with I believe in especially in this
[1:31:59] hour. bringing the sons and daughters of
[1:32:02] God to a place where they where they can
[1:32:04] be be still and know that he is God and
[1:32:08] be calm and deal with the situation. And
[1:32:11] they were all amazed in so much that
[1:32:13] they questioned among themselves saying,
[1:32:15] "What thing is this? What new doctrine
[1:32:18] is this?" This is not a new doctrine,
[1:32:21] saints, this this authority series ain't
[1:32:25] a new doctrine. It's the word of God.
[1:32:28] It's Christ in you. It's Christ in the
[1:32:31] present stage of his ministry, giving
[1:32:33] you the authority to overcome the
[1:32:36] situations that are in your life. Amen.
[1:32:38] Giving you the ability to deal with
[1:32:40] circumstances that go beyond your own
[1:32:43] ability. You can't do it. It's not a new
[1:32:46] doctrine. People are going to be
[1:32:48] astounded at the victories in your life.
[1:32:50] Amen. They're going to see because you
[1:32:52] stood on the word, because you you you
[1:32:54] you just stayed calm and you allowed the
[1:32:57] situations to come, but you dealt with
[1:32:59] them according to the word of God.
[1:33:01] They're going to say, "Wow, what is
[1:33:03] this? I'm a Christian. I go to church.
[1:33:07] He prayed for that person and this and
[1:33:08] and and the person got whole. I pray for
[1:33:12] them a hundred times and they and they
[1:33:13] get worse."
[1:33:16] You see, it's not a new doctrine. It's
[1:33:19] just Jesus Christ in the present stage
[1:33:21] of his ministry.
[1:33:24] And it gives you the ability to
[1:33:25] recognize your
[1:33:28] existence.
[1:33:29] Understand your position
[1:33:32] and why God has given you this
[1:33:36] authority.
[1:33:38] And what thing is this uh doctrine is
[1:33:41] this? For with authority commanded he
[1:33:44] even the unclean spirits and they do
[1:33:48] obey him.
[1:33:52] Let the musicians come.
[1:33:55] What an hour.
[1:33:57] What a time, saints.
[1:34:00] We're living in an hour where victory
[1:34:04] is available
[1:34:06] in your life from today on. Amen. The
[1:34:12] word has been spoken.
[1:34:14] All you got to do is accept it, receive
[1:34:16] it, apply it in your life. Pray, focus,
[1:34:22] stay, stay with the word, get into your
[1:34:25] position. If you heard God speak to you
[1:34:28] today about, you know, something maybe,
[1:34:31] you know, Lord lays going to lay it upon
[1:34:33] your heart to move into a certain office
[1:34:35] or position in the Sunday school or, you
[1:34:37] know, into the cleaning committee or or
[1:34:39] into the yard committee or or into the
[1:34:42] uh, you know, events committee,
[1:34:44] wherever. Just, you know, you just say,
[1:34:45] you know what? I I need I need to get
[1:34:47] into a position. I need I need to get
[1:34:49] blessed. If you really understand what I
[1:34:51] just said, you're going to get blessed.
[1:34:53] You're looking to get blessed. You want
[1:34:55] God to finish the work in you. Listen,
[1:34:57] everything was purposed for himself.
[1:35:01] This is all about his purpose in your
[1:35:04] life. Wherever God, if God has placed
[1:35:06] you in this church, you're going to hear
[1:35:08] the word of God that is going to
[1:35:10] positionally place you. Because I
[1:35:12] believe we're under the Joshua
[1:35:13] Commission. And the Joshua commission,
[1:35:16] brother Mike, it places, it positions,
[1:35:20] it gives authority. It gives ability.
[1:35:24] It gives supernatural ability. Things
[1:35:27] will be done. You'll be able to do
[1:35:29] things that you never thought you could
[1:35:31] do because it's God in you
[1:35:34] moving through your office, moving
[1:35:36] through your position. Lord, I want to I
[1:35:39] I want to be a blessing financially. I
[1:35:41] want to be able to give towards that new
[1:35:43] wall and the church. Lord, I I want to
[1:35:46] be able to do that. Well, get ready. If
[1:35:50] it's on your heart and it's a sincere
[1:35:52] desire, then you watch and see if God
[1:35:54] doesn't open the windows of heaven
[1:35:56] somewhere in your life for blessings to
[1:35:59] come in, a door to open, an opportunity
[1:36:02] to come and financial blessing to come
[1:36:04] your way. And then all of a sudden,
[1:36:06] you're going to realize, glory to God,
[1:36:07] I've tapped into something really good
[1:36:09] here. I can do more than that. I can do
[1:36:12] this. And Lord, Lord, if you want to use
[1:36:14] me in this area, I I I'll, you know,
[1:36:17] just make a way. Open the doors. I'll
[1:36:19] step into it. God wants a willing heart.
[1:36:22] God wants some passion in your walk with
[1:36:25] him. A true desire to serve him in this
[1:36:28] day and in this hour. Praise God,
[1:36:31] saints.
[1:36:33] Let's Let's all stand.
[1:36:38] Let's pray. Father,
[1:36:42] Lord, you know our very hearts and the

[1:45:41] hours, right through the whole thing,
[1:45:44] even on the way to church where things
[1:45:46] just open. I read Proverbs chapter 29
[1:45:48] this morning and it said, you know,
[1:45:51] where there is no vision,
[1:45:53] right?
[1:45:55] People perish. In the amplified it says
[1:45:58] where there's there's no vision it means
[1:46:00] no revelation of God in his word. The
[1:46:03] people people and it said are
[1:46:05] unrestrained.
[1:46:07] It means they can go and do anything.
[1:46:09] That's not our portion friends. We can't
[1:46:12] just go and do anything. Not because I'm
[1:46:14] not going to go do anything but because
[1:46:16] the Holy Spirit dwells here and he's
[1:46:18] bringing us into that place where we are
[1:46:21] prisoners of Christ. I'm glad to be
[1:46:23] here. Are you glad to be in that spot?
[1:46:25] Let's go higher and higher. We'll sing.
[1:46:27] We shall overcome. All right. We have
[1:46:29] overcame. We are overcoming. And we
[1:46:33] shall overcome. Right. Sing it with me.
[1:46:36] We
[1:46:37] shall

[1:46:46] overcome.
[1:46:48] Oh, by the word of our mouth, by the
[1:46:52] blood of the lamb,

[1:47:42] of the lamb.
