holiday gods get us people get them ready what is this quickening power it's good to go to church sure as far as we go but it's not far enough when we got the church that's good but golden to Christ from the church from the message to go unto Christ we must receive this quickly power if we ever expect to be the general resurrection because it's the only thing that will bring us from death to life or death there's the begin of the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you it will also quicken and make bring to light your mortal bodies bring the word to life in your toolbox there's no reason there is not this body that's what it is remember what gospel is what it is is what we have amen they are led by the spirit to quicken the word to those who are believers who are quickened as you come to justification sanctification baptism of illegals then the whole thing goes to sum it up it just keeps keeps [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that's why she's peculiar and the bride of Jesus Christ will be given her a list of people she will be because she's landed in another dimension oh my hallelujah lower the gun amen amen thank you Lord brother I'm talking here we are quickened into a new heavenly language to speak to them a rough truth rupturing up racing up into different atmospheres then what they have ever lived in before there stood seven angels and threw his sword in my hand and said go home and open up those seven seals that are given you say to what does it give it to you Jesus Christ [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] he puts new robots so many people the nominations trying to receive this word of God and then put this new line yeah wanted to give you here there are the true mysteries of marriage the divorce the surface sea and all these things that people fussing about Peter - thus saith the Lord what is it that quickly power coming to the bride may even hurt herself read the word is given to the bride to have authority over sin over light and later all these divisions see some hey see some like that you might never see such a mess you might have a few little odd leads well let me take one thing the other one is going to change

the instructions of the guidance I'm free every single time ignite all right start winding up like this close amen at least I wait how many was doing glory to God I just get excited about just we can be excited with me my brothers and sisters I can tell my delivery I can't help with on me I keep asking to change me the amen amen I thank God for the Holy Spirit in my life you know by this much I get anxious you know nervous and stuff like that and so many times in the past was rushing through the messages and when I come back and I'm crying not the word take a little baby because I feel like messed it all up I just the Holy Spirit is in lower there's the simple things in our lives or just take control of that anxiousness so that you could have things in your life the Holy Spirit to do such a place he wants you to get into something like some blasting this is the body when you experienced encina experience this life and this victory of God they want to give you want to give it to you want if you want it more than you want wants to give it to you brother God had such a hard time dealing with his people they've ever been myself to be same selfish with a pipe all the time [Music] determination that's not determination for your life we're going to see the wanting you to bless you [Music] [Music] everything that you come in contact with the Sun prosperities here [Music] - Mike we're too much [Music] five film industry is just instant the brick no word document what is for the ride on Jesus Christ Johannesburg you hang back now let's bring us out here and we'll just wanting to read down amen just a lot of the authority of God amen I don't might take a little twist a little turn maybe it will stir up your your understanding here how we understand things but what Christ gets inside of the life a matter we see something happens it's different right now Peter here Peter didn't pray for this man the unsold didn't ask God to heal him he said such as I have give I deem this is the maturity differently okay he's not saying here go crazy this is this is he he says all the time for you to speak you see here where you reckon actually work and your situation and the condition [Music] you know [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this 40 comes with that without maturity and she's under that authority amen we don't on the same verse 16 that was faked in the name of Jesus that broke this miracle in her didn't ask he'll defend he believed that the work already had done his part and have placed that power with inside of him sisters if you realize when you speak that word you believe that verb especially commissioned you is that in there you say after this mess stay there it was Peters responsibility to release that power and that's just what he did the Lord never told us to pray for the sick in the sense that we asked him to heal them he told us to heal the sick that's why there's a big difference between the two it has to do with the operation and the authority that he has already given us as when the bride is one of the word and the spirit of god is her revelation of what to do with the word the spirit moves like it did on Peter Peters heart and he took that authority and spoke the word of Jesus you see a lot of we have to rise to another level my brothers and sisters this denominational way of thinking is this immaturity us at least it has to be possible God's Persian inductance amen and don't be worried when people were out you Amen God and Alexis that shirt all that father's give me won't come you just keep going my brothers and sisters if my brother both hinder me my sister Koval no one had everything all I was coming to about two times coming to the police and I my brothers and sisters the dog is politic I know but the dog
