[3:48] nice solid weight for the baby healthy
[3:52] that's really good
[3:55] praise God now at the school could read
[3:59] the scriptures marci of the Lord is from
[4:04] everlasting to everlasting upon them
[4:07] that fear him his righteousness unto
[4:11] children's children so to such as keep
[4:15] his covenant and those that remember his
[4:20] Commandments to them thus saith the Lord
[4:26] suffer the little children to come unto
[4:28] me and forbid them not for of such is

[5:08] we acknowledge your duty to bring up
[5:13] this child in the fear and in the
[5:17] admonition of the Lord
[5:20] so that later of their own free choice
[5:26] later confessed their faith in the Lord
[5:31] Jesus Christ and even accept him as
[5:36] their personal Savior
[5:43] now you united yourself in this church
[5:47] your family united yourself of this
[5:50] church unless unite ourselves together
[5:54] to support this young couple so that
[5:59] this child through salvation baptism and

[6:45] be able to explain to the child what
[6:47] happened when were born and you were
[6:51] dedicated at good neighbor ministries
[6:54] here and now they have responsibility as
[7:00] time to be discharged by the parents

[13:25] [Music]
[13:35] [Music]

[13:52] [Music]
[13:59] [Music]
[14:15] [Music]
[14:52] [Music]
[15:04] once again everyone in the house the
[15:11] Lord we want to touch on the topic last
[15:15] week and just the second part of it this
[15:18] make some remarks somewhat interested it
[15:23] will be a blessing to you ox and deer
[15:26] legs Brisco now we know
[15:31] Spectras Jesus clearly said I go to
[15:33] prepare a place for you that we nearby

[15:42] love tunes in my father's house there

[16:08] praise the Lord Amen now I would like
[16:14] for you to give those lights and start
[16:19] delusion
[16:28] [Music]
[18:14] raised up you wonder why the link back
[18:18] in church
[18:19] [Music]
[18:59] you may wonder why we have used this to
[19:05] introduce this this topic here today
[19:09] because my subject is air comes the
[19:12] bride here comes the bride now it's
[19:17] alright birth weddings marriages to take
[19:22] place but it's very very important for
[19:26] us to recognize it's not just a matter
[19:29] of the brain is a very important person
[19:35] even in a wedding in most most of the
[19:38] time system woman in that wedding that
[19:41] ends up actually be the most important
[19:44] person that's there and that's because
[19:47] in the winning is based a great deal on
[19:50] our character our nature and all that
[19:55] type of thinking and because of that is
[19:59] very important to be pay attention to
[20:02] that of course in speaking of the brain
[20:04] you know that of woman is a symbol of
[20:08] the Church of God just like the moon is
[20:14] a super also of woman and the Sun is the
[20:19] symbol of a man right and so we find
[20:24] that it's important for us to pay
[20:26] attention because of these last days and
[20:29] through similar changes God has been
[20:32] taking a portion of people out of every
[20:36] age now history as the shredded ID was
[20:43] the vital in the seven different ages of
[20:47] time and abides in the book of
[20:51] Revelation Jesus speaks of seven
[20:54] messengers seven angels that he was
[20:57] sending to the earth the minister to the
[21:01] people in these seven churches or seven
[21:06] ages of the church was the first one and
[21:16] so on for the gears now we believe
[21:19] brother William and Brenda is the last
[21:24] of those messengers of the seven church
[21:27] age and God used him to the point it
[21:32] would air much of his name because
[21:34] people like what robbers they came out
[21:37] for many but he's doing is influenced by
[21:49] all of the healing of discerning of
[21:53] fearfulness reader from the world were
[21:56] influenced by this man even the Pope of
[21:59] Rome said the very ground you're walking
[22:04] on his blessed just he was not go to
[22:07] Rome about the Pope but the Pope at
[22:10] mystic mountain
[22:11] because the man saw visions and proved
[22:15] that he was a genuine problem for the
[22:18] the Jews received prophets all the
[22:21] prophets in mind over all Jews but he
[22:25] promised at the end time he will send
[22:28] one to the jack
[22:30] [Music]
[22:36] [Music]
[22:38] people with the state but mr. ratio
[22:41] there anytime they witness a reason to
[22:47] the death America strange wonders but
[22:51] not only that prophecies where he
[22:53] prophesied thousands of times and would
[22:56] challenge the world and said anyone who
[22:59] can tell me any time I was ever watched
[23:01] wrong for the sight of it that could
[23:03] lead me down the street called me a
[23:05] false prophet they can't do it they
[23:07] couldn't do it because he was a genuine
[23:10] prophet of God and you promised I'd know
[23:13] that they're in the last things before
[23:16] the from the Lord there would be a break
[23:19] laughs I mean that is some of the
[23:23] movement going to seven stages I'm
[23:25] jumping over a lot D prophesied to come
[23:27] by in classical communism but all those
[23:31] things right on top we spoke of them
[23:33] coming and now in this time you should
[23:36] have great and cruel woman gonna rise
[23:38] and finally end up in the White House
[23:41] and more than that we also said and the
[23:45] public pass that's before to come to the
