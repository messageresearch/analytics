Hallelujah battle hardened been through the fire been through the flood been but all through the blood praise God God bless speaking of which God bless amen God bless you all um I want to start off by saying I'm so happy to see everyone um this 2024 I I should say 2023 2024 has probably been the hardest year and a half of my life um I went through a lot of challenges long story sto long story short uh 2023 I suffered a stroke here at church and that led to a series of different medical conditions that battled my body and for a very long time doctors could not identify what the problem was I I can't tell you how many different diagnoses I was given how many medications I was being treated for illnesses I didn't even have um and by God's grace you know um last May I had an incident where I ended up in the hospital and God introduced me I believe God introduced me to a neurologist that decided to do a series of tests um a full body screening of of everything basically and from there that's when um the doors started opening and answers started to become clear um I started to get definite um diagnosis of what the problem was but I was still under the influence of many many drugs that they were giving me um you know fantinel hydromorph all sorts of things I was literally Frozen um and uh finally uh fast forward to August of this year um I was at home with my parents and I just I couldn't get up I couldn't walk I couldn't move I could barely talk uh I lost all my colors we get to the hospital and the doctors tell us that my elect basically everything that keeps a person alive was almost at zero and had I stayed home that day I could have potentially suffered a cardiac ATR and not be here today um there are so many things that the doctor said to me that I would not be able to do I believe now that I look back I believe that there was a special thing that happened to me a lot of the abilities that were taken away from me during this time are things that make me who I am um my ability to speak clearly process information quickly um it kind of made Me puffed up you know I kind of be became a person that you know started to see myself greater than you know getting promotions at work getting hunt head hunted for opportunities and it really I'm gonna say it made me arrogant and funny enough everything that happened to me took away those abilities um I could barely speak I can barely you know my cognitive skills decreased and I was knocked down a peg two or three or even four and um I kind of realized that it's not me it is a god that is allowing me to be able to do EV everything that I'm able to do achieve all of the things that I'm able to do and the glory belongs to him the total praise belongs to him not to me um and fast forward again to October uh there was a doctor that I also came in contact with at Toronto Western Hospital which is the neurology center for the pro pro uh province of Ontario and he recommended a program for me um there's normally a two-year waiting list for this program um and I got into the program within like a couple of days of being referred um and at that program a lot of things were made clear but the moving thing for me is when I came out of that program the one thing that I struggled with a lot is my faith things would happen such such as memory loss and it just knock me down and be like what what is going on and my faith would constantly waver you know I would go into this phase of wo is me his self-pity you know wake up up in the middle of the night to look at my kids my husband to see I don't know if I'm going to see them tomorrow when I came out of the hospital in October I was put at a crossroad I believe God put me at a crossroad and going left meant that I continued in that wo was me State and going right meant that I put my faith in the Lord and and I trust that whatever his desire for my life is he will fulfill it according to his will and once I did that I called Pastor and I said I feel great I decided that I was going to stop hiding um there are a lot of there are still a lot of things that still happen to me I still suffer from seizures and whatnot but I said I'm going to start coming to church I'm not going to stay home anymore um I spoke to those around me the deacons and whatnot and said you know if this happens no need to call ambulance this is what you need to do to help me um you know recover in that moment and that has allowed me to come back into church and to hear messages God is speaking and I believe that there is something very very special in store for this ministry for this body of people in within under this ministry for me in 2025 and I can't wait I'm looking forward to it and I'm happy I'm strong I am choosing to look forward brother Mike you said this um you said I don't want to go back to where I was or to who I was instead I want to look forward I want to keep moving forward and be led by the Lord so um I'm going to sing this song which is a song that has been with me um and has gotten me through a lot of very dark moments and it talks about giving the praise back to the Lord and um the song is called Total Praise Lord I will [Music] live my eyes to the hills knowing my head [Music] is coming from you your peace you give me in time of the storm you are the S of my strength Lord you are the strength of my life is I lift my hands in Total Praise to you cuz you are the source of my strength you are the strength of my life I live lift my hands in Total Praise to [Music] youen [Music] amen amen amen amen henen [Music] amen

and I I cannot stop asking this question because we are the happiest people in the face of the Earth so many messages I pray and brother Braham said that said we are the happiest people in the face of the Earth and it's real this day is a great day I'm going to read the scripture before I go to the testimony that I have to read um I'm going to read the scripture Isaiah 45 3-6 and I will give Thee the Treasures of the dark of darkness and hidden Riches of secret places that thou mayest know that I the Lord which called thee by my name I am God of Israel for Jacob my my servant sake and Israel my elect we are the elect at this hour so he's talking about us hallelujah I will even call thee by thy name I will by I'm sorry I have S I have S name thee though thou has not known me I am the lord and there is none else there's no God beside me I gather thee though thou Hast not known me that they may know from the rising of the Sun and from the west and there is none beside me I am the lord and there is none us hallelujah let us go to another scripture John 10 27-30 my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man plug them out of my hand my Father which have given them me is greater than all and no man is able to plug them out of my father's hand may the Lord add his Blessing to this word and that's a a scripture for you and me I am brother Desmond opoku I think everybody knows me even without this mic my voice is sharper than sword Hallelujah I was born in Africa a country called Ghana in the village in the village called an at kumu uh kumu area that's Ashante region I have I have low education I'm not learned like other people but I thank God God gave me a sharp mind Hallelujah I was smart in school but my father and my mother was was farmer there is no money for me to continue to the schooling I was good in the school I just finished grade seven Hallelujah I began to live and pursu my own life here and there in 1981 I traveled to Nigeria that's my journey of my life that I'm standing here today at the age of 25 from there to Egypt Egypt to Israel something happened to me when I arrived in Israel airport I took a taxi to Jerusalem I ran 1 p.m. when I arve in Jerusalem I try to find a sh a hotel to live around 1:00 there's nobody in the town and

March I went to uh my wife and I decided to take a trip and we went down to Arizona and it was probably the the mo the best trip I've ever been on anyway and not just because of my wife which was lovely and everything like that but the Lord just did so much there that it just uh kind of was amazing to me what he did there there were people there that we had to meet that we had to talk to that had to uh hear about this Revelation that we know all right and it was really a supernatural trip but on that trip um I started to feel like there was a headache a headache was was just in the background and we were doing a lot of Drive-In and I thought oh I don't know what that is this headache but then the next day the headache was there and the next day the headache was there and then it started growing a little bit we flew home God moving like crazy down there it was just incredible what he was doing I've never seen he's never used us like that before and and it was really something and yet this headache was there and and I got home and uh over the next month all the headache did was get worse but it would it would be fine in the morning but by the time the evening came oh I had just a pain I would if I did anything if I uh bent over to tie my shoes or if I exerted myself trouble if if I sneezed big trouble if I coughed even worse and this went on from from last March and it continued to go on and on and on and I thought oh boy I better go see a doctor so I went seeing a doctor he couldn't find anything wrong and uh anyway so it went on like that and and I was praying Lord you got to heal me I remember I went in with the Deacon's office remember Brothers we went in and I said hey pray for me and the brothers laid their hands on me and anointed me with oil and uh after that it it was a month or two after that still the headaches were there and um but I just said I'm I beli in God and God spoke to me in in in the uh I know I'm going to take up some time brother Danny but or pastor but anyway I'm going to do it because they sang that song God spoke to me one one service and he says yeah you get headaches and and and this is before any he knew anything he say you get headaches well you're going to have to depend on God for this one and I said all right I'm going to depend on God so anyway about a month ago I went and uh as at work and I I pulled a muscle in my back higher higher back this thing was was I know people have had back problems here and everything like that and uh I can relate to you uh but it wasn't lower back or anything it was just one muscle high in my back I went home one Sunday after church and whatnot at night I went to bed and and uh I lied down and I had to get up and my wife had to help took me took me 10 minutes to to help me out of the bed like that the pain was so bad in my back and I said oh boy she said hey why don't you take a muscle uh relaxer if was you know like that and I said well you got one she goes yeah so so she gave me a muscle relaxer I took it I was able to sleep that night I got up the next morning I went to work and I took another one you know just because while I was at work um just trying to stretch it out and make it feel better and uh then after two days I realized I haven't had a headache and I thought this is the first time I've every day that thing was coming it was headache it was terrible and I didn't have a headache and then my my back was feeling better so I stopped taking the mus muscle relax relaxer I didn't take anymore I'm not one for pills anyway I if I take a if you

whatever I want to do I am better than I was before the headache and you see God you know what did God do all I know is he answered my prayer it took him right up to that was in October so it took him whatever Seven 8 nine months but he passed me through it and I said Lord I'm trusted in you however you want to do it I don't know what the muscle relaxer did I have no idea all I know is that I can

year that uh sister Jennifer and I have been placed into this position as the pastor and uh pastor wife and um it's been a a very wonderful year in that uh you know drawing close to the Lord and and feeding off of him and seeking him for for the word so that you can be fed I take it very seriously it's something that um that is not easy but I Rely completely upon him and and I rely upon your prayers and your support and it has truly been uh the backbone and the strength of of my ministry as a minister and a pastor to this church also I want to thank God for my wife and you know if there's anything you want to do nice for me do it for her pray for my children and be nice to my wife amen praise God you know she's been a a a strong and mighty support uh standing next to me at these um you know at this time in our lives it's been a great challenge we've had to endure many many attacks of the enemy but we knew we were told that you know uh that this is you know a leader when he goes and takes the place you know he's the shepherd the enemy is going to try to strike he's going to do everything in his power to strike the shepherd so that the Sheep will scatter it's as simple as that and I am fully aware of that and um I'm prepared I'm a soldier I'm willing to stand and take the bullets if necessary and that is something that only God can put it into the heart of a of a pastor and a minister it's a it's a calling that only he can prepare and stand behind and vindicate and this I can truly say um I'm grateful for the Lord's support and his standing uh next to me and my wife in this position I want to thank God for the example that our former Pastor John Simon and sister Desiree set and the footprint and the strong uh hold that they placed in their Ministry upon the dedication to the service of the Lord and the example that he placed in front of me and my wife and truly they are pillars they continue to encourage and strengthen us they're still in the background Pastor Simon is still uh very strong amen you know it was the Lord that that that told him that it was time for him to step aside but not because he was getting weaker is because God has a purpose and a plan and we need to submit to that purpose and to that plan we we don't know God's uh perfect plan but we know that he is is working it perfectly amen and so all we can do is continue to surrender and trust him we love and appreciate every one of you we thank you for your support through the whole year um continue to pray I'm just as much under expectation for 2025 as you are but I believe that God started the work he's the author he's the finisher he's not going to Place Us in the front line to lose we already know that he's won the battle amen praise God so God bless each and every one of you as we move now um into 2025 Pastor Simon was in contact with me this afternoon and sends his greetings and wishes each and every one of you God bless you God Prosper you that was their prayer he said says that the Lord will bless and prosper each and every one of us into 2025 amen praise God glory to God and so now we'll go to the word um let's go to uh our slide this evening um we're going

service you'll understand exactly what it is that we're doing let's go to the first scripture amen Luke chapter 9 verse 59-62 and he said unto another follow me but he said Lord suffer me first to go and bury my Father and Jesus saith unto him let the dead bury the dead but go thou and preach the kingdom of God and another also said Lord I will follow thee but let me first go bid them farewell which are at home at my house and Jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God Amen let us pray father we thank you so much tonight Lord as we close this year father we look to enhance and move forward and not to look to the left or to the right but to just look straight ahead father father and and let go of all the things that have held us back and have you know uh been a hindrance in any way shape or form tonight Lord we want this to be a time of of change like never before we will never be the same after tonight we believe it with all of our hearts father that tonight we are going to burn some ships and we are going to enter into new land father where all things are possible to them that believe Lord add your blessing to the word of God tonight Prosper each and every one of us anoint speaker and hearer in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen God bless you Saints you may be seated glory to God burning the ships requires us to be courageous it's going to be something that we need to be courageous and ready to do and th although there are different accounts of a ship Commander doing this the most famous account is that of a Spanish explorer by the name of Hernan Cortez in 1518 Cortez was ordered to explore the interior of Mexico at that minute at the last minute Val Vasquez who was Diego Velasquez he was a uh Conquistador and the first governor of Cuba and in uh 1511 he led the successful conquest and colonization of Cuba so he was the governor that was giving instruction and at the last minute he told hernand Cortez not to go through however he went through they land landed in Mexico in 1519 worried that his crew might desert him and go back to Spain Cortez wrecked his ships and left the men no choice but to follow him he wanted them to realize there was no opportunity to retreat they had to give their fight everything they had failure was not an option we win or we perish they won two years later Cortez succeeded in the conquest of the Aztec empire the concept of burning ships goes back further in history than that it was Napoleon Hill that wrote a long while ago a great warrior faced a situation which made it necessary for him to make a a decision which ensured his success on the battlefield he was about to send his armies against a powerful foe whose men outnumbered his own he loaded his shoulders his soldiers onto the boat sailed to the enemy's country unloaded the soldiers and the equipment then gave the order to burn the ships that had carried them addressing his men before the first battle he said you see the boats going up in smoke he says that means that we cannot leave these Shores unless we win that's the only way that we will leave the shores alive is by winning Jesus Christ is not going to lose the battle he's already won the battle he's already won the battle in your life amen he's already given us a way to escape this world of the battlefield that we deal with each and every day it's a very extreme way of doing things when you say to burn the ships you'd have to be ready to give yourself completely over to the cause and I trust that there's people in here tonight that have decided to follow Jesus and have given completely over to that cause amen can you identify with that amen amen but it takes Extreme Measures to give us the motivation to succeed sometimes unless less than burning the boats won't work you're going to have to let go of certain things that are holding you back that have been keeping you in a in a in a condition from doing all that God wants to do in your life you're going to have to let go of hurts and sorrows and pains and things that that that you you know have have hindered your life over the last year because as sons of God we are living day to day right right yes we're leaving a year behind but tomorrow will be the start of a new year and it'll be a new day and it'll be a new challenge and it'll be new opportunities amen making a commitment like this would show how serious we are at leaving the old behind and embracing the new I want you all to know that tonight we have a great leader in the Lord Jesus Christ amen and so you don't have to worry if he shows you to burn some ships and leave them behind don't worry he's a great leader he will guide you he will direct you he will take you through amen praise God let's go to the the next slide Malachi 3 verse 2:3 or chapter 4: 2-3 he says but who may be able who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appear for he is like a Refiner's Fire and like Fuller soap and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver silver and he shall purify the sons of Levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness I believe that we've got a leader who is a purifier he's a refining fire he can Purge the sin and unbelief in your life regardless of how how hard or how difficult it might appear to you you right now I can assure you he's a refiner he will Purge you he will do everything necessary in order to make you one of his righteous one of his sons one of his daughters that will be those that will bring the word of God deliver the word of God to this last generation that we are living in amen we're going to be looking at Elisha as we read the scripture from First Kings 19: 19- 21 and it talks about Elijah's actions after Elijah commissioned him to be his successor let's look at what happened when Elijah when Elijah passed the torch to Elisha just like in our day we've had an Elijah and that Elijah has gone off the scene amen but there's an Elisha that has that's riding the trail again that has taken the word taking the torch and is willing to do all that is necessary to fulfill the purpose and the plan of God that he's given us in this day and in this hour let's read our next scripture First Kings 19 so he departed then and found Elisha the son of shapat who was plowing with 12 Yol of oxen before for him and he with the 12 and Elijah passed by him and cast his mantle upon him and he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said let me I pray thee kiss my father and my mother and then I will follow thee and he said unto him go back again for what have I done to thee and he returned back from him and took a yoke of oxen and slew them and boiled their flesh with the instruments of The Oxen and gave unto the people and they did eat then he arose and went after Elijah and ministered unto him now I want you to notice here that Elijah placed his mantle upon Elisha and Elisha immediately said to Elijah let me go and deal with whatever it is that I need to deal with he wasn't saying that he that that that he like that that he was going to not take the commission he said I got some things that I need to deal with and I want you to notice what he did he went back and he he took the oxen and the Bible says that he took the instruments to boil the meat in other words he burned all the equipment right that he was using in order to plow his farm in his Fields he was willing to burn everything because he knew that he was never going to go back yes that's right he took all the instruments he placed them into the fire he put the meat into the fire he cooked up a great Feast I can imagine listen the scripture doesn't say exactly what he did you know and what actually happened but I can imagine if we go into our minds we can see Elisha going back to let his parents know that hey I've received a commission I've received one of the greatest commissions that could possibly ever have been placed on my life because I've witnessed the testimony of Elijah and What the Lord Has Done through him and now now the Lord is calling me to do the same but he knew that he had to burn everything and leave everything behind because he was never going to go back amen listen he was not some poor individual he had 12 oxen he had all the equipment he was plowing he probably had a big farm so you know he was leaving behind sometimes it's hard to leave behind our our you know Financial gains and and and the successes of Our Lives when God comes and calls us to burn the ships and now come and serve me amen and so that garment when he placed it upon his shoulders the duties of being a prophet would now be on his shoulders God has given us a commission to take this gospel to take this word word and to and to bring it to a to a a a final end time generation amen and we need to be like Elisha ready to burn whatever needs to be burned and left behind so that we can fulfill that call what if honoring God meant changing jobs making less money would you do it would you be willing to burn that ship because we're going to look at different ships in our lives tonight that need to be burned amen praise God let me say goodbye this wasn't Elijah showing weakness it was respect and responsibility he needed to let his family know what had just taken place and that he was embarking on his new calling Elijah says what have I to do with you in other words I'm not going to hinder you go do what you need to do take care care of what you need to take care of but come back and get ready to go into the service of the Lord God has great things in store for us in 2025 we need to burn the ships that need to be burnt we need to leave behind the things that need to be left behind and we need to move forward so that God can do what he has to do in each and every one of our Lives amen we need to see that he used the meat to feed his family it was a goodbye Feast we're not given the details but we know that there was probably a great feast that had taken place there was maybe a lot of Tears too that had taken place because he had to leave his family behind he had to leave certain aspects of his life behind because God had called him to the greatest calling that could ever come upon his life and the greatest calling that can ever come upon your life life being called to the message of this hour and to stand as a representation of God's word in this day is a very high calling amen glory to God this is a calling to surrender to the lordship of the Lord Jesus Christ amen making him absolutely the Lord and absolute in your lives like we heard tonight amen what shall I Surrender unto Jehovah you heard the song what is it that we need to surrender tonight what shall we surrender tonight what shall we burn out of our lives and be willing to let go of and leave behind completely amen burn the ships if you want to get rid of weeds you don't just pluck them up you need to kill them at the root amen I've got a you know I've got this garden tool that I've never used it's still at home but I got it over the years and it and and what it is it's like a wand that connects to a portable propane tank and then you start it and the fire comes out at the bottom and you can go and you can actually burn the weeds in your grass well God wants you to burn the ships he wants you to go to the root of the things that are holding you back yes and he wants you to burn and kill and destroy the root cause of whatever it is whatever ship that's bringing you back to those to those sinful unbelieving situations in your life God wants you to burn those ships amen not just burn them kill them it has to be completely annihilated hallelujah praise God if you want to get rid of roaches or bed bugs you don't kill most of them you got to eliminate all of them amen and so we don't leave things you know sometimes you get into a a relationship with the wrong friends and then the social media contacts and the phone numbers and and and and then all of a sudden you come to realize and you may realize here tonight young people that there's certain influences in your life that you're going to need to uh burn that ship and when you burn it you don't leave any openings you have to eliminate all contact you got to cut it completely away so that there's no back door so that you can go back well I'll just I'll hold on to their number and then you know no all you're doing is you're you're holding on to that number and allowing the back door to stay open because then they can come in with a message that can lure you back you need to burn every ship and you don't want to just sink the ship and leave it intact so that you can go some sometime and maybe bring it back up no you've got to burn it completely so that it's absolutely no good it can never be used again never to go back again amen praise God let's go to our next slide in Colossians 3: 5 to 10 it says mortify Therefore your members which are upon the Earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil compus science and covetousness which is idolatry for which things sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience in the which you also walked sometime when ye lived in them but now ye have put off all these and look at the things that the scripture talks about here we may not realize that you know we need to burn a ship of anger sometimes anger takes a hold of us and it's and and and and that it gets out of you know out of control we need to be able to control anger by the word of God Amen be angry but sin not the scripture says so now he says put off these things anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth people just use foul language like it's just common these days but not the Sons and Daughters of God they recognize that that the spirit of God is is is beautiful sacred he's holy he's he's he's respectful he's a gentleman and and when we act that way how can you expect the Holy Spirit to be in you or even around you lie not one to another seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him him that created him God has placed a calling on every son and daughter and he wants us to burn the ships of the sinful nature so we can't go back we need to let go of that that that that old nature this is a time where where where change listen this is a body change message but where it changes you first first is in your thinking in your mind in your heart it transforms your nature it starts to bring out of you the nature of Jesus Christ the gentleness of a gentle man the the beauty and and and humility of a of a simple woman amen glory to God we need to focus on where we're going not where we've been some people try to focus on both they've got one foot into the kingdom of God one foot into the world and really you can't go that way you're going to have to make a decision tonight to go one way and that is forward with the Lord amen if you want a fresh start you must let go and burn the baggage of the past am burn the trash you know when somebody's uh you know like uh you know somebody that hoardes and they hoard trash in order for them to throw out that trash they need to know that it is trash they need to see that it's trash and until you can see the things that that that are trash and the things that are not going to improve you and make you what God wants you to be you're going to need to know that it's trash and you're going to need to throw it out you're going to need to burn it in the ship amen praise God glory to God you need to know it before you can burn it you know the saying don't burn your bridges for the most part that's good advice it goes along with don't bite the hand that feeds you you want to make sure you stay in good standing with the good people because you don't know and and you don't want to be alone when you need that friend or help or company God has given you a family family a family of God a local body one that's here to to nourish to edify to correct to give instruction everybody needs a leader and whether you believe it or not you will worship something in this world and in this life amen you're going to either worship Jesus Christ or you're going to worship money or you're going to worship something else you're going to worship something you might as well be on the right track and you might as well Worship the Lord amen glory to God so burning Burning Bridges uh you need to not burn the bridges that give you the support that you need a lot of times we don't really realize that you know we want to get too friendly with the world and disregard the strength and the support that we have in the body of Christ by joining ourselves with those of like Precious Faith amen glory to God a true church family where you can find encouragement a healthy body edifies and nourishes itself and if you're a part of the body you come into the house of the Lord you uh uh dedicate yourself to the ministry you find your position in the ministry you will get edified you will get strengthened you will supernaturally all of a sudden God starts to meet your needs the Lord starts to open doors in your life that you never thought were possible people are looking to you know to to to find success in the world and they keep going over and over and they keep falling they keep failing and they don't want to give the word the opportunity that that it can that it can literally give you a brand new life we need to burn some bridges tonight we need to burn some ships amen we need to burn negative people and influences out of our Lives it's as simple as that if there's Connections in your life people in your life that are drawing you away away from God you need to burn that ship glory to God it's going to take a serious commitment don't be looking to the Flesh in other words people to make things right and give you what you need when you look to God and you allow God to be your provider Jehovah Gyra that provides all of your needs je Jehovah sh who is your peace je Jehovah Rafa the Lord that Health thee Jehovah shama when you make that you're absolute he gives you the friends that you need he gives you the family that you need he'll give you the wife that you need he'll give you the husband that you need but you need to trust him all the way you need to burn the ships to those gting apps amen you need to burn the ships to those bar revivals yes or rock concerts or whatever they are rap concerts or you know you need to burn those bridges because they're taking you further away but if you dedicate yourself you you try your you try the Lord and you say Lord I'm going to give you all of me in 2025 yes sir give him the opportunity and let's see if he doesn't honor his word in your life don't be looking for it to happen the very next day have patience you've come this far you've done so much you've gone so far from God and you've you've wandered for so many years and now you want to come back I believe he can do it very quickly and he'll do it a lot quicker than you think but you got to give it a chance glory to God let's look at the next scripture Romans chapter 8: 13 and 14 he says here if we live after the flesh you shall die in other words if you're if if if if you're just relying on people you're living after the flesh you're you're relying on your on your lusts everything you you know you lust after this you lust after that you're you're looking for your material gain and and it's all in this realm you're going to die the scripture says it very clearly but if if ye through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body you're going to live you got to bring your your yourself your body your mind your spirit fully under subjection to the Lord and his will what his desire is for your life amen for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God when you start to surrender to the Lord Lord and you burn the ships of all those things that you know are keeping you from being what God wants you to be you start to get stronger you start to hear his voice you start to recognize that when he speaks to you through the preaching of the word he starts to discern the situations in your life he starts to uh give you instruction on on how to get set free from this you start to be led by the spirit am that shows that you are truly in representation with the Lord Jesus that you have representation with him that you are a son or a daughter of God amen amen in Philippians CH 3: 13-4 it says here Brethren I count count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before are you ready to do that are you ready to make that transition into 2024 where you're willing to leave everything behind and to press toward the mark for the prize for which God through Christ Jesus amen amen the prize towards the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God Amen in the Lord Jesus Christ there is a standard there is a better way to live and you can trust him tonight amen praise God once you've done this and you've done all that you can you burn the ships then what do you do you wait on the Lord that's what you do let's read the next slide brother Braham speaking here he says now Lord nothing in my arms I bring simply to thy cross sorry the scripture says they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as an eagle they shall run and not be weary walk and not faint as the song says teach me Lord oh teach me Lord how to wait get my soul washed in the blood of Calvary meet every requirement burn all the bridges around and say now Lord nothing in my arms I bring simply to the cross I cling you promised it Lord that's the kind of condition the reason people think that I'm an isolationist but in the room or over on the side of the desert that's the condition you've got to get into before you walk into this Pulpit here brother BR talking about his experience of burning every ship burning everything not allowing any to to to hinder him when he comes to bring the word well we can apply that in our lives don't let anything get in your way so that you can live and Manifest this word in this day and in this hour amen and you might be right Holding On To The Cross not trusting your own ability your own thoughts just leaning on the Everlasting Arms claiming no intelligence claiming no mind of your own you're just opening yourself and let let the Holy Spirit speak that's the condition God wants his church in he says get into that condition he wants us to completely surrender yield ourselves gives our give ourselves completely over to the Lord burn every ship of any uh Avenue that that's holding us back amen praise God tonight as we now uh enter into the next aspect of the service we're going to be looking at what ships we need to burn I want you to take the time as we've been ministering to you here tonight we looked at certain scriptures it's just a simple thought I don't have a great long message deep message I believe we just need to recognize what the Lord is saying to us here he's saying I'm moving on I want you to recognize that I'm moving on he says and if you want to move on and move on to this new land that I'm taking you into you need to burn certain ships in your life you need to let go of certain aspects you need to let go of certain uh experiences certain uh you know uh bad relationship issues anger issues I don't know let let the Lord Purge your mind and your heart heart to find those things that are holding you back from becoming what you're supposed to be maybe pride is you know your Pride's been bruised and and and and you're just not you just like you're you're angry and you're not willing to to serve the Lord the way that you should be serving the lord you may have been serving the lord for five years 10 years uh five days 30 years but you know you can get into a bad condition you know that you can allow certain experiences because of the flesh because of your your your your you're you're looking at at at the pride of life and allowing it to take control of you and and and and move you in a direction that is away from God God wants you to burn that ship let go of that past experience let go don't try to figure everything out don't try to understand everything God wants you to just simply believe his word and move forward with him amen listen we're not burning sin out of our Lives Jesus took our sins already so don't be looking to try to to to to to burn the sin we're burning the ships that lead us to that sin that's what we need to do we need to burn the wrong attitudes our attitudes are ships that need to be burned if they're a negative attitude yes if you're having problems in in communication with with um you know relationship issues you need to examine your ego is it your ego that's speaking every time you get into a confrontation or is it a sincere desire to see both of you set free a good deal is when it benefits both sides I've never seen a deal that's that that that's a great deal when it only benefits one side it needs to benefit both and so sometimes it's our attitude it's our it's our inability to not forgive you got a spirit of unforgiveness on you if so that bridge and that boat needs to be that ship needs to be burned completely because if you're not willing to forgive how you going expect God to forgive you you're holding on to unforgiveness it's a spirit you don't realize a spirit of unforgiveness is is hindering you from moving forward and it's and it's keeping you under a spirit of condemnation at the same time you don't realize that you need to burn that bridge if that's one of the bridges then write it down on the paper unforgiveness anger anxiety amen praise God Jesus washed all of our sins when he took it to the cross our sins are Washed by the blood amen and he is a consuming fire that can consume and refine you like silver and gold to where there will be no more he says I'll have a I'll have a church without spot or wrinkle amen I believe that you believe it amen praise God so we're going to take a few moments now and we're going to look at all these things if it's Envy malice whatever it is I want you to take the time to take those pieces of paper that are in front of you you can use one two three whatever is available there it's fine there's one or two items write it down two three four whatever it is whatever you want to to say hey I I've had enough I do not want this in my life anymore and if you're sincere and you're honest this ceremony tonight we're going to burn some ships we're going to leave them behind I've got mine written right here and they're going to get burnt tonight and I don't want to ever see them again I'm trusting the Lord that he's going to take it away burn it out of my life because I'm going to surrender to him amen glory to God we're burning these statements as a symbol that we no longer have ships to take us back to them don't want him anymore don't need him anymore amen praise God we've crossed over into the promised land of God's word and we're pressing towards the mark of the prize which is the high calling of Jesus Christ this is what we will focus on 2024 was a great year like brother Mike said great challenges but what makes it a great year is that you've overcome and that you're still here that's what makes it great that you're still standing that you're still believing that you're still pressing on towards the mark of the High Calling amen praise God I believe it let the brothers prepare for the Lord's Supper so what we're going to do is you now have an opportunity to write down these ships that are going to be burned and then the brothers are going to call Aisle one aisle at a time you can start on the right side and then go to the left and what's going to happen is he will call you individually you will come up sorry you will you will go from that side you're going to go from that side and you will come up and you'll come by the burning pan where you will be able to burn the ships throw them into the pan and then from there you will continue and you will receive the bread and you will receive the wine and then you will go back to your seat with the bread and the wine until everybody actually know you'll take the bread you'll take the wine I'm going to read the scripture before we do it and then as you come through and you burn you'll take your bread you'll you'll eat your bread and you'll drink your wine when you go back to your seat okay is everybody clear on that we're not going to do it all together we're going to let you so he's going to start on this side start from the very back and start the people coming and then finish this side here and then start from the back and then finish that side and everybody will come through and receive the bread and the wine at this time I'm going to read from 1 Corinthians chap 11: 23 to 29 he says here for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me brother Christopher brother Phillip who's going to pray please pray over the the bread bodies those that are sick amen after the same manner also he took the cup when he had SED saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he come brother Chris our gracious most loving heavenly father just thank you for this time of communion Lord where we can come together as a family Lord Lord and partake Lord of this which has instructed us to do Lord father Lord this wine which represents your blood that was shed for us Lord pray dear God as we partake of it Lord if there be any sickness any thing Lord that is hindering us Lord father oh God I pray God that you break all shackles Lord let the stimulation

Jesus name we pray amen amen praise God wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body and so as we now enter into taking the Lord's Supper and we bring these slips of paper let's examine ourselves as we're walking as we're pondering as we're thinking on the Lord and as we partake of this bread and of this wine and let this walk be a new start a new walk with the Lord a fresh start you know that that's something that that is so miraculous it's it's the one thing that I realized when I came to the Lord that you know I I never thought it could be possible to have a real true fresh start but this is the only place that you will ever ever be able to have a sincere true Fresh Start is with the Lord amen because he says I've taken your sins to the Cross you are Justified as though you never done it in the first place that's how great our God is that's a fresh start Saints whatever you're holding
