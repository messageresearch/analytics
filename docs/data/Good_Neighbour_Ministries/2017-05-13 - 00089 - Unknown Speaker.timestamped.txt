[0:11] You have to do this all the time. So I'd
[0:12] rather heard you.
[0:15] It's good to be home each and every one
[0:18] of you. And I just love the Lord and all
[0:21] of you.
[0:22] I'm just so blessed. I, you know, just
[0:25] sitting there and looking upon each one
[0:27] of you and the rising up and everything.
[0:30] And I'm just sitting back there because
[0:32] I know the background of a lot of people
[0:33] here and the trials and things they've
[0:35] been through and just see the Holy Ghost
[0:38] rising up
[0:42] to it's just wonderful as Pastor Simon
[0:45] always said something big something big
[0:49] and we'll do something even much bigger
[0:51] and I'm just so blessed to be a part of
[0:54] it part of
[0:57] [Applause]
[1:05] She wanted me to lose the chain off her
[1:06] foot so she could go back down.
[1:10] Um, it's it's such a blessing. It's such
[1:13] a blessing to be back just to see all
[1:15] your faces and just having a wonderful
[1:17] time in the presence of the Lord and
[1:19] just the fellowship we've had with so
[1:20] many saints last day and a half or
[1:22] something like that. Just love you all.
[1:24] you're always in our hearts and um just
[1:26] keep praying for us. There's a little
[1:28] work going on in Connecticut and it's
[1:29] only a little for a little time because
[1:31] God is moving. Amen. When he moves, we
[1:34] want to move with him.
[1:36] Just like to say just what's on our
[1:38] hearts. Um you can see a manifestation
[1:41] of the word in our lives. The
[1:43] expectation of eternity. I always find
[1:45] myself looking more for here. I know
[1:46] Pastor Simon always talk about emptying
[1:48] out here, emptying out having nothing
[1:49] that attaches you to this world.
[1:52] and my thoughts and my desires are for
[1:55] my heavenly home more about that. I
[1:58] don't want anything here because this is
[1:59] temporal. Just thinking about him and
[2:02] meditating on him and seeing every day
[2:04] in our lives moving in the Holy Ghost
[2:06] and you know and I don't have to tell
[2:07] anybody. There's certain things God
[2:08] wants to tell us to tell others but it's
[2:11] worship between Amen. and just growing
[2:14] by his grace and his confidence in the
[2:16] word that he's placed for me and keep on
[2:20] keep on being a light in this area and
[2:23] God bless you. Support the ministry to
[2:26] hold up servant of God's
[2:28] God bless you.
[2:31] [Applause]
[2:36] Want to thank God for them. Just give a
[2:38] greetings to Ruth and Josh and the rest
[2:41] of them. Of course, you know, brother
[2:42] Tom and sister Sharon worship with
[2:45] brother Gibs that was here. How many
[2:47] remember brother Gibbs like
[2:51] praise the Lord? Take the greetings back
[2:53] to our dear precious brethren. We pray
[2:55] that God will continue to help and
[2:57] strengthen him in every way. Praise the
[2:59] Lord. Uh is that Sister Esther?
[3:03] Yeah. Praise the Lord, sister. I thought
[3:06] it was one of the daughters, but
[3:08] [Applause]
[3:16] praise God. It changes a woman when they
[3:18] hear all
[3:20] everything else makes a big difference.
[3:23] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. So happy to
[3:26] be in the house of the Lord. Good to see
[3:27] you, sister. Amen. All of you here in
[3:30] the house of the Lord on Easter morning.
[3:33] Praise God. We are going to read our
[3:36] scripture um of 1 Corinthians 15:12-23.
[3:43] And we're going to read that with joy in
[3:45] our hearts. Let me see.
[3:48] Bless you. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[3:53] We're talking about the resurrection.
[3:58] First Corinthians.
[4:00] Now, if Christ be preached that he rose
[4:04] from the dead, also say some of you
[4:07] among you that there is no resurrection
[4:10] from the of the dead. But if there be no
[4:13] resurrection of the dead, then Christ is
[4:16] not risen. Is Christ not risen? And if
[4:19] Christ be not risen, then is our
[4:21] preaching and our faith also is also
[4:25] vain. Yay. And we have found false
[4:28] witnesses of God because we have
[4:31] testified of God that he raised up
[4:34] Christ from raised up Christ whom he
[4:36] raised he raised not of. If so be that
[4:40] the dead rise not. If the dead rise not,
[4:44] then is not Christ raised. But if Christ
[4:47] be not raised, your faith is in
[4:50] disadvant. You are yet in your sins.
[4:53] Then they also which are fallen asleep
[4:56] in Christ are perished. If in this life
[5:00] only we have hope in Christ, we are of
[5:03] all men most miserable.
[5:06] But now is Christ risen from the dead
[5:09] and become the first fruits of them. For
[5:12] since by faith came death, by man came
[5:16] death, by man came also the resurrection
[5:20] of the dead. As in Adam all die, even so
[5:23] in Christ shall all be made alive, but
[5:26] every man in his own order. Christ the
[5:30] first fruits afterward they that are
[5:33] Christ at his coming. Praise the Lord.
[5:36] May the Lord bless uh the word to our
[5:39] hearts and lives today. Father, we thank
[5:42] you for the reading of the word out of
[5:44] the holy book and we ask your blessing
[5:47] upon it now. We pray you'll quicken our
[5:50] hearts to receive the word on this
[5:52] Easter day in Jesus name. Amen. Please
[5:56] be seated.
[6:00] Now there was a great writer many years
[6:02] ago uh and his name was Ernest F and uh
[6:09] he made the remark history is just news
[6:14] from the graveyard.
[6:17] History is just news from the graveyard.
[6:20] it. But it never occurred to him uh that
[6:24] he was giving a remarkable description
[6:28] of Easter and what the break Easter
[6:31] really is. He was totally unconscious of
[6:34] what he was saying. But this is what
[6:37] Easter is all about. It's right there.
[6:40] Good news from the graveyard.
[6:42] Generally, you don't have good news
[6:44] coming out of a graveyard. Usually, it's
[6:47] grief. It's sorrow. It's death. It's
[6:49] crying. is weeping and as people with
[6:52] heartbreak and everything but this is
[6:55] Christianity genuine Christianity
[6:58] actually we are a people that have
[6:59] gotten good news from the graveyard.
[7:03] Amen. Now, I went to Israel and I went
[7:05] to the uh the property of Joseph of
[7:09] Arythea and saw the grave that was
[7:13] carved is still carved out in the
[7:15] mountain side and the crack that was
[7:18] there. They they concreted it up and put
[7:21] a few blocks or whatever there because
[7:23] the rocks broke on Easter morning when
[7:25] the angel descended and the earth shook
[7:27] and Christ came forth. And so, brother,
[7:30] when you go, there is an empty tomb
[7:33] that's there in Joseph of Aramia,
[7:36] vineyard. Amen. So, when you go there,
[7:40] imagine you go to a graveyard to talk
[7:42] about good news. Amen. It's not normal
[7:47] that somebody would go to a graveyard to
[7:49] talk about good news. But here I am to
[7:52] tell you good news from the graveyard.
[7:55] Amen. Praise God forever more.
[7:57] Hallelujah. Amen. It's news. Amen.
[8:01] Because the graveyard is a place of
[8:03] defeat, a place of death. It's a symbol
[8:07] of the departed. Amen. But praise God,
[8:11] we have glorious news. This Easter that
[8:14] we have is not an argument. Amen. It's
[8:17] an announcement. Amen. And I'm
[8:19] announcing to you, he's risen from the
[8:22] dead. He's alive for the praise God.
[8:26] Death could not hold him, but he rose up
[8:29] from the dead. Amen. Hallelujah. Oh,
[8:32] praise God. We are not here just to talk
[8:35] about it as a saying. It's a shout of
[8:38] victory. I said resurrection. It's a
[8:41] shout of victory. I am the resurrection
[8:45] and the life. He that liveth and
[8:47] believeth on me, though he were dead,
[8:50] yet shall he also live. This is what
[8:53] Easter is all about. And I'm here to
[8:55] bring you the very good news. Amen. Yes,
[8:58] sir. You know, we have heard that on
[9:01] Good Friday and on Good Friday, I preach
[9:03] like that
[9:05] that Calvary
[9:08] and the crucifixion is the foundation of
[9:11] our Christian faith. But then I come on
[9:15] Sunday morning and many preachers do and
[9:17] they preach the resurrection
[9:20] and we turn around and again we say the
[9:23] resurrection is the foundation of the
[9:26] Christian faith. But which is it? Is it
[9:29] the crucifixion or the resurrection? But
[9:32] I'm here to you here to tell you today
[9:35] that both have their places
[9:38] and neither has its own value without
[9:42] being joined to the other one. Because
[9:45] if there was no crucifixion, there could
[9:48] be no resurrection.
[9:50] So they had to go together. And that's
[9:52] the same way even in our lives, unless
[9:55] we get some persecution, we're not going
[9:57] to have any victory. Amen. Unless you
[10:00] have a test, you won't have a testimony.
[10:03] So he had to have crucifixion before
[10:07] resurrection. Praise God. And that's
[10:10] what we are here to celebrate this
[10:12] morning. And it's indispensable to the
[10:15] Christian faith that Jesus rose from the
[10:19] dead. Are you happy this morning? Are
[10:21] you happy this morning that he rose from
[10:23] the dead? Amen. Praise God. I'm so happy
[10:26] that he rose from the dead forever more.
[10:29] Good news from him from the graveyard.
[10:32] He is not here, but he's risen from the
[10:35] dead.
[10:36] He is not in the grave. He's not in the
[10:39] tomb, but he's alive forever more.
[10:41] Praise God. Now, first Corinthians is a
[10:44] resurrection chapter of the New
[10:47] Testament. And Paul asked a question as
[10:50] he begins it and said, "If Christ be not
[10:53] risen," I want you to contemplate just
[10:55] on that that scripture. If Christ was
[10:59] not risen, if the Lord Jesus did not
[11:01] raise from the dead, that means Satan
[11:03] won. That means that uh that God was
[11:07] defeated. And that means brother and
[11:10] sister that uh that there is a place
[11:14] where people have to recognize that then
[11:16] the gospel is not true. If Christ is not
[11:20] risen then what he said about himself is
[11:22] not true. Then his testimony would be
[11:25] right. If the Lord Jesus was not risen
[11:29] then the church or the churches in the
[11:32] world is nothing but a big fraud.
[11:35] Right? That's what it would be if he's
[11:37] not risen. And if he is not risen, we
[11:40] are all participating in a grand scheme
[11:44] of some delusion. Is that right? We'd
[11:47] all be in a state of delusion. And if
[11:51] Christ did not risen, then those whom we
[11:55] believe are now uh in living in paradise
[12:00] or in heaven, praise God, then uh then
[12:03] it's not so. We're deluding ourselves.
[12:06] And if the Lord Jesus was not risen, the
[12:10] questions all human beings have, what is
[12:14] death?
[12:16] Is there life left to death?
[12:19] Do I just die and poof, I disappear?
[12:23] I leap in the dark and I'm no more. None
[12:26] of these questions would be answered.
[12:28] Job had the same question and he wanted
[12:32] it to be answered. Amen. And all of a
[12:34] sudden, the great revelation came to
[12:37] Job. He saw right on down to the rapture
[12:42] and said, "I know that my redeemer
[12:44] liveth and that he will stand upon the
[12:47] earth in the latter day." Amen. I know
[12:50] and know he says in my flesh I will see
[12:55] God. Amen. Why? He brought the
[12:57] revelation that the resurrection was
[13:00] real. Praise God. Hallelujah. Oh, praise
[13:03] God. If Christ be like this, and there
[13:05] is nothing more than this life. And Paul
[13:07] said, then we might as well eat drink
[13:11] and be merry like everybody else and
[13:14] enjoy ourselves because there is nothing
[13:17] else. Is that right? That's all we
[13:19] should do. And then life will become
[13:22] very meaningless and purposeless. And
[13:25] then we would all uh uh this morning
[13:28] they headed to the sea and then how a a
[13:30] giraffe gave birth in the zoo, right?
[13:34] But uh we should laugh at that because
[13:36] without if Christ be not rising
[13:42] around and our lives got no purpose,
[13:45] right? No purpose whatsoever. And we and
[13:48] then this being is just observing us
[13:51] while we running around in this zoo
[13:53] around the world. Right? That's all this
[13:55] would be, right? We all be like that.
[13:58] But praise God forever more. I'm glad
[14:00] that Paul didn't go negative completely.
[14:04] But he said if Christ be not risen. But
[14:07] he said, "But now Christ is risen
[14:09] indeed." I believe now he is risen.
[14:12] That's good news from the great God. I'm
[14:14] glad that I have good news like that to
[14:17] tell you here brother and sister. What a
[14:19] joyful shout that is to say that we are
[14:22] bringing to you good news that you don't
[14:25] have to remain the way you are but you
[14:28] can rise above every dirt that the devil
[14:32] calls you and cover up your life and
[14:35] shame you and slice you or whatever. You
[14:38] can walk out free. That's good news.
[14:42] He is not here. That's good news. Amen.
[14:45] They're trying to cover him up with the
[14:47] stones of doubt. They're trying to cover
[14:50] him up with stones of scornship and
[14:52] theology. They're trying to cover him up
[14:55] with stones of cre and darkness. Praise
[14:58] God. But he has brought the storm away.
[15:00] He has taken the scales from our eyes.
[15:03] And we can say he is not here. But he's
[15:06] missing.
[15:08] [Applause]
[15:14] Hallelujah. That's like a blast of the
[15:16] trumpet. Praise God. He is not here, but
[15:19] he is risen. Brother Bill, he's risen
[15:22] from the dead. Glory to God.
[15:25] Amen. Get that last there if you have
[15:27] that trumpet, brother.
[15:31] Praise God.
[15:35] [Applause]
[15:38] [Music]
[15:40] That's how they did it in Israel. It was
[15:43] a ram's horn like that. And they gave a
[15:46] trumpet blast. Amen. To call the army
[15:49] together to cause the war and to have
[15:52] the victory. And when they got the
[15:54] victory, they gave a blast again for
[15:57] everybody to know we won. We won.
[16:02] [Applause]
[16:08] [Applause]
[16:13] Good news from the graveyard.
[16:15] Hallelujah. Amen. Good news that the
[16:18] foundations of hell is shaken tonight.
[16:21] Glory to God. Did the Bible say he
[16:24] descended into hell? Well, what do you
[16:26] think happened? Satan begin to tremble.
[16:28] He thought he had complete control.
[16:30] Brother Brandon dramatizing how the Lord
[16:33] Jesus descended into hell. Amen. And
[16:36] just grabbed the keys from the warden of
[16:39] hell off that Satan had on his waist. He
[16:41] just grab rip him off. Amen. Hallelujah.
[16:44] And he says, "Now I have the keys of
[16:49] hallelujah." Amen. Brother, the prophet
[16:53] Christ, he went to the cells with the
[16:56] keys. Amen.
[16:59] Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait,
[17:00] wait a minute. Uh, you you're the one
[17:02] that I saw under the the the tree there
[17:05] that I got sharing the fish. Praise God.
[17:08] Your name is here. Praise God. And I saw
[17:11] you again. You came back.
[17:15] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[17:18] [Applause]
[17:20] Then he got down. Ezekiel said, "Wait,
[17:22] wait. That's the wheel in the middle of
[17:25] the wheel.
[17:27] It's a wheel in the middle of the wheel.
[17:29] And Daniel shout, he said, "I support
[17:32] the fourth man in the fire.
[17:36] Hallelujah.
[17:39] When you're going through your trials,
[17:41] hallelujah, the trials of the cup will
[17:43] make you strong because after the trials
[17:46] you saw Jesus,
[17:48] he's your
[17:52] father.
[17:54] He was your savior. Father, he was a
[17:56] redeemer, wonderful counselor, mighty
[17:59] God, everlasting father. You saw him.
[18:02] Good news from the great God. He is not
[18:05] dead, but he's risen from the grave.
[18:08] Hallelujah. He's risen. Amen. Praise
[18:11] God. I want you to know, friends, that
[18:15] the sun is up.
[18:17] [Music]
[18:18] We don't have to live in darkness
[18:20] anymore,
[18:21] but we can walk in the light. Oh, praise
[18:25] God. Aren't you glad the sun is up?
[18:28] Listen to the prophet of God in the juke
[18:30] of the year. He said, "Now, as soon as
[18:34] that trumpet sounded on that morning,
[18:38] they could throw their hoes down and
[18:40] said, I ain't going no more." And the
[18:43] taskmaster, whoever he was, was
[18:46] forbidden to touch them anymore. Cause
[18:49] from that moment they were free.
[18:53] The moment they heard that good news,
[18:56] their jubilee was on. Have you heard the
[18:58] good news? I said, have you heard the
[19:00] good news that the jubilee is on? They
[19:03] were free. And who the son of man set
[19:06] free is free indeed.
[19:09] [Applause]
[19:12] Hallelujah. Their atonement was made and
[19:15] all the slaves could go free. Don't you
[19:18] know that's what it is? God sent Christ
[19:21] to open up the prison doors of men who
[19:24] were sitting in darkness. There he was
[19:27] sitting in darkness, but the sun is up.
[19:30] Praise God. And you are here to go free
[19:34] by the grace of God. He said, say for
[19:36] instance,
[19:38] you were sentenced to death and you were
[19:41] sitting in a prison. And let me tell
[19:42] you, this world is a prison. I think
[19:45] it's ready to be getting ready now for
[19:47] jail break.
[19:49] Is that right? Because here we are.
[19:52] We've been living whether you were
[19:54] living 10 years, 20 years, 15 years, 20
[19:56] years or 70 years or 100 years, you were
[20:00] just doing time.
[20:02] Is that right? That's what we're doing
[20:04] right now. We're doing time, right?
[20:06] We're doing time. But praise God, he
[20:08] promised that as long as you will
[20:10] receive him within your heart, there's
[20:13] going to be a jailbreak.
[20:18] But here I am. So we going to break out
[20:21] of this and break into the eternal.
[20:27] Hallelujah. Praise be to God. Amen. Yes,
[20:31] sir. How wonderful to know. Oh yes, sir.
[20:34] You were sitting in a prison knowing
[20:36] that the sunrise
[20:38] will will come up tomorrow, but you had
[20:41] to die. See, and there were many people
[20:45] sitting right here this morning. Some
[20:49] sitting with cancer in their bodies,
[20:53] some with a tumor. While I'm talking,
[20:56] you think about it because there's so
[20:58] many people being delivered and healed
[21:01] that they got an illness and as soon as
[21:03] they turn around the tape or the CD,
[21:06] brother speaking about the same thing
[21:08] and said you lady witness so and so he's
[21:11] he's already gone but guess he's
[21:12] discerning and speak the Holy Spirit is
[21:15] speaking the word and said that thing
[21:17] leaves you now in Jesus name you're
[21:19] healed and the people would be delivered
[21:22] and healed all over the world by the
[21:24] grace of
[21:25] So while I'm just telling you what he
[21:26] was saying, he's saying if it applies to
[21:29] you, if you can believe the gospel, you
[21:31] could be set free and have a Easter
[21:33] morning
[21:37] out of the darkness. Praise the Lord.
[21:40] Yes, sir. He said people sitting here
[21:43] with tumors,
[21:46] with blindness,
[21:47] all kinds of conditions. Yet God sent
[21:51] Christ to open their prison doors and to
[21:54] set them free. Amen. You say, "Is
[21:56] sickness a bondage?" Yes, it is. The
[22:00] woman was scooped over and Amen. But he
[22:03] healed her. Oh, not this daughter of
[22:06] Abraham be loosed or set free from this
[22:10] bondage that she had in Satan. So Christ
[22:13] our grand redeemer has come to set men
[22:17] and women free from sin, free from
[22:19] sickness. For he was wounded for our
[22:22] transgressions, bruised for our
[22:25] iniquities, and by his stripes we are
[22:28] healed.
[22:30] [Applause]
[22:40] Say it again. I'm here.
[22:42] I am whole. I am whole. From the top of
[22:44] my head to the tip of my toe. Receive
[22:48] it.
[22:52] [Applause]
[23:05] In the name of Jesus Christ. Glory to
[23:08] God. Hallelujah. He said that's good
[23:10] news. That's the gospel. That is the
[23:13] gospel that Christ died in the sinner's
[23:15] place.
[23:17] That he took your place of Calvary. He
[23:20] took the sick man's place. Christ took
[23:23] the sinner's place. He took the worried
[23:27] man's place. If you're worried this
[23:29] morning, Christ take the maniac's place.
[23:32] Hallelujah. Last night I attended a
[23:34] service where a preacher now his son was
[23:37] out in the world and he prayed for him
[23:40] and the boy who come back and come to
[23:42] the house of God and brother Danko was
[23:45] speaking how he just preached there and
[23:47] came back and how he spoke to the young
[23:50] man and said you know you're here in
[23:51] your daddy's church you think you you
[23:54] should play that guitar that you
[23:55] normally play out there in the church
[23:59] become a part of the body of Christ or
[24:00] whatever just play it and give let God
[24:03] have glory in your life. Amen. And the
[24:05] boy says, "Yeah." And he agreed to do it
[24:08] and he started to um play it a little
[24:11] bit. Just a couple of days. Brother Dang
[24:15] came back and they texted him the other
[24:17] day. All of a sudden, the boy came to
[24:19] church to go to play and something fell
[24:22] on him and he went insane instant.
[24:26] Nothing but the devil. Amen. trying to
[24:28] block his soul from coming fully and
[24:30] giving over completely to Christ. Some
[24:32] of you today, the devil comes upon you
[24:35] like that trying to block you. Amen.
[24:37] It's nothing about you, but it's the
[24:38] devil trying to keep you from the
[24:43] blood of Jesus Christ. It's nothing but
[24:46] Satan. Amen. But we take your rebellion
[24:49] spirit that is the death
[24:52] of oppressor and oppressive under our
[24:55] control. The glory of God and the church
[24:58] of the living God.
[25:00] who are free of treat
[25:03] [Applause]
[25:16] forever more. He took your place and
[25:19] free from every affliction, every sin
[25:22] that the devil puts upon us in the
[25:24] prison house. Christ comes upon us
[25:27] freely so that everyone could go free.
[25:30] Praise God. Forever more. Hallelujah.
[25:33] Amen. Yes, sir. Now, in them days,
[25:37] brother Bren said, they were slaves.
[25:40] And when they were in bondage, you know,
[25:45] to free, you see here, Abraham Lincoln
[25:49] died to free the colored man, to give
[25:52] him rights not to be a slave any longer.
[25:55] You know that from history, right? Amen.
[25:58] And they were and they were to be free
[26:01] on the sunrise of the next day. They
[26:04] were so happy about it knowing that they
[26:07] were going to be free as the sun as soon
[26:10] as that sun came up. Hallelujah. Amen.
[26:12] Praise the Lord. Some of them healthier
[26:15] and more physically fit than others
[26:18] climbed way up on the mountaintop. Amen.
[26:22] Some could not go all the way up. Some
[26:24] will go halfway, some part way, some way
[26:27] down. He's talking about what I'm
[26:29] telling you right in the church. There
[26:30] is levels of how growth in the church
[26:34] cuz you some people believe when they
[26:35] come to a church, everybody should be
[26:37] dressed in the, you know, the way that
[26:40] one should really dress appropriately,
[26:43] right? And dress modestly in the house
[26:47] of the living God. But uh as you know
[26:50] that's that's not the standard that
[26:52] we're going to have a uniform where
[26:54] everybody is like that. But the whole
[26:57] church is always in a stage of growth.
[27:00] There's young ones coming in. There's
[27:01] others at another level, other ones and
[27:04] other ones at the top. And this is what
[27:05] he's talking about here. He said there
[27:07] ones that were physically strong,
[27:10] spiritually strong and healthy. They
[27:14] climbed all the way to the top of the
[27:16] mountain. Others, you know, halfway up,
[27:20] others a little lower down, others down,
[27:22] and some in the valley of confusion
[27:24] still. Amen. See, there they were down
[27:28] in the valley of confusion, but they
[27:30] raised up. And soon as they could see
[27:34] that sun rising, they began to scream to
[27:38] the top of their voices to the ones
[27:40] below. that the ones belong could not
[27:43] see the sunrise yet, but they believe
[27:46] the ones that are saying
[27:50] [Applause]
[27:52] I have to be a part of this
[27:56] and you may not be able to see all that
[27:58] I'm seeing revelation wise, but at least
[28:01] if you can believe all things.
[28:04] [Applause]
[28:07] Amen. Hallelujah. Oh, they screamed, "We
[28:11] are free." Praise God. And those that
[28:14] were on the hill could see the sun
[28:17] coming up. Hallelujah. Oh, praise God.
[28:20] The blessing said there was no news like
[28:23] that good news that the sun was up. S
[28:27] and that he was risen from the dead.
[28:30] There is no
[28:32] praise. Good news from the great God.
[28:35] Glory to God. Hallelujah. I'm so
[28:38] thankful that the Lord Jesus Christ rose
[28:40] up from the dead and he's alive forever
[28:43] more. Now is Christ risen now. Not
[28:47] yesterday back there 1900 years ago, but
[28:50] he's raised up now. Praise God. He who
[28:54] they tried to have tomb within the word
[28:57] is now been set free by the breaking of
[28:59] the seven seals. Amen. Hallelujah. I
[29:03] remember as a boy going to St.
[29:05] Calamishas RC and they had a great big
[29:09] Bible about this size thick like that on
[29:11] the on the uh what do you call a
[29:14] platform restaurant whatever and it had
[29:16] a padlock on the key. Nobody was allowed
[29:20] to read from it but the priest who was
[29:22] holy enough to read from it and only he
[29:25] could do it. And when he opened that
[29:27] book, it's like a fear because nobody
[29:30] knows what's going to come out of the
[29:32] book reading about the candlesticks of
[29:34] Revelation and and the beasts and all
[29:37] these things like that. A fear came upon
[29:39] people. They didn't want to touch the
[29:41] Bible. But that was a scheme of the
[29:43] devil not to let the people read their
[29:45] Bible and know what God really said.
[29:48] So that they can tell the people
[29:49] everything that they want them to
[29:51] believe. Amen. But thank God we've been
[29:54] set free. Yeah. Arise and be open. Those
[29:57] of us who were Catholics, arise and be
[29:59] open. We recognize the truth of the word
[30:02] for the hour. That Mary is not our
[30:04] savior. But Jesus is our savior. Praise
[30:07] God. Mary raised from the death. Christ
[30:09] rose from the dead. Mary was not
[30:12] crucified on the cross. Christ was
[30:14] crucified on the cross. Amen. He took my
[30:16] place at Calvary. There is no pity, but
[30:20] there is one mediator between God and
[30:22] man. And his name is the Lord Jesus
[30:23] Christ. There is no other name given
[30:26] under heaven whereby we must be saved
[30:28] but the name of the Lord.
[30:34] Amen. If he isn't the risen then we're
[30:37] rich and vain and we trusting in a dead
[30:40] savior like the other religions trusting
[30:43] in a dead m or a dead Buddha rat rama or
[30:48] a dead sweetenber whatever their name su
[30:52] confucious
[30:54] you know whatever the names are they
[30:56] believe in men that are dead burying
[30:59] their tomb their bones are separate to
[31:02] those people. Amen. But we have no
[31:04] sacred throne of Jesus. Amen. Because
[31:07] he's not here. He's risen.
[31:11] [Applause]
[31:12] See, he's already gone. Amen. Glory to
[31:15] God. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes, sir. So, we
[31:19] know that the resurrection answers all
[31:22] the questions that now we have victory
[31:24] over death. We have victory over the
[31:28] grave.
[31:29] Hallelujah. And that's what Job had a
[31:32] revelation of. He knew it. He said even
[31:35] though the skin worms, they're
[31:36] destroying this body. Yet in my flesh, I
[31:40] can see God. Amen. Because he knew that
[31:42] he had another body coming and he was
[31:45] going right to that body. So he was
[31:47] still going to see God in his flesh.
[31:49] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[31:51] Hallelujah. John 5:28-29,
[31:54] the hour is coming in which all who are
[31:57] in the grace will hear his voice and
[31:59] will come forth. Amen. No matter where
[32:02] we are, we will hear his voice and come
[32:05] forth. You know, death has been a
[32:07] monster.
[32:08] A a fearful thing to the human race.
[32:11] Even today if people hear the word the
[32:14] doctor tell them anything like cancer
[32:16] they already feel they got a death
[32:18] sentence and fear begins to hit them. I
[32:22] I I read a book where where they were
[32:24] giving a this they were writing about
[32:27] how uh the plague went through France
[32:30] and Europe and killed so many millions
[32:32] of people. And someone asked the plague
[32:36] why why are you so wicked? Why did you
[32:38] kill so many millions? He said it was
[32:40] not me. for spare.
[32:43] They died before he even got there.
[32:46] All right. You see, and a lot of people
[32:48] came to fear and it kills them. Because
[32:51] the thing that you fear will come upon
[32:54] you, says the scripture. That's right.
[32:56] Whatever you scared of will come upon
[32:58] you. You bring it up on yourself by your
[33:00] own fear. Right. Amen. But he says God
[33:04] has not given us a spirit of fear, but
[33:07] of power and love of our self mind.
[33:10] Amen. So we are not to be a fearful
[33:12] people but we are to be a rejoicing
[33:14] people. Amen. Believe in the word of the
[33:17] living God. Hallelujah. Amen. Christ is
[33:20] risen because he he took the sting of
[33:22] death or death. Where is thy sting? Oh
[33:26] pray where is thy victory? Praise God.
[33:30] Hallelujah. Now is Christ risen.
[33:33] Hallelujah. Therefore we are not to be
[33:36] resurrected. Right. Amen. And it's a
[33:39] shameful thing when you see Christians
[33:40] miserable,
[33:42] crotchety,
[33:44] worrying,
[33:46] all this type of grumpy
[33:49] and I like to use the word some look
[33:51] like Mr. Grim or Mrs. Grim. You know, we
[33:55] are not grim grumpy people. We supposed
[33:58] to have joy and speed.
[34:01] Hallelujah.
[34:02] And I don't know person that's joyful
[34:04] that can swallow the joy and compress it
[34:08] within them. It's going to burst out
[34:10] sometime. You're going to have to laugh.
[34:12] You're going to have to rejoice. You're
[34:13] going to have to do something to express
[34:15] that joy because the joy of God in you
[34:17] is like a volcanic
[34:26] myself. That's like some Christians, you
[34:28] know, they hold out God. But we are here
[34:31] to realize that we're in the middle of a
[34:34] genuine Easter and that he is not here
[34:36] but he's risen from the dead. Praise
[34:38] God. Good news from the graveyard. That
[34:41] he's risen. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise
[34:43] God. Now we have the best friend.
[34:48] Our best friend is the Lord Jesus
[34:50] Christ. Amen. Amen. There's not another
[34:53] friend like Jesus. I'm so glad.
[34:56] Hallelujah. Amen. And because he is
[34:58] risen from the dead, not President
[35:01] Trump,
[35:04] but we have the highest position, Amen,
[35:06] in the world. For those who come to
[35:09] Christ, he said, I'll make them into
[35:11] kings and priests unto God.
[35:14] I'm a child of kings. Is that right?
[35:18] You're a child of royalty and even the
[35:21] angels in me. Praise God. Amen.
[35:25] Hallelujah. Because we are children of
[35:27] the most high God. Aren't you happy
[35:30] today?
[35:31] Aren't you happy today?
[35:35] Praise God.
[35:37] Hallelujah. Blessed be the name of the
[35:39] Lord God. Wonderful. We are so powerful
[35:42] that we are going to reign with Christ
[35:44] for a thousand years. Amen. and Satan
[35:46] will be able to do nothing about it
[35:48] because he's been bound in the
[35:50] bottomless pit and you're held there
[35:53] while we are ruling and reigning with
[35:55] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[35:57] Hallelujah. Praise God. So get ready to
[36:00] reign if you're not reigning now because
[36:02] I'm reigning now in this life. I'm
[36:05] reigning right now. Amen. I have power
[36:08] and authority over the devil. I have
[36:10] power over sickness, over brothers.
[36:13] Whatever it is, I walk in confidence. I
[36:16] walk in faith. I walk in expectation of
[36:20] living in a state of endless.
[36:24] Praise God. Hallelujah. I walk in a
[36:27] state of victory.
[36:30] Amen. I'm certain of God. Confident in
[36:34] God. It's only when you get to that
[36:36] place that you're so confident that the
[36:39] universe begins to bring everything to
[36:42] unfold right around you without you
[36:44] having to do anything else because God
[36:47] is working things out. Do you believe
[36:50] that? Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Every
[36:54] one of us can live in that state. We're
[36:56] like, "Oh, this is a shortage here,
[36:58] shortage there, and lack this." There is
[37:01] no lack of God.
[37:03] Don't lack nothing. God is not short
[37:05] anything. Oh, praise God. you don't
[37:07] have. He says all because you do not
[37:09] carry everything to God is great. That's
[37:12] the only reason why we don't talk to God
[37:14] enough to call him up and tell him what
[37:16] you want. Only believe, only trust him.
[37:20] Praise God. I'm so glad he has opened
[37:22] the way for this to happen. And now we
[37:25] live in a great time when we are hearing
[37:28] the good news that Jesus Christ is risen
[37:31] from the dead. Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[37:33] Now we know on the first Easter morning
[37:36] that it was a woman that received the
[37:39] message. Praise the Lord. God bless you,
[37:41] sisters. Brothers, let's give them a
[37:43] hand.
[37:47] [Applause]
[37:50] Praise God.
[37:53] It was Mary and Magdalene
[37:56] and the other Mary came to the empty
[37:58] tomb of Jesus and they were greeted by a
[38:01] shining angel and the angel told them
[38:04] the good news from the graveyard. He
[38:07] told them he is not here. He is risen.
[38:11] Come and see the place where the Lord
[38:14] lay. Well, he used to lay in
[38:16] justification. Luton. He used to lay in
[38:18] sanctification of Wesley. He used to lay
[38:21] in uh speaking in Pentecost. But he's
[38:24] not here. He's risen back today. He's
[38:28] going to the soul ministry now. He's
[38:31] going into the son of man ministry now
[38:33] making himself known to the people.
[38:36] Risen up from the dead and alive forever
[38:38] more. Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
[38:41] today, and forever. Praise the Lord. All
[38:45] my heart. Amen. Amen. And when they went
[38:48] a little further,
[38:50] yes, he said, "Come and see the place
[38:52] where the Lord lay." And then later on,
[38:55] he says, you know, Jesus met them and
[38:58] says, "Go quickly and tell my
[39:01] disciples." I want you to see here there
[39:03] are four words, and I'm winding this up
[39:05] now. Four little words here. Come,
[39:09] see,
[39:11] go, and tell.
[39:14] Is that right? Yep. The first two are
[39:16] linked together. Come and see. And the
[39:19] next two are linked together. Go and
[39:22] tell. Praise the Lord.
[39:25] The first time to come and see.
[39:28] Hallelujah. And be genuinely born again.
[39:32] Baptized with water in the right name in
[39:36] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[39:38] Hallelujah. So you come and you see. You
[39:41] come first and come to church and you
[39:44] keep coming to church until revelation
[39:46] breaks. Until you can see and your
[39:49] blinded eyes are open by the spirit
[39:52] reveals to you the word of God for the
[39:54] eyes. Amen. Amen. And you can begin to
[39:57] sing and rejoice in your heart. I can
[39:59] see clearly now the rain is gone.
[40:02] Hallelujah. Brother Brandham said it is
[40:04] the rising of the sun. All the clouds to
[40:07] boom and doubt. He says, "But the sun
[40:09] rose up, they vanished away and you can
[40:11] see clearly now." Amen. We can see
[40:14] clearly now because the rain is gone,
[40:17] the dust is gone, the fear is gone, the
[40:19] clouds are gone. Our eyes have been open
[40:22] and we recognize our day and the message
[40:24] for our day. Amen. We recognize the
[40:27] unveiling of the mighty God. Hallelujah.
[40:30] First come and see and then go and tell.
[40:33] You got to come, see, and then what? The
[40:36] word that you see is going to stir you
[40:38] into action. Amen. If you're here this
[40:40] morning and you are a genuine believer,
[40:43] get into action. Amen. You've got to
[40:45] tell somebody. You How could they hold
[40:48] their peace when we know that the man
[40:50] was dead, rose up from the grave,
[40:54] and you don't want to tell that story?
[40:56] You need to tell the story. Hallelujah.
[41:00] He rose up from the grave. Amen. Glory
[41:02] to God. Hallelujah. Tell his brothers
[41:05] everywhere. I'm not ashamed of him. It's
[41:08] our duty to run with the message.
[41:11] Says when your day he said your cannons
[41:14] not lift. He says you run with the
[41:17] message. Don't wait to get some
[41:19] education. Just run with what you have.
[41:21] And God is going to help. Hallelujah.
[41:24] Thank you. I got a little poem. Oh
[41:27] Christian brothers shout and sing.
[41:30] Death has lost its ancient state
[41:33] quickly. Now the tiding spread. Let us
[41:37] spread it. Christ is risen from the
[41:39] dead. Would you spread that news? Would
[41:42] you spell spread that good news? Christ
[41:44] is risen from the dead. And now we have
[41:46] good news and we got good news in the
[41:49] graveyard. 1 Corinthians 15:28.
[41:51] Therefore, my beloved brethren, be you
[41:53] steadfast, unmovable, always abounding
[41:56] in the work of God. For as much as you
[41:59] know that your labor is not in vain in
[42:04] the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the
[42:07] name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Oh my. How
[42:10] wonderful. Now watch. He says Christ
[42:14] came to set the captives free.
[42:17] If you are sitting in there in a prison
[42:19] and dead sentence is on you and the
[42:22] first thing they're fixing to take you
[42:23] out next morning to hang you or to
[42:26] execute you, but then you heard somebody
[42:29] say coming down the street, hold him.
[42:32] Don't execute him, I've got the part.
[42:36] I've got the part. Amen. Praise God. How
[42:39] would your heart feel
[42:41] in prison? Somebody's got the part. Now
[42:45] you don't have to wait. He says now you
[42:48] don't have to wait until that time when
[42:51] you are taken out of that prison
[42:55] rapture. Then you don't have to wait
[42:56] till the rapture to think that's when
[42:58] you'll be healed, saved, delivered.
[43:00] Amen. You are justice free right then
[43:04] when you work that good news. Amen.
[43:07] Until the time when they take you out of
[43:09] there. That man should be happy setting
[43:13] him in that prison as he would be out of
[43:15] the prison as long as he know that his
[43:18] bond is signed. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes,
[43:22] sir.
[43:25] Amen.
[43:27] And deliver.
[43:28] Hallelujah.
[43:30] [Applause]
[43:32] It's been delivered onto me that I was
[43:34] once delivered onto the saints. I have
[43:36] received and praise God forever more.
[43:39] Hallelujah. Amen. And I'm free to every
[43:42] man here with a hungry heart this
[43:44] morning. Come out of your prison cells
[43:47] this morning, says the prophet of God,
[43:50] for the good news of the gospel is
[43:53] preached. And don't matter if you're
[43:55] still sitting there and still feeling
[43:57] sick.
[43:59] If you are still sitting there bound,
[44:02] you can be just as free because the good
[44:06] news has come to you. That's right.
[44:08] Amen. Amen. You are part of Christ rose
[44:12] from 1900 years ago today. Amen. To set
[44:16] every prisoner free. Open the prison

[45:47] prove to the people that he's risen from
[45:49] the dead and said go tell my disciples
[45:53] I'm risen from the dead and I will meet
[45:55] with them to confirm this to them. Oh
[45:59] God how this is again in the last day
[46:02] that there will be a light shine across
[46:05] the earth and it will prove to my
[46:08] disciples. Go tell them I am not dead. I
[46:11] am not a tradition, but I am a living
[46:13] Christ today and I will meet them. Take
[46:17] this message to my disciples that I'm
[46:19] risen from the dead and the gospel is
[46:21] still good news from the graveyard.
