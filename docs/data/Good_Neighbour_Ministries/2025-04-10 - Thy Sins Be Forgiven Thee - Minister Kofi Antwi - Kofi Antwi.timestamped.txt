[0:28] Wait in my soul.
[0:35] He's got it
[0:38] all in
[0:44] control. He's got it
[0:47] all in
[0:53] control. He's got it
[0:56] all in control.
[1:02] He's put that
[1:06] reassur waiting in my
[1:10] [Music]
[1:13] soul. He's got it
[1:17] all in
[1:23] control. I'll put my life in his hands.
[1:32] I put my life in his
[1:39] hands. Every word I walked
[1:43] on to show it is his
[1:50] plan. I put my life in his hands. I put
[1:57] my life in his hands.
[2:00] I've put my life in his
[2:07] hands. I put my
[2:10] life in his
[2:15] hands. Every road I walk
[2:19] down, I'm sure it is his plan.
[2:27] I'll put my
[2:29] life in a
[2:33] sight. And if it
[2:38] wasn't for the
[2:42] grace for the grace of God in my
[2:49] life, where would I
[2:53] be
[2:57] today? What would
[2:59] I have done in my life?
[3:05] It was not
[3:08] I who had sought
[3:11] him, but it was
[3:15] Jesus who had sought
[3:18] me. His hand of
[3:21] love. To me was
[3:26] given. And now I
[3:29] belong to it.
[3:36] and
[3:37] David
[3:40] was for the
[3:43] grace for the grace of God in my
[3:51] life. Where would I
[3:55] be today?
[3:59] What would
[4:00] I have done with my
[4:05] life? I was so
[4:08] lost and
[4:12] blinded, walking in darkness of
[4:19] sin. I had
[4:22] God
[4:24] predestinated me.
[4:27] is still to walk in his
[4:35] life. And if it
[4:39] was for the
[4:43] grace for the grace of God my
[4:49] life, where would I
[4:53] be today?
[4:57] What would
[4:58] I have done with my
[5:03] life? I'm on my way
[5:09] towards I
[5:12] possess eternal
[5:16] life. Nothing until
[5:19] now can ever move me.
[5:23] For I know Jesus is the
[5:31] way. And if it
[5:35] wasn't for the
[5:39] grace for the grace of God in my
[5:45] life, would I
[5:49] be today?
[5:53] What would I have done with mine if it
[5:58] wasn't
[6:02] David for the
[6:05] grace for the grace of God in my
[6:12] life? Where will I
[6:15] be today?
[6:19] What would I have done with my
[6:24] life? What marvelous grace,

[15:36] new
[15:38] in my
[15:40] life.
[15:42] [Music]
[15:43] Yesterday is gone. Another
[15:51] day, do something new in my
[15:57] [Music]
[15:59] life. Do something new in my
[16:05] life. Something new in my life. to
[16:10] something
[16:12] new in my
[16:15] life. Oh
[16:19] Lord, something
[16:22] new in my
[16:25] life. Something
[16:27] new in my
[16:30] life. Something
[16:32] new in my life.
[16:36] Oh
[16:38] Lord God bless each and every single one
[16:42] of you. I know it's not an easy
[16:46] walk. If someone tell
[16:49] you to follow Christ is
[16:52] easy then he don't know what he's
[16:55] talking about. That means the enemy has
[16:58] got him or her.
[17:00] But the more you get attacked, the more
[17:04] you run to Christ, it shows you are a
[17:07] child of the
[17:09] king. And may the Lord bless each and
[17:12] every one of you because I
[17:15] know you come here to feed the word of
[17:19] God. And let me tell you, don't take the
[17:24] word of God
[17:25] lightly because Sunday all what we heard
[17:29] was God in action from our beloved
[17:34] pastor. Because the words that was
[17:36] coming from him was not him. Because
[17:39] right now God is in flesh.
[17:42] People are waiting for God to come. He's
[17:44] already here in the word form moving in
[17:48] his wife in the flesh. As our pastor was
[17:52] talking, let me tell you all I could see
[17:55] was Christ in
[17:58] flesh. If you are not seeing
[18:01] that, then you will be dragging your
[18:04] feet to the house of the Lord. But if
[18:07] you are seeing
[18:08] Christ, let me tell you, it's a joy to
[18:11] come to the house of the Lord because
[18:14] when you come, you will be fed. Don't
[18:17] come and look at brother Kofi or pastor
[18:19] Danny or Pas Brother Tim, Deson, Phillip
[18:23] or Christopher, whoever stand here, come
[18:25] to look for Jesus. If you came like
[18:29] that, you I bet you I challenge you, you
[18:33] won't go home
[18:35] empty. God will speak to your need. God
[18:39] will make sure you never go home empty.
[18:43] Amen.
[18:44] Because he's talking, but are we
[18:49] listening to the voice that is speaking
[18:52] to us? Are we
[18:55] recognizing that is not a man? is not
[18:59] even because oh brother so so and so
[19:04] preach powerful message brother so so
[19:07] and so don't preach powerful message
[19:09] that's not the case listen to the
[19:13] voice the voice of God is speaking
[19:17] are you paying attention to it if you
[19:20] pay
[19:21] attention you'll be always be blessed
[19:26] and you always won't be weak. No matter
[19:30] what the enemy, no matter
[19:33] what, he cannot deceive you because you
[19:36] already been chosen. You already been
[19:40] predestinated.
[19:41] You are the word made flesh
[19:44] today. Don't you know that?
[19:47] Don't look at somewhere or
[19:50] something that you think, oh, the word
[19:53] will be made flesh coming. you that are
[19:56] made has been made the word flesh today.
[20:01] May the Lord bless you with my little
[20:05] thought that with my little speak that
[20:08] the
[20:09] Lord Let me tell you Sunday after the
[20:11] service I was saying to myself what am I
[20:14] going to bring on
[20:16] Wednesday a little
[20:18] coffee I don't know but
[20:22] hey he always give me a word regardless
[20:27] what I think I don't know he give me
[20:30] something to bring to you and that's
[20:32] what I'm going to bring whether it's big
[20:35] small I'm going to bring it cuz I'm
[20:38] going to move myself out of the way and
[20:40] he takes
[20:41] control right when he takes control
[20:45] don't look at brother
[20:46] Kofi look at way to Jesus as our prophet
[20:50] William Braham
[20:51] said okay let's take the our
[20:56] Bible sorry for letting you stand for
[21:01] And we read from Matthew chapter
[21:04] 9 to I think verse
[21:13] 8. Pray you brother. I'm looking at you.
[21:18] You
[21:21] sister your son. Yeah. Matthew.
[21:29] All
[21:30] right. Okay. Let his brother pray then.
[21:55] Amen.
[21:57] Amen. Thank you, Lord. Blessed be the
[22:00] name of the Lord.
[22:05] Sometime those that you see that they
[22:08] don't even think they know something,
[22:11] those are the ones God will hide and
[22:15] pull the gift
[22:17] out and display
[22:20] himself because they think they are
[22:23] nothing. They think they don't know
[22:25] nothing.
[22:28] And those are the people God even hide
[22:33] and use for his glory and for his honor.
[22:37] So don't look at the worst. I didn't
[22:38] look at brother you're praying your
[22:40] words. No, no, no. That don't mean
[22:43] nothing to
[22:45] God. Okay, let's read the word. And he
[22:49] enter into a sheep. Matthew chapter
[22:52] 9. and pass over and come into his own
[22:58] city. And behold, they brought to him a
[23:04] man sick of the posy, laying on a bed.
[23:09] And Jesus, seeing their feet, said unto
[23:13] the sick of the posy,
[23:16] "Son, be of good cheer. Thy sins be
[23:22] forgiven thee. That's my title. Thy sins
[23:26] be forgiven
[23:28] thee. And behold, certain of the
[23:33] scribes said within
[23:36] themselves, this man
[23:39] blasphe. You see what they said? They
[23:42] didn't catch
[23:43] it because they were looking at man.
[23:48] But if they were having revelation in
[23:51] them, they could have seen that God was
[23:54] in front of them. Like today when the
[23:58] word is preached, so many in the message
[24:02] look at a man speak. Instead of them to
[24:05] look behind the skin of the man and look
[24:09] away to the pillar of fire, the mighty
[24:12] God hiding in the mind speak, they look
[24:15] says, "Oh, this brother speak. this one
[24:17] so so and so speak but it's most of all
[24:22] the time if you are in spirit you will
[24:24] see that it is God especially here
[24:28] that's
[24:29] speaking
[24:31] okay and behold certain of the scribes
[24:35] says within themselves this man
[24:38] blaspheing and Jesus knowing their
[24:41] thought said wherefore think ye evil in
[24:45] your heart. You see the word discern
[24:49] their
[24:50] hearts. For whether it's easy to say,
[24:55] "Thy sins be forgiven thee," or to say,
[25:01] "Rise and
[25:03] walk." But that ye may know that the Son
[25:07] of Man had power on earth to forgive
[25:12] sin. Then said he to the sick of the
[25:16] posy, "Rise, take up thy bed, and go
[25:23] into thy house." And he rose and
[25:27] departed into his house. Watch again.
[25:31] But when the multitude saw it, they
[25:36] marvel and glorify
[25:39] God which has given such power unto men.
[25:45] May the Lord add his blessing. Please be
[25:48] se sit down.
[25:51] I want you to
[25:54] know even though after Jesus has
[25:58] designed their
[26:00] hearts,
[26:01] right, they still standing
[26:05] there
[26:07] thinking, "Oh, God has given power onto
[26:12] man. Such power unto
[26:14] men." You see, they were thinking future
[26:20] But they were not
[26:22] recognizing that it was God standing in
[26:26] front of them.
[26:29] Read the
[26:31] word again. But verse eight, but when
[26:35] the multitude saw it, they marble and
[26:40] glorify God. They were glorifying God
[26:43] somewhere like some people when they go
[26:46] to church. Instead of them to glorify
[26:49] the word that is coming in
[26:52] flesh, they they are thinking
[26:55] imagination God is somewhere. So they
[26:57] glorifying that God. Come on.
[27:01] Jesus was standing in front of them. The
[27:05] word was standing in flesh. Amen. Just
[27:08] like today. Amen. The word is in flesh.
[27:13] Amen.
[27:15] The word is in the wife of Christ in
[27:19] flesh. So recognize the word that is in
[27:24] flesh in your day and catch it
[27:28] and go home and leave
[27:31] it. Simple as
[27:35] that. They they marvel and glorify God
[27:39] which has given such power unto
[27:42] men. They were thinking God who has
[27:46] given power unto man another God like
[27:50] the same way denomination think oh there
[27:53] is Jesus son of God they don't know son
[27:56] of god means god in
[27:58] flesh right god they think the way they
[28:02] think god somewhere don't think like
[28:05] that
[28:07] right
[28:09] god is now in skin in flesh
[28:13] in his wife talking. So when the wife
[28:18] the 54 ministry is bringing the word
[28:23] don't look at somewhere is the word that
[28:27] has made flesh speaking to you right now
[28:32] because when he
[28:34] said thy sins be forgiven thee who can
[28:40] forgive sin only God only God
[28:44] right so when God has forgiven sin and
[28:49] you know this day right where is
[28:53] God? God is in you at this hour you are
[28:59] the word made
[29:01] flesh. That's why the Bible says the
[29:03] saints of God will judge the earth. So
[29:07] in your mouth, if you are the wife of
[29:10] Christ, in your mouth, the word that
[29:14] come out from you is God speaking
[29:18] through you, his own word to the people.
[29:23] That's why Jesus says, "What you shall
[29:26] bow on earth will be bound in heaven."
[29:30] What you
[29:32] shall re accept on the earth will be
[29:35] accepted there. What do you think he was
[29:38] talking
[29:39] about? He was talking about you that the
[29:42] power is given to you. He himself in
[29:45] you. He has told us I will be with you
[29:47] in you till the end of the world. So
[29:50] right now he's in earth. So we are the
[29:53] one made flesh. Amen. As I am speaking
[29:57] to you, your sins are forgiven. Do you
[30:01] know why? I believe it. Because the God
[30:05] that dwell in me, if you are bride, you
[30:09] have no sin. You may say, "Brother Kofi,
[30:12] don't worry about this. We're not
[30:14] talking about the flesh. We talking
[30:17] about the inside man, the inner man. The
[30:20] inner man is portion of God that is the
[30:25] word for the day
[30:27] and he is
[30:29] speaking. So God want us to recognize
[30:34] that when we recognize that as our
[30:38] pastor was saying Sunday all the gossip
[30:42] will be go out from the sanctuary.
[30:46] All by biting spirits will be gone out
[30:50] from the sanctuary or even in your
[30:53] lips. Everything that is not of God that
[30:57] this outside person tried to bring to
[31:00] you because you have recognized who you
[31:04] are, you can cast him out.
[31:07] Jesus said in my name you cast out
[31:10] devils.
[31:11] What do you
[31:12] think? You can cast this outside man out
[31:16] because Christ in you is stronger than
[31:20] anything. But if you don't recognize
[31:24] that, you will be
[31:27] always dragging your feet. Even coming
[31:30] to church, you'll be always dragging
[31:32] your feet with prosperity.
[31:36] You may say prosperity, yes, prosperity
[31:39] is yours. But some of us, we sit down
[31:42] for the devil to rob us, to attack us,
[31:46] to take everything that we deserve. But
[31:50] if you recognize who you really are,
[31:54] God, your mouth has become the mouth of
[31:58] God. Your feet has become the feet of
[32:02] God. Your thought has become the thought
[32:05] of God. Everything that you do without
[32:09] you, God doesn't have hands and feet but
[32:11] your hands. God doesn't have mouth but
[32:14] your mouth. The
[32:17] heart. That's why the Lord want us to
[32:20] always recognize no matter what the
[32:23] enemy has attacked you. No matter how
[32:26] let me tell you for him his job is to
[32:29] bombard you. He will bombard you. He
[32:32] will frustrate you. He will take
[32:34] everything if you don't recognize it.
[32:37] But I challenge you. Take the word of
[32:42] God with the spirit of God backing you.
[32:47] God live in you.
[32:50] Some of us we've been sitting here for
[32:53] years after years after years after
[32:57] years as our pastor was saying 32 years,
[33:01] 33 years, some 40 years, 38 years, 36
[33:06] years. What make you come day in day
[33:10] night? Is the spirit of God in you?
[33:15] You are not ordinary person walking on
[33:19] the street or going to church. You are
[33:22] son or daughter of God made flesh.
[33:27] The word in you has made what?
[33:31] Flesh. So rise
[33:33] up, take the sword of the Lord and says,
[33:38] I am a child of the king. Amen. I am
[33:42] what God says I am. I am what God says I
[33:47] am. I am what God says I can do. Some of
[33:52] us is still playing I can. I can. I can.
[33:58] I can. God doesn't deal with cans. God
[34:02] deal with with him all things are what?
[34:07] Possible. Through him I coffee can do
[34:11] all things. I can surprise you through
[34:14] Christ. Let me tell you
[34:19] Peter surprise even to today people that
[34:24] are reading the Bible we that have come
[34:26] behind
[34:28] them. Don't it surprise you what the
[34:31] Lord did through Peter? Doesn't it
[34:34] surprise you what the Lord did through
[34:36] John? Doesn't it surprise you what the
[34:39] Lord did through even Moses, Isaiah,
[34:42] John the Baptist? Doesn't it surprise
[34:45] you what the Lord did through William
[34:47] Abraham? A lot of people are praising
[34:50] William Abraham. No, it's wrong. Praise
[34:55] Jesus.
[34:57] Because it was Jesus that was hiding in
[35:00] Williamra. But with Abraham
[35:03] recognize that hey I am the prophet of
[35:08] the age because Jesus says so to me. I
[35:12] am the one that fulfilling the word. I
[35:15] am the word that has made flesh in my
[35:18] day. The seven seal couldn't open. Okay.
[35:23] It have to go through Williamraham.
[35:25] Christ have to come through who? William
[35:27] Arab body because he was earthly
[35:30] messenger. The prophecy was there. It
[35:32] will never go nowhere but come through
[35:35] with Abraham body.
[35:37] The word couldn't go through nowhere.
[35:40] But you
[35:44] because you are the word made flesh in
[35:49] your day. So recognize and take
[35:53] authority and begin to charge with the
[35:56] word and says, "Hey, I'm putting my
[36:00] feet. I'm taking
[36:02] authority through Christ. I can do all
[36:05] things through Christ. I can accomplish
[36:09] what Christ says I can accomplish
[36:12] through Christ." Not just the
[36:14] Pharisees. Their job is to
[36:17] criticize. Because you know why? And lot
[36:21] of us sometime we scared we going to
[36:25] make mistake when we are stepping out to
[36:29] walk on the water we scared we're going
[36:32] to make mistake don't worry about
[36:35] it when you were born didn't and you try
[36:38] to walk didn't you fall
[36:41] down so many times you fall down but so
[36:45] many times you get up and now through
[36:48] that you have able to do But
[36:51] walk,
[36:52] talk, do
[36:54] things. God the same way we walk with
[36:58] God. When he has chose you, he has chose
[37:01] you. Not just today, not just you come
[37:04] to this sanctuary, you were chosen
[37:07] before the foundations of this world.
[37:11] You were with him. Come on. You are part
[37:14] of the pillar of fire
[37:16] and you've been prophesied before this
[37:20] world was even created. Now you are
[37:23] sitting in
[37:25] flesh. You have been made flesh. May God
[37:30] help you for you to know that hey I am a
[37:35] prophecy. Amen. A prophecy in the word
[37:39] that made flesh. I'm not praying part of
[37:42] Judas or or uh the Pharisees. I am
[37:47] playing part like Peter or like John,
[37:51] like uh Luke or like Hannah, like Mary.
[37:56] You are carrying the word and the word
[38:00] in you as a matter of fact has become
[38:02] flesh. So don't sit down. Don't think oh
[38:06] I am nobody. You are somebody. You are
[38:10] somebody bigger than what you think.
[38:12] That's why brother Abraham used to say
[38:15] if you recognize who you are, you could
[38:18] speak your well and go and live in. What
[38:22] do you think he was talking about?
[38:24] Because you have to recognize that hey I
[38:28] am the word made flesh. Once you
[38:32] recognize that do you know there is a
[38:34] power that come over you? Do you know
[38:37] the confidence come over you? Do you
[38:40] know Satan no matter what happened you
[38:44] not scared no more because you know
[38:47] absent from this body you are present
[38:50] with the Lord. That means you have
[38:52] conquered the dead. You have conquered
[38:56] graveyard. As soon as grave grab your
[38:59] throat you are in the presence of God.
[39:02] So why are you worried?
[39:06] who supposed to be fear you sometime we
[39:09] let the devil push us oh I fear this I
[39:13] can't do this oh depressed
[39:15] oppressed no those things are not of God
[39:20] the things of God give what boldness
[39:24] confidence you understand God doesn't
[39:27] give people that people that h don't
[39:32] know what they are talking about God
[39:35] says
[39:37] My word is spirit and what? Life. If God
[39:42] is in you, there is a life in you and
[39:47] that life is not
[39:49] dead. See the room
[39:52] here. You turn on all the light. What
[39:56] are you going to get? Darkness. Right?
[39:59] But because there is light in this room,
[40:02] everybody can see me. But if you turn
[40:06] close all the light and everything, you
[40:09] can't even find your way to the door.
[40:12] But because of the light, you can find
[40:14] way to the door. You can see me. Why?
[40:17] Because God is light. So when light is
[40:21] in you, your light have to shine.
[40:26] The people you come contact have to
[40:28] know.
[40:29] believers, sinners, anybody, they have
[40:33] to know that God is in you because you
[40:37] are the word made flesh. Amen. When you
[40:40] open your mouth, they have to know. They
[40:43] may not like it. They may try to accuse
[40:47] you. Don't worry about it. Because if
[40:50] they prosecuted Jesus, they will
[40:53] prosecute you. Some people fear
[40:56] prosecution.
[40:58] Some people fear of making mistakes.
[41:01] Kofi doesn't care about those
[41:04] things. God open my eye. I don't even
[41:07] really care about those things. All I
[41:10] care I have one
[41:12] target. My target is what? I came here
[41:17] with the spirit of God in me to this
[41:20] world. And I wanted to fulfill
[41:23] everything God says I have to fulfill.
[41:27] That should be your
[41:29] desire. That should be your calling.
[41:33] That should be your your your your wish.
[41:37] Your wish should be the wish which God
[41:40] has designed you to be. Amen.
[41:45] But I'm afraid sometimes some of us the
[41:50] cultural the family
[41:53] systems takes those things away from us
[41:56] and we don't know who we are. Let me
[41:59] tell you if you really know who you are
[42:04] there's no sadness on you. Even sickness
[42:07] hit you pain this you don't even care
[42:12] about those things.
[42:14] All you know I am a child of the king
[42:18] because the
[42:19] revelation is inside you. Christ who is
[42:23] the light of the world is inside you.
[42:27] There's no darkness inside you. Because
[42:31] those that will worship Christ, the
[42:34] Bible says we will worship him in
[42:37] spirit and in truth. Amen. Right. Am I
[42:42] allowing your truth? Come on. I don't
[42:46] want to preach to grave people.
[42:49] I want people who is
[42:51] alive. If I want to preach into grave, I
[42:54] have so many graveyard in Willing. I'll
[42:57] go there and stand there and preach to
[43:00] the grave people. I want people who are
[43:03] alive. I'm talking to who? H the bride
[43:07] of Christ.
[43:08] Your husband is talking to you.
[43:11] Do you think it's brother Kofi? You
[43:14] think it's
[43:16] me? You think it's me? That's the way he
[43:19] has designed me. Let me tell you, he has
[43:22] designed me like that. Whether you like
[43:25] it or not, that's the way it going to
[43:27] be. Let me tell you that is the way he
[43:32] designed the pastor different. He
[43:34] designed h brother Tim different flip
[43:38] different des different Christopher
[43:40] different coffee is designed
[43:43] different and I tell you the
[43:46] truth I am not a hypocrite person I
[43:50] going to give my all my heart whether
[43:53] you like it or not that's the way God
[43:56] coming out because William Brown gave
[43:59] all his heart whether we like it or not
[44:02] that's the way God came
[44:04] The denomination even told him he was
[44:06] literate, he was dummy, he was all kinds
[44:09] of names they used to call brother
[44:10] Abraham. But we recognize that he was a
[44:14] prophet of the age. If William Bra is
[44:18] standing here, let me tell you so many
[44:21] intellectuals that are hidden in the
[44:23] message, they wouldn't even go
[44:26] close. They wouldn't go close to the
[44:29] prophet. They would think he was dummy.
[44:32] He was literate. He was all kinds of
[44:37] man. But let me tell you, God was in
[44:41] that man. God was in William Abraham.
[44:45] Yes sir. But the word in William Abraham
[44:49] doesn't stay one place because he died
[44:52] in
[44:53] 1965. The word has move on. And the word
[44:58] want us to move with the word. Come on.
[45:01] The word want us to move with the word.
[45:04] He didn't want us to get stuck. A lot of
[45:08] people know all the cause of the
[45:10] prophet, but they haven't met the one
[45:14] that was in the prophet. They don't know
[45:17] that the one was in the prophet now
[45:19] dwell in his wife. His wife and his wife
[45:24] is has even made herself ready. The
[45:28] reason why the rapture hasn't gone for
[45:32] to me for us to meet him in the air
[45:34] because God still have people that is
[45:37] calling. The some of the bride hasn't
[45:40] come yet but it's coming to a
[45:44] time this door will be closed. It will
[45:48] be closed on the gentile nation. We are
[45:51] looking at it. The world is falling
[45:55] apart every day.
[45:58] the stock market, the government, the
[46:01] the fabri, the name it all kinds of
[46:05] things are happening. Prophecies are
[46:08] fulfilling. Yes, sir. It's declaring to
[46:12] us what the prophet told
[46:15] us whether they like it or not.
[46:19] Everything we Abraham preached will come
[46:22] to pass.
[46:24] All of it. Yes, pastor. All of it will
[46:28] come to pass. We may not like it, but
[46:31] it's coming to pass because what he
[46:34] spoke sometime you don't hear from the
[46:37] tape. Thus say the Lord. You think it's
[46:40] William Abraham. No, God coming out in
[46:44] the skin. And if you are
[46:47] careful is coming out. God is coming
[46:50] out. There will be a time you will see
[46:53] even uh 54 ministries standing here the
[46:57] word will come out and it will speak
[47:00] thus say the lord and if you don't watch
[47:03] it you're going to say oh is the
[47:05] pastor's brother Tim is brother
[47:07] Philillip brother Desimo brother
[47:10] Christopher or
[47:11] whoever no is God coming out is God in
[47:17] the king this our God is Not joking. God
[47:22] is serious. Let me tell you, nobody can
[47:26] come here, stand here and fool around.
[47:30] This is not a place you can come here
[47:32] and fool around. If you are not chosen,
[47:34] you'll be
[47:35] gone. If God doesn't like you, even you
[47:40] can hide and come and stand here. But
[47:44] God doesn't like you, you'll be gone.
[47:48] God is not looking for intellectual
[47:51] speech. He's not looking for proper
[47:54] speech. All he's looking at is he's
[47:57] looking at his five for ministry whom he
[48:01] has ordained. Whether the man can speak
[48:03] right, he can't even he doesn't know his
[48:06] ABC D, but all he have is Christ the
[48:10] Lord, Christ the mighty healer, Christ
[48:13] the mighty Savior. Look at how
[48:17] Jesus designed the people heart. He
[48:21] designed them and because they have no
[48:24] part in him, they couldn't recognize
[48:27] that it was God in
[48:31] flesh telling that man his sins are
[48:34] forgiven.
[48:36] And also he was also
[48:40] pointing every one of my wife your sins
[48:45] has been forgiven. The Bible says if you
[48:48] want me to take you to the scripture
[48:50] what did the Bible says the sins of
[48:54] God we don't have
[48:57] sin. Don't you know that the Bible says
[49:00] we don't have sin. If you are true bride
[49:03] the saint doesn't have sin.
[49:06] Yeah. The seed of God doesn't have sin.
[49:09] No sin at all. And who do you think is?
[49:12] It's you. It's me. We don't have no sin.
[49:17] Don't let nobody condemn you. Oh, you
[49:20] did this. You did that. Yes, this man
[49:23] did it. But what about the inner man?
[49:26] Does the inner man did
[49:28] it? The word of God did it. The word of
[49:31] God is me did it. No. bring the word and
[49:35] see whether I will argue I I will
[49:38] challenge
[49:39] it. That's what Esau was trying to take
[49:43] it to his father to deceive his father
[49:47] so that he will get the birth right. But
[49:50] Jacob have the word inside
[49:53] him. Don't you know you are like
[49:57] Jacob? The word is already inside you.
[50:01] So you have no sin. No matter what the
[50:04] outside do is not you. If God want to
[50:09] strengthen you, he will bring you
[50:12] up. Just a thought like that. Boom. You
[50:16] will be going in your corner crying,
[50:19] moaning without even nobody telling you
[50:22] nothing. You will know when you make
[50:25] mistake. You can't even sleep. You can't
[50:28] even even think right. That seed in you
[50:32] going to battle with you till you make
[50:36] things right. Because why? God is hiding
[50:41] in you. And you are the word that has
[50:45] made flesh. You have no sin. You are a
[50:50] child of the king. You are the apple of
[50:53] his eye. You are God's sons and
[50:57] daughters.
[50:58] So have
[51:00] confidence. Let us trust the Lord. The
[51:05] word that is coming here. Let us receive
[51:08] it with gratitude, with boldness, with
[51:12] confidence, with joy, with happiness.
[51:16] Because when we do that, God will flow
[51:20] more and more out. God will come more
[51:23] and more out. You may think, "Oh, this
[51:26] brother don't know nothing." Yeah, I may
[51:28] not know nothing but I know the altar.
[51:31] The altar know me. I know him. That's
[51:34] all matter to me. That is all matter to
[51:38] me. If God knows me, I knows him. What
[51:43] are you going to say? Brother Kofi don't
[51:46] know nothing. You may say that I don't
[51:49] care one bit. One bit. All I care is the
[51:54] king has told me I am one of his bride,
[51:58] his
[52:01] wife. If you see like
[52:04] that, don't you
[52:07] know even when you are no matter how
[52:10] sickness come in
[52:11] you that sickness have to take Christ in
[52:14] you before he can take you.
[52:18] Don't you know that when I was in the
[52:21] hospital, I I used to say to myself,
[52:25] Satan, you think you have got me in the
[52:28] bed. Take
[52:30] Christ, then you can take me. If you
[52:33] can't take Christ, you cannot take me
[52:37] cuz I am in him. I'm his son.
[52:40] Hallelujah. I am one of his. I don't
[52:44] care what I'm coming out. Lazarus went
[52:48] to the grave. Jesus by Lazarus believing
[52:52] in Jesus he came
[52:56] out. We think it's just a story. It's
[52:59] reality. But these
[53:02] days tradition and cultural make people
[53:06] don't believe the word. They think they
[53:08] believe but so many don't believe. Even
[53:12] writing the message so many don't
[53:15] believe it. few. That's why the Bible
[53:18] says many are called but few are what?
[53:23] Chosen. So the chosen
[53:26] ones, the rechosen ones, they have
[53:31] confidence. They have
[53:33] crossover. They in the capstone as our
[53:36] pastor was saying they are feeding with
[53:39] the king of king which is the lord Jesus
[53:43] Christ. He abide in them. They abide in
[53:47] him.
[53:49] They and him has become one flesh. Then
[53:53] I they know I
[53:56] know that God is in me. Nobody can fool
[54:00] me. No man can fool me. You can't lie to
[54:05] me about this Bible because I know God
[54:09] is in me and I
[54:11] know I am going back to him. No matter
[54:15] what, I will go back to God. I came from
[54:19] Jesus Christ. I'm going back to Jesus
[54:23] Christ. Don't you know that is the bride
[54:26] talk? Don't you know that is your
[54:29] talk? Don't you know that is your
[54:34] your your your your way of believing the
[54:37] word says Satan no matter what you bring
[54:41] to me I am a child of the king I am a
[54:44] child of the king I may not know so many
[54:47] code this code that code this code this
[54:50] if you know wonderful God has given to
[54:53] you wonderful for it but all I know I am
[54:59] a child of the king I have repented
[55:02] repent of my sins. I baptize in Jesus'
[55:05] name. The Lord Jesus Christ's name is
[55:08] upon me. He's my husband. He's my
[55:12] everything. He's the one that I love. I
[55:16] love him more than anything. I love him
[55:20] more than my wife, my children, my
[55:23] father, my mother, my sister, my uncle,
[55:27] my friends, anybody in the world. I love
[55:30] Jesus more than that. Amen. I am not
[55:34] lying. Hallelujah.
[55:36] I am not. I'm telling the
[55:40] truth. If you can reach that point, let
[55:44] me tell you, all things are possible.
[55:47] Amen. All things, not have, all things
[55:51] are possible. Then God have confidence
[55:54] in you.
[55:56] He have your words become positive
[56:01] not negative.
[56:03] You become
[56:04] boldness. You become a hot potato for
[56:08] the devil because he know that you have
[56:11] the key over him to put him in jail and
[56:16] lock him
[56:17] up. Can you say that you in Jesus name?
[56:23] Don't you know you have the key? Amen.
[56:25] To lock Satan up.
[56:28] What are you going to do to me? A hot
[56:30] potato like this. He hit one, God in me
[56:34] will hit him back 10 times. I said he
[56:38] hit one. God in coffee going to hit him
[56:41] 10 times.
[56:43] You got to believe like that. You got to
[56:47] stand like that. Take boldness with the
[56:50] word. Like that. Then the word
[56:54] become pure read to you. Not just
[56:58] reason.
[57:00] Raising is not good. It's not of God. If
[57:05] you are raising with God word that God
[57:08] allowed you to reason to know more about
[57:12] him, that's okay. But if you are reason
[57:16] that will take you away from him, that's
[57:19] of the devil. And too many people have
[57:22] that because what spoken word is the
[57:26] original what?
[57:27] Seed. Our words must bring
[57:31] life. The words that we speak must be
[57:35] life. Not just words.
[57:39] We have to learn how to shut
[57:42] up, how to
[57:44] speak, how
[57:47] to calm
[57:49] down, rely on God. So that when you
[57:53] speak, I have learned that with my
[57:56] children, even my wife, I've learned
[57:59] that no, there are certain things
[58:02] sometime is doing. I'm seeing it, but I
[58:05] have to quiet.
[58:07] Not until God allowed me to speak. I
[58:11] will not speak. It's none of my
[58:14] business. You know
[58:17] why? God is using her to train
[58:21] me. Sir, Kofi, do that. I'm
[58:25] learning. I'm really learning. And it's
[58:29] helping me to become good so that the
[58:33] spoken word in me could come out more
[58:36] and more.
[58:37] more and more. Not just
[58:40] talk, oh the Bible says this, this that
[58:42] that you know we human beings we talk
[58:45] this that that. No, you want exactly
[58:49] where God want it to come from your lips
[58:52] so that when it comes it
[58:55] blesses your brothers and
[58:58] sisters even it blesses the sinner on
[59:01] the street. It blesses who God wanted to
[59:05] bless. If he wanted to save
[59:08] someone, it will bless him and save
[59:12] him. Otherwise, we going to take the
[59:16] word which is
[59:18] not in
[59:20] season. We're going to just speak the
[59:24] words. The prophet says prophet said
[59:27] that. This word says that. This word,
[59:29] the word says this, this that. And
[59:32] meanwhile, you just using the word like
[59:36] a baby who don't know how to
[59:41] sit in the
[59:43] washroom and go right way. He will just
[59:47] spread himself and go washroom
[59:49] everywhere. The Lord doesn't like that.
[59:53] God doesn't like that. God want us to
[59:58] yield ourself to him so that our mouth
[1:00:04] when we open is him coming
[1:00:08] out. That is the spoken word. In
[1:00:12] another spoken word is coming out from
[1:00:14] you. That is the real you. Don't you
[1:00:18] know that when you speak in a spoken
[1:00:20] word, that is you coming out. You coming
[1:00:24] out, God in you coming out. God wanted
[1:00:28] to come out. But until we recognize
[1:00:33] ourself really really
[1:00:35] good that the Lord want to come out of
[1:00:40] us, right? Then we cannot do the job.
[1:00:44] The
[1:00:47] Pharisees
[1:00:49] Jesus
[1:00:51] saw the people that come and he said,
[1:00:55] "Thy
[1:00:56] sins are forgiven thee." Right away the
[1:01:00] Pharisees, "Oh, this man blasphe
[1:01:02] me." Because Jesus was standing there as
[1:01:05] a man just I'm standing
[1:01:07] here. But it was God in flesh.
[1:01:14] So you and
[1:01:15] I sometime we talk to the people they
[1:01:19] will say oh this man talked to me look
[1:01:21] at what he says but I tell you the
[1:01:26] truth. They fail to
[1:01:29] recognize as those Pharisees back there
[1:01:33] failed to recognize that it was God in
[1:01:37] flesh.
[1:01:39] God is saying, "Thy
[1:01:43] sins are forgiven thee." You have no
[1:01:47] sin, no sin, no charge, no problem. We
[1:01:52] will say in modern day, no problem.
[1:01:56] Jamaica people say, "Ye man, no problem
[1:01:59] at all."
[1:02:01] Right? Jamaica say, "Yeah, no problem."
[1:02:05] That means he doesn't have anything with
[1:02:07] you against you.
[1:02:10] Right? That's the way God
[1:02:13] want in
[1:02:15] you. He have no sins at all. Don't look
[1:02:18] at the outside man. The outside man will
[1:02:22] fail you. But look at the inner man. God
[1:02:26] love you. Brother Kofi love you
[1:02:30] too. Let us love our pastor. The word is
[1:02:35] bringing is
[1:02:38] truth. Let us back him up. His mind, my
[1:02:44] my my
[1:02:45] my he who have an
[1:02:47] eye can see. But he who have no eye
[1:02:51] cannot see. Mikov, I don't know. I see.
[1:02:55] That's why I'm telling you. Not because
[1:02:58] he sit here. I'm telling you is the
[1:03:01] truth. the word he's bringing. I go
[1:03:05] home. I
[1:03:07] listen and I say,
[1:03:09] "Wow, this is God. God in the
[1:03:14] scheme." God is trying to tell us
[1:03:17] something. God is trying to tell you and
[1:03:21] I that, "Hey, I'm here. I'm in. You
[1:03:25] recognize. Recognize who you are. Don't
[1:03:28] be discouraged. Don't look at the world
[1:03:32] how the things are going. Recognize when
[1:03:34] you recognize when you seek me first.
[1:03:38] Let me tell you, I'll give you the
[1:03:41] treasures of
[1:03:44] darkness. Is it not in his word? This is
[1:03:48] Kofi
[1:03:50] word. This is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:53] word. Challenge him. Prove him.
[1:03:57] You come, you seek him, you love him,
[1:04:01] you do everything he
[1:04:03] said and said,
[1:04:07] "Lord, you said
[1:04:09] this. I believe
[1:04:12] it. I obeyed. Honor your
[1:04:16] word." He will honor it and it will
[1:04:19] shock you. It will surprise you because
[1:04:23] he's a
[1:04:25] God that never short of everything. He's
[1:04:30] a God that gave his
[1:04:33] children everything that they need. But
[1:04:36] if you don't recognize it, I'm sorry.
[1:04:40] Brother Kofi going to recognize
[1:04:42] it and going to enjoy everything God
[1:04:46] have for me
[1:04:48] before you can push me around. People
[1:04:52] used to say things not you the ones here
[1:04:55] now or my brothers and sister here and
[1:04:58] I'll go in the corner and cry and moan
[1:05:01] hide it even I won't tell
[1:05:03] nobody because and I know I was in
[1:05:07] pain but and I know I haven't even I
[1:05:12] like the brother I can't even pray
[1:05:14] proper and when they asked me to pray oh
[1:05:18] my goodness was like I'm going in a
[1:05:20] washroom I want to go in the washroom
[1:05:22] right away. How would I even open my
[1:05:25] mouth and
[1:05:26] talk? Because when I talk, I'm going to
[1:05:29] get
[1:05:30] attacked by even praying for the
[1:05:34] offering. And I said,
[1:05:36] "Lord, you but you know me better than
[1:05:40] anybody. I can't even I can talk but
[1:05:44] bring the Bible words or say things. H
[1:05:48] you made me you know the heart more than
[1:05:51] anybody the best that I can I just put
[1:05:54] it
[1:05:54] on and and I'm still getting attack what
[1:05:58] is
[1:06:00] this I'll be crying crying crying
[1:06:04] sometime even they call me and rebuke
[1:06:07] me I'm just telling as it
[1:06:10] is call me to rebuke
[1:06:13] me what kind of devil spirit on
[1:06:18] and I'll be go home cry unto the Lord
[1:06:21] till the Lord will
[1:06:23] come and rebuke it right here through
[1:06:27] his servant pastor John Simon and I'm
[1:06:30] sitting down and I say Lord you are so
[1:06:34] good because you know my heart more than
[1:06:37] anything you see me
[1:06:41] preaching I wasn't even thinking of
[1:06:46] No, but
[1:06:50] God called me. I know. I have
[1:06:55] confidence. I have confidence in him. He
[1:06:59] put me here. Otherwise, if I said I can
[1:07:03] do it,
[1:07:05] no, but I'm trusting in him. He says,
[1:07:09] Kofi, don't worry about your words.
[1:07:12] Don't worry how you talk to. I have
[1:07:14] chosen you. I am going to make sure is
[1:07:18] me. Have confidence in me. When you make
[1:07:21] mistake, rise up. Because the righteous
[1:07:25] man falls seven times. He rise up seven
[1:07:30] times. Because why? The righteous man
[1:07:32] doesn't have a
[1:07:34] sin. Abraham does not have sin. God
[1:07:38] didn't look at Abraham that he fall
[1:07:40] seven times. And he won't look at copi
[1:07:42] fall seven times. He won't look at the
[1:07:44] five for ministry that we fall seven
[1:07:47] times. He won't look at you that you
[1:07:48] fall seven times. He don't look at that.
[1:07:51] All he look at you
[1:07:53] is do you love him? As our pastor was
[1:07:57] saying, are you going to walk with him
[1:08:01] to the end?
[1:08:03] Are you going to walk with him? And at
[1:08:06] the end, you're going to say, "Thy good
[1:08:07] and faithful servant. Come and enter
[1:08:11] into the joy of the Lord." That's what
[1:08:15] he require. May the Lord bless you
[1:08:19] all. You have no sin in the eyes of God.
[1:08:24] May the Lord bless you. That's
[1:08:27] my word. The Lord gave it to me.
