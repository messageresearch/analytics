[8:40] [Music]
[8:41] hallelujah
[8:44] you know sometimes god will put you in
[8:46] situations where it's
[8:48] the test you don't try your faith
[8:52] the proof his word
[8:54] you know yesterday i was at
[8:56] a volleyball game for my daughter
[8:59] and
[9:00] it's not the place you want to be
[9:02] you know on a saturday my perfect
[9:04] situation would be at home and you know
[9:06] consecrating myself getting my ready to
[9:09] come here this morning to stand before
[9:11] you
[9:12] but sometimes god has put you in
[9:13] situations and you ask why lord
[9:17] but you want to be there for your
[9:18] children because
[9:19] they are the age where they look at you
[9:21] as a fanatic
[9:24] and you're always talking about god
[9:28] so i'm at this bodyboard game and said
[9:30] lord there's a whole dating lord from
[9:31] nine
[9:32] in the morning till like 5 30. i brought
[9:36] my ipad and
[9:39] you know i said okay i'll listen to some
[9:40] messages but it's not the greatest
[9:41] environment nakedness everywhere you
[9:43] know the stuff they're wearing you know
[9:45] it's
[9:45] vulgarity it's not a place you want to
[9:47] be
[9:48] about halfway through i just got up and
[9:49] i said oh lord i feel so
[9:52] ashamed of myself lord
[9:54] here i am lord
[9:56] i love my child i'm trying to support
[9:58] her
[10:00] the holy spirit comes down he says
[10:01] listen
[10:03] remember when i die i went into hell
[10:08] sometimes
[10:13] i walk out of there and i came back and
[10:16] as i was coming up this young man is
[10:17] coming up and he's saying hey how are
[10:18] you doing because i had done lines
[10:21] for one of the games
[10:22] and he said oh man i have seen you
[10:24] around doing lines until we have to talk
[10:26] in and tell them i'm a christian and
[10:28] started talking about the situation how
[10:30] the games are being put on on saturdays
[10:32] and sundays at good
[10:33] news day and friday good friday they
[10:36] don't care the age of deceit
[10:40] and he says you know
[10:41] it's so refreshing to hear you speak
[10:43] like this he says i used to be a
[10:44] christian you know
[10:46] my father grew me up as a christian he
[10:48] says but i haven't been to church for so
[10:50] long
[10:52] man i tell you the holy spirit came down
[10:53] there we i started testifying to him
[10:56] but what i get to realize after some
[10:58] time god is
[10:59] what you want is a perfect situation but
[11:01] god wants to put you in a place to prove
[11:03] yourself that you're really a christian
[11:05] [Music]
[11:07] we had a great time
[11:09] i don't know what god wants to do but i
[11:10] prayed for him his name is jermaine
[11:12] see what god wants to do but just to
[11:14] realize sometime you have to go down
[11:15] into hell to get your children
[11:18] and me and my daughter had a wonderful
[11:19] time coming back up we were able to talk
[11:22] and our relationship had been strained
[11:24] for so long but the lord has used that
[11:25] situation i just want to say this

[42:00] and we need to recognize the power
[42:03] of the word
[42:04] you know we've heard it so often about
[42:07] he is the word you've got to recognize
[42:09] the word you are the word the word has
[42:13] come the word for this hour we keep
[42:16] hearing it over and over and over again
[42:18] and if you've heard the word for this
[42:21] hour is because god is calling you
[42:24] god is placing you
[42:25] god is giving you faith to recognize who
[42:29] you are but you see our calling an
[42:32] election
[42:33] is for a purpose
[42:34] if he's calling you and you've heard
[42:36] your name it's because god has a purpose
[42:38] for you
[42:40] amen god don't just call your name just
[42:42] to come and assemble in a church
[42:44] and you know join another church because
[42:46] there's 150 churches here within you
[42:50] know within 20 miles that you could go
[42:53] and and you know
[42:54] have ministers minister the word of god
[42:56] to you and you will hear the word of god
[42:58] amen but if you've heard your name you
[43:02] can't assemble anywhere but under the
[43:05] leadership of the holy spirit
[43:08] you're looking for god you're you're
[43:10] listening for god you're you're going to
[43:12] services with expectation in your hearts
[43:15] amen
[43:16] but we can't you know like but the whole
[43:18] problem is that we're still human
[43:20] we're sons of god but yet we're still
[43:22] human and so we've got to deal with the
[43:24] pulls of this life
[43:26] never has there been
[43:28] so many pulls as there are in this date
[43:31] in this hour
[43:32] my god with social media and everything
[43:35] else you know that's there to you know
[43:37] to to distract us the technology
[43:40] i mean the way information moves these
[43:43] days you know one minute you hear
[43:45] something and you think oh this is
[43:46] what's happening then the next minute
[43:48] you'll hear something else and oh well
[43:50] maybe this is what's happening and you
[43:52] know you're so distracted
[43:54] but if you've come into the word of god
[43:57] and you've come under the leadership of
[43:59] the holy ghost
[44:00] jesus said i will send you the comforter
[44:03] which is the holy spirit and it will
[44:07] lead you and guide you into
[44:10] truth
[44:11] all
[44:12] truth
[44:13] all truth
[44:15] so once you've come under that kind of
[44:17] inspiration and you've caught a
[44:19] revelation of who you are then you are
[44:22] you are being pulled by the holy spirit
[44:24] you're being led by the holy spirit
[44:26] you're you're you find yourself under a
[44:29] ministry that's holy spirit led it's
[44:32] supernatural
[44:33] you can't be under some denominational
[44:36] teaching you can't be under man's
[44:38] interpretation of the word of god
[44:41] you just you will not you'll never get
[44:43] fed there just look at your own
[44:45] experience and look to see what what
[44:48] what's drawn you here what's got you
[44:50] here to this day and into this hour
[44:53] you got to look at your your experience
[44:55] and what's taking place right now within
[44:58] your life
[44:59] and see the power of god
[45:02] bringing you over and over again into
[45:04] the services
[45:05] feeding on the word
[45:07] listening to the prophet listening to
[45:09] the word of god and the change and the
[45:12] effect that it's having on you
[45:14] amen praise god
[45:16] we are the body of christ we're
[45:17] connected to one another
[45:20] once you've come into the real true
[45:23] body of christ and the holy ghost places
[45:25] you into the body you come to realize
[45:28] how connected you are to that body
[45:31] how important each and every one of us
[45:34] is
[45:35] in the body how without one
[45:38] we can't be made perfect
[45:41] it's you know we've heard it that we're
[45:42] encamped about by a cloud of witnesses
[45:45] because they're they're watching they're
[45:47] they're they're waiting on us to come
[45:49] into our position so that they can be
[45:52] made perfect
[45:53] so that we can fulfill the purpose and
[45:56] the plan and the word for this day and
[45:58] this hour which is what
[46:01] the rapture
[46:02] the rapture amen praise god hallelujah
[46:06] let's look at the next slide listen to
[46:08] brother branham here
[46:10] invisible union of the bride of christ
[46:13] and that's my message to you church
[46:15] you that's union spiritual union by the
[46:19] word
[46:20] that you're dead to these old husbands
[46:24] you're born anew don't try to dig him up
[46:28] you know you're
[46:29] you've been born again
[46:32] by the revealing of this word
[46:34] when that cloud came down in 1963
[46:38] that was christ coming down to his body
[46:42] that was god coming down to call the
[46:44] names of the sons and daughters of god
[46:47] that would be fulfilling his word in
[46:50] this day
[46:54] so so so he so don't dig don't try to
[46:57] dig him up he's dead if you're a
[46:59] born-again christian
[47:01] that little germ that was predestinated
[47:04] to you
[47:06] it's the word coming on word
[47:09] on word
[47:11] on word
[47:13] onward
[47:14] and come into full
[47:16] stature of christ that's right
[47:20] so he can come get his bride now
[47:24] we're just ready for one thing that's
[47:27] the coming of the lord this is brother
[47:29] branham back in 1965
[47:32] he knew
[47:33] what had taken place
[47:35] he knew the coming of the lord was was
[47:37] already happening he realized what was
[47:40] going on but the world you know the
[47:43] world sees it in a different way they're
[47:45] all waiting on the coming of the lord
[47:47] but we've recognized that he's already
[47:49] come
[47:51] we're already called
[47:53] we're you know those that have
[47:55] recognized have already recognized that
[47:57] they've been placed
[47:59] positionally placed in the body
[48:01] there is your name on the book of life
[48:04] the book of life is the word of god
[48:09] because the word
[48:10] is god
[48:12] and god is the only thing that is life
[48:16] so your name was represented in the
[48:18] bible before the bible became onward
[48:24] i'm going to read that again
[48:25] that's beautiful
[48:28] your name
[48:30] your name was represented in the bible
[48:34] before the bible become onward
[48:38] hallelujah you were in christ before the
[48:41] foundations of the world
[48:43] you were already seen you were god knew
[48:46] when you were going to come into your
[48:47] season brother gabriel god knew exactly
[48:50] when you were gonna be placed as a son
[48:53] or a adopted as a son or a daughter of
[48:55] god because if you were in god that's
[48:58] the only way that you're gonna recognize
[49:00] the word
[49:02] because you are the word you're you're
[49:04] you're not you're you're not jesus
[49:06] christ
[49:08] but you are a portion of the word and
[49:11] that's the reason why you can recognize
[49:13] the word
[49:14] and then and then you know you're going
[49:16] to realize that that that you've got a
[49:18] part in the word
[49:20] and that your part has to come to life
[49:22] because that's the word for this day and
[49:24] this hour
[49:26] if you don't come to life if you don't
[49:28] get into your position you're not going
[49:30] to fulfill the word
[49:32] you're going to fulfill something else
[49:34] outside of the word and we know what's
[49:36] going to go go on outside of the word
[49:38] we know that it's only the bride that's
[49:40] going in the rapture
[49:42] that's that's the only ones that are
[49:43] going to be translated out of this
[49:45] dimension those that have to stay are
[49:47] going to go into tribulation
[49:49] they're going to have to be purged we
[49:50] looked at all of that those whose you
[49:52] know those that that come up in the
[49:54] second resurrection but we are
[49:56] identified by the first
[49:59] resurrection
[50:00] hallelujah
[50:02] so listen here listen he says and if
[50:04] you're here to do that
[50:06] won't it vindicate that word
[50:10] in other words your life
[50:13] you don't have to try and interpret your
[50:14] life
[50:17] christ in you is your hope of glory
[50:20] he will vindicate for himself
[50:24] listen what he says here he'll vindicate
[50:26] that word congregation says
[50:29] amen
[50:30] won't the church vindicate itself
[50:34] won't malachi 4
[50:36] see he he's recognizing the portion of
[50:40] the word that he was why you don't think
[50:42] brother branham knew who he was
[50:45] he was so humble the way that he lived
[50:47] the way that he spoke he would not just
[50:49] come right out and say hey don't you
[50:51] know i'm malachi 4.
[50:54] 5
[50:56] you church is out there you're all going
[50:58] to hell if you don't listen to me
[51:00] no that's not the word
[51:03] that's not
[51:04] but he knew who he was
[51:06] it's just like you and i we know who we
[51:08] are
[51:09] we realize the condition of the world
[51:12] and and that it's actually in darkness
[51:14] that's why this light that we are that
[51:17] that has come upon us has given us life
[51:19] because there's life in christ
[51:23] the life is in the word remember that
[51:26] the life is in the word
[51:28] hallelujah but darkness cannot
[51:30] comprehend light therefore they cannot
[51:34] have life
[51:36] so when you're talking about this word
[51:38] and you're trying to you know testify to
[51:41] people understand you can testify you
[51:44] can show them the word you can read them
[51:47] the word but don't try to make them
[51:49] something that they're not
[51:51] if there is an attribute elected seed of
[51:55] god in there when you speak the word
[51:58] when you when you start to read the word
[52:00] when you start to testify about the word
[52:02] it's not you it's the word in you
[52:06] and it's life
[52:08] it's life it comes out of you and when
[52:11] that life shines onto the darkness
[52:14] and there's election there and there's a
[52:16] seed there that seed just
[52:20] it has to look up
[52:23] it has to look up it has to hear it has
[52:25] to recognize it can't it can't help it
[52:28] it'll vindicate itself and all these
[52:31] other things perfectly
[52:33] perfectly
[52:35] vindicate itself
[52:36] and show
[52:38] that that's what it is
[52:42] amen
[52:44] hallelujah
[52:45] praise god
[52:47] next slide
[52:50] so this morning we're going to look at
[52:54] a call
[52:55] to take your position
[52:58] this is so important saints
[53:01] we need to recognize who we are that's
[53:03] one thing
[53:05] but then we need to realize that we've
[53:06] got a position in the word
[53:09] we've got something that god wants to do
[53:12] in and through our lives the author and
[53:15] the finisher of our faith
[53:18] he started a work in you he's going to
[53:20] finish it brother
[53:22] he's going to finish it one way or the
[53:24] other
[53:25] so you might as well surrender and yield
[53:28] yourself if you've recognized that
[53:30] you're in the word and that you that
[53:32] you've heard your name well it's like
[53:34] when somebody goes to the army
[53:36] they get into the lineup and the
[53:38] sergeant says corporal mozilli
[53:41] prison sir
[53:43] he's going to respond he's going to say
[53:46] take your position
[53:48] and you're going to already know
[53:50] because you've been in training
[53:53] you've been training for so many years
[53:56] you've been walking with the lord for so
[53:58] many years
[53:59] some of you have you know like some of
[54:01] you are disappointed
[54:04] you've been walking so long but yet you
[54:06] can't even do the the simple abc's
[54:09] sometimes
[54:11] the lord is calling us to take our
[54:13] position
[54:15] to recognize the time in the season and
[54:17] the hour that we're living in this world
[54:19] is in gross darkness
[54:21] he needs light and you are that light
[54:25] you are that living word that's being
[54:27] manifest amongst the people when you go
[54:30] to work on monday morning when you go do
[54:33] what it is that you do every single day
[54:35] when you go home when you talk to your
[54:37] wife when you talk to your children you
[54:40] are light you are given light you are
[54:43] given life and you have the ability to
[54:46] change the atmospheres around your life
[54:49] around your home around your finance are
[54:52] like all those things you're living
[54:54] underprivileged
[54:56] but the moment you take your position
[54:58] just look at a person when they get a a
[55:00] a you know a promotion at work
[55:03] they go from being
[55:05] a manufacturing help mate
[55:09] to the assistant supervisor
[55:11] watch that individual
[55:13] they start to act different
[55:16] they start if they've got the maturity
[55:17] to understand that they've been promoted
[55:20] there's a reason for their promotion
[55:22] there's a purpose behind god giving you
[55:25] more revelation
[55:27] because he's given you the
[55:28] responsibility to live it to to walk it
[55:31] to you know to talk it and to do what
[55:34] you know you must do as a son or
[55:36] daughter of god under the leadership of
[55:39] a god-given ministry
[55:40] [Music]
[55:42] hallelujah
[55:44] then the individual gets promoted to
[55:46] supervisor he's not the assistant now
[55:48] he's the supervisor
[55:50] three years down the road he's the vice
[55:51] president
[55:53] before you know it he's the president
[55:56] and he is
[55:57] under the board of directors
[56:01] you see and their position as it gets
[56:04] moves up they become more mature more
[56:06] respected
[56:08] more authoritative
[56:10] they take their position they realize
[56:12] it's a responsibility that they have a
[56:14] responsibility
[56:16] to fulfill that position
[56:19] amen hallelujah well so do you saints
[56:23] let's look at the next slide
[56:26] listen to brother branham he says here
[56:28] watch
[56:29] the church as it comes
[56:31] as it moves just take it in your own
[56:34] mind you historians that studies history
[56:37] look at lutheran church under
[56:39] justification coming just so freshly
[56:42] from catholicism look at it moving then
[56:45] look at wesley coming a little closer
[56:48] into sanctification weaving into the
[56:51] scriptures look at right in between the
[56:53] wesley then the next thing come in was
[56:56] the pentecostal age and the pentecostal
[56:59] age was the restoration of the gifts the
[57:01] spiritual gifts
[57:03] now look at the age coming now right up
[57:07] to the headstone
[57:09] that's leadership
[57:11] that's that's that's dominion
[57:14] god restoring back
[57:16] his dominion he's restoring back
[57:19] the the the dominion that he gave adam
[57:22] and eve in the garden of eden
[57:24] that they had the ability to speak the
[57:26] word and positionally place the trees
[57:29] and name the animals and have dominion
[57:32] and and have dominion over the earth
[57:36] now
[57:37] look at the age coming now right up to
[57:40] the headstone so what do i mean the
[57:42] coming of the lord
[57:44] and made known god in all creation is
[57:47] waiting for the church
[57:49] to positionally
[57:51] find
[57:52] its
[57:53] place
[57:55] hallelujah praise god forevermore
[57:59] hallelujah aren't you glad that god sent
[58:02] us a prophet
[58:04] aren't you glad that god sent us a
[58:06] prophet in this 20th century that that
[58:08] that that had that had a portion in the
[58:11] word that needed to be fulfilled
[58:13] malachi 4 5 revelations 10 1-7 he had
[58:17] those things that needed to be fulfilled
[58:20] so that it could introduce
[58:22] the coming of the lord the mighty angel
[58:24] come down
[58:26] that
[58:28] cloud that came down in 1963 was god
[58:31] vindicating and showing that his mind
[58:35] his his word the light
[58:38] because he was all in all
[58:41] he was the same one that was the elohim
[58:44] back at the beginning when he was elohim
[58:46] you were in him
[58:48] when he was condescending
[58:50] everything that that we look at in the
[58:53] bible everything that we see we we see
[58:56] jesus christ in every type in every form
[58:59] listen brother braham said it himself
[59:01] those seven seals when they when that
[59:03] seventh seal was open it unveiled and
[59:06] opened up the entire bible
[59:08] all the mysteries of the bible were
[59:10] unveiled when that seventh seal was
[59:13] unveiled
[59:15] everything that means that everything
[59:17] that you were everything that you were
[59:19] to be
[59:20] was being unveiled at that time
[59:23] all that was in there all the mystery so
[59:26] if it's the entire bible and brother
[59:29] branham says that christ the mystery of
[59:31] god revealed he is the entire bible
[59:35] he is the word
[59:37] he's all the mysteries
[59:39] he's everything all in all then
[59:41] what are we
[59:42] what are we looking for
[59:45] we should be seeing christ in everything
[59:48] it's all about the word
[59:50] it's all about him it's everything about
[59:53] him listen
[59:54] jesus speaking here
[59:57] john i'm just going to read it
[1:00:00] john chapter 12 verses 44
[1:00:05] to 50.
[1:00:07] jesus cried and said he that believeth
[1:00:09] on him that sent me
[1:00:11] and he
[1:00:13] that seeth
[1:00:14] me seeth him that sent me
[1:00:17] now now i want you to catch something
[1:00:19] here he was the word
[1:00:22] in that day
[1:00:24] he was only saying and speaking
[1:00:27] what the word what the lord what the
[1:00:30] father elohim told him to speak
[1:00:33] because that was the word for that day
[1:00:37] so listen i am come a light into the
[1:00:39] world that whosoever believeth on me
[1:00:43] should not abide in darkness
[1:00:46] so he was the light like we read in the
[1:00:48] beginning was the word and the word was
[1:00:50] with god and the word was god
[1:00:53] and if any man hear my words and believe
[1:00:56] not
[1:00:57] i judge him not
[1:01:03] for i came not to judge the world but to
[1:01:06] save the world
[1:01:07] you see how he was not coming to judge
[1:01:10] at that time
[1:01:12] he was coming to save
[1:01:14] he was coming to fulfill his part in the
[1:01:16] word
[1:01:17] without him doing what he had to do at
[1:01:20] calvary we wouldn't be here today
[1:01:22] amen we need to see the progression of
[1:01:25] the word here we need to recognize
[1:01:27] because then it leads up to your part
[1:01:29] your position your placing listen i am
[1:01:32] come
[1:01:34] so verse 48 he that reject me and re
[1:01:39] receiveth not my words
[1:01:41] hath one that judgeth him

[1:01:49] testifying the word you're you're trying
[1:01:51] to share the word and you know you're
[1:01:53] you're you're saying man why can't they
[1:01:55] see this why can't they accept this they
[1:01:58] actually reject it they'll tell you
[1:01:59] listen i don't believe it

[1:02:06] don't you be trying to convince or or or
[1:02:09] turn somebody into something that
[1:02:11] they're not
[1:02:12] amen
[1:02:14] hath one that judges him the word that i
[1:02:17] have spoken
[1:02:18] the same shall judge him in the last day
[1:02:23] for i have not spoken of myself
[1:02:26] but the father which sent me he gave me
[1:02:29] commandment
[1:02:30] what i should say
[1:02:33] and what i should speak
[1:02:35] and i know that his commandment is life
[1:02:39] everlasting
[1:02:41] whatsoever i speak therefore even as the
[1:02:45] father sayeth unto me so i speak
[1:02:49] well what about us
[1:02:51] god has revealed to us who we are
[1:02:55] our part in the word
[1:02:57] we're not going to speak something that
[1:02:58] that that we don't know
[1:03:00] we're not listen we can quote all day
[1:03:03] long you know there's many that can
[1:03:05] quote the word quote the prophet you
[1:03:07] know but then there's another thing when
[1:03:09] you recognize that you are the word
[1:03:12] and that now the word lives in you and
[1:03:15] that it's fulfilling a part for this day
[1:03:17] and for this hour and those that have to
[1:03:20] recognize those that will recognize they
[1:03:23] will come to the word they will
[1:03:25] recognize what's taking place
[1:03:28] they will realize that they have a place
[1:03:30] in the word because
[1:03:32] out there you know you talk to people
[1:03:34] that that are denominational all their
[1:03:37] teachings are based on what they've been
[1:03:39] taught
[1:03:41] everything is based on what they've been
[1:03:42] taught you know people will say i'm in
[1:03:45] the message i'm in the message
[1:03:48] that doesn't
[1:03:50] classify you as an attribute of god
[1:03:54] i am the message
[1:03:56] that classifies you as an attribute of
[1:03:58] god
[1:03:59] you see there's a difference
[1:04:01] i am in the message
[1:04:03] there's a lot of people in the message
[1:04:06] there's a lot of people that go to
[1:04:08] church more than you and me
[1:04:10] there's a lot that that can quote the
[1:04:12] prophet better than you and me
[1:04:15] but god chooses his own he says on that
[1:04:18] day ye shall know that i am in the
[1:04:20] father he and me and i in
[1:04:23] you
[1:04:24] that's a revelation saints that's
[1:04:26] something that that that differentiates
[1:04:29] you from the rest of the world you speak
[1:04:31] another language
[1:04:33] you speak a new language
[1:04:35] the bible becomes a new bible to you
[1:04:37] because of revelations 10 1-7 the mighty
[1:04:41] angel coming down placing you eternally
[1:04:44] into that that that supernatural
[1:04:47] dispensation
[1:04:49] everything now is a supernatural
[1:04:51] dispensation it's no longer under the
[1:04:54] seven church ages under the historical
[1:04:57] teachings this goes beyond that this is
[1:04:59] the joshua commission where god himself
[1:05:02] takes you into the capstone
[1:05:04] and starts to positionally place you in
[1:05:07] the word of god by revelation
[1:05:10] not by knowledge oh i'm going to go to
[1:05:12] the church i'm going to be the trustee
[1:05:14] because i'm smart in math
[1:05:18] are you that smart in math brother mike
[1:05:22] no god places by revelation
[1:05:26] god knows his own
[1:05:29] god
[1:05:30] recognizes his word from before the
[1:05:32] foundations of the world there was an
[1:05:34] attribute that was placed inside of you
[1:05:38] and me
[1:05:39] that must fulfill the purpose and the
[1:05:42] plan of god there's nothing that you can
[1:05:44] do to stop it when you come under this
[1:05:49] when you recognize that it's not a man
[1:05:52] preaching to you but it's the holy
[1:05:54] spirit
[1:05:55] the life of god speaking to the
[1:05:58] attributes of god
[1:06:00] the life there's life in
[1:06:03] the word
[1:06:09] those who recognize who they are
[1:06:12] took their position in the word
[1:06:14] and fulfilled their word read john
[1:06:16] chapter 14 when you get a chance
[1:06:19] where jesus is speaking he says that
[1:06:21] that jesus says
[1:06:24] you shall receive the comforter the holy
[1:06:26] ghost the spirit of truth whom the world
[1:06:29] shall not know but you shall know him
[1:06:32] what is it that you shall know
[1:06:36] what is it that that that that you will
[1:06:38] know
[1:06:39] the word
[1:06:41] you'll have the spirit of truth to
[1:06:43] recognize and discern the word
[1:06:46] but look the lord is obligated to his
[1:06:49] word not man's interpretation
[1:06:52] so many men will put their own
[1:06:53] interpretation on the word they'll quote
[1:06:55] the prophet they'll use the the quotes
[1:06:58] but they don't really have a revelation
[1:07:00] of what it is that the prophet was under
[1:07:03] what kind of inspiration the prophet was
[1:07:05] under and why he was saying it
[1:07:08] there's a big difference
[1:07:10] amen praise god
[1:07:12] hallelujah life is in the word
[1:07:16] blessed be the name of the lord god
[1:07:20] so
[1:07:21] let's go to the next slide now
[1:07:26] ii peter
[1:07:34] wherefore the rather brethren
[1:07:37] give diligence to make your calling and
[1:07:40] election sure
[1:07:42] for if you do these things ye shall
[1:07:46] never
[1:07:46] fail
[1:07:48] amen
[1:07:49] you know
[1:07:50] so many are trying to figure out
[1:07:54] everything that's going on around other
[1:07:57] people's lives
[1:07:58] trying to interpret this and oh well you
[1:08:01] know this one here
[1:08:03] it's you know he's not and she's not
[1:08:05] coming to church because of this and
[1:08:07] because of that
[1:08:08] you know they did this or they did that
[1:08:12] this is not the hour to be
[1:08:15] trying to make sure other people's
[1:08:16] calling an election
[1:08:18] this is the time where we make sure of
[1:08:21] our calling
[1:08:22] our election
[1:08:24] our purpose
[1:08:25] and so we want to look at three things
[1:08:29] next slide
[1:08:30] that we need to do in order to fulfill
[1:08:33] our purpose
[1:08:35] the first thing you need to do
[1:08:37] is you need to find your position
[1:08:40] come into a self realization this is
[1:08:42] simple okay but i want you to catch here
[1:08:46] what the lord is actually trying to do
[1:08:48] here what do you why he is so mindful of
[1:08:50] each and every one of you
[1:08:53] because we got you know we get so
[1:08:55] distracted by the things of this life
[1:08:57] and if and if we don't get reminded
[1:08:59] about these simple things we can we can
[1:09:02] lose track and we can fall behind and we
[1:09:05] can miss so many blessings that the lord
[1:09:07] is trying to do in and through our lives
[1:09:10] and self-realization and
[1:09:12] self-identification
[1:09:13] is you recognizing who you are in the
[1:09:16] word
[1:09:17] you come to this church you know there's
[1:09:20] a lot of positions available in the
[1:09:22] church
[1:09:23] there's cleaning positions available
[1:09:26] there's ushering positions available
[1:09:29] god is looking to maybe add another
[1:09:31] deacon or add another few trustees
[1:09:35] amen
[1:09:36] god is looking to to to add to the
[1:09:39] church
[1:09:39] such as he requires
[1:09:42] and he's looking right within the body
[1:09:45] of christ he's not going to go call
[1:09:46] somebody you know that that that has the
[1:09:49] ability
[1:09:52] naturally he's looking for his word
[1:09:55] and then he's looking for that word to
[1:09:57] self-recognize self-realize you got to
[1:10:00] look at your own life you got to look at
[1:10:03] how god built you
[1:10:04] how he designed you
[1:10:06] i look back on my own life i see certain
[1:10:09] you know aspects of how the lord built
[1:10:11] me from when i was a kid
[1:10:13] how he designed my character how he
[1:10:16] designed my nature
[1:10:18] my my impulsive nature you know risk
[1:10:21] taking all of those things i realized
[1:10:23] that that you know it was because he was
[1:10:25] preparing me for this
[1:10:27] he was preparing us for this time and
[1:10:30] season he needed individuals that would
[1:10:33] fulfill his word
[1:10:35] and you know you look at the churches
[1:10:37] you know within the message and some
[1:10:39] churches you know the ones that i find
[1:10:41] interesting you know because you know
[1:10:42] sometimes you're you're listening in on
[1:10:44] other ministries and you're watching and
[1:10:46] you visit and you'll see that you know
[1:10:48] it you know a church it's got like two
[1:10:51] 300 people there
[1:10:54] but yet there's only a handful maybe one
[1:10:56] or two that you can really fellowship
[1:10:58] with
[1:10:59] around the world
[1:11:00] because you'll know within within two
[1:11:02] minutes of fellowshipping with somebody
[1:11:05] if the spirit of the holy ghost is
[1:11:07] moving in the midst of your fellowship
[1:11:10] he vindicates it himself
[1:11:13] then you look at these small churches
[1:11:14] sometimes you go in and there's you know
[1:11:16] 34. look at look at this church here in
[1:11:18] this church there's a half a dozen at
[1:11:20] least ministers
[1:11:24] able ministers able deacons able
[1:11:27] trustees able individuals right here
[1:11:29] within this little congregation of 100
[1:11:32] maybe 150 people whatever it is
[1:11:35] but god knows
[1:11:38] his own
[1:11:40] but he's looking to put you into your
[1:11:43] rightful positions
[1:11:46] in order to get into your rightful
[1:11:47] positions you need to come and examine
[1:11:51] yourself
[1:11:53] you know a lot of people
[1:11:56] they're not getting blessed financially
[1:11:58] and they're wondering why
[1:12:00] they're sitting still
[1:12:04] they're just surviving
[1:12:06] i'm just using that as an example
[1:12:08] then you look i want you to examine
[1:12:10] yourself are you a tight payer
[1:12:14] are you an individual that gives
[1:12:17] that has the revelation of giving
[1:12:22] because if you do
[1:12:24] then god is obligated to honor his word
[1:12:28] remember that one thing god will never
[1:12:31] ever not do
[1:12:33] is honor
[1:12:35] and vindicate his word
[1:12:38] remember that
[1:12:39] amen and so self-realization and
[1:12:41] self-examination needs to look at all
[1:12:44] these areas of our lives to see
[1:12:47] why certain things are not where they're
[1:12:50] supposed to be
[1:12:52] god can be bringing you to church sunday
[1:12:54] after sunday
[1:12:56] young and old
[1:12:59] sitting behind the pew listening in one
[1:13:02] ear out the other because you have not
[1:13:05] taken it's serious
[1:13:09] your calling in your election
[1:13:12] but god's waiting for you to hear
[1:13:14] to recognize and to find your position
[1:13:18] so that he can put you where he needs
[1:13:20] you
[1:13:23] so that you can edify the body remember
[1:13:25] we were saying that we need one another
[1:13:28] we bless
[1:13:30] encourage edify rub
[1:13:33] i can i could sit here and tell you
[1:13:35] experiences after experiences where i
[1:13:37] have had fellowship beyond
[1:13:41] comprehension the power of god the
[1:13:43] anointing of the holy ghost come into
[1:13:46] you know with brothers and and sisters
[1:13:49] anointed spiritual supernatural
[1:13:51] fellowship weeping and crying praying
[1:13:53] for four and five hours and i can tell
[1:13:55] you
[1:13:56] with the same individuals how i was
[1:13:58] ready to knock them out
[1:14:01] oh yeah
[1:14:04] you see you're still human
[1:14:06] you're still human
[1:14:09] but you got to recognize you have a
[1:14:11] position
[1:14:13] and when you mature and you grow into
[1:14:16] that position and you recognize who you
[1:14:18] are
[1:14:19] and then you start to recognize how
[1:14:21] important your brother and your sister
[1:14:24] is to you
[1:14:26] and how much of an effect they can have
[1:14:28] on you
[1:14:30] okay
[1:14:31] it's powerful saints of god
[1:14:34] remember you're human and you are a son
[1:14:37] of god the human side of you doesn't
[1:14:40] like it when a brother walks by you
[1:14:42] doesn't even look at you and pretends
[1:14:44] you don't even exist
[1:14:47] that human side of you
[1:14:49] looks and thinks
[1:14:51] all right
[1:14:53] well i'm going to keep praying
[1:14:55] that human side of you doesn't like it
[1:14:57] when when you get corrected by your
[1:15:00] deacon
[1:15:03] or by the pastor
[1:15:06] doesn't like it
[1:15:08] it gets
[1:15:09] you know
[1:15:10] pride starts kicking in
[1:15:13] pride is something that must die
[1:15:17] as a son or a daughter of god it is
[1:15:19] something that must die it must never be
[1:15:23] given the ability to speak to to to
[1:15:27] uh
[1:15:28] you know to like you'll know yourself
[1:15:31] you know this is all part of self
[1:15:33] identification and self realization
[1:15:36] simple things right but when when you
[1:15:38] start to dig in a little bit you start
[1:15:40] to realize that there's things my god
[1:15:43] that demon of pride it just rises up so
[1:15:45] often you know i gotta starve it out you
[1:15:47] know how you starve it out
[1:15:49] shut your mouth
[1:15:51] you don't need to give a comment you
[1:15:53] don't need if god is correcting you if
[1:15:55] somebody's correcting you whether it's
[1:15:57] right or wrong
[1:15:58] you wait you don't have to immediately
[1:16:01] blurb out and say well this is the way i
[1:16:03] see it and this and this and this and
[1:16:05] that you can actually sit back
[1:16:07] relax let it come let it be revealed
[1:16:11] take it to prayer and let the holy
[1:16:13] spirit give you the right time and
[1:16:15] season to deal with the situation
[1:16:18] often times we're too quick
[1:16:21] too quick you know this is all part of
[1:16:23] self-examination right we want to die we
[1:16:26] want to let the power of god move in our
[1:16:29] lives you know that the power of god can
[1:16:31] move in your life right at work amen
[1:16:34] right at work the spirit of god can move
[1:16:36] and and i've seen it happen
[1:16:38] i've seen it so many times it i walk and
[1:16:41] i just think oh lord thank you so much
[1:16:43] hallelujah i'm going my god you're so
[1:16:46] real i didn't have to do a thing he just
[1:16:48] dealt with it because he saw that i had
[1:16:51] the right mental attitude towards it
[1:16:54] i saw the weakness in the individual i
[1:16:57] saw them maybe hurt from
[1:17:00] previous experiences i saw things that
[1:17:02] that you know that scarred them in the
[1:17:04] past and then the holy spirit just went
[1:17:07] and dealt with it and moved on them and
[1:17:09] their their situation they don't even
[1:17:11] have to be sons and daughters of god
[1:17:12] don't think we're this is this is your
[1:17:14] boss
[1:17:15] this is somebody that has authority over
[1:17:17] you
[1:17:18] god can move and deal with their hearts
[1:17:20] and before you know it man they're there
[1:17:22] they're repenting to you and
[1:17:24] and all you're you're not sitting there
[1:17:26] see i told you i was right
[1:17:30] you got that kind of attitude you god's
[1:17:32] still working on you
[1:17:34] say oh brother man you know hey
[1:17:36] boss i really appreciate that and you
[1:17:38] know i appreciate everything that you're
[1:17:40] doing i know you're you're doing your
[1:17:43] best i know i know that you know you you
[1:17:44] got pressures like anybody else and you
[1:17:47] know i apologize that you know maybe i
[1:17:49] got you know a little bit you know out
[1:17:51] of out of myself and this and that and
[1:17:54] all of a sudden it's just like you've
[1:17:55] just built a brand new level of
[1:17:57] confidence
[1:17:59] and that's the way the lord works with
[1:18:00] you
[1:18:02] you can build confidence with the lord
[1:18:05] all of a sudden you can know the lord is
[1:18:06] going to stand behind you he's going to
[1:18:08] help you in that circumstance he's going
[1:18:10] to deal with that situation
[1:18:12] and then you know you look at the next
[1:18:14] thing
[1:18:16] it says holding your position
[1:18:19] you gotta you gotta be consistent
[1:18:22] never mind you get excited oh i'm gonna
[1:18:24] be there saturday i'm going to clean the
[1:18:26] church and then you don't see the person
[1:18:28] for the next two years
[1:18:32] like like
[1:18:33] you got to hold your position god's
[1:18:35] looking for that consistency god's
[1:18:37] looking for that for that that that that
[1:18:40] that passion
[1:18:41] you know to really serve the lord you're
[1:18:44] not
[1:18:45] listen we serve one another
[1:18:47] and it strengthens one another it helps
[1:18:50] one another you're building your brother
[1:18:52] or your sister you're edifying you're
[1:18:53] encouraging when you're doing those
[1:18:56] things and you're holding to your
[1:18:58] position
[1:18:59] when we see you know you standing like i
[1:19:02] look at you know brother
[1:19:04] eugene there he's vacuuming every week
[1:19:06] week in week out he takes up that vacuum
[1:19:09] and it's it's why he's holding to his
[1:19:11] position
[1:19:14] you know you think oh well
[1:19:15] that's a position in the word
[1:19:18] that is that is a powerful position in
[1:19:21] the word
[1:19:22] and i know god will bless that position
[1:19:25] god will meet those needs god will
[1:19:27] anoint in certain areas that god knows
[1:19:30] that the brother needs assistance and
[1:19:32] everything else it's not because he's
[1:19:34] doing it so god says you do this and
[1:19:36] i'll do that
[1:19:37] no
[1:19:38] you're automatically blessed
[1:19:41] you're listen you're gonna get the
[1:19:42] blessing regardless
[1:19:45] you're gonna get the blessing of the
[1:19:46] rapture regardless but some of us we're
[1:19:48] gonna we're it's gonna be a fight right
[1:19:50] to the end because you're fighting
[1:19:53] because your attitude because your
[1:19:55] mental attitude is is negative you know
[1:19:58] a negative attitude can never do
[1:20:01] anything good
[1:20:03] never do anything good if there's
[1:20:04] anything you want to try and do
[1:20:06] is
[1:20:07] turn your attitude from negative to
[1:20:09] positive
[1:20:10] all you got to do is look for the good
[1:20:12] instead of the bad
[1:20:15] you can look at the day today and say oh
[1:20:17] it's cloudy and it looks like it's going
[1:20:18] to rain
[1:20:19] or you can look at it and say oh the
[1:20:21] sun's out there and it's looking to
[1:20:23] break through those clouds and it's
[1:20:25] coming
[1:20:26] you see it's how you look at things it's
[1:20:28] how you perceive everything around you
[1:20:31] and if you've got a negative attitude
[1:20:35] it never does any good to the
[1:20:37] circumstances or the situation
[1:20:40] but throw a positive word throw a
[1:20:42] positive thought
[1:20:44] into that conversation into that
[1:20:46] situation
[1:20:47] prayer positive prayer whatever it is
[1:20:50] it'll turn it around it'll change the
[1:20:52] whole thing
[1:20:55] holding your position
[1:20:58] vision of your mission
[1:21:01] knowing that god is a purpose in placing
[1:21:04] you in the body of christ
[1:21:06] and the next thing
[1:21:09] maintaining your position so you hold
[1:21:12] and you maintain
[1:21:14] you keep with passion and perseverance
[1:21:18] you start to build on your own attitude
[1:21:21] by becoming more positive by becoming
[1:21:24] more uh uh you know uh
[1:21:27] lit you know like like a leader
[1:21:29] you're you're a leader you're a positive
[1:21:31] leader so whatever you do you're doing
[1:21:33] it in a positive way and you're
[1:21:35] maintaining that positive mental
[1:21:38] attitude that that positive direction
[1:21:41] where god can place you and use you
[1:21:44] in the body of christ
[1:21:48] let's go to the next slide
[1:21:51] so self-realization listen to brother
[1:21:53] branham here he says
[1:21:55] if the people get the true revelation
[1:21:58] of the true church and what she is what
[1:22:02] she stands for that she can do the
[1:22:05] greater works she will be an invincible
[1:22:10] army
[1:22:10] [Music]
[1:22:12] you see how powerful self-realization is
[1:22:15] how important it is
[1:22:17] for us to come into that
[1:22:19] because as a part of coming into
[1:22:22] self-realization
[1:22:24] comes
[1:22:26] self-empowerment
[1:22:28] by the holy spirit
[1:22:30] your position gets empowered by god
[1:22:33] you start to get an authority around
[1:22:35] your life like we were saying when you
[1:22:37] have that you go to work and you have
[1:22:39] that revelation
[1:22:40] your boss is your boss
[1:22:42] but god is his boss
[1:22:45] and you've got a revelation of that
[1:22:50] and so now
[1:22:52] you're different
[1:22:54] your life and everything around your
[1:22:56] life is influenced in a different way
[1:23:01] next slide
[1:23:04] catching the vision
[1:23:06] vision is the determination and the will
[1:23:09] to never give up
[1:23:12] see these are simple things
[1:23:14] but you know when you're at church
[1:23:16] sunday
[1:23:18] wednesday night comes along and
[1:23:20] you know that when you get into the
[1:23:21] house of the lord you get blessed
[1:23:24] and
[1:23:25] you gotta like you gotta i'm i'm going
[1:23:28] i'm gonna get there
[1:23:29] i'm i'm not gonna give up
[1:23:31] i know that when i get there i'm just
[1:23:33] using that as an example i'm not saying
[1:23:35] there's times when you can't get into
[1:23:37] the house of the lord you got to work
[1:23:38] you got situations whatever it is that's
[1:23:41] irrelevant but when you can be here
[1:23:45] you got to press through
[1:23:47] you've got to push through you've got to
[1:23:48] get there because
[1:23:50] remember we edify
[1:23:52] one another we need one another
[1:23:55] when i see my brothers and my sisters
[1:23:58] coming into church on wednesdays
[1:24:00] participating on the friday night prayer
[1:24:02] meetings it builds
[1:24:04] strength and faith in my life it edifies
[1:24:07] me it encourages me to keep doing it
[1:24:11] to keep pressing on to keep doing my
[1:24:13] part you know because they're doing
[1:24:15] theirs i feel motivated by them and it's
[1:24:17] not so much you're getting you are
[1:24:19] actually feeling the effects of the holy
[1:24:22] ghost coming off of their ministry
[1:24:25] when i see brother eugene vacuuming i
[1:24:28] get blessed
[1:24:29] i see the i see the the the body of
[1:24:32] christ i'm using you as an example i
[1:24:33] hope you don't mind
[1:24:35] but
[1:24:35] i see the body
[1:24:38] working i see you know the brothers in
[1:24:40] there brother coffee the sisters
[1:24:42] cleaning the washrooms all those things
[1:24:44] these are
[1:24:46] edifying
[1:24:48] parts of the body of christ they look
[1:24:50] simple to you and me but god is
[1:24:52] anointing them
[1:24:54] they are doing it and if they're not
[1:24:56] doing it by faith you will know it
[1:24:59] they'll be miserable
[1:25:02] you walk into the washroom by accident
[1:25:04] get out
[1:25:08] now that doesn't happen here
[1:25:11] but i'm saying when you're not doing
[1:25:13] something by faith
[1:25:15] then all of a sudden
[1:25:16] it's it's a you've got a different
[1:25:18] attitude you can tell when somebody is
[1:25:20] really
[1:25:21] blessed they're in their position
[1:25:23] they're doing it because of the love of
[1:25:24] god because they know that it's
[1:25:26] supernatural
[1:25:27] they know that this is not a man's
[1:25:29] calling oh brother coffee chose me to be
[1:25:32] in the cleaning crew he calls me to come
[1:25:35] and be in the cleaning crew i i should
[1:25:37] be up on the stage singing
[1:25:44] you know like like like
[1:25:46] if you truly
[1:25:48] want god's desire god's will even if
[1:25:51] brother coffee puts you into that
[1:25:53] cleaning position
[1:25:54] if the lord wants you here singing it
[1:25:56] won't be too long you'll be here
[1:25:59] because you are faithful in the simple
[1:26:02] things and the in the things where he
[1:26:04] placed you you were willing to humble
[1:26:06] yourself and and allow the spirit of god
[1:26:08] to give you and place you where he was
[1:26:11] going to test you
[1:26:14] you know it's like jesus
[1:26:15] when he we know like in in
[1:26:17] in john chapter 6 verse 65 to 70 you
[1:26:21] know
[1:26:22] no man comes to the lord except it were
[1:26:25] given him from the father
[1:26:28] if there's an attribute of god there
[1:26:31] they're going to come to jesus
[1:26:33] because they're being called they're
[1:26:35] being placed
[1:26:37] but what was it an attribute recognized
[1:26:40] the word for their day
[1:26:41] and then he turns around he looks to
[1:26:43] peter he says hey peter
[1:26:45] are you going to go too
[1:26:47] you know that was god testing peter
[1:26:50] but peter recognized no matter what no
[1:26:53] matter what the situation the
[1:26:55] circumstances
[1:26:56] no matter and he denied christ
[1:26:59] you know
[1:27:00] later on but yet he realized that he had
[1:27:04] the words of eternal life says where do
[1:27:06] i go
[1:27:07] and if you as a son or a daughter of god
[1:27:09] have come under this ministry you've
[1:27:11] never heard the word like this
[1:27:15] you're not going to go to church you
[1:27:16] know denominational church and hear the
[1:27:18] word coming forth in in in such a
[1:27:21] fashion where it just it's direct it's
[1:27:24] it's the holy spirit it's the power of
[1:27:25] god you know you're looking for the
[1:27:27] supernatural you're you're constantly
[1:27:29] listening for the supernatural watching
[1:27:32] and if you have come into that kind of a
[1:27:34] relationship with the lord you will not
[1:27:36] mind him putting you anywhere
[1:27:40] because if you have been designed in
[1:27:43] such a way to be up here to sing then he
[1:27:46] will eventually
[1:27:48] place you there
[1:27:50] because he saw from the beginning
[1:27:52] exactly what you were going to fulfill
[1:27:57] amen praise god
[1:27:59] proverbs 29 18 where there is no vision
[1:28:02] the people perish
[1:28:04] but he that keepeth the law happy is he
[1:28:08] you see you got a vision of the body you
[1:28:10] got a vision of the ministry you got a
[1:28:12] vision of your pastor you know that he's
[1:28:15] your pastor you know that he's he's the
[1:28:17] one that's going to speak to you guide
[1:28:19] you bring the word of god be the angel
[1:28:21] to the church then you know that you've
[1:28:23] got a god anointed deacon that's leading
[1:28:26] you and directing you you've caught the
[1:28:29] vision that god has
[1:28:31] get placed you under a holy ghost led
[1:28:35] holy ghost-led ministry remember
[1:28:38] the holy ghost
[1:28:40] is the president
[1:28:42] of this ministry
[1:28:45] god
[1:28:46] has the ultimate say
[1:28:49] none of us
[1:28:51] god
[1:28:52] but he gives it in his
[1:28:54] provided way and authorities and brings
[1:28:58] it down he's not the author of confusion
[1:29:00] so when you're listening and you want to
[1:29:03] hear from the yerma thundum and you've
[1:29:05] got faith in your pastor that he can
[1:29:08] speak your need and meet your needs
[1:29:10] through the word that's being preached
[1:29:12] if you came here this morning and you
[1:29:14] had certain things on your heart and it
[1:29:16] was genuine it was it was sincere i know
[1:29:20] god will speak to you
[1:29:21] i know he's already spoken to you if you
[1:29:24] came with that type of attitude and
[1:29:26] you're trusting god
[1:29:28] and so that's the way the holy spirit is
[1:29:30] gonna govern and operate and build this
[1:29:33] church
[1:29:34] each and every one of us being
[1:29:36] positionally placed and when that vision
[1:29:39] is clear to you you're going to be a
[1:29:41] happy
[1:29:43] member
[1:29:46] next slide
[1:29:48] igniting your passion
[1:29:51] these are simple things
[1:29:53] but it's important
[1:29:55] you know the word will ignite your
[1:29:57] passion you know how you get the word to
[1:29:58] ignite your passion
[1:30:00] by
[1:30:01] submitting to the word
[1:30:03] humbling yourself to the word allowing
[1:30:06] the spirit of god to place you
[1:30:08] and and do the things that he wants to
[1:30:10] do in your life
[1:30:12] passion is a powerful compelling desire
[1:30:16] to serve the lord that's not something
[1:30:18] you can make up brother tim

[1:30:24] when when the spirit of god is moving

[1:30:39] my god the passion that burns up inside
[1:30:42] of you it just starts stirring up inside
[1:30:44] of you because you know that's god
[1:30:46] speaking to you there's no way he could
[1:30:48] have known that he he's speaking by
[1:30:50] revelation he's speaking exactly what i
[1:30:52] had need of
[1:30:54] and you know what that does that that
[1:30:56] gives you a passion and a desire to
[1:30:58] serve the lord

[1:31:02] house of the lord unprepared

[1:32:59] do it heartedly
[1:33:02] as to the lord not unto men you see how
[1:33:05] powerful you see what the word is
[1:33:07] telling us we don't sir like that's one
[1:33:09] thing my god
[1:33:11] right from when i came into this message
[1:33:14] you asked pastor simon i was going to
[1:33:16] him and i was saying brother
[1:33:18] you know there there's i i just want to
[1:33:20] you know do this and and serve the lord
[1:33:22] and and there's these things in my life
[1:33:24] that i gotta get rid of and i'm just
[1:33:26] gonna i'm just gonna do it that's it i'm
[1:33:27] gonna get rid of this i'm gonna get
[1:33:28] right he says whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
[1:33:30] whoa settle down
[1:33:32] thank god i had a pastor that had wisdom
[1:33:36] and knew exactly that god he's the
[1:33:39] author and he's the finisher
[1:33:41] he starts the work and word
[1:33:44] upon word
[1:33:46] you heard the quote upon word
[1:33:48] upon word and before you know it god is
[1:33:50] going to have you exactly where he wants
[1:33:52] you to be
[1:33:54] you know one of the you know god
[1:33:57] supernaturally he delivered me from an
[1:33:59] addiction from from from drugs a very
[1:34:02] powerful drug of cocaine that
[1:34:05] was a miracle
[1:34:07] you understand that was a miracle that
[1:34:10] god knew he had to do that to catch my
[1:34:12] attention
[1:34:14] because that was it wasn't brother
[1:34:16] branham that caught my attention
[1:34:19] it was it was that that that that
[1:34:22] gentleman right there
[1:34:24] five foot seven
[1:34:28] well you look that tall
[1:34:31] [Applause]
[1:34:33] and it wasn't even him
[1:34:36] but god was speaking through those lips
[1:34:39] the night that i came into that little
[1:34:40] white church and was talking about that
[1:34:42] prostitute at the well and the life that
[1:34:45] she was living and everything and and
[1:34:47] god was speaking lip to ear i could hear
[1:34:50] the voice of god i was trying to hide my
[1:34:53] tears
[1:34:54] gabriel sitting next to me there i was
[1:34:56] going oh my god he's going to think i'm
[1:34:57] a wussy
[1:35:00] but that's the power of god that's what
[1:35:03] god wanted to do that was god
[1:35:06] calling
[1:35:08] and placing
[1:35:09] in a certain time in season and you can
[1:35:11] look back on your own life god knows
[1:35:14] when he needs to do miracles and then
[1:35:16] god knows that little by little shall i
[1:35:19] deliver them
[1:35:22] [Applause]
[1:35:23] it's just god's ways
[1:35:25] we don't need to try to figure him out
[1:35:28] but but once that supernatural element
[1:35:30] and communication comes between you and
[1:35:33] the word
[1:35:35] you can never be the same
[1:35:37] you'll never be the same person you will
[1:35:39] you will be different
[1:35:41] people will know that you are different
[1:35:42] you just need to be in their presence
[1:35:45] and they know there's something
[1:35:46] different about you
[1:35:48] why because of his presence
[1:35:51] it's not something you did it's not
[1:35:53] something you deserve it's not something
[1:35:55] that oh well i worked it up no
[1:35:58] but when you become mature and you come
[1:36:00] into this this time of your life and
[1:36:03] this time in season to walk with god and
[1:36:05] he's and he's saying to you i'm calling
[1:36:08] you to take your position is because
[1:36:11] in that body
[1:36:13] it's going in a rapture
[1:36:15] and he needs each and every one of us to
[1:36:17] be positionally placed in that body so
[1:36:21] that he can lift it off the earth
[1:36:24] you see and your position might just be
[1:36:27] in the church
[1:36:28] vacuuming
[1:36:30] but on that day right around 9 00 am
[1:36:32] when that love sweep comes down
[1:36:36] i don't care what you're going to be
[1:36:37] doing
[1:36:38] wherever you are you're going to feel
[1:36:40] the power and the anointing and the
[1:36:42] presence of god and in a moment and in a
[1:36:45] twinkling of an eye you are going to be
[1:36:47] changed and right there and then you're
[1:36:49] going to be
[1:36:50] brother sister
[1:36:52] hallelujah it's just it's going to
[1:36:54] happen that quick but it's already in
[1:36:56] progress like we heard pastor simon
[1:36:58] saying the rapture
[1:37:00] is already in progress
[1:37:02] when we actually leave here it will be
[1:37:05] finished
[1:37:06] hallelujah you know everything has
[1:37:09] preparation everything is and and we've
[1:37:12] already been pulled out of the world
[1:37:14] we've already been called out of the
[1:37:16] world
[1:37:18] glory to god amen
[1:37:20] let's look at the next slide finding
[1:37:22] your position step one ephesians chapter
[1:37:25] one
[1:37:27] we're going to close here in like 10
[1:37:29] minutes
[1:37:30] according
[1:37:31] as he has chosen us in him before the
[1:37:35] foundation of the world that we should
[1:37:38] be holy and without blame
[1:37:41] before him in love
[1:37:43] having predestinated us unto the
[1:37:46] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[1:37:50] himself
[1:37:51] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:37:54] will
[1:37:55] and to the praise
[1:37:56] of the glory of his grace
[1:38:00] aren't you thankful that that that god
[1:38:04] saw you
[1:38:05] and what and has a position for you
[1:38:08] that he
[1:38:10] listen
[1:38:12] the word
[1:38:13] was from the beginning
[1:38:15] and you were in him
[1:38:18] in the beginning
[1:38:20] when he condescended down
[1:38:23] and it wasn't abraham
[1:38:25] that was him
[1:38:26] in abraham
[1:38:28] expressing himself
[1:38:30] as the father of nations
[1:38:34] when he went down into joseph that was
[1:38:36] him
[1:38:37] expressing himself
[1:38:38] as jesus christ going to the cross and
[1:38:41] then being seated at the right hand of
[1:38:43] the father it was always him
[1:38:45] when he was there in joseph you were
[1:38:49] there
[1:38:49] [Music]
[1:38:51] you were there
[1:38:53] a portion of you was in joseph
[1:38:56] right because he was the word and you
[1:38:58] are in christ
[1:39:01] so you were represented there all the
[1:39:03] time
[1:39:04] but yet it wasn't your time in season to
[1:39:07] be manifest
[1:39:09] it was joseph's time in season to
[1:39:12] manifest the word
[1:39:14] it's always been the word the whole
[1:39:16] entire bible is jesus christ the same
[1:39:19] yesterday today and forever
[1:39:22] everything was in the mind of god before
[1:39:26] before we were in his mind before we
[1:39:29] became word bible
[1:39:30] written word
[1:39:32] but you have a position in the word
[1:39:35] when he went down through joseph
[1:39:38] went down through all of the other
[1:39:40] patriarchs came down through malachi
[1:39:42] came down into uh elijah john the
[1:39:46] baptist when he was fulfilling all those
[1:39:48] and when jesus came to the earth you
[1:39:51] were in him
[1:39:53] you were the word in him but it was not
[1:39:55] your season yet
[1:39:57] to express your part in the word it was
[1:40:01] his time his season
[1:40:03] but he was showing
[1:40:05] how he was going to express himself in
[1:40:07] this day
[1:40:08] because everything was a type and a
[1:40:10] shadow of exactly what he was going to
[1:40:12] do when he would come into your time in
[1:40:15] your season as the bride
[1:40:17] the church
[1:40:19] the woman that's going to express jesus
[1:40:21] christ
[1:40:22] when he went to the cross and he pinned
[1:40:25] himself to the cross you were justified
[1:40:28] the same moment
[1:40:30] that he died
[1:40:34] he was wounded for our transgressions
[1:40:38] by his stripes we are
[1:40:41] healed
[1:40:42] you see it's you you need to know who
[1:40:44] you are
[1:40:45] you need to know your the authority that
[1:40:47] you've been given as a son or a daughter
[1:40:49] of god in this day
[1:40:52] everything that you were justified
[1:40:54] already back there
[1:40:56] we're going to be looking at some other
[1:40:58] things here on wednesday night
[1:41:00] but
[1:41:01] you're already justified
[1:41:04] you're sitting there and you know oh
[1:41:05] brother i gotta find my position i don't
[1:41:07] know what my position is you know i'm
[1:41:09] still dealing with this little thing in
[1:41:11] my life i'm still dealing with this
[1:41:12] little condemnation god's attribute
[1:41:15] cannot sin
[1:41:19] the word that is in you that is god
[1:41:22] cannot sin
[1:41:24] he saw beyond that he already saw beyond
[1:41:27] that so why are you condemning yourself
[1:41:31] come to the self-realization
[1:41:34] get up and get into your position
[1:41:37] god will do the rest
[1:41:40] everything that you have need of was
[1:41:42] already in the attribute of god
[1:41:45] you're trying to be something you know
[1:41:47] like you it's like when you talk to
[1:41:48] people and they say oh you know danny i
[1:41:50] know you go to church you know that's so
[1:41:52] good you know i wish i could go to
[1:41:54] church but i got a lot of things that i
[1:41:56] got to get rid of first before i go to
[1:41:57] church
[1:41:58] they got it backwards
[1:42:01] they got it completely backwards i tell
[1:42:03] them i said whoa whoa wait
[1:42:05] you need to come and hear the word of
[1:42:07] god
[1:42:08] and when you hear the word of god
[1:42:10] you're going to hear truth
[1:42:12] and the scripture says truth sets you
[1:42:14] free
[1:42:15] you need you need something more
[1:42:17] powerful than your own ability because
[1:42:19] i'm sorry to tell you but
[1:42:20] you keep doing what you're doing you're
[1:42:22] going to keep getting what you got
[1:42:24] you need to change what you're doing
[1:42:27] you know i used to hear it all the time
[1:42:28] one person said it to me one time
[1:42:30] he says
[1:42:32] you do what you got to do when you got
[1:42:33] to do it the day's going to come that
[1:42:35] you can do what you want to do when you
[1:42:37] want to do it
[1:42:39] and you know i come to realize that
[1:42:40] without the holy ghost
[1:42:42] that can become satanic
[1:42:45] with the wrong because men become
[1:42:47] prideful when they get too much money
[1:42:49] when they get you know too much
[1:42:50] popularity you know it just it just
[1:42:53] satan's
[1:42:54] loves that
[1:42:55] he loves to watch people that are
[1:42:58] starting to raise up popularity money
[1:43:00] this and that he he's just waiting for
[1:43:02] that individual he wants to be right
[1:43:04] there and he wants to infect them he
[1:43:07] wants to get them perverted he wants to
[1:43:09] get him from going from one wife to
[1:43:11] three wives he wants to you know use
[1:43:14] their money to to do all the wrong
[1:43:16] things
[1:43:17] you see but not god
[1:43:19] when god gets into your life
[1:43:22] and he desires you'll fight those things
[1:43:24] don't get me wrong
[1:43:26] you will have to deal with
[1:43:28] with with what comes with human
[1:43:30] popularity and human financial
[1:43:33] uh uh prosperity and all those things
[1:43:36] you'll get tested in all those things
[1:43:39] but greater is he that is in you
[1:43:43] greater is he that is in you
[1:43:46] when you become conscious of god in your
[1:43:49] life
[1:43:49] let the musicians come
[1:43:51] when you become so conscious of god in
[1:43:53] your life
[1:43:54] the things that you are doing
[1:43:56] that you know god is watching
[1:43:59] you know god can see god knows you god
[1:44:01] knows your situation
[1:44:03] but he sees you through the blood he
[1:44:06] sees you through the blood
[1:44:08] isn't that something miraculous
[1:44:11] that's that's the paradox saints one
[1:44:14] minute you're so condemned the next
[1:44:15] minute you're so blessed
[1:44:17] you can't figure out why but god's grace
[1:44:20] in your life
[1:44:22] because he wants to use you
[1:44:24] he wants to fulfill remember he wants to
[1:44:26] fulfill
[1:44:27] his word
[1:44:29] in you
[1:44:30] that's the whole purpose
[1:44:32] of the word coming to you
[1:44:36] the world is full of darkness
[1:44:39] but arise for thy light
[1:44:42] has come
