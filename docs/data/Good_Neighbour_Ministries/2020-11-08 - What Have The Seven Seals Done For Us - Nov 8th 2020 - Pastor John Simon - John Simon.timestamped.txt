[40:12] amen when you see the devil fighting you
[40:15] have to praise god
[40:17] because you know god is up to something
[40:20] big
[40:21] is that right so let's put our trust in
[40:24] him
[40:24] amos chapter 3 verse
[40:28] 8 the lion has
[40:32] roared who will not fear
[40:38] the lord god has spoken
[40:42] who can but prophesy i've been to africa
[40:46] and if you've been there
[40:47] and you ever heard a lion roar
[40:50] you better be fearful especially if
[40:54] you're out in the wild
[40:55] because you're not in the zoo now out of
[40:59] the
[40:59] bus or or something like that a real
[41:03] lion
[41:04] could come out and they are not joking
[41:08] around they'll just
[41:09] cheer you to pieces so when
[41:12] a lion's voice is hypnotic so when
[41:14] they're roar
[41:15] it gives you have a general idea of
[41:18] where the sound is coming from but you
[41:20] really
[41:21] don't know where they are and it causes
[41:24] the animals to go
[41:25] a while and they run and sometimes
[41:27] they're running
[41:28] right into the to the dinner table of
[41:31] that line
[41:33] so a lion has roared
[41:36] who will not fear the lord
[41:39] god has spoken who can but prophesy
[41:43] preach declare the word of god
[41:46] revelation chapter 6 verse 1.
[41:58] thank god we have a witness because
[42:01] john said
[42:05] and i saw when the
[42:08] lamb opened one of the seals
[42:13] and i heard as it were
[42:17] the noise of thunder one
[42:20] of the four beasts saying come
[42:24] and see let us pray
[42:27] our gracious god our heavenly father
[42:31] we ask your divine blessing
[42:34] on the breaking of the bread of life
[42:37] may the words written on the pages of
[42:40] this
[42:41] bible come to life
[42:45] give us light life and power
[42:48] give us divine understanding
[42:51] open the ears of our hearts
[42:54] and unstop our blinded eyes
[42:59] may our deaf ears hear the voice of
[43:03] god speaking in these last days
[43:07] as we commit ourselves to you
[43:10] in jesus name amen and amen
[43:15] the lord bless you please be seated our
[43:17] subject for today
[43:18] is what have the seals done
[43:22] for us
[43:28] you know
[43:31] it seems today like most people know
[43:35] about the seals
[43:38] and they may know uh
[43:41] you know they may have a general idea of
[43:45] what these seals uh do
[43:50] we want to talk about what have the
[43:53] seals really done for you
[43:55] it's not enough to talk about it and say
[43:58] the seals this and
[43:59] and the seven seals that and oh the
[44:02] thunders and i like it and whatever
[44:04] but what really have those seals done
[44:07] for us since the prophet of god
[44:12] opened up the word and this is the
[44:15] problem we face in the church and in the
[44:18] message that some people don't seem to
[44:22] know what the seals did for us
[44:25] they just have the general smattering
[44:28] knowledge of what the seals actually
[44:32] did for us
