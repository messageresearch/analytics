[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] good sunday morning
[0:15] to all of you what a joy to be here
[0:18] again
[0:20] in the house of the lord and
[0:23] while i'm at it let me
[0:26] mention to you that next
[0:30] sunday we will uh
[0:33] begin the service with a beautiful
[0:37] worship service before
[0:41] my sermon or speaking
[0:44] so please bear that in mind i believe it
[0:47] will be enjoyable
[0:49] it'll be wonderful and we'll all rejoice
[0:52] together
[0:53] god bless you what a pleasure now
[0:57] for today i would like to read
[1:01] out of the first book of the bible
[1:04] genesis reading
[1:08] from the word of god chapter
[1:12] 3 and i'm reading verses
[1:15] 1 to 4. now
[1:19] the serpent was more subtle
[1:22] than any beast of the field
[1:25] which the lord god had made
[1:29] and he said unto the woman
[1:32] yea had god said you shall not
[1:36] eat of every tree of the garden
[1:40] and the woman said unto the serpent
[1:43] we may eat of the fruit of the trees
[1:47] of the garden but of the fruit of the
[1:50] tree which is in the midst of
[1:54] the garden god hath said
[1:57] you shall not touch it
[2:00] neither shall ye touch it
[2:04] lest ye die
[2:07] and the serpent said unto the woman
[2:11] ye shall not surely die
[2:15] a gracious father be
[2:18] ask your blessing upon this
[2:21] service today as we
[2:25] send forth thy shining light
[2:29] and thy marvelous truth
[2:32] may the word of god living god
[2:36] be a discerner of the hearts and
[2:39] thoughts and minds of men
[2:43] we commit ourselves into your
[2:47] glorious gracious hands for
[2:50] service in your kingdom and to
[2:53] you be all the praise the honor
[2:57] and the glory for we ask it
[3:01] in the name of our lord jesus christ
[3:05] amen
[3:08] friends think of it
[3:12] no man
[3:16] wants his wife
[3:19] to just leave the home
[3:22] and go wandering
[3:26] around the streets
[3:29] where she may be picked up
[3:35] and so this subject i'm speaking on
[3:38] is not new but i'm taking
[3:42] a little bit of a different approach
[3:47] for here we see in the garden of eden
[3:53] the picture of adam
[3:59] god putting adam
[4:02] his son into a deep sleep
[4:06] and the bible says out of his side
[4:10] god took a rib
[4:14] and there he made woman
[4:17] now understand clearly adam was a
[4:22] cr spoken word creation of god
[4:27] he was created by
[4:30] god's spoken word
[4:34] eve came out
[4:37] from his side which means that she was a
[4:40] part of him
[4:42] which tells us that she was
[4:46] of this very same material
[4:49] that he was made of
[4:52] which of course is a perfect type of
[4:55] christ
[4:56] and his bride because he
[5:00] the lord jesus christ being the word
[5:04] out of him comes to church comes the
[5:07] bride
[5:08] the bride will then be
[5:12] have to be the genuine
[5:15] word of god for if
[5:18] he is the word and she came out of him
[5:22] the church also must be
[5:25] out of the word so let's go back now
[5:29] how then can the true
[5:32] bride or the true church
[5:36] you know dissimulate analyze
[5:39] debate over the word of god
[5:43] when she should be the reflection
[5:47] of that very word because she
[5:51] comes from the word she comes from the
[5:54] word
[5:55] and she is part of the word
[5:58] if she is the true church if she
[6:01] is the genuine bright class of
[6:04] saints redeemed by the mighty hand of
[6:08] god
[6:10] then she would be of the same identical
[6:14] material as he
[6:18] yes now adam being a
[6:22] man after they sinned
[6:25] he died but this second adam
[6:30] is a quickening spirit he is the eternal
[6:34] one living in human flesh
[6:38] therefore if the genuine bride is
[6:42] comes from him from his side for as
[6:45] adam uh had to sleep and his
[6:49] wife was taken from his side even so the
[6:52] bible tells us isaiah 53
[6:54] that jehovah struck him
[6:58] and jesus died out of his
[7:01] side came blood and water
[7:04] with his own blood he bought her and for
[7:07] her life he died oh thanks be to god
[7:11] that he paid the redemption price to
[7:13] redeem the genuine true church of the
[7:16] living god
[7:17] so we see adam in type did
[7:21] exactly and eve did exactly
[7:24] what happened later on in the new
[7:28] testament
[7:29] when jesus died and she
[7:32] the bride was taken from his side
[7:36] now the distinction that i'm making now
[7:40] is that adam being mortal
[7:43] died but this second adam being immortal
[7:48] being eternal then it must follow
[7:51] that his bride is of the same
[7:55] eternal material of which
[7:58] he was he has made so she is of the same
[8:02] class of being as he is
[8:06] oh thanks be the god saints
[8:10] that the gift of god is eternal life
[8:13] through jesus christ our lord i
[8:16] want to thank god for that eternal life
[8:20] that dwells in our hearts by faith if we
[8:24] are true believers
[8:27] now here is the picture adam and eve
[8:32] according to genesis 3
[8:35] they're found in the garden oh
[8:38] enjoying the beautiful
[8:41] blissful atmosphere the sweet soft
[8:46] zephyrs the the smells
[8:49] of the perfume of the flowers
[8:53] in the air the peaceful atmosphere
[8:57] of the lions of the lambs of the
[9:01] other animals that were there
[9:05] undisturbed and what a
[9:08] peaceful wonderful time they
[9:11] were enjoying yes
[9:15] they were enjoying first of all
[9:18] fellowship with god
[9:21] and that's the first thing that we
[9:24] must bring ourselves to that we
[9:27] must keep in continuous fellowship
[9:30] with the eternal god we must have
[9:34] always our telephone line to glory
[9:37] always talking with god and having
[9:41] supernatural communication and divine
[9:44] inspiration
[9:45] striking our souls and so they had
[9:49] fellowship consistently with god
[9:52] as the bible tells us here in genesis
[9:57] that the lord will come down
[10:00] in the evening time in the cool of the
[10:02] day and god
[10:04] would talk with his son and his daughter
[10:08] and together oh what fellowship the vine
[10:12] they had together walking and
[10:15] talking with god in this idyllic egyptic
[10:20] situation in which god had placed them
[10:24] in this fellowship that they had with
[10:27] god
[10:29] they also were enjoying their
[10:33] marriage bliss for
[10:36] it was not good
[10:39] for a man to be alone
[10:43] and god provided him
[10:47] with a beautiful wonderful
[10:50] wife that was in harmony
[10:54] with him they walked together
[10:59] in this marvelous marriage blessed
[11:03] and this marvelous joy
[11:06] that they care together
[11:10] they also walk in
[11:13] this mutual joy of companionship
[11:18] for not only is the husband a husband to
[11:22] his wife
[11:24] but he also ought to be a a
[11:28] friend a companion
[11:31] someone to talk to someone to care
[11:35] someone to share someone to
[11:38] be able to take you know any
[11:41] observation anything on your thoughts
[11:44] that
[11:44] we could share one with the other
[11:48] and there were in this marvelous tape
[11:51] of enjoyment of companionship
[11:56] these two walking hand in hand
[12:00] i can see the glow of joy
[12:04] and the peace upon their
[12:07] faces there they were in the presence of
[12:11] god
[12:13] these two always walk together
[12:18] for they were in agreement
[12:22] my friends so must the
[12:25] church walk together with god consist
[12:29] consistently for this is the state
[12:33] of oneness this is the invisible
[12:37] union of the bride of christ
[12:41] this is the state we must always be
[12:44] in in consistent
[12:48] fellowship with god
[12:51] hallelujah praise his wonderful name
[12:55] but one day eve decided
[13:00] that she was going to take a walk
[13:04] all by herself that
[13:07] she wanted to walk alone
[13:10] and so as my topic being
[13:14] god's wandering church she
[13:18] wandered away from her husband adam
[13:23] and there in the garden
[13:27] she became a target for deception
[13:32] because the serpent accosted her
[13:37] and the bible tells us
[13:40] that uh he turned up on the scene
[13:44] knowing that adam was not around
[13:49] you see friends the church
[13:52] the true church must stay with the word
[13:57] she must not wander away
[14:01] or off the word but to stay
[14:04] with the world at all times for the word
[14:08] of
[14:08] god is her protection the
[14:11] word of god is her leadership and her
[14:15] guide
[14:16] so the church uh must be in that state
[14:20] at all times trusting him
[14:23] and his leadership by his holy spirit
[14:27] and his grace and stay in a state
[14:30] of being in love with him
[14:33] jesus christ the word of god for the
[14:37] hour and so praise god
[14:41] hallelujah when she wandered away
[14:45] from her husband is just as
[14:48] much as the husband to the true church
[14:51] is the word of god my friends
[14:55] if you are not married to the word
[15:00] if you do not have a relationship with
[15:04] the world
[15:05] then come to christ come to the god of
[15:09] heaven
[15:10] and ask him tell tell
[15:13] him that you give him your heart
[15:16] oh praise god so you may have a
[15:19] relationship
[15:21] i'll walk with him talk with him
[15:25] a harmony a great fellowship
[15:30] continuous fellowship of joy
[15:33] a continuous state of bliss
[15:36] and the peace that passeth all men's
[15:39] understanding
[15:41] oh glory be to his marvelous name
[15:45] and so as i've said she
[15:48] met the serpent i will not dwell
[15:53] on who he was break down his personality
[15:57] his suspicion
[16:00] his cruelty but i will at this point
[16:05] deal with the fact that he approached
[16:09] her
[16:10] in genesis 3 and he said
[16:15] it wasn't her that spoke to him
[16:20] but he approached her as the devil
[16:23] will always approach the church
[16:26] and he said yes has god said in other
[16:30] words
[16:31] i agree with you that god
[16:35] said you shall not eat
[16:39] of every tree in the garden
[16:44] amen had god said
[16:47] you shall not eat of
[16:50] every tree in the garden
[16:53] and the bible tells us clearly
[16:56] here from we can see that
[17:00] satan was
[17:04] a a seed of discrepancy that he was
[17:07] planting
[17:09] for he was the second preacher
[17:12] in the bible he was a counterfeit
[17:16] preacher for god
[17:18] came down and had his services had his
[17:21] little
[17:22] church with his son and his daughter
[17:26] and would speak and preach peace to
[17:29] their heart
[17:30] but here comes this counterfeit
[17:33] devil this preacher
[17:37] that was a copycat of what god was doing
[17:42] and began to preach to her
[17:47] and he preached by asking a question
[17:50] which in most cases engenders doubt
[17:54] or speaks of doubt or
[17:58] misunderstanding or ignorance
[18:01] within the mind now remember
[18:06] he preached from the word of god
[18:10] for he quoted the word of god he said
[18:14] had god
[18:15] said you shall not
[18:18] eat of the trees that of the garden
[18:22] he was a preacher and he was preaching
[18:26] out of this same bible matter of fact
[18:29] if he were here today
[18:33] he would be preaching and quoting
[18:37] right out of this very bible
[18:41] and preaching the from god's word
[18:45] see amen listen
[18:49] he also prophesied
[18:52] yes he prophesied for he said
[18:56] you shall not surely die
[19:00] now that's a prophecy
[19:04] and the fact they did die
[19:08] which means that he was a false prophet
[19:13] he was contrary to god's word
[19:16] he was actually
[19:19] under the guise of a religious question
[19:24] was undermining her
[19:27] faith in the infallible
[19:31] word of god and so is it today with
[19:35] strifes and debates
[19:37] and analytics and all manner of
[19:40] questions that are engendered and strife
[19:44] that's being engendered it's nothing
[19:47] but the work of satan
[19:50] trying to undermine the word of god
[19:55] the foundations of the kingdom
[19:58] of the living god oh
[20:01] praise god hallelujah and so
[20:06] the very serpent
[20:10] deceived her and there we see it clearly
[20:14] frame
[20:16] that he told her lie
[20:21] and the lie was that
[20:24] he said to her
[20:27] god lied to you
[20:31] by telling you that if you
[20:35] eat you are going to die
[20:39] but i can tell you
[20:42] you shall not surely die
[20:46] so he actually deceived her
[20:50] by telling her that the word of
[20:54] from god was a lie
[20:57] my friends is the same lie being told in
[21:00] these last days
[21:02] to the modern day church that there
[21:05] are faults in the word of god there are
[21:08] mistakes in the word of god
[21:10] the word is god is not true in
[21:13] every area there are parts of it maybe
[21:17] you cannot rely on the devil will say
[21:20] and he is still a liar and a
[21:23] father life oh my
[21:27] think of it friend here they were
[21:30] one in one harmony together
[21:34] in that marvelous garden
[21:37] and the harmony they had
[21:40] was broken the harmony between
[21:44] the true church and the living god
[21:47] became broken because she
[21:50] wandered away from the word of god
[21:54] going into vain philosophy psychology
[21:58] going into theories of man going into
[22:01] all kinds of uh thoughts of man
[22:04] theologies of
[22:05] man and once she begins to do that
[22:09] she has wondered a away from the word of
[22:12] god
[22:14] as a wanton woman will wander away
[22:19] wander the streets away from her husband
[22:22] back
[22:22] to the word church back to the original
[22:26] husband jesus christ the same
[22:29] yesterday today and forever
[22:33] and now because she wandered away
[22:37] from our husband the word of god
[22:40] the church was deceived
[22:44] eve was the seed a type
[22:47] of the church being deceived by satan
[22:52] satan said see seduced her
[22:55] by his worldliness by his
[22:59] fleshliness carnality
[23:03] blindness his evil
[23:06] spirit his character
[23:09] which was evil to its very
[23:13] core and so here was eve
[23:18] being persuaded by
[23:23] the very uh
[23:26] success deceived
[23:31] that she could live on and
[23:34] enjoy a wonderful wanton life
[23:39] but my friends that god doesn't play
[23:43] games with his word he says i the lord
[23:46] thy
[23:47] god i'm a jealous god
[23:50] and so here is the church of this modern
[23:54] age
[23:55] seeking success in every aspect
[23:59] in a search for money
[24:02] in a search for popularity
[24:06] in a search for political power
[24:11] now if we read from matthew chapter
[24:14] 4 we find
[24:18] this is about the temptation of our lord
[24:21] jesus christ
[24:23] he is being tempted by the devil
[24:26] and the last temptation
[24:30] i believe maybe that'll be the last one
[24:32] for the church also
[24:34] the temptation of being drawn into
[24:37] political power
[24:39] and uh the narcotic
[24:42] of an addiction and the pride and pop
[24:47] and popularity that goes along
[24:51] with a political power
[24:55] the bible reads as such and again
[24:58] the devil taketh him up into an
[25:01] exceeding high mountain
[25:04] and showed him all the kingdoms of the
[25:08] world
[25:09] and the glory of them
[25:12] and said unto him all these
[25:16] things will i give thee
[25:19] if thou wilt fall down and
[25:23] worship me and jesus said
[25:27] get thee hands satan for it is written
[25:32] thou shalt worship the lord thy
[25:35] god and him only shalt thou sword
[25:39] now here was satan the
[25:42] god of this evil age who
[25:45] had the power over all the
[25:49] kingdoms of the earth and
[25:52] even offered them
[25:55] all of its political power
[25:59] over to jesus christ
[26:02] thinking that he will pers persuade him
[26:07] that he would be able to twist him away
[26:11] from the word but he failed to realize
[26:14] jesus was the word for in the beginning
[26:18] was the word and the word was with god
[26:20] and the
[26:21] word was god not first second third
[26:25] fourth
[26:25] fifth sixth but the word was god
[26:29] and that is why he answered satan saying
[26:33] not the lord thy god
[26:36] for he knew who he was
[26:40] and satan also knew who he was
[26:44] satan is not an atheist satan believes
[26:49] for the bible says the devil believes
[26:52] enough to
[26:53] tremble amen forget the name of jesus
[26:58] every knee shall bow and
[27:01] every tongue shall confess that
[27:05] jesus christ is lord
[27:08] amen so here it is my friend
[27:12] he turns to her and he said
[27:16] you shall not surely donnie
[27:21] this church tempted
[27:24] seduced by success popularity
[27:29] money political power
[27:32] this church is now being deceived
[27:37] saying you shall not
[27:41] surely die now notice
[27:45] he added one word
[27:48] to the genuine word of god
[27:51] now remember for a lie to be effective
[27:55] it cannot be a total complete lie
[27:59] like looking at a ball and telling
[28:02] someone it's a table that's an outright
[28:05] lie
[28:07] but you see a lie must have
[28:10] a tiny portion of truth in it
[28:15] so he quoted the word of god
[28:18] and wrapped up that around his line
[28:22] and fed it to her
[28:25] but in the words god's word was i'm not
[28:30] and here it is in revelation
[28:33] chapter 22 we can read
[28:38] for uh verse 18 for i testify
[28:42] unto every man that
[28:45] heareth the words of this prophecy
[28:48] of this book if any man
[28:52] shall add unto these things god
[28:55] shall add unto him the plagues that
[28:59] are written in this book and if
[29:02] any man shall take away from the words
[29:06] of this book prophecy
[29:09] god shall take away his part
[29:12] out of the book of life and
[29:16] out of the holy city and from the things
[29:20] which are written in this book
[29:25] so he added to the word of god
[29:29] one word leads to spiritual death
[29:34] where your name will be taken out of the
[29:37] book of life
[29:39] and condemnation sets in
[29:42] and so when the church begins to
[29:46] change god's unchangeable word
[29:49] when the church begins to allow herself
[29:53] to be persuaded
[29:55] to to to be uh enticed
[29:59] seduced by the devil with his enticing
[30:04] spirit anointing a
[30:08] lot of modern day preachers today that
[30:10] will
[30:11] not preach the truth will not preach
[30:14] even the fullness of the truth
[30:17] as i say they'll preach us a part of the
[30:20] truth
[30:20] enough the devil can take the rest and
[30:23] tell the biggest lie
[30:25] that he wishes to tell because they're
[30:28] only speaking part truth
[30:30] they'll leave out of hell they'll leave
[30:33] out sin
[30:35] they leave out the blood they'll leave
[30:37] out one god
[30:39] they'll leave up what really is the
[30:42] original sin
[30:43] was it eating an apple they won't tell
[30:46] you
[30:47] because it will upset their upper cart
[30:51] their meal ticket their position
[30:54] their popularity and their power
[30:58] it will take them out of that condition
[31:01] where they will have to stand with god
[31:04] alone
[31:06] and that is a terrifying thought to them
[31:10] to stand on their own in the presence of
[31:14] god
[31:15] think about it here it is friend
[31:19] that here the apostolic church
[31:23] founded in a pentecost
[31:27] with the presence of the living god
[31:30] hallelujah we find the apostolic church
[31:34] after john had died
[31:39] began to slowly wander away
[31:43] matter of fact the church had already
[31:45] began to slip
[31:47] and slide and wander even from the times
[31:51] of paul
[31:53] and paul made the observation
[31:56] that a grievous wolves
[32:02] have come amongst us brethren
[32:06] who are grievous wolf he
[32:09] recognized that there was a slipping
[32:12] the church was sliding the church was
[32:15] beginning to wonder
[32:18] some wandered back into legalism
[32:21] others like demons
[32:24] wandered away into worldliness
[32:27] demos has forsaken me heaven
[32:31] loved this present world
[32:34] and again some wandered into
[32:37] financial success and money for he said
[32:41] alexander the
[32:43] copper smith has done me much harm
[32:47] so there were people in the bible
[32:51] back there with the same attitude
[32:54] and the same spirit that were caught up
[32:57] with
[32:57] all of these endeavors and different
[33:00] things
[33:00] and wandering away slowly
[33:03] from the genuine unoriginal word of god
[33:08] listen i'm not here to keep anybody
[33:13] a true genuine son or daughter of god
[33:17] is kept by the word of god through their
[33:20] revelation of a true faith
[33:23] they are kept by the holy spirit
[33:26] he is your defense he is your leader he
[33:29] is your guide
[33:30] he is the one that protects for you
[33:33] provides for you
[33:34] he is the one that shows your love mercy
[33:37] and
[33:38] grace and in him we put our trust
[33:41] glory be to god hallelujah
[33:45] and so the apostolic church wandered
[33:48] away
[33:50] my friends into roman
[33:54] religious paganism
[33:57] disguise and presenting itself
[34:02] as christianity but
[34:05] it is paganism
[34:08] under the disguise of
[34:12] christianity and so the entire church
[34:15] world
[34:17] wandered away from the word of god
[34:22] we see in revelation chapter 2
[34:26] verse 5 the bible tells us
[34:30] remember therefore from whence the word
[34:33] fallen
[34:35] god is speaking to the church at ephesus
[34:38] and already the church had backslid
[34:43] already the church were falling away
[34:47] from the original truth
[34:50] foundational doctrine apostolic
[34:55] teaching that god had given to them
[34:59] and the spirit of god speaking to the
[35:03] church seven churches
[35:06] is saying to the ephesian church age
[35:10] remember therefore from whence the word
[35:14] fallen
[35:15] and repent and do the first work
[35:20] or else i will come unto thee quickly
[35:25] and i will remove your candlestick
[35:30] out of his place except
[35:35] so rip in oh
[35:38] my friend the entire
[35:41] church wandered away
[35:45] deceived by denominations
[35:50] into denominationalism
[35:53] and they're nervous for standing alone
[35:57] upon the word of god
[36:00] they have to have a headquarters
[36:04] they have to have some type of
[36:07] superintendent pope bishop uh
[36:11] archbishop someone
[36:14] above them directing controlling
[36:17] and directing things
[36:21] amen but so this apostolic church
[36:25] wandered away from god's word
[36:28] for they wandered away from the teaching
[36:31] of
[36:31] one god one name
[36:35] by which we are saved one baptism
[36:40] one lord one faith
[36:43] not three thousand denominations not
[36:46] three thousand
[36:47] faith not a pagan faith
[36:51] not a worldly faith but one
[36:54] faith one lord one baptism in jesus
[36:59] name one lord and one birth
[37:03] thanks be to god hallelujah remember he
[37:08] was saying to the ephesian church from
[37:10] whence you have fallen
[37:12] in other words remember how you fell
[37:15] from pentecost remember what happened in
[37:18] the upper room
[37:20] and you are falling away from that
[37:23] into a state of worthiness and carnality
[37:28] oh my here we find
[37:31] the modern church in the same
[37:35] falling away from the world from the
[37:38] word of god
[37:39] into worthiness and caught up
[37:43] with the glitter and glamour
[37:46] of the age with the gold
[37:50] and the glory and
[37:53] now we are finding the church in a state
[37:56] of denominational chaos
[38:00] the navy national conflict and
[38:03] constant confusion
[38:06] oh my god she wandered away
[38:10] from holding us into worldliness
[38:14] and from purity as adam and eve
[38:18] my friends fell from innocence
[38:22] into the age of conscience even so
[38:27] this modern church has fallen from her
[38:30] state
[38:32] of spiritual innocence
[38:35] of the apostolic time
[38:38] until today we must ask the question
[38:43] does this modern church have a
[38:45] conscience
[38:46] is the conscience of the church
[38:50] seared with the hot iron
[38:53] have the church lost its balance
[38:57] and have wandered away from the word of
[38:59] god
[39:01] lost her standards lost
[39:04] all her position she lost her
[39:07] shame oh may god
[39:11] have mercy on this modern day
[39:14] butch calling itself the true church
[39:17] of the living god and hiding under
[39:20] the guise of christianity
[39:24] yes sincere
[39:28] and heart sha that worship
[39:32] is no more what we are presented with
[39:36] is can the worship the worship is
[39:40] so can under the guise and lie of satan
[39:46] that by canning the washer we can keep
[39:49] it
[39:49] fresh for a long time but let me tell
[39:53] you
[39:53] god already called israel do you don't
[39:57] you store up
[39:58] any of the mana for the next day
[40:02] for it will rot never mind how beautiful
[40:07] it looks
[40:08] it will rot but trust me
[40:12] i will send you new
[40:15] manner for every day
[40:19] and we should trust god in our day
[40:23] that god will and has
[40:26] sent new manner for us today
[40:30] and we ought to receive god's word for
[40:33] this day
[40:34] and for this hour and recognize
[40:38] this is not modern day pentecost
[40:41] this is back to the word the original
[40:45] pentecost
[40:47] to preach what paul prays to preach what
[40:50] the apostles preach
[40:52] to preach what the prophets and the
[40:54] original men of god
[40:56] pray oh stand up church of the living
[41:00] god
[41:00] come out of your darkness and come to
[41:03] the light
[41:04] so christ can give you life amen
[41:08] now the church is filled
[41:12] with plastic christians
[41:15] filled with practice performances
[41:20] filled with entertainment
[41:24] like samson entertain the world
[41:28] the church is now having stadiums filled
[41:33] to entertain the world
[41:36] filled and invaded with business
[41:40] management
[41:44] and she has lost her position
[41:48] of supernatural enablement
[41:51] my friends instead of miracles
[41:55] and the movement of god for revival
[42:00] and salvation now she depends on
[42:04] marketing to be able to draw
[42:07] multitudes she depends
[42:11] on public relation
[42:15] and has none of the power
[42:19] that penteco the original pentecost of
[42:22] acts 2
[42:22] 4 had now she's trying to sing him down
[42:28] she tried to music him with drums and
[42:32] beautiful uh orchestras she's trying to
[42:36] draw him down like ahab's prophet
[42:40] oh my god but
[42:44] elijah did not need all of that
[42:47] all he needed was this
[42:51] simple clear word of god
[42:54] and he knew god was with him and
[42:58] when he prayed the fire of god
[43:02] fell upon the sacrifice for if there is
[43:05] no
[43:06] sacrifice then how will the fire fall
[43:10] it must be the right sacrifice and
[43:13] then the fire will vindicate it confirm
[43:16] it
[43:17] and seal the faith of god's servant
[43:21] and of his servants and of his people
[43:25] instead of them looking
[43:29] to be prospects of god
[43:32] that will prophesy and speak god's word
[43:35] regardless
[43:37] their eyes have been blinded like balaam
[43:41] and instead of prophets now they're
[43:43] after profits
[43:46] they're searching for profit they're
[43:49] looking for
[43:50] numbers they've gone into the numbers
[43:53] game
[43:55] they're looking after the average
[43:57] take-in
[43:58] how much did we bring in today
[44:02] how much did this meeting make
[44:06] did we profit or
[44:09] did we meet the amount we spent
[44:12] or are we underwater that is the modern
[44:16] thinking
[44:17] instead of those things are of
[44:21] nothing to a true servant of the living
[44:23] god
[44:24] for god will make our way somehow
[44:28] when beneath the cross we bow
[44:31] yes a life committed
[44:34] and consumed by service to the living
[44:38] god
[44:39] as john wesley said
[44:42] i'd rather to burn out for god
[44:46] than to be sitting on the shelf
[44:48] somewhere
[44:49] we must be in service for the king
[44:53] and always be about the king's
[44:57] business and so here friends
[45:02] we are now confronted with men who call
[45:05] themselves preachers
[45:07] call themselves prophet
[45:10] but these are men and women
[45:15] who have never been to the desert
[45:18] they have never been taken by god to the
[45:21] mountain
[45:22] top experience of the holy spirit and
[45:25] the power of god
[45:27] they've never been to such a place
[45:31] instead of the call of god
[45:34] to go hungry to go
[45:38] sacrificial to god suffering
[45:43] to go into a state of crucifixion before
[45:46] a supernatural
[45:48] spiritual resurrection
[45:51] they know nothing about it and then
[45:54] instead of being called of god
[45:57] they're waiting to be called by the
[45:58] church
[46:00] called by the church but when god
[46:03] calls a man or calls a woman
[46:08] then he brings them in by his call
[46:12] into a supernatural born-again
[46:15] experience of the holy spirit
[46:19] and of course they recognize that they
[46:22] are not
[46:23] now being ordained that's just a
[46:28] a modern-day event
[46:31] witnessing to the world publicly
[46:35] that the individual was already ordained
[46:39] before the foundation of the world
[46:42] and it is now being recognized
[46:46] by his fellow brethren but true servants
[46:50] of god
[46:51] don't wait around for the last path
[46:55] part first but they wait for
[46:59] god's ordination god's called god's
[47:02] anointing god's presence
[47:04] god's leadership god's spirit confirming
[47:08] the word
[47:09] oh blessed be his name amen
[47:12] but what we find here friends
[47:15] that these wait to be called by the
[47:18] church
[47:19] to go to a seminary to have
[47:22] mans certification man's
[47:25] ordination to put on
[47:30] denominational blinders and to see the
[47:33] scriptures from the
[47:35] point of view that is only allowed by
[47:39] that particular denomination contrary to
[47:43] the word of the living god
[47:46] they see only what they want you to see
[47:50] in their theology
[47:52] and so you see that and you believe that
[47:57] and to wander out of those confines
[48:01] as many times to be kicked out
[48:05] to be expelled excluded
[48:09] put out of the fellowship and it's an
[48:12] awful shunning state
[48:15] for one to be in but true servants of
[48:19] god
[48:20] cares not about such things but they'll
[48:23] walk with god and god alone if necessary
[48:28] oh if you know the lord you
[48:31] need nobody else but to walk in
[48:34] fellowship with him
[48:36] and if there are others of the light
[48:40] precious faith
[48:41] you will find yourself walking hand
[48:45] in hand with god's little flock
[48:49] he is called out once by the grace of
[48:52] god
[48:54] hallelujah so we are not here for man's
[48:57] certification
[48:58] of man's ordination amen
[49:02] or to get a ba or a dd
[49:05] but to rest in the grace of god i'd
[49:08] rather to have
[49:09] god's original born-again experience and
[49:16] to be
[49:16] led by him into s supernatural
[49:20] spiritual adoption and divine
[49:24] recognition that you are
[49:27] a son or daughter of the living god
[49:32] god vindicating his word
[49:35] and testifying that you are his own
[49:41] oh praise god hallelujah
[49:44] the church which once had fellowship
[49:48] one with the other and with god
[49:52] the church the modern church has now
[49:54] become a battleship
[49:56] when the church should have been two
[49:58] fellows or more
[50:00] in one ship in fellowship
[50:03] that church has now become a battleship
[50:08] wars rumors of wars
[50:11] paul said wars fighting spreading
[50:15] fussing amongst you my god
[50:19] divisions everywhere but look upon it
[50:23] friends
[50:24] that fellowship because of the devil has
[50:27] become a battleship
[50:30] and now some of these churches
[50:33] have become so huge
[50:37] and become so successful in man's
[50:40] way of saying doing it saying it or
[50:42] recognizing it
[50:44] they have become so filled
[50:48] that they have become a cruise ship
[50:52] they cannot move with the speed and
[50:56] anointing of the quickening spirit
[50:58] and so it's become a cruise ship
[51:02] presenting you with a smoker's
[51:05] board of bible studies
[51:10] and you can have as much as you want
[51:13] 24 7. and if you're willing to feed on
[51:17] that
[51:18] that and fatten up yourself
[51:21] that's all right if you want a cruise
[51:25] ship
[51:26] or you want to live on a battleship
[51:30] but i'd rather to be in fellowship with
[51:33] the living god
[51:34] so that when i come to the end of life's
[51:37] way
[51:38] that god will say come thou good and
[51:42] faithful servant enter into the joy
[51:47] of the lord here you are on your cruise
[51:50] ship
[51:51] but must we be carried away on a flowery
[51:55] bed of religious ease no my brother
[51:58] sister
[51:59] we must fight like soldiers we must
[52:02] fight if we must reign fight against the
[52:05] powers of satan fight against evil and
[52:08] wickedness
[52:09] preach the truth without fear or favor
[52:12] oh glory to god and put your faith in
[52:15] him
[52:15] and god will make a way somehow
[52:19] a church has not changed no more zeal
[52:24] no more self-sacrifice
[52:27] no more faithfulness
[52:30] they're not going out by faith anymore
[52:33] we hardly have any real missionaries
[52:37] uh instead of missionaries we have
[52:40] opportunists
[52:42] i now want to be sure
[52:46] that the money is already there
[52:49] the financial support has to be already
[52:53] in place or they are not going
[52:57] and they call themselves true sons and
[53:00] daughters of god
[53:02] back to the bible no wonder
[53:05] man like peter and paul
[53:09] and john when they're accosted
[53:12] in the strength and a bigger
[53:15] ask them their answer was
[53:20] we are penniless we have no
[53:24] money silver and gold we have none
[53:28] but such as we have we give unto thee
[53:32] rise take up your bed and walk they had
[53:35] the coins of the kingdom
[53:36] but they had not the whirly
[53:40] coins of caesar all glory to god may god
[53:44] bring us back to the fabric of our faith
[53:47] the foundations of our faith and that
[53:50] raw primitive faith that relies on
[53:53] god alone not speaking words or just
[53:57] talking religious terms but trusting him
[54:01] in every aspect of your life's work
[54:05] and let him make a way for you
[54:09] here we are going as missionaries
[54:12] overseas
[54:14] seeking many times
[54:18] not solved but seeking gold
[54:22] seeking wealth seeking fame
[54:27] seeking fortune and deceiving their
[54:31] local natives many times
[54:36] corrupting many times the local
[54:40] population and there
[54:43] and jesus himself foresaw this and said
[54:47] their cross over sea land
[54:50] to go and make their disciples
[54:54] to fall more to kill the children of
[54:58] hell
[54:59] he said such a real hypocrite
[55:03] that jesus spoke about you will read
[55:07] about them
[55:08] in matthew chapter 6
[55:11] matthew chapter 22 and
[55:14] matthew chapter 23 also
[55:19] the bible describes them
[55:24] in jude 11
[55:28] to 13 woe unto them
[55:32] for they have god in the west came
[55:35] and ran greedily after the error of
[55:38] balaam
[55:40] for reward they were preaching
[55:45] for money they were serving
[55:49] god for gain yes
[55:52] they ran greedily after the error of
[55:55] balaam
[55:57] for reward and perished and again
[56:00] saying of four these
[56:04] are spots in your feasts of charity
[56:09] when they're fish with you
[56:12] feeding themselves without
[56:15] clouds are they without water
[56:19] carried about of every wind
[56:22] winds of doctrine
[56:25] trees whose fruit withering
[56:28] without fruit twice dead
[56:32] plopped up by the roof
[56:35] raging waves of the sea falling out
[56:38] their own shame
[56:40] wandering star let me say that again
[56:44] wandering stars i'm preaching about the
[56:47] wandering church
[56:49] wandering away from the word of god
[56:52] oh yes wandering away
[56:56] so whom is reserved the
[56:59] blackness of darkness forever
[57:04] o friends jude speaks of these
[57:07] angels these messengers these
[57:10] preachers that kept not their first
[57:14] estate
[57:15] that did not stay in their position
[57:19] but by the spirit of rebellion upon them
[57:22] spirit of neglect in some cases
[57:26] just indifference to the word of god
[57:30] they don't take it seriously just enough
[57:32] to get a religious
[57:34] atmosphere and spirit around
[57:39] but they are indifferent to god's
[57:43] divine command and so
[57:47] god's church wandered away
[57:51] from his word and began to do its own
[57:54] will
[57:56] to fulfill their own uh
[57:59] twisted and perverted desires
[58:04] contrary to what's in this bible
[58:08] yes friends we're living in a dark
[58:12] dismal day the dark day for god's church
[58:17] but thank god the friday of
[58:22] the crucifixion of the word of god
[58:27] is passed and is passing
[58:31] and it's now the mourning of the rising
[58:34] of the sun of righteousness
[58:37] with healing and deliverance in his
[58:39] wings
[58:41] the truth and the light is coming up
[58:45] is coming up for its morning time
[58:48] watchman what of the night the morning
[58:52] coming amen hallelujah
[58:56] the light is coming morning is coming
[58:59] morning is here it is the rising of the
[59:03] sun
[59:04] a man has come and turned on the light
[59:08] the seals are now open on our hearts
[59:12] truly are ablaze
[59:14] with the presence of almighty god my
[59:16] friend
[59:18] maybe you have wandered away from god's
[59:20] voice
[59:22] maybe have wandered away from this
[59:25] message of god but now
[59:29] you're welcome home come home
[59:33] come home it's supper time
[59:37] maybe you have been walking in the
[59:39] darkness of sin
[59:42] doubt fear religious

[59:49] maybe you have been wearing blinders
[59:54] but rise shine
[59:57] for your light has come
[1:00:00] and the glory of the lord has
[1:00:04] risen upon thee the hand and the heart
[1:00:08] of the lord

[1:00:21] him

[1:01:03] narrow

[1:01:25] and i will see
[1:01:28] you home may you surrender your life to
[1:01:32] him
