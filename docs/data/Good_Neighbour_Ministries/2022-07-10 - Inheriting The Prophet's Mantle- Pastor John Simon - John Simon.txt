isn't that right praise the Lord anyway um our scripture here today is 2 Kings reading from verse 9 and it came to pass when they were gone over this is speaking of Elijah and Elisha coming to the River Jordan Elijah said unto Elisha ask what shall I do for thee before I am taken away from thee and Elisha said I pray thee let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me and he said thou a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so and it came to pass as they went on and talked and behold there appeared The Chariot of fire and Horses of fire and parted them aund and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven and Elisha saw it and he cried my father my father The Chariot of Israel the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took a hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces and he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan praise the Lord may God bless us today in quickness to the word Open the Eyes of the heart wherever we are online or present here in this congregation may the Lord Open the Eyes of your heart that you might see the fullness of his word our gracious heavenly father as we join together in prayer to the Lord now asking for your Divine uh Lord presence on the word amen just just as your great angel came to Empire uh and to assist uh brother Branham the seventh angel to minister under Divine gift by the power of the Holy Spirit we ask now that the same great angel of God will be present father not for the healing but to fulfill the thir P of the spoken word being revealed and made known that your people might walk out of here healed and whole in mind heart body that we may be glorified and lifted up but we ask this all in the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord amen and amen God bless you please be seated uh my subject today is inheriting the prophet's mantle amen now we all know about the Life Ministry and message of our precious brother and Prophet brother William Marian Branham of course we believe him to be the Fulfillment of Malachi 4 five amen is that right we believe him to be the Fulfillment of Revelation 107 The Angel to the seventh Church Age We believe that amen not just saying I believe but we seen something we recognize something and it brought us into a a state of faith that we could not have ourselves so I'm here this morning speaking on inheriting this prophet's mantle and just to be careful I'm not here to speak or to um what should I say give hits as if I am inheriting the prophets mantle that would be foolish that would be presumptuous that would be false Doctrine I want to say that emphatically so that you know I'm not bringing this message with even that thought or insinuation back of me I'm not even here speaking um that there is any man now alive that just goes out and inherits the prophet's mantle because that again would be false Doctrine absolutely in conclusively we know that the genuine original Spirit are you listening amen that was on and in Elijah that spirit of God was in brother William Marian Branham that same original spirit and it manifested itself in the person of William Branham now I want you to see here that and we know this brother William Marian Branham has left this world he's gone yes he's not here many are living on dreams others are living on you know figments of their imagination of of when he was here but he is not here he is dead he is gone amen but while he was here on this Earth if there ever was a man and there is and was such a man his name being William Maran Branham and he moved and lived and operated under the power the spirit and the anointing of the spirit of Elijah anointed by God and by the Holy Ghost to fulfill Malachi 45 and 6 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children amen and the Heart of the children to the fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse amen I want to say this 20th century has been blessed with this great Supernatural occurrence right of The Descent of the seventh angel with the message yes and spirit of Elijah that went on before but I want to say he's gone but when he went up in the Bible and I believe in our time his mantle did not go up with him the mantle did not go up into the heavens with him but instead it fell back to Earth and it fell upon Elisha the mantle came back on Elisha amen I want what I'm presenting to you is that the message and the mission and the life of brother Branham that he lived did not stay with the Prophet amen but when he was dead he did not go up and still remain pastor and Prophet on the earth that's right because he is dead amen he is gone that Ministry is over the seventh Church age is still in process but that purpose and fulfillment is already fulfilled fill Malachi 4:5 is fulfilled it's still in the process of the finishing parts of it and I tell you Revelation 10:7 is now is in progress Hallelujah and I thank God that I'm a part of it we not denying I'm not denying I'm not putting aside any of those things but I'm saying he is dead he's gone listen how how can he uh remain Prophet amen how can he remain Pastor after he's dead amen the only person who came back or showed themselves to be that was Samuel and he did it to a witch uh he didn't have to come back to know beli to to prove that they already knew he was the prophet amen and brother brandham is and was the prophet now in Joshua chap 1 veres 1 and 2 it begins this is how Joshua's time age and season begins now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it come to pass that the M Lord spake unto Joshua the none of none hallelujah amen praise God if there are any Joshua here today I hope you hear the word of God Allelujah because there are all tribes all around us and Joshua was just in the midst of them just another one but he happened to be named Joshua amen and the spirit of God spoke to Joshua saying Moses my servant is dead hallelujah praise God a lot of people are still going to be intrigued by Moses they'll have he hero worship of Moses the the you know Moses will become their Idol and everything else but I want you to know Moses is dead don't build any Shrine any statue any thing of him just re recogize he is dead honor him thank God for him praise God for him glorify God for him remember the wonderful days of his miracles and wonders in the wilderness but this is from the mouth of Jehovah Moses my servant is dead amen he's gone Hallelujah now amen therefore arise Hallelujah go over this Jordan Hallelujah he's not here to take you over he's not going to take you over but I am anointing you now that you are going to go over this Jordan Hallelujah and all this people unto the land which I do give them even to the children of Israel brother brandham is dead yet because of his outstanding Ministry the Deep calls to the Deep marvelous one wonderful Miracles discernment like you've never seen nobody other than the Lord Jesus Christ himself has ever had such a display of the power and the presence of almighty God working through their life but he was ordained for that purpose predestinated by the hand of God to be a prepared vessel in this hour for God to use that he might represent himself praise the Lord hallelujah amen I want you to know my friends as we are here speaking we are speaking the truth in love am for there are many precious and wonderful Believers around the world who are misled misled into believing that the dead Prophet William Marian Branham our brother that he is still their Pastor even though he's dead and they don't recognize that they're going off into a false belief amen amen that teaching is not in line with any Scripture it's not in line with any type it's not in line with any of the Shadows that you can find in the word of God that will cast their Shadows on the wall of time there is no such a thing amen listen my friends I tell you what they should have seen is that when Elijah went up the mantle came down and the mantle fell on the shoulders of Elisha amen listen brother Branham himself in the trial paragraph 102 listen to me God takes his man that's right but he never takes his Spirit the spirit that was upon Elijah came down upon Elisha and from then it come on down down and down and down and on down that Spirit was Upon Jesus and now it come down on the church Hallelujah it come down on the church the bride it comes down on the elect Hallelujah and so it goes on and on because we know it has to come again to the Jews right praise the Lord when she goes up then that Spirit now goes to the Jews but he is saying here that Spirit has come back since it left Jesus Christ and it's come back on the Church of the Living God hallelujah how many believe that thank you Jesus amen now we know this truth or if you want to call it a princip this principle that that that Prophet just spoke is still lives today it's efficacious it's effective still today because God did not put away the mantle of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah that some of us we've seen that mantle manifested as a pillar of fire above his head we' seen that a mantle manifested as a mantle across his shoulders we have seen that pillar fire in many forms hallelujah amen that same holy spirit of God was the mantle and is still the mantle today praise the Lord hallelujah fulfilling Malachi 45 and 6 I as I've said before amen but now that same spirit is here to fulfill Ephesians 4 thank you Jesus Ephesians 4 Listen from verse 7 but unto every one of us us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ could you put the scripture up please amen wherefore he said when he ascended up listen on high he led captivity and gave gifts unto men all things and he gave some upon Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors teachers for the Perfection of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith Hallelujah and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man W unto the stature measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth having received such Revelation such understanding be no more children tossed to and fro carried about by every wind of Doctrine or by the the slight of mans and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in weight to deceive whether consciously or unconsciously but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ Hallelujah now Elijah the prophet of God said that types the bride Hallelujah of course nobody was understanding that elishah types the bride and a lot of stuff preached about that but when the mantle in the first Elisha came down it went straight to Elisha don't tell me the scripture changed and it went somewhere else now if it's right here with the bride and on the bride and it's on her in the form of the fivefold ministry that God has given to this bride in this hour hallelujah hallelujah now she has a manyfold ministry as she ministers back to her husband amen the word that he worked to provide hallelujah amen thank God our ministry is to the glorified Jesus the one who died for me amen hallelujah now let's look into the life of Elijah and Elisha to see the truth uh of this false belief that has misled many of God's precious and one wonderful people and may the Holy Spirit cut off the head of this snake and get rid of it but the True Believers does not look back they don't have any if Wonder with if butts or anything they are certain of God and their faith is placed upon the foundations that was laid by the Master Mason God using a prophet to lay it out Hallelujah pra praise God Amen this belief as I repeat has misled a lot of God's wonderful precious sincere people nothing wrong with the people God's blessed them anointed them but theyve been misled by this false belief now in our scripture reading we're looking at the last days of Elijah as El Elijah was walking and talking with Elisha as they journeyed from gilgal amen beel and Jordan praise the Lord I thank God we have three plls in this message and all through those three plls that Prophet was talking to his disciple to his follower Elisha talking with him whether he understood everything at the beginning uh uh by the time they get to Jordan I believe he understood then uh clearly because he even knew without being told that Elisha is going away uh it was revealed to him praise God hallelujah amen hallelujah and you see that Journey from gilgal to beel to Jordan was the testing ground for Rel elah because under the mockings the scoffings the hardness of the journey uh he he could have turned back from Elijah's message he could have given up oh but he stayed with the message stayed with that Prophet was speaking the word to him Hallelujah just like know me gave root the same tree test oh even the prophet of himself saying some things that if you don't careful it'll discourage you it'll tell you go back you know uh go back to your mother and your father take care of your old Daddy what about your aunt that used to live with now if you follow me then there's nothing there's no money you can get there is no big uh worldwide Ministry that you can have there is no uh big crowds big chur Church it it's just me and you walking together here so so go back he said no I'm not going back Ruth said no I'm not going back amen hallelujah your God is my God hallelujah I'm seeing what you're seeing now I'm not going back because I'm holding to God's unchanging hand amen praise God hallelujah you see the parallel there no he said well uh or go back and ARA said you know what you're saying makes sense I think I am going to go back and she turned back and went back to her relatives but Ruth said no amen I am going on with you where you die I'll die where you live I live wherever you are that's where I'm going wherever the prophets come to that's where we going we're not turning back we're not turning to the left or to the right but we're going like he did in the first resurrection amen oh my but you know what just like Ruth Elijah stood faithful he stood loyal to that prophet and to the word of God and stood firm in the midst of a faithless idol worshiping generation they held to the word of the words of the Living God hallelujah and they did not twist to the left not to the right I'm can you say I'm pressing on say I'm pressing on say it again I'm pressing on I'm pressing on I'm pressing on the upward way and New Heights I'm gaining every day still praying as I'm onward bound Lord plant my feet on higher ground amen praise the Lord I'm sure while there were walking and the Bible says it took the time to say they were walking not just walking but they were also talking and walking and talking my friends no doubt they were they looked and they seen the sceneries and everything else like that you know like right now I'm thinking about when I walk through the valley of doves where where where Jesus walked to to go over to the other side amen praise God but but anyway they're my friends they were walking and talking but I believe their entire conversation was not about not just about the scenery amen I'm sure Elijah knowing where he was going and what was going to happen was talking to Elijah and what seems like simple stories and what seems like just chat he was instructing elishah he was instructing elishah through just simple things as they walked and talked along the way and I believe God's holy spirit did the same things for us through this elishah Prophet that God sent in this last day hallelujah praise God Amen I believe my friends he also was building up Elisha's spirit amen he was in other words encouraging him that you can do without me I don't have to be around uh you know uh two of us can't be on the ark at the same time I I I have to go I got to decrease that he might increase you see I can't be here encouraging him preparing his mind and his heart for departure you also he was no doubt directing him giving him little hints of uh in your work you're going to have Kings oppose you mighty men oppose you you're going to have to come up against kingdoms priests all kinds of people all kinds of situations but the Lord our god Jehovah is with you amen and he was encouraging amen just like like God said to him just as I was with Moses I will be with thee hallelujah praise God but not only that he was quickening him he was walking talking and speaking words of inspiration that will set his soul a fire to fulfill the word of God for their day and for their hour praise God the Bible says in 2 Kings verse 8 and Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smoked the waters and they were divided hither and sther praise God I'm so thankful that when that Prophet put his hand on the word when he began to speak that word that word began to break that word begin to open up hither and T and everywhere the word start to open up and the eyes of the True Believer could see it so they know how they can walk over they know how they can walk in the Rapture they receive Rapture and Faith by the words of God through the prophet of Malachi 45 and it came to pass amen they and they too went over on dry ground Hallelujah it came to pass not it not muddy ground I just pause there I want you understand even in all them little things God a taking you over through muddy waters your muddy in your mind what you believe and everything muddied up no no no he the Bible said they went over on dry ground in other words time tested Faith praise God they didn't go over on Guess work amen maybe I'll step in quick sand maybe this will Happ no no no there's no maybe now they are certain of God they stand upon the word of of the Living God they cross over on dry ground amen and it came to pass when they were gone over that Elijah said unto elishah ask what shall I do for thee before I am taken away from thee of course he''s already done it amen and Elisha said I pray thee let a double portion of th my spirit be upon me oh my think about that let the double portion of thy Spirit be upon Me 2 Kings 2:10 and he said th was us a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so you know many years ago I told Believers oh somewhere I don't know I said this thought that brother so and so a great mighty brother that had captured the world and everybody I I believe he preached the message called if you see me go if you see me go and uh said I never heard that message what was in the message and I start telling them what I think I heard in the message and it's only this must we were 20 something years later the Holy Spirit saying no he never preached such a message you that was for you to speak now that message right if you see me go praise the Lord but he didn't but in my mind I was certain that he had preed it but he didn't and it came to pass as they went on and talked behold there appear paed Chariot of fire horses of Fire part Ed them b a su and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven and Elisha saw it just to show you brother brother Elijah went up with the Chariots of Fire brother Brandon went up in a Kash right uh this is a modern Chariot with horse power and and you know and Elisha saw it and he cried my father my father The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more did you read that scripture again and he saw him no more he saw him no more I think that's speaking to us it's speaking to everyone that will read the scripture itself telling you as much as he loved Elijah as much as he was loyal to Elijah as much as he honored Elijah oh praise God he saw him no more praise God and that's what we are here not to see him no more our eyes are to see Jesus only recognize the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah he who is the foundation that one came through the seven Church a using even this Prophet as a messenger and then he comes right back to the fullness of the Capstone revelation of himself praise God back to the word amen back to the original faith in our Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah thank you Jesus and he took a hold of his own clothes all the denominational things he used to wear before and all the other conceptions and beliefs he had had even while he was in the message and he rent them and tore them to Pieces amen and he took up also the mantle of Elijah praise the Lord and that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of Jordan that's where we are right now is that right you believe that's where we are right now hallelujah oh my my my we're standing on the banks of Jordan praise the name of the Lord what a hour what a time brother Believers oh any moment now our Lord can come praise God ready for the crossing ready for the going over amen praise the Lord hallelujah praise God hallelujah amen oh praise God then came that eventful hour of course Elijah was caught up into the heavenlies by a band of angels that were perceived by the human eye as chariots and as Horses uh in going to the background of this you will see that it means cherubims and seraphim are the ones that really came to take him home seraphim means fiery ones and uh cherubims mean Chariots of God and and and they came to take him back home but also it's elishah was speaking also what are we going to do now because uh the Chariots of Israel the horses of Israel that's the strength of a nation in those days hallelujah and what he was referring to is that your presence in Israel was equally or more important than Israel having an an army because as long as you are there and if they had recognized you they wouldn't have need to have no Army because you are there the enemy can't move oh they're coming around the site oh they're coming over there or they're doing this they're doing that even the king's bed chamber telling what he's talking about in there no secrets from the prophet praise God hallelujah amen and it would be would have been the same for this Prophet had they looked to that and taken that amen praise the Lord Lord just before the Rapture just before Elijah went up before his Rapture is when Elijah asked this question asking for a double portion H the thing about it you have to notice that Elijah didn't rebuke him Elijah says how dare you ask for such a thing why would you do it no he did not rebuke him from ask asking for a double portion of what he had what he was asking for is I want to inherit your mantle I want to inherit the prophet's mantle praise the Lord hallelujah see see he didn't ask God lord I want twice as much as Elijah had that really wasn't his prayer he wasn't asking for twice as much as Elijah had H his it wasn't a prayer of spiritual ambition amen and a desire to excel Elijah on the world stage it was no such a thing it his request was actually one of humility because and Elijah understood I I I need that double portion to to even walk and follow your message and to follow in your footsteps I I need to have a double portion on me that I might do the will of the Living God hallelujah praise God so he needed a double portion what he was asking for there as this opens up a little more is Deuteronomy 21:17 which speaks about the rights of the of a firstborn son that he has the right to ask and receive a double portion from his father amen and this is what Elijah understood all that so this is what he was really asking for he not Pride it's not asking for power he not going out and praying that he might have more miracles than brother Bram had brother Bram already explained that that the the the the the bride collectively is going to have more they're going to do Greater Works than even Jesus but not individual but as the bride as a people of God they'll do great Mighty Works Hal Hallelujah some you'll never hear of until you get to heaven because some of those men and women that God will move with in that way living hidden lies they will even want to cover it up and hide it so you don't even know anything about it amen but those ones who wants to puff and to know and to be known and to be recognized and to be seen I did this and I did that and I'm not even uh praise about it you got to know they will be the ones that brother called living a hidden life amen they're going to Pro classet and they pray quietly amen and God manifesting himself by the word Hallelujah by the Holy Spirit praise God Amen yes sir he wanted the rights of the firstborn in First Kings chapter 19 vers 15 to 21 you will see the call of Elijah Elisha sorry Elisha and in this you will see that God it wasn't Elisha thought I want a good man to follow me after I leave or after I uh retire not that he could say that back then but praise God I I I want God uh you no he didn't pray like he didn't even pray about anything God came to him the Bible says if you read that chapter and said Elijah arise go down to so and so place you will there you will find safat Elisha the son of safat the farmer amen go to him and anoint him amen what he is going to be propit in your stad Oh Glory to God the voice is now in the bride Hallelujah and she knows what to do with the word there's not the prophet isn't here but the bride Saints of the Living God elected are here and the same word the same message the same power in the Holy Spirit Hallelujah working through the bride hallelujah amen yes sir yes sir so we find out that Elisha Elijah went by Divine command which means that Elisha was elected that's right by God himself amen before he elishah himself knew it abolutely he was already elected but then God had to send Elisha to call him is that right and you read the scripture the Bible says and when Elisha got there he he told him uh leave the father mother far and everything and come and follow me and the Bible says he took the mantle from off his shoulder and he laid it on top of Elisha's shoulder this is just in the beginning when he just get the call hallelujah amen and excuse me and so we find out that he was elected he was called and then he was placed right beside the the prophet to walk in the prophet's Ministry message and life and that was his placing is that right I wonder what's your placing where you find yourselves now you're in your position right now you're already following the message you're following the message that a a genuine God sent certified stamped with approval Prophet brought the word you are following that word just like elishah did back in the Bible days we are here following that word here today amen praise the Lord Jesus amen so Elisha God placed Elisha he didn't just decide I'm going to follow Elisha I'm going to follow the prophet's message no this one was called elected and placed to be right there beside the Prophet for what purpose that he might learn that he might be instructed that he might observe that the Holy Spirit can teach him amen praise it doesn't mean that Elijah opened a bible school and start to teach no but the Holy Spirit was teaching him from the man's actions the man's walk the man's life the man's saying praise God our prophit from the time you come and contact with this message as an elected seed I'm not saying every single person that following the message but the true elected seed of God from that moment the mantle was already laying on your shoulder but the Bible said Elijah took his mantle and laid it upon Elijah I want to thank God the prophet laid this message on me and brother sister that message took a hold of my soul and it has never let me go that message grips me and it grips me even now praise God hallelujah praise God hallelujah amen from the day I received two of his books amen never having heard oh my goodness two of this man's books were given that was a turning point in my life same with every one of us might have been a book might have been a tape it might have been a saying it might be some of his writings it might be a tape whatever it was that was God sending a the mantle to lay it on your mind your heart your soul hallelujah praise God no what matter what anybody says your calling was not of man was not by chance it was by God's Divine command it's was by God's Divine call why you think you still hear Last Man last woman standing while many others fall to the right fall to the left fall behind fall before you are still here you you can't even tell your own reason why hallelujah amen praise God you think brother Danny has to be here you think brother Gabriel got to be here uh you people of their status you think uh why do you have to be inside a place like this you know you call that a church you call that no my friends I'm telling you that I'm not making a differentiation between us I'm just trying to tell you that if they were of that kind of spirit they would not have been here right glory to God you don't have to be here because you talk about success you talk about money you talk about this that okay God bless them God give them this give them that praise the Lord they may not think so but God bless them praise the Lord they don't really have to worry and this and that but the Holy Spirit did that thank you praise the Lord glory to God the Holy Spirit did that oh praise God when the Holy Spirit come and talk to you it's not me talk to you and and tell you uh who I am it's not for me to tell you who I am it's for the Holy Spirit to tell you that amen if I'm supposed to be a pastor the Holy Spirit tells you that it's not me forcing myself on you or persuading you or anything like that it's you recognizing your day your message Hallelujah you recognizing the word for your hour praise the name of the Lord praise God later on we didn't even see the man we heard his tapes on some of those big old Wen sack with corners and all kinds of books man I go far back enough when there were still typing some of the books to the books were not out as yet and people were trying to hand type them as fast as they can and give them to whoever else and pass them around and photocopy them or whatever and pass them on now we got all the equipment is being uh translated being printed and many hands make light work praise God and then finally we were able to actually see the man on video praise God God using Brother uh perig green to obtain that from uh the brother over there I think in New Zealand amen uh who had the tape but he didn't know uh because he he used to attend the Full Gospel business man's meetings and he didn't know he had the tape called Deep to the deep and in talking with Brother P it came out that he had a tape of brother brandom and when brother Perry looked at it whoa he said I got a we got to take this and multiply it and give it to the world and you know the rest of the story we have it now right now praise God hallelujah but I want to tell you with all the books with all the tapes with all those things and with the video and all it's wonderful but the greatest thing he left us is his character his example that we can follow Hallelujah a Christlike life that impressed us touched us changed us transformed us hallelujah and I thank God for it amen oh praise God I believe that our calling to the message that mantle already came on our shoulders in the form of the message itself and the word of God hallelujah we we continue to speak on this we have some more time and we'll speak on it is that okay amen hallelujah so then that mantle was already on and is already on our shoulders in baby form from the time you received the message God already identify you you know I don't want to go off on all kinds of angles but you know God already identified you and placed you called you and plac you right beside the prophet doesn't mean we could to walk with him everywhere he went but we're walking with the message am some of us go to work with it some of us listening to it in the car some of us listening to it before we fall asleep we wake up we hear the message we we're following him we're walking with the prophet hallelujah amen we're walking with him every step that he's taken hallelujah amen and then we answered that call praise the Lord so when Elijah went up when brother Branham died Hallelujah we find out the emphasis was what Elisha told him if when I am taken from you if you see me go if you see and I emphasize the word see if you see me go you can have it you can have what you ask for first of all let me back up here to explain to you that Elijah knew that he couldn't really give his mantle to Elisha and he knew it was somebody else's right to do the giving so he said this is a hard saying who knows I don't know if he pray or what he did but the god already watching and know those things Hallelujah so it's a hard thing because he can't give a prophetic gift to anybody he he can't pass on an apostleship to somebody else he can't give a gift of Prophecy to another young man that he wants to that might have been his human desire but as he he is a prophet know that he can't do that he don't have the power to do that and those things are by Grace it's by God himself has to do that Hallelujah so he says you're asking me a hard thing nevertheless if that shows he himself don't know he said if you see me go the thing the emphasis is you got to be able to see me you got to have something in you that will enable you to see me go oh isn't that wonderful I think that's really wonderful and um God bless him because Elisha was a loyal father follow even in the times when we didn't understand everything we we didn't understand even the first thing you heard the serpent seed you didn't understand it but you didn't understand marriage and divorce you didn't understand and you can go down the line but the thing about it is not the actual writings the sayings of the doctrines the Unseen presence of the Holy Spirit was witnessing you speak for yourself I'm speaking for me now that he was speaking to my heart that's thus say it the Lord that is the word of God that's the truth praise God hallelujah and I'm rest my entire life future Ministry and everything on that because I believed it from the bottom of my [Applause] soulall praise God there was no you said oh I believe the message but back when this message first came and dropped down there was no preaching circuit for anybody to go around and possibly to raise funds whether for themselves or for Missions there was no such a thing you had to be you had to come to the word by faith Hallelujah I came to North America you can come maybe five or 10 churches on your hand there was nowhere else there was nobody else else so you you couldn't think that you're going to make a fortune or you going to have this big Ministry or this or that your entire Reliance was upon God your missionary trip was not made up of going to from church to church and uh automatically raise enough funds and then you have the faith to go oh no you went completely by raw primitive Christian faith relying on no man no nothing but resting upon God's Divine Providence on the Promises of his word hallelujah amen praise God Amen I want you to know that he was a loyal follower and supporter of Elijah doesn't matter what and he was obedient to Elijah's teaching he was humble and when I I use that term I place that there because remembering all the mockings and scoffings of them sons of of uh of the prophets uh these so-called Christians nominal Believers uh oh there's Elijah pass Elisha passing you know he used to wash the hands of Elijah of course that's a he's telling him that he's nothing like a footwash flunky that he was Elijah's flunky why why you know I've heard people say that to brother like Peter why do you have to listen to brother Simon like that why why you have to go uh Always by his side why you always asking him questions why you always want to go where he go why you you want to do this you want to do that but you see they don't understand that man saw something he wasn't looking at me he was looking at what was there and manifesting itself and he could see that if nobody else could see it he saw it and therefore praise God God blessed him and manifest himself through him don't know how he got into this but anyway praise the Lord thank you Jesus all them wonderful things were good he took all the mockings all the scoffings praise the name of is that right I come to this message and I would walk down the street of of the village or the tong and you would hear the people say saying there goes the serpent seed man look a bromite passing oh my all the mockings and all the scoffings you bore the reproach for the word of the Living God hallelujah amen praise God all of that was good but the promise was that was good if you see me go Elisha we know received Elijah's Mantle and the reason why he received the mantle is because he saw the word in its Ascension he saw the word Prophet back then physically going up in his Ascension surrounded by the fires of God the pillar of fire the Living God Amen Hallelujah to the elected bride in this day and in this hour we don't see the physical Prophet caught up and see the pillar of fire taking him up in the presence of the Living God but when we look at the message the word the body of truth that he has left behind we see the pillar of fire we see the revelation of the word as it's in its Ascension from octave to acave to acave Glory unto Glory Hallelujah oh praise God and God says if you see that amen if you see me go the mantle is there for you to use for his glory and for his honor amen oh my we seen it glory to glory until it's shining brighter and brighter until we step into that perfect day oh praise God forever more verse 12 2 Kings 2:12 says and from that time he saw him no more how he going to see him he seen the purifier he see he seen the lights of God he seen the fire of the Holy Spirit around him he saw him no more listen to brother Brandon speaking and the message called the rising of the sun oh friends if I can only get myself out of the way so that when William brandham is thought of that you is not even thought of anymore and you not even he repeats and you not even sought of him anymore till we can see Jesus glorified Among Us seeing him that is our desire and that gives us the quickening power the mantle the quickening power comes upon you Hallelujah it gives you Joy to know that we are with him both flesh and born of him for We Are The Bride of him and see him with his Vindicated means and methods and proving by that in us and through us that he is now risen from the dead Jesus Christ Christ the same yesterday today and forever Elijah then Elijah in Elisha Elijah in John the Baptist the spirit of Elijah moving in Christ which is the spirit of Christ The Same Spirit back in our day in Malachi 4:5 Hallelujah and continues to move on and on and on to fulfill the word of God hallelujah amen hallelujah you see Elisha had to see him go in that way Isaiah chapter 6 you don't have to put up that scripture because most of you know it it starts in the year that King Uzziah died Isaiah saw the Lord is that right you see my friends once that uh hero uh you know your Boyhood friend your your brother because Elijah I mean Isaiah and Uzziah were good bodies they grew up together one are maybe his father was well off but this is the king and they grew up together so he always walking with Uzziah and they together in that social status that line that they were in they walk like that but the year God had to live literally take away Isiah so that Isaiah can get his eyes off of him and Look to Him Jehovah and the same God had to take the prophet out of the way that you and I can keep our eyes on Jesus Look Away to Jesus Look Away to Jesus let my eyes see Jesus only let my feet walk in his way oh blessed be the name of the Living God as Elijah ascended Elisha saw what not Elijah but he saw the power and the glory of the re revelation of God hallelujah God revealing himself that's what he saw and he saw Elijah no more because what he want to see now is that revelation of God continuing on Hallelujah and when the elect of God sees the great words of God in this last day set on fire amen when that word begins to shine light upon your pathway Hallelujah yes sir I tell you it makes you love honor and respect brother William Branham even more but you have no Illusions Jesus is our lord Jesus died for our sins Jesus H on the cross Jesus rose again Jesus lives today brother brandham is dead Moses is dead the prophets are dead but thank God Jesus Christ is alive today amen it is the rising of the sun hallelujah hallelujah amen praise the Lord oh the eyes of this elect bride see only Jesus Christ the revealed word remember what I say doesn't mean they forget brother Bram don't mean they push him in the background push him somewhere else Hallelujah they know who he is they know his position even more than they knew before they honor him they love him they respect him Hallelujah he was just one of our brothers with the highest calling of our age to carry out the will and purpose of the Living God and he completed his work amen and now he has placed Us in the hands of the bridegroom of our Isaac and our eyes are on Isaac only our eyes are on Jesus only our eyes is on the Lord not the messenger but on the Lord himself and we give him the glory and the honor and the praise thank hallelujah praise God forever more thank God that Elisha inherited Elijah's Mantle but why did he uh inherit it like um where was I yes he was saying it is a hard thing but really when I looked into that that's really saying in the Hebrew it is not mine to give right he can't give it uh but but yet he had it why can't he give it you see then it becomes a puzle he got it why can't he give it but he can't give it but it's not his to give and so there but Elijah got it well how did he get it not from Elijah but he got it from the one who told Elijah go and call him out of this whole rotten stinking world I want to call him out I want to call her out Hallelujah and his understanding his Revelation his discernment and all that that is going to come back and work through them Hallelujah uh Discerning the age bringing the word for the age the voice now in the bride the Holy Spirit working through a many membered body Hallelujah not Malachi 4:5 anymore but Ephesians 4 making itself manifest Hallelujah a bride ministering back to her husband oh praise God hallelujah amen so then we can clearly see now elishah did not receive the mantle by blood relations is that right he did not receive the mantle by natural sunship he could not get it by natural sunship even if he was a natural son he wouldn't get it that way because it's it's God has to give that it can't be passed down there is no such a a a lie such a Doctrine as Apostolic succession that's a madeup Doctrine by the Babylonian cartel and and and people are living off of that uh Babylonian belief to this day that that there's such a thing as Apostolic succession Peter couldn't give anybody anything none of them could hand off their they they their thing to somebody else they could not do it God has to do that and such it and so there is therefore no teaching also of prophetic succession no it's not in the scriptures there's no example of any such a thing and if you look on it you'll never find it in the entire Bible but he did receive the mantle by his spiritual sunship is that right you see Elisha had no children and when Elisha came out God told him to take him he became his spiritual son and Elisha Elijah became his spiritual father right so automatically he was Elijah J firstborn if you want to put it that way he was his firstborn so when he was claiming that double portion it was the birthright of the firstborn or the right of the firstborn to ask for a double portion over the rest of all of them amen there might be a lot of other Christians a lot of other believers but he had and she had the right to ask for double portion hallelujah amen and he received the mantle also because of adopted sunship because Elijah adopted him from his father if you want to put it that way you got I don't want to preach on that but you come through the same stages right uh like that adoption and so praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen so he received that mantle by the rights of the firstborn son repeat the scripture for you that you might know where it is Deuteronomy 21:17 praise the Lord re elected remember called placed by God's Mighty hand and listen what Matthew 10:41 could you put that up for me it's important that they read that Matthew chap 10: 41 and let's read that he he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet what shall receive a prophet's reward do you say Amen to that do you say Amen to that he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward hallelujah praise God this bride of this last day how does she receive the prophet's reward I believe she receives it just like Elisha did praise the Lord hallelujah now as we are quickly coming down to our closing there's a great missionary many years ago by the name of William KY have you ever heard the name okay William kery was a great missionary of days gone by and he spoke about seeing um either in England or Ireland he spoke about a there was a mine cave in you know we get that here Cal mines gold mines whatever mines they had a cave in and when the mine cave in then a a big strong Miner um said to them here you hold the Rope I'm going down into the pit to get rescue any of the brothers any of the uh uh boys that are down there I'm going down into that pit amen hallelujah well I want to say the prophets reward is just like that minor when he goes down in the pit and brings out and rescues those people and you are holding the Rope for him to go down you have to be in one mind with him yeah you got to have the same motive with him you you got to have that to hold that rope and to hold it there tight in your hands I want you to know for many long years this Prophet William Branham has been letting down the lifeline into this pit of this world that we are living in this dark dangerous dingy and dismal pit that we are in we usually say it's the pits yes well he came and placed the Rope the lifeline the Redemption line of the blood of Christ placed down into the darkness of this world's pit but I want you to know my friends that not only brother brandham but righteous men that followed his footsteps like brother hild the Brandt you believe that righteous men you may not know some of these names brother Henry green down in the South Ruth North Carolina brother Jerry Ro down in Charlotte North Carolina brother laon of Ohio Senor all these names now deceased but my friends they were holding the ropes amen and they sending into that pit to pull out as many as they can because they're trying to find the last one that has to come in and they don't care what it took they were going down in those pits and expect that the rest of us will hold the Rope so that they can go down amen then in our time and after that time there was brother old brother Samuel Johnson still alive as far as I know over there in Michigan praise God held lots of camp meetings conventions prayers and stuff like that serve this purpose serve this time did the will of God the Philippines all around the world he went down into the dark dismal pits to win oh praise God and to save the lost at any cost to bring them to Jesus Christ amen we have with us brother Ed bcll that is carrying on the work of the Living God right now reach out everywhere across not only this land across the Nations Around The World God has given him blessing with the means with the ministry the desire the motive to reach out and rescue as many as he can praise the Lord all those that work with him follow him the same desire that's what I'm saying they have to have the desire for him to be able to go down holding on the end of the rope and and then they let him down into that dark dismal pit of the Lost oppressed and dying to bring them to the Saving Grace of Jesus Christ rescue them oh praise God hallelujah praise God there's brother Harold Becket over there in South Africa a man who God again blessed in a wonderful way and gives his all around the world many quiet Works being done many many others who I can name oh praise God right in our own country there was brother George Ferguson Hallelujah there was no message churches in Quebec and God used that man and his wife that they would preach the word they would declare the gospel until churches began to spring up and many of them are still there today and now they're multiplied praise God hallelujah we have Brother Joseph Branham he's done in the voice of God continuing with the ministry and the message that his father brother William Maran Bram had and he is trying to do what spread it everywhere amen all he can do is to do what he knows how to do is that right might let me tell you something whether God call you to preach God call you to sing what God call you to sweep the floors God call you to do whatever amen do whatever you can to get this message out to your neighbors your friends your family Jerusalem Judea Samaria to the uttermost parts of the earth Hallelujah glory amen thank you Lord oh praise God and there are they are surrounded by an innumerable company of Messengers that God sends in our sent and has sent and is sending in our day and in our time and their one motive and desire is to win the Lost rescue the dying oh my care for the perishing rescue the dying to throw out that lifeline and bring them in praise the name of the Lord oh praise God going everywhere across the world and rescue missions amen I want you to say friends what I'm saying here that we're all brethren we are all Brethren regardless of your views regardless of what you think this one teach that one teach that one think that one say this one this that is none of your business that's God's business to correct those things put them in line place them how he wants them you just do what he sent you to do I'm doing what he sent me here to do praise God oh my my God will make one man appear rough maybe like myself and crude and the way you say things the way you put things you you're in your face kind of person while another man is very diplomatic and you know smooth and everything no but God made some to be just plain amen man and he bring others that are made to be hammers I'm I'm going off on another anger but let me come back here but praise God I thank God for every one of those brothers and I'm saying that because all these brothers had people saying all kinds of things about them and people giving all kind of views and even taking the Bible the word to prove this and prove that amen and maybe they're wrong in some of the things they did or said uh maybe they are I that's for the word of God to determine all that Amen in your heart you may have some idea you may know but God is saying you're knowing it don't mean you need to go say it all you got to do is focus on what God is trying to do and God is blessing God is using them for his glory and for his honor amen praise God God hallelujah amen so we are all Brethren regardless of our views of our stands amen and it makes no difference to us let God take care of if one tribe wants to stay on the other side of the Jordan then that's up to them that's their decision but I come on this side of the Jordan but you know you'll find that let me give you uh somewhere I have a scripture uh for that somewhere in here just a minute maybe I did not write it down I think it's Joshua the Book of Joshua somewhere in there chapter 14 but it talks about when the children of Ruben after they went in they went into the message they went into the land they they overcame the land the the the it was established now and what happened they say Reuben manasse and God they said we we we going to stay on the other side of the river right there certain of Moses you know they know who Moses is right but Joshua is Young and yeah you know he's just talking like that you know so we're going to stay on this side anyway for to be safe we're going to stay on the side where Moses was and they stay on that side of the river and the rest of the Brethren at first thing they pull their swords and Spears and came down there to have War amen just like in this message you they came down for war amen oh my you oh my goodness one brother told y he said Brothers sit down or I'll bury you with coats here today oh my Lord have mercy oh they came for war amen but my when they came for war the tribe of you Ruben and them said let's talk first and they start to talk and they start to talk they didn't change their view that they want to stay on that side of the river and this side didn't change their view but this one said look if you get a war across the river we're coming over and we're going to fight the war with you because we are one

I I don't like him you know because if somebody else was bringing it maybe I will get no you don't care about who's carrying the message you your concern is the message itself and the message going out to reach the world out there praise the name of the Lord that should be our vision and to see it that way praise God so Hold Steady hold strong and hold fast to the word of the Living God hold that rope amen I said hold that rope amen hold that rope amen you may be going down in the same pit but you're not going down maybe as deep as them you are just on the top part but you're doing the

they need somebody to hold a rope while they go down into the dark dismal dingy pit of Hell that are down there somebody that can hold the lifeline and Reed The Prophet's reward how by the efforts both efforts the efforts of the one going down and the efforts of the one holding the Rope of one motive winning the loss cost at any cost bringing the last seed in warning motive and just like Elijah you will share in the prophet's reward for the entire message is the prophet's Legacy is that right it doesn't matter if a thousand years go on and his message continues to go that's his legacy and that will go on and as long as you are back of that you will receive your portion of the prophet's reward and I close with this scripture Matthew 25:34 then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come you blessed of my father inherit the Kingdom that was prepared for you from before the foundation of the world aren't you glad that you can inherit that Kingdom praise the Lord I'm being urged here to um just clarify the prophet's reward that is to say brother Brenham explained that every leader every Prophet every one when he comes into the presence of God at the end for his reward then God God will give that Prophet the reward amen that is for him like every believer the Judgment seat of Christ will receive their reward well the prophet will receive his reward that is what the scripture is talking about that even though the prophet is gone and we are here working carrying the message doing the best we can sharing with your neighbor you receive a a portion of the rewards brother Brandon is going to get that is having the prophet's reward or part of the prophet's reward be sure that you receive your portion of the prophet's reward in causing his message to live long grow multiply and bring that last one in for his glory praise God I thank God for this glorious gracious inheritance as a musicians are coming uh I thank God for his spirit that has given to us this word and this message in this hour may God bless every one of you here today and if you're here today and you feel that uh the Holy Spirit has not made clear to you that you're a part of that then I
