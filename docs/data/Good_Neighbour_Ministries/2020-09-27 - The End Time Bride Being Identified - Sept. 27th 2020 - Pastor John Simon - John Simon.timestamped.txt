[11:53] god bless every one of you here today
[11:56] the lord bless you real god
[11:58] [Applause]
[12:01] please be seated
[12:05] it's indeed a privilege to be here with
[12:07] you
[12:09] and to see a lot of your familiar faces
[12:12] i haven't seen for a long time and
[12:16] it's good that we can be together again
[12:19] as i said last week not just together
[12:22] here physically but it reminds us that
[12:25] once we were in the mind of god
[12:29] and we were there together and then
[12:32] we daniel said he saw trones
[12:36] cast down upon the earth
[12:39] and so kings and priests of god came
[12:42] down to the earth
[12:44] and because we didn't have our memory
[12:47] or from spiritual amnesia
[12:51] we could not identify ourselves or
[12:53] remember who we are
[12:56] but by the opening of the word of god
[12:59] we started to get back our our thoughts
[13:02] and our mind
[13:03] of who we really were in the mind of god
[13:07] because he took us back to familiar
[13:10] places
[13:11] meeting familiar people that we once
[13:14] knew
[13:15] back to the old school and the old home
[13:18] and we start to remember and that's the
[13:21] reason why we're excited here this
[13:23] morning
[13:24] because we're not only together
[13:26] spiritually
[13:28] in the world worshiping god but we are
[13:31] here together
[13:32] physically as a family as a people of
[13:35] god
[13:36] gathered in his wonderful precious name
[13:39] so i welcome you in the name of the lord
[13:42] jesus christ thank you very much
[13:44] sisters brother glory to god just
[13:47] so that you uh know we do have
[13:50] a water baptism after the service
[13:54] the preaching of the word we'll have a
[13:56] water baptism
[13:58] uh brother cupid's and sister cupid's
[14:01] daughter the sophia is to be baptized
[14:04] in water of her own desire
[14:09] god bless you real god praise god do you
[14:12] have those things for me brother
[14:15] okay praise the lord so we do have
[14:18] uh baptism certificates for those who
[14:21] have
[14:21] been baptized and the one that will be
[14:25] baptized here today uh brother
[14:29] philip the deacon will do the baptism
[14:33] as quickly as uh he can in water
[14:36] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[14:40] and we give him all the glory and you
[14:42] are honored guests to be witnesses
[14:45] to this water baptism that you are able
[14:47] to witness
[14:48] what god has done and what god is
[14:51] actually doing we're glad to see
[14:54] uh sister van rui here praise the lord
[14:58] back from south africa right praise the
[15:00] lord god bless you real good i know
[15:02] you've been back for a time but i'm only
[15:04] seeing you
[15:05] last week and this week for the first
[15:07] time
[15:08] so it's months i haven't seen her and
[15:10] i'm glad that she could be back
[15:12] in the house of the lord and as you know
[15:15] i've been
[15:17] sharing the word of god online and
[15:21] sharing the word of god online is a
[15:23] little different than
[15:24] speaking in the church itself to
[15:27] believers
[15:29] and of course i knew some brothers
[15:31] didn't understand
[15:32] and i believe that i should go out
[15:34] online and just
[15:35] blast everything that we have in the
[15:38] message
[15:39] but it's not like that you're trying to
[15:41] bring
[15:42] other lost ones in and you're trying to
[15:45] introduce them
[15:47] to the message and so
[15:50] you kind of um put it in such a way
[15:53] that believers can hear and if they
[15:56] listen they can hear
[15:57] also praise the lord praise god but
[16:00] we're glad that we could be here
[16:02] in the house of god and
[16:05] see every one of you
[16:12] and to feast upon the uh
[16:15] word of god angels food menace food
[16:19] uh eagles food whatever you want to call
[16:22] it
[16:22] i'm glad that i could be here in the
[16:25] house of god
[16:26] sharing the word of god with you glory
[16:29] to god today
[16:31] uh i would like to share with you
[16:35] the end time
[16:38] bride of christ identified
[16:43] uh praise god let's read the scripture i
[16:46] i'm ready wanting to go into it
[16:48] so let me read the scripture first of
[16:50] all from john chapter 14
[16:53] verses 19 to 20. i want to thank god
[16:57] for all those who contributed all those
[17:00] who worked
[17:00] all those who did things during the
[17:04] down i mean we're still under it to a
[17:07] certain degree here
[17:08] um but all of you that did whatever it
[17:12] took
[17:13] so that we would be able to have the
[17:15] services
[17:16] today as you could see all the pews are
[17:19] marked
[17:19] and different things have gone into
[17:23] uh practice and we want to thank the
[17:25] lord for that that every one of you
[17:27] are working within those guidelines so
[17:31] that we can come up to whatever
[17:34] standards
[17:35] and beyond whatever government standards
[17:38] they require we are a different kind of
[17:41] people
[17:42] here on a different church
[17:45] because as i said last week the last
[17:48] time we got together here
[17:51] in the house of god they i don't know
[17:54] who it was but
[17:55] right online they were saying a lot of
[17:57] things i mean i was called crazy the
[18:00] people in the church
[18:00] called crazy they're getting church and
[18:04] all this stuff
[18:04] and we're breaking the law and they said
[18:07] the police
[18:08] you might not know that but the police
[18:10] came here and they
[18:11] sat outside in an unmarked car and they
[18:14] did all their counting and watching and
[18:16] everything else
[18:17] and at the end of it they found nothing
[18:20] everything was just absolutely right so
[18:23] they had to go away and
[18:26] and just give their report that
[18:29] everything was fine
[18:30] and so on but i'm saying that so that
[18:33] you can know
[18:34] that even though you don't see anybody
[18:36] you don't hear anybody
[18:38] eyes are upon us all right
[18:41] eyes are on us so let's conduct
[18:43] ourselves
[18:45] uh as as well as we can for the glory of
[18:48] god
[18:48] let us read god's word and then we are
[18:51] going to
[18:52] pray john chapter 14 verses
[18:55] 19 and 20.
[18:58] yet a little while and the world said
[19:02] me no more but ye shall see me
[19:07] because i live ye shall live also
[19:11] at that day you shall know that i
[19:14] am in my father and ye in me
[19:19] and i in you praise god
[19:22] god bless you real good for this word
[19:25] father we thank you for the reading of
[19:27] the word
[19:28] we ask now that the holy spirit
[19:32] will cause the word to move and live
[19:36] within our hearts within our lives so go
[19:39] forth to whoever and wherever you wish
[19:41] it to go
[19:42] for your glory and honor amen and amen
[19:45] god bless you
[19:46] please be seated now of course we know
[19:50] that the the catholic church has been
[19:52] putting
[19:53] wedding bands on the fingers of
[19:57] some people that are called nuns and
[20:00] uh they believe that they are the bride
[20:03] of christ
[20:04] and that they were chosen to be the
[20:06] bride of christ
[20:08] and uh there are uh the baptist
[20:11] methodist different ones they believe
[20:14] they are the bride of jesus christ
[20:18] and so they all making these claims
[20:21] that they have the right doctrine and
[20:23] they have the right word the right
[20:25] promise for the day
[20:27] and that they are the genuine
[20:30] bride of jesus christ
[20:34] the message is here the prophet has
[20:36] preached it
[20:37] and the people of this message the ones
[20:40] that truly believe
[20:42] believe that they are called to be the
[20:44] bride of jesus christ
[20:47] but we end with a problem here kind of a
[20:49] confusion here
[20:51] well who really is this bride of jesus
[20:53] christ
[20:54] that the bible talks about uh
[20:57] how can we just say we are the bride of
[21:00] jesus christ
[21:02] so that is the reason why we have this
[21:04] topic here today
[21:06] the end time bride identified
[21:11] because during his first coming jesus
[21:15] said that the
[21:16] world systems would not recognize him
[21:20] amen but true believers would
[21:24] the bible says he was in the world and
[21:26] the world knew him
[21:27] not but there's many
[21:30] hallelujah that believed him knew him
[21:34] praise god to them he began he gave them
[21:36] power
[21:38] to become the sons of god praise the
[21:41] lord
[21:42] hallelujah so we understand therefore
[21:46] that not that when it says become the
[21:49] sons of god you're now
[21:50] be going to become a son of god but we
[21:53] understand that you will recognize
[21:56] that you already wore a son and that is
[21:59] how
[21:59] you can be known as a son
[22:02] during this time now during this time of
[22:06] his second coming
[22:08] uh through the spoken word
[22:12] of the prophet of malachi 4-5
[22:15] brother william branham we
[22:18] who are seated here today we have
[22:22] recognized by the opening of the word
[22:26] who we are we recognize
[22:30] and we received the word of god within
[22:33] our hearts
[22:35] and that's given us a certainty
[22:38] faith confidence
[22:41] in the recognition of knowing who we are
[22:46] yes indeed we are the supernatural
[22:49] products amen that were produced
[22:54] by the opening of the word of the living
[22:58] god
[23:00] the effect of the word of god upon our
[23:02] lives
[23:04] has transformed us changed us
[23:08] i know when it struck my heart to this
[23:11] very
[23:11] day from glory to glory is
[23:15] changing me for all these years he's
[23:19] been changing me
[23:21] giving me more wisdom more knowledge
[23:23] more understanding
[23:25] of the very word of god and i'm trusting
[23:29] it's the same
[23:30] thing for you today that the word of god
[23:34] is growing you and your understanding is
[23:37] growing
[23:38] and your your whole spirit being is
[23:41] growing
[23:42] so i want to thank god for his word
[23:45] in these marvelous days and times
[23:48] in which we live now we know it produced
[23:51] five supernatural effects within
[23:54] our lives one the creation
[23:58] of the bride hallelujah
[24:02] because remember she was only in spirit
[24:04] form i'm talking about the creation
[24:07] of the brain then the
[24:11] identification of the bride
[24:14] the manifestation of the bride as
[24:18] the son of man in the bright form
[24:22] and the invisible marriage with the
[24:25] bride
[24:26] or uniting time with the bride
[24:30] the oneness of the bride with jesus
[24:33] christ
[24:34] and lastly one of the last effects
[24:37] of the word of god that we have received
[24:40] what it will do
[24:41] is rapture us out of here the rapturing
[24:45] of the bride of jesus christ praise the
[24:47] lord
[24:48] and i believe i'm a part of it
[24:52] now in doing god a service
[24:54] jeffersonville
[24:55] indiana 6-5 page 34
[25:00] brother branham speaking god has
[25:03] promised
[25:04] who's promised god has promised
[25:08] in his word how
[25:11] he would choose his bride the method
[25:14] by which he will choose his bride
[25:17] now in this last day
[25:21] hallelujah did you know that he promised
[25:24] it
[25:25] now let us first of all let me clarify
[25:28] something here jesus said
[25:29] in the scripture we read as a text
[25:32] that in that day there will know
[25:36] hallelujah praise god now change the
[25:40] word
[25:40] day or to age right
[25:44] it's really age in
[25:47] that age they will know
[25:51] there will be a certain age there's an
[25:53] age promise there's an age prophesied
[25:56] there's an age that's supposed to come
[25:58] in which
[25:59] people will know who they are
[26:02] and recognize who they are and in that
[26:05] day they'll know that i am in the father
[26:08] the father and me
[26:09] and i in you
[26:13] i believe we are in that day right now
[26:17] i believe we're living in this day
[26:20] walking in this day
[26:22] by the power of the holy spirit of the
[26:24] living god
[26:26] now he promised it but how would he do
[26:29] it
[26:31] and he will do it by
[26:34] his original plan
[26:38] of choosing christ
[26:41] hallelujah or not just choosing him
[26:45] but choosing the time or the time he
[26:48] would come or be expressed
[26:50] amen choosing the season
[26:54] hallelujah and now he can't
[26:57] miss it on this bride because she
[27:01] is part of the word
[27:04] he can't choose it by a denomination
[27:09] because he did not choose christ by
[27:12] denomination
[27:14] see oh my did christ come to a
[27:17] denomination
[27:19] did he come by a denomination no
[27:22] praise the lord see they rejected him
[27:26] that's what the denomination's done
[27:29] then then when he chooses the brain
[27:32] he can can he come any other way
[27:36] now how did he bring christ here he
[27:39] brought him here by his spoken word
[27:44] by the word of the prophets
[27:48] that is how he brought him here is that
[27:51] right
[27:52] how will he bring his bride here by the
[27:55] word of the prophets that is how he'll
[27:59] bring them here
[28:01] amen how did he identify
[28:04] christ when he come amen
[28:08] by the word of a prophet
[28:11] hallelujah the spirit of elijah
[28:15] upon a man coming out
[28:18] of the wilderness amen
[28:21] he identified him behold the lamb of god
[28:26] that taketh away the sins of the world
[28:30] so will he identify his bride
[28:33] amen by the promised word
[28:36] of malachi 4
[28:40] that he would restore the faith the
[28:43] revelation
[28:44] that the father's had for faith is a
[28:46] revelation
[28:47] he'll restore that revelation back to
[28:50] the believers
[28:51] so that they will recognize in other
[28:53] words he'll restore back their right
[28:55] mind
[28:55] he'll restore to them the mind of christ
[28:58] so
[28:59] they can recognize who they are and who
[29:01] he is
[29:02] praise god and there could be a
[29:04] supernatural
[29:06] oneness by the holy spirit of the living
[29:09] god
[29:09] hallelujah the same thing that he did in
[29:13] the days of sodom
[29:15] is what he does here again do you
[29:17] believe that
[29:19] praise god hallelujah so we understand
[29:23] friends first of all that god creates by
[29:27] his spoken word
[29:30] in the beginning you know that the book
[29:32] of genesis chapter 1 and so on
[29:34] that everything was created by the word
[29:37] of god
[29:39] hallelujah and so we know
[29:42] that the brain also must be created
[29:46] by the word of god remember that i
[29:49] already told you that you were a soul
[29:51] you were a gene you were an
[29:52] attribute you were a spirit being in god
[29:56] you came down here but you have to have
[29:58] a body created that you could live
[29:59] in praise the lord and you come here
[30:03] and you are created together now we talk
[30:06] about that body
[30:07] and then we're talking about the body of
[30:09] christ then we all come together
[30:11] now physically we all look like we're
[30:13] separate seated here distance and all
[30:15] like that
[30:16] but because of the the revelation
[30:19] of the word of god it brings you
[30:22] back into a oneness not only of thought
[30:26] but the oneness of being
[30:28] you're actually one just as much but
[30:31] when god separated eve from adam
[30:35] the bible still said that he called
[30:38] their
[30:38] name adam yet they had their individual
[30:42] names
[30:43] adam eve but when he saw them
[30:46] when they were together he just called
[30:48] them the bible says adam
[30:50] so they had one name and even though we
[30:53] are
[30:53] thousands and thousands of real
[30:55] believers
[30:57] yet we are called christians we are
[30:59] called the brain
[31:01] because we all are baptized in his name
[31:04] we believe in his name we pray in his
[31:06] name we carry his name
[31:09] because there is only one name given
[31:11] under heaven
[31:12] whereby we must be saved but the name of
[31:15] jesus christ
[31:17] and that is the reason why we are one
[31:19] with him
[31:20] for the two who have become one flesh
[31:24] praise god hallelujah praise god
[31:27] so the bride created by the spoken word
[31:31] you can uh also get that out of the
[31:34] hebrews
[31:35] i believe it is chapter 11 by faith we
[31:37] understand the worlds were framed by the
[31:39] word of god and there was nothing made
[31:41] that was not
[31:42] made except by the word of god
[31:44] hallelujah everything is by the word of
[31:47] god
[31:48] so the reason why you're here you heard
[31:52] first of all the word of a prophet
[31:54] and the word of the prophet attracted
[31:56] your attention
[31:58] hallelujah and so you the prophet said
[32:01] did you just walk in here
[32:02] just like that he said do you really
[32:05] think that
[32:06] he says no you did not just walk in here
[32:10] or stumbling here
[32:11] like that you were ordained to hear this
[32:15] hallelujah
[32:16] and that's the reason why you are here
[32:18] today praise
[32:19] god hallelujah other people hear the
[32:22] same thing and they run for cover
[32:25] you heard it and instead of running away
[32:28] from it you run
[32:29] into it oh what a difference to the true
[32:32] child of god
[32:34] the true sons and daughters of the
[32:36] living god
[32:37] that run into the very presence of the
[32:41] lord
[32:42] now you remember how isaiah stood up and
[32:45] said
[32:47] behold a virgin shall conceive and
[32:50] bear a son hallelujah praise god
[32:54] remember isaiah was a prophet and once
[32:57] he spoke the word
[32:59] that word has to come to pass
[33:03] hallelujah so jesus christ was
[33:06] brought here based on the word
[33:10] of a prophet many prophets but i'm using
[33:13] isaiah because
[33:15] the prophecies of jesus christ coming
[33:18] come down through the entire bible from
[33:20] the very beginning
[33:21] genesis 3 18 right but i'm just
[33:24] highlighting isaiah that he said a
[33:27] virgin will conceive
[33:29] and bear a son and his name shall be
[33:33] called
[33:34] jesus hallelujah so the word of god
[33:39] in the moat of a prophet
[33:42] brought jesus christ on the scene
[33:46] hallelujah and the word of god
[33:51] in the mouth of a prophet in our day
[33:55] is prophesied to bring a bride
[33:58] upon the scene praise the lord
[34:01] hallelujah
[34:02] glory to god you'll find backgrounding
[34:05] for that
[34:05] in doing god's service without doing his
[34:08] will
[34:09] page 34 there praise the lord
[34:13] hallelujah amen so friends
[34:17] we understand now the reason for
[34:20] god sending brother branham on the scene
[34:24] the purpose and reason for a 20th
[34:27] century
[34:27] prophet it's not to just show off a man
[34:30] or say oh he's a prophet or
[34:32] oh i believe brother branham that's just
[34:34] what he
[34:35] is but the prophet was sent on the scene
[34:39] that god could have a vessel like he did
[34:43] in the time of israel
[34:45] when he came down on the mountain and he
[34:48] began to speak
[34:49] they were so scared and not only were
[34:52] they so scared
[34:54] just by being on that mountain any
[34:57] animal or person went and touched that
[34:59] mountain the bible said they
[35:00] died and so they got
[35:04] god said to moses okay i i won't
[35:08] come down on the mountain anymore i i'm
[35:11] going to
[35:12] use you as a prophet hallelujah
[35:16] and i'm going to speak through you so
[35:19] they can see somebody like themselves
[35:22] but it won't be that person it will
[35:24] really be me
[35:25] because in those moments when ice begins
[35:29] to speak through
[35:30] that person thus saith the lord
[35:35] that won't be the man that will be me
[35:38] and i'll speak through him and they lord
[35:42] me because
[35:43] every word i speak through him will come
[35:46] to pass
[35:48] every word i speak through him
[35:51] is going to create things
[35:55] and it will come to pass and so we
[35:58] understand
[35:59] brother branham was a predestinated
[36:02] vessel
[36:03] to be here in this age so that when
[36:06] god wanted to fulfill that prophecy
[36:09] of malachi 4 5 of uh
[36:13] joel 2 or he wanted to fulfill
[36:16] uh revelation 3 and so on and
[36:19] other scriptures he had a vessel
[36:22] already predestinated and placed on the
[36:25] earth
[36:26] that he could come to and use to
[36:29] manifest himself through
[36:32] hallelujah now that is why
[36:35] when brother branham went and he spoke
[36:38] the word
[36:40] and uh you know let there be a squirrel
[36:44] and there was a squirrel on a branch
[36:47] and he says no i'm imagining well
[36:50] speak again and see what's going to
[36:52] happen if it's just imagination or it's
[36:54] real
[36:55] so he said let there be another there's
[36:57] a squirrel
[36:58] so he got more confidence let there be
[37:00] and he spoke about i think it's five of
[37:02] them
[37:03] anyway he spoke them all into existence
[37:06] hallelujah of course god revealed to him
[37:09] what that was
[37:11] god was revealing to him now this is the
[37:13] third pull
[37:14] and this is not going to be just you
[37:16] talking to the people under the first
[37:18] and second pull healing and miracles
[37:20] just to attract their attention
[37:22] but i'm gonna be here now to talk
[37:24] through you directly to my own bride
[37:28] okay and uh and and so i'm gonna
[37:31] pull them by the opening of the word
[37:34] i'm going to pull them in by the opening
[37:36] of the word so therefore
[37:39] god began to use brother branham and he
[37:42] goes to sister
[37:44] hattie wright is that right yes how many
[37:47] knows her name
[37:47] hati right amen and he said you know the
[37:52] other day sister hattie and he told
[37:54] her tells her what happened and
[37:56] everything else
[37:57] she said what do you think about that
[37:59] and she said oh that's
[38:01] absolutely right brother branham
[38:04] hattie wright said he was right and
[38:06] right away she got the right birth
[38:09] and she got the right birth for her sons
[38:12] praise god
[38:14] hallelujah and so brothers
[38:17] what brother branham i won't go into the
[38:20] fact that he spoke about the
[38:21] resurrection of the fish
[38:22] when he gives the life to the fish and
[38:25] receive your life on the fish that was
[38:27] dead
[38:27] came to life again it was god in him
[38:31] illustrating this is not just a man
[38:35] it's not just the word of a man now i'm
[38:37] not saying brother branham wasn't a man
[38:39] he was a man
[38:40] but the being that started to operate
[38:43] through him
[38:44] at that point in time was not just
[38:47] brother branham it was god himself
[38:50] and so uh praise the lord he says
[38:54] oh what do you think she said well
[38:57] that's right
[38:58] but she you see she was more right than
[39:00] she thought
[39:02] because what he was showing to her that
[39:05] is how he's going to be creating his
[39:07] brain
[39:09] by the message the spoken word
[39:13] being revealed through a prophet
[39:16] and making himself known
[39:19] so this bride this group
[39:23] this little flock what brings her
[39:25] together
[39:26] we don't even know each other we come
[39:29] from different parts of the world
[39:31] different races different cultures
[39:33] different standards and status and
[39:35] everything else we would have never met
[39:38] or
[39:38] known each other except by the
[39:41] supernatural hand of god
[39:45] so we are brought here today
[39:48] as a manifestation of the word of god
[39:52] and the will and purpose of god we are
[39:55] here in the plan of god
[39:58] we are here in the day and the time the
[40:01] age
[40:02] the season in which he promised by his
[40:04] word
[40:05] that we would be here and it seems so
[40:09] simple that we can take it for ordinary
[40:12] but you are
[40:12] not here by chance you are here by
[40:16] thus saith the lord
[40:21] hallelujah you're here by
[40:25] the word of the living god hallelujah
[40:29] praise god hallelujah thank god
[40:32] so by the prophet coming and bringing
[40:35] the message of the hour he was
[40:39] bringing the end time pride
[40:42] on the scene bringing her
[40:46] hallelujah and just as the
[40:49] prophet spoke of him they
[40:53] spoke of us because
[40:57] jewel chapter 2 i
[41:00] will restore for you to restore you got
[41:04] to already have something and it got
[41:06] away from you or it fall away or went
[41:08] somewhere
[41:09] and then you're going to restore it back
[41:10] to where it was if something was lost it
[41:13] mean you once had it
[41:15] and then you lost it and now you're
[41:17] trying to get it back
[41:18] but we were lost but now we are found
[41:22] by the grace of god we have found
[41:25] hallelujah
[41:27] [Applause]
[41:28] the holy spirit has haunted us
[41:32] the great eagle flew across the entire
[41:36] world of billions of people and in the
[41:39] billions of people one in a million
[41:42] praise
[41:42] god he found you he found you he found
[41:46] you
[41:46] every one of you he found you by the
[41:49] grace of god
[41:50] that is the reason why you're here today
[41:54] hallelujah no brother simon but i still
[41:56] make mistakes
[41:57] you see that's the catholic view that
[42:00] they put out in the world
[42:02] that you got to be a physically
[42:04] outwardly perfect person
[42:07] before you can be called a saint but in
[42:10] the bible we find that paul
[42:12] constantly calling those believers
[42:13] saints
[42:15] is that right and then he goes to
[42:17] another chapter and he says
[42:18] how come you got wars and fightings
[42:20] amongst you
[42:22] how come you guys are arguing with one
[42:24] another
[42:25] how come when himself and barnabas and
[42:28] the other one had to go on a missionary
[42:30] trip
[42:30] and he said why don't you take mark with
[42:32] you he says no i don't want to take him
[42:34] with me as a troublemaker
[42:36] and the bible says that they got to such
[42:38] physical
[42:39] struggle those two apostles almost
[42:44] physically came against one another
[42:46] that's why paul said yeah we are
[42:48] christians we can be angry
[42:50] but sin not it's not that you can't be
[42:53] angry you don't have to go
[42:54] wrong as an actor now trying
[42:58] to give a outward view that you are a
[43:01] real
[43:01] christian so you don't get angry
[43:04] you always got to have patience you show
[43:07] the same
[43:08] virtues of love and broadly kindness
[43:12] and we ought to show it but not
[43:14] naturally
[43:15] trying to show it not naturally trying
[43:18] to put it on
[43:19] you just relax let the holy spirit show
[43:21] it through you
[43:23] let him relax let him manifest his self
[43:25] through you
[43:26] amen praise the lord if i if i don't
[43:29] agree with you
[43:30] with something you're doing i said well
[43:31] brother i don't like that i don't think
[43:33] that's
[43:34] that's exactly right praise god there's
[43:36] nothing wrong with that
[43:38] praise the lord hallelujah and we allow
[43:41] the holy spirit to have his way
[43:44] but we are not here to be religious
[43:46] actors
[43:48] we are not in general hospital we are
[43:51] not in one of these shows
[43:53] that you have on tv we are in the
[43:56] greatest
[43:57] drama of redemption praise
[44:00] god hallelujah the love of christ for
[44:02] his bride
[44:04] oh he loved her from before the
[44:05] foundation of the world
[44:08] and he loved our entire truth the entire
[44:10] time
[44:11] and he still loves her today and is that
[44:15] is why he died for our sins
[44:18] to redeem us back to him
[44:21] praise the lord just like the little boy
[44:23] who lost his boat
[44:26] and he bought it from the pawn shop
[44:29] went to sail it and some contrary wind
[44:32] got a hold of it and took it away and he
[44:34] lost it
[44:35] somebody got a hold of it brought the
[44:38] boat
[44:38] and sold it into the pawn shop
[44:42] for them to be able to make a profit off
[44:44] of it and as he was going by one day he
[44:47] noticed his boat
[44:48] in the pawn shop it is his boss
[44:53] but he still has to go and buy the boat
[44:56] he still has to pay the price
[44:58] for the boat he still has to pay the
[45:01] redemption
[45:02] price for the boat and so he went into
[45:05] the shop
[45:06] sold enough newspapers got his little
[45:09] money together praised god forevermore
[45:13] hallelujah and there he took
[45:16] his money and went and bought that boat
[45:21] when the owner gave him that little boat
[45:24] he took the boat clutched this to his
[45:26] little breast and said
[45:27] now you're mine but now you are twice
[45:31] mine
[45:33] you must be born again i said you must
[45:36] be
[45:37] born again born by the holy spirit
[45:41] you belong to him but yet because you
[45:44] were lost
[45:45] he had to pay the redemption price to
[45:48] bring you
[45:48] back unto himself aren't you happy this
[45:50] morning
[45:52] aren't you glad that you belong to him
[45:56] hallelujah jesus said john 10 16
[46:00] are the sheep i have that are not of
[46:04] this fold praise god them also i must
[46:07] bring
[46:08] glory to god hallelujah paul said
[46:11] we are better grafted in branch
[46:15] israel the jewish people they
[46:18] are the true vine and we are a
[46:20] grafted-in branch
[46:22] we have life by the same god the same
[46:26] jehovah
[46:27] we receive life praise god hallelujah
[46:31] and luke spoke how that god
[46:34] in the book of acts would call out of
[46:36] the gentiles
[46:38] a people that he would marry a people
[46:41] for his
[46:42] name he would have a people
[46:45] that would take on his name glory to god
[46:49] all these are prophecies of the coming
[46:52] of the bride he expected to have
[46:56] a brain and then we find in revelation
[46:59] john on the isle of patmos revelation
[47:02] 3 14-22 revelation
[47:05] 19 1-9 and revelation
[47:08] 21 1 to 9
[47:12] you will find uh john speaking of this
[47:15] brain
[47:17] he said and i heard a noise as it were
[47:20] of
[47:20] thunder amen and a rumbling and a
[47:24] thundering
[47:26] like the voice of many waters and i
[47:29] looked and when i looked i saw thousands
[47:33] yet
[47:33] thousands upon ten thousands numberless
[47:37] hallelujah oh and a voice from the
[47:41] temple
[47:41] crying out hallelujah the marriage of
[47:45] the lamb
[47:46] has come and all his wife
[47:50] has made herself ready glory to god
[47:53] hallelujah oh praise god forevermore
[47:56] brother sister all the billions millions
[48:00] of people
[48:01] that are the believers of this world
[48:04] wherever they are
[48:05] whether dead or alive they're crying out
[48:08] worthy is the lamb that was lame worthy
[48:12] is the lamb that was slain
[48:14] praise be the god and their voices going
[48:17] forth
[48:17] like thunder and lightning in this day
[48:20] and in this hour how happy to be that we
[48:24] are a part of this
[48:26] so various prophets speak in the word
[48:30] bringing forth a bride out of god's
[48:34] word remember i said out of god's word
[48:38] just as much as eve out of adam
[48:42] praise the lord and then when she got
[48:44] herself
[48:45] messed up with the serpent and as we
[48:48] could say
[48:49] lost her way then
[48:52] god had to bring her back
[48:55] hallelujah bring her back to adam's side
[49:00] this is the hour when we are all being
[49:02] brought back to his side
[49:05] to fit back to that place where we are
[49:08] supposed to be
[49:09] because as his great masterpiece
[49:12] was struck and a part of it broke off
[49:16] and was lost in time so he has to come
[49:19] back
[49:20] in time by his grace find that missing
[49:24] piece
[49:25] all praise god and fit it right
[49:28] back where it comes from but
[49:31] hallelujah during that time satan tried
[49:34] to make all kinds of counterfeit and
[49:36] copycats
[49:37] but you know when something breaks off
[49:40] you can't break it off with a certain
[49:42] special pattern
[49:44] and so when you take that and try to fit
[49:47] it back
[49:48] that in itself is a mystery and when you
[49:51] take it and fill it back
[49:53] only that piece that was broken off
[49:55] could really fit back into that spot
[49:58] praise god you remember the chinese tag
[50:02] how the chinese i can remember that way
[50:05] back
[50:05] praise god when they would just tear a
[50:08] piece of paper
[50:09] because at that time they came over they
[50:11] couldn't speak
[50:12] english it was just chinese and the only
[50:15] way they could
[50:16] identify a person's clothing is to tear
[50:19] a tag
[50:20] and each tag is torn a certain way
[50:23] and you can't bring a fake and try to
[50:26] fit it it's not going to fit
[50:28] only the genuine real one that was torn
[50:31] a certain way
[50:32] and a pattern a certain way is going to
[50:34] fit the other one
[50:36] so down with the impersonators down with
[50:39] the copycats down with the actors
[50:41] down with all of those who try to make
[50:44] up something
[50:45] and call themselves that it will not fit
[50:49] it would fit because the holy spirit
[50:52] himself
[50:52] being the other half when the thing
[50:54] comes together
[50:56] oh praise god that deep crawls to the
[50:59] deep
[50:59] and the deep must respond because the
[51:02] two are one praise
[51:03] god hallelujah amen and then we find out
[51:09] friends that when we heard this word of
[51:13] god
[51:14] it sounded so familiar to us
[51:17] even though we never heard it before but
[51:20] something in the deep of you that fits
[51:24] me
[51:25] that's exactly the truth that's right
[51:29] listen the first time i heard anything
[51:32] about the serpent seed i didn't even
[51:33] understand it
[51:35] but something in here tell me that's
[51:37] right
[51:38] when i heard about one god not three
[51:41] because i mean
[51:42] i i was in the uh bible uh
[51:45] college and you know you hear all humor
[51:48] suicide the greek for this and
[51:50] the oneness of god of one substance and
[51:52] so on so on
[51:53] my goodness and then all at once you
[51:56] heard
[51:57] hero israel the lord thy god is
[52:00] one lord and when did god change his
[52:04] mind about that
[52:06] where does he say that anywhere in the
[52:09] bible he changed his mind that i'm no
[52:10] more
[52:11] one i am now three i don't think one is
[52:14] a good number
[52:15] so i need to be break myself up in the
[52:18] tree
[52:19] no it's the same one god
[52:22] but he has offices
[52:25] i'm a father i'm a son
[52:29] and i'm a pastor it doesn't make me
[52:31] treat people
[52:33] i'm the same person but i'm in three
[52:35] offices
[52:36] it's the same way god came as his own
[52:40] son
[52:40] in other words he created the body that
[52:42] he could go into it
[52:44] that's why he said the father that
[52:45] dwells in me he does the works
[52:48] amen god in christ christ in the church
[52:51] the kingdom of god being restored back
[52:54] hallelujah amen that's the reason why
[52:58] we are gutted here together in his
[53:00] mighty name praise god hallelujah
[53:03] so we say we can say friends
[53:08] that the elijah spirit of malachi 4 5
[53:11] was one of those prophetic beings
[53:15] that was sent down here that
[53:19] would have a message that would
[53:22] call out the bride out of the masses
[53:26] he would call out the bride chose her
[53:28] called her
[53:29] amen and then by the spoken word
[53:32] reconstitute restore recreate
[53:36] the body of christ again in bright form
[53:39] the son of man being revealed in this
[53:42] day and in this hour
[53:43] oh praise god forevermore hallelujah
[53:47] and then i look and i see myself in
[53:49] there
[53:50] and realize that in our day we have seen
[53:54] a new creation my father worked hitherto
[53:58] natural creation and now i work
[54:01] spiritual supernatural creation
[54:03] by the spoken word of the living god
[54:05] hallelujah
[54:07] can you say it in your creation
[54:12] hallelujah by god's spoken word
[54:17] say it again i'm a new creation
[54:21] my god-spoken word
[54:24] i'm a new creation
[54:27] i'm a brand new man
[54:30] old things have passed away
[54:33] i am born again
[54:36] more than a conqueror
[54:40] that's what i am
[54:43] i'm a new creation i'm a brand new man
[54:48] hallelujah that's wonderful
[54:52] but that's not all that the spoken word
[54:56] does hallelujah praise god
[55:00] and what it does of course is wonderful
[55:02] marvelous and it's also
[55:04] thrilling the spoken word
[55:07] creates the bride but it identifies
[55:12] the bride of who she is
[55:15] now remember it's not whether or not
[55:19] you or i say i'm in the bride i'm a
[55:21] christian
[55:22] i am this i'm not you can say whatever
[55:24] you want but the bible tells
[55:26] us that when there was a dispute between
[55:29] cain and abel
[55:30] the bible says god answered abel by
[55:34] setting his
[55:35] sacrifice on fire the bible says
[55:39] nadia about testifying but god testified
[55:42] of his gifts praise the lord now god
[55:46] will testify
[55:47] of his gift to you because
[55:51] unto you he gave what the gift of
[55:53] eternal life
[55:55] you have received the greatest gift
[55:57] which is the gift of eternal life
[56:00] and god will testify that the life
[56:03] that is in you i gave that life
[56:08] that is supernatural life that is not
[56:11] church life that is not religious life
[56:15] that is not theological life that is not
[56:18] a religious science life that is
[56:21] my life my original life
[56:25] eternal life that is a part of me
[56:29] there is nothing eternal there's only
[56:31] one eternal
[56:33] and i give up part of myself in you and
[56:36] i'm gonna testify of my life that is in
[56:38] you praise god
[56:40] oh the spoken word identifies the bride
[56:43] of christ
[56:45] [Applause]
[56:46] hallelujah praise god amen
[56:50] now jesus was spoken of by the prophets
[56:53] manifested
[56:54] by the word of the prophets but when
[56:57] he got here even though he knew who he
[57:01] was
[57:02] to the people around about the masses
[57:06] of israel they didn't know who he was
[57:10] so he was unidentified
[57:14] he was the bible says he was amongst
[57:17] them and they
[57:18] knew him not and now it's come down to
[57:22] his bride
[57:24] that she in the world
[57:27] she looks like everybody else he looked
[57:29] like everybody else he was just a man
[57:31] and he was and we are and we're not
[57:33] special
[57:35] better than anybody else but it's
[57:37] something
[57:38] that is in us and we didn't choose it
[57:43] he chose us i don't know why he would
[57:47] choose me
[57:48] i may use the words i think like me but
[57:51] but he chose me and he lives in me
[57:55] and i want to thank god for that
[57:57] choosing
[57:59] and that he lives inside of me but here
[58:02] we find out that
[58:03] jesus was in the world the unrecognized
[58:08] presence of god in the world
[58:13] the unrecognized presence of almighty
[58:16] god
[58:18] and so is the true child of the living
[58:20] god
[58:21] when god takes a whole of their soul
[58:25] that they become the unrecognized
[58:28] presence
[58:29] of almighty god because they make
[58:32] mistakes like anybody else's stumble
[58:34] they go through trials they
[58:36] pressure there's nothing different to
[58:39] you than anybody
[58:40] else praise god but there's something
[58:43] inside of you that's what makes you
[58:46] different
[58:48] it's not by your long prayers or you're
[58:50] much praying or the big bible at your
[58:52] arm or going around all the claims you
[58:55] can make
[58:56] you can say whatever you want but if he
[58:58] says you
[58:59] are then you are
[59:02] how could i be i'm making this mistake
[59:05] i'm doing that
[59:06] i don't even feel like i am or whatever
[59:08] that's
[59:09] fine that's you but he says you are
[59:13] and i believe you are who god says you
[59:16] are
[59:18] [Applause]
[59:22] you are who god says you are
[59:25] not who you think you are who you feel
[59:28] you are
[59:29] then you're going by feelings you're
[59:30] going by your own thoughts you're going
[59:31] by this you're going by that you're
[59:33] being swayed
[59:33] but there's one god and his word doesn't
[59:36] change
[59:38] amen hallelujah so here
[59:41] unknown unrecognized walking through
[59:44] this world
[59:46] to the people around about him what are
[59:49] you talking about
[59:50] i know you aren't you jesus the
[59:52] carpenter's son
[59:55] i mean i know your mother mary i know
[59:58] your brothers joses and
[1:00:00] and so on i know them so so what is this
[1:00:03] you're
[1:00:04] claiming now how could you be messiah
[1:00:06] how could you be so
[1:00:08] and so because i know you praise god
[1:00:11] isn't that the same thing today
[1:00:14] i know you i even saw when you made a
[1:00:17] mistake bill
[1:00:18] huh i saw when you made a mistake
[1:00:21] i said i heard you when you said this or
[1:00:23] said that
[1:00:25] that's fine you're seeing all that
[1:00:27] you're hearing all that and you could
[1:00:28] say all that
[1:00:29] but oh not of my will but of his
[1:00:32] choosing
[1:00:35] his election that he elected us
[1:00:39] hallelujah he was absolutely
[1:00:42] the sun the body the vessel that god was
[1:00:45] using in that day
[1:00:47] but he was yet unidentified
[1:00:51] hallelujah but it was most essential
[1:00:54] that he be identified that he was the
[1:00:58] one
[1:00:59] that the prophets were speaking of
[1:01:01] during all this time
[1:01:03] and it's essential that we be identified
[1:01:07] as the one spoken of in
[1:01:11] revelation 3 revelation
[1:01:14] 21 so on so on all praise god
[1:01:18] we must be identified by the great
[1:01:21] holy spirit now how
[1:01:24] was jesus identified he was
[1:01:28] identified by the word of a prophet
[1:01:32] and that prophet happened to be john
[1:01:35] the baptist you'll know the story
[1:01:39] how john when he reached i believe it
[1:01:42] was around nine years old or something
[1:01:44] like that
[1:01:44] he felt the moving of the spirit of god
[1:01:47] upon him left his home left his parents
[1:01:49] and everything else he thought he was a
[1:01:51] mad man
[1:01:52] went into the wilderness and if you ever
[1:01:54] saw the wilderness in the middle east
[1:01:56] there is no trees hardly there is
[1:01:58] nothing there's no grass
[1:02:00] you can hardly find water and all this
[1:02:02] stuff and snakes and scorpions and
[1:02:04] everything else and like that and he
[1:02:08] wandered away and went in the wilderness
[1:02:10] and
[1:02:11] literally grew up there in the
[1:02:13] wilderness amongst all of these wild
[1:02:15] beasts and wild animals
[1:02:18] and all he knew was the voice of god
[1:02:22] you see god took him away from all those
[1:02:24] rabbinical schools all those educated
[1:02:27] talks
[1:02:27] nothing's wrong with wisdom education or
[1:02:30] anything like that
[1:02:30] but i'm saying god him to be a prophet
[1:02:34] his mind could not be contaminated with
[1:02:37] men's thoughts men's ideas
[1:02:40] men's direction of looking at things he
[1:02:43] had to have a pure
[1:02:44] clean mind and so god took him away from
[1:02:48] everything so that he would only see and
[1:02:50] hear god's voice
[1:02:51] and god's point of view so that when he
[1:02:54] began to speak
[1:02:56] he would speak things as how god saw it
[1:03:00] not
[1:03:00] as he saw it but as god saw it amen
[1:03:03] so praise god so then we see
[1:03:07] that he jesus had to be identified
[1:03:12] and the bride must be identified
[1:03:16] praise god hallelujah now
[1:03:19] this man john with the spirit of elijah
[1:03:24] upon him and god
[1:03:27] used him in a mighty way
[1:03:31] until one day when jesus was coming down
[1:03:33] by the river
[1:03:35] praise god i'm going to wind things up
[1:03:36] in another 5-10 minutes
[1:03:40] then he looked on him and
[1:03:44] he pointed him out this is not the
[1:03:46] identification of jesus christ
[1:03:48] behold the lamb of god
[1:03:52] that taketh away the sins of the world
[1:03:55] the same man that you thought was
[1:03:57] ordinary the same guy that you felt was
[1:03:59] your schoolmate and all this oh no
[1:04:01] there's something upon
[1:04:03] him that's anointing him that makes him
[1:04:06] different
[1:04:08] amen and so god used john at that time
[1:04:11] well what i'm saying is that god
[1:04:14] promised according to malachi 4
[1:04:16] 5 that in the last day
[1:04:19] this last day that jesus spoke of in our
[1:04:22] text
[1:04:23] the last age or season
[1:04:26] he would send a prophet to the gentiles
[1:04:31] remember all the prophets were jews
[1:04:35] but he was going to call out the gentile
[1:04:37] people for his name
[1:04:39] and so he was obligated to send at least
[1:04:42] one
[1:04:42] gentile prophet and that is why i
[1:04:46] believe
[1:04:47] and teach william marion branham
[1:04:50] is that prophet that fulfilled malachi 4
[1:04:54] 5. and god sent
[1:04:57] him on the scene to speak his word
[1:05:01] and to create a bride and to identify a
[1:05:06] bride
[1:05:08] i didn't make it plain to you but just
[1:05:10] as he spoke with squirrels into
[1:05:12] existence
[1:05:12] that was just to illustrate how that his
[1:05:15] word his message
[1:05:17] would eventually create a bride
[1:05:22] we were the squirrels were just a type
[1:05:25] or symbol of us
[1:05:27] being created by the spoken word and so
[1:05:30] here we are
[1:05:31] by the spoken word of the living god
[1:05:35] hallelujah
[1:05:37] amen so jesus christ was identified
[1:05:40] by the spoken word of god in an anointed
[1:05:44] man of the living god hallelujah
[1:05:48] now praise god hallelujah oh
[1:05:51] my i tell you how wonderful it is to
[1:05:54] know
[1:05:54] that he's the same yesterday today
[1:05:58] and forever glory to god i believe i'm
[1:06:02] going to stop here
[1:06:03] now i know it's kind of sharp and short
[1:06:06] but
[1:06:06] i just feel that i need to stop
[1:06:10] at this particular point and for us to
[1:06:12] begin to prepare ourselves
[1:06:13] for this water baptism that we are going
[1:06:17] to have here
[1:06:18] is that okay with you
[1:06:24] remember i can always continue uh next
[1:06:27] week or something
[1:06:28] uh like that with the word of god that
[1:06:31] we have here
[1:06:32] and we want to thank god for this young
[1:06:34] person
[1:06:35] and it's beautiful this did not happen
[1:06:38] during a time while there in the church
[1:06:40] where somebody can say well your
[1:06:42] influence as the preacher
[1:06:44] you influence the young person or or
[1:06:46] something like that but
[1:06:48] this is when these young people were
[1:06:51] away
[1:06:52] they were not in the church and
[1:06:55] it's not like their parents preaching to
[1:06:57] them
[1:06:59] they must have been thinking of what
[1:07:02] they were hearing
[1:07:03] and reading listening and they
[1:07:06] come to a conclusion themselves
[1:07:10] so it's a personal decision
[1:07:13] personal choice that they have made
[1:07:16] to uh commit themselves
[1:07:20] and save you jesus christ and i want to
[1:07:22] get let's give them a hand not just her
[1:07:25] but
[1:07:25] them all of those that give their lives
[1:07:27] to jesus christ
[1:07:28] and were baptized in this name god bless
[1:07:30] every one of you
[1:07:31] [Applause]
[1:07:39] i want to thank god that brother philip
[1:07:41] is getting ready too
[1:07:42] right okay praise the lord i i just want
[1:07:45] to thank god brother mike could you
[1:07:47] maybe come back up here uh lean a few
[1:07:50] songs
[1:07:50] uh prepare the atmosphere um for these
[1:07:54] here
[1:07:54] uh let's try to creep keep it crisp and
[1:07:58] sharp and uh and short and detailed
[1:08:01] right to the timing
[1:08:02] so that we can be out of here as we
[1:08:06] propose okay praise the lord so i want
[1:08:09] to thank god for
[1:08:10] all of them and so sophia comes today
[1:08:13] by god's grace to be baptized in water
[1:08:16] and in this day when young people are
[1:08:19] bearing
[1:08:19] the brunt of all of the pressures
[1:08:23] of our age whether it's social
[1:08:27] psychological cultural whatever
[1:08:30] governmental economic and so on all
[1:08:34] these pressures are
[1:08:35] coming upon them and i tell you it's
[1:08:39] the pressure they have to bear is more
[1:08:41] than we ever had
[1:08:44] we thought we had pressure and we did
[1:08:46] but it's nothing to compare
[1:08:48] with what they have to bear now
[1:08:52] so let me say this let's do all we can
[1:08:54] to help them
[1:08:59] do i have an amen over here praise the
[1:09:02] lord
[1:09:02] let's do all we can to help them
[1:09:06] i mean i can go on speaking we know of
[1:09:08] course some of them
[1:09:09] just drop all their weight on you
[1:09:13] so well you brought me here you have to
[1:09:15] take care of me
[1:09:19] right and they're others with other
[1:09:21] excuses
[1:09:22] but it doesn't matter the fact is
[1:09:26] they're carrying more than we ever had
[1:09:29] to carry
[1:09:30] and they do a lot of foolish things
[1:09:32] unwise things sometimes
[1:09:35] that's part of learning to walk right
[1:09:38] you don't go and whip your child or
[1:09:42] come against your child because the baby
[1:09:44] is now trying to walk and it fell down
[1:09:48] it's trying to talk and it misplaced the
[1:09:50] words
[1:09:51] no failure is just a part
[1:09:55] of success and it's just a part of
[1:09:57] growing
[1:09:58] so therefore let's help them do as much
[1:10:01] as we can
[1:10:02] for them that they might be able to grow
[1:10:06] and walk as mature persons
[1:10:10] for the glory of god okay brother
[1:10:14] this is brother phillip bobbier
[1:10:18] and he will be doing the baptism this is
[1:10:21] sofia

[1:10:28] who wants to make sure he has the
[1:10:31] picture of his daughter being baptized
[1:10:33] in water
[1:10:41] it's over to you now brother philip you
[1:10:43] can speak louder
[1:10:44] [Music]
[1:10:50] [Music]
[1:10:52] i believe the greatest thing that could
[1:10:54] ever happen to anyone
[1:10:56] and so far which means wisdom i believe
[1:10:59] made the right choice today
[1:11:01] and before i go ahead and we all know
[1:11:04] that baptism does not save
[1:11:06] it's time that she's doing today

[1:12:03] apostles

[1:12:08] then peter said unto them repent

[1:12:19] remission
