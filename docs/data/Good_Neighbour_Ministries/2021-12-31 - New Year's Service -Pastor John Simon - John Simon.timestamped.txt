[28:41] that i love
[28:42] her and i love each one that's gathered

[57:00] when i was asked to do this

[57:09] but then these words came to me
[57:14] we overcome our enemy
[57:16] by the blood of the lamb and the word
[57:19] of our testimony
[57:21] and here i am tonight my friends
[57:25] amen

[57:28] tonight by
[57:30] the grace of god
[57:32] so i give him all the honor
[57:34] the glory and the praise
[57:36] thank you
[57:39] for those who do not know me i am farida
[57:43] fallon
[57:44] i was born in trinidad to a muslim
[57:48] family muslim ancestors
[57:51] we are seven siblings
[57:53] i'm the middle child
[57:55] i worked in the trinidad government
[57:58] service for 12 years with the ministry
[58:01] of health
[58:02] and
[58:03] with the ministry of education as a
[58:05] registered teacher prior to migrating to
[58:08] canada
[58:10] i thought i would pursue teaching
[58:13] but i ended up in banking
[58:16] the royal bank and i'm still there for
[58:18] 25 years
[58:20] so from teaching to banking
[58:23] but i believe god had been there for a
[58:25] reason and a purpose
[58:27] so
[58:28] that's me in a nutshell
[58:32] now for my most important part of my
[58:35] life
[58:36] my spiritual conversion and work in
[58:39] christ
[58:42] all
[58:43] started through the great influence of
[58:46] my mom
[58:48] my dad was a wealthy well-known
[58:51] businessman
[58:52] but you know the three things that
[58:54] brother branham spoke about
[58:58] money women and popularity well that was
[59:01] my dad
[59:03] so
[59:04] for my mom it was during these difficult
[59:07] times of trials and tribulation she was
[59:10] introduced to the lord
[59:12] and to the message of the hour
[59:15] it was only then she found peace
[59:18] and a purpose in life
[59:21] so i was exposed
[59:23] to the message at a ten day age of nine
[59:27] she would take us to church and would be
[59:29] and
[59:31] and she would open her home for
[59:33] ministers
[59:34] and ministers like brother finn
[59:37] and others would be preaching at our
[59:39] home
[59:41] even then i did not accept the lord i
[59:46] would sometimes go to parties
[59:48] and disco in those days
[59:51] and wanted to experience the life out
[59:54] there
[59:55] thinking that the christian thing is for
[59:59] old people
[1:00:01] not me i was still young
[1:00:04] and i still can enjoy life
[1:00:08] and i was saying to myself when i get
[1:00:10] older
[1:00:11] maybe later on in life i will accept the
[1:00:14] lord
[1:00:15] in my head i know i would preserve
[1:00:18] myself as a lady
[1:00:20] that's what that
[1:00:22] was me and that was my mentality then
[1:00:26] one day
[1:00:27] coming home from work
[1:00:29] on the highway a vehicle suddenly ran
[1:00:32] off the road on the other side coming
[1:00:35] towards our vehicle
[1:00:37] it spun around it hit another vehicle
[1:00:40] and it was coming towards us
[1:00:44] the other occupants in the vehicle were
[1:00:47] screaming i shouted
[1:00:49] my lord
[1:00:51] oh
[1:00:52] my
[1:00:53] this is it i'm done the vehicle stopped
[1:00:55] right in front of me
[1:00:57] without hitting us
[1:00:59] everything happened so quickly
[1:01:02] that in a matter of seconds i could have
[1:01:04] been gone
[1:01:06] my life was spared this really shook me
[1:01:09] up
[1:01:10] it jolted me
[1:01:12] god spared my life
[1:01:14] it was a wednesday when i got home i
[1:01:17] told my mom
[1:01:18] i am going to church with you tonight
[1:01:22] this time she didn't have to force me to
[1:01:24] go
[1:01:25] that night
[1:01:26] i stood up and i gave my
[1:01:31] first ever testimony of how
[1:01:34] god saved my life
[1:01:36] of how he saved me from this serious
[1:01:40] accident
[1:01:42] i said god i could have died not knowing
[1:01:45] where i would have ended up in heaven or
[1:01:48] in hell
[1:01:49] i told the church it was a scary thought
[1:01:53] yes my mom has been praying for her
[1:01:55] children day and night and pleading the
[1:01:57] blood over us
[1:02:01] but
[1:02:02] my work was not one to warrant going to
[1:02:05] heaven
[1:02:06] i said no more parties
[1:02:09] no more waiting until i get old
[1:02:12] this thing is real
[1:02:14] i know now i have to make a change in
[1:02:16] life i had to surrender
[1:02:19] or my all to him
[1:02:21] to the one who died for me
[1:02:23] i call this a spiritual awakening for me
[1:02:28] i looked over the pews and i saw my mom
[1:02:31] sitting there in tears her prayers were
[1:02:34] answered
[1:02:36] so my brother who is now a minister an
[1:02:40] assistant to brother greene
[1:02:42] and i we both got baptized on the same
[1:02:44] day
[1:02:45] on
[1:02:46] 14th of july 1985.
[1:02:50] my spiritual birthday my new booth
[1:02:54] this was the best thing that ever
[1:02:56] happened to me
[1:02:57] the best decision i have ever made
[1:03:01] my this for wanting to know more of god
[1:03:04] and reading the prophet's messages grew
[1:03:07] and have truly found my first love
[1:03:11] going to church now both for my brother
[1:03:14] and i without being forced and it was
[1:03:16] more for joy than a burden
[1:03:19] praise the lord
[1:03:21] a couple of months later
[1:03:23] a gentleman in the church approached me
[1:03:26] and asked my mom for my hand in
[1:03:28] marriage this is what my mom said reply
[1:03:32] she's of age she can speak for herself
[1:03:37] i of course was taken by surprise and
[1:03:40] thought i could not say yes until i know
[1:03:43] for sure this is what god wants for me
[1:03:48] now i have a serious decision an
[1:03:50] important one to make
[1:03:52] so i took three days off from work
[1:03:55] and i fasted and prayed and spent the
[1:03:57] time
[1:03:58] praying and asking the lord i said god i
[1:04:02] was not looking for this right now
[1:04:05] i do not know
[1:04:06] the answer
[1:04:08] you know everything you know my future
[1:04:11] i want your perfect will in my life
[1:04:14] and i was really honest to the lord i
[1:04:16] said lord please show me
[1:04:18] before the third day
[1:04:20] i got the confirmation from the lord i
[1:04:23] said yes my mom was very happy because
[1:04:26] she would be telling us about being
[1:04:29] unequally yoked
[1:04:31] about the pains of marriage when spouses
[1:04:33] are not spiritually on the same field
[1:04:36] and she was so happy to know that it was
[1:04:39] someone with the same belief the message
[1:04:42] and so within six months we got engaged
[1:04:45] we got married
[1:04:46] the lord blessed us with tree precious
[1:04:48] gem candace sarah and ariel
[1:04:52] i thought to myself i could have said
[1:04:55] yes to unbelievers
[1:04:57] who would have
[1:04:59] which definitely would have been outside
[1:05:01] the perfect will of god
[1:05:03] and face the consequences but thank god
[1:05:06] for his guidance and leadership to reap
[1:05:09] the benefits of marrying a believer as a
[1:05:12] result
[1:05:14] amen
[1:05:17] i had to write this because i know
[1:05:19] nervousness will take over sorry
[1:05:24] yes we had our struggles and we were
[1:05:26] faced with challenges along the way
[1:05:30] but god
[1:05:31] was first and foremost in my life
[1:05:35] and when
[1:05:36] and we would gather together as a family
[1:05:40] with our three children and call upon
[1:05:42] his name we know with full assurance he
[1:05:46] will see us through
[1:05:48] praise the lord
[1:05:49] we fellowship that brother nelson and
[1:05:52] for a couple of years and then later
[1:05:54] move on to brother john dankwa
[1:05:56] we were quite active in the church
[1:05:58] hosting ministers and unbelievers and so
[1:06:01] forth enjoying fellowship with our
[1:06:03] family and the family of god
[1:06:06] alan being a deacon
[1:06:08] and a sunday school superintendent and
[1:06:10] my being a sunday school teacher
[1:06:13] to the youth was a great joy
[1:06:16] quite often we would be the last ones to
[1:06:20] leave the compound
[1:06:22] and uh alan having to take care of the
[1:06:25] things in the kingdom of god sometimes
[1:06:28] our kids would be tired and hungry and i
[1:06:31] remember him saying to the children kids
[1:06:34] we have to take care
[1:06:36] of the things that pertain to god and
[1:06:38] it's only what you do for god will last
[1:06:41] and they would say yes daddy
[1:06:43] so my life during this time was based on
[1:06:46] the things of god growing up our
[1:06:48] children and the fear and admonition of
[1:06:50] the lord training them and doing the
[1:06:52] best we can as parents
[1:06:54] first spiritually and next
[1:06:58] given them their education to equip them
[1:07:00] financially my life was more or less
[1:07:02] maintained in a balance with church wife
[1:07:06] mother and work
[1:07:08] with god being the leader and center of
[1:07:11] our life
[1:07:12] then the breaking point came
[1:07:16] it was on the 31st of july 2012. i got
[1:07:20] up as usual
[1:07:22] everything seemed fine the girls were
[1:07:24] off to universities so
[1:07:26] my but they were off on vacation
[1:07:30] so alan took a week off with them before
[1:07:32] i left home
[1:07:34] to go to work i just kissed goodbye and
[1:07:37] alan said darling when you get home we
[1:07:39] will take a walk
[1:07:41] well little did i know the walk never
[1:07:43] came
[1:07:44] later that day at work i received a call
[1:07:48] my manager drove me to the hospital
[1:07:51] and when i arrived there i saw
[1:07:54] sarah
[1:07:55] and her dad
[1:07:56] and i knew right away it was serious
[1:07:59] i got two minutes with him
[1:08:02] and they whisked him away that was it he
[1:08:05] died
[1:08:06] um
[1:08:07] of a brain
[1:08:08] aneurysm no signs nothing
[1:08:12] the news pissed my heart felt
[1:08:14] total devastation
[1:08:17] sarah was with me all
[1:08:19] broken up and crying and i said
[1:08:22] say
[1:08:22] don't cry baby all is well
[1:08:25] god is in total control
[1:08:28] my two girls candace and uriel were
[1:08:30] brought to the hospital
[1:08:32] and they too were broken up
[1:08:34] they were around the dad weeping i can
[1:08:37] hear them say daddy no don't go daddy
[1:08:40] you can't go
[1:08:41] don't leave us i'm too young to be
[1:08:43] without a daddy i could hear them
[1:08:46] saying come back daddy please don't go
[1:08:48] daddy
[1:08:49] hard as it may seem painful as it was
[1:08:53] crying out i knew i had to be there for
[1:08:56] the girls for a moment i told my life
[1:08:59] was shattered
[1:09:02] i said no god
[1:09:04] this cannot be real i said god
[1:09:09] no you cannot take my husband away from
[1:09:11] me
[1:09:12] you cannot take my best friend my
[1:09:15] companion for 25 years lord
[1:09:18] god you cannot take my children's father
[1:09:22] then i heard a voice said to me
[1:09:25] be still i know
[1:09:28] that i am god
[1:09:29] then suddenly a peace came over me
[1:09:33] and in the midst
[1:09:35] of
[1:09:36] his mom and others weeping i found
[1:09:38] myself started singing
[1:09:41] and softly whispering to the lord
[1:09:45] brother john danko and the other saints
[1:09:47] and ministers were also around the bed
[1:09:49] at the burial
[1:09:51] i know i had to find composure
[1:09:54] knowing that my girls and i will no
[1:09:56] longer see him
[1:09:58] that was the last
[1:10:00] with tears i looked up in the sky
[1:10:03] it was a very hot day
[1:10:06] and as if i saw in the clouds the lord
[1:10:09] and allah not his side
[1:10:11] then i
[1:10:12] i saw
[1:10:14] my entire 25 years
[1:10:16] just flash across
[1:10:20] from the day we got married to this day
[1:10:26] i said thank you lord
[1:10:29] for allowing me 25 years
[1:10:31] blissful years with your son and i said
[1:10:34] to alan go my dear go reap your reward
[1:10:37] your reward awaits you
[1:10:39] then i looked down and saw the body
[1:10:42] was being placed in the ground and i
[1:10:43] said to myself this is not him he is in
[1:10:46] a better place
[1:10:48] the lord gave me a measure
[1:10:52] of peace
[1:10:53] for those moments
[1:10:55] i thank you
[1:10:56] lord when we came home
[1:10:59] reality struck
[1:11:02] i could not do this alone
[1:11:06] our home was not the same our life was
[1:11:09] not the same god had to come in and fill
[1:11:13] that void
[1:11:14] and i said to god alan was the head of
[1:11:17] the home
[1:11:18] you were ahead of him now you have
[1:11:22] taken him away
[1:11:24] you have to beat ahead
[1:11:27] i felt
[1:11:28] like it was incumbent on me
[1:11:30] to take the mantle
[1:11:32] i challenged the lord
[1:11:34] i said lord
[1:11:36] i will serve you
[1:11:38] all the days of my life
[1:11:40] but you are obligated to take care of my
[1:11:44] girls and i through the journey ahead
[1:11:48] it was painful days and weeks and months
[1:11:52] heartaches and dark valley days or
[1:11:54] nights
[1:11:55] but through
[1:11:57] all this every day i would take my girls
[1:12:00] and together we would read the bible and
[1:12:03] pray and draw strength from him to face
[1:12:07] the day ahead
[1:12:09] he would give us a scripture to hold on
[1:12:12] to
[1:12:13] for the day scriptures like james 1 6
[1:12:17] with faith and not wavering
[1:12:19] then we would get home from school and
[1:12:22] work and we would get together again in
[1:12:25] the evening
[1:12:26] thanking him for taking us through today
[1:12:29] and asking him for a wood and strength
[1:12:32] and comfort to face the night and the
[1:12:35] next day ahead
[1:12:37] my three girls went university and they
[1:12:39] needed that extra strength to stay
[1:12:42] focused
[1:12:43] it was a hard road yes we cried together
[1:12:47] there were times
[1:12:48] us four felt so all alone desperation
[1:12:52] stepped in and i spoke out loudly to the
[1:12:55] lord and i said lord
[1:12:57] we are not here just four of us
[1:13:00] but
[1:13:01] five
[1:13:02] you are the fifth person here with us
[1:13:05] god
[1:13:06] you promise not to leave us nor forsake
[1:13:09] us
[1:13:10] since
[1:13:11] this was the test and time
[1:13:14] all the things i've learned all the
[1:13:17] scriptures all the word
[1:13:20] now
[1:13:20] the test
[1:13:22] the true test
[1:13:23] is here my fate was put to the test
[1:13:28] test to claim all his promises
[1:13:31] i said grieving is painful lord but only
[1:13:34] you can help us
[1:13:36] through
[1:13:37] and take us through
[1:13:39] and now
[1:13:40] sains and you know what
[1:13:43] he held to his end of the bargain
[1:13:47] he did not fail us
[1:13:49] he carried us through
[1:13:51] the journey sometimes there were only
[1:13:54] one set of footprints
[1:13:56] thank you lord
[1:13:58] the next chapter of my
[1:14:00] life stepped in
[1:14:02] so my plan was to live the rest of my
[1:14:04] life for the lord to reminisce on the 25
[1:14:08] blessed years of marriage
[1:14:10] be there for my children and when
[1:14:12] grandchildren comes along
[1:14:15] be there with them until the lord is
[1:14:17] ready to take me home
[1:14:19] well clearly this was not so much god's
[1:14:23] plan
[1:14:24] a couple years later another proposal
[1:14:26] stepped in i was deaf i definitely had
[1:14:30] to take this one to the lord
[1:14:32] throughout the year
[1:14:33] it was a lot of prayers
[1:14:36] and asking the lord for his direction
[1:14:38] and leadership and guidance in making
[1:14:41] this decision
[1:14:43] i said lord this was not my plan but
[1:14:46] this same time the
[1:14:49] lord i do not want to disobey you and
[1:14:52] face the consequences of disobedience
[1:14:55] help me show me if this is really part
[1:14:58] of your plan
[1:14:59] i need to know
[1:15:01] if this is your perfect will in my life
[1:15:05] i need you to vindicate this to me lord

[1:15:14] of god call christopher augustus for
[1:15:17] long
[1:15:18] and here i am and the rest you see and

[1:15:36] goodness and his mercies

[1:29:52] the new year
[1:29:53] for each person tonight and for the
[1:29:56] congregation i know that some of us as
[1:29:58] family that are not saved that would
[1:30:01] like to see come to the lord amen and we
[1:30:04] want to
[1:30:05] approach this new year i believe as a
[1:30:07] pastor says it will be lord supper feet
[1:30:09] washing and you're going into fasting i
[1:30:11] believe he said
[1:30:13] in the new year
[1:30:15] that we'll pray and fast for our
[1:30:17] families
[1:30:18] that family members be saved
[1:30:20] amen
[1:30:22] and also that we'll see miracles
[1:30:25] happening among us that's the greatest
[1:30:27] miracle is salvation
[1:30:30] praise god but you know something when
[1:30:32] jesus was going around and teaching and
[1:30:34] preaching
[1:30:35] every time he heals someone he draws
[1:30:37] some more crowd
[1:30:39] some more crowd and some more crowd so
[1:30:41] i'm saying let us
[1:30:43] pray for miracles to start happening
[1:30:46] among us
[1:30:47] like in the holy church
[1:30:49] amen and many people will come to the
[1:30:51] lord
[1:30:52] keep us in your prayers keep
[1:30:54] the region in your praise keep our
[1:30:57] national convention

[1:31:00] able to have in burlington here at the
[1:31:03] holiday here in may
[1:31:06] pray that it will all go well amen god
[1:31:09] bless you

[1:49:58] miracles that god has done

[1:50:03] miracles
[1:50:04] in fulfilling his word in our lives but
[1:50:07] i remember
[1:50:09] when god called me
[1:50:11] i
[1:50:12] was in a bad place a dark place
[1:50:15] and uh that pacific night a couple
[1:50:18] brothers came down to our place and
[1:50:21] started testifying to us and i just felt
[1:50:23] the pull
[1:50:24] to come to service
[1:50:26] wednesday night service and on jane

[1:50:48] catholic church it's all proper and
[1:50:50] quiet and respectful and i hear just
[1:50:53] singing clapping and shouting and that
[1:50:55] i'm going what you know i you know my
[1:50:57] brother stopped and he froze and
[1:50:58] something inside of me just pushed him
[1:51:00] up the stairs hey let's go i don't know
[1:51:02] you know
[1:51:03] i i get in the get into service and i
[1:51:06] see some people sitting around it's
[1:51:08] nothing to look at it's nothing just
[1:51:10] like the bible says there's nothing
[1:51:11] desire of him
[1:51:13] right you know and i look around and go
[1:51:16] what in my mind i'm thinking what am i
[1:51:18] doing here who are these people
[1:51:21] right but there's something inside
[1:51:24] on the on the outward
[1:51:26] i was in a mess
[1:51:27] i was in a carnal state i was i was
[1:51:30] being a you know possessed by many
[1:51:32] spirits at that time
[1:51:34] that were taking me to and fro
[1:51:36] and i i sat down and uh a little black
[1:51:40] man come walking out to the pulpit and
[1:51:43] i'm sitting there and i'm waiting i

[1:59:30] i'm not going to preach about google
[1:59:32] but
[1:59:34] i'm preaching about jesus christ
[1:59:37] but
[1:59:38] google has so taken over the world
[1:59:41] that
[1:59:42] most if not all of our information flows
[1:59:45] through the tunnels of their
[1:59:48] of their uh information technology
[1:59:53] and so um
[1:59:55] we find that google has timelines
[1:59:59] and
[2:00:00] they say they they're not
[2:00:02] but they can literally give you a
[2:00:04] timeline on your life
[2:00:06] from the first time that you logged on
[2:00:09] to
[2:00:10] google right
[2:00:13] even on my tablet they will come up with
[2:00:16] the pictures that i took five years ago
[2:00:19] 10 years ago
[2:00:21] and they have it all lined up that they
[2:00:23] can line up your whole life
[2:00:26] from when
[2:00:27] uh computers started and google came
[2:00:30] into existence
[2:00:31] they have kept that stuff and they can
[2:00:35] show you
[2:00:36] things and tell you things in your life
[2:00:41] from since way back within
[2:00:44] and uh
[2:00:46] and then they can even point you into
[2:00:49] your future in the terms of things you
[2:00:51] might have referred to while you're
[2:00:53] phoning somebody or talking to somebody
[2:00:56] you know with key words that they they
[2:00:59] can pick up they can tell you literally
[2:01:02] almost what you're thinking
[2:01:04] for now
[2:01:05] and what you're thinking to do in the
[2:01:07] future
[2:01:08] right so when you're thinking like that
[2:01:11] and
[2:01:12] along with those tools those uh tools of
[2:01:16] technology they're giving you a virtual
[2:01:19] assistant
[2:01:20] my and now we have them on amazon we
[2:01:23] have them on this that that there is
[2:01:27] virtual assistants everywhere where um
[2:01:31] your phone is talking to you
[2:01:34] your tablet is talking to you my god if
[2:01:37] that happened many years ago people
[2:01:40] would run for cover thinking this
[2:01:41] witchcraft or or some
[2:01:44] kind of thing taking place okay how how
[2:01:47] could you have a
[2:01:48] thing talking back to you you know so it
[2:01:52] looks to them as if it's like witchcraft
[2:01:55] they call it science now of course
[2:01:57] but
[2:01:58] then we find out my friends
[2:02:01] that the virtual assistant will help you
[2:02:04] to manage your time
[2:02:06] so organize your day and things like
[2:02:09] that
[2:02:10] and all those tools that we have
[2:02:14] uh especially if you're in university or

[2:02:26] with things and it'll help you to
[2:02:28] remember
[2:02:30] it'll help you very much to remember
[2:02:33] it'll make you remember things that you
[2:02:36] have to do
[2:02:38] it will make you
[2:02:40] remember places
[2:02:43] that you have to be or what to be
[2:02:47] as long as it's there it will remind you
[2:02:50] and tell you about that
[2:02:53] it will also remind you of people you
[2:02:55] have to meet brother
[2:02:57] praise god
[2:02:58] it'll remind you of people
[2:03:01] that you have to meet
[2:03:03] uh like that it's amazing
[2:03:06] that despite all the
[2:03:10] the great technologies that we have
[2:03:13] despite all of these aids
[2:03:17] that we have on assistance
[2:03:20] that we have
[2:03:22] we still sometimes forget
[2:03:27] you have all these things and we still
[2:03:29] forget
[2:03:32] and
[2:03:33] basically
[2:03:35] the human being is a flawed
[2:03:38] uh being or person
[2:03:41] and we all tend to forget things
[2:03:44] to a lesser or greater degree
[2:03:48] they claim as you get older you you
[2:03:50] forget more things when you're younger
[2:03:52] you remember better but regardless we uh
[2:03:55] to a lesser or greater degree we forget
[2:03:59] things no matter how you how smart you
[2:04:02] are or how
[2:04:04] retentive you think you are you will
[2:04:07] tend to forget
[2:04:09] certain things
[2:04:11] amen
[2:04:12] and basically
[2:04:15] we
[2:04:17] we all forget full of people
[2:04:20] and we forget full of names
[2:04:25] sometimes somebody just talk to you and
[2:04:27] they walk away and when they walk away
[2:04:30] they turn back and then you
[2:04:33] you don't know how to address the person
[2:04:35] because you forgot the name already
[2:04:38] and you're you're caught in that because
[2:04:42] we tend to be
[2:04:44] forgetful
[2:04:45] right
[2:04:46] and
[2:04:47] we also forget full brother of
[2:04:50] birthdays god help you if you forget
[2:04:54] anniversary
[2:04:58] right
[2:05:01] when you forget full of anniversaries
[2:05:04] and on top of that you're forgetful of
[2:05:08] very important
[2:05:10] appointments
[2:05:13] unfortunately as i said before
[2:05:16] we unfortunately forget
[2:05:19] people
[2:05:21] and i want to begin here by saying
[2:05:25] that is the main reason
[2:05:28] why jesus instituted the lord's supper
[2:05:32] which we call communion
[2:05:35] it is
[2:05:36] really a memorial feast
[2:05:41] it is
[2:05:42] something
[2:05:43] to cause you to remember him
[2:05:47] and in order for you to remember him he
[2:05:50] instituted this
[2:05:52] so that we might do it over and over
[2:05:56] that we might remember here
[2:06:00] now in genesis chapters 40 and 41
[2:06:06] you will find the story of joseph
[2:06:10] and in the what the chapters you rem of
[2:06:13] the butcher and the baker when he was in
[2:06:16] prison
[2:06:18] and you know how god gave them dreams
[2:06:21] and then how god used him to interpret
[2:06:24] those dreams
[2:06:26] and he interpreted the dream of the
[2:06:30] baker and telling him
[2:06:32] that he he is going to be hanged he's
[2:06:35] going to die
[2:06:36] right
[2:06:37] and the butcher how he would be exalted
[2:06:41] and go back to his original position
[2:06:45] well
[2:06:47] the one
[2:06:48] was hanged and the other one was
[2:06:51] elevated back to his original position
[2:06:56] what
[2:06:57] years uh sometime went by
[2:07:00] not years but time went by
[2:07:03] and the story goes and it tells us how
[2:07:06] the pharaoh had a dream
[2:07:09] and now it was time to interpret the
[2:07:12] king's dream
[2:07:12] [Music]
[2:07:14] the wise men couldn't do it
[2:07:16] nobody could do it
[2:07:18] pharaoh himself had no answer
[2:07:21] he searched the kingdom far and wide
[2:07:24] to have someone to interpret the dream
[2:07:28] oh
[2:07:29] and
[2:07:30] no one could
[2:07:32] but then suddenly
[2:07:35] the bible tells us the butcher
[2:07:38] remembered
[2:07:40] the butcher remembered joseph
[2:07:43] oh my praise god
[2:07:46] if you will look you'll find
[2:07:49] that in
[2:07:51] genesis
[2:07:53] 40
[2:07:54] 23
[2:07:56] the baker
[2:07:58] failed to remember joseph actually the
[2:08:01] bible said he forgot
[2:08:03] joseph
[2:08:05] he forgot joseph he failed to remember
[2:08:08] him
[2:08:09] but this butcher
[2:08:12] he remembered
[2:08:14] joseph
[2:08:15] what joseph told him and did for him
[2:08:19] and so
[2:08:21] he referred
[2:08:24] joseph to the pharaoh
[2:08:27] and pharaoh was happy
[2:08:29] to have such a man
[2:08:31] and you know the rest of the story
[2:08:34] how that joseph
[2:08:36] came to pharaoh interpret the dream and
[2:08:40] himself was exalted
[2:08:42] to pharaoh's right hand i won't go into
[2:08:45] those types and shadows of jesus christ
[2:08:49] being the greater joseph son of
[2:08:51] prosperity dead buried put in the pit
[2:08:54] raised up elevated put at the right hand
[2:08:57] of power amen and so on
[2:09:00] but
[2:09:01] in the book of
[2:09:02] psalms chapter 20 verses 6-7
[2:09:08] it says
[2:09:10] now i know that the lord saveth his
[2:09:13] anointing
[2:09:15] he will hear him from his holy heaven
[2:09:20] with the saving strength of his right
[2:09:22] hand
[2:09:24] some trust in chariots
[2:09:27] and some in horses
[2:09:30] but we
[2:09:31] will remember the name of the lord oh
[2:09:35] hallelujah we will remember the name of
[2:09:38] the lord
[2:09:40] remember jesus
[2:09:43] that is what i'm talking about
[2:09:44] remembering jesus
[2:09:48] now the lord's supper that we are going
[2:09:51] to partake of
[2:09:53] is a meal of remembrance
[2:09:57] let that be
[2:09:59] something that you retain
[2:10:01] and that you really do remember
[2:10:05] luke 22
[2:10:06] 19-23 reads thus
[2:10:09] he took the bread
[2:10:11] and he gave thanks
[2:10:16] and
[2:10:18] said
[2:10:19] gave it to them saying
[2:10:21] this is my body
[2:10:23] given to you
[2:10:25] do
[2:10:26] this in remembrance
[2:10:30] of me
[2:10:31] so this meal is particularly he
[2:10:35] instituted it
[2:10:36] so that all of those that would ever
[2:10:40] believe on him or in his name
[2:10:44] would remember him
[2:10:47] because he knew a lot of voices
[2:10:51] a lot of distractions
[2:10:53] a lot of things will come into the world
[2:10:57] that will take your mind and your
[2:10:59] thoughts away from him
[2:11:02] and from his word
[2:11:04] and he wanted to be sure that there was
[2:11:07] something that can draw your attention
[2:11:10] back and call you to attention
[2:11:13] that you might remember jesus
[2:11:17] and especially in these times of sodomy
[2:11:20] and these times of violence
[2:11:24] days of law are upon us
[2:11:27] darkness of lord this year upon us
[2:11:31] trail of the serpent
[2:11:33] mystery of iniquity
[2:11:36] the darkness of babylon is upon us
[2:11:39] the powers of sin satan and demonic
[2:11:43] enticement is now flooding the world
[2:11:46] [Music]
[2:11:48] clouds of darkness are billowing in my
[2:11:52] friends all around us
[2:11:55] when you look for a sliver of light
[2:11:57] you can hardly see it
[2:12:00] because it seems that we are in the
[2:12:02] lands of egypt spiritually again
[2:12:06] and the light and the sick darkness is
[2:12:09] so much
[2:12:10] that with your eyes closed
[2:12:13] you can feel it all around you
[2:12:16] and we are living in that day
[2:12:19] this day the bible spoke of it but we
[2:12:23] are now in it praise god remember this
[2:12:27] now
[2:12:28] i want you to know he do this
[2:12:31] in remembrance of me because it will be
[2:12:35] hard to remember him
[2:12:37] the pleasures of this world
[2:12:40] all around you
[2:12:42] oh
[2:12:43] trying to track your attention
[2:12:45] as the old uh song said
[2:12:48] of the
[2:12:49] pilgrim that was racing to the
[2:12:53] stairways of heaven
[2:12:55] when it says the songsters in the harbor
[2:12:59] that stood beside the way they attracted
[2:13:03] his attention
[2:13:05] inviting his delay
[2:13:08] but his watchword being onward he
[2:13:11] stopped his heirs and he ran
[2:13:14] and he shouted loud hosanna
[2:13:17] deliverance will come amen
[2:13:21] jesus will come
[2:13:23] the rapture will come
[2:13:25] we're going out of here
[2:13:27] we only have to stand it for a while
[2:13:31] but the lord has promised i will not
[2:13:34] leave you nor forsake you
[2:13:36] i go to prepare a place for you that
[2:13:39] where i am you may be also
[2:13:42] it's not going to leave you and that's
[2:13:44] my brothers and sisters but he will take
[2:13:47] it
[2:13:48] with him
[2:13:49] listen
[2:13:51] in the same manner
[2:13:54] after the supper he took the cup saying
[2:13:59] this cup
[2:14:01] is the new covenant
[2:14:03] in my blood
[2:14:05] which is poured out
[2:14:08] for you
[2:14:10] but the hand of him
[2:14:12] who is going to betray me
[2:14:15] is
[2:14:16] with mine two vines right the two vines
[2:14:19] with their branches and
[2:14:22] you know
[2:14:23] the twine it's right down through the
[2:14:25] bible uh you know you know that baby uh
[2:14:29] abel and kane and jacob and esau and
[2:14:33] joseph and uh moses and jamborees and
[2:14:36] that spirit of satan coming right down
[2:14:39] right down until it's there with judas
[2:14:42] and jesus right in the same church
[2:14:45] right and so on and right there amen yes
[2:14:50] my brother and but the hand of him who
[2:14:53] is going to betray me
[2:14:55] is
[2:14:56] with
[2:14:57] mine
[2:14:59] is he in my group
[2:15:00] he's in my church
[2:15:02] he is right here with me
[2:15:05] and his hand is working along with me
[2:15:09] outwardly but right really he's not with
[2:15:12] me
[2:15:13] he's with me physically outwardly but
[2:15:16] really spiritually you're really not
[2:15:18] with me
[2:15:20] but outwardly look like his hand is with
[2:15:22] nine
[2:15:23] right oh my
[2:15:26] on the table the son of man will go as
[2:15:30] it has been decreed
[2:15:31] but woe to the man who betrays him
[2:15:36] and they began to question among
[2:15:38] themselves which of them might be who
[2:15:41] would this be
[2:15:43] who would it be
[2:15:44] amen
[2:15:46] oh
[2:15:47] my friends let us all remember
[2:15:50] you say well what are we to remember
[2:15:54] this is we got to remember first of all
[2:15:57] the grace of god
[2:15:59] because as i've said and will say again
[2:16:02] his grace
[2:16:04] is greater than our faith
[2:16:08] because faith has to have something to
[2:16:10] believe it
[2:16:12] and grace was before faith
[2:16:16] and provided the object for faith to
[2:16:20] believing
[2:16:21] it's jesus christ is the grace of god to
[2:16:24] us
[2:16:26] and then we can now believe in him
[2:16:29] so his grace is greater than our faith
[2:16:34] amen
[2:16:36] praise god and i thank god that this
[2:16:39] marvelous grace is given to all
[2:16:42] believers who truly believe in him and
[2:16:45] receive jesus christ within their hearts
[2:16:48] with all sincerity and love that grace
[2:16:51] of god is in them and upon them for his
[2:16:55] glory hallelujah
[2:16:57] amen and the day his dress came
[2:17:01] the world become a new world
[2:17:03] your world become a new world
[2:17:06] when his grace come to your life
[2:17:09] your world become a new world your bible
[2:17:11] become a new bible your life become a
[2:17:14] new life everything changed when the
[2:17:17] grace of god came to your soul oh my
[2:17:22] hallelujah amen the rejected stone
[2:17:27] became the headstone when jesus went to
[2:17:30] the cross
[2:17:32] he was rejected stone before the cross
[2:17:36] but after they crucified him that stone
[2:17:39] that was rejected became the head of the
[2:17:42] corner
[2:17:44] he become the one to change the age
[2:17:48] from lord to grace
[2:17:50] he became the head the turning point
[2:17:54] of that dispensation and of that
[2:17:57] marvelous corner hallelujah amen yes sir
[2:18:02] when jesus died on the cross you realize
[2:18:04] what happened
[2:18:05] times changed
[2:18:09] and to this day
[2:18:11] we have bc
[2:18:13] before christ
[2:18:16] that's the way time is divided
[2:18:18] and annual domini which is after christ
[2:18:23] right here we are friends
[2:18:25] that this mighty one times change with
[2:18:29] his coming amen hallelujah and now we
[2:18:33] thank god in these last days that the
[2:18:36] headstone has come to us crying grace
[2:18:41] grace

[2:20:53] that if you bring so many thousand
[2:20:56] dollars
[2:20:57] i can grant you a piece of paper called
[2:21:00] indulgences

[2:21:49] remember
[2:21:50] we all remember his mercy
[2:21:53] we all remember his grace
[2:21:56] but let us also remember his betrayal
[2:22:02] and you
[2:22:04] and i
[2:22:05] we all should better remember how
[2:22:08] quickly we can betray him
[2:22:14] somebody will tell you something
[2:22:16] somebody will say something and before
[2:22:18] you know it before you can think you
[2:22:19] already betray him because you say
[2:22:21] something that's
[2:22:22] not right
[2:22:24] not according to the word
[2:22:26] not according to the spirit
[2:22:28] oh my
[2:22:30] not of the spirit of christ
[2:22:32] you you don't have to look scraggly with
[2:22:34] with long teeth and and all of that to
[2:22:38] be a judas
[2:22:40] the spirit of judas can anoint you and
[2:22:43] cause you to do things
[2:22:45] not even according to your own human
[2:22:48] will
[2:22:50] the difference with a sinner is that his
[2:22:53] nature is the sin so he'll go right on
[2:22:56] but the believer something will stop him
[2:22:59] and he'll stop he or she or that young
[2:23:02] person will stop and say oh dear lord
[2:23:05] forgive
[2:23:07] cleanse me lord
[2:23:09] forgive me of my wrong doing
[2:23:11] you say oh but this one hears this sin
[2:23:14] that i did is so big i will never be
[2:23:17] forgiven for that oh no the bible says
[2:23:20] that he forgives all our sins
[2:23:23] is that right
[2:23:25] paul was a murderer that killed not
[2:23:28] regular people he killed christians
[2:23:31] and he didn't kill one or two the bible
[2:23:34] said he really
[2:23:36] chased them he searched for them he
[2:23:38] hunted them down and he slaughtered them
[2:23:41] but when god in his mighty grace choose
[2:23:44] to call him out god said you are going
[2:23:47] to be a light to the gentiles
[2:23:49] i'm going to use you for my glory and
[2:23:52] for my honor hallelujah and god forgive
[2:23:56] him of all his sins that's why he said i
[2:23:58] am the chief
[2:23:59] of sinners
[2:24:01] and i want you to know brother sister
[2:24:04] because you know you say oh i'm a
[2:24:06] believer i'm a christian but let me tell
[2:24:08] you things from your life can still
[2:24:11] haunt you
[2:24:12] even though you're a believer
[2:24:16] oh
[2:24:17] but the blood of jesus christ is to
[2:24:19] cleanse us from all of our sins
[2:24:23] if we commit ourselves to him if we
[2:24:26] surrender completely to him if we ask
[2:24:30] him wash me cleanse me make me the way
[2:24:33] you want me to be father
[2:24:35] amen i'll cast all my sins upon you
[2:24:39] because you care for me lord of god
[2:24:43] hallelujah it's so easy to betray him
[2:24:47] easy
[2:24:49] for us to betray him
[2:24:52] easy for us to betray what we know today
[2:24:56] not just as the the written bible but
[2:24:59] the living word
[2:25:01] the word has come alive again in the
[2:25:04] lives of men and women in this day and
[2:25:08] in this hour
[2:25:10] it's god walking around on two feet
[2:25:14] god behind human skin
[2:25:16] not bad your skin back there on goat
[2:25:18] skin that was hanging in the temple
[2:25:21] but you your body the temple of the
[2:25:23] living god
[2:25:24] and god living in you and expressing
[2:25:27] manifesting himself making his word real
[2:25:31] praise god so that man could today could
[2:25:34] have a present tense manifestation
[2:25:38] amen
[2:25:39] of christ in you the hope of glory
[2:25:43] amen
[2:25:45] hallelujah i thank god for the living
[2:25:48] word
[2:25:50] i thank god
[2:25:52] that this word
[2:25:54] is important for us
[2:25:56] hallelujah
[2:25:57] just as much as his grace
[2:26:00] is important it is also important you
[2:26:03] remember his betrayal
[2:26:06] because it's mentioned in all four of
[2:26:09] those gospels he didn't just mention it
[2:26:11] and push it aside he wanted to remember
[2:26:14] but the example of judas we know he's
[2:26:16] condemned but you also got to pay
[2:26:19] attention
[2:26:20] that you don't get influenced by that
[2:26:23] spirit
[2:26:25] and betray the lord jesus
[2:26:28] from time
[2:26:29] to time
[2:26:30] amen
[2:26:32] as we come together
[2:26:36] to partake of the lord's supper
[2:26:40] let us remember those who are beside us
[2:26:44] brothers and sisters that behind us
[2:26:48] brothers and sisters that are in front
[2:26:50] of us
[2:26:51] you don't have to wait until this
[2:26:54] service is coming to an end to pray for
[2:26:57] them
[2:26:59] you say but i always pray but tonight
[2:27:02] you have another opportunity to actually
[2:27:05] project your prayer from where you are
[2:27:08] to where they are even if they cross
[2:27:10] this building
[2:27:12] they cross the world you have the power
[2:27:15] of faith through the presence of the
[2:27:17] holy spirit within your life to project
[2:27:20] your prayer for when love projects grace
[2:27:23] takes over and the spirit of almighty
[2:27:26] god will bring it to pass for his glory
[2:27:30] do you believe this
[2:27:32] amen praise god hallelujah
[2:27:36] i want you to know friends
[2:27:38] we are not the only ones having the lord
[2:27:40] suffer on a night like
[2:27:42] this but tonight
[2:27:45] many are taking the lord's supper many
[2:27:48] brethren some with revelation some
[2:27:50] without the understanding without the
[2:27:52] revelation some without the applications
[2:27:55] not knowing fully what it is about or
[2:27:58] what it's supposed to do uh what is his
[2:28:01] purpose and stuff like that
[2:28:03] around the world
[2:28:05] on this night
[2:28:08] people are taking
[2:28:09] the lord's supper
[2:28:11] and they're doing it as a remembrance
[2:28:16] now if you know there are certain
[2:28:18] cultures
[2:28:20] where
[2:28:21] if their ancestors die
[2:28:25] every year around the time when they die
[2:28:29] they bring a large life science
[2:28:33] a picture of that person
[2:28:36] and they put it up
[2:28:39] and they have
[2:28:40] either a celebration a party or
[2:28:42] something whatever or a service even a
[2:28:45] service
[2:28:46] and they eat and they drink and it's all
[2:28:49] been done
[2:28:51] in
[2:28:52] remembrance a memorial we say
[2:28:56] they do that in remembrance of that
[2:28:59] person
[2:29:00] jesus instituted this communion
[2:29:04] this lord's supper
[2:29:06] so that we may partake of the bread and
[2:29:10] the wine that we may actually remember
[2:29:14] him
[2:29:15] not just remember him just thinking oh
[2:29:18] he was a good man but to remember what
[2:29:20] he has done for you who he is what he is
[2:29:24] still doing for you your family your
[2:29:27] home your children your grandchildren oh

[2:29:33] your heart your soul he wants you to
[2:29:35] remember him we are to always be
[2:29:38] remembering jesus
[2:29:41] hallelujah
[2:29:43] amen
[2:29:45] no matter what you do
[2:29:47] make sure
[2:29:49] that you remember
[2:29:51] jesus
[2:29:52] and we come in a service like this
[2:29:55] we try to focus
[2:29:58] and
[2:29:59] we want to if we possibly can make
[2:30:02] ourselves specialists
[2:30:05] in remembering jesus
[2:30:08] if we forget everything else
[2:30:11] if we can't remember nothing else
[2:30:13] if we get so old that our mind slipping
[2:30:16] and we can't remember anything else
[2:30:20] remember jesus
[2:30:24] hallelujah
[2:30:25] and listen friends i've seen that
[2:30:28] i've seen people gotten so old they lost
[2:30:30] their voice they lost their sight
[2:30:33] and then they start slipping their
[2:30:34] memory slipping but you you going there
[2:30:37] and you're just talking with them and
[2:30:39] you just mention jesus
[2:30:41] all of a sudden they turn around and say
[2:30:43] what to say boy
[2:30:45] what you say son
[2:30:47] what they remember jesus
[2:30:49] you see because they they walked with
[2:30:52] him that talked with him that followed
[2:30:54] him they lived their life for him they
[2:30:57] surrendered their all to him that gave
[2:31:00] their whole being over to him hallelujah
[2:31:04] and so when his name is called they
[2:31:07] always remember jesus somebody's amen
[2:31:11] somebody said praise the lord sir thank
[2:31:14] you jesus
[2:31:15] say thank you lord
[2:31:17] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:31:20] we remember jesus
[2:31:22] no matter what happens
[2:31:24] we want to remember him
[2:31:28] we know according to the old testament
[2:31:31] how that god led the churn of israel
[2:31:34] through
[2:31:35] the
[2:31:36] wilderness
[2:31:37] just as much
[2:31:39] that was naturally spiritually we are
[2:31:42] now being led through the wilderness of
[2:31:44] this present world
[2:31:47] and as he led them how did he lead them
[2:31:50] by a great pillar of fire by night on a
[2:31:53] crowd by day
[2:31:56] and that pillar of fire led them
[2:32:01] and
[2:32:03] brought them to their promised land
[2:32:06] jesus
[2:32:07] was with the disciples
[2:32:10] until they came to the day of pentecost
[2:32:15] the bible tells us that he rose from the
[2:32:17] dead
[2:32:19] went back into glory
[2:32:21] [Music]
[2:32:22] left that a physical body there on the
[2:32:26] ultra sacrifice came back down in the
[2:32:29] form of the holy spirit
[2:32:32] and the spirit of almighty god came down
[2:32:35] in the form they saw it
[2:32:38] hallelujah
[2:32:40] in the form
[2:32:43] of fire
[2:32:45] but this fire this pillar of fire began
[2:32:48] to divide itself up
[2:32:51] into little licks of flame
[2:32:54] showing that no more is this
[2:32:57] going to be in one man named christ
[2:33:00] jesus
[2:33:01] but now that corn of wheat that fell
[2:33:04] into the ground has now multiplied and
[2:33:07] come back and now the great holy spirit
[2:33:10] is going to come back now and dwell
[2:33:13] within his people
[2:33:16] all praise god forevermore that he will
[2:33:19] live in them
[2:33:21] when the great fire fell upon them
[2:33:24] hallelujah i want to thank god that we
[2:33:26] are sitting in heavenly places in jesus
[2:33:29] christ

[2:33:55] warming myself from some painted fire
[2:33:58] oh not from a picture of the past all

[2:34:05] presence of the unfailing realities of
[2:34:07] the living god i want to have perfect
[2:34:10] realization of what god has done and
[2:34:13] what god is doing in this day and in
[2:34:15] this hour blessed be the name of the
[2:34:18] lord the bible tells us cloven towns
[2:34:21] like as a fire came down and sat upon

[2:34:28] hearts burning with the fires of god

[2:34:33] holy spirit will set your heart of fire
[2:34:36] your soul affair that you can start the

[2:34:50] light can be burning that you can be a
[2:34:54] shine so that some shipwreck life

[2:35:01] side of the way we'll see the light
[2:35:04] we'll see the life hallelujah and will
[2:35:07] point them back to jesus christ the
[2:35:10] haven of rest the harbor of safety
[2:35:15] may that great holy spirit do that for
[2:35:18] you tonight praise god forevermore i
[2:35:21] tell you it's a wonderful time we know
[2:35:25] praise god that when we come to this
[2:35:28] marvelous wonderful table we know that
[2:35:32] is his stable
[2:35:34] it's not mind stable
[2:35:36] but it is his table that he instituted
[2:35:40] and he commanded us to keep this in
[2:35:43] remembrance
[2:35:44] of him in obedience to him hallelujah
[2:35:48] and when we come together like this we
[2:35:50] come together to commune
[2:35:53] with him
[2:35:55] usually the word communion comes from
[2:35:57] east from the east where people sit down
[2:36:00] and they break bread and have some soup
[2:36:02] or something else and while they're
[2:36:04] talking they call that communion
[2:36:07] right so that term is coming from that
[2:36:10] but when we come here we just didn't
[2:36:12] come to talk to people
[2:36:14] we come to talk and commune with the
[2:36:17] person of our sovereign god who is in
[2:36:20] our midst here tonight that is what we
[2:36:22] are here for to commune with him and him
[2:36:26] with us so that we can have fellowship
[2:36:29] with him like adam and eve did in the
[2:36:32] morning time of the world he came down
[2:36:36] and talked with them in the cool of the
[2:36:38] day and now when it is evening time we
[2:36:41] want to come together under the great
[2:36:44] inspirations of the holy spirit and to
[2:36:47] have communion with him once again no
[2:36:50] wonder zechariah said at evening time it
[2:36:53] shall be light you'll praise god it
[2:36:56] shall be light again on the standing
[2:36:59] revelation of who god is and what he
[2:37:02] wants to do in your life is here upon us
[2:37:05] again
[2:37:06] blessed be the name of the lord oh i
[2:37:08] thank god that when we come and sit
[2:37:10] around like this it's like we have
[2:37:13] entered in to the oasis of the holy
[2:37:16] spirit when we have caught the
[2:37:18] revelation the
[2:37:19] the word when the word begins to unveil
[2:37:22] itself to us you you've come like a man
[2:37:25] who living in a world that is like a

[2:37:52] of fresh water hallelujah in the midst
[2:37:56] of a hot
[2:37:57] sinful
[2:37:58] dusty and devilish world that we are
[2:38:02] living in and that we are traveling
[2:38:04] through hallelujah but thank god there
[2:38:07] is a spring there's an oasis here where
[2:38:09] weary travelers can come and can drink
[2:38:13] and quench their thirst amen that their
[2:38:17] god-given thirst and refresh themselves
[2:38:21] hallelujah and then they look back

[2:38:27] how they got here
[2:38:29] you start to remember
[2:38:32] how you got here

[2:38:36] testifying
[2:38:37] how they were out in the world how they
[2:38:39] were going about doing their own lives
[2:38:42] their own things like that and somewhere
[2:38:44] along the line

[2:42:17] is to be seen
[2:42:19] to be known
[2:42:20] and to be recognized
[2:42:23] there is no more supernatural spiritual
[2:42:26] fruit of god
[2:42:28] that's willing to hide and ripen

[2:42:36] in the light
[2:42:39] and that may be all right
[2:42:42] but god may not want you there

[2:43:43] had a great time of opportunity
[2:43:46] that he could have given this life over
[2:43:48] to
[2:43:48] christ but instead
[2:43:51] he invited entertainment
[2:43:54] wanted to dance with the devil
[2:43:56] we're not here to dance with the devil
[2:43:59] we're not here to have a game
[2:44:02] with the devil to say leave me alone and
[2:44:05] i'm gonna leave you alone

[2:44:18] for the glory of god
[2:44:20] amen
[2:44:22] amen hallelujah
[2:44:24] i believe maybe when herod come down to
[2:44:27] its dying day
[2:44:29] he remembered
[2:44:30] jesus i believe while he's well dick was
[2:44:34] rattling in his troll he was remembering
[2:44:36] jesus
[2:44:38] remembering what he said remembering
[2:44:40] what he did and instead of him asking
[2:44:43] for forgiveness for cleansing or
[2:44:46] anything like that he was asking for
[2:44:48] entertainment
[2:44:51] you know that's happening right now in
[2:44:52] the churches
[2:44:55] religious entertainment
[2:44:58] religious singing
[2:45:01] oh my
[2:45:02] voices like angels
[2:45:04] that they think is going to take them
[2:45:06] into heaven
[2:45:07] listen listen god listen to voices
[2:45:10] beautiful more than that up in glory
[2:45:14] these voices we got down here with
[2:45:15] earthly things
[2:45:18] maybe your voice might come on the edge
[2:45:20] of something like one but the real thing
[2:45:23] is over there
[2:45:26] oh my
[2:45:27] but here we find that the devil is
[2:45:29] scripted you said what are you talking
[2:45:31] about i told you before
[2:45:33] that i was still a young man preaching
[2:45:36] the gospel casting out devils much
[2:45:39] prayer much faster and so much sometimes
[2:45:42] i'd walk in the church and people start
[2:45:43] falling down devils start screaming and
[2:45:46] coming up
[2:45:47] and here was a mighty man from
[2:45:50] from
[2:45:51] england come down a great opera singer
[2:45:54] well-known amen
[2:45:57] and oh he entertained he's a belief a
[2:46:00] christian and singing and everything
[2:46:02] else and
[2:46:04] after a while the service is over got
[2:46:06] close to him got close to him and start
[2:46:09] talking with him oh my
[2:46:12] and then the devil began to manifest
[2:46:16] i didn't cast them out
[2:46:19] but god wanted me to know
[2:46:22] showing and teaching me what's back
[2:46:24] there you don't go by those things
[2:46:27] sweet voice greatness
[2:46:30] the the greatness of man and positions
[2:46:34] and power and authority and money to
[2:46:36] give you credibility and all this type
[2:46:38] of things no no no no no go by the word
[2:46:42] by the holy spirit working and moving
[2:46:46] supernaturally
[2:46:48] they don't even believe that anymore
[2:46:50] they believe you must have some trick
[2:46:53] like just like herod believed that jesus
[2:46:55] had a trick
[2:46:57] and then he could just entertain them
[2:47:00] like that amen but don't let's be like
[2:47:03] that
[2:47:04] because you you you if you you better
[2:47:07] remember him now because you're going to
[2:47:09] remember him you're going to start
[2:47:11] remembering him when your soul begins to
[2:47:14] travel to the regions of the lost
[2:47:18] come to those dimensions of the damned
[2:47:20] on your soul begin to scream and cry out
[2:47:23] as it passes through
[2:47:26] a nightmare
[2:47:27] of this life
[2:47:30] you can't even go in the presence of god
[2:47:34] you can't even come back
[2:47:37] because your time is up
[2:47:39] you're obtained to die
[2:47:42] and after death the bible says the
[2:47:45] judgment
[2:47:46] the great white throne stands before you
[2:47:50] and there is the judgment is next
[2:47:54] oh my
[2:47:55] i trust that the young people will take
[2:47:59] notice of this
[2:48:01] and give it serious thought
[2:48:04] serious thinking
[2:48:07] repent
[2:48:09] get baptized in the name of the lord
[2:48:11] jesus
[2:48:12] not because of mommy or daddy telling
[2:48:14] you but because you something struck
[2:48:16] your soul
[2:48:18] and you recognize what god is saying to
[2:48:21] you in this hour amen
[2:48:24] so give the serious thought
[2:48:26] now don't give it serious thought when
[2:48:28] you come to the end of your life and the
[2:48:31] end of your way amen yes sir don't do
[2:48:34] that
[2:48:35] oh may god help every one of us to
[2:48:38] remember jesus brother brother tim
[2:48:41] brother mike let's remember jesus
[2:48:44] i know we've heard this preached before
[2:48:48] but oh i feel the inspiration of the
[2:48:51] power of the holy spirit
[2:48:53] remember the lord jesus christ i shall
[2:48:56] never have i can remember him when he
[2:48:59] hung on the cross for our sins wounded
[2:49:02] for our transgressions bruised for our
[2:49:05] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[2:49:09] was upon him and by his chance we are
[2:49:13] healed
[2:49:14] you're healed if you believe it right
[2:49:16] now you're healed right now if you
[2:49:19] believe it
[2:49:27] i remember him
[2:49:29] and i remember
[2:49:31] what he's done for me
[2:49:33] many times he saved me
[2:49:36] before i was born again before i knew
[2:49:38] him i knew there was some i call it
[2:49:41] something was always there with me
[2:49:45] and
[2:49:46] i went up on a cousin of ours owned a
[2:49:49] company that had great big machines in
[2:49:52] it and great wires coming in the main
[2:49:54] wires bringing in voltage and everything
[2:49:56] else flying my kite on an easter time
[2:50:00] and the kite goes up and the tail goes
[2:50:02] around the wire and boy you know
[2:50:05] you hide from them not to see you going
[2:50:08] up and
[2:50:09] go into their house and and climb
[2:50:11] through the window and go up there where
[2:50:13] the connection was and put my hand to
[2:50:17] take off the
[2:50:18] the kite wire there and then all of a
[2:50:20] sudden
[2:50:22] [Music]
[2:50:25] but in the midst of all of that
[2:50:28] i felt like something
[2:50:33] and i left i was left sitting there
[2:50:35] stunned
[2:50:37] i didn't know who that was what that was
[2:50:41] because there wasn't anybody there
[2:50:44] but obviously
[2:50:46] i had a job to do
[2:50:49] had work to do
[2:50:51] believe it or not another time another
[2:50:53] easter again
[2:50:55] going with my kite but this time
[2:50:58] now look how short i am
[2:51:01] at my age now
[2:51:03] can you imagine when i was 10 or 12
[2:51:07] and then
[2:51:08] you know short men love to buy big
[2:51:12] motorcycle i don't know because they
[2:51:14] want to appear big
[2:51:18] so i had a big kite
[2:51:21] and i'm going with the kite and i come
[2:51:24] to the
[2:51:25] corner of the street where
[2:51:27] the road goes by cars are passing and
[2:51:39] already
[2:51:42] the car is right
[2:51:44] there and again
[2:51:47] i felt that hand
[2:51:49] grabbed me and pulled me back
[2:51:52] like that
[2:51:54] i have to remember jesus
[2:51:58] don't tell me to forget him
[2:52:01] because before i was born again that
[2:52:04] happened so when i got saved then i'd
[2:52:07] start to get understanding why
[2:52:10] all that was happening there's work that
[2:52:13] you have to do oh my brother sister
[2:52:16] let's remember jesus
[2:52:18] i'm telling you my story but many of you
[2:52:21] sit right here got many things like that

[2:52:49] sometimes why you shout why
[2:52:51] oh my human voice human words human
[2:52:55] means can't express my gratitude my
[2:52:59] thankfulness my joy only when i get in

[2:53:25] praise god and have me in heavenly
[2:53:28] places where he can now have fellowship
[2:53:30] with him
[2:53:32] [Music]
[2:53:33] we know god
[2:53:35] is a spirit
[2:53:37] but he's not just a spirit
[2:53:40] or any spirit
[2:53:42] he is the sovereign god
[2:53:45] he
[2:53:46] he is a living personality
[2:53:50] when we come together like this like
[2:53:53] when the disciples were on the road of
[2:53:55] it to ambulance
[2:53:56] and they started talking about him the
[2:53:59] bible says and jesus drew near
[2:54:03] oh my
[2:54:05] when we talk about him like this he
[2:54:08] draws nigh again
[2:54:10] the spirit of the resurrected christ
[2:54:14] he's raised up he's not dead he's alive
[2:54:16] forevermore
[2:54:18] oh my
[2:54:20] oh
[2:54:22] i don't know why i'm referring to these
[2:54:24] things i uh will
[2:54:26] myself
[2:54:27] and bishop
[2:54:29] patterson
[2:54:30] were
[2:54:31] invited to cast the devil out of a
[2:54:34] insane man
[2:54:36] they have to lock him in the house the
[2:54:37] police don't even want to go in
[2:54:40] he's so mad he'll
[2:54:42] kill a murderer whatever
[2:54:45] big strong man
[2:54:47] but the thing about it because god was
[2:54:49] using us
[2:54:51] they didn't tell us
[2:54:55] they just said oh there's a man in there
[2:54:59] that needs
[2:55:00] prayer and we all fired up with the holy
[2:55:04] spirit
[2:55:05] pushed the door and walked in
[2:55:08] when we walked in
