TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] praise the lord friends i'm happy to be here once again with you to rejoice and praise and magnify the great and wonderful name of our lord jesus christ god bless you i'm speaking today on smyrna the second church age part one last week we had the introduction now we are on part one of the second church age called smyrna let us read our scripture and then we shall proceed with our study revelation chapter 2 verse 8 and unto the angel of the church in smyrna right these things which see it the first and the last which was dead and is alive god bless the wonderful and marvelous name of our lord jesus christ now as i've said we are speaking on the second church age part one called smyrna now smyrna a city that was north of ephesus at the mouth of the gulf of smyrna it had a very fine harbor uh and a beautiful commercial center that was renowned throughout the world for its exports it was also a very distinguished city distinguished for its schools of rhetoric philosophy medicine sciences and fine architecture was seen everywhere now many jews lived in this city called smyrna and they were bitterly i say bitterly opposed to christianity at that time and there were even more bitter and uh against christianity even more than the romans that was there at that particular day in fact polycarp was martyred by the jews and the hatred for christianity was so horrible that they broke their sabbath day rules they desecrated their own sabbath to go out further than a mile to collect firewood enough wood to be able to create a bonfire a pillar of a funeral pyre so that they may be able to destroy burn burn up polycarp now the word smyrna in itself means bitter and that is derived from the word myrrh as you know the kings brought him jesus gold frankincense and myrrh mar was used for the embalming of the dead so back then when the kings the three kings brought gifts from afar they brought appropriate gifts because each gift had a prophetic insight in it right and so murr in particular was speaking of his death that was to come so we find here mar speaks of death and the dead now there's a twofold meeting here that was speaking the name of the city the name of it was pointing to the fact that it was a an age upcoming an age that was filled with the bitterness of spiritual death now with the the two vines good and evil are now we're now at work within the branches the framework of the church of the living god and here were these two vines the false and the true and were drifting further apart with greater and greater bitterness that was being openly manifested they were openly manifesting it towards the true vine by this false vine but death was not the only seed of the false vine but even in the true vine the true church there was a creeping paralysis and impotence and this a lot of this was because of the inheritance atmosphere and conditions that ensued within the church of god a wave of what was in ephesus or in the ephesian church age i just washed right over into the smurnian church age now we know that no true believer is stronger and healthier and alive than in their knowledge of and their participation and of and in their obedience to the revealed word of god that they receive within their lives and there are multitudes of examples of those in the old testament and israel itself we know would be one of them now here we are smyrna organization began to rear its head it began to grow and confirming and augmenting the death of the membership holy ghost leadership by the holy ghost was overthrown for the leadership of man the word of god that was rich in the church from the ministries of paul and irene yes was now my friend uh re being replaced by creeds dogmas and various teachings of man along with man-made rituals that were never ordained of god in any way shape or form now just as israel great nation under the anointing under the glow of the pillar of fire began to lose her place her position and her power by her own illegal and unlawful alliances joining herself in other words to nations that were ungodly leaving the word for the the dominating nations of that time and entered into alliances with them and finally they formed all manner of fellowships all manner of unions with them and finally the day came when those nations or worldliness or baptism took took them over and they were captured all believers we must be careful that we are not captured by the world that we are not seduced and charmed by the wisdom of man but that we are led by the holy spirit the true and living god oh praise his wonderful name now when israel left the land or was taken from the land because we know that that is satan's strategy that is satan's plan the first thing he does to weaken a son a daughter a servant of the living god at church of the living god is first of all to shift them out of their land to shift you or i or any uh church off of the word foundation off of the revelation the opening of the word and shift you off into something that that is dead that is contrary to the word of god and so israel was made captive and brought into the land of babylon now when they got into babylon and went into captivity israel went into captivity having a an ironic priesthood the priesthood that god started when aaron was placed there and then his sons and son sons right through the levite and it came true that god had set up and allowed a priesthood aaronic priesthood back then which was nothing but a type priesthoods are not something that were to be continued down through the ages now here we find they came into captivity having a priesthood having a temple lord of god and having the fullness of the word of the lord but you see the time when this that they spent in babylon their faith became mixed as paul would say their fate was corrupted it was of added things or added things were taken away and so the face of the people of israel were was actually corrupted and we know this to be the truth for when they came out of captivity they did not come out having so much worrying about priests they had rabbis they had my brains theological orders or fraternities of pharisees and sadducees epicureans and stoics and and libertines and so on they had various fraternities various theological orders of that day and there they were instead of the temple they now had multitudes of synagogues and my friends here now instead of the torah they came out with the torah plus writings of the rabbis called the talmud which is not the word of god but it's the words wise words but words of the rabbis added to the torah which was god's word and we see that today everywhere we have the word of god then we have wonderful wise words of geological men trained men knowledgeable man educated intelligent smart man and good as it may be and sound it is not the word of god the word of god was revealed and made known to us by his marvelous grace hallelujah now at the height of this corruption then jesus came and when jesus came he called them of their father the devil he pointed out the evil that he could discern in them and in their midst and sparked in spite of the fact that they were of abraham's children by flesh they were not his children of faith now there we see it friends we see the same thing happening in this in this age of smyrna where there are those who call themselves jews and they are not and we see that happening in our day and in our age way down the centuries from smyrna to now and there are millions around the world that say we are christian we are born again and they are not all friends look at the word of god look in the mirror of god's word let us search our hearts search ourselves and see if we are who god says that we are but thank god out of this mess this morass this bog of evil filthy f and feuded sin out of it my friend always comes a little flock a little group and there was a little group of jews that stood faithful and true to the ordained anointed word of god for the hour there's always also even to this day satan with all of his washing of dirty baggage dirty clothes his rumors his lies and everything else his assassinations of character all his works that he tried to unleash against the church of the living god but still there remains a little flock ordained by the word of god to be here in this day in time thank god he watches over his own and if you are one of his own he is watching over you right now with all the attacks upon your face all the tests upon your foundations upon the teaching that you have received and and base yourself on they're going to be shaken satan will shake you shake your foundations but all praise god i know according to the book of the book of psalms the foundations of god stand it sure and god anoint them that are his thanks be to god stand for him and he'll stand for you o all to god's unchanging hand hold to god's unchanging hand especially when we see the end of all things are come and the coming of our lord for his bride is at hand glory his name now in this city there were two famous temples one to uh civil or celebi see billy see or we may say cebu no and there was another one that was of the worship of zeus now between those these two temples ran a beautiful street which was called the golden street now joining up these two temples joining the godzillas and the goddess symbiote they're my friends it started paganism introducing itself into christianity and starting in the first age and was known to exist only in rome but now it is found in smyrna in other words that spirit that devilish demonic teaching and anointing began to disperse its influence throughout the roman empire and he used the very same things god used god used the greeks the language was spread everywhere the laws teaching were spread everywhere so god used that to let the word flow out the romans had the robes for transportation and communication and he used that for the spread of the gospel everywhere satan did the very same thing and from rome this this teaching these beliefs in these false gods of rome began to uh uh spread out throughout the roman empire i am now speaking about smyrna and here we find a temple to zeus and sybil and friends this my friends is where we find the very seeds the seed of mary all the tree or the belief in mary whom is called the mother of god and receive all manner of honors and worship and titles and powers given to her even it's been said that she has co-equal with jesus christ and now i would speak on that but also the golden streak comes into this picture it was a hint from satan to the people that whoever joins his church his temple of zias or sibil like today you join certain major churches and immediately you can be if you're smart and wise you are on golden street because you will be introduced to certain people of high positions high powers people that can give you connections guide you mentor you lead you and instead of searching for the word of god instead of searching for the power the preeminence and the leadership of the holy spirit the people are going for human might and human power this this church this pagan uh church that teaches mary and place her in this exalted position contrary to the word of god and it's greed that causes these people to join themselves to what is nicolettianism an ungodly priesthood that dominates over the people and helps to join state and the church together and enjoying that that group that join those temples they joined those chur that church because they know that that is their golden street to wealth power and influence they knew it because that's what the church could offer them that's what they this could offer them that's what seville can offer them and so in droves they join themselves to that particular church not just for the religiosity but for the actual a practicality in human life that will lead them and take them on a street paved with gold down here but friends thanks be to god we are not just looking for our streets to be our uh to walk on streets of gold down here we'll walk on the streets of gold in the presence of the living god now the ephesian church age was the tragic tragic uh influence that would bring forth the church age of pertinence and yet we find in this church age of smyrna was the rain and the sun and the nourishment that ensured vileness corruption that would conform the church in its idolatry that they were already practicing at that time but it was openly in the name of zias and sibil but they were practicing idolatry at the particular time which is nothing but spiritual fornication against god and my friends to this day the church has not recovered from that idolatry that was now preparing itself to be introduced into christianity paganism masking itself on in the guise of christianity these are wolves trying to wear sheep clothing but with sharp teeth bloody terrible horrible their house their tackles the evil that indwells moves through them oh friends death was now entering in the church to permeate both root and branch and they that part took up that or became a part of that took part in her bitterness that would lead them to spiritual death now we know that this age of smyrna lasted from 170 a.d to 308 a.d revelation to eight these things said he the first and the last which was dead but is alive the first and the last which was dead and is alive think of it this speaks of life coming out of death not alive and was dead but is dead and is alive of all men we read in their genealogy and adam lived for so many years and he died and methuselah lived for so many years and he died all the various genealogies mentions they lived and they died but of this one we are reading he said i am the first and the last i was dead and i am i am now alive forevermore praise god in other words he lifted the curse he turned around spiritual death and caused us to enter into spiritual life praise be to god bless his name forever and ever now we know that a natural man a mere human could not speak really be alive like that from the grave he if it was just a natural man he would say i was alive and now i am dead but not this one i was dead and now i am alive i am the first and the last hallelujah the first thing that happens to a man is that he is born and the last thing that happens to him is that he is he dies or he is dead but this is not man speaking this deity speaking this is god speaking this is the almighty speaking true to us to recognize who he is by the grace of god hallelujah now we know that the man adam took life and turned it into death adam my friends did that but jesus christ came along and took death and turned it into life adam took our innocence and turned it into guilt and condemnation inferiority complexes and so on but he took our guilt and turned it into righteousness where we are have become the righteousness of god in christ hallelujah oh praise god forevermore we are the righteousness of god in him adam took paradise and turned it into a waste howling wilderness but this mighty christ this mighty one who said i am the first i am the last i was dead but i'm alive forevermore he has taken to a world rocking and reeling with all mirror of corruption and destruction pollution oh praise god hallelujah and he is turning it back into an eden again in the millennium period uh which is to come glory to god hallelujah amen we're going to another millennium one thousand year reign when he will cleanse the earth by the fire of god and him himself and his bride his wife will come riding in on white horses to rule and to reign upon the earth and to tread upon the ashes of the wicked according to the word of god o blessed be the name of the lord here we are friends that in this world this earth that has been the cradle the nursery to bring forth sin moral decay pain sickness suffering delusion corruption wars all matter of the imaginations that take up in the hearts of men but take god jesus christ this mighty one has taken us friends from degradation and death that filled us as human beings and brought forth in us life light righteousness and the beauty of jesus christ can now be seen in us and turned us into the righteousness of god that can stand without condemnation stand in true justification and give glory and praise to god that he lives in us dwells in us and walks in us oh praise god hallelujah and sin can no more raid in our lives but righteousness has taken the throne o praise god era has been kicked out from our lives evil kicked out of our lives and overthrown and truth stands upon the sits upon the throne of our heart and jesus christ indeed he is lord he is lord he is risen from the dead and he is lord every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess that jesus christ is lord forevermore hallelujah i take god forevermore for his gift to us the gift of eternal life that he has placed within our hearts oh thank god he is here thank god he is here right now walking up and down in the midst of the golden candlesticks of his church or praise god walking those among those whom he has redeemed brought back bought back by the priceless precious blood oh god we are not purchased by silver and gold oh but with the precious blood of the lord jesus christ that we are purchased oh praise god hallelujah and who are those whom he redeemed oh my god hallelujah many were like paul murderers corruptors there were many like the dying thief who rejoiced to see his day and said lord remember me robbers man killers people like that he came to redeem oh my friend whoever you are wherever you are regardless of your state your condition jesus christ came to save you jesus christ came to change you jesus christ has come to transform our lives we may fall this way fall that way lean this way slip slide this way for all praise god but he is gracious he is righteous he is rich in mercy and ready to forgive those that will humble themselves and come to him we are all the trophies of his marvelous grace hallelujah he has literally brought us back from the dead for we were spiritually dead but thank god he has given us his gift of eternal life and we are all made alive again in jesus christ our lord and because i live he says you shall live also and we can say now we live we live we live we are alive because of the wonderful and marvelous grace of our lord jesus christ hallelujah praise god he's letting us know the church is his no matter what satan tries to entrap her into charm seduce and uh enveloper in his coils of lies this evil python that roams the earth trying to overcome this church the first he fell by the way but this one will not because shall stand by the truth until the crown she gains all praise god hallelujah and as the seed is in the middle of the fruit so he stands in the middle of his church glory to god hallelujah the seed alone has life in it he is the author of life he is the life of the entire church his walking up and down in the church signifies and speaks of his entire of his untiring care for his wife for his church for his people his sheep for he is the great shepherd that is watching over his own that is his right for he bought the true church with his own life his own blood that was shed for us and that blood that was shed was not just the blood of our mortal man but the blood of god we are saved by the blood of god hallelujah amen amen and the one who owns the church is god himself very god himself that owns the church for he said i am the first and i am the last and that title speaks he's saying i am the eternal one i am the first i am the last that title speaks of eternity that tells you that he is saying i am the eternal one i was dead because i was in the body but i'm alive forevermore he paid the price and so he has soul complete ownership over this temple of god and any temple of god for you know your body is a temple of the living god who lives in you by faith hallelujah and he rules it and he is worshipped in his temple he's glorified his praise he's honored in his temple oh praise god is he honored in your temple does he pray do we pray in his temple do we give him glory in his temple do we honor him by the lines we lead as he in in his temple that is the way it ought to be and he resents anybody trying to take over his lordship his authority his preeminence over his true church of the living god hallelujah oh praise god no doubt my friends the reason he introduces himself to each age as god as deity is the warn and comfort the people hallelujah because the false vine are warned who is speaking they're warned this is the almighty speaking this is the eternal one speaking hallelujah oh praise god but those words that will bring terror and warning to the false vine brings joy and comfort to the true church the true vine of the living god yes indeed to some it will bring them joy but the others sorrow and deep despair hallelujah it brings sorrow fair warning to those who do not recognize him or see him actively moving walking up and down within his church yes this is the one true almighty god and i'm here to tonight to encourage you hear him hear ye him and live live forevermore may the lord bless you real god and keep you my friends as we look to him the great i
