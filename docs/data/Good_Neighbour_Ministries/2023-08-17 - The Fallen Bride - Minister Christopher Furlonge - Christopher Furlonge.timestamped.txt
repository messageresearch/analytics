[27:13] you know amen that this God that we are
[27:16] sowing he is real
[27:18] man hallelujah praise God
[27:22] we like to turn to our scripture tonight
[27:25] and it's just a few scriptures from
[27:27] Genesis chapter 2 and if you can bring
[27:30] the second slide up tonight my thought
[27:33] tonight here is
[27:35] a fallen bride
[27:38] man I fall and bright
[27:40] So reading from verse seven to nine
[27:44] Hallelujah
[27:47] praise God it's up on the screen yes so
[27:49] you can follow with us tonight amen
[27:52] praise God
[27:54] and the Lord God formed man
[27:57] of the Dust of the ground and breathe it
[28:00] into him into his nostrils the breath of
[28:04] life and Man became a living soul
[28:09] and the Lord God planted a garden
[28:12] eastwards in Eden and there he put the
[28:15] man whom he had formed
[28:18] verse 9 and out of the ground may the
[28:22] Lord God to grow every tree that is
[28:26] Pleasant to the sight
[28:28] and good for food the tree of life also
[28:34] in the midst of the garden and the tree
[28:37] of knowledge of Good and Evil amen could
[28:41] you bring up slide three and another
[28:42] scripture reading is taken from Genesis
[28:45] 2 16 just a little bit after that amen
[28:48] Hallelujah just a little bit further
[28:50] down and the Lord God commanded the man
[28:54] saying of every three of the garden thou
[28:59] mayest freely eat
[29:02] but of the three of knowledge of Good
[29:05] and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for
[29:09] the day that thou eat us thereof Thou
[29:12] shalt surely die
[29:16] amen
[29:18] and Genesis 3 24
[29:21] Hallelujah so we see amen God commanded
[29:25] them not to partake
[29:28] of that
[29:30] particular three
[29:32] amen hallelujah
[29:34] and it's all types and child and you
[29:36] we've been well thought and man I don't
[29:38] have to explain all this to you but amen
[29:42] hallelujah you've been taught so many
[29:45] times did you refer to the scriptures so
[29:47] he drove out the man and he placed at
[29:50] the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims
[29:54] and a flaming sword which turned
[29:57] everywhere to keep the way of the three
[30:00] of Life man let's pray gracious God and
[30:05] our heavenly father
[30:07] thank you Lord for this Grand
[30:10] time and privilege Lord that we are
[30:12] having that we can be in your presence
[30:15] Lord the night Lord making our way for
[30:17] us to be here Lord I pray Lord that you
[30:20] bless the reading of the words Lord your
[30:23] word Lord father to hear us Lord that we
[30:26] may find good grown and bring forth
[30:28] fruits worthy of your kingdom Lord Lord
[30:32] Jesus become it all into your hands
[30:34] tonight Lord the saints that we're
[30:37] listening in on air Lord and those that
[30:40] are present here we thank you for them
[30:41] Lord Jesus Lord we just ask you take
[30:45] full control forgive us for all of our
[30:47] mistakes and shortcomings as we commit
[30:49] ourselves to you for service in Jesus
[30:52] name we pray amen amen you may take your
[30:55] seats tonight
[30:57] foreign
[31:03] it's got to be in his house tonight
[31:06] amen are you happy to be here tonight
[31:10] man there's no better place to be than
[31:12] to be in this house man
[31:14] Hallelujah
[31:16] so God being God in his mind wanted a
[31:21] family to fellowship with him see God is
[31:24] a family man
[31:25] he wanted to have a family
[31:28] amen hallelujah
[31:29] so in his mind
[31:31] right
[31:33] he had this great plan of having
[31:38] a family
[31:41] and God is a family planning man
[31:44] Hallelujah
[31:47] see it wasn't God to begin with
[31:50] amen because we know God
[31:54] is just
[31:56] an object of worship
[31:59] and in order for him to be God he had to
[32:02] have something or someone to worship Him
[32:06] so what he did he created angels amen
[32:11] and he had them worshiping him amen
[32:14] hallelujah and out of those angels He
[32:17] had one
[32:18] special angel that he had
[32:20] we know him as Lucifer
[32:23] Hallelujah
[32:27] and he created man
[32:30] and he created angels
[32:33] and when he created man he placed them
[32:35] on free Memorial Agency for his own
[32:40] holiness
[32:41] and when he did that
[32:44] man fell
[32:46] Hallelujah
[32:48] now I just want to take you a little way
[32:50] back before the foundations of the world
[32:53] you see in heaven
[32:55] the devil as we all know him as Lucifer
[32:58] was God's right-hand man
[33:01] and he was given power
[33:04] even being co-equal with God but Lucifer
[33:08] forgot that he was just a creation
[33:13] amen
[33:15] and
[33:17] when he saw that all his angels giving
[33:19] honor and glory and worshiping and
[33:22] praising God
[33:24] amen he said wait a minute Pride lifted
[33:27] up in his heart I said listen I can't
[33:30] get that same worship too
[33:33] amen and from since that time till this
[33:36] very sad time Satan as we know him now
[33:39] always wants worship
[33:43] you think about it
[33:45] when he met Jesus what's the first thing
[33:48] he said Bow Down and Worship me
[33:53] and that's the same tactics he has into
[33:55] this very time
[33:57] Hallelujah
[33:59] so you see Lucifer the son of the
[34:02] morning he was we may say co-equal with
[34:05] God in that sense man he was given power
[34:08] but he could not create because he was
[34:11] just a creation so he had he was under
[34:14] limitations
[34:16] so if a mother for him to do something
[34:19] he had to take something that was
[34:21] already created and for voted
[34:25] Hallelujah
[34:28] amen he was able to take something that
[34:31] God had created and pervert it and
[34:35] pervert it and into evil and evil thing
[34:39] and that started all the trouble
[34:44] Hallelujah
[34:46] you see when God
[34:49] saw him
[34:51] setting up his own kingdom
[34:53] right and there was a a whisper campaign
[34:57] in heaven
[34:59] Satan had a whisper campaign in heaven
[35:02] behind God's back now if you joined me
[35:06] up you know we can overthrow
[35:08] this and we can come into power amen and
[35:12] that's another thing that has been
[35:13] happening in this world today you know a
[35:16] lot of secret campaigns behind
[35:19] amen and I pray to God that is no secret
[35:22] campaigns here amongst us
[35:25] amen hallelujah we rebuke that in the
[35:28] name of Jesus Amen that no Spirit could
[35:32] creep in and trying to do something
[35:35] against God's word and God's perfect
[35:38] plan for our lives amen hallelujah
[35:42] see pride lifted up in his heart
[35:45] amen and he imagined he got two-thirds
[35:48] of the angels to back him up
[35:51] amen and he thought he had the majority
[35:55] because in man's system now they believe
[35:58] that two-thirds majority is the one is
[36:01] the winner
[36:02] but he failed to realize where the
[36:05] scripture say one shall chase a thousand
[36:08] and two shall Chase ten thousand
[36:12] so we always on the majority side no
[36:14] matter what
[36:16] man Hallelujah
[36:19] surrendered vessel in the hand of God
[36:22] will back seat and any time
[36:26] amen hallelujah so put Satan where he
[36:29] belongs
[36:30] Hallelujah
[36:32] Hallelujah
[36:34] see Michael and the dragon fought and
[36:37] Lucifer
[36:40] and was cast out
[36:43] so you see
[36:45] there was a falling way back in heaven
[36:48] and any time that someone heart is
[36:52] lifted up in Pride and anything expect
[36:55] to fall
[36:57] expect to afford because Prides go at
[37:01] before
[37:03] fall that's what the scripture says amen
[37:06] hallelujah so just bear that's in mind
[37:08] Hallelujah
[37:10] and with all the children and all the
[37:14] angels that he had deceived amen will
[37:17] cast down to the Earth and was subject
[37:20] then as the prophet said to become human
[37:24] to to come in human form amen hallelujah
[37:29] praise God you know Satan was God's
[37:34] right hand man
[37:37] and you know he knows more about the
[37:39] scripture than any Theologian in today's
[37:43] world
[37:44] when you talk about
[37:46] High
[37:47] knowledge
[37:49] and and think you know once I don't want
[37:52] to jump ahead because you get what you
[37:55] expect
[37:58] if expected to get knowledge
[38:02] and she did get knowledge
[38:04] and that knowledge is passed from there
[38:06] right down to even to this day
[38:09] Hallelujah
[38:10] praise God
[38:14] he knows more about the scripture than
[38:16] anything when you're talking about
[38:18] scripture he knew scripture Satan
[38:21] because when we spoke the last time on
[38:25] tempted Temptation amen you see he took
[38:29] the word and even when he appeared unto
[38:32] Eve he took the word and just Twisted a
[38:35] little bit
[38:37] amen he said to her thou shall not
[38:42] surely die
[38:43] and that not not of the whole human race
[38:48] amen the true aspana and messed up
[38:51] everything and everyone being enslaved
[38:55] by that not from then to know unless if
[38:58] you have been released by the grace of
[39:02] God who paid the price to get you back
[39:05] out of Satan's hellhole
[39:09] Hallelujah
[39:12] praise God God in the beginning
[39:15] knew who would received him and who
[39:18] would not receive him is that right
[39:22] man we've been taught therefore he could
[39:24] predestinate by foreknowledge
[39:27] so he knows the choices that you gonna
[39:30] make when you come here because you
[39:32] already made a choice when you were back
[39:34] there
[39:36] you did not take sight with Satan you
[39:39] took sides with Jesus
[39:41] and when you took it there you're going
[39:43] to take it back right here amen
[39:45] hallelujah
[39:46] so it's just a a a a a duplicate of what
[39:51] you did there you're gonna do here
[39:53] so if you didn't fall there you will not
[39:56] fall here
[39:57] Hallelujah

[40:29] going to take Satan Spirit choose this
[40:31] day who you're going to serve but your
[40:33] choice was already made

[1:01:25] Walk In by yourself
[1:01:28] amen
[1:01:30] from under the protection of a husband
[1:01:34] Hallelujah
[1:01:36] she became an open Target
[1:01:40] for the enemy
[1:01:42] and when you
[1:01:44] as a Christian
[1:01:46] as the Bride As the elected Lady of the
[1:01:50] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:01:54] move from under the headship of your
[1:01:57] husband
[1:01:58] and who is your husband
[1:02:03] the word
[1:02:05] who is Christ
[1:02:07] so when you move from another protection
[1:02:09] from the word you are susceptible
[1:02:14] for attacks from the enemy
[1:02:16] to try to seduce you
[1:02:19] try to to destroy you
[1:02:22] you become an open Target for an attack
[1:02:26] amen
[1:02:27] praise God
[1:02:29] you see
[1:02:31] the man is the head of the woman
[1:02:36] amen
[1:02:37] and Christ is the head of the man

[1:02:43] so when you take Christ out of the
[1:02:47] picture
[1:02:48] you become a headless man
[1:02:52] and the woman is also headless too
[1:02:57] amen because in the scripture said
[1:03:00] the woman must subject herself
[1:03:04] to her husband to demand because he is
[1:03:07] the head
[1:03:09] and Christ is the head of the man
[1:03:11] so when you take the head of a man
[1:03:14] your home becomes
[1:03:17] fed less
[1:03:18] no Direction you don't know where to go
[1:03:21] is it logical make sense

[1:06:00] don't let anyone come in and try to
[1:06:03] bring in strange things that shift you

[1:06:26] hallelujah to wreck your life amen
[1:06:29] hallelujah
[1:06:31] praise God
[1:06:34] Satan was the one who preached the first
[1:06:37] Suman
[1:06:38] and he had a congregation and her name
[1:06:41] was Eve which represented the whole
[1:06:44] human race
[1:06:46] you know you know if what it means she's
[1:06:49] the mother of all living
[1:06:52] amen hallelujah she was our
[1:06:54] representation day amen hallelujah so
[1:06:58] when she fall amen she pulled all of us
[1:07:01] with her
[1:07:04] by
[1:07:05] making Adam agree to her you see Adam he
[1:07:10] didn't really sinner he went in even
[1:07:12] Timothy Eyes Wide Open
[1:07:15] Anna wasn't deceived
[1:07:18] Eve was deceived Adam was not deceived
[1:07:21] but Adam was typing Christ
[1:07:24] you see in all this God had a plan so
[1:07:28] Eve had to fall
[1:07:31] amen the first bride After Fall for God
[1:07:36] to display his attributes
[1:07:41] sometimes you wanna people doesn't know
[1:07:43] why God do this why God brings sin why
[1:07:45] God brings sickness why God bring that
[1:07:47] you see God had attributes in him and
[1:07:49] wanted to display it to the humankind to
[1:07:53] the human race that is a Healer that is
[1:07:55] a savior that is a provider and all the
[1:07:58] other things amen hallelujah so these
[1:08:00] things had to come into play
[1:08:03] God being God is forcing all this
[1:08:06] and he had to make a way before even the
[1:08:09] problem and the situation arise
[1:08:12] Hallelujah
[1:08:13] that is the god that we serve a god with
[1:08:16] a plan
[1:08:18] amen hallelujah
[1:08:20] chastising
[1:08:22] in all in all the little
[1:08:24] thoughts that were brought forth amen
[1:08:26] hallelujah
[1:08:28] praise God
[1:08:30] Satan he was the first preacher and he
[1:08:33] preached the eve and Eve stopped and she
[1:08:36] listened amen hallelujah
[1:08:39] praise God
[1:08:42] and she fell by listening to reasoning
[1:08:45] against God's word
[1:08:48] so as soon as you start to reason
[1:08:52] well the prophet didn't mean what he was
[1:08:56] saying or this didn't really happen we
[1:09:00] have plenty of that going on there
[1:09:02] amen
[1:09:03] when you start you stop and you start a
[1:09:06] reason and strata start to analyze and
[1:09:09] try to to dissect and whatever amen
[1:09:13] there'll be a problem I'm gonna start
[1:09:15] amen God didn't say the analyzer or or
[1:09:20] or or or to try to understand it what
[1:09:23] did God say
[1:09:24] believe
[1:09:26] taking God at his word
[1:09:29] because God does not lie and it does not
[1:09:33] change his mind about his word his
[1:09:37] wanting to the end something else
[1:09:38] tomorrow no sir once it sets that
[1:09:42] settles it for eternity
[1:09:45] amen hallelujah praise God God word is
[1:09:49] eternal
[1:09:50] doesn't change hallelujah amen praise
[1:09:54] God praise God
[1:09:57] you see the church is represented by a
[1:10:00] woman
[1:10:02] and if you want to know the condition of
[1:10:05] the church just take a look at a woman
[1:10:08] today
[1:10:10] man
[1:10:12] as our Prophet always
[1:10:14] told us if you want to know the
[1:10:16] condition of the world too Israel is a
[1:10:20] type and the woman is another type
[1:10:23] hallelujah praise God
[1:10:25] give me slight five please
[1:10:28] in the message God's power to transform
[1:10:33] here notice the two types
[1:10:39] pardon me yeah notice that the type of
[1:10:42] the two Edens so closely put together
[1:10:45] type together
[1:10:48] till it may almost deceive the very
[1:10:51] elect
[1:10:54] right
[1:10:58] Matthew 24 24 says that it would be that
[1:11:02] way but I want us to stop for a few
[1:11:05] moments and consider these two Edens
[1:11:08] and the one thing especially how the
[1:11:11] Bible tells us that God's word did
[1:11:15] produce that Eden there amen the first
[1:11:18] season man
[1:11:20] and how God's word was us that the other
[1:11:24] Eden would come which is Satan's in
[1:11:29] and we are in Satan's Eden
[1:11:33] men Hallelujah because he always wanted
[1:11:38] to set up a kingdom eh and he has an
[1:11:41] opportunity and God gave him his
[1:11:42] opportunity right here in this earth
[1:11:45] amen and he God placed all his subjects
[1:11:48] with him and Satanism the first Eve fell
[1:11:53] back there
[1:11:55] but there's another Eve in Satan in that
[1:11:59] would not fall
[1:12:01] Hallelujah amen praise God
[1:12:05] now we also know that there has got to
[1:12:09] be another Eden if we would also listen
[1:12:12] to The Prophet Saint Paul in second
[1:12:15] Thessalonians the second chapter he who
[1:12:18] exalts himself
[1:12:20] that day will not come
[1:12:22] of the Lord until that man of sin be
[1:12:27] revealed
[1:12:28] I know we're talking about that manner
[1:12:30] sin amen Satan incarnate himself he who
[1:12:35] sits in the temple of God exalt him
[1:12:37] himself above all that is called God so
[1:12:41] that he as God is worshiped as God
[1:12:45] was saying before Satan always wanted
[1:12:48] worship
[1:12:50] and he has he is now congregation
[1:12:53] worshiping him
[1:12:55] amen
[1:12:57] he has all his seminaries all these
[1:13:00] churches all these denomination thank
[1:13:02] the serving the true unliving God
[1:13:05] meanwhile their worship is going to
[1:13:07] Satan what a deception
[1:13:09] the reading from the same Bible
[1:13:12] quoting the same scriptures just as how
[1:13:14] Satan does all the time but are deceived
[1:13:18] with the little lies the Creeds the dog
[1:13:21] doctrines and Dogma they placed inside
[1:13:24] of that to deceive amen hallelujah but
[1:13:28] God's people God's Eve in this age will
[1:13:33] not be deceived
[1:13:36] Hallelujah
[1:13:38] amen hallelujah
[1:13:41] think of that now in Isaiah 14 The
[1:13:43] Prophet said that he saw Lucifer in his
[1:13:46] heart
[1:13:47] through a vision on the inspiration of
[1:13:49] God saying he would do that
[1:13:52] 800 years before Paul amen
[1:13:57] now here 800 years later Paul sees him
[1:14:02] comes
[1:14:04] comes to his position notice his heads
[1:14:08] up his Eden his scientific Eden
[1:14:12] which is scientific world
[1:14:15] with a scientific bride Church
[1:14:19] man all under the word of man's
[1:14:24] knowledge
[1:14:26] amen so Satan is setting up his Eden
[1:14:30] amen by all these systems that he has
[1:14:33] created and using man
[1:14:37] as his tool to develop it
[1:14:42] to promote it man Hallelujah
[1:14:45] with a scientific bride amen great
[1:14:49] seminaries with great degrees and
[1:14:52] educational programs what a time we live
[1:14:55] in it

[1:15:13] fear not little flock
[1:15:16] Little Flock for it's his father's
[1:15:19] pleasure to give you and I the kingdom
[1:15:23] and where the kingdom is the kingdom is
[1:15:25] within you you can see God clearly
[1:15:30] living into your life amen hallelujah
[1:15:33] excuse me please Hallelujah
[1:15:41] Hallelujah

[1:16:59] a husband she took another book of
[1:17:02] creeds and what
[1:17:04] was she she became the mother of harlots
