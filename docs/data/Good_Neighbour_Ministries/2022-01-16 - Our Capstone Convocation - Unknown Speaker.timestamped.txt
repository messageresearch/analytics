[15:52] christ
[15:55] now
[15:56] we would love we will speak on the
[15:59] subject
[16:01] of
[16:02] our capstone
[16:04] convocation
[16:08] we want to
[16:10] for you to draw nearer in your thinking
[16:14] and understanding
[16:16] on this marvelous subject
[16:20] of the invisible assembly
[16:24] union
[16:25] convocation
[16:27] of the saints of the living god
[16:30] not by advertisements
[16:34] not by congregations
[16:36] of men attracted to
[16:40] some program plan convention camp
[16:43] meeting whatsoever you call it
[16:46] but something
[16:48] spontaneous
[16:51] coming from in the soul
[16:54] that draws and attracts
[16:56] the true believers together
[16:59] as eagles are drawn
[17:02] together around the caucus the word of
[17:07] god hallelujah may the same holy spirit
[17:11] of almighty god
[17:13] draw our souls together and bring us to
[17:17] a place when we
[17:19] recognize and realize we are looking at
[17:23] the same thing
[17:24] we are seeing the same thing
[17:27] oh praise god and we are here together
[17:31] as the assembly of the force-born giving
[17:34] glory and praise to god
[17:37] now
[17:38] in our bibles
[17:41] in the old testament
[17:45] reading
[17:46] leviticus chapter 23
[17:50] verse 39
[17:54] also
[17:56] in the 15th day
[17:59] of the seventh month
[18:02] when you have gathered in
[18:05] the fruit of the land
[18:08] you shall keep a feast
[18:10] unto the lord for seven days
[18:17] and on the first day
[18:20] that shall be a sabbath
[18:23] and on the eighth day
[18:26] that shall be a sabbath amen
[18:31] now
[18:32] let us turn our attention to the new
[18:35] testament
[18:36] we read from the gospel of john
[18:42] chapter 7
[18:45] reading from verse 1
[18:48] to 2
[18:49] then
[18:50] verses 37
[18:52] to 39.
[18:56] after these things
[18:58] jesus walked
[19:00] in galilee
[19:03] for he
[19:04] would not walk
[19:06] in jewry
[19:08] because the jews
[19:10] sought
[19:12] to kill him
[19:15] now
[19:16] the feast of tabernacles
[19:19] was at hand
[19:23] in the last day
[19:26] the great day
[19:28] of the feast
[19:30] jesus stood
[19:32] and cried saying
[19:35] if any man thirst let him come
[19:40] unto me
[19:41] and drink
[19:43] he that believeth
[19:45] on me
[19:47] as the scripture
[19:49] had said
[19:50] out of his belly
[19:53] shall flow
[19:54] rivers
[19:56] of living water
[19:59] but this specie
[20:02] of the spirit
[20:04] which they that believe on him
[20:08] would receive
[20:11] for the holy ghost
[20:13] was not yet given
[20:16] because
[20:17] jesus
[20:19] was not yet
[20:21] glorified
[20:24] now let us pray
[20:26] loving
[20:27] gracious and eternal
[20:30] heavenly father
[20:34] abba father
[20:35] we give you praise and honor and glory
[20:39] here today
[20:42] honoring you
[20:44] by assembling ourselves together
[20:48] father
[20:49] as the lord jesus as we see that
[20:53] glorious day approaching
[20:56] we draw closer to thee and closer to one
[21:01] another
[21:02] may the holy spirit now draw near
[21:06] may your presence
[21:08] be real and realized in the preaching
[21:12] and this of the word and reception of
[21:14] the word of god
[21:17] to thee be the glory and the honor
[21:20] in jesus name
[21:23] amen
[21:25] now
[21:27] both scriptures
[21:29] that we have just read
[21:32] speak
[21:33] about the feast of tabernacles
[21:38] or feast of boots
[21:41] the
[21:41] of boats or tents
[21:45] now
[21:46] according to the scripture
[21:49] this feast was to last for
[21:53] eight days
[21:55] seven days
[21:58] and the next day would be the eighth day
[22:02] of that great feast
[22:05] and this feast of boots or tabernacles
[22:11] or if you want to say tents
[22:14] or the jews will say sukkas
[22:18] then
[22:19] it is a type of course of these earthly
[22:22] tabernacles that we are living in
[22:25] these are types and shadows of the
[22:27] bodies of which we dwell in
[22:31] and
[22:33] this was to remind israel
[22:36] that they were only pilgrims
[22:40] they're only strangers
[22:43] they were only passing through
[22:46] that land
[22:48] and they were not
[22:49] uh to
[22:51] think in their minds
[22:53] that that's that's it that was the end
[22:56] all
[22:57] of it
[22:59] it was to remind them as it is to remind
[23:03] us
[23:04] that even though
[23:06] we may be blessed become rich
[23:10] become
[23:11] uh just
[23:13] prosperous successful
[23:17] in every way
[23:19] and even though
[23:21] within our
[23:22] society our nation
[23:25] we develop
[23:27] a great reputation
[23:30] of fame
[23:31] uh notoriety
[23:34] and we are recognized
[23:37] by the multitude
[23:39] everywhere
[23:42] or even if
[23:44] they became admired
[23:47] admired and looked up to
[23:50] in their their society in which they
[23:54] lived
[23:55] god wanted them
[23:58] to never never forget
[24:01] but to always remember
[24:04] hallelujah
[24:06] that they were pilgrims
[24:09] and strangers
[24:11] within whichever land they were
[24:18] this world to the believer
[24:21] is not our homes
[24:23] we are just a passing through
[24:27] and our treasures
[24:29] our homeland
[24:30] lies beyond the blue
[24:33] for we are pilgrims strangers
[24:37] aliens
[24:38] from another land an eternal land
[24:42] an invisible land
[24:44] oh and we've come here to bear testimony
[24:49] to fulfill our father's purpose
[24:52] to magnify his great honorable and
[24:57] mighty name oh praise god forevermore
[25:01] hallelujah
[25:02] and it was to remind them
[25:06] as it is to remind us
[25:09] that as the fat seed of
[25:12] abraham that we are pilgrims
[25:16] and strangers listen
[25:18] in time
[25:21] and on this earth
[25:23] we are just a passing through
[25:27] oh
[25:28] we come from god
[25:31] and we are now on our way traveling back
[25:34] to god
[25:35] we come from the eternal realms of glory
[25:39] and we are here passing through
[25:43] as the scripture has said i passed you
[25:46] through the wilderness for i wanted to
[25:49] test you try you and prove you
[25:52] oh praise god hallelujah and now i've
[25:56] always said
[25:57] testing time approving time preparation
[26:01] time is never lost time so
[26:05] god is bringing us through this
[26:08] marvelous time praise god hallelujah
[26:12] amen for
[26:15] the real pilgrims and strangers
[26:18] and i repeat this that you might uh
[26:21] remember it
[26:22] strangers in time
[26:26] we are even strangers in this
[26:29] our present day time
[26:33] we are also strangers
[26:36] on the earth
[26:38] with us strange ways
[26:40] our strange way of thinking
[26:44] with our love for the word of god
[26:47] becoming something strange
[26:50] so we are pilgrims
[26:52] and we are strangers
[26:54] as it says in the book of hebrews
[26:59] chapter
[27:00] 11
[27:01] reading from verse 8.
[27:06] hallelujah
[27:08] listen to the word of god amen
[27:13] by faith
[27:15] abraham
[27:17] when he was called to go out into a
[27:20] place which he should after receive
[27:26] for an inheritance
[27:27] obeyed
[27:29] and he went out
[27:31] not knowing will he went
[27:35] by faith
[27:37] he's adjourned in that land of promise
[27:42] as in a strange country
[27:45] dwelling
[27:47] in tabernacles
[27:49] with isaac and jacob
[27:52] the heirs with him
[27:55] of the same promise
[27:58] for he looked for a city
[28:01] which hacked foundations
[28:04] whose builder
[28:05] and maker
[28:07] is god
[28:09] oh thank god hebrews 13 tells us
[28:14] for here we have no continuing city
[28:18] but we are seeking a city to come
[28:21] hallelujah
[28:23] amen
[28:24] yes
[28:25] this feast of tabernacles
[28:30] is also called the feast
[28:32] of in gathering
[28:35] a time of reaping and a time of
[28:38] rejoicing
[28:40] bringing in the sheaves from the fields
[28:44] and given glory and praise to god
[28:47] leviticus 23 speaks verse 10
[28:51] speak on to the children of israel
[28:54] and say unto them
[28:56] when you have come into the land
[28:59] which i give unto you
[29:01] and shall reap
[29:03] the harvest
[29:05] thereof
[29:07] then you shall bring the sheave of the
[29:11] first fruits hallelujah for of the
[29:14] harvest unto
[29:16] the priests glory to god hallelujah you
[29:21] see
[29:22] that was just a tape or a shadow
[29:26] pointing to the time of ripened harvest
[29:30] at the end of the
[29:32] church ages hallelujah
[29:35] that harvest is now being reaped across
[29:39] the world
[29:41] brothers
[29:42] ministers
[29:44] everywhere
[29:45] burning the torches of the gospel torch
[29:49] of the word of god
[29:51] shining lights into dark places
[29:54] throwing out the oh the lifeline
[29:58] the fallen shipwreck
[30:00] brothers that have even fallen away from
[30:03] this world
[30:05] lifelines are being thrown out to you
[30:08] oh praise god some brothers have been
[30:11] blessed
[30:12] just to be able to set up places
[30:16] that are hubs
[30:18] of
[30:19] information
[30:21] and dissemination of the word of god
[30:24] voices of declaration to manifest the
[30:28] word and promise of this hour
[30:30] bless god forevermore and god is using
[30:34] them in a mighty and in a wonderful way
[30:37] because this is the time
[30:40] of bringing in the sheaves of the
[30:42] harvest that we represented to our high
[30:45] priest jesus christ hallelujah this is
[30:49] the time
[30:50] this is the hour this is our capstone
[30:54] convocation now in progress glory be to
[30:58] god hallelujah amen
[31:01] now in john chapter 7
[31:05] jesus
[31:06] went to the feast of the tabernacles
[31:10] which
[31:11] was an
[31:12] eighth day feast
[31:15] eight day feast
[31:17] for on the first seven days they would
[31:19] have the feast and then
[31:22] he said on that last day
[31:26] the eighth day the great day
[31:29] of the feast
[31:32] jesus
[31:34] stood up and cried
[31:36] hallelujah i want you to notice
[31:40] that during the seven feast days
[31:44] he did not speak
[31:47] really to the people
[31:49] until the eighth day
[31:51] that he spoke openly to the people and
[31:55] publicly
[31:56] to all
[31:58] making
[31:59] sure that his voice
[32:02] was heard
[32:04] now during this our hour seven day feast
[32:08] day of the seven church ages
[32:13] seven day week
[32:14] of the church ages
[32:17] jesus
[32:19] attended
[32:21] the feast
[32:22] hallelujah
[32:25] he did attend the feast
[32:27] but he attended the feast as he did back
[32:30] there
[32:32] moving among the people on observe not
[32:34] attracting too much of attention and
[32:37] just chatting with various groups of
[32:40] people round about until the hour was
[32:43] come and then he would lift up his voice
[32:47] even so
[32:48] this great holy spirit
[32:52] came amongst us
[32:54] down through the seven chart changes
[32:57] until into this seventh last church age
[33:01] doing what observing
[33:04] and
[33:05] investigating judgment
[33:08] at the same time while using the
[33:12] ministry
[33:13] of our dear precious brother
[33:16] the 20th century prophet
[33:20] brother william marion branham
[33:25] and i take god for him
[33:27] many
[33:28] run away from that name
[33:32] many don't want to hear that name
[33:35] others misuse the name
[33:39] others use the name for their prophet
[33:43] profit
[33:45] others
[33:46] monetize that name
[33:49] for their own benefit but my friends
[33:54] now listen
[33:55] let me stop here for a moment
[33:59] i'm not talking about
[34:02] brothers
[34:03] groups
[34:04] that have to send out tapes
[34:07] books
[34:08] uh materials that people need
[34:11] and are sending them out almost at cost
[34:15] just to get the work done that is not
[34:17] what i'm talking about
[34:19] but i'm talking of those who will
[34:21] deliberately and many of them not even
[34:25] fully believing this message of this
[34:28] prophet
[34:29] but seeing the benefit
[34:32] of his notoriety name
[34:34] fame and
[34:36] how his message has filtered out
[34:39] and spread across the world
[34:41] they're trying to take advantage of that
[34:44] by by putting little pieces and snippets
[34:47] here and a snippet there within their
[34:50] talks within their video talks to
[34:53] attract the attention of the believer
[34:57] and of the public to be able to benefit
[35:02] monetarily from it
[35:04] and to turn it into something
[35:07] based on a profit estimate and not upon
[35:12] the sacred signs the of and the sacred
[35:15] word of the living god which we live by
[35:19] for his glory and honor
[35:21] i want to praise god
[35:25] i never saw brother william branham
[35:30] i never met brother william branham
[35:33] in the flesh
[35:36] i never talked with him to him
[35:38] or anything of that matter
[35:42] i was in another land when he
[35:45] was still alive
[35:48] oh but praise god

[37:30] with this man
[37:32] now
[37:33] that person is with the elect of god the
[37:37] bride of christ hallelujah
[37:40] he wanted them to become conscious
[37:43] that the same god they read about
[37:46] in the old testament in the new
[37:48] testament
[37:49] that same god was now here by his living
[37:54] presence
[37:55] and making himself known through the
[37:58] life
[37:59] of a dedicated man as he will through
[38:02] the lies and and walk and talk of
[38:06] dedicated men and women that will simply
[38:09] surrender and humble themselves in the
[38:12] presence of god
[38:14] oh
[38:15] think of it
[38:17] manifesting his presence
[38:20] at the seven day feast
[38:22] during the seven church ages
[38:26] he manifested himself using the various
[38:28] messengers
[38:30] manifested himself
[38:32] justificat justification as
[38:34] sanctification as
[38:37] oh as the baptism of the holy ghost
[38:40] manifesting himself in an increasing
[38:43] crescendo coming up to the fullness of
[38:46] the word and the consummation of the
[38:48] ages hallelujah
[38:51] and here
[38:52] he manifested himself how
[38:56] in this seven church
[38:59] this great gentile dispensation
[39:05] all of these seven church ages
[39:08] and in this one
[39:10] he has used this
[39:12] brother
[39:14] william branham
[39:17] by
[39:19] using him
[39:20] by the agency
[39:22] of two major gifts
[39:26] that he placed within his life
[39:30] for as he was with moses
[39:33] so
[39:34] was he with our dear brother
[39:38] if you would believe the first sign
[39:40] they'll have to believe the second sign
[39:43] and so was it with our dear brother
[39:48] if you thought he was just another
[39:50] healing evangelist
[39:52] like the many many that were on the
[39:55] field of which i know of
[39:58] oh
[39:59] praise god and while they were all
[40:03] moving around the field at that time
[40:05] whether it be a a allen oral roberts
[40:09] velma gardner w.b grant what jack cole
[40:14] whatever the names of those brothers and
[40:17] many many
[40:19] others anointed man man regardless of
[40:23] denomination upc
[40:26] a symbols of god church of god church of
[40:30] god and christ
[40:31] oh many mighty men of various tribes
[40:35] being used of god in mighty wonderful
[40:39] wonderful marvelous ways hallelujah and
[40:44] here he was moving around mount them
[40:46] just also like he was just another one
[40:50] but then god moved him into the second
[40:54] agency the second gift
[40:58] and said now by this sign they'll know
[41:02] that this is not some
[41:04] trick or some human thing
[41:07] no man can do these miracles except god
[41:12] be with him
[41:13] and so the second gift of the
[41:15] discernment of spirits
[41:18] amen looking into the lives of people
[41:21] displaying to them that this was no
[41:24] ordinary natural gift but it was
[41:28] supernatural looking into their past
[41:31] looking into their present telling them
[41:33] what happened when there were children
[41:35] telling them what was going to happen oh
[41:39] manifest in the word telling them what
[41:41] they just said to somebody just outside
[41:45] i spoke personally to one man who was in
[41:50] one of those meetings he had a letter in
[41:54] his pocket
[41:55] from his wife
[41:57] and he had spoken to nobody about it
[42:01] but there
[42:02] from the platform
[42:05] our precious brother
[42:07] said sir do you believe
[42:10] said yes sir i do he said oh
[42:13] i see you you have a letter
[42:16] uh from your wife in in your pocket
[42:19] right now and in the letter listen to
[42:22] this he says she tells you and he begins
[42:26] to tell him what is in the letter that
[42:29] this and that he told him what was in
[42:32] the letter word for word and then says i
[42:36] see you're not from this country i see
[42:39] water
[42:40] oh europe from across the europe and he
[42:43] named the country he says go back
[42:47] and he calls the man's name mr so and so
[42:51] go back where you come from your wife's
[42:54] left foot is healed thus saith the lord
[42:59] and so it was and it came to pass to the
[43:03] glory and praise of god so i'm trying to
[43:06] tell you
[43:08] that this second gift was so beyond
[43:11] anything
[43:13] the world has ever seen
[43:15] since the time of jesus christ himself
[43:20] when he said uh
[43:22] not
[43:23] oh
[43:24] before philip called you nathaniel
[43:27] i saw you when you were under the fig
[43:30] tree
[43:31] oh praise god and he was just trying to
[43:34] let the world know he has returned again
[43:37] but now here he is using a human form to
[43:42] manifest himself for the glory of god
[43:45] hallelujah
[43:47] but when
[43:48] that season
[43:51] of manifesting himself to attract the
[43:53] attentions of the crowd
[43:55] to attract the attention of the people
[43:58] for what god was doing through him
[44:01] thousands and thousands of people being
[44:04] healed and delivered and
[44:06] the secret things of their hearts
[44:10] being
[44:11] revealed and made known
[44:14] and when they're really attracted to
[44:16] that ministry
[44:18] then
[44:19] the bible said
[44:22] he began to declare his message
[44:24] hallelujah
[44:26] they began to declare the doctrine
[44:29] straighten out all the twisted perverted
[44:32] doctrines
[44:33] that the devil had messed up in the
[44:36] church of the living god
[44:39] hallelujah as it was
[44:41] he lifted up his voice at the last day
[44:45] the eighth day
[44:47] of the feast the capstone of the entire
[44:51] feast
[44:52] he lifted up his voice
[44:55] and he cried out hallelujah oh let me
[44:59] read from the word of god
[45:02] hallelujah and in the last day
[45:05] the great day of the feast
[45:07] jesus stood up and cried
[45:10] if any man thirst let him come unto me
[45:15] and drink he that believeth on me as the
[45:18] spirit said
[45:20] out of his belly shall flow rivers of
[45:24] living waters what was he speaking of
[45:27] the holy ghost
[45:29] amen thus speaking
[45:32] of the spirit the bible tells you that
[45:35] that he was speaking of the spirit
[45:38] but the spirit was
[45:40] made known
[45:42] or he spoke of it
[45:45] when he lifted up his voice
[45:48] on the eighth day
[45:49] the last day of the feast
[45:52] hallelujah
[45:54] oh praise god and now on our in our time

[48:51] what does he do he uses his bright body
[48:56] his bright body to amplify his voice to
[49:00] the world
[49:01] that is the lifting of his voice in this
[49:04] hour for there in the bible he lifted up
[49:08] his voice and he cried hallelujah oh my
[49:13] he lifted up his voice and he cried and
[49:15] now he is crying out
[49:18] through the many membered body of his
[49:21] bride through spiritual amplification
[49:24] of this message using her as a
[49:29] mike megaphone for his honor and for his
[49:33] glory yes the feast has already started
[49:39] the feast had started
[49:42] jesus slipped amongst them
[49:45] just doing a few things here and there
[49:48] that only groups of people as he begins
[49:52] to speak to small groups as he did in
[49:55] our time
[49:56] speaking to small groups in the chur
[49:59] during this last church age
[50:02] goes over and preaches over here
[50:04] preachers over there preaches over there
[50:06] speaking to small dedicated groups
[50:10] whatever stripe whatever name whatever
[50:13] they call themselves he declared the
[50:16] word to these dedicated groups during
[50:20] the church age while attending
[50:24] the feast speaking to small pockets of
[50:28] people
[50:29] everywhere to get their attention
[50:32] and while he was doing that
[50:35] you had a lot of pharisees
[50:38] and sad uses
[50:41] that were right there to hinder
[50:45] the black ball
[50:46] his name his ministry his work and
[50:51] teaching
[50:52] and so blinded to the word of god
[50:56] many would say oh
[50:58] he he never had a a high school
[51:00] education a grade school education just
[51:03] went to the eighth grade or whatever he
[51:07] like that and uh he didn't know anything
[51:10] so how could he be a teacher that tells
[51:13] you right there they don't even know the
[51:16] way of a true prophet
[51:18] many of them men coming out of the
[51:20] wilderness
[51:22] many of them that trade was cow
[51:26] herding
[51:27] or sheepherding farmers
[51:30] man that didn't know anything and god
[51:33] deliberately wanted to use mine like
[51:36] that
[51:38] because they had no
[51:40] education no thinking no smartness no
[51:43] cunning no slickness no intelligence
[51:47] of themselves but when the people would
[51:50] hear the word coming out of them
[51:53] and the works of the holy spirit being
[51:56] made manifest through them they had to
[51:59] recognize
[52:00] no man could do these things except it
[52:03] was god using him and declared himself
[52:08] for his glory oh my so was it with our
[52:12] dear brother until this time when now
[52:15] the messenger was gone the mighty angel
[52:19] the messenger of this eternal church age
[52:22] has come down amongst us and lifts up
[52:26] his voice declaring himself oh praise
[52:30] god through the opening of the word
[52:33] revealing himself through the word and
[52:36] using his bride to amplify his voice to
[52:40] wherever it is that it might go forth
[52:43] for his glory and for his honor
[52:46] hallelujah amen
[52:49] oh my
[52:50] these pharisees and sadducees back there
[52:54] and you still have them today
[52:57] because some of them are so far from the
[53:00] word you see
[53:02] and some of them are so sad about this
[53:07] kind of preaching and this kind of
[53:09] message you see
[53:11] oh my
[53:12] oh they're far from it they don't
[53:15] recognize it and they will send cunning
[53:18] men
[53:20] smart
[53:21] to intermingle
[53:24] to try to
[53:25] shame embarrass destroy disrupt
[53:28] dislocate misinform oh my misplace this
[53:33] word of god away from god's own people
[53:37] but friends you can do away with the
[53:39] messenger you can even kill the
[53:41] messenger but you cannot kill this
[53:45] message for the word of god shall not

[1:05:10] things bringing jesus
[1:05:12] the word the the word in its infancy
[1:05:17] bringing her
[1:05:19] him in her arms into the temple to be uh

[1:05:57] in the womb oh my hallelujah i want to
[1:06:02] thank god
[1:06:04] that the prophet of god has preached
[1:06:08] and stored up the word of god

[1:06:16] to circumcise us
[1:06:18] from denominationalism
[1:06:22] from false doctrines
