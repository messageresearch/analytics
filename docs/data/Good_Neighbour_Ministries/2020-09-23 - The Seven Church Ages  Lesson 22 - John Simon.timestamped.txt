[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] praise the lord friends
[0:16] it's good to be here once again
[0:19] by his marvelous love
[0:22] and his matchless grace
[0:26] we shall read out of the book of
[0:28] revelation
[0:30] chapter 2 reading thus
[0:34] [Music]
[0:35] unto the angel of the church of
[0:38] ephesus right these
[0:42] things said he that hold up this seven
[0:46] stars in his right hand
[0:50] who walk it in the midst of the
[0:53] seven golden candlesticks
[0:56] i know thy works and i labor
[1:01] and i patience and how thou
[1:05] canst not bear them
[1:08] which say they are apostles and
[1:12] are not and has found
[1:15] them liars
[1:18] and has born and has
[1:22] patience for my name's
[1:25] has labored and has
[1:29] not fainted gracious heavenly father
[1:33] we thank you so much for the
[1:37] reading of the word we pray
[1:40] that the spirit will give life
[1:44] to the word of god and bless us here
[1:48] together
[1:49] as we gather in your name under your
[1:53] glorious power and influence
[1:56] of your grace we ask it today
[2:00] in the name of jesus christ
[2:05] our last topic was on the
[2:08] the ephesian church age touching
[2:12] on tried and true
[2:16] how that the saints of god
[2:20] were tried but found
[2:23] to be true as they held to
[2:26] god's unchanging hand now
[2:29] what made them true to god
[2:33] what held them to him
[2:36] was their faith their confidence
[2:40] in the precious name of jesus
[2:44] as the old son said all the precious
[2:47] name of jesus
[2:49] wonderful to hear giving
[2:52] hope and cheer all the precious
[2:55] name of jesus oh jesus
[2:58] jesus jesus it's only jesus and jesus
[3:02] alone
[3:03] and that is what i want to talk about
[3:06] today
[3:08] for the scripture says and has
[3:11] born and has patience
[3:16] and for my name's sake
[3:20] has labored and has
[3:23] not fainted now we can see
[3:26] that in all these things for bearing up
[3:30] under the pressure for their patience
[3:33] during that time
[3:35] laboring in in the vineyard
[3:38] of the lord praise god and
[3:42] using all that to guard the word of god
[3:48] and they did this all for his name's
[3:51] sake
[3:52] or for this wonderful precious
[3:55] name of jesus christ
[4:00] they kept my friends away the
[4:03] adversaries
[4:05] they kept them off from off of the word
[4:09] of god
[4:12] their trials and their persecutions
[4:16] were multitude but they held to
[4:19] god's unchanging hand praise
[4:23] god for the blessed name of jesus
[4:27] amen my friends if you were to
[4:31] examine the book of acts i remember
[4:34] under a study by t.l osborne
[4:38] that he preached on three keys
[4:42] to the book of acts amen
[4:45] and he touched on the word the name and
[4:48] the holy spirit
[4:50] glory to god for here we find with the
[4:53] holy spirit
[4:54] in them they were able
[4:58] to withstand the attack attacks of the
[5:01] enemy by the word of god
[5:05] and by the powerful and precious name
[5:08] of our lord and savior jesus christ
[5:13] for that is the thing friends one can be
[5:16] a christian
[5:17] one can be religious one can be pious
[5:20] but when once you break into the
[5:24] true revelation of the word of god
[5:29] and of the power of the name of jesus
[5:33] christ
[5:34] it brings the enemy to begin to attack
[5:38] you the enemy comes in like a flood
[5:42] because they know you have entered the
[5:46] doors of the sacred temple
[5:50] when the word of god begins to manifest
[5:53] itself in the soul
[5:57] salvation of souls in the healing of the
[6:00] body
[6:00] in signs and wonders and in miracles
[6:05] and other demonstrations then the
[6:08] pharisees
[6:09] as it was in that day so is it today
[6:13] the actors the pharisees of this day
[6:17] begin to act up and begin to
[6:20] what your head they want your reputation
[6:24] they want to destroy the ministry
[6:28] because you come in no other name
[6:31] but the name of jesus a name which was
[6:35] despised
[6:36] amongst the jews mocked by those
[6:40] that have so-called culture
[6:43] manners dignity money
[6:47] position and power the name of jesus
[6:51] was put down and mocked and
[6:54] scoffed at this mighty name
[6:57] of jesus christ they laughed at those
[7:00] who believed in the name of jesus
[7:03] for to them it was just
[7:06] something for them to manipulate and use
[7:10] if you want to believe on the name of
[7:11] jesus that's fine
[7:13] if you want to be kind if you want to be
[7:14] loving if you want to be patient
[7:16] that's great they will turn around
[7:20] and manipulate those qualities and
[7:23] characteristics
[7:25] to enrich themselves to
[7:29] make their names great and their
[7:31] positions powerful
[7:33] while using and laughing and
[7:36] mocking at the name of jesus
[7:40] and the people who followed that name
[7:43] they'll curse the name
[7:46] they laugh at it with the light
[7:49] they'll mock the name of jesus with
[7:52] sarcasm
[7:54] and oh my god they'll
[7:57] talk about the name of jesus as just as
[8:00] if it's just another name
[8:02] it's the name of a new god or a next god
[8:05] or or something else or a great
[8:09] teacher or a great psychologist or
[8:12] a great leader of of the old times there
[8:15] they're trying to
[8:16] put it off deflected in every possible
[8:20] way
[8:20] but we know that there is no
[8:24] other name given under heaven
[8:27] whereby we must be saved but the name of
[8:32] jesus christ oh my friends if you are
[8:35] watching this broadcast here today
[8:38] i pray that the holy spirit will
[8:41] speak into your spirit into your heart
[8:45] even if you're a believer that your
[8:48] your faith will take a deeper route
[8:51] that you might allow yourself to become
[8:55] a
[8:55] tree with deep roots that are rooted and
[8:59] grounded in the precious name of jesus
[9:03] hallelujah
[9:04] praise god hallelujah we will never be
[9:07] ashamed
[9:08] of this name we will never repudiate
[9:12] this name
[9:14] my friends we don't want to be
[9:18] as one that is an unbeliever trying to
[9:22] wheedle our way into the flock of god
[9:26] to defile to mock
[9:29] and to destroy the influence
[9:33] of this name praise god
[9:36] hallelujah oh my thank god
[9:40] when you know the name and the power and
[9:43] the effects of this name
[9:44] your heart is blessed you are revived
[9:48] praise god hallelujah i know there are
[9:51] you know satan gets a heart attack
[9:55] and he gets acid reflux
[9:58] uh by three things
[10:02] and uh first of all
[10:05] is to the revelation of that name of
[10:08] jesus
[10:09] to a believer changes their entire
[10:13] walk and their entire outlook
[10:16] their entire view of the
[10:19] bible of the word of god
[10:22] the life of jesus christ once there
[10:25] is a clear revelation
[10:29] of the name of jesus in that we will see
[10:33] in there
[10:33] the one god will see and there the
[10:36] sovereignty of god the preeminence of
[10:38] god
[10:39] and so on but wonderful my friends
[10:43] to have a clear revelation of the
[10:46] precious and
[10:47] wonderful name of the lord
[10:51] jesus christ the next thing that gives
[10:54] satan
[10:55] acid reflux gives him an upset
[10:58] stomach it gives him a heart failure
[11:02] problems when that name
[11:05] begins to make itself manifest among the
[11:09] believers
[11:10] oh what the god that once again
[11:13] will see jesus christ the same yesterday
[11:17] today and forever
[11:18] making himself manifest amongst the
[11:21] believers
[11:22] in signs and wonders and miracles
[11:26] that the people may see and know that
[11:29] this is not
[11:30] a dead name or the name of a dead god
[11:35] but that we serve a true and a living
[11:38] god
[11:38] and the name is just as powerful today
[11:42] as it was in the name of jesus
[11:46] in the all praise under the days of the
[11:48] apostles
[11:49] for at the name of jesus demons still
[11:52] have to flee
[11:54] they still must bow they still must obey
[11:58] whether they are in a crippled arm a
[11:59] crippled leg
[12:00] a dying body a sick body a diseased body
[12:04] a favorite body a body with blood
[12:07] pressures back pains
[12:08] a body with all manner of aches and all
[12:11] manner of sicknesses
[12:13] at the name of jesus every
[12:16] devil every germ every sickness must
[12:20] flee
[12:20] at the name of jesus christ for in my
[12:24] name he said i give you power
[12:26] and in my name you'll cast out devils
[12:30] you'll lay your hands upon the sick and
[12:33] they
[12:33] shall recover thanks be to god for the
[12:37] wonderful precious name of our lord
[12:40] and savior jesus christ hallelujah
[12:47] the third thing that gives the devil a
[12:50] heart failure
[12:51] an acid risk reflux and it stops all the
[12:55] partying that's going on in hell
[12:58] right dead stop when they realize
[13:03] of the at the mention of that name
[13:07] the movement the activity and the
[13:10] empire and presence of the holy spirit
[13:14] moving amongst the people leading and
[13:17] guiding them
[13:19] for his name's sake and for the glory of
[13:22] god
[13:23] for once the people have heard the word
[13:26] are baptized in the name of jesus christ
[13:30] and the holy spirit begins to indwell
[13:34] them by the laying on of the hands
[13:37] of mighty men of god anointed by the
[13:40] holy spirit
[13:42] and the people begin to know
[13:45] and recognize that they are filled
[13:48] with the holy ghost then they
[13:52] cannot get those people to change
[13:55] the devil can't get those people to
[13:58] change in any way
[13:59] because they know the truth they
[14:03] recognize the word of god for
[14:06] for their age and they know the power
[14:10] the explosive atomic supernatural power
[14:14] that is within this mighty name
[14:17] of jesus christ hallelujah that name was
[14:21] so
[14:21] powerful that man of
[14:25] man of god like paul anointed by the
[14:29] holy spirit
[14:31] aprons we would say in this day
[14:35] handkerchiefs were taken
[14:40] and either laid on by the hands of paul
[14:44] are laid upon the body of palm
[14:48] and there were set the suffering people
[14:51] everywhere in the name of jesus christ
[14:56] hallelujah and when those people came in
[15:01] contact with those uh aprons or
[15:05] handkerchiefs that paul would go from
[15:08] the body of paul
[15:10] miracles would take place suffering will
[15:13] cease
[15:14] disease will depart and thousands will
[15:18] be
[15:18] set free by the presence and by the
[15:21] power of god
[15:22] my friends i have here with
[15:26] me some iprants
[15:29] some handkerchiefs as we in our day will
[15:32] say
[15:33] little prayer cloths which i will pray
[15:37] over
[15:38] and they will go out upon
[15:41] your request just
[15:44] send an email to
[15:49] goodneighborministries.org
[15:50] and we will send one of these
[15:54] out to you and believe in god
[15:57] either by the wearing upon your clothing
[16:00] under clothing or
[16:02] placing it under your pillow or within
[16:04] the pages of your bible or
[16:07] or somewhere that god will lead you
[16:10] with faith and confidence in the name of
[16:13] jesus
[16:14] you can be delivered you may be set
[16:18] free completely praise god somebody with
[16:21] an
[16:21] intimate insanity mental problems
[16:25] praise god hallelujah placing that upon
[16:28] their clothing or under their pillows or
[16:31] somewhere where they rest they may be
[16:34] set free completely because at the name
[16:37] of jesus
[16:38] demons have to flee glory to god
[16:41] hallelujah
[16:42] all manner of diseases
[16:45] must depart for at the mention of this
[16:49] all-sufficient name of jesus christ
[16:53] amen the devil must be depart
[16:58] for our people
[17:01] their face is anchored in the name
[17:05] of jesus christ all this wonderful
[17:09] name of the lord jesus christ
[17:13] listen to the word of god acts 19 11-17
[17:16] and god wrought special miracles
[17:20] by the hands of paul so that from his
[17:24] body
[17:25] were brought onto the sick handkerchiefs
[17:30] or aprons and the diseases
[17:34] departed from them
[17:38] and the evil spirits went out
[17:41] of them praise god hallelujah
[17:45] but you know whenever god's spirit moves
[17:48] the devil moves
[17:49] listen to the scriptures then certain
[17:52] of the vagabond vagabond jews you have
[17:56] vagabond christians you have renegade
[17:59] christians
[18:00] rotten to the core my friends placing
[18:03] the people's faith
[18:04] under a new religious system of
[18:07] government
[18:08] rather than putting the people's faith
[18:11] in the
[18:12] uh word of god and under the anointed
[18:16] leadership of the holy spirit they are
[18:19] bringing people under the leadership of
[18:22] some great renowned person
[18:24] of great name great influence great
[18:26] political power
[18:28] great my friends numbers behind him
[18:31] that's what they're attempting to do and
[18:34] thinking that they're faithful they're
[18:35] faithful to the man they're faithful to
[18:37] the organization
[18:38] but they're not faithful to god and many
[18:41] times
[18:42] i believe we are bringing more people
[18:45] into subservience or service or labor
[18:49] to man to organizations of
[18:52] man governments of man's systems of man
[18:56] denominations of man rather than
[18:59] to the ordained anointed and revealed
[19:04] word of god for this day and for this
[19:07] hour
[19:08] oh praise god hallelujah and certain of
[19:11] the vagabond jews
[19:14] exorcists they claim that they could
[19:17] cast out devils too
[19:18] listen took upon them to call
[19:22] over them which had evil spirits
[19:26] the name of jesus christ
[19:30] saying we adjure you by jesus
[19:33] whom paul preached and there were seven
[19:37] sons of skeva
[19:38] and the chief chief of priests which did
[19:41] so
[19:42] and the evil spirit answered and said
[19:45] jesus i know
[19:47] paul i know but who are you
[19:51] and the men in whom the evil spirit left
[19:53] upon them
[19:54] overcame them and prevailed against them
[19:57] so that they fled out of that house
[20:00] naked
[20:02] and wounded and this was known to all
[20:05] the jews
[20:06] and greeks also dwelling at ephesus
[20:09] and fear fell upon them all
[20:12] and the name of the lord jesus
[20:16] was glorified and magnified forevermore
[20:21] what is it that we just heard we heard
[20:24] just like with moses after he dropped
[20:28] his rod
[20:30] and his rod miraculously became into
[20:34] serpents satan called his magicians
[20:37] and they dropped rods too and their rods
[20:40] became serpents too
[20:42] but moses's rod ate up or swallowed
[20:45] theirs
[20:46] and we see the same thing now taking
[20:49] place
[20:50] spiritually paul sends out and purchase
[20:53] paul casts out devils in the name of
[20:55] jesus
[20:57] and the vagabond jews
[21:00] looking upon this trying to find a way
[21:04] what trick was it that paul was using
[21:07] that they might be able to copycat this
[21:11] they might act upon this and so
[21:14] they went out and said ah we
[21:17] found where the secret is
[21:20] this secret is in the name of jesus you
[21:23] see they were thinking
[21:25] magic but paul was thinking miracles
[21:28] there were thinking my friends that the
[21:32] magic was there was some kind of a magic
[21:34] in the name
[21:36] not realizing that you need to know the
[21:38] person
[21:39] to understand the power and potential
[21:42] that was
[21:42] in that name oh praise god
[21:46] but to mention the name or call the name
[21:49] without the life without the knowledge
[21:51] without the revelation of that divine
[21:54] person
[21:55] the name becomes empty and now
[21:59] these vagabond jewels you have vagabond
[22:02] christians as i've said before
[22:05] they've seen william branham they've
[22:06] seen many other uh
[22:08] evangelists and great other mind and use
[22:11] of god
[22:12] but especially the messenger of this
[22:15] hour
[22:15] the 20th century prophet of this day
[22:19] william marion branham being used of god
[22:22] in the casting out of devils discerning
[22:24] of spirit
[22:25] or praise god and many have tried to
[22:29] copycat this and so
[22:33] back then these sons of skeva
[22:36] they've tried to copy what paul was
[22:40] doing
[22:41] so they went into a home where there was
[22:44] a devil possessed
[22:45] uh pert man and said to the man
[22:48] we are jordy in the name of jesus
[22:53] whom paul preached yes paul preaches
[22:56] it paul has a revelation of it paul
[22:59] knows the name paul
[23:00] knows the person of that name and the
[23:03] potentials
[23:04] behind that name and so paul had a right
[23:07] to
[23:08] and he was saved by the name redeemed by
[23:10] the name called by the name chosen
[23:13] and sent forth in and by the name of
[23:16] jesus
[23:16] so he had a right to the use of this
[23:19] name
[23:20] they had no right no claims no
[23:23] power no birth no baptism nothing
[23:27] whatsoever
[23:28] but they thought that just the name was
[23:30] a magic name
[23:32] at the mention of that name demons would
[23:34] depart
[23:36] and the bible said they mentioned the
[23:38] name of jesus
[23:40] and the scriptures tells us
[23:44] that these devils says yes
[23:48] jesus we know and the
[23:51] devil that knowledge paul we know
[23:56] but who are you we don't see any
[23:59] identification of the name in you
[24:01] we don't see any seed of the name of you
[24:03] we don't see any foundational
[24:06] faith in that name resting inside of you
[24:09] and the bible tells us that the
[24:12] demon-possessed man
[24:13] sprang upon these seven
[24:16] sons of skiva of course you know that's
[24:19] telling you about the seven
[24:21] devil spirits that would be upon the
[24:23] seven church ages controlling and ruling
[24:26] them
[24:26] but here now we see these seven spirits
[24:30] this these spirits jumped upon these
[24:33] seven sons of skiva
[24:36] and says oh i provided you with your
[24:39] clothing
[24:40] i provided you with money i provided
[24:42] with everything you have
[24:44] and you're coming to try to cast me out
[24:46] give me back the clothing
[24:48] that that i gave you give me back the
[24:50] money give me back the power to give me
[24:52] back the influence
[24:53] give me back the position that you had
[24:55] and the devil
[24:56] wounded them harmed them and tore the
[25:00] clothing
[25:01] that they he had given over to them
[25:04] and they had to run for their lives and
[25:07] great fear came upon the people when
[25:10] they
[25:10] heard about that name of jesus christ
[25:16] now we understand that
[25:19] our righteous life must accompany the
[25:23] name
[25:25] it's not just the name but it's the life
[25:28] behind the name that makes the demons
[25:33] tremble
[25:34] it's the life behind the name
[25:37] that makes the proud heart humble
[25:41] it was god who devised this plan
[25:45] that in all things as a man
[25:48] he who lives so he could give
[25:52] give us his life behind our name glory
[25:56] to god hallelujah
[25:58] his life behind your name
[26:02] it makes the demons tremble
[26:05] to know that god lives in you
[26:08] the holy spirit lives in you the great
[26:12] potential the dunamis of the holy spirit
[26:17] dwells in you and at the mention
[26:20] of the name of jesus not only the name
[26:24] of the word of the name but the nature
[26:27] the character
[26:28] of the name dwelling in you the devil
[26:31] knows when it is
[26:32] and when it ate when it's not dwelling
[26:35] in you
[26:36] my friends so we must have the life
[26:40] behind the name for the bible says
[26:43] for whosoever nameth the name of the
[26:47] lord jesus
[26:49] let him depart from sin
[26:53] be ye holy ye that
[26:56] bear the vessels of the lord and again
[27:00] thou shalt not bear the name of the lord
[27:03] thy
[27:04] god in vain you see these
[27:07] ephesians were real christians
[27:11] they were really serving the lord
[27:14] they bore the name and the name
[27:17] was jesus christ and
[27:21] that was the name of the spirit that was
[27:24] within them
[27:25] the holy spirit jesus
[27:28] the mighty god the everlasting father
[27:31] the prince of peace the almighty
[27:35] the alpha and omega the beginning and
[27:37] the end
[27:38] the first and the last and they knew
[27:41] this
[27:41] this is the mighty full name
[27:44] of jesus christ hallelujah now listen
[27:49] and for my name's sake thou
[27:52] has labored and has
[27:55] not fainted hallelujah now remember
[27:59] even though paul was the apostle
[28:02] paul was the messenger of that day
[28:06] they were not laboring for paul they
[28:09] were not laboring to
[28:10] to lift up the name of the messenger
[28:13] they were not
[28:14] laboring for the name of the messenger
[28:17] son timothy in the gospel spiritually
[28:21] speaking
[28:21] they were not there to elevate timothy
[28:25] they were there to bring glory to the
[28:29] word
[28:29] that paul preached to the word that
[28:32] timothy
[28:33] preached to them they were there to
[28:36] label for the word
[28:39] they were not laboring for some
[28:41] organization or
[28:42] group somewhere that was sending them
[28:46] religious material
[28:47] and they looked to that organization as
[28:50] if it were
[28:51] their leadership and it was their
[28:53] headquarters
[28:55] this was the place they were to look for
[28:58] for the
[28:58] fountain of truth no
[29:02] my friends they were not laboring for
[29:05] any group or organization
[29:07] they were not laboring for any man even
[29:11] though it might be paul or timothy or
[29:13] whoever
[29:14] great name great renown great
[29:17] testimonies and everything else
[29:19] but they were laboring for the name
[29:22] of the lord and savior jesus christ
[29:26] they were not committed to programs
[29:30] they were not committed to human plans
[29:33] and human institutions
[29:37] they were not there to build up earthly
[29:40] holdings and to
[29:44] turn them into things of greater value
[29:48] they knew their real estate
[29:52] and so my friends they were not building
[29:55] up
[29:56] human real estate
[30:00] they were not there my friends
[30:03] to build up value in everything there
[30:07] were
[30:07] working for the lord as the old
[30:10] pentecostal chorus says
[30:12] we'll work till jesus comes will work
[30:17] till jesus comes will work till
[30:20] jesus comes and then be gathered home
[30:24] hallelujah will work till jesus come
[30:28] everything those christians
[30:32] those ephesian saints did it was
[30:36] in and for the name
[30:39] of jesus they acted only
[30:43] in that name
[30:47] their refrain from anything
[30:50] that was done that was not
[30:53] in that name of course
[30:57] there's a true vine and a false vine
[31:01] twins in the beginning twins at the end
[31:04] always that's the way it was
[31:07] and so here's it again while the true
[31:10] vine
[31:11] was working to lift up that name the
[31:15] false vein wanted to defile
[31:18] the name of jesus and they were
[31:22] mingled in the midst rivening walls
[31:25] coaching walls vagabond
[31:28] walls hiding in the midst and in the
[31:32] dark waiting to tear down
[31:36] that name my god always trying to
[31:39] undermine the kingdom of god always
[31:42] trying to
[31:43] move away from the foundation of god
[31:46] hallelujah but thanks be to god
[31:50] for those saints of god for the bible
[31:53] says
[31:53] the foundations of god stand sure
[31:57] and the lord knows them that are his
[32:01] they stood true to the word of god and
[32:04] they he
[32:05] held on to god's unchanging hand
[32:08] thanks be to god they were tried
[32:12] they were true they were patient
[32:16] they labored and they bore
[32:19] whatever came for his
[32:22] name sake nevertheless
[32:26] god had a complaint
[32:30] in revelation chapter 2 verse 4
[32:33] nevertheless i have somewhat against
[32:35] thee because thou has
[32:36] left thy first love
[32:40] after doing all these wonderful
[32:42] marvelous things
[32:44] satan got in the midst started to dilute
[32:48] and water down the true faith of god
[32:51] and move the people from their balance
[32:54] from their
[32:55] center and move them just slightly away
[32:59] from the word of god where they began
[33:03] to lose the warp the fire the
[33:06] originality
[33:07] of their raw primitive christian
[33:11] faith and love for god within
[33:14] the word of god hallelujah amen
[33:18] praise god now we know this message of
[33:21] course
[33:21] is not just the ephesians back there but
[33:24] it's to the entire
[33:26] age or church ages all of the church
[33:29] ages
[33:30] that this would be a spirit that would
[33:32] be in every church age
[33:34] trying to get your believers to fall
[33:38] away from the original faith
[33:41] doctrines atmosphere
[33:44] and approach to god as was delivered and
[33:49] given to us
[33:50] by the messenger of our age
[33:54] hallelujah now of course we know them as
[33:57] the ephesian churches lasted for about
[34:01] 120
[34:02] years and that the message given to them
[34:05] was
[34:06] a message that was to span many
[34:09] many ages we also know the principle
[34:12] how that history repeats itself
[34:17] hallelujah praise god so one generation
[34:20] would receive revival
[34:22] and it will fade out in the next one
[34:25] generation would receive revival and the
[34:28] revival will begin to fade out in the
[34:30] next
[34:31] a prophet would come apostle would come
[34:33] a message will come
[34:34] bring revival and then
[34:38] it will begin to slowly fade out in the
[34:41] next
[34:42] except for the few that will
[34:46] hold these coals of fire these embers
[34:51] of their word of god and the fire of the
[34:54] holy spirit
[34:56] that god had placed within their soul
[34:59] and that little flock would hold to
[35:02] god's word hallelujah
[35:04] amen oh praise god amen
[35:07] but to others not
[35:10] even a little ember of the original
[35:13] flame will remember
[35:14] what will be in them they'll wander away
[35:18] they'll drift away they'll have their
[35:21] own thoughts
[35:22] and all god's approp gifts will find
[35:25] their
[35:25] appropriate places and others will find
[35:28] no place for the bible tells us
[35:31] and for like judas there was no place
[35:34] found before him
[35:36] and like lucifer that was cast out from
[35:38] heaven he was cast out
[35:40] for there was no place found for him
[35:43] and my friends that's the way it is many
[35:46] would be in the midst but
[35:47] after a while they've gone through
[35:49] everything and they think they know
[35:51] everything
[35:52] they'll start to drift away their fate
[35:55] will begin to
[35:56] become a very shallow and cheap
[35:59] and after a while they'll find their
[36:02] places
[36:03] back where they come from whether it be
[36:05] a snake a turkish a spider
[36:08] or some other crayfish or some other
[36:11] spirit that was once in the net
[36:13] but then they'll drift away but ah thank
[36:16] god
[36:17] the true rainbow trout will hold to
[36:21] god's word
[36:22] and live by the word of god hallelujah
[36:26] amen praise god amen so my friends
[36:31] we know god has no grandchildren
[36:34] and that is why the same original truth
[36:40] must repeat again and again
[36:44] in every messenger that comes
[36:47] to every age and thank god
[36:51] for the messenger of this age that we
[36:54] have received
[36:55] the original faith once again
[36:58] that was once delivered unto the saints
[37:02] of god and this is
[37:06] what we are holding to may god
[37:09] help every one of us
[37:12] as we hold to god's truth
[37:15] and god's unchanging hand
[37:19] may the lord bless you
[37:22] may the spirit of god go with you
[37:26] may he overshadow you and may i say
[37:30] take the name of jesus with you
[37:35] child of sorrow and the woe
[37:38] it will joy and comfort give you
[37:42] if you take this name with you wherever
[37:45] you go
[37:46] may god bless you may you take the name
[37:48] of jesus with you
[37:49] may he bless you all of the week and all
[37:53] of the years ahead of you
[37:54] until we come together in the church on
[37:57] sunday morning to bring glory
[38:01] and praise to his wonderful name and
[38:04] just to let you know
[38:05] there will be a water baptism on sunday
[38:09] in the name of the lord jesus christ may
[38:12] god bless every one of you
[38:13] until we come together again god bless
[38:16] you
[38:20] [Music]
[38:51] you
