[35:59] and worship so these brothers have found
[36:02] a way to build these temporary churches

[36:09] for their day amen amen we want to be a
[36:11] part of that amen glory to God Amen I I

[40:56] to God Amen
[40:58] this
[40:59] morning we're going to look
[41:01] at taking the book we've been talking
[41:04] about the book we've been talking about
[41:06] the open book we've been feasting on the
[41:09] book we looked at how this book has
[41:11] become such such a focus in these last
[41:15] days and you know especially to to to
[41:18] the Sons and Daughters of God all of a
[41:20] sudden the Lord is bringing this book
[41:23] into Focus for us he's bringing it in
[41:26] such a way where where where listen you
[41:28] need to pay attention people are reading
[41:31] from the Bible they've been reading from
[41:33] that book but they don't realize that
[41:36] book has been opened they don't realize
[41:38] that it takes the spirit to give that
[41:40] book life amen praise God and so we've
[41:43] been talking about the book but now we
[41:45] need to go deeper and to see why it is
[41:49] that God is saying you need to take the
[41:52] book amen hallelujah let's go to the
[41:54] next scripture Revelations chapter 5
[41:57] last week we let off we we left off you
[41:59] know talking about how it was back in
[42:02] the beginning how Adam Adam back in the
[42:06] beginning was made in the image of God
[42:09] he was the very expressed IM he was God
[42:12] the first Adam when he when he said let
[42:15] us make man in our image it was a spirit
[42:18] man but it was God in the man he was not
[42:23] just a Son of God he was God Amen that
[42:27] was the way it was and then it wasn't
[42:29] until after we see in Genesis chapter 2
[42:32] that there was need for somebody to till
[42:34] the soil and so God took the dust of the
[42:37] earth created a body now for the spirit
[42:40] man to move into that body until the
[42:44] soil amen and then it was then that he
[42:47] started to name all the animals and and
[42:49] and because God had given him dominion
[42:51] over the Earth told them that their name
[42:54] was Adam it was only Adam but Eve was
[42:57] inside of Adam at that time and God said
[42:59] it's not good that he should remain uh
[43:02] you know alone and so God took Eve from
[43:05] the womb of the man and called her woman
[43:09] took took one of his ribs and created
[43:12] another vessel made of Flesh and Bone
[43:15] amen praise God she Adam himself he he
[43:19] told us it wasn't God that said that she
[43:22] would be the mother of all living it was
[43:25] Adam because Adam had with within him
[43:28] the book of redemption within him he
[43:30] held the book of life he held every
[43:34] understanding every concept of exactly
[43:36] what it was that God was going to
[43:38] express and he said she shall be the
[43:40] mother of all living and that's why we
[43:43] can Now understand by the open book that
[43:46] it wasn't an apple that Eve was deceived
[43:49] by but it was actually an adultery
[43:51] because Satan wanted to be a Creator he
[43:54] wanted to be somebody that could Express
[43:58] and and have children of his own so he
[44:00] goes and he plants his seed in there and
[44:03] now we see this whole Plan of Redemption
[44:06] we see this whole uh we see these the
[44:08] the these two Trails moving all the way
[44:11] from Genesis all the way to the Book of
[44:13] Revelation all the way to this time how
[44:16] there is a deceiver in the midst amen
[44:19] that wants to deceive your mind and get
[44:21] you off of who you really are you were
[44:24] not supposed to come through a natural
[44:26] sex ual birth originally according to
[44:29] the plan of God but he had a plan to be
[44:32] a redeemer to be a savior to be a Healer
[44:37] and in order for something to be
[44:38] redeemed something had to be lost amen
[44:42] so you were already in Adam when you
[44:44] were expressed in Eve and God knew that
[44:47] Eve would be deceived Adam knew that she
[44:50] would be deceived he knew she'd be the
[44:52] mother of all living that's why there's
[44:54] children of God and there's children of
[44:56] the enemy
[44:58] amen laying in a background here so that
[45:00] we can come and and take off from where
[45:02] we want to uh move on from and so
[45:06] understanding all of this it brings us
[45:08] into the clarity of this great deception
[45:10] that is that is moving even now in the
[45:13] land where people anybody can say I'm a
[45:16] Christian I go to church I believe in
[45:20] Christmas I believe that Jesus is
[45:24] savior I believe that he was the son of
[45:26] God
[45:27] but then he was the son of God and then
[45:30] there was a father in Heaven and now
[45:31] there's a holy spirit that's also moving
[45:34] but all three are are are are there's
[45:36] three there but they're all one you see
[45:39] they don't have a revelation that it's
[45:41] actually
[45:42] God come down from being father because
[45:47] father is God above us son was Jesus
[45:51] Christ coming with his own Brethren to
[45:54] be with us and to and to show him self
[45:57] as one of us and there was a great
[45:59] purpose in that and then the Holy Ghost
[46:02] when he was resurrected God by the Holy
[46:05] Spirit now in us but people don't
[46:09] realize this and they and they're still
[46:11] putting Jesus Christ back 2,000 years
[46:14] ago or putting him into a future event
[46:17] meanwhile he's here now he's already
[46:21] Come Oh Glory to God we're going to be
[46:23] looking at those things Revelations 5:
[46:26] 5- 7 will continue and one of the elders
[46:30] saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion
[46:34] of the tribe of Judah the root of David
[46:38] hath prevailed to open the book because
[46:41] in the in the few scriptures before that
[46:43] there was there was a great Panic John
[46:46] was like freaking
[46:47] out there there's no man on Earth no man
[46:51] above the Earth no man below the Earth
[46:53] no man anywhere that could actually open
[46:55] the book amen because there was no man
[46:58] there is no man that can take the Bible
[47:00] and say I got an understanding on this I
[47:03] can tell you what when the coming of the
[47:05] Lord shall be even Jesus when he was the
[47:09] word made flesh yes sir 2000 years ago
[47:13] go back and read it in Matthew chapter
[47:15] 24 he said not even I
[47:18] know that second coming all he could
[47:21] give them was the conditions of the
[47:23] world the conditions that the world
[47:25] would be in when he would be coming and
[47:29] this is all he gave but he himself
[47:31] because the plan the book the book was
[47:35] still in the hand of of of the one that
[47:38] held it from the very beginning and that
[47:40] book had to be transformed it had to be
[47:43] it had to be uh given and placed into
[47:46] the hand of the Lamb the lamb had to
[47:48] take it let's let's move on come on now
[47:50] Saints glory to God he says Behold The
[47:54] Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of
[47:56] David hath prevailed to open the book
[47:59] and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and
[48:02] I beheld and lo in the midst of the
[48:04] throne and of the four beasts and in the
[48:07] midst of the elders stood a
[48:11] lamb well wait a minute I thought there
[48:14] was one in the throne if you go back to
[48:16] Revelations chapter 3 or two you you'll
[48:19] see that there was that there was one
[48:21] that's that stood on the
[48:22] throne and that one is none other than
[48:25] God himself yes the alpha the
[48:30] beginning there's there's no two there
[48:33] we we saw it he saw one but now all of a
[48:36] sudden there's a lamb as it had been
[48:38] slain having seven horns and seven eyes
[48:42] which are the seven spirits of God sent
[48:44] forth into all the Earth and now he goes
[48:48] and takes the book out of the right hand
[48:51] of him that sat upon the throne well
[48:55] wait a minute here you mean somebody can
[48:58] go and take something from God
[49:01] impossible
[49:04] impossible it's not an actual book like
[49:08] our minds because we're we're we're you
[49:10] know we're brought into this Dimension
[49:12] where we we we read books we read words
[49:16] we we we we we get information through
[49:20] words and through books and and our mind
[49:22] automatically will instantly visualize
[49:25] books when we when when I say book you
[49:27] see a book in your mind you probably see
[49:29] the Bible in your mind but the but the
[49:32] but the book is
[49:33] God Adam held the book of life the book
[49:37] of the plan the book of everything that
[49:39] God was going to do which is
[49:43] himself he's the book he's the the the
[49:47] the the the volume amen praise God and
[49:49] so nobody can just go and take anything
[49:52] from God who sits in the
[49:55] throne it's because God was now
[49:58] changing and going into the position of
[50:02] lamb because there had to be a lamb that
[50:05] would be slain from before the f
[50:07] everything was all done and finished
[50:09] before the foundations of the world we
[50:10] need to get this perspective amen you're
[50:13] talking about God yeah he knows the end
[50:17] from the beginning everything was
[50:19] already in his mind everything was
[50:21] planned exactly how this Redemption
[50:23] would take place so he he doesn't need
[50:27] to figure anything out or to say oh oh
[50:30] wait a minute this brother's out of line
[50:32] I'm going to have to do this do that
[50:33] because it's going to change my whole
[50:35] plan are you kidding me that brother or
[50:38] that sister that's out of line is going
[50:40] to come in line amen and God will use
[50:42] whatever he needs to use to bring him in
[50:44] line Hallelujah you know what I'm
[50:47] talking about if you're a part of this
[50:49] word and this message you your life was
[50:52] was was was stirred up when this message
[50:55] came to you your life was changed all
[50:57] your friends thought you were cuckoo
[51:00] they said are you crazy what are you
[51:01] joining a cult with what's the matter
[51:03] with you you talking about God that's
[51:04] all you talk about is God why because
[51:08] God came into you God came into your
[51:11] life that's what this word is going to
[51:13] produce and unless you see it producing
[51:16] that where you will where your life will
[51:18] only look back to the word of God people
[51:21] say oh you take the word so
[51:23] serious you take it so serious you you
[51:26] you want to make it your abs don't you
[51:28] know those are just
[51:30] stories you see that's what Satan did
[51:34] when he deceived Eve he placed a false
[51:38] book into the hand of man and now man
[51:41] has his own book and they've created
[51:44] politics and they've created systems and
[51:46] they've created religions and they've
[51:48] created all these things for one
[51:50] purpose to take the people away from the
[51:54] real book amen Amen to make the people
[51:57] feel like they don't need the Bible they
[52:00] don't need the word of God they don't
[52:02] need an absolute but you will never take
[52:05] it from a son or a daughter of God
[52:07] because they are the word they can't
[52:10] identify with anything but the word
[52:13] hallelujah praise God and so here now we
[52:16] recognize that in this we see now let's
[52:19] go to the first quote
[52:21] here amen praise God the breach between
[52:24] the seven Church ages and the Seven
[52:26] seals now watch here is a verse I want
[52:29] to get to but in the days of the voice
[52:32] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[52:34] to sound the mystery of God should be
[52:37] finished as he has declared to his
[52:41] servants the prophets now see the
[52:45] mystery of this seven seal book will be
[52:47] revealed at the sounding of the seventh
[52:51] Church Angels message we know that that
[52:55] was William
[52:57] Branham okay go back into your church
[52:59] history you just need to go back into
[53:02] regular church history you will see the
[53:04] messengers that started right from
[53:06] Ephesus from Paul being the first church
[53:09] age messenger all the way down to
[53:11] William brandham iith before him was
[53:14] John Wesley Martin Luther uh you know
[53:17] all all these other you know you can go
[53:20] back and you'll see the actual history
[53:23] of the seven Church ages of Christianity
[53:26] am amen go back and do your own homework
[53:29] these are things that I'm I'm bringing
[53:31] here today the seventh angel begins to
[53:34] sound and there's messages wrote out
[53:36] there and we got it in tape and in book
[53:40] form now at the beginning of the
[53:43] sounding of the message the mystery of
[53:45] God should be finished see at that time
[53:48] now we will notice the book of The
[53:51] Mystery of God is Not revealed until the
[53:55] seventh Angel's message message is
[53:57] sounded now these points will be
[53:59] important in the seals I'm sure because
[54:02] it must every bit tied together now I'm
[54:07] I'm I'm giving you this quote because
[54:08] we're gonna we're going to be expounding
[54:10] into all of this as we approach and move
[54:14] through this message because we need to
[54:17] see and recognize by the day that we're
[54:20] living in what has been fulfilled
[54:23] according to God's word and what is left
[54:27] to be fulfilled you need to know where
[54:30] you are on a map in order to get to
[54:33] where you're going amen you need to know
[54:36] where you came from you need to know
[54:37] where you're at and you need to know
[54:39] where you're going and the only way you
[54:41] can do that is you need signposts along
[54:43] the way amen praise God and so we need
[54:46] to realize that this Mi this ministry of
[54:50] William Branham
[54:52] fulfilled Revelations 10:7 where all the
[54:57] mysteries of that of those Seven Seals
[55:00] were finished they're finished a lot of
[55:04] people are still looking for them to to
[55:07] to to do something the seventh seal is
[55:10] open the purpose of the seventh seal was
[55:14] to bring Christ to the Earth brother
[55:17] Bram said that the opening of The Seven
[55:19] Seals was was the the purpose of the
[55:22] seven seal was to bring Jesus Christ to
[55:24] Earth amen and so a lot of people people
[55:26] are are are still pointing to a coming
[55:28] of the Lord Jesus not realizing he's
[55:30] already
[55:31] come he's already come and all the
[55:34] mystery of God is now revealed but
[55:38] there's certain aspects of the mystery
[55:41] that you are that needs to be
[55:44] revealed you see that's what that's what
[55:47] all of this is leading to because people
[55:50] go to church oh I go to church I belong
[55:52] to this church I belong to baptist I
[55:54] belong to Presbyterian I belong to
[55:56] Jehovah Witness I belong to Buddha I
[55:59] belong to Muhammad I belong to uh Islam
[56:02] I belong to
[56:03] Allah but do you belong to the word do
[56:07] you come to realize that you're in that
[56:10] church not as a member but I can show
[56:14] you a a lot of scripture that says God
[56:17] has called you according to his purpose
[56:21] yeah amen his purpose so and he didn't
[56:24] say some of you he said you
[56:26] behold I send un Malachi 4:5 there's
[56:30] another scripture for William brandham
[56:32] behold I send unto
[56:35] you unto
[56:38] you the
[56:39] messenger to turn your heart your heart
[56:44] don't be looking to turn other people's
[56:46] hearts unless your heart is turned first
[56:48] amen you got to know that you know what
[56:50] you believe as a Christian otherwise
[56:53] you're just a denominational churchgoer
[56:56] than you Jesus you're not going to have
[56:57] rapturing faith for the Rapture
[57:00] rapturing faith for the rap it's a
[57:02] supernatural faith that only God can
[57:05] give you personal you're not going to
[57:07] get it from your pastor you're not going
[57:10] to get it because you belong to this
[57:11] church or you belong to that church this
[57:14] is not about belonging to Good Neighbor
[57:16] Ministries church this is about
[57:17] belonging to the body of Jesus Christ
[57:20] that is right now going back to to to to
[57:24] the spirit man back to the original
[57:26] position where she has supreme authority
[57:30] over all of the
[57:31] earth thank you Jesus glory to God Amen
[57:35] Hallelujah let's go let's look at the
[57:37] next scripture he says here now in the
[57:40] breach he
[57:43] says now it's wrote
[57:46] mysterious because no man nowhere knows
[57:49] it God Alone Jesus Christ see now but is
[57:53] it is a book a m serious book we're
[57:58] talking about the book it's the book of
[58:02] redemption well we'll get into that in a
[58:05] little while and now we know that this
[58:07] book of redemption will not be
[58:09] thoroughly
[58:12] understood people are reading the Bible
[58:15] they're talking about Jesus the Savior
[58:18] the Redeemer the Healer he is all of
[58:21] those things and he's available to
[58:23] anybody that has enough faith for here
[58:26] healing or for health or for wealth
[58:29] whatever it is you can tap into the laws
[58:31] of God's
[58:33] word but you can never be a part of God
[58:38] unless you were a part of God back when
[58:42] Adam was expressed in the image of God
[58:47] thank you Jesus you can never be that
[58:50] unless you were there then and if you
[58:53] were there then you're going to say Amen
[58:55] to this message am you're going to say
[58:57] Amen to a prophet of Malachi 4 a prophet
[59:00] of Revelations 10:7 God never did
[59:03] anything in the Old Testament L he
[59:05] revealed it unto his servants the
[59:07] prophet why are you believing in
[59:08] following a man we don't even follow
[59:11] him we are following after him because
[59:15] in 1963 when the coming of the Lord came
[59:18] on Sunset Mountain to open the Seven
[59:21] Seals which a lot of people look into
[59:24] the Book of Revelation they think John
[59:25] was was was doped they think he was had
[59:28] too much Veno or something because he
[59:30] had all these visions and he's seen all
[59:32] these dragons and all these symbols they
[59:35] had no idea that the opening of The
[59:37] Seven Seals was going to actually be for
[59:40] this end time church that would receive
[59:44] rapturing faith for a Rapture to receive
[59:47] and to know that that they are that
[59:49] they're Christians and that they know
[59:51] that they're Christians they know that
[59:52] they're in the right Church they know
[59:54] that they're under the leadership of the
[59:55] Holy Spirit Spirit they know they've
[59:57] come under the five-fold ministry
[1:00:00] they're not afraid to recognize what God
[1:00:02] is doing in their day and coming under
[1:00:05] subjection to the word what would you
[1:00:08] have done back in the day when Jesus was
[1:00:10] on Earth and only a handful of people
[1:00:13] were following him they said he was a
[1:00:14] heretic he was a troublemaker he would
[1:00:17] he would be causing trouble but yet they
[1:00:19] couldn't deny that the dead were being
[1:00:21] raised they couldn't deny that the the
[1:00:23] sick were being made whole they couldn't
[1:00:25] deny the discernment when he went to the
[1:00:27] woman at the well and told her all about
[1:00:29] her life they they they just didn't
[1:00:32] understand those things and God does the
[1:00:34] very same thing in sending us a prophet
[1:00:36] in in the 20th century and Jesus Christ
[1:00:40] through the ministry remember it's
[1:00:42] always Christ amen never look to a man
[1:00:46] he had the voice of God speaking through
[1:00:50] him and any man that's anointed by the
[1:00:53] word of God in this day and in this hour
[1:00:55] under the father fivefold Ministry and
[1:00:57] and and and and has a revelation becomes
[1:01:00] the voice of God in the last days and to
[1:01:04] the people amen you've got to be able to
[1:01:06] discern between man and God you got to
[1:01:09] be able to discern doctrines of man and
[1:01:12] the revelation of God's word that
[1:01:14] strikes your soul and you say I see it I
[1:01:17] can't help it it's it's just it's clear
[1:01:20] as a
[1:01:21] bell the Gates of Hell will never
[1:01:23] Prevail against that nobody can convince
[1:01:25] me out of it if somebody convince you to
[1:01:27] come to church somebody will convince
[1:01:28] you to go to another church you'll be
[1:01:31] gone before you know it because this
[1:01:32] word will not find a resting place in
[1:01:36] your heart thank you but he says that it
[1:01:39] was misunderstood they've they've been
[1:01:41] probing it it's probed that through six
[1:01:43] Church ages but at the end when the
[1:01:46] seventh angel begins to sound his
[1:01:49] mystery he winds up all the Loose Ends
[1:01:52] that these fellows probed at Oh Glory
[1:01:56] and the Mysteries come down from God as
[1:01:59] the word of God and reveals the entire
[1:02:02] revelation of God listen look look what
[1:02:05] he's saying here he's in
[1:02:08] because Revelation 10:7 says the
[1:02:11] mystery of
[1:02:13] God it doesn't say
[1:02:16] Mysteries once you understand the
[1:02:19] mystery all the other Mysteries make
[1:02:23] sense if you understand the mystery of
[1:02:26] like I said to you at the very beginning
[1:02:27] that Adam was was Adam and Eve God was
[1:02:31] male and
[1:02:32] female superior male Superior female was
[1:02:36] in Adam it was God then you will
[1:02:40] understand the lie that the serpent came
[1:02:43] and said You shall be like God if you
[1:02:46] listen to me why how could she become
[1:02:49] like God because God was a Creator he
[1:02:51] could speak he could create and Satan
[1:02:55] wanted to be a Creator but he couldn't
[1:02:57] speak creation he could only use God's
[1:03:00] law of reproduction that said let every
[1:03:03] seed bring forth of its own kind now you
[1:03:06] see when you understand the mystery of
[1:03:09] God and who he is and what his plan was
[1:03:13] now the serpent Seed doctrine the
[1:03:16] teaching on the serpent seed becomes
[1:03:19] clear it's no longer a
[1:03:21] mystery adultery is the number one cause
[1:03:26] of broken marriages yes broken
[1:03:29] families broken lives on
[1:03:34] Earth I I'm not saying it just Google
[1:03:36] search
[1:03:38] it today you get married you better flip
[1:03:41] a coin without the Holy Ghost you got a
[1:03:45] less than 50/50
[1:03:47] chance that your marriage is even going
[1:03:49] to make it oh yeah because Satan his
[1:03:54] desire was to have a family too but his
[1:03:58] family is perverted anything that God
[1:04:01] did Satan wanted to to to do it better
[1:04:05] and the only way he thinks he can do it
[1:04:06] better is by perverting it and that's
[1:04:08] why the people today they don't want the
[1:04:10] word they don't want to hear you tell
[1:04:12] them about Real Marriage that a man
[1:04:15] leaves his father and his mother and
[1:04:17] they two shall be joined as one all of
[1:04:19] that had a purpose in it God doesn't
[1:04:22] want people to be going from church to
[1:04:24] church because the woman and always
[1:04:26] represented the church God don't want
[1:04:28] you married to this one this week oh
[1:04:30] I'll go to the Baptist next week oh you
[1:04:32] know what I think I like Jehovah Witness
[1:04:35] maybe I'll go there you're hopping from
[1:04:37] church to church because you haven't
[1:04:39] found the right husband you're looking
[1:04:42] for a husband and there's only one
[1:04:45] husband to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:04:48] she's the unadulterated word of God
[1:04:50] remember Eve came from his side she will
[1:04:54] be exactly bone of his bone flesh of his
[1:04:57] flesh his spirit will will you know a
[1:04:59] lot of people say Danny you lost your
[1:05:01] mind you're absolutely right I'll show
[1:05:03] you the scripture that says that I've
[1:05:05] put on the mind of
[1:05:06] Christ Hallelujah because he's the only
[1:05:09] real mind in this day and in this hour
[1:05:12] that can bring peace and and and shity
[1:05:15] and Truth to the word of God Amen
[1:05:17] Hallelujah praise God and so they've
[1:05:20] they've they've looked at it and the
[1:05:21] mystery comes down from God as the word
[1:05:23] of God and reveals the entire revelation
[1:05:26] of God and then the godhead and
[1:05:28] everything else is settled look all the
[1:05:30] Mysteries see there it is serpent seed
[1:05:33] and whatever more is to be revealed now
[1:05:37] now you see I'm not just making that up
[1:05:40] that's what that's he says that's thus
[1:05:42] sayeth the Lord he was in the office of
[1:05:44] a prophet and when the anointing came on
[1:05:47] him on the opening of the word and he
[1:05:49] saw it as clear as he saw it it was
[1:05:51] because God was revealing it and he knew
[1:05:54] that it was God hallelujah praise God
[1:05:57] Amen thank you Jesus glory to God Amen
[1:06:01] and so here now we recognize that these
[1:06:04] things are are are taking place and the
[1:06:07] world just doesn't realize what what the
[1:06:10] real meaning of of of the book and and
[1:06:12] the word and the Plan of Redemption is
[1:06:15] all about and they're caught up into
[1:06:17] world's doctrines and man like we said
[1:06:20] has created his own
[1:06:22] book he writes it the way he wants our
[1:06:25] church
[1:06:26] trinitarian you want to be baptized you
[1:06:28] can be baptized we only baptize in the
[1:06:30] name of the father and of the son and of
[1:06:32] the Holy Spirit well what's the
[1:06:35] difference you might as well baptize in
[1:06:36] the name of the Sharon uh the the the
[1:06:39] the the the the Rosa Sharon or the lily
[1:06:42] of the valley because he's described in
[1:06:44] all of those ways but when acts
[1:06:47] 238 Peter anointed by the Holy Spirit
[1:06:50] having received instruction from Jesus
[1:06:52] Christ himself after he had been
[1:06:55] resurrected Ed gives him the formula to
[1:06:57] go out baptizing in the name of the Lord
[1:07:00] Jesus Christ and so we know that that's
[1:07:03] proper baptism it doesn't save you but
[1:07:07] it shows that you've got a revelation of
[1:07:09] what you believe it's an outward
[1:07:12] expression of something that's changed
[1:07:14] in you we got a sister that's going to
[1:07:16] be baptized next week that was baptized
[1:07:19] as a young woman but she says I did it
[1:07:22] out of fear I didn't realize what I was
[1:07:23] doing at the time I need to be
[1:07:26] re-baptized because this word that I'm
[1:07:29] hearing now I'm identifying with this
[1:07:31] word hallelujah glory to God and she
[1:07:34] realizes that something has changed on
[1:07:36] the inside and she wants to go to the
[1:07:38] Waters of
[1:07:39] [Applause]
[1:07:41] baptism let's go to the next quote and
[1:07:44] these things that we're talking about
[1:07:46] was to be revealed at the last day just
[1:07:49] before the last trumpet at the end of
[1:07:52] the message of the last Church age
[1:07:56] so listen carefully here what we're
[1:07:59] feeding on and what is being revealed to
[1:08:01] us this is the last time this is going
[1:08:04] to be revealed in the last time we've
[1:08:06] read these scriptures Daniel said seal
[1:08:08] It Up Until the End
[1:08:11] Time Jesus said it'll be known in the
[1:08:15] end time he says when you see the Fig
[1:08:17] Tree we talked about that a few weeks
[1:08:19] ago Israel becoming a nation in 1948 he
[1:08:24] said that generation that sees that will
[1:08:27] not pass away and we looked at how many
[1:08:30] years was a generation and we see that
[1:08:32] it's somewhere between 75 and 80 years
[1:08:35] well do the math from 1948 to where we
[1:08:38] are today we're we're there we're right
[1:08:41] in the ballpark Saints and God is a
[1:08:45] mathematician okay God is a
[1:08:48] mathematician and you will find him
[1:08:51] perfect he doesn't make mistakes if we
[1:08:55] you if you really want to research God's
[1:08:57] numerology and God's math go and go and
[1:09:00] search it it'll blow your mind you will
[1:09:02] see it everywhere Hallelujah so he says
[1:09:06] here he says it'll be revealed in the
[1:09:08] last Church age that's where we're at
[1:09:09] now it's we're at the end of it it's
[1:09:12] already over we've entered in the true
[1:09:15] church has already passed out of leoda
[1:09:18] and she's already moved into the Eternal
[1:09:20] Church age because it's an eternal
[1:09:22] Messenger to that age who's the Eternal
[1:09:24] messenger that came down in 1963 Jesus
[1:09:27] Christ how's he speaking to us today
[1:09:30] through a five-fold Ministry he he says
[1:09:33] I'm going to perfect my church now I'm
[1:09:35] going to call them I'm going to position
[1:09:37] them it's all about adoption it's all
[1:09:39] about God placing you giving you your
[1:09:42] position in the word of God and
[1:09:43] recognizing where you are supposed to be
[1:09:46] amen you've moved churches or you've you
[1:09:49] you're being pulled here and there
[1:09:51] because we're right at the end God is
[1:09:53] bringing into the body exactly who is
[1:09:56] supposed to be there he has a purpose
[1:09:59] for every s he says bone to its bone so
[1:10:04] if you're a part of my bone you can't
[1:10:06] escape this body because it's got to be
[1:10:10] bone to its bone it's the portion of the
[1:10:13] word of God that you are connecting with
[1:10:15] the portion of the word of God that's
[1:10:17] being assembled right here under this
[1:10:19] local Ministry whatever Ministry you
[1:10:21] might be under if it's that's where God
[1:10:24] is feeding you
[1:10:26] God God revealing himself to you there
[1:10:28] God making this message real to you and
[1:10:30] giving you
[1:10:32] life then you know you're in the right
[1:10:35] place I'm not pulling people from other
[1:10:38] churches I could be asking for a whole
[1:10:40] bunch of
[1:10:42] trouble there's three kinds of Believers
[1:10:44] in every church I'm not here to say
[1:10:47] you're a Believer you're an unbeliever
[1:10:48] you're a Believer you're no no you will
[1:10:50] identify by the life that you live I
[1:10:54] don't need to identify you the word is
[1:10:56] going to identify you the word is going
[1:10:59] to show if you're really really knowing
[1:11:02] who you are and you know that you know
[1:11:06] hallelujah praise God Amen God adds to
[1:11:09] the church such as should be saved we
[1:11:11] only want what God wants to add to the
[1:11:14] church and even more so as the day
[1:11:16] approaches amen praise God and so he
[1:11:19] says here in Revelations he says he says
[1:11:24] and and I just ref ref to you last night
[1:11:26] three times Revelations 10 1-7 see and
[1:11:30] in the days of the sounding of the
[1:11:32] seventh Angel's message the mystery of
[1:11:34] God would be revealed and finished and
[1:11:37] there's only one thing left when this
[1:11:40] seventh sealed book is open than the
[1:11:43] entire mystery of God why we've probed
[1:11:48] at it through through years and
[1:11:51] according to the scripture then we there
[1:11:54] was no way to understand it until this
[1:12:00] day you got to you got to realize that
[1:12:03] there's there's aspects of the word that
[1:12:06] you will not understand until it's your
[1:12:10] appointed
[1:12:12] day you can't force God you can't people
[1:12:16] want to be able to identify and they
[1:12:18] want to right off the pulpit they'll say
[1:12:20] oh nonsense they're not preaching
[1:12:22] they're preaching Pentecostal teachings
[1:12:25] it's a Pentecostal religion Pentecostal
[1:12:28] religion listen there is life in the
[1:12:31] church and once in a while you feel like
[1:12:33] shouting hallelujah praise God is
[1:12:36] because you've got a revelation and
[1:12:37] something stimulates you by the word of
[1:12:40] God to say amen glory to God but this is
[1:12:43] not a a a Spirit Revival oh watch no sir
[1:12:48] it's not about a Spirit Revival the
[1:12:50] reason why they're they're they're
[1:12:52] they're trying to identify those things
[1:12:54] and trying to to to to uh you know mock
[1:12:57] those things and say oh that didn't do
[1:12:59] anything that that that's not the word
[1:13:01] of God because they have no
[1:13:04] Revelation and they can't express
[1:13:06] Revelation their lives can't catch
[1:13:10] Revelation they think they've got
[1:13:12] Revelation but all they've got is quotes
[1:13:15] and and and doctrines and teachings of
[1:13:18] man and their own intellectual
[1:13:21] understanding of the word we don't want
[1:13:23] our own intellectual remember we said we
[1:13:26] take on the mind of Christ this this
[1:13:28] happens supernaturally a move of God is
[1:13:32] Supernatural it's not it's not
[1:13:34] orchestrated by man it's not okay we're
[1:13:36] going to bring these ones in we're going
[1:13:37] to bring in this one here we're this one
[1:13:39] here's got a a certain gift of you know
[1:13:42] he's a businessman you better be careful
[1:13:44] you could bring a businessman in here
[1:13:47] that all he's looking to do is catch the
[1:13:49] Sheep because he's got a business
[1:13:52] program in his mind thinking oh boy I
[1:13:54] can can bring together all those people
[1:13:57] you know I got I got this new business
[1:13:59] and if I can bring them in I can make a
[1:14:01] whole lot of money and you know what
[1:14:03] that does scatters the
[1:14:05] Sheep we're not looking for that we're
[1:14:08] this is not the hour for that this is
[1:14:11] this is God's business this is about the
[1:14:14] business of the Bride coming into her
[1:14:17] full position as a as a as a an
[1:14:20] attribute of God knowing who she is
[1:14:23] recognizing what portion
[1:14:25] of the word is now being fulfilled in
[1:14:28] her
[1:14:29] life and there was no way to understand
[1:14:32] it until this day because it's been
[1:14:35] hid that book was sealed and it had
[1:14:38] seven seals on that book but in
[1:14:41] Revelations 10 when he comes the mighty
[1:14:44] Angel which is Christ it's God it's
[1:14:46] Elohim yeah it's the the white wigged
[1:14:48] one the same the same God the Alpha and
[1:14:52] the Omega and he stood on the land and
[1:14:54] on on the sea the book was open because
[1:14:58] the lamb went and took the book from the
[1:15:02] one that was in the throne in other
[1:15:04] words he was going to be from lamb now
[1:15:09] from from from savior as a lamb that was
[1:15:13] slain before the foundations of the
[1:15:15] world to a to a man son of man Jesus
[1:15:20] Christ in the form of the of of of the
[1:15:24] theophany
[1:15:25] coming to express that he could have
[1:15:28] fellowship with his Brethren that he was
[1:15:31] going to connect with the other
[1:15:34] attributes of God he would say listen
[1:15:38] they have
[1:15:39] ears but they hear
[1:15:41] not but my sheep they hear my voice you
[1:15:46] see he was he was coming but a lot of
[1:15:48] people are hearing the word of God today
[1:15:51] they're reading the word of God but
[1:15:54] they're deny in the word of God they
[1:15:56] they will literally reject the word I've
[1:15:58] talked to ministers that have been
[1:16:01] studying the Bible longer than me and
[1:16:05] will try and convince me that there's
[1:16:07] three gods in
[1:16:08] one it just can't
[1:16:11] happen it's just
[1:16:13] impossible and the reason why they see
[1:16:15] it that way is because they their their
[1:16:18] their eyes have not been open to who he
[1:16:21] really is but in the seventh Angel's
[1:16:24] message message that's why you got to be
[1:16:26] careful when somebody tells you about a
[1:16:28] a messenger that came in
[1:16:30] 1963 to open the word of God and bring a
[1:16:34] progression to the word of God you got
[1:16:35] to be careful what you say about that
[1:16:38] man because Jesus Christ said I'll
[1:16:41] forgive you but when the Holy Ghost
[1:16:44] comes in his office of prophets and men
[1:16:49] to bring the unadulterated pure word of
[1:16:51] God you better be careful if you're not
[1:16:53] certain then keep your mouth shut and
[1:16:56] just wait and say Lord if this man has
[1:16:59] some sort of real significance to the
[1:17:02] world then I want to know about it let
[1:17:05] me humble myself and let your spirit
[1:17:08] reveal and let me search the scriptures
[1:17:11] you know what people don't take the time
[1:17:12] to search they don't want it they don't
[1:17:15] want to search they'll do one search and
[1:17:17] the first thing they'll put in is
[1:17:19] scam brandom boom oh yeah there it is
[1:17:24] it's it's all a cult it's all a scam
[1:17:27] there it is they don't want to put in
[1:17:30] William brandham 7eventh Church age
[1:17:33] messenger opening of the Seven Seals and
[1:17:35] then actually
[1:17:36] read look look into it look deeper into
[1:17:41] it allow your spirit to just be humbled
[1:17:44] for a moment don't let that ego get all
[1:17:47] a hold of you there because I know ego
[1:17:49] is a terrible thing it's it's it's it's
[1:17:51] so powerful man the man hates to be
[1:17:53] wrong he hates to be wrong he just you
[1:17:57] know even people that are born again
[1:18:00] people that are born again believing
[1:18:02] this message you know you got to be
[1:18:04] careful you talk a little bit to you
[1:18:06] know you get a little bit too far right
[1:18:08] away you see them raise up and say oh no
[1:18:11] no no no no you're not seeing it the way
[1:18:12] I'm seeing it let me tell you the way I
[1:18:14] see it I'm not interested in that I'm
[1:18:16] interested in the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:18:18] interested in the spirit of God coming
[1:18:20] into the midst and and unveiling himself
[1:18:23] in such a way that we both see it and
[1:18:25] now we know where the glory needs to go
[1:18:27] where the praise needs to go amen
[1:18:29] hallelujah where we need to look to God
[1:18:32] and see him in the power of his
[1:18:33] resurrection and that he can unveil
[1:18:36] himself to whom he
[1:18:37] chooses you can't figure out God you
[1:18:41] can't take anything from God you can't
[1:18:44] give God imagine a creation trying to
[1:18:46] tell the Creator I'm telling you the way
[1:18:49] it is good
[1:18:51] luck he says hath not the
[1:18:55] the ability to crush and remake the
[1:19:00] clay I thank God that he crushed and
[1:19:02] remade me this clay was a mess thank you
[1:19:06] Jesus you can look in your own life and
[1:19:08] you can see what God has done for you
[1:19:10] amen glory to God hallelujah hallelujah
[1:19:12] we've seen the symbols what it what it
[1:19:14] was symbolized by but but could not be
[1:19:17] correctly revealed until the last day
[1:19:20] see now then we must be there at the end
[1:19:24] time
[1:19:25] there's where everything is going to be
[1:19:28] revealed at the last
[1:19:30] time we're there I'm declaring it to you
[1:19:34] Saints I'm not saying it's tomorrow or
[1:19:36] the next day but all the things that
[1:19:40] Jesus told us to be watch he says watch
[1:19:43] for false christs he says many of them
[1:19:46] are going to rise up in that day they're
[1:19:49] going to rise up and they're going to
[1:19:50] say Lo he's here Lo he's there to the
[1:19:53] bride she's watching the word she's not
[1:19:56] watching churches she's not watching
[1:19:59] YouTube programs that the last
[1:20:01] Revelation must be seen unveiled five
[1:20:05] minutes ago you ever see those two those
[1:20:07] YouTube
[1:20:08] videos revealed five minutes ago of the
[1:20:12] coming of the Lord I said my goodness
[1:20:15] you guys missed it by 70
[1:20:19] years glory to God Amen praise God God
[1:20:22] is already on the scene he's already
[1:20:25] calling a people he's already Gathering
[1:20:27] his church one's going to be taken out
[1:20:29] of the bed one will be left behind you
[1:20:30] know how many marriages have been broken
[1:20:32] as a result of this
[1:20:34] message because the Revelation comes to
[1:20:37] one doesn't come to the
[1:20:38] other you know how many families have
[1:20:41] been broken up because of this message
[1:20:43] and I'm not saying when I say this
[1:20:45] message I want to make it clear it's the
[1:20:48] message of Jesus Christ the word for our
[1:20:51] day it's Christ just like the way he
[1:20:53] came 20 years ago he's the same
[1:20:55] yesterday today and forever he says I
[1:20:58] don't come to bring peace he didn't but
[1:21:01] he's not saying I've come to destroy no
[1:21:04] he's come to bring the word the sword he
[1:21:08] says I've come to bring the sword what
[1:21:10] is the sword it's the word and the word
[1:21:13] when it's when it's properly identified
[1:21:15] and properly you know placed you're if
[1:21:19] you've got representation in you that
[1:21:22] says Amen to the word it's because you
[1:21:24] were always an attribute of God there
[1:21:28] was never a time that you would have
[1:21:30] said yeah you could have said no
[1:21:32] temporarily when you were in that
[1:21:34] condition that you were in but once God
[1:21:36] gets through to you was like Frank you
[1:21:38] know he says I remember when you came
[1:21:40] you know you come into the church you
[1:21:42] come into this into the store every
[1:21:43] morning we were just talking about it
[1:21:45] last week he says you'd come in he says
[1:21:47] you know you'd be listening to brother
[1:21:49] brandham and you be talking about this
[1:21:51] messenger and you be talking about how
[1:21:53] we we need to see this this this is this
[1:21:55] is amazing and and I was sitting back
[1:21:57] listening I thought you know and then
[1:21:59] and then he says I remember when you
[1:22:00] gave me a t I said just
[1:22:03] listen take the time to
[1:22:05] listen and he says I took
[1:22:09] it and his life went
[1:22:13] whoop upside down the Holy Spirit opened
[1:22:17] up his understanding he said that's the
[1:22:20] prophet of Malachi 4:5 that's God's word
[1:22:24] that's God unveiling himself in our day
[1:22:26] that's God sending a message to all
[1:22:28] these confused churches no wonder you
[1:22:30] you don't know which church to go to you
[1:22:32] have no idea where the truth is but God
[1:22:35] is not the author of confusion God will
[1:22:37] make it plain and he'll make it real to
[1:22:40] you
[1:22:41] personal that's the beauty of this
[1:22:44] that's why I always tell people listen
[1:22:46] Danny oh Danny you know tell me about
[1:22:48] your church I said you know what you
[1:22:50] need to come and
[1:22:51] see come and hear the word and see what
[1:22:54] it does for you that's all I can say
[1:22:58] because it's not me that's going to
[1:22:59] convince them if I convince them
[1:23:01] somebody will take them out their family
[1:23:04] or their friends will say get away from
[1:23:05] that man that guy's
[1:23:07] cuckoo he's too
[1:23:09] religious we're a million miles from
[1:23:13] religion we are Sons and Daughters of
[1:23:16] the Living God that have recognized that
[1:23:18] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:23:21] forever hallelujah praise God Amen amen
[1:23:25] and so here let's let's let's move along
[1:23:27] here he says now the reason that John
[1:23:29] wept because if no one could get the
[1:23:32] book all creation everything was
[1:23:35] gone you imagine the whole Old Testament
[1:23:38] you barely even hear anything about a
[1:23:41] book you might hear a little bit in
[1:23:43] Ezekiel you might hear a little you know
[1:23:44] here there but you don't hear about it
[1:23:47] in this
[1:23:48] way but the Book of Revelation is the
[1:23:51] end time book it's all about revealing
[1:23:54] the end and the things that are going to
[1:23:56] happen in the end time and a lot of
[1:23:59] people want to take the Book of
[1:24:00] Revelation and put it way off into a
[1:24:02] future but the Book of Revelation has
[1:24:04] been talking about the end and you know
[1:24:06] when it started 2,000 years ago when he
[1:24:09] was on the on the AL pmos because a lot
[1:24:12] of those Church ages all those seven
[1:24:13] Church ages they've already passed
[1:24:16] everything that was under seal number
[1:24:18] one to seal number six was all under the
[1:24:21] seven Church
[1:24:23] ages and all those things had been
[1:24:25] opened under the Sixth Seal first world
[1:24:28] war second world war and there's another
[1:24:31] one coming and it says woe three it it's
[1:24:35] go there's one more to
[1:24:37] come so we need to place everything
[1:24:40] properly into its proper season and
[1:24:43] recognize what it is that was unveiled
[1:24:45] nobody know nobody understood the White
[1:24:48] Horse writer if you had to talked to any
[1:24:50] and even a lot of churches today if they
[1:24:52] hadn't heard the message that William
[1:24:54] brandham brought in
[1:24:56] 1963 on the opening of those Seven Seals
[1:24:59] they would have been a lot of them would
[1:25:01] have still been believing that the white
[1:25:03] horse rider was
[1:25:05] Jesus the first horse rider in in the
[1:25:08] Book of Revelation and the second horse
[1:25:11] rider they would have thought that the
[1:25:12] red horse rider was Jesus just taking on
[1:25:15] you know and and and putting on a
[1:25:18] crown and then the black horse rider you
[1:25:21] know going to the people and
[1:25:23] establishing ing the churches and and
[1:25:25] and and the wars and and all of the all
[1:25:28] of the you got to go back and study
[1:25:29] we're going to do a study on those on
[1:25:31] those Seven Seals again I believe it'll
[1:25:33] be a blessing but nobody knew or
[1:25:35] understood that those horse riders were
[1:25:38] Satan changing his
[1:25:40] disguise he was going from religious to
[1:25:44] joining with the church in the in the in
[1:25:46] as the red horse rider connecting with
[1:25:48] the church and state making it look like
[1:25:51] that that that Christ listen you go back
[1:25:53] to a D 3:25 and you will find out that
[1:25:57] that was where they instituted baptism
[1:26:00] in the titles of Father Son and Holy
[1:26:03] Ghost you can go back and Google search
[1:26:06] it it'll tell you Nia Council 325 ad it
[1:26:11] was when they actually instituted
[1:26:14] baptism up until that point it was all
[1:26:17] done in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:26:19] Christ there's magazines with articles
[1:26:22] that show this
[1:26:24] but it was the Catholic church under
[1:26:27] Constantine joining church with State
[1:26:30] and who's joined with the state right up
[1:26:32] until this
[1:26:35] day church and state they still have
[1:26:38] power over the state and politics amen
[1:26:42] but they didn't know these things these
[1:26:44] things were all written under those
[1:26:47] Seven Seals and it took a messenger to
[1:26:49] come and break those seals to loose what
[1:26:52] was under those seals and even when even
[1:26:55] when when when the book and the seals
[1:26:57] were were were released seven Thunders
[1:26:59] uttered their voices and John was told
[1:27:02] to seal it up don't write those things
[1:27:05] because those things that were written
[1:27:06] into those seven Thunders pertained to
[1:27:09] another group of people
[1:27:13] yeah that would receive faith in this
[1:27:17] day and in this hour Hallelujah let's
[1:27:20] move along and so he says here he says
[1:27:24] everything would be gone imagine the
[1:27:26] whole the all of creation would be gone
[1:27:29] in other words everything would just
[1:27:31] stop and the whole Plan of Redemption
[1:27:34] would have stopped had nobody gotten a
[1:27:37] hold of that book and was able to open
[1:27:39] that book so that somebody could
[1:27:42] receive their word for their day and
[1:27:46] progress and fulfill their part in the
[1:27:50] word not he says my word shall not
[1:27:54] return unto me void so every scripture
[1:27:57] that he spoke and wrote about prophecy
[1:28:01] into the future has to be
[1:28:04] fulfilled heavens and earth will pass
[1:28:06] away but his word it will not pass and
[1:28:09] that's why he could not break the
[1:28:12] pattern of the restoration of bringing
[1:28:16] Adam back into his and her rightful
[1:28:20] position keep that in mind Saints
[1:28:23] there's a reason for the book there's a
[1:28:25] reason why God had all of this where
[1:28:28] imagine all of creation would have been
[1:28:30] lost everything would have been L he
[1:28:31] goes on she would just simply turn back
[1:28:33] to atoms and molecules and so forth and
[1:28:36] Cosmic light and not even be creation
[1:28:39] person nothing else cuz Adam lost the
[1:28:43] rights to that
[1:28:46] book
[1:28:48] what remember we
[1:28:50] said Adam was in the expressed image of
[1:28:53] God
[1:28:54] he held the book he had the whole plan
[1:28:58] all everything was perfectly set in the
[1:29:00] mind of
[1:29:02] God but he lost it when he when he
[1:29:06] allowed Eve to fall into sin and then
[1:29:10] gave
[1:29:11] himself for to redeem her and that's all
[1:29:14] a type remember Jesus came to give
[1:29:18] himself to redeem the Gentile church
[1:29:21] back to
[1:29:22] himself everything so the pattern cannot
[1:29:25] be
[1:29:26] broken so here now he realizes that Adam
[1:29:30] lost the rights to the book he forfeited
[1:29:33] when he listened to his wife and she
[1:29:35] listened to Satan's reasoning instead of
[1:29:38] the word of God when that When God Says
[1:29:41] You shall not eat of the tree of Good
[1:29:44] and Evil well that tree was the serpent
[1:29:48] he's still the same tree today in in
[1:29:51] today's civilization people are reading
[1:29:53] from the book book of the Tree of Life
[1:29:55] of Good and Evil I had a long discussion
[1:29:59] with my oldest daughter the other day it
[1:30:00] was fantastic I could believe how much
[1:30:03] Revelation she's actually
[1:30:05] caught it's it's amazing they're so
[1:30:09] close they're they're just pondering
[1:30:12] around it because they've tapped into
[1:30:15] what the what the Tree of Life of Good
[1:30:18] and Evil is here but Satan's
[1:30:21] only aspect that he could use because it
[1:30:25] would be so deceiving that it would
[1:30:26] deceive even the very elect if it were
[1:30:30] possible but the one thing that he knew
[1:30:33] he had to do was he needed to have his
[1:30:35] own creation of people he needed to have
[1:30:38] his own bride that would listen and
[1:30:42] follow his
[1:30:44] teaching so that they could take their
[1:30:46] eyes away
[1:30:48] from the
[1:30:50] word he said it in the beginning the day
[1:30:53] that you eat eat thereof you shall
[1:30:56] surely die that never
[1:30:58] changed when you feed on the word of
[1:31:01] knowledge good and evil I don't care how
[1:31:04] beautiful and how pure that glass of
[1:31:07] water is One Drop of Poison and you're
[1:31:10] done that's all it
[1:31:14] takes but that's what the enemy did and
[1:31:17] that's why this whole restoration cannot
[1:31:20] be broken the pattern cannot be broken
[1:31:23] he's looking for a bride without spot or
[1:31:25] wrinkle I'm not talking about people
[1:31:28] that are perfect you'll never be perfect
[1:31:29] brother Gabe I'll never be perfect
[1:31:32] there's not one person in here that'll
[1:31:34] ever be perfect and I'm not saying that
[1:31:36] to anybody oh you got to be perfect to
[1:31:38] come to this church no sir mostly the
[1:31:42] ones that are imperfect are the ones
[1:31:43] that come here because they know they
[1:31:45] need God they know they can't do it on
[1:31:48] their own they know they need a higher
[1:31:50] power over what's controlling them and
[1:31:52] and and the reason why
[1:31:54] they can't overcome and they're still in
[1:31:56] this cycle they get up one day and then
[1:31:58] the next day they're back down on their
[1:32:00] face again they get up they get down why
[1:32:03] because they haven't met the one that
[1:32:05] the woman at the well met y who was in
[1:32:07] worse shape than any one of us here yes
[1:32:10] had five husbands a prostitute but when
[1:32:14] she got a drink of that water woo
[1:32:16] Hallelujah glory to God that's the water
[1:32:19] I'm feasting on that's the water that
[1:32:21] gives life that's the water that that
[1:32:24] caused her to get so excited she became
[1:32:26] so bold even as a prostitute she went in
[1:32:29] and her testimony converted the town woo
[1:32:32] glory to God hallelujah let the Holy
[1:32:35] Spirit get a hold of you one of these
[1:32:36] days I'll tell you it'll change your
[1:32:38] life it'll transform you it'll make you
[1:32:41] who you're supposed to be glory to God
[1:32:44] hallelujah glory amen Adam lost the
[1:32:47] rights of that book he forfeited it when
[1:32:48] he listened to his wife and she listened
[1:32:50] to Satan's reasoning then it couldn't go
[1:32:52] back into the dirty hand hands of Satan
[1:32:55] Satan could never receive Revelation no
[1:32:59] it had to go right back to the one who
[1:33:01] who had it in the beginning and that's
[1:33:03] why he kept it and he sat on the throne
[1:33:07] and he says this is all going to play
[1:33:08] out no
[1:33:10] worries I'm going to make sure that this
[1:33:13] book that I get back into my rightful
[1:33:17] position in the end time according to
[1:33:20] the season that I am going to come and I
[1:33:23] am going to re
[1:33:24] and I am going to be in her she will
[1:33:27] know that I am their God she is my
[1:33:30] people My Chosen my elect my
[1:33:33] body Flesh of My Flesh bone of my bone
[1:33:37] amen she will come to know it Hallelujah
[1:33:42] that it couldn't go back into the dirty
[1:33:43] hands of Satan who tempted her out of
[1:33:45] the way so therefore it went back to the
[1:33:48] original owner like any abstract deed
[1:33:51] only the original owner can go in and
[1:33:54] claim and redeem something that was his
[1:33:57] from
[1:33:59] before
[1:34:01] anything and he says you were written in
[1:34:04] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:34:07] foundations of this
[1:34:09] world this plan is just playing out
[1:34:12] you're just recognizing that you're an
[1:34:14] actor in the play you didn't know the
[1:34:17] part that you were going to play did
[1:34:18] you you walk in here one day and you
[1:34:21] thought oh this is an interesting Church
[1:34:24] this is
[1:34:25] interesting these people are
[1:34:28] interesting that guy's pretty zealous up
[1:34:33] there but something inside
[1:34:37] Burns did not our hearts
[1:34:41] burn every time I come to this church at
[1:34:44] in my early years and still to this day
[1:34:47] my heart burns within me when God speaks
[1:34:50] when I allow the spirit of God to speak
[1:34:53] and to to go into the to the Deep places
[1:34:56] of my life where he can set me free and
[1:34:58] I say thank you Lord have your way Lord
[1:35:01] deliver your servant Lord deliver your
[1:35:03] children Lord that's what this is all
[1:35:06] about Saints this has gone back now to
[1:35:09] the to the abstract deed has gone back
[1:35:11] to the to the original owner amen goes
[1:35:14] right back to its original owner and
[1:35:15] that was God the Creator who made it and
[1:35:18] he holds it and there's a price and
[1:35:21] that's Redemption and that's why the
[1:35:22] lamb who was slain from before the
[1:35:25] foundations of the world was was showing
[1:35:27] that there would be a lamb that would
[1:35:29] come and be born not of sex
[1:35:35] no your downfall as a human being and
[1:35:41] every single human being on this Earth
[1:35:45] is because you came by
[1:35:47] sex what is this guy
[1:35:50] crazy no I'm telling you
[1:35:54] you came by procreation by by an act
[1:35:57] between your mother and your father and
[1:35:59] it's all part of the plan so don't worry
[1:36:01] it's not you're
[1:36:03] cursed but that was the original
[1:36:07] curse and it needs to be reversed and
[1:36:10] the only way it's reversed is you must
[1:36:13] be born
[1:36:15] again you must be born again you've
[1:36:18] heard it but now you're you're starting
[1:36:20] to see you got to be born by the word
[1:36:23] the word has to awaken you the word and
[1:36:26] you'll respond to the word showing that
[1:36:28] there's a birth taking place and I don't
[1:36:31] know about you but when I went in and I
[1:36:32] watched the births of my children it was
[1:36:35] messy painful screaming but then comes
[1:36:39] forth life Hallelujah and there's no
[1:36:43] birth that's not going to be a little
[1:36:44] messy you're going to find yourself in
[1:36:46] situations people are going to say
[1:36:48] you're crazy what are you doing what are
[1:36:50] you doing forfeiting your religion
[1:36:52] giving up what youve been you were born
[1:36:54] a Catholic you got to die a
[1:36:57] Catholic but if you're born again you'll
[1:36:59] never die you'll be identified with
[1:37:02] eternal life thank you Jesus you will
[1:37:05] represent who you really are hallelujah
[1:37:08] praise God glory he says right back to
[1:37:11] the original and he says and there's a
[1:37:13] price and that price was Jesus Christ
[1:37:15] going to the Cross as a
[1:37:20] man as a man
[1:37:24] why did he have to go as a man he didn't
[1:37:26] have to go as a man and why did he have
[1:37:27] to come a virgin birth because he had to
[1:37:30] come the original way that Adam would
[1:37:33] have just looked to Eve and said eve
[1:37:35] you're going to bring forth
[1:37:38] Gabriel and in her womb would have been
[1:37:42] instantly a
[1:37:44] seed if that's how God wanted to do it
[1:37:47] all could have also called him right out
[1:37:50] of that Dimension like Jesus when he
[1:37:51] walked right into the room with the the
[1:37:53] the apostles and the disciples and they
[1:37:56] looked they said Lord is that you he
[1:37:59] walked through the
[1:38:01] wall he was in his theophany body he had
[1:38:03] a body that could move between
[1:38:06] dimensions and that's the kind of body
[1:38:08] that you are sitting next to right
[1:38:11] now that's speaking to your heart that's
[1:38:15] making you understand what it is that's
[1:38:16] coming off of this Pulpit that's giving
[1:38:19] you
[1:38:21] something Amnesia lifting from your mind
[1:38:24] and you're recognizing something and you
[1:38:25] just you you can see it but you can't
[1:38:28] fully don't worry about it let it
[1:38:30] unfold you can go back and listen to
[1:38:33] this message and you can listen to other
[1:38:35] message you go back and go back and
[1:38:36] listen the God of this evil age go back
[1:38:39] and listen to messages Christ The
[1:38:42] Mystery of God revealed the spoken word
[1:38:45] is the Original Seed go back and listen
[1:38:47] to those messages you will hear things
[1:38:50] that you never heard before because a
[1:38:52] little more of the veil is has been
[1:38:54] lifted hallelujah who made it and he
[1:38:57] holds it and there's a price and that's
[1:38:59] Redemption there's some price for
[1:39:00] Redemption and there was nobody that
[1:39:02] could do it so he said made his laws his
[1:39:05] own laws of kinsman redeemer that's why
[1:39:09] a Kinsman had to go a Kinsman is a man
[1:39:12] Flesh and Blood that's what a Kinsman is
[1:39:16] a theophany could not go to the cross it
[1:39:19] couldn't even die it wouldn't die
[1:39:21] because it's it's Eternal so had to go
[1:39:23] as a man a kinsman redeemer amen that
[1:39:27] there's all kinds of types go back and
[1:39:28] read the book of Ruth and and how Boaz
[1:39:31] was the Redeemer and all you know glory
[1:39:34] to God there's it's everywhere then they
[1:39:37] could find nobody everybody was born of
[1:39:40] sex born of sexual desire he was in the
[1:39:44] original sin Satan and Eve so he could
[1:39:49] not do it there is no man that's why
[1:39:52] there wasn't there was no man that
[1:39:54] that's why the original sin was Satan
[1:39:56] and Eve bringing forth Cain and Abel
[1:39:59] Cain comes out and he's a murderer why
[1:40:01] was he a murderer because he was like
[1:40:03] his father the
[1:40:04] devil but Abel who went and was brought
[1:40:07] forth because when Eve went to Adam and
[1:40:10] said look at this this is amazing you
[1:40:12] got to do this with me it brought forth
[1:40:15] Abel and Abel had a revelation of who he
[1:40:19] was because he was coming through a son
[1:40:22] of God
[1:40:24] Hallelujah and he knew what to give as a
[1:40:26] sacrifice and that's why Cain was
[1:40:29] jealous because he saw Abel giving a
[1:40:32] sacrifice unto the Lord it was a lamb
[1:40:34] because it had to be a lamb that would
[1:40:36] come and redeem his bride the Lamb of
[1:40:39] God that would take away the sins of the
[1:40:42] world and Abel by faith the Bible says
[1:40:46] Abel by Faith by Revelation made an
[1:40:49] acceptable sacrifice unto the Lord and
[1:40:51] God accepted it and rejected Cain's
[1:40:54] sacrifice because he knew he was of his
[1:40:56] father the
[1:40:57] devil and Cain goes and kills the first
[1:41:01] murder in the Bible who was it Satan's
[1:41:06] son praise God no he says his own laws
[1:41:10] of kinsman redeemer then they could find
[1:41:13] nobody every man was born of sex born
[1:41:16] after sexual desire he was in the
[1:41:18] original sin Satan and need so he could
[1:41:21] not do it there is nothing in him no
[1:41:23] holy
[1:41:24] Pope priest doctor of divinity whoever
[1:41:28] he might be there was nobody worthy and
[1:41:31] he couldn't be an angel because it had
[1:41:33] to be a
[1:41:34] Kinsman it had to be a man if a man sin
[1:41:38] a man had to die but Jesus was a perfect
[1:41:41] man he had to be a a lamb without
[1:41:44] blemish when the children of Israel used
[1:41:46] to bring the lamb to cover their sin
[1:41:48] that lamb had to be a a a perfect lamb
[1:41:51] without any blemishes and they they slit
[1:41:53] the throat and the innocence of that
[1:41:55] lamb would go on The Sinner and it would
[1:41:57] cover their sin but it wouldn't take it
[1:41:59] away but Jesus took your sin away
[1:42:02] because you needed it you were a mess
[1:42:05] you were you were in sin you you done
[1:42:07] all kinds of stuff adultery uh lying
[1:42:10] cheating stealing you were doing it all
[1:42:12] but he says
[1:42:14] Justified as though you never done it in
[1:42:16] the first place you you you accept the
[1:42:19] blood of Christ you accept that that
[1:42:21] that sacrifice of redemption you're
[1:42:24] White Snow White as though you never
[1:42:26] done it in the first
[1:42:30] place glory and he couldn't be an angel
[1:42:33] because he had to be a Kinsman he had to
[1:42:35] be a man then God himself become a
[1:42:37] Kinsman by taking on human flesh through
[1:42:40] the Virgin birth and he shed his blood
[1:42:43] that wasn't the blood of a Jew it wasn't
[1:42:46] the blood of a gentile it was the blood
[1:42:48] of God
[1:42:50] himself it was the Holy Ghost that he
[1:42:52] had given went up when he died on the
[1:42:54] cross and he said it is finished and
[1:42:56] when the Holy Ghost came down on the day
[1:42:58] of Pentecost it was looking for his
[1:43:02] bride Hallelujah glory to God we're
[1:43:05] saved through the blood of God Amen
[1:43:09] Glory Hallelujah let's go on next
[1:43:12] scripture we're going to move a little
[1:43:13] quicker here but we're not going to
[1:43:14] finish at one but I hope you're going to
[1:43:17] be able to just take in what's coming
[1:43:19] forth amen and when he had taken the
[1:43:21] book The Four four beasts and four and
[1:43:24] 20 Elders fell down before the lamb
[1:43:27] every having every one of them Harps and
[1:43:29] golden vials full of odors which are the
[1:43:32] prayers of the Saints and they sang a
[1:43:35] new they sung a new song Imagine now
[1:43:39] remember it was always the 24 elders and
[1:43:43] the cherubims and the angels that were
[1:43:45] constantly giving worship unto the Lord
[1:43:49] the Almighty God but now they're singing
[1:43:52] a new song
[1:43:54] because he's he's gone into a
[1:43:57] new position he's now IM morphing
[1:44:01] himself from on the throne king of glory
[1:44:05] into a man that could now be slain and
[1:44:08] and take away the sins of the world now
[1:44:11] the Plan of Redemption could be
[1:44:13] fulfilled now there would be one that
[1:44:15] could go and actually fulfill the
[1:44:17] purpose they sang a new song and they
[1:44:19] said Thou Art Worthy to take the book
[1:44:23] and to who could be worthy other than
[1:44:25] God
[1:44:25] himself it wasn't a a a bloody lamb like
[1:44:28] an actual bleeding animal that went
[1:44:31] there and and went into the middle and
[1:44:33] and and he took the book he didn't just
[1:44:36] he said give me the book who can do that
[1:44:38] you can take anything from God you going
[1:44:40] to try to do
[1:44:42] that good luck Hallelujah Thou Art
[1:44:45] Worthy to take the book and to open the
[1:44:47] seals thereof for thou was slain and H
[1:44:50] has redeemed us to God by the blood of
[1:44:52] out of of every Kindred and tongue and
[1:44:56] people and nation and has made us unto
[1:44:59] our God Kings and priest he's talking
[1:45:01] about this Blood being good enough for
[1:45:04] anyone on the
[1:45:06] Earth right across the Earth nobody's
[1:45:10] exempt I don't care if you believe Allah
[1:45:12] and Muhammad if you can receive this
[1:45:14] Revelation today you will leave that and
[1:45:17] you will prostate before Jesus Christ as
[1:45:20] Savior and Redeemer Hal Hallelujah but
[1:45:23] you need you need a revelation on God
[1:45:25] you need a you need to know who he
[1:45:27] really is amen and they sang and he says
[1:45:30] and has made us unto our God Kings and
[1:45:33] Priests and we shall reign on
[1:45:36] earth now we're coming into something
[1:45:38] else here you mean there's a reason for
[1:45:43] taking the
[1:45:45] book and there's a reason why the one
[1:45:49] who took the book now that holds the
[1:45:51] book will play because remember a throne
[1:45:54] go back and read go back into history
[1:45:56] what is a throne it's where a king sits
[1:46:00] and a king in a throne has supreme
[1:46:05] authority he rules over the whole
[1:46:08] nation he says jump they jump he says
[1:46:12] sit they
[1:46:14] sit because it's his position as king he
[1:46:18] is the supreme leader supreme authority
[1:46:21] and now look look it he has made us unto
[1:46:24] our God Kings and Priests and we shall
[1:46:26] reign on Earth because remember this
[1:46:28] whole Plan of Redemption is here don't
[1:46:31] get caught up with the worlds were
[1:46:33] framed by the word of God there's other
[1:46:36] planets out there this is another thing
[1:46:37] you know people are going off into all
[1:46:38] these planets and they want to go into
[1:46:41] Mars they want to go here and there
[1:46:42] they're trying to look for what you're
[1:46:44] going to miss the whole Plan of
[1:46:46] Redemption and this Earth is going into
[1:46:47] a Great Tribulation and unless you
[1:46:49] receive the Holy Ghost for a Rapture
[1:46:52] you're going into tribulation with it
[1:46:55] and I don't know how you're going to end
[1:46:56] up how there's going to be survivors
[1:46:58] after the Great Tribulation there's
[1:47:00] going to be great the World War III is
[1:47:02] going to be ugly Saints it's going to be
[1:47:06] nuclear sorry that's
[1:47:09] scripture Hallelujah and I beheld and I
[1:47:12] heard a voice of many angels round about
[1:47:15] the throne and Beast and the elders and
[1:47:18] the number of them was 10,000s times 10
[1:47:21] thousands and thousands of
[1:47:23] thousands God had now come to a place
[1:47:27] where he was going to be
[1:47:29] redeeming and he had made a place now
[1:47:32] where we could be brought back to our
[1:47:35] rightful
[1:47:38] position like Adam and Eve was in the
[1:47:45] beginning glory to God
[1:47:48] Amen oh Jesus Hallelujah
[1:47:53] what slide number is
[1:47:56] that thank
[1:48:00] you let's go to the next
[1:48:06] slide brother Bram speaking here I know
[1:48:08] there's a lot of quotes here but this is
[1:48:10] where I'm drawing all this inspiration
[1:48:12] from Saints this messenger came to
[1:48:15] unveil the word and we need to pay
[1:48:18] attention here because we're talking
[1:48:20] about this open book and how important
[1:48:22] it is for this book now to be in our
[1:48:24] hands he says here now before we can lay
[1:48:27] down the lids of his Bible we can open
[1:48:31] up the Bible Lids but we cannot open up
[1:48:34] the
[1:48:35] Bible there's only one can do that and
[1:48:38] that's Christ remember we said they're
[1:48:41] reading from the Bible they're reading
[1:48:43] the same scriptures that we're reading
[1:48:44] but they're not seeing the same things
[1:48:46] that we're seeing here because Jesus
[1:48:49] himself says I open and no man shuts I
[1:48:53] shut no man will open the Bible is in
[1:48:56] the hand of God so now we know the one
[1:48:59] that sited on the throne he's holding a
[1:49:02] book now we know that it's the
[1:49:04] Bible you mean the Bible is the book
[1:49:08] yeah but the book is closed unless it's
[1:49:12] open to
[1:49:13] you the book is still closed to
[1:49:16] 99% of the Christian world out there
[1:49:19] they there's they got an open book
[1:49:21] They're reading the same scriptures but
[1:49:24] they're not seeing why God required a
[1:49:28] prophet in the 20th century to come and
[1:49:31] restore and open the understanding that
[1:49:34] was in those Thunders that was in that
[1:49:36] could not be written even Daniel said
[1:49:39] you got to seal that up that's not going
[1:49:41] to be available till the end
[1:49:43] time so there's things being released
[1:49:45] right now that that's what we're
[1:49:47] interested in knowing that's what we're
[1:49:49] interested in in in looking into the why
[1:49:51] why we need to be a part of
[1:49:55] that and he says here now it's in the
[1:49:58] hand of God on a throne like that and
[1:50:01] there was no man in heaven and no man in
[1:50:05] earth see how he's he's going back to
[1:50:07] that
[1:50:07] scripture he's going and no man beneath
[1:50:10] the Earth was worthy to take the Bible
[1:50:13] so now we understand that the Bible the
[1:50:16] book is the Bible but yet the book is
[1:50:19] open and yet the book is closed if you
[1:50:23] don't have the new birth and the
[1:50:25] revelation of the holy spirit that that
[1:50:28] gives the word life the letter kills but
[1:50:31] the spirit gives life Hallelujah bring
[1:50:36] the heat down a little
[1:50:38] bit to take the Bible to open it or to
[1:50:41] loose the Seven Seals that was sealed on
[1:50:44] the back side of it and John begin to
[1:50:46] weep and one of the elders said weep not
[1:50:49] for the lamb that was slain before the
[1:50:51] foundations of the world was wor worthy
[1:50:53] and able to take the book out of the
[1:50:55] right hand of him that sat upon the
[1:50:57] throne and to open it and to loose the
[1:51:00] seals thereof and that's the Lamb of God
[1:51:03] that was slain before the foundations of
[1:51:05] the world the lord Jesus
[1:51:09] Christ so who was the
[1:51:12] lamb the Lord Jesus Christ when was he
[1:51:16] slain before the foundations of the
[1:51:20] world who could take the book no man can
[1:51:23] go and just you can't walk up to a
[1:51:25] King's throne and just say give me that
[1:51:28] and take it from him you can't do it it
[1:51:30] was God moving from
[1:51:33] father into son so that he could go to
[1:51:36] the Earth and pay the ultimate sacrifice
[1:51:41] as a
[1:51:42] man Hallelujah glory to God he said weep
[1:51:46] not so and he and and to open it to
[1:51:49] loose the seals thereof and that's the
[1:51:51] Lamb of God God that was slain before
[1:51:54] the foundation of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:51:55] may he come this
[1:51:57] afternoon today and open our
[1:52:01] understanding may he take the things
[1:52:03] that's written in this book and give
[1:52:07] them out of the people give them out to
[1:52:10] the people just as they have need of it

[1:54:14] to to to to to you know work everything
[1:54:17] up I'm GNA bring camp meetings together
[1:54:19] I'm gonna put everything together just
[1:54:20] do the simple things that God listen we
[1:54:23] just need to get this word out we just
[1:54:25] need to allow the Holy Spirit to get
[1:54:26] this word and this Revelation into the
[1:54:29] hearts of the five-fold ministry and and
[1:54:31] not get caught up people want to stop at
[1:54:33] William
[1:54:34] brandham they just want to stop right
[1:54:36] there that's the you know that's the
[1:54:37] danger you know here when God was moving
[1:54:40] through Luther and Wesley if the people
[1:54:44] didn't move on from Luther and go with
[1:54:47] Wesley and then move on to Pentecost if
[1:54:50] they had just because a lot of people
[1:54:51] they stopped at p p and meanwhile
[1:54:54] William brandham was the messenger to
[1:54:55] the Pentecostal age to open they were
[1:54:59] they were rejoicing over the gifts they
[1:55:01] still do they'll bring you into the
[1:55:02] church and they'll try to move your
[1:55:03] mouth to speak in tongues come on speak
[1:55:06] in tongues this will be the evidence
[1:55:07] that God is with you and that God is in
[1:55:09] you that's not the evidence of the Holy
[1:55:11] Ghost the evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[1:55:13] your ability to recognize God in your
[1:55:15] day what he's doing right now how he's
[1:55:18] transforming your life and changing you
[1:55:21] right now and making making the Rapture
[1:55:23] a reality in your life hallelujah praise
[1:55:27] God we need to understand so here now
[1:55:29] he's saying in Hebrews 10 he's saying
[1:55:31] sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest
[1:55:33] not but a body hast thou prepared me in
[1:55:37] burnt offerings and sacrifice for sin
[1:55:40] thou H has no pleasure God's not
[1:55:43] interested in your sacrifices and how
[1:55:45] much money you give to the kingdom of
[1:55:47] God or anything else he's looking for a
[1:55:49] body that he can dwell in amen he's
[1:55:52] looking for a vessel that he can possess
[1:55:54] and take control over and not my will be
[1:55:57] done but your will be done Lord that's
[1:56:00] the what he's looking for he says then
[1:56:02] then said I lo I I come in the volume of
[1:56:06] the book it is written of me what listen
[1:56:08] the book The open book it's all him it's
[1:56:13] all his story it's all about his Plan of
[1:56:16] Redemption how he's bringing you back
[1:56:18] into your rightful position as a son or
[1:56:21] a daughter of God
[1:56:23] and this he he's he's making it clear
[1:56:25] now listen pay attention I'm in the book
[1:56:29] and I want you to be in the book with me
[1:56:33] I want you to be back into that rightful
[1:56:36] State like Adam was Spirit man in the
[1:56:39] image and the expression of God
[1:56:42] expressing himself here on Earth because
[1:56:45] God was expressing a new plan new plan
[1:56:49] listen there was other civilizations I
[1:56:51] can tell you that it's proven they've
[1:56:54] shown millions of years that it was all
[1:56:56] there but it's got nothing to do with
[1:56:58] this
[1:56:59] plan it's all you got to go back and you
[1:57:02] got to stop where God started with
[1:57:08] you he says to do thy will oh
[1:57:13] God above when he said sacrifice and
[1:57:16] offerings burnt offerings and offerings
[1:57:18] for sin thou wouldest not neither had
[1:57:21] pleasure therein which are offered by
[1:57:23] the law when you're doing things by the
[1:57:26] law it doesn't please God don't be
[1:57:30] coming and cleaning the house of the
[1:57:32] Lord because you're doing it by law
[1:57:34] because you have to do it do it because
[1:57:37] God has given you a
[1:57:39] revelation of your position in the body
[1:57:41] of Christ and that he will bless you and
[1:57:44] anoint you and prosper you in your
[1:57:47] position in the body and it edifies the
[1:57:50] rest of the body
[1:57:52] amen he says here which are offered by
[1:57:56] the law then said he lo I come to do thy
[1:58:00] will oh God he taketh away the
[1:58:03] first the first
[1:58:05] Covenant the first Covenant that that
[1:58:08] that had to be taken away the the law
[1:58:10] covenant could not work anymore it's not
[1:58:13] going to be by the blood of bulls and
[1:58:15] goats it's not going to be by the by by
[1:58:18] the shed blood of lambs it's going to be
[1:58:20] by the blood of Christ he's the only one
[1:58:23] that can restore you back into your
[1:58:25] rightful position that's where the new
[1:58:28] birth takes place takes you out of your
[1:58:30] carnal nature being born by sex now
[1:58:34] being born again by the spirit word of
[1:58:37] God placing you into your rightful
[1:58:40] position and he taketh away and I come
[1:58:42] to do thy will oh God he taketh away the
[1:58:44] first that he may establish the second
[1:58:47] by the which we are Sanctified through
[1:58:51] the offering of the the body of Jesus
[1:58:53] Christ once and for all
[1:58:57] finished we have no more to do with
[1:59:00] anything that's why I was explaining to
[1:59:03] my daughter I said Christina I said the
[1:59:07] one element that must never be left
[1:59:11] out in this whole plan because they're
[1:59:15] tapping into Source they're tapping into
[1:59:17] the universe they're tapping into the
[1:59:19] laws of God and and how how they they're
[1:59:22] Souls have have uh come into this
[1:59:24] Dimension and how there's other
[1:59:25] dimensions and that you know they're
[1:59:27] going to come into full Consciousness
[1:59:29] and everything else but I said do not
[1:59:31] leave out this
[1:59:33] key it is the absolute key that cannot
[1:59:37] be removed it is God's Plan of
[1:59:40] Redemption through Jesus Christ your
[1:59:43] birth certificate Bears record that you
[1:59:45] were born
[1:59:47] 1988 years after Jesus
[1:59:50] Christ this world has a testimony he's
[1:59:53] the only one that died and rose from the
[1:59:57] dead that could give his own life and
[2:00:00] come back and and and have a purpose in
[2:00:03] all of that and if you take out that one
[2:00:06] element I don't care how close you are
[2:00:10] how much you believe in in the universal
[2:00:12] laws you could even meet an individual
[2:00:15] that has the ability to do miracles
[2:00:18] signs and wonders Jesus said there'll be
[2:00:20] false christs false Christ are false
[2:00:23] anointed ones that can do Miracles they
[2:00:25] can do things that that other people
[2:00:26] can't do and you would think oh boy but
[2:00:29] if they're not going back to the word of
[2:00:32] God and they're not making Jesus Christ
[2:00:33] the absolute the word and we need to put
[2:00:38] Jesus Christ into its proper perspective
[2:00:41] otherwise we miss the whole thing he
[2:00:44] says no man comes to me comes back to
[2:00:47] the father because the father was was
[2:00:50] the original Adam back in the very
[2:00:52] beginning that was expressed in the
[2:00:54] image of God the spirit man and called
[2:00:56] their name Adam Adam and
[2:00:59] Eve it has to go back to that you can't
[2:01:02] go back to the father but by Jesus
[2:01:05] Christ and that's why he
[2:01:08] himself is the one that came in 1963 and
[2:01:12] stood upon the land and upon the sea and
[2:01:15] said time shall be no more that was
[2:01:18] Jesus Christ coming to open the seals
[2:01:22] and unveil the secrets and the Mystery
[2:01:26] behind
[2:01:28] him what his purpose was in coming to
[2:01:31] the Earth what it's always been from
[2:01:34] before the foundations of the world why
[2:01:37] he says you now you got to take the book
[2:01:40] let's move on here and so here
[2:01:42] Revelations 10 go to the next slide I'm
[2:01:45] not going to read the whole thing but I
[2:01:47] want to point out he had in his hand a
[2:01:50] little book and now it was open
[2:01:52] so now we know who opened the book it
[2:01:54] was the lamb and we know that the lamb
[2:01:57] was Jesus Christ and we know that Jesus
[2:01:59] Christ was God himself changing his his
[2:02:03] position come from father coming to to
[2:02:07] the son through Jesus Christ and now
[2:02:09] coming in the form of the Holy Ghost in
[2:02:12] the mighty Angel himself coming in these
[2:02:14] last
[2:02:15] days to
[2:02:17] indwell and possess the Sons and
[2:02:20] Daughters of God
[2:02:22] and with him came a cloud and that cloud
[2:02:26] within that cloud there was I believe
[2:02:28] there was there was a cloud of
[2:02:30] witnesses I believe within that cloud
[2:02:32] there could have been some theophany
[2:02:34] bodies that were coming to the Earth
[2:02:36] come on Saints there's there's a lot
[2:02:38] more that's going on here than what
[2:02:40] meets the eye God was coming to to
[2:02:43] redeem his own God was coming to call
[2:02:45] his own the head was coming to meet with
[2:02:48] the body but the bodies the ones that
[2:02:50] were caught into the the spiritual
[2:02:52] Amnesia that were caught into religion
[2:02:55] caught into Christian religion maybe
[2:02:57] under the Catholic Church the Baptist
[2:02:59] the Presbyterian all these different
[2:03:01] doctrines of man but in there were Sons
[2:03:04] and Daughters of God that would hearken
[2:03:06] and respond to the word and he comes now
[2:03:09] and he opens he was the only one that
[2:03:11] could open the seals and within there
[2:03:14] then then I want you to notice the
[2:03:16] mystery of God should be finished and we
[2:03:19] just talked about it how the mystery of
[2:03:20] God was the godhead
[2:03:22] it was God always it was always God MDC
[2:03:26] was God in a theophany body he was the
[2:03:29] one that had no mother no father he was
[2:03:32] the one that that had no beginning and
[2:03:34] no end who could have who could that
[2:03:35] possibly be it was God coming down to
[2:03:38] make a promise and to meet with Abraham
[2:03:41] and to tell him about the promise that
[2:03:42] we are now fulfilling in this
[2:03:45] day hallelujah praise God and so I want
[2:03:49] you to notice here it just continues to
[2:03:52] progress it moves on the head comes to
[2:03:54] meet with the body anything or listen
[2:03:58] you you you you've got to have been
[2:04:00] there with him in order for you to
[2:04:03] respond to this word that's now being
[2:04:06] released into the hearts of the people
[2:04:08] amen and he said time shall be no more
[2:04:11] glory to God he came with an open book
[2:04:14] he came with the book in his hand and I
[2:04:17] want you to notice I want you to notice
[2:04:19] here go to the next scripture he moves
[2:04:21] on here we're winding this down he goes
[2:04:23] on and he says now he says to the to the
[2:04:26] uh the angel says to to to the voice
[2:04:29] says he says which I heard John now John
[2:04:32] being a type of the Bride he's hearing
[2:04:34] now and and he sees unto him and that
[2:04:36] voice spoke to him and said go and take
[2:04:40] the little book which is open in the
[2:04:43] hand of the Angel which standeth upon
[2:04:45] the sea and upon the
[2:04:47] earth now why is he now telling
[2:04:52] the
[2:04:53] bride to go and take the
[2:04:58] book because remember
[2:05:01] Adam in the original creation of
[2:05:05] God was Adam and Eve the spirit man the
[2:05:11] revelation of God himself on Earth
[2:05:14] having full Dominion full Authority
[2:05:17] sitting on the throne with absolute
[2:05:20] Authority and he says go and take that
[2:05:23] book which is open in the hand of the
[2:05:25] Angel which standeth upon the sea and
[2:05:26] upon the Earth and I went unto the angel
[2:05:29] and I said unto him give me the
[2:05:32] book oh my good you better have
[2:05:35] confidence in knowing what it is that
[2:05:38] God is is placing into your hands you
[2:05:41] need to recognize the hour that we're
[2:05:42] living in where you can actually have
[2:05:44] the confidence and the knowledge and the
[2:05:47] ability by faith to go and take the book
[2:05:50] out of the right hand
[2:05:52] take the book out of God's own hands why
[2:05:55] because you were Eve you were the one
[2:05:57] that was with him before the foundations
[2:06:00] of this world he can't fulfill his word
[2:06:03] without you he can't finish this job
[2:06:06] without you he can't take us to the
[2:06:08] white Throne judgment without you you've
[2:06:12] got to be a part you've got to sit what
[2:06:14] did it say in leoan in in Revelations
[2:06:16] chapter 3 he says to him that overcometh
[2:06:19] in this last age will I grant to sit
[2:06:22] with me where in my Throne Hallelujah
[2:06:27] and what is it to sit in a throne it's a
[2:06:29] supreme authority and there isn't two in
[2:06:32] the throne amen no sir we're not looking
[2:06:35] for two people to sit in the throne
[2:06:37] we're not looking for some kind of
[2:06:39] divided understanding on the word of God
[2:06:41] no God is his own interpreter God is
[2:06:44] going to make it plain God is going to
[2:06:46] have a people on this Earth that's going
[2:06:47] to recognize why they're why they're you

[2:13:37] embassadors he's going to need some

[2:13:42] Daughters of God that will be with the
[2:13:44] right character so that she can rule
[2:13:47] with him from the throne and then after
[2:13:50] the thousand years what happens the
[2:13:53] white Throne
[2:13:55] judgment and that's when everybody's
[2:13:57] going to be risen up and they're going
[2:14:00] to have to be judged according to the
[2:14:02] works of their flesh Hallelujah let
[2:14:06] there be she came for it the real Church
[2:14:08] of God is watching for the coming of
[2:14:12] that glad Millennial day amen glory to
[2:14:16] God let us let's stand
[2:14:21] thank you Lord
[2:14:26] amen in 2 Corinthians 31:5 it says Do We
[2:14:29] Begin Again to commend ourselves or need
[2:14:32] we as some others
[2:14:34] Epistles of commendation to you or
[2:14:39] letters of commendation from you ye are
[2:14:43] our Epistles written in our hearts known
[2:14:46] and read of all men for as much as ye
[2:14:49] are manifestly declared to be the
[2:14:52] Epistles of Christ ministered by US
[2:14:54] Written not with ink but with the spirit
[2:14:57] of the Living God not in tables of stone
[2:15:00] but in fleshly tables of the
[2:15:03] heart that's who we are written
[2:15:06] Epistles true written Epistles of God
[2:15:09] for this day and this hour believes the
[2:15:12] word Waits on the word Waits on him to
[2:15:14] confirm his word doesn't go unpatient
[2:15:17] ahead and try to put her own
[2:15:19] interpretation on the word this is not
[2:15:21] the hour for us to put our own
[2:15:23] interpretation on God's word we will let
[2:15:25] him interpret his own word and such
[2:15:27] trust have we through Christ to God
[2:15:30] toward not that we are sufficient of
[2:15:32] ourselves to think anything of
[2:15:35] ourselves but our
[2:15:37] sufficiency is of
[2:15:42] [Music]
[2:15:44] god take the book
[2:15:49] Saints and do everything that you
[2:15:54] can to allow the spirit of God to yield
[2:15:58] you to his Spirit humble yourself this
[2:16:02] is a time where
[2:16:04] humility is going to pay off
[2:16:07] [Music]
[2:16:09] big big this is where man is going to
[2:16:12] need to be able to just step back not
[2:16:16] going to argue I'm not going to argue
[2:16:18] and say oh you only got to listen to the
[2:16:20] table Apes you go ahead listen to the
[2:16:26] tapes there's nothing wrong with I
[2:16:28] listen to them every day every single
[2:16:31] day I I just
[2:16:34] quoted 10 quotes 12 quotes here from the
[2:16:37] prophet I'm not going to go outside of
[2:16:39] the
[2:16:40] Prophet remember it's it was the word
[2:16:43] and God sends a prophet and then the
[2:16:46] bride will manifest by the Holy Spirit
[2:16:48] exactly what the prophet was saying back
[2:16:50] to the word she will not go and and and
[2:16:54] say anything contrary to what the
[2:16:56] prophet
[2:16:58] said but she knows that the word is
[2:17:02] moving on she knows that there's a
[2:17:05] progression to this word into this
[2:17:07] Revelation and to her position she's not
[2:17:11] just called
[2:17:13] bride she is bride she is Christ in the
[2:17:19] female
[2:17:21] aspect she is the fullness of the word
[2:17:24] now being expressed in these last days
[2:17:28] she recognize she knows what to do with
[2:17:31] the word of God she's not unconfident
[2:17:34] she's not oh I wonder if I can do this
[2:17:37] She lays hands upon the sick and the
[2:17:39] Bible says they shall recover that's not
[2:17:42] up to her to say when it's going to
[2:17:44] happen she believes the word she knows
[2:17:48] the word lives in her when we we pray
[2:17:51] for our food we bless the food we can we
[2:17:53] can say Lord I bless my children I bless
[2:17:57] this brother I bless that's why when
[2:17:59] don't ever hold back from saying God
[2:18:02] bless you brother there's nothing better
[2:18:05] than you could ever say to somebody and
[2:18:07] somebody with a revelation of that when
[2:18:10] somebody says it to them they receive it
[2:18:13] amen as the love of God pouring out of
[2:18:16] that individual's heart amen because
[2:18:19] when we say God bless you it's real it's
[2:18:23] a
[2:18:24] reality you can never say it too much oh
[2:18:28] you're too religious I don't care I want
[2:18:31] to bless as much as I can bless because
[2:18:33] God says you bless and I'll bless you
[2:18:37] glory to God Amen you bless others and
[2:18:40] God he just going to just test me he
[2:18:42] says test me with your tithes your
[2:18:44] offerings test me with your giving test
[2:18:47] me with your giving and see if God does
[2:18:51] I'm not telling you to give to this
[2:18:52] church I'm telling you to give by
[2:18:55] Revelation to the kingdom of God where
[2:18:57] God has placed you where God will bless
[2:19:00] you where God will prosper
[2:19:02] you try him and see if he doesn't pour
