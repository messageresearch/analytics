========================================
so I love preaching to the to this church amen amen and I'm not kidding I'm not just saying it I love preaching to this church and bringing the word of God to because I know you understand me amen amen praise the Lord you know that's a song I sang to my wife before I got married I love you because you understand me I love you for the many things you always do oh I love you for many many reasons I love you just because you [Music] [Applause] are I don't was singing One her but somehow she made a decision glory to God so I just thank God for her she's not feeling well today so I excuse her but she'll be out she's not a bed but she's not feeling she's feeling other sours so um I I give her a day off I take the responsibility praise the Lord hallelujah may the Lord richly bless every one of you here today in the house of the Lord I came and I heard the singing the tone picking up the the spirit of God already waiting in the congregation and uh hearing brother Danny the singing the remarks from brother Mike uh it just takes me uh back and it takes me forward cu the spirit of Christ is in the air Spirit of Revival is in the air Hallelujah power and the presence of God is in the very atmosphere and we want to thank God for his presence amen because without him we can do nothing we can have all the all the you know Pro progams we can have all the music we can have all the quotes and all the scriptures and everything to be right but without the power the presence of almighty God we don't have anything Prophet said you're just a nice wonderful religious group amen operating on the what the good amen the what what were the three Wills of God there just try to remember the good will of God perfect will of God per permissive permissive will of God right in other words God allow it God allow it doing the service without doing his will and even though we can sing We shout we can praise him but if that missing ingredient in the cake is there the top of the cake is going to fall is that right praise the Lord hallelujah it's not going to be worth anything so why one thing when before we even come here you pray that the spirit of God will be in this building waiting us before we get here amen is that right amen the spirit of the Living God is here because Jesus keeps all of his appointment amen amen you know I'm using that to from where brother Bron said do you know that if the Holy Spirit notices that you pray at a certain place every day at a certain time he said he'll be there every time before you get there waiting on him amen is that right praise the Lord you can look it up somewhere but the fact is it's the same thing with us coming to church he knows that you're going to be faithful you're coming you're going to be in the house of God and you come seriously soberly and sincerely to worship Him and lift up his name the spirit of God is going to fill this building before we even got this is not you're singing going to bring him down but he's going to be already in him amen and then he'll dance on the Rock while you're singing that's the angel will dance on the Rock the word praise the Lord while you're praising him because he knows you're praising him with understanding said if you sing sing with your understanding sing with Revelation praise the Lord whatever you do sing with the Revelation do it with the Revelation serve god with the Revelation praise the Lord Jesus hallelujah amen let's go back to our original textt and I'll try to finish the service we had over there in petroleum and that will be 2 Corinthians 46 Hallelujah 2 Corinthians 4 verse 6 shall We Stand now let's read together with one voice for God who commanded the light to shine in the darkness has shine in our hearts to give the life of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ father we ask your blessing on the word in Jesus name amen please be seated the same God um let me go back to it is the rising of the sun we brother gr said just as much as the Earth was covered with Darkness without form and without void he's actually describing the state of our souls of how it was covered with fa and darkness of denominational teachings Concepts ideas uh you were just fed over and your soul was just locked out but then God commanded the light to shine out of the darkness and the prophet said the darkness had to flee away so this is what Paul is actually referring to here when he's saying for God who commanded the light shined with f of Darkness had shined into our hearts amen not just let the sun come up in the natural world but it's the same God that allowed the S so to rise in your heart and shine his light or his Revelation in your heart to bring us out of the darkness that we were in and that is the light that we're walking in that's the light the prophet talks about or sings about when he sings they'll walk in the light such a beautiful light walk where the duw drops of mercies are bright shine all around us by day and by night it is Jesus he's the light of the world Amen we walk in the light such a beautiful light we're saying we'll walk in the Revelation the faith once delivered unto us as the saints of God and you can't just come like that God has to decide to shine his light into your hearts amen praise the Lord and then you receive the light of the knowledge or the understanding of the knowledge of God that's revealed in the face or the word revealed in the face of Jesus Christ Christ which is the word the word is just his face he hides behind him in his word so we're happy for that praise the Lord our last talk when we were just talking with you we talked about uh brother brand saying sometime in the evening my wife and I we just go into the room and there the kids are sleeping and while they're sleeping we look at them and he says she I look at her and says to her uh M do you know he's got your big eyes just like yours amen and she'll say uh and he's got your lips his lips are just like yours sees the features of both of us represented in that child Hallelujah of God wants to see the reflection of himself in his church his church reflecting the power and glory to the world Amen praise the Lord God wants to see or identify his characteristics in your life he wants to identify the Bible says by faith Abel offered a better sacrifice God testifying of his gifts in other words it wasn't Abel or you or I that has to go out and say I'm a Christian I'm a Christian I'm a Believer I really believe this message but the Bible tells us when you caught the genuine revelation God will testify of your gifts God will testify of who you are and what is in you praise the Lord for he is identified by his own characteristics glory to God hallelujah we furthermore talked about uh that boy that saw himself in the mirror and and when he saw himself in the mirror he said Mama that's me that's me praise the lord well don't you understand when God looks down adoption time and he sees his children coming into spiritual maturity coming to the place where they start to act look and talk like him he looks back and say wait a minute that's me that's just how I would have done it that's just what I would have said if I was still on Earth that's how I going to reacted that's they're exactly right hallelujah praise the lord they're doing just like I wanted Oh Glory to God that's the kind of children that God is looking for amen the man in the mirror is Christ and he sees himself in US amen when we clean up the smoke from off of the mirror then he can see clearly who he is in us and we can see who we are in him and be able to say now by Revelation I can say I and my father are one amen glory to God I and my father are one just like the river is one with the ocean the ocean flows into the river and the river flows back in the ocean H you just call one a river but it's the same thing flowing back and forth glory to God and that's our relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah amen Oh Glory to God aren't you happy that you're one of them aren't you happy that you can say here one again this morning glory to God hallelujah amen look he said talking about this in the old beakers of gold amen when you get the gold that's full of that gold when you get it at first it's full of a lot of fools gold amen and when we come in at the time we were coming in we were our hearts were filled with a lot of foolishness amen a lot of foolishness a lot of worldliness a lot of religious foolishness we f with all kind of foolish ideas foolish thoughts foolish actions but it says here they come in when you get that go it's full of pite or Fool's go and and that fool gos really seems to shine better than the real go oh my when you come in at first my good Fools Rush In Where Angels Fear To Tread oh I know the message oh I got my Lord hallelujah I got a Ministry you know I believe I believe God give me a gift of this and a gift of that and everything else and when you really CAU it now you find people start to back away they don't want to be known for nothing they just only want to be known for serving God and then if anything is supposed to come out of them it'll come out do its job and go right back amen and they just continue on being a simple believer walking the light of the age praise the Lord see it shines better than even the real gold but it's that sludge and everything in it but the beaters of the gold must beat that go Hallelujah until he get all the dirt out of it then he can see the reflection of himself like a polished miror he must beat it he must beat it and beat it until he sees his own reflection amen praise the Lord hallelujah my brother Simon here you go again you want to beat up on us well God is telling you it's not just me trying to beat up on you but it say love makes him take the word and beat up on you so that you can uh crystalize your faith amen so that you can clarify your reflection so that you can recognize that you come in this world not by chance but you come here hardwired to was God you can't help it you got to worship God you've been programed to worship God you everything else to God you went into all that foolishness let me call it the way I see it Monkey Business you got into all this monkey business and you know monkeys get carried away with the Shin something run after that a shiny they run after that shiny something run after that you know C you put on a jacket and Jack don't put on his jacket and so and that's the way it go and we Chase off all this monkey business and shiny stuff like that until we wake up and recognize that we were wired to worship God called you because what he was alone and he wanted Fellowship so you are for for Fellowship you got a purpose why you're here on this Earth the purpose is to worship God tell him you love him tell him you want to Ser tell him to give him your heart tell him you want to fellowship with him praise God the want to have a pray life glory to God when I say pray life I don't mean that you just pray here to uh you know in the morning early before you go to work and then you pray at night before you go home and you call out a prayer life no a prayer life is a life of prayer it means consistently and incessant as you live and walk you are praying every moment of the day as long as your mindi something you are praying I'm praying I don't mean praying oh God no a brother comes to thought oh God bless him God understand you don't have to pray a long prayer God move amen one of those prayer requests come in and and tell you brother sister so and so it doesn't mean you got to go on there for two hours you to convince God to heal no you just oh God have mercy When Love projects Grace takes over Hallelujah if you're really sincere when love projects Grace takes over it's not you going to do it anywhere not by let works and working yourself up but by resting in his grace and his promise that he said if you do this I will do this and God doesn't fail God doesn't lie God keeps his promise he keeps his word praise God hallelujah we were formed for his Fellowship amen oh my just to walk with the King that you were made and shaped to walk with the gate shaped for service Amen to serve God set here to be a to do service for him glory to God hallelujah oh glory to God I said we got a word to make know we got a message we got to make it know amen oh blessed be the name of the Lord a word to make back know we got a name to declare and that name is Jesus got a name to declare brother sister we got a a word to make known to the people praise God and we got a mission and our mission is what to manifest the word of the spirit of Jesus Christ in this last age amen you were sent on of Jess to be a ministering spirit that you may manifest the spirit of Christ to the age that the people may recognize him in our day Hallelujah and Jesus that of Nazareth but God in you there he Christ in you amen maybe not all of him like the great Diamond but they'll see facets of him they'll see little glimpses of him a little something come out of your life and they see Jesus and recognize that that couldn't be you but him amen praise the Lord you see what it is when the Holy Spirit is trying to do that to the church trying to beat it and turn it over and speak it again until that church Christ reflects in that church to the people and by that proving his resurrection that he's alive forever more do you believe that hallelujah oh he wants the world to know he's not dead but he's alive and he lives in me and he lives in the king of all Heaven and Earth lives in US glory to God and he wants all world to GL he's trying to get his people get the people to beat the world out of themselves Hallelujah let's check ourselves and see where we stand and how we can clean up the worldliness that is in our lives we hardly recognize something how it sometimes how it creeps upon on us because we are in the world and we can't help it the thing creeps upon us but ever so often we have to give ourselves a selfcheck amen amen let's do a self-examination amen amen there's nobody better to examine you but yourself and God is that right you let a man or a woman examine themselves and let them see if they be in the F glory to God hallelujah but most of the Modern Man Church wastes time examining one another examining other people instead of examining our ownselves Paul said you better take heed amen that you stand that you're standing forless you fall amen don't rejoice in anybody else's mistakes everybody else is failure we saying the West is today for you tomorrow for me m is that right am that right got the British have a statement every dog has his day my so don't Rejoice too much that's why the Bible say genuine love rejoice it not in iniquity don't Rejoice on something bad happen to somebody else oh no rejoice in the truth Rejoice that the word can be revealed to the people that's what we got to Rejoice glory to God and love that's what doesn't it doesn't deliberately go out there to expose people and shame and embar people but love covers the multitude I didn't say love compromise no but I said love covers and when I say love covers love covers in the sense that it gives you an opportunity to change your way is that right it's not going to cover up if you're living in adultery just cover it up like that but it will go and but Jesus said and talk to your brother directly before you go make it broadcast talk to him directly or directly so they can correct the thing then if they don't correct it bring a witness with you and if they still want live with this now you got the right to tell the whole church tell the whole church let the whole church know about it but not the moment you hear something you got into this hybrid religion spirit I hear this and I hear that with a big too long here hearing that did you hear you know you know my God sometimes it it sickens you that you meet Brethren and the first thing they going to say praise the Lord Brother God bless you by the way did you hear what happened with brother did you hear what happened with sister this well no I didn't hear and I don't really want to hear unless God wants me to hear understand I don't want my mind contaminated so that I have sped views about anybody I want my mind clean and clear so that when the Holy Spirit wants to show me something it's there not tampered with or colored with or or or touch with any kind of prejudice prejudicial ideas or thoughts but clean amen praise the name of the Lord a clean mind and a clean heart to do the service of God and so that you can have confidence when I say something because if I say something and you know it's by some trick or some some news or some color how you going to have confidence in that kind of a Ministry or that kind of a voice you have to have conf that's when the the Holy Ghost the amen and challenge you that is a sa it's it's the sayth the Lord blessed be the name of the Living God hallelujah see DAV it is he's trying to get the people to beat the worldliness out of them you see the devil is trying to pour it in you bet the devil is trying to pour it in on you he tried to pour in everything he can upon you praise the Lord amen and that's what he's doing Brothers uh excuse me brother in the back come inside close the doors and let the air conditioning build up in here when we leave these doors open it goes down the stairs and then it feels like we don't have any air conditioning in there but we do so the doors need to be closed GL to God these one brother sorry for the pause but that's okay amen do it like that always right not just you I'm talking to they they all know I'm talking to them praise the Lord hallelujah so here we are he the Holy Spirit if you will just stand still long enough and let him he will beat your life who wants a holy ghost [Music] meing but this is what the prophet of God is saying here you know what he said he said if a parents have a child and they going to reprove them correct them and you spare the rod and spoil the child he say you going to have a foolish child and that child is going to bring shame and embarrassment is that right we'll apply that spiritually if the pastor doesn't apply the word or apply the token when situations AR right how are you going to grow you're not you going live an undisciplined life you going live a life where you're like a wild donkey where nobody can control you or like a mule that digging your heels and you won't change and then nothing will happen see but the fact is you the prophet of God is saying the Holy Spirit if you you will just stand still and let him do it he will beat your life until the loving peace of Christ begins to reflect in your life amen praise the Lord somebody say say Amen again to God because when I say Amen some people W say Amen because some of us stuborn and sometimes we deserve and we still think we we shouldn't be amen is that right my God we so stubborn we so set in our ways sometime a bring it on way accept your ways this is the way I do it but he wants you to do it his way not your way said not my will but thine be done dear Jesus May the same prayer be mine every day amen not my will but thy will be done every day we want God's will to be done in our lives we got to come out of the stubbornness we want the Holy Spirit on on our lives we don't want to have a m Spirit we don't want to have a Jezebel spirit you don't want to have a Judah Spirit we don't want to have a SL Spirit you don't want to have the spirit of a rat always sneaking around or a cat no amen nice in the religion as long as the pastor prays you and stroke you in the right direction he stroke you in the opposite way St my goodness brother said some I'm come to church and you got to say good morning this spider they're not going in the water but they right across the water you know you see you know spiders are so light they can run right across water like God he said Mrs spider God the word don't mean nothing they just hear it but they run right over the top of it or you said Mrs crab right they're crab they always crabby is that right my God the worst thing you can see in the message men and women but it shows up even more in the women when a woman goes around with her face like she's Mrs Grim Grim very de oh you going to be so Grim all the time I believe a Christian to have a smile on their face [Applause] their my God we look there's an age where because of the dangers in society because of the the abuses of society you find out some women and men try to make their face as Fierce as they can because that fierceness of their face they think is a protection for them you better not say not say anything to me oh my God Fierce looking women my Lord God help us my Lord the men should be looking fierce but instead they're becoming em not em Fierce e feminine everything like that I repeat again and I want to forget what the holy spirit said it shall come to that's speaking to me the past the women are going to start developing big bushy Bears and the men's faces are going to become smooth like how the women's faces used to be and you hardly going be able to distinguish much difference there amen but God wants to meet your life I'm ready for a holy ghost meeting I want the foolishness to be beaten out of me I want self beaten out of me I want my own thoughts beaten out of me I want hallelu I want all myor my glory I want to be Chang so that I can be of service to him glory to God I want to serve God I want to serve you and I want my life to be in a state where anytime you can pick me up as a tool and use me for his glory and for his honor glory to God now when the Holy Spirit beats your life chips away we may be different one from another see we are a body but part the great Diamond when it's Chip it's magnificent and God has so arranged his Affairs on the Earth till he would be able to be like this big diamond the light of the diamond reflecting the Rays of light and some of those Rays may be blue and some may be green others may be of other colors see each light will be ar R in a different color may be but whatever color it is it's reflecting from the same great Diamond hallelujah amen glory to God look at us right there red and yellow black and white they are precious in His sight Jesus loves the little children everywhere amen regardless of what color we are reflecting we reflecting from the same Revelation same God same message the same life for the glory of God hallelujah praise the name of the Living God all called out to do that for his glory and honor amen and when you do that you're reflecting where you come from listen what the prophet of God says here he says now we are either influenced from this way or that way you cannot be here a spiritual being whether you be sinner or saint you are either influenced from here from above or from below the other world Amen either from the other world or from above see that's the way it is now your your influence from Heaven because your Celestial body is already waiting you up there amen praise God now if you are Wicked and you are hypocritical and indifferent your Celestial body is down there regardless of how religious you are and what you think that it's up there it's really down there amen because the fruit that you bear before the people proves where you are from amen hallelujah what the life is manifesting is proving your Origins it's proving where you come from and also where you are going you are here what you are somewhere else glory to God see glory to God you realize what he's telling you we are in the negative but your positive is there amen we are really a reflection in time that's why we only time beings the real you that real Celestial body is somewhere else and it's reflecting back here on the earth so that's why another place he says if I put five fingers like this and the light strikes five fingers he says then you're supposed to see five fingers here but if you see some monstrosity or something else change then it's got to be that there's some kind of monster back here reflecting the here that's the way it is so you are the reflection of that Celestial body that you have above or below and here praise the Lord I want you to hear what he says here the fruits you bear before the world proves where you come from and proves what your inheritance is going to be I want to P out of the message called the Seal of the Antichrist he said now uh on the man on this side of him the thief on this side of him preached to him through the cross saying why are you condemning him for he has done nothing wrong but see we are condemned both of us we getting exactly what we need coming to us we deserve it but this man the word has done nothing then he turned and said Lord Lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and Jesus speaking back said today Thou shalt be with me in Paradise here you are he says notice and I'm going take this in Judas Iscariot hanged himself and died on a sycamore tree and shortly after Jesus was hang on a tree it's two trees cut made the cross but he was also hang on the tree he says here Judas the son of prici died on that tree and taking with him that unrepentant sinner Jesus died on the tree and he there he was going back to Heaven taking with him the repentant sinner oh think about it coming down from heaven returning back to Heaven taking with him the believer and Judas the son of predition coming from Hell going back to hell and taking with him the unrepentant sinner you are representing something here down here that you really are somewhere else that is why I always tell you that if you if you are if you your your celestial bodies in heaven praising God giving glory and honor to God then you would want to praise God come here I mean I've been saying that for years you can't stop you can't help it amen because the Deep will call to the deep and the Deep must respond GL to God hallelujah and one day it will all be together again amen he says do you know when you CAU the first revelation you C the Revelation you have just heard or made contact with youry amen amen hallelujah with superal Revelation amen and it begins to reveal to you who you are where you come from what your purpose is what you here on Earth glory to God Hallelujah Lord God forever more he says you are influenced either this way or that way and the fruit you bear before the world Bru to the people where you come from and whatever inheritance is think about it right now you are glorified in the presence of God Romans 828 to 30 Born Again Believers for if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting in glory not just somewhere else but right Yonder waiting right now hallelujah it's there and these Earthly bodies are groing to be covered with that immortality of Romans 8:22 to 23 praise the Lord is that right sickness a pains disappointments haraches all all of it will be gone amen and this old best house will be shut down amen is that right we close down this old pest house we don't have to worry about this anymore because this is in time but the celestial body is eternal is that right so there's no sickness there's no pain there is no aging there is there is no time there praise the Lord so there there's nothing to worry about praise the Lord hallelujah oh praise God I wrote a note on the side here you can live like a religious devil you can't live like a religious devil and still expect to go to heaven is that right religious you know that the devil wash [Music] God do you know that he sign also with all them Angels Wash and he was a leader in doing that and yet there was no place found for him his name was not in the Lamb's Book of Life amen is that right his name wasn't in the Lamb's Book of Life so we know Satan is not going to be saved right let me throw this up so you understand because these Devils bu some really coton arguments some of them argue that Satan will be saved because if you're a true servant of God you will be save and then they go on to say God uses Satan to tempt the Believers God us Satan to tell Li God perit Satan to go and temp J God per him so the devil is actually serving God when he doing the evil so therefore you will be saved right that's that's the argument I'll if anybody who raise that to you it's nonsense right but that's what they say but we know without the shedding of blood there is no remission of and that means he has the command of the blood and he the blood he hates the name of Jesus he doesn't want anything to do with it so there is no salvation in no other but in the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so we are supposed to be the reflection of the real you you and I are to be the reflection of the real you that is somewhere else and you're reflecting them here where you what you are somewhere else glory to God hallelujah God of course knew who you are amen and where you are going he knows your destination when you leave here and that is what you know predestination or he pre where you will be going before you even got here God already pre you glory to God hallelujah glory to his wonderful precious name now taking that thought brother BR continues he says now what you are what your Celestial or your terestrial body is of Y what it is somewhere else is what you are reflecting back here from the spirit L amen you're reflecting something from the spirit land what you are is what you are here what you are there is what you are here if you are still vulgar minded and so for some vulg spirit in the spirit lines then you will be binded here can you say Amen praise the Lord if you have got malice if you have got strife and envy back there in the spirit god with that it will then reflect back down here in you down here see you're in the spirit land with that and reflect back here but if your entire innermost being has become cleansed or being cleansed and first it shows you have got a a body I say a supernatural body out yonder already W in you that's been cleansed and forged by the blood and now it's seeking to react into your flesh is that right do you believe that oh praise God hallelujah somebody would say brother where you getting this stuff from right in the amen he says that what is back in the spirit land is seeking to manifest uh true your flesh here today praise the Lord hallelujah so you are not just sitting here you're also seeking in Heavenly places in Christ Hallelujah not your physical body but your representation is seated in Heavenly places in the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting praise God forever more amen yes sir think about it Moses wasn't him Joshua wasn't him and you are in him now praise the Lord all the other messengers of course were in him before the foundations of the world and we understand that God uh if I had a if I could draw a diagram I'll do that another time and just show you uh I draw God like a big circle let me just describe it and it's right on the bottom line notes here right now I got at bottom my notes Here God like a big circle and in that circle is a whole millions of billions of Dots Dots Dots we were in him before the foundations yes sir amen right but then what happens then God made Adam and Adam and Eve and you know they were in flesh and again we were in him we were in Adam so I drew a little man and around the LA area I took my pen and put a whole lot of gods because we were in him brother said you were in your great great great great grandfather just like Levi was in Abraham and he was paying TI in Abraham that's why Abraham had the desire to pay ties because it was the attribute of God in him reacting through him praise God so we were in him in Adam in Adam because he s we all di amen but we now arew in Christ We Are Made Alive so I drew another little man and put Christ there and draw a little little dots in there so we are in here praise the Lord and then you understand when I'm saying in him in him in him I'm also refering that we were in him as the bride and the rib that was in Adam and we were in Christ again as the bride in there praise the Lord until God decided that he would take us out in this age and make us manifested one with him praise the name of the Lord glory to God so realize this friends he says now we are reflecting the message of this age to the world that is the light of the world what is the light of the world Jesus what's the light of the world the word for the hour is the light for this world today to shine them through the darkness but you see you you are the light of the world but if that is light is hid by some denominational Buell basket covering over you and covering over your mind how are you going to be able to see it by your Traditions you make the light of no effect by your denominational they are trying to keep the light away from the church they won't go in will they let you come in Praise the Lord hallelujah but oh brother sister you remember there was a man by the name of BL martinus he sat beside the highway begging for scraps we were all like that one day we didn't know the truth and we just any scrap we get any little truth we got we Rejoice over a little scrap that somebody thrw at us whether message person or denominational person we just Rejoice because we got another little scrap and and we sat by the highway there uh begging but we could not see whatsoever but Prophet said but remember we were wearing dirty rags dirty rags all the time but those RS serve their purpose covering you as floing but now those RS are just now become Pap no what he's talking about how the the denominational justification of the Luther they use those things they cover themselves and it covered them for a while but now it's just written on the word it's nothing but papay for the age has passed and we're in totally in a different age for justification has served its time now sanctification through Wesley served its time and now comes to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost are served in until now the holy
