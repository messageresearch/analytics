TRANSCRIPT
========================================
You cannot accept Christ because Christ is he is the revelation of God. &gt;&gt; He's God revealed in flesh. &gt;&gt; Therefore, the whole church is built upon divine revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you know like like THAT'S WHY YOU CAN TALK TO people about the word of God and you know you get into fellowship around the word and you know they they they hold to their trinitarian doctrine and you tell them but you know I believe that if if you you know you know and I've said it many times I believe if if you're sincere in your heart and you know because I see that you're sincere but you're holding on to a trinitarian doctrine of making God three in one. But if you would submit yourself to the Holy Ghost and recognize what is the Holy Ghost, IT'S GOD HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; WHEN JESUS SAID, "I will send you the comforter." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; and he will come in you and guide you into all truth. AND SO THE HOLY GHOST is the spirit of revelation. &gt;&gt; And when revelation comes, it can never deny the word of God. &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that. &gt;&gt; And that's why, you know, William Brandham says to, you know, to the to the Baptist, he says, well, you could never accept the Bible then because the Bible is the revelation OF CHRIST. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THEY'LL look at the book of Revelation. Yes. &gt;&gt; The last book in the Bible is THE WHOLE BOOK THAT sums up the complete revelation of God. &gt;&gt; And John was given that so that it could be expressed in word form to tell us what the word was going to produce in every age. Showing us through the seven church ages and the building up of the body. &gt;&gt; And here we are today. in that final age. Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah. He came to his own and his own could not receive him. You can look at the next slide. They didn't receive him as a baby. They couldn't receive him as an adult. And many today are saying, "Give me gifts and parties." But unfortunately saying, "Sorry, I got no room for Jesus in my heart." you're a little bit too zealous about Jesus. They'll tell you, you know, but Isaiah 53 said very clearly, he was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, and he was acquainted with grief. Imagine that. He walked throughout this whole 33 years of his life. But yet when he came into his public ministry, &gt;&gt; they rejected him. &gt;&gt; They loved him when he when when he would feed them. &gt;&gt; They loved him when they would when he would heal them. But when he spoke the word, &gt;&gt; he said, "Unless you eat my body and drink my blood, &gt;&gt; you have no part of me." &gt;&gt; You see, he wasn't talking, he wasn't cannibalistic. He wasn't talking about that. He made it very clear. I am the bread that cometh down from heaven. &gt;&gt; He was trying to let the people know that, hey, I'm the word. &gt;&gt; I'm the word for your day. &gt;&gt; That's your message. Did you know that? YOU CAN TELL THE PEOPLE, "HEY, I'm the word for this day. &gt;&gt; I'm the word that's being expressed in IN 2025 THAT WANTS YOU TO know what the true meaning of Christmas is all about." &gt;&gt; They couldn't receive him. He was in Nazareth. They and and and they and they rejected him. He came to his own. The very world he had created, the very ones who had received the breath of life that he had given into their nostrils rejected him. And one of the greatest battles at Christmas for people is to make room for Jesus, the word. The true meaning of Christmas. Glory to God. in John, you know, he was in the world. The world loves its own. You want to talk about, you know, the regular Jesus? You want to talk about the one that believes in Santa and that you know that wants to have the Santa Claus plays at church and wants to, you know, uh, you know, commercialize it and, you know, if you talk to Jesus in that way and all the great big parties and all the booze, you know, hey, make sure you Bob Yob, you know, bring your own booze. We're having a big Christmas party, right? Long as you're as long as you're in that category. Oh, they love you. Oh, come to our party, you know, come to our party. But the minute that you want to bring the word &gt;&gt; into their midst, the reality of of of what holiness is all about, &gt;&gt; it's not putting on holiness. But when you've received the Holy Ghost in your life, you can't act that way anymore &gt;&gt; because it's the power of God in you. Remember the Holy Ghost is God's purpose in your life &gt;&gt; to fulfill his word, &gt;&gt; his purpose. That's why when when you receive the Holy Ghost, it's it's a new birth. And and every birth is a mess. &gt;&gt; Your families are not going to Wait a minute. We used to put, you know, all kinds of Christmas ornaments up everywhere and and and you were, you know, you were right there, right there with your bottle of whiskey at every Christmas. and you know you were there partying with us at every Christmas. What's going on here? No, Christmas has become different because you've received the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It brings a whole new life, a whole new purpose, it changes Christmas. I told you this kind of preaching when you understand what Christmas is truly all about, which is the worship of Christ. And you can only worship Christ if you come subject to Christ. And he is the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's all it always comes back to the word. &gt;&gt; In John 15, you can go to slide 11 there. It says, "If ye were of the world, the world would love his own." That's how you know you're not of this world. &gt;&gt; Because you're not loved by everybody. Be glad that you're loved by him. Be glad that you have a family that that that that knows him. That's that's a part of his family &gt;&gt; that loves you according to genuine love. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not artificial love. Oh, hi. God bless you. Oh, hi. How are you? And meanwhile, in the back of your mind, you got different thoughts. The birth hasn't happened yet. If that's still going on, you're still you're still struggling with this. You could be birthed and actually still be struggling with those things. I correct myself. You can actually be born again and be struggling with with your brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; It's just that you haven't died enough. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says here, "But because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you." &gt;&gt; He chose you. You never chose him. &gt;&gt; People come and say, "What are you doing? You know, giving yourself to this church and giving yourself to the to this cult or, you know, where you where you know, you you're you're you don't come to our events anymore. You're always going to their church services. I don't see you anymore at the New Year's Eve parties, man. Last year we got so drunk. We missed you. &gt;&gt; You can tell THEM I GOT DRUNK TOO &gt;&gt; in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Remember the word that I said unto you, the servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. You see what that's saying? That when when true unity takes place in the Holy Ghost, they'll believe you because they believe the word. They've come subject to the word of God. And when they become subject to the word, all of a sudden, they become subject to you &gt;&gt; because you're a part of the word. &gt;&gt; You're a part of the body. That's what Jesus was talking about here. The servant is not greater than his Lord. We can't be any better than the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. But the moment we submit to the Lord and others submit to the Lord, it brings the unity of the body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It brings you into the true meaning of Christmas. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It gives you the ability to become glory to God. All of a sudden, those few recognized him while they were while Jesus was here and being rejected by the majority. But there was a few that recognized him. He come to Peter. He says, "Peter, who do you say that I am? Thou art the Christ." He recognized. He was the word for for that day. Amen. the son of the living God. He came subject to God. He recognized that God was made flesh. There was just a handful that recognize. Imagine. So don't be thinking that the whole world is going to agree with you when you bring this type of teaching on the word of God on the true meaning of Christmas. only a handful. Yet to all who did receive him, go to the next slide, he gave power to become the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Now, this is where this is where, you know, we get the juice, the meat. Amen. There were a few, not many at first, who risked the insults, the ridicule, being called dreamers, and oh, you're too, you know, you're too religious, you know, you're just you're you're you're too uh you know, uh you're almost like overzealous about Jesus. But the ones that recognized, they did not fear any of that. They were willing to take on the uh and become like radicals because they wanted desperately to understand who they were. &gt;&gt; They were coming into a place where things started to make sense in their lives. &gt;&gt; They started to realize that they didn't have to be, you know, uh under under the conditions that they were under. They had been set free by the word for their day &gt;&gt; because Jesus was the word for their day. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Listen, let's read our scripture here in Colossians 1:26-27. He says, "Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints." Who are his saints? his children, his sons and daughters. Amen. To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is what? Christ coming in you &gt;&gt; and all of a sudden now it's the hope of your Christmas. &gt;&gt; It changes Christmas alto together. Amen. &gt;&gt; It places an understanding in your heart that you you know all of a sudden when you hear Jesus and he says that day ye shall know that I am in the father ye in me and I in you. All of a sudden IT JUST STARTS ALL COMING TOGETHER. THE family of God coming back together again because that was his goal from the very beginning. God wanted to become man on earth with his sons and daughters so that he could have a family &gt;&gt; in fellowship and in perfect harmony. &gt;&gt; And that's still his plan. &gt;&gt; That's the meaning of Christmas. That's the purpose why he came. So that he could go back and and and get that portion of eternity that we are so that he could bring it back and give it to you. IT'S CALLED THE POWER TO BECOME. It's called the Holy Ghost in you. Your hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. It's a super sign. Let's read the quote here. Oh God, if the world could only see that that God and man are one. &gt;&gt; The super sign was that first man that God could come into. All that God was, he poured into Christ. &gt;&gt; And all Christ he he poured into the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's you. The body. Amen. All Christ he poured into the church. Super sign. He says, "Oh, listen. This is this is the sign of this Christmas." Amen. [laughter] You're you're a super sign. He says, "Listen," he says, "God and man together," that was to be the super sign of the last day when the entire Bible was to be fulfilled in the last day. This is when the whole word comes together. And those that are a part of the word, they're going to see it as clear as a bell. But to them that are lost, it'll they'll just go on with Christmas. They just go on with all their traditions. They'll they'll make no room for Jesus at the table. Amen. But no, he says he says uh that that it'll be fulfilled in the last days, a super sign. And what was a he says a virgin shall conceive and this conception when it's brought forth will be God manifested in flesh. THAT WAS A SUPER SIGN of that day. The Virgin Mary was a super sign of that day because she HAD BEEN GIVEN THE POWER TO BECOME AND TO BRING FORTH the word in her day. &gt;&gt; A SUPER SIGN. THEY STILL don't believe it, but it was anyhow. It's still a super sign. There's a people on earth that have received the angel of the Lord through the opening of the word. They've received their prophet. Amen. That's restored the word back to them. And what have they said? Be it unto me like the Virgin Mary. Be it unto me according to thy word. Amen. Go to the next slide. He says, "Notice super sign. They've got Superman today. They've got fictitious fictions of Superman. All these other kinds of super things. But the church has got a super sign. God back in the church. &gt;&gt; Manifested in human flesh. &gt;&gt; God united with man. His sure super sign. Notice the eternal sign. An unfailing sign. It will never fail. Why? It's the word and man become one. &gt;&gt; That's the meaning of Christmas. &gt;&gt; Christ wants Listen, THE CHRIST OF 2,000 years ago when he was born as a baby in a manger, that's not our message. &gt;&gt; That's not the the the the super sign in our day. Amen. &gt;&gt; That was Christ coming to the earth to the people of that day to fulfill his word according to Isaiah that a virgin shall conceive. Unto us a son is given. His name shall be the counselor, the prince of peace, the mighty God. It's all right there in that one scripture. &gt;&gt; God is one. &gt;&gt; He was the son. He was the comforter. He was the counselor. The everlasting father, &gt;&gt; THE PRINCE OF PEACE, &gt;&gt; THE MIGHTY GOD. &gt;&gt; Only one. &gt;&gt; THERE'S ONLY ONE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Do you see? You see now? Now, do you understand Christmas a little better? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; This is what Christmas is really all about. &gt;&gt; Understanding that, let's read on. He says here, "When God's word and man become one, as St. John the first chapter says in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. That's the super sign &gt;&gt; that the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, if that was the super sign of that day &gt;&gt; when the same spirit that was on JESUS CHRIST COMES INTO his church &gt;&gt; to manifest the written word for today. That is still the super sign. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. That's the word that we're preaching here this morning. &gt;&gt; THIS IS CHRISTMAS. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE POWER TO BECOME. &gt;&gt; This is the element of the word that THAT THAT THAT THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING in our lives. It delivered you from your oppression. It deliver and it continues to deliver you from your depression. It continues to deliver you from BROKEN RELATIONSHIPS. IT CONTINUES to deliver you from health issues. &gt;&gt; What is a health issue? Whether it's A CANCER OR WHETHER IT'S A minor cold in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; I am the LORD GOD THAT HEALTH ALL. &gt;&gt; All he didn't he didn't name them cancer this that. No, HE SAID ALL. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN CLAIM Christmas totally healed &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE'S GIVEN YOU THE POWER TO BECOME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU CAN BE HEALED. YOU CAN BE RESTORED. YOU CAN BE REFRESHED. YOU CAN BE REFILLED. You can have a a new start. &gt;&gt; What do you need this morning? &gt;&gt; He's given you a GIFT THAT GOES BEYOND WHAT YOU COULD EVEN POSSIBLY IMAGINE. &gt;&gt; Are you WILLING TO RECEIVE THAT GIFT? &gt;&gt; Receive the gift. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. Listen uh in Ephesians next slide he says here and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church &gt;&gt; all things He says here, he says, uh, um, see down through the ages, we started off from the foundation from the first church age when the seed went in the ground, the complete seed. Then it come up through the feet. He's talking about the body here. Amen. Luther come back out then through Wesley then into Pentecostals the tongues in the lips. See now it's in the eyes prophetic of Malachi 4. Brother Brandham was talking about his his time his season. But that prophetic ministry is upon you. IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN PASSED DOWN UNTO YOU BECAUSE the lamb came down so that he could come and and and unite with you. So now you've got the fullness of the word. Amen. You've got the fullness. And he goes on and SO FORTH. AND NOW THERE'S NOTHING else left for it to come but him himself TO STEP INTO THAT CUZ THAT'S THE LAST THING THERE IS. WHAT IS HE STEPPING INTO? You and me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So that we can be the super sign in this in this age. Amen. So that we can display Christmas to the people. Glory to God. He says here in the next slide, he says the next is the intelligence and we have no intelligence of our own. Don't put your own interpretation on the word of God. &gt;&gt; God says, "MY WORD IS OF NO PRIVATE INTERPRETATION. I'M GOING TO interpret it. I'm going to send it. I'm going to raise up a people. THEY'RE GOING TO HEAR MY WORD. THEY'RE going to recognize my word. when they recognize it, they're going to come into the limelight to say, "This is the word for this day. I am the interpretation of Christmas in 2025." Hallelujah. Which is Christ in me, the hope of glory. Amen. I'VE GOT THE VOICE. I'VE GOT THE WORD. I'VE GOT THE THE THE living God that's that's infilling me. Amen. He says, "How can a man foresee these things? He can't do it. It's God himself." See, it's becoming to a place and he's governed the body all the way through. Then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride, &gt;&gt; which is what the the the bride is always known as the church. Amen. That was taken out of his side like Adam did at the beginning. Like Adam was rather at the beginning. Where did Eve come from? &gt;&gt; The side of Adam. WHERE'S GOD'S [screaming] BRIDE? GOD'S WIFE. WHERE IS SHE SEATED? &gt;&gt; At his right side. At his at his side. Amen. They two shall be one. &gt;&gt; You see the whole plan was at the beginning God when he created Adam in his image. He He made He made him male and female. Made them male and female and called their name Jesus. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE FIRST ADAM FELL, BUT THE SECOND ADAM WENT TO CALVARY &gt;&gt; TO CREATE A WAY BACK FOR HIS WIFE TO COME INTO HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Glory to God. Here we're winding down here. Uh just go to the next slide here. In Ephesians it says, "For no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church." Where are you getting your nourishment? Where are you getting your strength? Where are you getting your love? Where where where's your confidence, saints? Who's who's your encourager? It's the word. Amen. Even the Lord, the church. For we are members of his body and of his flesh and of his bones. Amen. We are the literal body of Christ in bride form. Son of man being revealed in bride form in these last days. &gt;&gt; NEXT SCRIPTURE IN CORINTHIANS. NOW YE ARE THE BODY of Christ and members in particular. &gt;&gt; There's a scripture I'm not making this up. I'M SHOWING YOU FROM THE word of God who you are. Amen. Glory to God. In modern events made by made clear by a vindicated prophecy, he says, "And so will the church come through justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost, restoration of the gifts, right on into the formed image of Christ." Christ is the bridegroom and the church is the bride and the bride is a part of the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They are one. That day you're going to know that he's in you &gt;&gt; and that you're in him. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. In Christ, the mystery of God revealed and his church stands alone. &gt;&gt; SHE IS NOT HOOKED WITH NOTHING. WE'RE NOT GOING TO CONNECT with the Christmas of of of this modern age. &gt;&gt; No, sir. THIS IS CHRISTMAS. &gt;&gt; THIS AND to you who believe, HE'S GIVEN YOU THE POWER TO BECOME. &gt;&gt; HE'S GIVEN YOU THE POWER TO OVERCOME. &gt;&gt; DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE AGE. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE THE THE THE THE pressures that are going to come to you from friends and family. NO, SIR. SHE IS NOT HOOKED WITH NOTHING. BUT HE WAS IDENTIFIED by God being the body that God dwelt in. And the CHURCH IS IDENTIFIED BY HIS BODY DOING the same thing. SHE IS HIS BODY, THE MANIFESTED truth of his promised word for the last days. And she and she alone stands by it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Let the musicians come. Praise God. Listen, Jesus came as a baby, not just to surprise us, though surprise us it did. And not as a disguise, though we certainly didn't recognize him. Jesus came as a baby precisely because every new life begins with a birth. &gt;&gt; And you're going to need that same birth to understand the true meaning of Christmas. Hallelujah. Glory to God. And and in his case, it was a miraculous birth. It was it was a miracle. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was without the aid of a human. &gt;&gt; God sent an angel &gt;&gt; and said, "Mary, you're blessed. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you today, church, YOU'RE BLESSED. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE RECEIVED AN ANGEL." HALLELUJAH. IT WASN'T BY HUMAN HANDS. YOUR BIRTH IS NOT SOMETHING SOMEBODY CAN, OH COME TO MY CHURCH. YOU'LL YOU'RE THIS IS WHERE YOU need to come. YOU MIGHT COME, BUT IF YOU DON'T HEAR, you're going to go. &gt;&gt; But if you're sheep, &gt;&gt; you're going to listen. You're going to hear. You're going to recognize. You're going to manifest. A sheep doesn't doesn't try to put on wool. A A SHEEP JUST AUTOMATICALLY BRINGS FORTH and produces wool. IT'LL AUTOMATICALLY PRODUCE THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. It won't be through some human aid because he was the son of God. But our new life in Christ begins with a new birth just as miraculous. I don't know about you, but I know that this was a miracle in my life. &gt;&gt; I stand here by a miracle. Amen. &gt;&gt; That I can see this word. Recognize the word that's been MADE FLESH IN MY DAY. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S BECAUSE THE POWER TO BECOME THE HOLY GHOST IN YOU gives you the ability to recognize the word for your day. Amen. That's the same way. Amen. Glory to God. Listen, verse 13 says, "He gave us the power to become children born of NA NO NOT OUT OF natural descent. You're not the son or daughter of your mom and dad. Naturally, you are, but you're a son or daughter of God. &gt;&gt; BEFORE YOU WERE A SON IN THIS WORLD, YOU WERE A SON OR DAUGHTER BACK THERE." &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS THE REALITY OF CHRISTMAS. This is what the word does for us. Amen. It brings us back the same way that he was born. This is the very good news. We have the power to overcome by believing his word. Be it unto me. And now as his sons and daughters, we recognize him and we receive him. As we recognize him, we can recognize who we are. And I can recognize who you are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. I'm just going to close here in a word of prayer. Amen. [music] The prophet prayed back in 1964. I came across this and I said, "Lord, this is a prayer that pertains to right now, to this church, to us." And he goes and he says, "Heavenly Father, bow your head, saints. Heavenly Father, we are grateful to see the risen Messiah. 2,000 [music] years ago, all kinds of theology and movements, but still in the darkness of it all, you promised that you would appear here in the last days in this Sodom day where the world is falling apart. And you would make yourself known to the children of Abraham, the called, the elected. And here you are tonight, this afternoon, after 2,000 years. You are just as much alive this afternoon as you were when you talked TO THE WOMAN AT the well. It's God manifested in flesh, now in flesh of his bride. For the bride and the husband is the selfsame flesh. These two are one and the church is becoming the bride all the time by believing the word. So that the word and the church becomes the same. The word in the church making it the bride the last sign. God identifying himself the word in the church. Oh blessed God, Jehovah God, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Lord, may this Christmas, Lord, may it be uh like never before. Father, may this word so manifest in our lives, Father, that as we go and we rub with the world and as we display the meaning of Christmas in our lives, Lord, may it bring light. May it bring a a a joy unspeakable. May it bring something, Lord, that the world did not expect that maybe a friend or a family member would would just say, "Oh, now I understand Christmas. Now I see what IT'S ALL ABOUT. NOW I can recognize how to become an overcomer. How to become a son or a daughter [music] of God. Granted, Lord, bless your people. Father, as we gather at our Christmas tables, oh God, may you be the invisible guest at that table. And may we rejoice and give you praise and glory [music] and honor. Lord, we love you. We appreciate you. Have your way in each and every one of [music] our lives. And Lord, as we now move into the order of the service where the young people will be Sunday school [music] will be bringing a play. Father, Lord, may you reflect through that play the word that was brought forth today. Father, may it vindicate your word. [music] May it become a reality to the people. May they realize, Father, this is Christmas. Blessed be your wonderful name. In Jesus Christ's name. Oh, joy to the world, the Lord has come. Let earth [singing] [music] receive her king. Let every [music] heart repair. And heaven and [music] nature sing. And heaven and nature sing. Heaven [music] and natures. Oh yes. Joy to the [music] world. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, [singing] we need a song. [music] Joy [music] to the world. and let her receive [music] her king. Let every heart [music] prepare his room. [music] [music] Oh [singing] no. [music] [music] He come to me. His blessings. [music] [music] For [singing] he rules the world and place [music] and make [music] the glory of his rightousness. [music] Oh, [music] joy to the world. Joy [music] to the world. Oh, see [music] [singing] you. [music] Oh, and heaven and angels sing. [music] Hallelujah. How many [music] enjoy the word today? Give us the power to become like him. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, at this time, I know we have a a play that's coming up and um there's a couple of refreshments for the people for [music] a little bit. We're going to we're going to leave the sanctuary and uh is that is that right? We're going to leave and have some refreshments. They get to set the stage and then we come back in probably about 20 minutes. Half an hour probably 20 minutes. Okay. All right. So, 20 minutes. Okay. [music] Give me greater [singing] than all my sins [music] is the blood that still cleanses. He's the grace that [music] still sets me free [music] to praise him. I know [music] that I'm not walking in [music] you. [singing] I can't fall [music] here. It's the still. [music] It's the still set free. [singing] [music] I know the [music] walking in you is I cannot [music] fall. Great. [music] I can't fall. Oh, I cannot fall. waiting all [music] day. &gt;&gt; Okay, so we got to clear up the stage. So you just be outside for a little bit, probably up to 20 minutes, [music] half an hour, and you come back in again. [music] &gt;&gt; [music]
