[0:01] uh excuse because the pastor himself has
[0:04] set you free to not have to worry about
[0:07] uh anything because what he's saying I I
[0:10] see I see it standing here too. I get
[0:13] all excited and all of a sudden
[0:14] something strikes me and I look back and
[0:15] I
[0:18] see and I think something must be wrong
[0:21] with
[0:23] me back. Yeah. So, uh, anyway, uh, but
[0:28] you're free to worship the Lord. And to
[0:30] me, you know what? I was just thinking
[0:33] that if I, uh, go to a ball game and I
[0:37] pay money to go to that ball game, I'm
[0:39] going to I'm going to get everything I
[0:41] can out. So, I want to leave early. No,
[0:43] I'm not leaving early to the end. I want
[0:45] to get everything I can. And the way
[0:47] that I have to fight to get into here in
[0:49] the house of the Lord, I don't want to
[0:51] be fallen asleep. That's right. I don't
[0:53] want to be if if the spirit touches me,
[0:55] I want to be free. I want to get
[0:57] everything I can before I walk out the
[0:58] door. I don't

[3:08] I should not praise the Lord. He's been
[3:13] so good to me.
[3:16] [Music]
[3:23] every single
[3:33] [Music]
[3:51] The
[3:55] living reveal to
[3:59] me I
[4:02] was
[4:05] [Music]
[4:06] seeing I
[4:07] [Music]
[4:09] sing of the praise of
[4:14] Oh my
[4:17] washing my bra.
[4:21] [Music]
[4:29] [Music]
[4:34] [Music]
[4:39] [Music]
[4:43] Hallelujah.
[4:52] Amen. Thank God that the message found
[4:54] me. You know, we we were last week we
[4:57] had some fellowship there and uh
[4:58] actually Sister Carling here was all of
[5:01] a sudden she started giving a testimony
[5:04] and there it was so quiet you would
[5:06] hear. Nobody said a word, but just
[5:09] expressing how what God had done and how
[5:12] he had brought her along. And
[5:13] everything if she were to jump all
[5:17] around praise the Lord right now, I
[5:19] would say bless the
[5:21] Lord. It wouldn't bother me
[5:25] either, but that's the way it ought to
[5:27] be with each one of us. You've been
[5:28] around a long time, brother. You got
[5:30] some moss back spirit. Forget it. You
[5:32] should be praising the Lord. Anyway,
[5:34] this message found me. I was blind and I
[5:36] could not see.
[5:38] down. I was blind and I could not see
[5:41] and something supernatural took place
[5:43] and allowed me to see the the grace of
[5:44] God. Praise him. Praise God. Praise God.
[5:47] If I feel happy again, why shouldn't I
[5:50] praise the Lord? He's been so good to
[5:54] me.
[6:09] [Music]
[6:21] Amen. Praise God. Praise God. You may be
[6:24] seated.
[6:26] As you know, um we will be uh giving
[6:29] announce
