God today our agenda is to have the message brought to you after which we will speak briefly on the balloting process and then as we leave and as we are going out box will be in the back and there'll be deacons just standing by to make sure it's all safe and you'll just drop your ballot in it and myself it'll be brought to myself and sister Simon and they're trying to adjust the sound and we will um you know do that we will not presently talk about that but we'll go to the word um today by God's grace we want to speak on the topic of the unveiling of God or really the topic I placed it as the revelation of the mystery the revelation of the mystery that is the topic underlying that what you will be looking at really is the unveiling of God praise the Lord okay then we will go to our scripture found in Romans chapter 16 we welcome all of the Believers who are not here in the building with us but a lot are watching online on this particular day out in the east in the west wherever they are amen covered by the blood faithful and believing God's word for the hour but we will start by reading from Romans 16 verses 25 to 27. The Book of Romans 16 25 to 27. amen now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was Kept Secret since the world began but now is made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the Commandment of the Everlasting God made known to All Nations for The Obedience of faith the god to God only wise be glory through Jesus Christ forever amen God bless you gracious heavenly father as we stand before your people your beloved uh bride we pray that you will bless us everyone may the great Holy Spirit uh oh God surround us father with his warm embrace of love for the word May the word of God go forth in his Purity and in its strength and may you receive all the glory all the praise father in Jesus name amen God bless you please be seated foreign taking this marvelous thought through the revelation of the mystery which was Kept Secret since the world began uh the secret since the world began in other words that's speaking about uh it had to be kept secret from the time we were sent down here to become flesh it the secret really started because once it was in God's mind it was already hit but when it could be made known or the enemy could detect it pick it up or try to mess around with it is when it left his lips or his word come down to become word it's the same thought brother Branham Express I'm just going to talk with you is that all right um brother Branham expressed when he was saying I know better I can think what I want God can reveal something to me and I can have it in my mind for a long time but he says I know better than to speak it because the moment I speak it then the devil has something now he can work with he can then now begin to try to impersonate and he can all try to copy cats and everything else it's the same thought I'm bringing to you that our um uh it became a mystery from the moment that God said let there be in the word will not begin to be expressed the seeds with the promise of life eternal life in them begin to come to the Earth to to be waiting in the field the dirt and the corruption of this evil world for their time and season to come when God would send a a messenger or one of his workers in his field that would uh water it and and so that it could come to life and begin him to bring forth after his kind in other words whatever he placed in them were told them they ought to do or purpose in their heart his heart that they should do that potential in the seed of God begins to wake up it begins to come to life by his Spirit working through his Messengers now coming more directly to this subject the mystery what is this mystery that we are really talking about we have read about it in the Bible many times and now we read it in the word here the revelation of the mystery that was Kept Secret since the world began now we know as a brother Branham said one of my old books here Christ is the mystery Christ is the mystery of God revealed so this is the uh mystery it's not the revelation of Jesus this is not the revelation of the man Jesus for he was only the flesh or the skin that Jehovah was living in so it was not a revelation of him the man but the Revelation Christ is the mystery of God revealed amen praise the Lord now so we understand Colossians 1 19 for it pleased the father not in him amen should all fullness dwell so the fullness was not in Jesus but Christ is the mystery of God being revealed male and female amen all of God being revealed and at one time it's telling us it was all in Christ so Christ is the mystery of God revealed praise God hallelujah and again Colossians 2 9 for in him developed all the fullness of the godhead bodily amen hallelujah now Christ is the mystery of God revealed page 16. now God's Great secret he had it in him before the world began that you see it was in the back parts of God's mind there was something he was going to achieve and he had a motive for doing it it was in order to let himself be expressed amen hallelujah and then again page 17 here he says God had a purpose and a hidden Mystery and that's what I want to speak about to the church the hidden Mystery of God the hidden Mystery of God that he had in his mind before the world ever began and how that this mystery has been unfolding praise God Hallelujah the mystery has unfolded from the time we were expressed came down was sent down here it's being expressed through the ages and the book has been on being unfolded amen age by age Page by Page has been unfolding and making itself known for the glory of God hallelujah so it unfolded itself right down right now to this present hour Hallelujah the book unfolding amen hallelujah that we're living in then you will understand clearly what is being done for this great mystery this secret he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about it not even the angels didn't understand it hallelujah praise God that's the reason under our seventh mystery seventh seal what it was opened there was only silence praise God if you understand what I'm talking about when he says for this was the mystery coming of Christ amen not the mystery coming of just Jesus coming back but the mystery coming of Christ is not him only coming for the Rapture but the coming of the Bride which is the other part of the godhead to come on the scene and the seal is now unveiling it's time for her to be expressed and to be made manifest by the word of God in this hour hallelujah amen praise the Lord oh my you see Hallelujah because you see he had revealed yet how he would come and he hadn't revealed when he would come hallelujah oh my what you see he has shown he has showed or revealed it in the ver in the Bible amen praise God therefore the entire Bible is the revelation of God's great mystery in Christ where was the mystery in Christ where was The Bride In Christ where was the wife in Christ hallelujah we're talking about the unveiling of the god of Heaven amen making himself known male and female praise God hallelujah now I I just want to give you these things here and then you will look at the scriptures of yourself hallelujah amen now God expressed in Jesus Christ God who was bought Father Son and Holy Ghost you believe that we serve one God we don't serve a trinity but we serve one God who manifests themselves in that way for he was the great spirit in the great beyond he needed a body that he could live in live a perfect life to die as a bloody bleeding Lambs laying Hallelujah that he might redeem back his people and so he created a body for himself named Jesus God was in Christ reconcerting the world to himself not to somebody else but we was reconciling the world to himself amen so he lived in that body and the body was called the son and any human being or body that God places his life his seed in that they become silence their Lord are Sons and Daughters of the Living God hallelujah amen so we see now that here he was God's father and Holy Ghost amen the fullness of the godhead bodily see now the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church where does it dwell in his church amen praise God because Christ poured himself in the church amen so now the church has the fullness of the godhead bodily I just I'm just thinking remembering where uh breathing where brother Brandon said don't you understand what Jesus was trying to tell those Pharisees and Sadducees he said if you call your prophets gods you call them Gods common g-o-d-s for the spirit of God was in them and speaking through them using them and you call them Gods how is it when the Son of God comes on the scene here son of man comes on the scene and you don't even recognize him who he is that's all of them prophets all of them Patriarchs all of them combined in this one being person named Jesus God wasn't Christ reconciling the world unto himself amen and then what happened all God was all that fullness was poured into Christ and all that Christ was is poured into the church hallelujah praise God hallelujah amen Lord of God I'm just moving on because I don't want to dwell on on those things right there praise the name of the Lord now praise God let me see if I got one page here I don't want to miss out on anything uh for you praise the Lord yes okay now we go to Genesis 5 1. this is the book of the generations of Adam in the day that God created man in the likeness of him made he him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name Adam amen praise God in the day when they were created you see so they appear to be seen like two persons but in the mind of God is actually one person because the wife was in the husband amen she was in Adam it was there until God separated them she was in him and he called their name Adam praise the lord it's the same thing happening again now with the second Adam praise God that she was in him and now she comes forth not as one woman but as a many-membered body but their name is still Christ Jesus Christ amen see so Christ is the mystery of all of God being now revealed now being revealed or expressed or manifested entire human race praise God hallelujah amen hallelujah so now I'm going to show you when you're raised up and God raised Jesus from the dead you understand he raised you up already also praise God so you understand because we were in him when he was taken to the grave and raised up you were raised up in him we were raised up in him because we are one with him and in him praise God he raised you up also and also quick little life with him you are now quickened to life not give an eternal life but Quicken to the life that's already in you the life that is in you've been woke up has been quickened brought you to awareness to recognition you come out of your spiritual Amnesia and you begin to clearly recognize you are different no matter how much you you're a human you got to do the same thing as Mortals and you gotta walk us Mortals but there is something in your heart you recognize individually personally that you are different you are mad different because God made us that way and place him apart of himself within us praise the name of the Lord you came to church or you got born again some of you knew it before you even stepped into a test building you were different and you didn't know why but praise God for this great day and hour God opening the word revealing himself and making himself known to his children hallelujah oh my see remember now that though you see you were quickened right there but you see though you were an attribute only in his thoughts but God served it all in him so when he died buried rose again God is seen not just Jesus but you're seeing him and his bride all in him praise God Hallelujah for remember he went there to Golgotha with you in him God had never yet never separated the bride from the broom yet amen she was in him you remember before God said oh it's not good for a man to be alone that Adam was alone in the garden and then God says it's not good for him to be alone so I'll just separate the wife that's in him from him so that he can have a companion made out of the same product as himself amen I won't use the dirt that's there as I'm there but I'll just use PARTA himself amen so this is what's happening it's actually happening now in our day not with the first Adam this is happening now with the new creation of the second Adam God is now doing the same thing praise God so so you see he had never separated the bride from the groom as yet so when God looked down upon the body of Christ he saw bought male and female it was all being redeemed in one body hallelujah praise Peter God lord of God they are one they are the same word because whatever Adam was made out God made her out from Adam brother Brandon said she was not he didn't go back to the ground to find some no he took part of Adam himself now he has taken a part of the second Adam who is the word amen and made her the bride the wife for this great day and for this hour amen so the same word that spoke or speaks of the Bride of the groom is speaking of the brain so when we say the Mighty God unveiled that was only talking about the head being unveiled but when it talks he preached again and now he preached on the unveiling of God he's talking not only of the God God himself but he's talking about now the unveiling of the Bride young failing of the wife being mad no Hallelujah hidden Parables hidden all kinds of Parables and veils and hid behind all kinds of things the secret the mystery of God now to be met known in this day in this hour when the seals are revealed and he's trying to speak to his own people that they might understand what he has been doing down Through the Ages amen praise God you see the same word spoke of the groom speaks of the bride God foresaw the bride in the groom hallelujah praise be to God Amen all in that wonderful to know is the same yesterday and today and forever Christ is the mystery of God revealed God Christ is the mystery of God now being revealed in bright form for his honor and Glory because the Mighty God using a prophet Malachi 4 5 unveiled himself to us that he is real that he is the supernatural Mighty God that rules the universe Elohim and that's why his name is plural because he is one God but he had all this many membered body in him as thoughts as attributes now expressed upon the Earth for the glory of God so the Mighty God unveiled before us and the prophet has unveiled a word like no man has ever done yeah that word was unveiled through him to us to this day so that we can come to an understanding and a recognition of him and who he really is blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah amen oh yes so God speaking through that Prophet clearly made it clear and clear to us that he is the head of everything he has the king he is king of kings and Lord of lords and he asked me Eminence amen hallelujah amen yes sir so we understand we are here not to recognize William branham's words we love and respect brother Bradham yeah but we are here to recognize God's word the word being made known through the prophet of this hour that's what we are to recognize Hallelujah unlike the wise men of old when they're locked up in the heavens they were reading their Bibles and they didn't have Bibles then but I'm just using that to tell you they might have been using reading Scrolls of the child of the talmud and of the Torah and they are reading the books of Moses and as they were reading it was wonderful that was righteousness for that time but as they were reading it and they saw the star of the Eastern Star up in the heavens they recognized the scriptures had said when you see the star of Jesse raised in the sky amen you know that the Messiah has to be on the earth now praise God and we now in our day we look around and when we see the Western Star William Marion Branham use of God with a life and a Ministry no Pentecostal no Minister since the days of Jesus Christ amen their life their ministry will never enter never match up they can only talk against it but they cannot match it oh my but God put the western style for us to recognize that day is almost done and at evening time it shall be like so he sends a prophet on the scene the Shine the Light of the Gospel Upon Our Hearts for us to recognize what is being done in this day an hour hallelujah praise God now John the Baptist knew that when when his ministry began Hallelujah if I am here on the Earth and Malachi again uh I can't remember Malachi one or part of Malachi 3 where it tells you that he would send this messenger before his face and he says now before his face so if I am here already on the earth and animals ready uh 33 years old or 30 years old and he is just like six months younger than me then he's got to be on the earth now there's got to be on the earth how am I gonna fall run and if he's not here so John caught the Revelation for himself that Jesus had to be on earth somewhere but who is this lamb who is this Jesus he didn't know but the Bible tells us when Jesus began to walk down that Shore and John looked up on him he recognized Hallelujah nobody told him but by your Revelation he knew this is the one and he said behold the word Behold the Lamb of God that taken away the sins of the world Amen he knew that Messiah had to be on earth now Hallelujah and so in this hour we see the same thing when we see the western star in the sky we recognize the fullness of the word has to be on the earth now the person of Jesus Christ has to be already here on the earth now praise Peter God hallelujah so we have recognized him in the word praise the Lord amen we realize also that brother Brandon William Marion Branham did not break the Seven Seals the Bible says it plainly the lamb broke the seals so then as humans we are looking and a man comes out to the platform and he preaches the word he opens the revelation of the mystery that's been hit in the world word of God for ages and ages and nobody could open it they all had little insights here little insights there and said a little good things partially here partially there but now the whole thing unfolds before our eyes and it's done through William Marion Branham and a lot of people want to put emphasis on the man William Marion Branham God bless him God continue to bless him and all that he has done for the glory of God but realize that it was the lamb came down and the lamb spoke through his lips that's why he presents that for the spirit speaks through the prophet amen and then what are greater than Solomon is here here oh my God himself is his own interpreter he will make it plain amen there is a man here that can turn on the light amen not William Branham but Jesus Christ amen anointed by the word of the Living God hallelujah yes sir so we understand that with the coming of the mighty Angel The Covenant angel with the rainbow around his head which is Christ which is our bridegroom who is the headship of the entire bride body and our spiritual husband praise God the Lord Jesus Christ then when the mighty angel came down then Jesus Christ is on earth now he is here with us praise the Lord descending and now revealing and making no of himself Isaac talking to Rebecca once again making himself known to her as she talks to him he's talking back to her by the opening of the word oh blessed be the name of the Lord just waiting now to take his bride away and take her by translation through the abundance of Revelation glory to God hallelujah amen what have we learned yes sir about this unveiling of the Mighty God Amen was God making himself known to the present day spiritual Rebecca the bride church amen isn't that wonderful brethren that God can be talking to us plainly simply out of the word of God I'm not trying to make it some Supernatural fantastic or fantasy this is not a fantasy this is not some illusion or some science fiction something written up by a man to delude your mind or something like that you're not believing in some kind of Willow the whispering that will just vanish away one day no this is here to stay it's eternal amen this ain't going anywhere it's not going to change praise the Lord it may dwindle some people may not want to hear it but let me tell you this is the Eternal Word of God hallelujah I don't have to be here none of us have to be here God will find somebody that will take the word and keep running with the word of God blessed do the name of the Lord God hallelujah amen yes sir this was and is the revelation of him the male the headship that's what was being revealed through brother Branham he was revealing the headship revealing him to the entire bright church that was the servant like elieza saying uh look there is Isaac there is Isaac over there amen identifying the word identifying Isaac so that she will know him when she's spend enough time with the word or spending of time listening to the text when she's spending us time you know hearing him studying the word praying being with him in his presence she begins to notice and take his as peculiarities she began to recognize him recognizes footsteps recognizes voice she began to recognize everything about him praise the name of the Lord hallelujah in that way he becomes the head of the body he becomes Master as the scripture says over his own house amen he becomes a master over his own household praise the Lord and husband over his new creation wife his new creation house amen which is his spiritual body amen now we're talking today mainly about the unveiling of her the wife praise the Lord I've been talking and there about the unveiling of God the head him Jesus making himself known but she inspired him so when it says unveiling of God as a prophet said it's speaking of them both in one praise the Lord because now he's come to marry her back to himself for her to where does he come from his side and was separated for a while from his side now the time must come when she's supposed to go back to his side amen and so we are on our trip now we are not joining now we are traveling back to God as the light will come from God then you go to God this world is not her home we're just a passing through or Treasures are LED up Way Beyond the blue the Angels Bethany to Heaven's open door and we can't feel at home in this world anymore oh praise God forevermore I feel the pull a hero boys I know God by his spirit is drawing us closer and closer to him praise God hallelujah amen yes sir Hallelujah let me tell you friends we are just we were just attributes but God saw it all from beginning to end Hallelujah a scripture just came to my mind and I I didn't know exactly where to place some of these scriptures so I just put them here but what did he say in Revelation Revelation 10 when when the seven angels will come and he begins to preach the mystery of God would be what 50. is that right so you'll see how we were thinking this great mysterious something is going to be finished it's talking about the work of finishing up the bride right it's going to be finished and the Seven Angel comes to do what send out the word which will finish the mystery complete the mystery and call the last ones in wherever they are and the Mystery would be finished then hallelujah amen amen right quoting brother Brandon you don't mind this no no amen praise the Lord I don't want to uh to sound too much that I am sedated to the point that I I I get too soft because I'm excited personally and I don't want to get too excited that I don't get the truth out to you and just to Ramble On I want you to be sure because we handled here quoting brother Brandon but remember he went there with you in him for God had never separated the bride from that bridegroom yet amen but God foresaw the bride in the groom now let's go to the word we go over to the Philadelphian Church age page 295 and there's been a lot of preaching about this in the Church of Lake praise God from the marriage of the Gentile bride and bridegroom amen and uh Brothers talking about the the husband will never fail his wife it's all there the spirit is there and it's being picked up and it's being preached listen read Isaiah 96 brother Brandon was saying this 9 verse 6 and the government shall be upon his shoulder what does this mean the answer is this government up on his shoulder it comes from the wedding ceremony of the East see when the bride has been committed to the groom then the time comes she takes off the Veil see and president on the groom's shoulders signifying not only is she under his Dominion she has transformed her rights to him he is now her head and also he Bears now responsibilities for her and care for her and that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has any right or any responsibility and that beloved is the Key of David God being Sovereign you everything by Divine decree exactly who would be in his bride hallelujah praise God see he chose her I won't go on but the point is that now the unveiling of God the time has come for the lifting of the veil from off of the Bride that people might recognize the public display of God in Christ Christ in the church the bride manifesting God to the hour that we are living in blessed be the name of the Living God hallelujah amen praise God isn't he wonderful she takes off the Veil Hallelujah in the wonderful he takes the veil off praise God and now the veil from the bride is lifted oh my oh my goodness you are you've seen some you've never seen the old Indian movies from India where are China when the bride is getting married their face is covered with a veil many other cultures would have that process also even here in the west we have that process but it's by wearing I don't know what you call that cloth that uh that type of mess or cloth they wear over over their faces or around their faces to the side but really that's supposed to be all around so that they are veiled Avail and the bridegroom but then he's seen them before he's seen them all the time but now she comes there as a ceremony with her face Veil but now he is saying praise God God is to fail now has to come off because it's marrying times a marriage age amen he's looking for the bride and the invisible Union age amen when each individual comes into a relationship with God Amen and you walk with him and talk with him praise the name of the Lord uh I did not he's reminding me now I did not bring a coat where he said here the time must come when Jehovah is now taking the veil of God Jehovah is God how's he going to take the veil off God you see how is he going to take the bell of God but he's not talking about himself he's talking taking the veil off his bride that she could have made manifest and he could look right into her face and she could look at him also praise be to God with nothing standing there before because the veil is lifted off of her praise the name of the Lord of course we know that the bride is God's Masterpiece how many knows that why is that a masterpiece Michelangelo takes so many years laying on his back in that look I I went in that Sistine Chapel and see that handy work let me tell you something that man had to be inspired by God or he couldn't do that oh my goodness every piece everything Perfection amen and the same way whether badam used that illustration he says in the same way God himself was doing what creating a masterpiece but his Masterpiece was not a painting the Masterpiece was persons people I pray a body he was shaping and forming from the what just as much as Adam was formed even so Eve was being formed but she was being formed with a part of himself amen and it took him my friends these great agents amen hallelujah you know any artist when he's working on the masterpiece he works on it and he works on it in secret he does it behind closed doors and if any public person is going to come in there he covers it with a cloth or something he covers it up he doesn't want it to be seen until he's finished and then when he's finished then he whips It Off from from that to display now now the public can see it because they're not going to just sing Wesley like that they're going to see the entire thing so now I can take the van off of it the unveiling of the Mighty God before his people for the glory of God hallelujah amen yes sir when he's when he's done with that he can say man can I see your painting today can I see your scripture today yes I can I can show my my great uh scripture to you now and he whips it off and what does he say it is finished it is finished the Battle Is Over the victory is won it's all finished now you can look at it and see it because now the bride is separated from the bright room and you can recognize her in our own right son of man now being revealed as it was in the days of lot and then nor and so on we see the son of man now being revealed not in the New Testament but now in this day and in this hour being revealed to us again for the glory of God so that we can come into public viewing and the prophet said it in his own way that the time but at the time when uh that statement was made when he talked about the bride will have to come to the place where you know she's gonna have to be on failed publicly publicly for a short season and then the people will begin to recognize that that she's got to be the bride she is the one that is chosen for himself amen he'll be of a public display but for only a short season that when the Rapture is close it's the shorter season than you expect or that you can recognize or know the world goes on us and always there's oh they're talking about the end of the world and people have been talking about that and says that in James that they're going to mock saying that I mean talking about the end of the world the end of the world doesn't come yet they're talking about right Jesus coming he hasn't come yet they're talking about Rapture uh you know I talk about the comment already it hasn't come yet and when the people get dumbed down and they don't think that it's there anymore suddenly he comes on the scene and calls people away for his glory and for his honor amen hallelujah so we thank God he didn't build his Masterpiece in one day some people think he built the bride only on our age but he's been building the bride Through the Ages some from Luther some from Wesley some from methodists right on down through here he's been building them do you know in every single Church any kind you can think of with any fantastic name on it God already had Bridal class people in there doesn't matter what you think so this denomination they're in there that's what he was trying to tell Elijah when he likes that oh I'm the only one that loves you I'm the only Prophet that you have now God says yes that is true but look over there right I've got some hiding in Jezebel Palace she right there and and they're eating from our table food that's being offered to false gods and I'm letting them eat that food why because they already know that food has no effect on them they already know that food is not going to really sustain them and they recognize me but I have them there why because they may have to talk to some other seed or something in there and God causes them to recognize that now what I'm saying there are a lot of message preachers don't believe it but I believe there is not elected Jehovah in the message we got the with the lexed in this now the elector everywhere everywhere so that's why we have to watch what we talk what we say Amen yes because God have them hidden up everywhere and when he is ready he calls them out to himself for his glory amen praise God the veil is now being lifted from our eyes I think there's a song that says lift the veil from my eyes and let me see Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart amen praise the name of the Lord so the bride comes into Plain View amen so the bright the left bride is the present day revelation of the mystery the unveiling of God the wife that he God just like Adam had his wife hidden in himself which is the word he had his wife hidden within himself which is the word and that is why when the seventh seal broke he says now the spirit is now calling their names not their Earthly name like we explained that when we left his presence amen as a spirit beings amen we have to come here and be placed in a body and like like Mary was told or call that body call that a child Jesus amen you come down here and you have to have an Earthly name but then that is not your name that he knows you by and he knows you by that name and that name cannot really be written down but when the word of God is preached then the spirit of God by the preachment of the word calls your name how do you know your name is being called you can call my name in the darkest night and I don't have to think about it unconsciously I right away I want to know who's calling me who's calling me unconsciously yeah you know when the word is being preached you you I can't explain it but you will feel or hear something pulling you from out of that word it's pulling on your spirit it's appealing to your soul not your reason it don't make sense this is that dude no to your soul amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah for God for his wonderful hidden Mystery amen this great mystery of all the ages where God was building his Masterpiece go back to the quotation we gave where brother Brandon says don't you know he's been building feet right on up up to the speaking in terms up through the body right to the age of the seeing age and after that seeing age of a prophetic Ministry there's no more moving parts is that right it goes right back to the age of the Mind amen and goes right down to the soul back to the world where it come from praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen so Through the Ages what have we been seeing we see a mystery wrapped in another mystery wrapped in another mystery hallelujah praise God hallelujah amen so she was being formed through the ages from the word material that he came he was made of Hallelujah now the unveiling of the of God or up there the true elect Brian didn't start in this age here now it started since the day of Pentecost the unveiling started from Pentecost he's unveiling each part he unveiled this part then he unveiled the foot then he unveiled uh Wesley the parts that the take away Holiness takes away all kinds of dirt from the body then he unveiled the tongues you know and then he unveiled the possibility of discernment and God like that the eyes and so on he began to do that God was unveiling the church but in thoughts but now we come to the end when the entire thing is coming back together and he is unveiling the whole picture before us hallelujah for the glory of God Amen what blessing it is to know praise the Lord now we go if we want to take a scriptural background we understand that Moses wore a veil on his face and God was foreshadowing and causing us to see this through the word amen that this is what he was actually doing because Moses was like acting out what God himself was doing God had the veil and he allowed that veil of the law to be on the face of the Jews until this very day they still have balls at it they still have the veil of Moses over their face and they can't see the purity of the word of God in any kind of a way and and so the this veil of rituals this veil of laws this veil of all kinds of feast days everything is a veil that's covering them that they can't see the word and preventing the word from coming into Plain View praise God hallelujah but now God has changed as you know he's changing back from the Gentiles to go back to the Jews and to make himself known to them as you know he will do on Mount Zion and then he'll say they say where where you got those holes in your hand well I got it from in the house of your my friends I got it from you right and then the Bible tells us how they're going to repent and wail and everything else like that on the 144 000 will be called out by the ministry of Moses and Elijah amen whom they will initially kill and they'll lay in the streets for three days and to prove that their gods indeed original servants amen the Bible says God will raise them up because they're going to leave their bodies in the streets to desecrate them and and to leave them there to rock in the streets but instead of rotting it on rice and they stand on their feet and give glory to God and Revival will break out in Israel Hallelujah and that's why the spirit of God says to brother Branham do don't go with them he went right to the borders he says do not go there it is not your part to do that Elijah and Moses will come and they will do that amen so he had to turn around we face fear and everything you turn around come right back to America because God was going to do that but now it's changing it's now right now it's the Gentiles are the ones that being unveiled from the nominational veils from all kinds of traditional unveils of rituals that they have had to go through in all these Church ages they had to have these things taken away from them and they who were spiritual blind and walking in spiritual Darkness like that and in ignorance of the word of God the veil is being lifted off of us by the word of God being unveiled to us in this day and in this hour praise God hallelujah and so here she stands like a Statue of Liberty the bride standing there on a pedestal in the in the air before the entire world but because there is no beauty that was desired of him now there is no Beauty to be the desired of her brother Brandon said that's why she's called God's Speckled Bird right speckled with the blood of Jesus Christ amen o praise God hallelujah praise God how wonderful I'm gonna I'm gonna just uh just the free will continue free willing and talking to you here you see my brother's sister that now she's on that pedestal and now the whole mystery is just about finished the last one about to be called of course you know there's many many more things I could have said but it's only so much time we have and and I feel that I've I've come to the closer end of what I wanted to get out you can take whatever you see or hear study the scriptures reach out in the word of God and let the Holy Spirit make known himself to you but it's not over in this sense now that she or any painting is put on the pedestal or put on the wall for viewing she must now go through the Hall of critics and God allows her to stand there to Bear the reproach for his word because she know him herself that she is perfection Perfection for Perfection dwells within outward leaves this that that the other and that's the devil's job is going to say look at this look at that did you hear that did you see that did you yes that's the devil's job but that man inside that woman Inside perfect amen but the prophet said it clear it's plain now that she's displayed she got to pass through the Hall of the critics is that right oh my wow just think of it the word already passed through what after it was preached it had to go through indictment and crucifixion so that she could rise up to be on the scene and to be unveiled hallelujah praise God but she got to go through another book of Acts where she has got to walk and said this is not Moses law let's kill them let's burn them let's do this let's do that so look it's not telling you that this is just an easy Road amen it's not an easy Road even though you recognize what God has done what he is doing you must recognize along with that comes the critics the buzzards and all the other things that go with it so we must bear the reproach for the word of God praise the Lord he's wonderful isn't he musicians can you come praise the Lord and now we're going to uh amen praise the name of the Lord yes be certainly will um do that by the musicians are coming praise the Lord I'm glad that I don't know about you about you but one thing I'm asserting off that God has opened my eyes to see the revelation of the word in its fullness and you can look around wherever you want but I'm telling you I've got a hold of something or something got a hold of me that is making this word sing sing to you that you can hear him through the word amen that's not me talking about myself but that's just me telling you because for a fact that is so and it ties right into this Bible praise the Lord and may God bless you if you recognize what God is doing may God bless you in a wonderful and in a remarkable way praise the name of the Lord and the Victory is what what's that song that says the baptism or you got you you have something yes brother praise the Lord how does that go [Music] first I don't it is finished there will be no more war [Music] s [Music] it is finished and Jesus is Lord amen you understand when he preached on that great message the greatest battle ever fought he says you see it's like two great Powers fighting for No Man's Land is that right just from in the back from the garden to now uh both Powers fighting for this woman to be their wife is that right amen but the battle is now over the victory is one the lamb has prevailed hallelujah amen the conflict is over praise God Amen spiritually we're saying that is over nothing the devil stop fighting he's going to continue to fight until he's placed into hell praise God so let's stand for just a moment so you can change your position shake out your leg I don't mean to start dancing but shake out your leg to make sure it hasn't seized up on you because mind sometimes sees up temporarily for a while until I eat you know take some omega-3 or cod liver oil and loosen up the bones and shake them up praise God hallelujah let's sing it together amen it is over it is finished the back you better give me the right tune I've come changing from preaching to singing and I'm just getting it is finished the battle is over it is finished there will be no more yes [Music] it is finished and Jesus Hallelujah I'm so glad it is finished [Music] okay it is [Music] is finished [Music] may God bless you and may you fully understand what God has been doing Through the Ages and what he is doing at the present time this great revelation of his great mystery and thank God if you're a Believer you are a part of it whether you recognize it or not God is going to do what he has to do amen so God will fulfill his word I'd like to announce to you the passing of our brother John Brennan brother Mike Brennan uh older brother praise the name of the Lord how many of you know
