[30:23] you know Salvation
[30:26] God gave it to us it's a gift the gift
[30:30] of God is a gift of God
[30:32] but the Bible said ask
[30:35] and you shall receive
[30:38] ask
[30:41] is something that we have to take it
[30:43] serious
[30:46] remember when a child needs something
[30:51] what is does she do she cry he or her
[30:55] cry unto the mother
[30:58] the mother couldn't nothing can hold
[31:00] that child until
[31:03] you certified that child
[31:05] if he's hungry
[31:07] the only way he can get it it has to be
[31:10] desperate
[31:12] when you ask God this man was desperate
[31:18] desperation bring God's on the scene
[31:22] as the children of God God has given us
[31:25] everything look here I'm gonna explain
[31:27] how
[31:29] and Who We Are
[31:32] as children of God right now
[31:36] you know
[31:38] people
[31:41] can go to a a baseball
[31:44] or any celebrity singers wherever famous
[31:48] people
[31:49] and they would oppress this man no
[31:53] matter what the if there was a they want
[31:56] a what a signature that is an autograph
[31:58] or something
[32:00] and when these people get that thing
[32:02] they cherish some of them you know what
[32:05] they do
[32:06] they even frame
[32:08] that mind with the signature and put on
[32:11] the wall and worship that thing
[32:15] let me tell you
[32:17] if the weather people can do that
[32:22] what about me and you look here
[32:26] the Bible said
[32:30] the Lord Jesus said he has each and
[32:33] every one in the palm of his son
[32:38] how he does that he uses his own look
[32:41] tattoo you know the tattoo when they put
[32:44] a tattoo they use the person's blood to
[32:47] write
[32:48] whatever they need to draw or right
[32:50] there
[32:52] but look here how did the Lord have in
[32:56] Us in his son he used his own blood on
[33:00] the cross
[33:02] and engrave our name
[33:05] in his Primes
[33:09] remember
[33:11] you
[33:13] are the real celebrity
[33:16] that man could ever look
[33:21] remember we are God children
[33:24] and when God have you in in the palm of
[33:27] his son there is nothing that can take
[33:31] that
[33:33] that name are from his hand
[33:36] because it's in there who gonna take his
[33:39] name out
[33:40] nobody
[33:42] you are
[33:44] the real celebrities
[33:48] let me tell you when somebody comes to
[33:51] you
[33:52] and asks you to give autograph
[33:56] Hallelujah and that autograph is going
[34:00] to Heart of him
[34:01] we are in the Hall of Fame
[34:04] that the people will never imagine
[34:07] how we are
[34:10] we are something peculiar
[34:13] that the man
[34:16] cannot see
[34:18] but God looked to you as somebody that
[34:22] the words in this world here cannot
[34:24] explain
[34:27] do not underestimate yourself
[34:33] when something happened to you
[34:36] you have to recognize Who You Are
[34:40] when somebody comes to you or you go to
[34:43] somebody
[34:45] and you pray for that person
[34:48] you know
[34:51] that act that took praise that time
[34:55] is in the Hall of Fame
[34:58] one day
[35:00] during that judgment that person gonna
[35:02] see that he came to you
[35:05] and address him and you give your
[35:08] signature to that person Hallelujah
[35:14] what is your signature the words that
[35:17] come from your mouth is life
[35:20] how the Lord Jesus Christ engrave our
[35:23] names in his heart his life he gave his
[35:26] life so that he can put our name in his
[35:30] son
[35:31] Oh Glory To His holy name
[35:34] so Bradley
[35:36] let me tell you
[35:43] the Creator himself
[35:47] has you in the palm of his hand
[35:53] can you imagine you can create your own
[35:57] atmosphere
[35:59] around you
[36:00] that's why I said no Christians supposed
[36:03] to be sad
[36:04] there's no sadness in Christianity
[36:08] because Christianity is a joy
[36:12] remember when the trials and Temptation
[36:15] and trepidation comes
[36:17] it comes to strengthen you
[36:20] because our law went through that
[36:24] why for example
[36:27] Paul went through that
[36:29] for what an example
[36:32] job went through that for what an
[36:35] example
[36:37] so when something happened to you or
[36:40] anything happened to you don't stay in
[36:42] the corner and go to your shell
[36:46] and thinking
[36:48] you
[36:49] Hallelujah
[36:51] thank you Lord when the trial comes
[36:53] that's the time you're supposed to be
[36:56] happy because you are in the right side
[37:00] Satan will not try himself
[37:03] he always tried the opposite
[37:07] Hallelujah glory amen
[37:13] you are not just a believer
[37:17] but let me tell you
[37:21] there is no other way
[37:23] you gonna ask God something that you
[37:27] will not give your help you
[37:30] but sometimes we anticipate ourselves
[37:34] you need something
[37:38] you have to ask
[37:40] you say ask
[37:42] and you shall receive
[37:46] help come from who God
[37:52] my your help doesn't come from me
[37:56] God can be God can tell me or inspire me
[38:00] to do something
[38:02] it doesn't mean that I am the one doing
[38:04] it it's God he's reaching Mercy Inspire
[38:08] somebody to help you
[38:11] it's not that person is
[38:14] try to help you
[38:16] Hallelujah
[38:19] this man cries so hard
[38:24] but all that
[38:27] God asked him what can I do for you
[38:31] how can I help you
[38:33] you know there's so many scriptures
[38:35] about help
[38:39] you can get you can get this to Matthew
[38:42] Hebrew Matthew 15 25 Hebrew 4 16
[38:47] Corinthians 1 24 Philippians 4 4 13 John
[38:52] 14 12.
[38:54] and Psalms 1 24 8
[38:57] he said our our help
[39:01] is in the Lord
[39:03] our help is in the Lord
[39:07] Isaiah to whom
[39:10] were you free
[39:12] for help
[39:13] who
[39:15] we're gonna free for help
[39:18] God you got to go to God for help you
[39:22] have to ask him
[39:24] John 14 40 said ask
[39:29] and I will do it
[39:35] I will do it you want me to read I'm
[39:41] gonna read for you
[39:43] Hallelujah
[39:52] thank you Lord blessed be the name of
[39:55] the Lord
[39:55] our lord is good
[40:02] amen
[40:16] he said
[40:18] John 14 14
[40:20] if you shall ask anything
[40:24] you didn't put in it
[40:26] any any Grudge is nothing there he said
[40:30] what he said anything
[40:34] in my name
[40:37] I will do it
[40:43] I will do it
[40:49] so why we have to be
[40:53] why we have to be sad
[40:56] the god that dwell in you said anything
[40:59] that you ask we as brother Christopher
[41:02] we are his wife
[41:06] can you let down your wife
[41:10] if you love your wife
[41:14] we are human we can make mistakes but
[41:16] God does not make mistake
[41:19] God take a virgin he took a virgin wife

[42:49] looked at 132.
[42:59] oh
[43:04] does it look
[43:06] s
[43:08] I think I'm I'm busy that
[43:10] the Bible said
[43:13] he told Peter well you know how long
[43:17] Peter was with the Lord Jesus Christ
[43:22] he was with him for a long time
[43:27] but one day
[43:32] when
[43:36] something happened
[43:42] and then the Lord Jesus Christ turned
[43:45] around said Peter
[43:46] where you converted
[43:49] he was could you imagine he was telling
[43:52] Peter when Peter converted and he was
[43:54] with him he sent him out
[43:57] to cast demons and everything
[43:59] but I was still not converted
[44:04] you know
[44:07] we are going home
[44:10] you can sit on the pill
[44:15] I hear the sermon every day every day
[44:17] every day every day but you don't open
[44:20] your heart to Res let the sermon go
[44:22] inside there
[44:27] and you know when I was going to Africa
[44:30] I have to have a ticket
[44:34] if I don't have a ticket that brought
[44:37] straight down to Africa and I go to the
[44:40] plane
[44:42] to the counter I cannot go in
[44:46] you have to have that ticket
[44:49] God brought you here
[44:52] for giving you a promise you engrave in
[44:54] the hand
[44:56] you can sit on the pill
[44:58] without doing nothing
[45:00] growing yourself
[45:03] day in day out you can sit down here
[45:05] without growing
[45:08] Peter was there but he was not converted
[45:10] he was in the church
[45:12] but was not converted
[45:17] you can be baptized but you need the
[45:20] infilling of the Holy Ghost and that's
[45:22] your earnest hope that you take it to
[45:25] heaven
[45:26] that's a very very very important in our
[45:29] life
[45:30] God has given to you
[45:33] when I put it because now we are not
[45:37] children Paul said there's time for milk
[45:39] there's time for meat
[45:44] the minister Minister he cannot shovel
[45:47] that thing in your soul
[45:49] you have to swallow it
[45:51] and astute
[45:53] you go home you sit down
[45:56] meditate the word of God that's your
[45:59] growth
[46:01] that's where you can know a time to ask
[46:07] and when you ask you know the way you
[46:10] have to ask so that you can receive it
[46:14] this man when you ask
[46:18] the Lord Jesus Christ called him
[46:21] and he asked him what can I do for you
[46:25] said that I might receive my sight
[46:28] immediately what happened he received
[46:31] his sight
[46:34] whether you are sick
[46:38] the Holy Ghost is very very crucial in
[46:41] your Christian work don't play with it
[46:47] everybody
[46:49] is taking in right now we are going
[46:52] everybody is taking in
[46:54] everybody's taking in Everybody Take it
[46:57] in everybody take it you're gonna reach
[47:00] a Time
[47:01] whatever you're taking you're gonna
[47:03] bring back that's where you go you're
[47:06] gonna know when God speak you can hear
[47:10] when God speak to me I have a way to
[47:13] hear you you have to have a way to hear
[47:17] how are you going to hear the voice of
[47:20] God
[47:21] by tuning your ears into his word
[47:26] that is feeding you
[47:30] so this is very very very important

[1:26:27] hmm
[1:26:29] just give me one minute
[1:26:45] okay this is Brian back to me as
[1:26:49] 1955 in Germany so one night
[1:26:54] they said to his little girl
[1:26:57] this is talking about he said he had it
[1:27:00] you read it
[1:27:02] got sick and he went out and prayed he
[1:27:06] said God if you let my little girl live
[1:27:10] tomorrow I will offer you my doves so
[1:27:13] his little girl got better
[1:27:17] he offered his dove
[1:27:19] then he had nothing to he had nothing to
[1:27:23] attract the attention
[1:27:26] not long after that he got his wife got
[1:27:29] sick and in these days a blind man is
[1:27:33] led by a dog
[1:27:36] in this day the Blind Man Lies by dog
[1:27:38] but you know what I mean how how the dog
[1:27:42] lets the brown man
[1:27:44] in them in them days a lamb leads the
[1:27:48] blind
[1:27:49] and this brand
[1:27:50] was led by a lamb and he said Lord if
[1:27:54] you would let my wife get well I will
[1:27:57] give you my alarm
[1:28:00] that's all I have so the next day
[1:28:04] why his wife got well
[1:28:07] he started up to the temple and to offer
[1:28:11] up the lambs Kaya first the High Praise
[1:28:16] and he walked out and his
[1:28:19] work out and he seen blind but much he
[1:28:24] said oh blood back to my eyes
[1:28:26] well goes down he said I'm going oh High
[1:28:30] Praise to offer my lamp that I promised
[1:28:33] God for healing my wife
[1:28:37] and so he said blind batamas you cannot
[1:28:40] offer the lamb he said here I will give
[1:28:44] you some money
[1:28:46] and you go by a lamb to offer he said no
[1:28:49] I promise God this lamb oh if we do only
[1:28:55] do that keep our promise to God
[1:28:58] you see
[1:28:59] so if God
[1:29:02] you ask God
[1:29:06] this man
[1:29:08] the only thing that he has that he can
[1:29:11] go out
[1:29:12] is
[1:29:14] that lamb that lead him so that he can
[1:29:18] step down like this
[1:29:22] like this
[1:29:23] now
[1:29:25] he promised God
[1:29:27] and he never fail God
[1:29:30] he gave
[1:29:32] that
[1:29:33] lamb and offer
[1:29:36] to God
[1:29:38] if you ask God
[1:29:41] and some people sometimes
[1:29:44] when they ask God God gave to them
[1:29:47] for them to even to give offering
[1:29:50] the wavering the memory
[1:29:53] they cannot even give offering the only
[1:29:56] lamb that he has that he can
[1:29:59] take him he offered to that you know
[1:30:01] what got it
[1:30:03] God help him and open his eye Daddy
[1:30:08] see after that
[1:30:11] he didn't have no alarm
[1:30:13] to lead him so the children have to lead
[1:30:16] him and set him over there and begging
[1:30:20] and when the Lord Jesus Christ passing
[1:30:22] by he remembered him
[1:30:25] you see that
[1:30:27] so
[1:30:28] so when you do something and you promise
[1:30:31] God that this and that do not fail your
[1:30:35] promise God remember the same way you
[1:30:38] remember to ask him
[1:30:40] you understand
