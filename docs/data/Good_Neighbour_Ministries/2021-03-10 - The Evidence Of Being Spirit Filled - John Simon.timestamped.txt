[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] hello friends
[0:16] here we are again another
[0:20] wednesday evening in which to
[0:24] study the word of god to feed upon it
[0:28] and to grow in his marvelous grace
[0:33] may the lord jesus bless us together
[0:36] as we come with rejoicing
[0:39] and faith in the presence of the living
[0:42] god
[0:44] oh praise his name my scripture is
[0:48] found in revelation chapter 2
[0:52] verse 17. the first part of the verse
[0:58] he that had an ear to
[1:02] hear let him hear what
[1:05] the spirit saith
[1:08] to the churches amen
[1:13] my topic for today will be
[1:17] the evidence of being
[1:21] spirit-filled
[1:24] i would like for us to dive into this
[1:29] because there are so many versions
[1:33] and ideas and thoughts and the main
[1:36] thought that has been promoted or
[1:40] given to people
[1:44] denominations have been founded
[1:47] and based their origins
[1:50] upon this flawed
[1:54] or false evidence of the baptism of the
[1:58] holy spirit
[2:01] and thus it requires the uh
[2:04] the correction of the word of god
[2:08] for the word of god the revealed word of
[2:12] god
[2:12] by the holy spirit corrects the
[2:16] era within the framework
[2:20] of the church of god
[2:24] realize that john the baptist
[2:27] while here upon the earth that he
[2:30] was bought prophet to the people of
[2:34] israel
[2:35] and he was also the messenger
[2:38] of god to his day and time
[2:43] his history we are aware of for the
[2:47] bible tells us he was
[2:49] filled with the holy spirit
[2:52] at the time of his birth
[2:56] in his mother's womb he was filled with
[2:59] the spirit of god
[3:01] hallelujah amen how wonderful to know
[3:04] we don't even have to be actually
[3:08] born and a human walking around to be
[3:11] filled with the holy spirit
[3:14] but it's a predestinated gift of the
[3:17] living god
[3:18] that floods and fills the heart of the
[3:21] believer
[3:22] knowing that gifts and callings from god
[3:26] are without or before
[3:30] repentance now
[3:33] we realize that when he
[3:36] was baptizing in
[3:39] the jordan river
[3:43] the word of god jesus christ
[3:47] came to the prophet john the baptist
[3:52] the word came to the prophet
[3:57] for this prophet was foreordained
[4:01] or predestinated prophesied
[4:06] to be the voice of one crying in the
[4:09] wilderness
[4:10] he would be the one to announce jesus
[4:13] the word
[4:14] to herald the coming of the word
[4:17] to identify the word of god
[4:20] and to make clear to the people
[4:23] that the prophet was on earth therefore
[4:27] the word
[4:28] had to be on earth for the prophet to be
[4:31] able to announce it
[4:32] identify it to the people
[4:36] so the word john being
[4:39] predestinated prophesied
[4:42] to be the the herald the messenger
[4:46] of the word then the word could go to
[4:51] no one else the
[4:54] word had to pass john's way
[4:58] the word of god had to come to
[5:02] john so that it could identify
[5:06] john and john could identify that word
[5:10] that behold the lamb of
[5:14] god that taketh away the sins of the
[5:16] world
[5:18] behold the bloody lamb
[5:22] amen that takes
[5:26] the book and breaks the seals thereof
[5:30] behold the open word now to reveal
[5:34] himself to you
[5:36] of who he is hallelujah
[5:40] the evidence of john being
[5:43] filled with the spirit
[5:47] is that the word jesus christ
[5:51] came to him john
[5:55] from which we take this
[5:58] principle which i have used as a sermon
[6:01] topic
[6:03] that the word always comes to the
[6:08] predestinated
[6:09] vessels of the day or that hour
[6:14] in this day it's not one man
[6:19] in this day it's a bride
[6:22] church a many member
[6:26] body of jesus christ
[6:30] and so they who were in god's mind
[6:34] who were in his thoughts who
[6:37] are his beloved oh
[6:41] praise god it's to
[6:44] them that the word comes hence
[6:48] my scripture that we just read
[6:51] he that had an
[6:54] ear to hear let him hear
[6:58] praise god so the word comes to
[7:02] someone who has already been
[7:05] prophesied predestinating and given
[7:08] a supernatural crystal a supernatural
[7:12] ear a supernatural heart
[7:16] to receive the word of god
[7:19] for their day when that word
[7:22] comes and when the word does
[7:26] come to the age
[7:30] to that particular day or time
[7:34] the word can go nowhere else but to that
[7:38] or those predestinated
[7:41] vessels that were a time prepared before
[7:45] the foundations
[7:46] of the world for this hour when
[7:49] this message of this messenger
[7:53] this prophet of this 20th century
[7:57] sent by god for this day and hour
[8:01] that the word of god would first go to
[8:03] him
[8:05] then the word of god would flow out
[8:08] and it has to pass your way it
[8:12] must come to the predestinated vessel
[8:16] that already has that
[8:19] attribute that gene of god that air
[8:22] of god to be able to receive the word of
[8:27] god
[8:28] hallelujah how wonderful to know i am a
[8:31] receptor
[8:33] how good to know that i'm a prepared
[8:36] vessel
[8:37] you are a prepared vessel how wonderful
[8:40] to know
[8:41] that we are redeemed washed cleansed by
[8:45] the blood of god
[8:47] for his use for in the house of god are
[8:50] vessels of every kind but for us
[8:53] we are reserved for his divine purpose
[8:56] and for his glory oh
[8:58] thanks be to god the
[9:01] evidence a repeat of john
[9:05] the baptist being spirit-filled
[9:10] is that the word came to him
[9:15] and the genuine true evidence
[9:19] of you or i or anyone else
[9:23] being truly spirit-filled
[9:27] is that the word of god will come
[9:31] to you that is not john simon
[9:35] saying that that is the evidence
[9:38] jesus christ himself said that was the
[9:41] evidence
[9:42] listen and
[9:46] i will pray
[9:50] the father that he will send you
[9:54] another comforter that he may abide with
[9:58] you
[9:59] forever even the spirit of truth
[10:05] when the world can whom the world cannot
[10:08] cannot receive
[10:12] now we know what what the truth is of
[10:15] course
[10:15] we know what the truth is we do not yet
[10:19] understand jesus speaking
[10:22] why do you not understand my speech
[10:26] listen to his reasons even because
[10:31] you cannot hear my word
[10:35] amen see the world could not receive
[10:39] what he was saying they can hear it with
[10:41] their outer ears
[10:43] but they got angry when they heard it
[10:46] because uh
[10:47] they don't understand it it doesn't
[10:49] reveal to them
[10:51] they did not come here with an ear
[10:54] to hear a spiritual ear
[10:58] to hear the word of god for their
[11:01] day amen the world couldn't receive it
[11:06] and neither could the world receive the
[11:07] holy ghost
[11:09] amen neither could they receive the word
[11:12] for the holy ghost the holy spirit and
[11:15] the word
[11:16] is one and the same praise god
[11:19] the written word on the pages of the
[11:21] bible is resurrected or brought back to
[11:24] life
[11:25] by the holy spirit activity
[11:28] in the life mind and heart of the true
[11:31] believer
[11:33] praise god other than that it just stays
[11:36] in the tomb
[11:37] it just stays here and it's just the
[11:40] written
[11:40] word praise god no human understanding
[11:44] no will of man not by the works of man
[11:49] can produce not by the studied
[11:52] intellectuality
[11:53] the wisdom of satan or the wisdom of man
[11:56] no matter how holy how good the
[11:58] intention
[12:00] it can not reveal the word of god
[12:03] it may expose expose exposition
[12:07] it may give topical it may get give
[12:10] exegetical it may give
[12:12] all manner of parts of the word but my
[12:15] brothers and sisters
[12:16] it cannot truly reveal the word of god
[12:21] it's the holy spirit himself that
[12:24] reveals
[12:25] the word of the living god
[12:28] listen to the lord jesus but
[12:33] amen just as the holy spirit came to the
[12:36] prophets the word of god comes to you
[12:39] john 14 26 but the comforter
[12:42] which is the holy ghost whom the father
[12:45] will send in my name
[12:48] he not the bible school he
[12:51] not the seminary he not the monastery
[12:55] he not the convent none of these
[12:59] illustrious places of learning and we
[13:02] need
[13:03] human natural learning so i'm not
[13:05] putting that down
[13:06] i'm saying you need that but we are not
[13:09] here to
[13:10] put that first uh be here to put
[13:14] the word of god and the revelation of
[13:16] the word of god
[13:17] first amen so so the holy
[13:21] spirit reveals the word
[13:24] to the true believer he shall teach you
[13:28] all things
[13:29] and bring to your remembrance he'll give
[13:32] you a good memory
[13:33] by bringing to your remembrance
[13:36] whatsoever i have said unto you
[13:40] amen hebrews 14 12 of course tells you
[13:42] the word of god is quicker and sharper
[13:44] than the two edged sword
[13:46] that's what the activity of the holy
[13:48] spirit does
[13:49] in the heart mind of the true believer
[13:53] of the living god amen john 16
[13:56] 13 how be it when he the spirit of truth
[13:59] the of amen the spirit of the word
[14:03] is come he shall not speak
[14:06] of himself but whatsoever he shall
[14:09] hear amen praise god
[14:12] that shall he speak amen he will speak
[14:16] the word
[14:17] and he will show you things to come
[14:20] praise god in other words he'll anoint
[14:23] you with a spirit of prophecy you don't
[14:25] have to think about it ask for it once
[14:28] the true
[14:28] spirit of god is in your heart your life
[14:31] your mind
[14:32] he will show you things to come
[14:36] he will speak things out of you and
[14:38] through you
[14:39] that are prophetic anointed by the holy
[14:42] spirit
[14:43] oh praise his marvelous name that we can
[14:46] be
[14:47] numbered among those written in this
[14:50] bible that we are a part of that few
[14:54] a part of this elected people
[14:57] the all one by one regain the portals
[15:02] oh glory to his name the great holy
[15:05] spirit of the living god unveiling the
[15:08] word of god
[15:09] amen jesus did not say
[15:14] that the evidence of being baptized with
[15:17] the holy spirit
[15:18] was speaking in tongues let me repeat
[15:23] jesus has never said anywhere
[15:27] in the world that the evidence
[15:30] of receiving the holy spirit
[15:35] is speaking in tongues
[15:38] or any manifestation
[15:42] of the holy spirit of amen
[15:45] not interpretations
[15:49] not the not uh any kinds
[15:52] of of prophesying
[15:55] not shouting not dancing in the spirit
[15:58] none of these things are evidence
[16:03] of receiving the spirit
[16:06] or being spirit-filled
[16:10] matter of fact jesus said the evidence
[16:14] of being spirit-filled or receiving the
[16:17] holy ghost
[16:19] is to be in the truth
[16:24] to be in the word of god
[16:27] for your age the evidence
[16:31] has to do with receiving the word
[16:37] and the word coming to you
[16:40] makes you know that you
[16:43] have the spirit you have the seed of god
[16:47] the life of god the gene the attribute
[16:49] god
[16:50] lives in you first corinthians
[16:54] 14 37 if any man think of himself a
[16:58] prophet or spiritual
[17:00] let him acknowledge the things i write
[17:02] unto you
[17:03] are the commandments of the lord
[17:07] praise god now the see
[17:10] right there we see the proof of the
[17:13] indwelling of the holy spirit
[17:16] was your reaction to the word how do you
[17:20] react when you hear
[17:21] the truth of the word does it get you
[17:24] mad
[17:24] that you sad get you furious like the
[17:28] sadducees or the pharisees
[17:31] does it rile you get you all upset
[17:35] oh my friend see the the
[17:38] very evidence
[17:42] and proof of the spirit indwelling your
[17:46] heart indwelling you
[17:49] is to acknowledge my friends
[17:52] and follow what god's prophet
[17:56] has brought to us to the age
[18:00] hallelujah in the same way paul
[18:04] speaking came the word of god out from
[18:07] you
[18:08] or came it unto you only
[18:12] praise god see that is why
[18:15] we are preaching a christianity
[18:18] but from a different point of view
[18:22] for as i've taught before and as taught
[18:25] by the prophet of god
[18:28] real believers and true christians are
[18:31] not here to
[18:32] produce the life of christ
[18:37] we don't try to work our work
[18:41] ourselves to try to approximate
[18:45] uh measure ourselves against jesus
[18:49] and try to produce that kind
[18:52] of a life we don't do that hallelujah
[18:56] we try to receive the word for the day
[19:01] and that reveals to us that that
[19:04] life is already in us and now
[19:09] we are going to surrender to him
[19:12] and allow that life that word
[19:16] to make himself manifest
[19:20] what am i saying true christianity
[19:24] it's not you or i or anyone
[19:29] getting us bible study or a textbook
[19:31] showing you
[19:32] these are the qualities of the life of
[19:34] christ these are the qualities you're
[19:35] supposed to have
[19:36] that's marvelous that's wonderful
[19:38] description
[19:40] but the fact is you are to literally
[19:43] have that life in you
[19:47] then he begins to live his
[19:50] own life in and through you
[19:55] hence we say god
[19:59] is his own interpreter
[20:02] and he will make it plain
[20:06] glory to his marvelous name
[20:09] revelation chapter 22 verse 17
[20:13] and the spirit and the bride
[20:17] say come hallelujah let
[20:20] him that hear it say come
[20:24] see the spirits has come the bride says
[20:27] come
[20:28] and he that can hear or hears that word
[20:31] says come because he's going to be soon
[20:34] added into that bride
[20:36] amen praise the lord they all only go
[20:40] by hearing of the word the same spirit
[20:44] the same the holy spirit can only speak
[20:47] the truth
[20:48] of the word and the bride can only speak
[20:53] the truth of the word so automatically
[20:56] she is
[20:57] saying what the spirit is saying and he
[21:00] that hear it
[21:02] anyone that has that spiritual ear
[21:05] that supernatural ear that i am talking
[21:08] about
[21:10] he or she will also
[21:13] say what the spirit is saying for they
[21:16] can see
[21:16] nothing else but what is in
[21:20] the revealed word of the hour and that
[21:24] will
[21:24] that proves that the real bride
[21:27] has to be the world bride
[21:31] she has to be for she will find that she
[21:34] is a part of that word
[21:37] herself no wonder to every church age
[21:42] the lord has said
[21:44] he that had an ear to hear
[21:47] let him hear what the spirit said
[21:51] unto the churches or i will
[21:54] place my parentheses here uh
[21:58] or church ages what the spirit is saying
[22:01] to the churches or to all the church
[22:04] ages for the spirit of god gives the
[22:08] word
[22:10] and if you are if you have the spirit
[22:15] if you are predestinated
[22:18] with the life the seed of god in you
[22:21] hallelujah then you will
[22:24] automatically without trying without
[22:26] going
[22:27] to a long five-year study uh
[22:30] without the i did only three years
[22:34] but that doesn't didn't mean a thing
[22:36] when i came to the end of it
[22:38] i realized that's not what it is it was
[22:41] helpful
[22:42] it was very uh pointed it was
[22:46] wonderful for human knowledge but my
[22:49] friends
[22:51] it's the spirit of god's god's gift to
[22:55] you
[22:55] in you that can hear the word of
[22:59] god for your age just as the other
[23:03] christians in the early
[23:05] ages of the church heard the word
[23:09] and they were added onto the church 3
[23:12] 000 people in one day oh glory to god
[23:16] that's when the spirit's
[23:18] activity is working amongst the people
[23:22] they keep growing they keep multiplying
[23:24] they keep being anointed
[23:27] and the people around them start
[23:29] wondering what's happening what's going
[23:31] on
[23:31] it's god in action it's another book of
[23:34] acts hallelujah
[23:36] it's the great holy spirit of the living
[23:39] god
[23:40] working his divine will the way he
[23:42] should work it
[23:43] not depending on human education
[23:46] ecclesiasticism
[23:47] uh oh my intellectualism
[23:50] all these various things but relying on
[23:54] the
[23:54] word living word of the living god
[23:58] working through a people in these last
[24:01] days and
[24:01] every day from the beginning of the
[24:04] church
[24:05] right to this hour and to this time i
[24:07] want to thank god
[24:11] that we have been restored back to the
[24:14] faith of our fathers
[24:15] by the opening of the word of god and i
[24:18] am a partaker of it
[24:20] praise the living god hallelujah i
[24:22] believe it with all my heart glory
[24:25] god you know when i was just 18
[24:28] uh years old and they're
[24:31] in their bible college and
[24:34] began to ask questions like jesus
[24:37] of mary and speaking like that after a
[24:40] while they
[24:42] they uh dean just
[24:45] they they just couldn't take it anymore
[24:49] it was too much and it was the fact is
[24:53] i was bringing it from the word and they
[24:55] could not
[24:56] answer they could not give a a reply to
[24:59] it
[25:00] and it's best to uh you know put him to
[25:03] push him to the back or to the side and
[25:05] not listen to that type of talk amen
[25:08] but brother sister that's what the
[25:11] spirit of god will do
[25:12] even to a child that's what the spirit
[25:14] of god will do to a
[25:16] a a girl to a a young man to a woman
[25:21] to a man to oh glory to god
[25:24] and nobody take the nobody god
[25:27] gets into the nobody and make him or her
[25:30] or somebody oh praise god hallelujah
[25:34] when the holy spirit takes control of a
[25:37] life
[25:38] it's not you now it's him they're still
[25:41] seeing you
[25:42] but they don't realize who is in you for
[25:44] jesus said
[25:45] it's not me you're looking at me but
[25:48] when you see me
[25:49] it's the father that liveth in me he
[25:52] doeth the work so glory to god
[25:54] hallelujah amen praise
[25:58] god amen he that had an ear to hear
[26:02] he notice god is trying to show you
[26:05] it has to come individually
[26:08] not the church that hears the word not
[26:11] the organization that hears the word
[26:14] and think they have it all collected and
[26:17] they can give it all to you and oh no
[26:19] but he that hear it amen
[26:22] he that has an ear to hear what the
[26:25] spirit is saying so the spirit
[26:27] is the one that gets the word amen
[26:30] hallelujah the spirit gives the word for
[26:34] he has the word of truth
[26:36] for every age and each age
[26:40] has its own elect every age has its
[26:44] elect of the age
[26:46] you might have a church world but out of
[26:48] that church world
[26:49] god calls out his elect little eagles
[26:53] praise god his elect children they come
[26:57] out of egypt they come out of the world
[27:00] and
[27:00] out of those that came out of egypt god
[27:03] calls
[27:03] out a small group joshua and caleb and
[27:07] the rest
[27:08] holy as there were jews as they were
[27:11] that died in the wilderness praise god
[27:14] while this small few entered over
[27:18] into the promised land of the revealed
[27:21] word of god hallelujah
[27:23] glory to god amen yes sir
[27:27] that the elect of god in each age
[27:30] always hears the word
[27:34] of god and by receiving the word of god
[27:39] for their
[27:39] age they're proving
[27:43] that they had to have had or they have
[27:47] this seed of god within them
[27:50] glory to god hallelujah see
[27:54] they have the seed of god within
[27:58] their heart glory to god amen
[28:01] so here we see from the scriptures he
[28:04] that is of god hear it
[28:08] god's word so if you're of god you'll
[28:10] hear god's word
[28:12] if you are not of god you get angry
[28:15] you get mad you you you call the word
[28:18] the
[28:19] word jesus you're up the elizabeth you
[28:21] call him
[28:22] oh you're joseph's son
[28:26] in other words you you weren't born
[28:27] supernaturally
[28:29] they called him all manner names
[28:32] and back then it was the pharisees
[28:36] today it's these modern church people
[28:39] they're religious the pharisees were
[28:41] religious they were scholars
[28:43] they knew more uh than most people today
[28:47] and yet they told the word jesus
[28:51] he was of the devil and he turns around
[28:54] said uh if they did this to me who am
[28:57] the word
[28:58] what will they do to you who are just
[29:02] i am your lord what are they going to do
[29:04] to you would they not also persecute you
[29:06] try you
[29:07] call you all men renames but blessed are
[29:10] you
[29:10] when they revile you persecute you
[29:13] and see all manner of evil and things
[29:16] against you
[29:18] for what because you took my name
[29:21] for and make it a prominent thing for my
[29:24] name's sake
[29:25] you took my name hallelujah and you
[29:28] suffer from my name
[29:29] you get rejected from my name you get
[29:32] reviled for my name
[29:33] you called all mineral names for me but
[29:36] you're stood
[29:37] you're holding god's unchanging hand you
[29:40] hold on to the word of the living god
[29:42] amen here i stand like luther so
[29:46] help me god praise god amen
[29:49] you hold to the word of god
[29:52] he says you he that is of god
[29:55] hearers of god's word
[30:00] you therefore hear them not
[30:04] because you are not of god
[30:07] he turned to the fascism sadducees is
[30:09] good you were religious you give your
[30:11] tithes you
[30:12] you support your so-called church your
[30:14] synagogue
[30:15] and you go every day and you do those
[30:17] things
[30:18] great wonderful marvelous he says but
[30:21] you
[30:22] are of your father the devil
[30:25] for thousands of years before
[30:28] abraham had this ear he had this
[30:31] eye this heart abraham rejoiced
[30:36] to see my day and he was glad
[30:41] but here you claim your abraham's
[30:43] children
[30:44] you're standing before the very living
[30:47] word
[30:48] jesus christ and you call it a
[30:51] devil you call him a cult you
[30:55] called him whatever you want to call him
[30:58] and call him all men renames and you
[31:02] can't even see what you're doing or who
[31:05] it is
[31:05] in his people like paul the
[31:08] god jesus christ was in the people and
[31:11] paul was
[31:12] slaughtering them until the lord
[31:14] appeared and said
[31:15] paul saul saul why persecutors
[31:19] thou mean for it was
[31:22] god living in his people
[31:26] the word that was dead on the pages of
[31:29] the bible
[31:30] had come back now and gone into the
[31:33] people's hearts
[31:35] and now the living word in them was
[31:37] making itself
[31:38] manifested and the rest of them
[31:42] were exposed they couldn't stand it amen
[31:47] my listen
[31:50] they refuse the word
[31:55] but the true seed of god for that hour
[31:58] receive the word of god because they
[32:01] were of god
[32:02] and the bible already said all thy
[32:04] children
[32:05] shall be taught not of men but they
[32:09] shall be
[32:09] taught of god
[32:13] amen isaiah 54 13
[32:16] john 6 verse 45
[32:20] amen amen
[32:23] being one with the word
[32:27] proves whether you are of god
[32:30] and whether you are spirit-filled
[32:34] or not or whether you are filled with
[32:37] some other
[32:38] other thing amen but
[32:42] to show you a spirit filled you will
[32:45] agree with every word of god i've seen
[32:48] so many people
[32:49] claim they're filled with the spirit
[32:51] then when you take the word of god you
[32:53] begin to show them
[32:54] they get to a spot where this they for a
[32:56] brief moment they recognize what where
[32:58] you're going and what you're saying
[33:00] and that they're they're caught in the
[33:03] middle of something
[33:04] and oh i don't believe that that what
[33:06] what is it that you don't believe
[33:08] see see they're they're caught in it and
[33:11] they back away they want to run
[33:12] why because that spirit
[33:16] or devil it could be just a natural
[33:18] human spirit
[33:19] or the devil when he sees his trap like
[33:22] that he just
[33:23] wants to run and get away from it
[33:26] lest the word of god the shark two edges
[33:28] of the sword of the word of god
[33:30] begins to cut and slash because
[33:34] one some people refuse the word
[33:37] while others receive the word with joy
[33:41] within their hearts and lies glory to
[33:44] god
[33:44] amen amen but what are
[33:48] interpretation tongues
[33:53] supernatural interpretation
[33:56] of tongues and the other gifts
[34:01] what are they my friends all they
[34:05] are are manifestations
[34:09] of the holy spirit
[34:14] first corinthians 12 7 but the
[34:17] manifestation of the spirit is given to
[34:21] every man to profit
[34:24] where without and then paul goes on to
[34:27] name
[34:28] all the various manifestations
[34:31] praise god see a lot of people major in
[34:35] in getting manifestations rather having
[34:38] major manifestations are all right
[34:41] that's wonderful
[34:42] but that's not being spirit-filled
[34:46] that doesn't prove anything about being
[34:48] spirit-filled
[34:49] see and they want a major in being able
[34:53] to have
[34:53] manifestations in their meetings rather
[34:56] than having
[34:57] revelation of the word making itself
[35:00] manifested
[35:01] within the hearts and lives of the
[35:04] people
[35:04] amen praise god now you say brother
[35:08] simon
[35:09] why isn't manifestation the evidence
[35:13] of being baptized with the holy ghost
[35:17] surely you can't manifest i mean the
[35:20] holy ghost unless
[35:22] uh you were spirit filled
[35:25] but that's not right my friends that's
[35:27] completely
[35:28] wrong one has to think that way
[35:32] and let me give you some scriptural
[35:34] examples
[35:35] of those who produce manifestations
[35:38] of the genuine holy spirit
[35:42] but were not spirit-filled
[35:45] first of all there is balaam he was
[35:48] not a true seed prophet and
[35:52] he was religious he knew all the
[35:55] sacrifices
[35:57] he knew my friends all those things
[36:01] but yet he took the wages of uh
[36:04] unrighteousness some denomination some
[36:07] unrighteousness
[36:08] wages from the king of moab at that
[36:11] particular time in our day
[36:13] he's taking the wages of
[36:14] denominationalism or
[36:16] wherever he can find uh that position
[36:20] amen so he was not a true seed prophet
[36:24] and he even led the people of god into
[36:27] sin
[36:28] and into fornication and into
[36:31] idolatry but
[36:34] who could deny the spirit of god did
[36:36] manifest through him
[36:37] for he was the one that said that god
[36:40] would send a star out of jesse
[36:42] amen praise god god
[36:45] flashed through him and he prophesied
[36:49] but yet he was not filled with god's
[36:53] spirit
[36:54] then there is cahyphus who prophesied
[36:57] what kind of a
[36:58] death the lord jesus would die alone
[37:03] and there is no record in the bible
[37:05] where he is known to be asked
[37:07] to have been spirit filled yet the bible
[37:10] tells us he
[37:12] prophesied jesus death so prophecy
[37:16] interpretation tongues all these
[37:18] marvelous wonderful gifts
[37:20] are only manifestations of the holy
[37:24] spirit
[37:25] but it is not the revelation of the word
[37:29] neither does it give anybody the
[37:31] authority
[37:32] for revealing the word the only shown
[37:36] ability
[37:37] to produce the manifestations of the
[37:40] holy spirit
[37:42] we also find another group jesus himself
[37:47] had many disciples and he sent them out
[37:51] and they were empowered by the holy
[37:55] spirit
[37:56] but yet they had not gone to acts
[37:58] chapter 2
[37:59] in the upper room they did not they were
[38:02] not spirit
[38:03] filled or filled with the spirit
[38:06] and so here they were and they went out
[38:09] the bible tells us
[38:10] i believe it's in luke chapter 10 verses
[38:13] 17
[38:14] to 21 how that their return with
[38:18] joy in their hearts saying lord
[38:22] oh lord even the spirits
[38:25] are made subject the devils obey us
[38:29] and come out of the people we cast out
[38:32] devils we
[38:32] lay hands on the sick the people were
[38:35] healed and
[38:36] all manner of miracles were taking place
[38:39] we had a real
[38:41] big massive revival meeting and the
[38:44] spirit of god was moving
[38:46] amen oh my
[38:49] and so jesus told them that's marvelous
[38:53] what you should rejoice is whether your
[38:56] name is
[38:57] written in heaven in other words what
[38:58] you should rejoice
[39:00] is if you have a revelation that your
[39:03] name
[39:03] is on the page white and fear in the
[39:06] mind of god
[39:07] before the foundation of the world
[39:10] that's where your real rejoicing
[39:12] ought to be those signs always
[39:16] follow the genuine believer
[39:19] the believer doesn't have to try to
[39:21] produce anything
[39:23] manufacture anything make up anything
[39:26] they rely
[39:27] upon the great holy spirit a further
[39:30] thought about this
[39:32] for manifestations are not the evidence
[39:34] of being
[39:35] spirit filled when those disciples went
[39:40] out
[39:41] the bible tells us judas was amongst
[39:44] them
[39:46] judas son of perdition
[39:49] son of the devil the bible is telling
[39:52] you that he was a
[39:53] son of the devil oh
[39:56] a child of hell and he went
[40:00] out and he came back rejoicing
[40:03] the sick were healed devils were cast
[40:05] out miracles take place
[40:07] but that was no evidence
[40:11] that he was spirit filled
[40:15] oh my the bible tells us
[40:19] in the book of romans chapter 10 verses
[40:22] 28 and 29
[40:24] gifts and calling of god are without
[40:28] repentance
[40:32] now my friends
[40:35] gifts of god are in you before
[40:38] you even became a christian
[40:42] when i was a child
[40:45] i had this strange thing about me where
[40:48] i would dream
[40:49] things i would see things
[40:53] i i wouldn't know where certain things
[40:57] are and how i
[41:00] how i would know i didn't know but i
[41:04] surely
[41:06] as i was given that knowledge
[41:09] i would be able to prove it but thanks
[41:12] me the god
[41:13] gifts and callings of god are without
[41:16] repentance i'm saying this
[41:17] so that you may look back on your own
[41:20] life your own heart your own mind
[41:22] and you may find that god is not just
[41:26] now working in your life he made you
[41:29] aware
[41:30] he's now made you come to your senses to
[41:33] recognize
[41:34] his activity within your heart and life
[41:37] what is
[41:37] christ in you working god working in you
[41:41] his will
[41:42] and his divine purpose amen
[41:46] now many years ago brother brennan went
[41:48] to a pentecostal meeting and two men
[41:50] were in those meetings both were
[41:52] speaking in towns both were shouting
[41:54] both was glorifying god
[41:57] and yet as you know he had this
[41:59] marvelous gift
[42:01] of discernment yet when he looked
[42:05] at both of them and spoke to both of
[42:07] them he could see that
[42:08] juan's heart was pure and he was living
[42:11] right while the
[42:12] other one was a hypocrite had his blonde
[42:14] hair wife
[42:15] and living with another woman and had
[42:19] three children by her hidden
[42:22] that the lawful wife knew nothing about
[42:28] what a shocking thing so brother branham
[42:32] began to pray and ask
[42:33] god what is this how could both claim to
[42:37] be spirit filled and one
[42:40] is literally a reprobate and the other
[42:43] one
[42:44] being truly righteous and so he prayed
[42:47] until
[42:48] god as you know gave him visions he
[42:51] broke into a vision
[42:53] and he was able to see how clear it was
[42:58] now he saw my friends a case where
[43:05] tears and wheat one sore
[43:08] dressed in white sowed some seeds
[43:12] that were wheat and another another
[43:16] sewer
[43:16] came after dressed in black and he sowed
[43:19] some seeds
[43:21] and those seeds were tears
[43:24] and then days went by then the sun and
[43:27] the rain came down
[43:29] both were blessed by both the rain and
[43:32] the sun
[43:34] so boat seats came up and when they came
[43:38] up
[43:39] of course the witch shout hallelujah
[43:41] praise
[43:42] god and thank god for the rain on the
[43:45] sunshine
[43:46] glory to god and begin to praise god
[43:49] brother branham said in my vision i was
[43:51] surprised
[43:52] when the wheat also that was dying from
[43:55] heat and thirst begin to say oh
[43:57] hallelujah praise god glory to god
[44:00] and glorify god also he said but there
[44:03] they were in the field
[44:05] mixed together wheat and tears and the
[44:08] tears shouting glory to god praise god
[44:11] and the weak
[44:12] also praising god how could you know the
[44:15] difference
[44:17] and there is the truth my friends
[44:20] of the real interpretation and
[44:23] understanding of the word of god the
[44:26] difference
[44:27] was that there were of different sea
[44:31] life they were of
[44:34] different seed life and this is what a
[44:37] lot of the people of the denominations
[44:41] don't understand the reign of the holy
[44:45] spirit does not come to put
[44:48] some new life into you the reign of the
[44:52] holy spirit
[44:54] brings out and reveals
[44:58] what seed life was already hidden
[45:02] in you before you were even born
[45:06] was in you but the rain came
[45:09] to force the germination of the seed
[45:13] that is
[45:13] in you oh you might be religious like
[45:16] cain was religious abel was religious
[45:18] but
[45:19] one was of god one of the devil this is
[45:21] the this is the mystery of the end time
[45:23] revival the twins of the end time
[45:25] revival
[45:26] and here you find the rain came the sun
[45:30] shines but it's every seed
[45:34] must bring forth after its kind
[45:38] and so the rain forced the life
[45:41] out of the seed and we see here my
[45:44] friends
[45:44] how that all happened so do you see the
[45:46] importance
[45:48] of the seed life of god i have the life
[45:52] of god in me the song writer said
[45:54] i have the life of god in me
[45:58] i have the life of god in me i have his
[46:01] fullness i have his life i have his
[46:04] authority
[46:05] for i have the life of god in me if i
[46:08] just say that anybody can say that
[46:11] but the life in you itself will prove
[46:13] whether it's in you or not
[46:16] amen listen matthew 7 21-23
[46:22] not everyone that say it unto me lord
[46:26] lord
[46:26] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
[46:29] this is what jesus
[46:30] is talking about both seeds are in the
[46:32] church
[46:33] both seeds are in the denomination and
[46:36] then the spirit
[46:37] crawls but only they that have an heir
[46:41] to hear
[46:42] amen but yet what can praise god
[46:45] butch and shout hallelujah book and clap
[46:48] your hands go out and enjoy the music
[46:51] but watch that life that is back there
[46:54] making itself manifest by receiving the
[46:58] word
[46:59] and then going and living and manifest
[47:02] in the word
[47:03] and standing by the word for it can do
[47:06] nothing else because the seed and the
[47:09] word
[47:10] are one the spirit and the word are
[47:14] one and all they with that see life in
[47:17] them
[47:18] make up the body of christ or we also
[47:20] call
[47:21] the bride of christ amen the lamb's wife
[47:25] oh praise god amen hallelujah
[47:29] jesus said not everyone that said unto
[47:32] me lord lord
[47:34] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
[47:38] but he that do at the will of my father
[47:41] which is in heaven
[47:44] many will say to me in that day lord
[47:47] lord
[47:48] have we not prophesied in thy name
[47:53] and in thy name have we not cast out
[47:57] devils have we made laid hands on the
[48:00] sick
[48:01] and the people recovered have we not
[48:04] done
[48:04] miracles in your name
[48:08] have we not done many wonderful works
[48:11] then will i profess or say
[48:15] to them i
[48:18] never knew you you were not
[48:22] in my mind you were not for
[48:26] known in the mind of god
[48:29] before the foundation of the world i
[48:33] never
[48:34] knew you depart from
[48:38] from me you worker of the devil
[48:42] you worker of iniquity
[48:45] jesus doesn't deny that that that mighty
[48:48] works
[48:50] but he does deny that the holy s
[48:53] ghost spirit filled them
[48:56] they were not filled with the spirit and
[48:59] yet they were doing mighty works
[49:01] and they were rejected by the lord jesus
[49:05] christ the word
[49:06] himself for they were wicked unsaved
[49:10] unregenerate religious but they were
[49:14] reprobates to the word of god and there
[49:16] were the seed of satan
[49:18] for that day and for that hour and we
[49:21] have our
[49:22] group of that in our day that we must
[49:24] face
[49:25] face to face in men and women like
[49:29] ourselves
[49:30] the spirit of god versus the spirit of
[49:32] satan
[49:33] working through these ones
[49:37] so we can no one can claim that the
[49:40] manifestation
[49:41] of the holy spirit is the evidence of
[49:44] being
[49:44] spirit filled amen it's just the
[49:47] evidence of the spirit doing mighty acts
[49:51] amen the individual can have an
[49:53] abundance of spiritual manifestation
[49:58] and haven't received the word and have a
[50:00] mighty name in the religious realm
[50:02] uh bible teacher apostle bishop
[50:05] priest pope whatever that name is they
[50:09] can have
[50:09] all of that with the mighty works of the
[50:11] mighty organization
[50:13] that is no proof of being spirit
[50:17] filled or having the gene
[50:21] seed of god within their hearts
[50:24] amen praise god glory to
[50:27] god amen so the evidence of receiving
[50:32] the holy ghost today is the same
[50:36] as it was in the days of jesus
[50:40] it was to receive his word the word of
[50:43] truth
[50:44] for your day into your heart
[50:47] by proving you have the air to hear
[50:51] spiritual supernatural ear to hear
[50:54] praise god and by hearing that
[50:57] word you live jesus never
[51:01] stressed the importance of works
[51:04] but he kept stressing the importance
[51:09] of hearing his word
[51:12] hearing his word he that heareth my word
[51:16] and believe it on him that
[51:17] and many many many if you go into the
[51:20] book of john luke matthew
[51:22] you'll find over and over again he
[51:24] stresses the importance
[51:26] of and a bit of the ability to hear his
[51:29] word
[51:29] for he was searching in his day for hit
[51:32] for the seed
[51:33] that he had to call out from the midst
[51:37] of that religious realm
[51:41] the worst thing the church ever did and
[51:43] i'm lining up now
[51:45] is a to drift away from the original
[51:50] word of god and this is why to the
[51:54] pergamos age
[51:55] he revealed himself as the living word
[52:00] for he was the word made manifest and
[52:04] they were seeing people
[52:05] doing all kinds of uh things that
[52:08] um witchcraft and other even religious
[52:12] things
[52:12] in their day so he had to prove that he
[52:16] was
[52:16] the living word for that day and hour
[52:19] amen oh my praise god
[52:23] he knew that the church would drift away
[52:27] she would go into the dark ages
[52:30] and he knew the way men originally had
[52:33] gotten away from
[52:34] god was first
[52:37] to leave the word of god if anyone
[52:41] is going to leave god they must first
[52:45] begin to drift away
[52:47] from the word of god if you have left
[52:51] this word
[52:52] then you have left god this god
[52:55] thus he is pressing himself to the to
[52:58] the to the pergamos church
[53:00] the pergamos church and church age for
[53:02] them to
[53:03] recognize that he is
[53:06] the word they must recognize the
[53:09] supremacy
[53:11] amen of the word of god
[53:15] the importance and power of the word of
[53:19] god
[53:20] he was saying i am the word
[53:23] and if you want deity in your midst
[53:26] supernatural
[53:27] presence and power of god operating and
[53:30] moving supernaturally
[53:32] in your midst you must welcome
[53:35] and receive the word of god for your day
[53:39] amen don't let anything come between you
[53:42] and or the word brothers and sisters

[53:54] you what names they call you they call
[53:55] them names they call
[53:57] all kinds of names to the apostles and
[53:59] uh you do you think the word christian
[54:01] was a good uh name back then
[54:05] it was like a curse word to the people
[54:07] oh you're nothing but a christian
[54:10] it was something people died if they
[54:13] were identified as christians
[54:15] now people are flaunting it you know

[54:21] spirit of god here right now

[54:44] i that speak to thee am he
[54:47] i am the word of god made manifest
[54:51] glory to god hallelujah are we impressed
[54:54] enough by this word
[54:56] that we will allow the word to
[54:59] assimilate it
[55:00] to to have it go down in their soul by a
[55:03] supernatural osmosis
[55:05] where we can take it and integrate it
[55:08] and mix it and let it be the important
[55:12] ingredient in our lives lifestyle home
[55:15] life our relationship with husband wife
[55:18] friends that we have all our associates
[55:21] will be allowed the word of god amen

[55:27] come off the printed page by divine
[55:30] understanding
[55:31] and let the spirit of god integrate it
[55:34] and place it within your heart and
[55:36] within your life and your soul
[55:39] and god my friends will come and
[55:42] give you himself jesus said he is the
[55:45] word
[55:45] so when a spirit born spirit-filled
[55:48] child
[55:49] of the living god takes the word into
[55:51] their heart
[55:52] it's nothing more than than
[55:55] deity itself speaking through you for
[55:58] it's the word speaking
[56:00] it's the word making himself manifest
[56:04] by supernatural this is the mystery of
[56:06] preaching paul was talking about
[56:08] not just us standing up and talking
[56:10] religious words
[56:12] but the spirit of god activated in the
[56:15] mind-heart
[56:16] life of the believer oh praise god
[56:19] and the spirit speaks through the
[56:21] preacher the prophet
[56:22] the anointed servants of the living god
[56:25] and making himself more moo there amen
[56:29] and then with that kind of authority
[56:32] every mountain has to go
[56:34] satan has to flee at the anointed
[56:37] word of god uh in this day and in this
[56:40] hour and when the church returns back to
[56:44] this word of fullness of the revelation
[56:48] amen of this written word when they
[56:51] return back to the
[56:52] revelation of the word god
