[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] this is the day the Lord has made let us
[0:20] rejoice in it and be glad the Lord bless
[0:26] you my brothers and sisters Lord bless
[0:29] you friends it's good to be here on this
[0:33] Sunday morning giving glory and praise
[0:37] and honor to him that is worthy of all
[0:42] praise may God bless us all richly as we
[0:49] go into the word of God
[0:52] now as you may remember that in my past
[0:58] two sermons I preached on the subject of
[1:03] our changing world in doing this I used
[1:09] two scriptures as texts Daniele - 19 -
[1:17] 20 - which I will now read and it reads
[1:24] us now for the background the King had a
[1:27] dream he could not remember his dream
[1:29] asked his wise men and they were stopped
[1:34] they could not tell him or give him the
[1:37] interpretation
[1:40] Daniel was asked and he said to the king
[1:44] he couldn't give him an answer until he
[1:47] talked to his God so Daniel went and
[1:51] prayer with the other three Hebrew boys
[1:55] and
[1:56] during the night God revealed to him the
[1:59] answer and now let us pick it up from
[2:03] here
[2:04] then was the secret revealed unto Daniel
[2:09] in a night vision then Daniel blessed
[2:14] the God of heaven
[2:15] Daniel answered and said blessed be the
[2:19] name of God for ever and ever
[2:23] for with and might are his and he
[2:28] changed at the times and the seasons
[2:33] he
[2:34] removeth kings and setteth of kings he
[2:39] giveth wisdom
[2:41] unto the wise and knowledge
[2:44] to them that no
[2:47] understanding and he revealeth the deep
[2:51] and secret things he knoweth what is in
[2:56] the darkness and the light dwells with
[3:01] him let us pray dear God our righteous
[3:06] and great Heavenly Father we thank you
[3:10] for your love your grace and mercy
[3:15] may your great Holy Spirit descend upon
[3:19] us today
[3:21] wake Oh Lord awaken Zion and let the
[3:26] word of God go forth in the name of
[3:30] Jesus Christ we asked for divine
[3:33] approval for your glory in Jesus name
[3:37] Amen and amen
[3:41] now as I said I use two scriptures the
[3:47] phrase from the first scripture Daniele
[3:52] chapter 2 verses 19 to 22
[3:57] he changes the times I
[4:02] also use the scripture out of
[4:05] Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 1
[4:09] for everything there is a season and a
[4:15] time for every purpose under
[4:19] heaven
[4:21] now I
[4:23] related the fact that
[4:26] from Adam and Eve
[4:29] right on down truly great corners of
[4:34] history
[4:36] unto
[4:38] 19:06 Azusa Street
[4:41] Pentecostal revival the world has been
[4:47] changing the
[4:49] last but
[4:52] unrecognized change
[4:55] was from the
[4:58] denominational the dision age
[5:02] to the agent time of the revealed Word
[5:07] of God
[5:09] now I
[5:11] have repeatedly emphasized
[5:14] that it was William Marion Breeland of
[5:20] Kentucky who God used as his prophet
[5:25] messenger
[5:26] his voice
[5:28] his signpost and his instrument for
[5:36] dispensational change I
[5:39] pointed out that the appearing of this
[5:42] 20th century prophet
[5:45] this Messenger of God
[5:49] signal the head writing on the wall as
[5:55] it was tongues in the time of Daniel
[6:00] written on the wall unknown towns were
[6:04] written on the wall at Belshazzar's
[6:08] feast
[6:09] today we witness
[6:11] the raising type of
[6:15] of these unknown towns in our day and in
[6:22] our time yes
[6:25] symbol of the blessing of the Holy
[6:28] Spirit
[6:30] also a symbol of
[6:33] judgment to come
[6:35] the handwriting again is up on the wall
[6:41] signaling the ending of the Gentile
[6:46] dispensation
[6:48] time for the Jewish
[6:51] Wrigleyville
[6:52] time for their Renaissance
[6:56] time for their unstoppable
[7:00] restoration
[7:02] time for them to enter into
[7:06] their inheritance
[7:09] time for global power and
[7:14] unparalleled influence
[7:17] how are they going to achieve this I do
[7:21] not know but it must be by the mighty
[7:26] hands of Jehovah that this is going to
[7:30] be this will come about God in his own
[7:34] wisdom and grace knows how to handle
[7:38] these situations
[7:41] time for their testing and time for
[7:45] their blessing for God's victory must
[7:49] blew and lost blossom and bloom and
[7:53] produced bountifully the fruits that God
[7:58] expects firm for them to produce so that
[8:02] when he comes again he'll find as I've
[8:05] said sweet fruit fruit that being
[8:09] sweetened under the hot Sun of trial and
[8:12] testing fruit that's been sweetened in
[8:16] the hot Sun of August spiritually
[8:19] speaking under the sign of Leo and the
[8:22] power and the presence of Almighty God
[8:24] oh yes for the Gentile people it will be
[8:30] right now it's pre tribulation time
[8:34] it's a sealing time and it's a rapture
[8:39] time the entire church is in
[8:43] anticipation
[8:44] and heart rubbing expectation of the
[8:49] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ to take
[8:53] his waiting brain away
[8:56] no this is not the end of the world
[9:01] this may friend that me repeat is not
[9:06] the end of the world it's it is just a
[9:11] bend in the history of the world it's a
[9:17] corner a turning point a time of change
[9:22] a time of spiritual change a time of
[9:28] religious change aa time of
[9:32] socio-economic
[9:35] change taking place right now and in
[9:39] particular we are
[9:43] experiencing a
[9:45] generational change oh praise God our
[9:51] world system is in birth pangs
[9:55] it's literally screaming
[9:59] screaming to give birth to a new age it
[10:04] was a new age to be born and so we see
[10:08] the convulsions the contortions we see
[10:12] my friends all these things that are
[10:16] taking place in the world and in the
[10:19] church in every area instructor of human
[10:24] life things are taking place that ought
[10:28] to arrest your attention that something
[10:32] is happening and that something else is
[10:36] fixing to take place yes sir whenever
[10:40] any woman is giving birth it's a
[10:45] dangerous thing for that woman
[10:49] because surely we know she's between
[10:54] death and life
[10:56] always
[10:57] dangerous
[10:59] always obtain when we are left with
[11:04] bated breath waiting to hear the baby's
[11:08] crying even so this world is in that
[11:12] kind of a state going through all manner
[11:16] of pains and changes to bring forth a
[11:21] new age to be born we hear and feel the
[11:27] beating pulse of the cosmos there is a
[11:31] spiritual earthquake going on I feel the
[11:37] tectonic plates of time are moving the
[11:42] pillar of fire is also moving and we
[11:46] must move along with the light of God or
[11:50] we will be left in total darkness if the
[11:55] modern day Church wants to stay stuck in
[12:01] the 7th l'audition church age and not
[12:05] listen to the voice of the mighty angel
[12:09] of revelation 10 one who used the
[12:14] instrumentality of Revelation 10 7 the
[12:17] 7th church age messenger zan my friends
[12:21] the light of God Ichabod is written
[12:24] across your doorpost the glory of God is
[12:27] departed and the Spirit of the Lord goes
[12:30] and seeks for him in that are not bound
[12:34] within denominational systems and and
[12:38] walls and tied up into all manner of
[12:42] wisdom and knowledge of man and the
[12:46] various
[12:47] psychologies and stuff of that nature of
[12:50] man but they are free to worship and
[12:54] praise him by the
[12:56] instruction guidance leadership and
[12:59] witness of the holy spirit of the Living
[13:03] God well have we heard the words of this
[13:06] song our God is marching on
[13:10] and the father said
[13:14] as Laureus as might have been the bass
[13:17] as glorious as they claim of Moses
[13:21] you're my zekiel even the time of the
[13:24] Apostles
[13:26] listen to Paul Paul tells us clearly
[13:30] that we are not to look back at the
[13:34] things of the past
[13:35] Oh Florida God hallelujah but the press
[13:39] to the mark of the high calling which is
[13:42] in Jesus Christ to look to the things
[13:45] that are before us look to the age
[13:48] that's emerging that's right before us
[13:52] absolutely friends political changes
[13:55] going on
[13:57] generational change is going on and the
[14:01] old world systems have to die so that a
[14:05] new world order or a new world system
[14:10] can be born where the two cannot exist
[14:15] together at the same time
[14:18] now there is a shifting not only of the
[14:23] system but there is a shifting of the
[14:26] roles the responsibilities and the
[14:30] rights it's now falling on the shoulders
[14:35] of our young people we must be aware of
[14:39] this and
[14:40] accept the change some are fighting
[14:44] tooth and nail with their entire life
[14:48] and future they're fighting to preserve
[14:53] or to resurrect fast memories of past
[14:59] past cultures civilizations and so on my
[15:05] friends you can't go forward by looking
[15:09] backwards and we be the only one of the
[15:15] animals I can identify that jumps
[15:18] forward ones looking backwards is mainly
[15:20] a frog and flies may have that ability
[15:24] to but only frogs do that and so let's
[15:29] look to the future let's look into
[15:32] tomorrow and see what tomorrow holds for
[15:37] me now his eye is on the spero and we
[15:40] know who holds tomorrow and so we have
[15:43] no fear no doubt but we press to that
[15:47] mark to the glory and praise of God so
[15:50] let me repeat some are fighting tooth
[15:55] and nail
[15:56] to preserve
[15:59] memories of the past they have in their
[16:04] minds memories of the past and they want
[16:08] to go back to those good old days but
[16:13] those good old days are past there now
[16:16] in the halls of memory and you can't
[16:21] find joy happiness or heat by trying to
[16:25] warn yourself at the painted fire of
[16:29] your memory
[16:31] remember this my friends
[16:35] fast memories can never return
[16:39] because in fact the spiritual and moral
[16:43] arc of the universe is on the move
[16:48] Matthew chapter 21 verse 44 Luke chapter
[16:52] 20 verses 17 to 18 as clearly saying to
[16:57] us that if we try to hinder and turn
[17:02] back my friends they move of God and the
[17:07] changing of the tidings and of the age
[17:10] that rejected stone will soon become a
[17:16] millstone and Isis scripture says it
[17:20] shall grind you or anything or anyone
[17:24] that is in its thick train to hinder it
[17:30] it will grind you to powder says the
[17:34] word of the Living God amen so we have
[17:39] we have seen here
[17:41] various junctions of time
[17:46] and now we are caught up
[17:51] in the convulsive truce of change which
[17:56] is always
[17:58] pitiful and painful
[18:00] now under the cover of copán 19
[18:06] satan with his earthly associates
[18:10] whoever they are
[18:12] have been testing out the limits or the
[18:17] extent of their powers here upon the
[18:21] earth
[18:23] now it's prophesied in Revelation
[18:27] chapter 13 verse 11
[18:30] that a day is coming when
[18:34] people will not be able to buy or sell
[18:39] without permission from these higher
[18:44] powers now this is written in the Bible
[18:48] this has been written and prophesied in
[18:52] your Bible over about two thousand years
[18:56] ago that a day was coming when people
[19:01] will not be able to buy or sell
[19:05] except by permission
[19:07] from higher powers now for this past
[19:12] three months
[19:14] we are literally
[19:17] experienced just that that we could
[19:20] hardly buy or sell or go anywhere or do
[19:25] anything
[19:26] or visit or whatever you could not do it
[19:31] simply as not the simple partial
[19:36] fulfillment of the Word of God for this
[19:40] is not the fulfillment of it but is a
[19:43] sign of things to come and of things
[19:47] that are certainly going to be
[19:51] now
[19:52] what is this man this now my friends was
[19:58] Satan and his Satan and his evil
[20:03] pernicious associate it's doing a dry
[20:07] run a
[20:09] worldwide
[20:11] experiment or test of how this will work
[20:17] during the time of tribulation
[20:21] or the Tribulation Period
[20:22] when he comes into a position of power
[20:29] which will be a time when none will be
[20:32] able to bind nor sell or any commercial
[20:37] enterprise
[20:39] without the mark of that
[20:43] Mystery Babylon Beast system spoken of
[20:48] in Revelation 13
[20:51] now there's another test or trying run
[20:56] that is going on
[20:59] it's the test to see and observe their
[21:04] testing right now as we speak you're in
[21:07] this covered 19 situation using that
[21:11] NASA as a cover as an excuse as a clock
[21:16] so that they may be able to test out and
[21:20] to give a dry run of how a cashless
[21:25] society
[21:26] would work
[21:29] now helps we see
[21:33] the rise of digital currencies
[21:38] we see the rise of crypto currency
[21:44] virtual currencies now once these new
[21:49] currencies prove themselves that they
[21:54] are
[21:55] usable and that they
[21:59] after being conditioned become
[22:03] acceptable to the public
[22:07] secure for the banks and the higher
[22:10] powers and
[22:13] profitable for those who have vested
[22:16] interests that will be when does that
[22:21] the day when the physical
[22:25] dollar cash dies that's the day the
[22:31] dollar dies many many men have written
[22:34] and spoken on this matter
[22:38] many great men have foreseen this name
[22:42] spoken of this day written of this thing
[22:45] and they have died and passed and gone
[22:49] to their reward in the presence of God
[22:52] but the Word of God marches on the Word
[22:57] of God moves on and they sell it back
[23:00] man and did not happen in their day oh
[23:03] oh but no this is the day that we are
[23:08] living in when we will be able to
[23:12] witness fulfillment of Scripture and not
[23:16] just listen to prophecy but be a part of
[23:19] that prophecy and watch it as these
[23:23] digital currencies come into prominence
[23:26] my friends and when they are pronounced
[23:30] legal and lawful and acceptable and
[23:34] profitable and secure that will be the
[23:38] day that the physical dollar dies it
[23:43] will be the end of cash
[23:46] now friends
[23:49] there are now lots of tests there's lots
[23:53] of pilot programs going on right now
[23:57] while we're speaking in various
[23:59] countries of
[24:01] and betting chips
[24:04] into the hands and into the bodies of
[24:11] citizens are you listening to me friends
[24:13] o hear the word of God hallelujah
[24:17] right now ah it's a voluntary
[24:22] but later it will become compulsory
[24:27] and if you do not
[24:30] you want be able to access your own
[24:36] digital money
[24:39] your digital accounts
[24:42] you would be able my friends then
[24:46] to be able to buy nor sale unless you're
[24:51] permitted access
[24:53] to your own
[24:55] accounts your own money or your own will
[25:00] now this is going on right now I've seen
[25:03] it where certain countries the some
[25:07] people are embracing it with joy and say
[25:10] oh I have it in my hand I just have to
[25:12] wave it over the the machine or I just
[25:17] have to wave it in front of my door or
[25:20] whatever and there it is and so it's
[25:24] being tested at a high rate right now
[25:27] around the world not just one country
[25:30] many countries some countries are making
[25:34] it public but they're doing it others
[25:36] are doing it quite quietly and certissue
[25:39] Slee behind the scenes but it is taking
[25:44] place while we yet speak my friends
[25:48] want you to know
[25:50] that it will be you will let me be
[25:54] literally forced by law or new laws that
[26:02] are coming to accept this microchip
[26:07] in your body
[26:11] now this microchip will make you
[26:16] locatable to them
[26:19] it will
[26:21] provide them with the ability to serve
[26:24] and you two never know where you are at
[26:27] any given moment and time
[26:31] thus you will be trackable
[26:36] GPS all that stuff will be built right
[26:40] in to that chip
[26:43] there will be nowhere on earth that you
[26:47] will be able to run hide or avoid Big
[26:52] Brother that will be watching over you
[26:56] and
[26:57] being more capable
[27:00] being under surveillance
[27:05] trackable means that the entire world
[27:10] will be the place where it's
[27:12] controllable
[27:14] be the place where it can be manipulated
[27:20] it's frightening my friends
[27:24] but every single individual on the face
[27:30] of the earth will have to accept their
[27:34] National micro chip
[27:38] with all its capabilities
[27:41] of
[27:42] monitoring you
[27:45] its capabilities
[27:48] of surveilling you
[27:52] 24/7
[27:54] it will mine to you in the streets
[27:59] it will monitor you in your very hopes
[28:07] it will monitor monitor you as it is
[28:12] already doing to a miniscule way
[28:16] online on the web
[28:20] whatever you doing
[28:23] it'll be crystal clear and you will be
[28:29] monitored in a magnified way on the web
[28:35] friends what are you listening to
[28:38] modern events are now being made clear
[28:43] by vindicated prophecy in the
[28:45] fulfillment of the Word of God and we
[28:48] are living in this season and
[28:51] as spoken of in the Word of God
[28:55] last Wednesday as I was teaching on the
[28:59] seventh Church ages I also mentioned how
[29:03] that the Bible said two witnesses will
[29:06] come to Israel which will be Moses and
[29:11] Elijah and the Scriptures clearly says
[29:15] that all the world will be able to see
[29:20] them and hear what they're saying
[29:23] they'll be killed in the streets of
[29:27] Jerusalem but the Bible tells us in
[29:30] three days other Lord will raise them up
[29:34] again and all the world shall behold his
[29:39] mighty hand my dear friends that was one
[29:44] of the indications of television of the
[29:48] internet the ability to be able to see a
[29:52] happening around the entire world
[29:55] instantly at the same time is in your
[29:59] Bible prophesied and spoken of in the
[30:02] Bible my friend let me say this to you
[30:06] well people look upon these prophets
[30:09] these messages of God as simpletons are
[30:12] men that the rugged man with her not
[30:15] knowledgeable not sophisticated not
[30:18] dignified in the way that man called
[30:21] dignity and all of that but they don't
[30:23] need such things all they need is for
[30:26] the wisdom of the Living God to flow
[30:30] through them all they need stuff to be
[30:33] able to surrender themselves so the
[30:36] Spirit of the mighty God could use them
[30:39] for his glory so when they are opposed
[30:42] you are not opposing the wisdom or
[30:45] knowledge of the man whether he is very
[30:49] knowledgeable earnest knowledge is
[30:51] miniscule that's not what you're really
[30:53] fighting or opposing you're opposing the
[30:58] ocean of the unfathomable
[31:01] infinite wisdom and power the holy
[31:04] spirit that feels true that servant of
[31:08] the Most High God amen yes sir I tell
[31:12] you now my friends
[31:14] that you will have to accept the mark of
[31:19] the beast you either accept them
[31:23] mark of the beast or you have to take
[31:27] the seal of God
[31:30] there is no time to lose
[31:33] while there is yet time to act choose
[31:37] which site you are on
[31:42] Joshua said I am my house we will serve
[31:45] the Lord my friends let it be clear to
[31:50] you that you must take that mark of the
[31:53] beast
[31:55] another time you will speak about that
[31:57] mark and what it literally is all my
[32:03] friends or you have to take the seal of
[32:06] God
[32:07] some say it's the Sabbath day some say
[32:12] the seat of God is one of slag is waved
[32:15] over you some say the seal of God is
[32:19] when you receive the right hand of
[32:22] fellowship
[32:23] some say the seal of God is when you
[32:27] have church membership in their
[32:30] particular church
[32:32] but according to the Word of God the
[32:36] seal of God is the Holy Spirit for the
[32:39] Apostle Paul said clearly use must not
[32:43] grieve the Holy Spirit by which you are
[32:45] sealed unto the day of your Redemption
[32:48] so the Holy Spirit Himself is the seal
[32:52] of the Living God hallelujah friends why
[32:57] don't you accept God's microchip instead
[33:01] of man's chips
[33:03] why don't you accept God's
[33:07] peace of himself
[33:10] a part of peace a ton of fire the holy
