and amen we're going to we tonight we're going to read some scriptures and we're going to talk about it hallelujah our scripture reading is uh Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 to5 Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 to5 in the beginning God created the Heaven and Earth full stop and the Earth was without without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said that was the F the first the first creation and the second and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from darkness and God called day light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day may the Lord add his Blessing for the reading of his word you may be seated Hallelujah I saw the light and I believe you saw the light Hallelujah the Bible said God created heaven and earth period that's where the people don't know how many years and it can be billions of years but that one is belongs to God now we are we are going to talk about light Hallelujah why God created light [Music] Hallelujah we are going to talk about light somebody will say why brother Desmond is talking about light light is very very important in human life Supernatural and natural living Supernatural and natural living without light no one can live on this Earth here God in the beginning God knew what he was doing Hallelujah God refer himself as light there are so many significant things we can talk about life first of all there are four things that I going to express tonight light work with life light work with life at the same time Darkness Darkness work with death right Darkness walk with death Light walk with life Hallelujah God call himself light the Lord Jesus said I am the light of the world so do you know that you are the light of this world Hallelujah without light no one can leave it doesn't matter whether you Pope or whatever overse the Seer whatever it is that's where it is you cannot change it Hallelujah so the light is very very important to our life if in the in the natural human life we cannot live without light Hallelujah daylight and daylight and Supernatural Al Supernatural supernaturally also the light that is in and also the light that is in you that leads you the light that in you that leads you physically also there's a light that is in your your body as you sitting down there there's a light that is in you aeal light that is in you that makes your heart work your whole organ Works yes without that light you cannot live Hallelujah God is so good he is so perfect Hallelujah I am glad that I'm associate with with him amen glory to God Amen thank you Lord the food that we eat also grow with light without light nothing can grow Hallelujah without light nothing can grow in this earth here that's right life consist with life consist with light for instance I tell you he said why Apostle Paul was killing Christians you ask yourself why he was killing Christians Apostle Paul this man he has a seed inside of him but that seed was covered with thick Darkness that there is no moisture that can bring forth that seed out you know what I call that moisture is witnessing when you expressing the word of God to somebody you moisture the the the Earth the ground that where the seed is inside it so when that thing is Mo and the sun heat that that that that what he grows so it's very very important for everybody to witness to everybody you don't know where the seed is inside there Paul knew the word of God he think he was doing God a service but without his will Paul Paul the so the seed that was in Paul was covered with a very thick dark dark dark Death gray that nothing can penetrate inside there so one day God said the only way I can do to bring this seed out he has to crack that ground and and let the light penetrate through that ground where the seed is amen so when he was going to do his work you know Paul was serious about God but he was doing by himself without that light without light that light you cannot do nothing you just walking without life the life that is in that light is eternal nobody can stop that light it's not this light here where you go there you press that in and Shout off no that light if you have that light is forever Eternal Hallelujah the light that is in you is eternal nobody can Shout started off until you reach your destination thank you Lord so Paul need a very good solid sunlight to shine through that to penetrate through that sea so you know his heart was really covered with Darkness so when he was going he need a special sunlight not Sun sunlight the sun hallelujah amen so while he was going God hit him struck him with a very bright sunlight bind that the light was so strong it blinded him he couldn't see nothing Hallelujah and it struck him on on the ground and since Paul was born he never saw that kind of light before after he open his eye he can see nothing all what he see is light around him special light so God created this light purpose for we to live naturally and the same that for we to live spiritually amen Hal Hallelujah he didn't just create a light no for we to live anything on this Earth here that has life he need the sun anything whether whether whether Apple what anything in this world you need a sunlight otherwise we cannot live praise God so when the son that time blinded him he need somebody that can do what spiritual massage he has to go God has already prepared somebody for there to go and give a spiritual therapy so that he can he can he can see so he said him to who anas to what to give him a spiritual he has to lay his hand to rub the hand my brother and then what speak spoke the word of God because God has prepared that man special for Paul to see the light then after he finished that spiritual ter Paul said now I can see Lord hallelujah Glory now all the shuckles and the Darkness and the the hard clay that was in the heart was bust up amen hallelujah W the seed has sprung forth hallelujah thank you you think we can sit here like this I run I was hardhead like four but God has to come down and struck me before I can come here I'm not just standing here because now when God does that you know that you know no man calls you it's God himself calls you don't you are what a confidence oh God hallelujah nothing can moves you if you want to move you cannot move you are in Bound and chains like Paul cuz God loves you he has a work for you to do nobody can do the work that you do God has a special work for you to do so you better prepare if you are not prepared you better prepare you say oh I can't have I I don't have enthusiasm like these brothers when they laugh and jump and this and that and that no Moses one time said that oh I a stum I can talk to who made MTH who made you God Made You there's a time will come you don't know what what happened how did this thing come is God himself going to use you that you will never forget in your life Hallelujah we are all here to work for the kingdom of [Applause] God Paul didn't knew that didn't know that he was going to be how God use him so do we we don't know how extend how God is going to use us whether you st leader whether you a musician whether you are this what just stay right there and do the best as you can hey let me tell you Satan will never stay there never let you stay there like that he will come and bust you up but the greater is in you is more than he that is in you hallelujah oh let me tell you I am happy very very happy my today I was telling one I said look here if I die today 10 years 20 years time what there's no difference because I'm standing here the same time my part is over there why do you think the Lord Jesus the son man you see here is still in heaven the same God God is in you right now amen hallelujah you stand here you still over there your part is over there you just have to like a magnet as soon as you get up from this one is you like a magnet Hallelujah glory to God you know when brother Mar was in the in the hospital I went to visit him he told me something he said brother I went to Coma he said all all of a sudden there was a chariot came and I they made him sit down sat down inside and that that Chariot he took me all around around around around around around he took me all around I'm sitting in this nice Chariot and The Chariot was taking him all around he alone and The Chariot was taking him all around like that Circle Circle he didn't know about he didn't all of sudden he said get out then as soon as he get out his eye open he he said you don't want to come back the chair he was sitting in the chair The Chariot was taking him all around my brethren this is real don't deceive yourself don't let nobody deceive you let this this gospel that we are in be your everything it doesn't matter what circumstance comes your way why do you think that you you some this gospel take somebody two people the Lord Jesus Christ said like that two people in the bed I will take one and leave one this gospel separate families husband and wife no matter how the husband and have a try they cannot take him out brother Gabriel you don't know how I went through with brother Gabriel Brother Gabriel is a very strong brother all his family he has Italian has a strong strong belief for cath Catholic is very hard to get away from Catholic so when he saw this message my brother is not him alone me all the family against me but I never I never give up from gabra hallelujah it's not me but God put me there to strengthen him Hallelujah fight his brother his wife his children everybody but brother Gabriel saw the light the light the seed inside inside of him has sprung up is growing nothing can stop stop that seat to go back where he was before yes was not easy cuz God knew what he was doing two brother Gabriel now we have a pastor hallelujah praise God you see go God know everything through brother Gabriel Brother D came there brother brother came there I was working with brother gabri but I was inside working brother Abra was in the office my brother this fight Satan will never leave you the same way that you want you're going to Satan going to give you a hard time as I said but the greater is in you is more than he that is is in him he's out there praise the Lord thank you Lord oh oh brothers and sisters let me tell you if that light begin to shine on you you can run but you cannot hide you can run everywhere but you cannot hide this is real oh yes you get a sunshine in your soul I get a sunshine in my soul the sun is shining in my soul and when the sun comes inside there all the darkness flee no Darkness can stay in the in the in the light yeah I'm going to read something here The Book of John chapter 1 verse chap the of Book of John chapter 1 vers up to 10 1 to 10 in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by made made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life see life and life and and light goes together in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shine in darkness and darkness comprehended it not there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same the same came for a witness to Bear the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light who is the light the Lord Jesus Christ himself amen hallelujah in the beginning he came down and stay with us he never leave us leave from the beginning when he created the world he came down to live with us that was the light and the light shine in darkness and the dark oh sorry there was a man sent from God whose name was join and the same was the witness to Bear witness for the light all men through all men through him might believe he was not the light but was sent to Bear the witness of that light Hallelujah that was the True Light so where is the true light is in you H which lighten every man that came into the the world so this light here the day and everything everybody's enjoying but there's some special people that has a special seed that light will shine through penetrate through that death and that that seed Will Spring forth that is you Hallelujah because remember Not all men are men when I say men is the people in the world because not everybody has that the seed inside some people has God's seed and some people doesn't have nothing so it doesn't matter how the light shine to them not you have nothing to bring out [Applause] Hallelujah he was in the world and the Word was made by him him and the world knew him not why people talk about about about about the other God when you read John here it tells you that the Lord Jesus Is God himself that came down say I am the light of this world without me there is no life cuz if you have the light you have life you don't have light you have either you have have light or you have Darkness it's two things and when Bible talk about darkness is dark you cannot wake up no more Hallelujah you know when when when I was when I was young living in a village we don't have electricity like here everywhere in the night everywhere is p dark and when you're a kid and you going out you scared like hell you scared like hell so sometime your we have something called uh not candle they have mantle you hold that with a shield that one you can use and the people not everybody have that one so what they do they pick up a a can a bottle of can and they put a wig inside and put a Kine yes sir inside there that will give you light to go out and sometime that wig gets so hard he can't see nothing so you have to clean that wig and then car then it can give you light so if your light is dim you got what trim Hallelujah if you stand on a daughter of God and you see you have you have a skape in your in your eye or somewhere you got what pray Dre prayer Hallelujah put yourself together so that you can shine because light is not make to live in the room or he has to shine so that's what Let Your Light The Gospel Light Shine Hallelujah so when you go somewhere you are bright as bright can be Hallelujah when Paul got that light that bright light that's why he couldn't get away from that light the light was so bright why do you think Paul was so that wrote this thing here he saw something Supernatural that light that that blinded him no man on earth have ever seen that light hallelujah thank you Lord so the light is very very very important in our Liv hallelujah amen Oh Glory to God thank you Jesus you know God is merciful he merciful and so time the same time he's gracious it doesn't matter how long that seed is inside there if that seed is still inside is going to come out it doesn't matter you can try as much as you want to do whatever you want go if God could bring Paul out he can he will bring every seed out Hallelujah because Paul was serious he he was he was very serious when he was killing the Christian and Paul you know when Steven was they were killing Steven Paul was standing there he was he stood there and watch it how they they Stone steeven and steeven never cares them he just said oh Lord open your eye hallelujah thank you he said I saw you know what what what what what what caus what H the devil say I I see God sitting over there and the devil say even I'm killing this man is still mention this name remember devil told them don't mention this name no more in the in the city of Jerusalem this name is aeal in the name Jesus Hallelujah he said Don't Preach in this name anymore cuz the light is so bright so when you mention that name it prick their heart Hallelujah it PR their soul so what they will have to find every possible way to stop that seed to Spring forth but they could not stop it no child of God will remain here everybody will go over there Hallelujah whether you like it or you don't like it if you a seed of God you going to go hallelujah thank you Lord amen he said if I could could be LIF I will draw all men unto me but not but but he cannot he cannot why because they could not understand him someone would say why brother Desmond he he is God he can do all things yes remember he said who whosoever will but the seed of God will but some will never come no matter how much it does some will never come they will not come due to their Stony hearted because their heart is Stone there is no moisture can can s soften the stone no stone is Stone that's why call Stony hearted no matter what you do stone canot get soft hallelujah what it is is what it is if I'm a Catholic I die with a Catholic no matter what you do Hallelujah they are not of his they of their that's why the Jesus said they are are not of his they are of their father the devil in the beginning he was a murder as brother Dan explained last time Kain seed K seed from the beginning he was a murder the Lord Jesus said it why he was a murder because there's no life inside it Hallelujah no matter what the Lord does that light cannot sh shine on that stone the when the light hit the stone is going to be polished going to be shine but there's nothing to come out Hallelujah nothing can grow on the stone hallelujah thank you Jesus blessed be the name of the Lord there Stone hearted thank you Lord amen I'm happy to be the Son of God thank you Jesus amen blessed be the name the Lord Jesus Christ let us read the the book of psms Psalm 27 Psalm 27 the Lord is my light and my salvation Who Shall I Fear the Lord is my strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid praise the Lord the Lord is your light so the light that we talking about this light is the Lord himself amen is the Lord [Applause] himself thank you Lord It's the Lord himself nobody can can can uh can't deny that the Lord himself is the light praise be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah he said I am the light of the world thank you Lord Jesus amen Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm going to read another another place here in Joshua Joshua josua chapter 10 verse verse 12 to 14 then spake to Joshua the Lord J sp sp to Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord deliver up the amorites before the children of Israel and he said in the sight of the Israel son thou stand thou still upon Gideon and thou moon in the valley of aelon and the sun Stood Still and the mood stay until people had Avenged thems upon their enemy is not that written in the Book of Joshua so the son stood still in the midst of heaven and and hasted not to go down about the whole day why josua need a son Hallelujah he want God to be with them stay with them because if the enemy that because darkness is death if if night come they know it's going to be a lot of death so you need a light Hallelujah to finish the work God is light you see Joshua he knew who he was can you speak the word of God and believe and something happen there is no different spirit in Joshua than you he's the same Spirit Hallelujah let me tell you God is good and he so real if God has done something to you and you have seen physical thing there oh you you always run to do something for God because why you want to see more Lord give me more that's the first time human being has spoke the word and God listen to him and stay with him to do the work Hallelujah God loves you so much that you are his son anything that happen around you he's interested there's nothing that ever happened to you that God is not interested in it God is interested with all your Affairs whether you want a wife you want a husband you want to grow more age God can give you more age brother Chris it doesn't matter the the the brother was dying said Lord give me 15 years God gave it to him Hallelujah if you want to die tomorrow you can say Lord let me go tomorrow up to you but I don't want I don't I have something I have a work to do Hallelujah let me tell you if you wake up in the morning and you going to work and you believe you will not come back home that day you will never come back home that's you don't know what power is in you you don't know if the natural electricity that is in you natural electricity that is in you yeah would that that electricity you cannot leave that light and there's a special light that shine around you every day and night it doesn't M don't be scared don't be afraid yes why he said don't be afraid it's I Hallelujah we human beings sometime we try to forget who our God is there's no darkness in him if you know darkness is death and you are in the light why you have to scare Darkness as soon as the dark here you go here the whole place bright sunshine and if you want to call for rain it will rain hallelujah thank you Lord let me tell you every Christian supposed to be happy unless you don't know who you are if you know who you are you're going to to your KY Glory Glory Hallelujah Glory Glory Hallelujah Glory Glory Hallelujah is true is Maring all where is the true you are the true the true God is in you hallelujah thank you Jesus let me tell you there's nothing that you may think that God is not in it in your life every little thing in your life God is in it do you know when you are doing something wrong a thought comes to you and say stop if you didn't stop you're going to see yourself you start shaking inside unless you ignore that spirit that is warning you then you can do that if you are Spirit spiritual enough you're going to know that God is talking to you that's why you have to learn how to talk you to God and you have to learn how to receive and you have to learn the the small little voice that is leading you hallelujah amen it's very very important for you to know the god that you serve the god that you serve never sleep he's always around you he never leave you he said I will never never leave you nor forsake you I am the light of the world he didn't he say that he said it am I am the light of the world so and when he was going he said all what I have I gave it to you so who is the light now who is the light if he gave everything to you who is the light now you are Mrs Jesus a and you are going and you still scared you go to the doctor and the doctor find finds something so oh this is you're going to be shocked some people start panicking these things here it doesn't it doesn't bother me if I die today tomorrow is the same death tonight tomorrow is the same thing but you have to make sure your priority is right so you don't have any conscience in you that you guilty there's no getting in the people of the children of God hallelujah he took everything on the cross yes see these people are guilting no I take for myself let them go they are my children Hallelujah glory to God he took everything already so none of us is good Hallelujah he sealed and when he took it he sealed with that his own blood ping the seal is there who going to take the seal nobody can open that seal until we get to him Hallelujah glory god you seal you seal till that day when you meet him face to face oh glory to God our God is good am this gospel is real brother Abraham message is real not everybody can take it if you are watching over there and I'm saying this brother Braham message is real is God sent message for special people if you criticize it you pay the price Hallelujah glory to God how many people challenge him and die some of them in front of the congregation they have to pack them out glory to God God is God you don't believe don't say nothing go your way but if you start criticizing and bringing the children of God God said they are my people they are my people whatever you do against them you done unto me yes don't think that I'm stand here so you can say anything about the gospel if I'm standing here and I'm preaching you want you listen you don't want it's up to you but I know in my heart God is speaking through me because I have no words to speak Hallelujah I didn't call myself to stand here there's something inside of me that bear witness that I have to stand here otherwise I cannot stand here and everything that I'm speaking one day I'm going to answer for it so I am confident for what I'm saying if God to be if God is God I have to worship Him hey there is a lot of adors in my country even my own home my ancestors they worship adors so many times when I went there I told my uncles I I want to burn everything you don't want me to burn it it's okay that's yours my my brother kof and brother F were you know there when I asked my uncle he said no I cannot stand I cannot give you Authority cuz he's scared too cuz he has no protection God was in Me God has protected me and you know what God did something Supernatural right before him that I'm not we are not just standing dead just like that my brother who has that stroke two stroke in front of him me brother F and brother kof we lay hands upon him he couldn't get up he lay hand upon Him instantly he got up and walk in front of him Hallelujah that shows you that God himself is God hallelujah he stood up and W and you know the one the testimony my brother G he says two days before we came over there he saw three men stood far away like that calling him come come come come come and we were calling him and we three we stood right there and right there he got his healing right there my brother my sister do not underestimate yourself this gospel is real amen this evening I get a phone call from Ghana when I went to Ghana I I went all around to preach the gospel I went to Kia there's a people that set them up in the house to share this gospel with them so I went there I stood there with them why we are finished the lady came and said this this young boy is dumb he can't speak so he want me to pray for you I said okay bring him so I I I I anoint him with the oil and pray for that boy he called me this evening this evening when I'm came to church so I have something to tell you the boy that you lay your hand upon him now he can say 1 2 3 4 what is your name then he mention his name that boy was not talking the boy is talking hallelujah amen hallelujah let me tell you this gospel we not just talk we have the reality and and and and what do you call it uh uh oh this this word let let me Hallelujah we have a reality and proof that this gospel is the Lord Jesus Christ gospel so what he did back there he's doing the same thing today yes he is through what his children he's showing that he is the real light that is shining everywhere the light sh everywhere every country the whole world the natural light give them food the spiritual life give them spiritual life Darkness you death winter is there so right around the winter nothing go even the trees the natur the natural stuff when they see death they have to run to the root to hide they don't like they don't like Darkness let me tell you anything like God nature doesn't like Darkness the nature itself doesn't like Darkness because when the darkness come either they die or they don't grow if you plant something you get you don't get enough light you can never get fruits that you want going to get a little bit here a little bit here and sometime it it can be just grown up like that but it's no fruit that's right you need the sunl light the nature C for the light what about we the real light is the Lord Jesus Christ he gave himself for us as a light you get in your room no light you can't see nothing you hit your you hit your shield with with a a chair then after you start going like this if the light is there you w't go like this you understand it happened to you several time sometime you get up you don't know there's a light no light there you boom then you started blaming your wife why you put this see here hallelujah yeah but it's not your it's not it's not your wife God there's no light there Hallelujah huah that shows you light is very very important in the human life glory to God Amen I am happy that God has given us the great light in this hour and this light is the light that is shining upon Earth through the message of William maram Braham Hallelujah this light is a special light not for everybody it's a special light for people whom God has designated for this light Hallelujah I read a little thing here for you to hear there there is a man here that can turn on the light say nothing natural nothing natural or spiritual can live without God light this is that's a paragraph 83 there's a man here that can turn on the light he said nothing natural nothing natural or spiritual can live without God's light life can only come then by light nothing natural or nothing spiritual can live without God's life think of that all right but when he sent us the light see and that and does all these things and when and then we rejected it now that's the pitiful part is when the light is rejected when is sent to us praise the Lord anybody rejected the light of this world the word of God you are doomed to death cuz only this light the light of God you can receive Life Light and life work together darkness and death work together remember two people on the cross one with the Lord Jesus Christ went and the other one with Judas they went cuz where two in the darkness and two in the light so these two works together God created this light why he created the light first because with that light anything that he has created will never live there will be no life in it so God light is the only one that is shining in this hour amen the light of God praise the Lord I think this is I can I can I can talk a little bit more about light but I think I'm going to leave it here tonight
