========================================
[Music] we all went to camp it was such a blessing to go somewhere and everybody they were our family and I just appreciate the time and the preachers taking their time to speak to us and for me I'm

[Music] [Music] to make first one you've got concentrates or taken near my treatment email I received I wanted you've got plans for the ministry that is the order we have very specialized [Applause] once you are ready here speech and food you have to appreciate this and I know what I'm talking about I received my pastor if I for ministry and whatever fault or dies I think our x coordinate tonight I would like to be to this forum there is [Music] so we shall not all be waiting for the change for a better twin clean our own eyes why change me laughs oh oh [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this came to me see and was very very clearly see he's not healed and at that point [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so after that we went to Harvard now this doctor is very very good [Music] [Music] [Music] two weeks no I [Music] I was [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you know danny has a song for us as well [Music] [Music] [Music] let's just-okay we do another ze one of the big dancer hardy is one of the best I said for 24 years I've been going to church we have a service and we go into the new year together and you know it's it's it's tremendous because we get you know opportunities to sing do specials and you know we've got a band that gets up there testimonies of people talk about what God did for them that year and how wonderful the Lord is and that's cool because that's our life you know you know I could sit here testimony after testimony you know I believe 2018 was one of the greatest years ever for my wife because you know we had the best financial year in 24 years I'm not saying it because of that what we did this is a grace enough I'm not saying it because you know were still help being strong I've seen it because our walk with the Lord through thick and thin has gotten closer the event that's coming greater has got more supernatural because this walk is a supernatural block there's nothing ordinary about Saints and all I can say is you know right up until yesterday but I can give you testimony after testimony of what God did just in the last year but I can't remember I can't I can't remember them all because they have to almost every day because this is a supernatural if you're walking with God ladies you know where does Jesus Christ right now he's in his word he said an investment to the album and like I always tell people I solicited because you were on the earth when Christ was here back 2,000 years ago would you recognize them just think about would you breath or would you you know be looking at him as a as a heretic you know how you look at me right now the way I'm talking about the Lord you haven't heard something talked about God the way I talk we haven't then we know that there's definitely something different and I said you better believe me because sometimes you know sons come along and they and they strike your heart and this is one of the songs that you know that struck me is saying a couple songs to a man and this was one that that struck me it's called different because you know if there's anything that that we do want is we want to be different we want to continue to change and that's what makes you different as the world goes on things are happening things are always changing or slower we live upon line precept upon precept were being changed amen praise God [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] I wanna beat [Music] this [Music] [Music] [Music] to all of these No [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this oughta be different I wanna be cheers to all the means [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] you know one of the things that that holds us back a lot of times in achieving victory in our lives and moving forward is this thing called feud it's you know if you look at the word fear its faults evidence and it appears and I don't know what you Saints but this is this is a season or Satan is trying to put so much fear on the people that we really looked there's horror movies there's you know it's it's constantly trying to bring fear bring fear into control the minds of the people but you know what fear does not live you as a son or daughter of dog you should be able to know that God is on our side and he said all things are possible there's nothing wonderful thing that should stand in your way as a son or daughter hallelujah amen throne so I'm gonna sing this song is another song is called fear he is a vibrant amen amen so what feared comes and those thoughts tell me on the greatest battle ever fought you just say Satan you're a liar and a liar from the beginning there's only one fear that's the fear of God and to know him in the power of his resurrection [Music] he is you will take your red stop you [Music] you rub your rest steal your happiness [Music] [Music] [Applause] I told you you're not gonna I told you [Music] [Music] [Music] goes [Music] [Music] when told you you in trouble [Music] when you talk to you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right speciality what do you mean your Lord and Savior Jesus Christ my testimony tonight is to encourage someone 1994 it was cancer I spend one year under treatment when the year was out you got to say you have to take this pill for the rest of your life right out okay what did you think he when I said if I take you plan to trust my guards and I said if I think you came I don't trust my god and I promise them anything human I serve you and then we don't be ashamed to tell people what you have done for me where are you 24 years ago [Applause] Oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] and so I just want to go thanks only way through 2018 [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] my [Music] Oh my precious Oh [Music] Oh [Music] Hey [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] as you know I didn't know that special testimony how they came from when they were background and everything so we're gonna get with 15-20 minutes for the plea to about coming to this that'll be sister Dorothy let you know a little bit about sister Morley before she comes she's the wife of a great unsung hero in this church it's a nutritionist in the kingdom of God she said it has brother Tim I say he's on song because government is a trustee he's in the background does my food come from but he works he does marvelous work [Music] she has been apparently that the leadership of the was fellowship that's all I'll say a long time helping lead women fellowship and they get strong a lot of the sisters appreciated that she's someone that has been faithful in church what does that mean well there's a lot that goes into that my brother my sister if your favorite church needs your support in the ministry and these are you know it means you stand out in the background for services over saying god bless you somebody encouraging somebody along the way praise God that is a great spent I relocated from the Church of fellowship she's the mother of three children who she is still believing for praise God we know that while they grew up in the church and she stone I believe it for the amen she also deGrasse grandmother by the Bahaman so maybe she'll play but we'd like to welcome out this time my sister normally I want to say it again I believe there's power amen [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] meetings there was moving so I was very blessed with parents I was born eight of nine children when parents had to separate families I would say there was two children that didn't survive agency between the older flora and the number three so I technically was the oldest girl at home so guess what everybody's responsibility was so my dad was a deacon in the church near as big so there was great expectations you're expected to total behind responsibilities there was no negotiation my older siblings my parents were Christians we eventually went into Pentecost in tongues and my dad said anyway I can remember as a child my dad going for fast 20-day dots he would be the home go to captain woods and he would say forty days but anyway with the church because they were in many cost and there was a eleven year difference between the older siblings and the younger group my older siblings were not Christian when when parents come into Pentecost they do not adjust very well so they went to live with my aunt military my older sisters went to the pylon so I grew up not knowing my older siblings at all we saw them twice a year sometimes we Mother's Day Father's Day they show up creating kicked my parents and at Christmas time they would show up again bring this for us we thought that was fantastic so they were like uncles and aunts so as my dad was a deacon we had church several times with me twice on Sunday Tuesday night firstly and Saturday night because people live within like a 30-mile radius and anybody that traveled from a fair distance usually ended up at our house between services on Sundays so we had to prepare there at least 20 plus so every Saturday was spent thank you cookies eggs preparing food and we [Music] it was our Saturday morning Washington we were in the kitchen baking for Sunday March Break for spent going to my grandparents place staining to the wallpaper even as a child I guess you could say I had family she's built for responsibility maturity like fast it was [Music] was a physical activity skating they all go separation is just the church family was the family there was no connection with other family members basically grew up
