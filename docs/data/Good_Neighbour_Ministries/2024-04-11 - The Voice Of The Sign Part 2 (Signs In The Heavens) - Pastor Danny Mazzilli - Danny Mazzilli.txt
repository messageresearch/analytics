Saints thank you so much praise God it's good to be in the house of the Lord again Wednesday night um we like to kind of treat our Wednesday nights like a Bible study praise God and so tonight we're going to continue on what we started on Sunday but we're going to be looking at some facts and details and things that uh that by the grace of God we can pull from the word of God and I trust that you have faith tonight to um pull from the word amen we can only uh we can only Minister the word of God and then if there's faith in your hearts then uh the Holy Spirit can reveal things and that's what makes makes um the word so exciting for us as Sons and Daughters of the Living God praise God Amen how many enjoyed the eclipse on uh Monday did did uh you guys all get out and kind of try to see it I hope you did amen praise God I mean with the proper glasses and so forth you know you got to take all the precautions but um I really enjoyed it I tried to get home in time you know from work to to kind of you know be there with sister Jen to to see it but the traffic was ridiculous I couldn't believe it when I pulled out of Oakville I thought wow that's a lot of traffic on Spears Road and then I get down to the to bronny road and it was just jammed like just jammed so by the time uh it happened I was I I was at the 407 just before Dundas so I just decided Ed to pull right off to the side of the road and I just put my glasses on I opened my sunroof and I watched it and it was it was marvelous I really really enjoyed it praise God I'd never seen a total eclipse in my life praise God so I I had a good time and I trust that you did I I saw a lot of shots and pictures of some of the saints that they uh that they took and I thought there were some really good ones there praise God so let's go to our scripture tonight we're going to read um you can go go to slide number 10 okay we're going to read from Daniel where we left off on Sunday Daniel 2 27-28 and then we're going to read slide number three Psalms our scripture from Psalms um which is from Psalms um actually let's read Psalms first go to chap yeah let's go to Psalms first amen let's pray father thank you tonight Lord for this opportunity to once again Lord to search your scriptures and uh these events that have taken place around us Lord you've given us um the spirit of discernment to recognize and to see Lord beyond what the human eye would see Lord we're we're listening for your voice through it all Lord because um Revelation is what stirs our hearts and what gives us um Liberty and and to know who we are and the hour that we're living in so we just ask that you would continue tonight Lord let your anointing come upon the word father and just bless us tonight father we pray in Jesus name amen Psalms 19 verses 1 to5 it says the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament show his handiwork day unto day utth speech and night unto night showeth knowledge there is no no no speech nor language where their voice is not heard their line is gone out through all the Earth and their words to the end of the world in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race praise God you may be seated amen this scripture tells us very clearly that the Lord has set his word um his first Bible in the heavens and we were looking at that on Sunday and we were able to draw so many um things from the scriptures and we looked at how the Zodiac has been you know taken out of context and perverted and how that you know people are looking for signs they're always looking to hear what their future holds and they're trying to figure out what their future holds and they'll go to the Zodiac they'll go to psychics they'll go to try and find out things but we know that that God's word is only given by Divine Revelation by the word of God Amen and that Faith cometh by hearing and by hearing the word of God and so we were looking um at um how you know it was basically the Lord doesn't want us to be looking anywhere else he wants us to look to his word amen and um we read in Daniel chap 2 verse 27-28 Daniel answered in the presence of the king because the King was looking for answers he was having dreams and so he was getting you know signs and and uh things that that were in his dreams that were troubling him and just like a lot of people out there to day they're seeing all kinds of events that are happening worldwide they're trying to figure out what's going on they can't figure it out but Daniel turns around and says the secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men the astrologers The Magicians the soothsayers show unto the king but there is a God Amen there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets and maketh known to the King Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days and so that's where we ended off and so here we are we're living in the latter days you can go to slide 11 now we'll go from there and we'll just continue on and so um we have just um uh experienced another solar eclipse and um the solar eclipses uh the ones that were kind of um you know interested in is the is the last two that just took place there's there was one in 2017 and there was one in 2024 now I want to give you a little bit of history on the solar eclipses that have taken place first of all you need to recognize that um the significance of these total solar eclipses is that they have happened in America where did God sent the prophet to America where did he come out of America and so here we are in North America and these things that are taking place we want to you know kind of see how it is that you know it ties into to us we know that the message of the hour is worldwide that the prophet did not just come to America but in fact coming out of America and ministering to America we also know that the word of God was pronounced against America through the prophet of Malachi 45 in that he indicted this generation for the second crucifixion of the word of God in other words they rejected the word They Crucified the word they they spoke against the word and America basically uh would go into darkness and that there would be no real opportunity for the nation of America you know a lot of people would like to say oh well America you know can still repent and and uh you know and turn and God will not pour out his wrath upon America sorry the only way and the only people that can repent are those individuals the Sons and Daughters of God that need to be birthed by the word of God somebody's singing somebody's phone is singing yeah praise God just a reminder to make sure you put your phones on silence and so um America received uh their last sign they received their last word as a nation okay you know it was in 19 or in 1776 that America became a nation and in in 1778 there was um there was a total eclipse it was the first one that was registered by nasau okay after that now we're going to look at the the the 20th century solar eclipses and we're going to see from there that there's you know certain um correlations that we can draw from the message of the hour and the word of God that we know has been revealed to us and given to us through a Vindicated Prophet amen now um the total solar eclipses are rare and aren't often visible from the US the last time one occurred here was in 2017 and the US won't will not see another another one until 2044 okay now I'm going to just run off a list of total solar eclipses in the US during the 20th century okay the first one was in 1900 right in the year 1900 it was the first eclipse of the 20th century it was in 1900 according to the park services the path of totality of that Eclipse brought it over Wadesboro North Carolina okay in 1918 18 years later a total solar eclipse was visible from Washington to Florida according to the parks Services okay and this is information that comes also through NASA it was the last time a solar eclipse would be visible across the entire continent for nearly 100 years because it wasn't until 2017 that another one took place and we're talking total in that fully visible from the US and over the US from coast to coast all right after that there was another one in 1925 and this was followed um uh on January the the sometime in January 1925 which was visible from Minnesota through New England according to NASA now I want you to note here seven years apart from 1918 to 1925 7 years apart interesting right Lord Works in sevens 1932 is the next one from 1925 to 1932 7 years apart in August 1932 another totally Eclipse was visible in North America the path of totality for this Eclipse was mostly in Canada okay according to NASA but was visible in in Northern New England including parts of Vermont Maine New Hampshire and Massachusetts okay Again 1932 was a significant year that was the year that the prophet basically brought forth some prophecies the year later 1933 and that was the time that he was actually starting to come on the scene with his public Ministry okay 1963 now 30 years later 1963 was the next total solar eclipse in the US and um this Eclipse was visible in Alaska and parts of Northern New England according to nasau what happened in 1963 the opening of the word the coming of the Lord Lord sunset Mountain amen praise God Revelations 10 1-7 the opening of The Seven Seals so there was 30 years between 1932 and 1963 then the next one after 1963 was seven years later again notice the sevens okay March 1970 another total eclipse solar eclipse was visible from the coast of Southwest United States okay um again seven years apart and then we come to 2017 okay so in 2017 we had another total solar eclipse from coast to coast across the US right right across to to from one Coast to the other and it was a 100 years after the last one okay now the crossing points are interesting we're going to be looking at those let's go to the next slide I want you to notice here now on this next slide it shows the path of totality going through the United States from one end to the other 2017 um is uh the one that's coming from the top down and the one of 2024 is the one from the bottom up you'll notice that it puts a big cross right over America okay the 2017 Great American Eclipse had a path Over America that passed by seven Salems okay at that time there was there's cities throughout the United States now the actual path of totality did not go or like you know where the total eclipse was did not go directly over seven Salems but if you look at those um uh well they're not they're not actually written on this map here okay but it was the one that goes from the top down down from the top all the way down there there are seven Salems in various United States um uh States okay significance of that well Salem we know is you know Shalom peace right the king of Salem was MDC okay you know I I'm just looking at all these things and meel MDC come out which was the king of Salem king of Peace the king of righteousness the king of Jerusalem that's brother brandham back in 1964 and we are after the order of mzc all right and we've been under the leadership of mzc amen and God has a royal priesthood after the order of mzc and there's only one people that um Shalom uh can be directed to and that is the Sons and Daughters of the Living God to us it is Shalom but to the world they're going into more chaos it's going to get worse and then you look here um the the eclipse of 2024 first of all um it goes right across the US ends in Canada and um we're going to be looking at this later on but you'll note that there are seven ninas okay in the states in different parts of the United States that this kind of passes by okay it actually goes over two ninas one in Indiana that's significant right and another one in Ohio all right but the one that that kind of you know piqued my attention was the one in Indiana also just before um we had the eclipse here on Monday you'll note that on um I think it was Thursday or Friday that New York had a 4.8 magnitude ude earthquake okay 48 is April VI eth okay I know these are just simple things but but you see we are the sons and daughters of God we have the ability to catch the Revelation behind everything that's going on and we know that that that the message of the hour is the Revelation to this world there is no other Revelation outside of this of the message of the hour that we are carriers of we carry the pure unadulterated word of God and in US is the ability to recognize discern and draw out the mind and the faith and the Revelation that God is giving us praise God okay I want you to notice too that they ma they made mention of an enormous Comet that was actually visible during the Eclipse that took place on Monday this comet is called the devil Comet it's been it's been given the name the devil Comet because if you actually see it and I actually did see it it it's like it's like a round and then it's got like two horns coming up through the top of it and it looks like the devil the head of the devil right and that's why they gave it the nickname The Devil's Comet but what's interesting is that it was actually visible during the eclipse okay because of the darkness and the timing of it and I'll tell you it um it was passing by the Earth for the first time in more than seven decades 70 years okay the comet officially known as 12p ponds Brooks got its nickname due to the formation of two horns made up of ice and gas experts told the NBC the it has been unusually bright compared to others okay it's apparently the size of Mount Everest and orbits the sun about every 71 years so the last time that it actually orbited was in 1953 the next time it will return is like 2095 so I went back and I searched when did Brother brandham you know actually make mention of the serpent seed and expose the serpent seed and I went back and from Wikipedia I got this about William brandom it says in his recorded sermons branam first publicly hinted at his belief in the serpent Seed doctrine in 1953 he began to openly teach the serpent seed in 1958 I did a research on the table you know the you know the table for brother brandham and the first result that came up when I did the search was from the message the pillar of fire 1953 okay oh big deal it is a big deal okay these things don't happen by coincidence these things are God's Bible declaring in the heavens I mean if we could you know like I started reading um a book on God's Bible in the heavens and I'm really enjoying it like I'm I'm just I want to just you know read it constantly but in there you know like it just shows like without the shadow of a doubt that God wrote everything in the heavens it's all there and if we actually take the time you know to to study it and look into it it's just full of nuggets okay but you know obviously we can't get into all of that but um I found that interesting so the crossing points of the two eclipses of the 21st century which is the the only two that have now taken place that because we're in the 21st century was the one in 2017 and the one in 2024 and you see that you see where they cross there well you look to the just to the right of the cross there there's a place called Rapture Indiana you know I came across that um you know while I was doing the research on the internet and you know because somebody had mentioned that and they actually you know they these people that that kind of on YouTube they went and did a trip and they actually went there they drove to go and see what was actually there it's basically in the middle of nowhere you know but it was kind of funny I was watching it and I was kind of you know laughing because they would come across certain things and and you know as they were going there they came to this one street that was like within a few miles of of rapture Indiana and and the name of the road was Resurrection drive you know and and you know all these little things and they were kind of snickering at it they were laughing at it but they don't realize that that this this is all about the resurrection this is what we've recognized this is what differentiates us from the rest of of the Christian um you know denominational world is that we've recognized that the resurrection is present and here right now and he's resurrected us and taking us into Heavenly places where we can recognize the word recognize what God is doing in our day and it differentiates us completely from the rest of the world Amen so um the the eclipse of Monday actually did pass over Jeffersonville okay but it was only like it was only seen like as a partial eclipse okay very very partial you know and that kind of caught my attention because I thought oh you know didn't brother brandham say a sliver of light you know and it kind of just triggered you know my my thoughts towards that and so um you know for the bride she'll have light in the evening time amen that's what we're feasting on now we know that God has given us light to recognize his word today and so I went into the um into the um search and I found here brother brandham speaking from um the seven Church ages here he said Matthew 24 mentions signs in the heavens concerning this last day just before Jesus comes I wonder if you noticed such a sign recently fulfilled as to portray the very truth we have been discussing the truth is that Jesus has been steadily pushed aside until in the last age he is pushed aside he is pushed outside the church recall that in the first age it was almost a full orbed Church of Truth yet there was little error called there was a little error called the Deeds of the nians that kept the circle from being full then in the next age more Darkness crept in until the ball of light glowed less and darkness covered more of the circle in the third age it was eclipsed still more and in the fourth age which was the Dark Ages the light had all but gone now think on this the church shines in the reflected Light of Christ he is the sun the church is the moon thus this orb of light is the Moon it has decreased from almost a full moon in the first age to a sliver in the fourth age but in the fifth age it began to grow in the sixth age it the great step of growth forward this is when the Reformation started right Luther Wesley and then Pentecost right and then um Christ uh so that instead of light oh sorry to the sliver in the fourth age but in the fifth age began to grow in the sixth it took a great step of growth forward in part of the seventh age it was still growing when suddenly it stopped short and wan to almost a nothingness so that instead of light it was the Blackness of apostasy and at the end of the age it had ceased to shine for the darkness had taken over Christ was now outside the church and we know that if it wasn't for William Mary and brandham coming in the seventh Church age in the leoan church age there would have been total darkness everything was basically going to Darkness but there was going to be a bre pred and God was going to allow a SL a sliver of light to come so that there could be a restoration and this is what has been taking place since 1963 as soon as the prophet's Ministry went into the opening of The Seven Seals that was when the word was opened the seven seal was opened and the Word was being revealed and it started to call every son and daughter of God out of denomination out of you know uh doctrines of man and teachings of man praise God and so the pope now watch he goes on to say here it waned to total darkness in seven stages in the seventh stage the total darkness came as the pope of Rome Paul v 6 went to Palestine that took place in 1964 okay it was in 1964 that the pope went to Palestine the pope is named Paul the 6 Paul was the first messenger and this man goes by the by the name by the same name notice it is the sixth or the number of men this is more than a coincidence and when he went to Jerusalem the moon or the church went into total darkness that was when there was a lunar eclipse that's when it was you know that that the world was basically at its darkest point right when the pope was actually you know going the last time a pope visited the Holy Land um which was in 1964 Jerusalem was a physically divided City with landmines basically separating Palestine and Israel okay they were in they were in like a serious War okay and it was the 1967 you know six- day war that basically you know was another major event but but look at all the timing of all of these things and now look at the timing of where we are today and recognize how Israel is in a complete state of War okay um this war they want they want to divide the land they can never do it we you know we'll look at all that later on as we move along here you know brother brandham here he um in the message Shalom 1964 he says and isn't it strange that just before the pope took his journey to Jerusalem that the moon in the heavens made a total blackout just a few days before he took it his journey he's coming here also you know see now that's never been known see but what does it show that this he's doing this to win Fellowship as he met on the day after he come into Jerusalem he met with the Greek Orthodox hierarchy and what does that reflect Fellowship they're wanting Protestants and Catholicism joining together which they are doing and will completely do and we know that you know this is all part of what's happening with the World Council of churches and them coming together and so forth right so um and God reflected this to us in the moon of a total blackout by his mercy and Grace did any of you see the paper where they took the pictures of the Moon I have it here if it ain't a perfect image leaving out the seventh age which is not yet exactly the way I draw by the Holy Spirit the seven Church ages there's the six of them the seventh is not not finished yet the six conditions of the Moon how it is how in its brightness is the first church age dark in the second third fourth fifth and sixth just the way the holy spirit let me draw them on the board and then identified them with himself on the wall of the Tabernacle two years ago the the the Moon reflects itself and science again picks up the picture of the church Pages just as they picked up that light Yonder and put it in Life Magazine of the opening of the seals of the revealing in the age of the seventh angel and so we're going to be you know as we progress through this um we're going to finish it up on Sunday with you know talking how it all led to the last sign and how we've been given a sign and how the world actually missed the greatest sign but to those that have ears and to those that have representation they can't miss it the opening of the seals and the revealing in the age of the seventh angel in the days of his ministry the seventh messenger the mysteries of God which all the Mysteries has been along the ages should be revealed made manifest it should be at that time and he did it his words don't fail isn't that a mysterious thing God drawing in the heavens the thing the same thing that they hold same God let me draw it on the Blackboard and then by himself that's three times he's perfectly identified and just before the pope goes into Jerusalem which that was the church the Moon is the church represents the church and before the church the shadow of the world crosses the moon and the shadow of the world worldism the shadows of worldly ISM worldly church has swept AC cross to black out the entire light of the Bible the whole world went into absolute darkness when they rejected the word of God Amen praise God the world crossed in the light of the Moon and blinded out the sun and the reflection of the Moon that's supposed to be giving light to the Earth it was blacked out and it come in and draw the pictures just exactly like it did by inspiration before it happened praise God these eclipses over the last seven years I want you to know that they also they also signify the rising of the Bride okay because the the the solar eclipse okay where the where the moon now is coming into its fullness okay there's there's two sides sides to this the Gentile world is coming to the end of the Gentile dispensation if it hasn't already ended we don't know it could already have ended and you know God is just perfecting his bride for the Rapture because the Gentiles they they are now in total darkness unless they receive this Revelation that is in the Bride of Jes Jesus Christ the true church not saying just this church here there's the body of Christ and the bride is is is a is a supernatural body it's a many membered body that's all over the Earth but they're seeing the revelation of this word and they're hearing the voice of God through this message which is a message that calls you back to the word of God a message that tells you that God was progressing in the reformation and has progressed to the 20th century prophet in the in the uh calling out of William Mariam branam a Vindicated Prophet out of America to bring a restored word to call a people back to the original word amen praise God and so we know that um that there's a rise in in women power too okay everything everything remember the church types women women type the church you wanna brother brand would say you want to see the condition of the church just look at the condition of the women that are in the church okay now nothing against women but look at their condition look at their attitudes okay remember the reason why you know people say oh you're talking about women why did William Bram talk about women he was not specific ially talking about women the bride the church is a woman because Christ is the bridegroom Christ is the word and the church is the bride in the bride there's male and female it's not just male it's not just female okay it is the body of Jesus Christ but it's typed in a church and so when we talk about women we're not talking about women specifically we're talking about the condition of the church because the bride is is the is the wife of Jesus Christ okay and so when you see the women completely you know ha half naked going into the churches with mini skirts on showing sex appeal you know showing all of the things that that you know that is that that would cause a man to lust or even a woman these days to lust after one another right it's the condition of the world and it's the condition that that identifies the real true church that's why you know people will will come into our churches and they'll notice that the women they dressed modestly they wear dresses Okay go back into history up until the 1950s 9.8 women that you would ever see walking on the streets would would be wearing a dress it was not until the 60s until you know the great you know Darkness started to really come over the land and and the whole world went into total darkness that that women started to rise up you know started to remove their clothing their their dresses now started to come up higher and higher and higher and they got Tighter and Tighter and Tighter what was it showing it was showing Rebellion it was showing Rebellion against the word of God because the word of God says that a woman should dress modestly you know that that that she should not be dressed in a way that would cause a man to lust after her right these are just you know this is just common uh decency uh in the word of God okay and so here we are now and we're living in the you know in the 21st century and my God you can barely drive down the street and there's you know billboards with with you know like exposed women and and you you know like magazines every time you go into a store you look at the magazines you just just look over and you and you'll see all kinds of exposure right and it's all over the social media it's all over it's taking it's taking a hold of the young people pornography all of these things we're in an age where where where the minds of the people is being completely consumed by by the by the apostasy of God's word amen but the bride she's coming into her fullness and that's why the fullness of the moon and the sun when you look at the Moon and the Sun as as a a true Christian you see the sun typing Christ having your back he stands with you you become one the two are one he's got you he's got you covered because you you you've you've you've accepted him fully you've you've taken the fullness of the word of God and you've allowed yourself to be dressed in the fullness of God's word and in the fullness of his humility upon your life praise God and so these things are are you know things that we need to um recognize that um that that give us you know and allow us to hear God's word through these events let's go to the next slide this one here is the most recent eclipse that took place on Monday and all of those yellow and red dots are ninas that kind of they were in the path not directly in the totality but in the path okay and if we go to um to the next slide Luke 11: 28-32 Jesus he says here but he said yay rather blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it now you got to understand the time that he was in and who he was talking to and when the people were gathered thick together in other words there was a big crowd okay and here he was Jesus was on the earth in his public Ministry all right he began to say this is an e evil generation okay well I could just imagine if you could look into this generation and see the condition of the global world and the condition of the people and the condition of the confusion between you know same sex and you know genders all kinds of different genders you want to talk about a a perverse like you know it's a perverse generation okay they've gone into total where the word of God has is absolutely it's just of none effect to the people anymore and here he's speaking he says this is an evil generation and they seek a sign that's why you know whenever there's you know these these eclipses and total solar eclipses or signs in the heavens everybody gets attracted to them everybody gets excited everybody wants to go see them thinking oh we're gonna you you know something is going to happen here and and then an earthquake takes place and they oh I wonder if that has anything to do with it you know because they're looking for signs but they've missed the real sign which is Jesus Christ the whole purpose of this whole world and the existence of this whole world surrounds the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and he says they seek a sign and there shall no sign be given it but the sign of Jonas the prophet for as Jonah was in the was in the uh for as Jonah was a sign unto the ninevites so shall also the son of man be to this generation the queen of the South shall rise up in the Judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold old a greater than Solomon is here praise God the men of Nineveh shall rise up in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for they repented at the preaching of Jonah and behold a greater than Jonah is here I want to say that you know God has sent a second sign to to America okay in 2024 and you know passing over those ninas I mean are they significant yes they are significant in that we have a revelation of what took place in Nineveh okay God had to send a prophet into Nineveh okay and um you can go to the next slide and and I want you to notice go to the next slide there brother brandham here he says and then every sign has a voice behind it and the voice must be a scriptural voice the same as it must be a scriptural sign and then the sign is accompanied by a voice like Moses when he went down into Egypt the voice of the first sign the voice of the second sign and every great thing that happens with God that giv gives a sign there's a voice follows that sign like Jonah when he was delivered from the belly of the whale that was a sign then his voice was repent or in 40 days you'll perish so there's always the voice going with the sign amen praise God and you know it was interesting because I I came across this in Exodus 4:28 you know and 428 there's that 428 again April the 28th you read Exodus 28 and it shall come to pass if they will not believe thee neither hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the voice of the of the latter sign in other words the second sign I believe God is sending a second sign to America and to the world through the Bride of Jesus Christ and that same message uh that that God gave to to Jonah was was Resurrection was that they were to repent that if there if listen if you're a son or a daughter of God out there you need to recognize the word of God for this day and for this hour and you need to repent and you need to turn to God you need to give your heart to Jesus Christ because he's calling you to place you and to use you in this day and in this hour you're actually assigned to this generation amen praise God and so here um sorry slide 16 if you could go to slide 16 so here now remember he said that that uh that uh Nineveh they're going to raise up because they did repent so what he's saying is that this generation is not going to repent they're not able to repent this this America this America cannot repent as a nation it it won't happen okay it's going to it's going to go into complete and total um tribulation unfortunately but those that are that are Sons and Daughters of God they're going to be called out and they're going to come out all right now I want you to notice we're just going to talk about Nineveh for a few minutes okay because from there we're pulling out this is Bible study tonight so you're not getting like you know like that uh kind of fire and you know this is just kind of things that that you can draw from it and let the Holy Spirit give you what you have need of Amen but there was actually a solar eclipse that took place back in the day of Jonah it was in seven because they're able now to calculate with NASA and with the planets and the way that everything has you know um repetition they were able to actually go back and they found that there was actually um an eclipse that took place back at the same time and Jonah in the Bible one specific clue as to when he lived was during the reign of jeroboam thei which was somewhere between 786 and 746 BCE okay before Christ if we take 2 Kings 14:25 as evidence of the latest that he could have prophesied okay so you can go back now there's over 2700 years ago that this Eclipse appeared over the Skies of ancient Assyria and it may have played a key role in the ancient city of nineveh's turn to God in Repentance okay so it's interesting if the historical and astronomical calculations are correct it means that the eclipse occurred when Syria was in a time of national upheaval and internal ter turmoil okay if you go back into the scriptures you'll see that they actually were okay nineveh's guilt was concerning Assyria oppression against the Jewish people taking them into captivity to Assyria and exiling and exiling them from their Homeland Israel okay and it's the same thing now they're they're they're trying to annihilate Israel okay the whole goal of Hamas and Hezbollah and Isis and all these you know the the the the the Iranian backed um groups they're all they only have one purpose they want to literally annihilate Israel okay just like Satan our enemy wants to annihilate us that's why you know the battles are Fierce sometimes you got to press through the battles you know but that's all part of of of the reproach for the word of God Amen praise God but here Nineveh was the capital of the city of Assyria okay in the modern days ancient Nineveh is on the Eastern Bank of the Tigris River close to the modern day of a city of uh mo mo mosul in Iraq okay so in in 721 BC Assyria swept down out of the North captured the Northern Kingdom of Israel and took 10 tribes into Exile and the Assyrians then occupied the towns and Villages of Northern Israel okay and so you know through this archaeolog archaeological scholar uh Mr wisman he was um you know part of the the British Museum and leading expert on a Syria culture documents his research that a solar eclipse did in fact occur over Nineveh the capital of the Assyrian cap uh Empire what's not mentioned in the Book of Jonah but is recorded in ass Syria's historical records and is known to nasau and modern astronomers is that before Jonah's visit a solar eclipse occurred okay the first Assyrian Eclipse was on June 24th 791 BC and it and it covered 74% of of the Sun the second solar eclipse was in June 763 BC and it covered 98.7 and that was the the time that they're kind of putting for Jonah that he actually went into Nineveh so significance is that you know because here we are and Nineveh is on the map 7 times and for us we know that it's it's the Revelation behind it okay and we we also know that the the the the sign of Jonah was the resurrection right and that Christ resurrected and now Christ is living in us and now we are the we are the the the resurrected bride of Jesus Christ restored back to the word of God Amen and now we are the sign that's on the earth and a lot of people will run into you at work they'll run into you you know when when you're out with family and friends and they don't really recognize that inside of you is is a revelation of exactly what God is doing in this hour and that you are actually that sign to this generation praise God hallelujah Jonah oh by the way another thing that I noticed that it passed over Jeffersonville at exactly 37 which was the the the most part of the of the eclipse that they could see I got that right off of the timeline and I went in and I thought I wonder when it's if first of all I said I wonder if it's passing over Jeffersonville and then and then how much of it was passing over Jeffersonville and then the time caught my attention 307 you look at Amos 3:7 God does nothing unless he reveals it unto his servants the prophets Jonah 3:7 to 10 okay I'll read it here and he caused it to be proclaimed and published throughout Nineveh by the decree of the king and his Noble saying let neither man nor Beast herd nor flock taste anything do not let them eat or drink water but let men and beasts be covered with sackcloth and cry mightily to God yes let everyone turn from his evil way and from the violence that is in in his hands who can tell if God will turn and relent and turn away uh from his Fierce anger so that we may not perish you know America has no hope as a nation okay there's there's there's things that are happening this year that are very very significant all of these signs all the the you know the the the seven Salems seven years ago go and here we are now exactly seven years later God works in seven seven seven and here we are now and you know that if you go another seven years it puts us right basically at 2030 to 31 and and that's exactly 100 years or 2,000 years that the Lord was crucified and Rose and so now I'm not saying that you know everything's going to happen happen in 2030 or 31 I'm telling you it's happening right now we're in the midst of the Rapture you've already been raptured you've already been called out of your home you've already been been you already heard this message that that that Jonah was talking here and then God saw their works that they turned from their evil way and God relented from the disaster that he would bring upon them and he did not not do it aren't you glad that God you know came to you that he that he revealed his word to you it caused you to repent and turn from from your wicked ways and to turn from from you know your your understanding of man's teachings on the word of God and allowed you to to to wake up and recognize the hour that you're living in and and and that your life changed right from that moment your your future became clear you know you you knew now that all of a sudden that you know death had no more sting over you you were you were totally you know free of the of the sting of death you know as a son or daughter of God you should not fear death death is death is not something that we fear but then it's not something that we go running after either you know a lot of people they want to give up oh I'd rather be dead than deal with this you know or if this comes I'm just going to kill myself they haven't they haven't found the Shalom they haven't found the prince of peace they need to know that there's somebody that can take all your burdens and and he'll take those burdens and he will he will wipe your sins away to the point where you've never he doesn't even remember them anymore that's how powerful our God is amen and so knowing now that a total solar eclipse foreshadowed Jonah's preaching to the ancient nevas in 763 BC is it tempting to note the parallels of Nineveh and America today internal and external upheavals and civil unrest uh uh threatened them as well as the USA you know that if you go back and actually research you know um this path of the nevas okay where where it actually comes in and you know where it actually goes out and they've they've you know where 2017 came in and where where 20 um 24 goes out there's all kinds of of of um Clues as to the potential for another civil war to break out in the United States of America right now okay there's there's turmoil within the United States of America I experienced it I went I went into the United States there uh uh you know last month sister Jennifer and I were in Florida and we met people and um you know people and family that we have there and they're very strong supporters of President the future um the former president Trump and they said clearly they told us they said he is the only hope for America he is the only hope for America if he does not get elected as the President of the United States in November of 2024 the whole United States is going to go into Civil War this is what this individual was telling me he says I know people that are buying arms that are putting away ammunitions that are preparing for all kinds of of uh uh things to rise up uh you know if this doesn't go their way and a lot of military people okay remember military people are patriots that's why they were willing to give their lives for their country okay so you got to understand the the the mentality and the thinking behind you know these these people okay especially those that are in the military and you've got you know these people have guns and and ammunition and all kinds and they're ready just like you know we saw a little you know what what happened there in the Insurrection there when they went and and they stormed you know the Senate right that was just you know a a small sign of potentially what could happen if Trump doesn't get elected okay I'm just saying that we've already voted for for our president it's the Lord Jesus Christ amen man aren't you glad let the musicians come up we don't we don't we don't worry about the elections we're not concerned about you know um all the details of it and getting involved and getting into all kinds of you know debates over it and everything else we know exactly what's going to happen all right and so the one thing that you know as we close here the one thing that we need to be aware of is brother brandham said watch Israel that is a super sign to us we should be recognizing and knowing that that whatever they're trying to do against Israel in dividing the land unfortunately God says no it's not going to happen Okay in Joel chapter 3 veres 1 to3 prophecies prophesies to us when and how the tribulation period will begin it deals with God's covenant he made with his people the children of Israel the god of Israel tells us clearly and directly why he judges the nations in Joel 3 1-2 for behold in those days and at the end time when I bring back the captives of Judah and Jerusalem I will also gather all Nations and bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat and I will enter into judgment with them there it's talking about you know when they surround Israel and when they come against Israel and when the Nations all decide that they're going to come against Israel guess who they're going to be meeting the same just like they did when they when they tried to overcome them in 1967 just like they did when they tried to overcome in 1948 Israel prevailed because of a supernatural intervention from God the bride of Christ the True Church of God will prevail and overcome because Christ is with her all right all the denominations all the World Council of churches they can come together and they can declare that they have a trinity and that they have their own doctrines and that they will govern and rule the church in their own way but God says my church will hear my voice and they will recognize my word and they will stand on my word and because they stand for me I will stand for them and Israel on account of my people my Heritage Israel whom they have scattered among the Nations they have also divided up my land behold I will make Jerusalem a cup of drunkenness to all the surrounding people when they lay Siege against Judah and Jerusalem and it shall happen in that day that I will make Jerusalem a very heavy stone for all people oh what a revelation praise God all who would heave it away will surely be cut in pieces though all nations of the Earth are gathered against it Zechariah 12 the Lord is warning very clearly and very directly here not to divide Jerusalem not to try and and and break up or destroy my people you can't do it or judgment is going to result amen praise
