[22:32] each and every one of you
[22:35] tonight I took
[22:38] a little uh
[22:41] drink of water in there and it went down
[22:43] the wrong throat down the wrong
[22:46] side it's going to take a minute praise
[22:50] God but um so we're here Wednesday night
[22:53] it's a Bible study night amen amen and
[22:57] so um we're going to we're going to stay
[22:58] on the uh the same uh topic that we
[23:01] started there a few weeks ago on the
[23:03] Oneness of
[23:05] God and so um we will get started right
[23:08] away praise God Wednesday nights our
[23:10] Bible study so we want to study the word
[23:13] we want to look at aspects of the word
[23:16] of God that helps us to better
[23:19] understand um if we don't
[23:21] know the god that we are serving in and
[23:27] by revelation
[23:29] then we will miss the element um which
[23:33] includes our part in the word of God and
[23:38] why it is that we
[23:40] serve this God that we know as the Lord
[23:43] Jesus Christ
[23:45] amen and so um before uh we go to the
[23:50] word let's just pray
[23:51] father we just appreciate
[23:55] Lord this opportunity
[23:59] to minister your word once
[24:01] again and to search the scriptures for
[24:05] you said within them we think we have
[24:08] eternal life and Lord we want to make
[24:12] sure we want to make certain what it is
[24:16] that we believe father and Lord I know
[24:18] there's a great controversy around this
[24:21] very
[24:22] subject because many believe Lord that
[24:25] there's a trinity that there's three in
[24:29] one but we ask you tonight Lord to come
[24:33] and bring Clarity to your word so that
[24:35] we can know assuredly who it is that we
[24:39] serve and that the revelation of your
[24:43] spirit the purpose that you had in
[24:46] revealing yourself and why it is so
[24:48] important for us to know you in this way
[24:52] father Grant it tonight Lord open your
[24:55] word unveil yourself
[24:58] we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and
[25:00] Lord
[25:02] remember uh the saints that are not well
[25:05] tonight Lord that you would raise them
[25:07] up father remember brother Tim um with
[25:10] this situation with his tooth father may
[25:13] you just move on the scene and and
[25:15] Quicken that whole situation for him
[25:18] Lord remember Sister Sheila elanga Lord
[25:22] that's um uh in the hospital even now
[25:24] Lord uh because you made a way for her
[25:27] to have a special special
[25:30] procedure Lord that will um
[25:33] literally put this sickness and this
[25:37] this demon because we know that all
[25:40] sickness is of the
[25:42] devil and Lord to put this thing finally
[25:46] completely out of her life and so we ask
[25:50] that your spirit and your anointing will
[25:52] move over her and the doctors that will
[25:55] be doing this critical surgery
[25:59] upon her oh God Lord take control you be
[26:03] the great physician in the midst of her
[26:05] situation and Lord let her come back
[26:08] with a tremendous testimony of your
[26:11] goodness and your grace Lord and how you
[26:13] interceded in her life father the enemy
[26:16] is fighting but greater are you
[26:19] Lord we commit her into your hands and
[26:23] we ask your blessing now in Jesus name
[26:26] amen you may be seated there let's just
[26:28] read the word quickly before you were
[26:29] seated uh bring up the first
[26:33] scripture 1 Timothy
[26:39] 3:16 Says and without controversy great
[26:43] is the
[26:44] mystery of godliness God was
[26:48] manifest In the Flesh God bless you may
[26:51] be
[26:52] seated amen praise
[26:55] God what a tremendous mystery
[26:59] that God would um you know have this
[27:03] amazing Plan of
[27:04] Redemption and that he would include us
[27:08] in that
[27:09] plan so that we could know him in the
[27:13] power of his
[27:15] resurrection that he um having this
[27:18] tremendous plan would have to come into
[27:20] human
[27:21] flesh and you know we're not going to
[27:23] get into um you know uh everything
[27:26] that's in my mind right now with respect
[27:28] respect to this very thought because I
[27:30] believe the Lord is leading me into a
[27:32] message um you know maybe in the next
[27:35] couple weeks
[27:38] but
[27:40] God in the
[27:43] beginning had a plan to be a savior and
[27:48] to be a redeemer and to be a
[27:50] Healer and that plan was all put into
[27:55] his was all in his mind and he wanted it
[27:58] all to be expressed here down on the
[28:01] earth and
[28:03] so his plan of becoming flesh when he
[28:08] was thinking of this whole plan we were
[28:12] there we were a part of that plan we
[28:14] were in his mind and this whole Plan of
[28:18] Redemption included you and that you
[28:21] would be a part you would be an
[28:24] attribute that would be expressed at a
[28:27] certain time time and season to where
[28:30] you would become the word for your day
[28:33] am amen and that's why it's so important
[28:36] to understand who God is because when
[28:39] you place him
[28:42] outside of of your understanding and you
[28:47] take man's interpretation or man's
[28:49] Doctrine on it you've placed yourself
[28:52] outside of
[28:54] him but when you when you uh come to a
[28:57] place place where you've recognized
[28:59] Jesus Christ in the present stage of his
[29:02] ministry and that you were actually
[29:04] included in his thoughts and in his mind
[29:07] it brings you into a complete different
[29:11] personal relationship with God to where
[29:14] you start to understand why you are a
[29:17] Christian and what is the true
[29:21] experience of being Christlike because
[29:24] that's what the word Christian means and
[29:27] so there there's a there's there's an
[29:29] unveiling of God's thoughts and God's
[29:32] plan that included you and the Very fact
[29:36] that you are an attribute of
[29:38] God makes you a part of God and your
[29:43] time that you come into your part in
[29:47] recognizing the word is because you've
[29:49] actually come into the very thought that
[29:52] he had of
[29:54] you before the foundations of the world
[29:57] the very thought in the way that he saw
[29:59] you coming to the word in this time and
[30:03] in this season and then you start to
[30:05] manifest Jesus Christ in your life
[30:08] that's the true definition of a
[30:10] Christian is when they manifest the word
[30:13] they manifest Christ amen praise God and
[30:18] so um you know it's a it's a wonderful
[30:20] thing when we uh Truly Come into that
[30:23] understanding let's go to the next slide
[30:25] we wna we want to focus here on who God
[30:28] is and the Oneness of God in Hebrews
[30:32] chapter 7 verses 1 to4 it says for this
[30:36] MDC king of Salem priest of the most
[30:40] high God who met Abraham returning from
[30:43] the slaughter of the Kings and blessed
[30:47] him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth
[30:51] part of all first being by
[30:54] interpretation king of righteousness and
[30:57] after that also king of Salem which is
[31:00] king of peace now now this is what I
[31:04] want you to see here without
[31:06] father without
[31:09] mother without dissent having neither
[31:12] beginning of days nor end of life but
[31:15] made like unto the Son of God AB abideth
[31:20] a priest so here he is making very clear
[31:23] here this is in the New Testament the
[31:25] book of Hebrews Paul's talking here here
[31:28] and he's making very clear here who this
[31:30] MDC is it was God it was God that came
[31:35] down to meet Abraham to make himself
[31:39] known and to show that that that he was
[31:42] making a promise to Abraham into his
[31:45] seed that he would inherit the earth and
[31:48] that he was an actual Son of God Amen
[31:52] and here it was mzc it was God that come
[31:56] down in his theop
[31:59] form one like
[32:02] unto the Son of God so how could he be
[32:06] like unto the Son of God he was God
[32:11] MDC was God am it was God coming down
[32:15] for the first time to meet with man in
[32:21] human flesh man that was in human flesh
[32:24] and he was he was he came he he with
[32:28] Abraham he ate with Abraham they they
[32:31] they drank and they ate together amen it
[32:35] was showing that God could actually move
[32:38] between Dimensions that God could come
[32:41] from his his uh position as the almighty
[32:46] God the the the Elohim the self-existent
[32:49] one that he could express himself into
[32:52] the form of a man and sit and talk with
[32:55] Abraham amen amen and and abideth the
[32:58] priest
[32:59] continually now consider how great this
[33:03] man was unto whom even the patriarch
[33:06] Abraham gave the tenth of his spoils see
[33:10] Abraham had a revelation that he had met
[33:13] God Abraham staggered not at the
[33:16] promises of God he knew that this was
[33:20] the creator of Heaven and Earth he had
[33:22] come into a relationship and and here he
[33:25] was talking lip to ear to God Amen God
[33:29] was showing that he was going to reveal
[33:31] himself make himself known unto man and
[33:34] that he was going to come and re and and
[33:36] redeem man amen let's go to the next
[33:41] slide
[33:43] so here
[33:46] mzc when Jesus was listen to brother
[33:48] Bram says when Jesus was manifested in
[33:51] the Old Testament look he's talking
[33:53] about Jesus manifesting in the Old
[33:56] Testament in a theophany in the person
[34:00] of
[34:01] MDC Jesus was and is God from the very
[34:07] beginning right to the very end not a
[34:10] priesthood but the person the man see
[34:14] for this man had yet not been
[34:18] born but he was in a theophany so he had
[34:21] no father no mother he was God himself
[34:26] amen praise God he was manifested in the
[34:30] form of a man called King of Salem which
[34:34] is king of peace and king of
[34:36] righteousness see he was
[34:39] MDC he had neither father nor mother nor
[34:43] beginning of days nor ending of Life see
[34:46] it was Jesus in a theophany in the form
[34:50] of a
[34:51] man could you go
[34:54] that
[34:56] amen so
[34:58] question how did God ever become our
[35:02] savior because you know they believe
[35:05] that there's there's there's there's a
[35:07] trinity and that there's God the Father
[35:10] the Son and the Holy Spirit so how many
[35:13] saviors is there just one there's only
[35:16] one savior just one amen did we have two
[35:19] saviors Jesus came upon the when Jesus
[35:24] came upon the Earth no
[35:28] Jesus Jehovah Savior Jesus means Jehovah
[35:33] Our Savior amen it was God made flesh
[35:38] come down to become a man so that he
[35:40] could go to Calvary to take our place
[35:43] and make the sacrifice
[35:47] amen so listen to Isaiah 4310 and
[35:52] 11 it's very clear right here before me
[35:55] there was no God formed
[35:58] neither shall there be after me it
[36:01] doesn't say us does it say after us no
[36:04] it says after me I even I am the Lord
[36:10] and beside me there is no
[36:13] savior oh this is back in the Old
[36:16] Testament but I thought Jesus was our
[36:20] savior no God is Jesus am Jesus is God
[36:28] that's why when philli went to Jesus and
[36:30] he says oh Lord show us the father he
[36:33] says Phillip have I not been with you so
[36:36] long if you see me You' seen the
[36:39] father it's I that that speaketh to thee
[36:43] amen praise
[36:45] God next
[36:48] slide why did he need to become a man
[36:52] why did God have to become
[36:55] man and almost All Things Are by the law
[36:59] purged with blood and without the
[37:02] shedding of blood there is no remission
[37:04] of
[37:05] sins God had to come and become man so
[37:10] that he could go to the Cross as a man
[37:14] because a man sinned a man died God
[37:16] could not change his Plan of
[37:19] Redemption God could not change his ways
[37:22] he's the same yesterday today and
[37:24] forever everything that he expressed in
[37:27] the Garden of Eden when he expressed it
[37:29] through Adam and Eve that was all a a
[37:34] shadow of what was to come that's why
[37:36] when Abel was born and made the
[37:39] acceptable Sacrifice by taking a lamb
[37:43] and shedding the blood of that Lamb on
[37:45] the Altar and offering it unto the Lord
[37:47] is because he received a revelation from
[37:50] God what was required and knew that it
[37:53] would have to be the Lamb of God that
[37:55] would come down the road
[37:58] to shed his blood and to take our place
[38:02] so that we could be restored back into
[38:04] our rightful position as Sons and
[38:07] Daughters of
[38:09] God so it's just to make clear here
[38:12] that's why he had to come and become man
[38:16] because blood had to be
[38:18] sacrificed amen that's why the Jews they
[38:22] always brought Lambs doves goats uh and
[38:26] Bulls they they they had to sacrifice
[38:28] something had to die in order for for
[38:31] for for sin to be to be covered it was
[38:35] only being covered because it was all a
[38:37] type they were showing that they would
[38:39] bring the blood at bring it to the Altar
[38:42] and that lamb they would lay their hands
[38:44] upon that lamb and the priest would slit
[38:46] the throat of that lamb and the life
[38:48] would come out of the lamb and the
[38:50] innocence of the Lamb would would
[38:53] cover the sinner that would bring the
[38:56] lamb
[38:58] and that would be a covering for their
[39:00] sin but Jesus Christ when he came when
[39:03] God came he came as God and he he he
[39:07] wiped away our sin amen he took it and
[39:11] and and when when he went to the cross
[39:13] and he died you were still in him amen
[39:16] let's move along
[39:20] here and
[39:22] so God became human
[39:28] God is a
[39:30] spirit he had no hands till he become
[39:35] Jesus he had no feet arms legs and so
[39:38] forth till he become Jesus he come to a
[39:42] stable born over a manure pile and
[39:45] little Jehovah Crying In A Manger little
[39:47] Jehovah playing as a boy little Jehovah
[39:51] toiling as a
[39:52] man he crossed his cast with us God
[39:57] became human when Jesus Christ was born
[40:01] God was human on earth he toiled and
[40:05] labored and felt for the
[40:08] teenager he went through every
[40:10] Temptation that we go
[40:13] through God did it that he might do his
[40:16] own judgment
[40:18] Justice he swore by no one else but by
[40:22] himself he said I am going to take care
[40:25] of this I am going to redeem
[40:27] I am going to be the healer I am going
[40:30] to be their savior amen praise God if it
[40:34] wasn't for that we would be
[40:36] lost God became human
[40:44] amen and that great Creator became my
[40:47] savior come down to a little blood cell
[40:51] not through a man but come virgin to a
[40:54] woman and took this little pollen from
[40:57] the woman and formed himself a little
[41:01] house and lived in it oh it ought to be
[41:05] striking Jehovah over a pile of manure
[41:09] in a barn crying Jehovah in a Manger of
[41:14] straw that's an everlasting
[41:17] sign praise God listen to Isaiah
[41:21] 996 For unto us a child is
[41:25] born unto us a son
[41:27] is given and the government shall be
[41:30] upon his shoulder and his name Shall be
[41:33] Called wonderful counselor the Mighty
[41:36] God the Everlasting father the Prince of
[41:39] Peace who who are they talking about
[41:41] here they're talking about the Lord
[41:43] Jesus they're talking about God the the
[41:47] Everlasting
[41:50] father but I thought Jesus was the
[41:53] son no he was expressing himself
[41:58] God condescended himself and came down
[42:01] to become human flesh amen but he's
[42:05] still God it's all God in the Plan of
[42:09] Redemption amen praise
[42:11] God let's move
[42:15] along he just used Mary as an
[42:19] incubator but the child belonged to God
[42:23] yeah he was the creator of both egg and
[42:26] hemoglobin
[42:28] God created
[42:29] both amen and the hemoglobin of course
[42:33] come from the male sex and he was the
[42:36] creator of that and Mary was brought
[42:39] this baby without any sensation no more
[42:42] than the Holy Ghost overshadowing her
[42:45] and creating in her womb this blood cell
[42:49] and egg that brought forth the man
[42:51] Christ Jesus Mary was an
[42:55] incubator she was only a carrier Mary is
[42:58] not the mother of God they want to call
[43:02] Mary the Mother of God God cannot have a
[43:05] mother we just read the scripture that
[43:08] said that MDC was without mother without
[43:11] father without beginning and Without End
[43:14] so how can the Savior have a mother no
[43:19] God wanted to create himself a human
[43:23] vessel that had to come flesh and blood
[43:28] so that it could go to Calvary Flesh and
[43:31] Blood God can't die God could not go to
[43:35] Calvary he needed himself a body to go
[43:38] to Calvary amen and that's why he
[43:41] created himself and it's a type when
[43:44] that when he went to Mary he was showing
[43:47] to Mary the actual way that he could
[43:50] bring forth sons of
[43:53] God because we bypassed our theophany
[43:57] body back in the Garden of
[44:00] Eden listen what do you think Satan was
[44:02] doing when the serpent who was Satan
[44:06] went to
[44:07] Eve and spoke to her and said you can be
[44:10] like God you see Satan had tapped into
[44:14] what God was going to
[44:16] do Satan was there and could hear God
[44:21] speaking to the attributes of God
[44:23] speaking about this Plan of Redemption
[44:25] telling them hey you you're to go down
[44:27] to the Earth and you know you're going
[44:29] to go into a spiritual Amnesia you're
[44:31] going to forget me but but I'm going to
[44:33] be your savior I can imagine him just
[44:35] talking to us telling us about this
[44:38] great
[44:39] plan who knows how many other plans were
[44:42] before that
[44:43] one that's why there's there's there's
[44:46] proof that this Earth could be millions
[44:48] of years there's proof that there was
[44:50] other civilizations but that doesn't
[44:53] that doesn't pertain to us it's like
[44:56] when you go and you're going to a to to
[44:58] a ball game and you're and you're in
[45:01] you're you're a part of that team and
[45:03] you're at that particular ball game it's
[45:06] not going to do you any good about
[45:08] talking about the other ball games it's
[45:10] the one that pertains to you it's when
[45:12] you get called to go up to bat now it's
[45:15] your turn to prove yourself because the
[45:17] game is
[45:18] on I'm just using an analogy
[45:22] there so here Satan goes up to Eve and
[45:26] and tell tells her that she can actually
[45:29] be like
[45:30] God what do you think he was telling
[45:33] her he was telling her that you can
[45:36] bring forth the sons of God you can you
[45:40] can create like God and that's why he
[45:43] defiled her and it wasn't an apple that
[45:46] she ate but it was actually an adultery
[45:49] that took place right there in the
[45:51] Garden of Eden when the serpent went to
[45:53] Eve and said I can show you how you can
[45:57] bring forth sons of
[45:59] God that's why when we see the way that
[46:03] the way that the the angel of the Lord
[46:05] the way that that the spirit of God came
[46:08] over Mary and said Thou shalt bring
[46:11] forth a son Adam in the image of God all
[46:16] he would have had to do was go and speak
[46:19] to Eve because we were attributes in
[46:22] that other dimension amen and God had
[46:25] created this Earthly Dimension here
[46:28] where there's time space and matter and
[46:32] and and all Adam would have had to do
[46:34] was go to Eve and speak to her and she
[46:37] would have brought forth a son right
[46:40] there it would have been if if if they
[46:41] needed a flesh and Bone body it could
[46:45] have just been created right there and
[46:46] then because
[46:48] remember they were not flesh and
[46:51] blood when Adam was expressed in the
[46:54] image of God he was
[46:57] actually just a human expression in the
[47:01] form of a
[47:03] theophany and when he took Eve from from
[47:06] his side there wasn't any blood
[47:09] involved the blood came as a result of
[47:12] the
[47:14] Fall because because death comes when
[47:18] the life leaves the body now the life
[47:21] that was in Adam and Eve was no longer
[47:25] eternal
[47:27] because God said the day you eat thereof
[47:30] the day you disbelieve the word of God
[47:32] death is going to set in you shall
[47:34] surely die they were no longer
[47:37] veiled look what happens Adam and Eve
[47:41] the serpent beguiles Eve makes love to
[47:44] her inseminates her with serpent
[47:47] seed okay and then she goes and shows it
[47:51] to Adam and does the same thing with
[47:53] Adam and that's why there was two seeds
[47:56] in
[47:57] in uh uh Eve one which was the serpent
[48:01] seed which brought forth Cain and the
[48:03] other which was Abel which was the seed
[48:07] of
[48:08] Adam that was the promised
[48:12] seed Cain was not from Adam Cain was
[48:18] from the serpent that's why the Bible
[48:19] says you know when Jesus is talking
[48:22] you're you're of your father the devil
[48:24] he was a liar from the beginning when he
[48:26] was rebuking the
[48:28] Pharisees who was the first liar in the
[48:31] Bible the
[48:33] serpent and here he goes and he perverts
[48:36] the plan of God he wants to be like God
[48:39] so he says oh God is going to bring
[48:41] forth Sons remember the whole Plan of
[48:44] Redemption is calling you back to your
[48:48] rightful position as a Son of God you
[48:51] bypassed your theophany body now God Is
[48:55] Calling You by his word
[48:57] but he's not calling this human he's
[49:00] calling the attribute that he placed in
[49:02] you before the foundation before when
[49:05] you came into this Earth You came
[49:07] through a a human body through your
[49:09] mother and your father but it wasn't
[49:11] until you took that Breath of Life when
[49:14] you came out of the womb of your mother
[49:17] and you took that Breath of Life in that
[49:20] Breath of Life there was an attribute of
[49:23] God it's not in every birth it's not
[49:27] that's why there's children of God on
[49:29] the earth and there are children of the
[49:32] wicked one that come through the through
[49:35] the original sin the original sin was
[49:38] adultery procreation that was not the
[49:41] perfect plan of God but it
[49:44] was that's the Paradox he wanted to be a
[49:47] redeemer so in order for him to be a
[49:49] redeemer and a savior something had to
[49:51] fall so he allowed Satan to be the one
[49:57] to use to bring about the fall you see
[50:01] this is this is the the plan of God you
[50:04] know don't don't try to uh you know well
[50:07] why did God do this you know why would
[50:09] God do all of this you know why did all
[50:12] of a sudden he decides that he wants to
[50:13] be a Healer wants to be a
[50:16] redeemer I don't
[50:19] know that's God Amen these are some
[50:23] listen there's things that you're just
[50:24] not going to be able to fully
[50:27] comprehend but all we know is that he
[50:29] wanted to be a Healer he wanted to be a
[50:32] savior and that's why we're living in
[50:34] this plan here on Earth and everything
[50:36] is about salvation and that there's no
[50:39] other Sal there's no other savior but by
[50:43] Jesus Christ your birth certificate
[50:45] Bears record of it the the churches are
[50:48] out there they're all talking about it
[50:50] you know Jesus is the one and only true
[50:56] way
[50:57] to back
[50:58] to Heaven back to your rightful position
[51:02] back to
[51:04] Eternal
[51:06] state where we are going to be like God
[51:09] and back like God
[51:11] again so this whole plan was perverted
[51:14] by Satan the serpent comes in he
[51:17] perverts the plan brings forth now where
[51:21] death sets in and now children are born
[51:25] by Pro creation which is through a woman
[51:29] and a man coming
[51:30] together and bringing forth
[51:33] children but that was the perversion of
[51:38] what God is actually doing now that's
[51:41] why you hear you must be born
[51:45] again oh so like like you know like uh
[51:50] uh you mean I got to go back and and and
[51:53] be born again like is that is that like
[51:56] uh reincarnation or is that like how
[51:58] does that work no you need to be birthed
[52:02] by the word of God supernaturally the
[52:05] word of God's got to come to you and if
[52:07] there's a seed of God
[52:10] there then it'll get germinated by the
[52:13] word of God and you will respond to the
[52:17] word and you will bring forth a new
[52:21] birth a new life that's why a lot of
[52:24] people once you've been born again
[52:25] people say I don't know know this person
[52:28] anymore but it but but it's but it's
[52:31] it's Bill but but yet he's not the same
[52:34] bill that I knew like he was a
[52:36] Shyer and today he's like serving the
[52:39] lord all the
[52:41] time you see it's the new birth brings
[52:45] forth a brand new life it actually
[52:47] brings forth a son or a daughter of
[52:52] God and so we need to understand what
[52:55] actually took place in the Garden of
[52:57] Eden Satan wanted to be a Creator and so
[53:02] the only way that he could do it was to
[53:04] use the law of God's word which said let
[53:07] every seed bring forth of its own kind
[53:10] he heard when God said let there be this
[53:13] let there be that let let every seed
[53:15] bring forth of his own kind when when he
[53:17] created the animals and everything said
[53:20] ah okay so now I know how I can how I
[53:23] can get myself into this plan and and
[53:27] cause problems and that's why if you
[53:29] look at the curse that when God came all
[53:33] of a sudden why is it that Adam and Eve
[53:36] had to go and cover themselves and cover
[53:38] their private
[53:41] parts after the sin took
[53:44] place because they were veiled by God
[53:48] they were in they were in they were
[53:50] veiled by eternal
[53:52] life when they were in the form of their
[53:55] theophany they were
[53:57] Eternal there was no death there was no
[54:02] nakedness because there was no such
[54:05] thing as creation by
[54:08] sexual
[54:10] order but all of a sudden the sin takes
[54:14] place Adam and Eve got to go hide
[54:16] themselves and says Adam where are
[54:19] you why are you hiding
[54:22] yourself what's have you gone and done
[54:24] what I said you should not do you see
[54:27] the
[54:28] veil of eternal life fell away from them
[54:33] and all of a sudden they knew that they
[54:35] were
[54:38] naked well if eating apples opens our
[54:43] eyes to to to naked why how come you
[54:47] know it doesn't do it today do you see
[54:49] what I'm
[54:50] saying you just have to allow the Holy
[54:53] Spirit that's why it's important you
[54:55] know we we're looking into the Oneness
[54:57] of God but you see what's coming out of
[54:59] it you see how important it is to
[55:02] understand who God really is until God
[55:06] listen you can't figure out God let's
[55:08] just make this straight right now don't
[55:11] you think for one minute that you can
[55:13] figure out
[55:15] God even us ministers we come up here we
[55:19] are relying on the divine revelation and
[55:22] inspiration of the Holy Spirit to give
[55:25] us what we have need of in order to feed
[55:29] the body because this is a a body this
[55:33] is a body movement this is the the the
[55:35] the many membered mystical body of Jesus
[55:39] Christ we can't figure out
[55:42] God that's why the whole Plan of
[55:45] Redemption is something that Satan
[55:47] cannot you see Satan has always been
[55:50] coming and impersonating what God is
[55:53] doing and that's why he would always
[55:54] infiltrate the churches infiltrate with
[55:57] coming in with their own doctrines God
[56:00] is one nope he wants to make them three
[56:03] you know he wants to he wants to make
[56:05] sure that whatever God's word says he
[56:08] wants to make sure to just add his own
[56:11] twist to it so that now it it can have
[56:15] none
[56:16] effect but but God has
[56:19] seeds remember we spoke on Sunday that
[56:22] the garden was was the world and the
[56:25] swore was the son of man well that's God
[56:29] the son of man was
[56:31] God and he sold seed and and the Bible
[56:34] said that the seed was the word of
[56:37] God and the word fell into good ground
[56:41] and we talked about we we we brought
[56:42] some quotes on how God had prepared
[56:45] ground well how it is that you that you
[56:48] are prepared ground is that when you
[56:50] took that Breath of Life when you came
[56:53] out of your mother's womb in that breath
[56:55] of life was an attribute son or daughter
[56:59] of
[57:00] God and in an appointed time and season
[57:04] God was going to call that
[57:06] attribute and that's why you find
[57:09] yourself we don't all get called at the
[57:11] same time you notice that one comes
[57:14] today another one will come maybe next
[57:16] week another one will come maybe next
[57:17] year we don't know when God is going to
[57:19] call but God calls individuals because
[57:23] God is calling his own Jesus said all
[57:26] that the father hath given me all that
[57:29] the father had planned all that the
[57:32] listen we we we we just we're just using
[57:34] words here father is a word and in that
[57:38] word there is a meaning just like God
[57:41] the word God is object of worship but
[57:44] you need to get into the actual thoughts
[57:47] of God where you where you connect with
[57:49] the logos of God where you connect with
[57:52] the word of God and then when when the
[57:55] logos is revealed to you it it actually
[57:59] tells you the meaning of the word that
[58:03] God is expressed in you all of a sudden
[58:06] you start to express God in your season
[58:09] in your time and you don't realize that
[58:11] you don't realize what what's going on
[58:13] here how come I'm I can't get enough of
[58:16] the word how come I can't read enough I
[58:18] want to be in church I want to go to
[58:20] church Wednesday I want to be in the
[58:22] prayer meeting on Friday I hope some of
[58:23] you all do Sunday I can't wait to be in
[58:26] the house of the Lord why because you're
[58:28] feeding on the
[58:29] word the word can only grow by feeding
[58:34] on the
[58:35] word you are the word and the only thing
[58:38] that makes sense to you now is the word
[58:42] but by Revelation by the thought meaning
[58:46] that's in the actual word being revealed
[58:49] unto you amen praise God hallelujah and
[58:53] so Mary was just an incubator but the
[58:57] child belonged to God yes he was the
[59:00] creator of both egg
[59:01] hemoglobin we've read this already let's
[59:04] go
[59:05] on
[59:08] Amen look he received worship who
[59:12] receives who who alone deserves worship
[59:16] only
[59:17] God Thou shalt not thou th that was the
[59:21] first commandment Thou shalt not put any
[59:24] other God before me amen you shall
[59:27] worship me and me alone I am the Lord
[59:30] God you shall not have any other false
[59:33] gods before me he made that so clear to
[59:35] the children of
[59:37] Israel so who deserves the worship God
[59:40] and when they they they were come into
[59:42] the house they saw the young child with
[59:44] Mary his mother and fell down and
[59:46] worshiped him and when they had opened
[59:49] their Treasures they presented unto him
[59:51] gifts gold and frankincense and myr they
[59:55] they knew that it was royalty they knew
[59:57] that it was the these these uh um you
[1:00:01] know three kings they were they would
[1:00:03] watch the skies they they knew that
[1:00:05] something Supernatural had happened they
[1:00:07] had recognized the word of God that was
[1:00:10] written in the heavens that Messiah when
[1:00:12] that star was to appear Messiah was
[1:00:16] going to be on the
[1:00:18] earth and they came and they worshiped
[1:00:21] him Jesus next slide a 12-year-old boy
[1:00:26] and the child grew and whacked strong in
[1:00:29] spirit filled with wisdom and the grace
[1:00:32] of God was upon him listen to what he
[1:00:35] says here and this little boy
[1:00:36] 12-year-old child no wisdom
[1:00:39] yet why but just a 12-year-old boy the
[1:00:43] father didn't dwell in him at that
[1:00:47] time go listen Jesus sure the the Holy
[1:00:51] Spirit was around him was was directing
[1:00:54] him but he was Flesh and Blood he was a
[1:01:00] human the Bible says that he had to
[1:01:01] learn
[1:01:03] obedience to all the things that he had
[1:01:05] to come into contact with he was tempted
[1:01:08] in the same way that you as a man are
[1:01:10] tempted you as a woman are tempted he
[1:01:12] was tempted in all of those areas but he
[1:01:16] overcame because he
[1:01:18] knew he knew that he was about the
[1:01:20] father's business something was in him
[1:01:23] there was a revelation in him that that
[1:01:26] he knew but it wasn't until he went to
[1:01:29] the to the uh to the River Jordan where
[1:01:32] the spirit of God came down and rested
[1:01:35] upon him and went and said this is my
[1:01:39] beloved Son in whom I am now pleased to
[1:01:42] dwell in hear ye him Hallelujah you see
[1:01:47] he was moving into his public Ministry
[1:01:51] he was now receiving his enlightening
[1:01:54] where he now all of a sudden everything
[1:01:57] that he was doing all that he he was
[1:02:00] about his father's business everything
[1:02:02] was all about fulfilling he says I do
[1:02:05] nothing less the father shows me and
[1:02:07] when you've received the true birth of
[1:02:09] the holy spirit in your life you are now
[1:02:12] not led by this flesh anymore even
[1:02:15] though it's it's it's a fight it's a
[1:02:17] struggle you have to deal with it each
[1:02:19] and every day but the Holy Spirit Sons
[1:02:22] and Daughters of God are led by the
[1:02:25] spirit of God amen hallelujah and so
[1:02:28] because he he he come on the day when he
[1:02:32] baptized him he saw the spirit of God
[1:02:35] coming down and went in him amen it was
[1:02:38] at that time now now Jesus Christ being
[1:02:42] baptized with the Holy Ghost just like
[1:02:45] you justification sanctification baptism
[1:02:49] of the Holy Ghost but do you know that
[1:02:51] the baptism of the Holy Ghost a lot of
[1:02:54] people you come into the church church
[1:02:56] and you get baptized into the Holy Ghost
[1:02:58] you feel his presence and you rejoice
[1:03:01] but that is only to make
[1:03:04] way or to see that when the baptism
[1:03:08] comes upon you whether there's a seed in
[1:03:12] there that's going to get watered and
[1:03:14] germinated to bring forth a
[1:03:17] sun remember a lot of people listen
[1:03:20] there's a lot of Pentecostal churches
[1:03:21] out there a lot of Baptist Churches out
[1:03:24] there that Rejoice they go into the
[1:03:25] church churches on Sunday and the spirit
[1:03:27] of God is moving in their
[1:03:30] midst but just the very fact that the
[1:03:32] spirit of God comes down upon them
[1:03:34] causes them to speak in tongues uh shout
[1:03:38] run around and everything else doesn't
[1:03:40] mean that there is a seed in
[1:03:44] there the proof If there's a seed in
[1:03:48] there it'll
[1:03:50] awaken to the
[1:03:52] word and now like Jesus it'll say I do
[1:03:55] not nothing lest the father shows me in
[1:03:58] other words I can only see by the word
[1:04:01] of God what the word reveals to me and
[1:04:04] when I go to the word and I see baptism
[1:04:07] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:04:10] Jesus said I will send you the comforter
[1:04:13] which is the Holy Spirit and he will
[1:04:15] guide you and lead you into all truth
[1:04:18] then how in the world could I possibly
[1:04:21] believe a trinitarian Doctrine and
[1:04:24] baptism in the name of the father and of
[1:04:25] the son and of the Holy Spirit three in
[1:04:30] one
[1:04:31] no the Holy Ghost that's in me cannot
[1:04:35] possibly say Amen to that because the
[1:04:38] word cannot deny the
[1:04:41] word the evidence of the Holy Ghost is
[1:04:45] when you can recognize the
[1:04:48] word not that you can speak in tongues
[1:04:51] not that you can go to church more than
[1:04:54] anybody else it's not about just being
[1:04:56] in the church and and and and you know
[1:04:59] being in a position in the church it's
[1:05:02] about receiving the life of God in you
[1:05:07] to where now you can speak back to God
[1:05:11] by Revelation what he's revealed to you
[1:05:14] that's why the Bible says without faith
[1:05:17] it's impossible to please God well how
[1:05:20] you going to please God you think you
[1:05:22] can please God by your Works you're not
[1:05:25] going to please God by your works
[1:05:26] because there's people that do much more
[1:05:28] Works than you do you're not going to
[1:05:31] please God by giving more money than
[1:05:33] anybody else that doesn't please God
[1:05:36] there's people that give millions of
[1:05:38] dollars to the church every
[1:05:42] year but that doesn't please God you
[1:05:45] know what pleases God when he comes to
[1:05:47] you and he says to you on that day you
[1:05:49] shall know that I am in the father ye in
[1:05:52] me and I in you prise God the works that
[1:05:55] that that that that that that that
[1:05:57] you're doing it's I in you it's that
[1:06:00] those are those are the Greater Works
[1:06:02] that I am in you doing those works I'm
[1:06:05] the greater than those those situations
[1:06:08] in your life I I'm your Jehovah Gyra
[1:06:11] that provides all your needs God and you
[1:06:16] can go back and say now you can speak
[1:06:19] the Revelation that even under the
[1:06:22] circumstances of debt and broken
[1:06:25] marriages and broken families and and
[1:06:28] and and sickness and health you can you
[1:06:31] can go back because something in you
[1:06:34] goes and and and comes out of you which
[1:06:37] is the seed that was planted in there
[1:06:39] from before the foundation of the world
[1:06:41] it comes to the surface and it says I
[1:06:43] believe
[1:06:44] God I believe that the Lord is my savior
[1:06:48] he's my listen if he can save he can
[1:06:51] heal healing is only just a down payment
[1:06:54] of salvation
[1:06:57] hallelujah praise God Amen let's go to
[1:06:59] the next
[1:07:01] slide so here in the beginning of his
[1:07:04] ministry when the Holy Spirit come upon
[1:07:06] him at the baptism of John he become the
[1:07:10] anointed Messiah now remember he was the
[1:07:14] son of God when he was born he was God's
[1:07:17] virgin born son but when he become
[1:07:21] Messiah that's when the Holy Spirit Come
[1:07:24] on him cuz the Messiah means anointed
[1:07:27] one see and he was the anointed one when
[1:07:30] the Holy Spirit came upon him now he was
[1:07:35] anointed to fulfill the word for his day
[1:07:39] and what was the word for Jesus's
[1:07:43] day anybody
[1:07:45] know what was the word for Jesus's
[1:07:50] Day come
[1:07:52] on what what did he come to do came to
[1:07:56] save
[1:07:58] Calvary he came to go to Calvary he came
[1:08:03] to fulfill Calvary without Calvary there
[1:08:08] was no way that we could possibly
[1:08:11] receive the Holy
[1:08:13] Ghost because remember when he went to
[1:08:16] Calvary let's go on here it's all coming
[1:08:18] up here the anointed one amen 30 year
[1:08:22] old s 30 years old
[1:08:26] significance Joseph was 30 years old
[1:08:29] when Pharaoh commissioned him to be
[1:08:31] governor of Egypt just showing some
[1:08:33] types here from the Old Testament
[1:08:35] because there's there's a significance
[1:08:37] to when Jesus went into his public
[1:08:40] Ministry when he now came into the
[1:08:42] ministry to the Jews because because a
[1:08:45] lot of people that believe that the that
[1:08:47] the Great Tribulation that the
[1:08:48] tribulation period is going to be 7
[1:08:50] years it's actually only going to be 3
[1:08:53] and A2 years when Moses and and Elijah
[1:08:56] come and the and the tribulation strikes
[1:08:58] the Earth okay because the first 3 and
[1:09:01] 1/2 years was to the Jews when Jesus was
[1:09:05] here on Earth and Messiah was cut off
[1:09:09] when he went to Calvary so the next
[1:09:12] three and a half years is fulfilled in
[1:09:14] the tribulation we're not going to get
[1:09:15] into all that now but just to let you
[1:09:17] know that the tribulation period is not
[1:09:20] seven years it's three and a half years
[1:09:23] 1,2
[1:09:25] 30 days I believe they said in the in
[1:09:27] the scripture 1260 1260 thank
[1:09:31] you so now watch he was now remember go
[1:09:36] to the next slide
[1:09:38] here in the flesh he was just a
[1:09:41] man but in spirit he was
[1:09:45] God but a man in flesh therefore his
[1:09:48] body was a human being that was subject
[1:09:51] to The Temptations subject to sickness
[1:09:54] and just the same same as
[1:09:56] ours as he had to put on be a man a
[1:10:00] human and then he was God in the spirit
[1:10:03] he said I and my father are one my
[1:10:07] father dwelleth in me he was saying that
[1:10:10] now he was now God and human Emmanuel
[1:10:16] the word was made flesh and dwelt Among
[1:10:20] Us amen praise God go to the next slide
[1:10:25] so you just failed to see who the man
[1:10:28] was he was both God and man it was a man
[1:10:33] weeping when he was weeping for their
[1:10:35] sorrow but when he stood and said
[1:10:38] Lazarus come forth and a man had been
[1:10:41] dead four days stood on his feet again
[1:10:45] that was more than a man yes sir that
[1:10:47] was the resurrection in Jesus Christ
[1:10:50] calling forth somebody that was already
[1:10:53] dead 4 days in the grave
[1:10:57] glory to God
[1:10:59] Amen so look here our go to the next
[1:11:02] slide our Lord Jesus
[1:11:08] Christ he was man tempted by the devil
[1:11:12] Matthew 4 verse4 he was man because he
[1:11:16] hungered for food Mark 11:12 he got
[1:11:20] tired Mark
[1:11:22] 4:39 he wept John 11:35
[1:11:26] but then he was God when he overcame by
[1:11:29] the
[1:11:29] word and fed 5,000 the bread of life
[1:11:33] John 610 rebuked the storm Mark
[1:11:37] 4:39 and raised the
[1:11:40] dead our brother
[1:11:43] Lazarus both man and
[1:11:47] God he died Mark
[1:11:51] 15:37 not over 50 years old but have
[1:11:54] seen
[1:11:57] Abraham he said before before he says
[1:12:01] before he says he knew Abraham he was
[1:12:03] rebuking the Pharisees when they were
[1:12:06] saying that we are the children of
[1:12:08] Abraham he says before Abraham was I am
[1:12:13] I was before Abraham if you would have
[1:12:15] known Abraham you'd have known me and he
[1:12:17] had the rebuke them and says you're of
[1:12:19] your father the
[1:12:21] devil Hallelujah by your
[1:12:24] traditions you see they had already come
[1:12:26] up with traditions and teachings of man
[1:12:30] and they couldn't even recognize when
[1:12:31] all the scriptures of the Old Testament
[1:12:34] were being fulfilled right before their
[1:12:36] very eyes here he comes Messiah riding
[1:12:38] on the F on the ass of a mule comes
[1:12:40] riding into Jerusalem he was actually
[1:12:43] fulfilling the very scripture but yet
[1:12:46] they didn't recognize him why because
[1:12:48] they had taken on their own
[1:12:50] interpretation on the word and what's
[1:12:52] happened today the very same thing Jesus
[1:12:55] Christ comes in word form in this day to
[1:12:58] reveal himself and lead the people back
[1:13:01] to the original word and you take
[1:13:03] somebody you you show them right there
[1:13:05] in the scripture so
[1:13:07] clear baptism in the name of Jesus
[1:13:10] Christ showing very clearly that God was
[1:13:14] our savior that Jehovah of the Old
[1:13:16] Testament is Jesus of the New Testament
[1:13:19] and they and they reject
[1:13:21] it they deny it but he rose again again
[1:13:25] in Luke
[1:13:26] 24:6 before Abraham I am I am the bread
[1:13:30] of life I am that rock in the wilderness
[1:13:33] he was telling them who he was Jesus
[1:13:36] himself now look when he went to
[1:13:40] Gethsemane he went to
[1:13:43] Gethsemane as listen here what he says
[1:13:46] his last cry Eli Eli my God why has God
[1:13:51] that was a man
[1:13:55] why hast Thou forsaken me in the Garden
[1:13:58] of Gethsemane the anointing left him you
[1:14:00] know he had to die as a sinner he had to
[1:14:04] die a sinner not his sins but mine and
[1:14:08] yours he took all of our sin upon him
[1:14:13] remember I said that when he went to
[1:14:15] Calvary you went to Calvary with him
[1:14:18] because the Holy Ghost had not been
[1:14:20] given yet amen remember the whole Plan
[1:14:22] of Redemption is to restore Adam which
[1:14:26] is what was taking place at Calvary
[1:14:30] 2,000 years ago and to restore Eve which
[1:14:34] is now taking place right now and Eve
[1:14:38] could only be restored by the
[1:14:42] attributes receiving the anointing so
[1:14:45] that they could come into their day into
[1:14:49] their season into their manifestation as
[1:14:52] the bride the true church of of Jesus
[1:14:55] Christ that's why the Holy Ghost was
[1:14:58] sent down on the day of Pentecost so
[1:15:00] here now listen he says he died a sinner
[1:15:02] not his sins but mine and yours that's
[1:15:04] where that love comes in how he took
[1:15:07] mine now he says here in the rising of
[1:15:09] the Sun the spirit left him in the
[1:15:12] Garden of Gethsemane he had to die a man
[1:15:16] remember friends he didn't have to do
[1:15:18] that that was God God anointed that
[1:15:22] flesh which was human flesh and he
[1:15:25] didn't have to if he'd have went up
[1:15:27] there as God he'd have never died that
[1:15:30] kind of death you can't kill
[1:15:33] God but here I want to read I want to
[1:15:36] read the the the the rest of of this
[1:15:37] quote because brother Bram goes on he
[1:15:40] says but he didn't have to do it
[1:15:42] remember he went there with you in him
[1:15:46] see God had never separated the bride
[1:15:50] from the
[1:15:51] groom remember back in the Garden of
[1:15:54] Eden
[1:15:55] God took the rib from Adam to produce
[1:16:01] Eve called their name
[1:16:04] Adam well when he died at Calvary and
[1:16:09] they pierced his side and the blood
[1:16:12] poured
[1:16:13] out what was also pouring out was his
[1:16:17] spirit and it was his Spirit it was the
[1:16:20] attributes of you and me that were in
[1:16:24] him because when when he died and went
[1:16:26] to the Cross we died the price was paid
[1:16:30] at Calvary so that you and I when we
[1:16:33] come into our rightful position now the
[1:16:36] anointing comes on the seed you'll
[1:16:39] understand that you were Justified at
[1:16:42] Calvary because he knew that you were
[1:16:44] going to be born in sin when you were
[1:16:47] born through your mother's womb by the
[1:16:49] by the by the way of procreation that
[1:16:52] was the original sin that's why the
[1:16:55] Bible says you're born in sin speaking
[1:16:58] lies who was the first one that lied in
[1:17:01] the Garden of Eden the serpent so the
[1:17:04] nature and the characteristics of that
[1:17:07] serpent went into the human flesh of
[1:17:11] Flesh and Blood and that's why when a
[1:17:14] child is born it's got the nature on
[1:17:16] them already they're going to lie to Mom
[1:17:19] and Dad they're born in sin they're
[1:17:22] shaped in iniquity they're going to do
[1:17:24] things shap an iniquity means you're
[1:17:26] doing things that you know it's wrong
[1:17:28] but yet you just keep doing it and you
[1:17:30] shape a life out of that and God knew
[1:17:33] that you were going to live that kind of
[1:17:35] a life he knew that you were going to
[1:17:37] make those mistakes he knew that you
[1:17:38] were going to come into deception he
[1:17:40] knew that you were going to fall and you
[1:17:42] were going to have to fight this flesh
[1:17:44] and this flesh was your enemy that's why
[1:17:46] the Bible says that your carnal mind is
[1:17:49] at emnity with
[1:17:51] God it doesn't want to obey God it wants
[1:17:54] to to fulfill the lust of the
[1:17:57] flesh that's why you're going to find
[1:18:00] yourself at times being trapped by these
[1:18:02] lustful desires and by this sinful flesh
[1:18:06] but he knew that you would have to that
[1:18:09] you would have to overcome that so he
[1:18:11] made a way for
[1:18:13] you he says I'm going to take it to the
[1:18:15] Cross that's why he came as a human and
[1:18:18] when he died all of your sin all of your
[1:18:22] your your your past everything that that
[1:18:24] all your mistakes everything that you've
[1:18:27] done he says once you receive his word
[1:18:31] and that attribute of God that that that
[1:18:34] representation that was in you from
[1:18:36] before the foundations of the world it
[1:18:39] the Bible talks about the the those
[1:18:41] whose names were written in the Lamb's
[1:18:45] Book of Life That's the game book that's
[1:18:48] the book that's that's that's that's the
[1:18:50] the the the the book that was
[1:18:53] sealed okay that had all of the
[1:18:56] Mysteries all the mystery of God was
[1:18:58] revealed in there now I'll just I'll
[1:19:01] just tell you this the mystery the
[1:19:04] mystery of God was that God was going to
[1:19:07] come and become flesh and he wanted to
[1:19:11] come now he Christ The Mystery of God he
[1:19:15] wanted to come and have the preeminence
[1:19:18] in the church in the body in you as a
[1:19:22] human being he wanted to have pre
[1:19:24] preeminence in you and the only way he
[1:19:27] knew that he could have absolute and
[1:19:29] total preeminence is if he would make a
[1:19:32] way that your sin would not be able to
[1:19:34] condemn you anymore and and cause you to
[1:19:38] to to to to to go off and and fall into
[1:19:41] sin and and and feel condemnation there
[1:19:44] is therefore no condemnation to them
[1:19:47] that are in Christ how do you get into
[1:19:50] Christ you're born again by the spirit
[1:19:54] of God and the attribute of God in you
[1:19:57] awakens to who you really are and when
[1:20:00] you awaken to who you really are you
[1:20:02] recognize that there's a
[1:20:04] justification that comes within the seed
[1:20:07] of God already remember when that seed
[1:20:10] was released through through by the holy
[1:20:13] ghost coming down and the sewer went and
[1:20:15] planted those seeds you that were in
[1:20:19] that seed you that that that seed that's
[1:20:22] actually the real you every
[1:20:25] is in that all the DNA is in that
[1:20:28] seed everything that you need to
[1:20:31] overcome this Dimension is in that seed
[1:20:35] hallu there's nothing more that you need
[1:20:38] than the new birth and then all you do
[1:20:40] is you feed on the word you assemble
[1:20:43] yourself remember God is calling you in
[1:20:46] this day for one purpose to fulfill his
[1:20:51] plan and the plan of God in this day is
[1:20:55] not to go and kill yourself or offer
[1:20:58] yourself as a sacrifice somewhere on
[1:21:01] Calvary no sir the plan for this hour
[1:21:05] for this Bride for this church is to
[1:21:08] manifest the word of God to where you
[1:21:11] feed on the word of God you assemble
[1:21:14] yourselves you're under the Ephesians 4
[1:21:17] Ministry that is perfecting you this is
[1:21:20] this is what this is today tonight we're
[1:21:22] here at in Bible study but it's perfect
[1:21:25] you it's to it's to bring you out of
[1:21:27] your spiritual Amnesia it's to bring you
[1:21:29] out of your Earthly uh you know all your
[1:21:32] your Earthly traditions and all your
[1:21:34] your your your upbringing and everything
[1:21:36] that that that's holding you back and
[1:21:38] you know all the unbelief that's holding
[1:21:40] you back but I want to tell you
[1:21:42] something in that seat of God that he
[1:21:44] placed inside of you everything that you
[1:21:47] have need of is in there and it will
[1:21:50] overcome every situation in your life
[1:21:53] amen praise God God if you believe that
[1:21:56] word there's
[1:21:58] nothing that should be condemning you
[1:22:00] right now if you've truly been born
[1:22:03] again by the spirit of God you're an
[1:22:06] overcomer because the Overcomer is in
[1:22:09] you amen praise God hallelujah let's
[1:22:12] move
[1:22:12] on so we know now he says here he says
[1:22:17] listen he says the bride the the the the
[1:22:20] bride had not been separated from the
[1:22:23] groom yet so when God looked down upon
[1:22:26] the body of Christ he saw both male and
[1:22:31] female he saw you and he saw
[1:22:36] Christ Christ and the church amen the
[1:22:40] husband and the
[1:22:42] wife it's God male and female god in the
[1:22:47] beginning when he was Elohim those
[1:22:50] attributes that were in his mind because
[1:22:53] he wanted to be a savior he wanted to be
[1:22:57] a father he wanted to be a husband he
[1:23:01] wanted to have Fellowship because he
[1:23:03] expressed it the first thing that he
[1:23:04] expressed when he expressed Adam was
[1:23:07] Adam and Eve he took Eve from his side
[1:23:11] what was he showing that he was he
[1:23:12] wanted to have
[1:23:13] Fellowship well that whole plan is now
[1:23:16] being restored right back to what it
[1:23:18] originally was and so in God is male and
[1:23:24] fale female Satan wants to pervert that
[1:23:27] in our gener generation and he wants to
[1:23:30] come up with all these gender identities
[1:23:33] well you could either be male or you
[1:23:35] could be female no God didn't do it that
[1:23:39] way God didn't produce his word or his
[1:23:43] Plan of Redemption somebody show me in
[1:23:46] the word where that's in the
[1:23:48] word the only place I see it in the word
[1:23:51] is in Sodom and Gomorrah and God reigned
[1:23:54] down Boulders of fire and destroyed the
[1:23:56] whole thing because it was all an
[1:23:58] Abomination before God you see they're
[1:24:01] perverting the word of God there is no
[1:24:04] such thing as genders of male and female
[1:24:08] or a male being a female or a female
[1:24:11] being a male or a he or a they or a she
[1:24:14] or yeah you you need to put everything
[1:24:17] back to the word of God and when the
[1:24:20] spirit of God comes on you it's not
[1:24:22] going to lead you into any of that stuff
[1:24:25] praise the Lord the Holy Spirit can just
[1:24:28] in in in the same way that the Holy
[1:24:31] Spirit can raise somebody from a cancer
[1:24:34] he can raise somebody from a life of
[1:24:37] immorality yes Lord because it's just a
[1:24:40] spirit cancer is a spirit homosexual
[1:24:44] sodomite that's just a spirit it needs
[1:24:47] to be it needs to be cast out oh but
[1:24:50] they're born with it yeah maybe the
[1:24:52] spirit was in there because it come down
[1:24:54] through
[1:24:55] generations whatever but that doesn't
[1:24:58] change God's ability to cast out demons
[1:25:01] when that father brought his son who had
[1:25:03] been born with epilepsy and Jesus looked
[1:25:05] to the boy and said Satan come out that
[1:25:09] child was completely delivered of
[1:25:12] epilepsy there's no difference between
[1:25:14] epilepsy and a homosexual Spirit no
[1:25:18] difference it's just a different Spirit
[1:25:21] that's all it is hallelujah praise God
[1:25:24] God so here now he says so when he God
[1:25:26] looked down upon that body he saw both
[1:25:29] male and female musicians come it was
[1:25:32] all redeemed in that one body
[1:25:35] see they are one same
[1:25:40] word same
[1:25:42] word the same word spoke of the groom
[1:25:46] speaks of the
[1:25:49] Bride
[1:25:51] everything that we read in the
[1:25:53] scriptures
[1:25:55] when we're reading in the New Testament
[1:25:57] and Paul is talking to the
[1:26:00] church and speaking to the church and
[1:26:03] rebuking the
[1:26:04] church and correcting the church in
[1:26:08] Corinthians it's so that we can come to
[1:26:11] understand that we are the word and God
[1:26:15] is delivering us and setting us free
[1:26:19] from the sin and unbelief that is
[1:26:23] affecting our
[1:26:25] flesh the seed of God remember that
[1:26:29] seed everything is in that seed that you
[1:26:32] have need
[1:26:33] of that seed cannot disbelieve God's
[1:26:38] word the Bible says the seed of God
[1:26:41] cannot disbelieve the word of
[1:26:44] God so don't worry if there's a seed in
[1:26:48] there an election is in there you can
[1:26:51] never ever be deceived amen praise
[1:26:57] God we'll just finish off with
[1:26:59] this at the cross of Calvary the next
[1:27:04] slide he perceived
[1:27:07] we the love of God because he laid down
[1:27:10] his life for us God veiled in Jesus to
[1:27:15] do the work of
[1:27:18] redemption at the cross God could not
[1:27:21] die in the spirit he's eternal
[1:27:25] but he had to put on a mask and act the
[1:27:29] part of death I'll tell you Saints
[1:27:31] there's so much in that you had to put
[1:27:35] on a human vessel to act the part of a
[1:27:41] human
[1:27:42] being and you had to come into sinful
[1:27:45] flesh an attribute of God had to come
[1:27:48] into this sinful flesh had to go through
[1:27:51] a spiritual Amnesia had to be
[1:27:54] uh you know go through so many different
[1:27:57] things in your life so much sin and
[1:27:59] unbelief and and some you know abused
[1:28:02] you know sexual abuse and and and and
[1:28:05] mental abuse and and all kinds of of of
[1:28:09] terrible experiences of broken homes and
[1:28:12] broken
[1:28:14] families all the things that that that
[1:28:16] you know that that comes with being a
[1:28:19] human
[1:28:20] being but in there is an elected seed of
[1:28:23] God
[1:28:25] God and that mask gets removed the veil
[1:28:31] of this life gets
[1:28:33] removed when you receive the New Birth
[1:28:37] by the word of God and by believing that
[1:28:40] Jesus
[1:28:42] Christ is
[1:28:44] God and that he can he's the only true
[1:28:48] way and life he had to act the part of
[1:28:51] death he did die but he could could do
[1:28:54] it in his God form he had to do it in
[1:28:57] the son form as a son of man on Earth
[1:29:04] Saints you need to die out to
[1:29:07] yourself you need to die out to all the
[1:29:10] unbelief that the enemy has been putting
[1:29:12] upon your life trying to keep you Bound
[1:29:16] in a sinful condition trying to keep you
[1:29:19] mentally
[1:29:21] bound trying to keep you thinking that
[1:29:25] this is who you actually
[1:29:28] are no the new birth brings you into the
[1:29:31] true identity of who you are you are not
[1:29:34] the son or the daughter of Mr and Mrs so
[1:29:37] and so yeah this flesh came through
[1:29:42] that but the seed of God that was
[1:29:46] prepared for good ground that seed that
[1:29:50] was placed in there is God and it will
[1:29:55] manifest God it will manifest the
[1:29:58] Rapture that is the part that we are
[1:30:00] going to manifest like we were saying on
[1:30:03] Sunday there's nothing
[1:30:05] left there's nothing
[1:30:07] left there's nothing left for for for
[1:30:10] for only the bride coming into her
[1:30:13] maturity Israel is already in her
[1:30:16] Homeland Jesus said in Matthew 24 that
[1:30:19] that generation would
[1:30:21] see all of these things Jesus said that
[1:30:25] generation would witness and see those
[1:30:27] things that the coming of the Lord they
[1:30:31] were going to witness that event and
[1:30:35] that generation is now already 76 years
[1:30:39] into that generation because a
[1:30:41] generation in Israel now is anywhere
[1:30:43] between 73 and 83 years like we were
[1:30:47] reading from The Book of Psalms so if
[1:30:50] we're
[1:30:51] already in the ballpark
[1:30:55] what's our priorities looking like
[1:30:57] lately are we
[1:30:59] focused are we ready are we paying
[1:31:02] attention to what's really going on or
[1:31:04] are you
[1:31:06] asleep not realizing that the coming of
[1:31:08] the lord it's already happened it's
[1:31:12] already in progress you've already been
[1:31:14] raptured brother Bram says the Rapture
[1:31:16] is a
[1:31:17] revelation you've already been taken
[1:31:19] you've already been snatched away one
[1:31:22] will be taken the other one left it's
[1:31:24] already happened the Rapture is already
[1:31:27] in progress you're already in that
[1:31:29] partially in that Dimension you're
[1:31:31] you're Torn Between Two Dimensions right
[1:31:33] now that's why you're fighting that's
[1:31:36] why you're overcoming that's what you're
[1:31:38] dealing with because this flesh wants to
[1:31:40] keep you here but the scripture said
[1:31:42] that this Mortal shall put on
[1:31:46] immortality hallelujah praise God we're
[1:31:48] going to end it right
[1:31:50] there let us pray
[1:31:52] father what a privilege and an honor it
[1:31:55] is tonight Lord to hear these wonderful
[1:31:58] truths that that are uh in your word and
[1:32:01] how you've made it so clear to us father
[1:32:03] that that Lord we're not what we appear
[1:32:07] to be Lord but it's a paradox we're
[1:32:10] still having to go and deal with these
[1:32:12] things of the world and tomorrow morning
[1:32:14] we've got to get up we've got to go to
[1:32:16] work we've got to go and deal with all
[1:32:18] these things but Lord something Burns
[1:32:21] within our hearts and that is the
[1:32:23] revelation of who we truly are and when
[1:32:26] we look around us and we see the world
[1:32:28] in the condition that it's in Father we
[1:32:30] know that there's a resurrection that's
[1:32:32] already taken place within us and and
[1:32:35] the same spirit that raised Christ from
[1:32:38] the dead it now dwells in us and it is
[1:32:41] quickening it is changing it is
[1:32:44] quickening our mortal bodies so that we
[1:32:47] can be translated into that other
[1:32:50] dimension from where we originally came
[1:32:53] from Lord
[1:32:54] back reunited with the word of God that
[1:32:58] is our hope that is our future there is
[1:33:00] no future but the coming of the Lord the
[1:33:03] rest of the world is going into chaos we
[1:33:06] can see the conditions of the world
[1:33:08] going into total chaos Israel in her
[1:33:10] Homeland surrounded by the enemy oh God
[1:33:14] but Lord Jesus you have a bride that's
[1:33:16] being perfected by the word of God that
[1:33:19] is standing on the word of God that is
