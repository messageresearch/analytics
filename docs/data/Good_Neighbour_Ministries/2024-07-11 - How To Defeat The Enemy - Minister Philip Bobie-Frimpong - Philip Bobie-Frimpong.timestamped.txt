[20:49] you may be able to stand against the
[20:52] walls of the devil that's the W of the
[20:54] devil is the tricks of the devil and by
[20:57] put on the whole Armor of God you able
[20:59] to stand against that tra of the devil
[21:03] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[21:06] blood but against
[21:09] principalities rulers of the darkness of
[21:12] this world against the spiritual
[21:14] wickedness in high
[21:17] places wherefore take unto you the whole
[21:20] armor of God which is the true word of
[21:22] God that he may be able to withand in

[21:28] evil day this is the day amen you are in
[21:32] the evil day but he said that and having
[21:36] done all to stand stand
[21:40] therefore having your loins get about
[21:43] with the truth and having on the

[21:48] righteousness and your feet shut with
[21:50] the preparation of the gospel of
[21:57] peace about have all taken the shield of
[22:00] faith that is apply the faith in the
[22:02] word of God wherewith you shall be able
[22:05] to quench all the fire dos of the wicked
[22:09] and take the helmet of salvation and the
[22:12] sword of the spiritual the word of
[22:15] God and
[22:17] praying always with all prayer and
[22:21] supplication in the spirit and watching
[22:25] there onto with all perseverance and
[22:28] supplication ation for all the saints
[22:31] and then let's read Matthew
[22:34] 41-10 it's a Bible study so I hope you
[22:37] guys don't
[22:40] mind then was Jesus led
[22:44] up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to
[22:47] be tempted of the devil and when he had
[22:52] fasted when he had fasted 40 days and 40
[22:56] nights he was afterward and hungry that
[23:01] means that he wasn't hungry during the
[23:04] fasting but the scripture is saying that
[23:06] after the fasting he was hungry so um
[23:10] those Pentecostals that they say they
[23:13] fasting for like two months three months
[23:15] it's all kind of if you truly fasting
[23:17] you are feasting with the Lord so you're
[23:20] not going to be that too hungry as those
[23:23] people are because it was
[23:25] after then he was hungry and we know
[23:27] that you have to be led by God to fast
[23:31] and when he put in your heart to do then
[23:33] he's going to feed you and that fasting
[23:36] going to be rejoicing not going to be
[23:38] like a
[23:39] bing
[23:42] amen and when the tempter came to him he
[23:45] said if thou be the Son of God command
[23:49] that these Stones be made
[23:52] bread but he answered and said and said
[23:56] it is written my shall not live by bread
[23:59] alone but by every word that proceeded
[24:03] out of the mouth of
[24:06] God then the devil take him up into the
[24:09] holy city and seted him on the Pinnacle
[24:13] of the
[24:14] temple and said unto him if thou be the
[24:17] Son of God cast thyself down for it is
[24:21] written he shall give his angels charge
[24:25] concerning thee and in their hands they
[24:27] shall bear the up lest at any time thou
[24:31] shall
[24:32] Dash thy feet against a stone Jus says
[24:37] unto him it is written again thou shall
[24:40] not tempt the Lord thy God Amen again
[24:44] the devil take him up into an exceeding
[24:47] high mountain and show him all the
[24:49] kingdoms of the world and the glory of
[24:52] them and said unto him all these things
[24:57] will I give thee by God if thou Bow Down
[25:01] and Worship me then said Jus unto him
[25:04] get the hands Satan for it is written
[25:08] thou sh Worship the Lord thy God and him
[25:11] only shall thou serve in the last
[25:14] scripture then we going to just two
[25:16] scriptures here second 2 Corinthians 10
[25:23] 3-5 2 Corinthians 3 10-5
[25:31] 2 Corinthians 10 sorry
[25:33] 3:5 for though we walk in the
[25:36] flesh we do not walk after the flesh for
[25:40] the weapons of our welfare are not caner
[25:43] but Mighty true God to the pulling down
[25:45] of strongholds casting down imaginations
[25:49] and every High thing that exalt itself
[25:53] against the knowledge of God and
[25:56] bringing into captivity
[25:59] every thought to The
[26:02] Obedience of Christ amen please be
[26:06] seated Hallelujah if I should um title
[26:10] this I'll title it um how to defeat the
[26:17] enemy God have shown us
[26:20] ways that we can defeat our enemy and
[26:24] you have only one enemy that the devil
[26:27] it's not your brother or your to anybody
[26:29] is the devil is our enemy and he comes
[26:32] in various
[26:34] ways and he has his wild that's the Ws
[26:38] of him a lot of tricks in his uh bosom
[26:43] whatever it is so he always apply those
[26:47] tricks and he never give up so when he
[26:51] try one thing you overcome he come
[26:53] another way he changes his form and
[26:55] always trying with all kind of
[26:59] tricks uh to what
[27:02] to um to defeat you but as a son or
[27:07] daughter of God God has also given us
[27:11] what antidote to all his
[27:14] tricks so we have the anti because God
[27:18] being God is infinite God and before the
[27:21] foundations of The World God knew you I
[27:24] will be here so God is Not Like Us who
[27:28] going to make plans today and then
[27:30] change it and then do this tomorrow when
[27:34] he said something that it so his word
[27:40] that he gave us to overcome the enemy
[27:43] but the enemy also has a lot of tricks
[27:47] remember we are Body Soul and Spirit so
[27:51] our five senses we contacted with our
[27:54] body we have hearing see taste smell
[27:58] feel and yeah in this and then the
[28:02] spiritual have your conscience
[28:04] subconscious love affection reasoning
[28:07] memory and all those things so the devil
[28:10] play with all those things your
[28:12] reasoning the the main thing that he
[28:16] used is the reasoning he deceived if by
[28:19] what
[28:21] reasoning and he has not left that and
[28:25] one other things that he used is
[28:28] doubt and also he uses
[28:32] um
[28:34] disbelief because if you disbelieve
[28:38] God's word then he gu you so um I read
[28:42] this here A quick look at those
[28:44] scriptures which involve the Lord Jesus
[28:46] overcoming will bring out the truth of
[28:49] this propositions that is in the church
[28:52] ages book in Matthew 4 where in Jesus is
[28:56] tempted of the devil he overcame the
[28:59] personal
[29:01] Temptations Temptation Of Satan by the
[29:04] word and by the word only in each of
[29:09] three major Tri that corresponded
[29:11] exactly the Temptation Of The Garden of
[29:13] Eden the lust of the flesh the lust of
[29:17] the eye and the pride of life Jesus
[29:22] overcame by the
[29:24] word he fell to the personal Temptation
[29:27] Of Satan Time by failing to use the word
[29:32] and Adam fell in direct Disobedience to
[29:35] the word but Jesus overcame by the word
[29:40] and right now let me say that this is
[29:45] the only way to be an overcomer also it
[29:49] is only way that you can know it if you
[29:52] overcome because that word can fail amen
[29:57] so say said Heaven and Earth will pass
[29:59] away but God's word can never pass away
[30:03] it's said let every man's word be a liar
[30:06] but mine be the truth so the word of God
[30:09] overcome Satan at any place anywhere at
[30:12] any point in time amen the only way that
[30:17] he can defeat you is when you get away
[30:19] from the word remember Satan has no
[30:22] power on his own the only Power he has
[30:25] is the what you give to him
[30:28] everything that God gave us an example
[30:31] when he asked
[30:33] God permission to try
[30:37] job when God gave him permission what
[30:39] did he use he used fear and everything
[30:43] that job feared came on him so the
[30:47] tactics of the devil is to cause you to
[30:50] fear fear is false evidence appearing to
[30:54] be real so when that fearce comes into
[30:58] your thought and you accept it then he G
[31:01] you but Christ came to give us a sound
[31:06] mind and what and and a peace so you
[31:10] don't entertain those thoughts that is
[31:13] contr the word of God Amen I'm not
[31:17] saying that those thoughts will not
[31:20] come they will come but you have power
[31:24] in the name of Jesus to rebuke those
[31:27] those thought as he said get hands the
[31:31] behind me Satan don't entertain and feed
[31:35] on those thoughts because the thought of
[31:38] God is what um what everything that is
[31:42] what um everything that is lovely that
[31:46] is of good report think on those things
[31:49] amen but the enemy triy to come to be
[31:52] like a cockroach He's a fly he came like
[31:55] a fly put this thought here put this
[31:57] here he's trying but remember those
[32:00] things cannot overcome you they are not
[32:04] your thoughts andless you accept it once
[32:09] you accept it then you have power and
[32:12] then you're going to bring this this
[32:13] that that that but you have also the
[32:15] right to accept the word of God in your
[32:18] heart in your soul and when you accept
[32:21] that then everything Godly flows through
[32:24] you it becomes H automatic
[32:28] so we have come to the place that
[32:30] there's the greatest battle ever fought
[32:33] is going on now and that battle is in
[32:37] our mind it's going on De devil want to
[32:41] what control it and God also wants to
[32:44] control it but it depends on which one
[32:48] you gave him the
[32:49] preeminence I subject mind to the Lord
[32:52] Jesus Christ to take absolute control
[32:55] over all my thought my conscious sub
[32:57] conscience everything I give it to him
[33:00] tonight amen because you have the right
[33:04] to accept God's thoughts you have the
[33:07] right to think right thoughts I
[33:11] remember years
[33:13] back
[33:15] yes the enemy tried to put something in
[33:18] my thought I know this is contrary and
[33:21] then I was trying
[33:23] everything fighting about it
[33:26] and I don't know how is it sometime you
[33:28] play something that you know is not
[33:31] right and I was working as brother
[33:34] Michael was saying in East York I
[33:36] remember and then I was singing and the
[33:38] anointing of God came on me and
[33:40] something spoke and said you are saved
[33:44] don't let devil what play with your mind
[33:47] so I'm telling you tonight if the en put
[33:50] anything in your mind remember you are
[33:52] saved he just a what a bluff he only
[33:56] tried to play with your mind and your
[33:59] senses reject it you doubt your doubt
[34:02] and you accept God's word amen I'm
[34:05] doubting my doubt now I'm accepting
[34:07] God's word amen because that's the only
[34:10] thing that what will bring you Victory
[34:14] and will give you um it will let you
[34:17] overcome the devil and his ways because
[34:20] you have the right to think God's
[34:23] thoughts those are not your thoughts
[34:27] he said above all things you have the
[34:32] right to think those things that are
[34:36] edifying those things that what are
[34:40] lovely those things that are of good
[34:43] report so think on this amen we are on
[34:49] God's side and one thing I realize on
[34:52] that day he is the one fighting our
[34:54] battles none of us can fight because
[34:57] this enemy has 6,000 years experience
[35:00] and you cannot defeat him but he that
[35:03] overcame he lives in you he lives in me
[35:06] he is the one overcoming him so our job
[35:09] is finished we all have to just relax
[35:12] and let God have his own way and take
[35:16] control because he will never leave us
[35:19] nor forsake us he's the same yesterday
[35:22] today and forever hallelujah praise God
[35:27] and one other thing
[35:30] too um as you
[35:33] read as in the Garden of
[35:37] Eden what happened the enemy
[35:41] went and he reison with
[35:45] Eve the mistake Eve made was that she
[35:49] should have told him my husband is not
[35:51] here talk to my husband and our husband
[35:55] is the word of God so we hide behind the
[35:58] word of God but she tried to face it by
[36:01] herself and facing that enemy with all
[36:04] his tricks and everything he used
[36:08] reasoning and if stop for a
[36:12] moment once he stopped he got him he
[36:17] sorry he got her like bra gave us an
[36:19] example of M Sanders in the greatest
[36:21] battle ever for when she repented and
[36:25] received the Holy Ghost and then then
[36:28] she heard that
[36:29] music and she stopped for a moment to
[36:32] try to what win souls that's where she
[36:36] got her
[36:37] mistake so don't stop for a moment if
[36:41] God has revealed something to you act on
[36:45] it don't wait because what happen is
[36:50] that when in the span that God reveals
[36:53] something to you if you wait for too
[36:56] long the enemy can come with all kind of
[37:00] reasons then this one will come this one
[37:03] will come then you got to reason this
[37:05] reason but when God reveals something to
[37:07] you and you knew it's that said the Lord
[37:09] you act right away because you check in
[37:12] the bible say that on the same self day
[37:15] Abraham circumcised his household on the
[37:18] same on the same self day Jacob did this
[37:22] on the same self day Isaac did this so
[37:24] when God reveals something to don't wait
[37:27] don't procrastinate and if God has
[37:29] placed something in your heart act on it
[37:32] don't procrastinate because tomorrow may
[37:35] not be there for you today is today
[37:38] let's do today's work today because we
[37:41] have power in the name of Jesus in the
[37:44] name of overcome Stan and all his
[37:46] strengths because he
[37:49] overcame he conquered hell death and
[37:52] Grave so that we can also conquer all
[37:55] those because he has conquered for us we
[37:57] just have to walk on and what please him
[38:00] amen our God is good all the time
[38:11] Hallelujah the
[38:13] devil in that Temptation with
[38:17] God he knew the word about 99% of the
[38:21] word he knew it but the difference is
[38:25] Jesus Christ was the word
[38:28] so knowing the word and being the word
[38:30] is two different things if you are the
[38:33] word and that word lives in you are part
[38:35] of him you are part of at attributes he
[38:39] can't deceive
[38:40] you he can bring all his lies and said
[38:44] and can quote even better than you can
[38:46] quote and give all kind of quotations
[38:50] but remember it's a revelation that
[38:52] makes a difference the letter kill it
[38:55] but the spirit giveth life because he he
[38:57] misapplied the word to the Lord Jesus
[39:00] Christ at that time he said that oh if
[39:03] you be the Son of God cast yourself down
[39:06] and he send his angels to vaku those
[39:09] things it God did not tell us to tempt
[39:12] him said do not temp the Lord thy God
[39:16] when you are in a situation and that
[39:21] happen he'll be there for you like he
[39:23] said if you eat poisons it will not what
[39:25] harm you but you will won't go and tempt
[39:28] God by going to take a poison to eat so
[39:32] it is so he misapply the word and the
[39:36] devil always miscode the word of God but
[39:39] you being the word of God you will
[39:41] recognize this is not from him amen
[39:45] because you are part of him you are part
[39:47] of St so the same way Jus Christ
[39:49] defeated him back then and that part of
[39:52] Christ is in you and me you cannot be
[39:54] defeated temporary he can make you up
[39:57] and do this or do that but God in you
[40:00] amen will wake up and say no this is not
[40:03] that this is not that you able to place
[40:06] everything right amen because you are
[40:08] the part of the word you are part of him
[40:11] and he's part of you hallelujah our god
[40:14] is awesome God hallelujah he's the same
[40:18] yesterday today and forever Hallelujah
[40:22] he never changed amen hallelujah the
[40:26] devil has not changed God has not
[40:27] changed it's the same tactics to use
[40:31] Hallelujah and what is happening is that
[40:34] in every country when they go into
[40:37] war they
[40:39] prepare and they steud the tactics of
[40:43] their enemy they just don't go and just
[40:47] go for like that they sit down they
[40:50] plan the how to approach that war
[40:55] and remember
[40:58] the instruments or the ammunitions or
[41:02] the
[41:03] armor arms that they used in the first
[41:08] world war when the second world war came
[41:11] if you go apply the same arms you not
[41:16] you not going to we mic you it's that
[41:19] obsolete you'll be defeated
[41:22] flat the third world war coming or like
[41:26] um in the second world war they have to
[41:29] use machine guns and everything for that
[41:34] age and if you go and use the old one
[41:38] it's not going to work even in our time
[41:41] you think Russia when they fighting
[41:44] Ukraine all those Old Second World
[41:46] machines it did anything to them they
[41:48] have to borrow something from Iran Iran
[41:50] to help them because an obsolute it
[41:53] can't stand the condition for a time so
[41:57] is the word of God and you can even go
[42:00] back in science
[42:03] development they have moved from
[42:05] airplane to moon and all those things
[42:08] everything is Advanced so you can't go
[42:11] back and use H and buy in this age that
[42:14] we are living in sir hor and buggy will
[42:17] not work amen so is the word of God the
[42:21] word that fall in the time of Luther was
[42:23] gold that said the Lord
[42:25] justification but that was TR by them it
[42:29] was able to meet the conditions at that
[42:32] time but it can't meet the conditions
[42:35] when Wesley came on the scene because it
[42:38] was sanctification adding sanctification
[42:40] to what Justice
[42:43] justification
[42:45] so so in the Pentecostal
[42:48] age it was
[42:51] what baptism of the Holy Ghost has come
[42:55] down a more powerful say and those who
[42:58] are children of God they March off with
[43:01] the word of God they will not go back
[43:04] and try to use sanctification to meet
[43:07] the enemy at that time because
[43:09] sanctification in the time of Wesley was
[43:12] good but it was good for Wesley time it
[43:16] wasn't good for the baptism of the Holy
[43:18] Ghost amen because the enemy his streets
[43:21] has advanced he's gone higher so you
[43:25] need more higher
[43:27] um higher machines to face him higher
[43:32] anointing higher spirit of God to face
[43:35] the enemy you can't go back and use
[43:38] sanctification
[43:39] thing then after the baptism of the Holy
[43:42] Ghost the Holy Ghost himself is here God
[43:47] himself because listen he didn't leave
[43:50] this in the hands of any
[43:52] man he took it upon himself he's the
[43:56] lamb that open the seals when the seals
[43:59] were open the Bible became a new book
[44:02] The Prophet look at it from a different
[44:04] angle from that time the mighty Angel
[44:07] himself came down and open that book
[44:11] it's an open book so the anointing is
[44:14] changed to a higher Octan and no one can
[44:18] bring that himself going to bring you to
[44:21] that stage you can't bring yourself
[44:23] there this has to be done by God himself
[44:27] no one can put you there he himself will
[44:30] put you there if you are part of him
[44:33] you're part of his attributes he bring
[44:35] you to that level it's not you putting
[44:39] yourself there it's not by works of
[44:41] righteousness but by his grace and grace
[44:44] alone you are part of him so the enemy
[44:48] cannot do nothing about it so when that
[44:51] se were open the Bible became a new book
[44:54] God came down amen because why enemy
[44:57] trick has gone higher amen hallelujah
[45:01] even the braam time it wasn't wiing like
[45:03] this he was worried about this but now
[45:07] those demons we have more than 15 or 100
[45:10] genders and lesbians and every Spirit F
[45:13] Spirit has been
[45:16] loose how can you fight this with the
[45:21] wether fall in the time of Luther time
[45:25] or Pentecost you
[45:28] can't you need a fresh anointing you
[45:32] need a word for present time even what
[45:36] fall on yesterday cannot do you need
[45:38] something fresh from the throne today to
[45:41] anoint your heart and your soul to
[45:44] overcome the enemy because the enemy has
[45:47] a lot of touches a lot of traes in his
[45:50] bosom he's always trying this trying
[45:53] that he come to you and attack you with
[45:55] sickness and then he said that oh God
[45:57] will not even hear your prayer oh God
[46:00] the day the day of Miracle is passed
[46:02] he's going to bring all kind meanwhile
[46:04] he bring the sickness that he came back
[46:06] and whisper in your heart oh listen to
[46:09] the doctor's report but the True
[46:11] Believer will say by his stripes I am
[46:13] healed I am the Lord God that Health all
[46:16] your disease amen said that I the Lord
[46:19] God that heal all he healed all your
[46:23] disease amen bless the name bless the
[46:26] the Lord oh my soul and all that is
[46:29] within me bless the who has what um
[46:32] forgiven all your iniquities and what
[46:34] health all your disease so he is a
[46:39] tricker he's a liar from the pit of Hell
[46:44] so you don't listen to his
[46:46] Whispers sometimes the things he's going
[46:48] to tell you it looks all
[46:51] true like your physically flesh it looks
[46:56] like he he true it's lying he did that
[46:59] to the prophet he said oh your young man
[47:03] you serve God you fast you prayed you
[47:06] did this you did everything and when he
[47:08] came to your own he let your daughter
[47:11] died he did it said life from hell and
[47:15] the prophet was almost water Fe on that
[47:18] but greater is he that is in him than he
[47:21] that was in the world so something rose
[47:23] up and said the Lord give it and the
[47:25] Lord take it blessed be the name of the
[47:28] Lord amen so you need a fresh anointing
[47:32] fresh word of God to overcome the tians
[47:38] of the enemy that is the only thing that
[47:41] will help us in this journey Our Own
[47:44] Strength our own wisdom our own effort
[47:48] it will not do it even raising up of our
[47:52] children the word has gone to a higher
[47:56] level the so the the the internet this
[48:00] that in our time me raising up my
[48:03] parents knows everywhere I'm going they
[48:05] know my friends they know the house I'm
[48:08] going where I'm playing but we are in
[48:11] what scientific age you can be home with
[48:14] your child speaking to somebody in
[48:16] Germany or in Ireland or we don't even
[48:19] have a clue what was going on in their
[48:21] life because of communication that they
[48:23] having how can you fight this with um
[48:26] Luther message you need a present stage
[48:30] of his ministry to overcome all those
[48:33] Spirits so it's very very important that
[48:36] you stay on with the
[48:39] word do not apply the Do Not Mis apply
[48:43] the word or mislocate it by the
[48:46] revelation of the word of God that will
[48:49] lead you and guide you to all all
[48:52] truth um he said that in um in in that H
[48:58] in uh Ephesians 6 over there he said
[49:02] that in Ephesians 6
[49:07] six above all taking the sheld of what
[49:10] of
[49:11] Faith where you shall be able to quench
[49:13] all the fa DS of the wicked apply that
[49:17] word with
[49:18] faith because remember the letter kill
[49:22] it but the spirit giveth life so you
[49:25] need that re relation of the word from
[49:28] him to be able to defeat the enemy in
[49:32] every circumstances because the word of
[49:34] God will defeat Devil any place anywhere
[49:37] at any time
[49:40] amen so I doubt your doubt now don't
[49:46] allow him to put any doubt in you or
[49:49] misbelief because that's why no one said
[49:52] the pro the Bible said that all things
[49:54] are possible to them what that
[49:58] believe God emphasized that listen you
[50:02] cannot approach god with any negative
[50:06] thing that's why James said that
[50:09] double-minded are always double minded
[50:11] are always what um I forgot exact
[50:15] subject
[50:18] unstable you have to be stable you have
[50:22] to be positive you have to approach god
[50:25] with positive ity knowing that God's
[50:29] word cannot fail he honors his word more
[50:33] than his name when the enemy Rise Like A
[50:37] Flat his spirit will always raise a
[50:40] standard amen he said that my word will
[50:43] not come out void unless accomplish what
[50:46] it was sent for so your purpose here
[50:50] will be accomplish by the word of God in
[50:52] your life no matter what if God has not
[50:55] finished with you no devil in hell can
[50:58] take your life he can what attack your
[51:01] spirit can attack your flesh but your
[51:03] soul is in God my soul is in God Amen he
[51:07] can attack the Flesh and do whatever it
[51:10] is but that soul is in God Amen always
[51:14] praise praise God and please God know
[51:17] what the said the soul that siners shall
[51:19] surely die but the soul that come from
[51:22] the Throne of God is in God Amen the
[51:25] devil cannot do nothing with it and the
[51:28] word of God is what embracing it the
[51:30] come around it is that word of God
[51:33] that's where you going to defeat him all
[51:34] the time because his Titus is always
[51:37] caused the human being to disbelieve
[51:39] God's word but God's tius is to what let
[51:43] you believe his word and put it there
[51:46] because listen you have your conscious
[51:48] you have your subconscious you have
[51:50] everything your memory and Sam bra said
[51:53] if your memory or your conscious or
[51:55] subconscious everything this believe
[51:58] this way get rid of
[52:01] it don't allow them to
[52:04] what um to to don't allow Satan to put
[52:10] anything contrary to God in there and
[52:12] accept it if it's contrary the word of
[52:15] God get rid of it if your memories
[52:18] things that you remember is contrary the
[52:20] word of God get rid of it to resist the
[52:23] devil and he flee from you because he's
[52:26] a is is a is a frog always going to
[52:29] bring the things back go back oh this
[52:31] one Pastor Danel was saying somebody has
[52:34] done you something 20 years and you
[52:36] still remember and dealing with that no
[52:39] forgive and forget and move on with your
[52:41] life those things has happened is God
[52:43] permitted that I like what P salmon said
[52:46] one time he said that anything that
[52:48] comes my life God permitted God allow it
[52:52] to come to my life so I'm it came for a
[52:55] purpose
[52:56] sometimes those even came to shape you
[52:59] it came to give you different
[53:00] perspective because some of us sometime
[53:03] we play so much confidence in one in our
[53:06] brothers or human being but God doesn't
[53:09] want us to do that so those people God
[53:12] some sometimes could let them fall flat
[53:15] and do something that my goodness how
[53:18] can this brother do this but God is also
[53:22] watching your your your response your
[53:25] reaction
[53:27] how you are reacting to that he's
[53:29] watching all that so God sh not his
[53:34] glory with
[53:36] anyone one time as brofi was saying
[53:38] somebody said oh he left the church
[53:42] because this one has done this this one
[53:43] has done that that's one has done that
[53:45] he said my brother if
[53:48] God call you you w't leave the church
[53:53] it's not that person that call you no
[53:55] matter what they have
[53:57] done they didn't call you God gave you
[54:01] your
[54:02] salvation look beyond the
[54:05] Flesh and move on and serve
[54:08] God because we are not fighting against
[54:11] flesh and
[54:13] blood God is also tempting you remember
[54:17] when you read that scripture about
[54:19] Temptations of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[54:23] devil came to him in his weak time when
[54:27] he was hungry when he was hungry after
[54:31] the fasting and prayer he came at the
[54:35] weak
[54:37] spot he knows how to
[54:41] attack when you are down in the valley
[54:44] he'll come and attack you with
[54:46] everything but remember greater is he
[54:49] that is in you that he Us in the world
[54:52] in every time God raise up a standard
[54:55] the only way you remain there is if you
[54:59] refuse the toxin it's like he said when
[55:02] the doctors you go to a doctor and you
[55:05] are sick and he gave you a medication
[55:08] and if you not take that medication you
[55:10] cannot blame the doctor because the
[55:12] doctor has done his part so is the word
[55:15] of God when God reveals something to you
[55:18] or God tells you something and you fail
[55:20] to act on it and becomes a problem to
[55:23] you don't blame the pastor don't blame
[55:25] anybody blame yourself myself I hate
[55:27] people who try to put their blames on
[55:30] others it's my
[55:32] responsibility to what act on the word
[55:35] of God my responsibility to take care of
[55:38] business I don't care what anybody has
[55:40] done or what anybody has told me I'm
[55:43] going to do what God has told me to do I
[55:47] not going to blame anybody I'm going to
[55:50] take responsibility for my actions amen
[55:53] because if you do not take
[55:55] responsibility for your actions you try
[55:57] to run away because you accepted it like
[56:01] I always say it if someone gives me
[56:04] advice and I go and act on
[56:07] it and I get a good results and some
[56:12] most you take the glory for yourself oh
[56:14] I did this I did that and I got that
[56:17] when the person give you advice and I
[56:19] think that's not work oh this brother
[56:22] told me to do this that brother told me
[56:24] to do this and didn't happen why are you
[56:26] blaming the brother he was only advising
[56:29] you you have the right to accept it or
[56:32] to reject it once you accept it it has
[56:35] become your word it has become your
[56:38] responsibility so is the word of God
[56:40] once we accepted that word of God it has
[56:43] become our word that's why elah I say
[56:46] unto you I say this I say because that
[56:49] word has become part of you amen so it's
[56:52] your responsibility not brother Abraham
[56:55] said not this one said when that word is
[56:57] revealed to you you can say I said this
[57:01] why because the same God in the prophet
[57:04] in him is in you and he's doing exact
[57:07] same thing so that has become so clear
[57:09] to you so you can confidently say that
[57:12] this is that this is that you are
[57:14] responsible for that don't hide from
[57:17] your
[57:18] responsibility Amen Let God have his own
[57:22] way Hallelujah let's work one love one
[57:25] another thank you and just be there for
[57:28] one another in times of whatever it is
[57:30] because when someone fall let them let's
[57:33] raise them
[57:34] up don't let push them down amen
[57:39] hallelujah praise God I don't talk too
[57:41] much so I'm going to end very shortly I
[57:44] have couple of quotes I'm going to read
[57:46] and then I'll keep on whatever the time
[57:48] is when hard God puts my heart I'm going
[57:52] to read this about the um the am of God
[57:58] hallelujah praise our
[58:01] God Amen and
[58:04] amen hallelujah it says that in
[58:07] paragraph 68 the armor of God now we
[58:10] find that this great enemy of God
[58:12] thought now as long as they believe that
[58:16] word I can never get to them as long as
[58:19] you believe that word the devil cannot
[58:21] get to you as long as that little family
[58:24] in Eden keeps
[58:26] behind that word I can never touch them
[58:31] neither can he today he cannot touch you
[58:34] today as long as you keep that word
[58:37] fortified with you that's right he still
[58:40] block of right but if I can use some
[58:43] real good strategy and just reason I
[58:48] give some human reasonings because she's
[58:51] human and if I can just give human
[58:54] reasoning then we win the battle Satan
[58:58] and his angels but then Eve gave away so
[59:03] therefore we know our enemy by his
[59:07] attacks maybe you didn't get it just
[59:10] right the way I said it we know our
[59:13] enemy when
[59:16] anyone any
[59:18] Spirit any person triy to disagree with
[59:22] God's word
[59:24] remember that that's your
[59:27] enemy that's your enemy we know this old
[59:32] attack that's the one he broke the human
[59:34] race down and that's the way he breaks
[59:37] them down yet today and that's the way
[59:40] he gets you away from God is to
[59:44] disbelieve his word and the only way
[59:47] that you can ever stay in fellowship
[59:49] with God and talk to him in the cool of
[59:53] the evening is say fortified in the word
[59:58] on both sides let the K of God's word
[1:00:02] drop all around you and you be dropped
[1:00:06] right in the middle of it that's right
[1:00:09] then you are
[1:00:10] fortified glory amen so anything that is
[1:00:16] agree with the word of God that's your
[1:00:19] enemy it's not your brother or your
[1:00:21] sister when that word comes and this is
[1:00:24] is contrary to God's word that's your
[1:00:27] enemy but if it's in line with the word
[1:00:30] of God then it's your brother it's your
[1:00:32] friend because said above all things are
[1:00:35] which thou May prosper and be in health
[1:00:38] even as heav as your soul prospered so
[1:00:42] God wants us to be healthy God wants us
[1:00:44] to prosper God wants us to proper in
[1:00:48] both in three dimensions Body Soul and
[1:00:52] Spirit and he said that the work that I
[1:00:56] do shall you also do amen because it was
[1:01:00] one Jesus Christ when he died he broke
[1:01:03] himself into many member bodies and it
[1:01:07] was a bra bra as a wave sheep God took
[1:01:10] him we have many member body so we are
[1:01:15] the ones that God is using for today so
[1:01:19] greater than this shall you also what do
[1:01:23] because he gave us power over every
[1:01:25] cleans gave us power over the enemy he
[1:01:28] said in my name you shall cast out
[1:01:31] Devils when you lay your hands on the
[1:01:33] sick they shall recover it's a promise
[1:01:36] to the believer we just have to accept
[1:01:39] it when a situation happens when a
[1:01:41] condition happen apply the word of God
[1:01:45] don't listen to the doctor's
[1:01:48] report their reports are always
[1:01:53] negative but God's report is positive
[1:01:56] amen so I believe God's
[1:01:59] report
[1:02:01] amen yes you have to go to the doctor
[1:02:05] yes you have to take the medication yes
[1:02:08] you have to do everything human possibly
[1:02:11] that you can do but your eyes is on the
[1:02:14] word of God your eyes is on Christ
[1:02:17] because he was the one who was wounded
[1:02:20] for what your transgressions bruised for
[1:02:23] your iniquities the Chas of our peace
[1:02:27] was upon him and with the stripes we
[1:02:30] were
[1:02:31] healed
[1:02:33] period that's what the word of God is
[1:02:35] for me so accept that promise and move
[1:02:39] on with your life no matter what don't
[1:02:42] listen to Devil's
[1:02:45] lie he is a Lie from pit of Hell and he
[1:02:50] has no power over you than the one you
[1:02:54] going to give him so I chose not to give
[1:02:58] him
[1:02:59] a opportunity I chose to surrender my
[1:03:03] heart my soul my mind everything the
[1:03:06] Lord Jesus Christ that God will have
[1:03:08] prence listen if this gospel is truth
[1:03:13] and I believe it is truth amen then I
[1:03:16] owe
[1:03:18] everything my soul my mind my everything
[1:03:21] I owe to this gospel I support it with
[1:03:25] my mind my ti my money my
[1:03:28] everything I have to support it because
[1:03:30] listen the same thing the apostles when
[1:03:34] they realized and it was revealed to
[1:03:37] them that Jesus Christ was God they gave
[1:03:40] their life for the
[1:03:41] gospel they sold everything they have
[1:03:44] they gave their life they allow they
[1:03:47] gave their life some they cut their head
[1:03:49] They Crucified Peter um what his head
[1:03:52] down they put John in the oil to burn
[1:03:55] him because they know this is that set
[1:03:57] this is the truth so if you have come to
[1:04:00] that
[1:04:01] point and we know this is
[1:04:05] absolute and there's nothing that come
[1:04:08] close to this then I give my all to this
[1:04:12] it doesn't matter what I go through
[1:04:14] doesn't matter what tomorrow may bring
[1:04:17] I'm Standing on the Promises of God
[1:04:20] because that promise will never fail
[1:04:23] Heaven and Earth will pass away God's
[1:04:24] word will not pass away my friends will
[1:04:26] disappoint me my wife can disappoint me
[1:04:29] my children everyone can disappoint me
[1:04:32] but God will never disappoint you what a
[1:04:34] friend we have in Jesus what a FAL St of
[1:04:37] a glory Divine where you have to commit
[1:04:40] every to him in prayer he's the only one
[1:04:43] who not cannot disappoint you there's
[1:04:46] nothing in this way that you can put
[1:04:47] your hand 100% on it apart from
[1:04:51] him he is a source of your supply not
[1:04:55] your boss
[1:04:56] as pastor always told us God uses those
[1:04:58] bosses don't get me wrong I'm not being
[1:05:01] arrogant you respect your boss and do it
[1:05:04] with all your heart but behind that the
[1:05:09] source of your supply is God himself
[1:05:13] amen he promised he will never leave us
[1:05:16] nor forsake us so let's trust him no
[1:05:20] matter what comes he promise he going to
[1:05:23] take us through it's not
[1:05:26] easy with all the troubles and all the
[1:05:29] Temptations and as the Bible says that
[1:05:32] evil day we are living in I'm not saying
[1:05:34] it's a
[1:05:35] joke but when we apply this word of God
[1:05:40] to every
[1:05:41] situation every time we're going to have
[1:05:45] Victory we going to have victory victory
[1:05:48] in Jesus Christ victory is mine amen
[1:05:51] victory is mine Joy is mine Hallelujah
[1:05:54] through the word of
[1:05:56] God that word of God will defeat him at
[1:06:00] any point at any point in time amen so
[1:06:06] hallelujah amen my sins are gone amen
[1:06:10] I've been born the amen hallelujah I've
[1:06:13] been set free Amazing Grace amen
[1:06:18] hallelujah amen
[1:06:21] listen I believe
[1:06:24] that God has call us as his
[1:06:27] children it doesn't matter how much the
[1:06:31] level that we have reached in
[1:06:34] Christ everyone of us needed just a
[1:06:36] closer work with God just a closer walk
[1:06:40] with him every day in our lives that
[1:06:43] should be our prayer all the time a
[1:06:45] closer walk with him all the time walk
[1:06:48] with him closely let him walk with us
[1:06:51] closely as he walk Enoch walk with him
[1:06:54] and you walk and was not so let's walk
[1:06:58] closer to him let's ask him every time
[1:07:00] for a closer walk with him that's only
[1:07:03] now dress closer to him and when you
[1:07:06] walk closer to him when everything comes
[1:07:09] he give you the
[1:07:10] inspiration without even thinking about
[1:07:13] it he make it easy for you I love the
[1:07:15] testimony that gave when he was thinking
[1:07:18] about the presence of God came when that
[1:07:20] thing came you know that said the Lord
[1:07:23] nothing can hinder it it will come to
[1:07:27] pass amen so let's walk closer to him
[1:07:31] and just do our best and the last
[1:07:33] scripture in Ephesians said that praying
[1:07:37] always with all prayer and supplication
[1:07:42] in the spirit and watching there on to
[1:07:45] with all
[1:07:47] perseverance perseverance desperation
[1:07:50] and supplication for all the
[1:07:54] saints sometimes I I wonder that we are
[1:07:56] not desperate
[1:07:58] enough this is a desperate
[1:08:02] hour when you read the news and you see
[1:08:05] things that are going on it's not a time
[1:08:08] to
[1:08:09] sleep it's time to be
[1:08:12] desperate in every
[1:08:14] situation yes we are God's children yes
[1:08:18] we are saved yes we are part of him but
[1:08:23] God cannot do anything unless he uses s
[1:08:27] and you remember that in Hebrew samel
[1:08:29] said that all
[1:08:31] those they are all Wai on it all the
[1:08:35] saints of old the prophets whatever they
[1:08:38] wanted they did everything and they
[1:08:41] without us cannot obtain the promise
[1:08:45] they are waiting on us so it put a lot
[1:08:47] of responsibility on our show this when
[1:08:50] you realize that but what makes it easy
[1:08:54] is that we realize we cannot do by
[1:08:56] ourselves so we ask for the grace of God
[1:08:59] the mercy of God and he takes the burden
[1:09:01] and he take care of every situation amen
[1:09:04] so that's all I have for tonight I know
