[34:39] activities after. Also, as you know, we
[34:42] will be um uh removing all of the pews
[34:45] today after the service. We've removed
[34:47] some. Yesterday, the brothers were here.
[34:50] It was very efficient. And we ask that
[34:53] if you're available and you can help, it
[34:56] won't take long. It could be if depends
[34:59] on the number of people, you know, it
[35:00] could be three hours, uh you know, but
[35:02] if your children in the Sunday school,
[35:04] you can help out just to carry a few of
[35:06] the pieces because we're storing
[35:07] everything in the in the trailer.
[35:10] storage unit that we have here. And so
[35:12] we would appreciate your help making
[35:15] many light work. Amen. Praise God. And
[35:18] so we thank God for that. Be patient.
[35:21] The air conditioning, I know it's been a
[35:22] bit of a challenge, but there's been
[35:24] many parts. It's a it's an older system,
[35:27] but by God's grace, it's still a very
[35:29] good system, and we are replacing the
[35:32] parts that uh that are necessary to be
[35:35] replaced, but it takes time to get these
[35:37] parts. We've got now parts coming in
[35:39] hopefully by mid to the end of this week
[35:43] when our new chairs are going to be
[35:44] arriving. Tomorrow they're going to be
[35:47] steam cleaning professionally all of the
[35:49] carpets so that we'll have a nice fresh
[35:52] scent in the house of the Lord. Amen. Uh
[35:55] on top of his wonderful uh sweet savor
[35:59] of his presence as he's with us here at
[36:02] each and every service. Amen. Praise
[36:04] God. So, we're doing things. We
[36:07] appreciate everyone that's supporting,
[36:10] that's being there. Uh, Sister Sheila
[36:12] called me yesterday, Sister Sheila
[36:15] Elanga, and you know, she says,
[36:17] "Brother, I received the email about,
[36:20] you know, um being uh looking for
[36:23] helpers for the house of the Lord." She
[36:26] says, "We want to do something. We want
[36:28] to help. We know that the people are
[36:30] going to be there on next Saturday, July
[36:33] the 12th." She says she wants to buy
[36:36] food for all the workers. Her and her
[36:39] husband Patrick are going to contribute
[36:42] so that you will be fed. So if you come,
[36:44] you're going to receive food. Amen. So
[36:47] the Lord has a way of blessing each and
[36:50] everyone when they recognize that
[36:52] there's something that they can do and
[36:54] they do it. Praise God. They do it and
[36:58] they get their blessing in whatever
[37:00] capacity. Amen. If you can't send, give.
[37:05] If you can't, you know, be there, then
[37:08] give towards it to make the work easier
[37:11] for those that are available to do it.
[37:14] And we're not looking at anybody
[37:16] differently or anything else. Everybody
[37:18] has their part in the body of Christ. We
[37:22] want you to recognize it and we want you
[37:24] to receive your blessing in whatever
[37:26] capacity that the Lord wants to bless
[37:28] you. Amen. Praise God. And so, um, thank
[37:32] you to everybody that's, uh, that's
[37:34] that's participating. I want to let you
[37:36] know that uh Friday um I attended the
[37:40] Oakville in in Oakville Italian
[37:44] Invitational Golf Tournament which you
[37:46] know um has been uh something that we've
[37:49] been a part of now for many years but in
[37:52] particular over the last five or six
[37:55] years they've decided to make us Good
[37:58] Neighbor Ministries youth ministry a
[38:02] part of their fundraising.
[38:05] and they have uh generously given
[38:09] towards our young people's ministry. I
[38:12] was there on Friday. I was able to pray
[38:15] the opening prayer for the dinner and
[38:17] then they asked me to come up and say a
[38:19] few words about our youth camp and our
[38:22] youth ministry and how the young people
[38:25] and I talked to them about how the young
[38:26] people is our future generation and how
[38:29] the Lord um is still interceding in the
[38:32] lives of young people. Amen. And that
[38:35] the Lord moves in mysterious ways and
[38:38] you just never know when he's going to
[38:40] intercede. And so I let them know that
[38:43] they by giving whatever little part they
[38:46] may give, they are contributing to a
[38:49] life that uh would potentially have the
[38:53] ability to serve the Lord Jesus and have
[38:56] their lives transformed by the word of
[38:58] God. Amen. So we want to thank God. We
[39:02] are um again going to be receiving a
[39:05] wonderful $10,000
[39:08] uh donation towards our young people's
[39:10] ministry which has allowed us not to
[39:13] just run our camp. Amen. Praise God.
[39:18] You know, uh to make our camp completely
[39:21] free to those that want to attend and we
[39:25] provide anything that we can possibly
[39:27] provide to make it work. Nobody is
[39:31] excluded. You can invite your friends
[39:33] from school. You can invite anybody. You
[39:36] know, somebody that has a need of God in
[39:39] their lives, invite them. Let them come
[39:41] out and hear the word of God because the
[39:43] word is what sets the captives free.
[39:47] Amen. Praise God. So, thank you very
[39:49] much um to the Oakville Italian
[39:52] Invitational, to um John Paladino, John
[39:57] Kusi, and Carmen Bonfilio, who are the
[40:00] organizers of this event. It's run for
[40:03] almost 50 years, and they've they've
[40:05] raised hundreds and hundreds of
[40:07] thousands of dollars, even maybe over a
[40:10] million dollars, and have given to some
[40:12] very worthy causes. Amen. They're giving
[40:15] this year to brain cancer research. Um,
[40:19] another uh place where young people also
[40:24] benefit children's, you know. So,
[40:26] they're they're they're they're looking
[40:28] for unique opportunities and I thank God
[40:32] that he's chosen our ministry to be a
[40:35] unique opportunity. May God bless them,
[40:38] continue to pray for them, and may the
[40:40] Lord pour out a blessing upon them that
[40:42] they won't even be able to contain.
[40:44] Amen. Praise God. So, upcoming young
[40:49] people's ministry, July 19th to the 20th
[40:52] at Grace Tabernacle. We want to remind
[40:54] our young people if you can be there,
[40:57] go. Amen. Be there. Be blessed. Receive
[41:01] the word of God from Pastor Aleister
[41:03] Francis. He's a wonderful minister of
[41:05] the word of God. I believe he'll have
[41:08] the Lord will have something really a as
[41:11] a tremendous blessing to the young
[41:12] people. Amen. So, if you can make it,
[41:16] you definitely want to be there. We want
[41:17] to remember Sister Michelle and Sister
[41:19] Meline. They'll be traveling. I believe
[41:21] they're leaving this week to go to
[41:23] Norway. Is it Norway they're going? Yes.
[41:25] They're going to be uh attending some
[41:27] youth ministry out that way. And uh may
[41:30] the Lord watch over them and protect
[41:32] them. Keep them in your prayers that the
[41:34] Lord will meet them exactly and meet
[41:37] their needs exactly what he has for them
[41:39] there. Sometimes we got to go to the
[41:41] different sides of the world to find
[41:44] what God has for us. Whatever it is,
[41:48] there's no distance with the Lord. Amen.
[41:51] Praise God. And so, let's just go to
[41:53] prayer now. Let's all stand. We're going
[41:55] to go to the word of God.
[41:58] Father, we so appreciate this wonderful
[42:01] ministry that you have placed here at
[42:04] Good Neighbor Ministries and all the
[42:06] saints that have gathered here today
[42:09] that are gathering online that Lord have
[42:12] recognized the word for their day and
[42:16] the hour that you are now making
[42:18] yourself known. Lord, I can't bring
[42:23] anything
[42:25] different. There's nothing new under the
[42:27] sun, but all I can do is surrender this
[42:30] vessel to your service and for your use
[42:33] and for your glory. And Lord, we ask
[42:35] that you would your spirit would just
[42:37] anoint the people to hear the word of
[42:39] God and that they might receive the the
[42:42] portion that they have need of to meet
[42:45] the challenges of their day, Lord, and
[42:47] the the things that they're dealing with
[42:48] personally, Lord. That's one thing about
[42:50] you that that's so great, Lord. you you
[42:53] can discern personally every life and
[42:56] every situation. And that's what makes
[42:59] you so great. That's what that's what
[43:01] called us, each and every one of us,
[43:03] Lord. That's why we're here this
[43:05] morning, because it's a reality, Lord.
[43:07] We don't come as tradition. We come to
[43:10] feed upon you. You are the word. You are
[43:14] the messenger. You are the angel to the
[43:16] church. We are your mouthpiece. We are
[43:19] your hearers. We are your body. May you
[43:23] take control now. Father, bless your
[43:25] people. Remember Meline and and Michelle
[43:28] as they travel. Lord, protect them,
[43:31] watch over them, guide them. Any of the
[43:33] saints that are going on vacation
[43:35] wherever they may go, Lord. Protect and
[43:37] watch over. Meet every need. Lord, bring
[43:40] them safely home back to the fold into
[43:44] the household of faith. We pray Lord as
[43:46] we commit this day and this service now
[43:49] into your hands in Jesus Christ's name.
[43:52] Amen. And amen. Let's go to the
[43:55] scripture.
[43:58] We are continuing. I don't know how long
[44:00] this is going to go, saints.
[44:03] We're just going to have to see what the
[44:04] Lord is going to reveal as we minister
[44:08] the word of God and as you come with
[44:10] expectation in your hearts. If you
[44:13] expect, you will receive. It's as simple
[44:15] as that. We believe in the supernatural.
[44:17] We're looking at understanding our
[44:20] existence. And today is part three
[44:24] actually because part two was on
[44:25] Wednesday night. We did a little quick
[44:27] overview on the dimensions and the seven
[44:30] dimensions. Today we're going to be
[44:31] going a little deeper into them and how
[44:34] they pertain to our existence, how they
[44:37] pertain and affect our existence.
[44:41] Because if you can't understand
[44:44] how this dimension works, then you're
[44:47] going to be tossed about to and fro by
[44:49] the enemy. Let's read our first
[44:51] scripture. It's a scripture that we read
[44:53] last week, but just a little shorter
[44:55] version for from Colossians 1:1 16. It
[44:59] says, "For by him were all things
[45:02] created
[45:04] that are in heaven and that are in
[45:06] earth, visible and invisible, whether
[45:10] they be thrones or dominions or
[45:13] principalities or powers. All things
[45:16] were created by him and for him. And he
[45:21] is before all things, and by him all
[45:24] things consist.
[45:26] And he is the head of the body, the
[45:28] church, who is the beginning, the
[45:31] firstborn from the dead, that in all
[45:34] things he might have the preeminence.
[45:38] Amen. The Lord add his blessings to the
[45:40] word. You may be seated. I need a little
[45:42] more monitor. Little more monitor. Amen.
[45:46] Praise God. Glory to God. And so I just
[45:50] want to ask um are they prepared to play
[45:53] the YouTube video
[45:56] that we played on Wednesday night?
[46:02] Okay. On Wednesday night, we looked at
[46:05] uh you can go to the next slide. We
[46:07] looked at um the the the the seven
[46:10] dimensions. And it's so important for us
[46:13] to understand these dimensions and why
[46:16] it's important for us to understand them
[46:18] because it affects directly
[46:21] who you are, why you've been called,
[46:24] what it is that you're um called to
[46:28] actually
[46:29] manifest in the hour that you're in. the
[46:33] challenges that you have to face and
[46:35] overcome while you are in your position
[46:40] as a son or daughter of God. And
[46:42] there's, you know, uh just a little bit
[46:45] too much highs. Um and and without this
[46:49] understanding of these dimensions, you
[46:52] will not have a clear understanding of
[46:54] your existence and your purpose and what
[46:58] it is and how it is that you're going to
[47:00] produce the rapture. Because this is the
[47:02] message of this hour. It produces the
[47:06] rapture of the church. And the rapture
[47:10] is interdimensional change
[47:13] dimensions. A lot of people, you know,
[47:16] they have they have a a concept of
[47:18] heaven and hell and they place it, you
[47:20] know, as a heaven that's way way above
[47:23] us and a hell that's way way way below
[47:25] us. But no, heaven is a dimension where
[47:29] God exists. But within that realm of
[47:34] seven dimensions, there's other
[47:36] dimensions. There's the there's the
[47:38] dimension of of uh the the the fifth
[47:41] dimension which is the region of the
[47:43] lost. And then within those seven is the
[47:46] six which is the re region of the
[47:48] redeemed. And in God in the beginning
[47:51] when he created all things, these
[47:53] dimensions did not exist. They didn't
[47:56] actually exist at that time because
[47:58] dimensions were created for existence,
[48:02] for something to exist in that
[48:05] dimension. So in other words, when God
[48:07] created angels, they were not in a
[48:10] fallen condition when they first were
[48:12] created. But then when Lucifer deceived
[48:16] them and caused them to fall, they were
[48:20] fallen angels. They could not they could
[48:22] no longer exist in the realm where where
[48:26] there was the redee where where there
[48:29] was nonfallen angels that ones that that
[48:32] were under the leadership of the Holy
[48:35] Spirit under the leadership of God
[48:37] himself. So God then created that
[48:41] dimension for the lost angels for those
[48:44] that repented not those that those that
[48:48] rebelled against the word of God. Okay.
[48:50] So anyways, we're going to be looking at
[48:52] this more in depth and I trust that you
[48:55] will you will pull on the word of God so
[48:58] that you can receive understanding
[49:00] because revelation will set you free.
[49:04] Revelation of healing healing is a
[49:09] revelation and an understanding of
[49:11] dimensions.
[49:13] There's there's an understanding behind
[49:15] all of that because there's a dimension
[49:18] where there is no sickness.
[49:20] Amen.
[49:21] In that dimension of the redeemed,
[49:23] brother Brandham was able to go there.
[49:25] He said nothing but perfect love could
[49:27] enter into that place.
[49:29] There was no sickness in that place.
[49:32] There was perfect humans in young
[49:36] 21year-old
[49:37] roughly aged bodies. Amen. God can
[49:42] create bodies that are a certain age
[49:48] because we we identify with age because
[49:52] of our human understanding of you know
[49:55] of communication and words. We identify
[49:58] with age as something that correlates to
[50:01] time. But in God there is no time. And
[50:04] he can create an individual 21 years old
[50:08] or he can create them 82 years old.
[50:10] Amen.
[50:11] It's got no relevance. And that's why
[50:13] you can see now that the world could
[50:15] have been a a billion years old. It's
[50:17] irrelevant.
[50:19] It's totally irrelevant when it comes to
[50:21] God because we read the scripture that
[50:23] all things were created by him and for
[50:27] him.
[50:29] You see what I'm saying? So, so this is
[50:31] so important. It sounds simple, but
[50:34] let's let's dig. Let's pull. Let's see
[50:37] what the Lord is going to reveal.
[50:39] Because you can receive your healing
[50:42] just by an understanding of of of of the
[50:45] of the dimension that you are right now
[50:48] being being pressed into.
[50:51] Because we are we are being translated.
[50:54] Remember, we're going to be translated
[50:55] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye.
[50:58] We're not going to be going a million
[50:59] miles from here. No, we're going to be
[51:01] going from this dimension into that
[51:04] sixth dimension
[51:06] if we happen to leave before the
[51:08] rapture.
[51:10] And all that's going to happen is that
[51:11] if this earthly tabernacle dissolved,
[51:14] there's another one waiting. That's why
[51:16] if you read the Colossians, it started
[51:18] out that there are bodies, celestial
[51:21] earthly bodies, earthy, and there are
[51:24] the spiritual bodies. You see, those are
[51:26] bodies that exist in other dimensions.
[51:31] And so, understanding that will place
[51:33] you in a clearer understanding of who
[51:37] you really are and what it is that God
[51:40] is is looking to produce in your life in
[51:44] order to produce the rapture.
[51:47] There's an understanding to the rapture,
[51:50] to your existence, but it comes by
[51:52] revelation. So you have to have your
[51:55] spiritual ears on and open here today.
[52:00] Amen. Do you have that ready?
[52:04] Yes.
[52:05] Okay. Just listen here. This just we we
[52:08] listen to this on Wednesday, but I want
[52:10] you to hear it again just as we use it
[52:13] as a backdrop and move into our service
[52:17] this morning. Now remember the charge
[52:21] was if we'll study that for a moment. I
[52:24] charge thee before God in the Lord Jesus
[52:26] Christ who shall judge the quick and the
[52:29] dead at is appearing in his kingdom. See
[52:33] judge charge ye before God in Christ
[52:37] that you that you preach the word.
[52:42] And so help me to this night. As far as
[52:46] I have any knowledge of, I've never
[52:48] preached nothing but the word. See, and
[52:51] stayed right with it. It's been a lot of
[52:52] trouble. I've went through lots of
[52:54] persecutions, lots of trials, had to
[52:58] separate from many precious friends
[53:00] because of that very statement. Preach
[53:04] the word. And I I remember in the vision
[53:08] or the little translation as I would
[53:11] call it reasoning where I was taken and
[53:13] saw those people looked back to myself
[53:16] and all those millions there and I said
[53:20] I want to see Jesus and he said he's
[53:22] higher. Well see when people die
[53:28] they they don't immediately go up with
[53:32] God. Now you I'm sure you'll understand
[53:35] that. Maybe I'll explain it the best
[53:37] that I can. Are you in a hurry?
[53:41] Let's take our time and and and try to
[53:44] make it just as clear as I can. Now when
[53:48] we come along,
[53:50] we remember that we live here in three
[53:54] dimensions. And I don't know what I can
[53:57] name them or not. One of them is light
[54:00] and the other is matter.
[54:03] Tommy, you remember what the third is?
[54:04] Huh? Adam,
[54:07] time right now. Light, matter, and time.
[54:13] And our five senses contact them
[54:16] dimensions. Our sight contacts light.
[54:19] Our feeling contacts matters and so
[54:23] forth. Now, but we have contact through
[54:27] science. the fourth dimension as it was
[54:31] because coming right through this
[54:32] building now comes pictures, voices of
[54:36] radio, pictures on television that our
[54:39] senses does not contact that but yet
[54:41] they have a a tube or crystal and picks
[54:45] up those ether waves and manifests them.
[54:48] So you see right in this building now
[54:52] is live actions of people in the air.
[54:57] Live voices. They're here. We know it.
[55:01] They're absolutely the truth. And the
[55:03] only thing you do is they catch it on. I
[55:05] don't understand the mechanics of of
[55:08] those things that science has invented.
[55:11] But we know that it proves to us there
[55:14] is a fourth dimension. Now the fifth
[55:18] dimension is where the sinner the
[55:20] unbeliever dies and goes to. The fifth
[55:24] dimension is the kind of the well the
[55:28] horrible dimension. Now this man when a
[55:32] Christian dies he goes into the sixth
[55:35] dimension and God is in the seventh
[55:38] dimension. Now then you see the
[55:42] Christian when he dies he goes under the
[55:45] altar of God right into the presence of
[55:48] God under the altar and he's at rest. To
[55:51] break it down when a man has a nightmare
[55:56] he's not altogether asleep. Neither is
[55:59] he awake. He's between sleep and awake.
[56:03] And that's what makes him have a
[56:04] horrible shaking and screaming because
[56:06] he's not asleep. He's not awake. And to
[56:10] take that shows where a man goes when he
[56:14] dies unconverted. He's lived his time
[56:17] up. He's dead on earth. And he cannot go
[56:20] in the presence of God because he's not
[56:22] fit to go there without the blood. And
[56:24] he's caught. He cannot come back to
[56:26] earth because his time's finished here
[56:28] on earth. And he's caught between and
[56:29] he's in a nightmare.
[56:31] See, he can't go in the presence of God
[56:33] to rest. He can't back come to earth
[56:35] because his time's up. He's in a
[56:37] nightmare. And there he stays until the
[56:39] day of the judgment.
[56:40] Amen.
[56:41] A horrible thing to be in. See, and now
[56:46] in this vision, I believe I was caught
[56:50] that sixth dimension,
[56:53] looking back down here and could see
[56:57] back. See, the sight isn't exactly with
[57:01] the eyes. That's earthly. But sight is a
[57:04] greater thing than the sight that they
[57:06] have there. Their contact is far beyond
[57:11] any contact that our natural senses
[57:13] would contact.
[57:17] Amen. Praise God.
[57:21] Wonderful saints to have been given the
[57:25] understanding
[57:27] through a vindicated prophet in the 20th
[57:30] century that not only just decided he
[57:34] would you know make uh a you know
[57:37] comments on it or what he thought he
[57:40] actually experienced it
[57:42] and this is why it's so important to
[57:44] recognize Malachi 4:5 Revelations 101-7
[57:49] that God sent a prophet in the 20th
[57:52] century. I know it's hard for people to
[57:54] accept, but they need to search the
[57:57] scriptures
[57:58] and see what the scripture says about
[58:01] this time, this season, this age.
[58:04] And not only did he, you know, he he was
[58:07] given the ability to go there and
[58:09] actually experience these dimensions, he
[58:12] was like a he was like a a a a a
[58:15] receiver that could actually look into
[58:17] that dimension. And that's why when the
[58:19] prayer lines of the people would come up
[58:21] before him, he would look and and all of
[58:24] a sudden he'd see a vision of them at
[58:27] the doctors the day before saw the
[58:29] doctor's name uh see would see his name
[58:32] right on his lapel or you know uh the
[58:35] office describe the scene exactly what
[58:37] the doctor exactly said would tell them
[58:40] that he told you that you've got so much
[58:42] time to live and this and this and that.
[58:44] But the Holy Spirit is here to say,
[58:46] "Thus sayaeth the Lord, you'll not die,
[58:48] but you will live." And there are
[58:51] hundreds and thousands of people that
[58:54] went through those prayer lines that by
[58:56] the spirit of God, not the man, no man
[58:59] can heal. It's God who heals.
[59:01] Amen.
[59:02] Amen. But he vindicated that man because
[59:06] the man, William Brandham, had a
[59:08] message. And signs and wonders shall
[59:11] follow them. Amen. to catch the
[59:13] attention of the people. And that's why
[59:15] it's important to hear and to listen
[59:18] what God's prophet has told us in these
[59:21] last days. If it's from the scripture,
[59:23] you can say, "Amen."
[59:25] Praise God. If it's a man's teaching or
[59:28] man's ideas, then let it alone. Don't
[59:31] have to do nothing with it. Just leave
[59:33] it alone. God will vindicate and confirm
[59:37] his own word and show what is truth and
[59:40] what is error. Amen. Praise God. And so
[59:45] we understand now that these dimensions,
[59:48] these are only places of existence. Hell
[59:51] is not a burning hell like people say,
[59:54] you know, people, that was the
[59:56] Pentecostal teachings that they would,
[59:57] you know, they would say, "Hey, if you
[59:59] don't repent right now, if you die right
[1:00:01] now as a sinner, you're going to go to a
[1:00:03] burning hell." That's a lie. They would
[1:00:06] tell him, "You're going to a burning
[1:00:08] eternal hell." That's a lie. Do you know
[1:00:11] that even brother Brandham back in 1957
[1:00:15] said, you know, in a message that he
[1:00:17] says, "We need stronger pulpits. We need
[1:00:19] individual ministers to get out there
[1:00:21] and tell the people that the that if
[1:00:23] they don't repent, they're going to go
[1:00:24] to an eternal hell." That's brother
[1:00:27] Brandham speaking back in 1957.
[1:00:30] But then something took place through
[1:00:32] the opening of those seals that changed
[1:00:34] absolutely everything. And that's why
[1:00:37] this church exists. That's why you are
[1:00:40] in the pew that you're in this morning
[1:00:42] under this ministry is because you've
[1:00:44] recognized a dispensational change and
[1:00:48] that the Holy Spirit has now opened the
[1:00:50] book which is the Bible which is the
[1:00:53] understanding of the word to not only
[1:00:56] open our understanding to who we are but
[1:00:59] our understanding of the of of the
[1:01:01] dimensions and the levels of God's
[1:01:04] existence
[1:01:05] so that we can better understand his
[1:01:07] purpose and his plan for each and every
[1:01:10] one of us here at this time. Amen. And
[1:01:14] so, uh, our our understanding has been
[1:01:17] has been opened up by the opening of
[1:01:20] those seals because it unveiled the
[1:01:21] mysteries of God. So, hell is not a
[1:01:24] burning. No, hell, it's it's in that
[1:01:26] fifth dimension. And that's the
[1:01:29] dimension where people go that, you
[1:01:30] know, that just don't accept the word.
[1:01:34] They don't want to repent. They don't
[1:01:36] want to they don't want to believe that
[1:01:38] God is doing something today and that
[1:01:41] there's a present truth. And so because
[1:01:44] they they rejected the word and all
[1:01:46] those demons and all those fallen
[1:01:48] angels, that's all the demons are. You
[1:01:50] don't need to be afraid of demons. Get
[1:01:53] that? You know, whenever you think of
[1:01:55] demons, right away you see, you know,
[1:01:57] like this ugly looking thing with long
[1:01:59] teeth and long hair that's going to
[1:02:01] attack you. That's not that's that's all
[1:02:04] lies. You don't want to be caught up
[1:02:06] into those fantasies. You need to
[1:02:09] understand that they're fallen angels.
[1:02:12] They're people that were created that
[1:02:14] that have fallen that have rebelled
[1:02:17] against the word of God and have
[1:02:18] rejected God. And now Satan has them as
[1:02:22] his messengers. In the same way that God
[1:02:26] has his angels that encamp about that
[1:02:29] those that love him
[1:02:31] that are encamped about your life even
[1:02:33] right now protecting and watching over
[1:02:36] you, your children, your family because
[1:02:39] of your faith in the word of God. You've
[1:02:42] accepted the absolute that there is a
[1:02:44] God, a self-existent one that has
[1:02:47] created all of this for his purpose and
[1:02:50] for his glory. and you're just you're
[1:02:53] you're blessed to be able to recognize
[1:02:55] it and to see it and to be a part of it
[1:02:58] and you can walk with confidence knowing
[1:03:01] that you're walking with God and that
[1:03:03] you're your your future is clear that if
[1:03:06] you were to if the if the Lord was to
[1:03:08] take you right now, you would be going
[1:03:10] to the to the dimension of the redeemed,
[1:03:13] the place where brother Brandham went
[1:03:15] and saw and we're going to look at that
[1:03:16] and we're going to talk about it and
[1:03:18] just to, you know, just to look deeper
[1:03:20] into it all so that we can set the right
[1:03:22] expectations as Christians in this day
[1:03:25] and in this hour.
[1:03:26] Amen.
[1:03:27] The world's falling apart. There's wars,
[1:03:30] rumors of wars. There's things that are
[1:03:32] going on that that are causing terrible
[1:03:34] havoc. But you are a separated people.
[1:03:39] If you've accepted Jesus Christ as your
[1:03:42] absolute, which is the word,
[1:03:45] you've placed the word as your shield,
[1:03:48] then you're you're protected. You're
[1:03:50] surrounded. You're encamped about by
[1:03:52] God's angels.
[1:03:54] Amen. Satan takes his demon angels and
[1:03:57] says, "You see that individual there?
[1:03:59] He's causing a lot of havoc, but he
[1:04:01] still doesn't quite understand
[1:04:03] dimensions. He still doesn't understand
[1:04:05] the existence and his own existence. And
[1:04:08] he's he's afraid of demons.
[1:04:11] You shouldn't be afraid of demons.
[1:04:14] You should not be afraid of demons. You
[1:04:16] don't have to take six brothers with you
[1:04:18] or five people with you and go into a
[1:04:20] prayer meeting before you go in and pray
[1:04:22] for somebody that's sick because you
[1:04:24] know that that sickness is just a
[1:04:26] spirit.
[1:04:28] That's all it is. But you should have a
[1:04:31] a level of faith right now. This is the
[1:04:34] this is the faith that we're growing
[1:04:35] into, saints.
[1:04:37] This is what this is all about. We're
[1:04:39] not talking about dimensions here. We're
[1:04:41] talking about your faith and your
[1:04:42] revelation and understanding on the word
[1:04:46] of God, which gives you confidence and
[1:04:48] authority
[1:04:50] to stand in front of anybody that's sick
[1:04:54] and lay your hands upon them as a son or
[1:04:56] a daughter of God and say just like
[1:04:59] Jesus when Jesus was on earth,
[1:05:02] he just walked into the room. He just
[1:05:04] walked into the place. He'd walk into
[1:05:06] the city. A man's would come running
[1:05:08] with his son. Jesus would just look and
[1:05:10] say, "Satan, come out."
[1:05:12] That's all he had to do.
[1:05:15] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:05:16] It's not about, "Oh, I can cast out
[1:05:18] demons because I'm a church member and
[1:05:20] you got to you got to take six, seven
[1:05:21] people with you to go camp." It's
[1:05:23] because you're afraid.
[1:05:25] Glory to God.
[1:05:27] Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Jesus said,
[1:05:29] "Don't rejoice
[1:05:31] that you can cast out demons, but
[1:05:33] rejoice rather that your name is written
[1:05:36] in the Lamb's book of life before the
[1:05:39] foundations of the world." And when you
[1:05:41] come to know that, you've got a
[1:05:43] different kind of authority, brother.
[1:05:45] Let me tell you, you can walk into a
[1:05:47] room and those demons are going to know
[1:05:49] that you know.
[1:05:51] Amen. spirits and and and and you know,
[1:05:55] rebellious spirits and all kinds of
[1:05:57] spirits that are still controlling
[1:05:59] people's lives in this place. They're
[1:06:01] not going to be able to come in here
[1:06:02] very much longer, if they even are.
[1:06:05] Because when they're coming into here,
[1:06:07] they're coming into the presence of God.
[1:06:10] We believe the mighty angel is in this
[1:06:12] place.
[1:06:13] And the spirit of God cannot where God
[1:06:17] is, there's liberty. Amen.
[1:06:19] And if you're coming into this place and
[1:06:21] you're still hiding certain spirits, it
[1:06:23] won't be too long that you'll either be
[1:06:25] gone
[1:06:26] or you'll be set free.
[1:06:28] Hallelujah. The word of God is to be
[1:06:31] preached in order to set the captives
[1:06:34] free.
[1:06:35] And as God takes us into the realms of
[1:06:37] faith to understand what the word is
[1:06:40] supposed to do, because this bride,
[1:06:42] she's coming into an understanding that
[1:06:45] she knows what to do with the word. And
[1:06:48] it's a confidence that comes on her. And
[1:06:50] when when God the father when he's
[1:06:52] looking down at you and he's saying,
[1:06:54] "Hm, hallelujah.
[1:06:57] This daughter, this son, boy, they're
[1:06:59] they're they're really coming into their
[1:07:00] position. They're accepting the word for
[1:07:03] their day. They're they're recognizing
[1:07:06] what I'm doing right now in their midst,
[1:07:08] and they are they they have they've got
[1:07:10] a confidence in them. Amen. Praise God."
[1:07:13] So that when you by faith come into a
[1:07:16] situation, those spirits you you
[1:07:19] shouldn't even have to say a word. They
[1:07:21] they will immediately just like when
[1:07:23] Jesus was walking in those spirits, they
[1:07:26] said, "Have you come to torment us
[1:07:27] before our time?"
[1:07:29] Amen.
[1:07:30] That's the kind of walk that we should
[1:07:32] have with the Lord. Amen.
[1:07:34] It's not easy, saints.
[1:07:36] It's not like I know it's easier said
[1:07:38] than done, but you just It's an
[1:07:40] understanding. It's a faith and I
[1:07:43] believe God is dropping it into the
[1:07:45] midst of his children now to receive
[1:07:48] this kind of faith
[1:07:49] so that we can overcome. Amen. Praise
[1:07:52] God forever more. And so I want to go to
[1:07:56] our scripture here. I want to read from
[1:07:58] St. John chapter 3
[1:08:00] uh verse 7-13
[1:08:02] because you know um Jesus himself
[1:08:06] was here and um he was you know and and
[1:08:10] I I want to draw from this uh an
[1:08:13] understanding
[1:08:14] um
[1:08:16] from the word of God how Jesus was
[1:08:19] actually talking about dimensions you
[1:08:21] know dimensions and and the and the
[1:08:23] understanding of your existence and your
[1:08:26] position as a son or daughter of God.
[1:08:28] It's in the word all over the place.
[1:08:31] You're going to see it everywhere. Now
[1:08:33] that your eyes of understanding are
[1:08:35] being enlightened by the opening of the
[1:08:37] word, when you go to read the word,
[1:08:40] you're going to see things that you that
[1:08:41] you see. Oh my, look at that. Praise
[1:08:43] God. There it is again. So here now
[1:08:45] Jesus in St. John chapter 3, we're going
[1:08:49] to read from 7 to13.
[1:08:51] He says, "Marvel not that I say unto
[1:08:53] thee, ye must be born again.
[1:08:56] The wind bloweth where it listeth, and
[1:08:59] thou hearest the sound thereof, but
[1:09:01] can't not tell whence it cometh, and
[1:09:04] whether it goeth. So is everyone that is
[1:09:07] born of the spirit. Now, you know that
[1:09:10] he's actually talking about realms of
[1:09:13] existence here.
[1:09:15] He's actually talking about that you're
[1:09:17] not going to see certain things that
[1:09:20] move in the spirit realm, but you need
[1:09:23] to be aware that that's where things
[1:09:25] take place.
[1:09:27] And that's why Nicodemus, he was he came
[1:09:30] to Jesus and he and he was looking. He
[1:09:32] says, you know, uh there's no question
[1:09:35] that thou art a man come from God. Let's
[1:09:37] let's look. And Nicodemus answered and
[1:09:39] said unto him, how can these things be?
[1:09:42] Jesus answered and said unto them, "Art
[1:09:44] thou a master of Israel and knowest not
[1:09:48] these things?"
[1:09:50] You see, Nicodemus
[1:09:52] was so caught up with the law that he
[1:09:56] failed to recognize the spirit
[1:09:59] and that Messiah was actually going to
[1:10:02] come to fulfill his word according to
[1:10:07] exactly the way he said he was going to
[1:10:10] do it in the scripture.
[1:10:12] They were reading all the scriptures.
[1:10:14] They were reading the Old Testament.
[1:10:16] They would read the Torah every Sabbath.
[1:10:18] And they would talk about the Messiah
[1:10:20] that he's going to come and everything
[1:10:22] else. But then when the word was
[1:10:24] actually made manifest
[1:10:27] in their day, which was Christ, God
[1:10:30] himself
[1:10:32] coming down from his self-existent
[1:10:36] seventh dimension
[1:10:39] picked up a body
[1:10:43] by the spoken word
[1:10:46] in Mary,
[1:10:49] created a body for himself. so that he
[1:10:52] could dwell in this dimension.
[1:10:55] What was he doing? He was coming from
[1:10:57] the seventh dimension into
[1:11:00] our dimension.
[1:11:02] Amen.
[1:11:03] In a human form.
[1:11:05] Amen.
[1:11:06] And we need to recognize that this was
[1:11:09] the process
[1:11:11] of how he was going to actually redeem
[1:11:15] the entire body of Jesus Christ. This
[1:11:18] was the first be remember it's the Old
[1:11:21] Testament. God above us. Jesus Christ
[1:11:24] comes on the scene. It's God with us.
[1:11:29] He goes off the scene in the form of a
[1:11:31] resurrection, sends back the Holy Ghost,
[1:11:33] which is himself,
[1:11:35] God in us.
[1:11:38] So this whole process is going on. And
[1:11:41] here Nicodemus is asking, "How is this?"
[1:11:44] And he says, "Verily I say unto thee, we
[1:11:46] speak that we know and testify that we
[1:11:49] have seen and ye receive not our
[1:11:52] witness. If I have told you earthly
[1:11:56] things, ye and ye believe not, how shall
[1:12:00] you believe if I tell you of heavenly
[1:12:02] things?" And this is pertaining to us
[1:12:06] too and to the people of this generation
[1:12:09] and how it is that they're they're
[1:12:11] they're they're claim to be Christians.
[1:12:14] They claim to know the word of God. We
[1:12:17] come to them with absolute scripture
[1:12:20] clear just like Jesus did when he come
[1:12:23] in, you know, riding on the full the ass
[1:12:26] on the full of a of a mule. And he comes
[1:12:29] into Jerusalem exactly according to
[1:12:31] Isaiah's prophecies. He he fulfilled uh
[1:12:35] the the prophecy in the Virgin Mary.
[1:12:37] Behold, a virgin shall conceive. All of
[1:12:40] these things, everything exactly
[1:12:43] according to his word. And yet they
[1:12:47] couldn't recognize it. And he says to
[1:12:49] them, if you can't even understand the
[1:12:51] earthly things, how you going to
[1:12:52] understand the spiritual things?
[1:12:56] And the spiritual things are
[1:12:57] understanding your existence
[1:13:00] in this realm as a son of God in a human
[1:13:05] body but little by little being
[1:13:08] transformed
[1:13:10] into the supernatural body because
[1:13:12] you've already come into contact with
[1:13:14] your theophony.
[1:13:15] Thank you Jesus.
[1:13:16] This message
[1:13:18] this message
[1:13:21] puts you in contact with your theophony.
[1:13:25] That's what this message does.
[1:13:29] Praise God. I don't want to get too far
[1:13:30] ahead of myself.
[1:13:32] So here now, he says, "If I've told you
[1:13:34] earthly things and you believe not, how
[1:13:36] shall you believe if I tell you heavenly
[1:13:38] things? And no man hath ascended up to
[1:13:41] heaven, but he that came down from
[1:13:43] heaven, even the Son of man which is in
[1:13:47] heaven." He's telling them right there,
[1:13:51] you're looking at me and nobody's gone
[1:13:53] into nobody's come uh uh you know, no
[1:13:56] man hath ascended. Nobody's gone into
[1:13:58] that seventh dimension. No man
[1:14:02] as of yet has ascended into that seventh
[1:14:05] dimension where that that was the place
[1:14:07] that when brother Brandham went to that
[1:14:09] sixth dimension and he saw them and he
[1:14:12] says, "I want to see Jesus." They said,
[1:14:15] "He's just a little higher." It didn't
[1:14:17] mean that he was, you know, you got to
[1:14:18] take these stairs and you got to go a
[1:14:20] little higher. No, he was in a he was in
[1:14:22] another realm of existence. He was in a
[1:14:24] higher dimension that moves at a higher
[1:14:27] frequency.
[1:14:29] And that's that's what that's what uh he
[1:14:32] was saying. He was in a higher
[1:14:34] dimension. And here now he's telling
[1:14:36] them clearly, I'm the one that came from
[1:14:41] that dimension
[1:14:43] that's here right now and there too.
[1:14:47] Amen.
[1:14:47] You know, people want to say, "Yeah, but
[1:14:49] Jesus was the son that was on the earth
[1:14:51] and the father was talking above, you
[1:14:54] know, and said, "This is my beloved son
[1:14:57] in whom I am pleased to dwell in."
[1:15:00] Listen even what he said. He was telling
[1:15:03] them because if you don't have an
[1:15:05] understanding of realms of existence
[1:15:09] and dimensions, you start to place
[1:15:11] things in a fantasy world and you start
[1:15:14] to picture things according to pictures
[1:15:16] in your mind.
[1:15:18] You know, like the mighty angel that's
[1:15:20] going to come down that came down in
[1:15:22] 1963
[1:15:23] and you know, he put one foot on the
[1:15:25] land and one foot on the sea. That was
[1:15:28] all what John saw.
[1:15:30] Yeah. It was in in type form. It was it
[1:15:34] was showing a prophecy of a future event
[1:15:39] of a realm of faith that was going to
[1:15:41] come to the sons and daughters of God by
[1:15:45] the mighty angel coming down. And people
[1:15:47] think that it was like an actual angel.
[1:15:50] No. All God did was he moved from the
[1:15:53] seventh dimension, come through the
[1:15:56] sixth dimension, picked up seven angels.
[1:15:59] Come on now. Amen.
[1:16:01] Picked up seven angels that that created
[1:16:03] a cloud formation
[1:16:05] and actually appeared in the heavens. So
[1:16:07] what what happened was there was an
[1:16:09] interdimensional
[1:16:10] uh transition right there and then and
[1:16:13] it was actually made available for
[1:16:15] people to see here on earth and caught
[1:16:17] in Science magazine, Life magazine and
[1:16:20] and we know that there was an earthly
[1:16:22] angel that was on Sunset Mountain right
[1:16:26] at that time that was receiving those
[1:16:28] seven angels. and the message of the
[1:16:31] opening of those seven seals.
[1:16:34] But don't picture it in your mind as as
[1:16:37] an angel, like a person with, you know,
[1:16:39] great big wings. No, it was God himself.
[1:16:43] In the same way that when Jesus said,
[1:16:46] you know, how can I tell you of these
[1:16:48] things? No man hath ascended up to
[1:16:49] heaven but he that came down from
[1:16:52] heaven.
[1:16:53] And and and even the son of man, who who
[1:16:56] was the son of man? It was him.
[1:16:59] He was telling them, "I am that son of
[1:17:02] man that standeth before thee. And not
[1:17:04] only am I standing before you, but I'm
[1:17:06] also up there because I exist in every
[1:17:09] realm."
[1:17:10] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:17:12] I I I'm the one that created.
[1:17:15] We read it in Colossians. All things
[1:17:17] exist by him and for him.
[1:17:20] Amen.
[1:17:21] You see, it's simple, saints, but we
[1:17:24] need to look at it and and understand it
[1:17:27] in in the right perspective so that we
[1:17:30] get the faith that we need in this time
[1:17:35] and season that we're living in. Now,
[1:17:37] watch. He goes on here. Let's let's go
[1:17:40] to the next slide. Now, this next slide,
[1:17:45] okay, anybody wants a copy of it, just
[1:17:47] let me know. send me an email or a text
[1:17:49] message. I'll send it to you. It's one
[1:17:50] that was done by message believers. I
[1:17:53] believe you know Bible way and even
[1:17:57] brother Lonnie Jenkins maybe had
[1:17:59] something but it's a it's a wonderful
[1:18:01] outline of the seven dimensions and you
[1:18:04] know um it just gives like you know
[1:18:06] breaks down all the different aspects of
[1:18:10] these dimensions and you know in here
[1:18:14] you know for like like like for example
[1:18:16] we know that that God is in the seventh
[1:18:18] dimension which is the highest form the
[1:18:20] highest level it's where he's the
[1:18:23] self-existent one, him alone. Amen.
[1:18:26] That's where he was. And and that's
[1:18:28] where he he started to create from
[1:18:30] himself. He started to speak from
[1:18:33] himself. He projected himself into the
[1:18:37] earth by Adam and so forth. And and if
[1:18:40] we look at this drawing here, there's
[1:18:43] there's just like I'm I'm not going to
[1:18:45] preach on the whole thing, okay? I'm
[1:18:47] I've I only picked it up because I would
[1:18:50] like to be able to give it to whoever
[1:18:51] wants it. And you can actually read it
[1:18:53] and you'll be blessed. You'll you you'll
[1:18:56] see like for example
[1:18:59] when Moses everything types God.
[1:19:02] Everything is a perfect perfect type of
[1:19:06] Christ in dimensions. God above us, God
[1:19:10] with us, God in us. And even if you know
[1:19:13] you look here and it talks about the
[1:19:15] holies of holies. Well, back in the days
[1:19:18] of Moses, the the the seventh dimension
[1:19:21] or the the realm where God was the
[1:19:23] pillar of fire himself was in the Holy
[1:19:26] of Holies. It was in the the the the the
[1:19:28] most inner court. It was the place where
[1:19:31] only he himself because God even said to
[1:19:35] Moses, "You're going to be God to the
[1:19:36] people." He was God's voice to the
[1:19:39] people.
[1:19:40] Amen. Aaron was his was his uh you know,
[1:19:43] his his mate. like you know just like
[1:19:46] Eve you know like they were working
[1:19:48] together and it was all showing type
[1:19:50] form exactly what God was was showing in
[1:19:54] type what he wants to fulfill in our own
[1:19:57] lives and the purpose even taking us
[1:20:00] right to the rapture and how we are
[1:20:02] going to actually come together for for
[1:20:04] for perfect faith for a rapture. Amen.
[1:20:08] All of it is all within it. And there's
[1:20:10] the outer court, the inner court, you
[1:20:13] know, and then it talks about, you know,
[1:20:14] the the the the the regions and all the
[1:20:17] different regions and so forth. It's an
[1:20:19] overview, okay? And it's available and
[1:20:21] that's the only reason I put it in there
[1:20:23] because I know some people have been
[1:20:25] asking me for,
[1:20:27] you know, for some of the uh, you know,
[1:20:29] diagrams and so forth and I've been
[1:20:31] sending them out and you're free to, you
[1:20:33] know, contact me anytime. So, uh, let's
[1:20:36] move on. Now listen here, brother
[1:20:38] Brandham speaking here in 1965
[1:20:41] in Christ is revealed in his own word.
[1:20:44] Next slide he says, "And they're going
[1:20:46] to find out someday that they're not
[1:20:49] seeing 150 million years of light space
[1:20:52] either. They're going right around in a
[1:20:56] circle."
[1:20:57] That's exactly.
[1:21:00] You're going to find out one of these
[1:21:01] days that when you go to heaven, you
[1:21:05] don't fly off somewhere else. You're
[1:21:07] still right here.
[1:21:11] Imagine
[1:21:12] because distance is only something that
[1:21:15] that we as human beings in this
[1:21:18] dimension of light, matter, time,
[1:21:22] we have an understanding of distance
[1:21:26] and time and space.
[1:21:30] But it's right here. He says, "You're
[1:21:32] still right here, too, just in another
[1:21:36] dimension faster than this."
[1:21:39] That's what heaven actually is.
[1:21:42] Right through this room is coming color.
[1:21:45] Every color, shirt, dress, every what
[1:21:49] whatever
[1:21:51] whatever you got on is eternal laying
[1:21:54] right on records going around and around
[1:21:59] the world. Every time you bat your eyes,
[1:22:03] it's right on record. Watch television
[1:22:06] will prove that. So in other words,
[1:22:10] everything
[1:22:12] is actually
[1:22:14] existing simultaneously
[1:22:17] at the same time. Amen.
[1:22:20] But because we operate in light, time
[1:22:23] and matter as human beings, we associate
[1:22:27] with this dimension
[1:22:29] and we need to awaken to the
[1:22:32] understanding of the influences that are
[1:22:35] happening around us to control us in our
[1:22:39] existence as sons and daughters of God.
[1:22:43] And so we want to look now at each of
[1:22:46] these aspects.
[1:22:50] And we want to see here that the first
[1:22:54] one
[1:22:56] is
[1:22:59] the next slide. Light.
[1:23:03] Now light is the first dimension. We
[1:23:05] operate in light, matter and time. Okay?
[1:23:09] Without light you don't have matter.
[1:23:11] Without matter, you don't have light.
[1:23:14] It's all interconnected.
[1:23:17] Amen. It's actual substance. Even light
[1:23:19] itself is a substance. The first
[1:23:21] dimension is light. Without light, there
[1:23:23] would be no living thing on earth. When
[1:23:27] God said, "Let there be light." And the
[1:23:30] world was without form and void. That
[1:23:32] light brought everything into into
[1:23:35] existence.
[1:23:37] It immediately produced
[1:23:41] vegetation because without light there
[1:23:43] could be no vegetation. Without light
[1:23:46] there could be no um uh distance. We
[1:23:50] could not understand it because light is
[1:23:53] everything. And without light coming
[1:23:56] from the sun, the earth and everything
[1:23:58] on it would freeze and will cease to
[1:24:01] exist.
[1:24:02] God said in the beginning, "Let there be
[1:24:05] light and there was light and God
[1:24:08] himself is light." First John
[1:24:11] 1:5 states that this then is the message
[1:24:14] which we have heard of him and declare
[1:24:16] unto you that God is light and in him is
[1:24:21] no darkness at all.
[1:24:25] God is the is the is the opening of the
[1:24:28] word via his you know how people say
[1:24:31] I've seen the light
[1:24:34] well God's light opens understanding
[1:24:37] God's light brings revelation
[1:24:40] without God's light for you as a son or
[1:24:43] daughter of God you don't even
[1:24:45] understand revelation you don't even
[1:24:47] understand the the the the the concept
[1:24:51] of revelation you're you as a human
[1:24:53] being all you understand is knowledge
[1:24:57] teaching
[1:24:59] I got to read about it to understand it
[1:25:03] God God's way of giving understanding is
[1:25:06] by revelation and his revelation is
[1:25:09] light because he is light
[1:25:13] without light nothing can can work
[1:25:16] everything becomes total chaos amen and
[1:25:20] that's that's you know that's what um
[1:25:23] Colossians was all about that in the
[1:25:26] beginning was God and in the beginning
[1:25:27] God said let there be light and that is
[1:25:30] what exposed everything that was on the
[1:25:34] earth that was in total chaos which
[1:25:36] which we know that there was other
[1:25:38] worlds before this one. We know that
[1:25:43] there was utter chaos. We know that
[1:25:45] even, you know, we we've heard how
[1:25:47] brother Brandham talked about how Satan
[1:25:49] walked upon the earth before the fall,
[1:25:54] all of the things that that were taking
[1:25:55] place. We're not interested in all of
[1:25:57] that. They want to talk about dinosaurs
[1:25:59] millions of years ago and all of those
[1:26:01] things. We know that all of that chaos
[1:26:04] and there must have been some sort of a
[1:26:06] a destruction or or an annihilation
[1:26:10] prior to this
[1:26:12] dimension of earth in God creating it
[1:26:15] for his purpose and for his glory
[1:26:18] because he wanted now to express what he
[1:26:21] had in the back part of his mind from
[1:26:23] the very beginning which was to be
[1:26:28] with his children to be and have
[1:26:30] fellowship. ship with himself.
[1:26:32] Amen.
[1:26:33] Expressing himself.
[1:26:35] And so when he said, "Let there be
[1:26:37] light," everything changed right from
[1:26:39] that moment. There was a new earth and
[1:26:43] and everything started to live. And then
[1:26:46] it just started to go from there. And
[1:26:48] without light, we don't understand
[1:26:51] anything.
[1:26:53] There'd be nothing. Light is an actual
[1:26:55] substance.
[1:26:56] It's actual particles. It moves in
[1:26:59] certain ways. When light when light
[1:27:02] moves through, you know, through glass,
[1:27:04] it does certain things. It can change
[1:27:06] its, you know, you know, when it moves
[1:27:07] through a diamond, it changes into
[1:27:09] different aspects. When it moves, you
[1:27:11] know, when it comes into a dark room, it
[1:27:14] exposes everything.
[1:27:16] Well, it's all because it's God.
[1:27:18] Amen.
[1:27:18] He is light. Amen. Praise God. And so,
[1:27:23] let's go to the second one now. Matter.
[1:27:27] The second dimension is matter. And
[1:27:30] matter is anything that has mass and
[1:27:32] occupies space. Everything that we see
[1:27:35] around us from botney life to animal
[1:27:38] life from from land formations to water
[1:27:42] forms these are known as matter. Man is
[1:27:45] made out of 16 elements of matter.
[1:27:49] We're all made up of matter. We we
[1:27:52] consist of 16 different molecules of uh
[1:27:56] you know different um uh you know
[1:27:59] there's there's chromium and there's
[1:28:01] copper and there's iodine and iron and
[1:28:03] magnesium and you know all these
[1:28:05] different pod ash and zinc and and
[1:28:08] fluoride and oxygen and hydrogen and
[1:28:10] sulfur you know and and if you lack any
[1:28:13] one of these elements you will have a
[1:28:15] system imbalance
[1:28:17] because God created matter to be perfect
[1:28:20] because it was created for him and for
[1:28:24] his purpose
[1:28:26] for this dimension.
[1:28:28] And so we need to understand how these
[1:28:32] other dimensions affect the matter in
[1:28:35] our bodies
[1:28:37] and that we've been given authority over
[1:28:41] light, matter, and now even time
[1:28:45] because we are we are we are not no
[1:28:48] longer in an actual church age. We are
[1:28:50] we are in a bride age. We've entered
[1:28:52] into a time uh where their time shall be
[1:28:55] no more age.
[1:28:57] This is where we're moving. We're headed
[1:28:58] in that direction so that we can better
[1:29:01] understand. But but without these
[1:29:02] foundations in place, we we we we get
[1:29:06] caught up in in the carnality of life.
[1:29:08] And all of a sudden the the things that
[1:29:10] matter
[1:29:12] in our lives override the things that
[1:29:16] that that you know that that really
[1:29:18] matter in the economy of God. And we get
[1:29:20] caught up too much with the carnal
[1:29:22] things. And we look at how we're being
[1:29:25] affected in our environment, in our
[1:29:28] flesh, whether it be sickness, whether
[1:29:30] it be uh you know uh lack of of things
[1:29:33] that we have need of, you know,
[1:29:36] relationships, all those things. Those
[1:29:38] are all things that pertain to light,
[1:29:41] matter, and time.
[1:29:43] Even your relationships with with
[1:29:45] individuals. But you need to understand
[1:29:48] that you're being influenced by other
[1:29:50] dimensions.
[1:29:52] And this is what you want to expound
[1:29:54] your understanding on. And this is what
[1:29:55] we're looking at as we move through
[1:29:57] this. And so in order for a man to
[1:30:00] contact his environment, God gave you
[1:30:03] five senses in order to contact matter,
[1:30:07] time, space,
[1:30:10] and now even the fourth dimension.
[1:30:13] The fourth dimension.
[1:30:16] Let's look at le let's go let's let me
[1:30:18] stick with my notes because then I get
[1:30:21] you know off
[1:30:25] but let's look here.
[1:30:27] So so here now um in order for man to
[1:30:30] contact his inver God gave us five
[1:30:32] senses here taste smell feel and see in
[1:30:35] order for him to be able to contact the
[1:30:37] surrounding material world in which we
[1:30:40] live. Faith is the sixth sense that God
[1:30:44] gave us. That's the realm of revelation.
[1:30:47] That was the thing that we were talking
[1:30:48] about in in God's light. God's light is
[1:30:52] by revelation.
[1:30:54] Worldly light is by knowledge. They put
[1:30:58] lights on their books so that they can
[1:31:00] read things so that they can gain wisdom
[1:31:03] and understanding. God fills you with
[1:31:05] the Holy Ghost so that when you read the
[1:31:07] word, it filters through the spirit
[1:31:10] and it gives you revelation and
[1:31:12] understanding on what you're reading.
[1:31:15] You're reading what's unwritten in the
[1:31:17] word of God.
[1:31:19] That's what you you have. So that faith
[1:31:21] is the evidence of things that we do not
[1:31:24] see,
[1:31:25] we do not hear, we do not smell or taste
[1:31:31] because it's far more different from
[1:31:34] from fact, you know, facts and truth.
[1:31:40] The world has all kinds of worldly
[1:31:42] wisdom based on facts that they know.
[1:31:45] But we we we're not we're not looking at
[1:31:48] facts of, you know, people. Well, yeah,
[1:31:50] but our our our
[1:31:52] church teaches this because our leader
[1:31:56] was John Wesley and it's a fact that he
[1:32:00] said all of these things and these are
[1:32:02] facts that we go by.
[1:32:05] But God doesn't operate by facts.
[1:32:08] God operates by faith.
[1:32:10] Amen.
[1:32:11] And faith is a revelation of the truth.
[1:32:14] And that's why when you talk to somebody
[1:32:16] about truth and you say, "Yeah, but wait
[1:32:18] a minute. There's there's nobody in the
[1:32:20] Bible that was ever baptized into the
[1:32:23] titles of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
[1:32:26] I can show you in the scripture."
[1:32:30] And they will look at that and they will
[1:32:32] they they will not see the the
[1:32:35] revelation of the godhead.
[1:32:38] They will not see that that his name was
[1:32:41] Jesus.
[1:32:43] When they say in the name of the Father
[1:32:45] and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost,
[1:32:47] they're they're looking everything based
[1:32:49] on logic
[1:32:52] and not recognizing the revelation and
[1:32:55] the truth that's in the word of God that
[1:32:58] can only be unveiled by the Holy Ghost.
[1:33:02] Amen.
[1:33:02] That's why he told Nicodemus, "You must
[1:33:04] be born again, Nicodemus.
[1:33:07] You must receive the new birth." And
[1:33:09] people say, "I've been born again. I go
[1:33:10] to a Christian church." No, you have not
[1:33:13] been born again unless you've received
[1:33:16] Christ in your day.
[1:33:19] That's the evidence of the Holy Ghost.
[1:33:22] It's Jesus Christ in the present stage
[1:33:25] of his ministry.
[1:33:27] And you are that word that's receiving
[1:33:30] it right now,
[1:33:32] bringing it to life. And so the truth
[1:33:35] is, if you are born of the spirit of
[1:33:37] God, you shall no longer die.
[1:33:40] That's according to Jesus himself. He
[1:33:43] says, "He that believeth on me, though
[1:33:45] he were dead, because you know that this
[1:33:48] thing's going to die.
[1:33:50] It's dying right now from the moment
[1:33:51] that you were born, it's been dying."
[1:33:54] Amen. And though you were dead, yet
[1:33:57] shall you live because whosoever liveth
[1:34:00] and believeth in me shall never die. In
[1:34:02] other words, he's imparting himself
[1:34:06] eternal life
[1:34:09] unto you and to your matter.
[1:34:12] Amen.
[1:34:13] Into your time, into your space. Amen.
[1:34:18] Praise God. Let's go to the next slide.
[1:34:23] The third dimension is time.
[1:34:27] And time began and was issued in the
[1:34:29] economy of mankind when man fell from
[1:34:32] grace.
[1:34:34] There was no time. When God created
[1:34:36] Adam, God expressed himself from the
[1:34:40] seventh dimension
[1:34:42] into a matter body on the earth. Okay?
[1:34:48] But remember
[1:34:50] when matter was created
[1:34:53] and God expressed a body for himself,
[1:34:57] it was it actually it was in in Genesis
[1:35:00] 3 when he actually created the ma the
[1:35:02] matter body. Before that it was the
[1:35:04] theophony body. It was God himself
[1:35:08] expressing himself in the image of
[1:35:10] himself into a theophony body. That was
[1:35:14] the first Adam. And then when he took
[1:35:16] from the earth
[1:35:18] He took from the matter.
[1:35:21] Then he created him a matter body.
[1:35:25] But that even that matter body that he
[1:35:27] created for Adam at that time, it was it
[1:35:32] had no time in it. It it actually didn't
[1:35:34] decompose.
[1:35:36] That body was it was actually when when
[1:35:39] God created Adam in in Genesis chapter 3
[1:35:42] and called their name uh male and female
[1:35:44] and called their name Adam. He took of
[1:35:47] himself an attribute of himself and he
[1:35:50] himself within his own attribute is male
[1:35:52] and female. And all he did was he
[1:35:55] created a a a a flesh body for Adam from
[1:36:00] the earth from the matter of the earth.
[1:36:03] But there was no time yet.
[1:36:06] That body was a 21-year-old body just
[1:36:08] like you know God can create a body
[1:36:10] that's 21 years old 40 years old
[1:36:13] whatever year old when he came in the
[1:36:15] order of Melzdc and you know and he came
[1:36:17] to Abraham he was in a he was in a body
[1:36:19] that he created for himself and and he
[1:36:22] was the king of Salem without father
[1:36:24] without mother he was you know under the
[1:36:26] order of Melzdc well who was it was
[1:36:29] Christ it was God himself
[1:36:31] he can create himself a body anytime he
[1:36:33] wants so when he created Adam's body. It
[1:36:36] was a matter body, but it had not fallen
[1:36:39] yet.
[1:36:40] Amen.
[1:36:42] It was eternal.
[1:36:45] Amen.
[1:36:47] God can do that.
[1:36:49] He's going to do it again.
[1:36:52] Oh, glory to God.
[1:36:54] This is where we're headed, saints.
[1:36:56] Remember, we got another thousand years
[1:36:58] in this dimension of Earth.
[1:37:03] Oh, boy. This is something else. I love
[1:37:06] it. I love this word. I love his word.
[1:37:10] It's glorious. It just keeps unveiling
[1:37:13] and and and just, you know, getting
[1:37:15] sweeter and sweeter. But here now, but
[1:37:18] due to the fall, so so watch. Adam was
[1:37:21] supposed to be eternal.
[1:37:24] Amen.
[1:37:26] He was a perfect man created in the
[1:37:28] image of God, not prone to death nor
[1:37:30] sickness, but due to the fall
[1:37:34] When Eve disbelieved
[1:37:37] the word and believed the serpent,
[1:37:41] when he said, "You shall not surely
[1:37:44] die." Because God said, "The day you eat
[1:37:46] of that tree of knowledge," which was
[1:37:49] the knowledge of good and evil, which
[1:37:50] was the serpent, which was Satan
[1:37:52] himself, the devil that was in the
[1:37:53] garden, an upright man that could talk.
[1:37:56] How many people know serpents that can
[1:37:58] talk?
[1:37:59] Oh, yeah.
[1:37:59] Anybody?
[1:38:02] I know there's a lot of people that talk
[1:38:05] and the serpent is definitely speaking
[1:38:07] through them, but you don't see a
[1:38:08] serpent.
[1:38:10] Well, that's exactly what he was. He was
[1:38:12] a person, an upright person that was
[1:38:14] talking to Eve and got her to disbelieve
[1:38:17] the word of God. And when that took
[1:38:19] place, time started right there and
[1:38:23] then. And it was created as an existence
[1:38:26] right then.
[1:38:27] Before that, there was no time. Amen.
[1:38:30] There was no need of it.
[1:38:32] And the moment time comes, death comes.
[1:38:35] And that's why time, he says, but due to
[1:38:37] the fall when Eve was deceived by the
[1:38:39] serpent into eating and partaking with
[1:38:42] the forbidden fruit and dragged her
[1:38:45] husband Adam into it, death entered into
[1:38:49] human life. But of the fruit of the tree
[1:38:53] in the midst of the garden, thou shalt
[1:38:56] not eat. For the moment that thou eatest
[1:38:59] thereof, that day you will die.
[1:39:02] And that's why Adam never lived beyond a
[1:39:05] thousand years because a day is as a
[1:39:07] thousand years in the Lord. I believe he
[1:39:10] lived to 960 or so.
[1:39:14] Man began to age and to weaken after the
[1:39:18] fall. Man that is born of a woman is of
[1:39:21] a few days and full of trouble.
[1:39:24] That's why you need to be born again
[1:39:28] because born into this flesh, you're
[1:39:30] going to fight constantly against it.
[1:39:33] It'll be a battle over man that is born
[1:39:36] of a woman is of a few days and full of
[1:39:39] trouble. And that's according to Job
[1:39:41] 14:1. But time will cease one day after
[1:39:46] everything has been restored by God back
[1:39:49] to its original condition.
[1:39:52] That's where we're headed. That's the
[1:39:54] dispensation that we're headed for at
[1:39:58] full speed.
[1:40:00] The speed of light
[1:40:03] by the light and the speed of God's
[1:40:05] supernatural word. Amen. Praise God. And
[1:40:09] so this third dimension,
[1:40:12] time began.
[1:40:15] Amen. Now the only way back is by
[1:40:18] receiving eternal life. Time was
[1:40:21] introduced for the first time at the
[1:40:24] time of the original sin. And now the
[1:40:27] only way back is by receiving
[1:40:30] eternal life, which is the Holy Ghost
[1:40:33] for your day.
[1:40:35] I cannot overemphasize that. People say,
[1:40:37] "Oh, I was baptized 25 years ago." And I
[1:40:42] and that's so I'll ask I go, "Oh, that's
[1:40:43] that's wonderful, brother. How are you
[1:40:45] baptized?" He says, "In the water." I
[1:40:48] said, 'You remember, were you baptized,
[1:40:50] you know, in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:40:52] Christ? Not that that saves you. Don't
[1:40:54] get me wrong,
[1:40:56] but the scripture says that baptism is
[1:40:59] an outward expression of something
[1:41:01] that's been revealed on the inside.
[1:41:04] Amen.
[1:41:04] And it's it has to be revealed to you to
[1:41:07] be baptized according to the word
[1:41:10] because the word cannot change.
[1:41:12] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:41:14] forever. I can show you in the New
[1:41:15] Testament over 8,000 baptisms and every
[1:41:18] one of them was done in the name of the
[1:41:20] Lord Jesus Christ. Not one in the titles
[1:41:23] of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.
[1:41:26] Because the word doesn't lie. And if the
[1:41:30] Holy Ghost comes into you, you're going
[1:41:33] to know how you were baptized. You're
[1:41:35] going to know that you were buried in
[1:41:37] the water, that your old life was buried
[1:41:40] because the the the water is a
[1:41:41] representation of a burial, that you're
[1:41:44] being buried to your old life, and
[1:41:46] you're rising up to a brand new life.
[1:41:48] You're going to know that you were
[1:41:49] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:41:52] where the scripture says that there is
[1:41:54] no other name whereby man must be saved.
[1:41:58] No other name. Oh, I got baptized in the
[1:42:00] titles of father, son, and holy ghost.
[1:42:03] You haven't been baptized.
[1:42:05] I got baptized as a baby. You doubly
[1:42:08] have not been baptized.
[1:42:11] You got sprinkled with water. You've got
[1:42:14] no revelation. Jesus says, "He that
[1:42:15] believeth and is baptized shall be
[1:42:18] saved."
[1:42:20] You see, that's the only way back. And
[1:42:23] without the simplicity and the teaching,
[1:42:25] like you know, I know you've heard it a
[1:42:26] hundred times, baptism and this and
[1:42:28] that, but he doesn't change.
[1:42:31] Repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:42:33] the Lord Jesus Christ. Acts 2:38. You
[1:42:36] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:42:38] Ghost. He's not going to change for
[1:42:40] anybody. And when that takes place, all
[1:42:43] of a sudden, everything opens up.
[1:42:46] Revelation on dimensions open up.
[1:42:48] Revelation of your purpose for your
[1:42:50] existence opens up. Your understanding
[1:42:52] of why you've received this message in
[1:42:55] this last day opens up. You start to
[1:42:57] recognize that the seven seals has a
[1:43:00] significance in this revelation of this
[1:43:03] hour and how you need to be feeding on
[1:43:05] the word of God and understand the
[1:43:07] opening of those seven seals and why
[1:43:10] it's so important because within it lies
[1:43:13] rapturing faith.
[1:43:15] Within it lies the change of your mortal
[1:43:18] body.
[1:43:19] Without it, you are just a
[1:43:20] denominational Christian. You're just
[1:43:23] you're you're you're you're
[1:43:25] plain church. I I don't know how else to
[1:43:29] describe it. I I see people every day. I
[1:43:32] talk to people every day. They claim to
[1:43:34] be Christians, but then if I try to get
[1:43:36] a little deep, a little bit, you know,
[1:43:38] just a little bit, you know, just little
[1:43:40] simple discussions on the word of God
[1:43:42] about receiving the Holy Ghost. You
[1:43:45] know, Jesus said, "He that believeth and
[1:43:47] is baptized shall be saved." And you
[1:43:49] know, and you just get into little
[1:43:51] simple things right away. They just, you
[1:43:53] know, they just
[1:43:55] they don't want to know. They don't Why?
[1:43:57] Because they don't really take their
[1:43:59] their salvation serious.
[1:44:02] They think they do, but because they go
[1:44:04] to church on Sunday. They feel justified
[1:44:07] because they go to church, because they
[1:44:09] give to the church, because No, God God
[1:44:12] doesn't need people's money. God doesn't
[1:44:14] need your time to show up in church and
[1:44:18] live a hypocritical life and go back out
[1:44:21] there taking the name of the Lord in
[1:44:22] vain every time you talk to your
[1:44:24] friends.
[1:44:26] Come on. Either we're going to talk the
[1:44:29] reality and the truth or we're going to
[1:44:31] play church. And there's no playing
[1:44:32] church here.
[1:44:34] We want to know what we need to know in
[1:44:36] this hour because this world is falling
[1:44:38] apart and fast.
[1:44:40] Amen. Praise God. And so this is where
[1:44:43] we're going to uh we're going with this.
[1:44:45] But first, we need to understand the
[1:44:48] importance
[1:44:50] of receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:44:53] and being born again. Amen. Praise God.
[1:44:57] Let's look at the fourth dimension.
[1:44:58] We're going to close on this and then
[1:45:01] we'll pick it up again next week because
[1:45:03] this is going to go for I think a a
[1:45:06] couple of more weeks at least.
[1:45:09] But understanding your existence while
[1:45:11] being influenced by these seven
[1:45:13] dimensions and in particular this fourth
[1:45:16] dimension which is science.
[1:45:19] This fourth dimension runs through
[1:45:23] our three dimensions,
[1:45:26] the fifth dimension
[1:45:29] all the way through because it's the
[1:45:32] channel of communication
[1:45:34] through ether. It's science. The fourth
[1:45:37] dimension is science. It was created and
[1:45:42] God created it as an avenue and man
[1:45:45] tapped into it back in the early 1900s
[1:45:48] when they started to tap into, you know,
[1:45:50] radio waves and sound waves. Without the
[1:45:53] fourth dimension, you you wouldn't even
[1:45:55] be able to hear my voice because my
[1:45:58] voice is traveling through the ether and
[1:46:01] there's sound waves that are going
[1:46:02] directly to your ears to receive, you
[1:46:07] know, the drum. You've got eard drums.
[1:46:08] That's why a person that's deaf, all
[1:46:11] they're seeing is my lips moving. They
[1:46:14] cannot hear because their physical
[1:46:18] ability to receive sound and waves has
[1:46:22] been cut off.
[1:46:26] And so we need to understand
[1:46:28] how this dimension works and why it's so
[1:46:32] important to understand it because
[1:46:33] through it is where we get all the
[1:46:35] negative influences and the positive
[1:46:38] influences.
[1:46:40] It involves the things that are unseen
[1:46:43] to the natural eye, but yet they exist
[1:46:45] based on natural laws, yet are not quite
[1:46:49] plain to a common man's understanding.
[1:46:51] Electricity, for example, cannot be
[1:46:53] seen. But when one gets to know the law
[1:46:56] of electricity and apply these laws
[1:46:58] today, he could run a whole city's
[1:47:00] machineries, lighting systems,
[1:47:03] communication systems, and
[1:47:05] transportation systems.
[1:47:07] This is the fourth dimension. And even
[1:47:11] Thomas Edison discovered the principle
[1:47:13] of light and came up with the light
[1:47:15] bulb. He unveiled some of the hidden
[1:47:17] mysteries of the fourth dimension. And
[1:47:20] Albert Einstein learned how to split the
[1:47:23] atom and introduced the theory of
[1:47:25] relativity. All breaking into this
[1:47:27] fourth dimension.
[1:47:29] But it's a dimension that we need to
[1:47:32] understand and and more in particular
[1:47:35] why we need to understand it. Amen.
[1:47:38] Television it's a byproduct. It's a
[1:47:40] product of science. For example, it can
[1:47:42] pick up sights and sounds. That's why
[1:47:44] these dimensions you can understand them
[1:47:47] from just from the the theory and the
[1:47:50] and the uh um the you know the
[1:47:53] understanding of this fourth dimension
[1:47:56] because there's there's pictures there's
[1:47:59] live scenes right now that are operating
[1:48:02] right here in this room of people that
[1:48:05] are alive doing things but on television
[1:48:10] on the other side of the world. And if
[1:48:11] we had a TV right here, it would pick up
[1:48:13] that frequency and that person would be
[1:48:16] alive right here and we'd be watching.
[1:48:19] We we all understand that. The purpose
[1:48:21] I'm telling you that is so that you
[1:48:23] understand how dimensions work because
[1:48:27] the dimension of the redeemed, it's
[1:48:29] right here.
[1:48:31] They without us cannot be made perfect.
[1:48:34] They're waiting on us to perfect our
[1:48:37] revelation of dimensions so that we can
[1:48:40] understand that when the Holy Gh what
[1:48:42] the purpose of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:48:44] coming of the mighty angel was so that
[1:48:48] we can so that we can connect with our
[1:48:51] theophanes
[1:48:52] so that we can we can be changed in a
[1:48:54] moment in the twinkling of an eye. We
[1:48:56] need to understand that that dimension
[1:48:58] is right here right now. But it's all
[1:49:01] going to come together when that when
[1:49:03] the fullness of the dispensation of time
[1:49:06] is complete. The Bible talks about it in
[1:49:08] in the book of Ephesians.
[1:49:12] And so we need to understand this simple
[1:49:16] knowledge. Today's technologies such as
[1:49:18] the invention of cars, bullet trains,
[1:49:21] submarines, airplanes, rockets,
[1:49:23] spaceships, the internet was only made
[1:49:25] possible for use during the the last
[1:49:28] 20th century.
[1:49:30] And in the fulfillment of Bible
[1:49:32] prophecy, it surely was prophesied that
[1:49:34] in the last days, knowledge shall
[1:49:36] increase. And now knowledge can move at
[1:49:39] the speed of light. Amen. And so science
[1:49:45] came as a result of man's partaking of
[1:49:47] the fruit of the tree of knowledge
[1:49:51] of good and evil. It's not perfect. It's
[1:49:56] not the perfect will of God, but it's
[1:49:59] the permissive will of God because of
[1:50:01] the fall. Let the musicians come.
[1:50:05] I can see here that there's a lot more
[1:50:09] to this dimension,
[1:50:14] but we need to understand the influence
[1:50:17] of it.
[1:50:19] We need to realize that it's where our
[1:50:22] young people are being constantly
[1:50:25] compromised
[1:50:27] because of the flow of information at
[1:50:31] the speed of light.
[1:50:34] Young people are being captivated and
[1:50:37] sucked into pornography
[1:50:40] because you can literally you go to a
[1:50:43] website. It happened to me. I was just
[1:50:46] doing research on on on my business and
[1:50:50] all of a sudden a website comes up which
[1:50:52] was a pornographic website instantly
[1:50:55] just like that it just come out of
[1:50:57] nowhere and it's the kind of things that
[1:51:00] you you know that's how Satan is working
[1:51:03] now in using these technologies but we
[1:51:07] need to be aware of the influence that
[1:51:09] they can have on us and we need to to be
[1:51:13] willing to to put a barrier and say no
[1:51:18] absolutely not. We need to be able to be
[1:51:20] consciously aware that we are not going
[1:51:23] to spend time all day on social media
[1:51:27] and and and listening into all these
[1:51:30] podcasts and all these different uh you
[1:51:33] know people's teachings on the universe
[1:51:35] and everything else. We need to get more
[1:51:38] into the word of God.
[1:51:39] Amen.
[1:51:40] Amen. The enemy is using this fourth
[1:51:43] dimension to absolutely pollute our
[1:51:46] minds and distract us from the word of
[1:51:49] God. Satan is using it to distract you
[1:51:52] from your purpose, who you really are,
[1:51:55] and what you're to actually fulfill in
[1:51:57] this day and in this hour. And he's
[1:52:00] using the internet. Listen, we use the
[1:52:02] internet the right way. We need to be
[1:52:06] disciplined because God has given us
[1:52:09] faith to know good and evil.
[1:52:14] That's the beauty of being born again.
[1:52:17] It gives you an authority over these
[1:52:20] dimensions.
[1:52:22] It gives you an authority to reject the
[1:52:24] enemy
[1:52:26] to say, "No, that is not going to come
[1:52:28] into my home. No, I'm not going to allow
[1:52:31] that spirit to come in through these,
[1:52:34] you know, such, you know, like listen,
[1:52:37] all of our politicians,
[1:52:40] all of our uh, you know, uh, great uh,
[1:52:43] leaders of the world, they're they're
[1:52:45] anointed by this fourth dimension.
[1:52:48] And they're and they're especially
[1:52:50] anointed by the fifth dimension, which
[1:52:52] is the the region of the lost and all
[1:52:55] those spirits that operate. And what do
[1:52:57] they do? They get anointed from the
[1:52:59] fifth dimension as a politician to to
[1:53:03] have influence and they use the fourth
[1:53:06] dimension to send forth all of their
[1:53:08] their their their lies because it's the
[1:53:12] dimension of lies. The fifth dimension,
[1:53:14] it's the dimension of lies because it's
[1:53:16] the it's the dimension of the lost. Do
[1:53:20] you know what devil the word devil
[1:53:22] means? It means liar. That's what devil
[1:53:25] means. That's why when Jesus was on the
[1:53:27] earth and he was doing the things and
[1:53:29] and and doing the miracles that he was
[1:53:32] doing, they they called him Beelzebub.
[1:53:36] They were calling him a devil. In other
[1:53:38] words, their understanding of devil was
[1:53:40] that you he was a liar. They were
[1:53:43] calling him a liar saying that he was
[1:53:45] that he was God. That if you see me,
[1:53:48] Philillip, you've seen the father.
[1:53:50] It's not I that doeth the works, but the
[1:53:53] father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the
[1:53:55] works. And and to the to the Pharisees
[1:53:58] and the Sadducees, that was God. That's
[1:54:00] Messiah. How could he be saying that? I
[1:54:04] that am he. I am he that speak to thee.
[1:54:06] They said, "What? How could he claim
[1:54:09] this?"
[1:54:11] You see, Satan is the father of lies.
[1:54:16] And he uses his angels and the fourth
[1:54:20] dimension to spread his lies into the
[1:54:24] ears of our young people and into even
[1:54:28] us.
[1:54:30] We need to understand the power of the
[1:54:33] fourth dimension and we need to use it
[1:54:37] for the glory of God. Amen. Amen. Praise
[1:54:41] God. I'm going to stop there. Next week,
[1:54:44] we'll look into the fifth dimension and
[1:54:46] we'll move on and and when we get into
[1:54:48] the sixth and the seventh, there's
[1:54:50] that's where things really start to get
[1:54:52] glorious. Amen. I love that because it's
[1:54:56] it's it's we we are we are we are
[1:54:58] transitioning. God had a plan from the
[1:55:02] very beginning and the plan as it
[1:55:05] evolved, it produced dimensions.
[1:55:09] Just like I said, there wasn't a third
[1:55:11] dimension until there was a need for a
[1:55:13] third dimension. And there wasn't a
[1:55:15] fourth dimension until there was a need
[1:55:17] for the fourth dimension here in this
[1:55:19] earth. There wasn't a fifth dimension
[1:55:21] until there were fallen angels that a
[1:55:24] fifth dimension and a place where they
[1:55:26] could exist was required. Amen. There
[1:55:29] wasn't a sixth dimension until Jesus
[1:55:31] Christ came and came the first time and
[1:55:34] went down. Okay, I'm not gonna I'm gonna
[1:55:36] stop there because that's what leads
[1:55:38] into where we're going. Amen. Praise
[1:55:40] God. So, let's just let's all stand.
[1:55:44] But this is this is glorious, saints.
[1:55:47] This is who we are. This is the message
[1:55:50] of the hour. This is what we're feasting
[1:55:52] on. Amen. This is why we're we're we're
[1:55:55] excited about the word of God. It's not
[1:55:58] because we're teaching things from
[1:56:00] knowledge. It's because we're we're
[1:56:02] feeling the inspiration of the Lord
[1:56:04] directing us, guiding us, moving us
[1:56:07] personally into our personal uh um uh uh
[1:56:11] personal ministries. We all have a
[1:56:13] ministry in the body of Christ and we
[1:56:16] need to recognize that. Amen. Praise
