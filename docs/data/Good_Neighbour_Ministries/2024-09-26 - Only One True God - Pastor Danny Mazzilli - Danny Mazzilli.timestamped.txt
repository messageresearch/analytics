[15:51] advantage of that um when I Minister on
[15:53] the Wednesday nights I'm going to be um
[15:57] hitting on topics that are like
[15:59] uh you know the things that are
[16:01] controversial with respect to the word
[16:03] of God and and how important it is to
[16:06] have that uh that proper foundation on
[16:09] the word of God in order to establish
[16:12] anything at all you know with a
[16:15] relationship with God you need to know
[16:17] who God is amen and we're living in a
[16:21] world where there's too many too many
[16:22] different
[16:27] gods and so tonight
[16:29] T tonight we're going to be looking at
[16:32] um only one true
[16:34] God and we're going to just be um you
[16:37] know taking our time um we're going to
[16:39] look at uh you know how it is that God
[16:43] is one and that there is only one God
[16:48] and uh you know for the world to to
[16:50] recognize true salvation they're going
[16:52] to need to know who their savior is amen
[16:55] amen praise God so let's get um let's
[16:59] get going with that we'll just have a
[17:00] word of prayer we want to remember um we
[17:03] got a prayer request here that came in
[17:05] this evening from Brother Zach lent uh
[17:09] that's sister
[17:10] zabina um her husband um his father uh
[17:15] brother Doug has just been diagnosed
[17:18] with some sort of a esophagus cancer and
[17:22] so we want to take that before the Lord
[17:24] tonight and trust that the Lord will
[17:26] move he's more than able to to um touch
[17:30] and restore our brother and meet his
[17:32] needs amen let us pray father what a
[17:36] privilege and what an honor it is to
[17:39] assemble ourselves once again under your
[17:43] anointing the word of God lord to be
[17:48] drawn together in this way father where
[17:50] we can study the word where we can allow
[17:53] your spirit and your anointing to uh add
[17:57] and Inspire and bring bring Faith and
[17:59] Revelation upon the word of God for
[18:02] Faith cometh by hearing and by hearing
[18:05] the word of God and Lord you chose the
[18:08] foolishness of
[18:10] preaching Lord in order for us to be
[18:14] saved and to be transformed and to be
[18:18] healed and to be set free father that's
[18:21] what the preaching of the word does Lord
[18:23] it liberates the captives and tonight
[18:26] Lord as we come to you Lord we want to
[18:29] bring this request for brother Doug lent
[18:32] Lord that Lord that uh the doctor's
[18:34] report has given a cancer report but
[18:38] father we know the true report and that
[18:40] is you are the Lord God that Health all
[18:43] of our disease and so we bring our
[18:47] brother before you tonight in the name
[18:48] of Jesus Christ and Lord may your spirit
[18:52] move where there is no distance in
[18:54] prayer may you move into that situation
[18:57] wherever he is even right now Lord May
[19:01] Faith enter his heart and Lord may it
[19:04] change the circumstances From This
[19:06] Moment On and may He recognize that by
[19:09] your stripes we are healed granted
[19:13] father let your perfect will be
[19:16] established Lord we commit all things
[19:18] now into your hands sanctify this
[19:20] evening for your glory in Jesus name
[19:23] amen and amen praise God let's go to the
[19:27] scripture tonight our scriptures from 1
[19:30] Timothy uh
[19:32] 3:16 and this scripture is very clear
[19:35] it's without any
[19:37] controversy so there's no argument
[19:41] there's no discussion it's absolutely
[19:45] pure fact that great is the mystery of
[19:49] godliness God was
[19:51] manifest in
[19:54] flesh amen God bless you you may be
[19:57] seated you know
[19:59] that is the very
[20:01] Foundation of
[20:03] Christianity amen that if if we don't
[20:07] recognize that Jesus Christ is God and
[20:11] that he had to become flesh in order to
[20:15] be the blood sacrifice to make a way for
[20:18] us to be redeemed then there is no
[20:22] salvation outside of that the Plan of
[20:26] Redemption was based on on God himself
[20:30] coming down to the Earth taking on a
[20:34] vessel not a separate God not a son in
[20:40] the way that we as human beings
[20:42] understand Sons but God coming down to
[20:48] take the form of human flesh in order
[20:51] for him to be the human
[20:54] sacrifice and the perfect Sacrifice by
[20:58] the blood blood of God are we saved
[21:02] which is the Holy Ghost so that it could
[21:05] go and take our place so that we could
[21:09] be redeemed in human flesh amen remember
[21:14] God isn't redeeming this human flesh
[21:16] he's Redeeming the seed uh the attribute
[21:20] the portion of himself that he placed in
[21:24] each and every one of us back to himself
[21:28] amen if you come from God you're going
[21:32] back to God if you had a beginning on
[21:35] this Earth unfortunately you will have
[21:38] an end but if you are a son or a
[21:41] daughter of God then you had no
[21:45] beginning because you originated in the
[21:49] mind of God and was
[21:53] expressed into an earth into an earth
[21:57] vessel so that you could be redeemed
[22:00] back to God Amen praise God so we're
[22:04] going to be looking at um you know some
[22:06] some different um thoughts and and we're
[22:10] going to just expand on it through the
[22:12] word of God and it's going to you know I
[22:15] know a lot of it is very familiar to
[22:17] most of us but there are young people
[22:20] and there are those that are tuning in
[22:22] online and uh you know um it's great
[22:25] that we're you know uh preaching on all
[22:28] the the mysteries of God but let me tell
[22:30] you there's no mystery that's greater
[22:32] than this one because this mystery
[22:35] includes you this mystery is the one
[22:38] that that calls every son and every
[22:41] daughter of God into the mystical body
[22:43] of Jesus Christ so that they can say I'm
[22:47] saved this is the greatest mystery of
[22:49] all Mysteries amen that's why it said
[22:53] without controversy great is the mystery
[22:57] of God am amen praise God so let's go to
[23:00] the next
[23:06] slide
[23:07] so there's denominational beliefs and I
[23:11] and I want to say too that um you know
[23:14] this slide
[23:15] presentation um there's a brother in the
[23:17] Philippines brother milanova okay uh who
[23:21] who puts these slides together and
[23:24] allows the the the preaching Brethren
[23:27] all over the world to use these slides
[23:31] and to um you know use them for
[23:33] PowerPoint presentations for times such
[23:36] as this so we modify them I look at them
[23:38] I modify them I review them and I use
[23:41] them but I want to acknowledge Him for
[23:43] the great work he's done thousands of
[23:46] these you know types of uh presentations
[23:49] and they're excellent amen so God bless
[23:52] him he's a pastor of this message in the
[23:55] Philippines God richly bless him I
[23:57] acknowledge Him for his great work amen
[24:00] and so uh uh denominational belief
[24:03] number one which is the trinitarian
[24:06] doctrine which says that the Holy Spirit
[24:09] the father and the son are three
[24:12] persons well that alone is saying that
[24:17] there's three powers occupying three
[24:21] Thrones in heaven that there's three
[24:24] individuals and that very thought right
[24:27] there is a
[24:29] discrepancy you know keep you know hit
[24:32] the hit the next slide it'll just
[24:34] continue um the this discrepancy in the
[24:37] is a is a uh in the doctrine is that
[24:40] there's three persons three gods and we
[24:43] know that right there that breaks the
[24:45] very first commandment which says that
[24:48] thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and
[24:51] thou shalt not put any other gods before
[24:54] me that's what the Lord said so the
[24:57] minute that you believe in a trinity
[25:00] you're you're actually believing in more
[25:02] than one God I know they want to explain
[25:05] it you know like one person explained it
[25:06] to me one time you know it's like a
[25:09] loony there's four quarters in a loony
[25:12] but it's still just a loony right no
[25:15] there's one God and there's three
[25:20] offices God the
[25:22] Father God come and create himself a son
[25:27] a body a human vessel to dwell in amen
[25:32] and then God the power the Holy Spirit
[25:35] God himself his soul his Essence his
[25:40] emanating power but it's all the same
[25:45] self-existent one amen praise God go to
[25:49] the next slide in Revelations
[25:52] 4:2 it said and immediately I was in the
[25:55] spirit and behold a throne not Thrones a
[26:00] throne was set in heaven and what does
[26:04] it say there
[26:05] threat on the throne no it says one sat
[26:09] on the throne amen praise God and so the
[26:13] minute we start to you know believe in
[26:16] Trinity and we start to put our own
[26:18] interpretation on on how we interpret
[26:22] God if it doesn't line up with the word
[26:24] of God then there's something wrong
[26:28] therefore the foundation of your faith
[26:31] right there
[26:33] has something in there that's completely
[26:36] flaw and without a proper Foundation
[26:40] when any kind of wind blows in your life
[26:42] and you're claiming God and you're
[26:45] confused whether you're dealing with God
[26:46] in heaven God on Earth God the Holy
[26:50] Ghost you're you're you're confused in
[26:52] in your approach to God then how can you
[26:55] have a a true revelation of your savior
[26:59] of your helper of your provider when
[27:01] you're
[27:03] confused amen praise God belief number
[27:07] two Eternal Father and eternal
[27:11] son there can't be
[27:16] two next slide discrepancy is that a son
[27:20] is begotten the word sunship signifies a
[27:24] beginning so if God has a son that
[27:28] signifies that
[27:30] God brought forth another being but
[27:35] that's not the case like a father and a
[27:37] son here on Earth there's two there
[27:41] that's not the way God is being
[27:44] described when he said that he gave his
[27:46] only begotten son it was that it was
[27:52] him trans
[27:55] trans
[27:56] transformed from
[27:58] the self-existent one a portion of
[28:01] himself come down to the Earth in the
[28:04] form of God purely God Amen not two
[28:10] separate
[28:12] beings number three Jesus in flesh is
[28:17] all three Jesus the body father son Holy
[28:22] Spirit discrepancy is why you know
[28:25] people will say well why did Jesus talk
[28:27] to his father
[28:28] if he himself is the father like when
[28:32] Jesus was you know um in the in the
[28:37] water and he was being baptized and a
[28:40] voice spoke from Heaven this is my
[28:42] beloved Son in whom I am pleased to
[28:46] dwell in that was God communicating
[28:51] revealing to John that this was him come
[28:56] down the m Messiah because if you look
[29:00] back in the Old Testament we're going to
[29:01] be looking at a lot of background
[29:03] teaching right from the Old Testament it
[29:07] was
[29:07] Messiah it was the Lord God here ye oh
[29:11] Israel the Lord is one and that he'd be
[29:15] the mighty counselor the Prince of Peace
[29:19] the Everlasting father unto us a child
[29:23] is
[29:23] given it describes it in Isaiah exactly
[29:27] who he was
[29:28] he was describing the one and total and
[29:32] complete
[29:34] God the Father amen so the question is
[29:39] where do we
[29:41] stand which teaching do we
[29:44] believe how do we differ from all these
[29:47] denominational interpretations about the
[29:50] godhead is there a real true
[29:54] understanding of the
[29:56] godhead the the answer is
[29:59] yes and it is revealed purely by
[30:04] Revelation to the sons and the daughters
[30:07] of God Amen so let's look here now let's
[30:11] go to the next
[30:13] slide so before the foundations of the
[30:15] world there was Elohim which is the
[30:20] self-existent
[30:21] one God was
[30:24] self-existent he was all in all
[30:29] anything that ever had a
[30:31] beginning
[30:32] began from the self-existent one not two
[30:38] that's why there's no confusion once
[30:40] you've come into a revelation of who God
[30:43] is everything falls right into place in
[30:46] your
[30:49] salvation look at what it says here who
[30:51] only hath immortality dwelling in the
[30:55] light which no man can approach
[30:58] unto whom no man hath seen nor can
[31:03] see God only reveals himself when he
[31:08] wants to reveal
[31:09] himself no man can say oh this is the
[31:13] interpretation of God God interprets
[31:17] himself God interprets his own word into
[31:21] each and every individual that walks
[31:25] this Earth and if God is not
[31:29] interpreting himself to you personally
[31:32] then you have not found him
[31:35] yet amen praise
[31:38] God next
[31:40] slide Isaiah 43: 10 and 11 and we're
[31:44] talking about Elohim the self-existent
[31:47] one before me there was no God form
[31:52] remember even the word
[31:55] god means object of worship
[32:00] that's why people worship other gods
[32:03] that's why God knew right from the very
[32:05] beginning when he gave Moses the
[32:07] Commandments the very first commandment
[32:09] he saw that people were worshiping Idols
[32:12] they were worshiping people they were
[32:14] worshiping animals and the very first
[32:17] thing that he said listen you got to get
[32:19] yourself straight here you got to
[32:22] worship me and only me and if you
[32:25] worship me and only me then you will
[32:28] know me and on that day ye shall know
[32:30] that I am in the father ye in me and I
[32:33] in you you see this is all about a
[32:37] relationship about God unveiling himself
[32:40] the mystery of God unveiling himself in
[32:44] each and every age and now to you and me
[32:47] in this
[32:52] age so before me there was no God form
[32:55] neither shall there be after me I even I
[32:59] am the Lord and beside me there is no
[33:04] savior well what do you do with that
[33:06] scripture when somebody says oh no Jesus
[33:08] Christ is the
[33:10] savior and people will claim that oh no
[33:13] no there there's God you know there's
[33:15] God in heaven and then Jesus was the son
[33:18] and then there's the Holy Spirit and all
[33:20] three are separate beings that all agree
[33:23] as one and they all exist together as
[33:27] one but there's three no it's very clear
[33:32] that this is the Old Testament Isaiah 43
[33:35] it says besides me there is no savior so
[33:39] in other words God
[33:41] Messiah the Lord Elohim the
[33:44] self-existent one he's the only
[33:49] Savior Jesus Christ yes Jesus is the
[33:53] savior but Jesus Christ is God the word
[33:57] was made made flesh in the beginning was
[33:59] the word and if you go back in the
[34:01] beginning
[34:02] Elohim the self-existent one and the
[34:06] Word was with God and the Word was God
[34:09] but when God see God had all his
[34:13] thoughts in his mind but in order for
[34:15] something to manifest God had to speak
[34:19] his word that's why we use the
[34:23] foolishness of
[34:24] preaching because God is still speaking
[34:28] his
[34:28] word without the preaching of the word
[34:31] there is no
[34:33] salvation and people think salvation is
[34:36] just the one category oh my soul is
[34:39] saved yes that is salvation but there's
[34:43] a lot more in Salvation especially if
[34:47] you are still in a human
[34:50] vessel God saved you but he still
[34:53] continues to save you from day to day he
[34:57] continues because if you look up the
[34:59] actual word uh uh save
[35:03] savior it you know in Greek there's many
[35:06] different uh definitions and acronyms
[35:10] added to that actual word in there he's
[35:13] he he he he restores
[35:17] you he restores unto me the joy of his
[35:21] salvation how does he do that by the
[35:24] preaching of the word amen I believe
[35:27] it's in 1 Corinthians 1 verse1 17 if you
[35:31] read it it talks about the foolishness
[35:34] of preaching and how God has to preach
[35:37] the word of God and you know that in
[35:39] that savior word there's also
[35:42] healing that when you need to be healed
[35:45] that's why it's important that when we
[35:47] pray for somebody we speak the word of
[35:49] God the word of God has the power to go
[35:53] and heal because the word of God has
[35:56] power remember it comes from God Amen so
[36:01] he was the self-existent one but the
[36:04] word had to be
[36:05] expressed and so he was the word made
[36:09] flesh Jesus Christ God inh human flesh
[36:14] so that he could go to Calvary and take
[36:17] our place to redeem us and bring us back
[36:20] out of our
[36:22] Amnesia amen praise God so the
[36:25] characteristics of Elohim are one he's
[36:30] Eternal has no beginning and no
[36:34] end invisible hidden from the naked
[36:39] eye you cannot see
[36:42] God you must have
[36:45] faith in this Dimension to see the
[36:49] word to see God you need to see the word
[36:53] because the word is God and so when you
[36:56] see the word in your day and you
[36:59] recognize what it is that God is doing
[37:02] and what God has done and God sending us
[37:05] a prophet in the opening of The Seven
[37:07] Seals Amen in the in the in the opening
[37:11] of the of the uh the mysteries of the of
[37:14] the Seven Seals All the the mysteries of
[37:17] iniquity all those things being revealed
[37:20] in order for you to see that you must
[37:24] have the spirit of God you must be a a
[37:27] part of God you must have the word in
[37:31] you for the word to make contact deep
[37:36] call to the
[37:37] Deep amen he's
[37:40] omnipotent which means that he's all
[37:43] powerful there's nothing in your life
[37:46] that God can't deal with the foolishness
[37:49] of preaching can deal with absolutely
[37:51] everything that you are facing right
[37:54] now by the word of God you can receive
[37:57] everything everything that you need by
[37:59] the power of the Holy Spirit operating
[38:02] through the word of God
[38:04] Amen he's Omni powerful he's Omni potent
[38:07] it's all powerful he's omniscient
[38:09] there's nothing that he doesn't know
[38:12] you're worried about situations that
[38:15] that you you know a lot of you know us
[38:17] as human beings we create circumstances
[38:20] that don't
[38:22] exist here we are trying to figure
[38:25] things out you know and because we're
[38:27] human and you know we want to figure
[38:29] everything out beforehand we want to
[38:31] know that that this is how it's going to
[38:33] work out no once you've got faith in God
[38:37] knowing that he's
[38:38] omniscient and that he knows
[38:41] everything what are you getting so all
[38:45] puffed up about all concerned and all
[38:48] worried and all fearful when the god
[38:51] that you serve if you've truly come into
[38:54] a relationship with Elohim the
[38:56] self-existent one and you're not
[38:59] confused about a trinity or about who
[39:01] God actually is then that means you're
[39:03] walking with God and if you're walking
[39:06] with God and you know that he knows all
[39:09] things then there's nothing that you
[39:10] should
[39:11] fear but God
[39:14] himself to know that God knows all
[39:17] things amen he's omnipresent he can be
[39:21] anywhere and everywhere at the same time
[39:25] that's why we can pray for brother Doug
[39:27] Len
[39:28] knowing that God by the word that was
[39:30] spoken through our lips God can deal on
[39:34] the other side of Canada he's
[39:38] omnipresent amen praise God and what
[39:41] else he's infinite he's an infinite God
[39:46] he's
[39:47] absolutely uh without without end of
[39:53] possibilities so don't worry if you
[39:55] can't figure it out he's already already
[39:57] figured it
[40:00] out amen praise God and he's
[40:03] self-existing
[40:06] amen he doesn't create
[40:09] himself he's nonc created he's
[40:13] already he's always
[40:16] existed he's the self-existent
[40:18] one but he had a desire to bring forth a
[40:24] family amen praise God you know let me
[40:27] read read this from the book of
[40:28] adoption he says the word he's talking
[40:32] about self-existent one here Elohim the
[40:34] word means in the Hebrew the
[40:38] self-existence all by himself now listen
[40:42] carefully here he says nothing existed
[40:45] before him he was all existent there
[40:49] ever
[40:51] was
[40:53] self-existent Ella Elohim means the all
[40:57] sufficient all powerful Almighty
[41:01] self-sufficient self-existent one oh he
[41:05] says but in Genesis 2 when he made man
[41:08] he said I
[41:10] am
[41:14] yahushua Jehovah what did it mean I am
[41:19] the all existent one who was created
[41:23] something off of myself to be a son of
[41:26] mine
[41:28] or a temporary or an amateur little one
[41:32] of mine so all God did was he just
[41:37] expressed by his word
[41:40] himself and expressed himself into a
[41:44] son pay attention now oh Glory why he
[41:50] gave man Jehovah means that he gave man
[41:55] to be an amateur God
[41:58] you see this
[42:00] relationship that we have entered into
[42:04] as Christians in the 21st century the
[42:08] time and the season that we're living
[42:11] in is a
[42:14] relationship where we come to realize
[42:18] that that same
[42:20] portion that was always in God is in us
[42:26] and it's not something that we receive
[42:30] here it's not something that you were
[42:33] born to a certain family and because you
[42:36] were born to a certain family that
[42:38] entitled you to God no your name was
[42:44] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[42:45] before the foundations of The World God
[42:49] already knew you before he expressed all
[42:53] of this
[42:55] Earth okay remember before if you go
[42:58] back to the beginning in the beginning
[43:01] God Elohim the self-existent one there
[43:05] could have been thousands of other
[43:07] existences before this one year there
[43:10] could have been other civilizations
[43:12] before this one here we're not
[43:15] interested in knowing all of that but we
[43:18] know because we know that God is
[43:20] infinite and God has no beginning and no
[43:23] end when somebody says well how do you
[43:25] explain the dinosaurs and so many
[43:27] million years ago we don't need to
[43:29] explain it it was there because God is
[43:34] eternal there is no time or space in God
[43:38] remember he said that that the face of
[43:40] the waters was on the earth and it was
[43:43] void but then when he started to speak
[43:46] and said let there be let there come
[43:49] forth let every seed bring forth of its
[43:52] own kind do you know that everything may
[43:55] have already and probably was all laying
[43:58] right there in the waters in the deeps
[44:01] of the waters and God would speak to
[44:03] those Waters and speak to those seeds to
[44:06] those previous civilizations whatever
[44:09] was there it's irrelevant we need to
[44:13] understand that With God all things are
[44:15] possible but you need to also tune into
[44:19] the existence and the and the the the
[44:22] the
[44:23] civilization and the Earth that you now
[44:26] occupy
[44:28] and God has a plan for this civilization
[44:32] for this Earth for you and for
[44:35] me amen praise God and so here he goes
[44:40] on and he says now listen he says
[44:41] Jehovah means that he gave man to be an
[44:45] amateur God because he is Father God and
[44:48] he made an amateur God so he isn't
[44:52] self-existent anymore he exists with his
[44:56] family
[44:58] you see when you come into a
[45:00] relationship knowing now who God is it's
[45:04] because you're coming into his family
[45:07] and you start to take on the
[45:10] qualities and the
[45:13] abilities of God in your
[45:17] life it's supernatural to understand
[45:20] this but that's what God is God is
[45:24] Supernatural That's why we believe that
[45:27] God's A
[45:28] Healer we believe that if somebody gets
[45:30] sick and the doctor gives a report that
[45:33] we pray and we believe God's word and
[45:36] God never said that it was going to
[45:38] happen when we pray and we believe we're
[45:40] not expecting it that it should happen
[45:42] the very moment if it does that's a
[45:44] miracle that's great but God said let
[45:47] there be light and who knows how long it
[45:49] took before the light actually
[45:52] came you see understanding that when
[45:56] God's word
[45:57] is perfect it's om it's omn poent it's
[46:01] omniscient it's omnipresent then we
[46:04] don't put limitations on God we believe
[46:07] the
[46:08] word we just believe the word and so
[46:11] when the word says lay your hands upon
[46:13] the sick they shall recover you know
[46:16] that their recovery could be that the
[46:18] fact that their body needs to be changed
[46:20] and they need to go to that other
[46:22] dimension that might be their
[46:24] recovery that's God's interpret ration
[46:28] of the
[46:29] recovery because life is only temporal
[46:33] here but if he chooses to heal your body
[46:37] and he chooses that you know the
[46:39] minister prays for you this week and you
[46:41] don't get the healing for two
[46:43] years it still doesn't change the fact
[46:47] that he's your
[46:48] healer and that you will hold to that to
[46:51] that truth and to that promise in the
[46:54] word of God because if you're a true son
[46:57] or daughter of God you can't disbelieve
[47:00] God's
[47:00] word this thing might get tired and it
[47:03] might you know get angry and it it'll
[47:05] fight up it'll do that all the time oh I
[47:08] don't think God is dealing with this and
[47:10] I don't believe God you know wants to
[47:12] help me in this area I don't believe
[47:13] you're just speaking the devil's
[47:15] language when you're doing
[47:17] that you need to say God is my healer
[47:21] when he wants to heal me he'll heal
[47:24] me he will interpret it himself self I
[47:27] don't need to try and interpret it if
[47:30] you're a true amateur God you come into
[47:33] that understanding and Revelation with
[47:36] God and your walk now is not a walk of
[47:39] fear a walk of Doubt a walk of wondering
[47:44] and and
[47:45] hoping it's a walk of Faith to know that
[47:49] God can do what he said he will do and
[47:53] he'll do it in his time not in my time
[47:56] and so here now he says he says you now
[48:00] he exists with his family amen Ella
[48:03] Elohim now now he's Jehovah and
[48:06] Jehovah's meaning is the one who exists
[48:10] with his
[48:12] family glory to God hallelujah you want
[48:15] to know about church this is the true
[48:18] meaning of church when you come to a
[48:21] realization of the god that you serve is
[48:24] not some trinitarian Doctrine and
[48:27] teaching but he's a living God that you
[48:29] now walk with have experienced and are
[48:33] experiencing every single day in your
[48:36] life even though you're a weak human
[48:39] being because when you're at your
[48:41] weakest point you know God is strongest
[48:43] in your life that's when everything can
[48:46] change when you can get all your pride
[48:48] out of the way get all yourself out of
[48:51] the way all your own thoughts and ideas
[48:53] out of the way and just allow God to
[48:55] come in and deal with whatever it is and
[48:59] trust that he's going to interpret his
[49:00] word amen now he is Jehovah now he's one
[49:05] who exists with his family now God made
[49:08] man to be the predominant over all the
[49:11] Earth he had dominion and the Earth was
[49:14] man's
[49:16] Dominion this is all
[49:19] scripture then if that's his domain he
[49:22] was God over the Earth he could speak
[49:25] and it would be so he could speak this
[49:28] and it would be so or there he is god
[49:31] Jehovah the one who once existed in
[49:35] self-existence but now exist with his
[49:38] family and his little ones with him
[49:41] there you
[49:42] are amen praise God hallelujah let's go
[49:46] to the next
[49:47] slide let's look at the attributes
[49:51] Elohim needed to be expressed and
[49:54] manifested Elohim and his thoughts
[49:57] amen a word is a thought
[50:01] expressed but the thing with God is when
[50:04] he expresses his thoughts they come into
[50:08] manifestation that's why you were a
[50:11] thought of God from before the
[50:13] foundations of the world but there would
[50:16] be a time and a season that you would
[50:18] have to come into manifestation as a
[50:21] Christian which is Christlike that's
[50:25] what the word means a son or a daughter
[50:28] of God Amen and so a
[50:32] word is a thought expressed and Elohim
[50:36] in his thoughts expressed god father
[50:40] savior healer
[50:43] priest and King but it's all the same
[50:47] person he wanted to be God he wanted to
[50:50] be worshiped he wanted you to recognize
[50:53] that he was the one and only
[50:57] true one that could be worshiped he
[51:00] wanted to be a father here on this Earth
[51:04] remember it's an expression father is
[51:07] only an expression of an Earthly
[51:11] experience but when you go back to your
[51:15] theophany back to the who you always
[51:17] were as an eternal son or daughter of
[51:21] God because remember if you're a son or
[51:23] a daughter you're Eternal you had no
[51:25] beginning you can have have no end
[51:27] you're just going to go back into the
[51:30] existence of God we call it the mind of
[51:33] God but it's a place it's a it's it's
[51:36] it's an existence that's so much greater
[51:39] and so much higher than what we're even
[51:41] seeing
[51:42] here eyes have not seen ears have not
[51:45] heard nor has it even entered into the
[51:48] heart of man into the mind of man what
[51:51] God truly has for us when we go back to
[51:55] our original State as Sons and Daughters
[51:59] attributes of God we call it Sons and
[52:02] Daughters we we we we identify it as
[52:06] male and female but that was only God
[52:08] expressing himself there is no real male
[52:13] and female when you go right back into
[52:16] the mind of
[52:17] Elohim it's God expressing himself in
[52:21] two ways as that within him is male and
[52:25] female but you see the world has taken
[52:28] all of that and perverted it and that's
[52:31] why you've got all these different
[52:33] genders and now you've got you know
[52:36] homosexuality and and and everything
[52:38] else because they've perverted the
[52:41] reality of God's
[52:44] word amen praise God he wanted to be a
[52:48] savior he wanted to be a Healer he
[52:51] wanted to be a priest he wanted to be a
[52:53] king amen the only way we can can know
[52:57] him in that way is we had to come into
[52:59] this
[53:01] civilization into this
[53:04] creation this is all the creation of God
[53:08] but we happen to be Eternal
[53:11] attributes
[53:13] in a created body living here in this
[53:18] earth let's move on he's going to be a
[53:22] judge
[53:23] too in the millennium
[53:27] so here now we go to the next
[53:30] slide and we look at Elohim and his
[53:36] thoughts and we look at Time and Time
[53:39] started When sin took place in the
[53:42] Garden of Eden and brought death that's
[53:46] why God is eternal there is no time in
[53:49] God the only reason that we deal with
[53:53] time is because of death
[53:56] now I know you know a lot of these
[53:58] things but this Foundation is so
[54:00] important for somebody to have a real
[54:03] experience with God and to enter into
[54:06] that relationship so that God you know
[54:09] you know listen when when God called me
[54:11] I remember when God called me 30 years
[54:13] ago it wasn't that God got me all
[54:16] excited that he had sent a
[54:18] prophet that's not what caught me it was
[54:22] the fact that God had revealed himself
[54:24] to me made himself known that I was
[54:29] actually loved by him that I I could
[54:33] actually have contact with the Living
[54:35] God that he that he that he became my
[54:38] healer because I was sick I was very
[54:41] sick and so were all of
[54:43] you in some way shape or form you were
[54:46] sick and you needed God to heal you and
[54:49] to take you out of that sickness people
[54:52] are in the world healthy you know
[54:55] exercising every day have the healthiest
[54:58] bodies and blood and everything else but
[55:00] they're
[55:01] sick without
[55:03] God because they're headed to one thing
[55:08] and that's death and death is separation
[55:11] from God so I don't care how healthy or
[55:15] how wealthy you might be if you don't
[55:18] have God in your life you're going to
[55:20] have an end and things are not going to
[55:23] get better things are only going to get
[55:25] worse
[55:27] because what has been prophesied for
[55:29] this Earth and what is already now
[55:31] taking place around us here on Earth
[55:35] just look at Israel and the state there
[55:37] and look at United States and the the
[55:40] the the separation and the division of
[55:42] the people and everything that's going
[55:43] on in the confusion in the churches and
[55:46] in the in the schools and the gender uh
[55:50] controversies and all of these we are in
[55:53] we are living in the days of Sodom the
[55:56] Bible said that as it was in the days of
[55:59] Sodom so will it be when God reveals
[56:02] himself to those that are that are
[56:04] predestinated to receive the word for
[56:06] their day the conditions are exactly
[56:09] where they are supposed to
[56:11] be that's why we don't need to be
[56:13] screaming out against it and protesting
[56:15] against it we need to be shouting that
[56:18] Jesus Christ is Savior Jesus Christ is
[56:22] your healer Jesus Christ can restore you
[56:25] back to who you really are you're in a
[56:29] spiritual Amnesia and you need to wake
[56:31] up out of it amen so time was the result
[56:36] of sin had there been no fall in the
[56:39] Garden of Eden there would be no death
[56:41] and death is is a definition of
[56:45] time if there was no time and you didn't
[56:48] die if there was no death you wouldn't
[56:50] care about time your body wouldn't
[56:53] age Amen in the beginning was was the
[56:56] word and the Word was with God and the
[56:59] Word was God and the Word was made flesh
[57:04] just like we said earlier Jesus
[57:08] Christ go on to the next slide and he
[57:10] says here in this great Fountain this
[57:13] great Fountain of spirit which had no
[57:16] beginning or no end this great spirit
[57:19] begin to form in the
[57:21] [Music]
[57:23] creation and the logos that went up out
[57:26] from it was the son of God that's why
[57:30] the word was with God and the Word was
[57:33] made flesh the word went out from God
[57:37] took on a human
[57:39] vessel not through a sex act because
[57:43] this had to be a perfect
[57:45] sacrifice this could not come through
[57:48] the original sin the original sin was a
[57:51] sex act it was it was in it took place
[57:55] in the garden of with the serpent and
[57:58] Eve and that's why there was two
[58:00] children
[58:01] born one came the other one able one a
[58:06] murderer and the other one had
[58:08] Revelation on what to bring to God and
[58:11] offer unto
[58:13] God Amen so many things that were
[58:18] revealed but here it was the only
[58:20] visible form that the spirit had and it
[58:24] was a theophany which means a body and a
[58:27] body was like a man that's from brother
[58:32] Brandon go to the next
[58:35] slide so the theophany image was
[58:38] expressed in Jesus Christ and that is
[58:41] showing to us what we are going to be go
[58:45] how we're going to be going
[58:46] back that we are going to
[58:49] actually go back to our theophany bodies
[58:52] which are Eternal bodies which have no
[58:55] beginning and no end you'll be exactly
[58:58] the way you were like when you were like
[59:00] 19 20 years old in your perfect youth
[59:04] that's the that's the body that's
[59:06] waiting for us amen and so in the
[59:10] beginning Genesis 1 in the beginning God
[59:13] created heaven and the
[59:16] Earth let's move on and God said let us
[59:20] make man in our image after our likeness
[59:25] and let them have dominion over the fish
[59:28] of the sea the the the and over the fowl
[59:31] of the air and over the cattle and over
[59:34] all the Earth and over every creeping
[59:36] thing that creepeth upon the Earth so
[59:39] God created Man In His Image own image
[59:43] in the image of God created he him male
[59:46] and female created he them so here he
[59:51] was you know before this Earth
[59:56] came into its existence as we know it
[1:00:00] now God said let us so who was the us
[1:00:05] that he was talking about
[1:00:08] us we were there where were you when the
[1:00:12] sons of God sang around the throne and
[1:00:15] rejoiced around the throne with God
[1:00:17] before the foundations of the world
[1:00:20] where were you you were there but you
[1:00:23] came into this Earthly existence through
[1:00:26] a spiritual through a through a a
[1:00:28] spiritual Amnesia going into a human
[1:00:30] body and now by the preaching of the
[1:00:33] word you're being called back out of
[1:00:37] your
[1:00:38] Amnesia that's why line upon line
[1:00:41] precept upon precept that's why the word
[1:00:44] as we preach the word and as we bring
[1:00:46] forth the word of God it sets you more
[1:00:49] and more free into that relationship
[1:00:52] with God and into a relationship knowing
[1:00:56] who you are and who he is amen and so he
[1:01:00] created male and
[1:01:03] female and then he asked this question
[1:01:05] now let us who Father and Son make man
[1:01:10] in our own image it was God himself with
[1:01:15] his attributes because a son is just
[1:01:18] it's we it's a word but literally its
[1:01:22] attribute its expression it is the word
[1:01:26] the word being
[1:01:28] expressed amen praise God that's why we
[1:01:31] talk about the word the word the word
[1:01:34] you got to believe the word that's why
[1:01:36] when we say to somebody yeah but the
[1:01:37] word says and and yeah but my priest
[1:01:41] told me this it doesn't matter what your
[1:01:44] priest said it doesn't matter what the
[1:01:47] the psychology teacher said it doesn't
[1:01:49] matter what the the the the Oneness uh
[1:01:52] the the the you know New Age movement
[1:01:56] teaching says you need to understand
[1:01:59] what the word says you need to go back
[1:02:02] to the original word which is the mind
[1:02:04] of God and when you go back to the word
[1:02:07] of God you got to realize again that
[1:02:10] it's still going to take God to reveal
[1:02:13] himself to you it's not you trying to
[1:02:16] figure out God you see all the teachings
[1:02:19] of psychology and the teachings of man
[1:02:22] that's man's interpretation on the word
[1:02:25] of God
[1:02:26] but God says I don't need anybody to
[1:02:28] interpret my word I will come I will be
[1:02:32] with you I will be in you I will give
[1:02:35] you the spirit of Truth and it will
[1:02:38] reveal to you all
[1:02:41] truth you won't need to put your own
[1:02:44] interpretation because when you read the
[1:02:46] word and his spirit is in you to read
[1:02:49] the word you'll your conscious mind by
[1:02:53] the
[1:02:54] spirit connects with the word of God and
[1:02:57] says amen I see
[1:02:59] it that's why when somebody says repent
[1:03:02] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:03:06] Jesus Christ you know that that name is
[1:03:09] the name of the father that's why when
[1:03:12] Jesus says go ye into all the world
[1:03:14] baptizing in the name of the father and
[1:03:17] of the son and of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:03:20] the all the denominations out there
[1:03:22] they'll use that as as the scripture to
[1:03:25] back up their baptism they need to read
[1:03:28] that again it says the name go ye into
[1:03:33] all the world baptizing them in the name
[1:03:36] of the father listen my name is Dany I'm
[1:03:39] a father I was with my parents today I'm
[1:03:43] a
[1:03:43] son but my name is
[1:03:47] Dany doesn't change who I am just like
[1:03:51] Jesus Christ there's no other name I can
[1:03:54] show you scripture after scripture
[1:03:56] there's no other name whereby man must
[1:03:59] be saved but by the name of Jesus Christ
[1:04:04] in all that you do do it in the name of
[1:04:08] Jesus Christ because the name Jesus
[1:04:12] means Jehovah Our
[1:04:15] Savior it's God it's the same
[1:04:19] self-existent one amen praise God so
[1:04:23] second Corinthians next slide
[1:04:26] 2 Corinthians 51-2 so for we know that
[1:04:29] if our Earthly house this
[1:04:33] Tabernacle we're dissolved we have a
[1:04:36] building of God we have a
[1:04:38] body portion
[1:04:41] attribute peace of God that we represent
[1:04:45] that we go back
[1:04:47] to that's what salvation is all about
[1:04:51] salvation is being taken out of this
[1:04:54] world in all the tribulation that's
[1:04:57] going to come upon it to go back to your
[1:05:01] original
[1:05:03] state in a brand new body that had no
[1:05:07] beginning and no
[1:05:09] end a building of God and house not made
[1:05:13] with
[1:05:14] hands but Eternal in the heavens for in
[1:05:18] this we grown earnestly Desiring to be
[1:05:21] clothed upon with our house which is
[1:05:25] from heaven in other words we're
[1:05:28] groaning for that theophany to connect
[1:05:31] and pick us up and take us out of this
[1:05:34] Dimension and that's what's going on
[1:05:36] when you hear the foolishness of
[1:05:38] preaching and the word of God being
[1:05:40] preached you're connecting with your
[1:05:43] theophany when you hear this word and
[1:05:45] you're hearing truth and you're saying
[1:05:47] amen praise God I see it it's because
[1:05:50] you're connecting with your
[1:05:54] Heavenly Body
[1:05:57] Hallelujah glory to God Amen that's the
[1:06:01] true
[1:06:03] relationship then not theophany go next
[1:06:06] then not theophany was made flesh in the
[1:06:10] person Jesus Christ and then all the
[1:06:13] fullness of the Trinity now brother
[1:06:16] bradam speaking he he talks about
[1:06:19] Trinity all the fullness of the Trinity
[1:06:21] meaning the father Son and Holy
[1:06:23] Ghost dwelt in
[1:06:27] him in the self-existent one both Father
[1:06:32] Son and Holy Spirit all in that all in
[1:06:36] that one self-existent one one and only
[1:06:41] true and living God not three Gods Not A
[1:06:44] Trinity but
[1:06:46] God the self-existent one listen when
[1:06:50] Phillip you know walked up to Jesus and
[1:06:52] said Lord show us the father Jesus
[1:06:55] looked at him he says Phillip have I
[1:06:57] been with you for so long if you see me
[1:07:00] you see the
[1:07:02] father it's not I that doeth the works
[1:07:05] but the father that dwelleth in me he
[1:07:09] doeth The Works you see it's all over
[1:07:12] the scripture but then you you talk to
[1:07:14] trinitarians and and and because they do
[1:07:17] not have a
[1:07:19] revelation remember God needs to reveal
[1:07:23] to
[1:07:24] you that he he is God am until then
[1:07:28] you'll be you'll listen to Buddha one
[1:07:30] day and you'll say oh you know this guy
[1:07:32] kind of makes sense and then you'll the
[1:07:34] next day you'll start to listen to the
[1:07:35] New Age movement you start saying you
[1:07:37] know what this kind of connects and
[1:07:39] you'll start putting all these manmade
[1:07:42] interpretations on the word of God where
[1:07:45] there is absolutely no private
[1:07:48] interpretation the scripture says lean
[1:07:51] not unto your own understanding
[1:07:56] you need to hold on to the word of God
[1:07:59] the absolute truth make him Jehovah make
[1:08:02] him the absolute make him your your your
[1:08:06] savior period there's nobody else
[1:08:11] there's no other mediator somebody wants
[1:08:12] to pray to the Virgin Mary they want to
[1:08:14] pray to Saint this and saint that for
[1:08:17] this or for that there is no other
[1:08:20] mediator but Jesus Christ who is
[1:08:24] God hallelujah
[1:08:26] amen let's move
[1:08:28] on let's look at the Old Testament this
[1:08:31] is a study okay I trust that you know I
[1:08:34] know that you know a lot of this but it
[1:08:36] just you know I get blessed when I when
[1:08:39] I see all of this and I it just confirms
[1:08:43] that who I actually am it's confirming
[1:08:46] my existence as a son or daughter of God
[1:08:49] Amen praise God and the Lord went before
[1:08:52] them by day in the pillar of a
[1:08:56] Cloud to lead
[1:08:58] them in the way and by night in a pillar
[1:09:02] of fire to give them light to go by day
[1:09:06] and
[1:09:08] night the lord of the Old
[1:09:11] Testament the pillar of fire of the Old
[1:09:15] Testament is the same God of the New
[1:09:18] Testament amen praise God next slide God
[1:09:22] represented himself as the pillar of
[1:09:25] fire the cloud by day the shakina glory
[1:09:29] Mana from Heaven the brass serpent The
[1:09:32] Rock in the wilderness all the same God
[1:09:37] Exodus
[1:09:39] 13:21 and the Lord went before them by
[1:09:42] pillar
[1:09:43] in in a pillar of cloud to lead them oh
[1:09:47] we already read that one move
[1:09:50] on okay let's go on
[1:09:55] just keep going you're gonna come up to
[1:10:00] mzc who was
[1:10:03] mzc let's read it when Jesus was
[1:10:06] manifested brother Brandon back in
[1:10:08] Christ revealed in his own word when
[1:10:11] Jesus was manifested in the Old
[1:10:12] Testament in a theophany in the person
[1:10:15] of
[1:10:16] MDC not a priesthood but the
[1:10:20] person the man see for this man had yet
[1:10:25] not being born but he was in a theophany
[1:10:29] so he had no father no mother he was God
[1:10:35] that's who mzc was when he came down to
[1:10:38] meet Abraham it was God himself he was
[1:10:41] manifested in the form of a man called
[1:10:45] King of Salem which is king of peace and
[1:10:48] king of righteousness see he was MDC he
[1:10:52] had neither father nor mother beginning
[1:10:54] of days or ending of Life see it was
[1:10:58] Jesus in theophany in the form of a
[1:11:03] man could you go
[1:11:09] that so let's look at the next slide
[1:11:13] questions how did God ever become Our
[1:11:16] Savior did we have two saviors when
[1:11:19] Jesus came upon the
[1:11:22] Earth clue go to the next slide Isaiah
[1:11:27] 43:10 we read this before me there was
[1:11:30] no God form neither shall there be after
[1:11:33] me I even I the Lord and beside me there
[1:11:38] is no savior we already went through
[1:11:40] this but just to reiterate it to show it
[1:11:43] in the Old Testament that there is only
[1:11:46] one savior we want to know clearly who
[1:11:49] our God
[1:11:51] is amen praise God go to the next the
[1:11:55] blood
[1:11:56] Covenant Hebrews 9:22 and almost all
[1:11:59] things are by the law purged with blood
[1:12:04] that's why he had to
[1:12:06] come as a human he needed to create
[1:12:10] himself a human vessel so that blood
[1:12:13] could be shed for our
[1:12:16] sin amen because without the shedding of
[1:12:20] blood there is no remission of sin and
[1:12:23] that's why God had to create himself a
[1:12:25] human body to to dwell in to go to
[1:12:28] Calvary let's move
[1:12:34] on he became human God is a spirit he
[1:12:38] had no hands till he became
[1:12:41] Jesus he had no feet arms legs and so
[1:12:45] forth till he become Jesus he come to a
[1:12:49] stable borned over a manure pile and
[1:12:52] little Jehovah crying in a little manger
[1:12:55] little Jehovah playing as a little boy
[1:12:58] little Jehovah toiling as a man he
[1:13:00] crossed his cast with
[1:13:04] us God become human when Jesus Christ
[1:13:08] was born God was human on earth he
[1:13:11] toiled and labored and felt for the
[1:13:13] teenager he went through every
[1:13:16] Temptation that we go
[1:13:18] through God did it and he might do it
[1:13:21] his own judgment
[1:13:23] Justice brother BR him back and show us
[1:13:26] the
[1:13:28] father go to the next
[1:13:34] slides and the great
[1:13:36] Creator became my savior come down to a
[1:13:40] little blood self not through a man but
[1:13:43] come virgin to a woman and took this
[1:13:47] little pollen from the woman and formed
[1:13:50] himself a little
[1:13:52] house and lived in it oh it ought to be
[1:13:55] striking Jehovah over a pile of manure
[1:13:59] in a barn crying Jehovah in a Manger of
[1:14:02] straw that's an everlasting
[1:14:07] sign amen Isaiah 9:6 and we're going to
[1:14:11] close with this let the musicians
[1:14:14] come it says For unto us a child is born
[1:14:18] unto us a son is given and the
[1:14:21] government shall be upon his shoulder
[1:14:24] and his name Shall be Called
[1:14:27] wonderful counselor the Mighty God the
[1:14:32] Everlasting father the Prince of
[1:14:36] Peace who was Isaiah talking
[1:14:41] about Jesus
[1:14:44] Christ the lord and savior that's why
[1:14:47] when you say the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:14:52] you're talking about the Father the Lord
[1:14:55] Lord Jesus the son Christ the Holy Ghost
[1:15:00] and all
[1:15:01] three are
[1:15:04] one are
[1:15:07] one you see why it's so important to
[1:15:11] know who God actually
[1:15:14] is because if you're not making
[1:15:18] him this
[1:15:20] god Jehovah God the god of the Old
[1:15:24] Testament
[1:15:26] Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus
[1:15:28] Christ of the New
[1:15:30] Testament then you you can't even get
[1:15:32] baptized
[1:15:34] properly you'll believe in a baby
[1:15:37] baptism because your family was Catholic
[1:15:39] and they brought you up as Catholic and
[1:15:41] and they baptized you as a baby and you
[1:15:44] think that that's good
[1:15:46] enough but the Bible says he that
[1:15:48] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[1:15:52] how does a baby believe you see all
[1:15:55] these things these are the very
[1:15:57] foundations of
[1:15:59] Christianity these are the foundations
[1:16:01] that if you don't start
[1:16:04] right you're going to be shocked on that
[1:16:06] day when the Rapture takes place and
[1:16:09] there's going to be a lot of churches
[1:16:11] out there that are going to be going to
[1:16:12] church on a Sunday morning and the
[1:16:15] Rapture will have already taken place
[1:16:18] because if you don't know that Jesus
[1:16:20] Christ The Same Spirit that raised
[1:16:23] Christ from the dead which is the the
[1:16:26] spirit of God if that spirit is not
[1:16:29] dwelling in
[1:16:31] you your body's not going to be
[1:16:33] quickened out of this
[1:16:35] Dimension you're going to be believing a
[1:16:37] Doctrine you're going to be holding to a
[1:16:39] Creed of man you're going to be holding
[1:16:41] to what you were taught and you're going
[1:16:43] to go into the church one morning and
[1:16:44] you're going to go to your priest or
[1:16:46] your pastor and you're going to say wait
[1:16:47] a minute here you were teaching me three
[1:16:50] Gods Trinity you were putting uh all
[1:16:54] these interpretations on the word of God
[1:16:56] and here now look at this world it's
[1:16:58] completely falling apart it's going into
[1:16:59] Great Tribulation and I'm still stuck
[1:17:02] here I thought I was supposed to go into
[1:17:05] Rapture but you
[1:17:07] see here's the
[1:17:10] Paradox if you are a son or a daughter
[1:17:14] of God you always
[1:17:18] were and you can't miss the
[1:17:22] Rapture the Rapture is for for the body
[1:17:26] of
[1:17:27] Christ it's for the called out Body of
[1:17:31] Christ it's that body that's going to go
[1:17:33] in the Rapture and Jesus said all that
[1:17:37] the father hath given me will come not
[1:17:41] one of them will be
[1:17:42] lost my sheep hear my voice not might
[1:17:47] hear hear my
[1:17:49] voice and so they will come when they
[1:17:52] hear this word in this way according to
[1:17:57] the word of God according to the
[1:18:00] scriptures that we've used here to back
[1:18:02] up that God is one God and his name is
[1:18:07] the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise God
[1:18:11] aren't you glad that you know him in
[1:18:12] that
[1:18:13] way
