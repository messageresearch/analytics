um what the Lord is going to do for us Amen in the coming new year as this year comes to a close praise God anybody have a need this morning that they want to say Lord remember me as we we just ask the Lord to come to the service in a special way now as we change the order of the service may he come and speak to our needs father you see every uplifted hand you see every heart you look deep within every need and you can go beyond Lord what we even know you know what our future holds you know what's coming down the road and so we ask you to come this morning and just uh meet with us move through the pews this morning speak to Hearts lift the burden Lord I know that many are feeling the pressure of this time of the year Lord where they have to prepare there's so many things and buying gifts and all the traditions of this time of the year but Lord as we enter into your courts this morning Lord lift supernaturally all of that pressure lift it off your people Lord and take us into Heavenly places where all things are possible and you can speak to us a little bit here this morning and allow us to leave here rejoicing Grant it we pray father we give you thanks and all the glory in Jesus Christ's name amen praise God let's go to our scripture this morning amen what is God up to what is God up to we are going to watch a very short video um you know God is always up to something amen you need to know that you need to realize that you need to get out of tradition you need to get out of oh it's Christmas we're going to give gifts we're going to get together with the family we're going to eat turkey no there's a lot more going on than meets the ey amen and we want to know what God is up to this Christmas so let's watch this very very short um trigger video and then we will go to the word of God Amen [Music] [Music] amen praise God what is God up to let's read our scripture let's all stand Isaiah chapter 9:6 a very familiar scripture but something that um never ceases to amaze uh all Christians and all people worldwide For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the mighty Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace praise God you may be seated God bless you amen as we watch that video you probably noticed the word Advent you know uh because this time of the year many of the churches they start their Christmas season and they call it Advent but for us when we look at the word Advent and we actually look at the definition of the word in Christian theology it's the coming or second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and so the world is is constantly under that expectation in this day that he's coming again and that you know they're they're waiting and they're they're they're uh celebrating and rejoicing that the that the child was born and they're looking back at Jesus Christ in the form of a baby and then growing into a man and then knowing that he will be coming back again but here we are the True Church of God those that have recognized not just what he's done in the past and through history and what he's going to do in the future but recognizing what he is doing now the importance of recognizing that the word of God never sleeps it is constantly evolving and progressing and the and the church is a great part of that Evolution right now of the body of Jesus Christ and so we're looking at this um thought today you know I came across this and and I thought you know I it kind of triggered me and it's a great question for Christmas what is God up to that's a that's a waiting question like you saw there it's an expectation question because a lot of people you know for some people Christmas well wonder what the Christmas tree is going to bring me this year I wonder what gifts are going to be under the tree this year I wonder if I'm going to get a Christmas bonus or a promotion at work you know for people it's it's a it's a question that that you can take it in so many different ways and it means so many different things to so many different people but for the church Church those that are that have recognized that that that God is prophetically bringing his word to pass and that there are events taking place around us that all surround and evolve around the coming of the Mighty God the scriptures said he'd he'd be the Prince of Peace the scriptures said that the government would be upon his shoulders a lot of them would look back and they would think of Jesus when he came to to the Earth and they they they would have thought oh he's going to be he's going to be the new government he's the new king he's going to wipe out the Roman Empire that are taking Israel and placing them under this type of slavery and bondage at times and trying to control them but here he means so much more to us as the true church the Sons and Daughters of God in this day and in this hour amen we know he's up to something big he's preparing something he's getting ready to do something what is it what is it for you I know what it is for me I know that the Rapture is something that stirs within my heart every single moment every single day amen there's a word of Prophecy that God has prepared for the church in this day and in this hour and and we've been placed under the right expectation because we come into a right relationship it's when we ask what what are you up to Lord we can see so many times in our daily lives and the activities and the circumstances that we that we come into sometimes we find oursel under such oppression sometimes we find ourselves elated with such joy and you can ask the same question when you're in both those extremes Lord what are you up to what are you doing in my life amen and so you know this question is what we're going to just look into a little bit today we we want to search and see where God has us what he's doing what he wants to do in our individual lives and put us under the right expectation at this Christmas time amen praise God and so let's read um uh first of all uh I want you to notice here when um a quote here listen to brother brandham he says here in the in the quote 1961 expectation about the scripture we just read he says now let's say Simeon was setting back in his study maybe it's on a Monday morning all the priests are at their work and there was about two and a half million Jews in Palestine at that time so several babies was borned overnight on the Eighth Day the males had to be circumcised let's think Simeon sitting back in his office he's got the word he's looking all through it like that and he comes upon the scroll perhaps over here in Isaiah and he says Isaiah 6:9 and then that kind of caught my attention and so I stopped right there when I was reading the quote and I said because when you read on you know that he's talking about Isaiah 9:6 but it caught my attention so I went back and I looked at Isaiah 6:9 and I always read a scripture before it and a scripture after it and this is what it said also I have heard the voice of the Lord this this is verse 8 saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then said I here am I send me and this is verse n and he said go and tell this people hear ye indeed but understand not you see th this this message that that we have that God has given us we've been told to go and pronounce this message but many many don't understand really what God was doing when he came to the earth a lot of them have it in their mind as a story but he says here he says make the heart of this people fat and make their ears heavy and shut their eyes lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and convert and be healed my God this message that that that God has given us is so much greater than what the people make it the they call it Christmas there's so much more to this yes that that that that if we can just settle ourselves down here this morning forget about all the meals and forget about all the pressure and forget about the the the the jobs and and all of the things that are heavy on our mind minds and we just enter into the true meaning of this season we can draw from it miraculous things and one of the most miraculous is that unto you it has been given to know these things Jesus and so he goes on here in the quote after he says over here in Isaiah 69 he says he says to us and then he quotes the scripture to us a son is born a child is given so forth his name shall be called called counselor Prince of Peace the Mighty God the Everlasting father I can just imagine him sitting there he's talking about Simeon now now all the time little Mary was on her Road up there to have the baby circumcised she comes into the prayer line or whatever it might be the line going up for circumcision all the babies was dressed in nice little fine needle work you know and cute little fellows and no teeth you know and oh I just love them he says and see the little guys there and mothers sweet with their little baby but here he had wrapped in his swaddling cloth you know where they got it off the Yoke of an ox in the stall and yet the very creator of Heaven and Earth and we put on a $50 suit and just turn up our noses like if it would rain it would drown us and our savior was born without even clothes to wrap him in foxes has dens the birds of the air has Nest but the son of man has not a place to lay his head who are we how should we well I'm I belong to the biggest church in this city oh mercy brother sister when you feel like that you're getting away from God right then God has he's he's obligated to me he's obligated to nothing you're obligated to him amen he done his part you've got to believe just like the rest of them believe you've got to come the same way they come so you can picture the scene here you know when Jesus first came came to the Earth the first time it was just an ordinary day just another day in in Jerusalem it was just another day in the city they were they were circumcising babies but yet the Messiah the Mighty God a child had been born a son had been given the government would be upon his shoulders he would be the one to to reconcile the world back to himself and yet very few recognized what was going on why because of the way that he came amen glory to God and so after 2,000 years the events of Jesus's birth become so fil so so familiar to everybody you know at this time of the year they're doing the plays in the churches the baby uh manger scene and all all the you know the the three Magi and the and and coming to to worship the king and all of those things has just become a lost novelty the star the Shepherds the wise men of birth in the stable a 5-year-old can recite the basic outline of the Christmas story these days but don't have Christmas in their hearts amen but we forget for the people who were actually involved in it there was it wasn't it wasn't just another ordinary day no Mary knew about her experience she knew what had taken place she knew that the angel of the Lord had come and spoke to her and said blessed art thou amongst all women God had chosen her of all the women he chose her to be the carrier amen the mother carrier not the mother of God like they like to say that Mary is the mother of God Mary there's no mother of God how can God have a mother he had no beginning in no end mother was was something instituted as a result of unbelief you know that yeah it originated back in the garden when when Adam looked and and and God had taken from his rib uh and made a woman he looked at her and called her name Eve which means the mother of all living you know why he called her Eve because he knew that she would be beguiled and that that sons and daughters would now be coming through through the law of sex that she would be you know that that that God's original plan which was that he could just speak into existence and everything changed right at that moment and motherhood became a part of this existence and so we need to put everything in its proper perspective you see when God allows you to go back to the beginning and says it was not so from the beginning amen then you understand why it was not so and then you can start to put together everything and understand why you cannot worship a woman and worship Mary and call her the mother of God when God's plan had nothing to do with that other than the Redemptive plan through a sinful birth yeah we're not going to get into all of that we've been covering a lot of that over the last few services but here we need to see that it wasn't just an ordinary day for for those individuals every part of it was startling even shocking unfamiliar unprecedented and uncomfortable they were all surely asking at every turn the ones that were that Joseph who knew he had not been with Mary but yet she was she had brought forth this child he knew that he was a supernatural child it wasn't just an ordinary day and for you as Sons and Daughters of God that God has come and intervened in your life and opened your understanding to know the word and to Now read the word and and to draw all of this all these nuggets out of the word don't take it for granted amen your understanding of the word and your ability to see these things Jesus said blessed are your eyes Hallelujah for For unto you it has been given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom these are the mysteries of the Kingdom the things that we're talking about here everybody else out there wants to make Christmas just a fairy tale or a story and a lot of them will even tell you that go to church they go to church and they'll tell you not all the stories that you read in the Bible true and I tell them yes you're absolutely right to you but not to me because because the spirit has made it Li live the spirit has given life to the word and now I can understand it all by the grace of God what God is allowing me to see and what God is allowing me to understand up until now amen hallelujah so if you want to know what God is like you need to you need to watch how he behaves look at look at Jesus listen to what he said and watch what he did and that's how you'll understand that he's the same yesterday today and forever let's let's read the next scripture here in John Chapter 14 verse 6 to9 just draw the picture here Jesus walking with the disciples and Jesus here saith unto him and he's and he's talking to Phillip they're walking along and and they're and they're questioning him because they're they're mesmerized remember it wasn't ordinary for these people Jesus had now gone from a baby to a to a child to a young man and moved into his public Ministry just like he is right now in our lives and Jesus sayth unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me he was making it very clear and I and and and if if there's anything we want to make clear today to everybody that's here and those that are listening in that are that are hearing this message is I want you to know that Jesus Christ is still the only way truth and life amen there is no other way to escape this Dimension and what will be coming upon this Dimension and that's why we've made we we've made it uh Our Lives to to feed on the word of God and to understand all that God is giving us in this day which will produce the Rapture of the church if ye had known me listen he says here now if you had known me you should have known my father also now you need to pay close attention to his words they're they're they're so profound he says and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him well wait a minute Philip is now he's perplexed now he's he's totally perplexed he say wait what but he turns around he Philip saith unto him Lord because like he like he he he was like set back there he says wait a minute what's he saying to me's saying that that I'm seeing the father and that's why he comes back with this question he says Lord show us the father and it sufficeth us Jesus saith unto him have I been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me who's speaking to him thank you Jesus it was the father speaking through the son because he he had he had come into the office of the son he had to come as a human being so that he could go to Calvary so that he could fulfill his own word because God is not a liar God cannot he said heavens and earth will pass away but my prophecy my word that which I spoke in Isaiah 9: 6 it is going to come to pass it will be fulfilled amen glory to God he says he says have hast thou not known me Phillip he that hath seen me hath seen the father and how sayest thou then show us the father he's going right back to him what's the matter with you Phillip come on wake up people recognize who's in your midst recognize what God is doing in this hour recognize that that he's that you know we're going to see here because there's three things that always happen when when God is up to something big amen praise God let's go to the first the first thing next slide it will be in ways we weren't expecting don't listen you want to know what God is up to this Christmas then don't be looking in the areas where you would expect it to happen I'll tell you where it's going to happen it's going to happen in the silence oh hallelujah oh boy I just got a thought there my God we could go we could go all the way into that half hour silence right now and preach another message but let me tell you God is doing things in the silence that's why it was a silent night that's why it was a holy place because God is moving in ways that you that where where you will least expect him to move he'll do things for you over these next few days next week because of the word that's coming forth here today he will do things in your life to vindicate his word his presence his his ability in your life he did things for me you know that while I was pondering had right after I read that quote and it and it struck me about why would brother brandham say Isaiah 69 god is perfect God has a purpose in everything and R away just as I was pondering that Ding my phone went off and I looked and I read a statement and it was a brother that had sent me a statement on how God does things unexpectedly in ways that you don't understand sometimes but God is always up to something and God knows everything and I thought Oh Glory to God like I'm talking right on the second I had to text back the brother and say brother I appreciate because he sends me messages on a regular basis and I and I I had to tell him I listen I want you to know I appreciate you doing these things because because right while I was pondering on something I received my answer right there and then and that's when I went back to read Isaiah 6:9 and Drew from it another thought that God is moving in our midst that God God chose us who who am I going to send Hallelujah and send to a people and and and even it it surrounds this whole message sending to a people that that you know they're all filled up they're they're they're so filled up with knowledge their minds and everything else that they will never hear the Simplicity of God's word unless I send somebody amen you know God's using you am God's using you where you are at work at home with your children with your friends God speaks God uses you to pray for situations and he and then he he heals them he does things for you he's doing it to vindicate his presence in your life so that you can recognize what God is doing amen yes praise God forever more Hallelujah so he's doing things in ways that you will not expect him to do it and so we can ask the question what's God up to in your life what's he up to in my life what's he up to in this church listen this transition over the last year has been tremendous but extremely challenging this week was an unbelievably challenging week for me it was it was remarkable I I on on Monday or Tuesday I I did something to my back the pain was was extreme I couldn't believe what was going on I could barely walk I went to see the doctor I I got checked I got test you know I got uh corrected had to have some special uh therapy and electric shock treatment I could barely walk and then on Wednesday I was ministering the word of God I said Lord I'm in your service he said take two Tylenol and go and that's exactly what I did and I preached the message on Wednesday night and you wouldn't have known anything I I walked off the platform and I was saying thank you Lord I was feeling no like nothing the next morning I could barely walk I could barely walk I I I couldn't believe what was going on I had to go straight to the chiroprac tror get it done all that stuff and then all day Thursday I was in pain I was taking Tylenol and it felt like it got worse but that's how the enemy works by Friday morning I woke up I was feeling a little better but it was still there but I was trusting God because Saints listen we got it we got to we got to lift out of this Dimension here stuff is going to happen the enemy is going to attack mental oppression is going to attack he's going to try to get you to disbelieve the word he'll do anything he'll attack you in areas where you least expect it and you wonder sometime why would he attack through that Avenue because Satan has no respector of persons but God is watching your attitude amen God Is Watching what you're thinking yesterday I was feeling a little better was probably at 75% this morning I woke up and I was at 98% now I can bend I can move I can do whatever I got because God I claimed my healing it's done it's finished on Friday I had a thought in my mind saying boy you've really done something this time you know this time you you know no no no I said no he's still a Healer he's still the same yesterday today and forever he listen that same devil will come and attack you over and over and over and all you got to do is resist him over and over and over until God proves his word god it God is not a liar God Will Never Never back down from his word that's how we that's the kind of relationship he wants us to have with him doesn't matter how often it keeps coming back you send it right back to Hell from where it came from Hallelujah God is obligated to his word he's not obligated to you and and and and and he's watching your testimony he's watching he's listening he's paying attention to your testimony because your testimony is showing your character yes amen that's what it shows God wants character in this hour amen praise God and so in the events of Jesus's birth and life while he was here on Earth in his human form we can get a lot of indications of what he's like and how to expect listen first it'll come in ways we're not expecting it will be in ways we weren't expecting surprising even St startling the Messiah is born in a burn imagine in a cave born with with with with farm animals around him using swaddling cloths they would have never ever expected that the Messiah the king of glory would come in that way that he would come to peasants From Galilee and then when he when he's born he announces it to Outcast shepherds in the field they're they're they're they're the lowly people they're they're out there with sheep you know raising sheep they're not very smart you know they're they're just allowing sheep to follow them and and it just shows the humility and the character of God that's what it shows amen because a Shepherd a real Shepherd loves his sheep and wants nothing but good for his Sheep amen Hallelujah because that's the character of God that's what he's placed within a true servant a true minister of God will only have one desire for the people for the Deliverance of the people amen that's what he was showing don't expect God to work only in ways that you're already familiar with because he often comes to us in unexpected ways through unexpected means just when we think we figured him out he pulls another one and he does something that you didn't expect I want you to be under the right expectation this Christmas I want you to see gifts and things happen and come into your life like never before that experience with Jesus Christ just think about how he came to Earth for centuries Israel had waited for a political Messiah they're looking for for politics the m Messiah is not in politics the only political God or Messiah that we will experience is when the government is upon his shoulders like we read he's taking over he's just preparing the governers right now you know all this political system where do you think it all came from it comes from God but it's all perverted because Satan is the one that's the god of the political systems of this day and we know that because Jesus when he went into the 40 days of Wilder of of of the Temptation in the wilderness it was Satan that offered him the kingdoms of the world and said they're all mine I will give them to you if you worship me and God said get behind me you've only got a time and a season that's it and we know the time and the season we know the hour we know that the that that the government will be upon his shoulders we know that he's preparing the rest of the body positionally placing each and every one of his sons and daughters for the millennial Reign amen praise God hallelujah so they expected a political Messiah don't be looking for God in politics God is intervening in the politics God will allow certain aspects of the politics to come into line with his prophecies that's what we need to look at anything that we look at that that relates to government we need to look at how it relates to the word in in line with God's prophecy amen praise God glory to God they expected him to lead a rebellion when he came to the Earth they were trying to all the zealots were were trying to get him to come together and say hey we've got to we've got to turn uh we got to set up a a a coup here we got to we got to get things together so that we can take over the government we've got the king the king of glory has come and he'll just he'll just speak and things will change they were looking for the kingdom to come and the only ones that actually recognized that the kingdom had come were those that followed him a a dozen individuals and they would ask him Lord when will the Kingdom Come where is the king Kingdom and then he looked to them and he says the kingdom is within you he was giving them a prophecy yes of the future that there would be a kingdom that there would be a government that that that he would be ruler over that government and that you would be a part of that Kingdom that you would be in that Kingdom Glory to God everything that he said was astounding if you look and read and a lot the Holy Spirit but how did the Messiah make his entrance into the world he came in a way that made it easy for his own people to reject him God always does things even amongst your own families here you are you're you know you're so filled with the word of God you can't get enough of the word of God and your own families and your friends are looking at you and they're wondering what in the world is he so excited about what do they like come on it's just Christmas and you're and you're and you're breaking you know yesterday I was on the phone with a friend and we started talking about Christmas and we started breaking into you know uh the the real meaning of Christmas you know he caught me right when I'm when I'm studying look out man you don't call a preacher when he's studying you're going to get you're going to hear the word thank you Jesus all of a sudden got in you know the real meaning of Christmas you know you know that Jesus you know that they don't even understand Jesus is the it is is Christmas you know when Jesus and I started to get into you know how Jesus when he was on the earth and he was amongst his disciples and here he was he was God the Creator and he asked his disciple Peter and I got into the scripture and you know all of a sudden things changed right away well you know what it's not that but but but you see as soon as you start to break into Revelation right away a distraction came on the scene he had to leave he had he had another important call coming through of course thank you Jesus right but this is but this is the this is what happens when when when the word starts to want to express itself the real word and all you're doing is is you're you're quoting scripture you're just telling them baptism in Jesus name exactly how you know 8,000 people were baptized in the book of Acts all in the exact same way you show them the scriptures acts 238 Acts 19 all the scriptures you show them and and and it's like while you're talking to them you can see their eyes closing and you're wondering wow look at that right away the enemy's right there trying to shut their understanding shut their eyes thinking that that that by shutting their eyes he's going to not allow them to see the word are you kidding me when a true attribute or a son of God or a daughter of God this word flashes before them just once something strikes them on the inside you can't explain it you don't understand it you just know that something was just revealed to you that that just went beyond normal understanding I I'm seeing something I don't know why I'm seeing it I don't even know why I'm believing it but I believe it you see a True Believer a true son or daughter of God they believe then they see amen what you mean this saying that I'll believe it when I see it there's zero Faith there zero an attribute son or daughter of God they'll see it first they'll they'll they'll they'll they'll believe it first sorry they'll believe it first because something is revealed in their heart they don't even know how to explain it because Revelation can never be explained Revelation is reveal revealed that's why it's Revelation revealed okay you can't explain Revelation it's just boom it's in your heart that's why Jesus said when he looked to Peter and Peter said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God the Messiah I I'll expound on it the one that we were waiting on the word made flesh the word come to redeem his own to reconcile the world to himself you are the Messiah and Jesus look he says flesh and blood has not revealed this to you you didn't get this from your teacher your priest your pastor or your friends or your mommy or your daddy I revealed it directly from my mind directly into your heart and now you you there ain't any gate in hell that's going to that's going to Prevail against that thing it's locked in there I open no man shuts he says I shut no man can open glory to God this is the true church amen this is how the how how Christmas becomes a reality to the people of God amen glory to God he came in a way that they that it made it easy for his own people to reject him he came as a frail baby born in a feeding room for Animals there he was the promised Messiah who was expected to overthrow the mighty Roman Empire and set Israel free from the Gentile oppression of the Romans a needy Nazarene baby born BN in a Manger but it was God the Messiah coming in an an unexpected way he grew up in a despised city of Nazareth can anything good come out of Nazareth they said when they heard Joseph had a son and his son is the Messiah are you kidding me you mean Joseph the son of so and so is saying that he's a Son of God Deborah saying I am a daughter of the Living God simple people filled with the spirit of God yet the people see them they see their weaknesses they see their their their their their their strengths but yet they claim to be Children of the most high God yes and they look and they wonder how could this be they come from a family of Fighters they come from the are you kidding me the father was a drunk doesn't even know who his real mother is and claiming to be a son yes because he comes in ways that are unexpected and you need to look back and and and and not look back on people's pasts and identify them by their past and when I say past I mean even last week too many people are holding on to things because they got hurt 17 years ago and poor me and I'll never forgive this person I'll never trust this person shame on you that the word of of God the word of life has liberated you from a life of sin and unbelief every one of us were adulterers amen you didn't have to commit adultery to be an adulteress all you had to do was think it in your mind and whatsoever a Man how he thinketh in his heart he's already committed Jesus himself said even if you look upon a woman and to lust after her you're committing adultery how you going to escape something like that thank God he says Justified he came to take that all of that that's why all of that unbelief all of those mistakes all of those things that they did to you in the past all of those things when you've really truly placed them under the blood there is no way God even remembers it and why are you remembering it and living a miserable existence you choose that you choose to live that way go ahead live that way let me know when you want to be free so that you can live this life Victorious as a son or daughter of God knowing that God has giving you a future that breaks beyond all of that unbelief and all of those things that are holding you back from being what God wants you to be Hallelujah glory to God despised and oppressed but here I want you to notice let's go to the scripture the next the next slide here in in Luke 7: 34- 38 I want you to see how Jesus reacted how Jesus moved on Earth he came in unexpected way you would have thought maybe he's going to go right to the high priest's church and tell them I'm here that's not the way he comes he was moving amongst the common people listen the son of man is come eating and drinking look at and ye say Behold a gluttonous man and a wine Biber a friend of publicans and sinners but wisdom is Justified of all her children and one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to eat Jesus wants to come into the average ordinary home whether rich or poor if he is welcome he'll come that's all he's looking for because he's he's looking for his own and they're scattered they're in churches over here they're mixed up over there they're in New Age movement over here don't ever think for one minute that God cannot still call he's still calling amen they're they wherever they might be God is calling them out am and here he decides I'm going to go into into the Pharisees house the ones that were that were rejecting him mocking him calling him a heretic all kinds of stuff but he gets he gets invited by a Pharisee he'll come don't be afraid to go into anybody's home go in there and let the word shine let the light shine out of your life you can never be any more than who you actually are just be yourself and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner okay we were all Sinners amen don't be looking for uh you know nice clean tuna to bring into the church don't worry how they look how they smell what kind of a past they might have let the Holy Spirit deal with their lives and deliver them and set them free she was a prostitute and she she she heard that he was there and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner which she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisees hot in house she brought an alabaster box of ointment amen and and in that box were expensive ointments that she would use yes because it was her business the most expensive ointments and stood At His Feet behind him weeping amen she recognized that she was not living right she realized that there was hope for her if she could get to Jesus if she could just go there and do anything for him just just to catch his attention just for a moment and she was weeping and began to wash his feet with her tears because they didn't offer to wash his feet when he came in if you go on and you read the whole story you know and and began to wash his feet with her tears and did wipe them with her hair and her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment she recognized that he was royalty that he was the Messiah and yet she was a prostitute she was a sinner she knew that her life was no good but something was revealed to her and you will go on and if you read go on and read the rest of this story Jesus will tell them I came in you didn't even wash my feet but this woman this woman who who was living a life much cleaner than your lives oh my much much much no your lives are much cleaner than her life her her life was a total you you Stone her you'd stoned that woman but yet she came and washed my feet with her tears of repentance and then Jesus turned and said go and sin no more your sins are forgiven that's what God does for us that's what he can do for any one of us I don't care the circumstance I don't care the what what's going on in your life if you can just get a hold of of the Hem of His Garment just like that woman that that heard that Jesus was in the crowd and she had a blood issue she had been bleeding since she was a young woman couldn't stop the bleeding but she knew that if she could just Touch the Hem of His Garment and meanwhile here there was thousands of people and she touched his hem and he stopped and said whoa who touched me meanwhile though everybody had hands on they were all touching him but something was represented in her she had represented she had representation that was one of my own that's what struck him there's one of my own boom and right there and then there was a deep call to the deep and she responded by the manifestation of a complete and total healing in her body he does things in unexpected ways Hallelujah let's go to John 20 Mary I want I want you to see something here oh yeah here we go reboot on the computer okay yeah so here in John 20 13- 15 I want to read this and I want to draw from this a very very interesting scenario on how God communicates with his own now remember Jesus was in his public Ministry and he had just gone to the Cross gave up his life for us they buried him into the tomb and now Mary is going to the tomb to go and anoint him with oil she wants to get to the body and here but Mary stood without at the supper weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the seler to find his body and seeth two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet and she says Where and and where like where where the body of Jesus had laid and they say unto her woman why weepest thou she saith unto them because they have taken away my Lord and I know know not where they have laid him she had come to anoint the body she wanted to do something with the body of Christ and when she had said thus she turned herself back and saw Jesus standing now it's telling us that she saw Jesus standing but she didn't know it was Jesus and knew not that it was Jesus now how could she not know that it was Jesus because he had been with her he had been with them because he had left his public Ministry he had gone from being the the the the physical Jesus on Earth that was speaking to the crowds and doing the Miracles and now he had moved on to the next stage of his ministry his ministry of redemption had now started and it was no longer going to be a public Ministry a lot of the churches out there they're having Christmas services this morning they're replaying the manger uh scene they're they're they're talking about how Jesus came as a baby they're they're talking about the Christmas story but yet they don't realize that he's no longer in a public Ministry he has moved from a public Ministry to where he is dealing with individuals Hallelujah he is calling his sons and his daughters personally now look what look look what happens here Jesus she didn't know that it was him Jesus saith unto Heroman why weepest thou whom seek thou she supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him sir if thou has borne him hence tell me where thou H has laid him and I will take him away she just she's still looking for the body she didn't realize what was actually taking place but go to the next slide but then in in 16 and 17 Jesus saith unto her Mary all of a sudden he speaks her name and look she turned herself and saith unto him raboni in other words Master she knew right there and then that it was him why all of a sudden did she know it was him because my sheep hear my voice hallah when I call them they will respond all that the father hath given me will come he was he was calling her by her real name it wasn't Mary so much Mary it was that she had representation with him and now he was moving into the ministry where he was going to call individuals one by one by one and Jesus saith unto her touch me not for I am not yet ascended to the father but go to my brethren and say unto them I Ascend unto my father and your father and to my God and your God oh my he was telling her listen The Plan of Redemption is on I'm here now to redeem my own I've come back to to to reverse the curse glory to God Eve fell in the Garden of Eden but I've got a wife that I've prepared for me in these last days she will not fall amen she will know my voice she will recognize my voice and she will respond to my voice and this is the hour that we're now moving in it's a it's it's a time of Silence to many when they look at us they're wondering and they're pondering what's God up to what's he doing in their lives this is strange glory to God Amen it's an hour where we need to understand that that that God is is supernaturally interceding into your personal lives and when he called me 30 years ago it seems like a long time it seems like so many years but yet it seems like just yesterday because his word is still alive today like it was 30 years ago when he when when he called my name I didn't understand he was calling my name out of a life of drug abuse and and and a and a life that was going straight to hell I had no idea but supernaturally I heard his voice and you know what I'm talking about you know the difference amen praise God it's a totally different experience it's a totally different walk Hallelujah let's look at the next slide number two it will be in places and among people where we weren't expecting I had no idea when my partner says hey Dan you got to go see this guy Gabriel he's a good Furniture maker my wife deals with him go there he's going to give you a deal I had no idea I said I'm okay I'm looking to save money I'm not going there to see Jesus or or or or hear anything about a prophet or anything else I'm going to save money and I'm going to go look at this guy's furniture and make sure it's good and it was good and I was very grateful that day and I said man this is a great deal he gave me such a deal God anointed him Hallelujah to give me a deal that would get me stirred up to ask him are you satisfied with this because a good deal I understood what a good deal was I was in business a good deal when I go down to the food terminal and they're asking $20 a case on strawberries and I hit them on Friday afternoon and I say I'll give you seven bucks and they go give me nine I'll give you eight okay Danny I just got a great deal okay I know a good deal but they were going to throw them out if I didn't give them the eight bucks so it was a great deal for them and a good deal for me and and that's when I said brother that's a good deal I didn't call him brother I said man that's a good deal and little did I know he's going to hand me a tape that's going to transform and change my life down the road I had no idea but he came in a very strange Place unexpected just had no idea that that that something like that was going to actually start out and here I leave my sunglasses at the doughnut shop because God said no not enough you need to go back and get more God was working and he was moving quickly I went back and now he doesn't give me a tape he gives me a whole box of tapes hallelujah praise God just simple uh you know simple but God supernaturally doing things that that we had no idea we didn't we didn't know where to expect it to happen how it was going to happen amen praise God we're almost there you see how long it's taken for my computer to boot up out of nowhere just shut off plugged in everything why something's happening God's up to something God wants to speak to somebody God's revealing things setting free liberating listen this is what church is all about Saints we're not we're not into traditional Church oh it's a Christmas service this is not just a regular Christmas service this is where we come because Jesus was here before we got here amen he's meeting with us because he wants to be with us he wants to meet with us he wants to fellowship with us he wants to uh anoint the word of God so that we can receive what we have need of in this day and in this hour amen praise God hallelujah and so in in this we recognize that he's going to bring us amongst people that we didn't even know you you might come into this church and you're going to wonder who are all these people man it's like the United Nations in here they got they got the United Nations going to this church you know but what is it because God has no color God doesn't look at skin God doesn't look at a rich poor God's not looking at any of that God's looking at his word God's looking to see if you can receive and respond to his word because if you're if you a if you're able to respond to the word then God's going to use you God's going to move into your life God's going to take out of your life whatever needs to be moved out I went through a complete Rehabilitation of my entire family home business life physical everything all in a very short period of time almost to the point where that's why I was so mesmerized that that I had come into into contact with something that was so much greater than anything that I could have ever done and when you truly come into a relationship with God and you just humble yourself and you wait on the Lord he'll do things in your life that you'll know for sure listen God doesn't play games I'll tell you right now amen okay Jes he does not play games he'll do it and you'll know it it's as simple as that he'll do it and you'll know it because when he's calling and he's got a work for you to do and he's got something that includes you into the body of Christ right here if it's the local body here at Good Neighbor Ministry and God needs you in here and God's working on your life get ready there's going to be an earthquake around your life but when everything Quakes away the word of God is going to be solid and it's going to be a rock that you'll be standing on in the midst of it all it's like the parable that says the man that that built his house upon a rock while Jesus Christ is building his house right now the True Body the the the the mystical Body of Christ and he has placed her upon the word of God Amen H Allelujah so let's let's move along here I just want to so so uh number two was that he will he will show up and do things in places that are unexpected and where you least expect him to do it amen praise God hallelujah he says here listen when when he does those things in those unexpected ways Isaiah 4318 says forget the former things I'm telling you now when you see God moving in your life and you see listen you're here this morning I don't know if you've noticed if there's water if if the water is moving this morning in the house of the Lord I'm telling you to jump in you know that was The Bu the the the the the pool of of Bethesda where where you know once in a while the angel would come down and stir the waters and and there would be lame people there would be people waiting around just watching that water watching because they got a situation they're listen they're they they got financial needs they got they got a son or a daughter that's that's out in the world that that that that's living wrong and and and needs to to come and and get set free there's there's heavy burdens on their hearts and the minute that that water stirred they jump into the water the first one in would receive the blessing and the and the desire of their heart and if you're hearing something this morning in the water stirring up a little bit don't just sit there you jump in you you say yes Lord that's me I need that father I need that Deliverance I want that Christmas gift this year I want to know what you're up to in my my life amen praise God glory to God he says in Isaiah 43 forget the former things do not dwell on the past behold I am doing a new thing glory to God now it Springs up do not do do you not perceive it I am making a way in the desert and streams in the Wasteland God always back beckons to us from the future not the past amen drawing us into new things that he is doing Hall amen so so get pulled into uh this Christmas let the Holy Spirit pull you into his plans for you let him pull you into his gifts what he's got planned for you amen glory to God praise God Amen and so he'll do things in those kinds of ways third let's go to the next slide it will be bigger than we were expecting Ing and we're going to wind it down here and then we're going to we're going to break into this next week in a in a in a wonderful way so you can come next week under great expectation because this is only just the foundation that's being laid in here today I believe that we're going to be blessed it will be bigger than you were expecting maybe not at first babies are pretty small but Jesus's birth fit with the way he said the father always works a mustard seed is the smallest of all seeds but when it matures it becomes the largest of all garden plants did you know that so that the birds can come and nested its branches a tiny plant so that the birds can come among amount of and and a tiny amount of yeast Works its way through the whole lump of dough and the smallest Good Deed will not go unnoticed in the kingdom of God simple acts of kindness or a cup of cold water given to one in need God does things and does them beyond your expectations now he does things that are much bigger than what you were expecting I believe I believe this Christmas God wants to do something wonderful for you personally amen praise God put yourself under that kind of expectation glory to God the eventual impact of the king om of God will be world changing for you your world will completely change as a result of this the Angel's word to the shepherd was fear not for I bring you good news this is good news this this message this Christmas message this week is good news Saints it can set you free it can liberate you it can break the chains of the enemy whatever it is that's holding you back from having the peace and the joy you know that when you when you allow yourself to move into Joy you know it takes an effort sometimes you got to break out of that that that that stubborn spirit that wants to you know wants to bring you down and you got to start speaking positive and you got to start expressing Joy I feel the joy of the Lord amen I I I I'm the luckiest person on Earth I don't care what they say about me I believe God's report God says that you are you are more precious to me that you're you're the whole all of Heaven rejoices when one of my children repents and comes to me all of Heaven rejoices that's what the scripture says why wouldn't you be the happiest person why would you allow the joy of the Lord because when the joy comes in guess what just like Superman when he gets into the sun all of a sudden the muscles start to pop boom boom boom boom boom the strength starts to come the Kryptonite is the enemy The Devil comes and tells you you're no good look it's all your fault you did this that's Kryptonite and you listen to that kryptonite all your muscles start to get weak that's why a person in fear they just melt but somebody that has the fear of God the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom the Bible says you've surrendered your life it's a fearful thing you got to let go of all these things from the past yeah you do all the former things you got to let go of them that will show and prove whether you really believe that God can do something in your life you need to let go of everything so that God can be everything and that he can bring you to a place and don't worry you're not going to just be some some uh you know uh puppet for God no no when God brings you into your rightful position you become a warrior you become stronger than you ever were you you become more confident I'm not talking about Pride confidence because you humble yourself before the Lord and God will lift you up God will fight your battles the children of Israel they knew that God was on their side that's why when David went and stood before Goliath he didn't go standing there in his own Pride I can do this I can do that he turned and told Goliath very clearly you come to you come to me today and to the children of Israel with your own strength and you're 14 feet tall and your big long sword and you and you yeah you've had a lot of Victories and sure you've had a lot of Victories but you're all puffed up on yourself but you've met your challenge today Satan because I don't come to you with my own ability I got a life that I'm ashamed of as a matter of fact to be honest with you okay my past has got no strength I got no I got no victories that I can use but I come to you today in the name of the Lord God of Israel I come to you in the name of Jesus Christ Satan I don't come to you with my own ability my own power I got no ability I've got no power but I've got him on my side and in the name of Jesus Christ every knee shall bow and confess that Jesus Christ is Lord and then all of a sudden you start to notice things falling away from your life God taking this right out of your life you thought you had to go fight the battle it was already taken care of before you even got there he'll be one step ahead of you he will know exactly what you have need of Hallelujah glory to God Amen no fear my people for I bring good news of great Joy which will be for all people anybody can listen he went into any house where he was welcome just like us we will go to any place that we are welcome and we will tell the truth hallelujah it'll be greater than anything and there's a Great Awakening as we wind this down right now and we prepare for next week There's a great Awakening taking place right now in the true church something greater than has ever ever happened ever before this time brother Danny what are you saying I'm telling you that something greater than has ever ever taken place on this Earth up until this time is in progress right now God is up to something big and we got to put ourselves under the right expectation so that we can catch the revelation of what he's doing amen it's all happening and in a way that we will learn from the scriptures that we continue to look into as we move forward let's just go to the last couple scriptures here I want to finish off with these few scriptures from John chapter 14 we started John 14 from verse 6 but Jesus now says believest Thou not that I am in the father and the father in me and the works that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works see Jesus had come into a realization that God was in him believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work sake he was trying to convey to them hey this is so much bigger than what you think you want to take out a Roman army I'm not I'm not here to take out a Roman army I'm here to bring my plan of perfect peace and and and a and a reign with my family with my wife with with with a kingdom where there will be no heartache no sorrow there will be no more pain there will be no more tears he had such a greater plan that went above the the the the the plan that even you might have here this morning God's got something so much greater for us he says here believe me that I am in the father you and me and the father is in me or else believe the very Works he's saying look didn't you see the supernatural verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I sh that I do shall he do also now he's trying to show them that hey not only is this about me this is also about you you've got a great part to play in this great plan that I've that I've set out from before the foundations of the world he says and Greater Works imagine he had raised the dead he had opened the blinded eyes he had stopped the blood issues he had calmed the sea when he just said peace be still and the waters just obeyed him he said greater than these shall you do listen let me tell you something somebody could walk into this church the doctor gives them a week to live bring them to the front of the church get the Elders of the church together anoint him with oil pray over the individual a week later he goes and has a test the doctor says we don't understand there's no explanation the cancer is no longer there two weeks later the person that was here got so excited Ed he wanted to go throw a party with all his buddies and goes to the bar and gets drunk and forgets about church what good is the healing the Greater Works is when you can testify of God's goodness in somebody's life that's it God transforms their life takes away the sin takes away the cancer and then you see that life completely yielded and surrendered and given unto God for the rest of their days they serve God with all of their heart they show the manifestation of God's purpose God's purpose in their life being called being brought into the mystical Body of Christ that is the Greater Works there is no greater than that when you see a life that's been transformed from a life of total unbelief to where they come and they say Lord You Are My Savior You Are My Savior listen healing of the body is only a down payment of your salvation which is going to be the total healing of your soul right glory to God hallelujah he says Greater Works than the shall he do because I go unto my father and in John 14:13 and whatsoever ye shall ask listen here now this is where you can you you know this this Rel relationship takes time you got to build the relationship he says whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son God wants to do Miracles God wants to change your life if you shall seek anything ask anything in my name I will do it he's not a liar you try him you test him he says if you love me keep my Commandments now he's not talking about where you got to go and you got to keep all the Ten Commandments th this thou that th that that's all under the law and I'm not saying that you go out and break the Commandments that's not what he's saying either it's by grace that you're saved you're not saved by keeping the law there's a lot of people that can be a lot more religious and a lot holier than you but it's not a holy person it's the holy ghost in the person that's what changes your life don't you be trying to change your own life let the Holy Spirit come in ask in his name and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth that's the thing that we're talking about that's what we need to come into contact with the spirit of truth because once the spirit of Truth gets in you you will respond to the word of God you will say Amen to the baptism in Jesus name you will say Amen to the father Son and Holy Ghost and all three are the one same individual just condescending down into his Plan of Redemption amen glory to God he says and and and he says here he'll give you that comforter even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive Bingo yes sir so you're wondering oh well I'm going to receive this oh my God my life's going to be transformed everything's going to change every everything's going to be good nope you're going to get attacked the people that you most love are probably going to be the first ones they're going to say you need to leave that church you need to get away from those people they're they're they're they're zealots they're a little bit too excited about God yeah get excited about World War III then go ahead okay get excited about what's going on in the Middle East and get excited about what's going on in Ukraine get excited about a government that's ripping apart right here in Canada they don't even know who their leader is they look at one you look at the other you say oh my God Curly Larry and mo which one do you go with how do you know you need Jesus Christ to have the government upon his shoulders and you need him in your life to put order into your life amen praise God the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not they can't see it because unto you it's been given but unto them Jesus said it's not given oh but that's unfair no it's not it's the word I can't tell you why I can see you can't tell me why you can see but you can see so praise God that you can see thank God that you can see pray for them that cannot see neither knoweth him because ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be what in you in you let the musicians come he says here in verse 18 I will not leave you comfortless don't be afraid to let him in Don't Be Afraid let him in he says I'll not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you you see me because I live you shall live also and that day ye shall know that I am in the father and ye in me and I in you oh next week we're going to be looking a little deeper into I in you change is coming Saints Christmas is going to be different this year
