[0:15] oh
[0:15] happy day oh happy day
[0:19] i say it was a happy day when i
[0:22] fixed my choice in jesus christ
[0:27] happy day when he washed my sins away
[0:31] thank god we're happy to be here today
[0:34] for his glory and honor may the lord
[0:37] jesus christ
[0:38] bless you in a marvelous and
[0:42] wonderful way tonight as we look into
[0:46] our
[0:47] marvelous uh bible study
[0:50] of the seven church ages i am now
[0:54] dealing with the subject of
[0:58] chosen in him
[1:02] chosen in him our scripture is
[1:05] found in john chapter 6 verses 37
[1:11] and verse 44
[1:14] which reads thus all that the father had
[1:19] given
[1:21] me shall come to me
[1:25] and him that commit to me
[1:28] i will in no wise cast out
[1:34] no man can come to me
[1:39] except the father which hath sent
[1:42] me draw him
[1:46] and i will raise him up
[1:50] at the last day our gracious
[1:54] god and heavenly father
[1:57] there we have given the reading of thy
[2:00] word which we know faith cometh by
[2:04] hearing
[2:06] and hearing or understanding comes
[2:09] by the word of god
[2:12] oh may the great holy spirit
[2:16] move once again over the waters
[2:20] of the word and may life come forth from
[2:24] the word
[2:25] lord may creation come forth from the
[2:29] word lord
[2:30] may the eyes of the heart be opened
[2:33] to your glory and lord
[2:37] jesus may blinded eyes
[2:41] may deaf heirs open
[2:44] in the name of jesus and may the great
[2:48] holy
[2:49] spirit receive all the praise the honor
[2:52] and the glory
[2:54] this great teacher in the name of jesus
[2:58] christ
[2:59] amen and amen
[3:04] the scripture we read makes it quite
[3:06] plain
[3:09] that it's the lord jesus christ himself
[3:14] that does the choosing
[3:17] i have often referred to the
[3:20] old pentecostal hymn which
[3:24] we used to sing i took
[3:27] jesus as my savior you take him too
[3:32] you take him too you
[3:35] take him too i took
[3:39] jesus as my savior you take him too
[3:44] well that song was wonderful
[3:47] we love to sing it rejoicing
[3:51] but in actual fact the bible says
[3:55] you don't take him you don't
[3:58] choose him but he said
[4:01] clearly in the word of god
[4:04] i have chosen you
[4:09] you have not chosen me
[4:13] but i have chosen you
[4:17] listen to the word of god but as many as
[4:20] received him
[4:21] to them gave he the power to become the
[4:25] sons of god
[4:27] even as many as believed in on his name
[4:31] which were born not of blood not of
[4:34] just human blood nor of the will
[4:38] of flesh nor of the
[4:42] will of man but they're born
[4:46] but of god if clearly
[4:50] in the word of god ephesians 1 4-5
[4:55] according as he had chosen
[4:59] us in him
[5:03] before the foundation of the world
[5:07] that we would be holy and without
[5:10] blame before
[5:14] him in love
[5:18] being predestinated onto the adoption of
[5:22] children
[5:24] by jesus christ to himself
[5:27] according to the good pleasure
[5:30] of his will praise
[5:33] god now clearly we can see
[5:39] that in the choosing of a bride
[5:43] it is not the woman that goes
[5:47] out and
[5:50] chooses the man like any
[5:53] natural man the natural
[5:56] man or ordinary man chooses
[6:00] the woman in his mind in his
[6:04] heart by his secret
[6:07] choice before she
[6:10] knows that she
[6:14] has even been chosen
[6:17] or that she was even loved
[6:21] and chosen in the mind and heart
[6:25] of god of this man
[6:28] and so were the true beloved of god
[6:32] the true saints children of god
[6:36] wife of god were in his mind in his
[6:40] thoughts
[6:41] and in his divine choice
[6:44] before we consciously knew it
[6:48] that we needed the lord we needed a
[6:50] savior and so on
[6:53] and that we should then love him
[6:56] because he died on calvary
[7:00] we love him because he first loved us
[7:04] he chose us before the foundation
[7:08] of the world praise god a bride doesn't
[7:12] simply
[7:13] go out there and look at the various men
[7:16] and
[7:17] select them and said well that's the one
[7:22] that they're going to marry and choose
[7:24] him
[7:25] amen but the man chooses
[7:30] who he will marry and god
[7:34] made that choice himself
[7:37] you say about brother simon why do i
[7:39] have to repent of my sins
[7:42] why do i have to accept jesus christ as
[7:45] my savior
[7:46] well there it is he makes the choice
[7:51] but he still has to approach you
[7:54] like any man would have to approach the
[7:56] woman
[7:58] and then that woman will
[8:02] now have the glorious opportunity
[8:06] of accepting or rejecting
[8:11] that man's choice hopefully
[8:14] in the word of god
[8:18] and for jesus christ that we
[8:21] will make jesus our choice
[8:24] hallelujah glory to god but we
[8:28] do have a choice
[8:31] and the choice isn't accepting him
[8:35] or rejecting him but the original
[8:40] choice and choosing is
[8:43] not determined by uri
[8:47] that was determined by the very
[8:50] heart of god ephesians 1 9
[8:54] says that that choosing he purposed
[8:59] he determined within himself
[9:02] can you imagine the lord had determined
[9:05] that he would have
[9:06] you as his bride that he would receive
[9:10] us and draw us attract us
[9:14] to his word by the holy
[9:17] spirit attracting us
[9:20] to the word of god it is in
[9:24] the word of god we read
[9:28] in romans 9 11
[9:31] that the purpose of god
[9:35] by election might stand
[9:38] hallelujah god's heart purpose his
[9:42] eternal purpose
[9:45] was to choose you and i
[9:48] to be his bride
[9:51] before the foundation of the world
[9:55] and that purpose he had already purposed
[9:59] in himself in other words god would
[10:03] take a bride of his own
[10:06] choosing that was
[10:09] and decree that in his heart
[10:13] before the foundation of the world
[10:17] praise god
[10:19] now i want you to notice clearly
[10:23] that god did not choose
[10:27] a parrot or a monkey
[10:32] or some animal to be
[10:35] his bride or his wife
[10:38] he did not choose a chimpanzee
[10:42] that to be his wife
[10:46] but as he said in genesis 1 every seed
[10:50] will bring forth after its kind
[10:55] so god should chose a wife
[10:59] after his kind well
[11:03] god himself being eternal
[11:06] he could not choose a wife of time or
[11:09] that was born in time he had to choose
[11:15] a wife that has the same
[11:19] qualities as he has
[11:22] the same eternal qualities
[11:25] and so that bride that he
[11:28] or wife that god chose had to be
[11:32] eternal as he is
[11:35] eternal and being eternal
[11:40] she was a part of him
[11:44] for a man and his thoughts are one
[11:48] and that bride was in god's thoughts
[11:52] you see god used adam
[11:56] as a physical representation of himself
[12:01] that we as humans could have through our
[12:05] imagination our reasoning our conscience
[12:07] and so on
[12:08] a an idea
[12:12] of what actually he did
[12:15] before the foundation of the world
[12:19] now when it was time for adam
[12:22] to have a wife god did not go
[12:26] to the ground to the earth and find a
[12:29] wife for him
[12:31] or to create another being
[12:36] from a separate piece of dirt
[12:40] uh to form him but the bible tells us
[12:44] clearly
[12:46] that god took a part of
[12:50] adam a bride a rib
[12:53] of adam to be exact and
[12:56] god took that as the foundation
[13:00] for building or forming a bride a wife
[13:05] called eve for adam
[13:09] in that god was displaying
[13:12] what he did
[13:16] with himself to fulfill his divine
[13:19] purpose
[13:20] was not to find another uh
[13:24] kind of existence or being that was
[13:27] separate from him
[13:29] but he took a part of himself
[13:34] to produce
[13:38] or to make his wife manifested
[13:42] that she was a part of him
[13:45] so adam married a part of himself god
[13:49] married a part of himself
[13:51] oh praise god hallelujah
[13:54] even as adam and eve were
[13:58] one in the beginning for the bible says
[14:02] while they were standing there and he
[14:04] called
[14:05] their name adam praise
[14:09] god in the same way now in this
[14:12] last day as we receive him
[14:15] him believing and let him have glory
[14:18] within our hearts
[14:20] god looks and sees jesus christ standing
[14:23] there
[14:23] mrs jesus christ standing beside him and
[14:27] he
[14:27] calls their name together
[14:30] jesus christ hallelujah oh my god
[14:34] hallelujah
[14:35] for she is him now being revealed
[14:39] christ is the mystery of god being
[14:42] revealed
[14:43] the bride reveals him praise
[14:46] god hallelujah this great unchangeable
[14:50] god hallelujah making himself manifest
[14:53] or thank god this great doctrine
[14:58] of the manifestation of the sons
[15:02] and daughters of the living god in this
[15:06] last day praise god hallelujah
[15:09] amen praise god thank god
[15:13] that we could have been in him chosen in
[15:17] him
[15:18] and existing in him before
[15:22] the foundation of the world
[15:25] thank god god being omniscient
[15:28] omnipotent
[15:29] god being eternal god
[15:33] being all-knowing past present future
[15:37] god knows everything therefore listen
[15:40] god has never had a new
[15:44] thought thus says the prophet of god
[15:49] god has never had a new thought
[15:55] because god doesn't have to learn
[15:58] like you and i god doesn't have to take
[16:02] counsel or advice from anyone else
[16:07] he is perfection of perfection
[16:10] he is the all in all praise god
[16:15] hallelujah so the thoughts
[16:19] that he has are the thoughts that he
[16:22] always
[16:23] had amen
[16:26] so there is no new name
[16:30] or new sock going to be added on
[16:34] in glory but only
[16:37] those names that were written in his
[16:41] heart
[16:41] written in the lamb's book of
[16:45] life before the foundation of the world
[16:48] only those names my friends
[16:52] are the ones that will be uh
[16:56] drawn pulled uh or
[16:59] made aware of who they are
[17:03] by the facility of revelation
[17:06] to recognize their position
[17:11] who they really are where
[17:14] they came from and therefore
[17:17] where they came from tells to them
[17:21] that they have blessed assurance
[17:24] of where they're going back to
[17:28] in the words of jesus and come from god
[17:32] and i go back to god we come from god we
[17:36] go back to god
[17:37] we came from eternity we go back to
[17:40] eternity
[17:41] oh praise god hallelujah we came from
[17:44] the bosom of the
[17:45] father we return back to the bosom
[17:49] of our loving father and his marvelous
[17:52] wonderful grace amen oh praise god
[17:58] the thoughts of god are eternal
[18:01] just as he is eternal hallelujah
[18:05] praise god may i say that again
[18:09] the thoughts of god
[18:13] are eternal as he
[18:17] is eternal the same quality in the
[18:20] husband
[18:21] the same quality and the wife the same
[18:25] quality of being amen
[18:28] human to human god to god
[18:32] god capital g to common g o d
[18:36] and so we see the same thing
[18:41] in the great god so
[18:44] god had his thoughts about us
[18:47] about adam and about us
[18:50] as his wife but those thoughts
[18:54] were yet unexpressed
[18:57] or unmanifested there were in
[19:01] his thoughts psalm 139
[19:05] verses 15 to 16.
[19:09] my substance was not
[19:12] hid from thee when
[19:15] i was made in secret
[19:20] and curiously wrought in the lowest
[19:23] part of the earth then thine
[19:27] eyes did see my substance
[19:31] yet being unperfect
[19:35] and in thy book with all my members
[19:40] hallelujah were written
[19:43] which in continuance were
[19:46] fashioned when as yet
[19:50] there was none of them none of them
[19:52] could be seen none of them were made
[19:54] manifested
[19:55] but these were already in his
[19:59] book and we were in his mind
[20:02] before the foundation of the
[20:06] world hallelujah praise be to god before
[20:09] we were even
[20:10] formed in our mother's womb
[20:13] god knew us because we were
[20:17] in his mind before the foundations of
[20:21] the world
[20:22] and now with the new birth
[20:26] we become expressed or manifested
[20:30] children of the living god
[20:33] hallelujah praise god
[20:36] but we don't comfort all at the same
[20:39] time
[20:41] we come forth in god's predestinated
[20:45] seasons of his word we come forth
[20:49] in the fullness of time that
[20:52] god has ordained in his mind for us
[20:56] to be made manifested if i might
[20:59] i may go back a little bit some of us
[21:04] came up in the in the various ages
[21:07] of the church first second third
[21:12] fourth some came up under
[21:15] luther wesley pentecostal message
[21:19] called another step out and
[21:22] now in the last day the message of
[21:25] malachi 4 5 the 20th century
[21:30] prophet said to call out a people
[21:33] for his name and for his glory we are
[21:37] called out by the name by this wonderful
[21:41] marvelous ministry back to the word of
[21:45] god
[21:46] in this season and time
[21:50] our spiritual food came to us
[21:55] in due season when we needed it
[21:59] that it might straighten us open our
[22:02] eyes
[22:03] turn our thoughts heavenward and godward
[22:07] and for us to look into the in the
[22:11] word of god look into the
[22:16] the waters of the river of god
[22:19] see our reflections in christ
[22:23] see our real self to know who we
[22:26] are and to recognize our place
[22:30] in him here we are friends
[22:34] we were in jesus christ we were in
[22:37] elohim
[22:38] we were back there in the midst of the
[22:42] logos
[22:44] we were god's eternal thoughts parts of
[22:47] the logos
[22:48] signified acts that x24 death pentecost
[22:53] when we saw little licks of fire
[22:56] hanging above the heads of every
[22:59] one of those apostles that the people
[23:03] could recognize
[23:05] he was trying to display they were all
[23:08] once a part of that logos
[23:13] that he had now broke up a part of
[23:16] himself
[23:16] or took a part of himself and was
[23:19] now placing it in human
[23:22] bodies like he placed jesus
[23:26] or or himself in a human body
[23:29] by the name of jesus christ
[23:32] and now in our day by the revealing
[23:36] of the word by the pillar of fire on the
[23:40] word by the light
[23:41] on the word by the understanding of the
[23:44] word
[23:45] given to you by god not by study not by
[23:48] man's wisdom not by the will of man by
[23:51] the theologies of man
[23:53] but by the grace of god he makes himself
[23:56] known to you
[23:58] so real hallelujah praise god
[24:01] that you realize that you are part of
[24:04] that
[24:05] same pillar of fire
[24:08] amen and now
[24:12] you become a part of the living word
[24:16] jesus christ the same yesterday
[24:19] today and forever glory
[24:23] be to his glorious marvelous name
[24:26] think of it you were in that book
[24:30] before the foundation of the world
[24:34] we were just in him
[24:37] but now the book is being
[24:41] expressed or manifested
[24:44] let me say it i've preached on the topic
[24:47] before
[24:48] we are now made to be the manifested
[24:52] book of redemption
[24:53] in our day and time praise god
[24:57] the holy spirit empowering us moving
[25:00] upon us flowing through us declaring
[25:04] himself through us
[25:05] to do what to attract the tension of the
[25:08] rest of his body the rest of his people
[25:12] that are have not yet known who they
[25:15] are and have not recognized themselves
[25:20] have not recognized that their position
[25:22] is supposed to be in christ
[25:25] and to follow the lamb wherever he leads
[25:28] them
[25:30] listen he had chosen us
[25:34] in him amen
[25:37] before the foundation of the world
[25:40] which means we were already in his mind
[25:43] we were
[25:44] ready in his thoughts before the
[25:46] foundation
[25:47] of the world and that automatically
[25:50] gives us an eternal
[25:52] quality so
[25:56] we are not just this body
[26:00] we have given a seed hallelujah
[26:04] and that germ of god
[26:07] that attribute is eternal
[26:10] and we have that eternal quality in
[26:13] these orton vessels
[26:16] which when they drop we rise
[26:19] in the presence of the living god
[26:22] because he that liveton believeth in
[26:24] me though he were dead though he would
[26:28] appear
[26:28] physically dead yet shall he live
[26:32] praise god hallelujah then jesus said
[26:35] destroy this body
[26:37] and raise it up upon the third day lord
[26:40] of god hallelujah
[26:42] amen we are not here by human
[26:46] instrumentality maybe your physical body
[26:50] came here
[26:51] by mom and dad
[26:54] but you the being that seed
[26:58] life in you came here
[27:01] vice election god's
[27:06] election placed you here place you
[27:09] into a certain certain body using
[27:13] a certain father and mother to get you
[27:17] here
[27:18] what god is looking for his children
[27:22] you and i searching for us
[27:25] lord of god hallelujah amen
[27:28] so we must be like
[27:31] when a child is born they
[27:34] look like their parents sometimes they
[27:38] talk like their parents they act like
[27:41] their parents
[27:42] they begin to get certain peculiarities
[27:45] like their parents
[27:47] and that's the way of the true seed of
[27:49] god
[27:51] they don't have to put an act on they
[27:54] don't have to try to be a christian
[27:56] they don't have to struggle and work and
[27:59] and be
[28:00] everything to be a christian they don't
[28:02] have to take a course
[28:03] on being a christian they don't have to
[28:05] my friends
[28:06] have a a great teacher teach us how to
[28:10] act like a christian
[28:11] how to study our part so that we know
[28:14] the right script and the right words and
[28:17] and the right actions
[28:19] at the right time how to act them out
[28:21] but it
[28:23] spontaneously flows out of the true
[28:25] child of god for its automatic because
[28:29] of the life that is within them
[28:32] hallelujah
[28:33] the great holy spirit working through
[28:36] them
[28:37] the life of christ manifesting
[28:40] through them makes them true christians
[28:43] their
[28:44] life itself living out
[28:47] through them for the glory and praise
[28:50] of the living god hallelujah amen
[28:54] they came out of egypt
[28:57] two million of them but when they
[29:01] got to the promised land only two from
[29:04] the original group
[29:05] joshua and caleb really made it over
[29:09] on the other side you say oh brother
[29:12] sign them there
[29:13] lots of them went over yes but they were
[29:16] the
[29:17] generation that was born in the
[29:19] wilderness
[29:20] the only original two
[29:24] ones that were originally out of
[29:28] egypt in the journey of canaan
[29:32] was joshua and caleb one
[29:36] in a million and he even saw in the
[29:39] natural
[29:40] process of god of selection
[29:43] with the sperm and the egg
[29:47] amen a million
[29:50] sperms may go forth but god
[29:54] ordained only one to unite with that egg
[29:58] to bring forth a natural life
[30:01] and so is it with the spiritual life
[30:05] one in a million god ordained his

[32:59] a
[33:01] promised seed or could not
[33:05] manifest that seed
[33:08] to prove that it is the child of the
[33:11] promise
[33:12] oh glory to god hallelujah the
[33:15] revelation of the
[33:16] spoken word to the individual my friends
[33:20] is the very vindication identification
[33:24] of who they are they come from the
[33:26] presence of
[33:27] god and they're going back to the
[33:29] presence of god
[33:31] hallelujah oh what a marvelous and
[33:34] glorious time

[33:39] that i am a child of the king oh
[33:42] blessed be his holy name the choosing of
[33:46] god
[33:48] the election of god then they are
[33:52] a piece or part of jesus christ
[33:56] the royal seed of god
[34:00] the elect the predestinated
[34:03] the foreknown of god that were in the
[34:07] mind of god
[34:09] that were his thoughts amen
[34:13] in plain language
[34:16] they are the true bride of jesus christ
[34:20] for they are a part of he himself
[34:24] if you want to say they're a part of his
[34:26] spiritual
[34:28] rib that has come forth from him
[34:31] to be made manifested upon
[34:35] the face of the earth and thus the bride
[34:38] is the literal spoken
[34:42] word seed bride of jesus christ
[34:48] she may appear to be feminine
[34:51] in her designation but remember
[34:55] him being the head the bible calls
[34:58] her his body
[35:02] so she is his body
[35:05] literally let's say it this way she is
[35:09] him in a many membered
[35:12] body she expresses him
[35:16] in many children she
[35:20] makes him manifested through
[35:23] this many member body through
[35:26] this these seven church ages
[35:29] and now in this age she is made
[35:33] manifested through the sons and
[35:35] daughters
[35:36] of the living god oh hallelujah
[35:40] amen so she is the son of man
[35:46] being revealed again revealed in bible
[35:50] days in the new testament
[35:52] and now he is being revealed again
[35:55] in the form of his wife
[35:59] in the form of a bride
[36:02] a bridefall but is still him
[36:06] making himself known aren't you blessed

[36:10] or do you rejoice at this i rejoice in
[36:14] christ my
[36:14] savior to know the marvelous
[36:17] mystery of god making itself clear
[36:21] and making himself known our father
[36:25] making himself manifested in the flesh
[36:28] of jesus christ
[36:31] and in him the scripture says
[36:34] was the fullness of the
[36:38] function head all the waters from the
[36:41] fountain
[36:42] or he is the fullness of the godhead
[36:46] bodily the godhead in a body
[36:50] oh blessed be the name of the living god
[36:53] hallelujah
[36:54] glory to his name so here is the with
[36:57] him
[36:57] the great one jesus christ
[37:00] while he was in the one body
[37:04] god himself took the title of
[37:08] son and there he was
[37:13] we were eternal in his thoughts
[37:17] and in our time and in our
[37:21] season through these church ages
[37:26] we have also become manifested
[37:30] hallelujah glory to god
[37:33] and beloved now are we the sons and
[37:37] daughters of the living god
[37:39] now are we the manifested book of
[37:42] redemption

[37:47] of the living god and the whole creation
[37:50] groans for this
[37:51] hour look at the pollution look at the
[37:54] destruction
[37:55] look at the climate change it's all
[37:57] taking place around us
[37:59] and the creation is groaning for this
[38:02] hour
[38:02] when we as sons and daughters of the
[38:05] living god
[38:06] are made revealed or made manifest
[38:10] for the world to know that there is
[38:13] difference there is something
[38:15] different something strange about them
[38:18] because god is making himself manifest
[38:22] through them praise god hallelujah isn't
[38:24] it marvelous to know this friends
[38:28] throw in the thought that the woman
[38:31] the wife was in the man
[38:34] the christ in elohim before the
[38:38] foundation of the world
[38:40] because of satan perverted thinking he
[38:42] twisted the entire
[38:44] thing around and now place
[38:48] man in the woman amen
[38:52] god had the woman in the man
[38:55] coming forth to be a rib or part of him
[39:01] but now satan by his procreation
[39:05] by his perversion has placed the
[39:10] man in the woman who comes forth with
[39:13] pain trouble sorrow toil
[39:16] labor and death oh
[39:19] thank god that's why we are the term
[39:23] born again free from sin
[39:27] i'm happy night and day oh it makes me
[39:31] want to shout
[39:32] there is no doubt thank god by the
[39:35] opening of the word
[39:36] i have been born again you have been
[39:39] born again we have been born again
[39:43] we have entered into the glorious
[39:46] fellowship of the mystery
[39:48] of those that are in christ glory to god
[39:51] here we are worshiping
[39:55] receiving while we are caught up
[39:59] in the in the great heavenly places
[40:03] in jesus christ with the going forth
[40:06] of the word of god hallelujah amen
[40:10] we don't become the seed of god
[40:14] by rebirth as falsely taught by many
[40:18] denominations
[40:20] when you are you're born again then you
[40:23] become a child of god a son of god
[40:26] a daughter of god as we have related
[40:28] before
[40:29] true sons and daughters of god did not
[40:33] now begin or become
[40:36] sons and daughters of god on a certain
[40:39] day or time
[40:40] for there were always eternal in him
[40:44] it's they who have only now come to
[40:48] realize
[40:49] and recognize who they really
[40:52] are blessed be the name of the lord
[40:55] oh i can hear my father calling
[40:59] i feel the pull oh my god
[41:02] the same he said no man chooses me
[41:05] i choose you and my father draws you
[41:09] what i can't explain what it is how it
[41:12] is
[41:12] but they said the holy spirit he himself
[41:16] will draw you
[41:17] unto himself we don't know what pull
[41:21] this
[41:21] is what drawing this is what attraction
[41:24] this
[41:24] is what is the attraction of christ
[41:27] hallelujah we are not here to imitate
[41:30] him but we are
[41:31] actually here to live the original
[41:35] life of jesus christ come to
[41:38] live in us move in us
[41:42] and have his being in us hallelujah
[41:45] only the true elected seed of god could
[41:48] be reborn
[41:50] for you were already in him before the
[41:53] foundation of the world
[41:56] and now you are being reborn
[41:59] to go back to being who you were
[42:03] and who you are from the very
[42:06] beginning praise god god
[42:10] sends the rain the refreshings
[42:14] of the rain from the presence of god
[42:17] to do what to wake up the seeds
[42:21] buried in this dirt of the human
[42:25] body that came by sin so in the eyes of
[42:29] it's dirt you're just covered on the
[42:31] dirt
[42:32] but and we all covered on the dirt how
[42:35] are we going to know the rains
[42:37] come the thunder rolls the lightning
[42:40] flashes
[42:41] the rain falls and brings forth
[42:44] a germination of the seed life
[42:47] of whatever that seed was then the seed
[42:52] comes up to manifest what
[42:56] it really is on the outside it might put
[42:58] on
[42:59] oh i'm a catholic i'm a baptist i'm a
[43:01] methodist it might put on religious
[43:03] regalia
[43:04] and religious clothing but when it
[43:06] begins to manifest
[43:07] it will show itself who it really is
[43:11] not by its choice but by god's election
[43:15] it begins to show forth
[43:17] what it is it can't help it because
[43:20] every seed
[43:21] must bring forth after its kind all
[43:24] glory be to
[43:26] god hallelujah therefore only the true
[43:30] seed
[43:30] can be genuinely quickened by the holy
[43:33] spirit
[43:34] to accept the word for this its day
[43:37] and for its time and when god begins to
[43:40] draw on call
[43:42] you know it's not a man you know it's
[43:45] not somebody's preaching
[43:47] you know it's not somebody persuasion
[43:50] but it was you by yourself god's
[43:54] supernatural
[43:55] uh pull draw by the holy spirit which he
[43:59] said
[43:59] i choose you i will draw you unto myself
[44:03] blessed is the man who are the woman
[44:06] whom i
[44:06] choose and draw and invite to come on to
[44:10] me
[44:10] oh praise god theirs is the kingdom of
[44:13] heaven
[44:14] oh blessed be the name of the lord o
[44:17] praise his name
[44:18] amen so you'll come back to him
[44:22] you come back to him that is why we find
[44:26] in the bible
[44:28] the word redeem which means to buy back
[44:31] or to restore back to the original
[44:34] owner and this is the preaching of the
[44:37] word
[44:38] that is here to bring you back to your
[44:40] original
[44:41] owner not the church not to this
[44:44] denomination
[44:45] not to this place that ministry or that
[44:48] ministry
[44:48] but you're brought back to god himself
[44:52] by the inspiration of the holy spirit
[44:56] and of the word of god for every seed as
[44:59] i said
[45:00] bring forth after its kind you are not a
[45:04] pig turn into a lamb
[45:07] you are not a dog turned into a sheep
[45:11] my friends the book of genesis tells you
[45:15] every seed must bring forth after his
[45:18] kind
[45:18] you cannot now just come and be a
[45:21] christian
[45:22] you had to be in his mind you had to be
[45:25] in his mind before the foundation of the
[45:27] world
[45:28] and now the holy spirit wakes that up
[45:31] and
[45:31] brings you to consciousness awareness
[45:34] revelation of who you really
[45:37] are and then you wonder you say oh now
[45:40] i see why it was so different now i see
[45:43] why i
[45:44] thought like that now i see why they
[45:46] treated me like that
[45:48] because sometimes the devil knows you
[45:50] are a child of god before you yourself
[45:52] knows
[45:53] oh my but glory to god it's the
[45:56] the words and the spirit is moving
[45:59] upon our hearts we were in the thoughts
[46:01] of god
[46:04] then expressed in flesh
[46:07] and then there had to come a day when we
[46:10] would hear
[46:11] our father's voice and hearing the voice
[46:16] become aware that our father
[46:20] is calling us and then he brings us
[46:24] a little higher where we begin to
[46:27] recognize
[46:30] that we are genuine
[46:33] sons and daughters of god children
[46:36] of the most high and then we hear
[46:40] his voice and we cry out like the
[46:43] practical son
[46:45] oh my father i've never seen you i don't
[46:49] know you physically but in my heart i
[46:51] feel the pull i
[46:53] hear a voice oh god forgive
[46:56] me cleanse me wash me lead me and guide
[46:59] me
[46:59] supernaturally father oh my glory
[47:03] god when that happens friends you don't
[47:05] need litany's you don't need
[47:07] all kinds of uh all kinds of prayer
[47:09] books you don't need
[47:11] all these church fundamentals you don't
[47:14] need
[47:14] church of superintendents you don't need
[47:17] bishoprics you don't need
[47:19] any of these things all you need is the
[47:22] word of god the guiding hand of the holy
[47:26] spirit
[47:27] the leading of the pillar of fire
[47:30] the holy spirit spirit bringing light
[47:32] upon the word
[47:33] amen a path of a just a man or woman
[47:38] it's like a shining light which shines
[47:40] onto the perfect day
[47:42] hallelujah oh my father saved me
[47:46] for i am returning back to you i'm
[47:49] talking about the
[47:50] germ i'm talking about the gene
[47:55] the genes of god that were buried in you
[48:00] hallelujah speaking back to this unseen
[48:04] eternal almighty one the mighty god in
[48:07] christ and saying oh my father save me
[48:11] i recognize you're calling me and i'm
[48:14] coming i'm returning to thee hallelujah
[48:18] a child of god
[48:21] can be a child of god a son or a
[48:23] daughter of god
[48:25] and go like that a long time before they
[48:28] recognize
[48:29] who they really are now i'm going to
[48:32] close my talk
[48:34] with the story of the eagle
[48:37] who lost an egg and then remember
[48:41] that a farmer had taken one of her
[48:45] eggs and planned taking it
[48:48] and that farmer placed it under a
[48:51] chicken
[48:53] and a chicken will hatch the egg as much
[48:55] as an eagle would
[48:57] and so when that eagle was born
[49:00] he found himself a among some
[49:03] a bunch of church chickens
[49:06] uh church members
[49:10] and he didn't know any better so he
[49:11] acted like one
[49:14] he he begins to think like them
[49:17] that fate was just cheap cheap cheap
[49:21] cheap cheap that's what he thought
[49:25] all they thought to eat was to scratch
[49:28] on the ground
[49:29] find a few worms here and there
[49:32] and feed on that but somehow there was a
[49:36] hunger in him
[49:38] he wanted fresh food fresh meat
[49:41] oh praise god something was pulling and
[49:44] drawing
[49:45] moving in him he was different he
[49:49] uh he appeared to be awkward amongst
[49:51] them
[49:52] because he got these long talons long
[49:54] beacon
[49:56] and like latin when they went cheap
[49:58] cheap and he tried to say
[50:00] cheap cheap it would come out with the
[50:02] eagle scream the cry of an eagle
[50:04] hallelujah
[50:05] and he didn't know why that was why
[50:08] couldn't he
[50:09] be like the rest of them but
[50:12] one day that mother eagle remembered
[50:14] passed over that barnyard
[50:16] and let out the scream amen he had
[50:19] never heard a scream of voice he never
[50:22] heard a word
[50:24] like that but somehow in the deep of his
[50:27] heart
[50:28] he recognized that voice he recognized
[50:31] the call
[50:33] he recognized the language and who it
[50:35] was
[50:36] amen praise god son
[50:40] jump on that on that fence jump fly up
[50:43] here
[50:43] he tried to fly up but he could only fly
[50:46] up as far as the pen
[50:47] uh the fence post come up here the son
[50:51] of god
[50:52] come up hither child of god come up
[50:55] higher hear the
[50:56] daughter of god come up hither and he
[50:59] tried to fly up a little higher
[51:01] until he realized that he was crawling
[51:03] on the ground all the time
[51:05] when he had two great wings that the
[51:07] chickens didn't have
[51:09] that he could use them to fly up
[51:12] into the things of god and to recognize
[51:16] the word for his day
[51:17] and for his hour oh praise god
[51:21] thank god that little ego answered the
[51:24] call
