[19:47] Lord God bless you Saints as I was
[19:51] getting ready this morning just thinking
[19:53] how wonderful our God is he's truly
[19:57] amazing
[19:59] you know uh my personal testimony and
[20:02] you you yours included because we share
[20:05] the same trials and the
[20:08] victories and yes we don't always like
[20:11] the trials but without the trials we
[20:14] won't have the victory we couldn't have
[20:17] this personal experience with this
[20:20] amazing God and to know him as God and
[20:24] to be a part of this God and the
[20:27] benefits that of kn knowing this God and
[20:29] how great he is to us it just blows my
[20:32] mind my heart just begins to psate with
[20:37] joy as
[20:39] yours and so he laid this song upon my
[20:42] heart I I really didn't practice I just
[20:45] spoke to Abigail this morning so Grace
[20:48] if you can please put up this song that
[20:50] we all know isn't he
[20:54] wonderful you know Satan is a fraudster
[20:59] I have you have blessings that the Lord
[21:02] has allotted for you and he wants to
[21:05] come into your account and take what
[21:07] belongs to you and you have to fight for
[21:10] everything that he has already given you
[21:13] he it's not that he's going to give you
[21:16] he's given it to us already it's yours
[21:20] and it's mine just think about that I
[21:23] didn't have to work for this he just
[21:25] gave it to me God gave me this salvation
[21:28] and I didn't deserve it I didn't do
[21:30] anything for it and he gave it to me he
[21:33] said I will give you a portion of my
[21:36] life and with it comes the benefits of
[21:40] everything that this God is to us when
[21:43] you think about that you're richer than
[21:45] you think I don't care what the bank
[21:47] says well I kind of have to do but
[21:51] you're richer than you
[21:53] think I began to spend the wealth and
[21:57] Riches of this Lord even before I knew
[22:00] him he didn't just put a canopy over my
[22:02] life today he did it before the
[22:05] foundation of this world you had full
[22:08] coverage before the foundation of this
[22:12] world so if that's not a reason to
[22:16] praise God this morning I don't
[22:18] know leave me be let me be crazy I'll be
[22:22] crazy for him
[22:26] Hallelujah so I need you to help help me
[22:29] because they say the bride knows what to
[22:31] do with the word so she receives the
[22:34] word and responds so instead of me

[34:55] and we weren't paying attention to much
[34:57] of anything except one another and you

[44:44] scripture this
[44:46] morning is from St John you can go to
[44:50] slide number
[44:52] four chapter 1 ver 32-42
[44:58] and John bear record saying I saw the
[45:01] Spirit descending from heaven like a
[45:04] dove and and it Abode upon him and I
[45:08] knew him not but he that sent me to
[45:11] baptize with water the same said unto me
[45:16] upon whom Thou shalt see the spirit
[45:19] descending and remaining on him the same
[45:23] is he which baptizeth with the Holy
[45:26] Ghost
[45:28] and I saw and bear record that this is
[45:32] the Son of God again the next day after
[45:35] John stood and two of his disciples and
[45:38] looking Upon Jesus as he walked he saith
[45:42] Behold the Lamb of God and the two
[45:46] disciples heard him speak and they
[45:49] followed
[45:51] Jesus then Jesus turned and saw them
[45:54] following and saith unto them what seek
[45:58] ye they said unto him Rabbi which is to
[46:02] say being interpreted
[46:05] Master where dwellest
[46:08] thou he an he asked them a question and
[46:12] they respond to him with a
[46:14] question I believe they were excited
[46:17] they wanted to know listen where are you
[46:20] going because wherever you go we are
[46:23] going to
[46:24] follow amen glory to God he saith unto
[46:28] them come and
[46:31] see they came and saw where he dwelt and
[46:35] Abode with him that day for it was about
[46:39] the 10th hour one of the two which heard
[46:42] John speak and followed him was Andrew
[46:47] Simon Peter's
[46:49] brother he first findeth his own brother
[46:52] Simon and saith unto him we have found
[46:55] the Messiahs
[46:57] which is being interpreted the Christ
[47:00] and he brought him to Jesus and when
[47:02] Jesus beheld him he said Thou Art Simon
[47:06] the son of Jonah Thou shalt be called
[47:09] sephus which is by
[47:12] interpretation a stone let us pray
[47:16] father we're grateful this morning
[47:19] Lord and one of the things that we're
[47:23] most grateful for father is that one day
[47:27] you spoke to our hearts and you said
[47:29] come and
[47:30] see and Lord You've opened our
[47:34] understanding beyond anything that we
[47:36] could have possibly imagined and Lord
[47:39] you continue to do it you continue to
[47:41] move through our lives and our and our
[47:43] walks with you father that Lord you have
[47:48] become alive in our lives and a living
[47:52] testimony in the midst of our lives and
[47:56] the people that that we that we move
[47:58] around and and and fellowship with here
[48:01] on this Earth Lord may you take control
[48:04] direct us and guide us in these few
[48:07] thoughts Lord may your anointing just
[48:09] come and Lord refresh us with your
[48:11] presence and Lord may we see and may we
[48:15] sense your your anointing like the video
[48:18] said come and experience the Living God
[48:24] Lord grant it today Father meet every
[48:27] need in our midst in Jesus Christ's name
[48:31] amen God bless you
[48:37] Saints glory to
[48:41] God what a what a an interesting thing
[48:44] when when you see how Jesus you know
[48:48] starts out his ministry and you know one
[48:51] of the first phrases that he
[48:54] makes when when um you know he comes
[48:57] into his public Ministry he's asked you
[49:00] know he's asked where you know Lord
[49:03] where where are you going he turns he
[49:05] says he ask the people he says what are
[49:07] you looking for and the first thing they
[49:09] say is Lord where are you going we wanna
[49:12] we want to be with you we want to know
[49:14] you but what's interesting what's more
[49:16] interesting is that we see that they
[49:19] received this this call upon their lives
[49:23] it came through John the Baptist it came
[49:26] came by them following him first it came
[49:30] because John had entered into his
[49:33] ministry he had come into His placing of
[49:36] the word of God and when someone gets
[49:38] into their position in the word of God
[49:41] and have recognized the Living God they
[49:44] start to become like a beacon they start
[49:46] to become like a a place where people
[49:48] can get answers and where people can
[49:51] receive Direction and
[49:54] instruction and so you know um I want to
[49:58] look at today I want to take a look at
[50:01] you know this whole uh principle that
[50:04] that the Lord Jesus has given us to
[50:07] follow him and to come and see and you
[50:11] know I want to lay in some some simple
[50:14] principles today around witnessing and
[50:18] how witnessing is is a powerful part of
[50:22] our Lives once we've become uh awakened
[50:25] to the word of God for our day and for
[50:27] this
[50:28] hour and so you know one of the things
[50:32] um you know as I was uh doing some study
[50:35] I came across certain polls and studies
[50:39] now I want you to understand you know to
[50:42] to be a witness in this day and in this
[50:44] hour in a world that we're living in
[50:46] where everything is really against
[50:49] Christians yeah it's it's you know we've
[50:52] come to a place where you know it's
[50:55] becoming harder and harder harder for
[50:57] people to testify you know about Jesus
[51:00] Christ and about his salvation and that
[51:03] he is the one and only true way to
[51:08] Salvation you got to be politically
[51:10] correct these days in the things that
[51:12] you're saying you got to be careful what
[51:14] you're saying because people get
[51:16] offended you know when you when you try
[51:19] to express you know your Zeal and your
[51:23] desire for them to come to know the Lord
[51:25] Jesus Christ
[51:28] and you know when you're living in an
[51:29] age where you know more than 60% of
[51:32] adults in Christian churches say that
[51:36] they don't share the
[51:40] gospel one of the main reasons is
[51:43] because they don't know methods to do it
[51:46] in today's culture they they're finding
[51:48] it difficult to to be politically
[51:51] correct in in the way that they bring
[51:53] Jesus Christ to the people you know
[51:57] um but but uh there was a research done
[52:00] by LifeWay
[52:02] research and it was entitled evangelism
[52:05] explosion study of
[52:08] America Christians openness to talking
[52:11] about faith and it was a survey done in
[52:14] 2022 and the survey found that
[52:18] 54% of the participants said they are
[52:21] either willing or eager when asked what
[52:25] they think about telling others about
[52:28] Jesus Christ so half of them were
[52:31] willing and eager however
[52:33] 52% of Americans who identify as
[52:37] Christians believe that encouraging
[52:40] someone to change their religious
[52:42] beliefs is
[52:44] offensive and
[52:46] disrespectful this is the kind of world
[52:48] that we live in and 66% of the
[52:51] Christians are not familiar with ways by
[52:55] which they can
[52:57] share Jesus Christ to the
[53:00] people but we know that the greatest way
[53:03] is to live his word amen is to be a
[53:07] living testimony of Jesus Christ amen to
[53:11] to to express him in our daily lives to
[53:15] share that he's a Healer when you come
[53:17] across somebody that's sick to share
[53:20] that he's a savior when you come across
[53:22] somebody that's down and out to share
[53:25] that that that that he can take away
[53:28] your sin because of your shame because
[53:31] people are are are are in shame and you
[53:34] know they don't know how they can come
[53:36] out of their shame and and out of their
[53:39] their their sin and and all the mistakes
[53:41] that they've made in their lives but
[53:43] when we share that Jesus Christ is a is
[53:46] a savior and he's a he's he's the only
[53:49] one that can actually forgive your sins
[53:52] to the point where they would be
[53:54] remembered no more
[53:57] that's powerful when you can share that
[54:02] testimony
[54:04] 68% of those pulled responded and
[54:08] believe that it is the responsibility of
[54:10] the pastor to equip the congregation to
[54:15] share the
[54:16] gospel and 69% agreed that it's the
[54:20] responsibility of Christians to
[54:23] encourage non-christians to trust Christ
[54:27] as their
[54:29] savior the survey revealed that 70% of
[54:32] Christians have not shared with a
[54:35] stranger
[54:37] now on how to become a Christian in the
[54:41] past six months so they they asked him
[54:43] in the last six months how many of you
[54:45] have actually shared your faith and 70%
[54:49] of them said they had
[54:52] not 93% say they are at least somewhat
[54:57] open to having a conversation about
[54:59] faith with a friend but only
[55:02] 52% actually shared a
[55:05] story about their faith in
[55:10] God additionally
[55:12] 57% say they have not invited a friend
[55:17] to church over the last six
[55:22] months you see it's becoming more and
[55:25] more difficult
[55:27] to share Jesus
[55:29] Christ but today we want you to know
[55:33] that all you need to do is come and
[55:37] see come and see that the Lord is good
[55:41] come and see that he's still God he's
[55:44] the only one that can save he's the only
[55:46] one that can heal he's the only one that
[55:48] can wipe away your
[55:50] sin amen
[55:53] hallelujah see the real reason that
[55:56] people don't witness
[55:58] Christ is because we're at war with this
[56:03] sinful
[56:04] nature you see you're born in sin you're
[56:06] shaped in iniquity and you're speaking
[56:09] lies until you receive the new birth you
[56:13] are at war with this flesh and your and
[56:18] your human nature your carnal mind is at
[56:21] enity with
[56:22] God and we're constantly being
[56:25] distracted Ed by the lust of the flesh
[56:30] or by the pride of life or by the
[56:34] Temptations that are constantly being
[56:36] thrown Upon Us in social media I mean
[56:40] you can barely go down the street and
[56:43] not get hit with a billboard of of uh of
[56:47] something that's you know either a a
[56:50] woman that's not fully dressed or just
[56:52] the way that that that things are being
[56:55] uh you know advertise these days it's a
[56:58] constant Temptation Upon Our
[57:01] flesh but we need to recognize that and
[57:05] we need to put on the helmet of faith we
[57:08] need to allow Jesus Christ to come into
[57:11] our lives so that so that he can set a
[57:13] new standard in our lives God will never
[57:16] tempt you with those things go to the
[57:18] next
[57:21] Slide the scripture says in James
[57:25] 13:14 let no man say when he is tempted
[57:28] I am tempted of God God is not going to
[57:31] tempt you God is not going to test you
[57:34] in those areas it's the enemy and it's
[57:38] it's your own lustful desires it says
[57:40] here I that for God cannot be tempted
[57:43] with evil evil not neither tempted he
[57:46] any man but every man is tempted when he
[57:49] is drawn away of his own lust and
[57:53] enticed and allows those
[57:56] enticements and those Temptations and
[57:59] those lusts to take us
[58:04] over
[58:07] amen there's also other
[58:09] issues that are at work in today's
[58:14] world and and what we're seeing is that
[58:17] there's no fear of God there's no real
[58:20] fear of God the reality of God we claim
[58:25] that we'll all stand before him you know
[58:27] in the Judgment but yet we're living
[58:30] like we really don't believe that he's
[58:32] real that's why you'll talk to people
[58:35] about the Lord Jesus he has not become a
[58:38] reality to them
[58:41] yet but it takes him revealing himself
[58:45] to you personally when you open yourself
[58:49] and you and you come and
[58:51] see that the Lord can do some great
[58:54] things in your lives
[58:58] am a while back there was a
[59:01] story in the
[59:03] newspaper we're talking about how how
[59:05] there's you know how God is not you know
[59:09] it's he's not real to the people and so
[59:11] a while back I found this on the
[59:13] internet a while back there was a story
[59:14] in the newspaper of the US Naval Academy
[59:18] in Ann Anapolis Maryland about a group
[59:21] of ships that were on a training Mission
[59:23] these are naval ships they had been in
[59:26] Maneuvers when a huge storm Came Upon
[59:29] them nightfell invisibility was
[59:32] poor it was foggy and raining so the
[59:36] captain remained on the bridge keeping
[59:38] an eye on things and all of a sudden the
[59:42] lookout on the bow reported light
[59:45] bearing steady on the starboard bow
[59:49] which means that something was headed
[59:51] straight for the
[59:53] ship the captain called for the signal
[59:57] man and said signal that ship we are on
[1:00:00] a collision course we advise you to
[1:00:04] change course
[1:00:06] 20° back came the
[1:00:11] signal we advise you to change course
[1:00:16] 20° the captain had the signal send
[1:00:19] another message I am a captain of the
[1:00:23] United States Navy change course
[1:00:27] 20° the reply came back I am a seaman
[1:00:31] second class you change course
[1:00:35] 20° by now the captain was
[1:00:38] Furious he yelled to the signal men tell
[1:00:42] them we are in a battleship change
[1:00:45] course
[1:00:46] 20° back came the reply I am in a
[1:00:52] lighthouse and the captain quickly
[1:00:54] changed his
[1:00:57] course you see God is a lighthouse amen
[1:01:02] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:01:05] forever he does not change the Bible
[1:01:08] tells us that God is a lighthouse
[1:01:11] because he never changes he's 13 he's
[1:01:14] Hebrews 138 the same yesterday today and
[1:01:18] forever this is the foundation and this
[1:01:20] is the one thing that that that people
[1:01:23] individuals are failing to rec recognize
[1:01:26] that Jesus Christ like it says right
[1:01:28] back there on the wall he's the same he
[1:01:31] does not change and so it really doesn't
[1:01:35] matter how the world changes around
[1:01:38] us and what becomes acceptable by
[1:01:41] culture and by by by
[1:01:45] government we've seen that they've let
[1:01:47] down all the bars we've seen that
[1:01:50] they've that they've you know passed
[1:01:52] bills and rights you know gay rights and
[1:01:56] you know gender rights and all these
[1:01:58] different things we've seen them that
[1:02:00] they've passed all these things and it
[1:02:02] goes to show that God is not real to
[1:02:05] them
[1:02:08] amen but when God becomes a reality to
[1:02:12] you because now this reality is not so
[1:02:15] listen God is not trying to convert
[1:02:18] governments God is not looking to
[1:02:20] convert
[1:02:21] Nations he's only going to convert one
[1:02:24] nation and that's the the nation of
[1:02:26] Israel because they are his chosen
[1:02:28] people and according to scripture God
[1:02:31] will deal with them
[1:02:33] directly right now he's dealing like we
[1:02:36] were preaching over the last few weeks
[1:02:38] about the Gentile dispensation he's
[1:02:41] dealing with
[1:02:42] Gentiles when Jesus came he came and he
[1:02:46] realized that they did not receive him
[1:02:48] the the Jewish Nation this the the the
[1:02:51] nation of Israel could not receive him
[1:02:54] as a nation but he said said we he would
[1:02:57] go to the Gentiles to take a wife out of
[1:03:00] the Gentiles to call a church out of the
[1:03:03] Gentiles amen and so no matter how much
[1:03:06] they change the laws of society and turn
[1:03:10] them against God God will never change
[1:03:14] his word God will never change his
[1:03:17] position
[1:03:19] amen glory to God
[1:03:22] Amen God is still the same his commands
[1:03:26] are still the same his character is
[1:03:28] still the same his attributes are still
[1:03:31] the same amen and what God calls evil
[1:03:34] and what God calls good doesn't change
[1:03:37] with the
[1:03:38] times amen praise God and so we'll
[1:03:42] either turn and and Obey God's word or
[1:03:46] we'll be crushed by God's word amen will
[1:03:50] be crushed by the prophecy that is
[1:03:52] coming down upon this Earth Jesus Christ
[1:03:55] is inviting you this morning to come and
[1:03:58] see and to come and and experience the
[1:04:02] reality of what it is to know him in the
[1:04:05] power of his
[1:04:07] resurrection thank you Jesus
[1:04:10] Hallelujah so here now we see Jesus
[1:04:13] entering into his public
[1:04:15] Ministry and he's and and and and what's
[1:04:18] he doing he's immediately calling
[1:04:22] disciples immediately unveiling himself
[1:04:25] making himself known and only a few
[1:04:29] actually recognized who he
[1:04:32] was and what we want to look at is that
[1:04:36] these principles of how Christ calls has
[1:04:40] not changed the way he did it 2,000
[1:04:43] years ago he does it
[1:04:45] today he does not change amen praise God
[1:04:49] and what we're going to be looking at
[1:04:51] specifically are three principles okay
[1:04:54] and they are around witnessing and how
[1:04:57] you know how we can even notice and
[1:04:59] recognize how it how it moved through
[1:05:02] the disciples and how you may or may not
[1:05:05] be conscious of it now but it's actually
[1:05:07] moving through you amen it's the way
[1:05:10] that God is reaching his sons and his
[1:05:15] daughters and so um in in researching
[1:05:20] other studies which I found on the
[1:05:21] internet regarding Christian churches I
[1:05:24] found that most of them List personal
[1:05:27] evangelism as the most
[1:05:30] neglected by Christians
[1:05:34] today people are afraid to to witness
[1:05:39] and to let people know that Jesus Christ
[1:05:42] is a reality but let him come in one
[1:05:45] time let him change your life in the
[1:05:48] same way that he did when when blind
[1:05:51] barus was standing on the side of the
[1:05:53] road and said Son of David have mercy
[1:05:56] upon me let that happen just once I
[1:05:59] promise you you will be a true witness
[1:06:02] am you will become a true witness and
[1:06:05] you will you you will not be able to
[1:06:07] contain what God has done in your life
[1:06:11] amen praise God
[1:06:13] hallelujah when we look at John the
[1:06:16] Baptist we look to see how he was
[1:06:19] actually expressing these three
[1:06:22] principles the first thing we see here
[1:06:24] is that John the Baptist wasn't just
[1:06:27] ministering or speaking he was walking
[1:06:31] what he was
[1:06:33] speaking he was he told them who he was
[1:06:36] they came to him they asked him who are
[1:06:38] you you know what are you all about and
[1:06:42] he all he could tell him was what the
[1:06:44] word said I am the voice of one crying
[1:06:47] in the
[1:06:48] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[1:06:51] Lord he was one that God had anointed to
[1:06:54] prepare for his first coming amen
[1:06:57] remember he said he's just a forerunner
[1:07:00] he told him I am not the Christ I'm just
[1:07:03] trying to point people to him amen now
[1:07:07] he gets the opportunity to prove that
[1:07:10] John's got
[1:07:12] followers John had people that he had
[1:07:14] actually discipled because he had you
[1:07:17] know he had been ministering and and and
[1:07:20] crying out that the king is coming
[1:07:22] prepare the way the king is coming and
[1:07:24] we got the same message the king is here
[1:07:28] our message is that the king is here you
[1:07:31] need to receive the word for your day
[1:07:34] and recognize that Jesus Christ can come
[1:07:36] into your life into your personal walk
[1:07:39] and change you today amen amen praise
[1:07:43] God hallelujah so he had these he had
[1:07:46] these followers he got these disciples
[1:07:49] he gained recognition and now the
[1:07:51] question was is he going to be able to
[1:07:53] let go of what he built see a lot of
[1:07:57] preachers will build churches and they
[1:07:59] want to they want to build thousands and
[1:08:01] thousands of people into the church but
[1:08:03] they want them to follow them and
[1:08:06] they're not telling the people what they
[1:08:08] need to hear they're not telling them
[1:08:10] about Sin they're not telling them about
[1:08:13] what it really is to be a woman or to be
[1:08:16] a true man as a son or a daughter of God
[1:08:19] they're afraid to tell them the truth
[1:08:22] which is what is going to liberate them
[1:08:24] but they are teaching teaching them like
[1:08:26] the blind leading the blind
[1:08:29] amen and not leading them directly back
[1:08:32] to the word of
[1:08:34] God and if the blind lead the blind
[1:08:37] they'll both fall into the
[1:08:41] ditch but here John the
[1:08:44] Baptist you know he
[1:08:47] recognized and so he displayed the very
[1:08:50] first
[1:08:52] principle he had the right motives in
[1:08:55] his heart he knew that his his calling
[1:08:59] was one thing to point individuals to
[1:09:03] Jesus Christ and we as Sons and
[1:09:06] Daughters of God we have one calling
[1:09:09] Upon Our Lives and that is not to point
[1:09:12] people to a
[1:09:14] church to a
[1:09:16] membership to a
[1:09:18] building but they need to be pointed to
[1:09:21] Jesus Christ who is the only one and
[1:09:24] true savior
[1:09:28] amen the first principle let's go to the
[1:09:31] next
[1:09:36] slide it is never about
[1:09:39] us it's all about Jesus that's principle
[1:09:43] number one it's not
[1:09:46] about us but it's about what Jesus did
[1:09:50] for
[1:09:51] us we tell them our testimony we let
[1:09:53] them know what God has what God has done
[1:09:56] in our lives and how he's changed and
[1:09:58] how he's delivered us from from you know
[1:10:01] addictions and and from from Pain and
[1:10:04] broken
[1:10:06] relationships and and healed our bodies
[1:10:09] when when there was we were given up by
[1:10:12] the doctors the doctors said no
[1:10:16] hope but yet he was their
[1:10:20] hope amen Not only was he their hope he
[1:10:23] was their deliverer amen
[1:10:27] amen it's all about Jesus we must Point
[1:10:30] people to
[1:10:32] Christ John makes it clear when he says
[1:10:35] I must
[1:10:37] decrease so that he can
[1:10:39] increase he recognize what he had to
[1:10:42] do he had to let go of his past let go
[1:10:46] of of of you know his disciples let go
[1:10:49] of everything that that that he had you
[1:10:52] know known he had to let it all go so
[1:10:55] that Jesus could increase so that the
[1:10:57] people's eyes would be taken away from
[1:11:00] him and put on Jesus
[1:11:04] Christ he's the one who forgives our
[1:11:06] sins he's the one who heals us John
[1:11:09] pointed his disciples to Jesus Christ so
[1:11:13] pointing his disciples to Jesus Christ
[1:11:15] the Savior showed that he was
[1:11:18] successful in pointing others to
[1:11:23] Christ and Andrew
[1:11:26] and other disciples left
[1:11:30] John and recognized who they needed to
[1:11:33] follow it's like in this day we need to
[1:11:37] recognize who we are
[1:11:39] following we're not following William
[1:11:44] Branham just like John the Baptist he
[1:11:47] was the spirit of
[1:11:49] Elijah to come and turn the hearts of
[1:11:53] the
[1:11:53] people to hear the coming of the Lord he
[1:11:58] was the voice announcing his first
[1:12:01] coming but when he had fulfilled his his
[1:12:05] ministry he decreased so that Christ
[1:12:08] could
[1:12:09] increase and today we're living in a
[1:12:12] time where this message is in that same
[1:12:17] condition and people are not realizing
[1:12:19] and recognizing that the second Elijah
[1:12:23] like it says the one that would turn the
[1:12:25] hearts of the children back to the faith
[1:12:27] of the fathers and the faith of the
[1:12:29] fathers back to the heart of the
[1:12:31] children that Ministry has been
[1:12:35] fulfilled and when he came to fulfill
[1:12:37] that Ministry it was for one purpose to
[1:12:40] point the people to Jesus Christ and
[1:12:44] that they should follow him and here we
[1:12:47] have perfect examples in Andrew because
[1:12:51] what did Andrew do the first thing that
[1:12:53] he did was he went immediately and told
[1:12:57] his brother
[1:12:59] Simon and I want you to notice what what
[1:13:02] takes place you see when when Andrew was
[1:13:04] awakened to the reality of God and that
[1:13:08] now he was following the Messiah the
[1:13:11] Christ the anoint he was God made flesh
[1:13:14] he recognized that the
[1:13:16] word that was in the
[1:13:19] beginning had been made flesh and was
[1:13:22] there right before them
[1:13:26] and immediately he went to tell Andrew
[1:13:30] he went to or Andrew went to tell Simon
[1:13:32] and then you'll see that Andrew he
[1:13:34] brought many to Christ he brought
[1:13:37] Nathaniel to Christ he brought many to
[1:13:40] Christ BEC oh no Philip actually brought
[1:13:42] Nathaniel sorry but these
[1:13:45] disciples they they got converted and
[1:13:48] the first thing they did was they LED
[1:13:52] them immediately to Christ they didn't
[1:13:55] run them back to John the
[1:13:57] Baptist and if you're running people
[1:14:00] back to William brandham you're missing
[1:14:03] the the the the the the
[1:14:05] transition and what God is actually
[1:14:07] doing in this hour you could never leave
[1:14:10] will just like we couldn't leave out
[1:14:12] John the Baptist he's part of the
[1:14:15] scripture he had his part in the word of
[1:14:18] God and he fulfilled his part in the
[1:14:20] word of God
[1:14:22] Amen but then he had to decrease so that
[1:14:25] Christ could
[1:14:27] increase so that Jesus Christ could take
[1:14:30] over because it wasn't it wasn't uh you
[1:14:34] know William Branham that forgave my
[1:14:37] sins I know there's a lot of people that
[1:14:38] even want to make him deity they want to
[1:14:41] make him God they want to listen to the
[1:14:44] tapes and only the tapes and that is and
[1:14:47] what he says is what it
[1:14:50] is and nothing more nothing less if what
[1:14:53] he says is with the word it's thus
[1:14:56] sayeth the Lord it's as simple as that
[1:14:58] and there wasn't one time that when he
[1:15:00] did say thus sayeth the Lord that it was
[1:15:03] wrong because God was standing behind
[1:15:06] his word for that
[1:15:10] day amen and today now we are
[1:15:15] progressing and we and we need to look
[1:15:17] at the
[1:15:18] examples that we're seeing here from the
[1:15:21] scripture because remember Jesus Christ
[1:15:24] is the same yesterday today and
[1:15:27] forever when he came on the scene and
[1:15:30] they asked Jesus uh you know and Jesus
[1:15:33] asked them where they're going and they
[1:15:34] asked Jesus where they're going Jesus
[1:15:36] didn't turn them to say well go back to
[1:15:39] John the Baptist the only time he told
[1:15:42] the people to go back to John the
[1:15:43] Baptist is because John had gotten into
[1:15:46] a condition while he was in jail and he
[1:15:48] had the he actually had to send out a
[1:15:50] message to say is is he really the one
[1:15:53] and Jesus says you can go and tell
[1:15:55] him you can go and tell him that yes I
[1:15:59] am the
[1:16:01] one and people need to recognize the
[1:16:05] hour that we're living in so that they
[1:16:07] can get with the
[1:16:09] program they can walk with God in this
[1:16:13] day and in this hour so that they can
[1:16:15] receive the rapturing faith that you
[1:16:19] need in order to be changed and
[1:16:22] translated because the message for this
[1:16:24] hour power is the
[1:16:27] rapture he's already come and you didn't
[1:16:31] know it he's already in the church and
[1:16:34] he's Gathering his people he's already
[1:16:38] perfecting Sons and Daughters of God and
[1:16:41] bringing them into the unity of the
[1:16:43] faith so that they can unite into the
[1:16:47] body and when that last Gentile gets
[1:16:50] into the
[1:16:52] body in the moment and in the twinkling
[1:16:55] of an
[1:16:56] eye that body is going to be changed and
[1:17:00] if you're in that body you're in the
[1:17:03] safest place on Earth right
[1:17:06] now come and
[1:17:10] see and so principle number
[1:17:14] two next slide says make sure you are
[1:17:18] seeking Jesus for the right
[1:17:22] reasons see a lot of people they're
[1:17:25] seeking Jesus for different reasons you
[1:17:28] know because there's a few different
[1:17:30] jesuses out there Believe It or
[1:17:33] Not
[1:17:35] amen but you know he asked
[1:17:39] them what are you looking for what seek
[1:17:44] ye you got to know what you're looking
[1:17:46] for you gotta you got to know what God
[1:17:49] requires in this day and in this hour
[1:17:52] it's not just joining Church
[1:17:55] people feel Justified because they
[1:17:56] belong to the Catholic church or the
[1:17:58] Baptist Church or the Presbyterian
[1:18:00] church or the Pentecostal Church even in
[1:18:04] churches within this message feeling
[1:18:06] Justified that they just belong to that
[1:18:09] church so if they just belong to that
[1:18:11] church that believes that God sent a
[1:18:13] prophet they're going to go in the
[1:18:18] Rapture people that came out from Martin
[1:18:21] with Martin
[1:18:22] Luther came out of the count Catholic
[1:18:25] Church they had to recognize why they
[1:18:28] had come
[1:18:29] out if they were only just following him
[1:18:32] because he was German and they were
[1:18:35] German then they're going to miss the
[1:18:38] real experience you see Luther
[1:18:42] experienced Jus he he experienced
[1:18:44] justification by faith he received his
[1:18:47] own revelation of who Christ was and
[1:18:51] that's what Drew him away and pulled him
[1:18:54] out of the Catholic church because he
[1:18:56] met the Personal Jesus
[1:18:59] am and you need to meet the Personal
[1:19:01] Jesus and today there's people right
[1:19:04] within the confines of this message that
[1:19:06] have not met the Personal Jesus because
[1:19:08] all they can see is is is Elijah the
[1:19:12] prophet and they're missing the one that
[1:19:15] he's he's only the signpost that was
[1:19:17] pointing them to
[1:19:21] Christ so there's you know different
[1:19:24] Jesus
[1:19:29] is now the
[1:19:31] reason we're saying
[1:19:36] this because it's so
[1:19:38] [Music]
[1:19:40] important the first recorded words of
[1:19:42] Jesus in John's
[1:19:44] gospel was what is it that you're
[1:19:47] seeking and it's important for us to ask
[1:19:51] that question why are we seeking the
[1:19:53] Lord what is it that we are looking for
[1:19:57] you know is it
[1:19:59] wealth is it
[1:20:01] health you know is is it the Prosperity
[1:20:04] Gospel that you're looking for because
[1:20:06] you're not going to find Jesus there
[1:20:09] there's a lot of churches that are built
[1:20:11] on the Prosperity
[1:20:13] Gospel this church is built upon the
[1:20:16] word of God am this church is the word
[1:20:20] of God Amen this church cannot deny the
[1:20:24] word of God it will not put Prosperity
[1:20:26] before the
[1:20:28] word first comes the word and everything
[1:20:32] else follows the
[1:20:34] word we're not looking for a Prosperity
[1:20:38] Gospel we're not looking for a savior
[1:20:41] who who doesn't who doesn't uh uh
[1:20:43] condemn
[1:20:45] sin sin is unbelief in the word of God
[1:20:49] it's not cheating lying stealing those
[1:20:53] are not sin
[1:20:55] those are the attributes of sin those
[1:20:58] are the results of you disbelieving the
[1:21:01] word of God when a man or a woman
[1:21:04] commits adultery it's because they don't
[1:21:06] believe God's word it's as simple as
[1:21:11] that and they need to know that it's a
[1:21:14] sin they need to know that there is sin
[1:21:17] they need to know that that that that
[1:21:20] you can't just live any way that you
[1:21:22] want and still call yourself a Christian
[1:21:26] Jesus said come follow
[1:21:29] me when you follow Christ you're
[1:21:33] following in his
[1:21:35] footsteps he knows that you're human he
[1:21:38] knows that you're still in a human
[1:21:40] vessel and so he knows that you're going
[1:21:43] to make mistakes so don't think that I'm
[1:21:45] here trying to preach a a gospel of
[1:21:48] perfection the word is perfect but you
[1:21:51] and I we could never be perfect
[1:21:55] like we said earlier we are we are drawn
[1:21:58] by our own lusts and and enticed by the
[1:22:02] Temptations that are constantly around
[1:22:04] us our carnal mind is constantly at
[1:22:07] enity against the word of God and so we
[1:22:10] need to realize that that that we are
[1:22:13] fighting a real
[1:22:16] battle but he said I'll be with
[1:22:19] you I'll be in
[1:22:21] you I'll be there to take you all all
[1:22:24] the way through amen praise God so we're
[1:22:28] looking for that for that's you know the
[1:22:30] new age Jesus is the one that doesn't
[1:22:33] condemn sin oh you can be you know
[1:22:36] you're you're just a part of the
[1:22:37] universe and you can you know oh well if
[1:22:40] you make a mistake in this life you'll
[1:22:42] get a chance at another life they'll
[1:22:44] tell you about reincarnation that's the
[1:22:46] new age
[1:22:49] Jesus that's not the Jesus that we
[1:22:51] follow we follow the Jesus of the
[1:22:54] Bible the one who is the same yesterday
[1:22:57] today and
[1:22:59] forever amen so what are you looking for
[1:23:03] what do you expect from following Christ
[1:23:05] what are you seeking it's a great
[1:23:08] question because it's it's it it gets
[1:23:11] right to the motivation of your heart it
[1:23:13] gets right to where you are right now
[1:23:15] and you know like sometimes you meet
[1:23:18] people and you got to get them to that
[1:23:19] place where they can be completely
[1:23:22] honest and and right from the depths of
[1:23:25] their heart bring
[1:23:27] out a real motive for coming to Christ
[1:23:33] some people wait until you know it gets
[1:23:36] to the absolute emergency situation you
[1:23:40] know like our brother coffee here listen
[1:23:42] he's been serving God he's been praying
[1:23:45] he's been a part of The Prayer Ministry
[1:23:47] he's given testimonies over and over
[1:23:49] where God delivered him he knows that
[1:23:52] God is a deliverer amen
[1:23:55] even at the even right there at the at
[1:23:57] the cusp of where he was crossing over
[1:24:00] between death and life he still knew
[1:24:03] that Christ was in
[1:24:05] control that he was still more than able
[1:24:08] and if it was God's time to take him so
[1:24:11] be it and that's the way we should we
[1:24:13] should have the that kind of a
[1:24:15] relationship with Christ that we don't
[1:24:18] fear death We Don't Fear the things that
[1:24:21] this world can throw upon us whether it
[1:24:24] be natural disaster or whether it be
[1:24:28] sickness because remember what we said
[1:24:30] earlier God is a light house he's a
[1:24:33] steady place that we can turn to amen he
[1:24:37] doesn't change the listen the conditions
[1:24:40] around our lives might change all of a
[1:24:42] sudden sickness might come through the
[1:24:44] front door but Jesus doesn't change he's
[1:24:48] still the same he stays right there
[1:24:50] right where he was right where he was
[1:24:52] from before the foundations of the the
[1:24:54] world where he says I am the Lord thy
[1:24:56] God that Health
[1:24:58] thee and so he doesn't change but
[1:25:01] circumstances might change around our
[1:25:03] lives and I know brother Gabriel he was
[1:25:06] in that situation when he got to Italy
[1:25:09] where where he was in so much pain he
[1:25:11] didn't know where to turn he didn't know
[1:25:13] what to do but God was more than able to
[1:25:17] come on the scene and deliver him thank
[1:25:20] you Jesus
[1:25:22] [Applause]
[1:25:24] and so we don't want to be approaching
[1:25:27] God as a
[1:25:29] stranger we want to approach him by a
[1:25:34] relationship something that's real in
[1:25:36] our lives it's a reality that we can
[1:25:39] know that listen situations will
[1:25:42] come emergencies will come circumstances
[1:25:46] will rise up the enemy will tell you
[1:25:50] that you're lost the enemy will come and
[1:25:52] tell you that you're not a son or a
[1:25:53] daughter of God but it's at those times
[1:25:57] where he says be still and know that I
[1:25:59] am God I don't
[1:26:02] change if I revealed myself to you the
[1:26:05] first time and I told you the first time
[1:26:08] that you are my child and that you are
[1:26:12] saved stand right there let the
[1:26:16] circumstances be what they are but you
[1:26:21] stand thank you Lord hallelujah
[1:26:27] so Jesus asked them you know what are
[1:26:29] you seeking and they answer the question
[1:26:31] with a question where are you
[1:26:34] staying but their
[1:26:36] answer question shows their
[1:26:40] motivation they're saying Jesus we want
[1:26:42] to spend time with you we want to get to
[1:26:44] know you better we've recognized that
[1:26:47] you are the Messiah because John told us
[1:26:51] all about you he said that you would do
[1:26:53] this that that you would do that and
[1:26:55] that's exactly what you're doing because
[1:26:58] how could Andrew you know go to Simon
[1:27:01] Peter bring Simon right back to Jesus
[1:27:04] and right there and then Simon Peter had
[1:27:07] a call upon his life how did he receive
[1:27:09] that call when Jesus says hey
[1:27:14] Simon
[1:27:16] hey I your name is
[1:27:19] actually
[1:27:21] sephus which means Stone
[1:27:25] in other words I'm giving you revelation
[1:27:27] of who you are and immediately Simon
[1:27:31] Peter recognized that whoa hang on a
[1:27:34] minute this is this is a reality and
[1:27:37] until you've had that kind of an
[1:27:39] experience where you come into church or
[1:27:42] where you where you come to a place and
[1:27:45] God speaks to you and reveals himself to
[1:27:48] you discerns your life tells you where
[1:27:51] you were tells you the condition that
[1:27:53] you were in in and tells you now that
[1:27:56] you have been
[1:27:57] delivered until that time until that
[1:28:00] experience takes place he can't really
[1:28:02] become the reality and the and the and
[1:28:05] the real true Living God in your
[1:28:09] life that's the kind of experience that
[1:28:13] we want that's why Jesus said come and
[1:28:19] see and when you come to Jesus you're
[1:28:22] going to see whether he is a reality or
[1:28:25] not but you need to come face to face
[1:28:30] you don't come with your own ideas you
[1:28:32] don't come with your own doctrines you
[1:28:35] don't come because your your your
[1:28:37] teachings tell you this that that he's a
[1:28:40] trinity that he's this or no no you come
[1:28:42] to God and you come you come pure of
[1:28:46] heart you come with the right motives
[1:28:48] you come with the right reasons and then
[1:28:51] God can look right into your heart you
[1:28:53] see when brother brandham was standing
[1:28:56] in all of those prayer lines he was
[1:28:59] waiting for the Holy Spirit to make
[1:29:02] contact with the spirit that was in the
[1:29:06] individual brother brandham stood in
[1:29:09] those prayer lines and hundreds of
[1:29:11] thousands of people were healed
[1:29:13] throughout his ministry we don't know
[1:29:15] how many thousands of people but it
[1:29:19] wasn't William Branham that healed any
[1:29:21] of those people it was was always Jesus
[1:29:25] Christ the angel of God the mighty Angel
[1:29:29] himself that would connect with the
[1:29:32] spirit of the individual just like Jesus
[1:29:35] when he did it with Simon Peter he
[1:29:38] connected immediately with it with his
[1:29:40] spirit and told him who he
[1:29:43] was and at that moment Peter knew who he
[1:29:46] was he understood that Jesus was a
[1:29:49] reality that he was that he was not just
[1:29:52] just a preacher
[1:29:54] you know a lot of people can hear uh me
[1:29:56] speak on the word of God and you know
[1:29:59] and they can hear the Zeal and and and
[1:30:02] what you know the the passion that I
[1:30:04] have for the word of God but until they
[1:30:06] experience that passion and they
[1:30:08] experience Christ in the power of his
[1:30:11] resurrection in their personal life they
[1:30:14] cannot
[1:30:16] know the True
[1:30:20] Deliverance and we are listen we're no
[1:30:23] better than anybody
[1:30:25] else we need to we need to you know some
[1:30:29] some people are so quick to judge you
[1:30:32] know they'll see something and they'll
[1:30:34] they'll see like you know somebody
[1:30:36] that's you know not properly dressed or
[1:30:38] you know they you know oh and and they
[1:30:41] might even see you with them oh yeah and
[1:30:44] they're going to say oh yeah oh oh yeah
[1:30:46] he's a pastor look at who he's hanging
[1:30:48] out with
[1:30:54] meanwhile Jesus when he was here on the
[1:30:56] earth he had a group around him that the
[1:30:59] people were saying look at
[1:31:01] this he's hanging out with prostitutes
[1:31:05] what he's going to Peter's house does he
[1:31:07] know who Peter
[1:31:09] is does he know who Matthew is he's he's
[1:31:13] he's he's taking all our
[1:31:17] money you see Jesus himself said I did
[1:31:20] not come for the
[1:31:22] righteous I have come for those that are
[1:31:25] sick and need a
[1:31:28] healing they need Deliverance he's still
[1:31:33] in the saving business he's still he's
[1:31:36] still the same God that that wants to
[1:31:38] speak to individuals and bring them to
[1:31:41] him first yes once you've come to him
[1:31:46] and your eyes of understanding are open
[1:31:48] and you've and like like John said he's
[1:31:51] the one that will baptize you with the
[1:31:53] Holy Ghost ghost you see John recognized
[1:31:56] he was baptizing them into the water he
[1:31:59] was baptizing them for for the
[1:32:00] Forgiveness of their sins but there was
[1:32:03] one that was going to come that would
[1:32:04] baptize with the Holy Ghost which is the
[1:32:07] spirit of God his own Spirit God's Own
[1:32:11] spirit in
[1:32:14] you and it's that that delivers you from
[1:32:17] your sickness it's that that delivers
[1:32:19] you from your bondage it's that that
[1:32:21] delivers you from your sin it's that
[1:32:24] that delivers you from the mental
[1:32:25] oppression and the and the and the uh
[1:32:28] mental health issues that you're going
[1:32:30] through right now it's by receiving the
[1:32:34] Holy Ghost that's why John said you need
[1:32:36] to receive the Holy Ghost he's the one
[1:32:39] that will baptize you with the Holy
[1:32:42] Ghost that's why it's so important to
[1:32:45] follow
[1:32:47] him and have the right reasons for
[1:32:50] approaching him Hallelujah praise God
[1:32:56] Amen Jesus says come and see and they go
[1:32:58] and they stay with him for the rest of
[1:33:00] the day their desire was to know him
[1:33:03] better to have a personal relationship
[1:33:05] with him because they knew that he was
[1:33:08] the Messiah the Savior the one that
[1:33:11] would bring the kingdom of God to the
[1:33:19] Earth let's go to the next
[1:33:22] slide principle number number three says
[1:33:25] when you have come into a genuine
[1:33:28] personal relationship with Jesus you
[1:33:31] just can't keep it to
[1:33:34] yourself that's a reality and anybody
[1:33:38] that's ever
[1:33:39] experienced that Born Again experience
[1:33:42] where he opens your understanding to see
[1:33:44] the word of God like you have never seen
[1:33:46] it
[1:33:47] before you know I can only share my own
[1:33:52] experience I know that you know when I
[1:33:54] came to the Lord and you've heard it
[1:33:56] many times it wasn't because I
[1:33:58] recognized that God had sent a
[1:34:01] prophet it's because I was in a
[1:34:05] condition God allowed me God allowed you
[1:34:09] and many of us to get into certain
[1:34:11] conditions in our lives where he could
[1:34:13] get our
[1:34:16] attention and when when when when he
[1:34:19] drew my attention by delivering me
[1:34:22] supernaturally from a drug
[1:34:25] addiction and then placed his Spirit
[1:34:28] upon
[1:34:30] me I became like a house on
[1:34:33] fire I couldn't help it nobody could
[1:34:36] tell me that he was not a living God
[1:34:40] because that's what we're being invited
[1:34:42] to come and
[1:34:43] see the Living
[1:34:46] God not some man-made teaching not some
[1:34:50] interpretation New Age interpretation
[1:34:52] not some Prosperity Jesus the Living
[1:34:57] God and that experience was genuine in
[1:35:01] my life to the point where for the
[1:35:04] next number of years I was a firehouse
[1:35:08] out of
[1:35:10] control people thought I was a
[1:35:14] bit out of my mind but that
[1:35:19] reality could never be taken away from
[1:35:22] me
[1:35:24] and I wanted everybody to know I wanted
[1:35:27] everybody to know that hey he's
[1:35:30] real this Jesus that they've been you
[1:35:32] know I was a kid in Catholic School in
[1:35:35] Catholic Church I was an altar boy I
[1:35:38] would go up there and I would ring those
[1:35:40] bells and I would go into the back there
[1:35:42] where the priests were and I would grab
[1:35:43] the
[1:35:45] wine as a kid and I would try to sneak
[1:35:47] some of the
[1:35:48] wine I I was
[1:35:50] living that God that they were talking
[1:35:53] about that they would do certain things
[1:35:55] about that people would talk about I
[1:35:57] never knew him but now I know him now I
[1:36:01] know that he's real now I know that he's
[1:36:03] a reality and not only that but he's got
[1:36:06] a message in this day and in this hour
[1:36:09] that is going to translate the true
[1:36:12] Christian
[1:36:13] Church out of this Dimension which by
[1:36:17] the way I don't have to tell you that
[1:36:19] the world is falling apart just turn on
[1:36:22] any news
[1:36:24] station and listen for a couple of hours
[1:36:28] and you will find out that this whole
[1:36:30] world is in chaos Wars there's serious
[1:36:35] Wars going on right now there's the
[1:36:37] biggest war taking place right now in
[1:36:40] the Middle East that is going to lead to
[1:36:43] something of mass mass
[1:36:47] tribulation that's not because I'm
[1:36:49] saying it it's because every prophecy
[1:36:52] and the way that is Israel is fulfilling
[1:36:55] prophecy has been written thousands of
[1:36:57] years ago and we can read it right in
[1:37:00] the Bible right in the in the Old
[1:37:03] Testament and in the New Testament we
[1:37:05] can read word for word exactly what is
[1:37:08] taking place right now in the world that
[1:37:11] was written thousands of years ago and
[1:37:14] exactly how it's going to play
[1:37:16] out and the reason why we can see it as
[1:37:19] clear as we do and we stand upon it is
[1:37:22] because he's placed his spirit in us to
[1:37:25] recognize the
[1:37:28] word and that's why you cannot convert
[1:37:31] people this is not about converting
[1:37:34] people to
[1:37:35] Christ this is about
[1:37:39] invitation this is about inviting them
[1:37:41] to come and
[1:37:43] see and come and
[1:37:45] experience what it is to receive the
[1:37:48] Holy Ghost I remember I remember when I
[1:37:50] started coming to church and and and and
[1:37:53] the word started to unveil itself to me
[1:37:55] and and I went to Pastor Simon and I I
[1:37:57] went directly to him and I said pastor
[1:38:00] Simon I want the Holy Ghost you've been
[1:38:03] talking about the Holy Ghost as the
[1:38:05] power it's it's what delivers it's what
[1:38:08] sets you free it it's what transforms
[1:38:11] you gives you the ability to see and to
[1:38:13] recognize I want that and he looked at
[1:38:15] me he goes brother you got it you got it
[1:38:19] it's all over you he's already done it
[1:38:23] he's awakened you but that should be the
[1:38:25] desire when when you come to Christ you
[1:38:28] should have that desire to to want his
[1:38:31] spirit in you because it's the one
[1:38:34] that's going to deliver it's the one
[1:38:36] that sets you free it's the one that's
[1:38:38] going to make this old body young again
[1:38:41] thank you Jesus it's the one that's
[1:38:44] going to change and take this Mortal and
[1:38:46] make it
[1:38:48] Immortal you either believe God's word
[1:38:50] or you don't believe God's word once you
[1:38:53] start to read the word by the Holy Ghost
[1:38:56] in you that's what the spirit says gives
[1:38:59] life to the word of God once that begins
[1:39:01] to take place everything becomes real to
[1:39:04] you everything that the word says about
[1:39:07] the change in Corinthians that in a
[1:39:10] moment in the twinkling of an eye we
[1:39:11] shall be
[1:39:13] changed and we will move from this
[1:39:15] Dimension right into another dimension a
[1:39:18] lot of people are already listen if you
[1:39:21] do your research they're already
[1:39:23] recognizing that there that there are
[1:39:26] other dimensions outside of this
[1:39:32] Dimension God has given
[1:39:35] you an
[1:39:38] attribute like a
[1:39:40] ticket that will transform
[1:39:44] you in a moment into that other
[1:39:48] dimension and then this world is going
[1:39:51] to go into total and complete complete
[1:39:56] chaos I'm going to wind it right down
[1:39:59] here and we'll continue next week listen
[1:40:02] to brother brandom
[1:40:05] here from convinced then
[1:40:08] concerned and I believe it's important
[1:40:11] that we as
[1:40:15] individuals be
[1:40:17] convinced not because somebody convinced
[1:40:19] you not because somebody you know forced
[1:40:23] you you oh you got to come to this
[1:40:25] church this is the listen yeah you want
[1:40:27] to invite them to
[1:40:29] church because you don't know what's
[1:40:31] behind that
[1:40:33] Veil you don't know if God has placed a
[1:40:36] portion of himself in there because
[1:40:38] Jesus says my sheep hear my
[1:40:42] voice no man comes to the father but by
[1:40:46] me in other words you can't come to me
[1:40:49] in the fullness unless I draw you unless
[1:40:53] I call
[1:40:54] you that's important to
[1:40:57] understand that's when you become
[1:41:01] convinced listen and these disciples
[1:41:03] brother Bram speaking here in the
[1:41:04] message convinced and concerned 1962 he
[1:41:07] says these disciples took right off
[1:41:09] after Jesus let the musicians come and
[1:41:12] he looked around he found them and he
[1:41:15] said what seek ye they said Rabbi being
[1:41:19] interpreted Master where dwellest thou
[1:41:23] he said come and see now that's a
[1:41:26] wonderful invitation come and see I like
[1:41:29] that that's what philli said to
[1:41:32] Nathaniel when Nathaniel said could
[1:41:34] there be any good thing come out of
[1:41:36] Nazareth he said come and
[1:41:38] see so then come find out don't sit at
[1:41:42] home and criticize come find out see
[1:41:46] come see for yourself now they said it
[1:41:51] now now they said
[1:41:55] it was evening
[1:41:57] time so Andrew stayed all night oh
[1:42:01] that's a good way he stayed until he was
[1:42:05] convinced what that man had told him
[1:42:08] that night what he had said to him or
[1:42:11] what he did there was something that
[1:42:13] completely convinced Andrew that he was
[1:42:16] the
[1:42:17] Messiah you see you got to stay with
[1:42:20] Jesus long enough a lot of people they
[1:42:23] just don't want to sit and listen they
[1:42:26] don't want to sit and and and and read
[1:42:30] the word of God they don't want to read
[1:42:32] the word and then go and
[1:42:34] pray you know that that's how God speaks
[1:42:37] to you I'm challenging you here today
[1:42:40] and those that are out there on on the
[1:42:43] air take the time to sit long enough to
[1:42:48] allow his voice to speak to you through
[1:42:50] the word of God and through prayer
[1:42:54] then you will become convinced that he's
[1:42:55] a
[1:42:57] reality
[1:42:58] amen and so he was the Messiah the next
[1:43:01] day really early I imagine he grabbed
[1:43:04] his coat and hat and took down cuz Peter
[1:43:07] was going to be fishing down on the
[1:43:09] river and he said come see who we found
[1:43:12] it's the Messiah he was convinced when
[1:43:15] he was perfectly convinced that it was
[1:43:18] the Messiah he was concerned about his
[1:43:21] brother oh praise God let me tell you I
[1:43:25] remember I went right to my family I I
[1:43:27] wanted every single one of my brother my
[1:43:30] sister my mom my dad we brought my
[1:43:32] mother to the church we baptized her we
[1:43:35] did everything that we you know we were
[1:43:36] concerned because you know to us this
[1:43:39] was a reality and and the world was
[1:43:42] going to start going into a a terrible
[1:43:44] condition and and Jesus was the only way
[1:43:47] true and
[1:43:50] life and so we would we would we would
[1:43:52] be so concerned we want to tell
[1:43:54] everybody just like here he says that's
[1:43:57] what's the matter tonight people are not
[1:43:59] convinced of the message people are not
[1:44:03] convinced about the Holy
[1:44:05] Ghost if you really get convinced then
[1:44:08] you're
[1:44:10] concerned you'll do everything you can
[1:44:13] do ever what you got to do with say well
[1:44:17] brother brandom I'm not a preacher well
[1:44:19] you can do something too remember one
[1:44:22] time I had a meeting there was a farmer
[1:44:24] got saved and filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:44:28] and he only had nothing but his
[1:44:30] experience with a
[1:44:32] truck but he hauled so many to the
[1:44:35] meeting he got 30 more filled with the
[1:44:37] Holy Ghost reminds me of brother Gabriel
[1:44:40] he got so blessed and anointed by the
[1:44:43] word of God that he had a van that could
[1:44:45] fit 12 13 people and I was one of those
[1:44:49] people that he put into that van and
[1:44:51] said come on man
[1:44:53] come and see what God can do amen he
[1:44:58] didn't know that I needed Deliverance he
[1:45:00] didn't know that I was that I was caught
[1:45:02] up on in a drug addiction he had no idea
[1:45:06] but Jesus knew Jesus knew the time Jesus
[1:45:09] knew the season and Jesus knows each and
[1:45:12] every one of us exactly where we're at
[1:45:15] amen praise God and he's going to use
[1:45:18] whatever you make available to him all
[1:45:21] you need to do is be become convinced
[1:45:23] first that he's a reality and he only
[1:45:27] had nothing but his experience in his
[1:45:29] truck and he hauled so many to the
[1:45:31] meeting he got 30 more filled with the
[1:45:34] Holy Ghost before why he was convinced
[1:45:37] and when he was convinced he was
[1:45:39] concerned a little daughter got healed
[1:45:42] he had sick people every night a truck
[1:45:45] full of them bringing them from
[1:45:47] everywhere got 30 got the Holy Ghost see
[1:45:51] he was convinced that it was right so he
[1:45:53] was concerned about somebody
[1:45:58] else and we're and if we are convinced
[1:46:02] that Jesus is coming
[1:46:05] soon we'll be concerned about our loved
[1:46:10] ones we'll be doing all we can to get
[1:46:16] the gospel
[1:46:19] out next week we're going to continue
[1:46:22] with this and we're going to we're going
[1:46:23] to look at the greater things that God
[1:46:26] can do and how he's doing it and we're
[1:46:29] going to bring it more I this was just
[1:46:31] to lay in a foundation of the principles
[1:46:34] and to to show you that that Jesus
[1:46:36] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:46:38] forever these principles do not change
[1:46:41] we need to come to him the right way and
[1:46:44] when we come to him the right way and we
[1:46:46] know that it's all about him then it
[1:46:48] leads us to to to you know lead others
[1:46:51] to Christ
[1:46:53] we check our motives and and we know why
[1:46:56] we've come we recognize why he's called
[1:46:59] us and we lead others in the same
[1:47:05] way this is not just about preaching the
[1:47:07] Seven
[1:47:08] Seals even though that's what we're
[1:47:12] preaching it's not about all the great
[1:47:15] Mysteries and about condemning you for
[1:47:18] the way that you're living right now and
[1:47:20] condemning you for for not recog izing
[1:47:23] this or recognizing that this is about
[1:47:26] you experiencing the love of God so that
[1:47:29] you can humble yourself before him and
[1:47:32] be filled with his spirit hallah and
[1:47:36] when that happens everything else
[1:47:38] automatically takes over that's where he
[1:47:41] starts to take over and then all of a
[1:47:43] sudden you become like Andrew these two
[1:47:46] men had previously been following John
[1:47:48] the Baptist but spending one evening
[1:47:51] with Jesus they immediately go out and
[1:47:54] tell everybody that they possibly can
[1:47:57] when's the last time you invited
[1:47:59] somebody into the house of the Lord
[1:48:01] don't be ashamed invite them don't be
[1:48:05] ashamed to come come with the right
[1:48:08] motive in your heart God will speak to
[1:48:11] you God will do something miraculous for
[1:48:14] you amen glory to God hallelujah praise
[1:48:19] God let us stand
[1:48:25] next week we're going to look at the
[1:48:27] promises of greater
[1:48:30] things
[1:48:32] amen we're going to experience some of
[1:48:36] the reality of what God wants to do in
[1:48:39] our lives and what he is doing to bring
[1:48:42] this mystical Body of Christ back in
[1:48:47] unity glory to God
