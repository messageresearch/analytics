some of you are tired but please let's shake the tiredness so that God could get the glory you will get a blessing I will get a blessing from the Lord because With God all things are possible yeah I won't delay each and every one of you time first I want us to remember our beloved pasta his precious wife and the family in prayer nice to see the coming incoming pasta Forest is coming The Mess by God's will next year I think first January he will be the pastor bro Pastor he will be Pastor Danny and mother sister Jennifer and we have to lift them up that time uh we won't call him brother Danny no more we have to call him Pastor Danny that time because it doesn't matter who God chose you have to honor the office if you don't honor the office God will not honor you I believe in that from the bottom of my heart because God is the one that we have to look into because God is up to something big it doesn't matter you or me it's all about him so I won't delay you your time I think brother timbia is not here yet right he's still on vacation he told me he was going on holidays if it's not here remember him remember Sister Deborah too and whoever has gone holidays remember them and those that are watching in the line please pay attention because God have something for you to hear this evening uh I think the brother put the scriptures is I don't have a big big um thing but God is the one that is big it's Matthew chapter 8. Verse 18 to 26. that's what the lord gave me in the scripture for this evening I'm not a big big I would say big preacher I am the least in the kingdom of God and I just preach what God placed on my heart and it's up to God to do it if he doesn't do it I cannot do it so let's go into the word uh brother Ayman can you lead us in prayer this evening before we read the God's word yes Lord yes Lord amen okay Matthew 8 chapter 8 verse 18 to 26 goes now when Jesus saw a great multitude about him he gave commandment to the path into the other side and a certain scribe came and said unto him master I will follow thee wherever whatever whatsoever thou goes and Jesus said unto him the forces have holes and the Bears of the air haveness but the son of man had nowhere to lay his head and another of his disciples said unto him Lord suffer me first to go and bury my father but Jesus said unto him follow me this is mine topic follow me and let the dead bury their dead and when he was enter into a sheep his disciple follow him and behold their rules a great Tempest in the sea and so much that the ships was covered with the wave but he was asleep and his disciples come to him and awoke him saying Lord save us we perish and he said unto them why are you Faithful o e of Little Feet then he arose and rebuke the waves and the Sea and there was a great camp please be seated may the Lord add his Blessing God does not change about his word his word Remains the same thing today brother Brown says God is his own interpreter and he make his work plain Before You and I God Don't Need No Man to interpret his word but obedient to his word you and I will bring the word to fulfill the way God has ordained so when God was here that time I believe so many that were following him didn't know who he was they thought he was just ordinary man just preacher a poor maybe preacher and he says to them follow me right is the same thing today when God is saying we should follow him a true preacher when he is preaching if you don't watch it his preaching will be like a dictatorship or command because when you take it literary because they are preaching always look like command because they are not if it's a true send by God chosen by God he is rather pointing you to go Jesus Christ he's not pointing you to himself but he's preaching and his way if you don't watch it and you take it Canna it will look like oh who is this man telling me to follow him that's why you read the scriptures the Bible says some of disciples when Jesus accept you eat my flesh drink my blood you have no part in me some just walk away tear the crowd they follow him no more thank you my brother why because they were looking to a man but they were not seeing what was behind that skin because when you recognize God voice God Waits is opposite towards man wisdom mankind wisdom that's why he says my ways my wisdom is foolishness to the world God wisdom is foolishness to the world because why it always appeared like dictatorship when he's in a voice when you speak he looked very powerful very precise follow obey I'm not talking about wordless speaking at work or at somebody who wanted you are in Military and they are telling you obey that is man part telling you to obey take it spiritually when God servants are speaking they speak with authority because they know who they are and they know who is behind them they know who ascended their purposes and their ways is follow follow because if you follow all you're gonna see you won't see the man you will see Jesus but if you are thinking who is this man talking like this who is this bullheaded or who is this excuse me to say naturally he may look like dummy outside talking to you who is this ignorant person or literature Domino too much educated man because God can use any or Christ of people then you take that upon yourself and you walk away then you have become like you remember Naomi have a root and the other one was uh root and oh the name doesn't come they were twin they were two uh oppa is it oppa unless I go in the scripture anyway there were two by root hooked to Naomi the other one gave now uh now uh Naomi kiss and left because he was not seeing what it was about to happen and so is it today we have to look into the voice of God because all you need is not a man a man can do nothing one time when God looked down Every Man Has sinned against God all Humanity has sinned come short before God God was looking for one person to save mankind did he God maybe the pope because he wear white clothes so he could save us the pope couldn't get become holy to save us the Kings in the air none of them he took the Lamb of God which is the the Lord Jesus Christ and all he's saying to us in this last days I am here you that are my wife I chose you before I created heaven and earth I told you before the foundations of this world if you want to know that so I have placed myself already in you and when I'm speaking through a body don't look at the natural part Look Away to the voice because my word is spirit and life and the series already the root of David portion of the root of David is already in you so you allowed your heart to open so that when the spirit wanted to speak to you you can recognize it whatever the spirit is saying to you so that you move because otherwise you're not able to catch the words that pertain to you for your day your message because too many educated when I say educated I don't mean somebody that has finished University alone some people who can read and write knows all the quotes of brother Abraham knows all the quotes in the Bible try to use that and hide behind the pulpit and deceive but I have all my children in the palms of my arm not one of you is going to be lost not one of you is going to be anyone can deceive you because you know what my word is spirit and life you were with me before the foundations of this world so you know my voice you know how I behave how I do things because when I speak it will break your heart Satan always take the mind but I took the heart the god that we serve is an unchangeable God he always will ask you follow me sometimes you'll hear his voice by quiet place sometimes he comes to you by a sister talking to you sometime he come to you by even a stranger a drunker a prostitute right I remember the time I was traveling in my life first time of going to Europe I don't know nobody to turn to as soon as I enter the praying I look it was at that time it was DC-10 they don't have it no more and I entered a plane a thought says I saw a prostitute girl and a thought says go and ask her a question so that he will help you I didn't doubt I just went and spoke and believe me it was a blessing to be because he helped me through his boy that was a pimp they helped me out make my my journey easy have a place to sleep in Germany which I didn't know anybody they helped me and showed me always till I could know my way out so tomb up to the voice of God then you can follow where he's living because if you don't do like that and you're gonna learn to man opinions when I say man opinions those that know the letters but they don't have the root of David in them the seed of God in them they're gonna deceive you we are in the hour when it's so dark but I want to tell you there is a man here who has turned on the light his name is the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and he is calling his own he is speaking to his own as we all know in here we have heard so much God is pouring himself so much in the way of fight for Ministry even if you look at me a little little like a little baby in the word of God but let me tell you you may say I'm small yes I am but the way God has poured himself if you have an eye to see you can see what God has done how much more our brothers that are capable you're talking about teaching we are brothers here that God has raised they teach you talking about a if you are in problem we have brothers here that God will use them to solve the problem in the word of God you talking about encouragement we are brothers here that God who has raised their preaching will encourage you so there's nothing lack for you our God is saying follow because in the time of Joshua there was no nonsense there was nobody all the slack all the lukewarm all the Egyptian Garrick have to fall away from the Israelites and they have to follow Joshua so that and who is the Joshua the Holy Spirit you may think I'm talking about man yes but it's not real man I'm speaking to I'm speaking to you as brothers and sisters that we we get serious and followed away because the word is your leader the word is your guide the word is your absolute so when I said Joshua I mean the Holy Spirit he is the one that leading us so follow me when you follow your own lack of nothing when you follow everything gonna be all right but when you don't follow you're always going to have problems don't lean to your own understanding all your ways acknowledge Him and he shall direct your path because it's unchangeable God the god of brother Abraham brother Abraham is dead he's gone for his reward but the holy spirit that let him and preach and message the world have never seen at this 20th century that Holy Spirit is still here today that power of God is still here today it doesn't matter what you need put it before the Lord listen whether it's even leading you to the Grave don't be scared he's with you he won't forsake you he will not forsake you listen God is God no matter what he does he is right absolute right so we have to obey when we obey everything gonna come up right sometimes they want you to get sick so that you could even share his word with somebody some people you want them to be rich you will see in your lifetime sometime money will come to your hands because he wants you to go to places or touch some people's life because he know what he's doing so let us not backslide but follow the Holy Spirit because Joshua is here our Joshua who gonna lead us into the Rapture is here because this is not the day of brother Abraham time brother Brahm died in 1965. but Joshua is here to do the job Joshua is just spreading his wing the eagle is spreading his wing and calling us that I am here I am in charge I am control I have you in the palms of my hand I will take you through I will lead you wherever your footstep I have given to you because you are mine don't be afraid be be courage don't be so thinking that you are nothing you are somebody you are somebody in my eye I love you that's why I came to Calvary and share my Broad they beat me they reject me they prosecuted me they stripped me naked and put me on the cross I am here again because of you because of you I'll share my broad I'm not gonna let no man deceive my children when I say let there be light who go and eat and bring the light I the Lord let the light appear that's the way I do my things that's the way I'm gonna do my work I'm doing my work that way so open up your heart don't look for personalities big man because God doesn't deal with that God deal with his seed and he deal with how he has ordained the person the person may come you may not like him because he doesn't preach the way you want but it doesn't matter look if God is inside what he's saying because Jesus is the one that ordained ordain doesn't come from man can pray for you man can tell you I ordain you but if your ordain didn't come from the father that dwell in Jesus you better watch out because it is him that ordained it is him that position and replace his people and whoever he choose then we have to obey as he has chose our brother let me tell you he who have I know that yes God has chose we are not we are not babies I am not a some chicken that gonna scratch the ground the Holy Spirit knows me and I know him I know God is weak I have met God listen me even I do the Lord have to drag me here because I'm not a hypocrite I'm not people that wanted to get in the pool brother I just speak my heart okay my heart I'm not a hypocrite I tell the truth God knows whom he has chosen as we the church move on line up if you know you don't line up line up because God won't permitted us to fool around God will not permit you to fool around even me to fool around he's gonna mean business the scripture have to fulfill what he has spoken true brother Braham is now in US he been sowing his seed in US and that seed have to come Plain View that seed have to come pray with you otherwise is just a joke and a bluff and a lot of talk because God have to do he says I will do a quick and a short week that quick and a short work is coming upon us to fulfill it the hour is at hand too many people want a joke even check they don't want to come they don't want to come to church listen they put you in Ukraine fight they put you in the front you're gonna go there and sleep you're not going there to sleep then Russia bomb work hit your head and you'll die you have to make sure there's the bullet they give you you are shooting because Satan doesn't sleep he's shooting so you have you're gonna have to be Sharp to fire if you can fire Satan will fire you one day maybe God help me and I get here I'll bring a message about that if you don't fire your man go Satan will fire you because the gun need to be fire this is not a Time the gun gonna be on the wall we are coming to a time when the gun needs to be fired fire the enemy because the enemy is not sleeping but he looked like we human being sometimes we get lost because our eye can see nothing I remember one time we came to prayer meeting the Lord came down he says I'm trying to call every one of you to come to my presence you are sleeping you are not coming to my presence because your eye cannot see what is going on you your eye can see through this this war but if I open your eye to see what is coming after you you run to me all the time the world is in such a turmoil the churches has rejected Christ churches a lot of them has rejected Christ so the spirit of God where God has got the people that has taken the prophet message seriously a preacher that has surrendered his heart that is ordained then God is serious about his way God is serious about you God is serious about you your own children it's time if you haven't repent and baptize you sitting in the church you're looking at me get yourself into the water no time to joke no time to fool around no time to mess around it's dark out there the spirit of God is calling because we don't know when the dog will close I I don't know when the door will close but brothers and sister is getting dark all over the Earth it looked like they are coming after us go to fill the pressure don't you see the squeeze that is in the world economical pressure religious even pressure people don't want to come to church it looked like the preacher have to beg them the preacher have to drag them brother no say are you with Christ or you are with the world Joshua said are you with us or are you against us if you are with us stand behind beside Joshua and God will bless you God didn't call us for picnic this road is not a picnic game it's not a picnic game it's not something you are here today you gone tomorrow we woman being that's the way we want to do things but God is saying no follow don't question follow the word that comes here follow it let me tell you God knows my heart today I wasn't thinking of come and preach that by last minute I as soon as my my eyes saw that scripture I started feeling and I know the way God deal with me I feel that's the way you give me him he says that's the scripture so I just says yes Lord I don't know how I'm gonna speak but as I get here I am so trusted in him that whatever he want me to speak he will come and speak otherwise I am just dumbing and I'm gonna make a mess but I pour my heart the best that the Lord knows if there is anything he doesn't like he should take it from me because I want to help my brothers and sisters because I want us all of us to team up in Christ so that all of us will go into heaven because I don't want one to be lacked behind I don't want to stay behind I I don't want to miss the tree I don't want you to miss the trade you young ones all young I want all of us to go because you know why they always late it's late it's late Jesus is calling he's telling us follow if you follow I will lead you through how you gonna do it it's not by education is not by raising some people are literate but they raising more than educated people I know that because I meet her they are illiterate but they will raising you more than educated person because remember everything is a spirit as a woman being Spirits in US conspiraciness don't need education it's a spirit devil have you ever seen devil spirit that go to university he says I sit here I'm a devil and I'm gonna study and get my PhD no we human beings steady by the spirit in that person if it's a devil is a devil born as a devil so raising the Risen what am I trying to say I'm trying to say we don't have to question nothing just be like a cow either way that is coming How You Gonna produce make the cow either glasses he produce milk at the end of the year for his master Jesus expects you to follow when you follow and obey he will do the work you're gonna see signs and wonders coming out from you once you either wear the word gonna produce that for you to see you're gonna see healings coming out from you you're gonna see wisdom coming out from you you're gonna see patient coming out from you you're gonna see all kinds of God wisdom God intelligent to the world is foolishness but all gonna flow through you but if you don't eat away a kind because you know why God gonna ask you to do certain things no man can do no educated person with his Education wisdom will do that because God will tell you okay you see this house go said something to the person and maybe if you are rich let's say he sent you to the poor person please that place think that place you never enter the womb that room before the Lord is sending you there and if you are going you have to hold your nose would you go if you just reason about it me Rich Man like this why would I go or poor go to the rich people please tell them Point their finger and tell the person something would you go me poor person how can I go talk to this Rich would he respond to me you see you're gonna reason the word out in your life but if you allow Jesus take over brother let me tell you sometimes he take you to even King you speak the word with boldness as the word he put in your mouth whether it's poor place you speak the word with boldness because you have no reason you have become like a baby a child a child doesn't raise me they do things they don't raisin says this that figure it out this way that way this wisdom but they speak and do things like animal in the bush I always said when they are thirsty there is something guiding they just follow they go and they drink and they fool if they are sick have you ever seen yesterday as matter of fact I saw a friend dog he was walking with the dog the dog saw me I was walking he fall down he lay down like that he started eating glasses the glasses and I was the owner they don't have no idea about what the dog was doing but me being back home used a dog as a child and I see the way dog behave I knew the dog is chewing the glasses maybe he's from he's going through some pain or something so he's chewing the glasses so that he'll go and lay down later then he will get healed and drink water and he will get healed right so I told him you wanna he's hiring the dog to go I says no don't do that to the dog what he's doing is right I know what he's doing he's chewing the glasses you see he doesn't raise him he obey his master we call it a nature right that's the way God want to use you and me by faith Abel offer unto God more excellent sacrifice than what came and God testify of what his gift if we obey God will do things to us Small Voice you hear him speaking sometimes you speak loud sometimes you come to church he will use a brother to speak something even against you and he hate you why did the brother say that God is trying you you elect resistors say something and you know what the person that you love from the bottom of your heart God knows your heart more than anybody even more than the pastor more than the contrast to anybody I don't know your heart you don't know my heart God no so he does that to try you to see you love him and if you true love him you may not understand but be patient that's the time God wanted to reveal himself to you if you have patience God will show you things then it will be a blessing to you because he's trying to pull you out from your mess because we human being we have things hidden in our heart and we cover it up and we become like a you see a cat a cat meow meow you see that one when you rub it all the clock going and it's stay calm but if you don't rub it good then you see all the crow come out and if you don't take time power right so God knows some of us better than ourselves we have a cat Spirit hidden day and you want to get it out so he will let a sister or brother come to you with that to pull that cat Spirit out and what are you gonna do to see whether you love him remember one says my father is dead Lord I want to go and bury my father Jesus knowing the heart he says Let the dead bury their dead you think he's easy even right now your pastor that preaching to you Pastor I'm going to bury my my dad the pastor look at you tell the dead Meridian dead me that kind of Pastor I'm not going to that church no more out there that Pastor speak to me like that it's a test is a test for you okay it's a test he's watching your reaction but if you are patient because God wants to reveal things to you God wants to show himself to you then you get angry and you leave no not if you're a True Believer you get angry you can even go but a little while you are coming back you will come back because God has already spoken about you before you came to this earth listening if I look since I'm here what people have done to me in this church I wouldn't even stay here one hour I will be gone I'm not lying to you I'll be number one to leave things even while you are in the world you know the worldly people they are playing if they're gonna chop your head off they will Chop It Off but sometimes Christians will look like pilot outside clean and we walk like this but meanwhile that snake is ready like in Ghana one person I met assess was a taxi driver I said it before I said how are you he says Oh by God's grace I'm fine I says oh God bless you for that I says I'm going this place how much you want to charge me I'll find out the price says I want to charge you 35. and the the price is 18. and I I turn around and tell him why is it that you have put Jesus in your lips but back of your tone you have put the Cobra there right you have put a code right there like once you said Oh by God's grace I'm all right you want me to lay down and there's so many in the message are doing that in this message so God wants you to open your heart to him when you open your eye to him he show you things right then you see so follow Christ Paul said follow me as I follow Christ but if I don't follow Christ then why are you gonna follow me right if the pastor is following Christ follow him if he doesn't follow Christ out of the door you're gone because it's not a man you're gonna serve it's not a man you're gonna bow down to we are not in Africa where the king sit in the throne or England I can enjoy you go those that are around him they go over their days like that no no or like the pope and all the Cardinal you have to go no no no no no no God that God word is not like that and I'm not putting them down that is the world the way the world live their life but God we have to obey God we have to follow Christ we have to allow them to do his job we have to let him have his way in our life because we are brothers and sisters when you see a true brother or a true sister that the holy spirit is heading you tell them sister I love you in Christ the brother you tell them I love you in Christ because we are all going one place you see black there you see why there you see in the other day you see Chinese there you see all Spanish there you will see all kinds of race so why should you hate one another we have to love one another as the days approach more than anything because Jesus Says by this all men all men may know you are my disciple because if we love one another the pastor job become what easy do know that done there's no competition There Is No Lack because if I'm seeing the pastor is maybe sick and I'm close I'm just using as example I'm not saying any past I say I'll go give him a call and say Pastor can I I see you for a long time can I do something for you what do you want me to do what do you want me to do oh brother I'm so sick I can't come to church so tell the brothers for me you come to church you see the whole floor dirty nobody have to tell you oh I'm not cleaning it what kind of spirit is upon you is that the Holy Spirit you do it put your sincere heart because you know what you're not doing it for man are you doing it for popularity popularity will get you nowhere let me tell you me popularity I don't want even what did I have I always said it naturally speaking and I will speak a little dummy what are you gonna I can offer you do tell me in the world nothing I can offer you the only thing that I the Lord by his grace I'm standing here by Jesus Christ Grace not a man because I know what he has done for me so I'm doing it with gratitude towards him all I want from him is when I go there he will say die good and faithful servant that word that saving God my brother Stephen dead that's all I require brother this bullheaded required that from the Lord if you don't know you don't want that I want that that is my degree I want it from the Lord so I pour my heart so that when I read that that will be my degree okay oh yes that will be my degree because nothing I came here with nothing you came here with who born naked you go naked Abigail was telling me at the hospital they said one girl when he's going he is coming like he go and release her and not knowing he had cancer he's so sick and the cancer they treat her a gun he finished University the cancer came back the doctors told her they can't do nothing for her you know she told them inject me let me die he took injection and died have you seen he is gone but God allowed you to see because you're young kids you think you have a long time you don't it's the grace of God keeping you if not the grace of God sometimes you see a young guy and 90 years man is still alive 90 years old woman still alive and the young died baby died so you don't know when you'll be caught to stand in front of your master so allowed him to do what he wanted to do with you now now is your time now is God calling you now God wants you to worship him now God wants you to serve him now God wanted to possess you let me tell you God house there is more food Miracles you want acid husband you need as if wife you need ask him money one asking God is Not shorty of anything in his house there is more abundance when he created this well there is nothing here don't listen to those media mice and the economical days and they tell you oh this is short what is short nothing is sharp nothing is sharp God gave us more abundance if we trust him and Obey him he will supply our need I know God has done it for me one time there was no food in my cave my house my wife was beginning to shake that time I went to Africa for Michigan and came back the Lord is my witness my wife was telling me what dick is going to eat what do we have I said I have we have Jesus keep on trouble me I'm trying to lay down quiet shaking me and I says honey listen I don't have money God put into my heart to go missing I have gone what he told me to do I do whether I have we don't have he will provide and I'm trusting in Him and I don't mean I'm telling you I didn't have one saying and my wife began to panic begin to shake me like that I wake up all of a sudden I try to open my mouth The Voice spoke without saying the Lord God Almighty tomorrow there will be money in this house and it was like they pour water on me I started crying like a baby and I left when my wife saw that he left me alone never bothered me the next day I just wake up going to work The Voice told her pick up your bank book he would pick up the bamboo he says go to bank our bank is TD Bank he went there you look the bank book zero but the thought told her oh to the bank says go to the cashier he went in front of the cashier he put it there the cashier I said how much you want says oh I need hundred dollars and the lady just check give it a hundred did what you have to do my wife opened the bank book almost 4 000 in the account my wife was panicking where did this money come from because God has spoken if you trust him we don't trust him enough if you sitting in this message and you are short other God is trying you that I know I've got been there where haven't I been I've been there let me tell you for me I don't talk by lips I have seen God In Action in my life one thing I know I may not quote brother Brown there is that that that but I have put the tape that I listened to that little bit that I can he has given me to read I have seen him in action in my life and I'm telling you from my heart my wife begin to believe that only God can do it sometime even our car I have to speak before the car come no money not even one cent in our pocket I'm not talking I have maybe thousand there or 500 there not even at one cent but I'm speaking my kids are laughing at me Oh Daddy you dream too much I said let me tell you I believe God the god of brought Abraham I believe in and he come on the scene then as they give me the car I have seen him going to places where people challenge me my my and on back on the wall like this and I say Lord you know me I'm completely literate but I believe you you have brought me so mad things that Lord I want my brothers and sisters to see God in a scheme that's what I believe I don't want God in the book for God in the book formed us that one even all the churches know God in the book form but God in reality God in action the god of brother Abraham is always in what I see that's what attracts the people and if we surrender God will be in action God some of you sitting you don't know the gifts that is hidden in you some of us sitting here you don't know the gifts that God has placed in you until you fully surrender when you surrender you come on the scene do what you even don't think I never see I always say this uh we are all here I never see Pastor someone interpret my language but in Ghana I saw it and the time the brother that was asking even saw it all of a sudden he broke on song on him in my language let me tell you when the Holy Spirit is singing through somebody is different than you get up yes as you wanna sing and the Holy Spirit is not told you to sing when Holy Spirit tell you sing it is different those that one know God gonna see this as God imagine the god of brother Abraham gonna shake us you want to let us know him because he has trained us the pillow fire came to this church because the man that God chose to preach this gospel was ordained before the foundations of this world when a man is ordained God showed a pill of Fire otherwise do that man shut up quiet because God does not lie he doesn't fool around God is playing View anybody can talk but when God talk is different when God speak is different when brother Abraham was here and the angel of the Lord was standing beside him he says listening I can not speak all your your knowledge and things but God told me I will do this I'll do this I'll preach this that that and you is in the table in the book you go listen but what I have preached the serpent seed one God baptizing Jesus name woman shouldn't put up this man should do this that on my Doctrine you call me here in Chicago to question me if I have said lie let one of you come here and challenge who who dead can come out because why God has sent a man nor a man talking when a man is talking is different and when God is speaking is different our pasta pillow fight the eagle came on Rosedale on the church some of us we were there when it came on the signboard supernatural use everybody's could see the brother that took even he you could see him he was like this after he took not too long he gone but God prove it I am with him this church is not a regular Church anybody can call themselves message action and get people with their knowledge and gather at them because of psychology or things I will leave you in a few minutes but let me tell you when God has chosen servant okay he has chosen those that have I can see those who have no eye cannot see but we who are they not by man let me tell you me I'm I don't get here because I want to preach I don't get here because I have even knowledge it was God that told me or he says you I'll never let you read our right the day God showed to brother Peter is calling me to Pope or the Peter cry like a baby he cried like a baby he took the Bible at his brother they are going to hear him and he was crying said brother if you have told me this is on you I will never believe you and he says people should watch out God hiding in Simplicity reveal himself in simplicity because me I don't know why God will even choose me to come here he told me he says I'm bringing you here and he says when I put it here speak your mind whatever I put in you don't be looking at people look to me I am God I have told you I have called you anybody challenge it I will come and show that it is me the Lord because you you don't know but I the Lord God no offense I chose you you didn't choose yourself don't even introduce yourself so therefore fear not human beings I know your heart every one of you sitting here God knows your heart God knows me if I'm saying things for popularity if I'm saying things to puffed off if I'm saying things to put some people down may the Lord forgive me and forgive you but let me tell you that's the last thing I'll ever do so Pastor Simon has brought his heart but the battle the Baton is Gonna Change to our precious brother let us follow him as soon as he take the Baton be like when Joshua has taken the Baton and
