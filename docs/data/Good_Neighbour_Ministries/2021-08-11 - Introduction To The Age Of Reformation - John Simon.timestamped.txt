[1:55] as i open the bible to revelation
[1:59] chapter 2
[2:01] 3 sorry
[2:03] reading from verse 1.
[2:06] if you'll open your bible
[2:09] then we will read together
[2:13] and on to the angel of the church in
[2:17] sardis
[2:18] write
[2:20] these things sayeth he
[2:23] that had the seven spirits of god
[2:27] and
[2:28] the seven stars
[2:31] i know thy works
[2:34] that thou hast the name
[2:37] that thou livest and are dead
[2:41] be watchful
[2:43] and strengthen the things which remain
[2:48] that are ready to die
[2:51] for i have not found thy works perfect
[2:55] before god
[2:58] remember therefore
[3:01] how thou has received
[3:04] and heard
[3:05] and hold fast
[3:08] and repent
[3:11] if therefore thou shalt not watch
[3:15] i will come on to thee as a thief
[3:19] and thou shalt not know
[3:22] what are i will come upon thee
[3:27] thou asked a few names
[3:29] even in sardis which have not defiled
[3:34] their garments
[3:37] and they shall walk with me and white
[3:41] for they are worthy
[3:44] he that overcome it
[3:46] the same shall be clothed in white
[3:50] raiment
[3:51] and i will not blot out his name
[3:56] out of the book of
[3:58] life but i will confess his name
[4:03] before my father
[4:05] and before his angels
[4:08] he that had an ear to hear
[4:11] let him hear
[4:13] what the spirit
[4:15] said
[4:16] unto the churches
[4:18] a gracious god and heavenly father
[4:23] as we introduce this profoundly
[4:26] important subject
[4:30] may our hearts and minds father
[4:34] be
[4:34] saturated
[4:36] with the drenching reigns of the holy
[4:39] spirit
[4:41] we pray father that our understanding
[4:44] will be expanded our understanding will
[4:46] be opened up and the word of god will
[4:50] find fertile ground unprepared soil
[4:55] to thee be all the glory
[4:58] and the honor and the praise
[5:01] for we ask it all in no other name but
[5:04] that wonderful matchless and glorious
[5:07] name of our all conquering christ
[5:10] our lord jesus
[5:12] whom we live and serve to him be glory
[5:16] and honor
[5:17] now and forevermore
[5:20] amen and amen
[5:25] sardis
[5:28] sardis of course my friends
[5:32] was this great city
[5:36] here in asia
[5:38] minor
[5:41] but sardis which
[5:44] was once
[5:46] the capital of ancient lydia
[5:49] and was ruled by
[5:52] the lydians
[5:54] it passed from
[5:56] lydian monarchy
[5:59] to the hands of persian
[6:02] royalty
[6:05] and then fro from persian royalty
[6:10] it was conquered
[6:12] by alexander the great
[6:17] and alexander the great held it for a
[6:21] while
[6:23] until finally
[6:25] the city was sacked
[6:27] by antiochus
[6:30] the great
[6:33] this was followed by the
[6:36] rule
[6:37] of the kings of pergamos
[6:43] then the romans came
[6:46] just a bit later
[6:49] and took it over
[6:51] completely
[6:53] and began
[6:54] to rule
[6:58] now
[6:58] in the time of tiberius
[7:04] we find that that's the city
[7:07] was desolated
[7:10] by
[7:10] earthquakes
[7:13] and
[7:14] plagues began to ravage
[7:18] the city
[7:19] of sardius
[7:22] and today
[7:23] we find that great city a heap of ruins
[7:28] and uninhabited
[7:32] of course
[7:33] that
[7:35] the history of this city
[7:38] as we look back to it
[7:41] it was of a
[7:43] very important
[7:45] uh it was of commercial importance
[7:48] if important not just to
[7:52] asia malaya
[7:53] the mediterranean
[7:55] uh
[7:56] those areas but it was very important in
[8:00] the
[8:01] uh economy
[8:03] of the then known world
[8:07] we find out that there
[8:12] was invented plenty the great speaks of
[8:15] this
[8:17] how
[8:18] that
[8:19] wool dying the dying of wool
[8:23] and the weaving
[8:25] of carpets
[8:28] was
[8:29] actually invented in that area and it
[8:32] was a center of dying and weaving
[8:38] also in the area it was noted
[8:42] for the vast amounts of silver and gold
[8:46] that could be mined out of the area
[8:51] and as a
[8:52] result gold coins were first
[8:57] minted
[8:58] in sardis
[9:00] now all this sounds like i'm just giving
[9:03] you
[9:03] uh natural
[9:05] facts that may be found in history books
[9:10] but when we get to the application
[9:15] on the understanding of these inferences
[9:19] and these
[9:20] indications we will have a crystal clear
[9:24] understanding
[9:26] of what god
[9:28] is trying to say to us
[9:30] but i am just now laying the foundations
[9:34] for the rest
[9:36] of this study that is to come
[9:39] next week
[9:41] and the weeks that are ahead
[9:46] also in this city of sardis
[9:50] there were there was also a great slave
[9:54] market
[9:56] one of their commercial enterprises
[9:59] was
[10:00] in slavery
[10:03] enslaving other human beings
[10:08] but not was not only was this city
[10:12] one of commercial importance
[10:16] it was also
[10:18] one of
[10:20] a religion
[10:22] it was also a religious city
[10:26] but in particular
[10:29] this
[10:30] city
[10:32] uh based itself
[10:35] on the religion
[10:37] of siboli
[10:40] now simile
[10:43] was their goddess
[10:46] sibley
[10:47] this woman this female representation
[10:52] was their
[10:54] divinity that their worship
[10:57] let me repeat
[10:58] they
[10:59] had a religion of woman worship
[11:03] the worship
[11:05] of sibo lee
[11:08] now the meaning of her name
[11:12] it means earth's mother
[11:15] she was a nature goddess
[11:19] that encouraged the worship of nature
[11:22] and the divinity and deity of earth
[11:25] that we all came from the earth and she
[11:28] was
[11:28] mother earth
[11:30] and so
[11:32] goddess of the earth
[11:34] she was recognized and worshipped
[11:38] as civilly
[11:40] their goddess
[11:42] and prayed to
[11:45] and served
[11:46] in every possible way
[11:50] now this religion
[11:52] was one
[11:53] of impure worship
[11:56] you'll read even in your bible amongst
[11:59] the various prophets and if you were to
[12:02] read other pagan histories you'll find
[12:05] out that they
[12:06] love to have their worship in in groves
[12:10] and gardens and
[12:12] and and uh had all manner of
[12:16] according to
[12:17] dr barnes
[12:19] of the barnes new testament in his notes
[12:23] he says
[12:25] that
[12:27] the inhabitants of the city of sardis
[12:31] had a bad reputation
[12:34] amongst the
[12:36] ancients of that day
[12:40] their reputation
[12:42] was one
[12:44] of lust
[12:46] and licentiousness
[12:50] it all flowed from this
[12:53] religion
[12:55] of civilly
[12:58] lust
[13:00] licentiousness
[13:03] sexual
[13:05] crimes of evil
[13:07] took place
[13:09] under the guise of religion
[13:12] because of the worship
[13:14] of this
[13:15] so-called
[13:17] goddess
[13:19] the massive ruins of course of this
[13:22] temple
[13:23] may still be seen
[13:26] at this particular time
[13:29] you will recall when we talked we
[13:31] studied the pergamus church aged
[13:35] we mentioned about the connection
[13:40] to
[13:40] babylonious
[13:42] religion
[13:44] where with from the
[13:46] dim an ancient past
[13:49] within the midst of time
[13:53] you will remember
[13:55] how we spoke of the
[13:57] mother and son
[13:59] religion
[14:01] that came out from babylon
[14:05] and of course some weeks ago we talked
[14:09] about the waters or the religions that
[14:13] flowed out from these rivers of babylon
[14:17] and now
[14:19] in the present time of course we are
[14:21] encircled everywhere
[14:24] by every manner of the denomination
[14:28] that flowed out from this
[14:31] mother of mystery
[14:33] mother of confusion
[14:35] mother of chaos
[14:37] hear me friends
[14:39] as we look into god's word
[14:42] think pray
[14:45] believe
[14:46] and ask god to direct you
[14:51] listen
[14:52] not just saying
[14:55] uh i listened to what brother simon says
[14:59] search the scriptures
[15:01] for in them you think you have eternal
[15:05] life
[15:06] just don't have to take any man's word
[15:09] for it
[15:10] for god says let every man's word be a
[15:13] liar
[15:15] and my word be true
[15:17] may the words of god stand forever
[15:21] miss the tests of time
[15:23] may all the hammers become worn out and
[15:26] broken
[15:28] and the anvil of god's word remain
[15:32] stands to eternity from eternity to
[15:35] eternity
[15:38] this mother and son
[15:44] religion
[15:45] that
[15:46] issued out from
[15:49] babylon
[15:51] down
[15:52] through the various nations
[15:56] and the names of the god and goddess
[15:59] mother
[16:00] uh and son
[16:03] will change as it
[16:05] went from country to country
[16:09] but when it all comes back together it's
[16:12] actually the same goddess
[16:16] with our same son
[16:19] now
[16:20] spread out to many other nations
[16:24] who call them by the various names
[16:28] one area that may be called uh semiramis
[16:32] another area astate
[16:34] another area venus
[16:37] but whatever the names
[16:40] the
[16:42] history and mythology
[16:45] uh and the
[16:47] lies
[16:48] that surround this
[16:50] all comes together
[16:52] us pointing back to these this one
[16:55] mother
[16:56] and son
[16:59] later as we
[17:01] go into our
[17:02] study you will see how
[17:05] this
[17:07] babylonish religion
[17:10] was able to
[17:13] study and look into the christian
[17:15] religion
[17:17] and be able to subvert it
[17:20] twist it
[17:22] and to be able to apply
[17:25] the names
[17:27] of their babylonious
[17:30] gods and goddesses
[17:33] transferring them into christianity
[17:37] then
[17:38] beginning to use christian names
[17:43] on these false goddesses and gods
[17:48] now turned into saints
[17:51] now turned into holy ones
[17:55] using christian names
[17:59] and many
[18:00] christians
[18:02] being deceived
[18:05] by this invasion of paganism into
[18:08] christianity
[18:11] are now
[18:12] worshipping
[18:15] using christian terminology
[18:18] but in actual fact
[18:21] their worship has is
[18:23] is pagan worship under the guise and
[18:28] cloak of christianity
[18:33] and babylon of course
[18:37] civilian
[18:38] was called
[18:40] semiramis
[18:44] and the sun was called nina's
[18:48] here in sardis
[18:51] she's called not simiramis but siboli
[18:54] but it's the same
[18:56] deity the same
[18:58] goddess the same person
[19:01] and the son was called the aussie
[19:05] yourself
[19:07] in asia
[19:08] same ones
[19:11] my friends
[19:13] now
[19:14] the very attributes
[19:18] that were attached
[19:21] to these two
[19:22] in babylon
[19:25] are the same attributes
[19:28] attributed to siboli and her son diovios
[19:33] now
[19:34] in asia minor
[19:37] and later we will see
[19:40] that it's the same attributes
[19:43] that have been transferred
[19:45] on down through the centuries
[19:49] right into our day where they're given
[19:54] christian names
[19:57] first of all
[19:59] when we compare them side by side
[20:02] it's very enlightening
[20:06] it's very
[20:07] eye-opening
[20:09] so let us take a look at it right now
[20:14] according to the mystery religions of
[20:16] babylon
[20:19] he was the sun god
[20:23] and
[20:24] she the mother
[20:26] was the moon goddess
[20:29] think while i'm speaking
[20:31] and make applications in your own
[20:34] thoughts
[20:35] in your own mind
[20:37] to who is called uh the moon the mother
[20:42] of the moon or the moon goddess
[20:45] and he being the s-u-n
[20:48] god
[20:51] he was called
[20:52] the lord of heaven
[20:56] she was called
[20:58] this is back way back
[21:01] in babylon she was called the queen
[21:04] of heaven
[21:08] he was called
[21:10] the revealer
[21:12] of goodness
[21:13] and
[21:14] of truth
[21:17] she
[21:18] was called
[21:21] the one of gentleness
[21:24] and of mercy
[21:28] he was called the mediator
[21:32] she was called
[21:36] their mediated tricks
[21:40] listen
[21:42] he was always pictured
[21:47] with the keys before him
[21:51] and saying
[21:53] that he opens
[21:56] and shuts the gates
[21:59] of the invisible world
[22:03] she
[22:05] was identified also or pictured
[22:09] with the identical keys as if she had
[22:13] the same power to open and shut
[22:16] as much as the sun
[22:20] he
[22:21] called himself the judge of the dead
[22:26] and she is pictured as standing by his
[22:29] side
[22:30] along with him to judge the dead
[22:36] it is told
[22:39] that their son god
[22:42] was
[22:43] dead was killed
[22:46] dead
[22:48] and raised up from the dead
[22:51] and then ascended into heaven
[22:56] and that she the mother
[22:59] was carried
[23:00] bodily into heaven by her son
[23:06] now of course in rome
[23:09] that same title
[23:11] is being given to our lord
[23:15] to our lord jesus
[23:17] is given the title
[23:20] not called openly plainly
[23:24] but it's part of their mystery
[23:27] moving and changing from s
[23:30] u n
[23:31] god
[23:33] not much of a change
[23:36] of them saying
[23:37] yes
[23:38] we believe jesus is the son
[23:42] s o n of god
[23:46] he is called the son of god
[23:50] and
[23:51] she is called now
[23:53] the mother of god
[23:55] i want you to think of what
[23:57] us uh we said to you
[24:00] and brought to you
[24:01] and now apply this in your heart and in
[24:04] your thoughts
[24:08] amen
[24:09] yes sir
[24:12] she's called the mother of god
[24:16] of course we know that is impossible for
[24:18] if for if
[24:19] a god is god
[24:22] who has no beginning no ending
[24:26] no beginning no ending
[24:29] if he had a mother then the mother would
[24:31] be before him
[24:33] so these
[24:36] blasphemous thoughts
[24:38] and pronouncements
[24:41] god having a mother
[24:43] the mother of god god has no mother he
[24:48] said before me there was none beside me
[24:51] there was no there is none and after me
[24:55] there will be no none
[24:57] i am the lord he says he
[25:01] i am the lord thy god there is no other
[25:05] god beside me amen thou shalt not bow
[25:10] down to them nor serve them for i the
[25:14] lord thy god
[25:15] am a jealous god hallelujah amen this is
[25:20] the word of god amen so we found
[25:25] that in the form of ages that we have
[25:28] already studied
[25:31] that there was already
[25:33] this mother and god
[25:35] concept
[25:37] that satan allowed to filter out
[25:41] and to be in the atmosphere
[25:46] right before the people
[25:48] in the atmosphere
[25:50] but then it starts to crystallize
[25:54] as the ages go by
[25:56] it starts to take tremendous
[25:59] importance and tremendous proportions
[26:03] as it advances
[26:06] and back in
[26:08] babylon the worship
[26:12] of the sun
[26:13] just as it was began to lose favor
[26:18] until the people began to worship the
[26:22] mother
[26:23] more than they worshipped the sun
[26:27] they began to emphasize the mother
[26:31] more than the emphasis
[26:34] being on the sun
[26:37] apply that today and see what has
[26:39] happened
[26:41] as we look into the word of god
[26:43] amen
[26:45] so we find friends
[26:47] that this pagan worship
[26:50] of the city of sardis
[26:54] was a rotten
[26:56] pagan worship
[27:00] pagan religion
[27:03] of woman worship
[27:06] of course
[27:09] women
[27:10] are to be honored
[27:14] they are to be respected
[27:17] there to be
[27:18] love for their contributions
[27:23] to the world
[27:25] and it's it's expansion and
[27:27] multiplication
[27:32] we find friends here
[27:36] that sibley
[27:39] she became
[27:42] most
[27:43] projected and most important to them
[27:47] the name of our son the aussies
[27:50] just began to
[27:51] be in the background oh yes
[27:54] uh he's their son but she is the one and
[27:58] they place the importance
[28:01] on this divinity this goddess so-called
[28:05] siboli
[28:07] and she took the place
[28:11] of the sun
[28:12] until they began to
[28:15] endow her
[28:17] with qualities
[28:20] of the
[28:21] god-headed himself
[28:24] she became the one to be mainly
[28:27] worshiped
[28:29] she became the one
[28:31] to be lifted up
[28:34] she became the one
[28:36] that embodied all the qualities of
[28:39] divinity
[28:40] and godhood
[28:42] yes my friends
[28:44] we just have to
[28:46] go through
[28:48] the various titles
[28:52] of civilly
[28:55] and
[28:56] realize that hard titles and attributes
[29:01] literally
[29:03] you can place them beside the titles
[29:06] names
[29:07] and attributes
[29:09] of
[29:10] mary olitree
[29:12] right
[29:13] that has been accorded
[29:16] to mary
[29:18] by the roman church
[29:22] and there you will understand
[29:25] true historical
[29:27] origins
[29:30] of mariola tree
[29:32] or the worship of mary
[29:35] by the roman church
[29:38] we will see this
[29:41] in the weeks ahead
[29:44] as we
[29:45] delve
[29:47] into the histories and into the word of
[29:49] god
[29:50] do you want to know more
[29:54] will you open your heart
[29:56] listen
[29:57] learn
[29:58] lift up your head
[30:00] only believe
[30:02] and allow the great holy spirit to break
[30:05] the
[30:06] shackles
[30:08] of denominational religion
[30:12] break them from your mind
[30:14] free you
[30:16] from the hooks
[30:17] of a red hot
[30:20] claws
[30:22] that have
[30:24] caught within your mind but in your soul
[30:28] and now god why his word wants to break
[30:31] the chains and set you free
[30:37] now
[30:38] there are two things that are very
[30:42] very significant
[30:45] when we look into the worship of
[30:47] civility
[30:50] one is the fact that she wore
[30:54] a chain
[30:56] with a key
[30:59] just like the sun
[31:02] that gives her
[31:04] the very authority that the son has
[31:08] which of course we know that's not
[31:10] written in our scriptures
[31:14] the key to heaven and earth
[31:17] the key to all mysteries
[31:19] she claims this now under the name of
[31:22] mary
[31:23] sibo ciboli claimed that under the under
[31:27] her name back then
[31:29] but of course as i explained
[31:31] paganism turned uh
[31:34] under the guise of christianity now
[31:36] changed name from sibolee to mary and
[31:40] making the same claims
[31:43] we see it here before us right now my
[31:46] friends
[31:48] the next fact
[31:50] that is very
[31:51] important for us to
[31:53] take note of
[31:56] the worship of siboli
[32:00] worshipers on certain so-called
[32:04] divine holy days
[32:07] took all manner of whips
[32:10] took all manner of implements
[32:14] and whip themselves
[32:17] they whipped themselves until they were
[32:20] bleeding
[32:21] as part of the worship
[32:24] to civilly
[32:26] until the blood
[32:28] began to spurt from their bodies
[32:32] my friends
[32:33] to this day
[32:36] among the nations
[32:38] people that follow that romish religion
[32:44] of mereolatry
[32:46] still
[32:47] whipped themselves
[32:49] you may look at the term
[32:52] self-flagulation
[32:55] self
[32:56] flagulation
[32:59] self whipping
[33:01] and this they're told
[33:04] is that by doing this
[33:06] you're
[33:07] identifying yourself
[33:09] with the sufferings of our lord
[33:13] of course
[33:14] that is in contradiction
[33:17] to his word
[33:19] he who has said
[33:21] i have suffered that you may not suffer
[33:24] i become poor that you may be rich
[33:28] amen
[33:30] he died you might have life
[33:32] he suffered but you may not suffer
[33:35] he was already wounded for our
[33:37] sufferings he bore our sufferings he
[33:40] bore our sorrows he bore our pains and
[33:44] we may be delivered from them now and
[33:47] forevermore o may god help you to lift
[33:50] up your eyes of your heart and to see
[33:53] the truths of the word of god if you
[33:55] will read
[33:57] isaiah 53.
[33:59] phil read in the gospels
[34:02] where jesus himself said this
[34:05] that he suffered that you may not suffer
[34:08] he went without a home that you may have
[34:10] a home foxes have a home
[34:12] and the birds have a nest but the son of
[34:15] man had nowhere to lay his head dear my
[34:18] friends it's done today
[34:21] and many
[34:23] around the world
[34:25] especially at
[34:28] sukkah easter time
[34:30] time when jesus
[34:32] uh suffered for the sins of the world
[34:36] they claim they are identifying with the
[34:39] suffering of the lord
[34:41] by doing the acts of self torture
[34:45] self nailing
[34:47] self-flagulation
[34:49] and other unrighteous ungodly inhumane
[34:54] bloody
[34:56] acts
[34:57] that are contrary to the word of the
[35:00] living god
[35:02] but i must say
[35:05] this was the beginning
[35:07] of the first break
[35:10] from rome
[35:12] for the seed of god
[35:15] was now
[35:16] fixing to break forth
[35:20] and to begin to be restored
[35:24] in other words the reformation
[35:27] was just about to start
[35:30] amen
[35:32] and the first break
[35:35] from popishness
[35:37] and from
[35:38] papal rome
[35:41] came here and actually actually
[35:44] flourished
[35:47] it caused that jezebel religion
[35:52] this so-called
[35:54] church
[35:55] that has the
[35:56] attributes as the prophet s jezebel in
[36:00] the bible
[36:02] yes sir
[36:04] she
[36:05] began to consolidate
[36:08] and to emphasize her power
[36:12] because
[36:14] she had to do that
[36:17] using men as john tatsell
[36:21] and many other
[36:22] men
[36:24] to come against and to oppose
[36:27] protestantism
[36:29] that
[36:31] now began to
[36:32] raise itself up
[36:35] under the leadership
[36:38] of
[36:39] martin luther
[36:42] amen
[36:44] they began teaching of course
[36:47] in rome
[36:50] this
[36:52] doctrine that endures to this day and to
[36:56] this time of which i'm speaking
[37:02] protestantism
[37:05] under luto was preaching
[37:08] that mary
[37:10] is denied
[37:12] in having any part whatsoever to do with
[37:16] salvation
[37:18] of course
[37:20] they acknowledged that she was used
[37:23] as the virgin
[37:25] to bear the body
[37:28] in which
[37:29] our lord would use as his tent while
[37:33] here upon earth
[37:35] to manifest himself among the nations
[37:40] may i make a statement here
[37:43] always remember
[37:46] they're trying to project
[37:48] a false truth a false idea
[37:51] a lie
[37:54] that jesus came from mary
[37:58] but our lord did not come from mary
[38:02] but i say to you he was only
[38:06] allowed to pass through
[38:08] mary
[38:09] mary was only used as a carrier
[38:14] orreza couldn't do it
[38:16] that's all she was she's honored she's
[38:18] blessed
[38:19] oh
[38:20] and she is revered because
[38:24] of how she submitted herself in humility
[38:28] not to prophesy
[38:30] but to surrender herself to be blessed
[38:34] of god
[38:35] enough to carry his word
[38:39] and to bear the reproach of his word
[38:42] that there might be a birth from and
[38:45] through the word
[38:46] amen
[38:48] so luther crystallized this
[38:52] in his doctrine of their just shall live
[38:57] by
[38:58] revelation
[39:00] that just shall live by faith
[39:03] not just by believing
[39:05] but what luther was saying
[39:08] is that the just should live
[39:11] not by all these written uh
[39:15] litanies concepts bowls
[39:18] uh
[39:19] that are written in their books years
[39:22] year after year the same thing used over
[39:25] and over there may be a little uh
[39:28] transcription here or there but it
[39:30] remains essentially the same
[39:33] luther is saying no no no the word of
[39:36] god is not manhandled it is not to be
[39:40] manhandled but
[39:42] the just shall live by revelation
[39:47] god's word was written by holy man under
[39:52] the inspiration of revelation and so
[39:56] must it be received by the same spirit
[40:00] of god the spirit of revelation
[40:03] and so he said the just shall live by
[40:05] faith
[40:06] not by works
[40:09] though works has an important part to
[40:11] play but man shall not live by works but
[40:14] by faith
[40:16] man shall not live by works which they
[40:19] emphasize
[40:21] the works of what
[40:22] penance that is a work of man this is
[40:25] not in the bible
[40:27] the works
[40:29] of endless prayers
[40:32] of what jesus said the pagans do
[40:35] that gentiles do
[40:37] with their long prayers
[40:40] over and over repeating long prayers
[40:42] over and over and over jesus himself
[40:46] said that don't be like the gentiles are
[40:49] amen and turn real holy ghost prayers
[40:53] into the works
[40:55] of the minds of men
[40:58] and using all unscriptural means to
[41:01] subvert overturn
[41:04] and to bring question
[41:06] upon the very word of god
[41:10] planting their evils doctrines of seeds
[41:14] of discrepancy in this hour in the minds
[41:18] and hearts of men for hundreds of years
[41:21] until this day
[41:23] this dark planter of the sower of seeds
[41:28] continues his work to scatter his seeds
[41:32] of evil in the very
[41:35] uh fields of god that has been planted
[41:38] amen my friends
[41:41] but as the freed christians
[41:44] glorified
[41:46] the
[41:46] srn of god
[41:51] these romans
[41:55] increased their
[41:56] worship
[41:58] like priests of bill
[42:00] who jumped and danced all day long
[42:04] crying for the fire
[42:06] now they defy and glorify mary
[42:11] going to any great lengths that they can
[42:16] until my friends
[42:18] roman theologians
[42:21] under pope pius
[42:24] began to
[42:27] send out a bull
[42:29] is something that is absolutely
[42:32] uh a roman bull
[42:36] of the exaltation
[42:38] of mary
[42:40] exalting her
[42:42] to glorification
[42:46] in a resurrected body
[42:48] that is not found anywhere within the
[42:53] confines
[42:55] of the
[42:56] word of god
[42:58] we do not have any gospel or any bible
[43:05] any do away
[43:07] version
[43:08] of the bible where what we are empowered
[43:11] to do away
[43:13] with anything that is within the word of
[43:15] god but we'll stand by the word of god
[43:19] until that crown we bear on that great
[43:22] day
[43:23] may the great holy spirit help us
[43:26] amen
[43:27] that doctrine of course
[43:31] is a
[43:32] absolutely babylonious doctrine
[43:36] of the son carrying the mother into
[43:40] heaven
[43:41] along with himself
[43:43] this fifth age of sardis
[43:47] goes right along with the other ages
[43:51] and will do so
[43:53] for the ages all travel together
[43:56] amen officially they may end but they
[43:58] continue to go together
[44:01] those spirits of all the ages
[44:04] mingling mixing accumulating
[44:07] and increasing
[44:08] and there's a uniting time for them
[44:11] going on to the world council of
[44:13] churches but there's also a uniting time
[44:16] for the word of god and the people of
[44:18] god and the children of god where god is
[44:21] calling out a genuine true bride to
[44:25] fulfill the promises of his divine word
[44:28] amen hallelujah we know according to
[44:31] this bible
[44:34] that that harlot this harlot of this day
[44:40] will find her part
[44:42] in the lake of fire
[44:45] where the bible tells
[44:48] that the the harlot of the book of
[44:52] revelation
[44:54] will find
[44:55] her end
[44:57] along with her children
[45:00] will be killed and put to death
[45:03] by the second death
[45:05] which is complete extermination and
[45:08] extinction
[45:09] in the lake
[45:11] of fire
[45:13] there it is my friends
[45:16] the origins of mary olitery
[45:19] i did not say
[45:21] idolatry
[45:23] though one may be able to connect those
[45:25] things together
[45:27] but what i'm saying
[45:29] is about the historical origins
[45:33] of mary olivertree or the worship
[45:37] of mary
[45:39] who was
[45:42] under
[45:43] babylonian
[45:45] terms once called samurais letter called
[45:50] civili
[45:51] now called mary
[45:54] amen
[45:56] and do you know my friends
[45:58] if i might go a little back further
[46:01] go back
[46:03] that
[46:04] astarte
[46:06] who was the goddess
[46:08] worship
[46:09] by jezebel in the bible
[46:12] of who she was the prophetess of that
[46:15] goddess
[46:16] was the goddess astarte
[46:19] which is the same person
[46:22] just with the name changed they're
[46:24] masters of name change
[46:27] oh my
[46:29] it's something else
[46:31] ah you know
[46:33] how they can change names
[46:35] may god help us
[46:37] to understand
[46:39] in this day
[46:40] it's god by his holy spirit who reveals
[46:44] his word to us
[46:46] and changes our name and nature
[46:49] not man
[46:51] who just
[46:52] changes our not natural name
[46:55] copying
[46:57] what god did for jacob
[47:00] what god did for peter
[47:02] by revelate simon and change his name to
[47:05] peter by revelation and by his divine
[47:08] authority they are now doing it man
[47:11] doing it
[47:12] calling men and women
[47:15] and
[47:16] placing them into certain positions
[47:19] and claiming they have the power to
[47:21] change their names and give them certain
[47:25] authorities
[47:26] my friends that same jezebel that caused
[47:29] israel
[47:31] to stumble
[47:32] into ungodliness uncleanness and
[47:36] contrariness
[47:37] of the chaos of unbelief
[47:40] in this day on the different names or a
[47:44] different name
[47:45] she the great harlot
[47:48] is causing the church again
[47:51] to spiral
[47:53] into chaos
[47:55] and religious
[47:57] madness
[47:58] through deceit and lies
[48:01] may god help us
[48:03] in our day and in our times
[48:06] to be able to identify these evil
[48:09] characters
[48:11] oh think
[48:13] be spiritual minded
[48:16] and allow the holy spirit to be your
[48:19] leader
[48:20] to lead you and guide you
[48:22] that you may walk
[48:24] into god's great shining light
