All right. Good to be here on a Wednesday night finally. Praise the God. I'm talking about for me a flat if you would. I was speaking with a fellow today about he doesn't uh he doesn't believe he doesn't believe nothing's happen. You die, you're done. He doesn't believe that there's anything this is all man-made. Everything's man-made and everything like that. And I was trying to show him and just say, "Hey, listen, bro. There's uh good and there's evil all around us. Oh, there is not. There is not. But uh then this song came to me. Who taught the sun where to stand in the morning? Tell me who told the ocean you can only come this far. And who showed the moon? Where to hide till evening? Whose words alone can catch a falling star. [Applause] I know my redeemer lives. I know my redeemer lives. Let all creation testify. His life within me cries, I know my redeemer lives.

Amen. Somebody give him a hand clap. Why don't you? Amen. How privileged we are cuz a lot of people have no idea. Don't have a clue. But, uh, that's where you and I come into play.

Oh, I want more of Jesus. Oh, more and more and more. I want more of Jesus than I ever had before. Now, there's your brother. Phillip, bring more. I want more of Jesus. I'm giving more of me. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Welcome to the house of the living God. God bless you, brother. Um, Brother Wilton and Sister Wilton, nice to have you here. Welcome to the house of the Lord. Can you please be seated? It's just a Wednesday night. Scripture said a little flock do not it's your father's will to give you the kingdom where two or three are gathered in his name he said he will be in our midst so I believe he's there with us how many of you enjoy the service on Sunday &gt;&gt; that was a blessing my goodness so blessed I listening to it over and over and whilst listening to it unconsciously I I think my hand touched something that Pastor Sam preached about 5 years ago and it kind of line up with my thoughts. So I'm going to use a lot of that in here. I think it was a changing world during the co time. So I'm going to kind of use the most of his notes over here. I hope he doesn't mind. Okay. So um let's bow our heads and pray. Oh our gracious eternal God. I'm so grateful and thankful that you made a way for us to be here. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Um, if you have done anything wrong, please forgive us. During the day, we we we just at the job site and everything. &gt;&gt; So, we gone through a lot, but the blood of Christ washes from all unbelief and all sins. So, we have confidence that, Father, you can come to thy throne boldly. May you please take him aside this evening and come and possess this vessel and speak to the needs of your children. You know what they have need of. May no one live here the same way they come. May your presence come here as never been before and bless the people because the letter killth but the spirit give life. So we ask for your spirit. We ask for your presence. Anything that be contrary Lord we come against it. May the great Holy Ghost have remnants and even bless those online. Let everyone be blessed in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. I have two scriptures. First one is Matthew 12:39-42. Matthew 12 verse 49 39-42. Okay. Um Oh, okay. 39. But he answered and said unto them, "An evil and adulterous generation seek after a sign, and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas." For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the wheels belly, so shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. The men of Ninevie shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonas and behold a greater than Jonas is here the Lord Jesus Christ a compound meeting doesn't comp scriptures are compound it doesn't mean that way back there it also apply to our day amen but the greater than Solomon is here Um, Matthew John 15:16. That's where I'm going to dwell much on. Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you. Heavenly Father, please bless the written of the word and bless your children in Jesus name. Amen. Please be seated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So if I'll title it, I'll say those ordained to life manifest the promise for their age. If you ordained to life, you manifest the promise for your age that you live in. And you have no choice than to manifest that life because you are part of it. The same way if before you were born there were million gems from your mom and your dad. It's not the first one that met. The one that were ordained to life is the one that came to life and you were born. So even naturally to be born you are one in a million. And spiritually to be born spiritually to a million people perish. And some people they maybe they are fortunate they have all their family part of the word or part of the bride. Some may be one or two out of their family. So you ordained to receive this &gt;&gt; because you have no choice. really you have a choice but God knowing the choice that you're going to make he doesn't wait for you to make the choice first so he he predestinated you to be part of it so you are one in a million and you should even be proud and be happy to be part of that God's attributes because I'm going to base it more in the scriptures about who were ordained to fit in the path of God's it. Amen. So, um for me to start, I I'll talk more about pastor's dispensation that he talk about of innocence. That dispensation of innocence was the time of um Adam and Eve. They were innocent and they were clothed with the light of with God's light and they were living innocent. didn't know anything until that serpent which was devil himself came and what broke thy innocence by defiling Eve and the product that came was killed a wild child and he killed his brother Abel but Abel by faith revelation offered an excellent sacrifice and God testify of it &gt;&gt; so it's not too much about the knowledge but everything is bas based on revelation because without revelation you can never please God and revelation means more to a true believer than anything else that the world can offer. So a true believer anyone who is part of that part of God's attributes who are ordained to life will always depend on revelation but they will not depend on their own canal life or canal senses because somewhere in the scripture said that some people are cannally minded because they always mind the things of the flesh but to be spiritually minded to bind the spirit of God. So there has to be also a balance. And after that time then comes the dispensation of consciousness evil time that the people were very evil. And that evil that happened the time of Noah was so bad that God even repented to create human being. There was immorality in the highest level. But in the midst of all that, the scripture said that Noah found grace in the sight of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Him founding that grace, it means that he was ordained to receive that word of God. Him and his family out of the billions were ordained to receive the word to receive the grace of God. And that time um the promise word for that time was the building of an ark. So everyone doesn't matter how much you know the Bible how much you say you a Christian whatever form you are if you do not obey Noah and his message they all perish because they refuse the light that was sent to them. But those who were ordained to life like the Noah wife and his three sons, his sons and the wives, they receive that word of God for their age. And God counted it as righteousness. And if you check in the time of Sodom and Gomorrah, it went through exact same thing. The people they they builded, they planted, they were given in marriages and common law marriage and they even went to the s to such an extent that they went against the natural cause of relationship, sodomy life. &gt;&gt; And God was so angry that he sent a brimstone fire to destroy all of them. But before that took place, he revealed himself to Abraham. And Abraham h as a son of God, we are not the natural seed of Abraham, but we are what? The spiritual the real seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. So naturally Abraham, God visited Abraham in the form of Elohim and reveal himself, revealed the heart of Sarah. And what am I trying to say that anyway if you talk to any average Joe on the street with the condition of this world, they will also tell you that the world is coming to an end. But what's the difference between you as a Christian and those normal believers, normal people? Because the difference is that God visited Abraham. &gt;&gt; So God has also visited his bride in this end time. So being privileged to receive the vindicated prophet of this hour, modern events are being made clear by what? Vindicated prophecy. And we are privileged to receive the prophet's message. And because that the word of God has come to the predestinated seed, we can know what is coming to this world that the normal worldly people have no clue of. They don't know what is going on. They don't know what is happening. They don't know what the scriptures pertain or things that are coming to pass. But you as a bride of Christ by the grace of God, God being a royal seed of Abraham and receiving the message of the hour, our eyes of understanding has been open and we have revelation. We know what is coming to happen. The people in the world have no clue. And uh as I was saying before, some of us is only one person in the family. We not match. But if you are that seed of Abraham, you are that royal seed of Abraham, you will be what? you knowing what is happening, it will put you on your days to intercede for the rest of your normal your your family. Because &gt;&gt; Abraham when the Lord told him that he was going to destroy that Sodom, Sodom and Gomorrah, he wasn't happy. Oh, they are bad people. Go and destroy them. No, he felt for them and he said, "Oh God, if there will be 50, there was no there will be 20. If there will be 10, then he realized that is is is coming to close. So he just left and God because of his intercession, God saved Lot and his his two children. The wife turned a pillar of salt because why? He refused the promise the to obey the word of God. That's why the Bible said that obedience is better than sacrifice. That's what Saul did. God told Saul destroy all the children, the kings, everything. But he be have a human sympathy and he kept them. The best part. God doesn't need your sacrifice. He need obedience. &gt;&gt; Obedience is better than sacrifice. That's why in the token Abraham explained that total obedience to the full word of God entitles one to what? To the token obedience is better than sacrifice. And as a true bride of Christ, this word of God is our absolute. No matter what anyone says, we depend on God's word. We depend on the revelation of the word and we obey it. Amen. So that obedience entitles you to the token. Hallelujah. And I'm going to when you come to the time that the Lord Jesus Christ came, when the Lord Jesus Christ came, it was the dispensation from law to grace. and the the the Pharisees and the Sadducees and all those people were living in the law. &gt;&gt; But God came in the form of he came himself as a he came as a um God as a spirit could not die. So the spirit created a body to live in and was pro promoting grace to them. But they rejected grace and took the law and the very law that they were talking about God was extending his grace to them but they refused to walk with the grace. So what am I trying to say that those who were ordained to life were attracted by his ministry. &gt;&gt; Even though the disciples they did not understand when he said I and my father are one they don't understand when he said except eat of my flesh and was except eat of my flesh and drink of my blood you have no part in me but they believe it but the rest walk away and walk with him no more in St. In John 6 it was reduced. It was like 500 it came to 70 and did not walk with him anymore. But one time he has said that except the son of man who is standing here now also in heaven and they said this was so much and they all left. It was left only 12 and one was of the devil out of the 12. So what I'm trying to say is that it went on to the crucifixion and when they crucified him there a lot of scriptures were fulfilled on that day and I'm going to read this this here. I think I have so many couple of things to read. I hope you don't mind. Notice now they had done to him just exactly and this modern events are made clear by prophecy. Paragraph 263. Notice now they had done to him just exactly what the prophet said they will do just as they are doing to this very same day in the Lician age. If you want to look at it, read Revelation 3. blind, naked, and don't know it. Turning Christ when he begins to reveal himself into the seed form again, the same one that went in the ground come back to be the bride. Just the bride and groom is the same flesh and blood, the same ministry, the same things doing just exactly what he done. the spirit and a lot of scriptures were fulfilled on that day because it's Wednesday is a um Bible Bible study. I'm going to read most of the scriptures. Now you look at Zechariah 12. It costed for he was sold with 30 pieces of silver. Was not the Messiah supposed to be sold by 30 piece of silver? Now look in Zechariah 12 in Psalms 41:9. Grace, you can put that on for me. He was betrayed by what? By his friends in Zechariah 13:7, forsaken by his disciples in Psalms 35:11, accused of false witnesses. Isaiah 35:7 dumb before his accusers never open his mouth. Isaiah 56 he was scorched. Psalm 22:22 He cried at the cross, "My God, why hast thou forsaken me? All the bones they stare at me. They pierced my hands and my feet." Isaiah 96, "Unto rest a child is born. A virgin shall conceive so forth. And also in Psalm 2:18, they parted his garments among them. In Isaiah 7:14, a virgin shall conceived. Psalm 22:78 may be mocked by his enemies. He's supposed to be friends, his enemies, the church. In Psalm 22 again, he was not a bone was to be broken, but they pierced his hands and his feet. In Isaiah 53:12, died with male factors. In Isaiah 53:9, bruised and buried with a rich brother. In Psalm 16:10, he was resurrected from the dead. David says, "So, I'll not suffer my holy one to see corruption, neither will I leave his soul in hell." All these scriptures fulfilled. And those very people who had crucified him were also at the church and they didn't know what they were doing. But on the way to Emmos, Abraham said as he explained to those two people because they are ordained to life. When the Lord Jesus Christ explained all these scriptures them, their eyes of understanding pop open and they recognize that it was their friend who the scripture was talking about because they were ordained to life. Even though they did not catch it exactly when it happened but because they ordained to life God has to come to them and reveal it to him. So it is the believers sometimes some of us will catch the revelation first but as time goes on if it's time for you to know God will come to you and make that scripture real to you because the letter killer but the spirit giveth life. But this is not a race. This is thing that you have to live the best that you can &gt;&gt; and when there is time for you to know God will appear to you. God will let that scripture become so clear that the same scripture that maybe you have read it over and over it pop up your eyes open. It becomes so clear and so I don't know how to express it that you can't even it becomes so simple and so clear to you and the then you also able to what manifest that scripture because that has become part of you but it's not a race it's patience &gt;&gt; wait on the Lord when it's time for him to reveal himself to you he will do it because he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; So when the Lord Jesus Christ died, he gave up the ghost. When he gave out the ghost, he gave a spirit. And when that happened on the day of Pentecost, 120 who were ordained to life, they went there to receive a spirit. And after them 3,000 people also what received that same spirit because they were ordained to life. And if you read in Acts chapter 2 verse 47, sorry in Acts 2:47, praising God and having favor with all the people and the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved. So you are here tonight because God ordained you to be here. &gt;&gt; You even didn't come here by chance as the same Holy Spirit that led Anna and and Simon to that new birth child. That same Holy Ghost have led you here. Have led you to receive this word of God. Some of us 30 years, 40 years, 50 years. What came to you? You think you yourself decide one day to do it? No. because there was a attribute some part of you that was thirsting for God. So when the right time came that word came to you and you could not what res resist it something in you said this is truth something you said this is right and you couldn't get away from it because you are part of him and you are ordained to receive what this word for your age without you being ordained to receive it you cannot receive it just like the scripture that we read about the Queen of Sheba. That Queen of Sheba was also ordained to life. Even though she was an adulteress, they were worshiping idols and her family all that she knew from her birth. But because there was a part of God in her, when she heard about the wisdom of Solomon, when she heard what is going on in Solomon's life, something begin to burn in her heart. She begin to want to have a taste of that. She wanted to know about that God of Solomon. Something was yearning in her to see that power of God, to see that wisdom. And you think that it was easy for her. Bra explained that his priest when he told him that she want to go there, they said you cannot go. And they prevented her to go. But once she heard it and seed in her, she can't rest. She can't listen to what they were saying. She ignored that advice. She ignored that thing and she went there what 3 months journey that she walk. No wonder the Bible said that she rise up and judge this generation because greater than Solomon is here. And when she was going, she went with all with um with gifts. She just didn't go by herself. She went with gifts to give to Solomon and and and said in her heart, if this is truth, I'll give this gift to her. If it's not true, I'll come back with my gift. So what am I trying to say? The disciples, you know, they followed the Lord Jesus Christ and they realized that what the Lord has was 100% truth and because they have that revelation and realized that it was thus said the Lord is life in it and they were ordained to life. Everyone of them gave their life or this gospel. Peter told them not to crucify him with head up. Crucify was with with his head down and all of them received capital punishment. &gt;&gt; The federal the federal government persecuted all of them and that spirit is still here with us. &gt;&gt; And they gave their all. Thomas Steven was stolen. But because the gospel was a real to him, he didn't curse his accusers. But he looked beyond that and said, "Lord, do not hold their sins against them." Not knowing Paul was there. So being Paul being a seed of God, Steven cannot say anything to what to destroy that. So God has to give grace to Paul because of him. All those people did not get a what? Were forgiven. And a true believer, you always have a forgiven spirit. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what the people has done. &gt;&gt; Yes. As our pastor was preaching last that time talking about the fifth dimension, I was dealing with a situation. But after that thing came, it became so clear to me realized these people dealing with me are being influenced by that fifth dimension without even them being aware. I began to pray to them for them. I began to pray and project life to the situation and God came in and changed every situation around. So as a believer you have to discern sometimes is not the people is the influence they are being influenced. They are not even aware of what they are being influenced. But you and I have the power of God to release them to free them to deliver them from that by your prayer and everything. It changes everything. When I was just coming was saying that some people you long to be in the atmosphere &gt;&gt; some of them you can't even stand for even a minute and he was given an example that when he comes home he see that maybe his daughter was crying this this going on that's going on and what he has to do he has to just pray and say things contrary to what to change the atmosphere. So you have the power to change the atmosphere and live in atmosphere that you want. &gt;&gt; Don't allow the circumstances to put you in that. When you realize that it's not the people, if the devil is anointing them to speak negative things, speak opposite. Bring life to the situation. Let the people be conscious of what is going on. And we remember darkness cannot stand in light. &gt;&gt; So light will always overcome darkness. So as you began to speak those positive with faith, &gt;&gt; not looking at the condition, it changed the situation &gt;&gt; and the whole atmosphere will change in your eyes. &gt;&gt; You will see God on the scene. &gt;&gt; You will see the presence of God in the situation and everything will be clear. Amen. So we have the power in the name of Jesus to change every situation. We got the power and authority. So don't allow any circumstances to bring you down. Don't allow the those people who are influenced from the fifth dimension to bring you down. But our influence come from the seventh and the sixth dimension. We are influence come from the presence of God. And being that we we are able to what? change situations and live the way God wants us to live. Amen. So what am I saying? Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever. So that queen of Sheba when she went into the presence of Solomon and it was her time to come the Bible said that there was nothing hidden from Solomon about her. God revealed all her life to Solomon
