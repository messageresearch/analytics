[0:00] Praise the Lord.
[0:02] Amen. Let's all stand this wonderful
[0:05] morning. Oh, time
[0:09] is filled with swift transition.
[0:12] [Music]
[0:15] Not of earth unmoved can stand.
[0:22] Oh, build your hopes on things eternal
[0:28] and hold to God's unchanging hand.
[0:36] Hold to God's unchanging hand.
[0:43] Hold to God's unchanging hand.
[0:47] [Music]
[0:49] and build your hopes on things eternal.
[0:55] [Music]
[0:59] Unchanging hands
[1:03] and trust in him who will not leave you.
[1:09] [Music]
[1:10] Whatsoever
[1:13] years may bring
[1:15] [Music]
[1:17] and if by earthly forsake
[1:24] still more closely to him please
[1:30] I'm going to hold to God's unchanging
[1:34] hand
[1:38] hold to God's unchanging hands.
[1:44] I'll build my hopes on things eternal.
[1:53] [Music]
[1:55] Covet not this world's vain riches. of
[1:59] it not this world's riches
[2:05] that so rapidly decay
[2:11] and seek to gain the heavenly treasure
[2:17] [Music]
[2:20] that is totally opposite of what is
[2:22] going on in the world today. Sing it
[2:23] again one more time. Oh, cover it not
[2:27] this world's vain riches like all the
[2:30] presidentences and all the kings that so
[2:34] rapidly decay.
[2:37] No, we're seeking to gain that heavenly
[2:42] treasure.
[2:44] I know that it will never pass away.
[2:51] Oh, I'm holding to God's unchanging
[2:55] hand.
[2:58] [Music]
[2:59] Holding
[3:04] my my my
[3:08] things eternal,
[3:14] unchanging.
[3:19] Oh Lord, send the power just now. Oh
[3:26] Lord, send the power right now.
[3:31] Oh Lord, send the power just now.
[3:41] I'm singing again. Oh Lord, send the
[3:46] power right now.
[3:49] Oh Lord, send the power just now.
[3:55] Oh Lord, send your power just now.
[4:01] [Applause]
[4:03] Amen. and our brothers in the past. Oh,
[4:06] they were in an upper chamber
[4:12] and they were all in one accord.
[4:18] When the Holy Ghost descended
[4:24] as was promised by our Lord.
[4:31] Oh Lord, send the power of love.
[4:36] Oh Lord, send your power.
[4:42] [Applause]
[4:43] [Music]
[4:51] Yes, this power from heaven. Yes, this
[4:54] power from heaven descended
[4:59] with the sound of a rushing
[5:03] wind.
[5:04] And tongues of fire came down upon them
[5:10] as the Lord said he would sing.
[5:15] Hallelujah.
[5:17] Oh Lord,
[5:20] we need it now.
[5:23] Oh Lord, send your power.
[5:27] [Music]
[5:35] Baptize
[5:38] one.
[5:39] [Music]
[5:41] Hallelujah.
[5:43] Oh my. Think of those brethren back
[5:45] there that day. Amen. What a time they
[5:47] had. Amen. What a time they had. But
[5:51] what a time we can have. How many
[5:53] believe we have more than they had?
[5:57] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Greater is he that is in me.
[6:03] Greater is he that is in me.
[6:06] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[6:11] is in the world. Well, Satan's like a
[6:16] roaring lion roaming to and fro.
[6:21] He's seeking whom he may devour. The
[6:25] Bible tells me so.
[6:29] Many souls have been his prey to fall in
[6:33] some weak hour.
[6:36] But God has promised us what? His
[6:40] overcoming power. Amen. Oh, greater is
[6:44] he that is in me.
[6:47] Greater is he that is in me.
[6:51] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[6:55] is in the world.
[6:58] On the day of Pentecost, a rushing
[7:03] mighty wind
[7:05] it blew into the upper room and it
[7:09] baptized all of them
[7:13] with a power greater than any earthly
[7:18] form.
[7:20] I'm so glad I got it. Now I'm going to
[7:23] let the whole world know. Come on
[7:25] everybody, now clap your hands. Greater
[7:27] is he that is in me.
[7:30] Greater is he that is in me
[7:37] than he that is in the world. Oh,
[7:41] greater is he that is in me.
[7:46] that is in me
[7:50] [Music]
[7:52] and he that is in the world.
[7:56] Hallelujah.
[7:59] Praise God. Praise God. I'm glad to be a
[8:02] part of what God is doing in this day.
[8:05] Are you glad to be part of what he's
[8:07] doing in this day? Amen. Thank God for
[8:10] what's behind. It's all led us right to
[8:12] this point. Thank God for the last year

[8:26] like this day to me.
[8:31] There's never
[8:33] been a day
[8:36] like this day I see.
[8:41] And there has never
[8:44] been a light
[8:46] that shines
[8:49] so bright
[8:51] as this day,
[8:54] this glory.
[8:59] For Christ is revealing. For Christ is
[9:04] revealing
[9:06] himself
[9:08] unto me.
[9:11] He has opened
[9:14] my eyes
[9:16] and now I can see. And his word has
[9:23] become
[9:26] a reality
[9:30] in this day, this glory.
[9:35] There's never been a day.
[9:38] Oh yes. There's never
[9:42] been a day
[9:44] like this day
[9:47] to me.
[9:49] There's never
[9:51] been a day
[9:53] like this day.
[9:58] There's never
[10:01] been a light
[10:04] shine
[10:06] [Music]
[10:08] as this day.
[10:10] [Music]

[11:10] praise the Lord this morning? We'll sing
[11:12] the next verse. You should praise the
[11:15] Lord for this. I'll tell you, oh, you're
[11:18] worthy of it all. Oh,
[11:25] you're worthy of it all.
[11:30] Amen.

[11:47] worthy. You're worthy of it all. Oh
[11:54] yes, you're worthy of it all.
[12:02] This life that I now live cuz you chose
[12:07] to forgive.
[12:10] You deserve the glory.
[12:16] Hallelujah.
[12:19] Amen. Can you give the Lord a hand clap
[12:20] this morning? He's deserves the glory
[12:22] and the praise. Amen.
[12:25] Amen. Are we believing in a in an on
[12:27] time God this morning? Are we believing
[12:29] in an ontime God who's never late?
[12:33] Everybody believing this morning he's
[12:35] right on time. Praise God. I don't know.
[12:37] Maybe we should sing that. I guess I
[12:39] don't even know what key it is in. He's
[12:41] an on time God. Yes, he is.
[12:47] Oh, he's an on time gone. Yes, he is.

[13:48] Well, he may not come when you want him

[17:43] Singing you will hear, never heard by
[17:47] mortal ear. It will be glorious. I do
[17:51] declare.
[17:55] [Music]
[18:03] Second verse says, "Many things will
[18:06] there be missing in that meeting.
[18:11] for the mourers's bench will have no
[18:13] place at all
[18:16] and there will never be a sermon.
[18:19] Preachers will be out of business. No
[18:23] will heed that call.
[18:27] Oh, there will be no mourning over
[18:30] wayward love ones and there will be no
[18:34] lonely nights of pleading pray.

[19:46] of his saving grace. Oh, on the streets
[19:49] of glory. Let me lift my voice. Oh,
[19:54] cares all pass. Oh, at last
[19:58] as I journey, oh, as I journey through
[20:01] the land, singing as I go, I'm pointing
[20:06] souls to Calvary, to that crimson flow.
[20:10] Oh, many arrows pierce my soul from
[20:14] without within. Oh, but my Lord leads me
[20:18] on. Through him I must win. Yes. Oh, I

[24:20] By the way, we've had such beautiful
[24:23] specials the other night uh last
[24:25] Wednesday night from different ones. All
[24:27] the young ones, you know who you are.
[24:31] It ain't going to be another year from
[24:33] that we hear from you, right? We're
[24:34] going to hear from you over and over and
[24:37] over again, right?
[24:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. And Sister Marcia is
[24:40] going to kick it off. Father, we ask you
[24:41] to bless the offering this morning. Um,
[24:44] we thank you, Lord, that you are meeting
[24:46] our every need as you promised you
[24:49] would. We thank you that you're a ver
[24:52] ever very present help in the time of
[24:54] trouble and that you will uh you're a
[24:57] sustainer of your people. Lord, just
[24:59] bless the offering. In the name of Jesus
[25:01] Christ, we ask it. Amen. God bless you
[25:04] as you give and
[25:07] just be faithful to him. Amen. Don't
[25:10] worry about it. Hey, we're not a bride
[25:13] that's supposed to worry. You know that,
[25:14] huh? Speaking to myself now. We're not a
[25:16] bride that's supposed to worry. So, all
[25:18] right, Sister Mar.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless you, saints.
[25:23] Often, um, sometimes before I sing, the
[25:25] Lord will lay down my heart to share
[25:28] what brought me to standing here at this
[25:30] moment. And today, by his grace and for
[25:32] his glory, for his honor, I'd like to
[25:34] share this experience. And you know what
[25:37] it is? It lead back to um in
[25:39] anticipation of the New Year Eve
[25:41] service. You know, as uh we would often
[25:44] do as those of us who've been called to
[25:45] minister in song, you know, we go before
[25:48] the Lord and we ask him, "Lord, could
[25:49] you give me a song that you'd like me to
[25:50] share with your children, right? We we
[25:53] do take it um holy and and and and
[25:56] consecratedly."
[25:58] So, you know, a couple days leading up
[25:59] to the service, I was listening and just
[26:02] praying and seeking God and he dropped a
[26:04] song in my heart and then I'm still
[26:06] like, "Okay, God, is that the one? Do
[26:08] you want me to do that one?" You know,
[26:10] and still praying through and
[26:11] everything. But then, you know, just
[26:13] life between work and, you know,
[26:15] everything else. I exactly I wasn't
[26:19] quite prepared and you know, the songs,
[26:21] the words, I was trying to change some
[26:23] of the lyrics because I wasn't fully
[26:24] identifying with some of it. And you
[26:27] know, I was just having challenges. I
[26:28] was trying to find a track because it's
[26:30] like we didn't wouldn't have practiced
[26:31] with the musicians.
[26:33] And through all of that, it's like the
[26:35] Lord kept telling me the song the thong.
[26:38] But in the end, I'm like, Lord, please
[26:40] could you just allow me to not sing this
[26:42] time. And of course, we, you know,
[26:44] sometimes we speak to him and we try to
[26:46] like negotiate, right, a little bit. And
[26:49] he says to me, "But what if the song
[26:51] will tie in with the message? I need my
[26:53] children to hear the song." And I'm
[26:55] like, Lord,
[26:57] then if it will tie in with the message,
[26:58] then it'll be a real confirmation that I
[27:01] was supposed to sing it. That's what I'm
[27:03] saying to myself, right? In consolation.
[27:06] So, I didn't sing, you know, on
[27:08] Wednesday night for New Year's Eve, but
[27:09] I was so blessed and I'm so glad that
[27:10] the mic talked about the other specials
[27:12] because we thank God for every gift.
[27:14] They were amazing, right? But of course,
[27:16] in my heart, now what happens? Our
[27:18] dareth precious pastor come and minister
[27:20] his word on Joshua and Caleb. Give me
[27:23] that mountain, right? And give me my
[27:26] mountain at the title of the service,
[27:28] right? And the song he placed on my
[27:30] heart is this. Sometimes it takes a
[27:32] mountain. And I'm like, okay, Lord, I
[27:34] get it. I know. So, that being said,
[27:39] two things that I've received out of
[27:42] this. And what I'm encouraging you all
[27:43] to do is once more, please as you pray,
[27:46] remember to pray for us in our ministry
[27:48] by the grace of God that he's given us.
[27:50] You can pray intentionally for us
[27:52] because we don't just choose a song. We
[27:54] don't just come up here. It's by the
[27:56] grace of God, right? And so I pray that
[27:59] you would please pray for us. Remember
[28:00] us in your prayers and trust that God
[28:03] would lead us because sometimes he'll
[28:04] give us a song, but then we're also
[28:06] discerning his heart and say, "Lord, is
[28:08] this the time to give that song?" So
[28:10] we're always speaking to him and so we
[28:12] pray that you please you know bathe us
[28:14] in your prayers that his anointing would
[28:16] come upon us more and more and we would
[28:18] be a blessing. So that's the one thing.
[28:20] So please keep us in prayer and then
[28:22] also now that the Lord has given us a
[28:24] revelation of what the mountain it is
[28:25] that we're facing. I pray that this song
[28:28] because even now it means even more to
[28:30] me now having received the word on
[28:31] Wednesday night. So as I'm about to
[28:33] share the song that in full transparency
[28:35] we haven't even practiced together. We
[28:37] just did the verse, the chorus, but
[28:39] we're trusting the Lord to lead us
[28:40] through it. Amen. So, keep us in prayer
[28:42] as we pray, and we pray that this song
[28:44] will truly be a blessing to your heart
[28:46] today. Amen. God bless you all.
[28:58] I
[28:59] [Music]
[29:01] never faced before.
[29:04] [Music]
[29:06] That's why I'm calling on
[29:09] you, Lord.
[29:13] I know it's been a while.
[29:17] But Lord, please hear my prayer.
[29:21] I need you like I never have
[29:25] before.
[29:27] [Music]
[29:30] Sometimes it takes a mountain.
[29:38] Sometimes
[29:40] a troubled fear
[29:45] [Music]
[29:46] from time to take a death
[29:54] to get a hold
[29:56] of me.
[29:58] [Music]
[30:01] But your love is so much stronger
[30:09] than whatever
[30:12] trles me.
[30:16] Sometimes it takes a mountain
[30:24] to trust you and believe.
[30:31] [Music]
[30:34] Forgive me, Jesus.
[30:37] I thought I could control
[30:42] whatever life has thrown my way.
[30:48] But this I will admit
[30:52] have brought me to my knees.
[30:56] I need you, Lord. And I'm not ashamed
[31:00] to fail.
[31:05] From time they take a mountain.
[31:12] And from time to trouble feed
[31:19] time it takes a death
[31:26] to get a hold
[31:29] of me.
[31:33] Oh Lord, your love is so much stronger
[31:38] [Music]
[31:41] than whatever
[31:44] trles
[31:45] me.
[31:48] But sometime it takes the mountain
[31:55] to trust you and leave.
[32:01] Oh, from time beneath a mountain.
[32:09] From time for trouble
[32:14] fe
[32:16] and from time it takes a death
[32:23] just to get a hold of me.
[32:30] Lord, your love, your love is so much
[32:34] stronger
[32:36] [Music]
[32:38] than whatever
[32:39] [Music]
[32:40] trles me
[32:45] from time to take a mountain
[32:52] to trust you with.
[32:54] [Music]
[32:58] Oh, some time it may take that mountain,
[33:07] but faith just trust him and
[33:12] believe.

[36:25] service and um all of the testimonies.
[36:29] Uh you know, every year we try to get
[36:32] one individual to come and bring their
[36:34] testimony on how the Lord came into
[36:38] their lives and awaken them to their
[36:41] calling, to their position. Amen. And we
[36:44] heard from sister Deborah Beers and uh
[36:46] you know how it included brother Tim and
[36:49] their their uh um you know conversion to
[36:52] the Lord and God's timing is just
[36:54] remarkable and it's just wonder. Listen,
[36:56] the greatest miracles that you will ever
[36:59] witness
[37:01] not going to be somebody being raised
[37:03] from the dead. They could be raised from
[37:06] the dead and then go right back to the
[37:07] bar.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; Okay? It's irrelevant.
[37:12] Signs and wonders are for the purpose of
[37:15] attracting the people to the word.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so the greatest miracle that
[37:20] you will witness is when somebody
[37:22] receives the word
[37:24] &gt;&gt; and they who were living passionately
[37:27] for the things of the world. thought
[37:29] that you know or being trapped by the
[37:32] things of the world like we heard you
[37:34] know brother Tim's testimony of you know
[37:36] being being uh you know in that accident
[37:39] and then coming under such a a an
[37:42] emotional imbalance and anxiety in his
[37:45] life he couldn't do things but and then
[37:47] and then here now the word comes
[37:50] &gt;&gt; amen the word comes
[37:52] &gt;&gt; oh right at the right time and and all
[37:54] of a sudden wow what a change glory to
[37:57] God you can look back at your own life.
[37:59] I know I can look back in my own life.
[38:01] You should be able to see that when the
[38:03] word came,
[38:05] &gt;&gt; not some church, you know, uh, emotional
[38:09] come to the altar and cry and then go
[38:12] right back into the world again the same
[38:14] way that you were, maybe even worse.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; The greatest miracle is a life that's
[38:21] transformed by the word of God.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And my desire is that 2026
[38:27] will be the greatest year ever for you
[38:31] &gt;&gt; in the Lord.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. If your desired is to to draw
[38:35] closer to God and and to have his
[38:38] purpose live through your lives, I
[38:41] believe that you'll have the greatest
[38:42] year ever.
[38:45] Amen. Um we want to remember the saints
[38:47] in Venezuela. I was in touch with
[38:49] brother George Smith yesterday and um
[38:53] you know he uh he says that the people
[38:55] there are are very very happy you know
[38:59] because they've been under a tremendous
[39:00] amount of bondage and dictatorship with
[39:02] these uh you know with the with the
[39:04] leaders that were in place and so
[39:06] they're they're expecting that things
[39:08] are going to get better there that
[39:10] somehow you know by the grace of God um
[39:13] they're going to be able to have some
[39:15] you know normal kind of life they've
[39:17] been under uh severe shortages of water.
[39:20] And you know, I was listening to brother
[39:21] George, you know, talk about these
[39:23] things live about three weeks ago. He
[39:26] was ministering. They they had him come
[39:28] and minister and share his testimony.
[39:30] And he was talking about Venezuela. It's
[39:32] a great, you know, burden on his heart.
[39:34] And immediately, you know, I felt that,
[39:38] you know, we we need to support that and
[39:40] help the people in Venezuela. And so we
[39:42] were able right then we immediately I
[39:45] said brother Mike we need to send some
[39:46] funds for brother George for Venezuela
[39:50] and look at two two weeks later look
[39:52] what's going on you know and and brother
[39:56] George is very grateful.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we want to do more if we can.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; So don't be shy if you feel you can give
[40:04] $5.
[40:06] It goes a long way in Venezuela.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't be shy. Let's do what we
[40:11] can to continue to to help them um so
[40:15] that they can now come out and the
[40:17] saints there. There's saints there.
[40:19] Amen. And so we want to see God just uh
[40:22] you know help them and and uh help the
[40:25] people there, even the the people of
[40:26] Venezuela. So let's keep them in prayer.
[40:29] Um we're going to go to the word of God
[40:31] now. Um so if there's anybody that has a
[40:34] request, maybe you can just lift your
[40:36] hand unto the Lord and say, "Lord,
[40:38] remember me. Father, what a wonderful
[40:42] privilege it is this morning, Lord.
[40:45] It's you're just it's just your grace,
[40:47] Father, that we stand here this morning
[40:49] and lift our hands to a living God who
[40:53] is mindful and is aware of his people.
[40:58] And Lord, this morning there are many
[40:59] that have a need. Lord, you see every
[41:01] uplifted hand. And Lord, we see the
[41:04] hearts of the the needs of the people in
[41:08] Venezuela through our precious brother
[41:10] George. Uh Father, may you just go and
[41:15] minister to that country now as it is in
[41:18] it is in great turmoil, Father. And it's
[41:21] going to take your hand now to come and
[41:24] and uh direct and guide the leadership
[41:27] and even the US that's gone in there,
[41:30] Lord, that are going to take control of
[41:31] the country. Father, may you intercede
[41:35] in such a way, Lord. Remember your own,
[41:38] Father. Remember the sons and daughters
[41:39] of God. Remember the people, Lord, even
[41:42] the general public. May you meet their
[41:44] needs. May there be a way to to get them
[41:46] the necessities of of food and and and
[41:50] water and the things that they've been
[41:52] so short on. Lord, may you just help
[41:54] them, Father. We pray. And Lord, as we
[41:56] go to the word this morning, we ask that
[41:58] your spirit and your grace and your
[42:00] anointing will come. And Lord, just help
[42:03] me, Father. Lord, I realize
[42:06] uh there's only so much that any
[42:09] minister can do, Lord. But with you,
[42:11] Father, if you come and anoint your word
[42:13] and you make it and give it life to the
[42:16] hearts of the people, it changes lives.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; It transforms, Father. That is what the
[42:21] word, that's what you came to do, Lord,
[42:23] to transform us back to our purpose as
[42:31] sons and daughters of God. Grant it now
[42:33] we pray in Jesus name. Amen. Let's read
[42:36] our scripture. Revelations 22:1 17
[42:41] says, "And the spirit and the bride say
[42:44] come, and let him that heareth say come,
[42:49] and let him that are thirst come." And
[42:52] whosoever will, let him take the water
[42:56] of life freely. Amen. The Lord add his
[42:59] blessings to the word. You may be
[43:00] seated.
[43:03] We we are staying on the um series that
[43:06] we've you know been going over the last
[43:09] three months or so on you know the
[43:12] purpose of God and the adoption series
[43:15] and um uh you know adoption is about
[43:19] placing sons and daughters of God. It's
[43:22] about bringing them to maturity,
[43:24] bringing them to a realization of who
[43:26] they really are. Amen. That's what the
[43:30] word
[43:31] is doing for us in this day and in this
[43:34] hour. And um today
[43:37] um we want to continue on the on the the
[43:40] you know calling of the sons and
[43:44] daughters of God. When you hear sons of
[43:46] God, you know that it includes daughters
[43:48] also. Um but we want to focus on in that
[43:53] calling of the sons of God. We want to
[43:55] we want to take a title today for the uh
[43:58] as the bridegroom call.
[44:01] Amen. The bridegroom call. Because in
[44:04] the midst of God calling his sons and
[44:07] daughters, it's him that's calling.
[44:12] It's the voice of God that's calling.
[44:14] It's the voice of our beloved that's
[44:16] calling.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's God's word that calls sons
[44:20] and daughters. It's God's word that
[44:22] dresses the bride.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's God's word that comes in to
[44:28] the bride. Amen. Praise God. You know,
[44:30] today in the Christian church world, you
[44:33] know, there there's so many that are
[44:35] proclaiming
[44:37] and all of them are proclaiming
[44:38] salvation that comes through Jesus
[44:40] Christ. And this is true and it's
[44:43] wonderful because there is no other way
[44:46] to come to Christ.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; It's only through Jesus Christ that you
[44:49] can come to God. Amen. To come to
[44:52] realize salvation. Amen. We see signs on
[44:55] the roads. Uh believe on the Lord Jesus
[44:58] Christ and thou shalt be saved. We see
[45:00] signs on the churches on their church
[45:04] bulletins. We see them everywhere. But
[45:07] do they know the truth? Are they
[45:10] preaching the truth? Do you know the
[45:15] truth?
[45:16] what you're hearing is it is it
[45:20] resonating within you back to the word
[45:23] of God. Amen. Which teaching is is
[45:26] right? Which teaching is wrong?
[45:30] There's thousands of denominations out
[45:32] there now.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; You've got all kinds of different
[45:35] interpretations on the word of God. Men,
[45:38] you know, all it takes is one or, you
[45:39] know, one person to come up with an
[45:41] idea. have one person follow him starts
[45:44] to draw other people and they can create
[45:47] a denomination.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[45:49] &gt;&gt; that's actually the definition of a
[45:50] denomination is when you get somebody to
[45:53] believe your teaching, your
[45:55] interpretation, your port, you know what
[45:57] you believe the word is saying
[46:00] and you become a denomination and now
[46:02] you've got all kinds thousands of them.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; How do you know which one is the truth?
[46:08] If your salvation is based on the church
[46:12] that you belong to, then are you sure
[46:14] that you're in the right church?
[46:19] Could it be based on, you know, could
[46:21] that church be based on man's
[46:23] traditions, man's doctrines, man's
[46:25] ideas? You've got new age movement.
[46:28] You've got all kinds. And they include
[46:30] Jesus.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; They include Jesus.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; But do they know him?
[46:38] Do they know him? He said, "I am the
[46:41] word. In the beginning was the word. The
[46:44] word was with God. The word was God.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; And the word is God.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; And the word is made flesh.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; In every dispensation, in every time and
[46:56] season, it's always been the word."
[46:59] Amen. So if your if your salvation is
[47:01] based on the church that you belong to,
[47:05] then are you sure that the church is
[47:07] preaching the truth? Are you associated
[47:09] to the church because your mother and
[47:11] your father were members of the church
[47:16] or their grandparents were members of
[47:17] the church?
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Because you know like you you talk to a
[47:20] lot of your friends, many of them are
[47:21] are Catholic and you ask them, "Why are
[47:24] you a Catholic?" Well, because I was
[47:27] brought up a Catholic. I went to a
[47:29] Catholic school. My parents were
[47:32] Catholics. I went to church twice a year
[47:34] like they did Christmas and Easter.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; I got baptized. WERE YOU BAPTIZED? YEAH,
[47:41] I GOT baptized when when I was a baby.
[47:45] You see, but is it scriptural?
[47:48] &gt;&gt; And this is the thing. And that's why
[47:51] there's a lot of of of uh voices out
[47:55] there
[47:56] &gt;&gt; that are proclaiming salvation through
[47:59] Jesus Christ, but they're leading them
[48:02] to man's ideas, man's teachings, man's
[48:07] interpretations.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; We're not interested in that. The Lord
[48:12] is just, and the only way that he can
[48:14] truly judge anyone, it would have to be
[48:17] by his word.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. because he does not change.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. What he said in the beginning
[48:25] holds to the end. God does not change
[48:28] his mind.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Listen, the word says
[48:33] in Acts 2:38, "Repent every one of you."
[48:39] Every one of you. He was identifying not
[48:43] repent family. Repent all you church
[48:48] together. No. every one of you.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; You see, this is a personal revelation
[48:55] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[48:57] Jesus Christ for the remission of your
[49:00] sin,
[49:01] &gt;&gt; unbelief,
[49:04] things that you know, you you know,
[49:06] because when the word comes, it it
[49:08] awakens you to the truth
[49:10] &gt;&gt; to recognize, wait a minute, I've been
[49:13] believing in a lie all along.
[49:17] That's what that's what happens to to
[49:19] anybody that receives the word for their
[49:22] day. They're going to realize they were
[49:25] living a lie. I don't care how close
[49:28] &gt;&gt; they can be.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; If there's one ounce of lie in there,
[49:36] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about you being perfect.
[49:39] The word is perfect.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Remember, so that's why we don't claim
[49:45] anything but the word. We listen, if I'm
[49:47] going to claim anything, I'm not going
[49:48] to claim my own righteousness because
[49:50] I'm going down.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; I'm claiming the righteousness of
[49:54] Christ. He says, I'm going to place that
[49:56] in you. I've I've accepted his
[49:58] righteousness,
[50:00] &gt;&gt; his life.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; That's why he came to die for me. Amen.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; So that I can proclaim salvation.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; My salvation is in Christ. Amen.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; It's not in the church.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; It's not in the teachings.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; It's not in the doctrines. It's in
[50:18] Christ the word.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; And look at he goes on to say here, I
[50:24] know this is all foundation, but I'm
[50:25] laying in something here. No, he says,
[50:28] listen, once you hear the truth and you
[50:31] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[50:34] Ghost, for the promise is unto you.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; There it is again.
[50:40] It's unto you and to your children
[50:45] &gt;&gt; and to all that are a far off.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Even as many as the Lord our God shall
[50:52] &gt;&gt; call.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Who's calling?
[50:56] &gt;&gt; It's him calling.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; My sheep hear
[51:00] &gt;&gt; my voice.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; I want to hear the bridegroom call.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to recognize what the
[51:05] bridegroom call is all about
[51:08] &gt;&gt; because there's a lot of them calling
[51:10] out there saying, "Hey, come to this
[51:12] church. Christ is here. You can hear the
[51:15] word here." But yet they're teaching
[51:17] trinitarian doctrine.
[51:21] As many as the Lord our God shall call.
[51:23] And that's what we want to look at
[51:25] today. The bridegroom call. His call is
[51:29] his word.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; It's him. Remember, he is the word.
[51:35] Amen. My sheep hear my voice. It's about
[51:38] you recognizing that voice tells you
[51:41] that you are a son of God.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; When you hear the word of God, it's sure
[51:47] it's going to it's going to it's going
[51:48] to expose your sin.
[51:50] You're going to realize that you're a
[51:52] sinner. But the moment that you follow
[51:55] the instruction, repent, be baptized for
[51:59] the remission of your sin, you receive
[52:03] the Holy Ghost.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; You know what the Holy Ghost is? Christ.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; The word, the the the the the
[52:10] supernatural power that gives you the
[52:12] ability to overcome any situation that
[52:16] you presently face. That's right.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost will do for
[52:21] every single individual.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Changes your whole purpose. You're
[52:26] walking this way. Now you're walking
[52:28] that way.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; And now you're not just walking alone,
[52:31] but you're walking with the word.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's read our scripture here. Our
[52:36] next scripture, Matthew 25:es
[52:41] 1 to4. He says, "Then shall the kingdom
[52:43] of heaven be likened unto 10 virgins
[52:47] which took their lamps and went forth to
[52:49] meet the bridegroom, and five of them
[52:52] were wise, and five were foolish. They
[52:55] that were foolish took their lamps and
[52:58] took no oil with them. But the wise took
[53:02] oil in their vessels with their lamps."
[53:06] Now I want you to notice here
[53:08] there were 10 virgins.
[53:11] These are the these are what like
[53:14] virgins according to the kingdom and
[53:17] Christ is the one that's speaking this
[53:19] parable. Okay. He's talking about those
[53:22] that are virgins to to Christ. They're
[53:27] actually there was 10 of them expecting
[53:32] the coming bridegroom.
[53:34] They all had their lamps. Amen. But
[53:38] notice, five had oil, five didn't.
[53:43] Amen. And so, where did they take it
[53:47] from? They It says they took oil.
[53:50] Listen, the bride, once you've received
[53:55] Christ,
[53:57] you receive the Holy Ghost.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; That's the oil. Amen.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; You can't lose that oil.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; That oil is eternal because he is
[54:09] eternal.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; So, we're going to look at this
[54:12] scripture. We're going to draw from it
[54:14] some some context here that that is
[54:17] going to give us a clear understanding
[54:19] of this this this parable here. They had
[54:23] it. They had tapped into it when they
[54:26] initially heard the call and and
[54:28] repented and received the word for their
[54:31] day.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; The foolish had the oil because it was
[54:37] offered to them
[54:40] and they actually rejected it.
[54:44] They may have been baptized in it. They
[54:47] may have had experiences in it like
[54:49] Pentecost.
[54:51] And a lot of people, they can come into
[54:53] church and the anointing will come down
[54:55] and the people will feel the anointing
[54:57] and feel the the the the the presence of
[55:00] the spirit of God.
[55:02] But that's a baptism that's on them.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; This one said they had oil in their
[55:10] vessels.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; It was in them.
[55:16] and their lamps. When they trimmed their
[55:18] lamps, it's because they were they were
[55:20] they were they were trimming the fire
[55:23] that was already lit in them.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; There's Listen, when you've come to the
[55:29] Holy Ghost, THERE'S A FIRE IN you that
[55:32] that that doesn't go out. Amen.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; One thing I can promise you, you can
[55:37] have down days, you can have hard
[55:40] battles, you can face trials, you can
[55:43] listen, but the moment that you get into
[55:45] the house of the Lord or the moment you
[55:47] start to read the word or the moment you
[55:48] start to listen to a message, something
[55:51] something comes alive inside of you.
[55:53] What is it? It's that wick that's been
[55:55] lit. Sometimes it GETS A LITTLE LOW, BUT
[55:59] ONCE THE WORD COMES, which is the oil,
[56:01] it just flames up again. All of a
[56:04] sudden, fire starts to brew inside of
[56:06] you.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; You see, you see these the the the the
[56:09] the five wise virgins, they knew who
[56:13] they were.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; They they knew exactly who they were.
[56:18] Remember the oils of the Holy Ghost.
[56:20] Let's read the next verse here. Verse 6
[56:22] to8. He says, "While the bridegroom
[56:25] terried,
[56:26] they all slumbered and slept. And at
[56:29] midnight there was a cry made, Behold,
[56:32] the bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet
[56:35] him." Then all those virgins arose and
[56:38] trimmed their lamps. And the foolish
[56:40] said unto the wise, "Give us of your
[56:42] oil. For our lamps are gone out."
[56:46] See, they went into a revival. They got
[56:48] excited, but then they they just went
[56:50] right back asleep again back into the
[56:52] world.
[56:53] There wasn't actual representation in
[56:57] them. though they are Christians,
[57:01] though they are churchgoers,
[57:04] though they claim Christ, they they they
[57:06] they they pray, they do all those
[57:08] things, but there's lacking the Holy
[57:11] Ghost,
[57:13] the the actual uh presence of God in
[57:16] their lives, personal
[57:19] that when they hear that call, when they
[57:22] hear that word, it just revives them
[57:24] instantly.
[57:27] instantly.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; They're not asleep anymore.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, we've been, you know, we've been in
[57:33] a in in a long period of time here.
[57:36] People like to take this scripture and
[57:38] they like to apply it to the whole
[57:39] church world. Today, I want Yeah, it
[57:42] does apply to the church world, but they
[57:44] missed it about 62, three years ago.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And until they recognize it,
[57:51] they're not going to recognize what the
[57:53] reality of this scripture is talking
[57:54] about and who the bridegroom is.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; And where he is right now.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; And so here now these these, you know,
[58:03] they they all all the virgins arose,
[58:06] trimmed their lamps, and the foolish
[58:07] said unto the wise, "Give us of your
[58:09] oil, for our lamps are gone out." But
[58:11] the wise answered, saying, "Not so, lest
[58:14] there be not enough for us and you." But
[58:17] go ye rather to them that sell and buy
[58:20] for yourselves. You know, when I read
[58:22] that, I say, "Wow." You know, the church
[58:24] has become a big business.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; You've got churches out there that got
[58:29] 10,000 people, 20,000 people. You can go
[58:32] in there, you can lay an offering at the
[58:35] table, and they'll let you come up and
[58:37] give a testimony. They'll let you come
[58:39] and share h how much money you gave to
[58:42] the kingdom and and all the all the
[58:44] things that that that you you know think
[58:46] that you you can't buy God.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; You can't buy God.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; You cannot give uh you know in order for
[58:54] God to give you favor.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; The only thing you can give to God is
[58:59] your life.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; That's it. Because he gave his.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; He laid his life down for us.
[59:06] The only thing we can do is pick up our
[59:08] cross and follow him.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the only life that we can
[59:13] give. But come under the leadership of
[59:16] of the spirit of God. Come under the
[59:18] anointing of a ministry that is under
[59:21] the open book revelation of what God is
[59:24] doing in this hour. Come under that kind
[59:26] of teaching and that leadership. And now
[59:29] as you are led by the spirit when you
[59:32] give you now now you're giving by
[59:35] revelation.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; Now you're under his leadership under
[59:40] his direction. Now he looks at you and
[59:44] looks at your your calling and your
[59:46] placing in the word of God. Some are
[59:49] going to be called to be successful
[59:52] business people that God will use in
[59:55] order to uh provide funds for the
[59:58] ministry in order to provide for
[1:00:00] missions to send out missionaries to to
[1:00:04] you know build uh churches where they're
[1:00:06] needed to do. It's now you're coming
[1:00:09] under the leadership and the and the
[1:00:12] purpose of God. Amen.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; There's a big difference.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; But it starts with coming to the word
[1:00:20] first.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Understanding that you that you're now a
[1:00:25] part of the word and you are part of
[1:00:29] what the body of Christ is doing now
[1:00:32] today.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you can't buy. They said, "You,
[1:00:37] you know, you might as well go try try
[1:00:39] and buy because because people they they
[1:00:43] go to church
[1:00:45] thinking that that okay, if I do this,
[1:00:47] then God will do that."
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; That's a very, you know, that's that's a
[1:00:52] a works a works uh kind of attitude. So,
[1:00:57] if I go and I give to to the to the
[1:00:59] church, then God is going to bless me.
[1:01:02] If I go and light 50 candles for all of
[1:01:05] my my my my uh brothers and sisters and
[1:01:08] my cousins who died years ago, then God
[1:01:10] is going to make a way for them out of
[1:01:13] purgatory.
[1:01:15] You see, like it's it's nonsense.
[1:01:18] God is not in any of that. God is in his
[1:01:21] word.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; And it's simple. Repent. Receive the
[1:01:25] Holy Ghost. You shall be led by the
[1:01:28] spirit of God to all truth.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's simply you know you know in
[1:01:32] in a nutshell when the Holy Ghost comes
[1:01:35] in you it's going to take you to the
[1:01:36] word.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; So here now
[1:01:41] while the bridegroom terried and listen
[1:01:45] we've come through 63 years.
[1:01:49] It seems like the bridegroom has been
[1:01:51] ting to a lot of people.
[1:01:54] 63 years. Lot of message churches all
[1:01:59] over the world
[1:02:01] and they're all, you know, waiting on
[1:02:04] the coming of the Lord.
[1:02:07] And I'm telling you that there's
[1:02:10] 50%,
[1:02:12] you know, just going by the scripture
[1:02:14] here, five of them, which is 50%
[1:02:19] were were were foolish
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; and 50% were wise.
[1:02:25] And so Christianity started over 2,000
[1:02:28] years ago. We've come through all the
[1:02:30] seven church ages building up the body
[1:02:32] of Christ. But remember, it's not until
[1:02:36] the bridegroom calls
[1:02:40] in the seventh church age
[1:02:43] that this call actually
[1:02:47] is announced
[1:02:49] to bring the bride to the rapture.
[1:02:55] Amen.
[1:02:56] All through the seven church ages,
[1:02:58] Christians were were waiting on the
[1:03:00] second coming of the Lord
[1:03:02] to do what? Redeem so that he could come
[1:03:05] and redeem his bride.
[1:03:09] That hasn't fully completed yet. The
[1:03:12] redemption is complete in the rapture.
[1:03:16] That's when redemption is complete.
[1:03:19] When he comes for his own to reconcile
[1:03:23] back to himself. Jesus' first coming was
[1:03:26] to restore Adam
[1:03:28] and to pay the price of redemption.
[1:03:32] The second coming is to restore Eve
[1:03:36] and to to take Eve
[1:03:38] and bring her into her sunship in Christ
[1:03:42] so that Christ and his bride are one.
[1:03:45] What it say in Colossians 1:20? and
[1:03:47] having made peace through the blood of
[1:03:49] the cross.
[1:03:51] Made peace through the blood of the in
[1:03:53] other words uh paid the price.
[1:03:57] Okay.
[1:03:59] By by him to reconcile
[1:04:03] all things unto himself
[1:04:06] by him. Who's doing it? He's doing it.
[1:04:10] Amen.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; And he says, I say, whether they be in
[1:04:15] be things in earth or things in heaven,
[1:04:18] he's talking about every son and
[1:04:20] daughter of God from the beginning of
[1:04:23] time that have followed and that have
[1:04:25] been that have died in their age. many
[1:04:30] Christians that died in in each of those
[1:04:32] seven church ages and even before the o
[1:04:36] even in the Old Testament, David,
[1:04:38] Abraham, Sarah, all those uh patriarchs,
[1:04:42] all those that were that that that God
[1:04:44] was the word for that particular day,
[1:04:48] they needed to wait until Christ came in
[1:04:51] the first coming so that they could be
[1:04:54] portaled
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; into that sixth dimension. Amen.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; And they're all waiting there.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Every son and daughter of God's waiting
[1:05:03] there.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; You know, uh, even through the seven
[1:05:06] church ages, you wonder about those
[1:05:08] Christians that died, you know, in the
[1:05:11] lion's dens and and, you know, were
[1:05:13] burnt at the cross all through the dark
[1:05:15] ages. Every single one of them when they
[1:05:18] died, they went immediately. If they
[1:05:21] were sons and daughters, attributes of
[1:05:23] God in that particular age, they
[1:05:26] immediately went to their theophony.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; In that sixth dimension,
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; that's why the prophet when he went
[1:05:32] there, he saw all the theophies that
[1:05:35] were there
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; and and and he says, "Who are all these
[1:05:38] people?"
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; He says he says, "They're they're
[1:05:41] they're your people. You mean they're
[1:05:42] all brandoms?" No, he says, "They're all
[1:05:44] your converts."
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Those that had received the word under
[1:05:48] his dispensation.
[1:05:51] and had received the word in all the
[1:05:53] previous dispensations
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; there. There's going to be a great
[1:05:57] meeting in the air.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In that other dimension,
[1:06:02] but we're still here.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; And we as long as we're here, we're
[1:06:07] either going to go by death naturally or
[1:06:11] by the rapture.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this is this is the the the
[1:06:16] the season that we're in now.
[1:06:19] You got to recognize that it's Eve now
[1:06:21] that's being restored. It's the bride.
[1:06:24] It's the portion of God that is in
[1:06:28] female form.
[1:06:32] It's I know it's but listen, it wasn't
[1:06:34] Adam that named Eve and gave her her
[1:06:38] name. You know that, right? It wasn't
[1:06:39] God that gave Eve her name. It was Adam
[1:06:43] that named Eve
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; and said, "Her name shall be called Eve,
[1:06:48] for she now is the mother of all
[1:06:50] living." It was after, Go back and read
[1:06:52] it, Genesis chapter 3. It was right
[1:06:55] there. And Adam called his his wife's
[1:06:57] name Eve because she was the mother of
[1:07:00] all living. And that was right after the
[1:07:03] the the sin took place,
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Genesis 3.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Okay? God did not call them uh call her
[1:07:12] Eve. In Genesis 5:1, it says, "This is
[1:07:15] the book of the generations of Adam in
[1:07:17] the day that God created man in the
[1:07:19] likeness of God made he him, male and
[1:07:22] female created he them and blessed them
[1:07:26] and called their name Adam." He never
[1:07:30] said Adam and Eve. Adam.
[1:07:34] So Eve today when she comes into a full
[1:07:37] realization of who she's married to, her
[1:07:41] name is Jesus.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; It's him.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Called their name Adam in the day
[1:07:49] that they were created. So they were all
[1:07:51] so so here now we need to understand
[1:07:55] that that uh God is now restoring
[1:08:00] his wife.
[1:08:02] Okay. the part of him that was in female
[1:08:06] form when he was originally created in
[1:08:12] his image of God. Adam was in the image
[1:08:16] of God.
[1:08:18] He was God.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. So now let's go back.
[1:08:23] They were all virgins means purity,
[1:08:25] sanctified vessels, all good, sincere
[1:08:28] people. They were all waiting on the
[1:08:30] coming of the Lord. The wise had oil
[1:08:33] which is the Holy Ghost. The bridegroom
[1:08:35] call was heard by all 10 virgins but
[1:08:38] only five had the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:08:42] Remember the translation. Okay, this
[1:08:46] bridegroom call is to the translation.
[1:08:49] It's to the marriage supper. The
[1:08:52] marriage has already taken place.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what took place in 1963
[1:09:00] when the mighty angel came down. It was
[1:09:02] Christ coming to meet with his body.
[1:09:04] Let's go on. But why is it that some
[1:09:07] hear the call and most don't?
[1:09:10] Amen. The bridegroom call is the final
[1:09:13] call to the sons and daughters of God in
[1:09:17] this dispensation. the adopted sons and
[1:09:20] daughters of God that have been placed
[1:09:23] according to the word for the rapture,
[1:09:27] for the translation.
[1:09:30] Amen. Now, others are hearing what you
[1:09:33] hear. One says, "Glory to God." The
[1:09:35] other one says, "What's the matter with
[1:09:37] you?"
[1:09:39] You see, it's the same word. We're all
[1:09:42] reading from the same Bible. But yet,
[1:09:44] some are hearing and some are not. Some
[1:09:47] have ears to hear, some can't hear a
[1:09:49] thing.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; It's because the word of God is a love
[1:09:54] letter.
[1:09:56] And listen, if I write a love letter to
[1:09:58] my wife, she can read between the lines
[1:10:02] because she's got experiences wi with
[1:10:04] me, personal experiences and
[1:10:06] understanding, knows my character,
[1:10:08] understands my ways, knows that if I
[1:10:11] said something back then, I continue to
[1:10:13] say it today.
[1:10:15] She knows my character. She knows my
[1:10:17] nature.
[1:10:19] She has a revelation of me
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; because it's been revealed to her
[1:10:26] through the experiences
[1:10:28] of revelation
[1:10:30] through an experience and a a
[1:10:33] relationship. She tells me things in
[1:10:36] secret and I tell her things in secret.
[1:10:38] It's a mystery to others when they read,
[1:10:41] but we can read between the lines.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; You see, that's what you've been given
[1:10:45] is the ability to read between the
[1:10:48] lines.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; But if you take your book, right, you
[1:10:50] know, you take your Bible right now,
[1:10:52] open it up any on any page and you look
[1:10:54] at any page, what do you see between the
[1:10:58] lines?
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; White space.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; You don't see anything written there.
[1:11:05] Amen.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; But yet when you read the same scripture
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; and somebody else reads the same
[1:11:11] scripture
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; to you it's alive.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; TO YOU THERE'S THERE'S LIFE coming
[1:11:17] through the scripture. Why? Because the
[1:11:18] Holy Ghost in you has made the the word
[1:11:22] come to life.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Others when they read it, they
[1:11:28] can't read between the lines. When you
[1:11:30] open the Bible, you see
[1:11:33] exactly what the hidden element is
[1:11:36] there. The unwritten part of the word of
[1:11:38] God that can only be received by divine
[1:11:41] revelation.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; And this is something that the that that
[1:11:45] the wise virgin, she has
[1:11:50] she has that ability by the word and the
[1:11:54] Holy Ghost in her life.
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; Let's read here. I just want to read
[1:11:59] something here
[1:12:02] from the message 10 virgins and the
[1:12:05] 144,000 Jews. Now, in the very
[1:12:08] beginning,
[1:12:12] remember everything's by revelation.
[1:12:14] Now, in the very beginning, Cain put an
[1:12:16] altar,
[1:12:17] made a sacrifice, worshiped, done
[1:12:20] everything that Abel done without, oh,
[1:12:23] receive it. He says, without the
[1:12:25] revelation of God. When the whole church
[1:12:27] is built on the revelation Jesus said so
[1:12:31] upon this rock I'll build my church
[1:12:34] spiritually revealed truth of the
[1:12:37] supreme deity of Jesus Christ. He said
[1:12:40] on this rock I'll build my church. Now,
[1:12:42] if God only respects your rituals, your
[1:12:46] rights
[1:12:47] as a Methodist, as a Baptist, as a
[1:12:49] Pentecostal, and so forth, if he only
[1:12:52] expects that for you to do,
[1:12:56] preach the second coming and all these
[1:12:59] other things that that that it's
[1:13:02] absolutely scriptural like Baptist,
[1:13:05] Presbyterian, and so forth does, then
[1:13:07] God is obligated to take both of them
[1:13:10] because that's all he required. But you
[1:13:13] see without revelation there's the
[1:13:16] sleeping virgin virgin and here's the
[1:13:20] wise virgin.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; See so so in other words divine
[1:13:25] revelation is what places you
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; into that category.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Never underestimate this saints.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. The bridegroom call
[1:13:36] when you can understand with the heart.
[1:13:39] It is because you can receive
[1:13:41] revelation.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; The revelation of the word gives you
[1:13:45] power over the enemy.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; It's revelation of knowing what God can
[1:13:50] do
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; because you've had an experience. You've
[1:13:53] seen people lay hands on the sick and
[1:13:55] you see them recovered.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; You see it by experience. You know God
[1:14:00] is able to do it.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; You've seen it. It's been revealed to
[1:14:03] you. Even yourself. You've experienced
[1:14:06] revelation healing.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what that is? Revelation
[1:14:10] healing.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; It's when you receive a revelation that
[1:14:13] you're that you're healed.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; And regardless of the situation,
[1:14:17] regardless of the condition
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU'VE COME INTO A REVELATION OF
[1:14:22] GOD
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; AND GOD IS MY HEALER.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; AND SO THAT REVELATION LIVES now within
[1:14:28] me
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; AND IT MANIFESTS WITHIN ME. IT HAS TO
[1:14:32] MANIFEST BECAUSE IT'S THE WORD.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. It's revealed only a
[1:14:38] special class of people.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Which are the attributes of God. I'm not
[1:14:43] saying, oh, you know, listen, you know,
[1:14:45] you got to be careful when you say a
[1:14:46] special class of people, people right
[1:14:48] away, they think, oh, what are you? Do
[1:14:49] you think you're special?
[1:14:52] Listen, if God reveals himself to me
[1:14:55] personally and I see it by by by by by
[1:15:00] manifestation, I see him working in my
[1:15:03] life.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; I got to consider myself special.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; But but do I want to do I want to, you
[1:15:10] know, declare that God, oh, God is with
[1:15:12] me. He's not with you. No, no. It's the
[1:15:14] grace of God.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; It's it's his grace that that that he's
[1:15:18] allowed us to see what we're seeing.
[1:15:20] Yes.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; We can't take like like we said, it's
[1:15:23] not by our own works. It's not going to
[1:15:25] be by our own, you know, by giving more
[1:15:27] and oh well, I gave more than everybody
[1:15:29] else. Well, well, that that's got
[1:15:30] nothing to do with it. He wants your
[1:15:32] life.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Are you willing to give him that?
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the attributes of God are that
[1:15:40] are those thoughts of God that were
[1:15:43] eternal that he saw you from the very
[1:15:46] beginning. He saw your image. He saw you
[1:15:49] exactly in this particular dispensation
[1:15:53] and in this age. He saw every single one
[1:15:56] of his sons and daughters. That's why it
[1:15:59] doesn't matter. I was listening to
[1:16:00] brother Brandham. He was talking about
[1:16:01] you, you know, you you're a Christian in
[1:16:03] those times where they ate them. The
[1:16:05] lions ate them up and they were the
[1:16:07] waste of the lions in the fields and and
[1:16:10] they were burnt and cut up into pieces
[1:16:13] and put but God has a spirit image of
[1:16:16] you. Amen.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; That from before the foundations of the
[1:16:21] world, he saw you. And when that
[1:16:23] bridegroom calls, that final call to
[1:16:26] that meeting in the air, every son and
[1:16:29] daughter of God, the in spirit form in
[1:16:32] that image that he saw in his mind is
[1:16:34] going to manifest and we are going to
[1:16:36] manifest in our theophony bodies in that
[1:16:39] dimension.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; In a perfect body.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Praise God. It doesn't matter how they
[1:16:46] died. IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW you die.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; It's irrelevant. God has a has an
[1:16:51] eternal image of who you are
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; as an attribute of God.
[1:16:57] And so God God gives you uh revelation,
[1:17:01] gives you authority to speak the word on
[1:17:04] behalf of himself when you become his
[1:17:07] bride.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; My wife, she can go to the bank and
[1:17:13] clean out the bank accounts.
[1:17:16] She has authority to do that.
[1:17:19] Amen. Because she's my wife. Would she
[1:17:23] do that?
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; I hope not.
[1:17:28] But you see, it's an authority that
[1:17:30] comes through marriage.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; It gives you a placing that when when
[1:17:36] you know that's why those that came to
[1:17:38] the door. Well, let's let's move on
[1:17:40] here. So our identity is revealed by our
[1:17:43] ability to receive revelation
[1:17:47] for the word of our day and actually
[1:17:51] hearken unto the bridegroom
[1:17:54] to his call. Whatever his call is
[1:17:57] telling you this morning.
[1:17:59] Yes, it's to the rapture,
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; but maybe it's calling you to a closer
[1:18:03] walk. Maybe it's calling you to let go
[1:18:06] of certain things. You got you've gota
[1:18:09] you've got to be listening because this
[1:18:10] is this is a personal remember it's a
[1:18:13] secret between him and his bride.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; And every one of us has that personal
[1:18:18] walk with him. That's why when you come
[1:18:20] into the house of the Lord, you're not
[1:18:22] looking for somebody else's emotion to
[1:18:24] spark you up. You I hope to God you're
[1:18:26] not looking to me to try and and and and
[1:18:30] preach some positive uh gospel so that
[1:18:33] you can get, you know, enthusiastic
[1:18:35] about this about this message.
[1:18:37] because that's not going to do it for
[1:18:39] you.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; You're going to need to hear the word by
[1:18:42] revelation to stimulate you by
[1:18:45] revelation to give you spiritual
[1:18:47] stimulation so you can go out there and
[1:18:50] live this word.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; We don't want to see you living, you
[1:18:55] know, a a a a person on Sunday and then
[1:18:58] you're a totally different person on
[1:18:59] Monday.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; You if you've really truly come to
[1:19:04] Christ, you're the same all the time.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Let's read the next verse.
[1:19:19] No, sorry. Did we Are we at number nine?
[1:19:26] Okay, wait a minute. Sorry. Yes, you're
[1:19:27] right. Go back to uh 8. And while they
[1:19:31] went to buy, the bridegroom came. And
[1:19:34] they that were ready went in with him to
[1:19:37] the marriage, and the door was shut.
[1:19:39] Now, here's where it gets really good.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Afterwards came also the other virgin,
[1:19:44] saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. But he
[1:19:48] answered and said, "Verily I say unto
[1:19:50] you, I know you not." Now, he goes here.
[1:19:54] Now, this is the this is the key verse.
[1:19:56] Watch therefore, for ye know neither the
[1:19:59] day nor the hour wherein the Son of Man
[1:20:02] cometh.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:04] Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; This is where this is now bringing it to
[1:20:09] our day.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. The son of man ministry.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Listen, notice here,
[1:20:17] brother Brandham said um uh watch
[1:20:19] therefore you for you know not
[1:20:22] um when the son of man cometh. And he
[1:20:26] also said here that that while they went
[1:20:29] to buy no sorry the scripture says while
[1:20:32] they went to buy they went in. Okay. So
[1:20:36] here now the son of man ministry.
[1:20:39] Now
[1:20:41] brother Brandham we need to we need to
[1:20:43] recognize here. I want to read the quote
[1:20:45] first. Let's read the quote. Okay.
[1:20:47] Proving his word. He says here, "Now
[1:20:50] remember that was not Jesus talking to
[1:20:53] Abraham there that could discern the
[1:20:56] thoughts in Sarah's mind behind him.
[1:20:59] That was not Jesus. He had not yet been
[1:21:02] born."
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; But it was a man in human flesh
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; that Abraham
[1:21:09] uh had not been born. But it was a man
[1:21:12] in human flesh that Abraham called
[1:21:14] Elohim, the great Almighty. Amen.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; It was God showing. And Jesus says, "As
[1:21:22] it was in the days of Sodom," now watch
[1:21:24] close. "In the days of Sodom, so will it
[1:21:27] be at the coming of the Son of Man, when
[1:21:30] the Son of Man is being revealed, not no
[1:21:33] more as a church." See, not no more. The
[1:21:37] bride is called.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; See, in that day, the Son of Man will be
[1:21:43] revealed what? to join the church to the
[1:21:46] head and unite the marriage of the
[1:21:49] bride.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; So when did this son of man ministry
[1:21:55] take place?
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Luke 17:30.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Okay. Revelations 101
[1:22:02] to7.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; When did this son of man ministry take
[1:22:06] place? It started in 1963.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. This bridegroom call started in
[1:22:13] 1963.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; It's still in progress today.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; That's why there's been tarrying going
[1:22:20] on.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; And within that that 63 years, you've
[1:22:25] got foolish and you've got wise virgins
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; that are that are that are within that
[1:22:30] that whole category of the message.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; But here now the son of man ministry is
[1:22:37] Jesus Christ himself. Amen.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Because in 1963,
[1:22:42] what was it that took place? The mighty
[1:22:45] angel came down, put one foot on the
[1:22:47] land, one on the sea, had an open book
[1:22:49] in his hand. What was he coming to do?
[1:22:52] He was coming to declare and redeem and
[1:22:56] take his possession
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; to redeem the sons and daughters of God
[1:23:02] that were under that dispensation that
[1:23:04] we are now under. Amen. But here now, a
[1:23:08] son of man, brother Brham,
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; was to reveal the son of man.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; And so when the mighty angel came down
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; and declared the mystery of God would be
[1:23:23] finished,
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; it was finished.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; It was finished.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Okay. William Branam was the first
[1:23:32] fruits
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; of the mystery of God being finished.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; But there were other attributes that
[1:23:39] were a part of that body
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; that would need to receive their portion
[1:23:44] of the word
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; so that they could come into their
[1:23:48] rightful position
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; of the bride
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; because it was now Christ coming down to
[1:23:56] unite with his bride.
[1:23:59] So that shout started in 1963.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Second Thessalonians.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; The Lord himself
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; SHALL DESCEND WITH A SHOUT.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE SHOUT? IT'S THE MESSAGE OF
[1:24:13] THE HOUR.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And the bride has heard the
[1:24:17] bridegroom's call.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; She's recognized his voice.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You could have been slumbering a
[1:24:23] little bit. You could have been sleeping
[1:24:25] A LITTLE BIT. YOU might have been
[1:24:26] distracted a little bit. You might have
[1:24:28] been moving into this and moving into
[1:24:30] that and MAYBE GOT A DISTRACTION HERE
[1:24:32] AND THERE. BUT WHEN THE BRIDEGROOM call
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; comes to your heart,
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; it awakens you immediately and there's
[1:24:41] fire. It's already burning.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, go to the next quote here.
[1:24:47] He says in proving his word, the
[1:24:49] bridegroom call will come right through
[1:24:53] this when the son of man will come down
[1:24:56] and come in human flesh to unite the two
[1:25:00] together.
[1:25:01] [Music]
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; There it is right there, saints. Amen.
[1:25:05] He says the church has to be the word.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; It has to be the word
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; and the two unites together. And to do
[1:25:15] that, it takes the manifestation of the
[1:25:17] revealing of the son of man.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Now, this is the thing a lot of people
[1:25:22] don't realize that the ministry of
[1:25:25] William Branham was to actually bring
[1:25:28] the son of man ministry
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; to unite with the body. And the bride
[1:25:34] now united with Christ
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; is the son of man ministry in bride form
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE BRIDE REMEMBER her name was
[1:25:46] Adam
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; the original from the beginning
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; and so if you are a son or a daughter of
[1:25:52] God then you've got to be God
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; in female form
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; you're not fully there yet you're going
[1:26:00] to be translated but this is what this
[1:26:02] word supposed to do for us.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; This is what the word is telling us,
[1:26:06] what it's revealing to us. It's it's
[1:26:08] it's identifying us of who we really
[1:26:11] are. That's why, you know, you could you
[1:26:13] could share this message with a thousand
[1:26:15] people, but if they are not attributes
[1:26:19] of God from the beginning,
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; remember, he came to reconcile
[1:26:26] all things back to himself.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when he does that, he places
[1:26:31] in you the ministry of reconciliation
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; where you now become him. You become his
[1:26:40] word. You become his voice. You become
[1:26:43] his feet. You become his his message.
[1:26:46] You you you are the manifestation of the
[1:26:49] word in your day.
[1:26:51] [Music]
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:54] He says here and he says now the church
[1:26:56] has to be the word uh it unites together
[1:26:59] to do that it'll take the manifestation
[1:27:01] of the revealing of the son of man not a
[1:27:03] clergyman
[1:27:06] I don't know I uh do do you see what I
[1:27:08] mean you see it's a son of man Jesus
[1:27:12] Christ come down in human flesh among us
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; so this why I'm saying the mystery of
[1:27:20] God it was finished under this ministry
[1:27:23] when he opened those seven seals.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; But it's not revealed to everybody.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; It's it's only revealed to the sons and
[1:27:32] daughters of God who are his bride, his
[1:27:35] church.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he says here, he says, do you
[1:27:39] see what I mean? See, son of man, Jesus
[1:27:42] Christ come down in human flesh among us
[1:27:44] and will make his word so real
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; that it'll unite the church and him as
[1:27:50] one,
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; the bride. and then she'll go home to
[1:27:53] the wedding supper.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; So, when is this uniting that's been
[1:27:58] going on? It's been it's been it's in
[1:28:00] progress.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; It's always been in progress.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; And it's still in progress today. As
[1:28:07] long as any one of the sons and
[1:28:09] daughters of God are still on earth,
[1:28:11] it's in progress. BUT SHE'S ALREADY SHUT
[1:28:14] IN.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; SHE'S ALREADY INSIDE. AMEN.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; The bridegroom has made the call and
[1:28:22] she's gone in. And there are people you
[1:28:25] you wonder why people THEY'RE THEY'RE
[1:28:27] FIGHTING AGAINST THIS MESSAGE.
[1:28:30] They're fighting against, you know, they
[1:28:32] they they want to say, "Oh, you only got
[1:28:33] TO SAY WHAT THE TAPE SAY.
[1:28:36] They don't realize they're outside
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; and we're already in." And the word is
[1:28:41] saying back to them, "I don't know you."
[1:28:45] It's that's pretty that's pretty strong.
[1:28:48] I understand that. But we need to
[1:28:50] recognize what's actually going on.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; If you are a son or a daughter of God,
[1:28:56] you always were a son or daughter of
[1:28:58] God.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; You if you were wise virgin, you always
[1:29:02] were wise virgin.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; You can't be foolish virgin. The foolish
[1:29:06] virgin goes into the tribulation
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; to be purged. BUT THE WISE IS ALREADY IN
[1:29:13] She's in the word.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Yo, glory to God. She's already
[1:29:19] recognized she and and all we're waiting
[1:29:21] for is to go to the supper. We're
[1:29:24] already married.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Next quote here, number 11. Listen,
[1:29:30] she's already there. She's already
[1:29:32] united. See, we go to the wedding
[1:29:35] supper, NOT TO THE MARRIAGE.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Fill your flesh SELF WITH
[1:29:43] ALL FLESH AND MIGHTY MEN. YOU KNOW, CALL
[1:29:46] YOURSELF WHATEVER YOU WANT CUZ the
[1:29:47] marriage OF THE LAMB HAS COME.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; IT'S ALREADY COME.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE WE WAIT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING
[1:29:55] people are always LOOKING OFF FOR
[1:29:56] SOMETHING TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE.
[1:29:58] ALWAYS LOOKING BACK FOR WHAT GOD HAS
[1:30:00] DONE BUT FAILING TO see what he's doing
[1:30:02] right now.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE IN YOU'RE ALREADY IN THAT THAT IN
[1:30:06] THAT YOU'RE ALREADY IN THE WEDDING
[1:30:08] SUPPER. WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
[1:30:10] FEASTING on here this morning?
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; You're feasting on the on the living
[1:30:15] word. You're you're drinking the
[1:30:17] stimulation of his word. You're
[1:30:19] rejoicing as the sons and daughters of
[1:30:21] God. Amen. Praise God. He says, listen,
[1:30:24] but the rapture is going to the wedding
[1:30:27] supper when the word here unites with
[1:30:30] the person and they two become one. And
[1:30:34] then what does it do to them? It
[1:30:36] manifests the son of man again, not the
[1:30:39] church theologians.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; The son of man. He says,
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; "The word and the church becomes one."
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Whatever the son of man done, he was the
[1:30:53] word. The church does the same thing.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; The word says, "BY HIS STRIPES, I AM
[1:31:00] HEALED."
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; That means I am the word. I receive that
[1:31:06] word.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; IT'S IT'S IT'S WHO I AM.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; I'm going to MANIFEST EVERYTHING THAT he
[1:31:12] manifested.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; People want to see great signs and
[1:31:15] wonders. But remember what we said at
[1:31:16] the beginning. The greatest thing that
[1:31:19] you will witness is when somebody can
[1:31:21] recognize their IDENTITY AS THE BRIDE OF
[1:31:24] JESUS CHRIST, an attribute that was
[1:31:27] under spiritual amnesia, stuck in church
[1:31:31] denomination, stuck in the teachings of
[1:31:33] man, stuck in the new age movement. You
[1:31:36] young people, be careful of that new age
[1:31:38] movement. IT'S GETTING SO CLOSE. IT
[1:31:41] sounds so good.
[1:31:44] But the minute you bring Jesus to the
[1:31:47] focus which is the word
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; right away they yes he reached that
[1:31:54] level of masterhip
[1:31:58] that's what we want to accomplish.
[1:32:01] He walked through the walls. That's what
[1:32:04] we want to do. He he he rose the dead.
[1:32:08] He we we we have seances.
[1:32:13] They don't realize what they're what
[1:32:15] they're what they're playing with.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; They don't realize that that was Satan's
[1:32:19] interpretation.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Remember, Cain brought a beautiful
[1:32:24] sacrifice and made it unto the Lord, but
[1:32:26] the Lord blew it back in their face
[1:32:28] because he didn't reveal to him that it
[1:32:31] was going to be a lamb.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; It was going to be blood. It was going
[1:32:35] to be a life. It was going to be a
[1:32:37] sacrifice. Amen. Praise God. To bring
[1:32:40] back every son and daughter of God.
[1:32:43] She's already united. Glory to God. The
[1:32:45] two become one.
[1:32:48] They begin to display the word. They
[1:32:50] have his life on display. His revelation
[1:32:52] shows on them. They have an identity of
[1:32:55] and know their part in the word. They
[1:32:58] start to understand that greater is he
[1:33:01] that is in me than he that is in the
[1:33:03] world.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; They have this revelation that they're
[1:33:06] walking with Christ. They have something
[1:33:08] to say under the anointed word for their
[1:33:11] day. You have something to declare. You
[1:33:13] have you God has placed in you the the
[1:33:16] the the spirit and and and the and the
[1:33:19] ministry of reconciliation. Can you
[1:33:21] imagine that you carry the word that
[1:33:24] that that whatever you bind on earth
[1:33:26] will be bound in heaven
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; on in heaven. Whatever you loose on
[1:33:31] earth will be loosed in heaven.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. You know not everybody
[1:33:37] is going to be wise virgin.
[1:33:41] If you can identify with the word in
[1:33:44] what's being released here today as the
[1:33:47] wise virgin, it's wonderful. But not
[1:33:50] everybody's going to be able to identify
[1:33:51] with that. But is salvation still
[1:33:54] available to anybody? Did you see the
[1:33:57] scripture we read at the beginning? Let
[1:33:59] he that thirsteth come
[1:34:05] for that living life FOR FOR THE LIGHT.
[1:34:07] SO THERE'S SALVATION available to
[1:34:09] anybody,
[1:34:11] anybody out there. That's why we don't
[1:34:13] want to be bride pride. Oh, if you're
[1:34:16] not in the bride, you're lost. No,
[1:34:18] that's not what we're saying.
[1:34:22] We're saying that salvation is available
[1:34:26] through Jesus Christ. And you need to
[1:34:29] still have that mercy seat available for
[1:34:33] anybody to receive Christ. You don't
[1:34:36] know who is wise, who is foolish. You
[1:34:39] just got to let the word declare and
[1:34:42] interpret itself.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to Glory to God. We want
[1:34:46] Listen the two. They have something to
[1:34:49] say under the anointed word for their
[1:34:51] day. You hear it said just say what the
[1:34:54] tape say.
[1:34:56] Say what William Brandham said and
[1:34:58] nothing more.
[1:35:00] Well, you can say what he said and
[1:35:03] totally have no revelation on what he
[1:35:05] said. It's one thing to to, you know, to
[1:35:08] quote the prophet, but it's another
[1:35:10] thing to quote him by revelation
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; because the same spirit that was on
[1:35:14] William Brham at the time is now in the
[1:35:17] bride.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; And so that the interpretation will
[1:35:21] always be the same if he's the same
[1:35:23] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; We don't have to just focus on
[1:35:27] yesterday's interpretation.
[1:35:29] We can come and and understand that when
[1:35:32] a minister is anointed by the Holy Ghost
[1:35:35] and says what he says by revelation,
[1:35:38] it brings stimulation. It brings life.
[1:35:42] You know the difference when a minister
[1:35:43] is preaching stale mana
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; as opposed to the living word.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it brings life.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; It opens the word. All of a sudden, you
[1:35:54] start to see all the types and all the
[1:35:56] shadows through the scriptures right
[1:35:58] from Genesis to Revelation. Amen.
[1:36:01] Without Christ anointing the word that
[1:36:04] he has that he has present, you you'll
[1:36:08] not know the difference. Without God's
[1:36:09] anointing on the message, the the the
[1:36:13] word that that's coming forth through
[1:36:16] the five-fold ministry, it's just
[1:36:18] letter.
[1:36:21] Listen,
[1:36:23] the way I see it, you could say listen
[1:36:26] uh it say uh and quote what the tapes
[1:36:29] are saying and say what brother Brandham
[1:36:32] meant and was saying by revelation.
[1:36:35] That's the way you can quote brother
[1:36:38] Brandham. You can we can take the
[1:36:40] quotes. We can play the tapes. But be
[1:36:44] sure that you've got the same revelation
[1:36:46] on you that he had when he was speaking
[1:36:48] it.
[1:36:50] Hallelujah.
[1:36:52] Otherwise, HOW CAN YOU WALK TOGETHER?
[1:36:54] HOW CAN YOU know how can you fully
[1:36:56] understand? Let's read the next quote
[1:36:58] here. Number 12, he says, "Then you
[1:37:00] notice now that they were virgins of the
[1:37:04] last watch."
[1:37:06] It was the midnight call. It was the
[1:37:08] midnight hour. That's why the last watch
[1:37:10] is the seventh watch. Coming down
[1:37:12] through the watches, there had been
[1:37:14] seven watches. And in the seventh watch,
[1:37:17] the midnight hour, as we are on striking
[1:37:20] now, see now is this midnight watch.
[1:37:24] These virgins woke and trimmed their
[1:37:26] lamps and went in.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why this is in progress. It
[1:37:33] started in 1963 when the mighty angel
[1:37:35] came down. It was it was under that
[1:37:39] seventh church age messenger. The call
[1:37:42] came under the seventh messenger. If you
[1:37:46] go back and study the seven church ages,
[1:37:48] who was the seventh church age
[1:37:50] messenger? William Branham. That's why
[1:37:52] it's so important to recognize the the
[1:37:55] the dispensational changes that took
[1:37:58] place throughout the seven church ages
[1:38:01] and into the opening of the seventh
[1:38:04] seal, which took us into the eternal
[1:38:07] church age, which is where we are now.
[1:38:09] Amen.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; The bride has recognized that she's
[1:38:12] eternal. That she always was.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; That she that she had no beginning. She
[1:38:17] had no end.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; That's what the revelation. That's why
[1:38:20] listen, no other man, I don't care. Go
[1:38:23] back and study as many different
[1:38:24] messengers as you want. It was William
[1:38:27] Branam's ministry that took us right
[1:38:29] back into the mind of God
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; to tell us that you are an attribute
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; that you had you you were in the word
[1:38:37] when when when he when he came out from
[1:38:39] God. You were a part of him at that
[1:38:42] time. There's no way that you could ever
[1:38:44] be lost. Nobody else brought that kind
[1:38:47] of revelation. And did not the Lord say
[1:38:50] to brother Brandham to to you know to to
[1:38:52] try like don't try to interpret
[1:38:55] don't try to put your own
[1:38:57] interpretation. That's why we we're not
[1:38:59] here to put our own interpretation on
[1:39:01] the word of God.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. The word was revealed. The Bible
[1:39:06] became a new Bible to William Brandon
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; because of the seventh seal. because of
[1:39:11] the mighty angel come down and and
[1:39:14] possess him to open the word and to
[1:39:17] reveal the mysteries that were that were
[1:39:20] locked up in there and then to to to
[1:39:22] actually take it to the place where he
[1:39:24] revealed the mystery of Christ to finish
[1:39:27] the mystery of Christ because it was
[1:39:30] finished when he came AND FULLY
[1:39:33] POSSESSED THAT vessel known as William
[1:39:36] Brandom to show the wave sheath
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; this is what you're going going to be.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; This is what you're you're becoming.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; This is what I'm going to do in you.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; This is the ministry of the son of MAN
[1:39:50] NOW IN BRIDE FORM. He was waving himself
[1:39:54] before the people to let us know that
[1:39:56] this maturity level that you see is what
[1:40:00] you are going to mature into because you
[1:40:03] are my seed.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. And it was
[1:40:07] finished. The mystery of God made
[1:40:09] manifest in flesh in bride form. William
[1:40:12] Brham was the first fruits of the
[1:40:14] finishing of the mystery.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But the rest OF THE BODY IS
[1:40:18] NOT COMPLETE. The bride, she is still
[1:40:21] making herself ready. She is married by
[1:40:24] the invisible union.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; You you you you've been feeding on the
[1:40:28] word. You've been feeding ON THE
[1:40:29] MESSAGES. WHILE you've been doing that,
[1:40:31] you've been in that invisible union with
[1:40:33] your husband.
[1:40:35] He chose you before the foundations of
[1:40:38] the world.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY HE I CALL YOU BRIDE. Brother
[1:40:41] Brandham says that was the that was the
[1:40:43] spirit. That was the anointing. Say I
[1:40:45] call you my bride.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; You are my wife. Hallelujah. Glory to
[1:40:50] God. She is married by the invisible
[1:40:52] union. But there are names on the lamb's
[1:40:54] book of life that have that have been
[1:40:56] placed there that need to be called
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; that need to be called to the bridegroom
[1:41:01] call to the final calling. Amen. Praise
[1:41:04] God. Glory to God. He was only there.
[1:41:07] Listen, he was only on the scene that
[1:41:10] the Bible became a new book to him. He
[1:41:12] preached the opening of the seals. He
[1:41:14] was only here for three years after
[1:41:16] that. You think that he preached
[1:41:18] everything? You think he preached every
[1:41:20] single type?
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; NO. THE BRIDE STILL HAS THE BOOK IN HER
[1:41:24] hand now. AND THAT SAME BOOK ONCE IT
[1:41:26] COMES INTO your hands, it becomes a new
[1:41:28] Bible to you. You should be able TO TO
[1:41:31] TO PULL OUT TYPES AND SHADOWS through
[1:41:33] the word of God that that even the
[1:41:35] prophet didn't bring out.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; WHAT? WHY? BECAUSE THE SAME spirit that
[1:41:42] that was in him is now in you to
[1:41:44] manifest the word.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. This book is a brand
[1:41:49] new Bible. We are the continuation of
[1:41:52] the ministry of the mystery of God
[1:41:55] revealed.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Christ
[1:42:00] did not remain in the tapes.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; He didn't just remain in the voice of
[1:42:05] the prophet.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Think about how silly that sounds.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; He's present. HE'S THE LIVING GOD.
[1:42:13] CHRIST IS NOW IN THE BODY OF THE BRIDE.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; She now has the word in her.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; How else is he going to manifest the
[1:42:22] bride, the son of man, in bride form?
[1:42:25] How else is he going to identify Eve?
[1:42:28] Eve needs to be fully identified
[1:42:31] and she's going to be confirmed by the
[1:42:34] rapture.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; We speak now on behalf
[1:42:40] of Christ
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; under the anointing and the revelation
[1:42:45] of the word.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Not just speak this, speak that. Oh,
[1:42:48] this bride's going to be able to speak.
[1:42:50] God needs to give you character first.
[1:42:53] God needs to mold and shape you and
[1:42:54] bring you into a real true understanding
[1:42:56] of what it is to speak the word of God.
[1:42:59] It's not something that he's just going
[1:43:00] to, oh yeah, yeah, go ahead. You know,
[1:43:02] it's like a father saying to his son,
[1:43:04] here, go ahead. You run my business.
[1:43:06] He's seven years old.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; He's got to build character. He's got to
[1:43:11] build experience. He needs to know. He
[1:43:13] needs to understand his father's will,
[1:43:16] his desires. Amen. How? Listen, let's
[1:43:19] read the next quote. How can two walk
[1:43:20] together unless they be agreed? They
[1:43:23] can't. Jesus said they can't. And how
[1:43:25] can a church, the Methodist and the
[1:43:28] Baptist, walk together? How can the
[1:43:30] church of Christ walk with the
[1:43:31] Presbyterians? How can the Catholic walk
[1:43:34] with the Protestant? How can the
[1:43:36] Protestant walk with Protestant but the
[1:43:38] BRIDE CAN WALK WITH the word?
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHICH IS CHRIST? IT MUST BE in
[1:43:44] agreement. Not the ecclesiastical
[1:43:47] system, but the word. Amen. You have to
[1:43:50] agree with the word to walk with the
[1:43:53] word.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; How else are you going TO LISTEN? ENOCH
[1:43:56] WALKED with God.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; And he PLEASED GOD AND HE was and then
[1:44:01] he wasn't.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. We're going to be looking
[1:44:04] at a lot more of that.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Uh that that thought, you know, kind of
[1:44:09] really broke open there on New Year's
[1:44:10] Eve. I know it was a chopped up message
[1:44:12] and I'm telling you, I was nervous, you
[1:44:14] know, like I don't know, like
[1:44:17] whatever it was. But anyways, there was
[1:44:19] inspiration in that message that that I
[1:44:23] just I couldn't bring to words, but it's
[1:44:25] g it's coming. Hallelujah. Because he's
[1:44:28] just, you know, he's he's working it in
[1:44:30] us. He's he's he's given us the
[1:44:33] experience. He he he he wants us to to
[1:44:36] he doesn't want us to just say things.
[1:44:37] He wants us to have a revelation of what
[1:44:40] we're saying.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; This is what the bride feeds on.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; We feed on revelation on the life of
[1:44:45] Christ. Amen. Glory to God. But here he
[1:44:48] says now, so so so we're it's only by
[1:44:51] the word the that we in order for us to
[1:44:54] walk with the word, we've got to we've
[1:44:56] got to agree with the word. We can't be
[1:44:58] brought under organized religion. This
[1:45:00] bride, that's one thing I'll tell you
[1:45:01] right now. You under the revelation of
[1:45:04] this hour,
[1:45:06] you will never come under organized
[1:45:09] religion.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; You'll despise it. Amen.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; You'll you you'll just like somebody
[1:45:15] comes to you and says, "Brother, you you
[1:45:16] you only preach what the prophet
[1:45:19] preached. You you play your tapes in the
[1:45:21] church. You want to say something, just
[1:45:23] comment on what he's already said."
[1:45:26] What? You're not going to No, that that
[1:45:29] just doesn't even fit with with what's
[1:45:31] what's on the son or daughter of God.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; They have a re they have a relationship
[1:45:36] with the with the living God,
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; the mighty angel himself. Amen. So, you
[1:45:41] know, walking with God. Amen. You can
[1:45:44] never be organized. We are ordained to
[1:45:47] the word to follow the word and not man.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; It's that simple. Oh, you follow a man,
[1:45:53] William Brandham. No,
[1:45:56] we follow the message
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; that he brought.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Just like you Lutheran out there, just
[1:46:02] like you you you you Presbyterians out
[1:46:05] there, you follow John Wesley's message.
[1:46:07] You you you talk about him and what God
[1:46:09] did through him. We do the same. We
[1:46:12] recognize his ministries. We recognize
[1:46:14] he was a major prophet.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; The 20th century prophet because only
[1:46:20] only a prophet the word only comes to a
[1:46:23] prophet.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Especially when it's a dispensational
[1:46:26] change. Hallelujah. Praise God. So here
[1:46:30] now Jesus,
[1:46:32] you know, you can't walk, you know,
[1:46:34] somebody tells you, you know, tells you,
[1:46:36] oh, Jesus is one and three in the
[1:46:38] trinity. Nope. You can't walk with that.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Catholic Church says we are the supreme
[1:46:43] authority and we speak for God. Nope.
[1:46:46] Can't walk with that.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; No sir. Can't walk with that. The Pope?
[1:46:51] Nope. I don't care what the Pope says.
[1:46:54] He's a man.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; And if he doesn't say what the word
[1:46:57] says, I'm not listening.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; It's as simple as that.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; I'm not afraid of any man.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Not when you're standing on the word.
[1:47:08] Amen.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. No, sir. New age
[1:47:11] movement. Nope. Jesus said, "I will be
[1:47:14] with you
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; even in you."
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; And he can't walk against himself.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Never do it. Let's Let's read on here.
[1:47:24] We're going to wind down here real
[1:47:26] quick. Why I'm against organized
[1:47:28] religion. Because this is the bridegroom
[1:47:31] call. That's part of the call here. Now
[1:47:33] listen. Notice this is the angel of
[1:47:35] light. Remember the last angel is the
[1:47:37] angel in the church age to the
[1:47:39] Leodysian. It's the Leodysian messenger.
[1:47:42] That's it. The last because the next
[1:47:45] chapter is chapter 19 which is the
[1:47:48] coming of the bride.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this and this is in in the
[1:47:53] scripture the last angel that came to
[1:47:55] bring light before the coming of the
[1:47:58] bride to meet Christ.
[1:48:01] It was the Leodysian church age. Then
[1:48:04] what was the Leodysian church age
[1:48:05] messenger? Calling them out of Babylon.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Okay, it's it's the same call. Remember,
[1:48:12] you'll never be organized. I don't care
[1:48:14] what they do with this message. They
[1:48:17] want to say do this, do that. You just
[1:48:20] follow Christ.
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Follow the word. Let the word continue
[1:48:23] to lead you and guide you. Be in prayer.
[1:48:26] Have a life of of prayer. Have a
[1:48:29] relationship with Christ. Amen. It's the
[1:48:32] same call. Go on next slide. He says,
[1:48:34] "Notice this angel." Now, he's talking
[1:48:36] about himself here. I want you to
[1:48:38] recognize that William Branam is talking
[1:48:40] about himself, but he didn't come out
[1:48:43] and say, "Oh, you got to listen to what
[1:48:45] I'm saying. You got No, no, no, no. You
[1:48:47] just because the Holy Ghost is in you,
[1:48:49] you can see what he's that's reading
[1:48:51] between the lines.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; That's understanding who the messenger
[1:48:54] is." Amen. Notice this angel is the last
[1:48:57] messenger before the coming of Christ in
[1:48:59] the 19th chapter of Revelation. The
[1:49:02] messenger's voice, if we notice, when he
[1:49:04] gave his voice on earth, there was a
[1:49:06] voice echoed again in heaven. Fourth
[1:49:09] verse. Now, he's talking. Now, I want
[1:49:10] you to understand he meant chapter 18
[1:49:13] here. Okay? When he when he talked about
[1:49:15] the the voice that echoed from heaven,
[1:49:18] the fourth verse, it's an act it's
[1:49:20] actually in chapter 18 of Revelation. He
[1:49:22] just made a mistake. This messenger on
[1:49:24] the earth was so inclined with God until
[1:49:27] when he spoke it on earth, God echoed
[1:49:30] the same out of heaven. In other words,
[1:49:33] his message to come out of her, God
[1:49:36] vindicated it. God was confirming it.
[1:49:39] When John was writing the book of
[1:49:41] Revelation and he's seen all of these
[1:49:43] things, he saw, you know, he saw
[1:49:46] everything THAT THAT THAT WAS happening
[1:49:48] and he heard God confirming what the
[1:49:52] messenger was saying to come out of her,
[1:49:55] come out of that organized system, come
[1:49:58] out of the denominationalism, come out
[1:50:01] of of man-made creeds and dogmas and
[1:50:04] come back to the word. Amen. It's still
[1:50:06] the same message. Let's go on. He says,
[1:50:09] "What is that fourth verse translation?"
[1:50:12] Remember again, he's he's talking about
[1:50:14] chapter 18:4. What does it mean? God's
[1:50:17] voice speaking to his predestinated
[1:50:20] people saying, "Come out of her." Just
[1:50:23] exactly what the voice was. He's got
[1:50:27] people all out in there, out in those
[1:50:30] through Babylon. Come out of her that
[1:50:32] you be not partakers of her sins. Yes,
[1:50:35] sir. out of that dogma and creeds back
[1:50:39] to the word made spirit and life.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; That's what we feed on.
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; Spirit and life.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Now notice if you
[1:50:49] read chapter 18, chapter 18 is all about
[1:50:52] the judgment that's going to come
[1:50:54] against mystery Babylon, that great
[1:50:55] and talks about how it's all
[1:50:58] going to come. And and we know that that
[1:51:00] prophecy is yet to be fulfilled. But my
[1:51:03] God, there are world events that are now
[1:51:05] coming into into plain view that are
[1:51:08] that are bringing this so much closer.
[1:51:11] The World Council of Churches, the the
[1:51:13] uniting of the churches and and breaking
[1:51:15] down of all the walls between the
[1:51:17] churches and becoming one and everything
[1:51:20] else. Why? Because they're buying into
[1:51:21] the into the the the the teachings of
[1:51:24] mystery Babylon, which is what? Organize
[1:51:28] control. That's what that's what
[1:51:30] organized religion is. What is Babylon
[1:51:32] was all about pagan all about uh you
[1:51:36] know uh worshiping idols and and you
[1:51:38] know oh well you got to have you know a
[1:51:41] a picture of St. Christopher in your car
[1:51:44] if you want good traveling. You know now
[1:51:45] if you put a picture of brother
[1:51:46] Christopher you might have a better
[1:51:48] chance.
[1:51:51] You might have a better chance because
[1:51:52] he'll be praying for you. He's alive.
[1:51:57] You see THEY'RE BIND THEY'RE BOWED DOWN
[1:51:59] TO IDOLS. They want to they they've made
[1:52:01] it's all Babylon. It's all mystery
[1:52:03] Babylon. BUT GOD SAYS COME OUT OF THAT.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN. He says now now watch. And even in
[1:52:09] in Revelations 18 verse 23, I noticed
[1:52:12] when I read this this morning, it said,
[1:52:14] "And the light of a candle shall shine
[1:52:17] no more in all at all in thee, and the
[1:52:21] voice of the bridegroom
[1:52:23] and of the bride shall be heard no
[1:52:26] more."
[1:52:27] Oh, let me tell you. You've been talking
[1:52:29] to your friends for years. You've been
[1:52:32] telling them about this message. You've
[1:52:34] been telling them about the word. You've
[1:52:36] been telling them to come out of that
[1:52:37] mystery Babylon, the denominational
[1:52:40] system that that's got you believing
[1:52:42] traditions. You don't even know HOW YOU
[1:52:44] WERE BAPTIZED. YOU ASK SOMEBODY, "HOW
[1:52:46] WERE YOU BAPTIZED?" "I GOT BAPTIZED as a
[1:52:48] baby." There's nowhere in the scripture.
[1:52:50] THEN YOU ASK SOMEBODY, "I GOT baptized
[1:52:52] as an adult." "How were you baptized?"
[1:52:54] "What do you mean, how was I? I went
[1:52:56] into the water and I got baptized. No.
[1:52:58] What was said when you were baptized?
[1:53:00] Were you baptized in the name of the
[1:53:02] Lord Jesus Christ? Oh, yeah. Actually, I
[1:53:04] think he said in the name of the Father
[1:53:06] and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. I
[1:53:09] say, "Yeah, but what is that name?" You
[1:53:11] see, it's all there. It's all there. But
[1:53:14] they've taken on the teachings of man,
[1:53:17] which is mystery Babylon. They've made
[1:53:19] the word of none effect to the people.
[1:53:21] Now, watch. He goes on here. Slide 18.
[1:53:25] Notice the 19th chapter is the next
[1:53:27] chapter. Now, it's right after 18, which
[1:53:30] is
[1:53:32] the the judgment, you know, the prophecy
[1:53:34] of the judgment that's coming to the
[1:53:35] harlot. But after these things, after
[1:53:38] what things did you notice here in the
[1:53:40] 19th chapter, after these things? Watch
[1:53:43] what? After what? after the message of
[1:53:47] come out of her.
[1:53:49] That's the same message that's that's
[1:53:51] that's being called and preached right
[1:53:54] now in the present stage of the
[1:53:57] ministry. He says come out of her after
[1:53:59] these things watch is the SHOUT OF THE
[1:54:01] BRIDE saints
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; with the bridegroom.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Going to the marriage of the
[1:54:10] lamb.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; How close are we then, brother? WHAT'S
[1:54:13] THE LAST CALL? COME OUT OF BABYLON.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; You do you see what the last call is
[1:54:19] really telling us here? What? Because
[1:54:22] people listen, it would get so deceiving
[1:54:24] that it would deceive even the very
[1:54:26] elect
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; if it were possible. And here we are
[1:54:29] down the road. We're right at the we're
[1:54:31] right at the precipice of the rapture.
[1:54:33] And deception is in this message. A lot
[1:54:37] of people, they've got they've made
[1:54:39] their churches so perfect. They they
[1:54:42] they make sure that every single
[1:54:44] individual in the church HAS GOT EXACTLY
[1:54:47] THE RIGHT long dress and everything is
[1:54:49] judged by the outward appearance. They
[1:54:52] want to make they want to Oh, well, you
[1:54:54] know, you shouldn't really be preaching
[1:54:56] the gospel if your children are out in
[1:54:58] the world.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; You got all KINDS OF STUFF.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; OH, YOU KNOW, YOU you know, listen, they
[1:55:03] they'll they'll tell you all kinds of
[1:55:05] stuff.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; But not the sons and daughters of God.
[1:55:08] They know where they stand. They know
[1:55:10] what the what what they've come into
[1:55:12] contact with. Amen. They realize their
[1:55:15] part in the word. They realize that
[1:55:17] they're trying to they're trying to put
[1:55:19] the uh uh law. They're trying to control
[1:55:22] the people.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; They're trying to tell what do you
[1:55:25] think? You do this and don't do anything
[1:55:27] else. WHAT IS THAT? THAT'S CONTROL.
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE WILL NOT BE CONTROLLED. THE
[1:55:31] BRIDE IS THE WORD.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; SHE IS CHRIST IN THE PRESENT STAGE. She
[1:55:36] is now the son of MAN MINISTRY IN BRIDE
[1:55:39] FORM. She will not BE TAKEN. SHE'S GOT
[1:55:41] THE OPEN BOOK.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; SHE'S GOT A revelation of the word.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; She knows that her NAME WAS WRITTEN IN
[1:55:46] THAT BOOK. THAT'S WHAT JOHN THAT'S WHY
[1:55:48] JOHN GOT SO EXCITED WHEN HE SAW THAT
[1:55:50] THAT THE BOOK WAS open is he seen his
[1:55:52] NAME IN THE BOOK.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And if you've recognized
[1:55:56] this message of who you are is because
[1:55:58] you've recognized that your name is
[1:56:00] being called. Can you hear the call?
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; Can you hear the bridegroom call?
[1:56:05] Hallelujah. Listen what he goes on to
[1:56:07] say. He says, "Now here," he says, "Now,
[1:56:09] my brethren, that's the reason I'm
[1:56:10] against it. It's unscriptural. It's
[1:56:13] unorthodox. It's been proven TO BE
[1:56:15] FALSE. GOD IS NOT IN IT. HE NEVER WAS.
[1:56:18] HE never will be." Now, I ain't saying
[1:56:21] there's not people in these
[1:56:22] organizations. That's where the church
[1:56:24] was made up of.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; But as long as you stay into that
[1:56:28] system, you're a part of it.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Let's Let's move on here. We're closing.
[1:56:34] The sudden secret going away of the
[1:56:37] church. Let the musicians come. How many
[1:56:39] of you all perhaps have read of the
[1:56:41] virgins? Some were wise, some were
[1:56:43] foolish. Virgin means purity. They were
[1:56:47] all good people. Every one of them
[1:56:49] virgin sanctified vessels of God. But
[1:56:52] those who had oil in their lamps went in
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; and the others was left out.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE ALL VIRGINS. EVERYONE people
[1:57:03] people that could that you couldn't put
[1:57:04] your finger on for anything wrong. They
[1:57:07] everyone believed in the coming of the
[1:57:10] Lord. Let's read on. I WANT TO TELL you
[1:57:12] a little story that I heard some years
[1:57:14] ago in the close here. Now this sudden
[1:57:17] quick rapture of the church. He says now
[1:57:20] you say certain things will
[1:57:23] then I'll make ready.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; Make ready. Now
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; I've just related to you of Pearl Harbor
[1:57:30] and of many places where they refused to
[1:57:32] hear the warning. They refused to listen
[1:57:35] to it. Nothing was left but divine
[1:57:38] judgment upon the people. Now all that
[1:57:40] will not go in Christ will be under
[1:57:43] God's wrath and divine judgment.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; Please don't let that happen to you.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Now read this next quote. No matter
[1:57:54] what,
[1:57:55] this is sudden secret catching.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT BRANDHAM TABERNACLE ever
[1:58:00] turns out to be,
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; don't you let it be you.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; You be a servant of Christ.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; No matter what the church world does,
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; you be a servant of Christ.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT UP TO BRANDHAM TABERNACLE.
[1:58:16] Neither is it up to any other church.
[1:58:18] Now, I'm I'm bringing this this quote
[1:58:20] not in disrespect. understand there's a
[1:58:23] lot of people
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; that are following William Brandham that
[1:58:26] are in the Brandham tabernacle that love
[1:58:28] the Lord that are that are in the bride.
[1:58:30] WHAT I'M NOT I'm not making that call.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; The thought here is COME OUT OF HER.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; COME out of organized teaching and
[1:58:39] religion and be not brought under any
[1:58:41] kind of bondage
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; because you are free.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. He says it's not up
[1:58:49] to Brandham Tabernacle. Neither is it up
[1:58:51] to any other church. It's up to you as
[1:58:53] an individual to be ready at the coming
[1:58:56] of the Lord.
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; YOU MUST BE READY. I MUST BE READY. I'll
[1:59:01] sweep MY OWN STEPS. IT'S UP TO you to
[1:59:03] sweep your own steps. Leave mine alone.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Everybody wants to go in and oh, but you
[1:59:08] know this brother, you know, you got to
[1:59:10] check and see, you know, like maybe
[1:59:11] their their church, they got a lot of
[1:59:13] unbelievers. There's people in there
[1:59:14] been married two, three times. There's
[1:59:16] this what A BUNCH OF NONSENSE.
[1:59:20] THEY HAVEN'T EVEN ENTERED INTO the to
[1:59:21] the love of Christ.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE
[1:59:25] REDEEMED.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Even William Brandom under the
[1:59:28] anointing, God gave him a word and said,
[1:59:30] "Go on as you are."
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; There was there was there listen
[1:59:37] in the sea of his forgetfulness. You
[1:59:39] will not forget. It'll be stuck in your
[1:59:42] mind. But let me tell you, he's wiped it
[1:59:45] as though it never happened in the first
[1:59:47] place. That's the God we serve, brother.
[1:59:49] Hallelujah. Glory to God. It's you sweep
[1:59:52] your own steps. I'll I'll do mine.
[1:59:54] You've got to make your garment ready.
[1:59:57] Listen, the reason the seven thunders
[1:59:58] was not to be revealed or explained is
[2:00:01] because the coming of the Lord would be
[2:00:03] Christ personally coming to each son and
[2:00:07] daughter of God. Amen. Amen.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Personally in every age, Brother
[2:00:14] Brandham was the first one of the
[2:00:16] capstone bride to come to maturity. All
[2:00:19] the other SEALS REVEALED WHAT HAD
[2:00:21] HAPPENED and talked about future events
[2:00:23] of the tribulation and so forth. But the
[2:00:25] seventh seal was the actual coming of
[2:00:28] the bridegroom.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; It was the coming of THE LORD. AMEN. TO
[2:00:32] CAP off the bride who had received the
[2:00:35] fullness of the word.
[2:00:37] You've been given the fullness of the
[2:00:39] word
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; to you. It's not a mystery anymore.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; The thunders and that which John was
[2:00:47] told not to write, God calls William
[2:00:51] Brandham and he says, "You pick up your
[2:00:52] PEN AND NOW WRITE."
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; GO BACK AND READ THAT AND SEE WHAT IT
[2:00:56] SAYS. YOU'RE THE VERY IMAGE and the
[2:00:58] VOICE OF GOD IN THESE LAST DAYS. YOU ARE
[2:01:01] THE VERY GOD TO THE PEOPLE. AMEN. Oh my
[2:01:04] goodness. Glory to God. Take that to the
[2:01:07] bank.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; MANY OF US HAD NOT BEEN BORN YET AND HAD
[2:01:12] not been born again yet because our
[2:01:15] names had not been called yet from the
[2:01:18] open book that was in the lamb's hand
[2:01:20] back in 1963. But now that book,
[2:01:24] you've been told to take it.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Eat it.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; It becomes you.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; It becomes a part of you. AND NOW YOU'VE
[2:01:33] GOT A PROPHECY THAT'S COMING OUT OF YOU.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; You've got the word that's CALLING THE
[2:01:38] SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD to the to THE
[2:01:40] BRIDEGROOM CALL. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. It's
[2:01:43] the call to the rapture, THE BRIDE, THE
[2:01:45] THE CAPSTONE BRIDE OF THIS LAST AGE.
[2:01:48] Glory to God. No more no more church
[2:01:51] ages, but become one with Christ by
[2:01:54] eating the book actually is the mystery
[2:01:57] of Christ. God in flesh in the final
[2:02:01] voice with the bridegroom call which is
[2:02:04] the SHOUT THE VOICE THE TRUMP of God to
[2:02:07] gather the bride to the marriage supper
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; and we'll end with this scripture
[2:02:17] as and as and I heard as it were the
[2:02:21] voice of a great multitude
[2:02:24] and as the voice of many waters he's
[2:02:27] talking about
[2:02:29] And as the voice of mighty thunderings,
[2:02:32] oh those thunders are thundering today.
[2:02:34] Glory to God. Saying hallelujah. For the
[2:02:38] Lord God omnipotent reignth. Let us be
[2:02:40] glad and rejoice and give honor to him
[2:02:43] for the marriage of the lamb is come.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; AND HIS WIFE HATH already
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; made herself ready. And he granted and
[2:02:53] and to her was granted that she should
[2:02:55] be arrayed in fine linen, clean and
[2:02:58] white. You know what that is? That's
[2:02:59] your theophony.
[2:03:01] That's what you're going to be arrayed
[2:03:02] in.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; Fine linen. He says, "FOR THE FINE LINEN
[2:03:05] IS the righteousness of the saints."
[2:03:08] What is the righteousness of the saints?
[2:03:10] Christ the word. Amen. And he saith unto
[2:03:13] me, "Right, blessed are they which are
[2:03:15] called unto the marriage
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; of the supper
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; of the lamb.
[2:03:22] Hallelujah.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Let us let us pray.
[2:03:28] our gracious heavenly father.
[2:03:31] Lord Jesus,
[2:03:33] Lord, I know there was a lot said, Lord,
[2:03:35] I know that it's kind of broken up a
[2:03:37] bit, Father, but Lord, I know that the
[2:03:40] sons and daughters of God, Lord, that
[2:03:42] are in this atmosphere right now,
[2:03:45] they've recognized that you alone stand
[2:03:49] in the midst
[2:03:51] of the people.
[2:03:53] You declare and vindicate your word.
[2:03:58] You will interpret your word. Man has
[2:04:01] always tried to go ahead of you, Father,
[2:04:04] and try to interpret you and say how it
[2:04:07] should be. But, Father, you've always
[2:04:11] always done it the same way.
[2:04:14] You've come and lived in the hearts of
[2:04:18] the people. Lord, won't you make this
[2:04:21] more of a reality to every single one of
[2:04:23] us here, Lord? We want to go into 2026
[2:04:27] with with with
[2:04:29] victory, Lord. And there's no way that
[2:04:32] we can do that if we're constantly
[2:04:34] feeling condemned, constantly feeling
[2:04:38] that we're not good enough, that we're
[2:04:41] relying on our own ability and our own
[2:04:43] works. Lord, let the faith come into our
[2:04:46] hearts, oh God, to vindicate that you
[2:04:49] are the living God that lives and dwells
[2:04:52] within your own people.
[2:04:54] [Music]
[2:04:56] Vindicate your word, Lord. There's many
[2:04:59] here that are
[2:05:02] constantly
[2:05:03] coming before you for healing in their
[2:05:05] bodies, healing in their minds, healing
[2:05:08] in their relationships.
[2:05:10] Lord, won't you won't you do it this
[2:05:14] year, Father? Won't you do it for the
[2:05:15] people, Lord? Lord, give them faith,
[2:05:18] Lord. I I I'm not I'm not telling you to
[2:05:21] do anything. I'm just asking you, Lord,
[2:05:22] that if there if there's faith in the
[2:05:24] hearts of the people, Lord, I know
[2:05:26] you'll meet it. I know you'll do it. I
[2:05:28] know that you'll you'll you'll go beyond
[2:05:30] our weaknesses. You'll go beyond, Lord.
[2:05:33] Lord, uh we on Friday we talked about uh
[2:05:36] you know Hezekiah and how Lord he
[2:05:38] pleaded to you, Father, because he
[2:05:40] needed healing. He didn't want to die,
[2:05:42] Lord. He said he said, "Lord, I plead
[2:05:46] with you. I've I've walked with you with
[2:05:48] a perfect heart, Lord. I I can't say
[2:05:50] I've walked with you with a perfect
[2:05:52] heart as a as a human. I make mistakes.
[2:05:56] I fall, Lord. Oh, God.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:03] But you are that perfection, Lord.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; That desire in our hearts is perfect for
[2:06:09] your word. IT'S IT'S THAT PART OF YOU
[2:06:11] THAT you've placed in us. SO WHEN I SAW
[2:06:14] THAT AND I SEEN WHAT HEZEKIAH was
[2:06:16] saying, Lord, he he was a man. There was
[2:06:19] no way he could be perfect. But in his
[2:06:20] heart, Lord, he had a PERFECT UH
[2:06:23] RELATIONSHIP. HE HAD A PERFECT ATTITUDE
[2:06:26] towards you, A PERFECT DESIRE FOR YOU to
[2:06:29] come and and to do what he couldn't do.
[2:06:31] Lord, HE NEEDED MORE TIME BECAUSE HE HAD
[2:06:34] A CAUSE. HE HAD SOMETHING HE WANTED TO
[2:06:36] DO. HE WANTED TO RESTORE THE ALTARS,
[2:06:37] LORD.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; LORD, WE GOT FAMILIES. WE GOT LOVED
[2:06:40] ONES. WE'VE GOT THINGS IN OUR LIVES,
[2:06:43] LORD, that we want to see restored.

[2:06:47] you, LORD, GIVE US THAT FAITH, OH GOD,
[2:06:50] and and Lord, change situations, FATHER.
[2:06:53] THERE'S THEY'RE ALL GOD.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; THERE'S SITUATIONS that seem impossible,
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; but not with you.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; There's nothing too hard for you,
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus.
[2:07:10] Come, Lord.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Have your way, oh God. Remember the
[2:07:15] hearts of your children. The the
[2:07:17] unspoken call and cry that's been going
[2:07:20] out here this morning. Grant it, oh God.
[2:07:23] We surrender ourselves to you, Father,
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ and for your
[2:07:29] glory.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; Amen and amen.
