[Applause] So, hi everyone. This is the Turner family. Over here we have the son, Abe Turner. We have Daniel Turner and we have Rachel Turner. So, Rachel and Abe Turner back from the church.

You know, you might have sinned his life, Lord, but you just have to keep him, Lord. Just save his life, Lord. Just heal him. Bring me to a doctor. Okay, I think it's okay. [Music] So since Abe was an atheist, he never accepted God's healing. Instead, he chose to go to the doctor and depended on science to heal him. Let's see what happens next. [Music] Okay. What's your uh health insurance? Insurance, right? No insurance. Do Do you guys have insurance? Uh is that I'm sorry. [Music] [Music] One hour later. Hey, can you just bring in those people?

If you guys have it in your Bibles. Amen. Amen. Surely he has bore our griefs and carried our sorrow. Yep. We did esteem him stricken, smitten of God and afflicted, but he was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed. Amen. Amen. I think of an eternal uh band-aid. Amen. That's the blood of Jesus Christ, right? I think of a mom. Maybe a son falls off his bike and he's bleeding and the mom comes and carries around and puts on a band-aid. But that band-aid is only temporary. Amen. The blood of Jesus Christ. Amen.

My child, I am so proud of you. You have stepped out of the cage that you put yourself in under all that misery and pain and suffering. But I just want you to know that the Lord said unto Samuel, "Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him." The Lord does not look on the things people look at.

Go for it. Sir, we just arrived to the prison of the princess. Excellent. My scriptural vasers. All right, gentlemen. Let's go. All right, disperse and don't come back till you found the princess. Yes, Captain. Excellent. When we do, princess, we come to rescue you. Oh, Captain, thanks for coming. I've waited for so long. I know you have. Well, let's thank Val for saving me. Val, where have I heard that name before? It's not so familiar. Some guy at a party or something. Watch the co razors. Thou shalt have no other guys before me. Good work. You're not the princess. You're a a gentle. I'll get you next time. We're safe. Crewman, report. A bit of an added to that last order. Do not come back till you have found the real princess. Yes. Disperse.

[Music] Yes, have any of you found the real princess yet? Go. Don't give up. Keep looking. Cuz like someone like already find me already like Thanks. I have come to save you, but it better be you this time. I dealt with enough fakes and quads today. Oh, captain. I'm so glad you found me. These stingots have been treating me so terribly. Could you get those towels over there for me, please? Now, honestly, you're a lot more masculine than I would have pictured or liked. Your own isn't exactly on point either, but being that that feminine voice is quite convincing, of course, I'll grab the erasers. Jonathan 912. Thou shall not take the towels. Wait a second. Wait a second. Wait a second. There is no Jonathan 9:12, let alone taking towels when I have my scriptal razors on, so I should be able to know the truth or not. I feel so confused. So lost. I don't know what to think anymore. Captain, Captain, I found the real princess. Wait a second. First of all, who are you? And wait a minute. You're the real princess. Who are you? [Music] We'll get you next time, Captain. Everything I've never including those glasses. Okay. So, wait. Who are you? No, seriously. I haven't seen you on my ship before, but could you help anytime you get to this? Oh, Captain, you saved me. Yeah, you and everybody else today. How can I ever repay you? Give me a godly based handshake. Get on the boat. We're going home. Yay. You're sleeping in a separate room. First John 4. Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God, because many false prophets are gone out into the world. Hereby know ye the spirit of God. Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God. And every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is that spirit of an antichrist. Wherefore you have heard that it should come, and even now already it is in the world. Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them. Because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the [Applause] Thank you for seeing the game. What did you say? Now we are welcome. [Music] [Music] Okay, let's give everybody a round of applause because really you guys are really um excellent. You know, the acting, the originality, um the uh content, the scripture, everything was really really good. Um but our judges are going to give the final ultimate count and um so that is going to take place over the next maybe half hour or so as they submit all of their um findings and then um we will bring you back in shortly because right now we're going to go to the outside for the watermelon eating contest. Okay. So, so, so here's here's the deal, okay? Here's the rules. Each team needs to choose three girls and three boys from each team. Okay. So decide out of your team which three boys and three girls will be your watermelon eating machines. Now, the way that the scoring is going to work, okay, just so you know, is there's going to be a total of 20 points. Okay? Well, it it actually equals more than that, but this is how it works. Watch. The winning team will receive 20 points. The second team to finish will receive 15. The third team will receive 10 and the final team will receive five. Okay. So, it's you got to it's it's a it's a eat to the end. Okay. All right. Eat to the end. Once the third team is finished, then of course the fourth team, you can stop eating at that point. It's entirely up to you. If you're enjoying the melon, continue to eat. All right. Um, so is that clear? 20, 15, 10, and five. Okay. Now, the other thing is those that are going to be eating the watermelons are not allowed to use their hands. The three girls on each of the sides need to tie their hair to the back. Okay? So that it doesn't get into the watermelon. All right? And your hands are going to be behind your back. If you move your hands up, you will be disqualified. Okay? So, you cannot move your hands up. Now, what you got to do is if you kind of like knock your watermelon over, well, you're going to need to grab it by the edge with your teeth and straighten it out again. Now, hopefully it's not going to fall over because we're going to cut the slices in such a way that you will be able to, you know, eat properly and it shouldn't really fall over. So, you know, just take your time. but yet go really fast. Okay. And um the best team win. Does anybody have any questions? Yes. Any questions? No questions. Okay. Good. We are setting it up outside. Everybody head outside. All right. Thank you. Rachel, prepare. We have four guys. [Music] [Music] And one of the boys is American. So you got to go to four girls. No. Oh yeah. Okay. He's in. [Music] [Music] timeless bless. Praise the [Music] Lord. God service. [Music] [Music] Wow. Isn't that [Music] brother? Well, it's the same skirt. It's in season, [Music] you know, God put emphasis on all the Holy Spirit showed me the law and the word of people. We're on something here. Everybody fall on everybody. Everybody all the weed and we got thirsty and hungry. But it's only supernatural. Amen. [Music] [Music] Is there a service tonight? Yes. What is the service? So, service. Would that be all right? Sometimes [Music] Heat. Heat. This is it. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.
