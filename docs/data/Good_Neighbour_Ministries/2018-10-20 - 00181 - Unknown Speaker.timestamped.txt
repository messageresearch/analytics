[30:06] McCain into given a lot of prisoners
[30:10] another them they call it they broke
[30:12] them and they told them to defer the day
[30:16] before they give up whatever or give
[30:19] them and they spoken to save themselves
[30:22] amen but when they got to the event
[30:25] there was many other schools but there's
[30:28] like chocolate king I use him as an
[30:31] example he's just God and he's aware
[30:35] that when they ask you those questions
