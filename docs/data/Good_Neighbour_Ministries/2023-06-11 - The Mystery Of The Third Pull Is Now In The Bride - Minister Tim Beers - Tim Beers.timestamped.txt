[39:17] yes
[39:22] [Music]
[39:30] praise God Amen
[39:32] glory to God
[39:33] [Music]
[39:35] this morning we're blessed
[39:37] have with us
[39:41] decided that she will identify with the
[39:45] body of Jesus Christ
[39:48] today I say we are privileged
[39:51] we are honored
[39:55] to be able to witness this wonderful
[39:57] testimony of our sister amoya
[40:01] and so you know just in talking a little
[40:04] bit about baptism
[40:06] we know that it's not baptism that saves
[40:09] us you know that right
[40:11] baptism is not like you know you go into
[40:15] the water and you take a bath and you
[40:17] leave the dirt behind
[40:20] though there is a spiritual application
[40:23] to that
[40:24] when it happens
[40:26] in a genuine way
[40:28] baptism is being buried in the water
[40:33] and knowing that your old life has been
[40:37] washed away
[40:39] amen praise God we read it in First
[40:42] Peter chapter 3 verse 21
[40:47] where the scripture says
[40:49] and corresponding to that baptism now
[40:52] saves you not the removal of dirt from
[40:56] the flesh but as an appeal to God for a
[41:00] good conscious
[41:02] through the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[41:04] so in other words something has taken
[41:07] place within a moya's consciousness
[41:11] she has become aware of the reality of
[41:14] God she's become aware of her
[41:18] reality in God
[41:20] and that she has a place in the body of
[41:23] Jesus Christ
[41:25] it's now identifying herself in the same
[41:29] way that a woman takes her husband at
[41:31] marriage
[41:33] she is doing that in a spiritual form
[41:36] she's making the Lord Jesus Christ her
[41:40] savior her Lord
[41:42] her absolute
[41:44] amen
[41:45] [Music]
[41:47] so
[41:48] understanding that baptism is also a
[41:52] death
[41:53] because it says in Romans chapter 6 know
[41:56] ye not that so many of us as were
[41:59] baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized
[42:02] into his death
[42:04] therefore we are buried with him by
[42:06] baptism into death
[42:07] that like as Christ was raised up from
[42:10] the dead by the glory of the father even
[42:13] so we also should walk in newness of
[42:17] life
[42:19] so you're actually beginning a new life
[42:22] you're young
[42:23] you're only born how many years ago
[42:26] 13 years ago
[42:29] most of us don't experience the new
[42:32] birth till much later in life
[42:34] but you're getting to experience it at a
[42:35] very young age
[42:37] which shows that something special
[42:39] something genuine has taken place within
[42:42] you it's not because Mom and Dad go to
[42:44] church
[42:45] it's not because the Bible says you
[42:48] should be baptized because you went to a
[42:50] youth camp and maybe you heard that you
[42:52] need to be baptized
[42:53] we don't believe in that kind of baptism
[42:56] in this church we believe in genuine
[42:59] experience where the Holy Spirit reveals
[43:03] to you in your heart that it's time
[43:06] to identify who you really are
[43:10] in this world
[43:12] so in Acts 2 38 it says repent
[43:16] and without repentance
[43:19] there is no true baptism
[43:22] that's why it says repent and be
[43:25] baptized so we we look at our lives we
[43:28] we see the the old life
[43:31] and we're willing we desire for that old
[43:34] life to be just left behind
[43:36] and that's why the type of the burial it
[43:39] gets left behind
[43:40] [Music]
[43:42] and so
[43:44] you don't want to go down a dry Center
[43:45] and come up a wet center right
[43:47] [Music]
[43:48] amen praise God
[43:51] so like it says in Acts 22 16
[43:55] in other words of ananias to the newly
[43:58] saved Paul
[43:59] and now why do you wait
[44:03] that's why you went to your parents
[44:05] something stirred within you
[44:08] why do you wait rise and be baptized
[44:11] wash away your sins calling on the name
[44:15] of the Lord
[44:16] let us enter into the water
[44:19] [Music]
[44:37] so amoya today you've come here on your
[44:40] own accord
[44:41] [Music]
[44:43] be identified with the Lord Jesus Christ
[44:47] amen praise God do you from this day
[44:52] decide that you will serve him with all
[44:54] of your heart
[44:56] [Music]
[44:58] the good
[44:59] I do amen praise God upon the confession
[45:04] of your faith
[45:05] I'm going to baptize you today in the
[45:07] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[45:11] first let us all pray
[45:13] our gracious Eternal Father
[45:16] Lord what a wonderful
[45:19] day this is I know all of Heaven is
[45:22] rejoicing
[45:23] because of one turning to you
[45:26] accepting you as their absolute this
[45:29] morning identifying themselves that they
[45:32] are a daughter of the king
[45:34] and Lord
[45:36] the enemy is not going to like it
[45:38] we know he's going to fight
[45:40] but we also as a household of faith join
[45:43] together
[45:44] as Sons and Daughters of God and we bind
[45:47] that power
[45:48] and that influence in and around amoya's
[45:51] life from this day we arrest your
[45:54] activity and we command you to lose her
[45:57] life her atmospheres every cell and
[46:01] every molecule of her being we bind your
[46:04] powers and your activities
[46:06] in the name of Jesus Christ
[46:10] amoya
[46:15] according to your confession
[46:18] I now baptize you in the name of the
[46:22] Lord Jesus Christ
[46:26] amen

[48:16] spirit of the Living God this morning
[48:18] amen I know I am
[48:22] Hallelujah let us turn to the Book of
[48:24] Revelations chapter three we've got two
[48:27] scriptural reading this morning
[48:29] and then we're going to go to Mark 4 11.
[48:32] we're still talking on the mystery I
[48:35] hope the mystery is becoming not a
[48:37] mystery anymore to you
[48:38] is being unfold and revealed to you
[48:42] I want to take uh the title this morning
[48:45] the mystery of the third poll is now in
[48:48] the bride
[48:49] there's many different angles that
[48:51] people preach on the third pole but I
[48:53] pray today that this angle that I'm
[48:55] going to be taking here
[48:58] would just be as simple as possible and
[49:01] that you would understand amen that's
[49:04] what it's all about is understanding we
[49:07] don't want to preach it over your head
[49:09] that you don't understand but something
[49:11] a substance that you can take in your
[49:13] life and recognize amen we need to
[49:16] recognize what God is doing in our lives
[49:18] in order to place it back into the word
[49:21] to bring Faith to us that's what it's
[49:23] all about amen hallelujah so let us turn
[49:27] to Revelations 10 3.
[49:36] and cried with a loud voice
[49:38] as when a lion roarth
[49:41] and when he had cried seven Thunders
[49:44] uttered their voices
[49:47] and when the seven Thunders uttered
[49:49] their voices
[49:50] I was about to write
[49:53] and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying
[49:56] unto me seal up those things which the
[49:59] seven Thunders uttered and write them
[50:02] not
[50:04] so they're not written
[50:07] not written
[50:09] Hallelujah
[50:11] may they be Unwritten to you this today
[50:15] brother Tim can't do it
[50:17] I'm just gonna do some
[50:20] preaching
[50:21] the way I can preach but it's him that's
[50:25] got to do it Mark 4 11.
[50:31] and he said unto them
[50:33] unto you it is given to know the
[50:35] mysteries of the kingdom of God
[50:39] it's given to you
[50:42] so the Mysteries the seven Thunders
[50:46] weren't written
[50:48] but they're given to you
[50:51] but unto them that are without all these
[50:54] things are done in parables
[50:57] that seeing they may see and not
[51:01] perceive
[51:03] and herein they may hear
[51:05] but not understand
[51:08] less at any time they should be
[51:10] converted and their sins should be
[51:12] forgiven them
[51:15] father we thank you for your love grace
[51:17] and mercy this morning
[51:21] we lift you up on high father
[51:24] we lift no man
[51:26] for you said if we lift you
[51:28] up this morning you'll draw all men unto
[51:31] thee
[51:32] that's what we need this morning Lord
[51:36] we need you father
[51:38] the spirit of the Living God to have the
[51:41] preeminence here Lord
[51:43] speak to your children you know who they
[51:46] are father
[51:48] you know their hearts
[51:50] you know their lives
[51:52] May by your spirit father speak to them
[51:55] and Lord by The Authority that's
[51:57] invested in me I take every Spirit every
[52:01] contrary Spirit under subjection to the
[52:04] Holy Ghost the word of God this morning
[52:07] Lord that you might have the preeminence
[52:10] and that the children of the Living God
[52:12] might have the Liberty
[52:15] that is purchased for them this morning
[52:18] and that we may all Rejoice together
[52:22] and again I say rejoice
[52:25] in Jesus Christ's name I pray
[52:28] you may be seated God bless you
[52:31] Hallelujah
[52:34] amen
[52:38] so we see here
[52:42] it's not written
[52:45] and we can see Thunders not Thunder
[52:48] Thunders and we can see voices not voice
[52:52] but voice is
[52:54] so when John
[52:56] was caught up
[52:58] he heard Thunders and we know the
[53:01] Thunders is the voice of God so John
[53:05] heard God speaking many things to him
[53:10] and revealing many things to him
[53:15] but he said John seal those things up
[53:20] because I don't want man to touch this
[53:24] this is left to me and me alone
[53:28] to the individual
[53:30] and I will come to them at their
[53:33] appointed time and I will reveal to them
[53:36] and that's what this is all about
[53:40] it's not about religion it's not about
[53:44] you know ourselves and what we can
[53:47] preach what we can understand and what
[53:49] you can understand
[53:51] is about him
[53:53] revealing to us who we are
[53:56] I can't tell you who you are
[53:59] it's not my position God has not given
[54:02] it to me just like he hasn't given Jesus
[54:04] many things when he was on the earth to
[54:07] know
[54:09] and it's not given us to know but he
[54:11] knows
[54:13] Hallelujah
[54:16] amen
[54:19] brother Branham speaking here
[54:22] but all this mystery is revealed only as
[54:26] he has promised to his bride
[54:30] hell is against this truth of this
[54:33] revelation of this mystery
[54:36] but the bride stands on it
[54:40] that's her stand
[54:43] what is she standing on
[54:46] the word
[54:48] the revelation of the word
[54:50] that's what she sees for is the
[54:53] revealing of the word in her life
[54:57] Hallelujah
[55:02] that's why you hunger
[55:05] that's why you thirst
[55:08] that's why you seek there's something
[55:11] inside of you that deep calling to the
[55:14] Deep
[55:15] it's not you it's the attribute what God
[55:19] placed of himself inside of you
[55:23] and this whole mystery is about getting
[55:26] yourself out of the way and letting him
[55:29] who deposit himself inside of you take
[55:33] control he knows what to do with the
[55:36] word
[55:38] when it says the bride will know what to
[55:40] do with the word is because he knows
[55:42] what to do with the word
[55:44] I have spoken I will perform saith the
[55:48] Lord
[55:50] that's what this faith is coming to my
[55:52] brothers and sisters is becoming perfect
[55:55] within us
[55:57] a perfect revelation
[56:00] of how to get out of the way and
[56:01] surrender Our Lives
[56:04] simple
[56:06] amen
[56:08] Jesus said
[56:10] you must be born again
[56:13] you must be born it must be done it's a
[56:19] must Jesus said
[56:21] or you can't see or enter into the
[56:24] kingdom of this mystery
[56:26] that's inside of you
[56:30] we've seen the first steps
[56:32] repentance
[56:34] amen being baptized
[56:38] now Faith is if faith has been placed in
[56:42] her heart
[56:43] then the promise is
[56:46] she shall receive the gift of the Holy
[56:50] Ghost
[56:51] and when the spirit of truth comes it
[56:54] will guide you and lead you into all
[56:57] truth
[57:00] Who You Are
[57:01] your position your calling your purpose
[57:06] of why this happened
[57:09] another mystery being unfolded
[57:13] another mystery being revealed
[57:16] that was in God's mind
[57:18] Hallelujah
[57:20] amen
[57:23] Hallelujah Jesus said
[57:25] amen
[57:28] to Peter
[57:30] it is given to you to know
[57:34] and it's the father who reveals it to
[57:36] you
[57:37] and he said once that is revealed to you
[57:40] the gates of hell
[57:42] will not Prevail against it
[57:44] oh the gates of hell is against it my
[57:47] brothers and sisters
[57:48] oh against what against you recognizing
[57:52] who you are
[57:54] recognizing that you're part of this
[57:56] mystery
[57:59] Hallelujah
[58:02] God
[58:04] over and over
[58:06] that's what preaching is about
[58:09] over and over until finally the light
[58:12] turns on
[58:13] you hear it over and over
[58:17] and God is not he doesn't do anything
[58:20] for nothing he knows why He's speaking
[58:24] your carnal mind might say oh I heard
[58:26] this many many times before but in the
[58:29] spirit realm God said I'm working and
[58:31] I'm doing something to break unbelief
[58:34] off your heart and off your life so you
[58:37] can really see it
[58:39] for who it is and who you are
[58:43] amen
[58:45] now the meaning of Mystery
[58:48] something that is difficult
[58:50] or impossible to understand or explain
[58:55] now keep that in mind as we go along
[58:58] here
[58:59] because that is a big part of the third
[59:02] pull
[59:03] we know that the third poll is the
[59:06] revealing of the word
[59:08] we don't know much about the third Paul
[59:10] if you go study in the message about the
[59:13] third poll there is not a lot said
[59:17] because just as John said write it not
[59:21] even God himself to the prophet said no
[59:26] no the first Paul you explained you made
[59:29] a mess of it the second Paul you did the
[59:31] same thing and I told you not to but
[59:33] this third Paul
[59:36] I'm not leaving it nobody's not even the
[59:39] prophet's hands but I myself have come
[59:42] down
[59:44] I myself will reveal it and I myself
[59:48] will take control of it
[59:50] now
[59:52] and that's what he's doing now
[59:54] he's the one walking in the midst of the
[59:56] golden candlesticks he's the one walking
[59:58] up and down the pews not man but God
[1:00:04] revealing these things
[1:00:09] glory to God
[1:00:11] look at this mystery my brothers and
[1:00:13] sisters look at this third Paul
[1:00:16] this third poll has been activated and
[1:00:18] moving since the Garden of Eden
[1:00:21] but we didn't understand down Through
[1:00:25] the Ages they didn't understand until
[1:00:27] this day when God sent a prophet and
[1:00:31] revealed all these Mysteries that were
[1:00:33] unfolded
[1:00:34] now we can look back
[1:00:37] amen and see that the third Paul was
[1:00:40] manifesting all down through history
[1:00:47] let's take a look at Abraham
[1:00:52] we never connected like Abraham and that
[1:00:54] to the third pole
[1:00:56] third pull was operating
[1:00:59] Abraham father of our faith
[1:01:02] the faith sheet of Abraham the Royal
[1:01:04] Seed of Abraham came
[1:01:07] Hallelujah
[1:01:09] all connected together
[1:01:11] God promised to Abraham to have a son
[1:01:15] when it was impossible for Sarah to
[1:01:17] conceive there's that word
[1:01:19] I told you keep it in your mind
[1:01:22] impossible difficult to understand or
[1:01:26] explain
[1:01:27] okay
[1:01:29] when it was impossible for Sarah to
[1:01:32] conceive
[1:01:33] God revealed to Abraham by faith
[1:01:36] but then God had to change Sarah and
[1:01:40] Abraham back to young man and woman to
[1:01:42] fulfill the promise
[1:01:45] and what did God have to do
[1:01:48] it says right here God visited Sarah
[1:01:53] whoa my
[1:01:55] that's the visitation when God visited
[1:01:59] Sarah
[1:02:00] then the promise The Impossible came
[1:02:04] into view
[1:02:06] when God visits you when God spoke to
[1:02:10] you when God called you
[1:02:12] that was the third Paul
[1:02:15] the revealing of him and the revealing
[1:02:18] of you in your life
[1:02:21] that's all we need
[1:02:23] that's all we need today
[1:02:25] that's all we need going forward in the
[1:02:27] future is God to visit us
[1:02:31] and reveal these things to us
[1:02:33] amen
[1:02:36] and when he visited her
[1:02:37] he revealed to her you're going to
[1:02:40] conceive This Promise
[1:02:43] it's going to be fulfilled
[1:02:46] and that whole experience was God
[1:02:50] manifesting the third pull to Sarah
[1:02:53] Oh Glory to God when God visited us the
[1:02:58] only thing he says amen because God is
[1:03:00] the word
[1:03:01] Amen in the beginning was the word the
[1:03:04] word was with God and the Word was God
[1:03:06] it's all about the word and when God
[1:03:09] visited us he comes and speaks the word
[1:03:11] to us the promises to us and like Sarah
[1:03:15] he says you're going to conceive
[1:03:18] the promise that I give you in this day
[1:03:21] and this hour of a body change a Rapture
[1:03:24] you're going to conceive
[1:03:27] oh my
[1:03:30] glory to God
[1:03:33] we look back in the Bible
[1:03:35] at Enoch
[1:03:38] you talk about the third poll
[1:03:39] manifesting
[1:03:41] Enoch walk Walking with God and by
[1:03:45] Walking with God the word Enoch was
[1:03:48] translated and raptured as we walk with
[1:03:52] god with this perfect Faith feeding on
[1:03:56] it that is the mystery and the miracle
[1:03:59] that is unexplainable
[1:04:02] of the third Paul it's the creation of
[1:04:05] God himself creating in us the change
[1:04:09] that we need to live eternally the
[1:04:12] change that we need to be raptured
[1:04:16] Walking with God
[1:04:18] walk in with the word amen every day
[1:04:23] Enoch walk with God he walked in faith
[1:04:28] oh my Hallelujah glory to God thank you

[1:04:34] Hallelujah
[1:04:37] I knew this wasn't going to be easy but
[1:04:39] that's okay
[1:04:40] the real word when it comes forth is
[1:04:42] never easy
[1:04:43] Hallelujah because it's not me don't
[1:04:45] think I'm talking about myself or I'm
[1:04:48] special special gift or anything like
[1:04:50] that but it's him

[1:10:24] and recognizing that God had to deal
[1:10:26] with me God had to bring me through so

[1:11:14] promises of her day
[1:11:16] that is the third Paul
[1:11:18] that will be completed in her in the
[1:11:21] same way God changed Abraham and Sarah's
[1:11:23] body God will change his bride back to
[1:11:28] being young again the third pull is
[1:11:30] revealing the word and the word is the
[1:11:33] one that is doing it in this hour
[1:11:37] not anything else but the word
[1:11:41] now I'm emphasizing on certain things
[1:11:43] because I'm going to get to certain
[1:11:45] things down the road

[1:11:54] will be no impersonation
[1:11:57] it will be just a manifestation

[1:12:04] you know because every time God gives us
[1:12:06] something and we try to understand it we
[1:12:09] tried to figure it out then we tried to
[1:12:12] manifest it oh look at the law look at
[1:12:15] the legalism in this message How can
[1:12:17] there be legalism when we oh this is the
[1:12:19] message of Grace Grace call and Grace

[1:12:25] message

[1:12:52] and they came out on the other side
[1:12:54] change
[1:12:57] they could not explain what happened
[1:12:59] because there was no impersonation or
[1:13:03] explanation to this it was just a
[1:13:07] manifestation that nobody can explain
[1:13:10] when God visited you at the appointed
[1:13:13] time there will be no explanation to
[1:13:17] what has happened it will just be the
[1:13:20] promise manifested in your life

[1:13:42] tent to the other side of the tent the
[1:13:44] word

[1:15:59] Seen I never seen that scripture like
[1:16:01] that before faith is a things hoped for
[1:16:04] the evidence of Things Not Seen is not
[1:16:07] seen amen it's not conceived by us it's
[1:16:12] not done by us

[1:16:16] this manifestation this Deliverance it's
[1:16:19] unexplainable
[1:16:21] uncomprehendable

[1:16:27] Oh Glory to God
[1:16:29] Hallelujah
[1:16:31] yes through faith Sarah received
[1:16:33] strength to conceive seed and was
[1:16:36] delivered of a child
[1:16:37] when she was past age because she judged
[1:16:41] him faithful who had promised
[1:16:43] that's all we need to do
[1:16:46] judge him faithful
[1:16:47] is he faithful

[1:17:16] these things to you and I will change
[1:17:18] you what do you think these chains have
[1:17:20] been taking place brother Brandon says

[1:17:38] visiting us
[1:17:40] and revealing to us
[1:17:42] oh my Hallelujah
[1:17:45] glory to God
[1:17:48] amen Mark 11 22.
[1:17:51] Jesus answered and said unto them have
[1:17:54] faith in God
[1:17:56] for verily I say unto you whatsoever
[1:17:59] shall say unto this mountain be thou
[1:18:02] removed and be cast in the sea
[1:18:05] and shall not doubt in his heart
[1:18:08] but shall believe that those things
[1:18:10] which he said shall come to pass he
[1:18:13] shall have whatsoever he said
[1:18:15] now that scripture became a new
[1:18:17] scripture to me
[1:18:19] it didn't become a human
[1:18:21] effort work in up scripture
[1:18:25] oh I got to speak unto this mountain
[1:18:28] I gotta say unto this mountain
[1:18:30] but it all became different to me when
[1:18:33] he says when you say unto this mountain
[1:18:36] is actually him
[1:18:37] it's actually him saying unto this
[1:18:40] mountain
[1:18:41] amen it's actually him when the spoken
[1:18:45] word was manifested in the prophet it
[1:18:48] was him manifesting the spoken word God
[1:18:52] was just using his lips to speak what he
[1:18:55] wanted to be spoken
[1:18:57] Hallelujah God gives you faith
[1:19:00] God reveals Faith to you and that's what
[1:19:04] you speak it's him doing it not you
[1:19:06] because we speak to so many things
[1:19:10] we speak to so many things and then our
[1:19:12] faith gets discouraged when that
[1:19:15] mountain stays right there
[1:19:18] the right approach to God Amen
[1:19:23] and see a nut
[1:19:25] Ezekiel 36 26 a new heart will I give
[1:19:30] you

[1:19:42] he's doing it
[1:19:45] Hallelujah
[1:19:47] the king's sword was placed in the
[1:19:49] prophet's hand and we know the sword is
[1:19:52] the word of God
[1:19:54] it was not even written in symbols but
[1:19:58] when the king's sword was placed in the
[1:20:00] prophet's hand then the Seven Seals were
[1:20:03] opened and the third Paul was now
[1:20:05] starting to reveal to the bride what was
[1:20:10] not written and and I believed it was
[1:20:14] the Awakening of the Bride to understand
[1:20:16] who she is and her position
[1:20:20] God reveals her whole life everything
[1:20:24] that's happened to her and the purpose
[1:20:27] why things are happening to her and why
[1:20:30] it happened to her
[1:20:32] you weren't saved on a certain day amen
[1:20:35] you are always in the mind of God
[1:20:38] don't want to bring you back to a day
[1:20:41] that you were saved or day that you
[1:20:43] recognized but he wants to bring you
[1:20:45] back with him that you are with him
[1:20:48] in his mind
[1:20:50] glory to God
[1:20:52] Glory
[1:20:54] Hallelujah
[1:20:56] revealing to her her purpose revealing
[1:21:00] to her her life
[1:21:01] why things had to happen the way they
[1:21:04] happen in your life why you had to go
[1:21:06] through the things that you had to go
[1:21:07] through
[1:21:08] Hallelujah that the footsteps of the
[1:21:11] righteous are ordered of the Lord not
[1:21:14] only when you were here but when you
[1:21:15] were out there God was ordering your
[1:21:18] life all along the way
[1:21:20] why because it was him
[1:21:23] there was him in you
[1:21:26] he deposited himself in you
[1:21:29] and he swore by himself
[1:21:31] amen I have spoken my word not only
[1:21:35] through a prophet in these last days but
[1:21:37] before the foundation of the world when
[1:21:39] he spoke everything into existence I
[1:21:41] spoke my word and it won't return void
[1:21:44] back to me
[1:21:45] and we can see all down Through the Ages
[1:21:47] Satan trying to to take that seed try to
[1:21:51] kill that seed but God spoke amen his
[1:21:55] word he spoke us and that's why we're
[1:21:57] here today

[1:22:18] God can't take care of you God can't
[1:22:20] watch over you God can't deliver you
[1:22:23] and what he's done all down Through the
[1:22:24] Ages that bring us to this time and this
[1:22:27] moment in life
[1:22:29] Hallelujah
[1:22:31] glory to God
[1:22:33] amen that King's sword
[1:22:35] hey was placed in the prophet's hands
[1:22:38] announced
[1:22:39] in the bride's hands
[1:22:41] glory to God
[1:22:43] amen
[1:22:45] Hallelujah
[1:22:48] God has always
[1:22:50] in every age has hid himself behind the
[1:22:52] veil
[1:22:54] but he's been God all the time
[1:22:57] you see
[1:22:59] I say that for a reason
[1:23:01] I said that before see
[1:23:05] but he kept himself hid from the world
[1:23:07] and revealed himself to the elected
[1:23:11] all the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:23:13] was in this person Jesus Christ
[1:23:17] he was God and God Alone
[1:23:21] not a third person not a second person
[1:23:25] or even a first person
[1:23:28] no
[1:23:30] but he was the person of God
[1:23:33] failed in human flesh
[1:23:36] Hallelujah
[1:23:39] no confusion here when God speaks when
[1:23:43] God does something
[1:23:44] he's not the author of confusion Satan
[1:23:47] is
[1:23:48] he's the person of God himself
[1:23:51] and what is he saying here he said he
[1:23:53] came himself
[1:23:55] he's the person of God in you himself
[1:24:00] not anything else but the true and one
[1:24:03] living God that was veiled and hid down
[1:24:07] Through the Ages has veiled has wrecked
[1:24:10] the veil in this day and age
[1:24:14] and now that true God
[1:24:16] is manifesting himself
[1:24:19] that's who's inside of you
[1:24:21] oh Hallelujah

[1:24:38] great is the mystery of godliness
[1:24:40] for God g-o-d Elohim capital in the
[1:24:44] Bible it refers to him as original in
[1:24:48] the beginning Elohim see
[1:24:50] and Elohim without controversy
[1:24:53] Hallelujah without debate argument
[1:24:57] great is the mystery of Elohim for
[1:24:59] Elohim was made flesh and we handled him
[1:25:07] Glory
[1:25:09] Elohim veiled in human flesh
[1:25:12] the great Jehovah that covered all space
[1:25:15] and time and every Wares was made man we
[1:25:21] handle him Elohim the unveiling of God
[1:25:25] God made flesh
[1:25:28] what a what
[1:25:31] what am I trying to try to say here
[1:25:36] the Holy Spirit
[1:25:39] God
[1:25:41] this is nothing but God
[1:25:44] this in your life is nothing but God
[1:25:47] Elohim
[1:25:49] not not not anything else not no
[1:25:52] Superstition not no fantasy not no gifts
[1:25:55] this is God Elohim himself
[1:26:00] when we can recognize that God owl him
[1:26:03] is inside of us
[1:26:08] the Bible says you'll do when they
[1:26:10] recognize their God that they serve as
[1:26:12] the god that's in them they'll do great
[1:26:14] exports
[1:26:16] Hallelujah they'll take this word
[1:26:19] in their lives right to the Rapture
[1:26:21] right to their Deliverance
[1:26:24] an old devil in hell can stand against
[1:26:28] you this morning if you take that word
[1:26:30] of God
[1:26:31] and speak it
[1:26:36] the gates of hell can't Prevail against
[1:26:38] this
[1:26:40] Elohim
[1:26:41] is in you
[1:26:44] made flesh again
[1:26:46] that's what he's trying to say
[1:26:48] that's what the prophets try to say not
[1:26:50] just tell you about Elohim back there
[1:26:52] but Elohim up here Elohim here what is
[1:26:55] he doing
[1:26:57] Where's God today where is he living
[1:26:59] today
[1:27:02] oh Jesus
[1:27:05] the reality of God brother coffee amen
[1:27:08] the reality of God oh thank you Jesus
[1:27:12] amen
[1:27:15] Amen brother Brown speaking here
[1:27:17] but since Pentecost
[1:27:20] since the crucifixion
[1:27:22] when that veil was rent from top to
[1:27:25] bottom for that generation
[1:27:27] Jesus was that God veiled
[1:27:30] and when he died on Calvary God sent the
[1:27:32] fire and lightning to rip that Veil from
[1:27:35] top to bottom
[1:27:36] that whole Mercy Seat was in plain view
[1:27:39] but they were too blind to see it
[1:27:42] as Paul said in the reading of Moses
[1:27:45] when Moses is read yet the veil is still
[1:27:49] on their hearts today
[1:27:53] Moses types of prophet
[1:27:57] the letter of the word
[1:27:59] not the unwritten word
[1:28:01] but the letter of the word
[1:28:04] see the ones who have given eyes to see
[1:28:07] and ears to hear can recognize what the
[1:28:09] spirit is saying to the church
[1:28:12] that this is happening again today
[1:28:17] when the prophet's message is read and
[1:28:18] the quotes are read
[1:28:21] the veil is still on their hearts
[1:28:23] not recognizing
[1:28:26] that he's in plain view
[1:28:28] again today
[1:28:30] and we Behold Him we beheld him we
[1:28:34] handled him
[1:28:35] oh God
[1:28:38] oh Lord Jesus
[1:28:41] brother Branham oh brothers and sisters
[1:28:44] that's what the Jews did when the veil
[1:28:46] was rent and brought God into Plain View
[1:28:49] hanging on the cross
[1:28:51] he was in plain view
[1:28:54] they couldn't see it
[1:28:57] could it be possible
[1:28:59] that the Gentiles has done the same
[1:29:02] thing
[1:29:04] oh God he says
[1:29:07] and God took the veil off of it and
[1:29:10] brought into Plain View
[1:29:13] in this day
[1:29:16] and they are ready to crucify it again
[1:29:22] oh
[1:29:28] help me
[1:29:30] um
[1:29:33] Hallelujah
[1:29:35] Lord Jesus
[1:29:37] remember Satan will try to impersonate
[1:29:40] it he'll try to impersonate everything
[1:29:43] that the church will do
[1:29:44] we notice it through the Antichrist but
[1:29:48] this is one thing he can't impersonate
[1:29:50] it'll be no mimics to this thing
[1:29:52] because he don't know it there's no way
[1:29:55] for him to know it it's the third pull
[1:29:57] he just don't know nothing about it see
[1:30:00] he doesn't understand it
[1:30:05] he don't understand you
[1:30:07] he don't know nothing about you
[1:30:10] but we constantly let him interpret to
[1:30:13] us who we are when he doesn't know you
[1:30:17] even your natural family don't even know
[1:30:19] you
[1:30:20] unless God rips the veil off of their
[1:30:23] eyes they won't see who's really behind
[1:30:25] there
[1:30:26] living behind there
[1:30:29] oh God it's you and God Alone
[1:30:35] how many times
[1:30:37] I gotta read this and I'll read this
[1:30:39] because the spirit leads me to read it
[1:30:41] he knows nothing about this you don't
[1:30:43] understand it
[1:30:45] he can't impersonate this
[1:30:48] so kick him out
[1:30:51] kick him out of your thoughts out of
[1:30:53] your mind
[1:30:55] all doubts doubt your doubts
[1:31:00] of Who You Are
[1:31:02] of who this word and this preaching and
[1:31:04] the Bible says you are
[1:31:08] glory to God
[1:31:10] letting people
[1:31:12] that know nothing about this
[1:31:14] I gotta bring it right home interpret to
[1:31:16] you who you are
[1:31:19] carnal people people from your
[1:31:21] workplaces you're maybe your husband
[1:31:23] that's not saved your wife that's not
[1:31:25] saved
[1:31:26] family members
[1:31:28] and try to interpret to you who this is
[1:31:31] oh my brothers and sisters
[1:31:36] separation
[1:31:38] always
[1:31:39] when the word of God comes it produces a
[1:31:42] separation and it always exposes the
[1:31:45] devil
[1:31:46] Hallelujah
[1:31:48] glory to God yeah but Satan is working
[1:31:51] hard to distract us deceive us and
[1:31:53] hinder us from seeing this truth that's
[1:31:56] why he fights it so much so we must not
[1:31:59] let Satan interpret the word to us
[1:32:01] personally in our walks in our life
[1:32:03] because he knows nothing about this
[1:32:06] just like he spoke to Eve
[1:32:09] he you know that you know when he spoke
[1:32:11] to Eve in the Garden of Eden we all know
[1:32:13] the story
[1:32:14] you know he he didn't know nothing about
[1:32:16] that tree of life
[1:32:19] he didn't know nothing what God revealed
[1:32:21] to Eve
[1:32:22] until Eve spoken

[1:32:27] the serpent came said eat of this tree
[1:32:30] oh no no no we we shall not the Lord God
[1:32:33] said not eat of that tree

[1:32:39] husband the head
[1:32:41] Christ is our head
[1:32:44] not to eat of that tree but when she did
[1:32:46] it what does Satan do he twisted it
[1:32:49] he perverted it
[1:32:51] I said oh

[1:44:15] down in the Dark Ages where they had to
[1:44:16] give their life the anointing was there
[1:44:19] everything that they had to go through
[1:44:20] God send the anointing there and the
[1:44:23] anointing is hair the anointing is being

[1:45:08] people will just believe in man-made
[1:45:10] Fables
[1:45:11] Romans 10 17 so then Faith come by here
[1:45:15] and here and by the word of God
[1:45:19] deception
[1:45:21] is based on claiming
[1:45:24] now listen to me and hear me out
[1:45:27] before you get critical
[1:45:30] claiming that brother Brandon's quotes
[1:45:32] are the voice of God
[1:45:34] now listen to brother Branham the eagle
[1:45:36] stirs her nest
[1:45:38] 1960. I'm saying it for a reason
[1:45:41] I tell you it pays you to listen to the
[1:45:44] voice of God
[1:45:45] the still Small Voice that speaks deep
[1:45:48] and Rich
[1:45:50] it attracts the attention of his people
[1:45:53] we know the Bible is right
[1:45:57] that's not my voice
[1:46:00] the word it's not my voice he says
[1:46:02] that's God's voice speaking
[1:46:06] in the chosen of a bride but the word of
[1:46:10] God attracts the bride of Christ while
[1:46:13] the true bride attracts the attention of
[1:46:16] God by keeping his word
[1:46:19] that's how she attracts God by keeping
[1:46:22] his word you heard it many many times
[1:46:24] over here in the spirit back to the word
[1:46:28] back to this truth back to the original
[1:46:31] faith
[1:46:33] that will produce
[1:46:36] oh the spirit of God has to fight what
[1:46:39] man has done what man has interpreted
[1:46:41] what man's doctrines have come
[1:46:45] you're going to see rate you're going to
[1:46:48] see right in here amen that we we look
[1:46:51] at the Catholic Church the mother of
[1:46:53] heartless and all that stuff that
[1:46:55] Catholic spirit is right here in the
[1:46:57] message
[1:46:59] right here
[1:47:01] watch
[1:47:02] the early church searched the scriptures
[1:47:05] to check what Paul Saint Paul was saying
[1:47:08] acts 17 10 when the Brethren immediately
[1:47:12] sent Away Paul as Silas by night
[1:47:15] who come in hither went into the
[1:47:17] synagogue of the Jews there they were
[1:47:20] Noble then those in thessalonia in that
[1:47:26] they received the word with all
[1:47:29] Readiness of mine and searched the
[1:47:32] Scriptures Daily whether those things
[1:47:35] were so
[1:47:37] if we would search the Scriptures Daily
[1:47:42] and see that the things that have been
[1:47:44] spoken are so
[1:47:47] we let so many things distract us hinder
[1:47:51] us this life
[1:47:53] God help us
[1:47:55] you know the more we have the more
[1:47:58] material things we have the more
[1:48:00] responsibility we have amen sometimes
[1:48:03] it's more the curse that we have
[1:48:06] the less we have even as you get older
[1:48:09] the less you have the less you give away
[1:48:11] the more free you are
[1:48:18] why do we need all this stuff
[1:48:21] why do we need to burden ourselves
[1:48:25] when we can't search the Scriptures
[1:48:28] Daily
[1:48:29] now listen message preferred to search
[1:48:32] the quotes to confirm their base
[1:48:35] opinions brother brothers Ministry had
[1:48:38] produced two types of Believers we know
[1:48:40] there's three types but two right here
[1:48:42] the bride who wants him to reveal the
[1:48:45] understanding of the Bible the Mysteries
[1:48:47] to them and they that they can prove
[1:48:50] from the scriptures
[1:48:53] see it's the word that gives you faith
[1:48:56] not anything else but the word
[1:49:00] you bring back the scriptures you bring
[1:49:03] back the quotes back to the scriptures
[1:49:07] now listen
[1:49:11] the bride who wants him to reveal they
[1:49:13] understand the Bible the Mysteries and
[1:49:15] the foolish virgin who want to exalt him
[1:49:18] to the godhead so that they can believe
[1:49:21] their interpretations of his quotes and
[1:49:24] ignore the hard work of studying and
[1:49:27] understanding the word of God digging
[1:49:30] deep into the word
[1:49:32] the foolish virgins claim that brother
[1:49:33] Branham is infallible
[1:49:35] this is a Roman Catherine Doctrine
[1:49:37] because they say the pope is infallible
[1:49:40] this Doctrine was announced in 1870 the
[1:49:44] pope is the figurehead of the Antichrist
[1:49:47] Spirit brother Brandon speaking here the
[1:49:50] key to the door 1962 some brethren up
[1:49:53] there that said I had sent them up there
[1:49:57] and they that are preaching to men up
[1:50:01] there should leave their wives and hunt
[1:50:03] for their spiritual mate and that I am
[1:50:05] perfectly infallible he goes oh my
[1:50:09] he said that is some awful things that
[1:50:12] I've heard that were said about me
[1:50:14] being infallible would make brother
[1:50:16] Branham another Pope how awful is that
[1:50:23] well listen
[1:50:25] I'm not finished yet
[1:50:27] William Branham came to give us
[1:50:29] Revelation on the written word
[1:50:32] that's it
[1:50:34] not like people are saying he was God he
[1:50:37] unveiled the scriptures he unveiled the
[1:50:39] word what are we talking about what have
[1:50:42] we been talking about
[1:50:43] I thought it was Jesus Christ
[1:50:46] I thought the third poll cannot be
[1:50:48] impersonated by men
[1:50:53] think about it
[1:50:58] that would take us back to the teachings
[1:51:00] of the original Apostles in the first
[1:51:02] age
[1:51:03] we must use his quotes to explain the
[1:51:07] scriptures
[1:51:08] and not use his quotes to replace
[1:51:10] scriptures
[1:51:15] if his quotes can't be backed up by the
[1:51:18] word
[1:51:20] he even said of himself if what I'm
[1:51:22] saying is not in the word then leave it
[1:51:27] oh my
[1:51:28] this is this is very very touchy ground
[1:51:31] that I can say some things
[1:51:34] but people will misunderstand
[1:51:37] let the spirit reveal it to those
[1:51:40] Hallelujah
[1:51:42] Jesus said heavens and earth will pass
[1:51:44] away but my word will remain
[1:51:48] he said also in the beginning was the
[1:51:50] word the word was with God and the Word
[1:51:52] was God
[1:51:55] the only way we can establish our faith
[1:51:58] is based on the word of God my brothers
[1:52:00] and sisters
[1:52:02] this is the third poll being revealed to
[1:52:05] the individual this is the spirit of
[1:52:07] Truth guiding and leading you into all
[1:52:10] truth
[1:52:11] Hallelujah
[1:52:13] I'm going to try to wind this down
[1:52:17] Hallelujah
[1:52:20] Hallelujah
[1:52:22] everything that the that was given to
[1:52:24] the prophet is given to the bride by the
[1:52:27] third pull is Sovereign Grace it's given
[1:52:30] purposely to the individual we need to
[1:52:32] get our minds out of the way and let the
[1:52:35] grace come in
[1:52:36] people find security in gifts because
[1:52:39] when they pray to God God answers I
[1:52:42] preach to people God and the people tell
[1:52:45] me God spoke to me through your
[1:52:47] preaching I laid hands upon the sick and
[1:52:49] they were healed but this third pull is
[1:52:52] not a gift
[1:52:54] we know speaking in tongues is a gift of
[1:52:57] the spirit as a manifestation of the
[1:53:00] spirit but it's not the evidence of the
[1:53:02] spirit
[1:53:05] Hallelujah
[1:53:06] God filtering all these uh wrong
[1:53:10] opinions and and wrong interpretations
[1:53:13] under your mind
[1:53:14] because you cannot produce this word for
[1:53:17] this hour with these things believe in
[1:53:20] these things that they're the absolute
[1:53:23] that's what's taking place right now
[1:53:25] God filtering all these things out of
[1:53:28] you
[1:53:30] we would believe we'd all have to speak
[1:53:32] in tongues if we believe it sounds
[1:53:34] stupid doesn't it sounds foolish if we
[1:53:36] all have to speak in tongues and believe
[1:53:38] that we had the Holy Ghost it sounds
[1:53:39] foolish to us now
[1:53:40] but that's the same thing what I'm
[1:53:42] saying here
[1:53:43] all these things I'm saying here
[1:53:46] Hallelujah
[1:53:48] Hallelujah
[1:53:50] the third pull is a part of being born
[1:53:52] again it comes with repentance
[1:53:55] so gifts can be dangerous and the more
[1:53:58] gifts that you have
[1:54:00] the more you need to ask God to help
[1:54:02] humble you
[1:54:04] so you can see the third poll manifest
[1:54:06] station in your life
[1:54:08] because it's not connected to gifts or
[1:54:11] works
[1:54:13] it's Revelation by God
[1:54:15] himself
[1:54:17] we need to stay in the pattern
[1:54:20] that was shown to us through the
[1:54:22] prophet's life
[1:54:23] the third pull came into manifestation
[1:54:26] through him the same pattern will be
[1:54:29] repeated again I will ride this Trail
[1:54:32] again I will ride this perfection in a
[1:54:36] people in flesh again I will bring the
[1:54:39] word back and flesh again this word will
[1:54:42] overcome
[1:54:43] I will bring Sons and Daughters of God
[1:54:46] back into manifestation in this day and
[1:54:48] age
[1:54:49] there was a pattern that was laid out
[1:54:53] listen when I when I listen to those
[1:54:55] tapes at the beginning
[1:54:57] Hallelujah all I heard all I've seen
[1:55:01] I didn't even understand but was Christ
[1:55:04] I've seen a life
[1:55:07] brother Brandon I didn't even see him I
[1:55:08] see Jesus Christ I've seen a life amen
[1:55:11] speaking through the word of God
[1:55:14] and it was speaking to me
[1:55:16] I want to manifest in you
[1:55:18] this is why I called you this is why I'm
[1:55:21] revealing these things to you amen
[1:55:25] Hallelujah glory to God
[1:55:28] oh my there's just so much I'm going to
[1:55:30] have to
[1:55:34] we have a church meeting here we want to
[1:55:36] get to I want to honor that
[1:55:41] Hallelujah
[1:55:44] hallelujah we're just going to have to
[1:55:45] get into the character
[1:55:47] building later
[1:55:49] Amen brother Brown says
[1:55:53] power without character satanic
[1:55:57] Hallelujah
[1:56:00] glory to God
[1:56:03] let us fight the musicians up
[1:56:11] amen
[1:56:14] Hallelujah
[1:56:16] we know about the two stories in the
[1:56:18] Bible
[1:56:20] the slave
[1:56:25] the buyer says you feed him differently
[1:56:30] do you treat him differently
[1:56:33] no
[1:56:35] then why is he so different
[1:56:39] why does he conduct himself so different
[1:56:41] it stands so different
[1:56:42] and walk so different talk so different
[1:56:46] why is there strength in his back he's
[1:56:49] got a backbone in other words
[1:56:52] is because he looks across the sea
[1:56:55] and he has a father that's King
[1:56:59] and he knows where he comes from
[1:57:03] he knows that being a slave in that
[1:57:05] condition
[1:57:06] was not him
[1:57:10] he doesn't identify with that
[1:57:13] but he identifies back home his home
[1:57:17] and that's why he conducts himself that
[1:57:19] way
[1:57:20] and that's like us the Bride of Jesus
[1:57:22] Christ
[1:57:23] we don't identify with this flesh in
[1:57:25] this world
[1:57:26] but we look
[1:57:28] to where our home is and where we come
[1:57:30] from
[1:57:31] and that's why we walk and we talk and
[1:57:33] we live the way we do
[1:57:35] and we're faithful
[1:57:37] the dishwasher woman
[1:57:39] when the kid when the Sun
[1:57:43] came and looked the rich man's son came
[1:57:46] and looked for a woman
[1:57:48] all so many beautiful churches so many
[1:57:51] beautiful women out there all dolled up
[1:57:54] and decked out and everything
[1:57:57] he's seen through the phoniness
[1:58:00] let me tell you why he called you today
[1:58:05] because
[1:58:06] he's seen through all that phoniness
[1:58:08] your life might have been upside down
[1:58:12] might have been
[1:58:13] nothing
[1:58:15] nobody thinking of you nobody
[1:58:18] maybe you thinking nothing of yourself
[1:58:22] but he's seen through all the phoniness
[1:58:24] out there and he came to you
[1:58:27] And that son came to that dishwasher
[1:58:29] woman and said who am I
[1:58:32] who am I
[1:58:34] that you would come to me
[1:58:37] and he said
[1:58:39] I have been watching
[1:58:43] I have been indigenously looking
[1:58:47] and I see character in you I have found
[1:58:51] character that I like in you
[1:58:53] [Music]
[1:58:55] oh my brothers and sisters
[1:58:58] [Music]
[1:59:01] what's the third pull doing it's
[1:59:03] building character
[1:59:05] in US
[1:59:06] [Music]
[1:59:13] the unveiling of God
[1:59:15] [Music]
[1:59:16] Moses was veiled
[1:59:19] by The Living Word of God failed behind
[1:59:21] human flesh oh brothers and sisters are
[1:59:23] you catching it this morning
[1:59:26] congregation says amen
[1:59:30] we got an amen
[1:59:33] look
[1:59:34] don't you see
[1:59:36] it's been veiled through these ages
[1:59:38] according to what God has said and it
[1:59:41] will be open in the last days those
[1:59:43] Seven Seals would be broke and the full
[1:59:46] thing will come into into view of the
[1:59:49] people
[1:59:51] what's tooken place all along
[1:59:54] [Music]
[1:59:56] what John could not write
[2:00:00] and what has been taken place all down
[2:00:02] Through the Ages through all their lives
[2:00:05] will come into plain view in this hour
[2:00:08] Hallelujah
[2:00:11] just absolutely the Living Word of God
[2:00:14] in individuals the unveiling of God
[2:00:18] so now we are invited into him
[2:00:22] to be partakers of all that he is
[2:00:27] which is hid to the unbelievers
[2:00:30] by the veil of human flesh see
[2:00:34] they know of that Glory
[2:00:37] they read of it in his word here
[2:00:40] the glory of God
[2:00:42] and the things like that
[2:00:45] but it's just a word to them
[2:00:52] but to us
[2:00:54] it's a manifestation
[2:00:57] see
[2:00:58] it's no more a word to the Bride of
[2:01:01] Jesus Christ it's no more a written word
[2:01:05] but now it's become a reality
[2:01:11] oh
[2:01:14] Hallelujah
[2:01:16] oh God
[2:01:21] the third pull
[2:01:24] unexplainable
[2:01:29] can't explain it
[2:01:31] can interpret it
[2:01:34] you can't do nothing
[2:01:36] it's just a manifestation
[2:01:38] it's just the creation of God
[2:01:41] when God speaks his word
[2:01:44] God spoke to squirrels
[2:01:48] was the creation of God we try to work
[2:01:50] up things that speak things
[2:01:52] that wasn't brother Brandon working up
[2:01:53] Creighton squirrels
[2:01:55] Hattie writes children
[2:01:58] it wasn't brother Branham saying you
[2:02:00] know what the Bible says that you know
[2:02:02] your children are coming they're part of
[2:02:04] you
[2:02:04] [Music]
[2:02:07] that's not what it is you can believe
[2:02:09] what you want to believe and I respect
[2:02:11] that that's not what it is that's not
[2:02:12] the revelation
[2:02:15] but when he gave that to Hattie Wright
[2:02:18] God gave it to him and says you give
[2:02:21] Hattie right
[2:02:22] whatever she wants
[2:02:25] it wasn't brother Brown saying how do
[2:02:26] you write I give you whatever you want
[2:02:28] God told Brother Branham you give Hattie
[2:02:31] right whatever she wants
[2:02:35] that is the right connection here
[2:02:38] God said to brother Branham how many
[2:02:40] squirrels do you want
[2:02:42] I want to let then you I give it to you
[2:02:45] speak it
[2:02:50] oh my

[2:02:56] Walking with God
[2:02:59] Hallelujah
[2:03:01] I trust
[2:03:03] it was simple enough
[2:03:06] for you to understand
[2:03:08] that God give you something
[2:03:11] and if not when you leave this place
[2:03:15] you'll recognize
[2:03:17] this place
[2:03:18] is a natural building
[2:03:21] but there's a supernatural tent that we
[2:03:23] were in this morning
[2:03:26] Hallelujah and when you walk out of
[2:03:28] these this tent
