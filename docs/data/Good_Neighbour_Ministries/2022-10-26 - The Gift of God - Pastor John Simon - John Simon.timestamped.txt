[24:27] we'll pass it on to you and keep you
[24:31] updated as to what is really happening
[24:34] but for tonight we will speak on the
[24:38] topic of
[24:40] the the gift of God
[24:43] the gift of God or God's gift to us for
[24:47] the gift of God is eternal life praise
[24:51] the Lord a gracious Heavenly Father
[24:54] we thank you
[24:57] we thank you this evening
[24:59] for the wonderful words of life
[25:03] as we read from Romans 6 23 uh tonight
[25:09] Lord
[25:10] may your Holy Spirit hover over the word
[25:13] of God may your great spirit go forth in
[25:19] the Lands Beyond wherever our voice is
[25:24] heard and father May the influence of
[25:30] the power of the Gospel
[25:33] endure and let it reach Those whom he is
[25:38] supposed to reach Lord may the great
[25:41] Holy Spirit minister to us everyone and
[25:45] lift us up open our hearts father
[25:48] straighten us father we commit ourselves
[25:52] to thee now yielding for service and may
[25:56] we all have a wonderful time feasting
[26:01] upon youth we ask it in Jesus name with
[26:05] all the praise to you father amen
[26:08] from The Book of Romans
[26:15] chapter 6. verse 23 one of the early
[26:21] verses that I remember memorizing this
[26:24] when I was just still a boy uh one of
[26:28] the first scriptures you memorize and it
[26:31] reads
[26:32] for the wages of sin is death
[26:37] but the gift of God is eternal life
[26:42] through Jesus Christ Our Lord
[26:46] now it says here in the margin that the
[26:49] literal translation of that is
[26:52] for the gift of God is eternal life
[26:56] in
[26:58] Jesus Christ
[27:00] our Lord if you're in him then
[27:04] you have eternal life because he is
[27:06] eternal life there is no other eternal
[27:09] life he is the one that is eternal oh
[27:13] praise God please be seated
[27:17] amen
[27:19] well
[27:21] I'm talking about God's gift to you God
[27:26] God's gift to me uh uh and the nominal
[27:30] Christian will say God's gift to us
[27:34] eternal life is to us because Jesus died
[27:38] on Calvary and now we can repent of our
[27:43] sins we can confess our all and we will
[27:46] be freely forgiven and we will receive
[27:50] eternal life through repentance and
[27:53] confession before God and that is what
[27:57] we also believed for a very long time
[28:00] according to church doctrines and
[28:03] teachings which we might have heard
[28:05] but we have come to understand
[28:09] by the ministry of the Holy Spirit
[28:12] through an anointed Prophet for our day
[28:16] bringing the word of God to us but that
[28:20] word was not revealed by him
[28:23] that word has been revealed individually
[28:27] to each one of us
[28:29] and we have come to recognize that we do
[28:34] not now receive eternal life because we
[28:39] repent felt guilty confessed her our
[28:43] sins at the altar we do not now receive
[28:48] eternal life
[28:50] we have come to understand that
[28:53] Eternal means eternal it means without
[28:57] beginning and without ending and
[29:01] therefore we could not now receive
[29:05] eternal life it means that we always had
[29:09] eternal life but only now have come to
[29:13] recognize that we have that eternal life
[29:17] now our scripture here is simple one of
[29:21] the simplest sounding scriptures in the
[29:25] Bible amen when it says but the gift of
[29:29] God is eternal life well you see God is
[29:32] your eternal
[29:34] and from him having sons and having
[29:37] daughters
[29:38] and they're being a part of him
[29:41] they're being the stars of the morning
[29:44] they're being the one the stars that
[29:47] praised him glorified him and magnified
[29:49] him in the heavens
[29:51] where they sang and shouted and praised
[29:55] His holy name
[29:56] we find out that those Stars those ones
[30:01] were God's genes
[30:05] and the gift of God to us
[30:08] is that he gave you
[30:11] I and any who can recognize it he gave
[30:16] them from the very beginning they were a
[30:19] part of himself
[30:22] that Gene
[30:25] is a part of himself
[30:28] but we have only come to recognize it
[30:32] now in this age by the ministry of
[30:37] Malachi 4 5. we have heard the word of
[30:42] God Amen praise the Lord and I want you
[30:47] to know why did he give you uh this Gene
[30:51] why did he allow you to have this and to
[30:55] be here on the earth because you see he
[31:01] needed somebody something to identify
[31:06] the word for the day
[31:09] [Music]
[31:10] he wanted a deep that could call back to
[31:15] the Deep
[31:16] he wanted something that could respond
[31:19] to his word
[31:20] not with a fictional illusion in their
[31:25] minds not by human education or teaching
[31:29] not by any of these things in the world
[31:32] not by being smart but by
[31:36] Supernatural communication by the power
[31:39] of the holy spirit in the life of a True
[31:42] Believer amen where were Angels could uh
[31:47] come like Jacob going up and down coming
[31:52] up and down its Revelation messages from
[31:55] God revealing himself to his children
[31:58] Revelation going back and forth and
[32:01] Satan knows nothing about it he doesn't
[32:04] have a part of it and he can't get in
[32:07] there but we are brought in Praise the
[32:10] Lord hallelujah amen so the gene
[32:16] was genes were sent to Earth here
[32:22] in Parts portions so that in every age
[32:27] he would have a witness
[32:29] he would have
[32:31] someone he would have a people that have
[32:35] a gift in them that could identify him
[32:42] that could turn around and I identify
[32:45] him
[32:46] and we know when we say him back then it
[32:50] identified him the word in flesh
[32:54] praise God but now the word
[32:59] for form that he's in now we with that
[33:04] Gene in us are to be able to
[33:07] identified the revealed word of the hour
[33:12] now at one point no one to a Dogma it
[33:17] will not point you to a Creed at one
[33:20] point to do anything contrary to the
[33:22] word because it's only it's part of God
[33:26] Amen and being a part of God it will
[33:30] point you back to the world
[33:33] always to the word listen
[33:36] Christ in this day that we live in now
[33:41] is here
[33:43] identifying himself
[33:45] he said what is it it's deity
[33:49] amongst the people see it is the word
[33:54] living word amen and he is identifying
[33:58] himself because he is that word amen see
[34:04] we see the Living Word itself now
[34:08] because of that how do you see this word
[34:12] because of the gene of God being in you
[34:15] only the gene could recognize the word
[34:19] praise God so he says now clearly you
[34:23] see ah deity therefore is being
[34:28] identified in man
[34:31] Hallelujah then now it's the same thing
[34:35] today that's happening deity ID
[34:39] identifying itself in man praise God
[34:43] hallelujah you are identifying him he is
[34:46] identifying you in other words that's
[34:48] what's going on right now praise the
[34:50] name of the Lord and He is identifying
[34:52] himself like he did when he came in
[34:54] flesh trying to identify himself that he
[34:59] is the Messiah word he is the word made
[35:03] flesh to them and those elected
[35:05] predestinated seeds disciples that were
[35:09] upon the face of the Earth quickly they
[35:13] recognize that was the word for their
[35:16] day that was the word of God the full
[35:19] illness of the word of God see the
[35:23] promised word now the same thing that
[35:27] deity and this promised word for this
[35:30] day
[35:31] can can identify itself to you that is
[35:34] in you
[35:36] Hallelujah then when you see that you
[35:41] hold to it you believe it you give it
[35:45] deity in other words you recognize that
[35:48] that's a part of deity inside of you
[35:50] amen deity hallelujah oh my oh praise
[35:55] God you want to give his service and you
[36:00] want to be ready to dial to yourself on
[36:03] your own thoughts so that he can
[36:07] identify himself
[36:10] in you praise God hallelujah oh my now
[36:15] remember
[36:16] God guided
[36:18] the Meiji
[36:20] with their gifts
[36:22] for practically two years they followed
[36:26] that star amen
[36:30] oh praise God it was God guiding them
[36:34] see and it crossed at Bethany him but
[36:39] notice carefully God guided them because
[36:44] they had the right gift with gifts with
[36:48] them
[36:50] and that is why you and I when we were
[36:53] still like like the wise men were out in
[36:56] the desert they're going but they don't
[36:58] know where they're going but but because
[37:00] in this age with all the madness and the
[37:04] Mayhem and the murder and all that's
[37:07] going on around us and all the
[37:10] worldliness and all the immorality and
[37:14] everything else that's out there
[37:17] God guided you amen hallelujah not only
[37:22] he guided you but like the prophet when
[37:25] he went up that electric pool and could
[37:28] have died from the electric wires oh
[37:31] friend not only did he guide us but he
[37:35] protected us because of that gift that
[37:38] was in US yeah
[37:40] robbers could have robbed them moving
[37:43] with all those expensive gifts moving
[37:46] with all these things which was a normal
[37:48] thing to be robbed but somehow
[37:51] they were guided and they were protected
[37:56] because they were predestinated to
[38:01] arrive at their destination
[38:04] and their destination was to come to the
[38:08] place where the world was
[38:11] and to identify that word praise the
[38:14] lord lord of God hallelujah amen praise
[38:18] God see God guided those wise men
[38:22] because they had the right identified
[38:25] gifts in them and them gifts there could
[38:30] identify his son
[38:33] identify the word made flesh amen the
[38:38] gifts that they had praise God aren't

[44:49] children of the most high
[44:51] brother Branham says amateur Gods he
[44:54] says a small Messiah X amen praise God

[46:03] amen hallelujah because that's what God
[46:09] takes care of to identify himself by
[46:14] that
[46:15] amen that's why God is taking care of
[46:18] you
[46:19] doesn't matter what
[46:21] goes on in your life he is in the
[46:24] shadows watching over his own
[46:26] he says just like the Great Eagle
[46:29] sitting on the high mountain side under
[46:32] little uh chicks are in the valley floor
[46:35] you you would think that they're down
[46:38] there hopping and skipping and going
[46:40] around at a wolf or something else could
[46:43] come and grab one of them he says but no
[46:47] because with those eagle eyes she sees
[46:50] even a mouse moving in the grass any one
[46:53] of those things start coming nearby he
[46:56] said she'll swoop down praise God and
[46:59] and just get a hold of them and we are
[47:02] glad we have a God that can swoop down
[47:04] in our situation
[47:06] our eyes and take care of our problems
[47:10] and lead us and guide us for his name's
[47:12] sake amen hallelujah think of it
[47:17] that God hides and takes care of them
[47:22] gifts to identify himself by them

[47:33] think of it
[47:35] real identified gifts of God God brings
[47:40] that to the earth a thing like that and
[47:45] he brings it to identify himself by of
[47:48] course we take that compound that speaks
[47:51] of the Prophet that speaks of us and
[47:53] whoever may come after us God uses that
[47:57] and Portion out the the why you know it
[48:00] tells me here now that the Azure went
[48:03] forth to sow and some fell here some
[48:06] fell there some fell over there I don't
[48:08] know some fell in this age some fell in
[48:10] the other age whatever but they fell and
[48:13] they come up at their appropriate
[48:15] seasons and times to fulfill the word of
[48:19] God for that hour that they are living
[48:21] in praise the name of the Lord
[48:23] hallelujah and see
[48:26] the real identified
[48:30] gifts of God God brings that to Earth
[48:34] and it brings it to identify himself by
[48:38] it glory to God what an important job
[48:41] and Mission you have
[48:43] what an important task you have John the
[48:47] Baptist task was what point to the word
[48:49] and say Behold the Lamb of God that
[48:52] taken away the sins of the world amen
[48:55] hallelujah amen the prophet of God had
[48:59] his own and he has many of them there's

[49:09] oh praise God Amen Lord brother sister
[49:13] and God now that the prophet is of the
[49:17] scene our eyes is not on the prophet he
[49:20] was used of God but we are now in the
[49:23] age when the bride is making the world
[49:28] manifest
[49:31] Hallelujah not by her works not by her
[49:35] wisdom but by his grace
[49:38] unconscious godliness causes that great
[49:42] gift of God in us to flow out of us for
[49:46] the gift of God is eternal life
[49:50] kind of works Paul said not of works not
[49:54] of any things that man can do but God by
[49:57] his grace is manifesting himself through
[50:00] the individual amen yes sir Hallelujah
[50:04] notice Jesus was identified and he was
[50:08] identified by and in them gifts deity it
[50:13] was showing deity manifested for service

[50:22] scripture says that he might save his
[50:25] people from their sin notice in his name
[50:31] will the Gentiles trust Hallelujah
[50:36] notice he did not say save the world
[50:40] from their sins it said save his people
[50:45] God so loved the world that he gave his
[50:47] only begotten son that whosoever
[50:49] believeth in him should have everlasting
[50:51] life
[50:52] you see what you see how they deceived
[50:55] You See How They Carried Away you see
[50:57] their interpretation believing that the
[51:00] whole world is going to be saved as long
[51:03] as the whole world confesses and and
[51:06] feels guilty and so they promulgate that
[51:10] that that that emotion or feeling of
[51:12] guilt to their Prophet they promulgate
[51:16] all those feelings of confession and and
[51:19] stuff like that uh well of course you
[51:21] will come to that but that's when you
[51:24] see the word and the word sees you and
[51:26] you recognize your position and you
[51:29] recognize the great journey of life from
[51:31] birth to the hour that you are in that

[52:27] the Gentiles will trust in his name he
[52:33] says amen
[52:35] the Gentiles will trust in his name in
[52:40] other words that bride that's called out
[52:45] of the Gentiles will be trusting only in
[52:50] the name of Jesus

[53:35] time that we are living in praise the
[53:39] name of the Lord hallelujah don't you
[53:42] know he said
[53:44] that those in that age were identified
[53:47] as gods
[53:49] small duties

[53:54] it was God
[53:56] calling himself gods
[54:01] you you got what what you get that
[54:05] that Jesus was saying those prophets
[54:09] that came before me don't you know they
[54:12] were called gods and if they were called
[54:15] gods
[54:16] and I am the fullness of the word he
[54:18] didn't say that those words in there but
[54:20] I'm saying it now and I'm the fullness
[54:22] of the word oh what should you be
[54:25] calling me in other words I am almighty
[54:27] God Amen and they were small gods you
[54:31] see that was God himself

[54:39] amen oh my praise God what were them
[54:44] ones that were being called Gods what

[54:59] God and here was he the fullness of the
[55:04] word embodied deity
[55:08] manifested in flesh Hallelujah
[55:13] now
[55:15] let's watch what he's saying here and
[55:17] understand you see because most people
[55:20] will just pass over this listen what he
[55:22] says here
[55:23] these gifts that those men brought
[55:28] they could not have brought that to a
[55:31] prophet
[55:33] now we know he's not talking about John
[55:35] the Baptist
[55:37] he's not talking about John the Baptist
[55:39] John the Baptist was just a baby
[55:42] and they brought the gifts to the Christ
[55:46] but he is now leaving this inhale that
[55:50] beyond the stand that these gifts of God
[55:53] will recognize their word
[55:56] and they are not going to be
[56:00] magnetized or pulled just to a prophet
[56:03] or the prophet but they will recognize
[56:07] who they are for that gift where the
[56:10] gift let me sit here he says
[56:14] amen see
[56:16] these gifts these men brought they
[56:20] couldn't have brought that to a prophet
[56:24] it would not have been right
[56:27] to bring that bring the gifts in other
[56:30] words bring it to a prophet see that
[56:34] couldn't bring it
[56:35] to Elijah
[56:37] they couldn't bring it to Moses they had
[56:42] to come to him
[56:45] praise the Lord hallelujah praise God oh
[56:49] praise God and being those gifts were
[56:52] strictly meant for that day and was to
[56:56] identify who he was by these gifts then
[57:00] here come God along and protected him
[57:06] and kept them two years
[57:09] until they found the perfect light
[57:13] well we all know not some of us live
[57:16] most of our lifetime uh not knowing what
[57:20] we were searching for going to all kinds
[57:23] of churches maybe even in the message
[57:25] church and you still some hunger in your
[57:28] heart some thirst in there something
[57:31] crying out within you amen because only
[57:35] the word the revealed word could satisfy
[57:38] your your thirst your hunger that is in
[57:42] you only the true genuine bread of life
[57:45] oh praise God forevermore hallelujah
[57:48] amen and do you know
[57:51] it's the same thing today do you believe
[57:55] that
[57:58] we got people just as loyal just nice
[58:03] people genuine people amen and God has
[58:07] always done that to be able to identify
[58:11] the day amen oh my but that means there
[58:16] won't be many
[58:17] just
[58:19] normally he says just a few but he's
[58:23] here he says just a very very few that
[58:29] will be saved the Bible said so that
[58:35] there will just be a handful
[58:39] one handful
[58:42] and Jesus puts it this way as it was
[58:46] in the days of Noah
[58:49] we're in eight Souls were safe listen he
[58:53] says here now he is speaking of eight
[58:57] Souls from an entire generation
[59:01] think of it now back then it might have
[59:04] been millions of people in the world but
[59:06] now it's billions
[59:07] right but nevertheless it will be few
[59:12] there'll be a handful praise the name of
[59:15] the Lord listen as it was in the days of
[59:18] Noah great cultured people great workers
[59:20] great Builders great everything
[59:23] um as made by them civilization see so
[59:28] will it be in the coming of the son of
[59:32] man
[59:33] great civilization great things see amen
[59:37] hallelujah but God had a Noah I'm glad
[59:42] God has no hers of the word to identify
[59:47] the word of this day for the glory of
[59:51] God amen hallelujah amen now these wise
[59:56] men bringing their gifts identified
[1:00:00] identified what it was that's the reason
[1:00:03] why God protected them gifts through
[1:00:07] every move they made
[1:00:09] Hallelujah from birth till you leave
[1:00:12] this place you're under the protective
[1:00:14] care and hand of the almighty God Amen
[1:00:17] because he wants to use us he wants to
[1:00:21] use us as his tools for his glory and
[1:00:24] for his honor Hallelujah you see and he
[1:00:28] will not stop to protect them because
[1:00:31] he'll protect them gifts through every
[1:00:34] move they made he'll protect them until
[1:00:39] they arrive with them gifts he'll
[1:00:44] protect you till you go right back into
[1:00:47] glory amen you identify the word here
[1:00:51] and you go right back in the glory and
[1:00:53] he's saying here he's going to protect
[1:00:55] them until they arrive because
[1:00:58] that was fitting for that time amen what
[1:01:03] praise God you understand what he's
[1:01:05] saying when a gene when a seed when one
[1:01:09] of these possessing eternal life comes
[1:01:13] upon the Earth
[1:01:14] they are fitted suited molded and shaped
[1:01:19] for that moment that age that they are
[1:01:22] living in to identify and fulfill the
[1:01:25] word of God for that day and for the
[1:01:28] glory of God Amen praise the name of the
[1:01:31] Lord now if I go on we'll have to spend
[1:01:33] another half an hour but I'm going to
[1:01:36] stop here right now and let God receive
[1:01:39] the glory and let you think on these
[1:01:42] things let the Holy Spirit go through
[1:01:45] your spirit and identify the word and
[1:01:50] revive us encourage us as we move along
[1:01:54] with God's Mighty and unchanging hand
[1:01:57] the gift of God is eternal life
[1:02:01] through Jesus Christ you understand it
[1:02:05] doesn't mean anybody running to an altar
[1:02:07] doesn't mean 20 000 people running to an
[1:02:10] altar but among those twenty thousand
[1:02:13] people there may be one
[1:02:14] there may be five I don't know but
[1:02:18] that's what the uh was being taught to
[1:02:21] us that's the reason why oral and Billy
[1:02:25] could give such an altar call you know
[1:02:28] and and when they go back there isn't
[1:02:30] anybody
[1:02:31] or or just a few he says but look when
[1:02:35] Paul preached that revealed word of God
[1:02:38] and just a few were called out Paul went
[1:02:42] there and maybe he left 20 30 or 40 and
[1:02:46] when he went back then 20 30 or 40 were
[1:02:50] still standing on the word and some the
[1:02:53] Bible tells them that they're multiplied
[1:02:55] also praise God why because one was the
[1:03:00] gift of God identifying the word for the
[1:03:03] owl it could do nothing else because
[1:03:05] that's what it was sent down here for
[1:03:08] that is the reason and purpose that they
[1:03:10] are here lives
[1:03:13] that are prepared and ready for service
[1:03:18] we are here to serve God
[1:03:20] and to fulfill not our will but his will
[1:03:24] his plans his purposes to him be all the
[1:03:28] glory honor and praise shall we stand to
[1:03:31] our feet
[1:03:34] our gracious Heavenly Father
[1:03:37] how thankful we are
[1:03:40] for this gift that you have given to
[1:03:43] every one of us
[1:03:45] we know
[1:03:47] that Lord as they your servant has said
[1:03:51] it's not all the world it's not to all
[1:03:55] the world but he was sent to the lost
[1:03:59] sheep of the House of Israel to his or
[1:04:02] to his people and how the Gentiles in
[1:04:06] his name they will trust praise God we
[1:04:10] recognize father that there oh God is
[1:04:14] going on even right now where Lord
[1:04:17] you're coming back for your people and
[1:04:20] we are trusting in you that the word in
[1:04:23] US will identify the word
[1:04:27] and at the Deep
[1:04:29] [Music]
[1:04:30] will call
[1:04:31] back to the Deep
[1:04:34] Like the Wolf in the wilderness which
[1:04:36] was what brother Branham was trying to
[1:04:38] speak of or to uh to use as an
[1:04:43] illustration he says I'm up on the
[1:04:46] mountain and I hear a wolf howl down in
[1:04:51] the valley and further up the other way
[1:04:54] I heard an answering Cry of another wolf
[1:04:58] out there the male crawling to the
[1:05:01] female oh praise God what he was trying
[1:05:04] to show us Lord God I recognize as the
[1:05:08] Deep cross to the Deep the bride calling
[1:05:11] to the bridegroom the bridegroom calling
[1:05:14] back to the bride oh thank you Lord for
[1:05:17] this great hour of spiritual Revelation
