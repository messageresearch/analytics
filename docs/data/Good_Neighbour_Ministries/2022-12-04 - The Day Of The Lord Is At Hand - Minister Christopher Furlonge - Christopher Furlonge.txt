the coming of the Lord will not just be any certain location not any certain area you'll go up in sunset Mountain Diego be going to be appearing up there I know we all got to gather up there you know one time there were people doing that I believe in 1971 there's so loud everything and I went up sunset Mountain and waiting for the coming of the Lord so many deceptions for us but when you do things without a revolution and without a clear understanding from God we call that sin man so we need to have faith Revelation a clear understanding of God's word to each and every one of our hearts and it's an individual thing what is God is showing your brother I'm not showing you ways what is showing your sister is not showing you for to every man is allotted a portion of Revelation [Music] what is what you need God is going to give it to you amen amen amen hallelujah amen praise be to his wonderful name Hallelujah amen Hallelujah thank you Lord the Rapture or this secret catching away is going to be Universal just as our Prophet taught us one place one time the Earth in darkness right now in darkness maybe in the Australia or somewhere the other part of the world it may be Darkness right now right amen and a prophet reminder I say somewhere between I believe seven or nine this Rapture is going to be foreign it's going to be some time maybe it's for North America maybe for whatever amen hallelujah so we can't really just put time and date and anything like that and location amen it could be a secret sudden cutting away remember that so it never tell you to to focus your attention on time or location you say get ready be ready at every moment Hallelujah amen thank you Lord praise be to God thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah now we see in the Book of Revelation John was transmitted from the Isle of patmas into the spirit over in the Lord's Day amen so what is the Lord's Day is it at 24 hours a day you see from my understanding amen and I hope and I pray that you may be able to catch this I believe the Lord's Day is that Eternal day because when John went into that day he could have seen the past because in the present and he could have seen the future so it was like a big panoramic view he was watching at man so he could have seen these things and he started to write man he could have seen that what was being going to be taking place right now right now right now and the Lord tell him he said John some things you're gonna have to write them to warn them right and some things you gotta seal it up shut it up don't write it it's only in that appropriate time and season when I want them to know I will let them know you know what it is but don't let them know amen hallelujah so I believe that is that day the day of the Lord amen because man due to sin slipped into time it was one Eternal day then but man break that train and we're going back to that eternally amen hallelujah man so that is my understanding how God has shown it to me I hope it it breaks to you the same way Hallelujah thank you Lord so it's not a personal revelation that I receive in and it just things that are there that God would be mindful to show his people man he's the one to interpret it he's the one for you to see it man I could be speaking uh saying a lot of things here amen this morning but he's the one to Break It individual to each heart amen hallelujah and that's what Revelation is a clear understanding of the word of God to the individual amen hallelujah it's shut up from some it's only for those who have eyes to see when I see it and he gives you the eyes that inside Ayah he's the one who will reveal it to you that's how I see it amen that's how it is praise be to his wonderful name Hallelujah thank you Lord thank you Lord this is the day of men men are fighting but the day of the Lord will come when these kingdoms will become the kingdom of the Lord and our Savior Jesus Christ because when the Lord was up on Long Temptation man when Satan presented all the kingdoms of the whole team the Lord knows one day he will be his anyhow will give it to you because he knew then true sin that Satan got hold of them amen but you know one day he's going to become is going to come back to him amen because it was forfeited amen man gave it over to the Satan amen but the Lord knew one day that the kingdoms of this world is going to be him praise amen hallelujah thank you Lord praise be to his name amen then there will be a great millennium the Lord's Day the coming of the Lord his judgment that's be that will be the Lord's day let me read it
