[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] dear friends good Sunday morning I'm
[0:17] happy to be here I'm here to speak on
[0:22] the subject of the Living Dead I'm
[0:25] Pastor John Simon let us pray
[0:28] gracious Heavenly Father we pray your
[0:31] blessing upon this wonderful time in
[0:35] your presence bless the hearers and the
[0:38] speaker and take all the glory honor and
[0:41] praise in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[0:45] and amen let us read our scripture of
[0:51] first Timothy 5 verse 6 which reads thus
[0:59] but she that liveth in pleasure is dead
[1:04] while she liveth may I repeat first
[1:08] Timothy 5:16 but she that liveth in
[1:14] pleasure is dead while she liveth the
[1:22] scripture of course is speaking about
[1:25] wanton widows who enjoy the pleasures of
[1:31] sin by loose living it is saying but she
[1:42] that lives in sin or for sin or for the
[1:48] pleasure or the enjoyment of sin is
[1:52] already spiritually dead why she is yet
[1:58] alive in other words she is a literal
[2:03] Walking Dead the scriptural extension
[2:08] and the compound application of this
[2:12] scripture would not only say she but she
[2:21] he or they
[2:24] that live in sin or lives for the
[2:28] pleasures and the enjoyment for sin
[2:32] those that live with an appetite and
[2:37] constant desire for sin one is one of
[2:43] the Living Dead
[2:46] certainly my friends I want you like
[2:53] Lazarus to come out from amongst the
[2:56] dead don't live that way don't associate
[3:01] yourself with the Living Dead but the
[3:06] call this morning is for you to come out
[3:10] from a mouse the dead now we know that
[3:15] November 1st is usually celebrated as
[3:20] the day of the dead All Saints Day and
[3:26] also called All Souls Day then we see
[3:33] this time also ties in with Halloween
[3:42] which is generally October 31st and it's
[3:49] the observance of this Day of the Dead
[3:55] night of the Dead
[3:58] Halloween is usually observed by the
[4:01] burning of candles by prayers for the
[4:08] dead and by visits to of all places to
[4:14] the cemetery now both of these
[4:18] traditional observances of Halloween and
[4:23] of All Saints Day are literally of pagan
[4:29] origins that have successfully inserted
[4:34] themselves into
[4:38] Christianity one speaks of the day of
[4:42] the dead and the other speaks of the
[4:47] night of the dead considered to be the
[4:53] one and only night where it's believed
[4:57] that on that one night
[5:00] the dead are allowed to come out of
[5:04] their graves and to cross back over into
[5:09] the land of the living and to walk among
[5:13] the people of the earth now you say well
[5:18] brother Simon what has that got to do
[5:21] with me friends as a fact a literal fact
[5:28] no such a thing really exists as the
[5:32] dead coming out of the graves and coming
[5:36] back to walk and to live among us and
[5:40] move around for that one night upon the
[5:44] face of the earth well friends it's
[5:48] midnight it's midnight in America it's
[5:53] midnight in Canada and it's midnight all
[5:56] over the world spiritually it's midnight
[6:01] everywhere and gross darkness covers the
[6:05] land and covers the heart of the people
[6:09] certainly suffocating spiritual darkness
[6:14] as in Egypt is now upon us and it is
[6:19] spread everywhere now this is not a
[6:23] surprise to Christians to believers it
[6:27] is not a surprise because this was
[6:30] already prophesied by God's prophet of
[6:34] the 20th century William variant brain
[6:38] hand now these moves as you see
[6:42] represented behind me are simply uh
[6:47] something that
[6:49] at a time when he prophesied many many
[6:53] years before that something like this
[6:56] was going to happen and drew upon a wall
[7:00] this marvelous description of the seven
[7:05] churches moving from late in the days of
[7:09] fall right to our day of the Libyan
[7:13] church age a day of darkness and
[7:16] deception and death and this is the time
[7:21] we are living in it's midnight friends
[7:24] it's the midnight hour all over the
[7:27] world and he said also there will be a
[7:31] total blackout for God reflected this to
[7:37] us in the moon sea and these seventh
[7:43] changes of the moon with the last one
[7:46] going into total darkness speaks of our
[7:51] day when truth will be pushed out and
[7:57] spiritual darkness gross darkness
[8:01] darkness can be felt and sense will
[8:05] cover the land cover the earth and rest
[8:08] upon the people what time is it sirs
[8:11] it's midnight
[8:13] owl x clock is striking the hour
[8:17] Jesus will soon descend and yet people
[8:21] are living and walking in sin caring not
[8:27] that our Lord was crucified for them and
[8:30] died for their sins and is waiting with
[8:34] love as a great Shepherd for his
[8:36] children to come back home to him
[8:39] wherever you are let me sum the call let
[8:43] me sound the cry return while there is
[8:46] yet time to return come to him while
[8:50] there is yet time to come submit your
[8:53] life to him and he will change you by
[8:56] His divine power and make you into who
[9:01] he
[9:01] wants you to be there was the ending of
[9:04] this seventh church age of Letitia this
[9:09] age of spiritual darkness of sin sin has
[9:15] blinded the minds of men everywhere
[9:20] every nation of retirement of every
[9:23] language it's universal
[9:26] this virus this poison of sin has
[9:31] covered the hearts of men and women
[9:34] everywhere certainly we see a trans
[9:39] government's covered in darkness courts
[9:43] places of worship schools universities I
[9:48] tell you homes
[9:51] entire families taken over by the
[9:55] darkness flowing and swirling around
[10:00] everywhere like a dark and foggy night
[10:03] where none can see their way or see any
[10:07] light or truth anywhere suddenly the
[10:11] spiritual zombies are out the ghouls are
[10:16] out the ghosts are out the demons
[10:20] impersonating the souls of the so-called
[10:23] dead and Damned are now stalking the
[10:27] land we know according to the Gospel of
[10:32] Luke chapter 16 verse 19 to 31 a matter
[10:38] of fact let me read a few verses because
[10:42] Jesus tells a marvelous story of how
[10:46] there was a rich man and a beggar and
[10:49] let me continue and it came to pass that
[10:54] the beggar died and was carried by the
[10:57] Angels into Abraham's bosom the rich man
[11:02] also died and was buried and in hell he
[11:09] lifted up his eyes being in torment and
[11:13] say
[11:14] Abraham afar off and see it
[11:18] Lazarus the beggar in his bosom and he
[11:22] cried and said father Abraham have mercy
[11:24] on me have mercy on me send Lazarus that
[11:28] he may dip the tip of his finger in
[11:31] water and cool my tongue for I am
[11:35] tormented in this flame but Abraham said
[11:39] son remember thou in thy lifetime
[11:42] receiveth like good things and likewise
[11:46] Lazarus evil things and now he is
[11:50] comforted and thou art tormented and
[11:54] beside all this between us and you there
[12:00] is a great gulf fixed so that they which
[12:07] would pass from hence to you cannot
[12:12] neither can they pass to us that would
[12:18] come from this Oh friends I'll stop the
[12:23] reading right there that is enough
[12:26] so we understand it from the Word of God
[12:29] from the Lord Jesus himself telling
[12:32] about this saying clearly let no one
[12:39] none can return back to the land of the
[12:45] living after that they're dead so let no
[12:50] one deceive you
[12:51] let no one mislead you
[12:54] let no one listen for you distract you
[12:58] from the truth of the word of God
[13:02] therefore from this we know that these
[13:07] are evil demonic spirits that are
[13:16] impersonating the souls of the dead
[13:19] intent these are of the invisible armies
[13:24] of darkness unseen
[13:28] Devils that I here to kill to steal your
[13:34] joy your life your future and to destroy
[13:38] your entire existence in every possible
[13:42] way
[13:43] now these soul eaters and Body Snatchers
[13:47] earth and spiritual zombies are out
[13:52] because the darkness of the spiritual
[13:56] atmosphere invites them to activity here
[14:00] friends it's midnight it's midnight all
[14:04] over the world now you say well pastor
[14:08] Simon what what is a zombie now
[14:12] according to Google if you will look it
[14:15] up yourself you'll find it there a
[14:17] zombie is a walking corpse and the
[14:24] people who are living in sin are already
[14:28] spiritually dead or Daryl are you dying
[14:33] and rotten from the insulate out dead
[14:41] spiritually dead but physically they are
[14:46] convinced that they are living nothing
[14:50] but a wonderful life and that their life
[14:53] is good and everything is alright
[14:56] meanwhile they're rotten and the stench
[15:01] rises up in the nostrils of God ah their
[15:05] very nature on the inside compels them
[15:10] to send and sin and sin again but Jesus
[15:15] said speaking about the religious
[15:18] leaders of his day he said in Matthew 23
[15:23] vs. 27 but you are like weddings if
[15:28] graves that appear beautiful on the
[15:32] outside but are full of uncleanness and
[15:38] dead men's bones on the inside
[15:42] you see the Pharisees the Sadducees the
[15:47] religious leaders of that day and at
[15:52] that time that were opposed to the word
[15:56] of the hour the Word made flesh was
[15:59] being opposed by religious leaders of
[16:02] that day and he said in appearance they
[16:07] were literally almost perfect and
[16:11] attractive by their dress their wear
[16:15] their walk their talk but really on the
[16:19] inside there was a stitch that not all
[16:23] the perfumes of Arabia could destroy
[16:26] there's that the rottenness to the core
[16:30] was from the inside coming to the
[16:34] outside yes and so is any religious
[16:38] person or any persons whatsoever that
[16:42] lives the way they did rejecting the
[16:47] Word of God for your day and for your
[16:50] hour you will also have that a good man
[16:52] a good woman a wonderful a church-going
[16:57] person perfection on the outside but on
[17:01] the inside rotten to the core
[17:04] ken was a zombie for he was a child of
[17:12] the evil one
[17:14] half man and half beast with no seat
[17:20] gene of God no soul of God in him in
[17:25] fact he had a soul that sins and the
[17:29] Bible tells us when you have a soul that
[17:32] sin the soul that sinneth it shall
[17:35] surely die according to ezekiel 18:4
[17:41] and also verse 20 but thank God first
[17:46] John chapter 3 verse 9 says but the seed
[17:52] of God cannot see
[17:56] so that sins shall die not eternal but
[18:00] they are the gene of God that's in the
[18:03] other person is eternal it cannot sin
[18:08] and it cannot die no wonder jesus said
[18:11] he that liveth and believeth on me don't
[18:14] he were dead yet shall he also live for
[18:19] the scene of God first John says abideth
[18:23] in him all thanks be to God hallelujah
[18:28] all yes here we see the seeds of death
[18:31] and the seeds of life and the seed which
[18:36] shall not be heir with the shop now the
[18:41] people of North days for as it was in
[18:44] the days of Noah so shall it be in the
[18:47] days of the coming of the Son of Man
[18:50] when the son of man would be revealed
[18:53] again now the people at Mars day were of
[18:59] the kind of similar to Cain for their
[19:04] work mainly of his generation with that
[19:07] beast nature that would listen to the
[19:11] preaching of a god-sent prophet Noah who
[19:15] was a knower of the world and rejected
[19:20] his message for their day proving that
[19:24] they were Antichrist empty word and
[19:27] against their principles and teachings
[19:30] and warnings of the Word of God may God
[19:35] help us friends that we do not have a
[19:37] spirit like that but that we will
[19:39] cooperate we will submit and surrender
[19:42] and obey that precepts principles and
[19:46] teachings and warnings that comes from
[19:49] the Word of God so we see friends that
[19:53] all that were in the day of Noah that
[19:56] did not heed the Word of God their
[19:59] perish and all outside of the ark
[20:02] perished all outside of Christ will
[20:06] perish
[20:07] here we are all those without and gene a
[20:12] seed a life of God that was placed
[20:17] within them they all praised God will
[20:21] perish friends certainly we see also
[20:24] feral was nothing but a walking dead
[20:29] kora datum they were in that army of the
[20:34] Walking Dead the Pharisees and Sadducees
[20:37] in the days of Jesus they were in the
[20:41] army of the walking dead then we see
[20:45] Judas who inserted himself into
[20:48] Christianity and was right beside the
[20:51] Lord Jesus right there with his love of
[20:55] money and they witnessed desire that he
[20:59] had been in his heart oh my friends
[21:03] there he was but the Bible tells us
[21:06] clearly that he was a son of the devil
[21:10] he was of that wicked one he was evil to
[21:16] his very core but outwardly he was very
[21:21] religious these spirits these evil
[21:26] demons they were also active in the days
[21:31] of Paul and Paul spoke of them and call
[21:36] them ravening wolves Jude described them
[21:42] as spots within over feasts these
[21:47] demonic powers make no mistake about it
[21:51] these demonic powers don't maybe appears
[21:56] like Angels of Light religious are in
[22:00] our midst again and we must be aware of
[22:03] it friends they are here today John the
[22:07] revelation gives a description in
[22:10] Revelation 9 of some of these
[22:14] frightening devils and spirits that are
[22:18] to be loosed upon the face
[22:21] something earth I tell you my friends
[22:24] it's a dark day we're living in and a
[22:27] frightening time but for the Christian
[22:30] it's a glorious and wonderful time
[22:33] because on one hand when there was
[22:36] darkness for the devil his demons and
[22:40] the dis followers there is light for the
[22:44] Christian and a believer for they can
[22:46] look up for the coming of the Lord
[22:49] joint 9 the coming of the Lord is here
[22:51] thanks be to God
[22:53] how happy we should be we also see the
[22:57] scriptures one beautiful song that says
[23:00] turns clock is striking the hour jesus
[23:05] will soon descend clad in the garments
[23:09] of power the reign of sin to end it is
[23:13] the rising of the Sun and when the Sun
[23:17] comes up it rains the darkness away the
[23:20] fog away all of the doubts your fears
[23:24] your your presumptions are driven away
[23:27] by the rising of the Sun oh praise be
[23:31] toward God we are so confident in him
[23:36] and happy in the Lord because we know we
[23:40] are more than conquerors through him
[23:42] that loved us and Satan's legions of the
[23:47] already damned and his armies of
[23:49] darkness made up of demons and humans
[23:54] are already defeated in the name of
[23:59] Jesus Christ by the blood of Jesus
[24:02] Christ and by the testimony of Jesus
[24:05] Christ
[24:05] yes it's midnight in America it's
[24:09] midnight in Canada it's midnight
[24:12] all over the world and spiritual
[24:15] darkness is everywhere whoa men
[24:19] right in the world for the world lines
[24:21] in a bed of worthiness and drunkenness
[24:27] it's midnight in God's church and I'm
[24:30] here blowing a trumpet in Zion the one
[24:34] God's people heaven or hell Christ or
[24:37] chaos
[24:38] judgment is at hand and heaven is near
[24:41] Oh make up your mind to live for the
[24:44] Lord and for him alone this is the hour
[24:48] when we must choose Hussein we are on
[24:52] yes the church living in worldliness
[24:59] comfortable like a frog in a kettle with
[25:04] the spirit of lukewarmness resting upon
[25:08] her while drinking from our cups a
[25:13] spiritual fornication do you who are
[25:17] watching is it nighttime in your life
[25:23] are you Mary existing are you walking in
[25:28] the dark
[25:31] are you a message believer and you just
[25:37] blindly following the message without
[25:39] the clear revelation of dust saith the
[25:43] Lord you do not have a clear revelation
[25:47] or a clear understanding of what God has
[25:52] done by sending a prophet and what he is
[25:57] doing now through the message of the
[26:01] Prophet which is for running the second
[26:04] coming of Jesus Christ
[26:06] o my brother my sister I ask you look up
[26:11] lift up your head and cry out to God and
[26:15] ask God for wisdom who gives liberally
[26:19] to anyone that will ask it God will give
[26:23] you revelation not from from book of
[26:27] theology not from a universe
[26:29] not by higher learning not by becoming
[26:33] some so-called trained counselor or
[26:36] becoming some great theologian that's
[26:38] just nonsense in the eyes of God for
[26:41] that's knowledge accrued by the five
[26:44] senses of man which is totally limited
[26:47] but I'm talking about youth talking to
[26:50] God and asking him lord help me to tap
[26:53] into your wisdom your knowledge your
[26:56] understanding and don't let me interpret
[26:59] your word but God come fill me and you
[27:02] be the interpreter of your own word I
[27:05] ask it in the name of Jesus Christ and
[27:08] surely God will hear you God will help
[27:11] you God will lift you up and like you
[27:14] dip the Bartimaeus the scales will fall
[27:17] from your eyes like he did to Paul the
[27:20] scales will fall from your eyes and you
[27:22] will be able to say oh I wish I could
[27:25] make all men see the what is this
[27:29] fellowship of this mystery
[27:31] Oh for Jesus will reveal himself to you
[27:35] personally by the opening of the Word of
[27:38] God for the hour yes friends wake up
[27:45] wake up out of your sleep get up as Paul
[27:50] said and rise and come to the light it's
[27:57] frightening ly dark very dark and it's
[28:03] at nighttime when demon powers become
[28:07] active whipped or without the light of
[28:12] the Moon witches wizards demon powers
[28:18] are always active when things become
[28:22] dark but hope thanks be to God we are
[28:25] not children of the darkness we are the
[28:27] children of light we walk in truth we
[28:30] walk in light but we must know the fact
[28:34] that when darkness the same spiritually
[28:37] or naturally it's when the evil demon
[28:41] power
[28:42] began to become active if at night said
[28:46] the Prophet when rats roaches snakes and
[28:51] all other creatures of the night that's
[28:55] the time when they begin to come out I
[28:59] want to notice friends it's usually at
[29:03] midnight or after midnight when all the
[29:08] crazies come out all the moonstruck come
[29:13] out when all the parties really begin to
[29:19] rock and the music begins to move and
[29:26] sound and the screams and cries of
[29:33] stupefying japanesse adulteries
[29:38] fornications perversions of all kind of
[29:44] which paul says they which do these
[29:48] things will not enter into the kingdom
[29:52] of God they will not do it one time the
[29:59] Prophet being in a hotel going to his
[30:04] room after meeting and down the hallway
[30:08] of the hotel runs a half-naked woman
[30:11] with her with a camera or glass of
[30:15] liquor in her hand half drunk and saying
[30:20] hey this is life and he couldn't help
[30:24] himself he turns there's no woman that
[30:27] is that life that is death and I say to
[30:31] you Tintin today that is death if you
[30:36] live that way that is death
[30:39] oh my friends it's this kind of a
[30:43] darkness that shows up at least office
[30:48] parties be honest with yourself man be
[30:53] honest
[30:55] think about it that's when the darkness
[30:58] sometimes shows up office parties
[31:02] Christmas parties champagne gatherings
[31:08] but remember in the midst of all that
[31:12] they live in sin or death will they
[31:18] appear to be a life successful rich or
[31:24] even appear to be physically healthy for
[31:28] she that liveth into the places of sin
[31:32] is dead once you live it my friends true
[31:36] Christian believers know that we are in
[31:40] a midst of a ferocious war we are here
[31:46] fighting against unseen powers of
[31:49] darkness operating in high places we
[31:54] wrestle not against flesh and blood but
[31:56] our fighters with spiritual wickedness
[32:00] everywhere my question to you is which
[32:04] side are you on
[32:06] are you with the horse of heaven are new
[32:10] with the Lord's army are you with God's
[32:14] salvation army are you with the armies
[32:18] of light let by Michael the Archangel
[32:22] under the power of the Holy Spirit or
[32:26] are you with Satan and his viral
[32:30] parasitic evil army of Darkness Oh God
[32:37] lives in his army that is why it cannot
[32:41] be defeated for he is the mighty
[32:43] Conqueror who has ripped the veil into
[32:47] God empowers his army by his presence of
[32:51] living in them and they walk as children
[32:54] of the light but Satan also lives in his
[33:00] Ernie
[33:00] he possesses them and he walks and lives
[33:06] anoints and
[33:07] inspires the Living Dead who are alive
[33:13] physically but dead spiritually oh my
[33:17] friends get away from that I want you to
[33:20] know my friends right now that when you
[33:24] live like that you qualify as a member
[33:29] of that army as a soldier in that evil
[33:33] Legion of darkness that you are a member
[33:37] of however your situation is not
[33:41] hopeless for Jesus proves that he has
[33:47] the power over life in this he
[33:52] challenged Satan by saying even if you
[33:55] destroy this body in three days I'll
[33:58] raise it up again he also proved it at
[34:02] the grave of Lazarus Lazarus who was
[34:06] dead and Jesus came it appears as if he
[34:12] was late but he Jesus Christ the God is
[34:16] never late even though it seems like
[34:18] he's delaying and he maybe hasn't
[34:20] answered your prayer just yet just wait
[34:23] upon the Lord because Jesus keeps all of
[34:27] his appointments and so he came on the
[34:31] scene and one of the sister said Lord if
[34:36] you had been here my brother would not
[34:38] have died and you know Jesus felt sad
[34:44] the scripture says he wept he says you
[34:48] know he live again they said yes Lord we
[34:52] know in the resurrection in a nice way
[34:56] he was correcting and he said but you
[34:58] don't understand
[34:59] the resurrection is not a time it's not
[35:03] some event only that's maybe coming up
[35:05] the road I am the resurrection I am the
[35:10] personification of the resurrection I am
[35:13] the life that's all in me and he says
[35:18] take me to where they
[35:20] laid him they took him to the tomb of
[35:24] Lazarus I can see the crowds with the
[35:27] Pharisees his detractors his critics all
[35:31] crowding about dances now he's gone too
[35:34] far now we really got him and he stands
[35:38] there this man's dead for four days and
[35:41] he's asking that to roll back the storm
[35:45] all my friends I tell you if the stone
[35:49] of doubt and fear and darkness and
[35:52] happens can roll away from you today
[35:54] I'll tell you you'll walk out of your
[35:57] path you'll walk out of that all night
[35:59] and you'll walk into a new one in the
[36:01] name of Jesus Christ and the Bible
[36:05] further tells us the Rope they get
[36:09] rolled back the stone but not wittingly
[36:11] they said Lord why should be ruling that
[36:13] he's thicket and of course your life
[36:16] will stink if you're living in sin your
[36:19] life will have a rotten seated order to
[36:23] it if you are living and existing and
[36:26] walking in the darkness of sin but
[36:29] thanks be to God he is the mighty
[36:31] Conqueror he is Lord and so he said
[36:35] throw back the stone and then the Bible
[36:39] says he lifted up his voice and he says
[36:42] Lazarus come forth and the Bible tells
[36:47] us Lazarus came for wrapped in his grave
[36:51] clothes and Jesus said lose him and let
[36:54] him go no matter what happens no matter
[36:57] what conditions or situations may hold
[37:00] you bound Jesus Christ is saying to you
[37:03] today lose him Satan let him go
[37:07] Satan let her go let them go if thou
[37:11] canst believe all things are possible to
[37:14] them that will believe the Word of God
[37:17] far away where the soul of Lazarus might
[37:21] have been traveling he who the cart of
[37:24] the time heard the voice of the Lord
[37:27] over life and death calling him
[37:30] Lazarus come forth that same voice is
[37:34] coming to you come out of your darkness
[37:36] come out of your dirt come out of your
[37:39] filth
[37:40] come out of your sin come out of your
[37:42] mistaken this place raka ideas and
[37:47] thoughts and presumptions and come to
[37:49] the city of the revelation of the Word
[37:52] of God that is speaking to you right now
[37:55] for that same Jesus Christ who has the
[37:59] power that could call for Lazarus from
[38:04] the grave it's calling to you now won't

[38:11] to come out from amongst the dead dead

[38:28] Christ there's a wonderful and beautiful
[38:32] song that you may know that says you
