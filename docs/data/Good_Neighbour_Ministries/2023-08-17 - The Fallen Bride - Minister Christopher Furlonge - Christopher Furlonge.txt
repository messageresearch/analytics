work in you and he's not going to leave you halfway is going to be with you right until the end God we should bless you all the making sacrifice to be here in his house tonight amen you know where your strength lies you know where the food is at for this hour this special food amen that can transform us that can take us out from this realm is a supernatural food amen Hallelujah blessed be his wonderful name tonight can I just Bible study amen hallelujah and I have by God's grace give me a little thought here tonight amen and I'd like to share it with you all and that will be a blessing Amen to your hearts that something may be said you know something that will be inspired in your heart to keep pressing on so don't give up man Hallelujah this is the time this is the season amen what we have been expecting all these years it's now at hand right upon us it's right upon us on one of these days is going to be a reality to you man that's our hope that's our joy not really that's where our Assurance lies there's a there's a difference between hoping and an assurance you know when you're another Assurance you're sure about it can't explain it to anybody but you're sure that you know that you know that you know amen that this God that we are sowing he is real man hallelujah praise God we like to turn to our scripture tonight and it's just a few scriptures from Genesis chapter 2 and if you can bring the second slide up tonight my thought tonight here is a fallen bride man I fall and bright So reading from verse seven to nine Hallelujah praise God it's up on the screen yes so you can follow with us tonight amen praise God and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathe it into him into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living soul and the Lord God planted a garden eastwards in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed verse 9 and out of the ground may the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil amen could you bring up slide three and another scripture reading is taken from Genesis 2 16 just a little bit after that amen Hallelujah just a little bit further down and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every three of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the three of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for the day that thou eat us thereof Thou shalt surely die amen and Genesis 3 24 Hallelujah so we see amen God commanded them not to partake of that particular three amen hallelujah and it's all types and child and you we've been well thought and man I don't have to explain all this to you but amen hallelujah you've been taught so many times did you refer to the scriptures so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned everywhere to keep the way of the three of Life man let's pray gracious God and our heavenly father thank you Lord for this Grand time and privilege Lord that we are having that we can be in your presence Lord the night Lord making our way for us to be here Lord I pray Lord that you bless the reading of the words Lord your word Lord father to hear us Lord that we may find good grown and bring forth fruits worthy of your kingdom Lord Lord Jesus become it all into your hands tonight Lord the saints that we're listening in on air Lord and those that are present here we thank you for them Lord Jesus Lord we just ask you take full control forgive us for all of our mistakes and shortcomings as we commit ourselves to you for service in Jesus name we pray amen amen you may take your seats tonight foreign it's got to be in his house tonight amen are you happy to be here tonight man there's no better place to be than to be in this house man Hallelujah so God being God in his mind wanted a family to fellowship with him see God is a family man he wanted to have a family amen hallelujah so in his mind right he had this great plan of having a family and God is a family planning man Hallelujah see it wasn't God to begin with amen because we know God is just an object of worship and in order for him to be God he had to have something or someone to worship Him so what he did he created angels amen and he had them worshiping him amen hallelujah and out of those angels He had one special angel that he had we know him as Lucifer Hallelujah and he created man and he created angels and when he created man he placed them on free Memorial Agency for his own holiness and when he did that man fell Hallelujah now I just want to take you a little way back before the foundations of the world you see in heaven the devil as we all know him as Lucifer was God's right-hand man and he was given power even being co-equal with God but Lucifer forgot that he was just a creation amen and when he saw that all his angels giving honor and glory and worshiping and praising God amen he said wait a minute Pride lifted up in his heart I said listen I can't get that same worship too amen and from since that time till this very sad time Satan as we know him now always wants worship you think about it when he met Jesus what's the first thing he said Bow Down and Worship me and that's the same tactics he has into this very time Hallelujah so you see Lucifer the son of the morning he was we may say co-equal with God in that sense man he was given power but he could not create because he was just a creation so he had he was under limitations so if a mother for him to do something he had to take something that was already created and for voted Hallelujah amen he was able to take something that God had created and pervert it and pervert it and into evil and evil thing and that started all the trouble Hallelujah you see when God saw him setting up his own kingdom right and there was a a whisper campaign in heaven Satan had a whisper campaign in heaven behind God's back now if you joined me up you know we can overthrow this and we can come into power amen and that's another thing that has been happening in this world today you know a lot of secret campaigns behind amen and I pray to God that is no secret campaigns here amongst us amen hallelujah we rebuke that in the name of Jesus Amen that no Spirit could creep in and trying to do something against God's word and God's perfect plan for our lives amen hallelujah see pride lifted up in his heart amen and he imagined he got two-thirds of the angels to back him up amen and he thought he had the majority because in man's system now they believe that two-thirds majority is the one is the winner but he failed to realize where the scripture say one shall chase a thousand and two shall Chase ten thousand so we always on the majority side no matter what man Hallelujah surrendered vessel in the hand of God will back seat and any time amen hallelujah so put Satan where he belongs Hallelujah Hallelujah see Michael and the dragon fought and Lucifer and was cast out so you see there was a falling way back in heaven and any time that someone heart is lifted up in Pride and anything expect to fall expect to afford because Prides go at before fall that's what the scripture says amen hallelujah so just bear that's in mind Hallelujah and with all the children and all the angels that he had deceived amen will cast down to the Earth and was subject then as the prophet said to become human to to come in human form amen hallelujah praise God you know Satan was God's right hand man and you know he knows more about the scripture than any Theologian in today's world when you talk about High knowledge and and think you know once I don't want to jump ahead because you get what you expect if expected to get knowledge and she did get knowledge and that knowledge is passed from there right down to even to this day Hallelujah praise God he knows more about the scripture than anything when you're talking about scripture he knew scripture Satan because when we spoke the last time on tempted Temptation amen you see he took the word and even when he appeared unto Eve he took the word and just Twisted a little bit amen he said to her thou shall not surely die and that not not of the whole human race amen the true aspana and messed up everything and everyone being enslaved by that not from then to know unless if you have been released by the grace of God who paid the price to get you back out of Satan's hellhole Hallelujah praise God God in the beginning knew who would received him and who would not receive him is that right man we've been taught therefore he could predestinate by foreknowledge so he knows the choices that you gonna make when you come here because you already made a choice when you were back there you did not take sight with Satan you took sides with Jesus and when you took it there you're going to take it back right here amen hallelujah so it's just a a a a a duplicate of what you did there you're gonna do here so if you didn't fall there you will not fall here Hallelujah praise God and my little thought again is the Fallen bribe man she he was the Fallen bride back then hallelujah praise God don't want to jump ahead praise God he could tell who would be saved and who wouldn't be safe for he knew which person would take up which spirit amen gotta take God's spirit or you're going to take Satan Spirit choose this day who you're going to serve but your choice was already made amen so that's why God in his foreknowledge can place you in the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah praise God thank you Lord Jesus you see the serpent was a very good looking creature attractive slick and could you communicate and as we put it in common language it was a sweet talker you could convince anyone amen Hallelujah Hallelujah man praise God he could convince anyone and he talked with Eve Satan is a created being and could only pavote what God had already created and has definite limitations amen so if you know if you don't know I want you to be aware tonight that is limited when we say God is all Mighty amen he can do all things amen Satan is limited Hallelujah in whatever he tries to do around you and to you is very limited very much limited and you have the authority to put a stop to that every single time every time you raise his head up you have the authority to cast him down kick him out your life amen Jesse has been cast out to Heaven you cast him out of your life right now amen hallelujah praise God see God test us Satan tempts us amen I want you to get that see God when you say God let us blame God for a lot of things amen especially in this world amen because that's the the tricks of the enemy he will cause something because you to do something and then he comes back and he blames you that you did it amen hallelujah but you gotta turn wrong and tell him it was not me in the first to begin with it was you so get the hands man Hallelujah praise God why does Satan tempts us he wants us to give in to his kind of life amen and give up on God's way of life amen and that is tactics all the time for you to give up for you to give in he will throw all kind of thing around your life for you to just throw in the towel you make your life so miserable amen right and then he will try to come and say you see what God do to you and blame God that God is doing it well meanwhile he is the one that is doing it Hallelujah he will present to you all the glitter and glamor sugar coat is poison his poisonous lies and say to you everyone is doing it look how happy they are amen how many times they come and he he he comes around and tell you that look how they're prospering and look how you catch in hell look how things going bad for you all kind of fraudulent situation around your life we see God tests you he tempts you man so you got to know the difference when you're being tested and when you're tempted Hallelujah big difference amen and this little like they might say a little talk tonight let it be more than a talk let it be part of your everyday living and life amen to recognize the tactics of who is your enemy you're fighting against not flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and what spiritual wickedness um and they didn't come just don't come from high high high places recognize that realize that and you're not in a picnic you're in a battle amen hallelujah and the greatest battle that you're ever going to be fighting is right here between yourself right here in your mind Satan took your mind God took your heart amen hallelujah praise God we've been taught all along these little things amen how to recognize your enemy and how to defeat him Hallelujah he will tell you everyone is doing it look how happy they are look how successful they are and you can be just like them doesn't judge that all the time look how they're prospering amen Islam said look at the Prosper like a bear tree but what happened the court don't they here today and they're gone tomorrow but you are not creatures of time and space you are creatures of Eternity and the more you recognize that you're just not an ordinary human being just living day-to-day and fighting up and struggling and and battling every day you got to realize that and recognize you more than just an ordinary human being placed on this Earth You are son and you're a daughter of the Living God Hallelujah see a Christian Life is an easy life and once you recognize Who You Are otherwise it will be battling and struggling and fighting up and banging your head or left right and Center amen once you recognize who you are and the kind of authority you have amen you're gonna be a overcomer amen hallelujah praise God praise God praise God Hallelujah don't you forget that the payment for sin is what disbelieving God's word is sure death man Hallelujah just as any Garden of Eden and you have that same Choice today don't you say that if I was if I would not do that you have that same Choice today amen believing God's word or disbelieving God's word taking God at this word or rejecting God's word amen taking God's promises or rejecting God's promises you have the same Choice amen hallelujah every single human being that's been placed on this Earth has that choice Hallelujah so you will enjoy the pleasures of sin for just a short period of time but after that is sure that spiritual death separation from God himself pleasure yeah you go to the party you drink and you dance up on your you you do everything as enough pleasure it's so sweet and nice for you amen but after that what about early hangover but when you get thrown in jail all the other things you make a crash accident you get drunk you run into somebody a man Satan make you do something real bad create a commit a terrible crime on that influence and then you're going to blame the alcohol you go blame the drugs you will blame that blame Satan he's the one who does it amen hallelujah and the the more you can recognize that he is a liar from the very beginning he's a deceiver from the very beginning and he come to kill and destroy amen mess up your light break marriages do all kind of thing in your life amen hallelujah that is Statics amen hallelujah and you got to recognize where he's coming from Hallelujah many believe that freedom is doing anything we want but true Freedom comes from obedience to God's word and knowing what not to do you get that I'm going to repeat it again true Freedom comes from obedience to God's word annoying not what to do Hallelujah you see yes you're free you're free moral religion you could live in your you say save you get baptized and just do anything you know I could run back anytime I make a mistake to God but true obedience is to keep God's word all the time men you might slip you might slide or fall but you know you're true to God's word man stick with it stay with it hold on to it it will take you through as we sang amen hallelujah praise God the boundaries that God has set up for your own good amen amen it's not don't do this don't do that don't do the other don't yeah it's for your own good why did God give the Israel the Ten Commandments it was for their own good but they could not keep it amen Hallelujah they just couldn't keep it and man the nature that man has is a rebelliousness to God's word that's why you gotta get God's nitya inside of you to obey God's word man you can live a Christian Life on your own and say you're gonna make it and it's like a a person wants to give up smoking or give up alcohol or something drink or drugs or something like that they'll try maybe one year two years three years four years five but the desire still is inside of them man that anytime they expose they run to it a little trouble take them they run back to it man Hallelujah but it will take God to take that only child and put his nature inside of you amen right brother a miraculous God hallelujah that can take you out from any situation or not out from any addiction does the God we're serving man Hallelujah so don't don't believe you could do this on your own and be successful and that is the challenge you've had amen she believed by Satan lying to her that she could be just like God amen hallelujah and a lot of us believe that we can make the Christian walk this journey on our own on our own terms it would never work cannot work it will take God's Life to Live in us and through us to make this journey man hallelujah praise God and just tighten it up a little bit with the last time as we spoke amen the Christian who walked amen hallelujah praise God that was a real blessing to me amen hallelujah praise God and I believe it was to you too amen hallelujah you know Christian Life is our everyday living I know everyday living and people find it hard because you know why they do not want to abide and take the way that God has provided us for a Believer a Christian to walk in amen hallelujah but if you choose God's way and choose God's principles you shall surely make it burdens become light cast all your cares upon Him Man cast all your kids you don't have to carry the Lord again put it upon him taking monkey as our pastor says take the monkey off your back may take the Lord off your head and rest it amen you're on the train you don't have to carry it let the train carry it Let Jesus bear your burdens Let Jesus Take Care all your problems because he's a burden-bearer is a problem solver Is A Healer amen have you proven him over and over again in your life this is everyday Christian Living amen you got to prove God every single day in your life amen that he is with you that he is in you he's the one that's leading he's the one that's providing and directed like the life becomes easy with him on board and invite him in your ship in your boat the boat of life amen this journey becomes easy no matter storms may come perilous times may come but Jesus is in your boat Hallelujah praise God thank you Lord don't listen to Satan lies that you have to do evil to gain more experience and learn more about life listen young people amen you don't have to go Satan way to learn more and get experience get God experience man when you have his experience you have everything because you start you get yourself grounded with him a true experience with the Lord Jesus Christ will groan your life in him and you're gonna know the difference you're gonna know the change amen and you know that is not you that living is Christ is living in me he is doing the work hallelujah praise God all those here who wants to be more like Jesus and you know that's the same question that Eve was faced with Hallelujah you see Satan uses sincere motive to persuade Eve you will become just like God you see Satan deceived Eve by misleading her to believe that his way was the right way amen by defying God's word and expect the results would come out the same does not work you take God out of the solution you take God out of your life problems ahead that is ahead trouble sometimes ahead amen as soon as I get God out of your plans we are placing God above replacing ourselves above God because we believe we're going to do it we can do it it doesn't work doesn't work friends and that's the same thing if taught by listening to Satan's deceit and they didn't take the whole Bible then take a whole version not a whole script channel one word one word and what the Book of Revelation say you change one jot one Title One Word here your name will be blotted out amen my brother Hallelujah you know he is living slide for please see sin does not always appear ugly but Pleasant and the more attractive the harder to avoid amen we sing yield not to Temptation because what healing is sin is when you're giving to sin that's what it is you're given to the Temptation that's why you're sinning amen by disbelieving God's word there is where the fall is going to start Hallelujah we always say look but don't lost we living in the world amen we're living in this world Hallelujah we see all kinds of things out there a pretty dress a nice this a nice start passing by you amen look yes you have eyes you're going to see all kinds of things but do not lust amen hallelujah simple Christian principles man so prepare yourself for the attractive Temptations that may come your way we cannot avoid temptation but there is a way of Escape as we're going to read from First Corinthians 10 and 13. Hallelujah they had no temptation taken you but such as command to man you know the Lord Jesus was tempted on every single thing that we could be tempted on amen and it did not succumb so what you should do get him in board and you won't come to it too Hallelujah so when you have him on board amen you would not give in to it Hallelujah but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able amen he know how much you could take amen so you go to he will make the enemy turn up the pressure for you amen to test you amen the enemies champion God is a low Satan o to temptation Hallelujah but will with the Temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear it amen hallelujah so you know what expect some trouble sometimes coming every son or daughter as we always say must be tried and tested amen hallelujah to prove who you really are what caused the fall amen Eve found yourself Walk In by yourself amen from under the protection of a husband Hallelujah she became an open Target for the enemy and when you as a Christian as the Bride As the elected Lady of the Lord Jesus Christ amen move from under the headship of your husband and who is your husband the word who is Christ so when you move from another protection from the word you are susceptible for attacks from the enemy to try to seduce you try to to destroy you you become an open Target for an attack amen praise God you see the man is the head of the woman amen and Christ is the head of the man amen so when you take Christ out of the picture you become a headless man and the woman is also headless too amen because in the scripture said the woman must subject herself to her husband to demand because he is the head and Christ is the head of the man so when you take the head of a man your home becomes fed less no Direction you don't know where to go is it logical make sense Hallelujah so bring back your head bring back the word restore the word back in your life bring back the Lord in your prayer life in your service to him amen hallelujah praise God we have some wonderful prayer services that is happening every single Friday night we have lots and lots of testimonies how God is good to all of us Hallelujah prayer is the engine of the church so why don't we pray pray pray you take off prayer from your home amen you take off direction from your home amen you take off the lifeline from your home chaos is going to happen man come join us it's an invitation hallelujah praise God and a lot of people are going to make this a lot of people are scared when they come into the Press service we go call them to pray you know that's a big distraction for people and I will expose that enemy right now caught his head off right now right now Hallelujah if you don't have a prayer life a personal prayer life why are you scared to come and join the president now if you're being called upon but for me when I see your comfort the first time in a press service I make I recognize you that I will not call you to pray right away let you get acclimatized in the atmosphere that's my tactics that's the way and to encourage you to see what is happening amen hallelujah praise God praise the name of the Lord hallelujah in the same slide Hallelujah in second Corinthians 11 13 it says but I fear less by any means as the serpent began if true is sability so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ what is said Paul is saying here he's saying it don't let anything ex distract you from the Simplicity of the Gospel don't let anything come in your way don't let anyone come in and try to bring in strange things that shift you from your real Focus amen hallelujah that is what you have been admonish here tonight don't let sit and sleep in any way don't leave any cracks open so you could creep in amen and let unbelief come into the home unbelief come into your life amen hallelujah to wreck your life amen hallelujah praise God Satan was the one who preached the first Suman and he had a congregation and her name was Eve which represented the whole human race you know you know if what it means she's the mother of all living amen hallelujah she was our representation day amen hallelujah so when she fall amen she pulled all of us with her by making Adam agree to her you see Adam he didn't really sinner he went in even Timothy Eyes Wide Open Anna wasn't deceived Eve was deceived Adam was not deceived but Adam was typing Christ you see in all this God had a plan so Eve had to fall amen the first bride After Fall for God to display his attributes sometimes you wanna people doesn't know why God do this why God brings sin why God brings sickness why God bring that you see God had attributes in him and wanted to display it to the humankind to the human race that is a Healer that is a savior that is a provider and all the other things amen hallelujah so these things had to come into play God being God is forcing all this and he had to make a way before even the problem and the situation arise Hallelujah that is the god that we serve a god with a plan amen hallelujah chastising in all in all the little thoughts that were brought forth amen hallelujah praise God Satan he was the first preacher and he preached the eve and Eve stopped and she listened amen hallelujah praise God and she fell by listening to reasoning against God's word so as soon as you start to reason well the prophet didn't mean what he was saying or this didn't really happen we have plenty of that going on there amen when you start you stop and you start a reason and strata start to analyze and try to to dissect and whatever amen there'll be a problem I'm gonna start amen God didn't say the analyzer or or or or or to try to understand it what did God say believe taking God at his word because God does not lie and it does not change his mind about his word his wanting to the end something else tomorrow no sir once it sets that settles it for eternity amen hallelujah praise God God word is eternal doesn't change hallelujah amen praise God praise God you see the church is represented by a woman and if you want to know the condition of the church just take a look at a woman today man as our Prophet always told us if you want to know the condition of the world too Israel is a type and the woman is another type hallelujah praise God give me slight five please in the message God's power to transform here notice the two types pardon me yeah notice that the type of the two Edens so closely put together type together till it may almost deceive the very elect right Matthew 24 24 says that it would be that way but I want us to stop for a few moments and consider these two Edens and the one thing especially how the Bible tells us that God's word did produce that Eden there amen the first season man and how God's word was us that the other Eden would come which is Satan's in and we are in Satan's Eden men Hallelujah because he always wanted to set up a kingdom eh and he has an opportunity and God gave him his opportunity right here in this earth amen and he God placed all his subjects with him and Satanism the first Eve fell back there but there's another Eve in Satan in that would not fall Hallelujah amen praise God now we also know that there has got to be another Eden if we would also listen to The Prophet Saint Paul in second Thessalonians the second chapter he who exalts himself that day will not come of the Lord until that man of sin be revealed I know we're talking about that manner sin amen Satan incarnate himself he who sits in the temple of God exalt him himself above all that is called God so that he as God is worshiped as God was saying before Satan always wanted worship and he has he is now congregation worshiping him amen he has all his seminaries all these churches all these denomination thank the serving the true unliving God meanwhile their worship is going to Satan what a deception the reading from the same Bible quoting the same scriptures just as how Satan does all the time but are deceived with the little lies the Creeds the dog doctrines and Dogma they placed inside of that to deceive amen hallelujah but God's people God's Eve in this age will not be deceived Hallelujah amen hallelujah think of that now in Isaiah 14 The Prophet said that he saw Lucifer in his heart through a vision on the inspiration of God saying he would do that 800 years before Paul amen now here 800 years later Paul sees him comes comes to his position notice his heads
