[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] good Sunday morning friends
[0:17] bless you neighbors
[0:20] welcome to believers from around the
[0:25] world and locally let us come into his
[0:31] house with Thanksgiving and into his
[0:36] courts with praise welcome to another
[0:41] broadcast sponsored by good neighbor
[0:45] ministries of Burlington Ontario I'm
[0:49] Pastor John Steinman let us pray
[0:53] our gracious Heavenly Father sincerely
[0:59] we pray from the bottom of our hearts
[1:01] for our prime minister for our premiere
[1:08] for the best of health and vigorous life
[1:15] we pray Lord for all frontline workers
[1:22] we pray for the safety of our neighbors
[1:25] and friends we pray for her loved ones
[1:31] and believers everywhere
[1:35] Oh God
[1:38] send forth thy light and truth from this
[1:43] broadcast may you shine your light of
[1:48] your word and your glorious gospel
[1:51] everywhere annoyed
[1:56] your servant as we preach the word and
[2:00] take all the glory honor and praise for
[2:05] we ask it in the name of our Lord Jesus
[2:08] Christ well friends last week I spoke on
[2:20] this subject of the quickening spirit
[2:25] the spirit quickening the word to the
[2:29] age and now I'd like to read from our
[2:33] King James Version of the Bible
[2:36] I'm reading first Corinthians chapter 15
[2:40] verse 45 and so it is written the first
[2:48] man Adam was made a living soul the last
[2:55] Adam was made a quickening spirit let us
[3:03] give glory to God that this marvelous
[3:07] quickening spirit of God is here with us
[3:11] this morning now before I begin to
[3:17] advance from where we left off last week
[3:23] I'd like to clarify the meaning of the
[3:29] word quicken what does this word quicken
[3:33] mean from Google it says to quicken
[3:38] means to make faster to speed up to
[3:48] accelerate something
[3:53] quicken for the means to stimulate us or
[3:58] to excite as in stimulating interest you
[4:03] know exciting interest to quicken means
[4:08] to restore life
[4:11] for example the body of Christ that laid
[4:16] in the tomb for three days was written
[4:20] by the Holy Spirit which means he was
[4:23] restored back to life now there's a
[4:29] ancient or arc-8 meaning to the word
[4:33] written but it has some application to
[4:37] what we are talking about and one of
[4:42] those meanings is to cause a fire to
[4:46] burn to quicken is to cause a fire to
[4:51] burn also to quicken means ah signs of
[4:59] life signs of life for example of signs
[5:07] of movement of a fetus and the mother
[5:13] can now become conscious that there is
[5:18] life life is coming for signs of life
[5:24] now with that understanding last Sunday
[5:28] in part two of this series on the spirit
[5:32] clintons the word I quoted from a poem
[5:37] written by K L Brown called the little
[5:42] plant and here it is in the heart of a
[5:47] seed buried deep so deep a tiny plant
[5:52] lay fast asleep wake said the sunshine
[5:57] and creep to the light wake said the
[6:01] voice of the rain drops bright the
[6:04] little
[6:05] plant herd and rose up to see what they
[6:11] wonderful outside world would be that's
[6:16] a plan from KL Brown now I talked about
[6:22] how we are offsprings of the almighty
[6:27] Acts chapter 17 verses 26 to 29 for Paul
[6:32] there in the accent says for you are his
[6:36] offspring you are his children in other
[6:40] words you are his attributes you are his
[6:43] seat genes and uh now we understand I
[6:48] spoke of how we were in him from before
[6:53] the foundation of the world and uh
[6:58] just as a man would have his children in
[7:03] him until he is able to see his
[7:08] generation that were in him well he can
[7:14] see his generation made manifest in
[7:18] front of him then he can talk to them
[7:22] and they can talk with him and they can
[7:26] have fellowship one with the other now
[7:31] if you're a true child of God then you
[7:34] really are an eternal being that has
[7:39] trapped in a body of time or a time body
[7:44] in one sense you're a soul imprisoned
[7:51] imprisoned here but thanks be to God the
[7:58] Word of God as it went down into the
[8:01] prison and set the prisoners free that
[8:04] same word of God is here in this last
[8:08] day this last age to sit every captive
[8:13] on every prisoner free by the opening of
[8:17] the world
[8:18] the opening of the prison doors and
[8:21] using the key of Revelation
[8:25] upon this rock I'll build my church and
[8:29] the gates of Hell will not prevail
[8:31] against them by the opening of the
[8:35] Gateway you are able to come out into
[8:39] the unfailing reality of the Living God
[8:43] to recognize who you are and that you
[8:47] are an eternal being and you know in a
[8:53] movie some years ago there was a
[8:56] character in there called et but that's
[9:01] just a movie you and I are the real et's
[9:06] eternal beings come from the presence of
[9:11] Almighty God trapped in a flesh body
[9:16] serving his purpose here on earth until
[9:19] our return back to glory yes
[9:23] et it's going home time I'm here to tell
[9:27] you ET it's rapture time it's time for
[9:32] us to turn our hearts towards heaven and
[9:36] home and towards our Heavenly Father
[9:39] with joy within our hearts knowing that
[9:43] we on our way back to the Godhead we are
[9:47] way back going back into the presence of
[9:50] the Almighty God now with the opening of
[9:53] the seven seals we have witnessed the
[9:57] coming of the Lord in the form of his
[10:01] resurrected restored and revealed word
[10:06] which is no preparing our hearts and
[10:11] prepared the way for his corporal coming
[10:15] the rapture is at hand the time is at
[10:20] hand the Lord's rapturing power is here
[10:26] amongst us to prepare us for the event
[10:31] already by His grace in the process of
[10:37] the rapture which leads up to the event
[10:42] of the rapture and I'm glad I'm ending

[21:03] then raises it up
[21:06] I believe he's here today to identify
[21:09] his own but he came to seek and to save
[21:12] those that were lost and he is seeking
[21:16] he is seeking the lost is kindly
[21:19] entreating Oh turn turn for why will you

[22:08] the Spirit is here to quicken the word
[22:12] and to make it live again he quickens
[22:17] the word because he wants us to be his
[22:20] witnesses now I realize I'm not speaking
[22:23] only that he's quitting our
[22:26] understanding today words written in the
[22:30] Bible or in the message but the Spirit
[22:33] of God is here to quicken you and I who
[22:38] are living revelations of that word for
[22:44] we were a part of that word from before
[22:48] the foundation of the world and preach
[22:51] through the predestinated mystery of his
[22:55] will please into human bodies that we
[23:00] were born into for a purpose that we
[23:04] might manifest him we have a name to
[23:07] declare we have a mission to to perform
[23:11] and we have a word from him that we must
[23:15] make manifest we have a character that
[23:18] we must declare that the people can see
[23:21] God in Christ Christ in the church and
[23:24] the kingdom coming less it be his holy
[23:27] and precious name yes sir now we realize
[23:32] that the spirit which was the word to
[23:37] make it live and the word is a conductor
[23:41] for the Holy Spirit well the Spirit
[23:46] follows the Word of God
[23:48] and causes the Word of God to live takes
[23:54] me to God the great holy spirit the
[23:57] white horse rider is here raining on the
[24:02] word into our hearts on the white horse
[24:06] of the revelation of the word Rivet
[24:11] revelation 19:11 260 and he came riding
[24:17] on the white horns and upon his time he
[24:20] was written king of kings lord of lords
[24:22] and his name was called a word of God
[24:25] that conquering all conquering word King
[24:29] is writing into art spirits are so today
[24:34] we have the opportunity for him to be
[24:39] the mighty Conqueror and to have the
[24:42] preeminence in our lives and that we can
[24:45] surrender all and live for him
[24:49] forgetting the past that is behind and
[24:52] pressed the words of glorious wonderful
[24:55] future of a genuine Christian life
[24:59] walking in the light of the world
[25:01] amen now of course we understand friends
[25:05] that though they the word is a conductor
[25:09] for the Holy Spirit but plastic cannot
[25:14] conduct the Holy Spirit or me a
[25:17] conductor for the Holy Spirit if you're
[25:19] just a plastic Christian if you're a one
[25:23] that is a dramatic Christian that lives
[25:26] by oh and Christian is supposed to act
[25:29] this way and you perfect your act your
[25:34] your Christian act until it becomes
[25:37] nothing but a Christian Rama life you're
[25:41] nothing but a plastic Christian you see
[25:44] God can't flow through that God can't
[25:47] use that as a conductor Oh God can't
[25:51] flow through rubber you know rubber is
[25:55] not a conductor is an insulator so here
[25:58] you find that you've got these rubber

[26:14] somewhere out there like that God
[26:18] doesn't look for rubber Christians

[26:51] God
[26:51] they'll be ashamed to raise their hands
[26:54] to their Creator and to their makeup Oh

[27:10] they're to sit told when they can say

[31:17] carriers of the Word of God who are
[31:21] willing to bear the shame and reproach
[31:25] for this message and for his name to be
[31:29] reproach for his name oh yes they call
[31:33] you one God people they call you serpent
[31:37] seed people they call you all kinds of
[31:41] names amen holy rollers Pentecostal even
[31:48] people of this message don't recognize
[31:50] the difference by an anointed message
[31:53] child of God - uh a modern-day
[31:59] Pentecostal contrary to God's Word they
[32:03] can't even discern the Lord's body and
[32:06] if you knew you're an animated anointed
[32:10] and moving on the inspiration of
[32:12] northing and leadership the Holy Spirit
[32:14] and the gifts of God are rich and pure
[32:18] and holy and working within the body
[32:22] they can't even recognize God's Spirit
[32:26] god help us in this hour thanks be to
[32:30] God
[32:31] we are here the beard or approach for
[32:34] this word that we are carrying great
[32:38] even so he's calling you and I to become
[32:42] messengers of his grace and of his mercy
[32:46] to quicken to quicken we could also
[32:50] means to cause a fire to burn oh thank
[32:56] god the mechanics of the word has been
[32:59] restored and a lot of believers are
[33:02] happy with the mechanics of the word
[33:04] they are happy with all the quotations
[33:07] they're happy with knowing all the
[33:10] wonderful things said spoken by the
[33:13] great messenger that came they're very
[33:16] happy with that the word has been
[33:19] restored on part of his spiritual body
[33:23] also being restored because the written
[33:28] word and spoken word that was restored
[33:31] was there was just a representation of
[33:36] the believers or of the spiritual bodies
[33:44] of the elect for this age and for this
[33:49] owl and the Word of God is calling out
[33:52] in this day and in this hour as a spirit
[33:56] Gosport he crawls to his own o blessed
[33:59] be his name to quicken us and cause us
[34:03] for the fires of God tupperman in our
[34:06] soul yes sir she the bright body is
[34:12] ready she's ready for the fire to fall
[34:18] let the fire fall
[34:20] let me anointing come let the rapture
[34:24] come I'm ready you are ready let's get
[34:28] ready that's being ready let's be
[34:30] prepared what fire I'm talking about the
[34:33] fire of the Holy Ghost I'm talking about
[34:36] the far as it was on the day of
[34:39] Pentecost I'm talking about the dynamics
[34:43] coming up on the mechanics I'm talking
[34:48] about the pillar of fire
[34:51] they love ghosts of God coming upon the
[34:55] written word the Rhema of God the Lumos
[35:01] causes the written Rhema word to convey
[35:07] to shine out the McNown itself to reveal
[35:13] God's secrets yes sir - cause that word
[35:18] to live again written spoken and living
[35:24] word to live again and to produce
[35:28] another book of Acts another book of
[35:33] actions moved by the Holy Spirit
[35:38] anointed by God God living moving and
[35:43] having his entire being in his people
[35:46] and he making himself manifest as their
[35:50] God their creat creator their Redeemer
[35:54] their Savior
[35:56] they're coming King blessed be his name
[35:58] thank you Lord hallelujah
[36:01] yes sir God's Spirit is here with us
[36:06] today
[36:06] now we want to use the illustration as
[36:10] has already been utilized by God's
[36:13] prophet that you can have a perfectly
[36:18] brand-new car a beautiful Porsche a
[36:25] wonderful Cadillac whatever the car of
[36:31] your heart brand new but if that color
[36:40] has no gas in it you may keep polishing
[36:45] that car all day long all day long and
[36:49] marry it admiring the church admiring
[36:53] the admiring your life even that you're
[36:58] a good man you're a good woman here you
[37:00] know you live for you're a church man
[37:03] you're a church woman here
[37:05] you may even say you're a message
[37:06] believer I follow the word that's that's
[37:09] okay but all you have is a polished up
[37:12] car and a good exterior where your
[37:16] actions and your acts your
[37:18] dramatizations are so less that none can
[37:21] see your discern what lurks our lives
[37:24] behind that veil oh but if there is no
[37:30] gasoline in the car the car will not
[37:34] move you can turn the key as much as you
[37:37] want the car will move but then if you
[37:43] went to God's filling station for
[37:45] inspiration and the Holy Ghost stretches
[37:48] soul opens up the word and the word that
[37:52] you have been accumulating through the
[37:55] day the years like the Apostles did
[37:58] while they were with Jesus three and a
[38:00] half years they F with him they slept
[38:02] with him they fished with him and they
[38:04] knew him the word but they have no
[38:07] revelation of who he was who he really
[38:10] was
[38:11] they this F stinks but here it is
[38:14] brother sister the Word of God was a
[38:17] being stored up in your storehouse of
[38:21] your soul that word was dead back into
[38:25] you and you may have been following it
[38:28] for years and years following it but
[38:32] that still will not make your vehicle
[38:36] move for your vehicle to move you first
[38:41] have to be able to have a key electronic
[38:44] or a natural one that's placed in there
[38:48] and when that kids turned are pressed
[38:51] something happens you must have have to
[38:55] get in there already and when that key
[38:59] which is what I'm trying to determine by
[39:02] the Holy Spirit that key is turn then
[39:06] something happens within the combustion
[39:09] chamber of the power the combustion
[39:13] chamber of the human heart all of us
[39:17] a spark a revelation a supernatural
[39:23] inspiration from the presence of God
[39:25] strikes that soul and the spark in the
[39:28] combustion chamber off of that spot club
[39:31] strikes that gas in there and it just
[39:35] produces power it produces high-octane
[39:39] power takes you from the first and
[39:42] second pull and puts you under the
[39:45] inspiration of the mighty angel
[39:48] inspiration of the third pole to move in
[39:52] him and live in him and have your being
[39:54] in him
[39:55] so that you may be a conductor for the
[39:57] word of God and that his word may come
[40:00] to pass in and through your life oh then
[40:04] you'll become a nutball then you become
[40:06] strange to people then you may be called
[40:10] crazy you may be called a different you
[40:15] can't be explained why because it's the
[40:18] Word of God making the self known in you
[40:22] as an individual Oh blessed be the name
[40:26] of our Living God
[40:27] yes sir so God just quittance us and
[40:32] uses us as conductors that we might
[40:36] relay convey that we might conduct his
[40:41] word witnesses you shall become
[40:45] witnesses after that the Holy Ghost is
[40:49] come upon you when he dwells in you and
[40:53] he flows through you oh thanks be to God
[40:56] he lives in me I pray God he lives in
[41:00] you I pray God that all you have is not
[41:03] just a baptism of the Holy Ghost for the
[41:06] word baptized means back tips or comes
[41:09] from the word baptism which means to dip
[41:12] in and under and to be brought back out
[41:16] so a baptism means you went in and then
[41:20] you went under yes you went under but to
[41:23] come back out but we're not talking
[41:25] about just a baptism of the Holy Ghost
[41:27] just a vacation made wait for a second
[41:30] patience sanctification made way for the
[41:33] baptism of the holy spirit and now the
[41:36] holy the Baptist and Holy Spirit makes
[41:39] way for the Holy Ghost himself to end
[41:42] well
[41:43] the Emmanuel then again he may be God
[41:47] with us that he might become the son of
[41:51] man being revealed again in this church
[41:54] body the bright form making himself
[41:57] known to his people by living in them
[42:00] walking in them moving in them being
[42:03] their God in them the word that was made
[42:06] flesh back there now you flesh that has
[42:10] been redeemed is going back to becoming
[42:13] word from the presence of Almighty God
[42:15] so how does the spirit quicken the word
[42:20] so that we are so that the word can
[42:24] become the vehicle to to make known his
[42:29] truth to make known his presence and his
[42:35] perfect stature his character his
[42:40] children walking like him acting like
[42:43] him moving like him under because it's
[42:47] in their nature they're a part of him
[42:49] and they're moving in the holy spirit of
[42:52] the Living God hallelujah now he does it
[42:57] by revelation Paul the Apostle did say
[43:04] how that by revelation he made known to
[43:10] me the mystery Ephesians chapter 3 verse
[43:14] 3 by revelation all with all of his
[43:18] understanding Paul Peter turned to Paul
[43:22] and said Paul you're saying such deep
[43:24] things that even I have to think about
[43:27] them I I oh I have to really get to
[43:31] understand some of the things you're
[43:32] saying Paul but Paul said and that's not
[43:36] me he revealed to me the mystery he had
[43:40] to make it known and know
[43:43] with his own wisdom of understanding can
[43:47] stand before God's bright but God has to
[43:51] send his servants with his word for this
[43:54] hour and by revelation he made known to
[43:59] me the mystery or in other words he
[44:03] revealed to me his hidden secrets he
[44:06] revealed to me previously hidden things
[44:09] and made them plain yes sir
[44:12] Oh what is a mystery a mystery
[44:16] is a hidden secret something that was
[44:20] hidden now made plain but in which a
[44:25] supernatural element still remains
[44:29] I believe that supernatural element is
[44:31] the element of the Holy Spirit's ability
[44:34] to reveal the word and to propagate the
[44:38] word by revelation the fertilizer soul
[44:43] enter father make you with the presence
[44:46] of God and the power of the Holy Spirit
