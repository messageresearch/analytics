kingdom praise the Lord we're going to go to Romans 8. 28 and we know that all things work together for good to those who love God and to those who are they called according to his purpose amen you may be seated and we know that all things work together for good to those and to who are the called according to his purpose that means we are called for a purpose my my subject tonight is God's sovereignty and human tragedy gods of reality and human tragedy Hallelujah every human being on Earth desires to have a good things right praise God for their lives everybody we desire to have a good things for our life who don't want to put in for their lives can I have anybody who doesn't want a good thing for his life you can never have no one that said I don't have nothing good for my life Hallelujah we want to have cars houses businesses children and all kind of apparels riches Fame of this world a Fame of this world Christians or non-christians everybody praise God that is good nothing wrong about that is there anything wrong about that no you need to have you need to have that so for us you can manage it well through the wisdom of God not for this world here remember before God gave you everything there is a purpose people have so much they don't know what to do with it they're useful things that is unnecessary but the children of God we always desire things because you have a good intention to have them because God give us cash what we do with the cars we take it to work and we drive DACA we dedicated that car to God and drive every day and night to come to the house of the Lord to worship Him all the money that you made what do you do you pay your tithes you take you use it wisely the richest doesn't mean that you have abundance God children are rich we are rich in health we are rich in properties not here only by the world to come everything that you have you will never lose it if you use it wisely for the glory of God we have houses we have Fellowship we we do so many things in our houses we we live inside there and put it God gave us that houses that's a roof on our head to live to enjoy the world that we are living in Hallelujah but we fail remember nothing good comes from Satan all good things come from God Hallelujah Satan will never give you any good things his intention is to destroy he can make you be he can why God give you in riches or something he can turn that riches to benefit for himself sat down some some time we are not allow the people to use that riches for the glory of God he used it for his own benefit God is sovereign he can do all things there is nothing that God cannot do there is nothing can God cannot do he can do all things but let me tell you we human beings whether Christian or not Christians when anything anytime bad things happen to us we always have questioning our mind you always go we started rebuking we decided to do all do all kinds of things have questions in our mind in our thoughts everywhere you can't even that's the way the fresh Acts you can't sustain it but sometimes we fail to recognize that God is suffering he can do all things Hallelujah if God is suffering he can do all things anything that comes to your way if you read the book of Romans as we read it because I read it again and we know that all things work together for good to those who love God right if all things work together for those who love God why sometimes things happening we don't go to him and pray I ask I see whether the hand of God isn't it I will turn around and frustrate ourselves and put yourself in jeopardy for instance if you go to the doctor just right now and you have let me tell you Satan is doing all kind of things if you turn around whether you're a Believer you're not believer the sickness is everywhere somebody has diabetes somebody had the blood pressure somebody have this somebody have this somebody have this are you going to stay all night without sleeping and thinking about all these symptoms it's a question to all of us if all things work together for those who love God you don't know whether it's from God or what it is first thing what you have to do you have to go to God your heavenly father and pray to him he can do all things he can he can heal you right there or you can hear you in the future along the way or there's something in your life somewhere God wants to use that tragedy for his own Glory sometimes you use those things that to bring his children in line all his ministers in line but we always want something good sleep you always want to be happy who don't want to be happy everybody wants to be happy I don't want to get sick I don't want to get into problem I want to have money I Want to Be Free who don't want to be free everybody wants to be free but let me tell you the freedom God has given to us is more than anything what you're looking for in this life because the Bible said this world will pass away this world that we are living it will pass away whether you live before Rapture or you stay on the Rapture You're Gonna Leave This World Behind Hallelujah glory to God so why don't you lift up your eye to your heavenly father when something happened whether you're gonna use that thing there for me to go home earlier you remember one Prophet God told him man set you up set your house in order tonight I'm gonna take you what happened he turned his back because why he has riches God bless him abundantly and the world was good he was living right and the brother the brother was right with God he don't want to leave this world here so he turns back I wept saw Lord I don't want to leave I want to stay a little bit do you want to stay a little bit Hallelujah glory to God Amen God is good I love the Lord his words are marvelous his words are perfect he made you perfect he's guiding you perfect oh Hallelujah we serve a sovereign God Hallelujah glory to God thank you Lord I'm gonna read something for you here we read we read the scripture and that scripture that we read pertain to we're gonna see it is common to hear people rejoice or sometimes even boast that their material properties is a blessing from God yet have you ever had anyone say my business failure was a blessing from God have you ever ever had anybody anybody say like that my business failure is a blessing from God hallelujah whoever lose the business and rejoice Hallelujah oh what he's doing is going up and down up and down up and down instead of him to turn back to his maker who gave him that business to run for his life because that business as a Believer the business that he ran is for a purpose because the scripture says all good things come from God and everything that you have is is is a purpose Hallelujah thank you Lord nobody nobody rejoice when you lose business why is it only good things are seen as blessing why Hallelujah bad things is not a blessing but Bible said all things work together for those who love the Lord hallelujah so you have to count everything that happened in your life a blessing don't tell your heart your face to your brother your sister and have a long face Rejoice smile God knows everything in your life and his interest is he has interest every little thing in your life there is nothing in your life God is not interested Hallelujah because he call you and me for a purpose thank you Lord amen why is it that only good things are seen as blessing why bad things are viewed as tragedies bad things are viewed as tragedies human beings from a very limited perspective what looked like a tragedy may be the best thing that ever happened to you maybe what you look that this is bad thing that ever happened to me is the best thing that I have ever happened to you you that's why you always recognize the god that you said he's he can do all things he is God he never changed he started his strategy when he speak wanting that thing is forever it's eternal he does not turn back Hallelujah God don't save you today and you lost tomorrow he serve you once and for all so the word of God is absolute don't joke with it don't play with it let your life lie in line with the gospel the word of God Hallelujah particularly when God's hand is super superintendent it's very intending an outcome for example a poor youth whose family sold him into slavery May emerge later as a wiser person fit to be fit to be the king you understand what he's saying there Joseph when Joseph was put in the pit and he went to Egypt they sent him to prison why are you going to think about that oh it's a big tragedy yes but you don't know how the hand of God is into it that's why when something happened to somebody don't sit there or stand there and criticize I said all this all this you gotta say something at last you're gonna regret pray for one another live for one another We Are One bunch of happiness and and special people in the eyes of God why do you change if you become one Accord anything that you said will come to pass see we have to be one one Accord this young man people view that view it at he won everything from his father when he told his dream they do not understand but God has prepared him for a special purpose and he has passed he has to pass through something tragic tragic that you think is not of God something or maybe sometimes we view people oh something happened secretary secret sin as job his own friend told him oh that's a secret thing he that's the secret that's it instead of them to pray for him and lift him up and help him job was praying anything that happened to you as a Christian don't take it delighted pray the god that yourself answer every prayer every prayer there is no prayer God does not answer that's our tools that he has given to us why do you think in the day of Pentecost when they walk even walk on this people used to bring brought their sick people and lie them on the street this is how much they believe in them why even now people doesn't believe the Christians as soon as sometimes they mention your Christian they're running away where is the power of God that God doesn't have any power anymore he gave everything to us don't tell me God doesn't have a power anymore you have to be salty you have to be certain that the god that you you have you have to make him real in your life make God real in your life let the people see that the god that itself is a living God he is not a dead God he's a living God Hallelujah he lived forevermore where is God now it's in you you can't tell me God Is On The Way like when we were children when we when we message God we look to the sky that God is in God is in heaven what is no more in heaven what is here [Music] God is here my brethren he deny why are you in program get on your knees sometimes we are too lazy to pray you you can you can't go to your father say give me something for I need this give me something give me some no sincerity humbleness desperation humble yourself before God and God will show himself to you now Christianity has become everything fastpassed like a fast food Chinese food everything here everything here no God does not change be sincere even Prophet himself our own Prophet that we believe God told him you are not sincere enough what about we laziness too much lazy because we have everything we have thanked us in our home we have food some is rotting the fridge there you never go hunger go to Africa somewhere there maybe 12 people my friend we have everything sometimes it's poorers It spoilers when you get to something where you don't have like the woman who doesn't have nothing an Elijah all what he has she was going to eat and die but he sacrificed it she sacrificed herself and gave it to the man of God why can you do that now oh this is only one only this is only what what I have if I give it to you hmm Brother Glenn I don't think it's enough it's not enough to I I will see our situate no when you are going to pick up your brother to come to the church you murmuring every day this brother I gotta pick up and I gotta pick let me tell you this church here that's this that's the way this church was built we brought people everywhere that we were happy sunshine or rain we're driving to pick people up to bring them to the church we share what we have Hallelujah thank you Lord God is sovereign over the things that happen to us God is suffering over the things that happen to us Hallelujah that does not mean that everything that happened to us is his responsibility for example he does not cause evil God does not cause evil let me tell you what Satan is therefore Satan is a two that God uses anytime that he won let me tell you what what happened to job Satan couldn't touch job until he went to God to ask permission job is different than you job is the Son of God you are Son of God before certain touch he has to go as permission Hallelujah let me tell you when we walk like this don't think that you are just walking you are these people's investigation angels Hallelujah everywhere you look my brother my sister is recorded in heaven everywhere you turn around like this is recorded in heaven you understand everything here is recorded whoever you speak to about the word of God whatever you speak whatever he say is recorded don't think that you are just a person a people sitting on the pill every day at night we are special people we are God people God is God he is Sovereign he does not change why God take the the jewishide amorites and all those people and put the children of Israel there say now they stay fighting for them why why they were worshiping others and the children of Israel were children of God you are the children of God God can take one here and put you there Hallelujah God can make you rich overnight if you want to use you to do some work God can make you poor somewhere if you want to use it somewhere God can make your hand cut if you want to if you want to use yourself for something people he can make your hand come back if you were to use it for something why sometimes you go somewhere and the people doesn't believe people doesn't believe you turn around and perform a miracle then everybody have turned around me and brother coffee when we went to Africa my brother has a stroke two three Strokes he couldn't he couldn't get up my my Village knows me where where I was not good I was very very I don't know how to talk about it how do you how to get not good that I am a bad like uncontrollable but I was I don't know how to put it I was very active very active you can't you can't control me anything that I want to do I'll do it to talk when I when I we went there I'm praying for my brother who couldn't get up for him to get up what even the stick like this he can't get up they have to help him when we pray for him and he got up and watch steps like this and come back came back and go back and stand there and lift that the whole place started uproaring because they never see that God did that to prove himself that he is with us glory to God Hallelujah and this was a Oh pray for me this was a prayer for me this one they pray for me the word of God was manifesting so God can use you anytime you got to be ready he is suffering don't justify yourself when you get a trouble you don't know a child of God God said to us to allow God has to allow Satan before he can touch you and God can use that tragedy tragedy to do his work sometimes he can make you to go to a hospital because somebody there his son or his daughter there that he wanted to express him to him or her Hallelujah God can take you anywhere that's why you always have to be ready if you're a child of God and you're you you are you are in line and sometimes if you get stubborn and you don't want to go he can use that tragedy to fix you up are you lock you up as a Shepherd when a sheep he doesn't he doesn't listen he run what what do you do you take the leg and then he break the leg and the Sheep now he can't go nowhere so we have to rely upon the shepherd then you get familiar to the shepherd so after that everywhere you go go here you follow him yeah he follow him you're going to start then they follow him Hallelujah Oh Glory to God Amen God can use his use tragedy to perform his duties for example let's talk about Jonah Jonah a prophet was a sinful City God cannot control that City and God children were there and because the city was so much Idol adultery this City all the children began to worship join themselves to worship that adult and you know the other God they were worshiping was away somebody may look at Jonah how did Jonah somebody somebody we don't know whether God has a a a a oxygen tank in the belly there that sustained Jonah Jonah found himself where because let me tell you the city was so bad Jonah don't want to go you understand he does not want to go so God said you don't want to go the the reason why I'm sending you these people they worship the will so if you don't go I'm I'm giving you a ride a special ride then he put him right in the Jonas birthday and then the waist belly and Jonah found himself Hallelujah that's the time he was praying that's why I told him when you get it some things track you don't stay there you're not remember could you imagine a way badly he doesn't know whether Jerusalem is here Bethlehem is here Jordan is here Egypt is here and he already know what Solomon said when you are in trouble and you tell your heart and before the temple of God and you pray God will hear you now where is the temple of God that's here in your heart you understand that's why you have to pray when tragedy strike and the city it was a time when everybody dreads themselves no those times when when they're worshiping diagnosis it's not just the city drums because I know my country how do people worship they they have drums dancing with the drinking with all kinds of rivalries and they were there waiting for this whale somebody's blessing is somebody's tragedy while they were waiting on the shore for the way to come for them to worship him a prophet workout walking out foreign from the mouth of the whale repent Hallelujah that is a glorious time God perform his work he used that tragedy to perform his duty God can use you anytime whatever you want you cannot tell God what to do so when something happened to you don't Point your finger to Satan and Satan and Satan pray you have the tools God has given us the tools to use not every time you're gonna come around that's why pray for me and you and you you sit in there Tim Martin or somewhere eating sandwich no you have to pray you can sit on on the team uh uh Madonna somewhere with a uh that uh Sandwich inside in your mouth and you call me to pray why you have the trouble we have to change our lifestyle we have to change our lifestyle this is serious time now it's time to go home all this message is coming God is preparing us Hallelujah it's a wake-up call Hallelujah thank you Lord you think it was easy for Jonah in the West Valley everywhere he turned around something fried up because all the Bulls and everything everything's inside there everything it's like like a Italian it's a soup with all kind of things inside it well don't know what's inside it was a big tragedy it wasn't easy for him you understand so what I'm telling you Hallelujah that anytime some things struck you you have to turn around and pray and ask God because he has given you the tools as I said you can't sit in Madonna and write and give you and call brother Bill Oh Brother Bill I have this and this and me why are you sitting my daughter or maybe you will sit here somewhere eating Fufu somewhere it does not work Hallelujah that's not where you pray and you you call it what do you call it the uh the the reinforcement the prayer team is for reinforcement Hallelujah we can get everything easy easy easy all the way people we are getting lazy not only you are everybody that's why our barely getting fun you see over here over here everywhere coming coming from here coming from the side coming from here no more fasting and fasting is good for your belly Hallelujah we getting lazy praise God have mercy upon us Hallelujah let us be serious for the gospel that he has given you and this gospel is the one that is taking us home Hallelujah is taking us home you know all this Prophets and all these are the buyer the Paul Peter and all those things they went through a lot of tragedies shipwreck going through desert with a snake bite everywhere oh this so that the gospel could shine they did all this for the gospel to shine they saw a reality that nothing can nothing can stand your way please don't let nothing stand your way even death Paul that's what person therefore is your sting grief what is your victory you understand he cannot contain them let me tell you devs cannot control us no I will wait till Jesus come Hallelujah we will work till Jesus come let's say we will work till Jesus come everybody we will work till Jesus come Hallelujah there is a way for us to do Hallelujah this gospel is not easy you can't just lie in your bed and said this gospel could shine there's work to do well sometimes we can we come over here and listen to the message that we are sleeping we are sleeping could imagine not you everybody all of us sometimes you can't open your eye what happened something wrong somewhere Hallelujah we have to be serious amen thank you Lord God sovereignty means that he is God and has the right to do to work out of to work out his own purpose in our life God sovereignty means that he is God and has the right work out his own purpose in our lives so anything that happened to you God Hand is your name he can heal you he can take you home he can tell you he can tell you just pray and find out what is the cause of this Lord what do you have me to do Lord what do you want me to do are you are you one you go to the hospital and speak with somebody we tend to be quick to judge whether what happened to us is fair or unfair quick how might our prospective change if we took the view that Joseph had when he when he confronted his brothers I'm in the prayers of God but as for you you meant evil against me but God made it for good Joseph God sent him over there to preserve one life yes he's telling me there to preserve life if God didn't send Joseph there and use him and tell Pharaoh what to do to to to to to to save the Grain and stuff like that the whole world will perish you you don't know why how God gonna use you anything that happened to your life you don't know he said anything that happened to us has a purpose so not every time you're gonna you're gonna something happened to you I rejoice Lord what do you have me to do I rejoice when I say is it my time to go let that perfect will be done the lord giveth the Lord take it blessed be the name of the Lord if we believe we don't own our lives anything that happened to you there's the hand of God is in it because you don't know how what time you sleep when you go to bed you know what how you sleep you know what are you gonna wake up tomorrow you know we don't know what what are you gonna wake up tomorrow so many people sleep they don't wake up so many people sleep by the time they they get up their eye opening but they can't get up God has to turn around and tell them what to do the doctors cannot heal one day somebody's sick and they take him to the doctor Hospital they they knew that what what they have to do but they don't know whether that person could have survived or he doesn't survive they try the best as they can it's God that healed that person yes so God control every life God every life here God control it but we have blessed that we have found God has colored an open understanding to know the God that he control the life is in the heart hear me that's a blessed blessed bonus blessing and this life is going on toward eternity glory to God amen so I'm gonna uh I'm going to pray something for you now our own prophet brother Brown when he was beginning his ministry the time when God was directing him somewhere somewhere he stumble and God has to bring him back in life because why he has a work for God for you and me if God is Abraham to reveal to us who we are now he has introduced to because he has to introduce for Christ to Christ so if there's anything that will will hinder the word of God God human beings sometimes as a lamb real arms God has to break our leg for us so that he can work control us so I'm gonna play this Tafe for you to hear what God did through our Prophet then after that taste Lana that's why he through that message we are all here rejoicing my brother can you pray the tape this step is a 1950. the life story of Abraham just want to play Pray a letter a couple paragraph s in other words look like the picture of someone hanging across the wiggling out there when they hear the shadow I said yes it was my sins [Music] honey daddy's coming to see me this morning I pulled off her rubber glove they're like 2300 running iodine breaking up

vision all that can have happened God gave me a vision he was going to kill himself he couldn't die he came down and God gave me a vision and they think that it was worried God show him that showed him that they are not dead they are there not even that he built a mansion for him Hallelujah so what are you worried about it you see he looked tragedy big tragedy the wife the daughter the gun he can't take it all because God wants to work straight him to his word but all that thing happened to bring a blessing to the children of God in this world so when does something happen turn your eye after that brother Brahm never turned back again he preached oh it's hot to the world and God bless him not every blessing you think or every tragedy he thinks the devil you can bless but sometimes
