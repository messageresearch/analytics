please be seated thank you so much thank all of you appreciate it I really appreciate uh the wonderful Brethren and their service especially at this particular time where we have this uh virus challenge it's challenging us challenging the church you know it's consuming the societ in the community but for us the church it's a challenge right uh and uh especially the Lord has granted me right uh you know I might be like a like a mini what should I say anyway I got a lot of left hands and right hands and feet and I want to thank uh uh the brenon family so much for standing faithful and really serving the lord and helping in every aspect right uh from as much as uh buying groceries for me when I needed and I can't go out or something like that and and uh various things I want to thank like brother Phillip and his family that steps into the Gap sometimes when I need them praise God Raman family uh Amanda and and Alvin over here I want to thank God for them praise God Hallelujah especially I mean they their hands on right and praise God for that and we thank God and we pray that God will bless them there are others that do various things and I appreciate I want every one of you to know that I appreciate you very much and in general the fact that is in the midst of all of this uh you are here in the house of the Lord to worship and praise him praise the Lord you know uh I know we don't want to be uh unwise we don't want to provoke God just because he's given us promises that he'll protect us but um at the same time Solomon said uh uh the wicked sayth uh a lion is in the streets I'm not going out my house and uh it's only it's in his imagination right and he asse a lion is in the street so he's not going out well this is not an assumption a virus is out there and and we we know it's out there but we don't have to live in fear but at the same time we must use our wisdom right we it's as simple as that and and as it is a lot of people don't want to do it because they have their freedom and nobody can't tell them to do and I want want to thank God that there's a big difference between uh Canada and the United States in that part right that they just want their full freedom to do whatever they want to do and over um they talk about law and and and Order and that sort of stuff but they don't listen to the law and they don't have any order and here the people seem to be trained to obey the law and to to try to keep the the nation in order and regardless of all these parties and differences out there that has nothing to do with us right uh nothing whatsoever uh but the fact is we go by the law and we try to obate the best we can as a result we're not as such as a bad position as they there with all the craziness and stuff that's uh going on but thank God you know um um I was uh listening to them uh just before I came out they were talking about how this is affecting the the kids going to school and uh how they have to do a lot of online learning and while I'm listening to that then the holy spirit says yes that's Satan's attempt to ramp up selfishness isolation you take care of yourself your watch out for yourself and to bring out all kinds of things from inside of people and kids because of isolation so I'm just telling you so that you are warned against that and you don't think that oh I just take care of my family I just take care of myself I just protect myself and all like that because these things are designed by Satan he's changing the entire world system and he's trying to bring out uh uh all of these things from in the human heart that might have been hidden up all kinds of things coming out racism coming out oh you get quiet it's the truth it's starting to emerge these Monsters of evil starting to emerge praise God and we got to watch you may know in your head but you got to watch watch that not drawn into these kinds of things that spiritually you're not controlled by these kinds of things we are sons of the and Daughters of the Living God we are controlled by the Holy Spirit we are not supposed to be blind and say oh I didn't see it I don't know about it I know about it you know about it we all know about it but even though you see it and you know about it that is the the victory that you could see all these things going on around you but you're not part of it you're in the world but you're not of the world praise God you're under the control of the Holy Spirit of the Living God Amen and we pray that God will have his way in every possible way to keep every one of us because these things are swirling around you to see if it could carry away right it could carry your away on a flowery bed of ease and take you out so soft and simple that you carried away where you start regarding blood relations stronger than spiritual between you the and Brothers and Sisters in Christ we start to consider all these things so when you put it all together look to Jesus look away to the Lord let me tell you why do you think he said look except you see if the Lord hadn't elected there's not a one would be saved right for the whole Earth shall be deceived amen but for the elected if it were possible but it is not possible and it's not possible because we Are Spiritual or we pray more or we read the Bible more or anything like that but you have a anchor that was placed in you before the foundation of the world and you are you are kept by the power of God through Revelation through faith Hallelujah your anchor rests Beyond the Veil where the glories never fail Hallelujah to the lamb Hallelujah to the lamb praise be to God thank him for His Marvelous love and grace Brothers in these sisters in these Troublesome times dark chaotic times where all kinds of opinions and ideas are swirling all around we can keep ourselves anchored on the word of God hallelujah regardless of what's going on around us amen you'll find you get pulled this way in your flesh pulled that way pull that way that's just natural as human but spiritually you keep your eyes on Jesus keep your eyes on the word of God hallelujah we thank the Lord Jesus now for the past uh three weeks I've been trying to bring the message what have the seals done for us and I brought the message and you who are in here no doubt heard it but it seems like the Lord didn't want to allow it to go out everywhere so even though I'm on this uh uh on the internet where it could go all around the world for some reason it was hindered uh and if you listen to it you you could see my picture clear but the voice is all garbled and everything else like that you know the song service is fine everything is fine the minute I get up here and start it's gone right you see like that so so I want you to understand don't just look at these things and the devil is going to say oh this person didn't do that or I didn't do that or this one didn't do that and and and we start to but God allows sometimes these things you can have the best equipment in the world brand new and if he doesn't want it to work you waste the whole day and night here tling there tling there nothing work until he says so right so it's not just equipment or or or or looking at this person or that person or the other person no it's looking away like I said to Jesus of course we have to do our due diligence but the fact is it's looking to the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah so let's keep our eyes on Jesus regardless of what happens around us may the Lord bless you pray for me and I pray for you look we're in a war we're in a battle praise God virus this that that behind all of that is Satan the Puppet Master he's pulling all the strings so don't look at this individual thing that individual thing look who's behind the scenes and he would want to quiet everything down oh there is no Satan you're crazy to be talking about evil spirits in the modern day you know what kind listen friends I I I've prayed for people and cast out Devils from people that had a nicotine Spirit nicotine Spirit oh that's just a habit right well said oh that man Jesus said come out you dumb devil you deaf Spirit come he called some of those things devil right but when you call it that today you sound like you're out of your mind you're out of sync with things you're not modern you're oldfashioned those were the days of superstition it it doesn't happen anymore let me tell you they're right here they're right among us but they tried to make the people dumb down and think oh there is no devil there was no Satan it's just the virus science will take care of that and so on well I I don't want to go into that discussion science is are from the branch of the tree of Good and Evil so it does some good but while it's doing you some good it does all the evil at the same time and uh uh he uses all those things to try to hide behind the scenes and then commit all these crimes or these evils upon the human race you know and when I see sometimes some people passing by my house walking and they could barely walk walking it going like that and I sometimes I shake my head look what Satan has done to the human race that we have to come down to old age no matter who you are king or commoner you get to a point you start feeling pains here and aches there praise the Lord amen you start feeling it whether you like it or not because that's what sin did to the entire human race amen but thank God God Jesus came to reverse the curse and take us back and bring us back to the way we were in the beginning glory to God hallelujah praise God I would like for us to read out of the uh Gospel of Luke before we do that I I forgot one more thing here my mind going on the word now but um you see the pen I'm wearing here how many here see sees the pen I'm wearing here praise the Lord I want to thank the Lord for it and this pin was given to me by um a a kind of a disabled young man he has problems and after a service down in Las crusis uh New Mexico which is the next city near El Paso Texas is across the Texas border and uh after a service he came and gave it to me and I took it from him and thank him very much for it I love loved it I love it and it goes right in with what I'm talking now amen because it's not so much uh the prophet's picture but it's it's him right praise the Lord so we thank the Lord uh and so uh feeling LED um and the desire of a lot of of a few Believers that have mentioned it to me they'd like to get one of these pins praise the Lord would you like to get one of these pins or it's too much for you okay well I see about no well I see about 15 people only that really want them so I have 15 here uh why you laugh I there's 15 people rais their hand and I have 15 so I have to give it out to to the 15 people praise the Lord would you come brother brother and give it to the people um let's look at the end of the service uh because it you know it'll create fighting and I don't want that happen but praise the Lord anyway the Lord led us to have the one pin taken and then from it multiplied and uh thank God for his marvelous Wonderful Grace uh God used uh has used uh fantasy food markets uh brother Danny and sister Jennifer of course you know are the ones that um I ordered it and I'm I was prepared to have you know the church pay for it but the Lord laid their heart to uh take care of it they took care of it and I want them to be able to know that I appreciate it very much on behalf of the church and living God the Lord bless you and God bless everyone of you so at the end of the service the deacons are going to make sure that every man woman and child receive one of these thingss praise the Lord of course if you don't want it don't let press it on you you you don't have to take it but if you want one you can have one okay God bless you real good and uh what I just said that and then it said to me now you're going to say oh but my mother isn't here my cousin isn't here my uncle isn't here maybe I can have a five so I can give one to each of them no let them when they come themselves they'll get their own praise the name of the Lord so you don't take for everybody um that's um on your list because you can have a endless list uh right um that's not to say your nearest family right don't get me wrong I'm not talking about your nearest family like sister your husband isn't here but obviously you got to have one and other other people here that have near relatives that need to have one then you take one and we'll use some of the other pin that um you know if people online would like to have one then we'll share it with them by the grace of God praise the Lord God bless you real good let's all stand Luke chap 23 vers 32-43 amen hallelujah our gracious Heavenly Father the reading of your word gives us life the hearing of your word gives us life and we pray in the name of Jesus Christ that this little thought today that you'll expand it you'll grow it and you'll let it flourish within the hearts of the Saints and father may we rejoice in your presence as we give you glory honor and praise in Jesus name amen and amen may the Lord bless us all together today as we share this little thought praise God Hal Hallelujah now as the song said up calvary's Mountain one Dreadful morning went Jesus my Savior weary and worn wounded and bleeding for Sinners pleading blind and unheeding dying for me they took him up calvary's mountain and there they nailed him to a cross and Luke 23 says and there were also two other malactor criminals LED with him to be put to death and when they were come to the place which is called Calvary where they cruci there they crucified him and the M malefactors one on the right hand and the other on the left and Jesus said father forgive them for they know not what they do and his reignment and cast lots I'm going down to verse 39 you can read the rest later and one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him saying if thou be the Christ save thyself and us and the other answering rebuked him saying does thou not fear God what did he recognize seeing th art in the same condemnation and we indeed justly for we received the DU reward of our Deeds but this man had done nothing a miss and he said unto Jesus Lord wow that's a Jew and he's saying Lord you know when a Jewish person says that what they're meaning god Jehovah Elohim he he he he he his Revelation comes right out plain that he recognized in that instant last minute the countdown for this man was on that sentence already passed he's is finished he's about to die and there he says Lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom what a revelation he seen right from the cross right into Glory he says Lord remember me when you come into your kingdom and Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee today shalt thou be with me in Paradise praise the Lord please be seated Hallelujah now I happen to be uh talking with a brother and that is how this message or this Revelation or you want to just say it's a thought well that's fine uh came to me that this thief represents every one of us uh because we in the last Church age you know we we condemned we lost without him we're finished the countdown is already on the ages are passed and and and and there's no no other person that can save us or pull us out of this and here is this thief no judge nobody not pilot nobody at that point and he turns around and says Lord remember me and when I was telling the story to the brother then the holy spirit says yes that is the attribute of God in him calling for remembrance so that is what I want to talk about here today for a short while attribute of God calling for remembrance and so this thief with the seed the gene of God in him and feeling that he was forgotten not knowing that Jesus went to the Cross to to save redeem buy back people like him and that he was only the representation that just as much as he would cry out for remembrance that he only represented the entire human race that had a gene a life a germ of God in them that in their soul will be crying out to God and say Lord remember me remember me with all the problems and troubles swirling around we want to say Lord remember me don't forget me Lord amen fny cross me said Lord when on others thou were calling amen do not pass me by Brother BR said he has to pass your way all the other ages you called out to PR you called out a little flock amen and now the last Church age has is here upon us we're at the last minute now right now Lord remember us there's supposed to be a Rapture we're supposed to be going out of here Lord and when I go I want to go with you I don't want to walk to Jordan alone but I want to go with you and I cross over to the other side by the help of God and by the anointing of the Holy Spirit oh the attribute of God in him was calling out for remembrance and now we can stay on that and expand the thought follow it track it down but I'm thinking of the children of Abraham the children of Israel when God promised him oh after 400 years your children going to be in bondage they're going to be there in Egypt and then after the 400 years I'm going to bring them out by a mighty hand hallu hallelujah oh praise God now when we look in the Bible Exodus 2:23 to2 the Bible said the children of Israel groaning under the bondage of pharaoh and all the things that were put upon them groaning and crying out for Relief then the Bible says and then they Cried unto the Lord hallelujah and the Bible says and the Lord heard their cries the Lord remembered his promise that gave to Abraham and his seed forever oh praise God hallelujah every every attribute of God has a right to cry out Lord Remember Me Lord remember me praise God when Tears are Falling Down Lord remember me when there's struges all around remember me when I come to the river of Jordan Lord hallelujah Don't Forget Me Lord but remember me oh they cried to the Lord and the Lord heard the their cries because it was the attribute of Abraham in them that was crying out for remembrance glory to God hallelujah amen then I began also to think of Samson and I'm not dwelling on these individually because you know enough that you can go to your Bibles you can go to your sources and search out these things magnify and expand on them how that Samson as you know as a servant called by God to do the will and purpose of God and there he was in bondage bound made blind and there he is carrying out this great work of grinding meals oh my and the Bible tells us how he was blinded by this Harlot you think spiritually I I you know I just passed by that but he was blinded by this Harlot beautiful woman uh and and in you know he was attracted by her but the Harlot blinded him and we have another spiritual Harlot today according to Revelation 9 1819 in there but here he was was blinded by her doctrines and her teachings and her precepts and there he's by himself in the dark after she had him bound stripped everything taken away from him all every truth every Revelation from every age tripped away oh my and he's left in philistia my God and in the darkness of his dungeon and of his blindness he cried to the Lord and you know it he said Lord remember me remember your servant you'll find that in judges 16:28 he actually uses the word Lord remember me why it was an the attribute of God in him that knew that if God raised him up for a purpose and he hadn't yet finished or fulfilled that purpose then he got a right to cry out once more Lord once more father God hallelujah amen just like Abraham knew God gave him a son and then God said take the son and sacrifice him up on the mount and he says yes we're going to go and do it and then he tells the servants at the bottom of the mountain he says just wait here I and the lad will go and return amen hallelujah why he knew says I give you a son and he's going to be your Heir that's going to do this this this that and he hadn't done it yet so what's the difference to me whether God want me to sacrifice him and you raise him up whether what God do whatever the matter I coming back with a son I don't care what the situation is I am coming back with my son hallelujah praise God Amen so don't look at what's going on around you what this one is saying that one is saying all the circumstances keep your eyes on the promise Look Away to Jesus keep your eyes on the word of God and don't be swayed this way or that way God gave a promise for this age and we are resting on that glory to God hallelujah it's got to be fulfilled and the Fulfillment of it is complete when you're going to Rapture Hallelujah when you're physically taken out of here praise the Lord and so he says Lord remember me oh praise God I want in my heart to thank him that he remembered me and that is why he could come and reveal his word that I might Know Who I Am Lord who I am I can see now who I am I'm a part of that Revelation that I'm talking about I'm talking about it and I am part of it I'm part of that word glory to God Paul said if the princes of this world

not know is that the word was in the word praise God hallelujah amen amen thanks be to God I give him glory amen and while praying over these things talking with the Lord the Holy Spirit and I just wrote it down you were once sealed in the thoughts of God are now revealed and manifested as words made flesh Hallelujah by now I'm putting my thought here by his spoken word we know what he was thinking amen by his spoken word we know who he was thinking of Amen indeed the spoken word is the original thought the spoken word is the Original Seed and that spoken word when it's manifested is the original thought of God now expressed upon the face of the Earth we want to give God praise and thank him and give him glory amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah so here we are as the Bride of Jesus Christ in this last Church age just before they going away to our destiny praise the Lord that we give him glory and praise now in the Easter seal you know this Eagle Story one day this Eagle

praise God I'm glad I'm a part of the prophecy I'm glad that I am a part of that or it fit him like a hand to a glove and somehow he knew that was his mother glory to God brother Bram said I heard the voice and from that day I knew Charles and Ella branam were not my real mother and father my father was Jehovah God hallelujah and I said father I'm coming home to you and the Bible become a new Bible to me oh praise God the word start to open and reveal itself and the Bible became a new Bible oh my praise God you're reading the same things you're read before but then boom like a Roman Candle like

to tell tell you but I know that I know that I know I know that I know that I know I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day glory to God hallelujah amen see he knew that was his mother and she knew that this was her son how she knew his reaction to her scream our reaction to his word action for reaction to the word of the Living God hallelujah oh my praise His name see she was looking for him and so has God listen to this in every age ordained his people his church for that age a message Goes Forth for that age then they could have all the laws anything they want to put up there but when that hour comes the holy spirit of God which was at the beginning amen he was there at the beginning amen praise the Lord amen see thought of you unspoken get out for that age then the spirit hunts for that egg Hallelujah see when he hears that message when that egg when he hears that message there is no church no denomination going to hold him it'll rise up to the heights it's got to because it was a different word it's a different creature he an eagle and you'll hear the scream my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow praise be to God hallelujah oh my no matter how loyal the church has been no matter how much a big name that church has got when my sheep hear my voice which is the word a stranger they will follow no

asking you are you magnetized by the word of God I don't know but I magnetized to the word he said one time going through a factory and I noticed at the end of the shift instead of them taking brooms and trying to sweep up things he said he noticed something come down from the ceiling and when it did like that all the filings went and went right up and grab a hole on that he said it was a great magnet in the sky that came down and once it came down it pulled all those steel filin that had the same properties it pulled it and magnetized it to itself amen oh my thank God for that seed Gene within my soul thank God Hallelujah that I'm a part of him thank God that we're part of the word because when the word comes down for the word then the word goes up to meet him in the sky we'll meet the Lord in the air amen I said we'll meet him in the air brother glory to God there's going to be a meeting by and by hallelujah oh praise God Amen see there it's like a magnet what does it do then then this Earthly body is now quickened and brought by that quickening Spirit to an Obedience of God's word amen hallelujah because what they come and they receive the headship and the headship

amen and the whole body life begins to flow through the entire body amen praise be to God hallelujah oh friends do you understand this Holy Spirit represented as an eagle flying over the land to find the believer no man can come to me no man can come to me when he wants to all the father has given me will come to me but no man can just come by himself it isn't your own thinking it isn't your own drawing it is not your pulling it's God drawing God pulling all the father has given me will come to me how many in their hair believes that say loud amen say loud amen do you really believe this praise be the God hallelujah let's give the Lord praise and glory here [Applause] today now that same great holy spirit is now here on the earth and he's looking for those individuals not churches not groups not anything of that nature but he's searching for those individuals that God has ordained to life in in this age and as soon as he finds it it does just like it did on Jesus Christ the super Son of God who redeemed us all it comes down then and takes its aboad into to that human life now notice it comes down and brings in the quickening power Hallelujah now that quickening power that come upon Jesus quickened him to manifest every promise of the word for that day and the same quickening power comes on you by the opening of The Eyes of your heart to manifest every word for this day he had a he had a name to declare Oh my he had a promise a word to manifest amen and he had a mission to die praise God but ours is not to go and die to flesh Dying In the Flesh we we died to the flesh but we Resurrected we got that promise that we will go in the Rapture praise God hallelujah now we see so does the Holy Spirit come upon us in this day and it's not some mockery holy spirit amen see some Holy Spirit Some Devil Spirit getting in the midst and mocking the real Holy Spirit oh I recognize that many years ago that that many times some of these religious outbursts and things going on people say oh that's the Holy Ghost oh that and it's nothing but a devil under the guise of the Holy Spirit mocking at the real holy spirit amen but I'm talking about the real true holy spirit that will manifest the word for the hour through you amen praise the Lord Lord listen it it fell upon Luther and through him it manifested the promise of that hour when it fell upon Wesley he manifested the promise of that hour and when it falls in this day it manifests the promise of this hour just like it did with Moses upon Noah it manifest the promise of that hour Hallelujah it falls upon us we will manifest the promise of this day praise God think about it it's not by works it's nothing working yourself up but God in you begins to manifest the promise of the hour you've got to keep on walking just keep right on walking walking in the light of the Lord you'll get to him and someday if you walk the right way walking in the light of the Lord all you got to do is keep on walking keep your eyes on Jesus and keep walking don't keep don't stop until he tells you brother BR said Lord I'm kind of tired now I've been walking a long time I don't see the vision manifest he said keep walking he said oh but turn the street why do I have to turn here you don't worry why I tell you to turn just keep walking amen and you know he kept on walking and then he saw the vision manifested for him there was the woman leaning over the fence praise God and then the Deep called back to the Deep by saying good morning Parson how you know I'm a Parson she says because before you come here I saw you I had a dream that I saw you and you had a brown Briefcase by the way where is the briefcase you said I left it in the hotel room Oh Glory to God hallelujah amen praise God praise God the fullness of the word of the Living God Amen yes marvelous think about it friends this Holy Spirit come down to Quicken to make alive those people that were ordained of God in this hour it's come to Quicken them to be in the Rapture praise God so why is the holy spirit here now to make you speak in down the holy spirit is here to make you run the floors the holy spirit is here to do something no healing all those things those are minors the major now is being in the Rapture amen hallelujah oh I'll see you in the Rapture I trust I'll see you there because I'll be in the Rapture Oh Glory to God I believe it you oh you're you're this you're that oh I know it praise God hallelujah so he is here now he's coming down to Quicken to make alive those people that's were ordained of God to be in that the Rapture that it is that is if that individual is is a true Eagle then if he is he will understand the message of this hour if he's a true Eagle now that little Eagle probably in the barnyard was eating all right but he know something wasn't just exactly right but when he heard the truth then he received that truth John 14 52 4 rather Jesus saying he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me had everlasting life and shall not come into judgment but is pass from Death unto life just think how simple that is he that believeth amen the correct way of saying that is he that understandeth amen he that understandeth my words amen he had everlasting life praise God you have everlasting life I said you have everlasting life see you have everlasting life it's in you now praise God everlasting life eternal life then you had no beginning then you have you have no ending praise God no matter what happens you there's no end to you praise the Lord because you're a part of him now revealed in temporary flesh that going to pass away but you will live forever because Christ in you your hope of glory amen glory to God amen amen amen hallelujah oh my let me give you one more quotation you can follow up all these things now the rising of the Sun God knows that he has got a predestinated for ordained church and he knows that he's got sons and daughters in there he knows that a bride is there waiting she's there waiting and so then the Holy Spirit flies over it see that Holy Spirit then he says that wave sheath flies over it oh my my my he's the same yesterday today and forever he is not not a mythical story but he is a living reality amen hallelujah oh praise God lot of people out there following a lot of religious mythology that's not even in the word not even part of the word amen and others are taking and parsing and analyzing and debating the message of this day even which is Satan's strategy to confuse things and create chaos but thank God if you got your your eyes the prize the word of God hallelujah you'll keep your eyes on the wave sheath oh my then the real Eagle recognizes the call of God's word why does he recognize it he is an eagle to begin with and so the Great Eagle calls to the eagle and that word that was there before the foundation of the world calls out out to the word of the hour word of the hour Hallelujah you're in this age you're in this day and that word from before the foundations calls out to the word hour the Deep calls to the deep and the Deep response Oh Glory to God hallelujah amen praise God Amen the word predestinated to the word written for the hour you realize your position amen you see he hunted for it hunts for it but praise God go right away once the word revealed to you you realize your position you're part you're the bride you're part of the bride and if you're part of the Bride you're right realize your position and it's simple your position is to be his help meet your position is to be right right by his side as we say foot to foot every step he takes you stepping right into his Footprints your position is to be right by his side and I'm siding with the word I said I'm siding with the word I said I'm voting for the word I'm making him president of my life I'm making him king of my life I crown him now thine shall the glory Glory Be oh praise God forever more a crown him king of all Worthy is the Lamb that was slain from before the foundation of the world oh think of this thief Lord remember me why why remember me you think God is going to forget do do you think God will change his mind about his word you think he's going to say oh this guy Emmanuel here you know I I think he made too many mistakes so I'm going to leave him out of the book no God never changes his mind about his word is that right heavens and earth will pass away but my word written spoken manifested revealed shall never ever pass away because it's all one and the same word of God hallelujah can't pass away amen you don't have to reason it think about it wonder how it's going to happen this that that's none of my concern I'm resting on Jesus I'm resting on the word of God for this hour and for this day blessed be his holy precious name amen glory to God and to I'm not going to even talk about spiritual Amnesia and all of that but you you you just follow this up but listen to him now he's trying to get them to understand who he is H Nathaniel starts to walk towards him he said oh he said you are the son of so and so your your name is Nathaniel he said Lord when did you know me amen listen before philli called you Philip didn't even call you yet but I knew you amen glory to God hallelujah oh my my my he he knew one of his attributes was there and he remember and pass by and he has to pass your way if you're an attribute of the Living God Amen because he's searching for his attributes right now he's the Great Eagle is passing over to pull out his attributes for this day and for this hour Oh My My My follow that up how many other people like that when he was raised up and Mary came to the tomb and the angels the angel even spoke to her and said the Lord is not here it is the rising of the sun hallelujah oh but even that was good but the Bible says but Jesus himself appeared and all he said was Mary he knows your name I said he knows your name not just your natural name but he knows your name he knows where you come from who you are before you were in your mother's belly I knew you and I called you to be a prophet oh praise God you must prophesy again to the wind glory to God hallelujah amen amen amen you'll find that he did that to his attributes through the entire thing right down to Paul no matter what the devil tried to buar you with dirt with filth with bad reputation with this that the other tried to bury you but God promised a resurrection when he called you'll answer amen that's why you're here today you answer his call you're here because of the power of God to transform and change a life and change CH it forever and ever for his glory amen God never forgets his own amen oh my and then that dying Thief rejoiced why did he Rejoice to see he rejoiced to see that fountain in his day oh my I seen the fountain it's it's a fountain of Revelation it's a Fountain of Life and of truth but that dying Thief Rejoice to see the fountain in his

let me close with this thought uh before I came out I was reading brother Bram just telling them in experiences I think it's called experiences 1948 somewhere like that telling them about how he had this vision of a baby being healed and so on and he went to the home to pray for the child it was inable and when he went in to pray for the child he prayed for it the child didn't get better and he said oh Lord what what what then the holy spirit says no you didn't wait you remember in the vision the grandmother is supposed to come in and she's supposed to sit on four fold and have a certain color of sweater on when you see that then you pray and all will be well and he repented and he had to go back to the people in there ashamed and said Brethren I'm sorry I was wrong I repent and he told them that he made a mistake he didn't give them all this detail at that time that came after when he gave his testimony but he said I made a huge mistake he said if you will have patience with me do you still believe me uh to be his servant and that what he tells me is the truth he said when I said that I felt like someone was standing over my right shoulder amen Oh my he said I knew he was right there I said bring the child they brought the child to him and while bringing the child to him he said I looked through the window I saw a woman walking he says walking and she came to the door opened it and came in I everybody L and that walked over she sat down in that door fold with her Satchel her back in her hand and she had the righted color of sweater on oh my tell me would you been confident would you have had Faith wouldn't you know for sure he said and I took that child I pray for the child in the name of Jesus praise God and said in three days he'll be made completely whole he says in three days while I'm praying again the holy spirit says when you go back that baby will be so wellet so whole he's going to come and say brother brandham look at me I am completely whole so brother brandham said I'm so confident now I tell the whole church so he said when I'm going back the whole church allow me to go in and then they come up with the cars and then creep up to the house he says the jam peering into all those windows and everything else he said and the mother was baking and something and she gave them a cookie and he had a chocolate milk and he drank it and the milk had mustaches the prophet said on him and he said oh brother Bram he says look at me I'm completely whole he said you should see people start to run all kinds of stuff start happening because there was a fulfillment of the vision praise God [Applause] hallelujah we are just in the middle of the Fulfillment of this vision friends sodomite conditions are here all the condition spoken of by Jesus is here oh glory to God and thank God he remembered Abraham and thank God now in this hour he remembers Abraham's seed and God's attributes calling for remembrance and God has heard and has come to
