possible all your needs to be met if you believe there's nothing I myself can do but if that can't believe we have a God here his name is the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he answers all our needs hey man let's give you Applause praise God without wasting my time I'm gonna go to my scriptures right away today's Bible studies I'm going to read a couple of scriptures just bear with me John chapter 10 verse 27 to 30. I have John 15 16 20. and second Timothy 4 17. okay if you guys say Amen my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish nether shall any man plug them out of my hand My Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to plug them out of my father's hand I and my father are one in other words we are God you are in God's hand no one can plug you up from his hand even and John 16 16. ye have not chosen me but I have trust in you and ordain you that you you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever he shall ask the father in my name he may give it to you these things I command you that you love one another if the word hates you you know that he hated me before he hated you if you are of the world the world will love his own but because you are not of the world but I have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hated you remember this word that I said unto you the servant is no greater than his Lord if they have persecuted me they will also persecute you if they have kept my saying they will keep yours also and my last scripture will be First Timothy second Timothy chapter 4 verse 7 to 10 then we pray in second Timothy chapter for if you have a time read the whole chapter of second Timothy chapter four I have fought a good fight have finished my course have kept my the faith hence for this laid up before me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at the at that day and not to me only but unto all that them also that love his appearing do thy diligence to come shortly unto me for demons had forsaken me having love this present world and is departed unto thessalonica christended Galicia only Luke is with me take Mark and bring him with thee for his profitable to me for the ministry let's pray who are gracious Eternal God may you bless the rhythm of the word father if I have done anything wrong may you please forgive me if they still don't believe we cast it out in Jesus name may you come and please take me aside and help me to say the right way to bless your bride we thank you we come against anything unlike Christ May the spirit of Christ take absolute control for the remainder of the service and bless everyone here in Jesus name amen please be seated there are so many things in the scriptures that you read that um I don't know if you where to start but as the Bible said that I have you in the hand I I have you in in my hand and no one can plug you out of my hand I was driving and what I was listening when he was talking about his two daughters when one of them said that I got all of daddy and he said that Daddy have got all of you so it's not how much you think you have God but how much God has you if that Living God have you in the palm of his hand then you are so certain that no one can plug out from his hand it doesn't matter what you go through doesn't matter your persecution whatever happens to you once God have you understand no I said my sheep hear my voice a stranger they will not follow because the seed of God dwell inside of you there's no one it doesn't matter what comes your way no matter what persecution trust whatever nothing can plug you out from his hand because he is holding you it's not you holding on to him if you are also pastor always tells us when a child is holding on to the mother's side hand she can just slip away if that mother is holding that child's hand and they're crossing the road there's no way that child can sleep and go anywhere so how much God is holding on to you it all comes back to the seed because all about predestination is that I chose you you didn't choose me so if God chose you then he didn't chose you when you came on the altar before the foundation of this world you were in his mind before everything was created so it wasn't here that he chose to so if God has chosen you and you are one of his chosen look that a movie chosen nothing can well take you away from him because it's not you and that choice is is not because God love um brother Glenn and hate in hate this or that because him being God he know our choices so before even said Jacob and his son were born he said Jacob have I laughed he saw have I hated they were not even born but he being God he knew their choices that they were going to make and Esau made a choice based on his stomach I thought I call it that belly Christians they didn't make he didn't make a choice based on the word of God I think I've been ahead of myself but actually because so many people made choices based on only job but if God has called you to be a Christian and bless you in a certain Ministry and if you know that God has placed you there your choices should be based on his red face not just because of only work because if God placed you under that Ministry his under obligation to provide your needs the moment that Abraham left where God has placed him he was always having trouble so any time that you let prayer God has ordained you to place you you live there you are in trouble because so many people they ignore a lot of warnings God sometimes put a stumbling block doing everything but because they have made their mind up just like um because his mind is full made up no matter what Trap God is putting his way he just gonna ignore it and later when they get in trouble then they want you to build them out I was talking to one brother lasting that so many people they made choices and you advise them they don't listen to you and they get themselves in trouble then they want you to come and build them out of that trouble you made that choice you have to be responsible for your choices you don't expect me to come when there was God made a provided way to make things right and you ignore the one you ignore the advice you ignore everything you went your own way then you are in big trouble then you calling me come and help me out of this whole it isn't going to happen you have to be responsible for your choices amen and the choices that lead the people to their final destination because remember that we are here we have five senses we contact our five senses in the three-dimensional world and that dimenses the matter time and at a matter time and Light so you contact that Dimension with ah five senses see taste smell and all that but there is a super sense which is Faith it doesn't it doesn't based on things that you see or taste or feel and in the Bible everyone that has ever pleased God they make it by faith by faith Abraham by faith enough by faith Elijah by all by faith and it's a revelation because without faith is impossible to please God and Faith doesn't look at things that you naturally see it doesn't look at things that you feel it doesn't look at how the doctor is telling you that your head is Carrying Your Destiny or that it looks beyond that it obeys God's word and God's word is the will of God and every faith has to line up the word of God if anything doesn't line up with this word of God get rid of it don't entertain it and fed up with people telling me I have this Vision I have this better check what they are saying doesn't line up with this word of God and we have to run away from it because everything has to come back to this that's our problem line that's our absolute absolute instead of man is this word of God we best our decisions actions on this word of God and if anything is contrary to it get rid of it don't entertain it amen don't tell me I have this picture I have this no that prophets whatever it has to line up with those words it has to be blessed alone amen praise God and as we know that fourth dimension Express scientists go and they capture the camera uh wave and all those things but from the fourth dimension The Fifth Dimension we swear the people who did not live for God sinners could not repent that's right that means they are because it's just like a nightmare it's like they are you are not fully awake you are not fully sleeping that's where they are those people because your work on this Earth is finished you can't go to the presence of God if you are a sinner but you can also not come back to this world because God has finished with you and it's a terrible place that's how the prophet said that you don't even want your worst enemy to be in that place but the sense of God God's word that sixth Dimension they are in the presence of God Amen that's the dimensions that they hear and they are resting they are the souls on the Altar and the last Dimensions where God himself forth is reciting so all I'm saying is that God has given us choices he's given us Grace and that Grace that God has given you it has a boundaries Once you walk around that boundaries you are free as someone always tells us that when the horse racing you have to that horse has to be in the boundaries of the lane if that horse can raise pain if not in that name they're gonna disqualify him so the grace abounds but that Grace has boundaries amen so all that I'm saying I got to that Festival second Timothy um chapter 4 verse 7 to 10 because I happen to be in a wedding this Saturday and in that wedding I end up sitting with a man I know that he was even a minister whilst we were talking he told Mr minister of the Gospel he had 100 people under his ministry so we are talking talking and then asking have we heard about a man called William Maron Branham he said oh I've read about God's General and right away I knew because that God's General when I was like two years in the message I met an uncle here I didn't even know him Ghana and I was so excited to tell me about the word of God for our age and God has sent us the prophet and the man was so bored and angry say my niece my nephew are lost you follow This brilliant Marion Brown go and read God's General so right away I bought that book and I read it and whilst I was reading that book I realized that they take Brown Bram out of contest and put this and put this and they said that he endorsed polygamy and I have read and from um question and answers that even his own son Billy Paul he wouldn't even marry him because he said that he had promised a Catholic girl and you even married him so writer says just false I just throw it somewhere so I told him that brother search for yourself go and get his book and read it don't base it on this God's General and I explained to him I was even blessed by started that they said that he drifted at the end of his ministry that's all they saying that God's General now I was telling him that he's not drifted he was forsaken just like the Lord Jesus Christ in his first pool when he was a young man in one and a half years he was Healing The Sick raising the dead Rabbi everybody was praising him but one day he said John 6 says things he said except you eat of My Flesh drink of my blood you have no path in me and that the all the Bible said they walk with him no more when he started what his Doctrine then he went back and said that even the son of man who is timing here now in heaven and then that was too much for them it was left it only was 12 and one of them also a devil and it was even far beyond that from there it wasn't long that they crucified him and the god of hosts Heaven that created heaven and earth and he looked like he was Masha because they spit on him they put this on his throne they did everything to him and even the moon stopped on him the Earth everything first took him even all disciples except John that was there at the last minute and everybody thought that was the end of him but that was a crowning of his ministry and he came back he got resurrected him on Easter day and when he was resurrected that was there was crowning of his ministry and he said that because I leave you shall also with God that he lives in us forever because he does not Calvary there was not going to be Resurrection you will never be you never go got a victory unless you go through the fall the Hall of critics you have to be criticized you have to be forsaken you have to be rejected all those things are part of Christian work but in the end if you stay through the word of God he will Crown you because it's the same yesterday today and forever amen and I trust trust me Paul also went through the same thing that's why you read from second Timothy here Dimas was a rich young man that Paul converted him but he went to a got to a place you have a lot of demons here do Braden what was happening is that he was looking at Paul because we checked the Bible said that even the shadows of Paul and Peter was casting out devils and he couldn't differentiate between the man Paul and the spirit behind Paul operating so he just look at man Paul demons falling away from him Paul Casino devils raising the dead healing their sick doing all kind of Ministries everything going on fire dancing of Paul and then he realized that a copasmate blind people blind eh then he saw copper Smith put Paul in prison and Paul couldn't say nothing and Paul was even telling Timothy to beware of him and then Paul having all this eye problem and he sought God and God said that my grace is sufficient and Paul said I will work suffer in my infirmities but they must think that Paul is the one that has the power he forgot that it was God that was operating in power and God can choose to heal today live this today is whether I do not unless I see what my father was shows me first so the minister Pastor Samurai then they can't do anything until God tells them what to do so you don't look at them and say oh they didn't come and visit me they didn't do this they did this and you blame them you blaming yourself because you're looking at wrong you're looking wrong if you want to find your fault you're gonna have a lot of force to find I think that was what demons was looking at because he was looking at Paul being so Pious and then now he can't do nothing he was Masha but listen it wasn't Paul it was Christ and Paul it was never something that can pick up a Jawbone and kill a thousand people it was spirit of God in Samson that does that it wasn't David it's a young man 10 15 16 17 years old can pick up this and get rid of Goliath how can he do that it's because God in David so the people forget who is behind it God is telling us not to look at the flesh look at the Spirit behind that flesh what is operating behind it if it is me I'll bear record of that I will vindicate it if it's God behind that thing he will Vindicated but not what people expect because when people they look only at the flesh they only look at the mistakes they only look at this oh he's off he's mashup no it's the crime of their ministry that's why if you read in feasibility power says that I am willing see if I can read that scripture again he said that where is your Victory because what he was what he was happy for being going that that place let me see what he said over here exactly I think I forgot exactly oh oh okay that's fine oh Dad where is that I think oh grave where is that Victory because he was ready and prepared to face the death because he knew it was crowning of his ministry and the Lord Jesus Christ had the crown of his ministry too and we can talk about the Daniel Cedric music Abednego they all came to that place Daniel was rejected by everybody he was forsaken and when that forsaken came they thought that was the end of Daniel and in Lion's Den but in that I understand that's where he has the Victory and after that the king what raise Daniela and said Daniel God is God and made a proclamation in the whole country that they should all worship Daniel's God because he is a true God so it's not the end of the people when the world call it their end it's not the end of God's children when they are being forsaken by the world Amen so let me read this before um I continue if you read before 1963 Brad Brown was all talking about the demons he left and be a Christian a gentleman God was separating him from Paul but if you read the state 30123 he said all with Paul when the popular world Grace paragraph 215223 or with Paul when the popular world loving Demas forsake Him for his Christian so-called breeding of their popular opinion when Paul stood on the word they must left him loving this present World let him because that he was true to the word it was too straight for him who was God with Dimas or will you go with Paul check the word what side will you take in your present State at that time yet them was professed Christians Paul said all men has forsaken me poor little guy always was Allah my doctor Edinburgh I said you know when I get up to heaven first thing I'm going to do I said what is it by the end he said I'm going to go right up to dim us and slap him the face as hard as I can I said now Eric is that I'm going to say why did you leave Paul down there like that I said you really think he'll be there Aaron I said be careful of your desires to slap him in the face ah I said I would want to be where he was at maybe she had to do with that like the Infidel said to the little girl he said you that believe the Bible says sure said I guess you believe that story about Jonas the whale swallowing up Jonah she says certainly said how are you going to prove it otherwise by faith said when I got to Heaven I'll ask Jonah that's right said what if Jonah is in there said then you will ask him so I guess that status and see yesterday he would have to ask him so you see then that settless it I believe then if he forsook Paul and forsook the word he done the same thing Judas did yes sir what side will you take in that place now listen Pentecostal what side will you take I've been wrecking this praise there and so forth now what will you take what side will you take there so it is very very important because in the church not the bride Brown said that life is choices you have to you can choose your education you can choose um your wife or whatever it is and you can choose your churches he said don't choose your church the way you choose your wife because churches have spirits so if God by Sovereign Grace revealed to you a Ministry that you have to be under don't make mistakes and criticize when you don't see things going on your way if God has revealed to you then you have to follow because just like look look saw the same thing Dimas was looking but everybody for soup poor but look stay true to Paul so it is a true man of God if God has revealed to you a Ministry to be under you have to stay true to that man to that word of God because if God if you are saying it it's your testimony that God has revealed this to me and if God has revealed you'll go back and change his way so you have to have confidence and stay behind that Ministry and support it around so you got to support it with all your mind all your soul everything behind and if you see you meet all those criticizing people you have to chop your head off defend your pastor defend the ministry don't let somebody come just like David when that man was speaking at this person who you allowed this with you then let me cut his head off from here you see what I mean he was faithful to David so God is trying to tell us to be faithful don't be like demons you don't want demonstrate in this church it criticized it only look at the person without looking at the Spirit behind operating because it's God operating and God can change things at any time he's a sovereign God he does what he wants to do so I know they just have to write amen because if you think about you're gonna go crazy brother Billy Paul was saying that one time two people came with Abraham would identify the same question he gave somebody permission to do it he didn't allow someone to do it is God is sovereign we don't follow people you follow Christ and we are different it comes back to me one time I went to one brother we are fellowshipping and he was bringing himself down because the angel of God told by Abraham to be more sincere yes that was The Measure of Faith according to Abraham's level so God gave it according the measure award faith and Grace so you have to be sincere according to your level you don't look at him as or even if all this God wants him to be faithful but God wants you to be a sincere in The Measure of Faith according to your level because give us a prophet so he was raised up that you are not a prophet so you are sincer maybe God is requiring from you it's not the same as he was requiring from the prophet of God but you have to be sincere because the scripture said that in last was a man's subject to like passion like we are but he was he prayed endlessly very sincerely and rain did not he set up Rain and also prayed and gained and what rain came so if Elijah was the man that have ups and downs but if you prayed endlessly and God answered the prayer the same God is here tonight whatever you have made of tonight you can right now sincerely ask God in your heart and I believe that same God that Elijah prayed to that same God is here tonight he will answer your need he will give you the desires of your heart hey thou can't believe if there is no doubt in your heart and say to this man to be die removed it will remove because you believe it there's if there's no doubt if you believe with all your heart and you are endlessly asking God he's more than able to what give you the desires of your heart and another person that also people thought that your Smasher Was Elijah it all goes back to God's sovereignty because Elijah shut up Heavens he didn't rain any rain he killed all those build prophets he said the god that let the fire comes let him be the God and their God they did all things they do everything Pampanga nothing happened but in the cool of the evening he called the names according to my word and father came and he got rid of he cut all those people's heart head off but when Jezebel that little woman was after him he ran for his life because why Elijah has no power on his own to make decisions God has to what inspired him and let him do what he was doing so at that time it was like his ministry was he and he went so down that he thought that everybody has forsaken God and only him was serving God and God has to tell me I have seven thousand worshiping in Elijah's street that was what like the end of his Minister he was forsaken the one thing you know after the Forsaken after all they left him God let what um the bed bring food to feed him after all that he led charot carry him for rest Elijah walked Enoch walk and walk with God and let very well they sorrowed took Elijah that was a crowning of his ministry so it's really the bride of Christ is the same God how many sins God call us how many people have come to this Zone left sometimes you talk to people and the things that they see that they're living and you wonder my goodness things that they say can never even cross your mind and they're based on little be returns and they left and they're gone by what the my spirit but what I'm right trying to say we're heading towards what we are inward towards the consummation the World Council of churches has done and the whole church is the whole the Christian World they have United already but that unification that God is talking about is not what they are doing because the Baptists have their Doctrine Pentecost have their Doctrine everybody have their Doctrine but they all compromise on their doctrines to be one but that Oneness is not what God is talking about that Oneness is God coming into you dwelling you as my father was the one he is one with the individual so God being one with the bride is that true Oneness that he was talking about and when you truly become one with God and God has fully dwell inside of you this world will hate you as well said they hate me if they hate me they will hate you they will not love you but you have to move on with your life because it's forsaking times that there has to be a falling away first then before everything will come so people are Falling Away left and right but what do you think is keeping you is the grace of God it comes back to the seed something keep on holding me is what God himself holding you protecting his attributes protecting himself through you because it's part of God in you that's why the scripture says that even if your heart condemns you God is greater than your heart and the Son of God cannot even what sin because the spirit of God dwelt in him you are part of him you are part of his attributes so you not hold anything against that attribute amen so is going home time and don't be don't let it become strange when you see all those things going on and then begin to reject and forsake us we are not gonna go down they can close this up but we are going up they can close they said they are growing up time because they're gonna be our what I have Triumph time it's our victories is the time of God vindicating the bride of Christ because in the time of Paul and the rest dying for getting themselves to be killed was their victory was their promise for that day that's why Paul because he was there and considered them to kill Stephen he also got to a place that he was willing to give his life to be killed to be to be cut off and all those things because that's why I said that's why it's your your Victory great voice of Victory he was willing at that time to give his life but we are not going to another promise for us our promise is a Rapture which is being process now leading to an event so that Rapture is in process amen so that's our promise and that promise the fact that we are going to be raptured will vindicate our ministry who prove that what we said was truth the whole world can forsake as the whole world can start us and say we have Brahma how much we are this we are that we don't care because God is there to vindicate the ministry by rapturing Faith by wrapped by rapturedness The Rapture first is going as in process that same God is here the rejected they thought that you are smashed up they thought that he oh he was gone when he began to preach and tell that woman should not preach women should stop a woman not to preach or to stop authority over the man for the woman being deceived foreign but God proved that he was The Prophet by revealing the sins through him something that was hidden John was tough was not allowed to speak about it Daniel was forbidden to talk about it God revealing to himself and the Savages came in construction cutting up and vindicating and prove that he was with him that was his Triumph time to prove the word that he was that prophet of God and that same God is here with us tonight he will vindicate us he'll vindicate our ministry he is the same yesterday to them forever if he caught up in lie down up you're gonna cut us up because the lights are gone where is the god of Elijah that's what the bride is crying we're not worshiping his life a very crying for the god of Elijah Elijah God the same God that took Elijah on terror that same God one of these civilians one of these parties will be caught up and meet up with him in the air I believe that with all my heart with everything within me that one of these days rather you're gonna have got up amen the whole world is proving that that time is coming everything Vindicated at that time is that handy there is nothing that can stop us from coming even the people in the way they can feel it they can see the things that is happening oh man that's the Bible says it was a yes revealed in the bright form amen that is going on has been revealed Enterprise form in many many member bodies that same God is here amen he's vindicating free black coffee that is with us man he's gonna vindicate us he's gonna prove to the world there's a people understand that will not see that amen we are wearing a million hallelujah how great our God is our God is wonderful our life with all my heart he's the same yesterday to them forever amen what can separate me from the love of God is that persecution no nothing one can separate me from the love of God oh nothing nothing in this world

something here hallelujah praise the wonderful God is so good I'm gonna just run up right away and just run it up by just reading just one could okay this is the one that I was trying to talk about the same thing Paul the same thing Paul he said oh they must as forsake give me all men forsaking me for the word I don't believe they must went to night clubs and things but this must wanted to go Dimas was a rich man he wanted to give goal with a popular group and so he went off there where all the rest of them did and then posted all men has forsaken me why his ministry he was coming to the Capstone of eight coming down to the end his desire was that's what I was trying to his desire was to be a mightier because he had killed Stephen he witnessed his death and sanctioned it he wanted to die when the agabus that noted Prophet stood by him and told him not to go up to Jerusalem he said I know not to go but I'm not only willing to go to go and change and bound to Jerusalem but I'm ready to go and die for the Lord Jesus what was it he was sealing his ministry amen he was willing to die for Jesus are you willing to give your all to the Lord Jesus Christ the mic I'm just going to run up very soon are you willing to give everything to him as Paul was willing to give all to him Moses was the one became a prisoner to Christ he gave All to Jesus Christ and that is the absolute you can't have it any other way if they give all their all before they get in we have to give all our all before we get in you have a lot of Damascus because Moses was someone that God used him to do what 10 place they all witnessed that but when he got to the rest they were asked what were complaining they forgot all that God did all the Miracles everything they forgot it and they began to complain that God came back and Vindicated his servant Moses now it wasn't Moses who was doing that but God was behind that screen that was what daytime and Korah forgot they think that God can also speak to them because even this message has become what we called it's been prayed for all so everybody can pick up and do this and argue and that and it has a message inflated a lot of faith ministers who are not called even to be on the puppet but they are preaching because they think that they can intellectually analyze it and what bring it down preach but this is not intellectual this is God himself if God hasn't called you step there you're a dead man that same God is here that current daytime spirit because Moses God allow him to let his Spirit go on those 70 people they think they like Moses so they were challenging Moses and God said separate me from them and one night the Earth opening swallowed all those criticized people so I encourage you people if from today onwards it goes even on the on the air if anything is going on I'm not 100 sure don't criticize it if you don't know brother I'm saying just keep your mouths shout and God will vindicate and make it claim it's better you keep quiet and follow than to criticize and get yourself in trouble that's what I have for tonight let's be careful words that we speak and stand behind what God has given to you and that's our pastor is changing to brother I encourage everyone to behind dining as the rest supporting our pastor that's why I'll see you tonight amen I'm done thank you [Applause] amen all right let's stand just uh struck me there that he's going to vindicate the Bride of Jesus Christ to this world but before he does that he vindicates to you Who You Are right Moses and all those guys everybody he named he named I don't know how many but they all knew who they were because God Vindicated to them who they who they were and who it was that was moving behind him amen and I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them that's as simple as it gets for me amen I'm one of them I'm one of them oh I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them I'm one of them oh I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them all these people may
