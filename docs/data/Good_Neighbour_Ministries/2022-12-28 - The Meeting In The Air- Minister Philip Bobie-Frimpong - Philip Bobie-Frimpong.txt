away and so Wednesday I think the last Wednesday for the year so just see what the Lord to increase between Christmas and the New Year's service um my first scripture gonna be first Thessalonians chapter four verse 13 to 18. and then my 2 16 1-3 but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that used to do not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which I sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and of the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air I'm gonna um base most of my thoughts of meeting in the air so we shall ever be with the Lord and Matthews is well for comfort and that with this verse Matthew chapter 16 verse 1 to 3. 63 verse 2 and 3. he answered and said unto them when it is evening he said to be fair weather for the sky is red and in the morning it will be far weather today for the sky is red and lowering oh ye Hypocrites you can design the face of the sky but can you not descend the signs of times but then you can please come and prove by the service let's pray our gracious father Lord Jesus we are so grateful tonight Lord to be in your presence and to be under expectation to receive a word from you tonight Lord it'll change each and every one of our lives one word One Revelation father to give us Clarity of the day that we're living in in the hour that we are approaching Lord bless our precious brother now as he yields himself to your service Lord anoint speaker and hearer and Lord may we rejoice in that great meeting in the air this evening in Jesus name amen amen please be seated yeah once again how many enjoy the Christmas just well I know that everybody enjoyed the Christmas um and it's in between the Christmas and then going to the New Year's service so I'm not the one preaching the New Year the Christmas service also preach already but I'll just I encourage each and everyone that has re preparing for the New Year's Eve and the new year you have to check the little things on them because so many times not the big things deliver things that we live on them that lead us into trouble if you do those little things it end up the big things so you have to check that we do all the little things then let us all I mean have some consecrated time or rededicate our life again to Christ and approach the New Year's service it's very important that we do those little things and the Christmas they have made it um commercialization it's a money making scheme as Pastor said why they having their backyard whatever it is we were also worshiping Christ when we as Christians we worship we have Christmas every day you call Christmas the worship of Christ and that has been always because so many people are looking for Christ they're looking the manger for the Lord Jesus Christ there is no more in the manger he's not in your heart and in my heart so they're looking at him for the wrong point of view talking about Jesus they're always looking at the manger but it's not in a Manger anymore he's in your heart and in my heart walking on the two feet that's when people are missing it big time and it has always been the case because the intellectuals the high priests and all those people in the time of Jesus they makes him very big time and when he was even born because people all the time they put their own intellectual interpretation the word of God so they in their mindset they were expecting that is going to be a big giant man to come and deliver them from there from the Italian from the Romans but he came what the word of God has said you come through a virgin birth and they missed it and they are missing it today again because the Same Spirit and if you look at the priest I read a little bit in over here and the priest and Brian said in the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride paragraph 57 and there was the priest representing the light he had learned from from the Bible he had learned that God was God he had learned that the Holiness was right he was learned that there was a law of God he had learned it because of an intellectual conception and he was born in a right lineage he was a levite but he only know it by intellectual conception and when the light of the hour see he learned it by what had happened not what was happening but what had happened as he said that they can design everything but they fail to know what is happening right now so they were praising for what has happened they know it intellectually they can't design what is happening in the present sense of the ministry of Jesus Christ they always put pointing back or pointing for it so that Prince has learned what has happened so when Jesus Christ was there the Bible said that told Moses that God said I raised up a prophet unto like thee him you should listen that will be the Messiah and when he did that Messiah sign what happened the high priest call it the Elizabeth because he has learned it intellectually but the woman at the world there she was a prostitute married and divorced for five times and was living with a sixth man but because she has a representation in heaven when he recognized that sign she didn't say that it was a Belgium he said we know that the Messiah will come when he cometh he will do these things she cut it right away even though she was a prostitute actually she looks very dark and the priest looked like shining to everybody but when the word of God was made manifest that priest know it all intellectually he failed to recognize that but that woman at the world she has a representation she was part of God's attribute of God so she recognized that this is the sound of the Messiah and the people when the word of God is making manifest it becomes foreign all the time to the people who are not part of him who do not have representation over that side remember when the Bible said that um Joel said that I went Joel prophecy was being made manifest in Acts 2 38 they were caught up they defined that as new people are drunkard but Peter had defined them and said no they are not trans this is that which was spoken of by what Joel when the thing was being manifest those who do not have who do not have representation on the other side they always give it a name no wonder they call Paul that you are heresy and he said away look heresy that's the way I worship my God because what the hell is you the way Paul was worshiping it was foreign it was foreign to them they couldn't cut they couldn't understand it but a true seed of God those who have representation could see that this is the work of God and that has always been the case and it's repeating itself now in the present tense the denomination they rejected the prophet of God they rejected the word that came forth they couldn't recognize it and they tell their people is wrong and they gave all kind of interpretation to it but the true bride of Christ will say this fits me like gross they could recognize that it's the word of God for their day and it has even gone so bad that the intellectualism has even gone into a puppet in this age in the pulpit we didn't even the message that people can quote from A to Z and tell you everything that a prophet said but without the Revelation is just a letter because the letter killing by the spirit give life so without a revelation is just worse because you cannot please God without Revelation and those intellectuals will not take them anywhere because they don't have representation those with their representatives that have the attributes of God will recognize what God is doing present tense they will never put the word back or they won't put it forward it will get manifest they will catch it right away amen that's the true seed of God hallelujah so that's always been the case and they will always catch it but those people is going to be foreign to them and what am I saying I'm I'll just talk about three stages of um of of of justification certification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost but I'm gonna type it up with the Earth we all know that um the the Earth I also have three stages in the time of Noah the Lord told Noah that is going to rain and the people did not believe it but no I believe it out of the Millions it was only eight soul that catch up what Noah was saying but it was the number but if you check when it comes the Rapture it was only one which was Enoch so it's not gonna be many that you have Assurance you don't have to look at the numbers you have to have that Assurance in your heart that if God has met you if God has come to you then I claim I am one of them you claim you're one of them don't have to be worried but it's not going to be many anyways it's only a few chosen one and the people when they rebel against God God send rain to baptize the Earth like the type of justification when you come but God your by justification is that right by justification so he cleanse the word with the water and the next 2000 years was sanctification God himself became a human being and died to save us and he shed his blood on Calvary and that blood Sanctified the Earth exactly sanctify you but when you talk about that before it goes that I'll type it back to Abraham when Abraham told those people that and when he bought that piece of land they wanted to give it to him for free then he refused it you not take it but the Lord Jesus Christ to the same thing on the mountain the devil told him he's gonna give it to him for free but he refused it because if he accepted for free the devil will still have something to do with it he's always going to say something so he rejected it and he went on the cross and paid the price for you and me so he paid for it you are redeemed so on the cross whatever that you've happened of was done on the cross of God when he did it he crushed himself his head the devil was defeated on the cross so when that thing happened you were set free like Barabbas if you are the one supposed to die that he died so that you can go free so tonight don't let nothing hinder you he died on Christ so that you can be free you are Justified because none of us can always forgive and forget but when God forgives you he forgets also he doesn't remember anything so all your sins are forgiven tonight because on Calvary that's what it was for to be forgiven for justify as if you have not done it and he was wounded for your transgression bruised for your iniquities the chastisement of his peace was upon you and it was the stripes you were healed so you are healing is painful you just have to accept it and Redemption is not only in one part he said I wish above all things you prosper and be in health even as you are so Prospect so all the trespects were covered on Calvary so you will redeemed you have been paid for your your sins were painful Health Body and Soul and he said I have a thought for you a touch of Peace not to give you to give us unexpected and not an evil thought so God's thought to us as his genuine thought it's a good thought it's a great thought amen the thought is God's word expressed words the gods were expressed so you are free tonight don't live here with anybody on your heart as we go into the new year it doesn't matter what you did in last year it doesn't matter what you are off it doesn't matter what mistake you did once you confess it with God's fear of forgetfulness don't even think about it because I said that a seed of God cannot even sin God will not impute it against his own self because you are part of God so you cannot even sin so why are you worried tonight everything is paid for I'm free My New Day Has Come amen nothing you are free tonight so don't let nothing hinder you or don't get so much um discouraged or disturb or anything whatever you have God has paid it on the cross on Calvary that's why he came to die that's why he was born to shed his blood for you and me so sickness has no hold on you tonight amen hallelujah thank you Jesus amen our God is awesome God praise God thank you so this word of God is so real to you and me and on Calvary everything was peaceful and if you check the next 2 000 years that's when he's coming back for his bride is that right amen he's coming for us by the next two thousand years the six thousand years and it's one day with God Is Like A Thousand Years so that people think that he's not coming and I'll read maybe second Peter 3 and then we go for it with that scripture second Peter chapter three in second he said that verse 3 knowing this first that they shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts and saying where is the promise of his coming but once God has said his coming is coming and I believe that we are living in a borrowed time because if you look at the way things are happening in the time of the program he's told us that in the first world war if God himself has not stopped the world 11 hour 11 minutes 11 sin is to God move on right into a millennium so what time are we living and said I believe you are living the borrowed time in the time of first Exodus he gave them 30 years extra amen so we are living the borrowed time I don't I can't say when it's gone but I know it inspires you he's coming I don't like it or not amen they will go for the bread is coming for they say that fathers fell asleep all things continuously well from the beginning of the creation that's the skeptic they don't know what they are talking about amen for this they really are ignorance of that the word of God the heavens were of old and have standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perish but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in salt reserved unto the fire against the day of judgment and perish of ungodly men by beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day the Lord is not luck concerning his promise as woman men can't let the bed is long-suffering towards us not wearing that any should perish whether they should come unto us repentance so he's coming he's coming it's past you so you just have to make your your your thing ready because the marriage of the wife the minds of the Lamb has come and his wife had made herself ready so you are the wife of Christ you have a path to play your part is to be ready like the the boss son she made herself ready so the Boston when she went to marry while looking for the bride when you promised that bride he's he's coming for her he she made herself ready amen praise God so the coming of the Lord is at hand Hallelujah our God is awesome God amen I didn't like it or not he's coming you have to be ready he's coming for his bride and that bride is what it's a spotless bride that bride has the mind of Christ that bride is part of him amen the head has come to us to cut the body amen so God is in the pride now you're doing the exact same because the people are always pointing back but it's always our movement of Revelation and the Revelation is the what is that the Rapture hallelujah our god is the rest of God hallelujah praise God so whilst I'm talking about the seven days you have to type it back and forth you are Justified you're sanctified then God filled about the Holy Ghost enter into the Holy Ghost himself come to work cap everything which is God himself living He will burn every trace of sin inside of you that's the same three steps for for the Earth too for God to redeem the Earth by sanctification and then the next six thousand is gonna abandon is that right but then in between when he comes for the bride and then he comes back with the bride there's going to be a millennium which is what the Thousand reign of God but in that Millennium is arrest is not 100 rest because in the Millennium you're going to work you're going to plant you're going to build that's that that's the rest but it's not a full rest the full rest comes on the everyday you come back the seventh day when he comes back for the Judgment when it comes after after white Throne judgment after a white 200 when it comes to a white Throne judgment we go to rock the he said I'll make a new Earth a lot a new Heaven that one is done by God himself so like the Eighth Day you have the um the seven churches the Lord this church is Lord these are the seventh Church age we are in now that was that time that we are all physically in that time at that time was like a law we made our mistake don't do this don't do that don't do that don't do this don't do that but in the end which is the Eternal Church age when it comes the Mind recognize that it's not him anymore is that man Son of God God himself in the bride doing things himself so that nobody can touch it it's God himself in the bride so it's not your works anymore there's no man can touch it anymore I stole your heart if that's what nobody touch it it's him doing it that's the Eighth Day come back to us come back to the eighth the seventh the first day of the week converted the holy convocation is going to leave it because 23 just by congregational holy convocation it comes by the eighth day comes back to eternal so that's why we are in now the tenor Church age amen praise God it's so simple it's so easy why can't people say it Hallelujah I'm going to read this quotation to pack it up I can see it everywhere you saw all over the place says for you it is giving for them it's not giving so that you can know Hallelujah yeah I said that paragraph two three six and we live through all these types in here but when you hit the eighth you go on into eternity you don't come by loss and rituals and others so it's not your works anymore in the eight day you come by predestination if you are not president you can't go you have to have a representation you were in God's thought before the foundations of the world if you are not installed you can't do it I mean there is a genuine holy convocation see and we are ending the seventh Church age the Pentecostal age that has ended so physically you are bodies on the seventh chamber your soul is on the eighth day he said that your subject didn't even change you are living in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen so everything inside it's not you anymore it's Christ who is taking care of everything he's in charge of my soul is the child of everything amen the devil can work they can kill your body they can hurt your spirit my soul is in Christ amen that soul is in Christ nothing can touch Untouchable it's part of God is God part of God himself and God cannot kill himself amen you cannot deny himself so you are part of that amen hallelujah and then improving the sweat he said but the Rapture is going to the wedding supper when the world here you dress with the person and they do become one and then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man the word and the church becomes one whenever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing as a pastor I've taught the soldiers look there's a reference or the son of man again in the bright form that's what Christ is doing now amen Hallelujah so the Rapture inside the world it's just around the corner so very soon we're gonna live from this pest house Brad Danny oh man no wonder when it was revealed to Abraham and the rest they said that we have pilgrims and strangers in this world oh this word is not my home amen this is all my home brother I'm a pilgrim and strangers over here no other job look I said oh my no my redeem I leave it even though when skin warm destroyed this part in my flesh I'll see God why Hallelujah he caught a revelation amen when this thing becomes so rare to you you recognize that you are Foreigner here this is not your home beyond the sky praise God I'm a son of the Living God Amen praise our wonderful God Amen Hallelujah praise God there is going to be a meeting in the air amen you are head of the little Moses in the Belarus in the sorry the Bell rise you have heard of fearless David and his link you have heard the story told of dreaming Joseph and of Jonah and the will and often think there are many many others Through the Bible I should like to meet them all I do declare amen not only do I want to meet all those Sins Of God as that one time brother I'm talking about a a colored man he said that oh I don't talk about Christ to me I just want to see his face and just say thank you Jesus for saving for your Redemption plan for everything amen because he doesn't even want to I just don't don't want no crowns just to see his face and be dead Thousand Years millions millions eternity will that an end with his maker amen that's what you're looking forward to and I long to see all of them I'll meet you over there bro Mike hey man in that meeting in the air Hallelujah there is going to be a meeting there in the sweet sweet by and by I'm going to meet you and meet you over there in that form beyond the sky says changing you here never heard by mother here I'll be it will be glorious I do declare and God's own son will be the leading one at the meeting in the air many things will be missing in that meeting for the bonus bench will have no place at all those miners will not be dead amen there will not be a seven peaceful Sinners foreign over there 'll be no money over over where it was for loved ones oh man there will be no Lawless nights of Freedom prayer all our burdens and all our hungries we believe that at the meeting in the air amen remember oh man they're they're the doctors those out there should not be there amen they'll be missing all together my God the skeptice those who criticize this none of them will be dead they'll be absent that day and like the story that brabham talk about the man that said that as the young lady that you believe the story of Jonah he said yes yes I believe it he said oh I don't believe it he said when you go to heaven upside you're not going to be there so it's not going to be there to know what is going because she's gonna be in heaven I know and believe it so those characters will not be there with us amen and the Ekans will be busy far away there the Saints who have their seal upon their forehead dressed in Raymond not but ransom one can wait all who have the wedding garment will be present at a meeting in the air nobody can escape there's not going to be any Thief over there the one that came through the window he was cast out if you don't have the wedding garment you are not coming there amen praise God so what is it what am I saying zebra Philip I'm trying to say that God is taking us back to what to the first Adam the condition that Adam was in there was no one God was everything was in harmony Adam could said these three move over here because remember when Adam was naming all the animals and everything everything that Anna Adam name God was pleased with it why because he was thinking God's thoughts hey man so God was pleased with it amen so God was missing everything he did and he could tell that tree move over here this move over here this book don't want to access Christ that if you have faith and do not doubt but believe you can say to this mountain be thou removed and it was come to pass because God gave us that Authority everything gets to Adam he restoring back to us now amen so he said if thou can't believe all things are possible is there anything hard for the Lord he's given us everything we just have to attack on the word not only the intellectual conception this word has to make manifest when the word mismatch manifests is the interpretation of the word but the people don't have nothing to do with it they just always intellectualizing it so what am I saying I'll just encourage you think about those place you are going there won't be any gray hair debraham Mike no no gray hair no headache no pain no stress it's a beautiful place he said I am going to prepare a place for you where I am there you shall also be that place is a good place wow the lamb and the Wolf they all stick together the animals they're not gonna be scared of anyone all those 15 is gone because remember God is going to gonna destroy all the atmosphere of sin all that country around there is gonna destroy it and make a new Heaven A New Earth so is him coming back again and what making us on this Dimension to enjoy this again but that to that one in that form of what he wanted it to be a perfect one everything was perfect does nothing like jealousy oh hatred or Miley so none of those things were there it was all pure love of God man you can't even explain it's a measureless and I encourage that people fall in love with God when you fall in love with God then the word becomes what it becomes a life affair because when you talk to your wife you have to have certain secrets you can just understand things on written part so when you fall in love with God those are written by because you can catch it that without you having the love of God you have died him in you a couple part of him and you you can't catch it because you're not in love with him you are not part of him but if you are presented of him when you fall in love with him everything becomes clear amen because you don't hide those secrets from you they revealing secrets to you yeah he's gonna let all his Secrets it's God he loves you he said love a favor that's more amen fall in love with God this is the best that could ever have done amen so I just gonna sing this song I'll let the song be that coming sing this song that's what I have for tonight there is going to be a meeting in the air in the street by and by amen hallelujah amen and then you sing also after that maybe another one to um the lamp in the city where the lamb is the light amen brother Phillip praise
