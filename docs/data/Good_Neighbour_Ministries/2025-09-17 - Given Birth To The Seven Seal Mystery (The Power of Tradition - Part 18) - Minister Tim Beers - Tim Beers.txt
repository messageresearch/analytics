Catch that vision that you've set before us, oh God, that we can keep walking in your way, oh God. As your songwriter said, teach us to wait, Lord. But then we know the move is on, Lord, but it's a paradox, Lord. We just got to wait on you. And when we hear from you, we can move, Father. And that's why we're here, Lord Jesus.

So, fill my way with that perfect love. Amen. Amen. That's what we're striving for tonight. Amen. Hallelujah. It's good to be in the house of the Lord. God bless you. Amen. Amen. It's good to be here. Hallelujah. I I trust and pray that your day was okay. Amen. Hallelujah. It's always a battle for us to get up here and you know, but it's a glorious thing. Amen. And get excited. There's no battle, then you know, no victory. Amen. Hallelujah. If you're in a battle, then you know you're in the race. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're in the fight, Hallelujah. for this perfect word to manifest in our lives, then you know. Hallelujah. you know that Satan's two steps behind you. Amen. And we got to keep pressing forward. Hallelujah. That's what we we got to do in this hour. &gt;&gt; The the the atmospheres, the darkness is getting gross. Gross darkness. &gt;&gt; The battle is raging. Amen. But don't look at those things. Look at the word. Look at Jesus. Look at the promises. Amen. Look at the victory &gt;&gt; that the cross gave us. Amen. In our lives and we can press through. Look at the promises that were given to us in this last day. &gt;&gt; Amen. That by a prophet for the bride of Jesus Christ. Look at those things. Amen. That's what I do. I look at those things. That's the only reason I can stand up here tonight. By the grace of God. Hallelujah. By his anointing. &gt;&gt; Amen. That he that he gives me to stand here and preach the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've been something been stirring on my heart. The last message we preached there, we preached on um uh I believe it was the seventh seal uh setting us free indeed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, tonight I want to take a topic. It's been burning on my heart for a couple weeks now. Hallelujah. I don't know if I'm going to be able to finish it here tonight. Hallelujah. But I I don't care about the the really the notes as much as I care about letting him have his way and speaking into our hearts. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want to title this tonight giving birth to the seven seal mystery. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Giving birth to the seven seal mystery. This is the hour that we're in. Hallelujah. And we're giving birth. Amen. Hallelujah. and and and we want to just talk about allelujah what it is to give birth. What is the seven seal mystery is Christ giving birth to the revealed word of the hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, let us turn. We got a couple scriptures reading here. We got Bible study tonight, right? &gt;&gt; So, we got some scriptures and a few quotes here. So, hallelujah. Amen. So, let's turn to John 3:3, then Ezekiel 36:24, then 1 Peter 1:18. Let's read the scriptures. Hallelujah. Jesus answered and said unto them, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God." Hallelujah. So, there's one one right there. We can't see the kingdom of God. Hallelujah. Nicodemus said unto him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?" We can tell that that's carnal. Allelujah. He wasn't catching the revelation for the time and the age that he was in. Jesus answered, said, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born of water and of spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." So he can't see, now he can't enter. Hallelujah. What is the kingdom of God? They they they said, "When is the kingdom coming to Jesus?" He said, "The kingdom has come." He is the kingdom, the revealed word of the hour. Hallelujah. We need to understand if we can't bring this home, this reality of the word of God home. You're never going to see it. You're never going to understand it. We got to place it today in in our lives. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I say unto thee, you must be born again. Marvel not. Don't be amazed. Don't be shocked. Even today, you must be born again. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but can not tell whence it come and whether it goeth. So is everyone that is born of the spirit. Hallelujah. Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? Oh my. Jesus answered and said unto them, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? Oh my. We don't want the spirit of the Lord saying, "Don't you know the message of the hour and what is spoken, what is said, what is written, and what these things should be." Ezekiel 36:24. Hallelujah. I will take you from amongst the heathen and gather you out of all countries. And I will bring you into your land, and I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean. From all your filthiness, and from all your idols will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you. &gt;&gt; And I will take away the stony heart. Hallelujah. Amen. Out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you. &gt;&gt; You hear? You hear what he's saying? And cause you to walk in my statutes. I will cause you to walk by my spirit within you, and you shall keep my judgments and do them, and you shall dwell in the land, the land of revelation. Amen. That I give to your fathers, and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. Oh, hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen. 1 Peter 1:18. Amen. And I can see all this manifesting in the new birth of the hour. Hallelujah. Amen. For as much as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversations, received by traditions of your fathers, but with the precious blood of Christ as a lamb without blemish and without spot, who verily was fore orained before the foundation of the world, but was manifested in these last times for you. He was manifested in these last times for you. Hallelujah. Who by him do believe in God that raised him from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in God. See, and ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unferent love of the brethren. See that you love one another with a pure heart fervently, being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever. Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to God. Let us pray. Father, we thank you, Lord, for this thought here tonight, Lord, that you've been burning on my heart. Father, I pray, oh God, the Holy Ghost, I can't do nothing without you, Lord. come and and raise the faith level now in this building, Father, in these hearts of your believers, Lord. Father, I pray a word would be spoken, Lord, that will enlighten and open up the light bulb and reveal. Let there be an awaken, Father, whether it be here or online. Let your presence, let your anointing come, oh God. Lord, we don't do nothing. We can't go anywhere, Lord, without you. Father, we can't take the next step without you. the next breath without you, Father. Come, oh God, and reveal what you want to be spoken here tonight, Father, in Jesus Christ's name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless. You're seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. I I just want to read um just let you know the messages that I'm getting out because I won't have time to, you know, quote this and quote that where it's coming from. They're just I'm just going to read and that's it. But all these thoughts here tonight or some of them whatever I get will be taken out of the messages on 65 it is the rising of the sun 63 desperation 63 the token 65 birth pains 65 invisible union of the bride of Christ and 65 modern events being made clear by vindicated prophecy. Amen. Hallelujah. Glory to God. The bride has a right to the right birth. Hallelujah. Amen. That's that's her right to the right birth. Glory to God. There's always a fight when it comes to a birth. There's always a dying out, you know, as as the pastor said on Sunday to listen to what is the Holy Ghost given for because we're saying that to enlighten you. Amen. So that you can go back and meditate on the word and chew on the word. Hallelujah. Because this is a a day where where Satan is trying to make us so busy and so distracted that we don't feed on the word. And listen, you need to feed on the word of God. Amen. You need to feed on his spirit. Not just the letter, but his spirit. Amen. So go back and listen to the message after this message, birth pains, and you'll see a lot what I'm understanding and what he's bringing forth. A lot of the revelation. Amen. Amen. Because some of it might sound strange to you. Amen. But that's the way it's always been in every age. Amen. Hallelujah. They looked at brother Brandham and they said, "Oh, who are you? You're just a man. You're just a preacher. You got no education." But he was a prophet to the 21st century. Amen. Never been a prophet like that prophet. And I believe him with all my heart. But I also believe that the message him as a prophet, he was a seven church angel messenger. Amen. And the message as whole, part of it is to the Pentecostal church. Amen. Part of brother Brana's message gave birth only to the Pentecostal age and to the church. Amen. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Amen. What is the meaning of spiritual rebirth? Being born again, spiritually rebirth also describes in the scriptures by such terms as baptism of fire or a mighty change is a spiritual transformation that results in one has actually received the Holy Ghost and experience the remission of sins that follow it. Experience what? Remission of sins. Recognizing, Amen, that you're a sinner. Recognizing that you're in unbelief. Recognizing that that that you know you the way that you're living, the way that you're believing, Amen. the way that you were taught before, Amen. was wrong, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Was wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Even if you're brought up in the message, you're born in the message. Amen. Hallelujah. It doesn't matter. You know, you're born in the message, you're hearing preaching, you're preaching, but you're not converted. You're not born again. Amen. So things that are being interpreted to you are different than somebody that's born again and listening to the same message that you are listening to. So you're brought up in the message not born again and realizing that you are getting programmed in your mind by certain thoughts and certain interpretations in your mind. Oh yes, it forms you just like just like a child from a young birth. Amen. when he's grown up, those first five years, whatever atmosphere that that child is in, whatever that they're being taught is forming their character, is forming their spirit is forming their ideal of what life and this life is all about. &gt;&gt; Okay? Amen. We're going to get somewhere soon. What is the biblical meaning of rebirth? The transformation power of faith, revelation in Jesus Christ, the revealed word, the belief in the continuum continuing of life and the possibility of transformation and growth over time. So we can see right there, it's a life. The rebirth is a life. It you give birth to life and it continues. It grows. Amen. It continues to grow. Amen. You tell me you give birth to a child and and that child is a, you know, six months old and and if that child in in 5 years is still 6 months old, there's something wrong with that child. Nature tells you that that child after it's born into this world, it has to grow. It's got to feed and it has to grow. Why? It's been given new life. God breathed the life, natural life into that child and that's why it lives. And in its body, its natural body, amen, it has all the things required so that it can grow. So life when you're born again is a continuing growth. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not I'm not pointing any fingers here, but I'm telling you people I've come across people in this message. Amen. and even out of their own lips. I got no testimony. I got no growth. I don't see God in my life. Hallelujah. People wondering whether they're born again. People wondering whether whether God is in their life or not. Doubting, questioning how can a you know when you when you give life, you notice today, you can't question that you're alive. If you question that you're alive here tonight, then maybe you're insane. Maybe you lost your mind. Amen. We're alive here tonight. Amen. We're at certain ages. We got certain experiences in our life. Amen. Hallelujah. We understand that. We know that tonight. Amen. Well, that's the same way with being born again. You got to know that you're born again by the spirit of God. You got to know that you given birth to this revealed word of this hour. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. You know, Brother Brandham talking here in in birth pains, he's saying, you know, a an egg, a a chick that's in the egg. Hallelujah. It knows no other way but to keep pecking and keep pecking and keep pecking until it pecks its way out of that egg. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the way life comes forth, my brothers and sisters. Amen. Hallelujah. That's not being comfortable. Amen. That I'm in the message. I believe God sent a prophet. And people don't realize. They get under that spirit, under that anointing. Amen. And get complacency under the word. Amen. Under programs, under camp meetings, under all these things planned ahead, not realizing that they got to peck their way out. You got to peck your way out of something. What is that something that you got to peck your way out of? It's it's it's sin. It's unbelief. All of us. Amen. Listen, let me tell you. When when when the birth came to me, when the enlightened came to me, Amen. All I know I was in desperation. Hallelujah. We're going to get to it. But brother said the token, he said once that token came on display and we're going to realize what that token is and what it really means in this hour came on display, I went into desperation. Hallelujah. Oh God. Cuz he realized that something just happened. Something just changed. Amen. At that time and he he went into desperation. Hallelujah. Here he was all these years in Pentecost in the ministry of Pentecost preaching the Pentecostal revelation. But then here come a mighty angel and changed everything. Amen. Hallelujah. He got birth. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; What are you talking about, brother Tim? &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? He's got birth. Oh my. People's minds are so so intertwined. We're preaching on the power of tradition still. Amen. Brother Brandon speaking here. It's the rising of the sun. As Christ was the first one to rise from all the prophets and so forth and all the types in many places. He was the first fruit of those that slept in the bride coming of Christ. You hear what he said? In the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church, there will have to be a sheath waved again in the last days. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh my. He says waving of the sheath. What is a sheath? The first one that come to maturity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to God. It's like that wheat field. They're at different levels. Amen. And you know how you know how this one gets to this one and this one gets to that one? Because they look at each other. Amen. They follow each other. Amen. Hallelujah. They know where they're going. They're going up. Amen. Glory to God. Amen. The first one that proved it was a wheat. That proved it was a sheath. Hallelujah. I'm sure you see it what I'm talking about. But he says it was waved over the people. I'm sure we see it tonight. Those who have been in the message long enough, those have seen the life of Christ through a prophet in these last days. I'm sure you've seen it. It's not just to tickle your ears or fancy you or get you worked up in some kind of emotion. Amen. Hallelujah. There was there was the example. Amen. in front of our eyes being waved over us. There was the path of life that was being waved over us. There is the way that we must walk. Amen. The bloody footprints were being displayed right before us. Amen. A life. He wasn't just a prophet to to the age. Amen. Hallelujah. But he was an example. He was a wave sheet. He was a life that was going before us. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And the first time there will come forth for the bride age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity of the word has turned back in its full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there. Hallelujah. The same power, my brothers and sisters, to what? Is it just miracles? Just laying hands upon the sick? No. The same power that transforms our lives. Amen. The same power that gives us the new birth. &gt;&gt; That's the miracle in this hour. The transformation of the new birth, being born again. Hallelujah. Amen. Now listen. If Moses, Noah, Abraham, David, and Solomon, Ezekiel, and all the prophets messages, unless it lines up with this word in this age, that it is to manifest in the bride, we have to leave it as the word of God in the past age. We can only move on with anything that is said from the past age if it lines up with the revelation of this age, this bride age. Other words, I believe all the message of brother Brandham is true. Just like I believe all the Bible's true. You believe all the Bible's true. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You believe You believe uh Moses was true. You believe Noah was true. David, all of them were true. Amen. But it but if you look at what can you use Noah's message and preach it today can you use Moses's we can only look back and that's what he's saying here we can only look back in type form if it does not type and does not reflect spiritually the message of this age and this hour we have to leave it. We have to leave it just like the message of the hour. The message of the hour has a Pentecostal message in it. Hallelujah. Amen. That Pentec that Pentecostal message is a different age and we got to leave it. Hallelujah. We got to leave it behind. Now listen, when we have a phone or a computer and every once in a while it needs an upgrade. when it gets an upgrade, if that old technology isn't comparable to the new technology, the upgrade then the computer or the phone, it has to leave that old technology behind and move on with the upgraded technology. It's all the word. Amen. But when the word comes into its age and its time and it's spoken, Amen. and it's revealed and it opens up like that Roman candle. It keeps exploding and it keeps opening up. This is the same letter. It's the same written word that we're feeding off of. But the spirit is giving it life. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see what it says? It's giving it life. When it What is life? Life is a continuing manifestation and growth. Amen. It it unfolds. It's like eternal life. It grows. It grows. It doesn't stop. Amen. Life continues. Glory to God. Hallelujah. The word has marched on to the fullness of truth. And now it is time we got Christ himself in manifestation and manifest in what he had in his mind before the foundation of the world. That God and man will become one and the word will become flesh again. Amen. Amen. And he knew that this day, hallelujah, we will be given birth to the fullness of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not in part anymore, &gt;&gt; but the fullness of the word. &gt;&gt; The fullness of Christ. Amen. Has been given to us. Amen. And has been waved over us. Hallelujah. Glory to God. We don't even realize how powerful that is that this prophet was so anointed and brought through and fulfilling the word of God for these last days and waved over us. That that that waving of that prophet of that first one coming to maturity. You know that effect is still here tonight. &gt;&gt; It's in the room tonight. That same Holy Ghost is here tonight. Amen. That was waving back then. We just look at a man. I know that's what you're thinking in your mind. You just look at a man. But it's the Holy Ghost. It's the word of God being manifested in flesh back then waving over the people. Amen. It was Christ in the prophet saying, "Here I am." Hallelujah. Here's the progression of me. Hallelujah. Here I am moving on step by step by step right &gt;&gt; through the prophet's message. Hallelujah. Amen. And we need to recognize where the prophet went. We have to look at where he went. And it's all through the Bible. They always look Amen. where the word was going. And we must recognize by faith. Like Elijah, if you see me going, hallelujah to Elisha. If you see me going, if you catch the revelation, then I'll give you a double portion &gt;&gt; of my spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we have to see where this faith and where the Lord was leading and where it was going. And that's the same thing we follow today &gt;&gt; in our own personal lives. Forget about portions and portions of faith and you know uh our callings, our gifts. This is just a gift to preach. Amen. I have to have a personal walk with Jesus Christ. I have to produce that word just like any one of you. Hallelujah. and be born again, you know, doesn't make me born again because I preach the gospel. No, there's too much in the word of God, amen, that says, you know, about false preachers and false this and false that, false anointed ones. Even be anointed doesn't matter. Being anointed, I know what I'm saying because I know where I stand in my experience. It's not that all these things deceive the people from recognizing the word of God. Satan puts a smoke screen. So many spo smoke smokec screens and so many tools of deception over the people taking the same word of God. Did he do that to Eve? Took the same word of God. Same message. Hallelujah. The prophet was trying to show us that our experience in this hour and by the opening of the seventh seal should be the seed, the weektime experience. Hallelujah. Where the fullness of the word made flesh, being born again by the experience after 1963 is with the seventh seal himself. Hallelujah. Glory to God. I don't want to get ahead of myself because I want to lay some things out and explain it a little. experience the word in full capacity in all fulfillment of what has been promised when Christ lives in his bride. This is the hour of total deliverance where the sons, the sons of God, Amen. And the son of man is setting his people free indeed. Where the sons and daughters of God can come into full potential of who they are. It's no more in part, but it's total completion of our experience. As Paul said, it's not I that live, but now it's Christ that liveth through me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to God. But it's Christ that lives in me, experiencing that God is walking in us, living in us, speaking through us, expressing his characteristics in us like no other age. My brothers and sisters, hallelujah. We look at the prophet and we see his life. Now, don't look at his ministry. Look at his life. That's why God allowed him to testify and speak so much of his personal life on the tapes. And I know people take that and they misinterpret everything. Amen. But when you see that life that he manifested, Amen. that Christ was manifesting him on on the job outside of church hunting. Amen. Doing what he's doing, getting together with people, fellowshipping, dinners, all these things. Amen. Christ was always there manifesting himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, he was. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. When somebody's born again, hallelujah. All I know is I want to talk about the word. I don't I I mean I don't want to I don't want to, you know, come to your place and just word all night long. Amen. Those who know me and come over. Amen. Hallelujah. I'll talk about this. I'll talk about that. I like to enjoy our company and our fellowship. But man, if that word don't come, Hallelujah. It's going to come. It's going to come because I'm going to bring it. Hallelujah. Amen. We got to allow him to come in. Amen. We got to bring him on the scene. Amen. Amen. We want him in our fellowship. Amen. We want him in our homes. Amen. We want him in our speaking and our talking. Hallelujah. We want to experience him to the fullness that he has for us in this hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Glory. That's what the birth does in this hour. Amen. It takes over and possesses the life. Amen. Like I was uh trying to preach there on on Friday there, praying without ceasing. Amen. The thoughts of God. Amen. Amen. We got the mind of Christ. Amen. We've been born again with the mind of Christ. Amen. Every thought that I get is a prayer. If I think about you, I'm praying about you. Amen. That's the Holy Ghost in us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. You We look in the tapes and we see how real. Is that true? &gt;&gt; We see how real God became to the prophet. We see how real his life was manifesting in the prophet's life. If you listen to those tapes and you don't see that just like he said, if you don't see Christ in all the Bible, go back and read it again. Get on your knees and pray. Hallelujah. Amen. I wonder about people if they're born again or they're still born. Hallelujah. Amen. The Holy Ghost has been given for many reasons. To call you out of the world, bring you into a new birth, which brings you into the kingdom of God and allows you to see God and your purpose. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It will cause you to see and recognize God and your purpose. Is somebody listening to me? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen. I should have that sign up here. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Second, boy. You know I'm on your side. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Sometimes the devil puts in a thing like this and he he attacks me all the time up here. He's throwing all kinds of thoughts at me up here. Amen. To try to divert my thought. Amen. But because he knows somebody's going to give it blessed. Amen. Hallelujah. So when I hear amen, you're saying, "Boy, sick them." Keep sick them, boy. Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to God. Just keep saying amen until amen becomes amen in you. Until amen blesses the amen. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every church age produces a birth according to the portion of the word that has been revealed to them. &gt;&gt; And when that age is done, now listen, that particular birth was not available anymore. Hallelujah. Amen. They had to wait for the word to be revealed for the age coming. &gt;&gt; They are now into I into into receiving the new birth then. Hallelujah. Think about it my brothers and sisters. Glory to God. People in this message I'm going to just say things plain. People in this message believing by and having experiences. Oh yes. Amen, brother Brandham. So you can be anointed every day of your life and have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day of your life and still go to hell. Why? Because they're not born again of the word for their age. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; People sitting under this message for many, many years. Amen. And not born again by this opening of this seven seal &gt;&gt; revelation. Is it something that you, oh, I'm going to get the seal book and I'm going to read it and then I'm going to be born again. No, &gt;&gt; it's the living God, Christ, when he comes and reveals to you the word for this day, this age that we're living in. &gt;&gt; He had to do the same thing to the prophet, &gt;&gt; the changing of the age, the changing of the dispensation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. people's experience coming to church listening to same preaching listening to the tapes but living in a past age in their experience in their spirit in their revelation. &gt;&gt; That's why you need preachers. Amen. that God will will will give them the revelation of this hour to speak the truth to shake up things &gt;&gt; so that if you're that chicken in there and you haven't come out of your egg yet. I don't care how many years God don't deal with your years in that egg you got a peck. A birth is a fight. A birth is between life and death. A birth is a struggle. &gt;&gt; It always is. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. When somebody gets pregnant, from the time that they get pregnant to the time that they deliver, they're in travail. Hallelujah. That some something is being born inside of them. Something is growing inside of them. Things are changing in their body. Their molecules are changing. Their blood is changing. Amen. Everything is changing inside of them. Amen. There's a birth taking place. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that that that mother wants that child to grow. Amen. Grow. So that one day it will give birth to it. It will see the life that was producing inside of her. &gt;&gt; Oh God. &gt;&gt; Oh more and more of God. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I was I was I believe that God gave me the birth and I was moving for about two years and I went to a meeting. God led me to a meeting. Amen. Hallelujah. in Michigan and I was there was about I don't know thousand people or whatever was there and I was called out from way in the back and this minister was at the platform and he walked right over through all the people and he says brother I believe that God the spirit of God led me right to you. Hallelujah. Just like the Holy Ghost Amen and and Simon and Anna led them right to the Christ. Amen. The Holy Ghost led me right to you. And he and he says he says one thing and I I God was moving in my life. God w I was I was seeing God. I didn't understand everything but I knew that change was happening in my life. Amen. Hallelujah. I didn't know if I was born again or not, but I know what happened to me was different. That I was changed. My desires, my heart, everything was changed. Amen. I wanted God. Amen. And he said a few things and prophesied a few things over my life which are coming to pass now. Amen. But one of the things I want to point out, Amen. He said, "You're desiring more of God." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're desiring more of God. Listen, when this birth strikes you and it connects with you, I don't care what you go through. I don't care what experience you have with God. There's always going to be a testimony in your spirit that you want more of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. More. 34 years here today. Amen. And I want more of God. &gt;&gt; I want more of this truth that I'm preaching to open up and reveal and manifest in my life. &gt;&gt; That never stopped. I've been up and I've been down. I've been in and I've been out. But oh God, this has been faithful all the time. Amen. And you can realize it has nothing to do with your flesh. More of God. The new birth brings more of God. More and more and more of God. People are dying. Why are you dying? &gt;&gt; Why are people dying? We We got the word of life. &gt;&gt; We got to live in Christ right before us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Born again. Let us move on so we can make sense of this. The seed has to rot and be buried to bring forth new life. So does teachings and doctrines from the past age. Hallelujah. Do you know do you realize that when you listen to the prophet's message that you are actually listening to teachings, doctrines, opinions from a past age in there and and and the present age, the bride age, the capstone age. Do you realize that? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If you've been born again by the spirit of God, &gt;&gt; you will recognize that by the spirit of God. Not because I say it to you and you can understand what I'm saying. You can shake your head to the preacher all the time and every single preacher that comes up here and walk out of here and don't know what what you're talking about or what what understanding. But it's true. When the spirit of God comes, it filters. &gt;&gt; It's still the word of God, but it filters &gt;&gt; because why? It has. The word of God has been spoken for this age and that age has to fulfill. God spoke to Noah. I'm trying to make it as simple as possible. God spoke to Noah and said, "Build an ark. There's a flood coming." That was the revealed word for that day. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Noah caught that revelation and he went and built an ark. He was anointed to build the ark. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Hallelujah. And a word's been spoken in this day. Hallelujah. and and and we're anointed for that word to be manifested. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So in this message, you can see, listen, teachings, traditions of men that keep people from moving forward to receiving the revealed word for their day. And a lot of people are born again by an experience from a past age. Not the age that they're living in, not the revealed word for this day in his fullness was available. That was incorruptible seed birth back there. Think about it. Incorruptible birth without this seven seal revelation being revealed to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is an incorruptible birth in this hour. Hallelujah. Amen. Now listen. Hallelujah. They are living in when the word opened up in 1963. Hallelujah. The token life in its fullness was available. Now I know you say, "Oh, I know the seals were breaking. I know the serpent seed. I know the church ages were be before 63." But you need to recognize that was all a process of God moving his word forward. &gt;&gt; But then came the opening of the seals. And I'm going to prove it to you by brother Brandham. Amen. That the the token was not. We must have the token today. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the token was not available then. through all those years of the church ages, the serpent seed, all these things, the token was not available. &gt;&gt; Right? If you know your message, hallelujah, then you know what I'm talking about. Hallelujah. But not today. Have it today is corruptible seed. God's truth was moving forward into per perfect faith. people still feeding off of messages before 63 and believing it's enough today. Oh, I you know it's very very very you know a born again believer that's born again by the spirit has come to the full maturity can feed off of before 63 and get blessed. Okay. I know this this when every time anyone bruth and any kind of seems like any kind of change, it's hard on the people because people hate change. Whether you believe it or not, spiritually speaking, religiously speaking, you get content of where you're at and what you believe. And if the Holy Spirit or somebody comes and starts stirring that up in your minds, it stirs up a spiritual warfare. It always does. And then you start thinking, "Wow, I've been through it, too. Was that that is that right?" But I found that every time that something was ministered and preached, hallelujah, and it stirred my mind, it stirred up my belief, what I thought I was believing, and it stirred it up. Of course, I go back and I study. Of course, I go back and I pray, but I always found that God was taking me higher. Hallelujah. It's like that Roman candle. Boom. Truth comes. What? What? What's that denominational spirit? You take a truth and you stay there. Truth Truth doesn't stay. God's truth keeps marching on. It goes up. It goes up. It goes up. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. So in saying that, feeding off the message before 63 and believing it's enough today. Now what do I mean by feeding off of it? They could be listening to 63 and on. They could be, but in their experience, in their revelation, their faith is still back there before the changing of the age. Amen. It's enough today. But it's after 63 the token life was available. The new birth in the fullness of the word. The message is in two parts. Coming out and going in. The token was not available until the evening time. Okay. Now, brother Brandham said the evening time of his message, which is at what? The end of his message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, listen here. End time. evening time of the message or the end of the message. Brother Brandham said since the seven seals opening all the messages from the time on was the token coming available to the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can see amen when the mighty angel came down. &gt;&gt; Oh God. Amen. The dispensation changed. Brother Brandham's amen commission started changing there as being the seventh church age messenger amen now the mighty angel was here on earth and all the message after that was displaying Christ is the mystery of God revealed greater than Solomon is here &gt;&gt; we can see a prophet decreasing &gt;&gt; hallelujah that wasn't a prophet speaking those things revealing those things after 63 all I see was a prophet decreasing and the mighty angel Jesus Christ coming into plain view. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. The token coming available for the bride that started a new age for a new birth of the bride. She can only be born by the opening of the seven seals. That is the life of Christ being born in her to fulfill all that was spoken of her being one with him. Now listen, that's when brother Brandham said, think about it. All the messages that he preached before 63. And here he comes. When this came, these seven seals open, the mighty angel came down. Now, brother Brandham said, "This is when the Bible became a new Bible to me. &gt;&gt; This is when everything became new to me." What was he saying, my brothers and sisters? Hallelujah. Amen. He knew he gave birth to the revealed word of the hour, &gt;&gt; the time he was living in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Now, he moved into the bride ministry. Amen. the same ministry that is manifesting here tonight. Hallelujah. Glory to God. It wasn't him anymore. The seven church age prophet. Amen. That dispensation had changed. That that office was done away with. Amen. Now it was Christ. Amen. Christ living in his tabernacle coming into the fullness of the word manifesting. Amen. Amen. And here comes a prophet now changing and transforming into the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Coming to manifest. Hey, I'm the wave sheep bride in the future. Amen. It's going to be the same Christ. The same God in me is going to be manifested in you now. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Amen. A new Bible. He says everything changed. He said it. Everything that he understood from before changed. Do you realize he said that? Hallelujah. Brother Brandham speaking here. Desperations. Now watch. What's coming after those seven seals? Think about it. What's coming after those seven seals? The uniting of the people. The uniting signs of the red lights flashings of the last days. The signs of women getting prettier and men that would they would do all these signs of the Holy Spirit leading up then come right back here to the capping off of all those messages. Desperation go look it up for yourself. All those messages since the seven seal is capping off of this one thing the token. Hallelujah. capping off this one thing of all these messages. What did brother Madam say outside of the seven seals? What did he say that he knew that it was direct from God? The token. The token message. He said the token message changed everything for him. The token message put him in desperation. Hallelujah. In all things. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. The token birth could only come in the evening time. It is the token age we are living in. And brother Brandham says that that we're living in after the opening of the seven seals. Then the blood was a token for our identification. The blood is the token and the token must be applied or the covenant is not in effect. If this token, this blood is not applied to our lives, the covenant is not into effect. Think about it. You talk about desperation. Hallelujah. Brother Tim, are you in desperate always? More of God. More of God. You make mistakes, Brother Tim. Yes. But more of God. You fall. You have tests. You have trials. You fail God. But more of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. More of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I got a revelation that this flesh will not inherit the kingdom of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So what what is making me see Jesus Christ in the revealed word? What is making me see the kingdom of God? What has caused me to enter into the kingdom of God? It's not this flesh. It's the attribute, the new birth inside of me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what changes everything for a believer. &gt;&gt; That's what brings your faith to another level of overcoming in this hour. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Still, my God, my brothers and sisters, healing is healing. I know that. I need healing. Everybody needs healing. Amen. I'm grown just like you. But oh God, come into a place. We still want to lay hands on people. We still want to do these things. We still have testimonies of a past age. Amen. Speaking how you speak about the word will either identify you in this age or a past age. You know, some people in this message when they speak about the word, the Bible, they're preaching a Luther's message. They're speaking a Luther's understanding or Wesley understanding, but most of the people that have not been born again. Amen. By this token, this word are preaching and speaking a Pentecostal message. I've sit there amongst people and fellowship with them. I fellowship with a lot of you under the reveal word of the hour, but I fellowship with people. And you sit there and you talk with them. You see, we're inter interdimensional. The same person that you're seeing here, and I hope it's you, too, is in heaven, too. We're in different dimensions at the same time here by the revelation, by the new birth. Hallelujah. I can sit there and talk with some. That's what brother Brandon meant. I know people take it out of context. People have no understanding of it. They think they think they work a discernment up. They work up something. No, it's by the spirit. It's by the discerning of the word. The Bible says the word of God is quicker and sharper than a two-edged sword. So when anybody's speaking the word, you'll know what they're speaking if you got that same spirit inside of you. It's the same fellowship. Maybe on different levels, but the same fellowship. Hallelujah. People preach the word to me all the time on on Facebook and all that stuff in this message. And I go, "My God, that's Pentecostal. They haven't caught the revelation of this." And next thing you know, they start sending me stuff from a Pentecostal church in this message. It has to manifest. Every seed must bring forth of his own kind. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. We got to know where we're standing and where we're at. Each and every one of us as individuals. God ain't going to bring my wife because she's my wife or husband because it's your husband. No, you're all going individually. &gt;&gt; God just allowed us to be down here because of the flesh and grow together in Christ together. But we're individuals. Gentiles are always individuals. Amen. Hallelujah. Let me move on here. Hallelujah. The blood must be applied or the covenant is not effect. The lamb was killed in the evening time. You get it? This is brother Brandon speaking here. The token never came into existence until the evening time until the end of his message. Oh hallelujah. But we get complacency. Now listen spiritually here. complacency. When deeply entrenched traditions can lead to complacency where people become so accustom to exist in methods that they lack the time or the energy or consider alternatives. And that's what this revelation is all about when it opens up to you. You want to grow in this revelation, in this word. Hallelujah. Can't be complacency. Hallelujah. It's difficult to introduce new truth into communities bound by traditions because traditions provides a sense of comfort. Oh my. I I know the word the way I know the word. I believe the message the way I believe the message, the way God reveals it to me. Don't don't shake that comfort up. Don't Don't try to shake, you know, my faith here tonight that I'm not born again or I'm born again. I'm not doing none of that. That's between you and God. and challenge them them to feel like a threat to one's psycho psychological well-being and a disturbance in the statue of your status quo. Hallelujah. New truths. You see, you can't have a new reality, my brothers and sisters, with an old mentality. And that's the problem. You can't you can't see a new age looking back and having your mentality not moving with the changes of truth. It's always opening up and revealing itself. That's why every generation fails to move forward with truth. Just because you're here in 2025 and we look at the message. Hallelujah. It doesn't mean we're moving forward in the new age. Hallelujah. Moving forward with truth. They take it for their time and it becomes a reality and forms an old mentality. You know, I had to break out of in 34 years, my brothers and sisters. I can go back and give you all the experiences that I've had and the moving of God in my life and the supernatural in my life. But, you know, all that time God was leading me on and I had to break out of old mentalities, break out of, you know, truths that I I that was revealed to me then. I had to break out of it and let it break open and expand. I'm not saying deny truth, reject truth, but truth opens up. Truth constantly reveals itself, unfolds itself constantly. That's how a baby grows into a human, to an adult. Amen. The cells break. They they they constantly re regenerate the cells. They constantly renew themselves all the time. And that's what God's truth always does. In order for us to grow spiritually into this fullness of the word in this hour, truth has to constantly be breaking and breaking and breaking. But I'm I I'm sorry to say, my brothers and sisters, what the problem is is that people listen to the tapes and listen to the messages and they receive truth. Yes, they receive truth, but they stay right there in that truth and they take that truth and they don't even realize they're forming a complacency around that truth, a denominational spirit around that truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you don't allow God's spirit to march on and for truth to move on in your life and continue to reveal itself inside of you so that you can grow spiritually. You don't realize that you denominated and you died. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I see that in the prophet's life. I see a progression of faith. Amen. Things that he thought over here were different over here. Things he said over here, he said different over here. Things that he thought over here were different over here. What is that? A progression of faith. &gt;&gt; I know some people out there who left the message and all that said he was wrong. He's off. No, that's not what it is. It's a progression of faith &gt;&gt; of of the spirit of God moving on. Truth marks and on. Hallelujah. God don't reveal everything to his prophets all the time. He didn't see everything. Amen. He's seen it over time as God led him through the stages of truth. Amen. Hallelujah. I can't see that quarter two. There's a there's a kind of like a blinding light there now. Amen. Now, notice, let me get a few things here and then we'll just continue the next time I'm up. Now notice in a seed birth the old seed must die before the new one can be born. So therefore death is a hard any time. So it's painful. It's distressful. That's what I'm talking about here. Birth is the same because you're bringing life into the world and it's painful. And that's the reason it is so hard for those Pharisees to understand our Lord Jesus Christ because they were under the law. Now listen. Now listen. Hallelujah. And the law was the word of God in seed form. Are we still listening? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But when the word was made flesh, it become not law but grace. &gt;&gt; Not law but grace. &gt;&gt; And people are still in this message living under law. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And producing a legalistic life, a legalistic spirit. taking the same quotes, claiming to believe the same prophet, the same Bible, and the same Jesus Christ as you. Now listen. Hallelujah. Now grace and law cannot exist at the same time. Do we understand that &gt;&gt; gra law and grace cannot exist in your life at the same time? Law might come into your life as a school master. Amen. Amen. But then when grace comes in that area of your life that that grows and matures you, law has to go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All law has to go out of our lives. Amen. That's going to produce that body change in us. That rapture, that perfect faith, that perfect realization cannot come, these things cannot come with law in our lives. Now, grace and law cannot exist at the same time. He's talking cuz grace is so far above law that law is not even in the picture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Law is not even in this token. This life of Jesus Christ. Amen. Jesus fulfilled the law. He came and fulfilled the law. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we are complete in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He by his spirit, by his life, now he leads us and guide us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; If you want to say he's our law, that satisfies your mind and doesn't stir you up too much, then say it. And therefore, it's so hard for the Pharisees to die to their law so that grace could be born. That grace can be born, but it must go. He's saying the law must go. The two laws cannot exist at the same time. There cannot be a law that says that you can run this way then sending a message the other way. And that's what law does between law and grace. Law tells you in the message &gt;&gt; your your interpretation, your understanding, it tells you to go this way in your life and in your walk. But then grace tells you to go this way and move in a different direction. the same message, the same written word being interpreted by the law or by grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We know that the old seed must die before the new seed can come out. The old seed must rot. Absolutely. Not die only, but rot after it's dead. We heard it a few weeks ago, right? the seed rot. My brothers and sisters, not just die out to yourself, but those understandings and those interpretations that you had even as you're growing in the message, they got to rot. You can't bring them with you. You know, like in the Bible, they bring they bring all their their God says get rid of everybody everything. That's why he told Saul, "Kill everything and everybody every single thing. Don't take one thing." And you know what Saul did? when they when they when I forget the the story in the Bible where they they Achen Hallelujah went and took all that stuff not one thing my brothers and sisters if we're moving on to the rapture we got to leave everything when God is revealing new things to us we got to leave every old understanding behind in in order for us to move forward &gt;&gt; in order for us to overcome &gt;&gt; in order for new life to come. Oh God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Never go back. We go forward when you're born again. You understand? We go forward when you're born again. And that's why I think today we have so many genuine new births. We don't have so many genuine new births. Sorry. is because maybe it sympathize with the word or the person, but they don't want to rot away from that old system that they're in that they were in. They don't want to come out of it. Yes, my brothers and sisters, this is not the denomination's brother Brandham's day. This is your thinking. This is your understanding. This is your experience. that he's talking about tonight. You got to judge yourself. Hallelujah. Judge where you're at. They want to say stay in the old system and claimed a new birth or the message of the age. It's brother Brandon speaking here. We found that under Luther Wesley Pentecost and all the other ages, they still try to hold on to the old system and claim this. But the old system age must die and rot in order to bring forth a new one. They still want to cling. Hallelujah. People still in this message want to cling to the Pentecostal message. Hallelujah. Amen. What time is it? I can't see. Okay, we'll just say a couple more things here and we'll invite the miss musicians up. Hallelujah. Like I said earlier, my brothers and sisters, this message has a Pentecostal birth and it has a new birth of the bride age, the capstone age in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It does. Whether you believe it or not, whether your interpretation of the quotes and all that stuff give you something a different out, that's fine. I'm just going to hear preaching what's on my heart, what God has revealed to me. invisible union of the bride of Christ. You stay right straight in the promise of God, the word of God. And that word, if it is the word for the age, God vindicates it. So, if he doesn't, it's not the word for this day. The word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work today. No sir. That was for Pentecost. This is the bride going home of the bride. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; We got something different. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We got something different. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here's a prophet speaking. We are in a bride age. No more than the word of Noah would have worked in the days of Moses. No more that Moses law would have worked in the time of Paul here. He tried to tell them, you have to die and be dead to that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you cannot have that. &gt;&gt; Think about it. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Let me just find something here to invite the musicians up. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Modern vests made are clearer made clear by prophecy 1965. See a man can say anything but unless God interprets that word. But God don't need no interpreter. He's his own interpreter. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He interprets his own word by vindicating it in the age that it's purposed for, the age that it's given for. &gt;&gt; We're not living, this is brother Brandon speaking here. We're not living in a Pentecostal age. We're living in another age. And I've been trying to speak that tonight. Come on. &gt;&gt; After 1963. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; See, we're not living in the Methodist age. We're not living in another We're living in another age. We're not living up here. We're living up here in the bride age. the calling out of the church and getting it together for a rapture. That's the age that we're now living in. To my honest opinion, that's the exact truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the prophet. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's the exact truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's what he's saying. This is thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Until the evening time, the end of my message when the token became available. It's the toolken life, the Pentecostal life, the Lutheran life, the Wesley. You imagine, you imagine uh Luther looking at the Catholics going, "My God, they have no idea who God is." Then the Wesleys look at the Luther. My God, they don't move on with us. They don't want to move on with us. They're staying in their truth. We know more of God. They don't know God like we know God. And here the Pentecost is looking at the the Wesleyans and the Weslings get denominated in their mind in truth. We got the word God moved in our lives. Hallelujah. Glory to God. And here they look back. The Pentecostals look at them and say, "My God, God has moved on and made himself real and manifested himself." And here comes after 63. Amen. After 63. Amen. The new birth became the token birth became available. And now the bride age came into existence. Amen. And the people that are coming now being born again in the bride age are looking back at Pentecostals. Amen. In this message and saying, "Oh, there's more of God." Amen. And that's what I'm saying tonight. More and more of God. But we got to rot. We got to die to the old system. Amen. We got to march on with truth. &gt;&gt; God, reveal truth to me. Cry out to God. Amen. That's what a baby does. It cries out when it wants something. That bird pecks and pecks and pecks until it pecks way out of it. I'm talking about your understanding. I'm talking about the revelation, the truth in your mind. &gt;&gt; You don't move forward, you're going to be going backwards. You're going to be left behind. This thing is moving forward. And Satan has created such an element where everybody I got the message. I'm I'm I I I believe the truth. I believe the prophet. You're living such a life unconsecrated to God, not surrendered to God, allowing your life to get so busy that you have no time for God. I don't care. I'm going to say it anyways. Hallelujah. I got to work out my own salvation with fear and trembling. Amen. I got to work these things out in my life to make time for God. Amen. I'm not here to explain how for you to make time for God. You got to make time for God. Amen. Amen. Sitting in this message. Oh, we come to church on Wednesday. We come to church on Sunday. Amen. We go to this fellowship, that fellowship. We believe the message. I got prophet uh pictures on my wall. But not moving on with God, allowing becoming complacency in this life. the devil making you lukewarm, making your life powerless. And when emergency comes in your life, when something stirs up your life, you don't know where you're at. You don't know where God is at. Brother Brand, you should be so close with God and so prayed up with God. When an emergency comes, God is right there. &gt;&gt; He's right on the scene, right at that time. There's no question in your heart where God is because you are walking with God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Musicians come. Amen. Glory to God. The token. The last quote here. Hopefully you're sitting down. I know you're tired, but I long day for me. I'm sweating. Hallelujah. I want to feed too. Amen. You must have the token. You say, "I believe everything I'm talking about. I'm going to read it to you. Yes, I go I go to church. I believe the message." That is all right. He says, "That is good." He says, "But you must have the token." See, he's identifying something here. He's dividing dividing things up here. But you must have the token. Do you hear brother Brandham talk tabernacle? Do you hear tabernacle? You must have the token displayed. Without it, all your believing is in vain. What? All you're believing. All you're believing in in everything about this message if that token life has not been birthed. Listen, don't get scared. Don't get nervous. Get seeking. Get praying. Get knocking. Hallelujah. You live a good life. You listen to what the word says. You go to church. You try to live right. That's fine. But that's not it. When I see the blood, the blood is the life. I want the life of God to manifest through my life more than anything. I want the life of God. I cry out night and day in my spirit. It groans night and day for the life of God because I know me and myself. Amen. I am nothing. I am nothing in the flesh. But I cry out for the life of God. More and more of the life. I'm more desperate today than I was 34 years ago when this truth broke open to me. Oh yes, I am. And you better get desperate. He says, if you're not. Hallelujah. That's the token. And the token is here. Just to come this far. come in the message. Believe the message. Believe God sent a prophet just to come this far. He knows the prophet can see in the future and speaks in the future. And I say I believe the message. You obey the message. A lot of people misinterpret that because they obey the law of the message. But listen to what he says. Come into Christ. Obeying the message. Come into Christ. come into this revealed word. Hallelujah. You say, "I believe every word you say." Brother Brandham, all those brother Brandham said, Brother Brandham said, Brother Brandham said that is good. But that's just being able to read. Take the message, take it into your heart that you must have the token. That you must have the token. The very life that was in Christ be inside of you. This is him speaking now. When I see that, I'll pass over you. Oh God. Oh God. Men of God have taken this message after the prophet has gone to place where the bride today can understand this token life in its fullness. But as time moves on, the true ministers take the message onto perfect faith. It must keep going higher until perfect rapture and faith comes. This is me speaking here now. Brother Brand, I'm quoting. I was born again in 1992 when my awakening came. I was born into the seven seal revelation. I didn't understand what it was. No. But it opened up slow and showed me this token life that was changing me over and over the years inside like no other word from a past age could. In other words, the change taking place inside of me was not available. This change here was not available Luther, Wesley or Pentecostal age. Only after the seals open I come to understand and recognize my birth is a seven seal birth that revealed word to bring me into rapture and faith &gt;&gt; for this body change. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what I recognize. &gt;&gt; That's what I see manifesting out of my life. Am I where I want to be? No. Hallelujah. Are you where you want to be? No. But you must see change. You must see truth being opened up. You must see the old thoughts, the old ways, the old system rotten and dying. That's what the spirit does with inside of us. It causes everything to die and rot. Hallelujah. Let us stand. [Music] You know, preaching is only saying certain things a man cannot reveal. Only God can reveal. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I can't reveal. Even all the words I said here tonight, I can't reveal truth to you. It's between you and God and the spirit of God. I trust and believe and hope and pray with all my heart. That's why I get up here or I could be sitting down there with you and having eternal life as the prophets say instead of going through the things that the five-fold ministry goes through. Hallelujah. each one of us go through so that you might be enlightened that your awakening might come. Hallelujah. That God will speak into your hearts. Show you something. Even if he showed you something so simple tonight, don't excuse it. Those are the little things that I received. I'm telling you, little things that I receive that move me forward. Hallelujah. We're always looking for big revelation, big understanding. It's little things. If something little was revealed to you tonight in your life that you got to change or you got to move forward or do something, whatever it is, take that little thing and move on with it. It'll take you to the next step and to the next step. Hallelujah. Father, bless your people. Oh God, in the name of Jesus, this is your people, Lord. We are living. We believe with all our hearts in the token age, the bride age, the capstone age. This is the rapture age, Lord. The perfect faith, perfect realization of who we are. where the bride will recognize who she is and she'll catch a body change, a transformation in her life. Oh God, help each one break the chains. &gt;&gt; Open the prison doors of their understanding and of their minds. Break every tradition. Let all the past teachings of the doctrines of the past age rot inside of them, Lord, and let them bring forth new life, new revealed word life, the token life in this hour. That's the only life that God is producing in this hour. Hallelujah. Grant it Lord. Bless us all, Lord. Bless our pastor, his wife standing in this position. It's all of us as ministers, but to feed the sheep, direct the sheep to the green pastures, Lord. He can't do it without you, Lord. Guide and lead him, Father. Lord, that he may be a part to lead us deeper into this rapture in faith, this token life. Lord, each and every one of the ministers here, bless each and every one. Open up their understanding more and more. I need more light. I need more understanding. &gt;&gt; Oh God, reveal this truth, this light. It's not different. The prophet had it. &gt;&gt; Brother Simon had it. But here we are moving it on forward, Father. That's all. Just vessels. Yield it vessels to you, Father. Move on your truth, Father. Let us just be vessels that you can move it through, Father. In Jesus Christ's name we ask. God bless you, saints. Just what I need is more of you. [Music] Of things I've had my f. But yet I hunger still empty and dead. Lord, hear my prayer for more of you. More of you. Oh, more of you [Music] and more of you. I've had it all. But what I need is more of you. Half of things I've had my feel and yet I hunger empty and g my put up. Lord, my heart is open. for more of you. [Music] Lord, my heart is open. [Music] Won't you come inside?

I've got the life of God in me. &gt;&gt; I've got this life. [Music] &gt;&gt; I've got the life in me. &gt;&gt; I've got the toen with me. I've got the token light in me. I've got the fly to life.

How many enjoy that tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. We just want to remind you of a Sunday service. We're going to have the Lord the communion and Lord supper. on Sunday. Amen. You're dismissed. Complete. Complete. Complete. [Music] We are completely [Music] complete. Complete. Complete. We are complete. There's nothing more that I can do for Jesus paid it all. There's nothing more that I can do.
