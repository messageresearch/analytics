to be here father God I have nothing to say unless you come and speak to help your children help me to take myself out of the way and speak and bless your children the time they are thinking in the rain to be here oh God you promise you never leave us not forsake us so I believe you're not disappointed but you come and speak to us like in the cool of the evening we thank you and we love you in Jesus name amen praise God hallelujah amen the people managed without taking much time so that we can go have three scriptures it's a Bible study so we're gonna read a little bit more it's Genesis chapter 3 verse 1 to 7. Genesis 3 1-7 if you finally say Amen now the second was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and instead of the woman he had God said ye shall not eat of every tree of this garden and the woman said on the serpent he may we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the truth is in the myths of the garden God has said You shall not eat it shall you touch it lest ye die and the serpents of the woman you shall not surely die see right there he's hiding something and substance the word of God for her for God do not know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open it shall be as God's knowing Good and Evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did it and gave us one to a husband with her and he did it and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they saw fake leaves together and made themselves apron that's religious spirit and Revelation 3 14-22 if you're not gonna read all that and unto the angel of the Church of lordisia write this thing say the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I know the rest that thou are never cold not hot I would that were cold or hot so then because now I look warm and neither cold nor hot I was PV out of my mouth because that says I'm rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and no it's not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I canceled you to buy me of gold tried and fire that that must be rich and with remain that that means be close and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint the eyes of the ice ice up that thou may see and as many as I love I rebuke and chasten therefore be zealous and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into them and will support them and heal with me to him that overcome it well I grant to sit with my Throne to mean to me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm now set down with my father in stone he died and he let him hear what the scripture says the last one then that's it Ephesians 5 23 just once one verse Ephesians 5 23. Ephesians chapter 5 verse 23. for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body heavenly father bless the reason of your word in Jesus name amen please be seated if I was supposed if that my title tonight is um the bride does not or will not be satisfied or substitute but original word of God amen the bride will always like the original word of God many of us were in denominations and so many places but the weather receiving we are not good enough for us just like that either on the chicken back Barnyard those those who couldn't satisfy them amen so but one day he hear that voice the right voice at the right time man something in him in hell in him who said this is it amen because you might be the amazing world this church that church Methodist when none of them satisfy the soul where the true word of God for the hour that's what the ego will feed on no any other food he can eat uncontaminated food the vulture can eat everything and eat the good and bad but a true Eagle he will not eat any dead food you want the flesh where the Eagles are guarded the Eagles will be there because the Eagles won the first kill the word for Luther will not satisfy him methodists will not satisfy him even the word of Pentecost that's past will not satisfy him they want the present stage of his ministry because this bride of Christ is a different it's a special bride he is going to take up his flight so he needs the right weather the right time to enable him take that flight amen praise God so when you read in the scriptures you realize that Eve the first um The Bride of Adam was deceived by the devil amen and rahbraham says somewhere that Eve was what she was [Music] um she was craving for phds knowledge she did that for the knowledge for wisdom because all that was he was craving for and then one thing is when she recognized him her and the husband recognized that they were naked they tried to what cover themselves and I'm going to read this for a short time the Bible tells us when we've done number one the Bible says that when we've done wrong that we should Purge our souls by the Holy Spirit get down let the Holy Spirit reveal to us that we are done wrong and they stay before him till you die out purging our souls now they have turned around give you a purgatory after you are dead then the priest makes a lot of money to pray you out of purgatory why is Nancy's that's what the canker worm done sure pray out of purgatory caused so many hundred dollars to get his soul prayed out of the Purgatory I want to even find Purgatory in the Bible anything like it there is no such a thing in the Bible but they give them a Purgatory see after you are dead oh yes I know amen Hallelujah so what has happened is that when some people when they do something wrong instead of making things right they try to go around it your sin cannot be covered unless you repent and make things right if you do you've done somebody wrong go to that person make it right before you go to God there's so many people unless the thing is is dealt with is gonna be there all the time so you have to go and make it right and repent I wonder where is there those times repentance people crying before God for their mistakes amen because when the word of God touches your heart it's softens and Mellows the heart the Bible said a contract and a broken spirit I will not despise it's time that we come back to the basis and do things right repent and don't hold grudges forgive one another you have brothers senses he said don't hold anything your heart against anybody regardless of what they have done to you go to them make things right and God will make a way for you because little foxes is spoil the van little things that we don't take care of it grow to be big so anything that you have to deal with you have to deal with it now deal with that situation don't brush it off amen and what other thing that Adam elevates they cover themselves we have a lot of religious covering that people cover themselves on religion they cheat they lie they do everything by the covet of religion and um our Pastor said that it has been coming to this message religious covering I said all kind of mean spirit I hiding in the form of religion amen and they won't try to make things right they won't try to repent because it comes back to the seed amen so we have a lot of religious covering and that Spirit runs all the way from Genesis and went back to um Judas this Same Spirit and Judas was a trustee a church member um the one who takes off the money and he was still stealing God's money you have a lot of people cheating lying doing all kind of mean things but it's still hiding in religion religious Spirits pastor says it goes so bad that he has taking all the money of the of the what of the of the church that when it came for the taxman came to Jesus to pay taxes he didn't bother himself to ask Judas about any money he said go and look for the face a direct face to go and he told them where to go to get a face so that I can get money towards to pay for it and what I'm trying to say tonight Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever whatever you have need of God knows where to find that fish if you have desire in your heart to win souls whoever God has whatever Souls they're gonna pass through you to win a face to God God knows it you have to dedicate yourself you have to ask God to direct you that face that God needs the natural and spiritual face both of them you have to compound to both your natural and spiritual face wherever they are he told Peter where to cast The Net he knows where to cast The Net now will bring you the right face at the right time that will bring results because remember in the book of us nobody just joined the church until God and then so if you sincerely pray and your heart is right God will bring the right face the right job the rightness the right thing he is able he knows where they are you know the Bible said that Elijah prayed earnestly that should not Reign for three and a half years and did not rain he prayed again it rained he said that he was subject to like touching like we are it means that he has mistakes but I didn't look at his fault but he prayed sincerely the angel of God told by Abraham if you'll be sincere nothing can stand before you amen so we have to be sincere we have to be earnest sometimes we have to be desperate we live in a causing life no wonder God's gonna call persecution on the church because the persecution will let you pray more sometimes he allow those things to come to our life the prophet said that when that um that Widow that Elijah um he bake him a cake face that that woman got to a place that was nothing for her to eat and she knew if nothing happens she's going to die with her son she said that that that gets your door somewhere you're gonna your prayers will change because we have causing life that God wants us to what be more sincere he said that the angel terrific can be more sincere just pray endlessly not just five minutes time when you sleep no we got to prayer but I know that we pray all the time a Christian is praying all the time um person that wish a Christian pray everywhere lifting holy hands we know we're praying all the time even your mind your thoughts 24 hours you praying a true bride of Christ but there are certain situations we need to set a time alone with God sometimes God wanted to set a time aside to spend time alone with him so that he will come and confirm and vindicate what you are talking about he will never leave you nor forsake you he's the same yesterday today and forever amen so let's just trust God hey man what I'm trying to say substitute will never make it we did the original thing amen and when I got my knees they covered themselves with their own religion of figurines God said no this was no way you can't even go to the presence of God with your own words with your own ideas he said my first ahead and your thoughts by ways ahead and your ways you got to come by his way it's his own ideas you have to try to your own thoughts and let his thought let the mind of Christ be in you so that God can reveal to you so that he will direct your thoughts he will direct your ways commit your wisdom to God and he will bring it to pass they will give you the desires of your heart let it stress be my way I want God's way to be my way not my own rebate his way that's what the bride of Christ needs amen so they are self-covering religion will not work and God has to kill the first lamp so that the blood of Christ I think let me read you a little bit here um if I can find it verse 239 the restoration of the bright tree now this little canker worm begin to bore himself into the back what did he do he began to take the religion is covering is Doctrine away from it religion is a Doctrine a covering that covers anything that's the reason our religion is taught is blood the blood the life is in the blood that covers the word and the life is in the blood the blood is religion and the life is in the blood is what brings the results while you see it's not covered by fake leaves Adam and you've tried that one time can't do the same thing did you notice that Cain brought some of the botany life too see but it didn't work it didn't work with Adam and Eve and it won't work today when God refused it at the beginning it's refused for eternity man-made Chris and thus will never take it hey my soul your own words to not he has to be what the blood sacrifice and when King was told to bring uh do the sacrifice he did exact same thing he did his own way the Fig Leaf he taught God to accept it but God refused it but Able by revelation offered an excellent sacrifice and God testified of his gift would that Revelation you cannot please God the letter killed by the spirit given life amen because every state must bring forth of his kind somewhere he said that he can't try to do everything but he had a wrong seat on him that wrong State cannot bring a good sacrifice it will not cannot bring better sacrifice it has to be a right seed and with the rising to bring the right sacrifice and God will testify of his gift he sees in you in back of this I used to think what was it that made Peter able to say that blood blood will say that this is it you understand of the Living God what makes them even the woman that the world to recognize that what made all those people act different what was it that came to that Hebrew children and said that even if you perish we'll perish but you're not going to bow down to this and then I became so quiet with the seed of God in them if they have their right seed so it doesn't matter how much persecution they receive brother Abraham and even job when they get the end of the road there was something in them that came up and said that the lord giveth and the Lord taken blessed be the name of those there's something because they have the right thing so no matter how that they're going to be pressurized no matter what will come out to them that rice seed will come up will come forth and say the writing at the right time to bring their right results because it's the seed that matters is there seed oh that's why he said that let all of them grow together they're written the test he will come you don't touch it he'll come and do I say if you try to take that the test away from the original one you're gonna destroy some of the wheat so let them all grow together and I will come and I'll take those that are strong and bend them and take the right one to myself he's the same yesterday today and forever it has to be the right sea that it will break the right results amen praise God God is under for God he's an awesome God he's the same yesterday to them forever he has never lost a battle amen praise our God thank you amen and even the Lord God himself when he gave them example of that animals the blood of the goals and of the sheep and all those things those were substituting means a replacement it was the original blood because human life you all know that is higher than the animal life so even though those animals were good they were good for a certain time up to a certain point it didn't have that and that original thing instead to take them to Eternity it can only do to up to a certain point it wasn't that um what did I say it wasn't that original so he couldn't take this thing from because remember those people when they go back within a year they went back with the same design they are there is no change amen so they were all looking for that Redemption the world looks something is not right we need that original blood who gonna bring that plan how can we get that blood and they look at themselves nobody was worthy Abraham Moses nobody that when the cry went out there was no one holy God himself the original God has to come down in the form of man to fill our infirmities to feel what we are going through to see how his his children sons and daughters are going through and to share that original blood and that blood was said once and for all and when it was said that hell and Grave were defeated yes sir because what Paul said that great where is your stink that was something means that crave death also death was just think death used to sting before that time it was a stinger but when Christ shed his blood death has no single again cannot sing anymore why is this Victory bro it's gone that thing is gone because Christ himself not a second person God that created the entire universe he came and said that original life the original blood so right now you don't have to worry anymore because he was wounded for your transgression he was bruised for your iniquities the chastisement of his peace was upon Him of the stripes you were healed he said I am the Lord God that he left all your disease not some this is all your disease so if you have any sickness just bring you to the altar let God deal with it you have to accept your healing and confess I'm Healed don't look at your circumstance God faith loose beyond what you can even see feel of such Faith goes beyond that feeling it goes beyond that the what you are seeing or what the what the doctor is saying because the doctors remember he is doing the best that he can he go by what his what his instruments tell him but we are dealing with unseen God a God that knows everything and God has that oh man he's just speak one word and everything changed but you can't force God's hands but he come come when he wants to in his own time he can speak change everything amen so we we are so privileged that we have a god like that that lovers and care for us that he shared his blood he said scarcely with any friend who will give his life to his his mother or brother but he came that love is beyond human everybody's compression and share that blood and what that happened all those who died who are in Paradise they were looking for that um job and other right said I know my redeemer liveth even though skin worm destroyed this place despite this but in my flesh I will see God they all saw by The Rapture so they were looking to him and when that thing happened he was able to go and take them all set the captains free and throw their keys from the devil's hand and make him a toothless that's why I love the song that my my son used today I went to enemies camp and I took back what he stole from me Satan I stand under my feet amen whatever that the conqueror's eating God said I will restore said the Lord whatever you have lost it's time for restoration it's time to restore everything because he has promised us he restore everything your faith then the devil tried to eat your faith try to bring things to bring this situation to just make you faithless God said Iris child the faith I won the all-time religion because when that blood of Christ was said he came on that one like 120 in there Pentecost those who waited for him but remember all those substitute spirit just do that Spirit could not go towards Pentecost because they can just come all the way but they can't come to the right to receive the right path the right thing so when the when he came that God himself was coming to dwell inside of them and live his life through them that you that Spirit couldn't get there so it faced with our message that we have all those of judah's spirit all those impersonators they cannot make up the Rapture because the final goal is the rapture we are going to a Rapture the true bride and Seed of God we are growing the Rapture I believe I'm one of them you believe you're one of them amen that those will do that Spirit they can come near it amen so what happened they have Pentecost they receive God multiply himself and even though he multiply himself and he himself said that no one can join unless God lead them and let God permit them to be part after the Pentecost the church grow and grow then we have that Anonymous and the Safari spirit just lying demons because remember God knows everything one time I was telling somebody remember you deal with a Believer you deal with God here you have to be honest because he knows everything you can't hide but they forgot they think that they were going to deceive Peter and the rest because you know when ananias when Barnabas by Revelation he brought all his land everything that he had those people were going to be impersonators then God has not revealed to him what he has to do but he was just following what analyzed with that Revolution so him and his wife conspired to just keep a little portion here and then just go when Peter told him you perished with it before you brought it it was yours so you can just do whatever you have for that so God don't want people who try to hide and see it and try to hide from the people and try to bring all kind of schemes and all those Spirits God wants you to get rid of all that and get rid of that so that God can deal with them Pastor preacher sermon about baptismal fire it's on the day of Pentecost when the fire of God came he said fire what will fire you do it's like to pray with fire going to burn you there's some people they are not ready they have to watch give themselves up so that the fire of God that Pentecost and that baptism fire will burn every trace of sin will burn everything like God so that God can have full prominence and flow through them and do his job this old this corner here I gave you this but this corner is for me this is my sickness oh this is my uh my sickness this my this I am this you're not willing to lay it down so that God will bend that thing and flow through them so what is happening they have all those and a nice spirits and the going here during this doing that where God don't want that spirit he won a Christian that will Allah himself to let God deal with your heart deal with your conscience deal with everything that he have that full preeminence and flow through the bride of Christ and live his life through you again because remember I promise that the words that I do so you also do whilst he was still on his ethnic Ministry couldn't do everything so it's the bride of Christ we are the one to continue that job amen said the weather I do shall you also do when you lay your hands on the stick they shall recover hey man he gave us those Authority those power so when your son your daughter is saying lay your hands on them pray over them you don't have to wait for the team person you can pray first and then you call the group world to enforce the Holy Ghost and first and for all of them because one will cast a thousand two which is two thousand ten thousand so the majority will bring more best you have to go to work you have to pray you have to do the thing and God will do the rest he's the same yesterday today and forever God has never changed amen what am I saying today tonight so is the all-time I read this for quick here yeah I think the same thing okay there's the three verse um paragraph 44 States shall follow them that are believers not make Believers because they may believe us they they don't want to go all the way far they are making believe that's why the description I read he said either you are hot or cold God doesn't want um those who are in between you have to be cold or hot that's why the prophet told is saying that if you will be a bomb I want to be the best bomb be the best of everything you are doing this thing is no time to play it's life and death the thing is just at the end of the I just had a point when you're getting the end of the pyramid is getting smaller and smaller the light feel so a God in you will do it I understand that but you have a path to do is also surrendering heart because some people they are God's children but the problem of it is they don't have the joy of their salvation because of little things is keeping them from to have the job the establishing because he promised that I'll give you what three redemption in three parts but this story and spirit when God delivered God doesn't do a halfway job he delivered him from all aspects all three of them but if you refuse like those tribe that refuse to go over the Jordan is there a choice they refuse to stay there nobody can force you but if you really want he's willing to bring you to that place amen so these things I do you will also do it and vindicate that you are a Believer just the same as the words that I done because the living father lives in me it aren't me that read the work you can do it it's my father and it won't be you during the rest it will be me in you doing the rest see now you're going to all the way otherwise you are going to form what is known to be as a bride see I'll go with you you'll be part of me you'll be my bride my life will be will be in your body just like a husband and wife is one person you and I are going to work to be one at that day you know that I am in the father the father in me and I in you and you in me just love that said all that God was he poured into what into Christ and all that Christ was important to the bride so we have all of fullness of godliness remember it says that the baptism of the um justification gave way to sanctification sanctification gave way too baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost himself which is God himself in their bride riding the trails once more he is in the bride right in the tree is no more um any other person um I went to Ghana I didn't even know I just I just recently I got it from the from the from the tips I went there and I went to preach in a church that God helped brother coffee to set up Pastor has been there Michael's Church whilst I was preaching I was telling them I'm not serving a God on the wall what good is historical God to me if he cannot do anything that he did back then he's the same yesterday to them forever so I'm not serving a dead God I'm serving a living God whilst I was talking in that fashion all of a sudden I saw commotion everybody is going outside the church the members were saying they were going out because it was a small it's the inside situation the church hasn't grown yet if it were to be here the big things the Dickens will take over so the Pastor said they should come when they came they came with a a boy about seven eight years had something called conversion it's like like and you can see these guys like lifeless and then they brought him to me and then I prayed for him it's like nothing happened so I told him to put the child somewhere and I began to preach but I could see I could feel they were looking at the child at me so I was in panic something came on me and I told them that I am not a Healer nobody can heal anybody only Jesus Christ is the Healer he's the same yesterday to them forever and then he will do it in his own time he's on time God he may not come when you want him to be but he'll be there right on time so I began to live Jesus Christ that and all because all everybody attention went on Jesus and I will leave Dr Jesus up you lift Jesus up by the time we phrase the service a kid who was almost lifeless could not drink could not do anything he began to drink he began to walk he began to run and then people came for me to pray for them and I didn't understand and then I realized that in that situation God did not want me to be like the one getting the glory because he That Glory belongs to him so he permitted that way and then later I came I was reading the listening the message and Brad Brown was saying that so many times when the people come the prayer line if because like they are looking at to him as he's the one doing something but when without even the prayer line when he's speaking and the people receive it without coming top they gave the glory to God because they know no man can't touch them but God himself touched them so it's the same yesterday forever God could have done anything well because just let me pray and let the guy raise up and then give him glory but in that situation he chose for me to let the people put their faith in Christ so that in future when they get into situation they will call on that God come on the scene and heal them he is the same yesterday today and forever amen praise God hallelujah so what am I saying that sanctification gave way to baptist the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost the Baptist great word the Holy Ghost himself so now is Christ himself riding the trail is no more anybody's hand is Christ during the works again amen Hallelujah I'm gonna read this um it's in there I pick up my pen to write this one is the spoken word he will now here's what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction bring forth of its kind Genesis 1 living this life is the true church bright Comes The Headstone will be a super Church a super race as the nearest the great headstone there will be much foreign foreign but before he could marry her she had fallen answers for she was put to bring more ideas like Adam's wife was to believe God's pray the release or doubt it and died then from a little group of Truth is version of his way and through them and by them will be
