[9:33] couple weeks ago a young girl crying out
[9:36] for one of her best friends that was
[9:39] contemplating
[9:41] suicide and was you know desperate in
[9:45] her condition and we took it to prayer

[9:52] very wonderful testimony of Victory amen
[9:56] that the Lord really touched the girl
[10:01] she's no longer thinking about
[10:04] suicide some of the people that were
[10:07] were um you know causing the problems
[10:10] you know these days social media and
[10:13] bullying and you know people can say
[10:15] things that can literally cause our
[10:18] young people to get into desperate
[10:21] situations where they they want to take
[10:22] their lives can you imagine and it's one
[10:24] of the major causes of teen suicide
[10:27] today
[10:29] but yet some of the people that did The
[10:32] Bullying actually went back and
[10:36] apologized why because God was asked to
[10:41] come on SE and now all these raised up
[10:44] hands here in this house I know I got
