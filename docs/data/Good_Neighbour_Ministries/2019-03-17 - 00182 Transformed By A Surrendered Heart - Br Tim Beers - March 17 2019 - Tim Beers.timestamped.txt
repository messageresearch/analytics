[0:11] about that make us realize that the
[0:14] kingdom has come and that's why we come
[0:17] here tonight to hear his word not only
[0:23] in the letter form that I could speak in
[0:25] that you can understand but in the
[0:28] spirit form
[0:29] where he interprets to you and makes his
[0:32] word come to life and what that does is

[0:39] seeds when it falls on the ground if
[0:41] your ground has been your hearts been

[3:19] these are the vessels that brother
[3:21] Graham talked about that will
[3:23] this message to make a slope here I
[3:26] thought I need a message like that
[3:28] because I think that a part of my
[3:30] experience part my discernment my walk
[3:32] not only just the desert what's out
[3:34] there but the desert this it causes me
[3:37] to see this that I'm not a part of
[3:40] Ezekiel 37 we'll start at the first
[3:45] verse familiar Scripture then we're
[3:48] going to go to Hebrews 4:12 amen
[3:56] pray to God give me strength tonight
[3:59] just about him had a couple hours to
[4:00] think in Chicago as soon as I leave the
[4:03] pulpit on the whole not a minute the
[4:11] hand of the Lord was upon me and carried
[4:14] me out in the Spirit of the Lord has
[4:16] sent me down in the midst of the valley
[4:19] which is full of bones and caused me to
[4:22] pass by them roundabout and behold there
[4:26] were very many in the open Valley and lo
[4:30] they were very drunk and he said unto me
[4:33] son of man can these bones live and I
[4:37] asked her Oh Lord God found Lois and
[4:39] again he said unto me prophesy unto
[4:42] these bowls that say unto them o a dried
[4:44] bones hear the word of the Lord thus
[4:48] saith the Lord God onto these bowls
[4:51] behold because breath enter into you and
[4:54] he shall live and I will they see new
[4:58] upon you and bring up flesh upon you and
[5:03] cover you with skin and put breath in
[5:07] you and he shall live and ye shall know
[5:09] that I'm the Lord and so my prophesied
[5:14] as I was commanded and as I prophesied
[5:19] there was a noise and behold shaken and
[5:23] the bones came together bone to his home
[5:26] and when I beheld the scene
[5:31] and the clefts came upon them and the
[5:35] skin covered them about but there was no
[5:38] breath in them then said he unto me
[5:43] prophesy unto the winds prophesy Son of
[5:46] Man has stayed to the wind thus saith
[5:49] the Lord God come from the four winds o
[5:52] breath and breathe upon the slain that
[5:56] they may live
[5:58] so I prophesied as he commanded me and
[6:00] the breath came up to them and these
[6:03] live and stood upon their feet with
[6:07] exceeding an extremely great army then
[6:12] he said up to me son of man these bones
[6:15] are the whole house of Israel behold
[6:18] they say our bones are dried our hope is
[6:22] LOX we are cut off from our parts
[6:24] therefore prophesy and say unto them
[6:27] thus saith the Lord God behold all my
[6:30] people I will open your graves I will
[6:33] cause you to come up out of your brain
[6:35] and bring you into a land of Israel and
[6:38] they shall know that i am the lord when
[6:40] i have opened your graves all my people
[6:43] have brought you out of your graves and
[6:46] shall put my spirit in you and ye shall
[6:50] live and i shall place in you in your
[6:54] old man and then shall ye know that i am
[6:57] the lord that has spoken it and

[18:00] only but in power which means that
[18:05] kingdom of God it's not only word but

[19:11] the speakers of all the ages compare
[19:15] them for what they have said to what God
[19:18] has said all their words would be a
[19:21] sound the prostitute Ingo single day man
[19:24] there has never been an individual or
[19:27] group whose words carry more authority
[19:31] than God's word for us by the work of
[19:36] the worlds were framed and came into
[19:39] existence yes my brothers and sisters
[19:42] the world has the power of the chains
[19:46] like the bird instructs us to live
[19:55] righteous there are no words spoken or
[20:01] written that have the same effect as the
[20:04] power of God's work nothing amen
[20:11] the author begins by stating that God's
[20:14] Word is quick which means we don't got a

[29:59] blinking at this outlet it is not going
[30:02] to be empty glory to God again
[30:10] let's use the word emptiness
[30:26] in the was in us today God sent that
[31:03] word who became flesh the desert it was
[31:07] productive
[31:09] did Jesus accomplish everything when he
[31:13] was on this earth everything that he was
[31:16] supposed to absolutely he purchased our
[31:19] salvation he paid our Redemption he
[31:22] suffer the penalty of that
[31:24] and paid the price for physical healing
[31:27] and peace of mind and prosperity you see
[31:30] the work for us see that scripture - you
[31:52] and me - abroad this hour we're not
[31:57] gonna be empty of anything we're not

[32:22] as a child of God we have responses
[32:27] enough for just being the years of the
[32:30] work but Duggars also that's the power
[32:34] of the scripture is there so many there
[32:37] just be tears they're not taking this
[32:41] word and apply it with your lives
[32:43] they're not taking this word and the
[32:47] sacrifice that changed sometimes when
[32:51] you hear the word of God and revelation
[32:53] to strengthen your heart the sacrifice
[32:55] the dying out the surrender of for
[33:00] singing
[33:00] amen that it takes to bring this word
[33:04] aliveness the preparation that it takes
