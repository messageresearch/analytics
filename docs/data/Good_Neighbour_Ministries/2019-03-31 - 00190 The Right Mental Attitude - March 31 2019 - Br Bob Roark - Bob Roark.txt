and what what is in our area know for me to like this a lot of lot of it was a lot of spiritual auction any matters and here here this morning your fruit of his legs what he is talk not only topic but what he is exemplified were you and thus her degree knows you're a very generous congregation of people thank you to say the very least I enjoyed Saturday morning with brothers that were able from the big event or perhaps the only day of the week that they had risked additionally and which was sure that risk would be me thank you so much the recipient of a Bureau of your economist just appreciate it so very much once again you're a very generous very kind and thoughtful group of people they the first song that the mic was leading you in was about a dangerous country think of the billions of dollars that are spent cosmetic for people to or the partisans their very ancient process it is because people appreciate you and the bigger the spray for the visions and that of youth holes and and it's very comforting very very cover to realize that when Bertha Wilson impre-- comes in a few weeks he has been asked before because now I know anyone that perhaps brother side can plant every my brother was introduced and he super you know that and he just loves to worship up for solo lasting whatever use all the weight you're dancing and playing the tambourine and there's just what are you doing this so much he said well can we spend and read over just a few scriptures and Mike it's not let me forget perhaps make this statement about all these wooden table Kevin Murphy a husband a lot of you we turn to first Peter chapter three verse number ten and if this was kind of the wording that this was put in in a question for interrogative there's not a human being that has the ability to think that was not the answer in the Huracan do you love Molly do you love good days you know so often at least in America perhaps I'm not indicating to you personally whether the human community how are you doing how's your day going oh it's a bad day now you may have not ever said that you have said it yesterday but this is presented to us or he think we'll love life and see good days here is the the the solution to that the answer let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no God let him refrain his tongue from evil and ladies live speak of God Heavenly Father thank you for this morning thank you for brothers and sisters silently thank you for the incredible leadership has story shield the agape love that emanates from them and thank you for the the Sheep of what that is present this morning that is in those that is allowing the shipper d24 of the oven forged in action father we thank you made the grade of eternity not only come here in life is a word in every individual heart but wherever you're elected ones and redeemed laws are gathered together may the great of heaven we so profoundly present and providing the Amen of the Word of God to every individual and their particular needs and situations and this has been a staple of my attitude not only to the Lord important but it's a staple in my attitude about life and this is what I said from the amplified record for we are God's handiwork his workmanship recreated in christ jesus born anew but we may do those good works which God predestined both for us taking paths which he prepared ahead of time that really greatly the past that he prepared ahead of time this was not randomly done this was done in eternity he meant that we should walk in them that we should live it been living the good life which he prearranged and made ready for us later humans have this propensity to justify what our if it's a a condition applied in our life with we it's not hard to find justifiable causes justifiable reasons of that we were experiencing what we're experiencing but when we put that up against Scripture and this is what God's attitude toward you toward his children and you'll hear brother Gilbert all the kids toward his kids soon that is his attitude toward your life toward my life and maybe this attitude kind of emanates and has its roots in the price that was paid on behalf of our us the price that Calvary was affording at Calvary in order for your life to be retained ransom reconcile or it was God in Christ reconciling the world on that your Center that was a legal work may be done a justifiable the legal work and there's nothing that enemy can do about this Satan has absolutely no grounds or in doing actually much of what he does today puffins are bragging about no means so let's look at the Sun some of the statements the scripture provides about this entity the closer of God and humanity would you mind pokin with me in Hebrews chapter 2 verse 14 and if you don't mind just to keep the mind we'll cut the hand ending with you and we'll look at a few other places in scripture I realized that but I read these over and over again it was said Michael Jordan of basketball thing and that he would it would be hours into those hours as we would say in the genome price practice and we've all expense most of the statement that practice makes perfect only fits perfect and it's a perfect of course it'll sort of imperfection now this is this is an astounding statement to me because growing up around wonderful people Christians godly people I did this and look at these marvelous and majestic works since therefore these his children share in flesh and blood in the physical nature of human beings he misses God himself in a similar manner vertook of the same nature that by going through death he might bring to know and they of no effect him who had the power of death that is the devil [Music] yeah I'm from the country so a part of speech that we heard but all were correct or incorrect was no it means zero so if you want to replace the word not a word zero and see how that sounds by going through death he pipe dream to zero and make up make them nor that him who had the power of death that is now this is God's attitude toward your mind it's his attitude toward his enemy this attitude is based upon what he accomplished fully thoroughly he doesn't have to go back there's no need no requirement I feel going back who called him down who will summons him up according to Romans chapter 10 they there is absolutely no mean event the work has been done so absolutely thoroughly be brought to zero and you may say he's he's still around and served without mister and disagree but in the heart the mind of God which we can develop into this understanding that this culprit has been brought reduced to zero first John chapter 3 verse number eight and if you're very worried together but he convinced and and this can be a really where people kind of trip up stuff it is it is safe you practice whatever that sin would be it's your practicing that if it's like a baby or something that is eventual so that is what the word probably say he who commits in our practices is about the devil takes his character from the evil one for the devil send violated divine law from the beginning the reason the Son of God was they benefits our visible was in human flesh was to hunted and this is the nebula do one to the King James use of the word is growing that were destroying and great things done to do destroying loosen this hop the works of the monkey is about amen there's a story that I read I'll share with you it's told of a prince it was born to a great royal family when the prince is five years old his father the King took the boy with him on a journey into a far country during the journey their shield struggle brief and the entire crew and passengers were thrown into that angry waves near the terminal and rescue effort threats will save by Nady from the nearby hydrants the team was unaware the rescue and the little prince was now separated from his royal family he became a member of the village grew up unaware of his royal heritage now as I read this surely we can use each other to us he learned the think and way of what the natives and and accepted and accepted this last lifestyle as his own in his poverty and simple life he was not made aware that he was from a wealthy family of us past and was heir to the royal kingdom of his father in fact he became a slave to the culture customs stead and standards of the community in which he found himself evils of royal prince living Thunder impoverished conditions I wonder if we the whole Christian community are someone that they are that they know very happy he did not know where he came from where he was why he was born what he was capable of are his rightful claim to be king he lived his life vastly along his inherent privileges not knowing the answers to the critical questions of his life his identity his heritage his purpose potential and destiny now someone many years ago said what you do is self I don't think what they said as as being critical they're just nothing used to be this is what for the brand said oh we forget what we are we forget many times what made us and what we are after we become what we are then we forget how we got here the messenger goes on to say of another this is a he said now if we are born of our Heavenly Father God the Paul's the things which be not which are not as though they work there is going to be something in us like that would you love our reread that because the things which are not as though they work there is going to be something in us can we look in the Bible at James chapter number two three minutes in first one that brother chapter longer in verse 26 it says they've had among you seem to be religious and Brotherhood not his tongue looking to seize his all heart in other words he believes something down here but his mouth is saying something that is contrary to what is the nature of God any of bullies so therefore there is a deception process that has taken place in chapter 3 once again I was gripped with these metaphors that have been provided in this chapter I trust that it will be a blessing to you brethren be not many masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation for it many things we have it all but if any man offend nothing murder the same is a perfect man complete and they will also deprive the whole body and there is a connection of the hole we put pins and here's the metaphors before we put bits and the horse's mouth I'm assuming that you and a lot of videos it's something about this long and it goes it's part of the heart and it goes in their mouth now we put this in the horse's mouth that they may go play us and we turn about their whole body once again the map has an absolute or a direct connection to the body it provides a direction for ever that individual that is behind wherever they're building all the shifts which though they be so preeminent driven by fierce winds yet they are turned about with a very small L whithersoever the governor the captain listen so once again here is the metaphor here is yes and what it does and has the ability to do to the horse and a horse when I think of a horse thinking of a pony I'm thinking of a convert the Kentucky Derby pack horse I'm thinking of a workhorse that is strong muscular and you're able to direct that animal father if it's in its mouth and you're thinking when up is it provides the shoe I'm uh thinking of a fishing problem I'm thinking of something that would be blocking a cruise ship where there's 1,500 2,000 people you see and here's a small instrument that is steering that huge ocean-going like you know the metaphor is concerning our our our words do do our words have any meaning whatsoever to do they do they have any significance about them because a lot of times we're just loose with our words well let's look at that one statement as Jesus was speaking in mark chapter of the program we're twenty reference this he said you're getting into private material of verse twenty-three in mark chapter 11 first twenty two above it says have faith in God Jesus Antron says that does they only have faith in God they have actual written very Greek the Greek is have the faith of God or have the god-kind of faith and he was on top of truth our early I said to you that whosoever shall say over this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and come up down in his heart but shall believe that those things which he said shall come the pastiche of that bolts whoever he says and we'll just pop us up there for the moment here this kind of mirrors of what James is saying it's something small but it produces some the results are magnanimous now the the mountain that was possibly perhaps in the Mount of the Lord when he was speaking this it may be he that the mountain has been created because of words the Institute works can remove mountains and create very calm to create balance and Regan optimizing all we're doing in this great ability and gift that God has placed within his children that we have the ability that Jesus awesome whosoever shall say now pray and be passed out to sea and down now technologies are but shall believe if this varies a ratio of three to one saying to believing so what perhaps a point in brother sister what I believe what you believe not only comes by hearing but it also comes pasta say [Music] say for instance now if if you were really than the environment say your early years years of childhood working where there was the environment that also really help that great maybe use your father I can relate that my father just never he just did not know how to show in any kind of affection whatsoever maybe he never encouraged never remember giving an encouraging word justify myself but usin as an illustration so I grew up with a sense of insecurity I grew up with the sense of inferiority it was very easy for me to just freak they did not like to like to be called upon and so I grew up with that kind of mentality about myself and only maybe not still deal with that today maybe you're an adult and you still deal with that if you've definitely at all so but the Word of God has been extremely instrumental in delivery of be from you know everybody else is better than you are and if you see one sailor and everyone else is better than I this would be my courage brother Simon you can do it but Bob can't you see that would be not not approach from from the angle that I've just described to you so the Bible says that what I believe and the more that I say I would say really the voice of the Father said about me and you thought to yourself you have your lips your points due to sound out reset them of what God said about [Music] you see brother sister it's going to develop real thing and you up over and over again as you declare it verbally your mental attitude toward the promises of God that brother Brown was the first one that said that I think from the head that posture was the first one that set high spec but they will put some threads and from branham was given by the master of the stage as it were of where that could be they embrace perhaps more so than from brother Bosworth now it going back to first Peter if you love life and you want to see good days this is what you do refrain your top story that up better earth this well no minister in America he's had a city that hold the meeting and I'm assumed by how the story and the content noticed that this this individual just probably off the street a local set up set up equipment of the stage and what happened so he that he stayed for the meeting and of course he was sitting in the river in most of the platforming the minister was telling him of the congregation the Word of God God is a good God he doesn't do the things that is blame noting and and they got interrupted to minister cities you need to tell me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the sword and spear has two inches that's going and it [Music] [Applause] folks you just heard that from [Music] that is precious I know I don't want to seem overbearing with that particular statement of the word of God but our performing a probe is exactly precisely correct they meant it to that now let's look at second Corinthians chapter 10 verse 3 through 5 this is okay chapter 10 verse 8 o critics verse number 3 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons plural of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations image I come from a family of failures image I'll never succeed I'll never try I'll never help joy testing down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God perhaps there was someone in your family tree they not very earthly of a devastating condition cancer or Alzheimer's or something like all that nature and here we're saying that's in the genes of my earthly family and we begin to image that out that I'm gonna fall driving like this tragedy is don't do those kind of images our embankment or the powers of destruction they are for a it draws that those demonic forces casting down the casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and God is the work against the knowledge of the work that Hosea 4:6 people are destroyed or they are cut off is the group meaning of that work they are cut off because of lack of knowledge you see knowledge is pre-eminently importantly testing down imaging or imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of the world against the work of God and bringing into captivity every thought now this is possible it is possible you think well it's it's possible but not probable to me it is possible in a process of development in our growth this is absolutely possible [Music] and with you absorb more of this one is the creator in that in that statement I don't think if you find weakness in that state you did not follow your investing BG's the progenitor in the process I'll be change and actually in the grief this is what of that that means guests in them every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of the world if its meaning to lift up your eyes to look up to lift up your voice and what that is to say is that these imaginations they may be blue so large then they become cemented in our minds and in our thoughts and that week we are they tower above us and then we're parsing what we're seeing and so therefore these things become strong holes and the Word of God will help us in mark chapter 5 you don't have to turn that you can put it down for later reference if you would like and here is a district 9 lady called the one with issue of blood she's been she's died in curve amen yeah and she'd spent all that she had and she was growing worse and that was her attitude early worse I'm growing worse many minutes godly people have that attitude today things are worse her works things are no matter it works but when she heard the word great of a transformation that took place in their activity there was a marvelous transformation she began to say instead I'm growing worse or it's worth to begin to say I'm going to this fellow that I've heard about and if I can touch his clothes I'll be faithful and the amplifi said she kept saying it she said she kept saying that her faith prepared her and the nothing is saved what she believed they propelled her to go through the crap press you know it was not easy until she and we don't think Sun comfortable but her attitude changed from one of her own works to one I can touch in mark chapter 4 there was a statement released from the mouth of the master said let's go over to the other side in the boats and they were boat and they were on their way to the other side now to me it would be simple will never occur whatever come up between a big loss there would behave a word that would have anchored in our soul and that is but obviously there was not a taker and their attitude was one of perish and they have looked the Word of God on the ship and he said oh you of little faith where is your faith another writer explicitly their attitude toward the worker God was a very very poor when it's considered of what they were experiencing numbers chapter 13 younger very familiar of the stories the story of the reconnaissance that had gone into spy of the land and that the reported in brought back to the people
