[5:13] trouble.

[5:19] thee.

[6:01] anointed.
[6:03] He will hear him from his holy heaven
[6:06] with the saving strength of his right
[6:09] hand. Some trust in chariots and some in
[6:14] horses, but we will remember the name of
[6:17] the Lord our God.

[14:55] the light. Amen. But this morning, if I
[14:58] could but touch
[15:01] [Music]
[15:02] the hem of his garment,
[15:07] if I could but touch
[15:12] some part of his robe,
[15:17] I know I'd be here.
[15:22] My sins are forgiven.
[15:27] If I could baptize him, I know I'd be
[15:31] home. Somebody sing it over him. If I
[15:35] could baptize
[15:38] in the hem of his garment.
[15:44] If I could baptize
[15:48] some part of his world,
[15:53] I know I'd be here.
[15:58] My sins are forgiven.
[16:03] If I could baptize him, I know I sing it
[16:07] again.
[16:08] Yes. Lord, if I could baptize
[16:15] some part of his.

[16:53] garment this morning and receive
[16:55] whatever he has for you?
[16:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I believe he has something
[16:59] for us this morning that is uh beyond
[17:02] anything that we've ever had up until
[17:04] now by the grace of God. Amen. So, we're
[17:08] going to pray this morning and and
[17:10] invite him. He's here. It's a kind of an
[17:14] oxymoron kind of a thing. We know that
[17:16] he's here, but we're going to ask him to
[17:18] bless and to do what? Have his way. How
[17:22] many want him to have his way? Yes,
[17:24] Lord.
[17:27] &gt;&gt; We know our place in this service
[17:30] and we know his place in this service.
[17:33] Let him have his place in us this
[17:37] morning. Right? Let's not do what he's
[17:39] supposed to do. We'll just get out of
[17:40] the way and let him do what he's
[17:42] supposed to do this morning. Amen. If it
[17:45] wasn't
[17:47] for the grace,
[17:50] for the grace of God in my life,
[17:57] where would I be
[18:00] today?
[18:03] And what would I have done with? Let's
[18:07] repeat that again. If it wasn't, oh, if
[18:09] it wasn't
[18:12] for the grace,
[18:15] for the grace of God,
[18:20] [Music]
[18:21] where would I be
[18:25] today?
[18:27] And what would I have done with my life?
[18:33] For it was not
[18:36] who had sought him, but it was Jesus
[18:42] who had sought me. His hand of love
[18:48] to me was gi.
[18:52] And now I belong to him.
[18:57] And I'm thankful this morning if it
[19:01] wasn't
[19:03] for the grave.
[19:07] Oh, brother Gerald, come lead us over.
[19:11] [Music]
[19:12] Where would I be
[19:16] today?
[19:18] And what would I have done with my life?
[19:23] See, I was so lost. Oh, I was so lost
[19:28] and blinded
[19:31] walking in the darkness of sin.
[19:35] [Music]
[19:37] But God
[19:39] predestinated
[19:41] me
[19:42] this day to walk in his love.
[19:48] If it wasn't for the grace. If it wasn't
[19:54] for the grace.
[19:56] [Music]
[19:58] Hallelujah.
[20:01] [Music]
[20:01] [Applause]
[20:05] [Music]
[20:07] [Applause]

[33:30] when I couldn't
[33:34] take a stand.
[33:37] And I remember
[33:40] how you love me
[33:43] when I could
[33:47] love myself.
[33:50] Oh Jesus,
[33:53] I was tossed in the water,
[33:56] but I never went under.
[33:59] You were always on time.
[34:04] Jesus,
[34:06] when I went through the fire,
[34:09] you were right there beside me. You were
[34:14] always on time.
[34:17] You were always always
[34:21] on time. You were always always
[34:28] on time. You were always always
[34:35] on time. You were always always
[34:41] on time. There's never been a day, never
[34:45] been a minute, never been a moment that
[34:48] you weren't in it. There's never been a
[34:50] time.
[34:53] So I

[35:10] never been a minute, never been a moment
[35:13] that you weren't in it. There's never
[35:15] been a time that you didn't see me
[35:17] through.
[35:19] I worship you, oh Jesus.
[35:24] I was tossed in the water,
[35:27] but I never went under.
[35:30] You were always on time,
[35:34] Jesus.
[35:37] When I went through the fire,
[35:40] you were right there beside me. You were
[35:44] always on time. You were always, always,
[35:51] always on time. You are always, always,
[35:57] always on time. You are always, always,

[44:34] &gt;&gt; that burns within our hearts. Amen.
[44:36] Praise God. And so we are so grateful
[44:39] for that. And so um let's um now move
[44:44] on. And uh I want to wish everybody a
[44:46] happy Thanksgiving. Amen. Praise God. I
[44:50] don't have like a specific Thanksgiving
[44:52] message for you today. Okay. I got
[44:55] something better.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. I got something that
[44:59] that's uh that's right in the in the
[45:02] stream of what God wants to do in this
[45:04] day and in this hour. We've had many
[45:06] thanksgivings and we appreciate and and
[45:09] truly there's nobody that appreciates
[45:11] the Lord the way that that this that the
[45:14] sons and daughters of God appreciate and
[45:16] give thanks unto the Lord. She's got an
[45:20] attitude of gratitude all the time.
[45:22] Amen. And so we're so grateful to the
[45:25] Lord. And so may God bless you this
[45:27] Thanksgiving as you spend time with your
[45:29] families and with your friends, those
[45:31] that are online. We wish you a a very
[45:34] wonderful Thanksgiving weekend and uh
[45:37] may you come to realize how wonderful
[45:41] the Lord is um as you give thanks unto
[45:43] him first and then be thankful for your
[45:47] loved ones, your families, your friends
[45:50] and so forth. Praise God. And so we're
[45:52] going to go to the word of God. um we've
[45:55] been on a series of uh you know the
[45:57] purpose of God and I believe we can stay
[46:00] on that series for a long time because
[46:02] every time you know I go a little deeper
[46:04] and then the Lord opens up something
[46:06] else and so we've been looking at this
[46:08] series you know we started by
[46:10] recognizing and living the purpose of
[46:13] God and then we went to part two
[46:15] manifesting your purpose you know and
[46:17] looking at aspects of manifestations of
[46:20] the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost in our
[46:22] lives then we looked at the purpose purp
[46:24] of the Holy Ghost. And you know, because
[46:27] you know, people talk about the Holy
[46:30] Ghost, they've received the Holy Ghost,
[46:32] they think they've received the Holy
[46:33] Ghost and um and and not realizing what
[46:36] the purpose of the Holy Ghost is. And he
[46:39] has a purpose when he comes into your
[46:41] life. And it's his purpose for you
[46:43] according to his good pleasure. Amen.
[46:47] And this is all an element that just
[46:48] continues to unveil and unfold itself.
[46:51] And then we looked at do you understand
[46:53] the purpose of the Holy Ghost, you know,
[46:55] and and you you got to start looking at
[46:57] your your your self and looking at your
[47:00] situations and your conditions and start
[47:02] to truly understand how the moving of
[47:05] the Holy Ghost operates and moves in our
[47:07] lives and understanding what the Holy
[47:09] Ghost is. And we know that there's a
[47:11] difference between the anointing of the
[47:13] Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy
[47:15] Ghost and then the Holy Ghost himself.
[47:18] Amen. And so, and then um you know, and
[47:21] then last week we looked at that the
[47:22] Holy Ghost produces a new birth and that
[47:25] there's a new birth in every
[47:27] dispensation. People talk about I've
[47:29] been born again, but they don't realize
[47:32] that there's a new birth under the
[47:34] dispensation of the message of God for
[47:37] your day. Amen. and that there's an
[47:40] element of a new birth that takes place
[47:43] that places you into the age and the
[47:46] dispensation of what the word is to
[47:50] produce in our lives.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so today we're
[47:54] going to move on and we're going to look
[47:56] at the element of being called to
[48:00] adoption. The purpose of the Holy Ghost
[48:02] and what the Holy Ghost does and what
[48:04] the new birth actually does is it calls
[48:08] us unto adoption as sons and daughters
[48:11] of God. Amen. And so let's go to our
[48:13] scripture. I'm sorry I've kept you
[48:14] standing so long, but we'll read our
[48:16] scripture from Ephesians chapter 1
[48:19] verses 3-7.
[48:21] Amen. It says, "Blessed be the God and
[48:25] father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
[48:27] hath blessed us with all spiritual
[48:30] blessings in heavenly places." He didn't
[48:33] say some, he said all. Because this is
[48:36] the hour that we get it all.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; All the spiritual blessings. Amen. And
[48:41] they're available when we get into
[48:42] heavenly places. and according as he
[48:46] hath chosen us in him before the
[48:49] foundations of the world, that we should
[48:51] be holy without blame before him in
[48:54] love, having predestinated us
[48:59] unto the adoption of children by Jesus
[49:04] Christ to himself, according to the good
[49:07] pleasure of his will, to the praise of
[49:10] the glory of his grace, wherein he hath
[49:14] hath made us accepted in the beloved, in
[49:18] whom we have redemption through the
[49:21] blood, the forgiveness of sins according
[49:25] to the riches of his grace.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Father,
[49:31] we're so grateful today, Lord.
[49:34] Many of us are dealing with so many
[49:38] different elements of this life and
[49:40] circumstances.
[49:42] But here today, Lord, this is our
[49:44] opportunity to come and and to assemble
[49:46] with you and know that you are present,
[49:49] that you're here with us, that you're
[49:52] that you've already you've already moved
[49:53] us into heavenly places through the
[49:55] worship, Lord. and we've prayed and Lord
[49:59] we've come and Lord
[50:01] we just want to be sincere and say
[50:04] father won't you help us today won't you
[50:07] speak to our needs today won't you Lord
[50:10] um just uh uh let your word become so
[50:13] real in the situations in our lives
[50:16] where we need the word Lord that's the
[50:19] standard that delivers us it's what
[50:21] gives us victory in our lives what gives
[50:24] us confidence Lord many of us you You
[50:26] know, there's some that are maybe sick
[50:28] and afflicted at home, Lord. My wife,
[50:31] you know, sister Jennifer, Lord, you
[50:33] know, having a little infection, Lord,
[50:35] and uh, you know, having to deal with
[50:37] some some medication and and and
[50:39] penicellin and it's just affected her,
[50:42] Lord. But you can you can change all of
[50:44] that even right now, Father. We just
[50:46] pray that you will Lord just set her
[50:49] completely. Liberate her, Father, and
[50:52] let this sickness leave her. And may she
[50:54] just rejoice as she accepts and receives
[50:58] that portion of perfect faith, Lord,
[51:00] that you've made available for each one
[51:02] of us. And Lord, there's many here that
[51:04] are that are in need. So Lord, my hands
[51:07] are in the air. Father, I need you this
[51:09] morning. Lord, I need you to come and I
[51:10] need you to take this vessel and just do
[51:13] and have your way. Father, with all the
[51:15] sincerity that's in my heart, Lord, I I
[51:17] I pray for the needs of your children
[51:20] and for the for this for this local
[51:22] flock that you've placed into our care,
[51:24] Father. May you touch, meet, heal,
[51:27] restore, open the blinded eyes, oh God,
[51:30] and raise up
[51:32] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ for your
[51:34] glory. Father, we give you thanks and
[51:36] praise in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Praise
[51:40] God. You may be seated.
[51:42] Glory to God. We just read this
[51:45] wonderful scripture and you know uh the
[51:47] the thing that really um stood out when
[51:50] I read the scripture and I was studying
[51:52] was you know having predestinated us.
[51:55] And a lot of people look at that
[51:57] predestination and they look at that
[51:59] thought and you know that right away
[52:01] they think oh I'm predestinated to
[52:03] eternal life. No you're not.
[52:06] If you've got eternal life, there's
[52:09] never a time you didn't have eternal
[52:10] life.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. You're a son or a
[52:15] daughter of God. You were before the
[52:17] foundations of this world a son and
[52:19] daughter of God. Amen. So, you're not
[52:22] predestinated unto that. Read the
[52:23] scripture. It says you are predestinated
[52:26] unto the adoption
[52:28] &gt;&gt; of a son.
[52:31] And therefore, because we we are we're
[52:34] in this dimension. We're here in this
[52:36] life and we're dealing with the things
[52:38] of this life as human beings. We are in
[52:41] a process in this humanity of being
[52:46] transformed and being adopted
[52:51] by the spirit of God to become God
[52:56] himself, the word made flesh in this day
[52:59] and in this hour.
[53:02] Amen.
[53:03] God's word every time that he was
[53:05] sending his word, it was so that it
[53:08] could actually manifest him because in
[53:11] the beginning was the word. The words
[53:13] was with God. The word was God
[53:15] &gt;&gt; and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[53:19] among us.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; And you know, this has to become more of
[53:22] a reality to us saints. And so we're
[53:25] we're we're looking at this this element
[53:28] of being uh progressively
[53:32] translated
[53:34] to where in the moment in the twinkling
[53:37] of an eye, we're going to be changed.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; But there's a process in all of that.
[53:42] And part of that process is our
[53:44] adoption.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. So here Paul is
[53:48] talking, you know, he's he's the first
[53:50] church age messenger to the first church
[53:52] age. And Paul's speaking here to the
[53:54] Ephesian church. Amen. And we know that
[53:58] the Ephesian church in the New Testament
[54:00] is a type of Joshua of the Old
[54:02] Testament.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; So, so Paul has this revelation. Paul
[54:06] was the first messenger. Paul was like,
[54:09] you know, like like like we heard, you
[54:10] know, when brother Marcus was talking
[54:12] about that Paul laid a foundation for
[54:15] the church and Paul had a revelation of
[54:18] the message for his day. And that's why
[54:22] he could say my gospel. That's why Paul
[54:25] he he he had a revelation that that he
[54:28] was, you know, the word in his day that
[54:31] the Holy Ghost had given him a a a
[54:34] revelation of the foundation of the
[54:36] church and that he was going to and
[54:38] that's why he could turn around and say
[54:39] that if an angel
[54:42] &gt;&gt; that even if an angel comes from heaven
[54:44] and says anything different than what
[54:45] I'm saying to you,
[54:47] &gt;&gt; let him be cursed. That's the kind of
[54:50] revelation that he had. He knew who he
[54:53] was. Amen. He understood his position in
[54:55] the word of God. He knew that he was
[54:57] laying a foundation. And when he talked
[54:59] to these Ephesians about adoption and
[55:02] about placing, he knew what he was
[55:04] talking about. But he still only had a
[55:07] portion.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; He had he did not have the fullness of
[55:11] the word.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we're here.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Why would God have to have seven
[55:17] messengers?
[55:19] Amen. Because each one of those
[55:20] messengers had a portion of the word
[55:23] that they would bring in their
[55:25] dispensation. And every one of those
[55:28] individuals that caught the revelation
[55:30] for their day under that dispensation,
[55:34] they got adopted as sons.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; And listen, when I'm talking about sons,
[55:39] I'm talking about you sisters, too.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Okay? Sons, daughters. The scripture
[55:45] talks about adoption of children. Amen.
[55:48] Praise God. And so here all of them,
[55:51] they all came into their adoption. They
[55:54] all came into their placing. And yet,
[55:58] here we are a couple thousand years
[56:01] later. And we're talking about adoption.
[56:04] We had a prophet that came in our day
[56:08] &gt;&gt; that that, you know, and and this is and
[56:10] we're going to be looking at, you know,
[56:11] many of you know, we're going to have
[56:13] some quotes here from from the adoption
[56:15] series. If you get a chance, go back and
[56:17] read it. I don't know how long we're
[56:19] going to be on this, but I I'm just so
[56:22] enjoying it. Amen. Praise God. There's
[56:24] nothing new that I'm going to bring you,
[56:26] but I believe the Holy Ghost has
[56:28] something for us. Amen. Because it's him
[56:31] that's progressively moving us into that
[56:34] perfect place because we're going to
[56:37] have a you know, you know, we're going
[56:38] to have a like a full adoption and
[56:41] that's going to be in the body change.
[56:43] Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah. We're
[56:46] going to get a new robe, a new uh you
[56:48] know, praise God. Don't let me get ahead
[56:49] of myself.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; And so here Paul's speaking. He's
[56:53] talking about So Joshua came out under
[56:55] the ministry of Moses, under the
[56:58] ministry of Moses to, you know, to to to
[57:00] move the children of Israel into the
[57:02] promised land. Amen. You know, but it
[57:05] was not Moses that placed them.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; Hello. Amen.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; It was Joshua
[57:12] &gt;&gt; that placed the children of Israel and
[57:15] gave them their positioning, their
[57:17] placing. Amen. God promised that he
[57:20] would be with them. Amen. Glory to God.
[57:23] If they would obey and come under the
[57:26] leadership of the Joshua commission.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. And so God has given
[57:33] us a promise. Amen. And so the land was
[57:35] promised to them before Joshua.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was promised to Abraham and to
[57:41] his seed.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; So Joshua was just fulfilling the the
[57:45] the promise of God.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything that you're doing that
[57:49] that I'm talking about that that the
[57:51] five-fold ministry is is unveiling to
[57:53] you is something that God already saw in
[57:56] the back part of his mind.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why he he predestinated us
[58:02] unto adoption. Amen. Glory to God. into
[58:05] the placing into our positions as sons
[58:08] and daughters of God. Glory to God. So,
[58:11] so we understand that the land was
[58:13] promised to them before that. It was
[58:15] promised to to Abraham and to his seed.
[58:18] And God sent us a Moses in our day.
[58:22] Amen. By the name of William Miam
[58:24] Branham. Glory to God. A ministry, the
[58:28] 20th century prophet who had a type of
[58:31] Moses. Actually, he typed Moses. He
[58:34] typed Joshua. He's a type of the Holy
[58:36] Ghost. The There's so many types in the
[58:40] ministry that were displayed through his
[58:42] ministry. Amen. Praise God. Glory to
[58:45] God. But here we are today and we
[58:49] recognized that the that the progression
[58:51] of the word has taken us now into the
[58:54] age where the five-fold ministry under
[58:58] under a new age. Amen. We're no longer
[59:01] under Leodysa. Amen.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; I like the way brother Marcus said it.
[59:05] He says, "Brother, I'm I'm not I'm not
[59:08] in Leodysia
[59:09] &gt;&gt; because I'm not blind."
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I'm not wretched. I I'm not
[59:15] miserable. I I've got I've got the Holy
[59:17] Spirit. I got the Holy Ghost all over my
[59:19] life. He's given me a brand new life.
[59:22] Amen. He's given me a future. Glory to
[59:25] God. So, I don't know about you, but but
[59:26] here we are. We're under a new
[59:28] dispensation, and we know it as the age
[59:31] of the church. The bride,
[59:34] &gt;&gt; the bride age. Amen. This is the age
[59:37] where where Christ uh and and the bride
[59:40] become one. She comes into her fullness.
[59:44] The full adoption is going to produce
[59:46] the rapture.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what it's going to produce
[59:49] for you and me. Glory to God. Amen. So
[59:52] now we look to being, you know, uh
[59:55] translated by the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[59:59] through the adoption of our bodies.
[1:00:02] Amen. And so, um, you know, brother
[1:00:05] Brandham took us through the the church
[1:00:07] ages and that's why we recognize, you
[1:00:10] know, the messengers to to every age,
[1:00:12] each of them having a portion of the
[1:00:14] word, but the fullness of the word was
[1:00:17] something that was only made available
[1:00:19] in the evening time. Amen. This is where
[1:00:23] we we get it all. This is where the
[1:00:26] faith that we receive is going to be
[1:00:29] rapturing faith. It's going to be
[1:00:31] perfect faith. It's going to it's going
[1:00:33] to give full adoption. Amen. And this is
[1:00:35] what we want to look at here over these
[1:00:37] next few services. And so that's why
[1:00:39] we're looking to this element of being
[1:00:42] called to adoption. Amen. Praise God.
[1:00:45] And so, you know, I started to do a
[1:00:48] little bit of uh, you know, last week we
[1:00:50] we finished off last week where where we
[1:00:53] were talking about the new birth. And
[1:00:55] so, the new birth is actually only the
[1:00:58] beginning
[1:01:00] of your voyage, of your journey. A lot
[1:01:04] of people think that, you know, well,
[1:01:05] once once you know, you're you're you're
[1:01:07] born again, that that's it. You're in
[1:01:10] the kingdom. You're going, you're, you
[1:01:12] know, you're you're you're all set.
[1:01:14] there's nothing else for you to do.
[1:01:15] Hallelujah. You can just be a a
[1:01:18] Christian and and life is going to be
[1:01:20] wonderful and and everything's going to
[1:01:22] be just fine. How many are experiencing
[1:01:23] that?
[1:01:27] I'm 31 years down the road and I'm
[1:01:30] telling you, we got battles that we need
[1:01:32] to deal with and face and overcome.
[1:01:35] Amen. Praise God. Because God gave us
[1:01:38] the land. God promised us the land. God
[1:01:40] placed us in the land. But God says,
[1:01:42] "You possess it. Amen.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so the new birth is
[1:01:49] something that that that is that is uh
[1:01:51] you know required. Amen. And that's why
[1:01:53] we you know we we uh read a a a um a
[1:01:56] quote you could put it up there from
[1:01:59] brother Brandham from spiritual amnesia
[1:02:01] because we're coming out of this
[1:02:02] amnesia. It's a constant, you know,
[1:02:05] amnesia that's being let, you know,
[1:02:07] released from our lives as we as we
[1:02:10] expand by the Holy Ghost, the word of
[1:02:13] God, and it's being revealed to us and
[1:02:16] being revealed by revelation to us. The
[1:02:18] amnesia just keeps, you know, keeps just
[1:02:21] falling off our lives. Amen. But here,
[1:02:23] Brother Brandon, he's talking about you
[1:02:25] that wants the Holy Spirit, you that
[1:02:28] wants the experience, not an emotional
[1:02:30] excitement.
[1:02:32] You want the Holy Ghost, the life, the
[1:02:35] germ of life inside you. And you can't
[1:02:38] get rid of that amnesia that's making
[1:02:40] you. You can't identify yourself until
[1:02:44] that amnesia comes off of you by the new
[1:02:47] birth. You're going to have a hard time
[1:02:50] identifying yourself in the body of
[1:02:52] Christ. And when you cannot identify
[1:02:55] yourself, how can you serve God? How can
[1:02:59] you serve the ministry? How can you
[1:03:01] serve within the body? You don't know
[1:03:04] your your identity.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so you you can't identify
[1:03:08] yourself. You don't know where you
[1:03:10] stand. You don't know what you are. My
[1:03:13] goodness, let's get rid of it right now.
[1:03:16] He says, there's a new birth here for
[1:03:19] you. A real real genuine new birth.
[1:03:22] Amen. And so, so, so you know, we we
[1:03:25] want to we want to platform from here
[1:03:28] because I believe that I'm talking to
[1:03:30] people that have that have receive the
[1:03:32] new birth. Amen. That have recognized
[1:03:34] the word for their day.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; That have recognized what the Holy Ghost
[1:03:39] and the purpose of the Holy Ghost is in
[1:03:42] this hour. Amen. This hour, this time.
[1:03:45] We listen, I can't come to you with with
[1:03:47] Noah's message. I can't come to you and
[1:03:50] say, "Hey, we need to build an ark
[1:03:51] because there's going to be great
[1:03:54] earthquakes and there's going to be a
[1:03:56] flood and you know, did you hear that
[1:03:58] California is going to get a big wave?
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; I think we better build an ark and move
[1:04:03] to California."
[1:04:07] That's not the message of the hour.
[1:04:08] Amen.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Praise God. We need to know what God
[1:04:12] requires in this day.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've heard it over and over and
[1:04:16] over again, but this is the element that
[1:04:19] places you in your rightful position as
[1:04:23] a son or a daughter of God. And so the
[1:04:26] evidence of the new birth is when you
[1:04:28] come out from your spiritual amnesia.
[1:04:31] Amen. And you recognize the word for
[1:04:33] your day, how it pertains to you
[1:04:36] personally.
[1:04:38] Amen. Otherwise, what are you doing in
[1:04:41] this church? There's a there's a
[1:04:43] thousand churches out there. There's one
[1:04:45] down the street here. It's got probably
[1:04:47] a thousand cars in the in the parking
[1:04:49] lot right now. There's a lot more people
[1:04:51] over there. They might Oh, well, maybe I
[1:04:54] should be there because that's where all
[1:04:56] the crowds are.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; You know, like
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; what what is it? What element has
[1:05:03] brought you into where you are here
[1:05:06] amongst a few?
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Remember, it was always a few. Just go
[1:05:10] right back to the very beginning. And
[1:05:11] it's always been a few.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Look at Abraham.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; He was with a whole
[1:05:18] clan of of people, but God came to him
[1:05:20] personal
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; and said, "Separate yourself."
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about. You
[1:05:27] know about when God comes and identifies
[1:05:29] you as an individual and says, "I got to
[1:05:32] do something in your life." And you know
[1:05:34] that when he did it, nobody else could
[1:05:36] do it. Amen.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; And then you you you could say just like
[1:05:40] blind Barameus, they ask him, "What's
[1:05:42] going on, Barardemus? How is it that
[1:05:44] listen? I've been coming to your church
[1:05:46] for so many years. I don't know what you
[1:05:48] and I I heard it sounded like the word
[1:05:50] and everything else, but all I can tell
[1:05:52] you is that man,
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; that Jesus,
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; he did." So he I was as blind as a bat,
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; but now I can see. Hallelujah. And this
[1:06:03] is the element that brings us into why
[1:06:06] we're here.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory. And so how it pertains to
[1:06:13] you, what the word is to manifest
[1:06:16] through you.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. God wants to bring this you know
[1:06:21] personal. He wants listen when a father
[1:06:24] is going to adopt a son first of all
[1:06:27] that son has to be born into that
[1:06:30] family. He's got to be naturally of that
[1:06:34] family.
[1:06:36] Amen. He was in the father before he
[1:06:39] became a manifested son.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you hearing me?
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. So, you're not here by
[1:06:46] chance.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; You're here because you were already in
[1:06:50] the mind of God when he was back before
[1:06:53] the beginning.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he had a plan and you know he
[1:06:57] he's manifesting that plan and your
[1:07:00] identity in that plan is one of those
[1:07:02] attributes awakening out of spiritual
[1:07:04] amnesia
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; because the water of the word comes to
[1:07:07] you in your day and boom something
[1:07:10] starts to
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; bounce on the inside
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; and then you know that wait a minute
[1:07:15] here I've I haven't heard this before I
[1:07:19] I haven't heard it in this way. Why why
[1:07:20] is it affecting me in the way that it's
[1:07:22] affecting me? What is this? This is
[1:07:24] called the Holy Ghost.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. And so
[1:07:30] there's many different churches out
[1:07:32] there that are talking about adoption.
[1:07:34] You can go and go on the internet and
[1:07:36] you can look up, you know, spiritual
[1:07:38] adoption and you will get all kinds of
[1:07:40] Christian churches that will give you an
[1:07:42] interpretation on adoption. But you know
[1:07:44] what? 95 to 99% of them are basing it
[1:07:49] out of a trinitarian
[1:07:52] God.
[1:07:55] How many fathers do you have?
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Right? You can't have more than one
[1:08:01] father.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Okay? Unless you're, you know, you're
[1:08:04] adopted into another family or your
[1:08:08] mother and father are divorced and now
[1:08:10] you've got this other but I'm talking
[1:08:12] about your real father.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Your gene father. How many?
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; One.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; One. There's only one. Amen. And so here
[1:08:23] now the foundation of adoption when it
[1:08:26] when when when you don't have the the
[1:08:29] right foundation like Paul said. Amen.
[1:08:32] If you don't have the right foundation
[1:08:34] then how do you know how who who's who's
[1:08:36] really anointing you and who's really
[1:08:39] adopting you? How do you know? Is it is
[1:08:42] it the Holy Ghost? Is it Jesus Christ
[1:08:44] his son? Or is it God the Father?
[1:08:48] Because there's three. And so right
[1:08:51] there, there's an element that that puts
[1:08:53] a question into your mind of what true
[1:08:57] adoption. God is not the author of
[1:08:59] confusion.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what we're going to be looking
[1:09:02] at here is God's way and the way that
[1:09:05] he's done it. He's the same yesterday,
[1:09:07] today, and forever. And by by knowing
[1:09:10] what he did yesterday, you can know
[1:09:12] exactly what he's going to do today,
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; what he's doing right now, and what he's
[1:09:16] going to do into the future. Amen. It's
[1:09:18] just that people are not looking.
[1:09:21] They're they're constantly looking back.
[1:09:23] They're constantly looking forward, but
[1:09:26] they're never looking to what he's doing
[1:09:28] right now.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; And this is what we're interested in.
[1:09:31] Amen. And so, you can go to the next
[1:09:33] slide here. I want to look at the
[1:09:35] amplified version of
[1:09:38] um this very scripture that we read. And
[1:09:40] here it says, "Blessed and worthy of
[1:09:43] praise be the God and Father of our Lord
[1:09:47] Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with
[1:09:50] every spiritual blessing in heavenly
[1:09:53] realms in Christ."
[1:09:56] Just as in his love, he chose us in
[1:10:02] Christ. So wait a minute, he chose us in
[1:10:05] himself and now he's saying he chose us
[1:10:08] in Christ. It's because don't look at
[1:10:11] this scripture and say God the father
[1:10:14] and our lord. When it says God the
[1:10:16] father and our lord Jesus Christ, it's
[1:10:18] not talking about Danny Mazili and John
[1:10:22] Simon.
[1:10:25] It's talking about Danny Mazili and the
[1:10:30] spirit
[1:10:31] of Danny Misilli and
[1:10:36] the man, the individual
[1:10:38] of Danny Mazili, right? I'm just using
[1:10:40] like a a metaphor here. So, if you've
[1:10:43] seen me, you haven't seen my wife. You
[1:10:47] haven't seen my father. My father's in a
[1:10:49] retirement home.
[1:10:51] He's he's he's still alive. Jesus said,
[1:10:54] "If you've seen me, you've seen the
[1:10:56] Father."
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; It's I that speaketh to thee.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; I am He.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; Same self person. Amen. Praise God. And
[1:11:05] so, so, and when when he talks about
[1:11:08] being in Christ, he's talking about
[1:11:10] being in the anointed word.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; In the anointed word
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; that we're in right now. We are in the
[1:11:18] anointed word. We are we are Christ in
[1:11:23] the present stage of his ministry. The
[1:11:26] word anointed for this day and for this
[1:11:29] hour.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see it's it's understanding.
[1:11:33] So here now he's actually selected us
[1:11:36] for himself as his own.
[1:11:41] Amen. Be when did he do it? Before the
[1:11:43] foundations of the world. So that we
[1:11:46] would be holy. that is consecrated, set
[1:11:50] apart for him, purpose-driven. Remember
[1:11:53] we talked about what holy is. People
[1:11:55] think holy, you got to live clean and
[1:11:57] you got to be just completely, you know,
[1:12:00] consecrated and you all you do is fast
[1:12:02] and pray every day and every time you
[1:12:04] see somebody is, oh, God bless you. God
[1:12:06] bless you. That's not what he's talking
[1:12:08] about being holy. That's being
[1:12:09] righteous. That's self-righteousness.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Being holy is being set apart for
[1:12:16] God's purpose. Amen.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; That's what being holy means. God has a
[1:12:20] purpose in adopting you. God has a
[1:12:22] purpose in giving you the Holy Ghost.
[1:12:24] God has a purpose in placing himself in
[1:12:26] you. Jesus said, "You'll know that I am
[1:12:29] in you." We need to come to this
[1:12:31] element. And when he comes into you,
[1:12:34] it's so that he can fulfill his purpose,
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; his desire, his will for his glory. And
[1:12:40] this is the challenge for us as adopted
[1:12:44] sons because we still have this battle
[1:12:47] that goes on within our flesh as as
[1:12:51] human beings that our will wants to
[1:12:53] fight his will.
[1:12:56] What was the fight in at at Gethsemane?
[1:12:59] Wasn't it Jesus said not my will
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; but thy will. Wasn't there a struggle
[1:13:05] for will for for you know because
[1:13:08] because we as human beings, we're still
[1:13:11] human. We're still going to feel the
[1:13:12] elements and the pressure of this
[1:13:14] dimension and everything else.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. But God wants us to
[1:13:18] to, you know, to to to die out to our
[1:13:21] will so that so that our purpose becomes
[1:13:24] his purpose. Amen.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; All the things that we start to do and
[1:13:28] live and and manifest once we've been
[1:13:30] born again now we start to place it in
[1:13:34] in in in line with his purpose. Amen.
[1:13:38] So, you know, and we're going to be
[1:13:40] looking a little more at that. Okay. So,
[1:13:42] let's let's just move on here. So, set a
[1:13:45] apart for him and purpose-driven. Amen.
[1:13:49] And blameless in his sight. Glory to
[1:13:52] God. Now, you're never going to be
[1:13:53] perfect. Okay. But in his sight, you are
[1:13:57] blameless.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. He sees you
[1:14:02] through the blood.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; He sees the, you know, it's all it's
[1:14:05] it's all, it's everything. He saw you.
[1:14:08] He saw that that you would overcome in
[1:14:10] this age.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; And that's how he could predestinate
[1:14:13] you.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; And so he pre now watch. He goes on
[1:14:19] blameless in his sight. In love he
[1:14:21] predestinated.
[1:14:23] and loving lovingly planned for us
[1:14:28] to be adopted to himself,
[1:14:32] his own children
[1:14:34] through Jesus Christ. Amen. And when we
[1:14:38] talk about through Jesus Christ, we're
[1:14:40] not talking about another person here.
[1:14:44] Amen. It's because of what Jesus Christ
[1:14:46] did. Amen. We could not be adopted but
[1:14:51] by Christ coming to give his life for
[1:14:56] yours.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to see that in a in a
[1:15:00] more in depth as we move along here. in
[1:15:03] accordance with the kind intention and
[1:15:06] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[1:15:09] of his glorious grace and favor which he
[1:15:12] so freely bestowed on us in the beloved
[1:15:16] Jesus Christ his son. In him we have
[1:15:20] redemption. That is our deliverance and
[1:15:24] salvation through his blood which paid
[1:15:26] the penalty for our sin and resulted in
[1:15:30] the forgiveness and complete pardon of
[1:15:33] our sin in accordance with the riches of
[1:15:36] his grace.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Oh listen. when he when he came and paid
[1:15:42] the price, everything that you were
[1:15:44] going to need in order to to be an
[1:15:47] adopted son, every element and every
[1:15:51] authority that you would require as a
[1:15:53] son or daughter of God, he paid the
[1:15:56] price for it.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. There's nothing and
[1:16:02] and listen and you and you let's move
[1:16:04] along here. Let's look at some natural
[1:16:06] aspects. Okay? I just, you know, I was
[1:16:09] just digging in, you know, and looking
[1:16:10] up certain things and as the Lord was
[1:16:12] just giving me say, you know, so this
[1:16:14] morning, early this morning, he gave me
[1:16:15] this thought about look at the natural
[1:16:18] aspects of adoption.
[1:16:20] People talk about adoption and I'm not
[1:16:22] talking about adoption of just children.
[1:16:25] Okay? So don't think of, you know, just
[1:16:26] adop just look at the word adoption.
[1:16:30] People, businesses, big corporations,
[1:16:32] they're adopting new products. or adopt,
[1:16:35] you know, we're in the process of an
[1:16:36] adoption of this new process by which we
[1:16:40] will, you know, do this or replace that
[1:16:44] or, you know, uh, whatever, right? And
[1:16:47] so I I looked it up and I came up and
[1:16:49] the these are the things that came up
[1:16:51] and and there was five stages of an
[1:16:54] adoption process that I found to be
[1:16:56] quite common in all of the different
[1:17:00] aspects of of adoption, right? And I
[1:17:03] started to read it and I said, "Oh, this
[1:17:04] is interesting." You know, and I just
[1:17:07] started to draw certain things from it.
[1:17:08] But there's five stages of adoption
[1:17:10] process. And this model outlines the
[1:17:13] journey a person takes from beginning or
[1:17:17] from becoming aware of an innovation to
[1:17:20] adopting it. So you you become aware,
[1:17:24] you know, like so so let's let's look at
[1:17:26] this in different ways here. you you
[1:17:28] become aware like you know remember you
[1:17:30] know there's other people that haven't
[1:17:32] heard this right and so we want to lay
[1:17:35] in a foundation for them and give them
[1:17:37] something that they can kind of
[1:17:38] associate with you know if they're
[1:17:40] non-Christian and they haven't received
[1:17:42] the word for their day and so you know
[1:17:45] Jesus said feed my sheep he said also
[1:17:47] feed my lambs amen so I like to keep
[1:17:50] things simple sometimes and and you know
[1:17:52] give a little portion for the lambs amen
[1:17:55] and so here now he goes So the first
[1:17:58] thing is awareness. The individual
[1:18:00] learns about the new idea or product.
[1:18:02] You know many people have not heard this
[1:18:05] message. They and so they become aware
[1:18:08] of what the potential is in serving the
[1:18:11] Lord Jesus Christ. But what makes your
[1:18:15] product different brother or sister? You
[1:18:19] know when you're out there and you're
[1:18:21] testifying. And so the first element is
[1:18:24] the individual learns about the new idea
[1:18:26] or the new product and they so they they
[1:18:28] they they stumble into it. They start to
[1:18:31] look into it. They start to peer into
[1:18:33] the word of God. They start to see your
[1:18:35] life. They start to peer into your you
[1:18:37] as an example and the way that you live
[1:18:40] and and the way that you display
[1:18:42] yourself as a Christian and they become
[1:18:44] aware. And then there's a research
[1:18:47] number two a research and discovery
[1:18:49] aspect where the individual starts to
[1:18:52] seek more information. And so you start
[1:18:55] looking a little deeper into this
[1:18:57] element because remember this person is
[1:18:59] a is is in a process of adoption. Right?
[1:19:02] We're looking at the natural aspects.
[1:19:04] And then there's evaluation and
[1:19:06] decisionmaking. The individually
[1:19:08] mentally starts to weigh the pros and
[1:19:11] the cons. boy, if I can serve the Lord,
[1:19:14] this is the benefits of serving the
[1:19:16] Lord. If I can, you know, I know there's
[1:19:18] some cons that are, you know, a part of
[1:19:20] it too, I'm going to be rejected. I'm
[1:19:22] going to be dealing with family and
[1:19:24] friends that are going to think that,
[1:19:25] you know, oh, what's the matter with
[1:19:26] you? Have you been brainwashed? Have you
[1:19:28] been, you know, what's going on? Amen.
[1:19:31] These are all these little elements
[1:19:33] that, you know, that that look. And then
[1:19:35] comes number four, the trial,
[1:19:38] you know, and there's a trial process.
[1:19:41] And you know, the individual uses the
[1:19:43] new idea or product on a small scale.
[1:19:45] Well, maybe I'll try this. Maybe I'll
[1:19:47] pray about this or maybe pray about that
[1:19:50] and see if this actually is going to
[1:19:52] produce change in my life. I'm trusting
[1:19:54] that we're way further down the road,
[1:19:57] saints. Amen. Praise God. But then
[1:20:00] there's this element that goes to the
[1:20:02] next stage of adoption or rejection. And
[1:20:05] listen, let's face it, this is not for
[1:20:07] everybody.
[1:20:09] This is not going to be this is not an
[1:20:11] adoption that's going to be that the
[1:20:13] whole world is going to get adopted as
[1:20:15] sons and daughters of God.
[1:20:18] It's not to all the world. It's to the
[1:20:21] sons and daughters, the children of God.
[1:20:24] Amen. And so the children of God, they
[1:20:27] will receive the word.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; They will not reject the word. But there
[1:20:32] will be those that will reject the word.
[1:20:35] And there's nothing wrong with that
[1:20:36] because the scripture says they will
[1:20:38] reject it.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Now these are factors that influence the
[1:20:43] adoption. And this model identifies five
[1:20:46] characteristics
[1:20:48] of an innovation that that influence its
[1:20:51] rate of adoption. Okay. So the so the
[1:20:54] speed at which an individual can get
[1:20:56] transformed and you know just just let
[1:20:58] your mind uh you know uh elaborate you
[1:21:01] know use pronouns and adjectives and let
[1:21:04] the Holy Spirit just kind of you know
[1:21:06] stir your hearts. Relative advantage the
[1:21:09] degree to which an innovation is
[1:21:11] perceived as better than the idea that
[1:21:14] supersedes it. Amen. That you know is is
[1:21:18] it better to serve God? I don't know.
[1:21:20] Does everybody feel that it's better to
[1:21:22] serve the Lord?
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. I think that,
[1:21:26] you know, when you look at the the
[1:21:28] advantages of serving God, we there's
[1:21:30] many many advantages to serving the
[1:21:32] Lord. Amen. Compatibility, the degree to
[1:21:36] which an innovation is perceived as
[1:21:38] being consistent with the existing
[1:21:41] values, past experiences, and needs of a
[1:21:45] potential adoption. You know, you know,
[1:21:48] people listen, all you got to do is look
[1:21:50] back on your life and know that that
[1:21:53] this proved to be the right decision.
[1:21:56] Amen. It proved to that that it was
[1:21:59] good. It was right to serve the Lord.
[1:22:01] Amen. To take the Lord at his word and
[1:22:04] allow him to mold and shape and bring
[1:22:07] new ideas into your life to transform
[1:22:10] you from the from the condition that you
[1:22:12] were in to the condition that he's now
[1:22:14] placed you in. Amen. the complexity, the
[1:22:17] degree to which an innovation is
[1:22:19] perceived, whether it's difficult to
[1:22:21] understand or not. Listen, this church
[1:22:24] is not built on understanding the word
[1:22:27] of God. This church is built upon
[1:22:29] spiritual revelation.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; You need God to reveal to you the word
[1:22:35] and who you are. And there's no
[1:22:38] complexity when it comes to that. Amen.
[1:22:40] God reveals the trial ability. Don't
[1:22:43] worry. You're designed to overcome every
[1:22:46] single trial
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; because God doesn't God doesn't choose
[1:22:51] you from before the foundations of the
[1:22:53] world knowing that you're not going to
[1:22:55] be able to overcome the trial. But in
[1:22:57] that trial, there is something in there
[1:22:59] that you need that that's going to mold
[1:23:02] and shape you to exactly what he wants
[1:23:05] you to be. Because God does not rate you
[1:23:08] based on your ability. God does not rate
[1:23:11] you based on your loyalty. God rates you
[1:23:15] based on character
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; that you develop by going through the
[1:23:20] fire and becoming more like him. Amen.
[1:23:23] So so trialability, I'll tell you, you
[1:23:26] know, you're you're you're you're
[1:23:28] already you're already designed to
[1:23:30] overcome. Amen. Praise God. And
[1:23:33] observability, the degree to which the
[1:23:35] results of an innovation are visible to
[1:23:38] others. Oh, praise God. I don't know
[1:23:40] about you, but can people see Jesus
[1:23:42] Christ in you? Can people see his life
[1:23:46] being expressed through your life? Can
[1:23:48] people see you going through trials and
[1:23:50] then see you a week later rejoicing?
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can people see that? Listen, no
[1:23:56] matter what comes this person's way, my
[1:23:59] God, they just keep that I'm I'm
[1:24:02] observing that they just keep getting
[1:24:03] back up again.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; What is it in them? What is it that that
[1:24:09] I see them every Sunday?
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; I see them Wednesday nights.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; The neighbor. Where you going? Going to
[1:24:15] church.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's nice.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Sunday. Where you going? Going to
[1:24:20] church.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, well that's that's cool. Next week.
[1:24:23] Where you going? Going to church. Well,
[1:24:25] you go to church often, eh? Where you
[1:24:27] going? Prayer meeting. Oh. Oh, that's
[1:24:30] interesting. Where you going? Special
[1:24:33] meetings this weekend. Meetings for
[1:24:34] what? church. Hallelujah. Going to meet
[1:24:37] with the Lord. Amen. What what what's
[1:24:40] going they've observed some kind of a
[1:24:42] change in your life that that they just
[1:24:44] it's just it just seems to be so real to
[1:24:48] you as an individual and and they're
[1:24:50] they're starting to say, "Well, you
[1:24:51] know, maybe maybe I should uh let you
[1:24:54] know, get to know a little bit more
[1:24:55] about this church." Amen. Praise God.
[1:24:58] And so, you know, um
[1:25:03] that's the natural aspects. And then it
[1:25:05] talks about here that there was five
[1:25:07] qualities for adoptive parents right now
[1:25:10] a parent that's adopting. So here now
[1:25:12] you know like you know maybe you put
[1:25:14] yourself in in God's shoes for a moment
[1:25:16] here and you can look at you know at you
[1:25:18] know how God is looking you know well I
[1:25:21] I'm thinking about adopting here and so
[1:25:23] he looks at flexibility.
[1:25:25] He looks at your attitude the ability to
[1:25:27] adapt to the unique complexities and
[1:25:30] multiple relationships with an adoptive
[1:25:33] family. God starts to look at you in the
[1:25:35] way that you interact with one another.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; How do you interact with one another? Do
[1:25:44] you have that family love for one
[1:25:47] another?
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; These are things that you know that you
[1:25:52] know we get scarred sometimes. Listen,
[1:25:54] we're all scarred human beings. Let's
[1:25:56] face it. Every single one of us, we're
[1:25:59] scarred human beings and we take a
[1:26:01] beating every week. I don't know about
[1:26:04] you, but every week you got to deal
[1:26:06] whether you and I'm not talking about a
[1:26:08] physical beating. I'm talking about the
[1:26:09] the the mental oppression that you got
[1:26:11] to deal with every single day as a son
[1:26:15] or a daughter of God because that's the
[1:26:16] greatest battle right now.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister, brother, listen. You got
[1:26:22] to believe the word. It's the word that
[1:26:24] God sent you that's going to give you
[1:26:27] the overcoming ability to deal with this
[1:26:30] age to overcome this age to overcome
[1:26:34] this flesh to overcome the battles of
[1:26:37] the of the of relationship issues to
[1:26:40] overcome you know we weak and tired and
[1:26:43] overworked situations it's God giving
[1:26:46] you that ability. Amen. Praise God. But
[1:26:49] you know he's looking for your attitude.
[1:26:52] He's looking for flexibility in your
[1:26:54] attitude. Then he's looking at
[1:26:56] self-awareness. He's looking at
[1:26:57] understanding one's own feelings and how
[1:26:59] they impact the family. God's looking at
[1:27:02] you and the way that you deal with your,
[1:27:04] you know, with your own um, you know,
[1:27:07] your own heartaches, your own, you know,
[1:27:08] you talk to a person and that person
[1:27:10] just talks to you and says one little
[1:27:13] thing that gets you upset right away.
[1:27:17] You got an attitude. Right away.
[1:27:20] you don't want to talk anymore, you get
[1:27:22] quiet, you know, uh, you know,
[1:27:25] self-awareness, right? We need to be
[1:27:27] self-aware.
[1:27:29] We need to know that this thing is our
[1:27:31] enemy.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; It'll fight you. It's at emnity with
[1:27:34] God. Remember that your carnal mind is
[1:27:37] at emity with God.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; This is the hour that we need to
[1:27:40] overcome these things.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; God, listen, the five-fold ministry is
[1:27:43] for what? Perfecting. So, you're going
[1:27:46] to get a lot of perfecting. Amen. Praise
[1:27:48] God. as as part of of of God, you know,
[1:27:51] dealing with our lives. And God is
[1:27:54] saying, examine your attitude. Examine
[1:27:57] your your ability to deal with
[1:27:59] situations.
[1:28:01] Understand the other person's situation.
[1:28:05] Place yourself in their situation. Know
[1:28:08] that God has given you a power. Listen,
[1:28:11] there's an authority that comes with an
[1:28:14] an adopted son or daughter of God. E
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; there's an authority that comes with it.
[1:28:18] We're going to learn a lot more about
[1:28:20] this and it's going to develop our
[1:28:22] ability to overcome situations in our
[1:28:24] lives in a practical way because unless
[1:28:27] you can start dealing with the
[1:28:29] practicalities of how to handle this
[1:28:32] this human vessel because this is not
[1:28:35] what God's adopting. But he's adopting
[1:28:38] that he he's he's placed you in contact
[1:28:40] with your theophony.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now I'm going to get a little bit
[1:28:44] ahead of myself. Okay. But this is the
[1:28:46] element that that we're that that this
[1:28:49] is what's going to produce the rapture.
[1:28:53] Remember, you've been you you when you
[1:28:56] came into contact with this message, you
[1:28:59] actually came into contact. We say, "Oh,
[1:29:02] we've seen the light. We've received the
[1:29:04] Holy Ghost. We I I I've given my heart
[1:29:07] to Jesus Christ." Let me tell you what's
[1:29:10] actually really happened.
[1:29:13] You've made contact with the eternal
[1:29:16] part of God that you are
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; which is called the theophony.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you've come into contact with
[1:29:24] your theophony, it starts to feed you by
[1:29:27] revelation what I'm talking about.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are in contact with this. It's
[1:29:32] an element which is a supernatural
[1:29:35] element that is changing your body. But
[1:29:38] if you don't understand how to deal with
[1:29:41] this human part here, you're going to be
[1:29:44] fighting against yourself. You're going
[1:29:46] to be living underprivileged
[1:29:49] based on who you are as a son of God.
[1:29:52] But you know what? It's okay because God
[1:29:55] doesn't come to adopt babies.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; God's looking to adopt sons.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's move on here. Glory to God.
[1:30:05] And so it goes on. It talks about
[1:30:07] curiosity, a desire to understand each
[1:30:11] other, a child's state, the biological
[1:30:14] family, their identity, understanding
[1:30:17] one another in the body of Christ, you
[1:30:20] know, as sons and daughters of God, as
[1:30:22] as as you know, those that are of the
[1:30:24] faith. Amen. Praise God. Coming into the
[1:30:27] unity of the faith. Praise our God.
[1:30:29] Forever more. And patience.
[1:30:33] Looking at patience. You know, now this
[1:30:35] is a a these are parents that are
[1:30:37] looking to adopt
[1:30:39] children. And these are some of the
[1:30:41] elements that is a very common way that
[1:30:44] they naturally will evaluate a child.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; They'll look at the way if that child,
[1:30:50] you give the child a candy, it takes the
[1:30:51] candy and throws it in your face.
[1:30:56] This kid's got attitude.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, God's looking at your
[1:31:01] attitude.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. God's looking at all these aspects
[1:31:06] of, you know, patience and the ability
[1:31:08] to allow that child to integrate into
[1:31:12] the body of Christ. God wants you to God
[1:31:15] wants to mold you so that you can so
[1:31:17] that you can be edifying to the body.
[1:31:20] Because remember, he's called you
[1:31:22] personally according to his purpose
[1:31:26] and according to his good pleasure, not
[1:31:29] your pleasure.
[1:31:32] We got a lot of pleasures in this life
[1:31:33] and God don't mind you having pleasure.
[1:31:37] But make sure that pleasure doesn't
[1:31:38] interfere with his purpose in your life
[1:31:43] in this day and in this hour. Amen. And
[1:31:45] empathy, the capacity to understand and
[1:31:48] share feelings of the child and other
[1:31:51] family members. Amen. And so this is,
[1:31:54] you know, what we're talking about that
[1:31:55] that ability to to to work together and
[1:31:58] to to support one another. And, you
[1:32:01] know, God is looking to adopt sons and
[1:32:04] daughters of God that are that are
[1:32:05] willing to to get into their position to
[1:32:08] to listen, the the reason why he
[1:32:12] predestinated you is because he knew
[1:32:14] that you would want to do it, but you
[1:32:16] would have to overcome certain things.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so, let's move on.
[1:32:22] Now, let's go to the spiritual
[1:32:23] applications. Amen. You know, we're
[1:32:25] laying in a foundation today and then
[1:32:27] we're going to go from here. All right?
[1:32:29] So you know when we look at the key
[1:32:31] definition of adoption
[1:32:34] the Greek term the word of adoption
[1:32:37] which is huthisia signifies the formal
[1:32:41] act of placing someone in the position
[1:32:44] of an adult son
[1:32:47] giving them the full rights and
[1:32:50] responsibility that come with it. Now if
[1:32:53] you go back into the Roman times when
[1:32:55] they did this form of adoption because
[1:32:57] it was very common that the father would
[1:33:00] put the son under tutors and would you
[1:33:02] know get them you know molded and shaped
[1:33:05] and prepared to where they would come to
[1:33:07] the place where he could publicly bring
[1:33:10] them before the people and and place
[1:33:12] them before the people and at that point
[1:33:15] he'd put a robe on them and he'd say
[1:33:17] this is my adopted son. In other words,
[1:33:20] he was saying, "This is the one now that
[1:33:21] I am transferring."
[1:33:24] Remember, it's a form of adoption.
[1:33:27] God is in a in an adoption process.
[1:33:30] That's what he's done right from the
[1:33:32] very beginning. It's God been
[1:33:34] manifesting himself in different forms
[1:33:37] of different uh manifestations in
[1:33:40] different dispensations. That's what the
[1:33:42] Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit has been
[1:33:45] doing right from the very beginning. And
[1:33:47] so there's this adoption process. And he
[1:33:50] places the full authority on that son.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; He can now sign the checks.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; He can now hire and he can now fire.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Whatever you bind on
[1:34:04] earth shall be bound. Whatever you loose
[1:34:06] on earth shall be loosed. Amen.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; If you've been given that authority and
[1:34:10] you've been placed by the Holy Ghost and
[1:34:12] you're now moving in that in that
[1:34:14] position as a as a an adopted son or
[1:34:17] daughter of God, you are you are growing
[1:34:20] in your authority. You are growing in
[1:34:23] your re in in your revelation of God
[1:34:26] because revelation is progressive.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. The fullness of the word has
[1:34:31] come. Amen. And we know that the same
[1:34:34] spirit that raised Christ from the dead,
[1:34:36] if it dwell in you, it'll quicken your
[1:34:38] mortal body. But guess what? You're
[1:34:40] still here.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why? Because you're in
[1:34:44] process. You're in progress. You're
[1:34:46] you're you're you're a son that's being
[1:34:49] that you're now in in the adoption
[1:34:51] process because you've been born again
[1:34:53] by the spirit of God. You've recognized
[1:34:56] the word for your day. Now you need to
[1:34:58] come under submission to the word so
[1:35:01] that it can do and train and mold and
[1:35:04] shape you as a son or daughter of God to
[1:35:07] overcome whatever comes your way.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Cuz you are
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; victorious
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; in God's eyes. You're already
[1:35:15] victorious.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we've got to go through the
[1:35:18] process.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so when the adoption comes, it
[1:35:23] signifies that that that the full
[1:35:25] authority is being placed into the son,
[1:35:28] which is why God gives you the Holy
[1:35:30] Ghost.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; God gives you the Holy Ghost, which is
[1:35:34] himself now in you to take his purpose
[1:35:38] to the world.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is this is what he's doing.
[1:35:42] He's placing his spirit. And what does
[1:35:44] it do? It liberates you from the law.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You no longer come under the
[1:35:48] bondage of the law.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; You are no longer under under a lost
[1:35:53] spirit. You're like the master that used
[1:35:55] to, you know, the ones he put you under,
[1:35:57] those school masters, they're under you
[1:35:59] now.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; What? Quiet. Go get me something.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; Get my bath.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. You see, all of
[1:36:09] a sudden, the authority changes. Amen.
[1:36:12] And you're no longer under the law of
[1:36:13] the school master. Now you're walking
[1:36:16] with authority as a son or a daughter of
[1:36:18] God in this hour. Amen. Glory. And it
[1:36:22] transforms you. Amen. Through adoption,
[1:36:25] we become uh you know, we we we are
[1:36:27] declared
[1:36:29] justified.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. God not only
[1:36:34] chose you, not only called you, chose
[1:36:37] you, he he he justified you, he
[1:36:40] sanctified you, and he's now he's going
[1:36:43] to glorify you with the robe
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; of a body change.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. So, this is
[1:36:52] this is God's plan. This is something
[1:36:54] listen, it was his idea, his purpose,
[1:36:58] his thoughts. It's not something that he
[1:37:00] okay you know it something that you know
[1:37:03] was an afterthought where he says you
[1:37:05] know uh you know I'll make it a plan you
[1:37:07] know I'll make it plain to us that it
[1:37:09] was before listen it was before the
[1:37:11] foundations of the world and he knew who
[1:37:14] would be adopted because they would
[1:37:16] eventually mature into sons and
[1:37:20] daughters of God
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; he knew that you would
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; not a guess it's not something he just,
[1:37:29] you know, oh well, the world's going to
[1:37:31] go into sin and uh, you know, I'm just
[1:37:34] going to I'm just going to have this
[1:37:35] plan and everybody, whoever wants it,
[1:37:38] can be adopted. No, that's not the way
[1:37:41] it was done. God, because of his ability
[1:37:46] in the beginning, God, the self-existent
[1:37:49] one, God was alone with his thoughts,
[1:37:53] which means he wasn't alone.
[1:37:56] you were there
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; because you're part of his thoughts.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; But he had a plan and he knew that you'd
[1:38:03] be one of those thoughts in this age
[1:38:06] that would mature into a son of God.
[1:38:08] Let's look at the next slide.
[1:38:12] 1960, brother Brandham in adoption
[1:38:14] series number two, he says, "Your
[1:38:16] adoption is not your birth."
[1:38:20] People think, "Oh, I'm adopted now. I've
[1:38:22] been born again. I'm adopted." No, that
[1:38:24] just starts your adoption. Listen, he
[1:38:26] goes, "Your adoption is your placing."
[1:38:30] When you were born again, John 1:17, I
[1:38:33] believe, "When we were born of the
[1:38:35] spirit of God, we are sons of God, but
[1:38:38] we were predestinated."
[1:38:41] He stops right there. Now, here's what
[1:38:44] I'm trying to get to. For this, sons of
[1:38:47] the last day. What?
[1:38:50] Sons of the last day. Yeah. those in
[1:38:54] those that that would be coming after
[1:38:57] that would receive the Holy Ghost. We've
[1:39:01] been in the end time now. We're the ones
[1:39:03] that have received the Holy Ghost for
[1:39:05] our day. So, we are the sons for the
[1:39:08] last day. He goes on, he says to to to
[1:39:11] see we were predestinated to what did he
[1:39:15] say? Unto adoption. Like we were saying
[1:39:17] earlier, we're not predestinated unto,
[1:39:20] you know, going to heaven. There's
[1:39:22] nowhere in the scripture where you will
[1:39:24] find you are predestinated to go to
[1:39:26] heaven.
[1:39:28] If you're a son of God, you're a
[1:39:30] daughter of God, you're eternal, you
[1:39:32] came from God, you're going back to God.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; This is all about going back.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; This is about we were there, now we
[1:39:39] were. Now we're here, and now we're
[1:39:41] going back.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you're being but but he says,
[1:39:44] but you're predestinated unto adoption.
[1:39:47] Because here on earth, God had to have a
[1:39:50] plan
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; by which he would call his sons and
[1:39:53] daughters and by which he would call his
[1:39:56] end time church for the rapture.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Remember this is all for the rapture.
[1:40:02] The adoption now is talking about
[1:40:04] adoption of bodies for the rapture,
[1:40:07] adoption of our theophes. Amen. This is
[1:40:10] what we are being adopted into. That's
[1:40:13] the that's that's the plan of God.
[1:40:15] Remember that's what he wanted to do in
[1:40:16] the beginning. Adam was in a theophony
[1:40:19] body. Amen. When God made him in his
[1:40:23] image, God made Adam in his image.
[1:40:25] Called their name Adam. It was it was
[1:40:28] Adam and Eve. They the both of them were
[1:40:30] in one body and they shared a theophony.
[1:40:33] Brother Bram says that they shared a
[1:40:35] theophony body.
[1:40:38] And that theophony body when Eve was
[1:40:42] separated, they were still in theophony
[1:40:46] because they were eternal.
[1:40:49] That body had no death. Eve goes now and
[1:40:56] submits to the will of the serpent.
[1:41:00] What happens? Jesus now God, Adam, the
[1:41:05] first Adam, he goes and gives up his
[1:41:09] theophony
[1:41:12] to save Eve.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; What do you mean he gave up the
[1:41:17] theophony? Simple.
[1:41:20] Without a theophony, no eternal life. He
[1:41:24] forfeited
[1:41:27] eternal life right there and then. He
[1:41:30] gave himself for her.
[1:41:33] He left his theophony right there and
[1:41:35] then and took on human flesh.
[1:41:40] And that's why he died after 900 and
[1:41:43] whatever years.
[1:41:47] Do you see that?
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; You're a little bit quiet. He gave up
[1:41:51] the theophony so that he could go for
[1:41:55] his wife.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. What did Jesus do?
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; He come now. He gives his life so that
[1:42:03] he could go back to his theophony.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; But he had to pay a price.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; And this is the whole process that we're
[1:42:10] going to be looking at here over the
[1:42:12] next week or two on how we are
[1:42:14] connecting back to our theophies
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; and how it's going to bring us into the
[1:42:19] fullness of the change. Hallelujah.
[1:42:22] Praise God. So here go let's let's go to
[1:42:24] the next slide.
[1:42:26] Oh, did I finish reading this one?
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Okay, go back, please.
[1:42:31] We were predestinated unto adoption.
[1:42:33] Now, now here we are. Now, this is what
[1:42:36] hurts the Pentecostals a little. They
[1:42:40] say, "I got born again. Praise the Lord.
[1:42:42] I got the Holy Ghost." Fine. You're a
[1:42:44] child of God. That's right. But yet,
[1:42:47] that ain't what I'm talking about. See,
[1:42:50] you're predestinated unto adoption.
[1:42:53] Adoption is the placing of a son.
[1:42:55] Hallelujah.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; And unless you come into this adoption
[1:42:58] process that I'm talking about here this
[1:43:00] morning,
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; there's no rapture for you.
[1:43:04] Hallelujah. Glory to God. This is the
[1:43:07] process by which God is going to take us
[1:43:09] out of this dimension.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So here, let's go to the next
[1:43:14] slide.
[1:43:16] But now to place,
[1:43:20] how are you? You're first born into the
[1:43:23] kingdom by the Holy Ghost. How many
[1:43:25] knows that? All right. The next, you are
[1:43:28] predestinated unto the what?
[1:43:32] Adoption.
[1:43:34] What is that? You are predestinated unto
[1:43:37] placing.
[1:43:39] So listen, you're not in this church by
[1:43:43] chance and you're not in this local body
[1:43:47] to do nothing.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; You're here for a purpose.
[1:43:53] What we're going to be looking at here
[1:43:55] over the next couple weeks is is is
[1:43:57] we're going to be discovering a little
[1:43:58] bit more how it is that God is using us.
[1:44:02] How God is is uh you know placing us
[1:44:05] because it's all about now placing.
[1:44:07] Amen. You are predestinated unto the
[1:44:10] placing. That's what you're
[1:44:12] predestinated to do.
[1:44:15] So the first thing you need to know
[1:44:17] about your adoption into God's family
[1:44:19] through Christ is that God chose you
[1:44:22] positionally predestinated you for a
[1:44:26] position in love for adoption. And when
[1:44:29] did he do it? Before the foundations of
[1:44:31] the world. Amen. Glory to God. And so
[1:44:34] here now let's let's move on. Says here
[1:44:39] adoption
[1:44:41] can only come through Christ.
[1:44:43] We know that
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; you can't even be adopted
[1:44:49] unless you recognize Jesus Christ gave
[1:44:52] up the ghost so that he could send it
[1:44:55] back onto you because the adoption
[1:44:57] process starts by you receiving the Holy
[1:45:00] Ghost
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; which is the new birth for this hour.
[1:45:05] And here now let's read it. Okay, let's
[1:45:08] go to the next slide.
[1:45:11] Ephesians 1:es 9-11 he says having made
[1:45:16] known unto us the mystery of his will
[1:45:19] according to his good pleasure with he
[1:45:22] which he hath purposed in himself
[1:45:25] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:45:28] of times he might gather together in one
[1:45:31] all things in Christ both which are in
[1:45:35] heaven and which are on earth even in
[1:45:39] him. So, so he's talking about every son
[1:45:43] and daughter of God is going to be
[1:45:46] brought in.
[1:45:48] Pay attention. Now,
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; he goes on here in verse 11, in whom
[1:45:53] also we have obtained an inheritance.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Thank God. Amen.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; So, you've got an inheritance.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; There's an element. Listen, there's many
[1:46:05] different kinds of inheritances.
[1:46:08] Okay? He but let's finish the scripture.
[1:46:10] He says being predestinated according to
[1:46:13] the purpose of him who workketh all
[1:46:15] things after the counsel of his own will
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; not your will, not your desires.
[1:46:23] Everything that everything that's in
[1:46:26] that book, that book of inheritance
[1:46:31] gives you your complete placing and
[1:46:35] authority.
[1:46:38] Hallelujah.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; There's an inheritance for you.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says it very clearly. In
[1:46:45] whom we have obtained. Now, now you you
[1:46:47] know people would say, "Well, yeah,
[1:46:49] brother. I mean, Jesus died for me. I
[1:46:51] accepted Jesus. I inherit eternal life."
[1:46:54] No.
[1:46:56] No. You obtain it
[1:47:00] by predestination
[1:47:03] unto the adoption as a son or daughter
[1:47:05] of God. You obtain it. It's not just
[1:47:09] automatic.
[1:47:11] Everybody can claim out there. There's a
[1:47:13] lot of people that are claiming out
[1:47:14] there, hey, Jesus Christ died for my
[1:47:16] sins. I now I'm I'm free. I I I'm I'm
[1:47:20] going to heaven.
[1:47:24] God has adopted sons and daughters
[1:47:28] who have an inheritance coming to them.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; And the inheritance is not something
[1:47:34] that we're going to get later on when we
[1:47:36] get there. We're not looking for that
[1:47:38] inheritance because when the the the
[1:47:42] final aspect of of our translation puts
[1:47:46] us into our theophony body where we are
[1:47:50] going to end up ruling and reigning as
[1:47:53] one with Christ.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; We're not going to need an inheritance
[1:47:57] then.

[1:49:02] on. And he says, "Now a little farther
[1:49:03] now. Now the 11th verse, in whom also we
[1:49:07] have obtained an inheritance."
[1:49:10] Oh, an inheritance. Brother Bram says,
[1:49:13] "Somebody has to leave you something to
[1:49:16] inherit it." Is that right? An
[1:49:19] inheritance. What inheritance do we
[1:49:21] have? What inheritance did I have? I
[1:49:24] didn't have any, but God left me an
[1:49:26] inheritance when he put my name on the
[1:49:29] Lamb's book of life. Hallelujah.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. God placed your name
[1:49:35] in that book. Listen, you go to a lawyer

[1:49:51] people at the table. Brother, sister,
[1:49:53] brother.
[1:49:57] Starts calling the names.
[1:50:01] He doesn't hear his name. Well, what's
[1:50:03] going on here?
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; The father didn't put your name
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; in the book.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; There's Listen, there's going to be a
[1:50:13] lot of people. That's why the scripture
[1:50:15] makes it very clear. Those whose names
[1:50:18] were written in the Lamb's book of life
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; before the foundations of the world have
[1:50:25] an inheritance.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm looking for that
[1:50:29] inheritance right now as a son of God. I
[1:50:32] don't want to wait until I get over to
[1:50:34] the other side. I'm not Look, listen
[1:50:36] Listen, I need it now. Come on, saints.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; You need to overcome situations in your

[1:50:42] deal with. You got relationships that
[1:50:45] need to be healed. You've got healing
[1:50:47] that's required in your body. Listen, I
[1:50:49] don't know about you, but when the
[1:50:51] children of Israel, when they were taken
[1:50:52] out of bondage out of is out of Egypt,
[1:50:55] they went out with great substance.
[1:50:58] Hallelujah. I'm looking for great
[1:51:00] substance in this hour. And you know
[1:51:02] what? My father is rich.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. He's He owns the cattle on
[1:51:08] a thousand hills. He says, "I have an
[1:51:10] inheritance. My name's written in the
[1:51:12] book." Glory. He said, "Watch." He goes
[1:51:14] on now and he says, "Put my name on the
[1:51:16] Lamb's book of life before the
[1:51:18] foundation of the world." Oh, you say,
[1:51:20] "Now wait a minute, brother. Jesus did
[1:51:22] that when he died for you." No, he never
[1:51:26] did. Hallelujah.
[1:51:28] Jesus come to purchase that inheritance.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; The one that Adam lost when he lost that
[1:51:36] book. It was that theophony. It was that
[1:51:39] life. It was that eternal aspect of God
[1:51:42] that he gave up. It was the It was the
[1:51:45] tree of life. All of a sudden, he
[1:51:46] couldn't get to the tree of life.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; But he says, "You can get back to it."
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; It's your inheritance.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's what God has prepared for
[1:51:56] you. And he's placed your name there.
[1:51:58] And he says, "Now read very next, very
[1:52:02] next line. In whom we also have obtained
[1:52:06] apparent obtained an inheritance, being
[1:52:10] predestinated according to the purpose
[1:52:13] of him who workketh all things after the
[1:52:16] counsel of his good will." God chooses.
[1:52:20] We don't choose. People say I chose
[1:52:23] Jesus. Hallelujah. Now I am free. He
[1:52:27] never listen. You didn't choose Jesus.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; You You know people, oh I found Jesus.
[1:52:34] You never found Jesus.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; When Jesus finds you, you know you've
[1:52:39] been found.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; You understand that you would you'd have
[1:52:42] never looked in these places to find
[1:52:44] him.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; You'd have never found him the way that
[1:52:47] he found you and then he revealed
[1:52:49] himself to you. You'd have never gone
[1:52:50] there.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close now and I'll let the
[1:52:58] musicians come. I'm going to close with
[1:52:59] a couple of quotes, last quotes here. He
[1:53:02] says, now let's let's go on. Adoption
[1:53:05] number four. Look, has predestinated us
[1:53:09] unto this inheritance. Now, if I'm
[1:53:12] right, inheritance of something, if God
[1:53:15] is knocking at my heart and saying,
[1:53:17] "William Brandham, I called you a long
[1:53:19] time ago before the foundations of the
[1:53:22] world to preach the gospel."
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. Could that be his
[1:53:26] inheritance?
[1:53:29] Let's read.
[1:53:31] He says, "I I have an inheritance, an
[1:53:34] inheritance of eternal life." Now, God
[1:53:37] sent Jesus to make that inheritance real
[1:53:40] to me.
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; How's how's this word going to be how's
[1:53:44] eternal life going to become real to
[1:53:46] you? How is this inheritance going to
[1:53:49] become real to you? I don't know about
[1:53:52] you, but when my father gives me an
[1:53:54] inheritance and he gives me $100,000,
[1:53:57] it's real in my hands.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; I can see it.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; I can put it into my bank account. Amen.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; I could apply it to some debt to get rid
[1:54:06] of certain things or I can go out and
[1:54:07] buy my wife something beautiful.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; I'm going to get a cookie for that.
[1:54:14] Hallelujah. You see, it's a real
[1:54:17] something. It's a substance. It's
[1:54:18] something that's in your hand. He says,
[1:54:21] "Now listen." He says, "God sent Jesus
[1:54:23] to make that inheritance real to me
[1:54:25] because there was nothing I could do to
[1:54:27] it to inherit it. It was blank. It was
[1:54:30] valid. There's nothing I could do. But
[1:54:33] in the fullness of time, God sent in his
[1:54:36] own good time, Jesus, the lamb slain
[1:54:39] from the foundations of the world, his
[1:54:42] blood was shed that I might go to my
[1:54:44] inheritance to be what? What
[1:54:46] inheritance? The sunship to be a son or
[1:54:49] a daughter of God.
[1:54:53] [Applause]
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; Not when I'm out of this time. I'm a son
[1:54:57] of God. Now
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; you're a daughter of God. Now you can
[1:55:01] claim your inheritance. Now you can
[1:55:04] claim what your what what your father
[1:55:06] has promised you. He's promised you
[1:55:07] healing. Take it, brother.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; He's promised you uh uh relationships.
[1:55:13] Take it, sister.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; He's promised you all the financial all
[1:55:17] the all the prosperity that you have
[1:55:19] need of that you have need of according
[1:55:22] to his purpose, according to his good
[1:55:24] pleasure. If God sees it fit to put two
[1:55:26] million, three million, 10 million
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; or $10
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; into your hands,
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; it's what you need
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; for his purpose.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we'll end with this. And
[1:55:41] now, this may just choke you to death,
[1:55:45] but did you know that men that's that
[1:55:48] are sons of God are amateur gods? Amen.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; This is the hour where we're coming into
[1:55:53] our fullness.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; This is where we accept the word. We
[1:55:57] believe the word. Whatever aspect has to
[1:56:01] be moved out of the way. Whatever God
[1:56:02] has to deal with, let him deal with it.
[1:56:04] Amen. Did you know that men that are
[1:56:07] sons of God are amateur gods? How many
[1:56:09] ever know that? How many knows that
[1:56:12] Jesus said so? That the Bible said Jesus
[1:56:14] said, "Did not your law say itself that
[1:56:18] you are God's?" And if you call them
[1:56:21] gods, which God God said in Genesis
[1:56:25] chapter 2,
[1:56:27] he's talking about Adam back in his
[1:56:30] original state.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where him and Eve had full
[1:56:33] dominion, full authority, full power
[1:56:36] over the earth. Amen. That's what he's
[1:56:39] talking about. He says they were gods
[1:56:43] because they were had full domain over
[1:56:46] the dominion of the world. He give him
[1:56:50] dominion over all things and he lost his
[1:56:52] godship. He lost his sunship. He lost
[1:56:57] his domain. And Satan took it over.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; But brother, we are waiting for the
[1:57:03] manifestation of the sons of God who
[1:57:06] will come back and take it over again.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:57:15] road. Now.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; Now. Amen. Praise God. He says, "Waiting
[1:57:19] for the fullness of time when the
[1:57:21] pyramid gets up to the top." How many
[1:57:23] knows we're in the capstone age?
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; How many knows that love is moving and
[1:57:28] sweeping and and and dealing and and and
[1:57:30] moving into our lives where we're where
[1:57:32] we're seeing everything different. We we
[1:57:34] recognize the sinner out there. We're
[1:57:36] not looking at them and and and blaming
[1:57:38] them for their condition. We're saying,
[1:57:40] "Listen, there's a better way. Come this
[1:57:42] way."
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You got to have a heart for
[1:57:45] the people. You got to show sympathy for
[1:57:47] the people. You got to show the love of
[1:57:50] God. Amen. You got to show the same love
[1:57:52] that Jesus showed. Amen. When he gave
[1:57:54] his own life, glory to God. He says when
[1:57:57] the pyramid gets up to the top, when the
[1:57:59] full sons of God will be manifested,
[1:58:01] when the power of God will walk out,
[1:58:03] hallelujah, and will take every power
[1:58:06] that Satan's got away from him. Yes,
[1:58:09] sir.
