[0:00] full of equipping of the saints his
[0:05] consecrated people that they should do
[0:09] the work of ministering towards Billy
[0:14] pop Christ by the church that it might
[0:18] enough until we all attain what this in
[0:23] the faith in the comprehension of the
[0:29] full and accurate knowledge of the Son
[0:33] of God that we might arrive at relieve a
[0:37] cure manhood the completeness of
[0:41] personality which is nothing less than
[0:43] the standard height of Christ's own
[0:46] perfection the measure of the stature of
[0:50] the fullness of the Christ and the
[0:52] completeness in that's right when you
[1:02] read it that way it certainly exposed
[1:05] things it certainly gives us a much
[1:07] clearer understanding you know like you
[1:10] know just like you're seeing on one
[1:12] thing that is a necessity that the Bride
[1:16] of Christ the Church of God the people
[1:20] that have been called to the rapture
[1:22] were called to the rapture to join the
[1:26] church not called to be a member not
[1:28] called to be just a you know a Pew
[1:31] warmer and you know maybe just a cleaner
[1:34] in the church or I'm not talking about
[1:37] that I'm talking about the rapture of
[1:39] the church where there's going to be a
[1:41] people that are going to finally fulfill
[1:43] the scriptures that
[1:45] to the rapture that in the moment in the
[1:48] twinkling of an eye we are going to be
[1:50] changed and we are going to be caught up
[1:52] and they which are alive and remain
[1:55] shall not hinder them that sleep for
[1:57] days shall be risen first and we will be
[2:01] caught up to meet with them and meet the
[2:04] Lord in the air that's what we represent
[2:08] in this thing in the south and so the
[2:11] Word of God that we are receiving right
[2:13] now and every time we come into the
[2:16] house of our to hear and to listen to
[2:18] the word is in order for us to receive
[2:21] that anointed word to produce the
[2:25] rapture of the church and you as an
[2:28] individual person to be placed in the
[2:31] body nourishes and mattifies and builds
[2:34] up the church the Living dummy next now
[2:39] if we look here God's design of the
[2:42] church she beaches 4:11 Christ gave who
[2:48] nobody give he did some as apostles some
[2:52] of his prophets up as he manages and
[2:54] some as pastors and teachers but what is
[2:57] it
[2:58] [Music]
[2:59] himself the gift of the office and the
[3:04] position of each and every one of these
[3:07] offices he gave of himself for one
[3:10] purpose of the Saints so everything that
[3:17] we are receiving right now to the Word
[3:19] of God through this fivefold ministry is
[3:21] for the purpose of equipping you did you
[3:24] prepare you the overcoming power that
[3:29] you need to live in this part of world
[3:32] because you must overcome you will not
[3:36] make it without overcoming you all your
[3:39] faith you know you give up he'll
[3:42] backslide blow things if you're not
[3:45] prepared to overcome but God gives you a
[3:48] promise is dismissed
[3:49] I'm going to send you what you need so
[3:57] why are you so worried she was receiving
[4:21] [Music]
[4:22] and do your part and just sit there and
[4:27] be low and be patient it'll reach about
[4:30] the statue of a perfect man until he
[4:33] said very clearly would appreciate
[4:35] somehow creature this is a doctrine I'm
[4:38] talking about the reality of what the
[4:41] Holy Ghost comes into your life put on
[4:44] these things you don't cook any don't
[4:47] put on patience that's gonna be this
[4:50] brotherly kindness and that's so easy to
[4:54] read through it so amen
[4:57] that's why you got three kinds of
[4:58] believers in every Church so that they
[5:00] can fulfill the revelation
[5:14] [Music]
[5:24] that's right you gotta realize that you
[5:26] are what you want you gotta know that
[5:28] you know that you know who you are and
[5:32] then you can get into your office
[5:34] because it's because you believe it's
[5:37] because you experience you know that
[5:40] it's not some teaching you know that
[5:43] he's a reality he took you for the life
[5:47] of I believe he took you from from a
[5:50] simple condition and turned you into a
[5:54] input direction where were your futures
[6:04] [Music]
[6:05] you see so that we can grow into the
[6:15] into the maturity and so that we can
[6:17] grow into our positions
[6:19] you know just automatically walk into
[6:21] your position you are positionally
[6:25] placed and then God starts to give you
[6:27] divine supernatural instruction by
[6:30] revelation
[6:32] that's why revelation is so important
[6:35] and that's why the the unity is not
[6:38] unity so much so because this is a
[6:55] revelation this is being able to
[6:58] recognize and look at the body of Christ
[7:00] see your brothers and sisters see their
[7:03] their third earth Korky mr. the station
[7:07] because we all got every single one of
[7:11] us is God
[7:12] don't open Televi you're perfect because
[7:15] if you know there's no perfect in this
[7:22] house
[7:23] there are sons and daughters of God that
[7:26] have perfect attributes of God but
[7:30] they're living in these imperfect
[7:32] vessels that are constantly needing to
[7:36] be pampered and rested and all all kinds
[7:43] of emotional aspects of being human
[7:46] okay it's just you know sometimes you
[7:49] just get fed up you just you know
[7:54] because because human just look at how
[8:01] you know how you know but the attribute
[8:04] the purpose of God through the scripture
[8:08] season
[8:44] because you know the landscape director
[8:50] the corporation where we live there and
[8:57] you know an enticing them smuggle stuff
[9:02] there is no supplement to this you know
[9:09] you're very you just you know you just
[9:11] do it because your sole and that's why I
[9:17] look at it in a little book to people
[9:20] for her for my needs I realized that we
[9:24] have to work together that we have to
[9:26] buy my ultimate is Bob he's the one that
[9:30] pays me he's the one that gives me
[9:33] II you so what heals me that's how you
[9:37] gotta think you can beat up if you don't
[9:41] think that way think about this you
[9:45] start looking at depending on other
[9:46] people and decide disappoint the people
[9:54] walk by and see their you know about
[10:09] three weeks ago
[10:10] mother and daughter come up and they
[10:13] just took to the slice right off you
[10:15] know this is not right this is not right
[10:18] and this should have been done and this
[10:20] should have been done because the other
[10:21] landscapers right that I just I don't do
[10:24] stuff I control the landscapers and I'm
[10:27] looking around and I tried to separate
[10:29] opposite I said you know what's
[10:32] interesting I said I'm looking around
[10:35] and 90% of
[10:45] as if you do the worthless job here you
[10:47] know everything looks Wow look at this
[10:49] look at that look at this I said well
[10:51] it's a funny pickup people just
[10:54] generally yeah so the first thing they
[10:57] want to bring up is what's negative
[10:59] right and it's you know what you realize
[11:03] world wars a son or daughter of God
[11:05] because God is possibly now God is
[11:09] looking at you and he can look at all
[11:12] the negative even look at all your folks
[11:15] and he could be continually just just
[11:18] smashing you down he doesn't
[11:35] [Music]
[11:53] [Music]
[12:08] very simple we all take the unity of the
[12:25] revelation this is about how the
[12:28] revelation of unity in the body of
[12:32] Christ
[12:34] listen there's a nation's out there and
[12:38] you know we might sound like you don't
[12:41] work lift it up or we're not we're just
[12:46] telling you what the Word of God says
[12:48] and the left to agree how can they walk
[12:52] together there it is there's a unity out
[12:56] there
[13:01] or you know by just attending church and
[13:08] by doing things together and by nobody
[13:11] will do by compromising on this and that
[13:14] God is not a compromiser hey there is
[13:18] going to be when Jesus came to the earth
[13:20] just like he come today he could not
[13:25] just walk in there like and just say
[13:27] well everybody got his love everybody
[13:30] who saved everybody is fired in that
[13:33] would be contrary to this work that
[13:37] would be contrary to what he represented
[13:40] from the foundations of the world what
[13:43] the plan of redemption was to redeem
[13:47] sons and daughters of God but we done to
[13:51] this space of time and matter and
[13:54] elements were vessels were created and
[13:57] bodies were reading the Bible says there
[14:00] are children of God and there are
[14:03] children of this world the devil took
[14:11] place in the garden be we cannot change
[14:14] that don't try to change that but try to
[14:17] mix with the world because the truth is
[14:20] the only thing
[14:22] but they've got a unity out there and
[14:24] this unity is things would be fine
[14:31] they think it's okay they have mediators
[14:34] you know the Catholic Church has all
[14:36] kinds of mediators when they travel they
[14:39] call me dear Christopher when they need
[14:44] something to sell they call me dear st.
[14:47] Joseph it takes tattoos and they bury
[14:53] them in the front of the house that
[14:54] needs to be sold
[14:58] you see people to think I'm fake like
[15:00] that anyway there's a chance it's like
[15:10] it's like you know this is the situation
[15:14] and this is the faith and this is what
[15:15] we're believing in and I'm not there to
[15:18] tell them that you know that they're
[15:20] wrong because they need a revelation
[15:22] they need a revelation that your child
[15:25] is their provider and there is only one
[15:28] mediator the scripture says clearly and
[15:34] that is the Lord Jesus
[16:08] [Music]
[16:14] [Music]
[16:31] it's a profit summer well my field
[17:03] [Music]
[17:11] [Music]
[17:16] this is why they come to this revelation
[18:07] come to this message and so this will
[18:10] brush it's happening and that's taking
[18:12] place it's tremendous it's also it's
[18:16] also like almost like you know over love
[18:20] the in times because there's a from the
[18:29] revelation
[18:45] the property says Jesus perfect because
[18:54] he was notice that it come because he
[18:59] was the work and you become a bird you
[19:04] become a word as you receive I was so
[19:13] blessed this way but I got a rifle and
[19:18] it was a message from brother
[19:24] [Music]
[19:35] [Music]
[19:53] he says you
[20:01] [Applause]
[20:07] [Music]
[20:21] [Music]
[20:41] [Music]
[20:53] [Applause]
[21:00] [Music]
[21:42] Jesus Christ because the church is a lie
[21:48] it's an eye of Jesus Christ that has
[21:53] spirits that knows him that some
[21:57] participants in the church have great
[21:59] expectations enjoy while others feel
[22:02] disappointed on earth by past
[22:06] experiences why do you think he had the
[22:13] place without it of forgiveness repent
[22:23] in other words turn away and baptized in
[22:29] his name my taking on that anyone
[22:57] submit to her husband by receiving his
[23:01] name shows that there's a raw revelation
[23:05] of Christ and the church and their
[23:08] relationship is learning I'm not talking
[23:11] this is about these people this is the
[23:14] word of the Lord amen and so when you do
[23:18] that you recapture baptized the navel or
[23:21] do you receive the gift of the Holy
[23:25] Ghost
[23:26] you're forgetting about your past it
[23:32] doesn't exist any more than yesterday
[23:44] [Music]
[24:00] [Music]
[24:10] [Music]
[24:22] [Music]
[24:31] [Music]
[24:57] past experiences leave them in the hey
[25:06] go on what makes the church stronger
[25:10] week well we make it understandable the
[25:14] church will break the influence what
[25:17] shape the church will take in the future
[25:19] what makes Observatory in the red says
[25:22] the church is the people is the
[25:26] character of the people the revelation
[25:28] of the people are living lives it will
[25:31] give you can move around - you can get
[25:33] discouraged by so many of the carnal
[25:37] believers that are constantly having to
[25:41] battle that are in constant trouble
[25:45] it's just the way that's all part of
[25:50] overcoming
[26:54] [Music]
[27:03] [Music]
[27:13] we talked about that's exactly how he's
[27:17] doing it in this hour don't be looking
[27:20] you know looking anywhere else for you
[27:24] who has the church here at goodness
[27:29] [Music]
[28:04] [Music]
[28:14] [Music]
[28:15] and you still are settled if you can't
[28:19] find your placing and your Shepherd and
[28:22] where God is positionally placed you is
[28:25] because you're still because you must be
[28:35] born in order to see the kingdom of God
[28:40] seeing is understanding seeing is the
[28:44] ability to receive revelation on the
[28:46] Word of God for your day that's what
[28:49] this is all about and so God has
[28:52] provided those things each believer
[28:55] that's how God designed colleague or
[28:59] vocation every single one I was reading
[29:06] it here in the book of Ephesians if you
[29:14] read here Ephesians chapter 2 verse 21
[29:17] it says in whom all the building fitly
[29:21] framed together groweth unto an holy
[29:26] temple in the Lord in whom he also are
[29:30] builded
[29:31] a habitation of God through the spirit
[29:36] if you look at Ephesians chapter 4 or 16
[29:41] he says here he says for whom the whole
[29:47] body fitly joined together and compacted
[29:51] by that which every joint I'm looking at
[29:56] a lot of joints here every joint
[30:00] together and compacted by that which
[30:03] every joint supplies according to the
[30:07] effectual working in the measure of
[30:09] every part you see how everything works
[30:24] how every one of us has a place in the
[30:27] body of Christ and when we are all
[30:30] positionally placed because God gave you
[30:33] a position of location God gave you an
[30:36] office in the body and when you come
[30:39] into it and it's not because you're a
[30:43] trustee or a deacon or a novelty verse
[30:47] and not because of them but because
[30:50] remember revelation of being in that
[30:52] office there's a big difference there's
[30:57] a huge difference when something
[30:58] operates by faith because remember is
[31:01] coming into the unity of the faith
[31:03] that breeze that supernatural power and
[31:08] presence of God in your life within the
[31:10] ministry and so every one of us is
[31:13] beside God never placed you in the
[31:17] Lamb's Book of Life without seeing you
[31:19] exactly how you are going to be and the
[31:24] position that you are going to take some
[31:27] of you ended up being this Sunday school
[31:33] teacher whatever position it's the bike
[31:44] of God for you if you operate unclean
[31:56] because you believe that nourish the
[32:03] body press that's one word when one
[32:05] joint starts to get our price things go
[32:11] blue as well you know arthritis is one
[32:14] of the biggest demons are hurt right now
[32:16] what because it tries to paralyze the
[32:20] body and what do you think is trying to
[32:24] do to you when when when somebody in the
[32:27] body because God is kind of nice
[32:32] every point what do you think that is
[32:35] exactly paralysis it's a fear of
[32:39] paralysis I don't want to hear unless
[32:44] stuff has written to me in my office in
[32:46] my position whether it has to come in
[32:49] the right time of season that he
[32:50] positions B and he gives me the strength
[32:53] to deal with it because God has offices
[32:56] and positions within the body to deal
[32:59] with all that stuff and so when you got
[33:01] a situation you've got some situation
[33:12] [Music]
[33:16] and you've got to speak into somebody
[33:18] else you got you got to release that
[33:20] demon you don't realize what you're
[33:23] doing you're spreading arthritis and the
[33:27] body of Christ
[33:30] are we gonna keep this simple to do we
[33:33] want to know what it's gonna take to get
[33:37] victory victory in our lives personally
[33:42] you don't want to be listening to those
[33:44] reports evening but somebody comes to
[33:47] you and that's the first thing that's
[33:56] not about anybody else here because it
[34:01] could be
[34:03] it could be releasing something that is
[34:07] not identified or build or strengthened
[34:11] my god
[34:14] and that's why with situations rise up
[34:17] we gotta get to the right cut the root
[34:19] man take the head off and tell the
[34:22] people not just walk
[34:23] don't let these things come on don't let
[34:27] these things enter you because this is
[34:29] the perfecting time this is the
[34:32] perfecting of the body of Jesus Christ
[34:35] this is there's gonna be a season where
[34:53] the church is gotta be need to do this I
[35:04] need to do that these people you know
[35:09] what the word is gonna do
[35:10] I'm talkin what the word is gonna do
[35:12] because the word is going to come
[35:16] [Music]
[35:33] let's get this
[35:39] [Music]
[36:07] [Music]
[36:25] [Music]
[36:49] [Music]
[37:14] [Music]
[37:21] [Music]
[37:29] people are so high educational
[37:46] [Music]
[37:52] if you have a revelation I got nothing
[37:56] against school and education and being
[38:00] being smart and they're doing well and
[38:03] getting degrees and everything else but
[38:05] you've got a revelation that you know
[38:07] that is for the purpose of God like
[38:09] their life is now or being God and that
[38:12] your purpose and your life mission is
[38:15] God Himself the fulfillment of the word
[38:17] for the rapture of the church that's
[38:20] great it's an edifying aspect to the
[38:25] body of Christ when somebody can you
[38:27] know put the word and have fellowship
[38:28] rather work but when it's just
[38:30] intellectual without revelation they can
[38:35] be irritated it's just that simple
[38:40] because it takes science it takes all of
[38:44] the laws of this world it puts that all
[38:50] and what is possible with God
[38:54] because all things are possible you talk
[38:56] to a doctor and if they're too
[38:59] intellectually they've got a revelation
[39:02] they could've put God first in terms of
[39:05] the medicine first that's why when you
[39:08] go to the doctor the first thing wants
[39:10] to do is give you this you come to me or
[39:14] a minister or somebody filled with the
[39:17] Holy Ghost
[39:18] and I see Jesus name brother sister
[39:23] received the healing that God said I am
[39:27] the Lord God that healeth all
[39:29] [Music]
[39:31] you know Hoover in athens of us weekend
[39:34] you know brother jump uncle is a pest
[39:37] boys oh brother you heard of the the
[39:39] brother there in in Calgary sista to get
[39:41] a chance to visible with the people in
[39:43] Congress early counted one leg and so he
[39:47] says always a bastard their brother
[39:50] Kenan could get his Las Vegas he says
[39:52] guy was diagnosed about six months ago
[39:54] with a tumor at the brain gave us
[39:56] ordinary consulate said Wow garbage he
[40:13] says he went for a check-up after he
[40:27] went to see the doctor they examined
[40:30] everything
[40:31] [Music]
[40:37] because he's the Lord that healeth
[40:39] awkward is easy to name anything and he
[40:42] knows you the attribute that you are the
[40:46] purpose that you have and I look back at
[40:49] my life brother Chris say to God I
[40:51] should've been dead a few times I'm
[40:54] serious I was a big-time risk taker I
[40:57] jumped out of a plane at 4,500 feet I
[41:03] was but it wasn't I see every single one
[41:12] of us we cannot leave here unless God
[41:27] gives us a testimony and then you've got
[41:30] a paradox for the poor brother they're
[41:32] in Brockton and it's been swiped the son
[41:35] what is it it's God's plan God's purpose
[41:38] we cannot interpret Asia
[41:46] [Music]
[42:06] [Music]
[42:26] when you are in your position and
[42:37] believers are set aside for specific
[42:40] answers the kids cover everything
[42:44] necessary for Christ by just right God
[42:50] everything that we need so don't think
[42:55] oh maybe I should
[43:20] you might be just caught on the worst
[43:36] vacation of your life
[43:39] the what purpose to fill the body of
[43:54] Christ you want to step back you want to
[43:56] click runnable this week wiggle that way
[43:58] when God is right now moving on to
[44:01] perfection
[44:01] where he's perfecting the bride if you
[44:04] do if you do fall away to because your
