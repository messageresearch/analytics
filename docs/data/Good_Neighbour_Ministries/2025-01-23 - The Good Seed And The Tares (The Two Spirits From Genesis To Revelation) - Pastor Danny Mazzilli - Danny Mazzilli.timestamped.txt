[17:37] into the house of the Lord welcome back
[17:39] sister Tina glad to see that you uh
[17:42] finally made it praise God I know

[17:47] resistance but uh God knows best and God
[17:52] knows how to keep his his children amen
[17:55] praise God welcome everybody into the
[17:57] house of the Lord tonight we are going
[17:59] to start a bible study this evening on
[18:02] the Seven
[18:04] Seals I believe that um we're GNA be
[18:08] blessed by doing this
[18:10] study um it's it's
[18:14] probably the most
[18:17] important um I would say it's the most
[18:20] important event that had taken place
[18:23] right up until
[18:26] 1963 when uh God's prophet ET William
[18:30] Branham received the revelation of the
[18:33] Seven Seals amen and um we are now
[18:37] living in the seventh seal manifesting
[18:41] the word of God fulfilling God's purpose
[18:45] allowing the word to move through our
[18:47] lives vindicate himself amen praise God
[18:51] the revelation of the Seven Seals is an
[18:54] event that uh literally affects the
[18:56] entire world
[18:59] and more specifically even to the
[19:01] Gentile church because it was directly
[19:04] for the Gentile church but it was an
[19:07] event that was required in order for uh
[19:10] the prophecy of God's word to come into
[19:13] full manifestation and lead us right
[19:16] into the uh final days of the church
[19:21] Israel and the world as we know it amen
[19:25] there's going to be great change as we
[19:27] move from this uh dispensation into the
[19:31] millennial dispensation amen praise God
[19:35] so we don't want to miss the importance
[19:37] of the Seven Seals um I'm going to
[19:39] encourage you over these next few months
[19:42] to dive into them read them read your
[19:46] seven seal book again take the time
[19:49] every day to read a little bit listen to
[19:51] the messages listen to William Branham
[19:53] speak on each of those seals um you're
[19:56] going to be able to draw so much much
[19:58] more because the the word continues to
[20:02] unfold it continues to reveal and make
[20:06] known and manifest exactly what our part
[20:09] is in this day and in this hour amen
[20:13] praise God and so like the prophet said
[20:17] when that seventh seal was open the
[20:19] Bible became a brand new Bible because
[20:22] the book has been open now and the
[20:25] Revelation is is is coming clear and the
[20:28] Sun and Daughters of God that are under
[20:31] that seventh seal that were ordained to
[20:34] receive that portion of the word is now
[20:37] rejoicing in it because it's the life of
[20:40] the word and the life is in you now to
[20:45] manifest and show what it is that God
[20:48] wants to accomplish today this day this
[20:52] hour amen praise God and so we're going
[20:55] to look um you know to really um
[20:59] get a a clear understanding on the word
[21:02] and the opening of the seals I believe
[21:04] it's important for us to understand um
[21:07] the two spirits that you know started
[21:10] from Genesis to Revelation and to follow
[21:13] and to see how it's always been the two
[21:17] Spirits the spirit of Christ God himself
[21:21] and the spirit of Satan the Antichrist
[21:26] anti- word am amen and for us to fully
[21:30] understand the battle and what it is
[21:32] that we're facing in this day we need to
[21:35] understand how that Spirit of the
[21:37] Antichrist has been moving right from
[21:40] Genesis in the same way that we want to
[21:42] understand how the Holy Spirit has been
[21:44] condescending down moving through each
[21:48] and every one of his children to bring
[21:50] us to the hour that we're in right now
[21:52] amen so we're going to read um you can
[21:56] flip over to to
[21:59] um to our first scripture in Matthew
[22:02] chap 13 verse
[22:05] 36-39 before we do that we're going to
[22:07] pray
[22:08] father we so appreciate this opportunity
[22:11] Lord to now uh be able to start this
[22:15] brand new study on the uh Seven Seals
[22:18] lord it's always been a wonderful
[22:23] um joy to to to read the the seals and
[22:28] to listen to your Prophet Lord bring
[22:30] forth such
[22:32] wonderful understanding and Revelation
[22:35] Lord it truly uh is who we are lord it's
[22:38] it's what lit us up in these last days
[22:42] to make us recognize who we truly are
[22:45] and Lord we just ask that your spirit
[22:47] would now move through the speaker
[22:50] through the hearer Lord let your word
[22:52] become alive in each and every one of us
[22:54] let us see ourselves in the word as we
[22:58] uh look look into this study father and
[23:00] Lord may we see more of you in our lives
[23:03] Grant it we pray father uh have your way
[23:06] now Lord in the name of Jesus Christ
[23:08] amen and amen praise God glory to
[23:17] God then Jesus sent the multitude away
[23:21] and went into the house and his
[23:23] disciples came unto him saying declare
[23:26] unto us the parable of of the
[23:29] tears of the
[23:31] field and he answered and said unto them
[23:34] he that Seth The Good Seed is the son of
[23:38] man talking about himself the field is
[23:42] the
[23:43] world the good seed are the children of
[23:46] the Kingdom those are the sons and
[23:49] daughters of God Amen but the tears are
[23:53] the children of the wicked
[23:55] one the enemy that sold them is is the
[23:59] devil the Harvest is the end of the
[24:01] world and the reapers are the Angels
[24:05] amen God bless you may be
[24:09] seated glory to
[24:13] God so it's important for us to
[24:16] understand the Plan of Redemption to
[24:19] understand how everything began and how
[24:21] in the mind of God he had a plan and he
[24:25] was Elohim the self-existent one and in
[24:28] his mind mind he was Desiring to express
[24:31] himself to have a family to have um you
[24:35] know uh a son and a daughter that would
[24:38] that would Rule and Reign Over the Earth
[24:41] which was him expressing himself
[24:43] declaring himself a plan that he had in
[24:46] his heart and in his mind to redeem his
[24:49] children amen and that whole plan you
[24:52] know um had a had a a a deceiver that
[24:56] had to you know be in the midst of that
[24:58] plan in order for us to understand the
[25:01] light there would have to be darkness in
[25:04] order for us to understand good there
[25:06] would have to be evil and so God's Plan
[25:09] of Redemption because if you look at the
[25:11] word Redemption it means to redeem and
[25:14] to bring back something that was lost
[25:17] and so in order for to you know to bring
[25:19] something that was lost back something
[25:23] had to be lost amen and so God had this
[25:27] plan and you know we were there with him
[25:29] before the foundations of the world and
[25:32] he was explaining to us you know uh
[25:34] rejoicing we were rejoicing around the
[25:36] Throne of God and I I believe one day he
[25:39] said you know what you're going to have
[25:40] to go I'm I've got this plan and I'm
[25:43] going to send you down into the Earth
[25:45] I'm going to express I'm going to
[25:47] express us into another dimension we're
[25:50] going to call it Earth and we are going
[25:52] to go there and we're going to have
[25:54] Fellowship together but you're going to
[25:56] go through this whole plan of of uh um
[26:00] you know where you're going to forget
[26:01] who you are you what Lord you mean we're
[26:04] going to forget who we are he says yes
[26:06] you're going to forget who you are but
[26:08] then I'm gonna I'm going to send my word
[26:11] and you know my word oh yes Lord you're
[26:13] you're everything to us you're you're
[26:15] you're our life you we we feed on you
[26:18] all day long we Rejoice around the
[26:20] throne there's there's nothing greater
[26:24] but how can we possibly lose it he says
[26:27] well you're going to go into the these
[26:28] human bodies and you know he probably
[26:30] explained it but he says but don't worry
[26:33] you'll know my voice you'll know when I
[26:35] call you back you'll understand and know
[26:38] that it's me and then no other voice
[26:41] will you follow and so but he says but
[26:43] there's going to be a deceiver that's
[26:45] going to be in the midst and then this
[26:47] whole plan started to unfold itself in
[26:50] the mind of God and in that Dimension
[26:53] and Lucifer uh from before the
[26:55] foundations of the world he he he was
[26:58] watching all of this he was he was in
[27:00] the midst of it all but he was created
[27:02] for the purpose of deception that was
[27:05] his purpose and unless we understand
[27:08] that we start to you know look at the
[27:11] world and we look at evil and we look at
[27:13] the things that are going wrong around
[27:15] our lives and and and without that plan
[27:17] and that understanding that these that
[27:20] this is all part of God's plan that
[27:23] because you've recognized who you are
[27:26] because you've been given the ability to
[27:28] see that you're the good seed that was
[27:30] planted in the
[27:32] world then you understand better uh why
[27:36] the enemy is there why sickness comes
[27:39] into our Lives why things go so wrong
[27:42] sometimes and we wonder oh my gosh and
[27:44] we get all caught up into the
[27:47] circumstances of this life and fail to
[27:49] realize that this is all part of God's
[27:52] plan and unto you it has been given to
[27:55] know the mysteries of the Kingdom but
[27:58] God had this plan so designed because he
[28:02] knew that that that Satan would always
[28:04] be an impersonator he'd always be one to
[28:07] try and come in he came right there into
[28:09] the Garden of Eden he knew that God
[28:11] wanted to express his attributes himself
[28:15] in attribute form into individuals and
[28:19] express them onto the Earth that's why
[28:21] when he placed Adam and Eve there they
[28:23] were they were uh they were
[28:25] God the the two of them were where where
[28:28] God Adam uh and Eve was was was actually
[28:32] God expressed in a theop theophany form
[28:36] and all that he would have had to do was
[28:38] speak and bring forth each and every
[28:41] attribute of himself remember he's just
[28:44] expressing his thoughts and when he
[28:47] expresses his thoughts and speaks them
[28:50] they
[28:51] materialize so Satan was watching all of
[28:53] this and he says man I want to create I
[28:56] want to be worshiped I want that
[28:59] fellowship and so that's why when he
[29:01] went to Eve and he deceived her he was
[29:04] able to plant his seed in
[29:07] her because remember she was Adam's
[29:11] expression she came from the side of
[29:13] Adam she was God she was God expressed
[29:18] in female form but he knew that God had
[29:21] expressed them in such a way and that
[29:23] their body that once he created Adam it
[29:27] wasn't until he took from the dust of
[29:29] the earth and created Adam a body and
[29:32] breathed the breath of life into Adam
[29:35] that he actually became a living
[29:37] soul and that and that now every seed
[29:41] would bring forth of its own
[29:43] kind and so Satan saw this he saw a
[29:47] beding ground in Eve and he says if I
[29:50] can plant my seed in Eve I can create
[29:54] and I can be a Creator and then they
[29:57] will worship me me and this has been the
[30:01] thought and the mind of the enemy right
[30:04] from the very beginning and that's why
[30:06] he is very religious he knew the word he
[30:10] understood what was going on he can't
[30:13] receive revelation of what God is going
[30:16] to do and that's why God has always
[30:20] sealed up things because remember the
[30:23] Plan of Redemption doesn't fully
[30:26] culminate until the end time
[30:28] that's why the scripture said that that
[30:30] the tears are the children of the wicked
[30:32] one okay because there's two seeds two
[30:36] Spirits two Vines Jesus said I am the
[30:41] vine ye are the
[30:43] branches and so if you are of God you
[30:46] are going to come and be an expression
[30:49] of Jesus Christ if you're of the wicked
[30:53] one who planted his seed because he was
[30:56] a beast he was an upright being it
[30:58] wasn't a snake like they say he brought
[31:02] forth children on the earth and those
[31:06] children now have have a a nature in
[31:09] them and a character in them and their
[31:11] desire is going to be to worship their
[31:14] father regardless they cannot they can't
[31:18] worship God as much as they can put on a
[31:21] show that they're worshiping God okay
[31:24] they have they have a form of godliness
[31:27] but but then they deny the power which
[31:30] is the
[31:31] word because the power is all in the
[31:34] word and so God uh planned this whole
[31:39] Plan of Redemption so that the Harvest
[31:41] is at the end of the world in other
[31:44] words when time shall be no more when
[31:48] time shall be no more when this Earth
[31:51] will go from time and blend into
[31:54] eternity and that's why when we go into
[31:56] the millennium
[31:58] we as the Sons and Daughters of God time
[32:02] shall be no more for us we will not be
[32:05] governed by time we will not be
[32:07] controlled by by death though death will
[32:12] still be on the earth and people will
[32:15] survive and generations imagine 1,000
[32:19] years on the earth there will be
[32:22] Generations after Generations that will
[32:24] be born and people that will live upon
[32:27] the Earth but the Sons and Daughters of
[32:30] God will be the
[32:32] government because the government will
[32:34] be upon his
[32:36] shoulders and there will be a brand new
[32:39] government and that government will be
[32:42] ruled by the righteousness of God's word
[32:45] Satan gets bound up for a thousand years
[32:49] so all those Wicked spirits that are
[32:52] anointing and possessing the people will
[32:55] be bound up for a thousand years and
[32:58] that's just around the corner
[33:00] Saints but we come back to the Earth
[33:04] after three and a half years that this
[33:06] earth goes through a massive tribulation
[33:09] period and Israel gets
[33:12] awakened Jesus Christ reveals himself to
[33:15] the
[33:16] Jews all of this is all part of the Plan
[33:19] of Redemption but it all happens in the
[33:22] end time and so God he sealed everything
[33:27] up up until the end so that Satan would
[33:32] not be able to
[33:34] impersonate and stop what it is that
[33:39] he's going to do now because at some
[33:42] point Redemption has to be
[33:44] completed right right and the enemy The
[33:47] Wicked one the devil has constantly
[33:50] infiltrated the churches and that's why
[33:53] you know uh the seven Church ages it was
[33:57] it was it started in Ephesus with Paul
[34:00] but the evil Wicked one was always
[34:03] moving and coming into the church and
[34:07] impersonating the
[34:10] Believers and
[34:12] then like Satan always does he
[34:17] pulls all those fallen angels that are
[34:20] in the children of the wicked
[34:23] one to worship Him and the way that he
[34:27] gets him to worship him he starts to
[34:29] introduce doctrines and that's why the
[34:32] doctrine of the Trinity right back in ad
[34:35] 325 was injected right away every
[34:40] baptism up until ad.
[34:43] 325 when they had the the meeting of the
[34:46] nian council every baptism up until that
[34:50] point was done according to the Bible in
[34:52] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[34:55] you can actually go back and Google gole
[34:57] search it niasia Rome ad.
[35:01] 325 and the things that that when church
[35:05] and state came together through
[35:08] Constantine and they made the changes
[35:11] and they adopted church and state and
[35:14] they made the changes to baptize in the
[35:18] names in the titles of the father and
[35:20] the son and of the Holy Ghost and that
[35:23] right there was serpent doctrine that
[35:27] was that was the the mark of the beast
[35:30] Doctrine right there injected right into
[35:33] the lineage and and right there is where
[35:36] the where where Satan got right in there
[35:38] and he started moving with the church
[35:40] and that's why if you read the the seven
[35:43] Church ages and you go back and do a
[35:45] study of the seven Church ages you will
[35:47] see everything that we're going to be
[35:50] looking at as we go through this series
[35:52] on the Seven Seals the white horse rider
[35:55] the red horse rider the the the black
[35:58] horse rider and the pale horse rider
[36:01] those were all the different teachings
[36:03] and doctrines of that Antichrist Spirit
[36:07] moving from one Rider to the other but
[36:10] it was always Satan moving from one
[36:14] writer to the other from one Doctrine to
[36:16] the other infiltrating himself into the
[36:19] church so that he could get the people
[36:22] to go off the word but in every one of
[36:26] those Church ages
[36:28] there was Sons and Daughters of God
[36:31] those that were able to recognize the
[36:35] truth there was seed that was planted by
[36:39] the son of man Jesus Christ and every
[36:43] one of those ages had seed that would
[36:46] come into its
[36:48] maturity and those would be the ones
[36:50] that would believe the word and manifest
[36:53] Christ in their day and that's why when
[36:55] Luther caught the revelation of
[36:57] justification he broke away from the
[36:59] Catholic church and then Wesley comes
[37:02] along and he brings a revelation on
[37:05] sanctification and then the Pentecostals
[37:07] received the gifts all part of the body
[37:11] being restored the the original word
[37:13] being restored but then God sent a
[37:16] prophet the 20th century Prophet William
[37:19] Mariam Branham because there was so much
[37:22] teaching now was the time where God was
[37:25] going to finalize everything everything
[37:28] and that's why when when William
[37:30] brandham received that that Angelic
[37:34] visitation and the spirit of Christ came
[37:36] and said go back to Jeffersonville it is
[37:39] the time of the opening of The Seven
[37:41] Seals that was the time when God was
[37:44] going to start to unveil all the mystery
[37:48] that he had bottled up right from the
[37:52] the before the foundations of his world
[37:54] of the world which was Christ the
[37:57] mystery of God being revealed all the
[38:00] way down from Genesis all the way down
[38:03] through the Book of Revelation until we
[38:07] go into the Millennium and then the new
[38:08] heavens and the new Earth but he sealed
[38:12] everything up in those Seven
[38:14] Seals and in within those Seven Seals
[38:18] laid perfect Revelation perfect
[38:21] understanding and and divine revelation
[38:24] that only the elect of the last last
[38:27] days would be able to
[38:30] receive God was going to have a church
[38:32] that's why they get so confused when
[38:34] they read the book of Revelation they
[38:36] don't understand that it is a book that
[38:39] is that is actually concealed by Seven
[38:44] Seals the whole Bible was concealed by
[38:47] Seven
[38:48] Seals right up until
[38:52] 1963 even though things that that took
[38:55] place under the first seal the second
[38:58] seal right up until the Sixth Seal you
[39:00] know that the first and second world war
[39:02] was under the Sixth
[39:04] Seal it was all manifest under the Sixth
[39:08] Seal but yet brother brandham came after
[39:11] World War
[39:12] II but then the Holy Spirit was showing
[39:16] him everything all the Mysteries that
[39:17] were written under those seals so that
[39:21] so that it could be brought in our
[39:24] day and manifest and bring to the time
[39:28] of the opening of the seventh seal where
[39:31] you and I come in now you and I were not
[39:34] part of the first six
[39:38] seals most of
[39:40] us were born right around the time I was
[39:45] born in
[39:46] 1961 there was you know it was just a
[39:49] time where where brother brandham was
[39:50] was preaching on the seven Church ages a
[39:53] lot of us were born after even brother
[39:56] Bram left the scene and those of us that
[39:58] were here before our names our our our
[40:02] our
[40:03] representation didn't come into full
[40:06] light until the seals were open and in
[40:10] particular the seventh
[40:13] seal God had to hide
[40:16] us we were the we were the the the the
[40:20] the hidden
[40:21] revelation that was going to come forth
[40:24] after the opening of those seals that
[40:27] would would be the ones that would
[40:29] defeat the wicked one would not
[40:32] surrender to the wicked one we were the
[40:35] good seed that were placed under that
[40:37] seventh
[40:38] seal and God reserved it until the end
[40:42] time that's why Daniel said seal it up
[40:46] so here now let's let's let's move along
[40:48] here so the Lord sends his Messengers
[40:53] that's why it said in the end of the
[40:55] world and the reapers are the angels and
[40:58] angels are messengers and that's why
[41:01] there would be angels to every single
[41:03] Church
[41:04] age each one of those Church age
[41:07] Messengers were angels that God anointed
[41:10] to bring his word to that particular
[41:15] dispensation well the angel that he sent
[41:18] to our dispensation the seventh Church
[41:20] age
[41:21] dispensation was William Miriam
[41:25] Branham and that's why we don't worship
[41:28] the man a lot of people say why do you
[41:30] follow this guy well just go to a
[41:32] Lutheran and say why do you guys quote
[41:34] Martin
[41:35] Luther or go to the Presbyterians and
[41:38] and and go to the Anglican churches and
[41:40] and say well why do you guys uh quote
[41:43] John Wesley why do you got this big
[41:44] church Wesley Church you got this big
[41:47] statue of
[41:49] him the people recognized him because he
[41:53] received a revelation from God and he
[41:57] broke away from from the from the uh the
[42:00] the the unbelief that had infiltrated
[42:03] the churches because God had to have
[42:06] good seed in those
[42:09] churches and once his word came to
[42:13] season and time those seed would come to
[42:17] life and they would all all of a sudden
[42:19] Luther one day he's reading the
[42:22] Bible and he's reading there and all of
[42:24] a sudden the word the just shall live by
[42:26] faith
[42:27] and the Holy Spirit brought it to
[42:30] life the Bible to Martin Luther became a
[42:33] new
[42:34] Bible all of a sudden now everywhere he
[42:37] could see it's by Grace it's not by
[42:41] law you shall call no man father he's
[42:45] seen it in the scripture there's no
[42:47] mediator between man and God and Luther
[42:49] was caught up into all the the 14
[42:52] Stations of the Cross and the Virgin
[42:54] Mary and and and sa this and Ain that
[42:58] and praying to all the saints and doing
[42:59] all the rituals with the smoke and
[43:01] everything else it's all witchcraft
[43:03] right amen and he realized it and his
[43:06] God awoken him God gave him a revelation
[43:09] and he broke
[43:10] away well this is exactly what's
[43:13] happened to
[43:15] you when William Branham was given the
[43:19] Revelation on the opening of the seals
[43:21] it was just the same way that Luther
[43:23] caught that understanding on on
[43:25] Revelation because the just shall live
[43:27] by faith means the just shall live by
[43:31] Revelation that it was a a a between you
[43:34] and God you need your own relationship
[43:37] right that's why you're a true Christian
[43:39] in this day and in this hour not because
[43:42] oh are you a Christian well I'm a
[43:44] Catholic I didn't ask you what church
[43:46] you went to are you a Christian well I'm
[43:49] a Baptist I'm a Jehova
[43:53] Witness I'm a presbyterian I'm an
[43:55] Anglican no no are you a Christian a
[43:58] Christian is somebody that is like the
[44:01] word
[44:03] Christlike the word So when you say to
[44:06] them baptism in the name of the Lord
[44:08] Jesus Christ if they're a Christian they
[44:11] have the Holy Ghost in them amen and the
[44:15] opening of that seventh seal
[44:18] released the Holy Ghost for this
[44:21] hour to come to every elected seat of
[44:25] God and when the Holy Ghost come to you
[44:29] it it it it's always been following you
[44:32] it's always been around you because it's
[44:33] the attribute of God that's what the
[44:35] Holy Ghost is but it awakens you brings
[44:39] you into a cons conscious revelation of
[44:43] of the word and then all of a sudden now
[44:44] you're reading the word and it's making
[44:46] perfect
[44:47] sense you see baptism in the name of the
[44:50] Lord Jesus Christ it's all the way
[44:52] through the Bible there's no other name
[44:54] whereby man must be saved but but by the
[44:57] name of Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ
[45:01] means Jehovah our
[45:04] savior because Jehovah God Elohim the
[45:08] self-existent one took on a body to be
[45:11] our savior and that's why Jesus
[45:16] Christ and the word
[45:18] Jehovah is Jesus our
[45:21] savior it's God taking on Humanity so
[45:24] that he could go and take your place
[45:28] in other words so that his word could
[45:30] not be broken remember heavens and earth
[45:33] will pass away but my word shall not
[45:35] pass away and when he said if a man sin
[45:38] a man must die then no matter what
[45:41] without Christ if you dis because sin is
[45:44] just unbelief the moment you disbelieve
[45:47] the word of God your soul is headed for
[45:51] death but if your soul has an
[45:55] attribute which is a portion of God
[45:57] himself in
[45:59] you written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[46:03] those whose names were written we read
[46:05] about these things they they they'll
[46:07] even teach them you know in Christian
[46:09] churches but they don't have a
[46:11] revelation that your name was written
[46:14] before the foundations of this
[46:17] world in the Lamb's Book and that's why
[46:21] Jesus could say all that the father all
[46:24] that I
[46:27] okay because he said if you've seen me
[46:28] you've seen the father you got to you
[46:30] know you got to get this trinitarian
[46:32] thing out of your mind because people
[46:34] think when Jesus says well the I do
[46:36] nothing L the father shows me what he
[46:38] was saying was that I do nothing that
[46:41] has not already been written and
[46:43] revealed in the mind of God because God
[46:46] knew from before the foundations of the
[46:48] world that you would answer and respond
[46:51] to this
[46:52] message amen praise God trying to lay in
[46:55] a a a good Foundation here so that we
[46:58] can understand as we go into these seals
[47:01] it it just makes everything so much
[47:03] clearer for us to really know why we
[47:06] believe what we believe people go to
[47:09] church and and and they go there to go
[47:12] to go have a
[47:14] nap a lot of people go to church just
[47:16] for a
[47:18] nap it's by tradition and they think
[47:20] that it's oh well at least I'm going to
[47:22] church every Sunday yeah it's good they
[47:25] say it is very beneficial
[47:27] to go and assemble yourself with people
[47:30] and clap your hands and sing hymns
[47:33] together it actually does you good
[47:36] physically and mentally too and mentally
[47:39] too
[47:40] absolutely but your soul must feed on
[47:44] the word if your if your soul is not
[47:47] feeding on the pure unadulterated word
[47:50] then you're just another church member
[47:53] and you're just going to this church
[47:55] going to that church and you and you
[47:57] know that's why you you when you talk to
[48:00] somebody about the
[48:01] word and you get into you know you meet
[48:05] somebody and you start and they say oh
[48:07] yeah you know I thank God and then you
[48:09] you know you start to lead them into the
[48:11] word God is the word and you start to
[48:13] show them in the scriptures you know
[48:16] what it says about proper relationship
[48:19] with God and how to receive the Holy
[48:20] Ghost and you could ask the question
[48:22] like Paul did when he seen the disciples
[48:24] in the book of Acts chapter 19 they were
[48:26] all excited about being you know that
[48:30] that God that Jesus Christ had come and
[48:33] that he had done great Miracles and and
[48:35] and they heard of all the things that he
[48:37] did but he looks at them and he says
[48:38] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[48:42] you believed it's not that I don't doubt
[48:44] you believe because you can go out there
[48:48] and you could walk down New Street and
[48:49] there's probably a dozen churches that
[48:52] you could walk into and you could ask
[48:54] them and walk into the first person that
[48:55] you see and say hey do you believe in
[48:58] Jesus Christ you're going to say what
[49:01] are you talking about of course we
[49:02] believe in Jesus Christ and you and then
[49:05] you say well how are you
[49:08] baptized and they'll say well if you go
[49:10] into a Catholic Church they say well I
[49:11] got baptized when I was a
[49:13] baby and then you'll go and show them in
[49:16] the word that baby baptism is not even
[49:18] in the scripture amen
[49:20] nowhere Jesus said he that believeth and
[49:23] is baptized shall be saved
[49:27] you see they
[49:29] think they're actually worshiping Jesus
[49:32] Christ but
[49:34] remember Satan is a very religious
[49:38] spirit and he knew that the only way
[49:41] because listen how could it be so
[49:43] deceiving in the end time because it
[49:46] said that that it would be so deceiving
[49:48] in this end time that it would deceive
[49:52] even the very elected of God those that
[49:54] are actually the seed of God because
[49:57] remember they're
[49:58] still in this human flesh and they're
[50:01] still dealing with a carnal mind that is
[50:04] at emity against God I can show you the
[50:07] scripture your carnal mind will deny the
[50:10] word just like Jesus told Peter he says
[50:13] Peter I know you would die for me but
[50:16] guess what you're going to deny me three
[50:18] times what yeah you're going to deny me
[50:21] three times because you're still in your
[50:24] human flesh you're still a human being
[50:27] and you're still susceptible to to the
[50:30] to this realm and that's why there's
[50:32] such a fight and a battle with this
[50:34] flesh to
[50:36] overcome and to deal with it and you
[50:39] think that this is what you are and
[50:41] you're looking at your situations and
[50:43] your circumstances and your problems and
[50:46] and and all of a sudden they become they
[50:48] they overwhelm
[50:50] you but I'm saying wake up Sons and
[50:53] Daughters of God Amen wake up to who you
[50:57] really
[50:58] are and that's why you could go down the
[51:01] street here and you could go into all
[51:02] the different churches you'll go into
[51:04] another one and and you'll say um do you
[51:07] um do you have women preachers in your
[51:09] church of course we do our head Pastor
[51:12] is is a woman I said well you know
[51:16] nothing against the woman or the
[51:20] pastor you know but did you realize that
[51:23] in the Scripture it says that she shall
[51:26] shall not
[51:29] preach she should not upsert Authority
[51:33] there's scripture where that's why Adam
[51:36] and Eve had their rightful positions in
[51:39] the
[51:40] word and that's why God never ever sent
[51:44] a prophet that was a
[51:47] woman that would come and say thus
[51:49] sayeth the Lord you show me one place in
[51:51] the
[51:53] Bible it's nowhere to be found
[51:56] not that God can't use women just like
[51:59] he used the Virgin Mary she was a
[52:02] blessed she was blessed amongst all
[52:05] women because God chose her
[52:08] body as a betting ground for his word to
[52:12] bring forth a body for
[52:16] himself and so she was blessed but we
[52:19] don't worship her because she was
[52:22] used she was she was she was that
[52:25] portion of the word that when Isaiah
[52:27] said a virgin shall conceive under the
[52:31] inspiration right at that
[52:33] moment God already knew it was going to
[52:36] be Mary of of uh the Virgin Mary the the
[52:40] one that he saw in his
[52:43] mind but that doesn't make her the
[52:45] mother of God how can God have a
[52:48] mother you understand you see all of
[52:51] these things and so a woman should not
[52:54] be a preacher or have a position of
[52:58] authority in the church to minister the
[53:01] word of
[53:03] God it's as simple as that now I don't
[53:06] want to get into all of that but you'll
[53:08] see but they'll turn around and say oh
[53:09] no no no no and they'll deny the
[53:12] word and when they've denied the word
[53:15] it's because the seed of the wicked
[53:18] one has taken control of their lives
[53:22] they have a form of godliness but they
[53:25] deny the power power of God's
[53:28] word in that he said it shall not return
[53:30] to me void let every man's word be a lie
[53:34] and my word be the truth he said in the
[53:37] scripture so why would we take a man's
[53:40] teaching or
[53:43] doctrine over the word of God but you
[53:46] see that's why
[53:48] God sealed everything up until the last
[53:51] days until the end time and that's why
[53:55] we are going to do this study on the
[53:57] seals and what it's going to do is it's
[54:00] going to completely open up and make so
[54:04] clear and anybody that that
[54:07] dares to to study and to search the
[54:11] scriptures those that have not received
[54:14] the Holy Ghost yet those that are
[54:15] listening in online that are listening
[54:17] in and wondering what it is that we
[54:19] teach here we don't teach our own
[54:21] doctrines we don't teach our own uh you
[54:24] know uh interpretation on the word of
[54:27] God everything that we teach is directly
[54:30] from the word and that's why we
[54:33] challenge you to read the word we quote
[54:37] William Maryam Branham because we
[54:39] recognize him as the prophet of Malachi
[54:42] 4:5 we recognize him as the seventh
[54:46] angel to the seventh Church
[54:51] age Revelations 10
[54:53] 1-7 we recognize him as the angel that
[54:57] would be on the earth at the time he's
[55:00] not the mighty
[55:02] Angel he was the
[55:06] man in the office of a prophet and
[55:10] that's why if you go back and you
[55:11] actually study like like you
[55:14] know go back and study Billy
[55:17] Graham everybody knows about Billy
[55:19] Graham go back and study about Oral
[55:22] Roberts everybody knows about Oral
[55:24] Roberts he was the he was the the the
[55:27] the Pentecostal
[55:28] King everybody knows that Billy Graham
[55:31] was the Protestant King he was the
[55:34] messenger he was one of the two angels
[55:37] right that was sent into the world Billy
[55:40] Graham Oral Roberts were the two angels
[55:44] that were with
[55:46] MDC when he went to
[55:50] Abraham and sent two angels into Sodom
[55:53] and Gomorrah to go tell them to repent
[55:57] and come
[55:58] out because God was going to destroy
[56:01] Sodom and Gomorrah but Abraham was a
[56:04] type of William
[56:07] Branham whom the Holy Spirit MDC was
[56:12] with at the time and that's why if you
[56:14] go back and you actually do a
[56:17] study and actually study don't just read
[56:21] the the the commentaries when you do a
[56:23] search William brandham on the internet
[56:25] and he comes up and the first thing that
[56:28] you might see is
[56:32] cult and right away oh not going any
[56:36] further why what's the matter you don't
[56:40] have your own ability to search the
[56:43] scriptures the Bible says search the
[56:45] scriptures for in them you think you
[56:48] have eternal
[56:51] life could you be
[56:55] wrong you you need to Deep dive and look
[56:59] into his life read his life story read
[57:03] about his ministry in the 1930s all the
[57:06] way through
[57:09] 1965 doctor's affidavits
[57:12] FBI
[57:14] documentation showing that that the
[57:17] light the the light that actually
[57:19] appeared over William Bram in 1950 in
[57:23] Houston Texas was a supernat natural
[57:27] light they scientifically proved it by
[57:30] the picture through a forensic testing
[57:33] of those pictures that that Pillar of
[57:35] Fire was actually something
[57:39] Supernatural and the
[57:42] healings and the people that were healed
[57:45] the meetings that were held there was
[57:48] meetings where there was thousands tens
[57:51] of thousands of people at meetings world
[57:54] all over the world seven times God said
[57:56] sent him around the
[57:57] world where meetings that he would
[58:00] Minister in the meetings and they would
[58:02] have to send in a tractor trailer to
[58:06] remove all the crutches and the
[58:08] stretchers and the hospital
[58:11] beds because of the people that were
[58:13] healed in those meetings never since
[58:17] Jesus was on the earth were there
[58:20] Miracles and healings and and raising
[58:23] from the
[58:25] dead where it was proven a child that
[58:27] was dead for 10 hours that morning from
[58:29] the morning and it finally the Holy
[58:32] Spirit showed brother brandham when the
[58:34] when the the deacons came to to William
[58:36] brandham and said uh Mr Bram there's a
[58:39] woman that's been here since this
[58:40] morning she's got a dead baby in her
[58:43] arms wrapped in a blanket and she says
[58:45] she wants to see you she wants you to
[58:48] pray for that baby and William branam he
[58:52] he he said well just you know tell her
[58:54] that you know
[58:56] there's nothing I can do unless the Holy
[58:58] Spirit showed me something there what
[59:00] can I do and as he was sending them to
[59:04] go and and go and tell her that you know
[59:07] that that we'll pray for her and this
[59:09] and that right there a vision broke
[59:11] right in front of him and he's seen the
[59:13] baby in his arms looking at the child
[59:16] and he's seen it come back to life he
[59:18] said who wait a minute he says go get
[59:21] the
[59:22] woman and bring me the woman with the
[59:24] child
[59:26] you can go back and you can read about
[59:29] it you can look it up that's just one
[59:32] story and right there in his arms in
[59:34] front of thousands of people thousands
[59:37] of people were converted in that meeting
[59:39] that night that child came back to life
[59:43] and and the doctors signed affidavit
[59:46] saying that that child was dead that
[59:48] morning they had pronounced a child dead
[59:51] now you tell me a child after 10 hours
[59:54] well that's no problem because lot
[59:56] Lazarus was in the grave four
[59:58] days we're talking about
[1:00:02] God he still can raise the dead did you
[1:00:04] know
[1:00:06] that he still raises the dead he still
[1:00:09] because there's a lot of people that
[1:00:10] come into churches that are more dead
[1:00:13] spiritually than anybody
[1:00:16] else because eternal life is the real
[1:00:20] life amen not this life you could live
[1:00:24] this life and you could have the riches
[1:00:26] of this life and your soul has be going
[1:00:28] right straight to Hell amen but come
[1:00:31] into the presence of the Lord and let
[1:00:33] the word awaken you to who you really
[1:00:35] are and then you come to realize wait a
[1:00:37] minute I am an attribute of God I am
[1:00:41] actually a
[1:00:43] seed that was sown by the son of
[1:00:47] man and I can recognize the word of God
[1:00:50] in my
[1:00:51] day and I've come and identified myself
[1:00:54] with the word amen
[1:00:57] and
[1:00:57] so understanding the placing and the
[1:01:01] positioning of these Angel Messengers
[1:01:06] because he said in in in the the harvest
[1:01:09] is the end of the world and the reapers
[1:01:11] are the
[1:01:13] Angels it's not going to be angels that
[1:01:15] are going to fly down and appear before
[1:01:19] you and say oh Michelle you are a
[1:01:22] daughter of
[1:01:24] God that's not the way it's going to
[1:01:26] happen God has placed an attribute there
[1:01:30] and if there's an attribute there and
[1:01:33] the word is being
[1:01:35] preached something in her soul and in
[1:01:37] her heart is going to
[1:01:39] burn and it's going to say that's
[1:01:42] nothing but the
[1:01:43] truth and it's going to want to feed on
[1:01:46] the word of
[1:01:48] God it's going to want to feed on God's
[1:01:50] word it's going to want to hear the word
[1:01:53] of God because that attribute knows that
[1:01:56] Faith cometh by hearing the word and
[1:01:59] that's why it can't wait to get into the
[1:02:02] presence of the Lord not some church
[1:02:05] service where you're going to go have a
[1:02:07] nap where you're going to hear God's
[1:02:09] word speaking directly to your heart and
[1:02:12] bring you to a place where you realize
[1:02:14] that this is this is real this is not
[1:02:17] something that my mom and dad were
[1:02:19] religious Fanatics about because you
[1:02:22] know a l I know a lot of you young
[1:02:23] people your friends you know telling you
[1:02:26] that oh you go to church a lot
[1:02:29] eh are your are your family like really
[1:02:32] religious and kind of Fanatics or
[1:02:34] what just wait till the fire starts to
[1:02:37] really
[1:02:39] fall and tribulation starts to really
[1:02:41] come a little closer to home they're
[1:02:44] going to be asking you
[1:02:46] questions they're going to be wondering
[1:02:48] wait a minute here all those things that
[1:02:50] you were talking about I'm starting to
[1:02:52] see them a lot of people are starting to
[1:02:55] wake up to realize wait a minute here
[1:02:58] you talked about you know cars that
[1:03:01] would be able to drive by themselves
[1:03:03] years
[1:03:05] ago you talked about you know women
[1:03:08] presidents I know we haven't had it yet
[1:03:11] but we see the signs and and and and we
[1:03:14] know that brother Brenham didn't didn't
[1:03:16] say that it would actually be a woman
[1:03:19] now don't get me wrong it still could
[1:03:23] come there it could easily come who
[1:03:27] knows next time four years from now it
[1:03:29] could be Trump's daughter that's going
[1:03:31] to be running for the president of the
[1:03:32] United States or some other woman that's
[1:03:35] going to rise up because the woman is is
[1:03:40] is being accepted into those
[1:03:44] positions we had a woman vice
[1:03:47] president in kamla Harris and she ran
[1:03:50] for president and a lot of the Bible you
[1:03:53] know a lot of the message Believers were
[1:03:55] saying there she is that's the one she's
[1:03:57] going to
[1:03:59] win but that wasn't in God's
[1:04:02] plan that's why don't be looking to that
[1:04:05] be listening for the word and what the
[1:04:08] word is doing in your
[1:04:12] life a lot of people are just looking
[1:04:14] for signs and wonders to vindicate that
[1:04:17] they're actually a part of the
[1:04:21] Bride instead of looking for the signs
[1:04:24] and wonders in them in
[1:04:27] you Christ in you the word manifesting
[1:04:31] through
[1:04:32] you speaking through you praying through
[1:04:37] you glory to God Amen we haven't even
[1:04:40] gotten started here we're just on the
[1:04:42] first scripture we're going to end here
[1:04:43] in another seven minutes
[1:04:46] okay praise God but listen
[1:04:51] here let's move on here so we're looking
[1:04:54] at the good seed
[1:04:56] and the tears now listen to brother
[1:04:58] Brenham here in the seed of
[1:05:01] discrepancy
[1:05:03] 1965 he says and then the vision was
[1:05:07] interpreted
[1:05:09] now he was telling the story of you know
[1:05:13] how he seen
[1:05:16] the when he went to that Pentecostal
[1:05:19] meeting and and you know he met a
[1:05:21] Pentecostal there and he met one
[1:05:22] Pentecostal and because of this the the
[1:05:24] spirit of discernment and the gift that
[1:05:26] God had given brother brandham he could
[1:05:29] see their lives he could see that they
[1:05:30] were actually what if they were genuine
[1:05:33] seed or if they were actually
[1:05:36] tears God gave them the ability to see
[1:05:38] their lives because remember when he
[1:05:40] talks about the seed which is the word
[1:05:43] and the word gets into you then by your
[1:05:47] fruits you shall be known by the life
[1:05:50] that you live by the manifestation of
[1:05:53] your life your hidden life
[1:05:56] the person that you really are don't
[1:05:58] show me you know that you can be in
[1:06:00] church every every Sunday and every
[1:06:03] Wednesday night and then go out there
[1:06:05] and have a mouth like a like a like a
[1:06:09] [Laughter]
[1:06:10] pirate F bombs dropping left right and
[1:06:13] center and everything else that tells me
[1:06:16] the kind of fruit that's coming
[1:06:19] out praise God people people say I'm a
[1:06:22] Christian I go to church and you listen
[1:06:25] to them talk for 10 minutes and they'll
[1:06:28] drop at least a half a dozen F bombs
[1:06:32] while they're
[1:06:34] talking it's not what goes in that
[1:06:36] defiles it's what the kind of spirit
[1:06:38] that's inside that what comes out that
[1:06:40] shows the kind of seed Spirit that's
[1:06:44] actually in there so brother brandham
[1:06:47] was was talking about this experience
[1:06:49] that he had and he says my God this one
[1:06:51] was a total
[1:06:52] hypocrite and he was there praising God
[1:06:54] speaking in tongues and everything
[1:06:57] else and this one was a genuine
[1:06:59] Christian humble
[1:07:02] Spirit two different
[1:07:04] seeds so he's talking here and now he's
[1:07:07] he's and so then and then the vision was
[1:07:10] was interpreted to him the rain falls on
[1:07:13] the just and the unjust The Same Spirit
[1:07:16] can fall in a meeting and everybody
[1:07:18] rejoice in it
[1:07:21] Hypocrites Christians and all together
[1:07:25] exactly right he says but what is it by
[1:07:28] their fruits they are known see that's
[1:07:31] the only way it can ever be known then
[1:07:34] you see that now since Wild Oats or wild
[1:07:38] wheat and grain sometimes
[1:07:42] impersonates a genuine so he's talking
[1:07:45] about seed how you can actually go and
[1:07:47] and and and Harvest
[1:07:49] Grain and there'll be actual wild wheat
[1:07:53] mixed in there that looks just like the
[1:07:56] grain but it's not it's an
[1:07:58] impersonator one will actually bring
[1:08:01] forth life again you plant that seed
[1:08:03] that grain in the ground it'll bring
[1:08:05] forth life the other one you plant
[1:08:08] it it just dies because the life of the
[1:08:13] word is not in that seed it's one of the
[1:08:17] seed of the wicked one and remember
[1:08:21] Satan's serpent seed Satan's seed has a
[1:08:25] be beginning and an end it's not the
[1:08:27] Eternal
[1:08:29] Word that's why animals have a beginning
[1:08:32] and an end that's why the humans because
[1:08:36] of the original sin that took place back
[1:08:39] in the Garden of
[1:08:41] Eden humans were not supposed to die
[1:08:45] they were supposed to be expressed by
[1:08:47] the spoken word Adam would have looked
[1:08:49] at Eve and said eve bring forth
[1:08:53] Jennifer bring forth
[1:08:56] Phillip bring forth
[1:08:59] Eugene now maybe those weren't your real
[1:09:01] names from before the F but whatever it
[1:09:03] was and you would have come into full
[1:09:06] manifestation in a form of a
[1:09:09] theophany having no beginning and no end
[1:09:12] because you're an attribute of
[1:09:15] God it's just God expressing himself in
[1:09:19] different attributes and giving those
[1:09:22] attributes the ability to Fellowship one
[1:09:24] with the other
[1:09:27] it's
[1:09:29] God and so here
[1:09:31] now you can have a seed that
[1:09:35] originated from The
[1:09:37] Serpent and that's why the Bible says
[1:09:40] there are children of God and there are
[1:09:44] children of the devil amen that's why
[1:09:48] Jesus stood before the priests and the
[1:09:51] Pharisees St John chapter 6 and he's
[1:09:54] talking to them and they're saying we
[1:09:55] are Abraham's seed these priests and
[1:09:59] these Pharisees these they could read
[1:10:01] the Scrolls off off by heart they didn't
[1:10:05] even need to to they didn't need to open
[1:10:07] the Scrolls they knew all the scriptures
[1:10:10] you know off by Heart by memory and
[1:10:12] they're saying we're Abraham's seed just
[1:10:15] like today all the different churches
[1:10:17] you got you got thousands of different
[1:10:19] teachings and the nomin and they're all
[1:10:21] claiming I'm Abraham's seed even the
[1:10:23] Muslims
[1:10:25] and it's true they are of Abraham's seed
[1:10:29] but they're of the wild seed that came
[1:10:32] as a result of unbelief because Sarah
[1:10:36] did not believe that God could bring
[1:10:38] forth a son through
[1:10:40] her and she decides to give
[1:10:43] Abraham her Bond woman Hagar and says
[1:10:47] take
[1:10:48] her and Hagar brought forth Ishmael
[1:10:53] which today is the father
[1:10:56] of the whole Muslim
[1:11:01] nations and they claim Abraham as their
[1:11:03] father and it's
[1:11:05] true but they were not given the
[1:11:09] promise the promise was given to
[1:11:13] Isaac who brought forth
[1:11:17] Jacob who brought
[1:11:19] forth who who went from Jacob to Israel
[1:11:23] we're going to be looking at a lot of
[1:11:24] that this Sunday
[1:11:27] and so here
[1:11:29] now there's an
[1:11:31] impersonator and that's why if it is an
[1:11:34] original seed
[1:11:36] word it'll have an
[1:11:39] end and so here brother Braham says that
[1:11:42] domestic grain so close that it would
[1:11:44] deceive the very elect I think we're
[1:11:47] living in a timely age when these things
[1:11:50] should be preached on and talked about
[1:11:54] and that's why we're going to be
[1:11:56] preaching on and talking
[1:11:58] about this as the back bone and the
[1:12:03] foundation so that when we we do the
[1:12:06] study on the seals we will see those two
[1:12:09] vines that have been operating right
[1:12:12] from the Garden of Eden and you'll even
[1:12:15] find out that it even started before
[1:12:17] then when Lucifer
[1:12:19] fell and Drew a third part of the Angels
[1:12:22] unto himself
[1:12:25] let the musicians
[1:12:27] come we're going to be looking at that
[1:12:30] let's read the
[1:12:34] next and he goes on to say here he could
[1:12:37] not depend on some certain Church to
[1:12:39] separate them now he's talking about
[1:12:42] separating the wheat from the
[1:12:44] chaff okay the seed of discrepancy if
[1:12:48] you go back and you listen to this
[1:12:49] message it's all about you know the seed
[1:12:52] of discrepancy how that you know there's
[1:12:53] the wheat seed and there's the the tears
[1:12:56] and he goes on he says God could not
[1:12:59] depend on churches to separate them say
[1:13:02] the methodists or the Baptist or the
[1:13:04] Pentecostals to separate them he said he
[1:13:07] sends his angels his Messengers to
[1:13:11] separate them not even we not even us
[1:13:17] ministers we're not separating the sheep
[1:13:20] from the
[1:13:22] goats it's still the mighty Angel
[1:13:24] himself it's still Christ himself the
[1:13:27] angel Messenger to this age that's why
[1:13:30] when when we get to the seventh seal
[1:13:32] you're going to you're going to realize
[1:13:35] that that it's no longer a a one-man
[1:13:37] Ministry it's no longer just a a William
[1:13:39] Branham or a Billy Graham or or one of
[1:13:43] the seven Church age Messengers it's
[1:13:45] Christ himself now who has come down to
[1:13:49] possess the five-fold ministry to
[1:13:51] separate the wheat from the chaff to
[1:13:54] bring the rain into the barn into the
[1:13:57] body of Christ amen and so he says he
[1:14:00] couldn't use uh any man in other words
[1:14:03] an Angel is coming to bring the
[1:14:05] separation the segregation between the
[1:14:08] right and the wrong and no one can do
[1:14:11] that but the angel of the Lord it was
[1:14:15] always the mighty Angel himself the holy
[1:14:17] spirit that would possess those
[1:14:20] Messengers he's the one that is going to
[1:14:23] tell which is right and which is wrong
[1:14:26] God said he will send his angels at the
[1:14:29] last times in the end time not Angels
[1:14:31] down through here but Angels at the last
[1:14:35] time and would gather together we know
[1:14:39] that this is the coming Harvest time
