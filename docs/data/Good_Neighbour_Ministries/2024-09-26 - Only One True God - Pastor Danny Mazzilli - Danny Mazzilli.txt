God it's good to be in the house of the Lord on a Wednesday night amen amen where we know that uh we come together to study the word of God Wednesday night's our Bible study amen and so I'm going to take advantage of that um when I Minister on the Wednesday nights I'm going to be um hitting on topics that are like uh you know the things that are controversial with respect to the word of God and and how important it is to have that uh that proper foundation on the word of God in order to establish anything at all you know with a relationship with God you need to know who God is amen and we're living in a world where there's too many too many different gods and so tonight T tonight we're going to be looking at um only one true God and we're going to just be um you know taking our time um we're going to look at uh you know how it is that God is one and that there is only one God and uh you know for the world to to recognize true salvation they're going to need to know who their savior is amen amen praise God so let's get um let's get going with that we'll just have a word of prayer we want to remember um we got a prayer request here that came in this evening from Brother Zach lent uh that's sister zabina um her husband um his father uh brother Doug has just been diagnosed with some sort of a esophagus cancer and so we want to take that before the Lord tonight and trust that the Lord will move he's more than able to to um touch and restore our brother and meet his needs amen let us pray father what a privilege and what an honor it is to assemble ourselves once again under your anointing the word of God lord to be drawn together in this way father where we can study the word where we can allow your spirit and your anointing to uh add and Inspire and bring bring Faith and Revelation upon the word of God for Faith cometh by hearing and by hearing the word of God and Lord you chose the foolishness of preaching Lord in order for us to be saved and to be transformed and to be healed and to be set free father that's what the preaching of the word does Lord it liberates the captives and tonight Lord as we come to you Lord we want to bring this request for brother Doug lent Lord that Lord that uh the doctor's report has given a cancer report but father we know the true report and that is you are the Lord God that Health all of our disease and so we bring our brother before you tonight in the name of Jesus Christ and Lord may your spirit move where there is no distance in prayer may you move into that situation wherever he is even right now Lord May Faith enter his heart and Lord may it change the circumstances From This Moment On and may He recognize that by your stripes we are healed granted father let your perfect will be established Lord we commit all things now into your hands sanctify this evening for your glory in Jesus name amen and amen praise God let's go to the scripture tonight our scriptures from 1 Timothy uh 3:16 and this scripture is very clear it's without any controversy so there's no argument there's no discussion it's absolutely pure fact that great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest in flesh amen God bless you you may be seated you know that is the very Foundation of Christianity amen that if if we don't recognize that Jesus Christ is God and that he had to become flesh in order to be the blood sacrifice to make a way for us to be redeemed then there is no salvation outside of that the Plan of Redemption was based on on God himself coming down to the Earth taking on a vessel not a separate God not a son in the way that we as human beings understand Sons but God coming down to take the form of human flesh in order for him to be the human sacrifice and the perfect Sacrifice by the blood blood of God are we saved which is the Holy Ghost so that it could go and take our place so that we could be redeemed in human flesh amen remember God isn't redeeming this human flesh he's Redeeming the seed uh the attribute the portion of himself that he placed in each and every one of us back to himself amen if you come from God you're going back to God if you had a beginning on this Earth unfortunately you will have an end but if you are a son or a daughter of God then you had no beginning because you originated in the mind of God and was expressed into an earth into an earth vessel so that you could be redeemed back to God Amen praise God so we're going to be looking at um you know some some different um thoughts and and we're going to just expand on it through the word of God and it's going to you know I know a lot of it is very familiar to most of us but there are young people and there are those that are tuning in online and uh you know um it's great that we're you know uh preaching on all the the mysteries of God but let me tell you there's no mystery that's greater than this one because this mystery includes you this mystery is the one that that calls every son and every daughter of God into the mystical body of Jesus Christ so that they can say I'm saved this is the greatest mystery of all Mysteries amen that's why it said without controversy great is the mystery of God am amen praise God so let's go to the next slide so there's denominational beliefs and I and I want to say too that um you know this slide presentation um there's a brother in the Philippines brother milanova okay uh who who puts these slides together and allows the the the preaching Brethren all over the world to use these slides and to um you know use them for PowerPoint presentations for times such as this so we modify them I look at them I modify them I review them and I use them but I want to acknowledge Him for the great work he's done thousands of these you know types of uh presentations and they're excellent amen so God bless him he's a pastor of this message in the Philippines God richly bless him I acknowledge Him for his great work amen and so uh uh denominational belief number one which is the trinitarian doctrine which says that the Holy Spirit the father and the son are three persons well that alone is saying that there's three powers occupying three Thrones in heaven that there's three individuals and that very thought right there is a discrepancy you know keep you know hit the hit the next slide it'll just continue um the this discrepancy in the is a is a uh in the doctrine is that there's three persons three gods and we know that right there that breaks the very first commandment which says that thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and thou shalt not put any other gods before me that's what the Lord said so the minute that you believe in a trinity you're you're actually believing in more than one God I know they want to explain it you know like one person explained it to me one time you know it's like a loony there's four quarters in a loony but it's still just a loony right no there's one God and there's three offices God the Father God come and create himself a son a body a human vessel to dwell in amen and then God the power the Holy Spirit God himself his soul his Essence his emanating power but it's all the same self-existent one amen praise God go to the next slide in Revelations 4:2 it said and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne not Thrones a throne was set in heaven and what does it say there threat on the throne no it says one sat on the throne amen praise God and so the minute we start to you know believe in Trinity and we start to put our own interpretation on on how we interpret God if it doesn't line up with the word of God then there's something wrong therefore the foundation of your faith right there has something in there that's completely flaw and without a proper Foundation when any kind of wind blows in your life and you're claiming God and you're confused whether you're dealing with God in heaven God on Earth God the Holy Ghost you're you're you're confused in in your approach to God then how can you have a a true revelation of your savior of your helper of your provider when you're confused amen praise God belief number two Eternal Father and eternal son there can't be two next slide discrepancy is that a son is begotten the word sunship signifies a beginning so if God has a son that signifies that God brought forth another being but that's not the case like a father and a son here on Earth there's two there that's not the way God is being described when he said that he gave his only begotten son it was that it was him trans trans transformed from the self-existent one a portion of himself come down to the Earth in the form of God purely God Amen not two separate beings number three Jesus in flesh is all three Jesus the body father son Holy Spirit discrepancy is why you know people will say well why did Jesus talk to his father if he himself is the father like when Jesus was you know um in the in the water and he was being baptized and a voice spoke from Heaven this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell in that was God communicating revealing to John that this was him come down the m Messiah because if you look back in the Old Testament we're going to be looking at a lot of background teaching right from the Old Testament it was Messiah it was the Lord God here ye oh Israel the Lord is one and that he'd be the mighty counselor the Prince of Peace the Everlasting father unto us a child is given it describes it in Isaiah exactly who he was he was describing the one and total and complete God the Father amen so the question is where do we stand which teaching do we believe how do we differ from all these denominational interpretations about the godhead is there a real true understanding of the godhead the the answer is yes and it is revealed purely by Revelation to the sons and the daughters of God Amen so let's look here now let's go to the next slide so before the foundations of the world there was Elohim which is the self-existent one God was self-existent he was all in all anything that ever had a beginning began from the self-existent one not two that's why there's no confusion once you've come into a revelation of who God is everything falls right into place in your salvation look at what it says here who only hath immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man hath seen nor can see God only reveals himself when he wants to reveal himself no man can say oh this is the interpretation of God God interprets himself God interprets his own word into each and every individual that walks this Earth and if God is not interpreting himself to you personally then you have not found him yet amen praise God next slide Isaiah 43: 10 and 11 and we're talking about Elohim the self-existent one before me there was no God form remember even the word god means object of worship that's why people worship other gods that's why God knew right from the very beginning when he gave Moses the Commandments the very first commandment he saw that people were worshiping Idols they were worshiping people they were worshiping animals and the very first thing that he said listen you got to get yourself straight here you got to worship me and only me and if you worship me and only me then you will know me and on that day ye shall know that I am in the father ye in me and I in you you see this is all about a relationship about God unveiling himself the mystery of God unveiling himself in each and every age and now to you and me in this age so before me there was no God form neither shall there be after me I even I am the Lord and beside me there is no savior well what do you do with that scripture when somebody says oh no Jesus Christ is the savior and people will claim that oh no no there there's God you know there's God in heaven and then Jesus was the son and then there's the Holy Spirit and all three are separate beings that all agree as one and they all exist together as one but there's three no it's very clear that this is the Old Testament Isaiah 43 it says besides me there is no savior so in other words God Messiah the Lord Elohim the self-existent one he's the only Savior Jesus Christ yes Jesus is the savior but Jesus Christ is God the word was made made flesh in the beginning was the word and if you go back in the beginning Elohim the self-existent one and the Word was with God and the Word was God but when God see God had all his thoughts in his mind but in order for something to manifest God had to speak his word that's why we use the foolishness of preaching because God is still speaking his word without the preaching of the word there is no salvation and people think salvation is just the one category oh my soul is saved yes that is salvation but there's a lot more in Salvation especially if you are still in a human vessel God saved you but he still continues to save you from day to day he continues because if you look up the actual word uh uh save savior it you know in Greek there's many different uh definitions and acronyms added to that actual word in there he's he he he he restores you he restores unto me the joy of his salvation how does he do that by the preaching of the word amen I believe it's in 1 Corinthians 1 verse1 17 if you read it it talks about the foolishness of preaching and how God has to preach the word of God and you know that in that savior word there's also healing that when you need to be healed that's why it's important that when we pray for somebody we speak the word of God the word of God has the power to go and heal because the word of God has power remember it comes from God Amen so he was the self-existent one but the word had to be expressed and so he was the word made flesh Jesus Christ God inh human flesh so that he could go to Calvary and take our place to redeem us and bring us back out of our Amnesia amen praise God so the characteristics of Elohim are one he's Eternal has no beginning and no end invisible hidden from the naked eye you cannot see God you must have faith in this Dimension to see the word to see God you need to see the word because the word is God and so when you see the word in your day and you recognize what it is that God is doing and what God has done and God sending us a prophet in the opening of The Seven Seals Amen in the in the in the opening of the of the uh the mysteries of the of the Seven Seals All the the mysteries of iniquity all those things being revealed in order for you to see that you must have the spirit of God you must be a a part of God you must have the word in you for the word to make contact deep call to the Deep amen he's omnipotent which means that he's all powerful there's nothing in your life that God can't deal with the foolishness of preaching can deal with absolutely everything that you are facing right now by the word of God you can receive everything everything that you need by the power of the Holy Spirit operating through the word of God Amen he's Omni powerful he's Omni potent it's all powerful he's omniscient there's nothing that he doesn't know you're worried about situations that that you you know a lot of you know us as human beings we create circumstances that don't exist here we are trying to figure things out you know and because we're human and you know we want to figure everything out beforehand we want to know that that this is how it's going to work out no once you've got faith in God knowing that he's omniscient and that he knows everything what are you getting so all puffed up about all concerned and all worried and all fearful when the god that you serve if you've truly come into a relationship with Elohim the self-existent one and you're not confused about a trinity or about who God actually is then that means you're walking with God and if you're walking with God and you know that he knows all things then there's nothing that you should fear but God himself to know that God knows all things amen he's omnipresent he can be anywhere and everywhere at the same time that's why we can pray for brother Doug Len knowing that God by the word that was spoken through our lips God can deal on the other side of Canada he's omnipresent amen praise God and what else he's infinite he's an infinite God he's absolutely uh without without end of possibilities so don't worry if you can't figure it out he's already already figured it out amen praise God and he's self-existing amen he doesn't create himself he's nonc created he's already he's always existed he's the self-existent one but he had a desire to bring forth a family amen praise God you know let me read read this from the book of adoption he says the word he's talking about self-existent one here Elohim the word means in the Hebrew the self-existence all by himself now listen carefully here he says nothing existed before him he was all existent there ever was self-existent Ella Elohim means the all sufficient all powerful Almighty self-sufficient self-existent one oh he says but in Genesis 2 when he made man he said I am yahushua Jehovah what did it mean I am the all existent one who was created something off of myself to be a son of mine or a temporary or an amateur little one of mine so all God did was he just expressed by his word himself and expressed himself into a son pay attention now oh Glory why he gave man Jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur God you see this relationship that we have entered into as Christians in the 21st century the time and the season that we're living in is a relationship where we come to realize that that same portion that was always in God is in us and it's not something that we receive here it's not something that you were born to a certain family and because you were born to a certain family that entitled you to God no your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundations of The World God already knew you before he expressed all of this Earth okay remember before if you go back to the beginning in the beginning God Elohim the self-existent one there could have been thousands of other existences before this one year there could have been other civilizations before this one here we're not interested in knowing all of that but we know because we know that God is infinite and God has no beginning and no end when somebody says well how do you explain the dinosaurs and so many million years ago we don't need to explain it it was there because God is eternal there is no time or space in God remember he said that that the face of the waters was on the earth and it was void but then when he started to speak and said let there be let there come forth let every seed bring forth of its own kind do you know that everything may have already and probably was all laying right there in the waters in the deeps of the waters and God would speak to those Waters and speak to those seeds to those previous civilizations whatever was there it's irrelevant we need to understand that With God all things are possible but you need to also tune into the existence and the and the the the the civilization and the Earth that you now occupy and God has a plan for this civilization for this Earth for you and for me amen praise God and so here he goes on and he says now listen he says Jehovah means that he gave man to be an amateur God because he is Father God and he made an amateur God so he isn't self-existent anymore he exists with his family you see when you come into a relationship knowing now who God is it's because you're coming into his family and you start to take on the qualities and the abilities of God in your life it's supernatural to understand this but that's what God is God is Supernatural That's why we believe that God's A Healer we believe that if somebody gets sick and the doctor gives a report that we pray and we believe God's word and God never said that it was going to happen when we pray and we believe we're not expecting it that it should happen the very moment if it does that's a miracle that's great but God said let there be light and who knows how long it took before the light actually came you see understanding that when God's word is perfect it's om it's omn poent it's omniscient it's omnipresent then we don't put limitations on God we believe the word we just believe the word and so when the word says lay your hands upon the sick they shall recover you know that their recovery could be that the fact that their body needs to be changed and they need to go to that other dimension that might be their recovery that's God's interpret ration of the recovery because life is only temporal here but if he chooses to heal your body and he chooses that you know the minister prays for you this week and you don't get the healing for two years it still doesn't change the fact that he's your healer and that you will hold to that to that truth and to that promise in the word of God because if you're a true son or daughter of God you can't disbelieve God's word this thing might get tired and it might you know get angry and it it'll fight up it'll do that all the time oh I don't think God is dealing with this and I don't believe God you know wants to help me in this area I don't believe you're just speaking the devil's language when you're doing that you need to say God is my healer when he wants to heal me he'll heal me he will interpret it himself self I don't need to try and interpret it if you're a true amateur God you come into that understanding and Revelation with God and your walk now is not a walk of fear a walk of Doubt a walk of wondering and and hoping it's a walk of Faith to know that God can do what he said he will do and he'll do it in his time not in my time and so here now he says he says you now he exists with his family amen Ella Elohim now now he's Jehovah and Jehovah's meaning is the one who exists with his family glory to God hallelujah you want to know about church this is the true meaning of church when you come to a realization of the god that you serve is not some trinitarian Doctrine and teaching but he's a living God that you now walk with have experienced and are experiencing every single day in your life even though you're a weak human being because when you're at your weakest point you know God is strongest in your life that's when everything can change when you can get all your pride out of the way get all yourself out of the way all your own thoughts and ideas out of the way and just allow God to come in and deal with whatever it is and trust that he's going to interpret his word amen now he is Jehovah now he's one who exists with his family now God made man to be the predominant over all the Earth he had dominion and the Earth was man's Dominion this is all scripture then if that's his domain he was God over the Earth he could speak and it would be so he could speak this and it would be so or there he is god Jehovah the one who once existed in self-existence but now exist with his family and his little ones with him there you are amen praise God hallelujah let's go to the next slide let's look at the attributes Elohim needed to be expressed and manifested Elohim and his thoughts amen a word is a thought expressed but the thing with God is when he expresses his thoughts they come into manifestation that's why you were a thought of God from before the foundations of the world but there would be a time and a season that you would have to come into manifestation as a Christian which is Christlike that's what the word means a son or a daughter of God Amen and so a word is a thought expressed and Elohim in his thoughts expressed god father savior healer priest and King but it's all the same person he wanted to be God he wanted to be worshiped he wanted you to recognize that he was the one and only true one that could be worshiped he wanted to be a father here on this Earth remember it's an expression father is only an expression of an Earthly experience but when you go back to your theophany back to the who you always were as an eternal son or daughter of God because remember if you're a son or a daughter you're Eternal you had no beginning you can have have no end you're just going to go back into the existence of God we call it the mind of God but it's a place it's a it's it's it's an existence that's so much greater and so much higher than what we're even seeing here eyes have not seen ears have not heard nor has it even entered into the heart of man into the mind of man what God truly has for us when we go back to our original State as Sons and Daughters attributes of God we call it Sons and Daughters we we we we identify it as male and female but that was only God expressing himself there is no real male and female when you go right back into the mind of Elohim it's God expressing himself in two ways as that within him is male and female but you see the world has taken all of that and perverted it and that's why you've got all these different genders and now you've got you know homosexuality and and and everything else because they've perverted the reality of God's word amen praise God he wanted to be a savior he wanted to be a Healer he wanted to be a priest he wanted to be a king amen the only way we can can know him in that way is we had to come into this civilization into this creation this is all the creation of God but we happen to be Eternal attributes in a created body living here in this earth let's move on he's going to be a judge too in the millennium so here now we go to the next slide and we look at Elohim and his thoughts and we look at Time and Time started When sin took place in the Garden of Eden and brought death that's why God is eternal there is no time in God the only reason that we deal with time is because of death now I know you know a lot of these things but this Foundation is so important for somebody to have a real experience with God and to enter into that relationship so that God you know you know listen when when God called me I remember when God called me 30 years ago it wasn't that God got me all excited that he had sent a prophet that's not what caught me it was the fact that God had revealed himself to me made himself known that I was actually loved by him that I I could actually have contact with the Living God that he that he that he became my healer because I was sick I was very sick and so were all of you in some way shape or form you were sick and you needed God to heal you and to take you out of that sickness people are in the world healthy you know exercising every day have the healthiest bodies and blood and everything else but they're sick without God because they're headed to one thing and that's death and death is separation from God so I don't care how healthy or how wealthy you might be if you don't have God in your life you're going to have an end and things are not going to get better things are only going to get worse because what has been prophesied for this Earth and what is already now taking place around us here on Earth just look at Israel and the state there and look at United States and the the the the separation and the division of the people and everything that's going on in the confusion in the churches and in the in the schools and the gender uh controversies and all of these we are in we are living in the days of Sodom the Bible said that as it was in the days of Sodom so will it be when God reveals himself to those that are that are predestinated to receive the word for their day the conditions are exactly where they are supposed to be that's why we don't need to be screaming out against it and protesting against it we need to be shouting that Jesus Christ is Savior Jesus Christ is your healer Jesus Christ can restore you back to who you really are you're in a spiritual Amnesia and you need to wake up out of it amen so time was the result of sin had there been no fall in the Garden of Eden there would be no death and death is is a definition of time if there was no time and you didn't die if there was no death you wouldn't care about time your body wouldn't age Amen in the beginning was was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh just like we said earlier Jesus Christ go on to the next slide and he says here in this great Fountain this great Fountain of spirit which had no beginning or no end this great spirit begin to form in the [Music] creation and the logos that went up out from it was the son of God that's why the word was with God and the Word was made flesh the word went out from God took on a human vessel not through a sex act because this had to be a perfect sacrifice this could not come through the original sin the original sin was a sex act it was it was in it took place in the garden of with the serpent and Eve and that's why there was two children born one came the other one able one a murderer and the other one had Revelation on what to bring to God and offer unto God Amen so many things that were revealed but here it was the only visible form that the spirit had and it was a theophany which means a body and a body was like a man that's from brother Brandon go to the next slide so the theophany image was expressed in Jesus Christ and that is showing to us what we are going to be go how we're going to be going back that we are going to actually go back to our theophany bodies which are Eternal bodies which have no beginning and no end you'll be exactly the way you were like when you were like 19 20 years old in your perfect youth that's the that's the body that's waiting for us amen and so in the beginning Genesis 1 in the beginning God created heaven and the Earth let's move on and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea the the the and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created Man In His Image own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them so here he was you know before this Earth came into its existence as we know it now God said let us so who was the us that he was talking about us we were there where were you when the sons of God sang around the throne and rejoiced around the throne with God before the foundations of the world where were you you were there but you came into this Earthly existence through a spiritual through a through a a spiritual Amnesia going into a human body and now by the preaching of the word you're being called back out of your Amnesia that's why line upon line precept upon precept that's why the word as we preach the word and as we bring forth the word of God it sets you more and more free into that relationship with God and into a relationship knowing who you are and who he is amen and so he created male and female and then he asked this question now let us who Father and Son make man in our own image it was God himself with his attributes because a son is just it's we it's a word but literally its attribute its expression it is the word the word being expressed amen praise God that's why we talk about the word the word the word you got to believe the word that's why when we say to somebody yeah but the word says and and yeah but my priest told me this it doesn't matter what your priest said it doesn't matter what the the psychology teacher said it doesn't matter what the the the the Oneness uh the the the you know New Age movement teaching says you need to understand what the word says you need to go back to the original word which is the mind of God and when you go back to the word of God you got to realize again that it's still going to take God to reveal himself to you it's not you trying to figure out God you see all the teachings of psychology and the teachings of man that's man's interpretation on the word of God but God says I don't need anybody to interpret my word I will come I will be with you I will be in you I will give you the spirit of Truth and it will reveal to you all truth you won't need to put your own interpretation because when you read the word and his spirit is in you to read the word you'll your conscious mind by the spirit connects with the word of God and says amen I see it that's why when somebody says repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you know that that name is the name of the father that's why when Jesus says go ye into all the world baptizing in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost and the the all the denominations out there they'll use that as as the scripture to back up their baptism they need to read that again it says the name go ye into all the world baptizing them in the name of the father listen my name is Dany I'm a father I was with my parents today I'm a son but my name is Dany doesn't change who I am just like Jesus Christ there's no other name I can show you scripture after scripture there's no other name whereby man must be saved but by the name of Jesus Christ in all that you do do it in the name of Jesus Christ because the name Jesus means Jehovah Our Savior it's God it's the same self-existent one amen praise God so second Corinthians next slide 2 Corinthians 51-2 so for we know that if our Earthly house this Tabernacle we're dissolved we have a building of God we have a body portion attribute peace of God that we represent that we go back to that's what salvation is all about salvation is being taken out of this world in all the tribulation that's going to come upon it to go back to your original state in a brand new body that had no beginning and no end a building of God and house not made with hands but Eternal in the heavens for in this we grown earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven in other words we're groaning for that theophany to connect and pick us up and take us out of this Dimension and that's what's going on when you hear the foolishness of preaching and the word of God being preached you're connecting with your theophany when you hear this word and you're hearing truth and you're saying amen praise God I see it it's because you're connecting with your Heavenly Body Hallelujah glory to God Amen that's the true relationship then not theophany go next then not theophany was made flesh in the person Jesus Christ and then all the fullness of the Trinity now brother bradam speaking he he talks about Trinity all the fullness of the Trinity meaning the father Son and Holy Ghost dwelt in him in the self-existent one both Father Son and Holy Spirit all in that all in that one self-existent one one and only true and living God not three Gods Not A Trinity but God the self-existent one listen when Phillip you know walked up to Jesus and said Lord show us the father Jesus looked at him he says Phillip have I been with you for so long if you see me you see the father it's not I that doeth the works but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works you see it's all over the scripture but then you you talk to trinitarians and and and because they do not have a revelation remember God needs to reveal to you that he he is God am until then you'll be you'll listen to Buddha one day and you'll say oh you know this guy kind of makes sense and then you'll the next day you'll start to listen to the New Age movement you start saying you know what this kind of connects and you'll start putting all these manmade interpretations on the word of God where there is absolutely no private interpretation the scripture says lean not unto your own understanding you need to hold on to the word of God the absolute truth make him Jehovah make him the absolute make him your your your savior period there's nobody else there's no other mediator somebody wants to pray to the Virgin Mary they want to pray to Saint this and saint that for this or for that there is no other mediator but Jesus Christ who is God hallelujah amen let's move on let's look at the Old Testament this is a study okay I trust that you know I know that you know a lot of this but it just you know I get blessed when I when I see all of this and I it just confirms that who I actually am it's confirming my existence as a son or daughter of God Amen praise God and the Lord went before them by day in the pillar of a Cloud to lead them in the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night the lord of the Old Testament the pillar of fire of the Old Testament is the same God of the New Testament amen praise God next slide God represented himself as the pillar of fire the cloud by day the shakina glory Mana from Heaven the brass serpent The Rock in the wilderness all the same God Exodus 13:21 and the Lord went before them by pillar in in a pillar of cloud to lead them oh we already read that one move on okay let's go on just keep going you're gonna come up to mzc who was mzc let's read it when Jesus was manifested brother Brandon back in Christ revealed in his own word when Jesus was manifested in the Old Testament in a theophany in the person of MDC not a priesthood but the person the man see for this man had yet not being born but he was in a theophany so he had no father no mother he was God that's who mzc was when he came down to meet Abraham it was God himself he was manifested in the form of a man called King of Salem which is king of peace and king of righteousness see he was MDC he had neither father nor mother beginning of days or ending of Life see it was Jesus in theophany in the form of a man could you go that so let's look at the next slide questions how did God ever become Our Savior did we have two saviors when Jesus came upon the Earth clue go to the next slide Isaiah 43:10 we read this before me there was no God form neither shall there be after me I even I the Lord and beside me there is no savior we already went through this but just to reiterate it to show it in the Old Testament that there is only one savior we want to know clearly who our God is amen praise God go to the next the blood Covenant Hebrews 9:22 and almost all things are by the law purged with blood that's why he had to come as a human he needed to create himself a human vessel so that blood could be shed for our sin amen because without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin and that's why God had to create himself a human body to to dwell in to go to Calvary let's move on he became human God is a spirit he had no hands till he became Jesus he had no feet arms legs and so forth till he become Jesus he come to a stable borned over a manure pile and little Jehovah crying in a little manger little Jehovah playing as a little boy little Jehovah toiling as a man he crossed his cast with us God become human when Jesus Christ was born God was human on earth he toiled and labored and felt for the teenager he went through every Temptation that we go through God did it and he might do it his own judgment Justice brother BR him back and show us the father go to the next slides and the great Creator became my savior come down to a little blood self not through a man but come virgin to a woman and took this little pollen from the woman and formed himself a little house and lived in it oh it ought to be striking Jehovah over a pile of manure in a barn crying Jehovah in a Manger of straw that's an everlasting sign amen Isaiah 9:6 and we're going to close with this let the musicians come it says For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace who was Isaiah talking about Jesus Christ the lord and savior that's why when you say the Lord Jesus Christ you're talking about the Father the Lord Lord Jesus the son Christ the Holy Ghost and all three are one are one you see why it's so important to know who God actually is because if you're not making him this god Jehovah God the god of the Old Testament Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the New Testament then you you can't even get baptized properly you'll believe in a baby baptism because your family was Catholic and they brought you up as Catholic and and they baptized you as a baby and you think that that's good enough but the Bible says he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved how does a baby believe you see all these things these are the very foundations of Christianity these are the foundations that if you don't start right you're going to be shocked on that day when the Rapture takes place and there's going to be a lot of churches out there that are going to be going to church on a Sunday morning and the Rapture will have already taken place because if you don't know that Jesus Christ The Same Spirit that raised Christ from the dead which is the the spirit of God if that spirit is not dwelling in you your body's not going to be quickened out of this Dimension you're going to be believing a Doctrine you're going to be holding to a Creed of man you're going to be holding to what you were taught and you're going to go into the church one morning and you're going to go to your priest or your pastor and you're going to say wait a minute here you were teaching me three Gods Trinity you were putting uh all these interpretations on the word of God and here now look at this world it's completely falling apart it's going into Great Tribulation and I'm still stuck here I thought I was supposed to go into Rapture but you see here's the Paradox if you are a son or a daughter of God you always were and you can't miss the Rapture the Rapture is for for the body of Christ it's for the called out Body of Christ it's that body that's going to go in the Rapture and Jesus said all that the father hath given me will come not one of them will be lost my sheep hear my voice not might hear hear my voice and so they will come when they hear this word in this way according to the word of God according to the scriptures that we've used here to back up that God is one God and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise God aren't you glad that you know him in that way Hallelujah glory to God what do you got brother down from his glory what a story evering story my God Jesus B to his own a strange my [Music] [Music] sorrow Oh [Music] how I bre
