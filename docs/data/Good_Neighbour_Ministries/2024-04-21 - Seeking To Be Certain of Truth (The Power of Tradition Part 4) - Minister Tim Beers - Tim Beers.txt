Living God in his presence knowing that the invisible one amen is present with us and he promised us that we will be able to see him he said the the prophet said that the bride will have the ability to recognize the word manifest in her midst in her day in her season amen and we know that he is the word hallelujah glory to God Amen it's good to be here we're going to continue on the series uh that I've been preaching on uh the power of tradition Hallelujah we talked about the last time uh about um going deeper Hallelujah into the truth now we want to talk about seeking to be certain of the truth hallelujah we want to be certain of God we want to be certain of our faith amen we want to be certain that what we're serving as individuals we want to know that the truth that we have is the truth amen and only he can reveal that truth to us hallelujah and that's what we seek for as individuals we seek we knock Hallelujah we per we we we go forward we press forward for that truth to be revealed to us amen because it's a constant unfolding of Truth in in this day and this hour though we got the message though the Seven Seals are claimed to be open and we believe they are but now they got to be open to us as individuals amen so let us uh turn to the word of God we got a uh four scriptures here seeking to be certain of the truth the power of tradition part 4 Hallelujah I got a I got a certain direction I want to go in here but like always amen God knows your your need this morning and may he speak to you if you got faith here this morning and you want to hear from God hallelujah then you you pull on the Holy Spirit to direct me Hallelujah you pray that God get me out of the way hallelujah amen Mark 14:22 then we're going to go to Hebrews 10:19 Luke 199 and Matthew 63233 Hallelujah before we do let's pray and let's pray for the need amongst us spiritually physically mentally this is an oppression age and we know that the the the pressure of this age is coming down and we could be affected but we have the blood we have the authority in the word of God that we can speak they might not have it out there but God has given it to us here to those who believe amen hallelujah father father we thank you Lord this morning that we can gather together you promis where two or three are gathered together in my name I'll be in the midst Lord Lord and we believe that we are certain in this hour of that father so Lord we seek for truth this morning Lord and we know that truth comes by the spirit the spirit of the Living God father not only speaker but hearer both of us together Lord let us be yielded vessels to your voice this morning Lord let us go beyond the curtain of time let's go beyond the curtain of this world in our flesh and our own ideas and our own thoughts even what we believe about ourselves father because most of the time what we believe about ourselves is a lie father the devil lies to us constant ly and tells us that we are not we are not but you are constantly telling us that we are we are father and that's the struggle and that's the Battle of this great age that we live in the most deceiving age father but you promise Lord it'll be the greatest age where the word would be revealed and the light would shine brighter in this age to the Bride of Jesus Christ come great Holy Spirit we Depend and need you this morning Lord bind every contrary Spirit father let your word go forth Lord in spirit and in truth Lord and heal and deliver the people wherever that that Deliverance needs father break the chains open the prison doors and set the captives free this morning because you have declared it is finished I have gained the victory I have overcome death hell in the grave now we can be free give us Faith this morning Father Faith sufficient for the journey father Grant these things Lord as that we commit ourselves to thee in the name of Jesus Christ we pray Hallelujah Mark 14:22 and as they did eat Jesus Took bread and blessed and break it and gave it to them and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and when he had given thanks he gave it to them and they all drank of it and he said unto them this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many Hallelujah Hebrews 1019 he break the bread he gave us bread in this hour he broke it he mean he opened up the word to us he gave it to us the bride took it amen he gave us the cup the blood his life the blood of the New Testament these scriptures mean something God gives the minister scriptures for a purpose and a reason now they have to be revealed Hebrews 10:19 having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holies by the blood of Jesus by a New and Living Way which he had consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having a high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a true heart this morning in full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering being certain for he is faithful that promised how many believe that amen amen Luke Luke 119 and I say unto you ask and it shall be given to you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open unto you Hallelujah ask this morning seek this morning knock Hallelujah you remember the woman with the judge she would not let him have any peace until she got her answer till the king seen her Hallelujah Matthew 63233 for after all these things do the gentille seek for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of these things but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you he just eliminated all your cares your wor worries your worldly possessions your loved ones your children he knows you have need of what you have need of and he's going to provide all those needs if you seek the kingdom of God first God bless you as you seated it amen glory to God just recapping a little bit from the last few services just to bring it up to date here be patient with me this morning Hallelujah this is not finished we're going to take this right into the part five we're going to bring it right into the right into the message but remember the church ages blend they never stop and end they blend so these messages are blend together any one of these serieses they they blend together amen amen so we're going to start breaking into the lean Church age this morning the Pentecostal age and the bride Age The Rapture Age The Eternal age which most people don't understand and don't recognize what's in the message hallelujah amen hallelujah Jesus said You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free Hallelujah there's a very very fine line there in truth a lot of people think they know the truth and especially in this message because they got the letter of the message they think they know the truth but remember when the spirit of Truth is come it will guide you and lead you into all truth so you can't know truth unless the spirit of truth comes and reveals it to you hallelujah oh my in the days of Jesus the Pharisees and Sadducees and the scribes they created hundreds of traditions and the oral law to cover or make none effect of the Mosaic law Jesus broke the church Free by fulfilling all the law we're not under the law we're under grace amen the law had a purpose and the law has has a purpose in our life amen but the law is fulfilled under Jesus Christ the blood the life amen the token of this hour Hallelujah and people still don't recognize that in his fullness and that's where the Lord wants to bring his bride to Hallelujah into that fullness of understanding we cannot be that Mighty church we cannot be that Mighty Army until we fully recognize who we are and we're in that process this morning every morning every day we're in that process amen of moving forward Hallelujah God Don't Look Back God don't have any pleasure in people who draw back in their faith he looks for men of God with backbone women of God with backbone amen we are not weak people people we are rugged people we are soldiers of the Cross we are the most mentally strong P people on this face of this Earth that are walking on this Earth we are determined with a purpose we are certain that God is with us amen that's what kind of people we are oh when people rise up and they know who they are more and more that's what that anointing is created around your life that confidence comes around they're talking about being positive they're talking about being confidence out there but nothing is more confident amen and positive than this word of God when it gets into an individual Hallelujah and that's why we're here this morning is that why you're here or you just come to church pat yourself on the back I'm a message believer I'm religious I believe God sent a Prophet I believe in the prophet I believe in all these great stories so does the devil probably believes it more than you because he's felt the effects of it then we see the Dark Ages the Roman Catholic Church bringing in the nickel ladyann Adan Spirit we talked about that they br it in in remember the Bible says that the Gentiles like to exercise authority over one another they put all the categories in all the headships in of man and all that is to do is to eliminate God out of the process you're not allowed in anymore Holy Spirit they kick them out when they do that Hallelujah God has offices but those offices are gifts they're yielded Val vessels to God for God to have the prence in them that the Holy Spirit can flow through them Hallelujah he didn't set up any of these organizations denominations none of these things that man has set up hallelujah amen at the end of the leosan church age came the prophet to bring the bride into the fullness of the truth again because the message started in a Pentecostal age that's where it started the prophet comes at the end of the age it was the Pentecostal age that the prophet came to just recapping here amen hallelujah amen and grew until the opening of The Seven Seals thus when the age changed again until the Eternal Church age then it became the brides age then the messenger amen changed over like like John said say I must decrease Hallelujah do we see the type I must decrease John the prophet so that he Christ can increase what came down on the mountain what was the cloud all about who was that Hallelujah the mighty Angel amen but people are still feeding off the Pentecostal age it's all the message but not recognized when the age changed and God turned a corner and we talk about going deeper into the truth and not staying shallow in his word but digging and moving into the opening of the word bringing us into the Capstone age Hallelujah that's just a recap what we've been speaking on Amen now the word seek [Music] Hallelujah attempt to find something attempt or desire to obtain or achieve something ask for something from someone pursuing hunting searching for it out chastening chasing it down shopping for it seeking for it Hallelujah we think that we don't have to seek we think we don't have to find we think we don't have to knock in this hour we think we have it all because we have the tapes because we have the books because we come to church my brothers and sisters this is the most deceiving age where Satan is trying to make the church well he is making the church but not the bride lukewarm lazy spiritually lazy powerless in this hour we should be people amen determined to know the truth if it's stirred in our hearts I know when when the truth struck me and this light struck me I didn't know a lot but I know it was real I know something touched me like no other thing could touch me amen something healed me and delivered me I didn't know who it was what it was but when not touched me and changed my life I knew my life was changed Hallelujah and I from that day was seeking and finding to this day I haven't stopped I'm more determined to seek and find out truth I am still growing in this truth and growing in this understanding amen because I'm still here the Rapture it hasn't taken place yet the Rapture is on but the event hasn't taken place Hallelujah so I'm seeking I'm knocking Lord Jesus every day every moment that I wake yes I'm living and moving and and and and and living my life like like it looks like on the outside like everybody else but inside inside there's been a birth there's there's been a change hallelujah amen knocking something producing a noise oh God we need to produce a noise amen hallelujah we need our voices need to be heard our Praises need to be heard our requests need to be heard we need to come boldly Before the Throne of God Amen oh God hallelujah amen she knocked on the window to attract his attention we need to attract the Lord Jesus this morning we need to attract his attention into our lives more Hallelujah we need to attract him here this morning to do great things that need to be done in our lives this morning it's not the preacher amen it's not any individual no man it's the man Christ Jesus that we need to attract here this morning the moving of the Holy Spirit the pillar of fire in our midst amen hallelujah which the churches are pushing them out in this age oh they don't like the supernatural they say it's only with brother brandham and if you try to reproduce it amen is he the same yesterday today or forever I'm looking for the same God I don't know about about you the meaning of fine do as she not lights the candle and sweep the house and seek dilig till she finds it and when she had found it Luke 152 to meet to discover something not before seeing or knowing he said to him we have found the Messiah in John 1:3 to obtain by seeking asking and it shall be given to you seek and you shall find Matthew 7 hallelujah oh my hallelujah amen my brothers and sisters we assemble ourselves together this morning amen because the anointing we believe in the anointing We Believe an anointing breaks the Yoke that's why we assemble ourselves together coming to church don't save you attendance don't save you Hallelujah but we gather together because of the anointing amen I know by experience I I've had circumstances we all have circumstances from time to time where we can't make it amen hallelujah and the people that are online right now that don't want to come in and assemble themselves together because they can watch it online that yoke is what breaks amen that anointing breaks the yoke when we gather together I've been online I've watched and I've been blessed but I know when I need to be set free when I know I got a situation that has hindered me I come together amen where the anointing is with the bride of Jesus Christ there's something in our midst amen it's not just you or just me it's him as We Gather that's his promise As We Gather he breaks that yoke let me say it to you get in his presence get together for that purpose and that reason we come together under the anointing of God to break the Yoke you stay home you stay home amen you find yourself in bondage more and more and more come into the midst where the anointing breaks the Yol and for those who are on online I'm saying what's on my heart for those who are online don't sit there in your living room and watch these Services eating uh fooling around what do you think this is amen this is God if this is God here and you believe it's God there then respect it consecrate that place when me and my wife got together we're watching from home because we have to for a circumstance we shut everything off we shut our phones off we treat it like we're in the house of God to listen to the word of God you think God can't speak to you there you think he can't visit you there the pillar of fire well show him that sincerity and respect wherever you are hallelujah amen people in this age we got everything good we got technology we can hear wherever we want to hear but let me tell you this Pentecost is pente cost is still a cost it's still a fight amen man we still got to press into the kingdom with violence hall hallelujah hallelujah I'm not just your nice uh padic preacher here amen I don't patch you on the back Hallelujah I don't need your sympathy amen I don't need you to like me if you do thank God for that I'm here to preach the word of God Amen Hallelujah we must be certain of God when perfect Faith Comes and reveals something to you you are certain of your position you are certain of your calling you are certain of your circumstances that all things work together for good and you know where you stand because you are certain you're not running to and fro from one place to another in your mind and your thoughts but your faith is real it stands on substance it stands on a solid foundation it stands on on the Rock revelation of the revealed word of the hour because it's been revealed to you Hallelujah that's what we're striving for that's what we're knocking for amen that's what we want to be certain of too many people are not certain of who they are questioning who they are remember this is Manifest in time the fruits are on the vine Hallelujah this has never been an age where God's word's going to manifest the two seeds are here in this hour Hallelujah and the bride has the ability to see that manifestation of the word of God hallelujah amen people in this message got this word of God got this word of life and not certain not known where they are that's why they're running to and fro here and there thinking that the word is everywhere I can go here I can go here not knowing not being led by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit to be led under a man of God that's going to preach to you the truth you're being deceived you're getting caught into a web hallelujah hallelujah amen 1959 be certain of God brother Bram speaking here God was testing him he know he offered the burnt offering he come by the way of the blood he know that God was God he know that God answered prayer and God was testing him and he brought him out victoriously because he was certain of God if you are certain of God you take him at his word for anything he says you're not if you're not certain that he is God and that this Bible then you better be careful of what you are doing Hallelujah you better know where you stand in this hour amen hallelujah but if you are certain of God and you met his requirements what is his requirements the new birth being born again you must be born again Hallelujah being born again is not because you understand God said a prophet being born again is not because you believe this message born again is an experience a life amen has awakened you changed you from Inside Out Hallelujah that's what we're seeking for that's what we want to be certain of hallelujah oh a lot of people got the message a lot of people got the message a lot of people don't know that they're born again you want to be truthful Hallelujah listen I know the experience I had when God touched me I know what he was doing in my life but was I certain at that time that it was the new birth I fought for years and years I fought the enemy of deception he'll come and try to deceive you and deceive you and let me tell you one thing if you're sitting here all lovey-dovey all message pepped up and you're you're a good message uh believer amen everything is going good in your life remember the devil ain't after because he's got you already but if you're sitting here and my God it's such a battle to understand that this experience that you got in your life is God Amen and Satan is fighting you with lies and deception and doubt then you're on the right track you're one step ahead of them and that's where you need to keep going keep pursuing keep knocking keep seeking the word of God in this hour hey hallelujah amen that Eternal rest faith cannot be based on Shi and Sands of man's theologies but Faith takes a solemn stand upon the Eternal Everlasting Rock of revelation of God's Eternal Word it rests on that unmovable you understand it's unmovable you can't move it you can't you can't sway or shift God when you're on that Rock that Rock don't move from underneath you amen that rock is solid you can be certain of that you can be certain God is is is faithful and true to his word and any Deliverance that you need anything you need in your life you can be searching of God will stand on his promises and fulfill his promises in this hour oh even this body change even this Rapture is becoming a mystery in this message people are starting to drift away from it Hallelujah didn't they say that in the Bible Hallelujah some Faith was overthrown some people preaching that the Rapture is already gone Hallelujah the change is already gone Hallelujah they might not be saying it in those words Hallelujah but they might be preaching a message to you Hallelujah uh project a message to you that the body change can happen what what oh my preaching perfect faith is not preaching you to stay here hallelujah not preaching you to be a good church member all those things are good perfect Faith preaching is that you may die you may reject yourself you may die out to yourself every day amen that you may lose your mind and gain the mind of Christ amen that's what perfect Faith preaching is hallelujah preaching faith into you the body change into you amen that you can be changed Hallelujah glory to God Amen this is the age where Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God this is not the age of of man God uses man speaks through man and he anoints man but it's not man is God's absolute and supreme authority because man sees through a glass Darkly this is the age where God is on the scene hallelujah our supreme authority is him we recognize that it's him in our midst not man Hallelujah too much man mixed into this message we're not man's not supposed to touch this this precious word with their hands do you understand what that means spiritually I'm saying it naturally but they're not supposed to touch it they're not supposed to interpret it they're not supposed to put their own opinion on it hallelujah hallelujah well brother Tim what you're preaching here is that your own opinion go search it for yourself Hallelujah Paul said I praise you that you go search the scripture go search the message study the message ask God to open up your eyes and open up your understanding Hallelujah glory to God Hallelujah the Bible says in Hebrews 11 the word of God is sharper than a two-head sword the zerner of the thoughts and tense of the heart the revealed word is the supreme authority and the Eternal messenger is here to speak and reveal and interpret his word nobody else nobody else can do it we see that the prophet came in the first poll second poll and third poll and we see that he tried to explain to the people the first pole the angel rebuked them he did it with the second pole and the angel rebuked them you see man oh yes man Prophet or whatever it is whatever gift whatever but man but he says this third pull nah you're not going to touch it no man's going to touch it nobody's going to try to interpret it but it's left in his hands and His Hands alone and that's what people don't want in this hour they want the first two poles of the message so they can interpret it so they can understand it Hallelujah but the Bride of Jesus Christ amen she is called she's predestinated and elected there's a seed of God in her that she goes into that third pole amen where he reveals it all to her because she's invited in there amen oh you don't like to hear this preaching amen like Pentecost don't like to hear about uh predestination and election they don't like to hear it they hate it amen people in this message don't like to hear about the two seed the two Vines Hallelujah the twins the bride twins at the end Hallelujah coming right down to the end hallelujah oh so that you may know who you are hallelujah hallelujah living behind the veil is not living outside of the veil or going in and out maybe you're in between stage not in not out Hallelujah a lot of people's experiences right there you're not in you're not out Hallelujah you got the seven Church ages Hallelujah you see that then you see the Gap in between the caps Stone which is the holy spirit then you see the Capstone the love the son of man that's the bride age that's the Eternal age Hallelujah in the message you have all those seven Church ages displayed in the message you're reading them you're listening to them but there was a Chasm that the prophet experienced Hallelujah and he went into the Capstone and that's the same way we have to be it's the same process that the bride goes through in her experience with God hallelujah amen you see but when a person lives behind the veil they manifest the same life that the wave sheet in this hour your life your thoughts your words your emotions your feelings your decisions your choices and your actions they see Christ in you you watch differently than other people in the message I don't want to walk like some people in the message wear my cowboy hat my Bob buckles and try to put on something holy on the outside Hallelujah I'm like I'm like Paul chiefest of Sinners I make more mistakes than anybody else I'm not here to perfect the flesh Hallelujah I'm here to grow Amen in his Perfection thank inside Hallelujah this out man is perishing every day but the Inside Man is renewing every day that's the new man that's the man I'm focused on that's the man I feed the word of God and the truth and it will reflect it will reflect but remember you don't find you're never going to get perfection in this flesh but a lot of people are striving and interpreting this message to be perfection in the flesh fesh how much they can bring this flesh under subjection Hallelujah if a true son and daughter of God tries that God will allow you to fall in your flesh in your sin just to show you Perfection does not come by the flesh hallelujah amen hallelujah you walk different than people in the message remember the High Calling God deals with you differently he speaks to you differently he doesn't allow you to do things that other Christians other message Believers are allowed to do I'm surprised I'm I'm I'm I'm shocked at how people live their lives in this message how they interpret the message but God doesn't deal with them in a way that he deals with the bride hallelujah amen hallelujah and the atmosphere around your life is different this is a person who has crossed over into the Eternal age the bride age no more living in the past Pentecostal age but see after the Seven Seals were open our Prophet was no longer in the leosan age spiritually speaking Hallelujah the lalene age the Pentecostal age was over we are still naturally and our flesh is naturally in the leoan church age but we have crossed over H Allelujah the Revelation in us has crossed over into the Eternal Church age where he is our messenger the mighty Angel people can't understand that when you say the prophet of Malachi 45 is no longer our an our messenger they don't understand that what do you mean what do you mean what do you think the voice his voice was actually the literal voice of God or do you think everything he said was thus sayeth the Lord then that would make him God Almighty which some people believe that spiritually speaking and th and his message was no longer a Pentecostal message so what am I trying to say hallelujah the new birth in this hour is through the opening of the seals the revealing of the word of God the changing of the corner the changing of the age the changing of the dispensation spiritually speaking amen a lot of people are born again by a Pentecostal message in this message they have a Pentecostal experience born again and haven't crossed over and that's why preachers Mighty preachers better than me I'm not even really a preacher oh my you talk about taking the quotes and taking this and taking that but let me tell you the Bride of Jesus Christ can discern amen God has given her the ability to discern Hallelujah people just swallowing up oh come over to this Mighty preacher great revival going over here you should see the way this person preaches the word of God over here not recognizing their feeding off of pent costal message lot of these ministers come out of Pentecost I'm not here to criticize nobody I'm telling you the truth I'm telling you the truth whether you like it or not Hallelujah I love everybody and all the Brethren and God helps some of these men great man in this message who are you brother Tim in your eyes I might be nothing but that's the way God is see the the the the thing has come back around again where people look who are you Jesus we got the Pharisees Sadducees when brother Brandon was on the scene who are you we got these theologians here now the Bride of Jesus Christ the true bride is going to come on the scene who are you the St the stage is set again it took what 50 60 years after the prophet left for the message to get to the place now the scriptures can be fulfilled again history can repeat again again now the bride will go through she's a wave sheet she'll ride this Trail again that the prophet road that Jesus went through that she has to fight through now she's going to fight through the same unbelief amongst the same people in this hour and this day but she's going to have the true elected amongst her too amen are you that Hallelujah I'm not pointing no fingers at nobody I know I'm pointing my fingers but I'm not pointing no fingers at nobody I'm not here to judge I'm not here to say who's God's chosen ones and who's not God's chosen ones amen God deals with us as individuals it's it's for you to know it's for you to be certain of God and where you stand this morning a lot of things are being said in a lot of different directions this morning Hallelujah and we need the holy spirit amen we need the filter of God to filter everything and interpret to you and what you have need this morning if all you can get out of this message this morning is I need to seek more I need to knock more I need to be more certain of God in my walk then you take that this morning and you go with that but preaching the truth castes out Devils castes out unbelief this is a deception don't think there's not a deception in this message where's the Devil he's the Clos is always to the truth Jesus was close to Judas all down Through the Ages that's where he's going to be where was he with Eve he took the word has God not said has not the prophet said that's where he's at Hallelujah if you realize this morning I'm fighting for you whoever you are I'm fighting for you I'm on your side if you recognize that and realize I'm not your enemy Hallelujah I'm for you this morning but the enemy is the devil Satan's purpose is to deceive us into discrediting the word as he did Eve and cause her to have different ideas and beliefs than of what God has spoken this is what he has done with the denominational thinking today in a different thinking to God's thinking it will separate us from God which results in death Amos 3:3 how can two walk together andless they be agreed we cannot agree with him until he reveals it to us until we walk with him hallelujah amen 1965 Satan's Eden and now we find out that every seed brings forth of his own kind there there was no death in in the Eden we are now entering where Satan is taken the throne as the Antichrist in the Eden of this Earth the Eden of sin perverted religion he started out not by saying I am Satan I am the great Angel no not upon that but upon perverting God's word hallelujah what so if he didn't come out in that way and come out with that kind Ministry but he come out and pervert in God's word what does he take then what does he take yes that's what he takes [Music] Hallelujah and that's how he has brought his kingdom in every age and now in this great deceitful age ready to take his throne by his people he's built himself an intellectual educated scientific Eden right down scientific preachers scientific Church scientific theology everything is scientific everything is based on knowledge not in this message right not in these message churches the whole church is built upon knowledge let me tell tell you my brother and sister is the message of the hour built upon as as as a whole perfect Faith hallelujah amen the power of traditions stops the teachings stop you from going deeper in the revealing of the word in your position tradition closes the door of your heart and the Holy Spirit cannot come into that heart into that experience when you place believe in something else than the revealed word it's your belief core and not letting the truth come in the word oh man we have a belief core in this message this is the strongest the strongest belief core in the world today you think the Catholics are strong in their belief core oh nothing stronger than the message M and when a message believer right gets to a place where where they believe what they believe that belief core is strong around them Hallelujah you're saying oh brother Tim that's good yeah it might be good it might be it might be negative too H Allelujah because remember this is an unfolding of Revelation like I said before a preacher said to me he said brother everything is revealed everything is there nothing needs the the grow and mature I said yeah it's all here but it has to be open up to the individual it has to grow and what a lot of people don't understand that brother bradam had to grw grow in faith the evidence of the Holy Ghost is love he did not say that Hey listen I believe that this Prophet is a prophet of Malachi 45 he's a true Prophet but I realize he's a man and he had to grow in his position because I glorify not a man I glorify God and I see God in a man perfecting a man allowing a man to grow and grow and grow in faith then then an angel have to come to him and say listen we and even brother Brown said when an angel comes to you and corrects you on your teaching and on your Doctrine Hallelujah so that's what's happening my brothers and sisters and we develop a belief core amen and remember when we start out in this Journey this experience with God this Enlightenment that has happening to you it's a constant Revelation that is unfolding and Satan is trying to bring tradition he's trying to bring law he's trying to bring all these deceitful ways in your path into the path of a true seed but remember the true seed will overcome Hallelujah they'll overcome every snare every trap everye doubt deceiving thing that comes your way why because of man because of a great ministry no because the Holy Ghost is determined in her life to bring this word to to truth to Enlightenment even I can't preach what's on my heart even I can't no man can Hallelujah no man in this message can and when you think any preacher in this message has it well this brother has it he preached this he preached he has it all he explains it all you cannot explain the Holy Spirit you cannot do his job no man could do his job and that's where they're got it wrong that's where they're built on knowledge and intellectual in this message when this Peter who has it revealed to you Flesh and Blood hasn't revealed it to you my father has revealed it to you they could have been around Jesus seen everything that he done for 100 years until the Holy Spirit came and revealed that that he was the son of God hallelujah amen 1962 convinced and concerned as we move along here there come Martin Luther John Wesley I believe they are angels of the church ages as we pass through the Philadelphia age the thyra age and right now down to the leoan age and the most pitiful sight of all of it is that leoan church age because Christ was put outside of his church and was knocking trying to get back on the inside again okay if I just go on to the next statement you're going to believe believe in your mind that that's them out there no no no no lot of this message is in this leoan church age a lot of the mess churches are fulfilling that scripture right there Jesus knocking knocking on your hearts knocking on you trying to get back inside because what theology knowledge your own interpretation has put him on the outside in this hour the only age remember the prophet came to the Pentecostal age this is the age where he's put out the only age of his church that's right yes that's right the church that we come into Christ the anointed word trying to get back after it's been put out Revelations 3:14 and unto the angel of the Church of Leos and write I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold or hot I would rather thou cold or hot then because Thou Art luk War neither cold or hot I will spew thee out of my mouth that's this age that's not out there that's here we know what they have fulfilled we know their position in the word of God hallelujah the law is not going to re reveal to the bride who she is in this hour it's going to take those opening of those seals those Mysteries being revealed to show her who she is that's why we go deep into Christ that's where the treasures are that's where she recognizes who she is being an invincible Army that can only happen when she goes deep into Christ Christ bringing her experience deeper and deeper hallelujah amen the opening of those Seven Seals was the beginning of the Deliverance of bondage of the great whor off the false teachings and all her lies about the Bible it revealed her Traditions her dogmas her Creeds was not God's word the Lord Jesus was setting his bride free to Manifest this life to this generation the rising of the Sun the quickening power did that to us the quickening power let us see his coming the quickening power St snatch us out of death to life the quickening power gives us discernment to know what's wrong with you and what to do what you have done what you ought to have done and what you should have done and what you will be you see that's the quickening power that did all these things and that's the quickening power that's going to do those things to us in this hour he amen we have to eliminate everything that is associated with ourselves and man with this message we must come into Union agreement not with man's opinions and interpretations or any organization or organism but with with the revealed word and that seed produces the new birth a true word birth is not a false word birth 1 Peter 1:23 being born again not of corruptible seed but Incorruptible by the word of God which abideth forever not being born again of a Pentecostal message in this leoan church age but being born again into the new Eternal Church Age The Rapture age Hallelujah recognizing Hallelujah Hallelujah stay with me here hallelujah I'm trying to get to my points Amen in the time of The Exodus and the crossing over of the Red Sea the pillar fire made the difference amen it's always been the pillar of fire that makes the difference in our lives not just around the prophet and over his head but in our lives in our in our lives in our heart is always been the pillar of fire that makes the difference hallelujah amen on one side Israel saw light but on the other side of the pillar of fire think about it think about it on the other side of the pillar of fire the Egyptians saw Darkness oh my you're telling me this light this word this revelation of this hour is bringing light to some and the same Pillar of Fire is bringing Darkness to others amen he says God will be his own interpret to his bride and Jesus ministry went to another level of understanding the Jews did not understand what he was preaching and John 8:12 when he spake again Jesus saying I am the light of the world he that follow me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life don't understand that saying in this hour that we're living in that Jesus Christ is the light oh my the crossing over into the Capstone side is light the pillar of fire behind it behind the inner Veil and the other side is Darkness the church ages only in this day has the church age become Darkness because of the Capstone and the crossing over remember this age was totally blacked out and we've been hear in the series the messages from our pastor I mean of the eclipse a total blackout another one just happened you think it was just a a natural event my brother it's a spiritual type here there's another blackout in this message one side is seeing light the other side is seeing total darkness there's another separation that is taking place now another breaking away that's happening now the angel is dividing amen the shaft is dividing the wheat from the shaft again it's gone to another level my brothers and sisters this thing is moving up and moving up amen out of the church age into the Capstone that Capstone is going to take off one day the Rapture that's our experience that's what God is typing that's what God is showing he always shows it in the heavens before he manifests it on Earth manifests it in the bride's life that's her sign she has the ability to recognize those signs what God is doing didn't Jesus say oh you can discern this the the the the the skies and all that stuff but why can't you discern the signs of the times why can't you see that the kingdom of God has come he said to them in that day it's the same today the same things are taking place these things are signs to the Bride of Jesus Christ she knows she's certain that the Rapture taking place she knows that the Rapture just kicked into another Gear with inside of her oh my glory to God that's why some will bring them Joy some great despair weeping and wailing and nashing of teeth the ones who are closest to the truth but didn't get it didn't press through in this hour not certain of God we're crossing over into that little room where the Lord told brother brandham I will meet you there I'm not going to meet you in any church I'm not going to meet you under any great personality great ministry I'm going to meet you in that little room oh when brother Ram got separated remember he's the wave sheet he got separated I look at the wave sheet don't get me wrong because I see the process I see how God dealt with that man and if I see the same thing happening in my life I know I'm walking on the right Trail I don't care about my mistakes I don't care about my falling Downs amen you fall down you get back up you make a mistake you make it right and you keep going forward Hallelujah something inside you got to be pressing you forward the spirit of God calling you forward inside of you press on keep pressing on the angel said Hallelujah you don't know what's waiting for you I say to some of you today you don't know what God has a waiting for you Revelation understanding of the word of God but you got to press through you got to overcome those things in your life you got to break your ideas you're you got to break your interpretation your own thoughts you got to die to those things they can't come in that little room where God is yes God is leading you amen God is moov it in your life but you're in you're out and you're not certain of God God you know you're not certain of God people who are certain they know you got an experience when when Moses met that Pillar of Fire he was certain of God he heard The Voice through the pillar of fire he knew is God hallelujah that's where God wants to bring you I don't care where you are how great your faith is how small your faith is it doesn't matter about that it's the seed of God inside of you that's pressing through that dirt that mud is that little Lily pressing through the mud Hallelujah glory to God Amen Hallelujah the little room of the seven seal revealing himself to the bride where is the total Secret sudden secret going away of the Bride of Jesus Christ a Separation by Revelation that's the bride's identification did you hear that it's a total secret it's a total secret so why why we still believe in amen that in the message it's all being revealed by the preachers it's a total secret to the individual that's only revealed by God himself Hallelujah you think I can bring you the understanding of this what he's talking about no no that's not the purpose of uh me standing up here I know my purpose I know my calling it's in a rem where your eyes cannot see that's why you're confused amen that's why you don't fully understand what's taking place what's happening this morning that's not my calling to make you understand that's that's no man's calling it's in that secret place where it's a total secret to the individual between you and God and when you know God is revealing that and you've been in that place with God then you know who you are you know who you you who you're called amen you know that you don't need no man to convince you you don't need to know man to tell you that you're born again or you're or you're this or you're that we encourage one another we strengthen one another we that's why we constantly pray for one another amen because we're all going through a journey we're all going through a process amen we're all going through a fight and a battle to what to get into that Capstone to overcome remember in every age is it's given to the Overcomer to them that overcome to them that overcome we got to overcome and Order order to receive what has been given to us this is not been given to us my brothers those tapes are not what God has given to us it's what's behind it it's him behind it that's been given to us and that's why we have to overcome Hallelujah glory to God Amen Hallelujah and now we find in that in each one of those ages usually people don't want to believe it because they're already set in their ways you're turning a corner you're building a building and then you get to the corner and everybody wants to keep running straight straight ahead oh isn't that today spiritually speaking everybody in this message want to build the building they want to go straight ahead and build a building I'm not only talking naturally I'm talking spiritually they want to go straight ahead but listen to brother bradam they don't want to turn a corner we're not building a wall like we start off in Luther message go right straight down the line right down to the Pentecostal message we are turning a corner we're turning Corners we are building a building God's word is the blueprint anybody can run a straight line but it takes a Mason to turn a corner right brother Chris it takes the power of God to do that it takes an anointing from Heaven to be sent down to do that upon you it has in every age and in those Prophet ages the word of the Lord comes through those prophets and they turn those Corners made those differences but the builders what they want to build a wall it's not a wall at all it's a building a building of God there's where we get those Junctions of time mixed up there's where it's hard for the people to understand that God has turned to Corner amen God has turned a corner in brother bram's Ministry you see it but a lot of people don't even recognize that God turned a corner in his ministry after the opening of the seals where he said the Bible became a new Bible to me and he said I'm not a Pentecostal preacher anymore go look it up for yourself I'm not a Pentecostal preacher anymore I'm not in the Pentecostal spiritually age anymore but I've crossed over to the Eternal Church age I've crossed from Death unto life amen when you're born again in this hour you cross from Death unto life amen hallelujah glory to God he turned that corner and he went in into the calstone in behind the inner Veil his life changed his walk changed everything about him changed his ministry changed did it get more [Music] popular isn't that where they said he went off remember what I said earlier the word of God will always repeat itself will always come to pass history always repeats itself remember all righteousness must be fulfilled right Jesus Paul brother brandham now the bride must ride this Trail again brother brandham ain't coming back he ain't rising from the grave if you believe in that kind of nonsense you're not even in leoan church age you're in some other age called crazy yes I just speak as I speak we that are here today are the evidence of that seed of God let me try to start winding this down in this there is the seed that must pass through many trials confusion uncertainties but it grows and comes out of all of that and that that Faith grows into more perfect faith and that's what's bringing that Born Again into that little room means when you when you born as a baby into this world you don't know nothing about this world but as you grow your understanding grows and you realize that you were born into this world isn't that the truth every one of us here were born we didn't understand when we were born what world were you born in what the world was all about but now you sit here today and you realize what you were born into and if you're only born into this world the most miserable are you because if you if this is your world and this is your joy and your peace God help you but when you're born again you're born into a new kingdom a new world that was the kingdom that Jesus was talking about he says my subjects are not of this world or you have a kingdom yes I have a kingdom Hallelujah but you know nothing of this Kingdom he said to them Hallelujah but my own know my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah now the mystery continues the ministry continues The Voice continues everything is continuing to for the Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour it did not stop with the prophet the Holy Ghost did not stop when the prophet left the scene the Holy Ghost is here bringing his word to pass again in us the bride fulfilling his word revealing his word in us today and when the son of man is being revealed again in Bride form see this message without Revelation makes religious people that's all it does makes religious people the most wickedest people as our former Pastor said and he's been around for 60 something years most wickedest people most evil hatred people are right here in this message the Pharisees and Sadducees oh they look so nice on the outside oh yeah so nice but inside Jesus says I know your heart your dead men bones inside there's darkness and wickedness in there Hallelujah you can dress this mess as all you want you can look holy you can put on the fruits of the spirit but oh my this message is going deep now it's getting inside a people a bride of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah Christ is walking this Earth again and be able that Des ear the very thoughts and Tents of the heart again in this day oh it happened in the prophet's life amen you couldn't be in a room with a prophet and not know he not know your thoughts in your heart ah he knew why because it was the the the gift of the Prophet just the gift it was the Holy Ghost in the prophet amen it was the Life of Christ where's that life today it's here just like he said with the serpent seed he said oh God he was crying out to God where is it where is it and the Holy Spirit said it's here it's here my brothers and sisters it's here what you seek for it's here what you're asking for it's here in our midst Hallelujah glory to God Amen I'm going to have to skip over a lot of things and bring it in part five Hallelujah revelation of Jesus Christ the devil fights that he cannot stand it oh yeah he's fighting this morning I know he's fighting this morning that's okay God's in control amen hallelujah he knows that if the people get a true revelation of the true church and that's what is needed in this hour most deceiving in this message that the people are not being led to Christ they're being led to Ministries they're being led to personalities they're being led to Traditions being led to the law legalism right here not being set free Hallelujah and get a true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and what she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits working in within the framework of the Christian messes Church oh my I don't like this kind of preaching brother Tim go but I'm G to preach it anyway thank you Lord amen by the spirit of God Discerning which stand in that Antichrist Spirit then Satan will be bers before her that's what God is doing that's what God is raising up in this hour a people with a revelation that is certain of God because they have seek Him amen they have knocked they have pursued him amen they're perseverant they're desperate in this hour oh brother Brandon says oh I'm not I'm not desperate anymore I've been in the message 30 something years I know all the quotes and all this and that brother Bram said once that token message open to me Hallelujah he says I got desperate Hallelujah you get a glimpse of God just like Moses did with the pillar of fire you get

overcoming in this message in this hour hallelujah amen glory to God hallelujah just repeat I'm just going over to see what I want to say here skipping over a lot of things for the next message people say in this message just say what the prophet said repeat what he says and like we always said there's a bunch of parrots the best parrots you want to buy a good parrot they're right here in the message they can repeat everything that the prophet said that's not what he said that's not what he meant didn't mean to say for you to repeat everything how do you find your place and your position how do you come into your own when you just repeat if if the if if the son always repeats what the father's doing how does he find his his own identity he can't find it that's not what he meant just like when he spoke and Jesus said baptize in the name of the Father the Son of the Holy Ghost if they repeated what Jesus said the apostles would have baptized in the name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost but acts 238 they came out and baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ why they knew what he meant they knew his name they knew who he was do we understand if we know what he meant we know who he was and who this is then we speak the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah glory to God Queen of Sheba as long as a human being search and hungers and thirsts the calling for the power of God there's got to be a power somewhere to respond to that power before there be can become a creation there has to be a creator to create that a man longs to see God there's got to be a god somewhere
