This is this is wonderful. I I just got to say how um blessed we are here at Good Neighbor Ministries to be able to host this wonderful event for such wonderful young people that that are interested in the Lord. You know, you've seen your parents, you've seen us rejoicing around the word of God. You wonder at times, how is it that there they can be so zealous for the Lord? Well, let me tell you, you're going to know better as as the days go on, you're going to recognize, you're going to know that this God that we serve, he's not a distant God. He's a present God. He's somebody that's mindful, that loves you, that wants to bless you, that wants to uh give you young people a future that you can be young, you can be beautiful, you can have a family, you can have uh wonderful relationships, you can you can live a healthy life, you can live a a a drugfree life. Amen. You can leave you can live a an a a substance abusefree life in a world where it's just raging out there. So be grateful tonight that you are here in this presence in this anointing in this wonderful atmosphere with so much talent. These young people, they got such beautiful talent. They're they're giving their talents unto the Lord. the singing tonight, angelics, uh, voices, you know, young men that that can be courageous to come up here and sing. Let me tell you, that takes courage in this generation. That takes courage. And I can say we're proud of our young people. Amen. [Applause] Our theme this weekend has been preserving the truth in our youth. I believe that the Lord um has a people in every generation and the way that we as the the the the carriers of the word, we we're the ones that hand off the baton to the next generation. And that's the Lord preserving his word. He says that, you know, in in Psalms 121 verse um 8, I believe it is, that that he says that that the Lord shall preserve thy going out, thy coming in from this time forth and even forever more. In other words, he knew that you would be here. He knew that you might go out and he knew that you would be coming in. And he said, "I'm going to preserve my word in you and I'm going to bring it into manifestation at the right time." Amen. Praise God. We've got we've got somebody here this evening, our brother Kyrie Diggs, who has been anointed of the Lord. Amen. To bring the word of God as an evangelist. Amen. He's got Listen, his last name ain't Diggs for a reason. It's there's a reason cuz the Holy Spirit can dig things out of your life. Last night, he was digging out things that were in your heart. &gt;&gt; He was checking the condition of your heart. Amen. And tonight, I believe he's going to go a little deeper. He's going to bring you into that relationship with him. Amen. And a greater understanding so that you as a young person can understand this is just not just another meeting. This is an appointment with the Lord himself. &gt;&gt; This is the five-fold ministry in blossom. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, you can listen to the tapes, but tonight you can listen to the mighty angel's voice himself speak to you direct into the needs that you have in this day and in this hour. Amen. So, it's with great pleasure that I introduce to you our brother Kyrie Digs all the way from Columbia, South Carolina. God bless you, brother. Bless us. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Ain't God good? Amen. He's worthy of all the praise and I'm just thankful for all of his goodness and all the great things that God has done. Amen. Let's stand to our feet. [Music] Praise the Lord. Let's have a word of prayer. Amen. How many enjoyed the worship? Amen. Oh my. Just think about it. It's going to be a time where there won't be any breaks in between. It's going to be an eternal worship. Amen. We have we ain't going have to switch out the mics. We have to switch out the song leaders. Everybody's going to be a song leader. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not like what we just saw. Some of you was giving by 20%. Some was given 80. Some was given 100. But when we get over there, everybody's going to be the same. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, we just love the Lord. If you have a unspoken request, you can acknowledge the Lord by uplifted hand. Amen. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, Father God, we enter this place on the merits of your mercy and grace. And Lord God, we know that it's nothing that we have done, but it's all your choosing, Lord. You chose us before there was a world, Lord. Lord, and the conditions of life couldn't stop your choosing, Lord. Lord, for you had a picture of us, a image of us, of who we are and who we are to be. And Lord God, we know you're not going to stop until we fulfill that image in your mind. So Lord, help us to yield to the goodness of God, to the grace of God, the mercy of God, because it's by your mercy and grace that we here today. Lord, we pray that you would bless each and every church represented. Lord, bless the host church, Lord, and the pastor, Lord, and all that they put into this meeting, Lord. Lord God, I pray you return it to them hundfold, Lord God. And for those of us who've come expecting, Lord, meet our expectation. Lord, let there be such a release of faith in the building, Lord, that the enemy won't be able to hide, &gt;&gt; but you have to let go and dismiss himself, Lord. Lord, we ask you as always to forgive us for our sins and trespasses, Lord. And just, Father, take us in a place that this flesh, this flesh can't go. In the wonderful name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Let church say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Hey, I just want to uh especially thank uh Good Neighbor because um without them and the inspiration behind what they're trying to do with the young people and uh we wouldn't be here tonight. So, let's give them a hand clap of praise. Amen. There are a lot of people behind the scenes doing things that I was I was telling brother Danny I said you know he he was saying thank God for different ones behind the scenes and different things but every time we get to do something is already done so we don't know who doing what &gt;&gt; you know so we just appreciate you. Amen. You know uh I just love to see that. Amen. You know, if you have your Bibles, let's um turn to uh Ecclesiastic. Ecclesiastic the third chapter. Amen. Ecclesiastes chapter 3. Amen. Praise the Lord. If you have it, say amen. &gt;&gt; We shouldn't have a problem saying amen after brother Miguel this morning. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the Lord. Ecclesiastes 3:1 the Bible says to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven. A time to be born and a time to die. A time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted. Amen. John chapter 12. Praise the Lord. John 12. And just to make the reading short, uh, verse 24, verily, verily, I say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. &gt;&gt; Amen. And may the Lord bless his word. You can have your seats. &gt;&gt; Amen. Tonight, by the grace of God, I I need your help. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But most of all, we want we want the Lord to take over this service. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. But tonight, my subject is uh it's a season for change. &gt;&gt; It's a season for change. You know, but as we look at the word of God, look here. The Bible says the verse we just read, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die." That's the first thing we got to do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The seed, the life that God put within us. Amen. To get that back, we have to die. &gt;&gt; Because we were all born with a sinful nature. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you young people something. Amen. Nobody in this building is better than anybody. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We all had to come through the stages of death. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We all had to experience, Amen. a repentance. Hallelujah. We all had to experience, Amen. You know, realizing that we're wrong. realizing that our current nature that we were born with doesn't match up with God. &gt;&gt; So what did that cause us to do? That causes us to repent. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And die to our ways. Hallelujah. That's the only way we're going to get close to God. &gt;&gt; But Hallelujah. What what are you saying, Brother Diggs? Acknowledge your sins. &gt;&gt; Don't play games with it. Hallelujah. Don't say, "Well, I I ain't really bothering nobody." You make the devil strong when you think like that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, I'm not one who who who likes to play games with spirits. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But church, uh uh when you think about it, he says, uh except that goes into the ground and the first thing it has to do is die. &gt;&gt; It abideth alone. But if it dies, hallelujah, &gt;&gt; it's not only going to bring forth fruit, &gt;&gt; it'll bring forth much fruit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But what good is a seed if it don't die? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is nothing to anybody. Amen. Now, I got something for you tonight. &gt;&gt; Can you see that? &gt;&gt; What is that? &gt;&gt; That's a seed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And everybody in here tonight &gt;&gt; is a seed. Hallelujah. See, one thing about this seed, I can't put it in a good atmosphere and say, "Come forth." &gt;&gt; I can't just take that seed and put put it on the pull pit. I wonder if you wonder how many of you know what kind of seed this is. Hallelujah. You because you've got experience with this kind of seed, you can look at it and say, "That might be a peach seed." But you will never know where stood until it starts to come forward. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you something. It ain't just going to come forward in a good atmosphere. It has to find the right conditions. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But the only way I can get anything out of the sea, it must first be buried. &gt;&gt; I'm going leave it right there. Hallelujah. You say, "Well, oh, Brother Diggs, I'm a good person." No, you have to experience dirt. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Everybody in this room had to experience dirt. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Wrong. Sin, hallelujah. And it's by the dirt, hallelujah, of our lives, hallelujah, that's the first stage where life begins to come forward. Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't be ashamed that you got problems or you got habits or you got situations. Those things God put it there so you can recognize that are greater than Solomon is here tonight. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. First stage, amen, is death. &gt;&gt; And without death there be no life. We thank God for the resurrection, &gt;&gt; but there'd be no resurrection if there was no crucifixion. &gt;&gt; So Christ came and he had to die. Hallelujah. To break the chain of the enemy. &gt;&gt; So it was by his death, hallelujah, that we are set free. And if you die tonight, guarantee you'll be set free. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, we had church last night. &gt;&gt; We had church this morning. &gt;&gt; So, if we don't have church tonight, it's because you bring another spirit here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But church, as we look at the first stages of death, you know, we hear about death and we be like, "Oh, I'm so afraid to die." No, don't be afraid of it. &gt;&gt; Welcome that change. &gt;&gt; We're in a season. Hallelujah. It's a season for change. Even right now, we're getting close to what? Fall. What happens in fall? The the the the sap in the tree. It begins to go down in the root. Why? To preserve life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The tree goes through a stage where it looks like it's dead, but it's really preserving life. &gt;&gt; So church, when you die to yourself, hallelujah, you're not Hallelujah. You're not in a bad place, but what are you doing? You're bringing forth something for another season. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But you look at it, church, when you think about death, let's go to um Psalms 119. No. Psalms 116. Praise the Lord. Look at it. Ain't nothing still came forth yet. And the Holy Spirit is here. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is moving. &gt;&gt; But I still ain't got nothing out of the seat. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Looking nice and pretty, sitting in church or or or acknowledging that God sent the message ain't good enough. Hallelujah. Knowing knowing the name of his dog or his horse ain't good enough. &gt;&gt; Being to experience the relics and and going out to the den and all these things ain't good enough. You have to die. &gt;&gt; That's our ways. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But how does God look at death? Psalms 116 verse1 15 if you got it say amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says precious is the sight of the precious in the sight of the Lord is the what? Death of his saints. When God look at you, hallelujah, repenting, asking him for forgiveness, God says, "Oh yes, my child." &gt;&gt; God says, "Yes, I love it. I can't wait to bless you." Hallelujah. Because you acknowledge that there is a higher power. &gt;&gt; It's a beauty of death. &gt;&gt; It's a It's a glorious thing. When you allow God to take over this flesh, &gt;&gt; we all had to come to a place where we die. But we look at it, God said it's a precious, it's a beautiful thing. First thing about that seed, it must experience dark conditions. &gt;&gt; That's pretty much all of us. &gt;&gt; All of us are born in sin. for the parents in here. For you young people, none of you none of your mas and daddies had to teach you how to lie. &gt;&gt; It was already in you. You were born with it. Hallelujah. It was what is it? It's the surrounding of the seed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What we call flesh. Amen. You say you go in there and steal the cookies and then mom and dad will come say did you two years old come and ask you did you take those cookies? No ma'am. &gt;&gt; What caused you to look your mom straight in her face and lie to her? &gt;&gt; It's the nature you were born with. &gt;&gt; Oh my. It's the nature we all were born with. So God wants us to get rid of that sinful nature. &gt;&gt; And the only way you can get rid of it is to die. &gt;&gt; But church, I want you to understand something. You and I, every every one of us, your seed has to meet corruption. &gt;&gt; The seed has to meet an atmosphere of corruption &gt;&gt; before it can bring forth life. You might say, "Brother D, I'm a good at two shoes. I ain't never did nothing." You still a wicked seller. &gt;&gt; Just for having that thought is wicked. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But you look church, they have to take this seed, pack it in the ground, &gt;&gt; put it in a condition &gt;&gt; where it has to hallelujah be succumbed by it surroundings. Everything is dark. Hallelujah. Look like there's no life. The dirt smothers the sea. &gt;&gt; Oh my. We going somewhere now. &gt;&gt; And some of you right now may be smothered by your habits. &gt;&gt; Some of you may be smothered by your wrongs. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But it's all right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is not the real seed. But it's the dirt, hallelujah, that allows the seed to unlock. Hallelujah. And as the seed is in the ground compact around all darkness, the longer it sit there, it dries out the shell. &gt;&gt; Well, like we you see some of the mas and daddies, what happened to us? Hallelujah. We were so surrounded by dirt to one day we said, "I'm tired of living like this. I'm tired of being in this darkness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And as the seed, hallelujah, gets so compact with darkness, everything dries out and then it starts to break away from the shell. &gt;&gt; I wonder if somebody breaking away tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you tired of the life you're living? Are you tired of doing the things that you've done and you say, "Man, I got to get loose." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And as that seed begins to break forward, why it starts to The second thing, Hallelujah. Let me just say it like this. I want to read you something the prophet of God said. He said, "It makes a difference when you come sincerely to God." &gt;&gt; Look, hallelujah. You have to die for you only live by dead substance. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm here tonight because somebody else died. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Somebody else died to their ways and they began to live a Christian life and I saw that Christian life and that Christian life pulled me in. It made me want to repent. It made me tired of how I was living. And it's because they died I'm alive. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church, don't take it for granted. Just coming to church and singing good songs. Somebody had to die at this church may be like this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Look, we live by dead substance. &gt;&gt; Wasn't the fellowship good this evening? &gt;&gt; We ate some good old Italian sausage. &gt;&gt; The pig had to die. Well, we out there. &gt;&gt; I told brother Danny I said and that Italian sergeant was busting. Hallelujah. But the pig had to die so I can receive strength. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we ate some hamburgers. &gt;&gt; The cow had to die. And we had to eating the cow. We ain't even thinking about what the cow went through. All we can say is, "Man, move. This cow good. Give me some m put some tomatoes on it. Put some pickles on it. Let's dress it up." Why? You're eating the cow because you want to live. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to think about all the people, young people in your life that sacrificed so you could be here. Think about how much mom and daddy sacrificed &gt;&gt; so you can live. &gt;&gt; What always gets me with young people, hallelujah, you know, when when they're young, mom and daddy hold their hand across the street and the kids go willfully look up at you and smile cuz you feel like they're your protector. Buses come and they snatch you back and you don't know, you don't even know the trouble. You just looking, &gt;&gt; kicking your leg. Next thing when it's time to walk because they're your protector, you trust that and go &gt;&gt; and walk. When does that change? &gt;&gt; It changes. Hallelujah. When you start thinking for yourself &gt;&gt; and you start Hallelujah. for some for some reason. Hallelujah. When you get old or become a teenager, you start to think that mom and daddy is no longer protecting you from the bus crossing the street. Hallelujah. Or protecting you from some kind of bad substance. No, that love is still there. But because you want to live your own life, you resist that love when it's always been there. They've given it. I remember one time I was doing something wrong and I began to think, hallelujah, how will my mama feel if I get caught up doing us? You ever thought about that? You ever thought about how mama and daddy would feel? Hallelujah. If you get caught up in some nonsense, most of the time we don't because we're thinking about ourself. You ain't dead yet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Somebody will always be affected by your actions. Somebody will always be affected by your life cuz somebody's watching your life. Even right here to now, right now in this service, your friends are watching you how you respond to the word. My listen and he say friends, not a sign card. Something died that you could live forever more. What? Jesus Christ. Jesus died. Hallelujah. So we could be here in 2025. Hallelujah. Celebrating the resurrection. &gt;&gt; But how many of us take it personal? Hallelujah. You know, and as that seed dies, it breaks away from the shell and then the real life within starts to come out. &gt;&gt; Don't get nervous. I ain't going to be long. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's in atmospheres like this where the real you will come out. &gt;&gt; I want you to think about two brothers for a second. Cain and Abel. &gt;&gt; We know the story. But one thing I want you to understand about Cain and Abel, they grew up in a Christian house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They grew up in a house where all was talked about was the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Adam, hallelujah, the Satan. He had no hold over Adam. &gt;&gt; The Bible says Adam gave up his life &gt;&gt; just like who? Christ. &gt;&gt; Adam was willing to die to save his wife. Hallelujah. See, so he was ready to die so that his wife could live because God said as soon as you take taste of it, you will die. I wonder how many of us are ready to die for the cause. &gt;&gt; The cause of Christ. &gt;&gt; But I want you to look at these boys for a second. All they heard every day. Think about it. Son, me and mom, we will be in the presence of God. and God would come down &gt;&gt; and we would fellowship in the cool of the day. &gt;&gt; It was such a glorious time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was no mystery. We didn't hear two voices. It wasn't one soul. It wasn't a thunder. It was God himself. &gt;&gt; And he would come down and we we would have fellowship. Hallelujah. And I wasn't hallelujah distracted by his voice. Hallelujah. I knew exactly how he sound. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. He wasn't Adam wasn't giving a testimony to those boys of what somebody else said. &gt;&gt; He was telling them what he experienced. Hallelujah. He was telling what him and his mama experience. Hallelujah. On the daily. Can you imagine? Hallelujah. Seeing God every day. And then because of your choices, because of your choice, it takes you right out of that atmosphere. &gt;&gt; This atmosphere here tonight can go with you everywhere you go. &gt;&gt; The only thing will stop it is your choices. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But look this day, Adam, Eve, Cain and Abel are going to church. Every day they heard about the goodness of God. Every day you imagine, can you imagine Adam talking to his boys and he say, "Son, hallelujah. I would walk down in the Sahara in the safari and look at the lion and say, Kitty, come here. And if that big old line was &gt;&gt; and it will come right up to his master, &gt;&gt; it will come right up to him. Hallelujah. And there was no fear. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Adam had no fear. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When he had a life without sin, &gt;&gt; you imagine he controlling everything. Hallelujah. He'd walk up to the tree and grab an apple off the tree and another one would pop back on it just like that. That was the atmosphere he lived in. Hallelujah. Amen. You talking about prosperity, Adam was the king of it. &gt;&gt; And he would hallelujah tell his boys about that life. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'd speak to creation and it would obey." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is what Hallelujah Bible study was like in Adam's house. And you know what? It's the same in your house. &gt;&gt; We talk about the same God Adam talk told Adam told Cain and Abel about. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But what happens is we reason with it. Amen. But look, he's telling those boys about God and his relationship and how mom and daddy saw God every day till sin came in and took away that. Sin took away that relationship. Hallelujah. Sin took away God coming down every day having fellowship. But what I want you to understand, it wasn't on God's end. God remained faithful. &gt;&gt; Even when they were caught in sin, God still came down and call their name. &gt;&gt; And God is calling your name tonight. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How's he calling you? By his word. It's not an identity of Cadre or Danny or Nelson or Miguel. It's an identity of seed inside. &gt;&gt; And if the word hallelujah is doing something to you, hallelujah, connecting, that's God calling your name. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; God called Adam, Adam, where art thou? &gt;&gt; Even after they committed sin, So I don't want to hear your excuses tonight. &gt;&gt; Brother D, I got this problem. &gt;&gt; I got that problem. &gt;&gt; Adam, Adam, &gt;&gt; the ones who started it all. &gt;&gt; After they sinned, God still was faithful. &gt;&gt; So you can't give me tonight, brother D, but my problem is different. Adam, Adam. Where are thou? &gt;&gt; And God didn't stop until he was face to face with Adam again. &gt;&gt; And he won't stop until he's face to face with you again. &gt;&gt; If you belong to him, he'll keep calling your name &gt;&gt; and he won't stop. But then you think about it, church. These boys, they grew up in a good house, a good atmosphere. Hallelujah. But then there was going to come a day where everything they heard had to be tested. &gt;&gt; Everything they heard, hallelujah, was either going to live or die. &gt;&gt; You can only produce what's in your seed. &gt;&gt; Now, this is a peach seed. The only way I can get apples out of this is if God does something supernatural. &gt;&gt; And that's what I love about God. People looked at me and said, "He ain't going to never be nothing. They ain't know what was in my seed." &gt;&gt; So don't judge it by the outside. God can do something supernatural. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And even for the parents, sometimes we look at our kids and we don't believe what's in the inside. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Look, now they get to a place where it's time to worship. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? They get to a place where it's time to worship. And he says, "Okay, now I didn't talk y'all about God. I done told y'all about God all y'all life. Now it's time for y'all to show what you believe." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What if God tonight would ask you to show me what you think about me? I preached a message one time called Now what? Now what? In the same book of Ecclesiastics. Amen. I'm following your pull tonight. &gt;&gt; And God is hitting these areas cuz some of you want to drift on me, but we going to pull you back in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Listen. Hallelujah. I preached a message called Down What? One time. Amen. The same book. Hallelujah. Solomon. Solomon said he's going to give his heart to experience everything he desired. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to understand he wasn't tricked. &gt;&gt; Everything he did was what he desired. &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible says he had men servants. &gt;&gt; Solomon knew what it was like to have a butler. Hallelujah. Solomon had maids. The Bible says Solomon had dancers. Solomon had a Beyonce before there was a Beyonce. &gt;&gt; Solomon had a Chris Brown before there was ever a Breezy. I know where you at. Hallelujah. But church, hallelujah. Solomon said he's going to build himself houses. The biggest houses you see out on uh uh Lake Ontario doesn't even compare to the palace Solomon's living in. &gt;&gt; Solomon had vineyards. You talking about organic &gt;&gt; stuff we would kill for right now. Real stuff. Solomon had herds, real beef, not just soybean stuff. &gt;&gt; Everything you could think about. The Bible says, and this is for some of you, Solomon had gold and diamonds. &gt;&gt; You know, the first thing somebody do is when they struggling, they go put on a little fake chain. thing ain't even real. &gt;&gt; First thing you want to do is put a little chain around your neck. Especially boys looking like a little &gt;&gt; Walking around with a little chain on your neck. Hallelujah. What the sister want to do? Put a little ring on. &gt;&gt; Then they go too far. Want to put something on the ankle. So what &gt;&gt; you know in some cultures that anchor bracelet represent prostitution. &gt;&gt; And if you have hunger to do these things, amen, you ain't dead yet. &gt;&gt; You go put your little chain on. H. The Bible says don't wear graven images. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But we ought to ask ourselves, do we want to be a Christian or not? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Don't fake it out. If you really going to be one, be one. Hallelujah. And I can say this cuz look, I had gold changed this big. &gt;&gt; I don't tell this stuff all the time cuz some of y'all I hear it and bring a uncertain sound. Well, brother D. God can deliver me, too. God deliver him. He can deliver me, too. He say he had ropes. He say he had her bones. If he God dealt him when his time came, he can do the same for me. You might be the one who neck get infected. &gt;&gt; But the bigger issue was it wasn't the gold chains. It wasn't a h a the the ankle braces or the rings. I wore that stuff for image. Amen. &gt;&gt; How people looked at me when I had it on. &gt;&gt; Let me say this right now. Hallelujah. And look, you do whatever God tell you to do. &gt;&gt; I ain't telling you go home and take it off cuz you be taking it off for me. &gt;&gt; Do what God tell you to do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I'll say it just like this. Hallelujah. Before I died, I came to church as I was. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what I love about my pastor. He accepted me how I was. Hallelujah. Came to church with my Jordans on, with my gold on, all that stuff. He said, "Boy, come on in his word." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See, you got to be in the right atmosphere. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We need to welcome them in. Amen. Come on in here. You know how they say, you know, they got false scriptures. Now, the Bible say, "Come as thou are." That ain't even in the Bible. Really? &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Just like Eve eating an apple ain't even in the Bible. &gt;&gt; That's things made up by men. Bible say she ate a fruit. People say all the time, well, you know, in my church, you know, we uh we come as we, you know, the Bible say come as you are. The Bible don't say that. &gt;&gt; But you're welcome to do that. &gt;&gt; Come as you are. But the real interpretation of that, come as you are, but don't remain the same. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yeah. We want you to come as you are. Come with all your problems. Come with all your issues. But don't look to remain in that condition. If you want God, if you want God, be prepared to die. &gt;&gt; Be prepared to give up something. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Church, friend of mine, we was at work one time. Hey, y'all know I'm a storyteller. We was at work one time and he he was a nominational Christian. He said he said, "Hey Dre," he said, "Man, I like rap gospel." He said, "Man, it just, you know, I just like the beats." And you know, I pulled up beside somebody and I was just praising God and you know, I had my speakers in the back and it was that thing was thumping. He said, "Lady pulled up beside me and she was like, he said, I wish she could have hear what I was listening to. She did hear it. If you hear that, that ain't going to make you want to say, &gt;&gt; you ain't dead yet. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I used to have a baby made me want to get loose. Baby want &gt;&gt; Let me let me give you a little insight. I do these things so that you could see I enjoy God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I enjoy church. &gt;&gt; I enjoy the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost. I enjoy when we all come together. I enjoy when we worship. I enjoy seeing you smile. &gt;&gt; That's the problem. Hallelujah. We've come to church and presented church as some old dad tradition. But God is alive. We are happy. We're excited about God. We love the Lord. I gave up my life for this. And I enjoy it. You ain't going to make me be a bubble along. I'm going to dance. I'm going to worship because God's been good to me. God's been good to us. And we sit back in church like a bunch of mannequins. &gt;&gt; Anybody woke up this morning? &gt;&gt; I said, did anybody woke up this morning? &gt;&gt; Who did that for you? &gt;&gt; Who did that for you? &gt;&gt; So, you ought to be able to give him some praise. And what you going through shouldn't be able to stop you from giving God praise. Where you come from, your background, none of that didn't stop God from waking you up. &gt;&gt; So none of that should stop you from giving God praise. [Applause] We've hammered conduct and order so much &gt;&gt; people get rebuke because they smile. &gt;&gt; Ain't no smiling. You You laugh too much. This is serious. &gt;&gt; Y'all know Jesus had a sense of humor. &gt;&gt; I give you a scripture. &gt;&gt; Jesus talking about Harry. He said, "Go tell that old fox." Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Jesus called a man a fox. Call him out his name. Oh. Oh my. But what we do, we want to make everything fit &gt;&gt; to our liking. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. You ain't going to do that to me. [Music] &gt;&gt; You ain't going to give me some old dead cold church service. Hallelujah. I come to worship. Hallelujah. I come to give God praise. And if I want to give a high five, I'mma give a high five. Hallelujah. Because God has been good to me. Hallelujah. And if I want to give God some praise, that's what I'm going to do. Amen. And if I want to do it with my brothers, they going to do it with me. Hallelujah. Because we are glad about Jesus. We are glad about the resurrection. If you need Jesus, you've come to the right place cuz you are more believers. We are believers. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Church on that day of Pentecost, they were worshiping. They were excited. They was changed forever. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Bible say they were drunk. &gt;&gt; What happened? They had died, &gt;&gt; died to their religion, died to their ways. They didn't even care how people was looking at them. Peter said, "This is that. This is that. This is that." And I'm saying tonight, this is that. If you want God, this is that you are in the right place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is a fresh anointing. &gt;&gt; Ain't something cold and stale from the 1960s, &gt;&gt; but it's a God that's alive. &gt;&gt; It's a God that can still &gt;&gt; take away sin. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Church. Look, as I think about it, you know, the grace of God and what the Lord has done, you take those two boys, Adam and Eve, all they heard about from their youth was the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Can anybody relate? &gt;&gt; Can anybody relate? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Adam and Eve. Hallelujah. All they could do was talk about God. &gt;&gt; That's the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Talking about God and what God has done. Hallelujah. A prophet came to what? Bring us back to God. Not to himself, not to his church, not to his graveyard, not to his caribou, not to his bear, not to his belt buckle, but back to God. That's where we are tonight. We are in the presence of God. Everything else is dead. Everything else is irrelevant. But God is still alive. God is still delivering. God is still breaking yolks. God is still [Applause] &gt;&gt; I see some of you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That just emotion that they he he getting the people all excited. &gt;&gt; What you want me to do? Get them prepared for a funeral &gt;&gt; or should we celebrate God? &gt;&gt; Should we celebrate God or should we all put on black suits, black dresses and get ready? Hallelujah. [Music] I told my family if I was to leave before y'all, don't nobody come to my funeral in a black suit. &gt;&gt; Cuz my going on is going to be a joyous occasion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the one that I served all this time. I'm going to be in his presence. Hallelujah. So, you ought not to cry for me. You ought to say, "He made it. &gt;&gt; He made it." &gt;&gt; Church, think about those boys. Everybody all right, &gt;&gt; man. This thing still ain't brought forth no life. &gt;&gt; All this Holy Ghost in here and it still ain't brought nothing for It still look the same to y'all too, don't it, &gt;&gt; man? You know the prophet said the closest place to God on earth is where? The pull pit. &gt;&gt; And it still ain't brought nothing. &gt;&gt; I hope you catching me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just coming to church sitting here ain't that ain't it. &gt;&gt; There has to be a death. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Has to be a death. &gt;&gt; Like I say, I'll go back to myself when I came when I first came in early stages where I saw a life. I saw my mom really come into something real. And it was this truth, church. And and and and we started to experience she she she hate me for saying this, but we start to experience grace then wrath. Cuz mama ain't play. &gt;&gt; I'm one of them kids who had to be home before the stop lights come on. Street lights. See y'all know nothing about that. We got right. I you gave I called the I call the government on youm. Our parents will come to school and beat you. Beat the teacher too. She get in the way. for the adults. &gt;&gt; But I used to say I used to say with her I saw her changing right before me. &gt;&gt; What was happening? It was a death where she would just used to go upside our head because we didn't do what she say. Y'all might as well say amen. It's the truth. Y'all know before we got the Holy Ghost, we were some of us were rough. Some of us were quick to fight. Like some of you young people, you get mad real quick. Real quick. Mama told me, "I wish you would in my house." My mama's first name is Sonora, and that Z is for whip. I say, "She ain't watching this, so she can't get me." But what we start to experience, we start to see a life changing. We started to see somebody dying. Hallelujah. But we didn't know what was going on. What was happening? She was getting closer to God. &gt;&gt; Something that her Pentecostal church couldn't do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Church. I never forget cuz we were stopped. I hope everybody all right. &gt;&gt; I never forget one of one of the Miguel. One of the first things I saw I said, "Boy, mama changing." Me and my brother used to have to be home before the stoplight. Come on. Just in case y'all don't know what that mean. That means before the sun go down. &gt;&gt; That's a We in a different day now. Wish you would tell a child. Come on. All my friends out. All my friends. I don't care what your friends doing. You ain't in this house. shooting. Me and my brother was shooting basketball. A man, I wish he just preached the word. I am. &gt;&gt; The word is reality. &gt;&gt; I ain't here to tell you about what God did in Noah. I'm here to tell you about what he did in me. I ain't here to tell you about what God did in a prophet. I'm here to tell you about what he did in me. &gt;&gt; Cuz the same seed in them is the same seed in me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Which is the same God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I ain't taking away from their experience. Amen. We need them. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But anyway, me and my brother was shooting basketball and the sun started to go down. I said, "Well," I said, "Well, we getting lost. Let me let me get out of here. I ain't get nothing tonight. So I started easing my way back home. &gt;&gt; Bro kept playing cuz they were winning. &gt;&gt; He knew full well what the rules was. But you know what? He winning feeling good. So he said, "You know what? I'm going to be disobedient tonight." That's normally how disobedience take place. What is it? It's called pleasure. The whole world is in the condition it's in now because Eve found pleasure. &gt;&gt; And pleasure is the thing. Hallelujah. What the enemy will give you, he'll give you a false conception of pleasure. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. For people who smoke cigarettes, they say one after one. And then you ask them, you say, "Why are you smoking?" It relaxes me. Not even realizing you smoking tar. &gt;&gt; You actually killing yourself. &gt;&gt; Church, you ever thought about Hallelujah. For all of you who've been tried by that and and you got friends who might be smoking a little blunt here and there. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's in here. &gt;&gt; It's in here. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something about me. Hallelujah. If there's something in your life that's not under the blood, we going to talk about it tonight. because it's not covered. &gt;&gt; So God will talk about it and just show it to you so you can ask for forgiveness. &gt;&gt; But some of us are so stubborn. We know God talking to us and we look down at the floor. You keep on rolling. You keep &gt;&gt; you You can see I'm a guy from around the way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But look, pleasure pleasure is the thing that defeats a lot of people, &gt;&gt; especially a lot of young people. Hallelujah. You get caught up in the things that you like. Hallelujah. Some of us are so caught up on the internet. And I wonder how many of you got got a got a subscription. What streamer you are caught up with? I wonder how many of you are just so in love with Cassinet or I show speed. All these different streamers that you look at their life and you like, man, I wish I had that. They wish they had what you got. &gt;&gt; They wish they had God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. They life is in a whirlwind. And when it all start to crumble, you know what they do? They run back to God. But pleasure is the thing that started this whole thing. Hallelujah. And you know, like I was saying, my brother them, they were winning. They were winning. So he kept playing. I think they had him beat everybody. They kept playing. Kept playing. I start making my way to the house. I ain't feel like getting down tonight. So, I'm in the house safely. Light. Come on. Sun down. No, brother. I said, "Boy, this going to be good, boy." I said, "Boy, this your mama go up. This going to be good." Y'all know how we is with our siblings. Shame on you. And not want to see your sibling get church. He finally get home. It's black outside. The moon out. I said, "Boy, this going to be a show. Get your popcorn ready." Mama going to cut loose cuz she didn't did it before. So I know something about to happen. So you know what? I'm kind of watching but really don't want to be seen cuz when that belt get to flying if you in the way you going to get something too. &gt;&gt; You know how it is. You hang with the wrong person they get caught doing something. Hallelujah. You are guilty by association. &gt;&gt; Oh you say brother D, I don't do that. Hallelujah. If you hanging with those kind of people, that spirit in you, too. &gt;&gt; Look, he comes in. Hallelujah. My mama say, "Boy, you know when they call you out your name, you're in trouble." Boy, what you doing come this lady? Said, "Mom, we were winning and we were winning and you know what I'm what I'm going to tell the fellas, man. I got to go cuz I got to be home before the sun come down." She said, "Yeah, you got to be home before the sun come down." He said, "But mom, we were winning and I ain't want to just leave." She said, "Okay, well, next time you play, you win the game, and then you come home. Don't you do this again." I'm sitting over there like, "You ain't going to do nothing. I didn't came home for nothing. She ain't even raise her voice. &gt;&gt; And he look at me like, &gt;&gt; but that was me seeing a season of change. &gt;&gt; That was me seeing that somebody else is dealing with mama. when there used to be wrath because rules are broken. Now she's giving grace. &gt;&gt; And I'm like, what is happening to her? And it didn't stop there. It was over and over different situations where she would once bring the wrath. Now she's talking to us, trying to understand where we're coming from. And we wasn't used to that. We were used to ducking. But when God comes in, &gt;&gt; like brother Miguel was saying and brother Danny was saying, when God comes in, hallelujah, he's not going to play second fiddle. &gt;&gt; He's going to change your nature. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And what God does is he changes your taste. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You start to lose the desire for certain things. What is it? It's the Holy Ghost making room. &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost possessing that body. &gt;&gt; So, he starts to push out things that doesn't agree with his nature. &gt;&gt; He starts to push out things that doesn't agree with his mind. &gt;&gt; But the thing is, when we allow God to take control of the house, &gt;&gt; maybe tonight God is trying to push something out the way &gt;&gt; so he can possess the house. But we'll come when we'll come and say, "Well, I did my good deed. I came to church." But like I said, church, I came. I'm talking about a death. I came to church. Hallelujah. Like they say, as you are, as you were, but as I sat there, the word start to do something to me. Hallelujah. The word start to Hallelujah. invade my privacy. Hallelujah. The word start to invade my thoughts and God start to make himself welcome. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. God started to spread around and before you know it, those gold chains didn't mean anything to me anymore. &gt;&gt; God gave me a simple revelation. I say me. Hallelujah. Again, I ain't trying to tell nobody what to do. It got to be you and God. &gt;&gt; But one day, I looked in the mirror. Hallelujah. I was about to go somewhere and boy I was suited and booted boy. I was suited and booted. Boy, I had it on. I had it on boy. Gucci links. Had on my Gucci rope. Hallelujah. My hair and bone. And I looked in the mirror and God said, "Now, when you step away from this mirror, you ain't gonna see nothing you got on. So everything you got on is for everybody else. You ain't going to see your chains. You ain't going to see your rings, your bracelets. Everything you got on is for your image when people look at you. And the Lord start to deal with me in such a way. Hallelujah. To where I'm not wearing this for me. I'm wearing this for everybody else. So it became real simple. I stopped doing things for everybody else and I started doing for myself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's the change. I wonder even right now if I was to close, have you died yet? All the word that's been preached in this place. Hallelujah. It doesn't have to be Hallelujah. rolling over of chairs and everybody screaming to the top of their lungs. Although I love it, &gt;&gt; I love it. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But when God deals with us, it's a sincere act. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's inviting him in to take over. Church, what happens after death? after the seed dies and the Bible says rocks. She is no good. She hadn't rotten yet. The seed ain't rotten. It was just peeled away from the fruit. Hallelujah. But when it's rotten, it starts to decompose. It starts to be unrecognizable. It starts to meet corruption. Hallelujah. It has to get to a place, hallelujah. Where its life is not its life. The quickening power within begins to take over and bring it back to life again. &gt;&gt; When you die, God takes over that you may live. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then this seed, hallelujah, &gt;&gt; which is planted in the ground, what begins to activate the process? The warmth of the sun. &gt;&gt; The seed can be buried under four feet of concrete. That's right. &gt;&gt; And once the sun starts to warm up that concrete, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, there's something inside of that seed &gt;&gt; that connects with the su. &gt;&gt; Even concrete can't stop that connection. &gt;&gt; Pornography can't stop that connection. &gt;&gt; The internet can't stop that connection. Substance abuse can't stop that connection. molestation can't stop that connection. If you ever get in the presence of the sun, you will come forth. And I want to tell you, the sun is shining right now. The warmth of the Holy Ghost is in the room right now, &gt;&gt; and he's trying to pull you out of the concrete. church. That's what happened to us. We came to church in that condition after we died, repented. Hallelujah. You know what? We might need to fill this pool up cuz I've been feeling back there that somebody need to give their life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You've been coming to church too many times. Now is the time to give your life. &gt;&gt; Now is the time to mean business with God. You know, brother Miguel, I've been saying to myself, what good is an annual meeting every year if nobody repents? &gt;&gt; What good is an annual meeting if the young people don't enter into a change? &gt;&gt; I know some of you came for the food. and good neighbor. Y'all outdid yel, boy. Y'all y'all put a ice cream par out there this time. See, whatever. Happy. But what good is all that if you leave out of here with the same spirits in your life when the sun is shining? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look, even brother Miguel said it. Hallelujah. We'll spend time, young sisters. We'll spend time reading romance novels. How you want your relationship to go. &gt;&gt; Sister told me one time she was reading a romance novel and as she was reading it, God broke her into another realm cuz she was a Christian. Hallelujah. broke into another room and showed her a mirror while she's reading the novel. Showed her evil spirits standing behind her, caressing her hair. Showing her that as you're reading this novel, you're really entertaining evil spirits. &gt;&gt; I wonder how many of us in this room got things in our life that we're entertaining. where the basis of it is an evil spirit. &gt;&gt; Y'all see where we at now? Now we're moving into demonology where God is trying to set somebody free. &gt;&gt; You've been holding on to that thing so long and God's trying to set you free. There's enough power in here to cast out any demon, &gt;&gt; to cast out any devil, &gt;&gt; but you got to want to go free. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've seen young people in church possessed by demon demon spirits. Hallelujah. One young girl, as soon as the spirit started moving, her eyes rolled back in her head. Pastor told me, he said, "Hey, go pray for us something some something." I was at another church. He said, "Go pray for us something." She out of breath. And I walked up to her, she was go. Her eyes rolled back in her head. It was a spirit that didn't want her to go free. And I walked up to that devil and said, "Hey, you got to go. &gt;&gt; You got to get out of here. &gt;&gt; Leave her body right now. And every bornag again holy ghost fil person in this room got power over demons. &gt;&gt; Don't you think you got to live that way? &gt;&gt; The main thing that gets us is fear. &gt;&gt; The imaginations of fear. We paint out these scenarios of things that hadn't even happened. If I get saved, my boyfriend gonna leave me. Let him go. &gt;&gt; Let him go. I guarantee you there's a Christian man that'll treat you a whole lot better. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Vice versa. Amen. Let her go. If she not willing to serve God, let her go. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But church, when you look at all of these things, you get to the place to where, man, this thing still ain't brought forth life. How many believe God is here? &gt;&gt; And this thing still ain't came forth. The only way it's going to come forth, it has to experience dirt, water, sunlight. All of us have experienced dirt. And right now, God is giving you the water. But are you going to bathe in the sunlight? Are you going to spend time with God? Hallelujah. Don't get nervous. I ain't going to be too much longer. But church, once that seed once the seed starts to feel the presence of the sun, there's something in it that cannot stay away. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it's rice. You ever heard a farmer say, "Man, the sun came it, spring came a little too fast and then it got cold." Because when spring came, hallelujah, the rays of the sun projected a certain way on that crop and it just started coming forth. It can't be stopped. &gt;&gt; The process, that connection can't be stopped. And I want to say to you, if God has a seed in you, and if he ever starts dealing with you, the devil can't stop that. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brad, I'm not ready." It ain't going to stop. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I ain't ready to give my life." It ain't going to stop. He going to keep coming and coming until you surrender &gt;&gt; because you belong to him. &gt;&gt; Joy. I look around while I'm preaching and some of y'all look like this the most angriest time of your life. Are you happy about what God is doing in your life? &gt;&gt; And if you're not happy, it's because you haven't met that connection yet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let me wind this down. Okay. Death. &gt;&gt; Y'all know what that mean, right? &gt;&gt; I've been preaching for one hour. Hallelujah. We spend longer than that on the internet. We longer than that on IG, Tik Tok, captivated by the stories and we get in God's presence. We got a time limit. How are you ever going to make it in eternity if you have a time limit? &gt;&gt; Church, let me say it like this. After you come through those stages, like I said, don't get nervous. I'm about to close. Hallelujah. Because I know some of y'all thinking we got refreshments after those church after you come through those stages. First stage death, second stage, hallelujah, is where the life starts to come forth. &gt;&gt; What is it? It's the word in you seeing the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's the connections of life starting to connect. It ain't what you doing, it's the grace of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God allowing you to be in an atmosphere where the word can connect with your seed. And as that word connect with your seed, life starts to come forth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But God ain't done yet. There's still more. Amen. What happens when you start to grow? You're not finished. until you start producing fruit. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Bible says, "You shall know them by their fruit." &gt;&gt; Amen. And you are no good to me until you stop producing fruit. &gt;&gt; The Bible say he gave one five talents. He gave another two talents and he gave one one talent and he gave all of them the talents according to the ability he knew that was in them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If God gave you something is because he knew he knew you could produce fruit with it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look, the five brought forth five. The two brought forth two. But the one who said, "I ain't ready yet. I ain't ready yet. I I'mma mess it up. I'm afraid. So I'm I'mma just bury it." God said, "You wicked and unprofitable servant." And I want you to catch the scripture. He said, "Why didn't you take what I gave you to the exchanges and bring me interest?" &gt;&gt; The Bible says he's the vine and we are the branches. Young people, you owe us something. You owe me something. Hallelujah. And until you give it to me, you're in debt. &gt;&gt; There's something God put inside y'all &gt;&gt; that belongs to me. &gt;&gt; There's something God put inside y'all that belongs to us. And until you give it to us, you're in debt. Hallelujah. There's something God put inside of everybody's seed. &gt;&gt; And until you give it to us, you owe us. &gt;&gt; But the thing of it is is people are satisfied burying what God put inside of them. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm the vine. Ye are the branches." What does a branch do? A branch bears fruit of the life of the vine. &gt;&gt; I'm gonna make it real personal, young people. Hallelujah. What's supposed to happen is you're supposed to be God's hands. &gt;&gt; You're supposed to be God's feet. &gt;&gt; You're supposed to be the attributes of God. &gt;&gt; And until you start to give me that, you are in debt. H. You owe us. Hallelujah. Amen. God put something in you that should produce the same life that went in the ground. &gt;&gt; And until I see God just coming to the youth meeting ain't good enough. &gt;&gt; It's time to bring forth life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, before I close, this is the question. What stage are you in? Because everybody may not be in the same stage. Some of you may be in a stage where you need to die, but that don't mean the person a little further ahead better than you. No, it's just another stage. Some of you may be in a stage where you didn't you didn't acknowledge that you're a sinner and you've you've repented and gave your life to God, but you sitting in church dead. There's another stage. There's another season. Hallelujah. Amen. Like I said about Solomon, Solomon experienced everything. And then he said all the music. He say he had music. Amen. Solomon was Solomon had his Taylor Swifts, his Cardi B's, his megs, he had every He had his Glor. It's amazing to me, Brother Danny, that our young people think that they can come to church, experience all this worldly stuff, and God not to talk about it. God is real &gt;&gt; and he's mindful of the life that you have &gt;&gt; and he talks about these things because he wants to set you free. Hallelujah. But the thing of it is is do you want to go free? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Or do you want to say, "Well, I went to church. It was good. It was a good atmosphere." What about God breaking the chains? No, the chains ain't good enough. What about God breaking the shackles? &gt;&gt; Because the chains can be broke, but if you still got shackles on them, hook them chains right back up again. &gt;&gt; And some of us experience a powerful anointing and we thank God and walk out free, but we still got shackles on us. And as soon as we go back home, those demons jump right back on us again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I was in a church one time and this lady was hearing the word and all of a sudden she just started to getting frantic and say, "I got to go. I got to go." She got up and leave. Be careful. Those of you be hearing the word and you, man, I got I'm got I'm going to get me some water. I'm I'm going I got to use the bathroom. All these different things. Sometimes it be spirits that don't want to come out because they hear the word and they hear the word talking directly to them. Hallelujah. Sometimes, hallelujah, people don't come to church because God is so direct. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God is not picking on anybody. Hallelujah. Let me say it like this. If you've heard me talk about anything in your life, what is it? It's God's love. [Applause] This young lady, she walked outside. Her car was blocked, so she couldn't leave. So, she had to come back in. The brother was still preaching. She was getting frantic and she went in the back and the spirit took over. She started throwing chairs in the back of the church. Now, if you would to ask her that morning when she woke up if she thought she was going to ever go to church and start throwing chairs, she would have said no. But she had babysitted that spirit so long till it got to a place to it embarrassed her and she started throwing chairs and doing all this stuff. And uh they come and running and get the brothers. She throwing chairs. The spirit the spirit. I walked back there, me and some brothers. I looked in her face, say, "Put that chair down." &gt;&gt; You know what she did? She put the chair down. Cuz that spirit recognized another spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when you get another spirit in you, all of your habits will recognize that there's something else taking place. &gt;&gt; When you get God in you, hallelujah, it won't be so easy to do certain things anymore because the devil will recognize that there's something else living inside of you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You young people hear us talk about God and the Holy Ghost is something real. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's something real. I can go on and on. I was in South Africa. Hallelujah. And a young man, look at where we're going now. The Holy Spirit start to move like it's moving right now. Dealing with hearts. Hallelujah. Remember I said last night, the devil doesn't know what's in your heart. All he can do is hear and study you. &gt;&gt; So what he'll try to do is block the word &gt;&gt; because it's the word that sets you free. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And look church. Hallelujah. This this this this young lady. Hallelujah. She started the spirit started moving and coming out and screaming and I mean this young this young fell he started screaming and doing all these things right in the middle of a youth meeting. The power of God start to move him. I realized something. If God is in us the devil has to fall subject. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So he started screaming and hollering and all these things. I walked up to him when nobody else could hear me. And I said, "Hush." He said, &gt;&gt; he had to hush cuz I told him to. Didn't Jesus do that in the Bible? &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Be quiet. Come out of them." So me just being foolish enough to do what Jesus did &gt;&gt; if he and me is the same God. It's the same spirit, it's the same controller of demons. So it'll do the same thing today. So I walked up to him. I said, "Hush." He said, I said, "Come out quietly. Be quiet." He said, and the spirit came out just like that. What are you saying, brother D? Come, musicians, come. Why do we end up on that? Cuz I'm challenging spirits. And I want every spirit in here that's not of God to know that we are stronger than you. Hey, &gt;&gt; there's more of us than it is of you. &gt;&gt; There's more Holy Ghost anointing in here than demon powers. So, I'll say to Satan and his imps, you have to let go. But it takes a willing heart. It takes somebody who's tired of living the way they living, man. This thing still ain't came for. What is it going to take? It has to be buried. There's a season to die. &gt;&gt; There's a season for birth. &gt;&gt; And then there's a season for fruit. &gt;&gt; And the thing of it is, I'm asking you tonight, what season are you in? Hallelujah. Like I said, get the pool ready. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I believe that there are some genuine Hallelujah. conversions in this room. &gt;&gt; No, I'm not saying that everybody is sinners and everybody got habits and all these things. Hallelujah. But what season are you in? &gt;&gt; God doesn't bring a a a a word like like the brother said this morning. Who told you that? And like I said about Solomon, Solomon experienced everything. He did everything under the sun. He experienced the music, the women, the men, the the the the the movies, all the stuff that you think about you want to do. Solomon experienced all of it. And his conclusion was all vanity &gt;&gt; and vexational spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; All of it made Solomon weary. &gt;&gt; He said the conclusion of the matter is to serve God. &gt;&gt; So I'll ask you if you leave this room without God. I'll say you're telling yourself you love being in the condition you in. We say, "Well, I'm I'm just Brother brother D. I appreciate it. But I'm just I'm just trying to find God. I'm make this real plain. God is not missing. God is not in hiding. &gt;&gt; He's waiting on you to acknowledge his presence. He wants to do it for you greater than you want it. He's a deliverer. He's a peacegiver. He's a mighty conqueror. &gt;&gt; He's a warrior. &gt;&gt; He's help in the time of trouble. &gt;&gt; If you in trouble, he's your help. &gt;&gt; All of my help comes from the Lord. &gt;&gt; Every bit of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Every bit of it. But you ask yourself, you just want to be a pretty seed sitting in that atmosphere and ain't never bringing forth nothing. &gt;&gt; We're in the presence of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and that's all it's been was just a pretty seed. It ain't gave us nothing. But if I bury it, if I water it, if I bring it in the presence of the sun, &gt;&gt; it'll give me that life inside. &gt;&gt; I wonder tonight, young people, will you give me life? Will you give back life to me? Hallelujah. And some of us ain't so young. Some of us been living this way a long time, just being an idol worshipper. But what about knowing that God is in full control? &gt;&gt; That God is the one. Hallelujah. God is the one doing it. Hallelujah. What season are you in? See, right now this is spiritual warfare. And I know most of you are thinking about it. Don't think too long. Be prepared to make a decision. Will it be God or are you going to just go back to the life you was living? Hallelujah. Put the song up for me. I just want to speak the name of Jesus [Music] in every mind. Yes, I know there is peace within your presence. I speak Jesus. Let's say it again. I just want to speak.

But right now, we're in divine presence. The power of God is here. The healer is here. The one to give life is here. We don't need a prayer line.
