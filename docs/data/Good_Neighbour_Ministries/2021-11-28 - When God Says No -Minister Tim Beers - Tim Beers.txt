his presence sometimes i think of what words am i going to say to describe his presence it's just awesome amen just an honor and a privilege to to be here to uh serve him hear from him amen we're look we're coming into service this morning and some of the churches are closed down because a little bit of snow you know they stay home and stay online and we're just thinking well because they're not getting fed that real word of god there's no purpose in their lives but we come this morning because there's purpose amen purpose to hear from the king hallelujah so that we may leave different because we're in a battle we're we're on a journey and we want something to sustain us for this week amen so that we can press on amen hallelujah because that's what it's all about pressing on i believe that that angel that said that brother branham you don't know what lies ahead of you just keep pressing the battle how much more in this hour 50 60 years later when we see the world and the condition that it's in keep pressing the battle amen never give up i i believe a seed of abraham the attribute never gives up our flesh might want to give up but that attribute never gives up it keeps pressing on amen oh i thank you lord jesus that's why i love him so much this morning amen because we're standing here we're here this morning not because of our own selves our own strength our own works but because of him and his grace and we know his grace amen we know his grace amen paul says i want to know in the power of his resurrection i believe we know him in the power of his resurrection this morning we have that experience within us amen we are walking living epistles red of all man nothing nothing short of it that's who we are that's the confidence that we have in the word of god that's been delivered us in this hour amen amen thank you lord blessed be the name of the lord amen let's we got slide one um the first slide i guess um well here we are where what a what a what an experience what um a journey these 40 days of prayer if you really participated in it amen and and the faith that you have and how god led you amen and here we are at the last service of it i believe and uh there's no way we can finish it all there's like two or three parts to this but i'm just going to bring out what i i felt led to bring out this morning and whatever god will do amen because we we believe in god above man we believe that god can speak to every individual heart because we're all here at different levels and given different levels of faith and portions of faith and i believe god will speak to our hearts according to our faith amen amen hallelujah amen glory to god amen when god says no hallelujah we look at that and we we look at that statement when god says no what comes to your mind amen disappointment rejection amen but this morning we want to see we want to take a look that when god says no it's a blessing amen it's a blessing my brothers and sisters because he's the all-knowing god amen he knows the beginning he knows the end amen i started to work in you you didn't start that work i started the work and i will finish it i know what it's going to take to complete it and sometimes no is the answer to complete it amen let us turn to our scripture in second corinthians slide 2 12 7 to 10. this scripture any scripture is so compound it's like the roman candle brother branham says it just keeps going and exploding and exploding but this scripture is when god says no amen at least and least i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of revelations listen i'm telling you if there's anybody that has abundance of revelation in this hour it's the bride of jesus christ some of you sitting here this morning have abundance of revelation amen and that is glorious but there is given to me a thorn in the flesh a messenger of satan to buffet me lest i should be exalted don't look at the don't look at the thorn in the flesh don't look at satan being the messenger but lest i should be exalted above measure for this thing i besought the lord thrice three times that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee in other words no three times paul asked three times god said no three times for my strength is made perfect in weakness now listen most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me wow therefore i take pleasure in infirmities and reproaches and necessaries and persecutions in distress for christ's sake for when i am weak then i am strong wow we love to hear victorious we love to hear about us feeling great and feeling strong and being healed and having no problems no stress but paul's saying i glory if that is god's will i approached god three times he said and he said no to me three times so he's saying if that is god's will for my life then i will glory in his will regardless of what it is because he but paul knew god knew what was best for him and what it would take for paul to become strong is to be weak and to keep them straight in line and keep them humble let us pray father bless your word now your word is blessed blessed to our hearts bless the speaker who needs you desperately lord and a hearer who needs you desperately because flesh and blood has not revealed this unto any one of us lord but my father which is in heaven has revealed this reveal your word this morning father may you be lifted up and you said if you're lifted up this morning and honored and praised in our hearts and nothing no other god stands before you then you will draw us unto you father into heavenly places grant these things i pray in jesus name amen god bless you you're seated amen glory to god praise his name amen slide three yes we love it when god answers our prayers in first john 5 14 to 15. but we want most is when he agrees with our requests and he says yes each and every one of us amen we want to hear yes when we pray yes yes lord amen but sometimes god answers no or not yet or wait amen as the good father will not grant us that which is not in our long-term best interest even when we plead to god as paul did pleading you might be pleading about something this morning over and over and over but maybe you haven't realized that the answer is no why i don't know we may never understand some answers that god says to us are mysteries but it's not about whether it's a mystery whether we understand or we don't understand it's our it's about our faith believing and trusting that he knows best you come out with anything this morning i pray your faith will come out believing and trusting that god knows best for our lives hallelujah god's yes answers builds our face faith builds our confidence in prayer but how do we respond when he says no accepting god's no can be a sticky situation in our lives amen the bible says in james a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways sometimes we don't know what to ask for god from god because we don't see his clear plan for our lives because it's got to be revealed that's where misinterpretations come in where people misplace the word in their lives because god still got to reveal it's an unfolding unrevealing plan that god is doing in our lives we don't know what's going to happen next week but we know who holds our next week we can look to the promises and see i don't know how it's going to take me to the rapture but i know i'm going in the rapture i know there's going to be a body change but in between that i got to trust and believe god and when he says no it doesn't hinder me it doesn't stop me it doesn't stop me from believing not if you're a true believer not have you been born again hallelujah yeah we look at the verses look at mark 11 24 matthew 21 22 these scriptures here if we look at them they're all about ask and you shall receive anything that you desire and you ask for i will grant it to you and we build doctrines around that we build like that is the only we take these scriptures and we look at them and we believe that that's the only thing that we claim in our lives that god is obligated look what he says here look what he says there but we need to take a step back and consider in acts 20 27 the whole council of god we got to take the whole word all of his characteristics and put it into plain view when we judge anything their saints shall judge the earth it said examine your faith amen judge your faith judge your own heart we need to take the whole counsel of god the whole word of god everything god says not only when he says ask and you shall receive seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open to you but also no paul i'm not removing this pain and suffering i'm not removing this thorn from you that's praying with revelation that's praying as this whole series is going on different parts of it that's praying when you're grown up in maturity and faith hallelujah slide four god says no when he has a bigger perspective we know that saints he sees the bigger picture he sees what we can't see he say he sees our whole life he sees from beginning to end amen we are limited in what we see god sees the wider view we don't god can see the future we can't god will always see stuff that we can't see he can see around the curve he can see the beginning the end the future he can see the impact of every choice every decision that we make he says i'll make all things work together for good to them that love me sometimes our choices our decisions are wrong they're bad he sees those things and he sees where that's going to lead you up the road so when you're praying making those decisions and those choices in your life he's got to say no i can't remove that from you because you're making wrong choices you're making wrong decisions for you for your family for your loved ones whatever i gotta keep that pain i gotta keep that thorn i gotta keep that there until you start seeing my plan my purpose for your life and making the right choices and the right decisions it's all good saints this is all good amen hallelujah amen thank you lord several times in the scriptures god did not do what people asked he is god he can see things we can't look at king david he pleaded with the lord for the life of his and besheba's infant son david fast and prayed for days but on the seventh day the child died second samuel 12 16 18 god said no why did god say no look what david did he took another man's wife he got the man's husband the wife besheba's husband killed and gave it look at him he's a man after god's own heart god said that but look at it why god said no you're not going to keep that son even though you fast and you prayed you cried out to me god is a just god he's a true righteous god he cannot honor sin [Music] so he said no david was david a cast away no was david lost no but david the sword never left his house until he was fully purged what made david do that was there was evil in his heart and that sword had to come and purge that out but he was he still beloved of god yes was he still a man after god's own heart yes did god still answer prayer in the future for david yes david's response listen he respond in a way that models for all of us he accepted that what god had done was right and good my my my i wonder if in our hearts when something happens in your life that you can respond like that instead of being bitter angry with god i'm angry with god i've heard that many times i'm disappointed in god you know my brothers and sisters all these kind of attitudes and and and and behaviors are passing away from the bride of jesus christ to the others i don't know but to the bride amen she's becoming that word made flesh again today and i'm speaking about the word i'm speaking how the word reacted when it became flesh amen hallelujah and he went into the house of the lord in verse 20 and worshiped my my my worship he went in god's presence and worshiped god you don't think david knew in his heart you don't think you don't know in your heart when you make a mistake or when you sin are you disobedient to god or in rebellion to god david knew but he went into the house of refuge amen where his strong and mighty tower was he went in there and he worshipped god because that's the only refuge that he had no other help could help him nothing in this world would you if you could still depend on the world you can still depend on family and and man to help you you haven't arrived yet there's nothing that can help a child of god but god himself he left that for himself i'm a jealous god over you my people i love you with a love eternal love you may not understand everything i do and the way i do it in your life is because i love you hallelujah david hoped for a different outcome but god is god and god has a right to make a life and death decision blessed be the name of the lord he giveth he taketh away still blessed be his name in his grief david did not become bitter towards the lord or turn away from god david's response to god's no was a deeper worship a deeper surrender even in his heartache even in his heartache there was a deeper surrender a deeper worship oh hallelujah hallelujah i hope after this service you're just going to bless the name of the lord god of israel amen for all the no's amen i mean we we come in here yo yes yes yes yes oh hallelujah yes the lord said yes the lord answered my prayer and he said yes glory to god well may you leave here today saying hallelujah father not my will but thy will be done if it's a no blessed be your name hallelujah glory to god the new testaments give us more examples of times when god said no to his servants the apostle paul was sent to travel through asia minor to preach the gospel of god in acts uh in acts 16 6-9 paul thought he he understood the plan of god he believed he was to continue in asia but the holy spirit said no paul because paul's desire was to listen and obey come on saints was to listen and obey regardless of what the costs he left asia minor and went to macedonia instead now listen he started churches that impacted the whole world by god's no to him and by his obedience started churches to impact does god know what he's doing does god know where he's leading us and why he's leading us there why why our brothers here and the ministry here gets led in a certain way does god know what he's doing when we want to do this we want to do that god says no go over here and do this we want to be like paul amen and just come under obedience to it amen hallelujah his response to god's no was instant obedience and a change of direction not fighting up come on not arguing with god not debating with god not complaining to god but was instantly obedience to god when you realize who you're talking to and who's talking back to you you're going to respond this way i got no life i got no breath i can't do i can't live tomorrow without him i understand that and i understand that more and more than i ever did before oh my thank you jesus slide 5. glory to god amen slide 5 that's a promise of god god answers every single prayer he doesn't answer in the way you like every time but he answers no is an answer wait is an answer grow up is an answer in a little while as an answer god never leaves prayer unanswered hallelujah never does slide 6 in hebrews 4 13. now listen saints we read these scriptures over and over let it become a reality to you it says for the word of god is quick and powerful what did john say john says in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god that is who we're talking about this morning that is who is controlling our lives amen if we're born again and filled with his spirit amen this is who's in control of our lives amen and you're gonna you're gonna see through this scripture why he knows all things he sees all things and he has the right answer for you amen why because the word of god which is god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even dividing asunder the soul and spirit and of the joints of the marrow he's a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart amen it's quick it's powerful when it gets into your life it's quick it's powerful when it discerns your hearts when it discerns your thoughts it's quick and it's powerful when it even discerns the very intentions that you have the very mortars that you have it's quick and it's powerful and it's sharp now listen hallelujah neither is any creature that is not manifest in his sight all things are open to him but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him who sees us oh my where who are we talking about here the word of god god himself we're exposed the bible says we're naked there's not any more exposed you can be in the flesh than being naked and that's what we are to god it says right here that he knows the motives and intentions of your heart you know sometimes you might think that your motives and your attentions are good david wanted to build the temple solomon's temple god says no too much blood on your hands solomon's going to build it god is the one who redirects our motives and our intentions that's why he says god is his own interpreter he will make it plain we are not to interpret the word of god but god will interpret it in our lives god will bring it to pass in our lives god will show us not us because in us there's wrong motives wrong intentions amen wrong desires hallelujah amen there are a lot of examples in the bible where god says no to great man and woman of faith prayers that were prayed by abraham god said no moses no daniel no job no jonah no elijah no peter paul god said no to them there are prayers that were unanswered meaning they weren't answered the way we asked for them to be answered god said no we hear and say all the time that god answers prayer in the bible ask and you shall receive seek and ye shall find and we have that confidence in the word that he hears and he answers prayer and we don't have to lose that confidence because he does hear and answers prayers but we need to get that yes out of our minds as the only absolute because it's not because no is an absolute maybe he's an absolute weight is an absolute that's part of our walk is part of our experience with god and knowing god amen hallelujah glory to god thank you lord slide seven second chronicles 7 14 if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves we heard it in this series being humble it's a very important characteristics and attribute that we need before god and pray we need to humble ourselves we need to pray and we need to seek his face and when we humble ourselves in his presence and we pray and we pray till we break through not just pray all what you want to pray god hear my prayer hear my request hear my words but you pray until you break through and then when you break through you shut up and he speaks have you been there if you haven't been there you need to pray through and be there you need to ask god lord i need to get to that place because when you break the sound barrier you go into that peace and that all where brother branham said he said when i was just sitting there i was praying and praying praying praying for a message all of a sudden i broke through he said and all of a sudden the lord starts speaking scriptures to him making things clear there's nothing that becomes clear in your life you might be struggling with something you might be confused about something you might be wrestling like jacob wrestling with the angel with something but let me tell you if you humble yourself lord i'm nothing without you lord i need your answer i need your understanding i need you to help me to see what i need to see in this situation and pray earnestly until you break through that's what it means don't pray honestly repetition repetition repetition you pray until you break through we're praying for our purpose my brothers and sisters everything is for a purpose and what is it to connect with god to come face to face with god in his presence what is this all about his only brother branham is going to come face to face with god only brother branham is going to has come to that place where god spoke to him no no i don't believe that i believe the word is being made flesh again today in the bride i believe the same god that gave brother branham those experience and met with him and developed a relationship with him molded him shaped him developed him brung faith and perfect faith with inside of him is the same god it's got to be saints how's his rapture is going to take place if we just think we can stay at home and listen to the tapes and and that's it they're good they're good yes the voice of god comes off of those tapes but let me tell you the voice of god is sounding out with many waters this morning the voices in the bride of jesus christ this morning deities on her lips this morning speaking her word his word this morning [Music] that's what's bringing the unity the perfection of the saints of god people don't see they don't understand that it's not man it's not man in the five-fold ministry it's god in the five-fold ministry it's god bringing to perfection it's god speaking to the people man can't be touched man can't touch this word of god men can't touch and go in the presence of the god and live oh my and turn from your wicked ways your whirly ways your unbelieving ways you're fighting up ways you're you know you're disappointed ways you're complaining ways every way they're all wicked ways when we don't have this attitude and this this this behavior that paul had when it came his way that david had when it came his way they're all wicked ways who are we who are we to answer god who are we to talk back to god who are we to say to that today to the potter make me this way i'm only to play he knows how to make me you want to be free you want to have peace of mind you want to have peace of heart be free that god is in control he has a right to do what he wants to do in your life [Music] oh we pray for our children we pray for our husbands and our wives we pray for all the blessings all the things that go good and great with everything we pray and there's nothing wrong with god god has a right to do what he wants to do in every one of those situations and sometimes he does those things as to see your attitude oh you got great faith god just laughs at us my brothers and my sisters you got great faith look what god's doing my life look at all my interpretations that i got of the word of god great abundance of revelation god gives you a messenger of satan to buffet you to humble you we say lots of prayers lots of power little prayer little power no prayer no power we get excited when we talk about prayer because why why saints because he's a prayer answering god but we only see it in one direction amen oh yeah he's a heart fixing god he's a problem solving god he's a pain relieving god he's a way making god he's a cancer killing god he's a job finding god he's a marriage saving god but is he still god when he says no to any one of these requests oh my you look in the word of god don't take what i'm saying go back in your bible go back in the scriptures if you don't believe it it's not my problem i'm preaching the word of god this morning if you're sitting here this morning i only accept yes i only accept yes you've got a stubborn spirit on you from the devil and i rebuke it in the name of jesus christ [Music] the word of god is still a discerner of the thoughts and tense of the heart we see god saying yes to daniel in the lion's den yes to the three hebrews children in the fiery furnace yes to the woman with the issue of blood yes to the crippled man at the pool when god says yes we jump for joy when he gives us freedom when he gives us money he opens doors he blesses us with protection he helps our children when he says yes we jump for joy amen glory to god thank you jesus yes yes he said yes to moses to moses request to see his glory in exodus 33 17 he said yes to solomon for the request for his wisdom in first kings 3 11-13 and jesus said yes to everyone who asked them for healing and help matthew 8 16. he said yes yes i want to see your glory god's going to say yeah amen yes to that i want to see his glory yes god wants that solomon asks for wisdom you want wisdom you need wisdom we all do revelation we need it god says yes i'll give you wisdom i'll give you revelation i'll show you why you have to go through what you're going through it doesn't mean i'm going to take it away but you're going to understand like paul understood amen but our faith-filled request doesn't supersede god's sovereign rule if he was bound by your prayers as some teach he would in effect cease to be god we love to pray we should pray we preach on praying but god ain't bound to your prayers god will answer every prayer but it ain't bound to them to your request and how you're praying and what you want because he knows what's best for us amen what do we do when god says no we pray in faith and fasting what we do everything we can do but god still says no you pray for some and god says yes you pray for others and god says no remember brother branham the same in the same situation came up before him and billy paul was standing right there same situation and he said yes to the one woman and the same situation came up and he said no he says dad why'd you say yes and why you say no because i never said yes or no god said it because one was telling the truth and one was lying wow wow why do some people get relief from pain their pain and others don't i know what that's like i've seen and i'm here to right here manifested people get prayed for their pain their back pain is gone and i still got mine i still got mine this morning i couldn't barely get off the chair i still got it but i'm going to glory in it i'm going to praise god in it i'm up here because i want to serve and worship the lord jesus christ because i know he's not limited to just oh he doesn't meet god or make him god to me because he can take away my pain good if he does if he doesn't good to praise his name anyhow if he does and if he doesn't praise his name i'm going to do my best to serve him he's the only thing he's life to me he's the only thing that is life to me amen and you too hallelujah why do some couples pray for a child and they get a child and others just a sincere claim in the promises of god and they don't get a child and their hearts are broken by that in other words why does god sometimes say yes and why does he sometimes say no he has a reason for doing all things my brothers and sisters oh my he's such an individual god this is such an individual walk individual experience with god we are not at the same place amen i might be ahead of you i might be humble in you in some areas amen and you might be prideful in those areas and in other areas i might be stubborn and you might be humble so god knows he's designing each and every one of us we are his workmanship don't become one another's workmanship don't criticize don't judge each and every one of us god is the judge you want to find fault we say it many times in me there's lots of faults you can find in me all over the place amen but i'm not looking through your eyes i'm not looking through my eyes i'm looking through the blood i'm looking through his eyes i'm looking at what he says i am and i know my brothers and sisters i'm sinless [Laughter] i don't do iniquity iniquity is not imputed unto me my my my i think the bride is going to start when she starts raising up to that level going to start being misunderstood even in the message misunderstood oh yeah this is the day that brother brought him long to see not messes puppets and messes uh churches just sitting around being lazy lukewarm and religious but he wanted to see that word amen raised to a level inside of hers where she recognizes who she is where she becomes invincible amen to what to herself to sin to the elements this world invisible my glory thank you lord jesus blessed be the name of the lord god of israel blessed be your name above all names lord ah hallelujah slide 8 hallelujah there's three things my brothers and sisters that we do when we go into prayer we affirm god's power knowing that god can do anything that everything is possible with god he can take care of every situation that we have he can take away suffering he can take away pain instantly he's all powerful he's all-knowing we go affirming his power in prayer then we go with passion in prayer pleading and asking and praying with passion and desire in our hearts to see god moving to see god manifesting to see his glory come down amen so then when we pray we affirm his power we ask with passion then we accept his plan oh my they got to come together my brothers and sisters they have to fall in place when they fall in place the door opens amen it all opens up to you amen we accept his plan for our lives however god i want most what is your will yes i don't want to go through this suffering i don't want to go through this problem i don't want to go through this pain but nevertheless not what i want i even want more than what you want for my life and what your plan is i want your purpose i want your perspective i want your will however your will is not mine but yours to be done that that's what i want lord when you pray that prayer god is pleased because he knows you trust in him he knows you believe in him he knows you got faith that's faith that operates that's the key that turns the door and opens up the door oh my glory to god thank you jesus when you think about it there are some mysteries but there are also obvious things let me bring out a couple things here i would just want to lay in they're not deep they're not spiritual but they're common sense because i like to bring in common sense because it's not common anymore when two people are praying for the opposite thing obviously god can't answer both of you if a child is praying for snow the child got the snow today he's and they don't want to go to school and the parent is praying for clear weather so that they can go to the work obviously one is going to get answered and one is not all around america and canada the football games going on people are praying for the opposite teams you know what half of them are going to be disappointed half of them are going to hear god say yes which i i don't i don't it's not for me to judge whether god answers their prayers for football games or hockey games or that stuff i'm not going to go there you want to go there you go there i'm not going to go there but the other half is going to be like oh god said no why didn't god let my team win i'm like wow thank you but even if he did 50 would get it like i'm praying for my candidates amen when you pray for your candidates you're praying for the liberals amen i'm praying for the pc you're praying for the ppc somebody's going to win and somebody's going to lose you know what i ain't going to base my faith on whether you win the liberals or i lose the pc amen i'm not going to base my faith i'm not going to base my interpretation of god's answer on those things on the word that's where god is in the beginning was the word the word was god get back to the word that's where the bride is that's where the bride loves to be that's where she surrendered to the lord oh my then there are some prayers that we pray and if god wasn't to answer them we'd have to take he'd have to take our free will away our free choice from other people now listen my brothers and sisters if somebody came up to you and said i am praying that god forces you to marry me wow funny funny i guarantee you i guarantee you that this prayer has been prayed father give me that wife father give me that husband i claim them in the name of jesus christ whether they love me whether they are attracted to me or not i want them because you said ask and i shall receive give me the desires of my heart i want that she's prettier than the other one he's more handsome than the other one what if somebody came up to you and said i'm praying amen that you're it's going to happen because god is not going to take away our free will and that person could pray all they want god's not god's going to say no because god is not in the business of taking away our free choice he made us in his image and he's not going to overrule your choice god can force anybody think about it we're talking about god this morning but he can't force anybody to change their mind he can't force you to make the right choices in the right decisions yes he can no he can't no he can't it's judah's got to do it but let me tell you one thing by faith and only by faith the bride of jesus christ has given up her free more agency to the will of god she is surrendering it to the will of god not surrendering to this not surrendering to that what she believes her flesh the world whatever she surrendering it to the will of god lord take my free more agency away take my rights away take it all away and take control then whether it's a yes i praise your name whether it's a no i praise your name whether it's weight i bless your name sometimes god looks down and says are you crazy i hope you're not there this morning are you crazy asking me that come on saints this word is glorious this word that we've been feeding off of the double-minded man should be getting away from us in all the unstable ways amen god is not going to force you to marry somebody god can't force you to fall in love with somebody and by the way god can't force somebody to stay in love hello hello he can't force somebody to stay in love with you lord my wife my husband make them love me let make them still love me no no that's your problem that's your situation you stay in love with her you do things for her you do things for him you keep the honey in the moon god gives you the word god gives you his characteristics he shows his love to you you show it to one another not praying where you're you're acting so miserable you're treating each other so wrong misusing your words degrading his position her position trying to bring him as a as a nobody trying to make her as a dominating female and and be dominated under you god ain't doing none of those things god is his word he shows you in his word how to treat one another how to love one another so don't pray and ask for that you act upon the word you go into word and see what the word says you act upon it god will back his word up god some of you have prayed that prayer god made my spouse not leave but he left they left why why do they leave because doesn't god doesn't force anybody to do anything right he doesn't saints he doesn't force you to do anything right you make the bad choices in your life and it's yours not his can he correct it yes can he change it yes it's all in the approach of faith he doesn't force you to do anything right that he then that will make you a puppet and god doesn't have puppets i know the message has puppets i'm not going to get into it he doesn't force anybody else if you're praying god i want you to change that person's mind and make them do this well god says no i don't do that why would you would i do that to anybody else so that's a logical reason why people pray for things that actually don't happen and god says no now that can be confusing because you're going to have many knows from god in your lifetime that can be confusing it can be well if god is truly loving and if god has the power to control everything why is my request denied good question it can be confusing it can be frustrating why do some people get miracles and others don't why when we pray for people who are sick and some get well and some die that's frustrating it's hard to understand and it's not because they got greater faith than you it's not because uh you know like look at job he was criticized you're a sinner i got a miracle because i'm not a sinner you didn't get one because you're a sinner no it's not because of that it's because god has a greater plan god has a reason and a purpose behind it and you know what it's none of your business just rejoice and be thankful that you got your miracles because the next time you ask it might be no for you it's frustrating is it okay to question god question is it okay to question god my sometimes we're we're so afraid he he never projects himself that way i know to me he doesn't he doesn't project himself that to where i'm afraid of him any parent any father that their children is afraid of you there's something wrong there's a there's a demon there's a wrong spirit there children should never be able to be afraid to come to their father never never come to their father and ask them questions it's not wrong to question god now listen yes it's okay to question god because there's a difference listen between questioning god and doubting god that's where you're getting confused when we doubt we are saying i am not sure i believe if you are real or true when we question god we say i believe but i just don't understand why so question is saying i know you are real and you are true but i don't understand why you do what you do in my life and there's nothing wrong with questioning god because i don't understand all the ways amen brother brown said in the high colon you're not going to understand all the thousands of ways and he's not going to explain all the thousands of ways how he deals with you but i still got a right to come to my father and question him on certain things because i know i'm when i come out of it i know he's going to answer me when he answers me is going to clear up everything for me amen he's going to make everything clear and plain to me i'm not gonna say oh you know you know like if a child like would go back to it if a child is scared to go to the father he's gonna develop insecurities because they're afraid of the father because every child has a lot of questions that needs to be answered as they're grown up and as they're maturing and the father needs to be there to answer those questions or say you know what son or daughter later on in life you're going to understand life is going to explain things to you and the word it will explain things later on in our walk i don't want to develop any insecurities against god i want to be free in god i want to go like like that that that the king there was in a meeting and a child walked into the room anybody else their head would have been taken off but their child walked in and he stopped everything and paid attention to the child i believe that's the way god is with us amen his nose are are are because he loves us so much so much amen when we doubt we are saying i'm not sure i believe or if you're real when we question we say we believe what we just don't understand so questioning i say you're real but i don't understand if god can handle our sins don't you think he can handle our questions think about it if he can handle our disobedience if he can handle our mess when god says yes we believe and when he says no we believe you see faith believes all the time even when it's dark painful it still believes even when the pain is here or gone faith always believed nothing working everything is going to work out for our good when you're feeling bad faith believes god is good all the time amen slide nine now listen brother brown was speaking here in perfect faith i came across this quote and something a little bit different like it always does jumps out on you we've read this quote many times and per and uh let me see here about perfect faith now perfect faith is the master of all circumstances you know that's really what we're talking about this morning we're talking about perfect faith master in all our circumstances faith mastering our god's nose god's yes's maybes weights faith mastering because perfect faith is what's mastering in our life in him in the word of god it masters everything perfect faith masters all circumstances no matter what it is it masters it you see no matter what it is you're going through faith will master it my brothers and sisters faith will control it faith will bring it under subjection now just watch he says when you believe anything do anything and you've got faith in what you're doing no matter what the circumstance is that don't have one thing to do with it now that doesn't i don't see in there where god is saying you have faith in what you're doing that god is going to remove it god is going to heal you it doesn't say that there it says when you've got faith to do anything and you've got faith no matter what you're going through that faith will master it that faith will bring it under subjection to the word of god and god's plan and purpose for your life we we look at these scriptures sometimes and we don't see and i see raiden there that faith no matter what we go through what we're in the stage of our life right now the circumstances that you're in right now the situations that you're dealing with the pain the hurt the heartache whatever it is that if you've got faith your faith will master it your faith will control it instead of it controlling you bringing you into doubt bringing you into disobedience bringing you into rebellion but your faith says no it brings you under subjection it brings you unto believing god that's what perfect faith does in our lives you see it masters that circumstance no matter what it is in your life that you're going through it masters it it doesn't say anywheres to hear that you're going to be delivered from it or a miracle is going to take place or anything it might might not but one thing it says here that your faith will master it and control it not it controlling you faith believes that god will work it out no matter which way it works out whether the thorn in paul's flesh stays or goals god is going to work it out for his good amen i don't know how he's going to do it but he'll do it anyhow why because faith masters all circumstances faith masters our feelings when god says no job said though thou slay me i will trust in you faith says i trust in you lord though you slay me faith was jesus on the cross when he said my god my god why hast thou forsaken me don't tell me you haven't been there in your walk in your experience things that you have gone through attacks that you've gone through and you look up to my god my god have you forsaken me but faith when jesus came back and said not my will but yours be done there it is saints here's god and flesh my god my god going through such pain and agony despair i don't i can't even explain what he went through saying my god my god but the master of faith says not my will but thy will be done lord oh my oh my i surrender all i surrender all all to jesus i surrender i surrender all oh lord amen let's try to wind this up faith means believing all the time faith is not getting everything you pray for every time i don't take faith to believe in god if god doesn't do everything i want him to do every time and when we want god to do it in the way we want god to do it that doesn't take faith faith means when god says yes we believe when he says no we still believe faith means believing when we don't understand and when we do understand and when we don't know what god is saying we still believe faith is believing in every circumstances when the sun is out or when it's dark faith trusts in the lord faith in jesus in sin in the garden of gethsemane not my will but thy will be done romans 8 27 the same god here speaking and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what's in the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of god we always talk about we make intercession we got the ministry of intercession we could be a part of that ministry god can work through the misery but he is the intercessor he's the one that's interceding because only he knows the will of god for our lives we don't know all things but we know all things work together for good now sometimes god says no to our prayers to protect us from something that we can't see to guard us proverbs 2 8 god guards the course of the just and protects the ways of the faithful ones that's why he says no sometimes slide 10 notice guards and protection what does it mean it doesn't mean god takes away takes you out of the trouble it doesn't mean he takes you out of the flying pan that you're in it means he leaves you in the frying pan he just keeps you from being burnt wow that's a different uh logical uh thing you know like sometimes that blows up people's brains they take scriptures like we're talking about and say no no no when i when i serve god i you know no pain you know when i serve god it's all beautiful roses and everything no sometimes god put you in the frying pan amen oh yes brother i don't want to go into fire but hallelujah now thank you lord where am i okay here we are remember the old testament daniel was not listening to the king and the king was going to throw him in to the lion's den to be eaten daniel prays god keep me out of the lions then god says no you're going in he puts him in the lion's den but what does god do he shuts the lion's mouth it becomes a bigger story a bigger testimony a bigger miracle amen and that's why god will put you in the lions then so that you come out stronger amen you come out with a testimony you come out with a victory glory to god amen remember the story of the three hebrew children who defiled the kings and and wouldn't obey the king he says you're going to go into the fiery furnace they said lord keep us out of the fiery furnace god says no let them go into the fiery furnace but i'll walk with you i'll walk with you in the furnace oh do you want to know him in the sufferings do you want to know him in the pain do you want to know him in the power of his resurrection when he resurrects you out of that situation that you're in that seems impossible oh my oh glory to god amen they were untouched they weren't burned that's our god when the every every trial everything you go through amen you're going to prosper you're going to come out better on the other end you're going to be victorious that i can say is in the word of god that you're going to overcome you're going to be an overcomer you're going to cast out every demon everything that's binding you in your life that is true god is going to deliver you yes he's going to deliver you from cancer whether he delivers you out of here or or he takes it out of your body when they came out the ropes that had them tied and bound and bound them down they were burnt off anything that binds any son and daughter of god amen god's gonna burn those ropes he's gonna break those chains he's going to open those prison doors for you just believe trust in him and walk where he's leading you follow those bloody footprints wherever they lead he knows what he's doing he knows what he's doing saints god don't let me go through the fiery trial you're going to go through it my son my daughter whether you like it or not so start liking it because not just causes too many hindrance too many delays in your walk but when you come out on the other side i'll promise you something i'll be there i'll protect you i'm going to walk right beside you and when you come out of the other side now listen to me jesus christ says you're going to be free you're going to be free from that habit you're going to be free from that person you're going to be free from that fear you're going to be free from that guilt you're going to be free from that shame you're going to be free from anything that binds you and holds you who the son of man sets free is truly free indeed in every deed in your life i know i got to flesh that sticky to the end but i god of faith that believes god beyond this flesh i don't know about you this flesh ain't gonna tie me down and all the mistakes in this flesh i got a faith that believes god is real and what he said he can do even when this thing says haha look i raise up all the time look at this habit i keep getting you you get weak and i come in my faith goes you're destroyed you're defeated hallelujah you're getting weaker every time you manifest in my body you're getting weaker you're being cast out because faith the holy ghost inside of me is pushing you out little by little i'll deliver my people i'm going to push that thing out of you oh and then god says i said oh lord lord lord help me in this area help me lord to overcome this god says okay walk with me we're going in the lions then walk with me we're going in the fiery furnace oh yes lord yes lord i trust you i believe you oh i i i don't need to understand because that just confuses me i don't need to doubt that's unbelief i just need to have faith oh my amen thank you lord the thing that has been binding you up is going to be burnt off and it wouldn't happen unless you went through the fire sometimes god says no to set you free slide 11. god says no when he has a better plan now listen isaiah 55 again let's look at these scriptures a little different this morning 55 8-9 for my thoughts hello are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways god speaking here higher than your ways and my thoughts then your thoughts why that's why why no that's why why wait that's why because his ways are hired in my ways his thoughts are not my thoughts that's why settle it okay lord that's it question answered thank you lord why because god says i know the plans i have for you i know the plans i have for your life when you were in your mother's room i knew you i know what i ordained for you i know your path of life i know the beginning the end on the alpha and the on the omega i know everything that you're going to go through who are we serving who we believe in who are we surrendering to oh i all known god i know the plans i have for you i'm gonna bless you but this doesn't look like a blessing i'm gonna bless you i'm gonna prosper you this doesn't look like prosperity i'm gonna prosper you wait and see wait and see oh my hallelujah we're winding it down here i'm going to keep saying that because you're going to get a little bit boost every time i say that because hey he's going to close he's going to close whoo i got energy coming now he's going to close hallelujah amen hey we got to be smart up here you know we got to be manipulators too you know like paul you know i took off this church the stewards of that i got to be smart up here too amen shake you guys up a little bit you want to stand go ahead and stand amen amen praise the lord whatever you need to do but remember i'm i'm up here you know with a sciatic nerve i with i'm not going to get into it amen but i'm up here amen because of his grace because i love him and i'm honored i am honored timothy means honor and god i said lord i want to honor you that's all i wanted what can i do what can we do you're going to go home you're going to sit on the couch you're probably going to put on something on tv i hope you don't you're going to waste your time but you come into the house of the lord and you're like oh my when is this going to be over come on my brothers and sisters god is trying to impart eternal life to you trying to deliver you trying to set you free trying to get you into a place where faith can take a hold of you and you may see those changes that you're praying for and desiring what is better than the lord if there's anything better than the lord you need to get to this altar amen you need to pray until you break through and and and feel his presence engulf you and fill you there's nothing better than the lord i know we're in the flesh i'm going to try to hurry up amen but just have the right attitude that's all when any preacher comes up here he's up there he's up here doing it because of you that's all we can do god says no when there's a greater purpose look at the next verse second corinthians these present troubles the ones you're going through right now are quite small compared to eternity now they won't last long for the troubles you see will soon be over but the joys that are coming are eternal just think about it the bible says that these troubles that you're going through that seem so big are nothing compared i'm looking to the compared my brothers and sisters i'm not looking for the troubles here and what i'm going through here i'm looking to to compare what compares this doesn't compare to that what i'm going to get over there my treasures that are laid up in heaven the the kingdom of god amen that i'm pressing myself into every day press with violence sometimes press with blood sometimes press with striving sometimes with agony sometimes with pain sometimes but press into the kingdom of god because the kingdom has come it has come the kingdom is here amongst you now this day this scripture is fulfilled in our eyes [Music] hallelujah glory to god thank you lord paul choose to delight in weakness in hardship and persecution and difficulties paul says when i'm weak then i'm strong god often says no to things we yearn to see happen those with immature faith sometimes use this excuse to abandon him altogether god didn't heal my baby god didn't save my marriage god didn't give me that job i needed our view is that god is obligated to grant our requests like a genie grants wishes when we when then then we will be dismayed when god doesn't perform for us think about it think about it that's not me that's not me i've never done that yes you have yes you have you have treated god like a genie sometimes he's got to perform this he's got to do this yes you have sorry to humble your pride we choose whether allow a no from god to shatter our faith or build it up it's your choice a no from god can teach us to in to endure and even when we don't understand james 1 3 slide 13. i only got one more slide after this saints we're going down we're coming down to the end here you pray for me you pray for me hallelujah except god to give us his grace to handle his answer i expect god to give his grace that's his strength his power to handle his answer what is grace grace is god's power to handle pain god's grace grace is god's power to do the right thing anyways even when it's painful i'm going to do the right thing hallelujah why did god say to paul my grace is sufficient why didn't god say my peace my love my mercy my will is sufficient for you paul but he said paul my grace is sufficient for you grace is what god does for us without us asking anything there goes the scriptures ask and you shall receive seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened to you grace stands alone stands by itself as an attribute of god because grace gives us something that we don't ask for grace gives us something that we don't deserve that's why he says paul my grace is sufficient for you oh my he gives us what we usually don't deserve grace gives us what we need it doesn't give us what we want if god says god says no he's given us what we need and that's what his promise said i will supply all your needs and all will work for good lord you promise your supply all my needs i need this much money i need this i need this i need this god says i did say i was going to supply all your needs but you need to know oh let's let's let's close this off soon let's let's try to i only i only got this i only got this and they're big big letters because i i got i have to do big letters and and uh my wife says how many pages you got i said i got four t's she goes what hey and i said yeah but they're big letters and i still need glasses praise god amen we're get we're getting down here saying so i just want to close this off and wrap this thought off i hope that you're seeing something clear here amen it is often in the season when god says no that we are forced to pursue god more earnestly god's nose often shatters the tiny box in which we try to put him in and allow god to reveal himself and who he is to us he says no when is a part of his greater plan his will he says no when our lack of faith indicates that we do not truly believe or trust in him and who he is hebrews 11 6 he says no when our requests are rooted in selfishness james 4 3 or or when a yes is harmful to us he says no when like paul we must learn that he is grace and sufficient for us god who experience god who experience god's know help us learn the right response when he says no to us when god says yes hallelujah musicians come i want you to say this with me i had this this vision in my mind when i when i when i wrote this down repeat after me say it with me amen we're going to say when god says yes hallelujah when he says no hallelujah when he says slow hallelujah when he says wait hallelujah amen so when god says yes what do we say hallelujah when god says no what do we say when god says wait what do we say when god says not now what do we say glory to god why because we keep growing in faith the work he has completed has to complete in us we don't know what is what's going to happen in our homes we don't know what's going to happen in our jobs with our kids with our church but we know one thing that god is in control even if it looks bad faith says it's going to work out for my good psalms 37 25 i've been young and now i am old yet i have not seen the righteous forsaken or his seed begging for bread never has god forsaken us i will never never never leave you i will never forsake you but even i'll give you something greater i will be with you and i will be in you to the end of time to the end of time i'll be with you and in you hallelujah if god be for us who can be against us you tell me that this morning any trial any circumstance any devil out there any pharaoh out there anything that's coming against you in your life if god before you if god before you who can be against you who can overpower you who can take control of you if god be for you amen god says no i will trust in him and i will grow when he says no i will trust in him and i will grow mark 13 31 heavens and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away i hope you see that on a different light this morning heavens and earth everything that's connected to this flesh everything that's connected to this life this world that we are walking through and battling through will pass away but my word my promises that's becoming flesh inside of you will never pass away hallelujah amen psalm 7 8 the lord shall judge the people judge me david said o lord according to thy righteousness and according to my integrity that is that is in me slide 14 god has all eternity to fulfill his promises there's about six or seven thousand promises given to you but god is not limited by your 80 or 90 years on earth god has all eternity to fulfill his promises and some of the promises that god has given you and given to you are going to be fulfilled in heaven that is the truth my brothers and sisters that is god's honest truth that we're not going to see everything fulfilled down here we're not going to see every problem even the things that he promised you what does it mean when he says i laid up treasures in heaven not on the earth i laid them up there my promises are over there genesis 8 22 33 shall not the judge of the earth do right [Music] shall he not do right [Music] let's stand [Music] what is our response what is our faith what is our attitude what are our actions when god says no no is not a disappointment [Music] no is a blessing because god is guide in our lives because we trust in him we have faith in him we believe in him so when god says no we say amen you know what's best for me lord don't don't praise me with your lips and then when the situation comes your heart's far from me [Music] but let your heart be close to me that when i put you through things and i put you in the lines then i put you in a fiery furnace i put you in the trials let your heart be close to me let your heart believe me let your heart have faith that i'm going to take you through i'm going to walk through this with you i'm right beside you i'm right in you i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you
