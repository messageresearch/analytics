into the house of the Lord thank you musicians God bless you hallelujah praise God what a wonderful opportunity to be here tonight and this was the right song uh to uh bring the Holy Spirit into uh the house tonight to minister to our needs to express his word how many's under expectation to receive the word of God Amen praise God we come together on Wednesday nights they are Bible study opportunities for us gives the Holy Spirit an opportunity to just be real um simple and uh and right down to the Simplicity of his word we want to be able to grow in Christ but we we need the ABCs to be our foundation amen we need to recognize our foundation praise God and so we're going to be um we're continuing along the lines of rapturing Faith series I believe that um this message in this hour um that's that the holy spirit is bringing us to is going to give us the final change where we shall be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye that's going to require rapturing faith brother brandham said the Rapture is a revelation and the revelation of God's word and how you fit into God's word and who you are in the word of God must be perfect in your Revelation and when that happens you're going to be changed you're going to be in your position you'll know exactly who you are why you've been called and so let's let's go to the word of God tonight and let's get started tonight we're going to going to just lay in a a foundation um we're not going to keep you late okay this is going to be just a foundation we'll be going deeper into it on Sunday and as we go on this could end up being another five or six um Services because it's um we're going to title this seeing yourself in the word seeing yourself in the word and we're going to focus in on that we're going to look at all the aspects of that and tonight let's just lay let's just uh see how the Holy Spirit lays in the foundation for us amen praise God but it's still going to take your faith for you to see yourself in the word of God Amen let's pray father what a privilege and what an honor it is Lord to uh read your word and then to have the spirit of Revelation upon us to recognize to hear and to act upon your word Lord we ask your blessing upon it tonight anoint uh hearer and speaker Lord give us um such uh encouragement through the word of God lord we give you thanks and we give you praise in Jesus name amen praise God and uh you can put up the uh first slide we're reading from 2 Corinthians chapter 3: 18 it says but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord amen the Lord add His blessings to the word you may be seated I'm going to read that now from the Amplified version um and I want you to recognize here what it says it says and all of us as with unveiled face because we continue to behold in the word of God as in a mirror the glory of the Lord are constantly being transfigured into his very own image in ever increasing Splendor from one degree of Glory to another for this comes from the Lord who is the spirit praise God hallelujah you know when I read that it just it just exploded into another uh you know like the Roman Candle it just keeps exploding amen because um the word of God is a mirror and uh he's explaining here that that we are actually looking into the mirror of the word of God but we should be actually seeing his very image in us being expressed through the word of God and so when we look into the word of God we should be open face beholding as a glass the glory of the Lord we should be seeing that the word is talking about my experience and what is in store for me as a son or a daughter of God as I grow in the revelation of God's word and especially in the revelation of God's word for this day because the word for this day is producing something that is completely uh unrealized by the Christian world out there remember God is always being praised for what he's going to do for what he's done but they fail to recognize what he's doing right now and this is what you've come into this is your identification you've identified with the word for your day had you been in the day when Jesus was walking the Earth which was the word made flesh walking in the midst of the people would you have recognized him and would you have been able to see that he was actually expressing you that he was calling you that he had come for you you in particular amen that you were the one that he had in his mind when he was walking here on the Earth and you know this message that we've received in this day and in this hour it's all about calling you it's all about God coming to you personally that's the difference between being a Christian in the world out there and being a Christian called of God knowing that you've been called recognizing yourself in the word of God and seeing that you actually have a part in God's plan for this day and it's a Supernatural Part there's there's nothing natural about it it's going to be so Supernatural that you can expect this body to be changed in a moment and in a twinkling of an eye amen praise God hallelujah so when you study the word of God you are actually looking into the mirror of God and you should be seeing yourself in the word what are you seeing are you seeing a god of History a god that is to come or a God that's here right now with you greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world Amen praise God the more you study the more you meditate the more you pray on the word of God what you see is the glory of God hallelujah and that glory is actually the true reflection of who you are we're going to be looking at things throughout this you know as I'm as I'm studying and as I'm preparing you know uh I start I started you know like last week or about two weeks ago the thought was you know on me again about positioning and understanding who we are and our our adoption in the body of Christ and why God has a five-fold Ministry why God is doing what he's doing and how it is that we can identify and know who we are because you know there's a lot of confusion out there right now a lot of people especially in this message there's people that are that that are not identifying themselves with Christ Eve the bride Christ in Bride form now being expressed in this day and in this hour and they have put they'll put everything on on just what the prophet said putting everything just on only what you know you just got to repeat what the prophet said what he said about the bride and how it is and and you know that he never makes any mistakes and you just got to you know you got everything that he said was thus sayeth the Lord you can't alter any part of it you see they're naturally looking at the letter naturally not understanding that it takes divine revelation to know the word of God and what it means and what it means to you and about you how can you just place it all because you know the moment you you just place it all on on well that's the message of the hour there's nothing else I need to know everything I need to know is in the tapes yeah there's a lot in the tapes and everything you probably need to know is in the tapes but do you have a revelation of it that's the difference do you have the spirit of Revelation that was on brother bradam to be able to express the word in such a way that he knew exactly who he was he knew he was Malachi 4 he knew that he was Revelations 10:7 he knew the the part that he had in the word of God and recognized that part and that was for his day and his season but there was prophecy that was coming forth that was going to call a bride that would know her part and what God was going to do in her time her season her age the portion of the word that was being allotted to her because it didn't stop when the prophet went off the scene remember he introduced The Mighty Angel so that the mighty Angel the head could come to meet with the body which is the body of Christ amen glory to God so this you seeing your yourself mirrored in the word of God this is what is called perfect faith in recognizing your day and your position in the body of Christ I know we talk about this all the time but I'm telling you this will never stop unfolding this revelation of who you are it'll never stop unfolding it is Christ The Mystery of God being revealed brother brandom said you know like I was reading you know Christ The Mystery of God revealed and he said that everything that he's been talking about all that he's been preaching all that he's been trying to express was all going to be culminated in that message if you go back and you read that message I'm telling you you've heard it maybe a dozen times twice many times I don't care how many times you heard it but if there's a word that's now in season for you to recognize so that you can receive your perfect Faith you're going to hear things you never heard before I read things over the last couple days I never heard before I might have heard them with my ears I might have read them with my eyes but the spirit of Revelation brought some understanding that was never revealed because God said Now's the Time now's your time now's your season now you're going to you're going to know who you are and you're going to know that you're you're standing on perfect faith in this hour and you're not going to be tossed about or to and fro and and be or in any way shape or form be deceived because Christ The Mystery of God is being revealed in you so we as ministers when we preach the word and we EXP Express the word for our day we read the quotes from brother brandom we're holding up God's mirror and we're we're looking to see who can look into that mirror and say hey that's me hey hey that's me that's me that's in the mirror there that's me that's expressing the word that's me that's recognized the part in the word of God that that that God put put in me in that attribute everything that you are everything that you ever will be in Christ is already in you it just needs to work itself out and it can only happen by Revelation you can't you can't put something like that on you can't uh impersonate something like that that's why the holy spirit said I'm going to come myself in the opening of that seventh seal he says there'll be no interpretation on that he says I'm going to interpret it myself I'm going to go to brother Glenn I'm going to go to brother Jack I'm going to go to brother uh so and so and sister so and so and I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to become personalized to them they're going to know that that they know Hallelujah glory to God they're going to know that I am a reality in their life they're going to so believe my word they're going to see signs and wonders and miracles in their own life if you can believe and so as we we we we Proclaim these quotes and we speak the word of God we're proclaiming your identity your representation your abilities all that God put into you he's speaking it into you he's Awakening you he's Awakening that attribute so that you consciously can come it's not that he needs to awaken the attribute because the attribute is God but he's Awakening your Consciousness your level of awareness so that you can see not in a dark place but you can see clearly who you are Hallelujah glory to God Amen it's your name it's your name written in the Lamb's Book of Life and that's why you can see you can recognize you can believe this word hallelujah you may have thought that you were undeserving of Salvation you know because now now we're going to look at some things we're going to look at some some aspects and some thinking uh processes that you know that that we have to deal with as humans listen I can come up here and I can start preaching mystery after mystery after mystery and it'll all be a it'll all just still be a mystery by the time you leave here if you don't learn the ABCs and recognize how the enemy is trying to defeat you and how to how the enemy is trying to distract you from the word that you are the part that you're supposed to fulfill the purpose why you've been called you're just coming to church you're just you're walking in those doors and leaving those doors in the same way that you came in unless you can recognize and are willing to overcome your own physical human weaknesses you need to overcome in Revelations 3 it says to them that overcome in this church age will I allow to sit with me in my Throne what what do you mean sit with you in your throne Lord you mean now you mean actually recognize that you're that you are in Christ that he is in you and that that is your hope of glory and that you can overcome Now by The Power of revelation of knowing who you are yes exactly and so you need to understand that you're that listen you you you don't deserve what came to you so let's get this straight it's nothing that you did you oh I I I I deserve this because I lived a good life you know so I deserve to receive the message of the hour God had to come to me because I was a good boy or I was a good girl has nothing to do with that the attribute of God landed In Your Vessel by the grace of God it's just the grace of God that's it period there go I but for the grace of God I you you were a sinner you were born in sin you were shaped in sin you were shaped in iniquity speaking lies you're no better than anybody else but Grace came your way Hallelujah go to the next slide it says here brother Bram speaking he says in the message Fellowship by Redemption he says well we through wrongdoings well we through wrongdoings are red through your sins though your sins be like Scarlet Red through the shed blood of the Lord Jesus God looking through there red through red looks white they shall be white like snow see not through your something else but through the blood the only place that he can Fellowship outside of there your own righteousness he'll you'll he'll never see it your good works he'll never know it until you come beneath the blood then he sees you as his own beloved son or his daughter period your salvation comes through the blood of Jesus Christ people still don't want to recognize that listen you people out in YouTube world you people people whoever are hearing this message Jesus Christ I don't care what faith what religion it's Jesus Christ he is the Lord and savior he was the one that came to this world he gave his own life to to to take your place because you're born in sin you're shaped in iniquity Jesus Christ is God God came and took your sin upon himself and he can only see you through you accepting that his blood was shed he died for you on the cross it's as simple as that other than that you're you're you're sin before God unless you accept the blood of Jesus red through red looks white so when God sees the the the sin and all the unbelief of your life but then sees it through the blood he sees you white as snow glory to God through bread is white no matter what you've done sinner sinner friend when God looks sees your confessed your sins as being wrong and God looks through the blood of the Lord Jesus he sees you White Snow White no matter what you've done hallelujah that's true salvation you need to recognize that before you can go on and and and see yourself in the word of God you'll never see yourself in the word of God God unless you've come to a place where you know that you're saved that you're washed that you're Justified that there's nothing that that that can hold you back from fulfilling the part of the word that you are amen praise God no matter what you've done he is looking through you through Christ's blood your redeemed precious thing God will never condemn you no more he can't condemn you am God is no Indian giver God is not going to save you today and lose you tomorrow oh well I did this and I did that I'm lost no you're not if you're a son or a daughter of God you will feel that prick in your heart we're going to look a little further here let's let's let's move on so by the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ now next slide let's read the scripture you need to see 2 Corinthians 5:21 for he he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him so God became sin God took on sin and took it to the Cross when he went to the Cross he took you with him to the Cross because you were identified in Christ so when he died you died when he nailed sin to the Cross he nailed your sin to the Cross there is no more sin there is no more condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus if you're in Christ Jesus there's no way that Satan can can can put condemnation on you but he does anyhow and a lot of us bow down to it but we're going to try and change that kind of stinking thinking amen praise God we need to look at some of these processes so understand that you become the very righteousness of God that that if there was any righteousness in God remember he thought his righteousness his righteousness was expressed in attribute form and you are the righteousness of God when you accept the blood of Christ and him going to the Cross so if you are the righteousness of Christ How can any unbelief take you it can't take you you can be temporarily deceived you can be temporarily uh held back you can backslide because of condemnation because the devil's trapped you into believing that you're something that you're not but if you're an attribute of God and you've you've got a revelation of that there's no way you could ever be deceived but let's look at these processes we need to take a look at some some of these thought processes in us that constantly hinder us from seeing the mirror of God's word and seeing God in our lives and how we are reflecting Christ in this day and in this hour amen we need to look at these human thought patterns that need to be exposed and cast out now young people listen up number one there's this thought pattern that I must be loved or approved by virtually everyone that I know people want to be loved people want to be people want approval people want to know that that that that that they're pleasing everybody so that they can be loved by everybody that's not the way it works there's black and then there's white there's belief and there's unbelief unbelief has no fellowship with belief it's as simple as that although we're living in a world where we're surrounded completely surrounded by by unbelief and and and faith we don't have to bow down to that and allow that thought process to control us because if there's ever been a day where where deception is being advertised and being promoted through through media and through your iPhones and your iPads and your computers you're constantly being bombarded with with how to fit in and how and you must look and how listen listen listen here it says if we're living to make sure that others love us we give them the permission we're giving them the very permission to evaluate us and tell us how we are and how we should be no that's not the way it should be amen we give the people the power to determine our selfworth you mean you're going to allow somebody that's that that that does you know a a Tik Tock or whatever they call it uh and and every day they're they're showing you the way that you got to put on your makeup and they got a Blog and they got 500,000 followers and because they got 500,000 followers they must know how I should put on my makeup every day and how I should make myself so that I can look the best that I can be because if I don't look the best that I can possibly be then I'm not going to be accepted I'm not going to be loved you need to be who God made you you need to know that you are in particular a special person a special individual in the mind of God and God made you exactly the way that you are so that you could fulfill the word of God in your day Hallelujah many of us are so concerned about being loved that we give up now watch now listen to you young people you give into the opposite sex because you're a woman and you want you want a man or you're a man and you're looking for a woman and you start to give up your own identity you start to put on things that you are not you start to show likes and dislikes that are not really your likes and dislikes but because you want to be accepted you start to emulate those things I'm speaking to somebody here tonight Hallelujah and you're letting them evaluate your selfworth by you by you uh uh you know sacrificing your own identity so that you can get attention and acceptance from your friends no even to the extent of pretending that you're not as smart because your friends are maybe not as smart and you're a lot smarter than them and so you start acting dumb like you know listen I'm thinking about my my my my teenage years these things started to flash back you know I always knew that I was different but yet when I was with my teenage friends at 18 19 20 years old Macho this Macho that everybody wanted to be Mr this that and you know wanted to catch all the attention of the girls and the girls wanted to catch the attention of the boys you would see them at school and then you would see them at the at the Disco Tech and they were two different people because they were trying to show that they were something else so that they could be identified and so that they could be noticed God made you special you need to be exactly what God made you to be h Hallelujah glory to God pretending not to be bright or kind because we think the opposite sex won't be impressed you know men got to put on Macho they got to show that they're that they're tough so they're so so so they act mean around other people down to earth stuff no or we might deny ourselves food we might deny ourselves because we want to we want to look so thin we want to we want to deny ourselves food we want to and then all of a sudden you know you you you start to become bulimic you start to become anorexic you start to find yourself in a situation and a condition that you wish you never went down that road because now Satan's got you trapped all because you're not identifying yourself with the word and you're allowing the world to identify you I want to look like those bodybuilders in the magazines so I'm going to go to the gym and I'm going to start doing just like the bodybuilders do and I'm going to become Mr Macho I'm gonna go there with my bikini on and I'm gonna look just like uh Mr Hollywood these are the kind of deceptions that are out there and they're attacking our young people and we need to let them know that no God didn't make you that way God made you special and he set you aside for his service and for his purpose and for his glory and you're going to be glad when the Great Tribulation strikes the earth and the Rapture takes place and you've been you've been spared all of the destruction that's coming down upon the Earth don't tell me you can't see it out there it started it started this didn't just start you know uh last two weeks ago this has been going on for many many many years everything is is surrounding Israel it's always been surrounding Israel go back into the history you'll see that it's all surrounding uh Israel and it will eventually climax into a World War II it's going to happen according to the word of God not because I said it but because the word says clearly there'll be a World War I and there was it said there' be a World War Two and there was it says there'll be a World War II and it's coming God sent us a prophet that saw by Vision everything that was going to happen even before World War I brother brandham had visions of exactly who was going to be leading World War II and who uh Hitler was and even named him before he came on the scene that's what God can do God did that for you so that God could vindicate that William brandham was not just some man shooting off his own ideas and his own prophecies and saying thus sayeth the Lord for for for just to get people to follow him no sir he was a Vindicated prophet of God God confirmed that the supernatural was around his life and the things that he said they came to pass there's people that will say yeah but he said this and that didn't come to pass he said this and and that didn't come to pass it might have not come to pass according to the way you see it but God has his own way of interpreting the word of God and God is his own interpreter and you're not the one that's going to interpret the word you're going to fulfill the word hallelujah and so you know if we are living to make sure that others love us we give people the power to determine our selfworth no sir this is not a son or a daughter of God this is not how they see themselves in the word of God Amen and even within the church even within our church Community we start to take on certain stereotypes we start to look at oh well this is the way a woman should be and this is the only way that she should dress and this is exactly how she should do her hair and this is and we start stereotyping everything and you become like a clone or a robot and you start identifying yourself as a stereotype in the message of the hour and you actually neglect your position and your gift and your purpose in the word of God when you start focusing in that area you're missing your part because you're trying to uh put on the message culture this is not message culture this is you and Christ this is you personal every young person in here needs to be birthed and Born Again by the word of God and receive divine revelation of who they are in the word of God otherwise they don't go in the Rapture it's as simple as that the Rapture is a revelation and if you're receiving revelation of who you are progressive revelation will change your mortal body you'll be in the channel of that Revelation and it will complete what has started he is the author and he is the finisher of our faith he's going to finish what he started in your life amen praise God he's not going to just half do it he's going to fully do it and so you can know that you can assuredly be constantly under change you'll be constantly being changed you'll be constantly uh being corrected as a son or a daughter of God you'll find yourself trying to line up with the word of God Amen praise God Allelujah our identif our identity is in Christ Jesus Ephesians chapter 1 says we are joint HS in in Christ so you're an heir in Christ that means your name was written in the will in the in the last final will the Lamb's Book of Life your name was written in there you're an heir in that book and there's nothing that can ever change that it says in First Peter 1:4 it says to an inheritance that's Incorruptible you cannot corrupt it this Mortal cannot uh be because it becomes Immortal or because it starts to break down and starts to lose its its its Youth and starts to get weak that doesn't change your position in Christ that doesn't change who you are that can never change your position your your your inheritance in the in the word of God Amen all that you are you will be there's nothing that's going to change that glory to God it says here Incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away you can't do anything to try and get rid of it amen you're just going to be changed you're just going to be changed that's the that's the that's the final uh stage of it you're just going to be changed you're going to put on immortality because this Mortal cannot be dissolved God is going to change it Hallelujah glory to God and it's reserved in heaven for you read it first Peter 1 verse 4 Glory now we're going to be going a lot deeper into that as we move through this series you're going to see things that that that that are going to encourage you that are going to give you confidence in your in your position in Christ that's going to make you more zealous about being in the house of the Lord if the Holy Ghost really awakens in you there's nothing that can keep you from the house of the Lord you can't wait to get into those into that place with God to know that the supernatural word of God is going to speak to my need it's going to change my life it's going to call me into my position it's going to give me overcoming power it's going to give me the ability to overcome at work it's going to give me the overcoming power and the Revelation to become financially independent God can do all those things you are missing out you are underprivileged you are missing out when you miss coming into the presence of the Lord to receive the word of God and I hope that if you're missing it in in in coming in church you're you're tuned in on YouTube and you're tuned in to the live channel so that you can receive what God has for you because he's releasing a word in this day in this hour in October the 25th 2023 there's a release of super superatural faith and Revelation that's coming into the bride of Christ that receives this word that believes this word that knows that it's a reality God is doing something right now it's it's called the progression of Revelation and you can't miss it when you're tuned into it amen praise God hallelujah glory to God let's look at the next thing number two my past history is an determiner of my present behavior and because something once affected my life in the past that's just who I am I hear people say that I say I hear people say listen brother that's just the way God you know that's just the way you know H I am I'm I'm miserable a lot of the times I gossip I talk about others that's because when I was at home I heard my mom and my dad they were always talking about somebody so I talk about people you see that's a spirit that's a demon that's unbelief that's not who you are you're an overcomer you your your your your your your old life should be left in the past there are certain aspects of your your your environment and your upbringing that are positive and those are the things that you need to accentuate those are the aspects that you need to allow to stay in your life I'm I'm a hard worker because I watched my mom and dad they worked hard all their life so I work and I work too much but hey I'd rather be caught working too much than doing nothing nothing for the Lord and so so there's certain aspects of your character that God developed you in that way because he needs those parts in the body of Christ but he doesn't need backbiting gossiping and and uh uh two-faced UN unbelievers in the house of the Lord he doesn't need that at all Hallelujah so we allow that you feel controlled by something from the past a SE secret that only you know about and rightfully so some things some things should never be expressed except before God because there's things in your past and things that you might have done that that you know that that the devil keeps bringing it up on you some kind of behavior some secret sin something that you just you you know you you you just feel condemned all all the time but God made a way for you to confess that sin and be set free when you receive this message when you receive this message you you have no right going back to those areas and if you do it's because you were trapped by a certain thought process in your mind that said well this this happened to me when I was young that happened to me I got exposed to pornography I got exposed to this I got Expose and and all of those things now they're they're controlling me no you've been birthed by the word of God God there's an overcomer in you greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world you will overcome by the word of God that is in your mouth and you will speak that word and you will tell that enemy you have no right over me and God will deliver you it's as simple as that God didn't trap you and leave you trapped God has made a way for you to escape he will never never allow anything more to come into your life and stay in your life God has made a way for you out of that situation amen glory to God hallelujah perhaps you feel ashamed about certain aspects of your family you grew up in or maybe you have sinful habits you're embarrassed about you know gossiping and all these things maybe you're ashamed of some things that you've done in the past or maybe something that happened to you or that you've done to somebody else you need to come to Christ you need to come to the blood you need to get you need to be cleansed and purged so that God can move you into your position Hallelujah you've got an important part and it's important to identify you know when when when you're feeling these these these Spirits uh or these feelings of condemnation or or what what are they now let's look at it it's important to identify whether our feelings in these situations these these uh destructive uh uh memories whether they're they destructive shame or healthy conviction because if you're if you're ashamed of the things that you do then you should feel convicted because you know that you're doing it and that's and that's and that's uh something that you can immediately do something to change that behavior you should immediately be doing things to change that that type of behavior then there's healthy conviction healthy conviction always separates our identity from our Behavior shame links these two so wrong behaviors taint our image of ourself healthy convictions alert us to the fact that we have done something that goes against our are internalized values so when you're being healthy convicted in your heart that's a good thing it's like Christ it's like a Biblical conviction is a god-given emotion when you look into the word of God and the word of God tells you that this is not right that's not right this is the way that that that a son or a daughter of God should act and behave those are biblical convictions which we need to recognize and that comes right here in the house of the Lord when you assemble yourself and receive the word of God and and get the correction that you need so that you can be set free hallelujah praise God healthy conviction praise God it Spurs us to confess our sin and experience the Forgiveness of Christ glory to God Amen it provides us an opportunity where we can recognize first John 1 to9 tells us if we confess our sins God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us he cleanses us from all unrighteousness remember you are the righteousness of God you are the righteousness of Christ but you're living in this human realm and in this human body that is constantly sinning you're going to sin a thousand times a day you're going to think things in your mind about your brother and your sister that you don't want to think and you're going to struggle with those thoughts you're going to struggle with them but that's the enemy trying to get you to to to accept those things speak those things and then manifest it into gossip or talking about one or or the other and all of a sudden you've just you've just put out an evil report and you're going to have to be accountable for that because it's going to come right back back and slap you right in the back of the head it's as simple as that you think listen God is perfecting this church God wants to get you cleaned up so that you can get into your position and be effective in the body of Christ but he needs to clean up your attitude he needs to get rid of those negative attitudes and those negative uh uh dispositions those those those cold Spirits you know oh they don't come to meet say hello I ain't saying hello to them demons from the pits of Hell try to come into your mind and yet if you're recognizing that you're expressing a cold Spirit shame on you why would you express a cold spirit in the house of the Lord where he says that you are in Christ and in love and love conquers all things and if you project love into any situation God's grace will take over and you will experience the love of God and not only will your sister or your brother be free you'll be free you're in bondage because of your own mental attitude period you are responsible for your own attitudes you are responsible for being and expressing and showing your you want friends what's the Bible says about wanting friends Show Yourself friendly thank you brother Bill Show Yourself friendly not miserable you should have a smile on your face you want to learn watch brother Desmond he greets he smiles he's he's expressing the joy of the Lord God has put that into the body of Christ for a purpose you want to emulate certain things emulate those things think on those things that are good think on those things that are pure think about how the body of Christ gets affected I was reading that today how brother Brandon was it's right in the Christ the mystery of God revealed how God how brother brm was speaking about how the devil is going to come in and he's going to inject somebody with a wrong spirit and he's going to try to pull you away and he's going to try to get you to separate from one another he that's one of Satan's greatest Avenues of breaking up a church or bringing unbelief or you you know breaking the unity in the church starts to inject somebody with a miserable spirit and they're miserable all the time they don't want to show themselves that the that the joy of the Lord is actually their strength they're showing their weakness they're showing absolute weakness when they're expressing that kind of an attitude they don't realize it but it can change you don't have to be stuck under those thought patterns anymore you don't have to be controlled by those thought patterns anymore you can live liberate ated and free and you can experience the love of God that comes into the midst of our fellowship when we have that same like Precious faith in the unity of the spirit and we come together under that kind of Liberty hallelujah praise God forever more biblical conviction is a god-given emotion that red flags of behavior and tells us it is an act of rebellion against God when you're doing those things and when you're expressing those attitudes you are rebelling against God because you identify yourself as being in the body of Christ and you're going to have that kind of an attitude that does not express Christ that does not edify me I'm looking for edification we're going to be looking at things as we go into this series we're going to wind it right down now that that you're going to be looking at how each each joint we're going to be looking at scripture how each joint it nourishes each joint regardless of where that joint is it could be the the the the the cleaner the the the the one that that vacuums brother Eugene right here in the sanctuary that's vacuuming consistently every Sunday that is a joint that nourishes the the the body of Jesus Christ and it brings him into the perfect Unity of the faith when he's doing it by faith not because he's angry ah these people are throwing their garbage on the floor all the time I'm the only one that does this over here that does not no I don't see that that's not the kind of attitude that's going to edify the body of Christ when we get to the other side there's no difference between you me and anybody else we're just positioned in a certain way for the purpose of God and for God's glory you can't be what I am I can't be what you are because God made you to be who you are and God made me to be who I am Hallelujah and so for us to move to our full potential we need to break through these these foundational uh uh patterns mental oppressions and mental destructions and great battles that we have to deal with in our minds over and over and over again amen praise God I'm gonna move quickly here we're going to finish this up it says here that I got to be thoroughly now this is another lie of the enemy that I got to be thoroughly perfect adequate and and and and everything that I do I got to do it just perfect so that everybody can love me and and and and think that I'm worth anything that's not the way it works God didn't make you perfect in everything God made a perfect heart but he made the heart different from the liver the liver operates and does things that the heart doesn't do without the heart the liver doesn't work without the without the liver the heart stops to pump and dies everything is connected and everything has a part and a placing in the word of God Amen but you're not perfect and what happens is you get caught into this other pandemic that we're dealing with right now because you're you're you're you're placing an expectation upon your life on things that you think that you should be doing you're not adequately equipped to do it but you think that you have to do it and what does it do it throws you into depression you know that depression is a big huge pandemic out there right now it's that it's attacking our young people like never before their teen suicide like never before because they think that they got to be a certain way and because they're not that perfect they don't have that perfect nose they don't have those perfect ears they don't have that thick hair they don't have those perfect eyelashes and so they start to look at themselves and they they they start to make themselves and to try to uh uh make themselves something that they're absolutely not they're trying to make themselves perfect and before you know it they fall into a depression an oppression it's mental attacks of the enemy to try to make you something that you are not be who you are brother Glenn don't look to be anything else don't don't look at what other people uh uh how the other people react around you to determine that they like me or they don't like me if you're showing yourself friendly and you're showing the love of God and you have no motive other than Christ to to to do something good for your brother and your sister and that motive is there then don't worry God's got to deal with them not you but if you start to fall into the Trap of you start talking about it you start getting bitter you start getting rebellious you start getting angry you're just as bad as they are that's why Jesus said if they slap you on this cheek turn the other why was he saying that so that you wouldn't want to immediately slap back you want to react in such a way that when that one slaps you again he's thinking holy smokes there was no reaction I need to be like that I need that kind of a character God's looking for character Hallelujah and so when we start to express Grace and we start to extend Grace God's grace then God's grace comes back on us that's why we hear project love and grace takes over because it comes back on you love comes right back to you amen glory to God hallelujah 1 Corinthians 12:27 now I'm going to end with this I got more here but maybe we'll start out with what I've got here I don't want to get into what I've got here because it's good and I I want to cover it thoroughly so uh I'm GNA end with this God made you to be you God did not make you to be anybody else in in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 let the musicians come in 1 Corinthians 12: 27 it says now ye are are the body of Christ and members in particular we're going to be looking at that you are particular nobody can be like you sister elain I don't care what anybody says nobody can be like you sister Rosemary nobody can be like you Sister Mary brother coffee brother Bill nobody can be like you you just need to be you and if you you be you then I can be me I can express all that I am you can express all that you are because you are a member in the body of Christ in particular you have a unique position in Christ and when you operate in that position and you do it with the love of God and by faith it edifies it blesses it prospers it anoints it wants people to be like you to have the same kind of character to show that kind of love to be that kind of a person and all of a sudden God starts to add to the church God starts to build on the church because now he sees that his people have the character they don't have the wrong attitude they don't look at uh uh uh just me I I'm the only one that God has called listen God is still calling God can call your brothers your sisters your mother your father your friends at work your boss whoever is out there this is God's calling this is not your own calling this is not something that you do all you do is you live hallelujah praise God hallelujah thank you Jesus too much there's so much that we can look at praise God God bless you brother Anthony lead us in in a in a song and let's let the people go home praise God I trust that something spoke to your heart tonight and that something something will trigger you to be set free from the past so that you can move on to the Future in the body of Christ God
