our first time back since uh being back from vacation sister Jennifer and I uh had a nice uh vacation away in Cuba the Lord allowed US 10 days there it was originally scheduled for seven and you know I was there you know telling sister Jennifer on the Saturday before we were leaving we were supposed to leave on the Monday morning and I was saying man I just need a few more days you know I'm enjoying these walks on the beach and just you know just listening to the ocean and just absorbing um the the the sand and everything it was just it's wonderful I love being on the beach and walking and listening to the ocean and I was in the water every day I just I I guess I'm a Pisces so I guess I must have you know uh a bit of a fish I love eating fish and I love swimming with the fish but praise God we had a wonderful time we thank God and then it got extended for an extra three days because of the terrible storm I'm sorry you had to endure such a terrible storm well we had 10 perfect days of weather uh the food was amazing everything was the grace of God and uh you know we just thank God for the rest amen but we're glad to be back we're excited about what God is doing we never disconnect from the word even when we're on vacation ever we're constantly we are the word and we're looking and we're looking at people and we see the people and we see how they're they're living and and and uh you know what without being aware of the word um when you see people there and they're having their vacations it's as good as it's going to get because the world is not going to get better amen and we can see it even now things are falling apart by the hour never mind from year to year it's by the hour now with the situations that are taking place amen praise God but um you know it's just the grace of God that uh we've been given the eyes to see and to recognize prophecy in our day and the ability to see the things that that that the Lord is doing amen so praise God also notice that uh you know Sunday school rooms have been painted I noticed my office got repainted I just want to thank each and everyone that's participating in doing that I know Brother Brad has been behind the scenes here coming in uh I know that brother Derek and his lovely wife sister Joy have been coming and dedicating their time and uh sister Tina sister Amanda uh listen God bless you for the for the time that you put into the house of the Lord you can expect a h hundredfold God doesn't owe anybody and you know you cleaners you all of you you that are doing your part in this in this ministry in this place I want you to know that when whenever you do whenever you move that vacuum brother Eugene whenever you're there sister Elizabeth and and all you know who you all are praise God brother Kofi and many sisters and brothers that are there that are that are doing every time you put a moment of time into the service of the Lord willingly in Leviticus it said let them bring their gifts willingly before the Tabernacle of the Lord and I will receive their sacrifice amen God will receive it God will bless you God will uh Prosper you in areas that you would have never have imagined so God bless you and thank you we of the leadership appreciate and each and everyone that's seated here that sits in these pews and is able to go to clean bathrooms and and clean floors we appreciate it thank you [Applause] amen praise God forever more and so um as we go to the word uh we certainly want to remember brother Christopher amen that the Lord will continue to heal his body I believe he is going to be better than he was before amen I trust that the faith is pouring into him daily amen that that that he's going to be stronger than he was praise God and and pray for sister farita that she'll be there to assist him and to be available for him whenever he needs her amen so we just want to continue to pray uh let's believe for sister Sheila elanga the Lord will continue to strengthen her and uh meet her needs uh there's there's many pray for brother Tim continue to pray for his health that the Lord I believe he's I believe he's turned a big corner I believe that that uh he can expect Absolute Total healing in his body amen complete and total Deliverance in every area praise God uh so let's continue to pray because this is our body amen amen when one is is uh is hurting then we're all hurting when one is rejoicing we're all rejoicing this is the unity of the body of Jesus Christ this is what brings the body into perfect faith when listen if there's any Division if there's any separation if there's Satan will try to bring separation divide break why so that he can break the strength of the body all it takes is one bug one flu bug or one uh virus to enter into your body and what happens you start to get weak you don't have the strength you don't feel motivated you you lose your confidence you start to pull back instead of of pushing forward amen praise God but God has a people that believe that what God has started in their lives he's going to finish that work I'm not interested in hearing people's oh you know you hear some people say I you know I'd rather the Lord just take me just take me that I I can't I can't I can't stand next to something like that I need I need to see that there's a confidence and a faith in the word of God that brother let's let's press on let's fight let's let's overcome this enemy because there's Victory there's Victory and and listen Victory is only sweet after a battle so there needs to be a battle there needs to be a fight there needs to be uh uh you know and and I want if I'm going to the listen if we're going to go to war in any way shape or form and when I'm talking about what am I talking about God is not sending us into the tribulation our war is now we are fighting against powers and principalities and that one specific demon by the name of Satan and all of his angels to try and get you to disbelieve the word of God Amen that's his job but we're not going to let him do that he can't do that because Jesus said I'll be with you even in you praise God you got me preaching already glory to God let's all stand and let's pray how many has a need that they want to say Lord I'm I'm in the battle I need your strength I'm going to join together with my brothers and sisters I'm going to unite in the unity of the faith and we're going to overcome whatever it is for my brother for my sister amen father we are so grateful for All These uplifted Hands of Faith Lord to know who they are to to recognize that they are a part of the army of the Living God in this hour Lord to overcome every sickness every oppression of the enemy every doubt he might try to take away our jobs he might try to take away our health he might try to take away the relationships with our loved ones he might try but God you are greater than all those things and Lord we are standing upon your word we will not side with unbelief we will side with the word of God and the word of God will prevail in every uplifted hand this morning Lord those that are online those that are believing for a for a a supernatural will change in their lives it might be a job it might be a financial need it might be a a health issue Lord whatever it is Father Lord vindicate your word this morning Lord me as a man I I'm I'm a failure Lord as as men we fail to try and bring your word and to try but Lord with your spirit and your anointing upon us which is what we believe in this day and in this hour all things are possible and so may you take everything under your Divine control as we Commit This service and everything completely now into your hands in Jesus name amen and amen praise God um I'm G to read I'm going to read one scripture quickly um and then and then you may be seated let's go to our uh okay just give me one second here I'm going to go to the scripture and then we're going to I'm going to make some comments on current events amen praise God um but uh in Romans chapter 9 verses 6 to9 it says not as though the word of God hath taken none effect for they are not all Israel which are of Israel neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called that is now pay attention they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God pay attention Okay but the children of the promise are counted for the seed Not seeds the seed prophesying speaking about the coming of the Lord amen for This Is The Word of Promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son you may be seated we are going to continue um where we left off uh last time that we ministered back in early February um but before that I just want to make a few comments go uh how many recognized and and know that um on Friday uh it was February the 28th 2025 and that um you can put up that that slide um that you know it was it was a a a planetary alignment that was taking place and now I'm not going to get into you know I'm just these are just opening comments on observations because we've been given the spirit of of God the Holy Ghost which will show you things to come amen and so we've been given the ability to recognize signs and wonders the signs that God places in the heavens these are not things that that that we need to convince us to believe the word of God we've already been enlightened by the holy Spirit we already know that back in 1963 we had a visitation amen of of a supernatural uh uh constellation of angels that that came down to meet with William Mariam Branham who was fulfilling scripture and this took place on February the 28th 1963 here we have a planetary alignment 62 years later amen men 62 years later here now we have this this planetary alignment now what does it say to me and what should it be saying to you is that God always has a purpose in everything that he does and we know that the first Bible that was ever written was written in the heavens and he declares it first in the heavens and then he brings it to pass upon the earth now I'm not going to get into all these seven planets that all lined up from ver from the Virgin all the way to Leo the Lion we could get into all of those types and shadows because it's all there there's a complete study and teaching on all of the of the astronomy and and God's first Bible that was written in the heavens right from Genesis to revelation God is is Elohim he's the self-existent one he can declare himself in any way that he wants amen but I want you to notice these are some observations that I that I noticed and in Revelations I want you to notice here 62 years later so I noticed because God's numerology is perfect too so I took six and two and I add them together and it's eight and I said well the thought came to me Revelations chapter 8 Revelations 8 verse1 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of a half hour and we know that when he came in 1963 I'm talking about the coming coming of the Lord that was the second hello the second coming of the lord they're all waiting on the coming of the Lord they haven't recognized that he's already come he's already here amen and he came to open the mysteries of those Seven Seals and when we see a seven planetary alignment it just reminds us of God's perfect numbers and what he did back in 1963 on the same day February the 2 8 he opened the mysteries of his word it was the coming of the Lord to come and unveil themselves so signs to the church that is uh you know that that's already awake it it it's it's it's it's nothing to us we're already aware we already know what God has done that's what produced this message that's what we're we're preaching on is the revelation of the opening of those Seven Seals right because it made the Bible a new book it unveiled Christ in the present stage of his ministry it brought him to the Earth and they're looking for him to come in the clouds and he already came there's the cloud right there he already came he showed himself and he declared the word he opened all the mysteries of the Bible for what purpose to show the mystery of his coming that it would be a mystery one would be taken one would be left one would be in the field one would be taken one in the bed the other one taken is because he's already called out he's already brought together his church I'm looking at it right here this is not the whole church he he's got a body worldwide that have come to recognize this event and if you go back and actually look into it people online that are listening in and you're not sure go back and prayerfully search and and read about William bram's Ministry it was a progression of the restoration of the churches Martin Luther broke away from the Catholic Church to bring justification John Wesley broke away it started all of the Presbyterian churches and all the the the the Methodist churches and then Pentecost came to the Earth to introduce the gifts of the holy spirit himself but then Christ himself through William branam H an Elijah uh uh Elijah come to introduce the second coming of the Lord Jesus just like the first Elijah John the Baptist introduced the first coming amen praise God you need to go back you need to study amen so we don't need the signs but we recognize the signs we identify with the signs and we need to let the people know of the message of the hour praise God that God has sent a prophet to restore the word and Christ now has come on the scene amen this is what we're going to be continuing to look at here so praise God but uh uh we are we are the sign now because we're the carrier of the word amen we're the ones that that that have recognized what God has done and now we're like the apostles that walked with Jesus they they had recognized the the the the coming of of the Messiah yes only a dozen had actually recognized it's always been that way that's why you try to tell people listen if you've been caught by like the Pharisees were back then they were all under the to all under their own Traditions they by their own Traditions have made the word of God of none effect to the people and that's why all the churches they've taken all their own doctrines and teachings we're going to look at all of that so we we recognize that we've got the Holy Spirit to see Vindicated prophecy just like we see what's going on politically listen we need to recognize that Donald Trump is a political figure that can be typed in the Bible I'm not making Donald Trump some spiritual individual he's a million miles from that he'd have to be born again declaring the message of the hour before I'd even even potentially say okay now we need to get into some fellowship with this guy and see if he's really broken into the revelation of Christ in this hour it would have to go that far but I want you to recognize God raises up Kings and God brings them down and all of the political uh uh field and all the nations and everything that's going on around us open your eyes don't be blinded to to uh uh to the emotional aspects like the like the people in the world listen I don't vote I'm telling you right now I voted for Jesus I don't go to vote for for conservative I don't go to V vote for Liberal they're both in the same pot right they just have two different views of unbelief because they do not recognize Jesus Christ in the present stage of his ministry if they did they'd come out of that political system and they'd want to join into the government that that is going to be upon his shoulders amen praise God but Trump is is you know he can be um typed like like like King Cyrus back in in the Old Testament in that you know God uh laid upon King Cyrus the decree to to to restore the house of the Lord Lord back to to to Israel and he did this and it was after 70 years it was the prophecy of Jeremiah that he said that after 70 years God would restore and God used Osiris who was a pagan he was not he was Gentile he was not uh of Israel he was a pagan just like Trump is a pagan he can he can declare to be a Christian but like 98 99% of the Christian out there if they're not willing to accept the word of God in in Simplicity in the simplest way of saying how are you have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and they said well what do what do you mean you need to repent be baptized in water knowing what you are doing repenting from the sin that you know that you're a sinner not by being baptized as a baby and this and that and to reject that just goes to show the very essence that they don't don't believe or come under submission to the word of God but listen Trump for example he he he like if if you go back and just just a few things that I picked up okay we were told to watch Israel and we know that Israel came back into her Homeland in 1948 she was declared a nation in 1947 by 48 she had uh uh taken back her Homeland and then she had to fight some some more Wars and in 1967 they had to fight to to to keep their their existence again because they were surrounded and we know the Six Day War God intervened again well 50 years later which in the in the scriptures is a jubilee according to Israel and according to the scriptures in Leviticus they were to they uh president Trump was elected in 2016 to become the 45th president president of the United States of America and it was in 2017 exactly 50 years later that Trump was anointed to to declare Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and this was done and you think okay so here now I want you to pay attention here Trump you think that that he was uh looking back into the scriptures into the book of Ezra and saying hey you know what I need to get into my position and I need to become president in 2016 so that in 2017 I can be sworn in as the president and so that at the end of 2017 because it was on December I believe December the 6th that President Trump uh declared Israel the capital and even Netanyahu himself declared and said that we do not forget the decree of King Cyrus in that he he would restore and give back Israel their their their their promise and and even even himself said this man is like a king Cyrus and do you know that Trump was exactly 70 years old when he was sworn into office 70 years was the prophecy and here this man at 70 years old is there in Israel swearing in the Pro uh swearing in and making the decree that that Jerusalem is after so many thousands of years Saints I'm not saying Trump is anything special he is an actor in The Prophecy of the kings of this Earth and even Cyrus if you go back and read it in Cyrus in Ezra chapter 1 he said the Lord hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth it's like Trump he feels like he King of the Earth right now he can declare and say whatever it is that he wants it's going to be this listen like you heard I don't know if you watched what you know that that that that that thing that took place in the Oval Office with uh with the the the the the president of uh Ukraine and and the way that you're not he you could see he was he was like you could see you know you're not you don't have you don't hold the cards my friend I hold the cards you're not in a position to say anything you know declaring himself like a like a king amen so there's an anointing and God is going to need these Kings God is going to need these individuals to be placed into these PL positions he he was Trump was born in 1946 and you would wonder like well you mean God God knows the day you were born and God knows the day you're going to leave this earth he uses what he wants to use just like he rose up uh Nebuchadnezzar Amen to to bring the children of Israel into bondage because of their unbelief God can use who he wants scripturally to do what he wants when he wants amen amen you believe that amen so don't have your have your your your spiritual eyes and your prophetic haton to recognize the events that are taking place around us and realize that we are in the midst of Prophecy being fulfilled right before our very eyes and blessed are your eyes for unto you it has been given to know these Mysteries that are unveiling themselves right before us amen praise God glory to God Amen so let's uh now uh continue i w to I want to do a very quick review of where I left off back on on uh February II it's been almost it's been exactly one month and so we we were looking at the Word of Promise and we saw here from the scripture that we read um that you know that it that that it's the Word of Promise that's what we've recognized amen and so let's let's move along here we read the scripture I want to read a quote here now the first quote if you want to bring it up it's the seed shall not be air with the Shu a lot of what I'm bringing here if you get a chance go back and listen to this message it's it it really if you go back after listening to you know to the ministry you're you're going to be able to see things that you may have not seen before amen for those of you that have well praise God it'll just the Lord will just add a little more to it because the minute you think you've seen it and you've seen it all guess what God does something new he does it over and over again he says now he says now that's what the church is doing today for Jesus is the word and he is the bridegroom and the Bride is a part of the groom therefore the word that is to be fulfilled this day is the same part of the word that was fulfilled in his day now remember the promise uh that that uh Sarah shall bring forth a son it wasn't actually the son Isaac that was that was the natural fulfillment of the promise of the word but the seed that he was talking about the one that was going to to to uh to fulfill the Plan of Redemption because remember God had that in the back part of his mind and it's always been reflected in every type in Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the way down through the types are constantly there Joseph everything showing a type of Jesus Christ and him coming into his fulfillment into fulfilling the Plan of Redemption and so for when God separated Adam he was both we find out Adam was Spirit to begin with he made man in his own image created he male and female and then Genesis 2 and on he created man Out of the Dust of the earth Man was created in God's image God is a spirit so he's a Spirit man then when he became flesh man animal Flesh on the earth he is showing portraying here the bride the whole purpose of the coming of the Lord to coming to the Earth was for the purpose of bringing the fullness of himself back again remember in the beginning Adam and Eve it was just Adam he called their name Adam so So Adam and Eve was in the spirit man which was God which was Elohim the fullness of God and that's what he is restoring in this hour then when he became flesh man and he is showing portraying here the bride he never taken and made another being but he took part of Adam so if you are the church in this day you are the second Adam you are Christ in Bride form you're the woman that he came to restore amen praise God Adam's already been restored when Christ came now he's restoring Eve back to her original position a church withouts spot a wrinkle that's why this that's why it's all you know you hear about people thousands of people are going to church declaring that they are the bride of Christ but God is going to interpret and declare himself who bride is just like when Jesus Christ came to the Earth all the churches of that day they were they were putting their own interpretation to the point where they when Christ the Messiah himself came the word was made flesh they called him a devil they're doing the same thing today amen and he is showing here the bride so he never taken and made another being but he took part of Adam the original creation took from him a rib from his side and took the feminist Spirit out of Adam to produce Eve amen praise God therefore part of his Spirit part of his body flesh of his flesh bone of his bone word of his word life of his life and that's the bride and and that's the way the bride is to Christ we are bone of his bone FES you walking on this Earth under the anointing of the Holy Spirit that you've received the Holy Ghost you know that you know that you've received it according to the word you know that you've your your experience identifies with the word of God when somebody says to you have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe you say yes praise God I've received the Holy Ghost I was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit In Me has led me to the message of the hour Jesus said when the Holy Ghost has come upon you it will guide guide you into all truth it'll bring you to the truth not to a lie it's not going to bring you to a church that's going to tell you oh be baptized in the name of the father and of the son and they'll sprinkle some water on you no he's going to bring you exactly according to his word because he is the word and if the word is in you it's only going to identify back to the word it'll never go contrary that's what he's looking for in this hour We're we're going to continue in Galatians 4 chapter uh 4 verse uh 28 to 31 we read here now we Brethren as Isaac was are the children of promise okay now this is Paul speaking he's talking about the children of Promise he's not talking about the children of the natural seed there's going to be a natural and the natural seed is is at emnity with the spiritual seed this is what you're going to find out but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirits even so is it now you see what Paul is saying here there's going to be a struggle when it comes right down to it right at the very end we heard our pastor talking about it last week our former Pastor John Simon if you haven't heard that message go back listen to it it's it's it just lines perfectly up with everything that the holy spirit is doing there's a separation that's taking place and and the spirit in the natural will never see eye to eye that's why you'll struggle in your flesh nevertheless it said here born after the persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so is it now nevertheless what sayith the scripture cast cast out the Bond woman and her son for the son of the Bond woman shall not be air with the son of the free woman so then brethren we are not children of the Bond woman but of The Free We Are The Promised word We Are The Word of Promise that was going to bring forth A church not by natural man's teachings and and and and doctrines and and and denomination it would come come forth by a supernatural spoken word that would come just like that day when I went into Gabriel's uh furniture place there I had no idea that when he would say are you a Christian he didn't realize what was writing those words at that moment the spirit of God was speaking a a different language and it and it quickened something within my soul like you when you first heard the word of God that that that made perfect sense to you and you said wait a minute here why why am I seeing this why why am I seeing different here why all of a sudden has the scripture opened up to an understanding is because you were not natural Church you're the supernatural Church you're the one that's going to be called according to a to a supernatural spoken word it's going to awaken an attribute that was in you from before you come to this earth you weren't called back I wasn't called 30 years ago when I came to this message I was called before the foundations of the world I just needed to come in contact with the word with the with the with the uh the the the the male Christ he had to come and speak seed in and awaken that seed which was the female aspect of himself to come back to life to come back to an awareness of who we really are amen praise God and so uh let's let's move along here now from all of this I'm just going to read the notes that I had from last this type is being fulfilled in the church today this type of the Bond woman and the free woman you're going to struggle with this flesh you're going to struggle with those that don't have the Revelation you're going to struggle with your own families that are caught under traditions of of Church teachings and and and doctrines of man and and uh denominational teaching and Buddhism and New Age movement you're going to struggle with that because that's all natural that's all the natural they've all their teachings and all their their their Revelation comes by reading by by intellect by learning but God for the Sons and Daughters of God it's not learning it's revealing amen it's it's God revealing himself to you you can't know God no man comes Jesus himself says no man comes to the father but by me what was he saying there you're not going back to Elohim the self-existent one but by me who is the word for your day you need to recognize that I am he just like when he went to the woman at the well and he was telling her all about her life and then she says but wait a minute h a messiah would would do these things and he looked at her and he says I am he and at that moment that attribute that was in her awakened to herself who she actually was and her testimony just like your testimony has converted others to the word not converting them by convincing them no by by you being a channel to speak God's word into their soul and awake taken them to who they really are amen you don't become a Son of God you don't become a daughter of God you always were a son or a daughter of God but you awaken to your true identity amen and that means that that God's seed or word must be in Us in order for us to be awakened and then we don't live by knowledge we live by faith we feed on Revelation that's why we come to church brother Desmond I'm not here to listen to man put together quotes and read scriptures I I'm interested in what the holy spirit is saying through the word through the scripture through the quotes a revelation of what the prophet said not just speaking as a parrot and and saying what the prophet said to justify no there's a revelation behind every quote that we choose to read amen praise God and so uh it it becomes very clear here that the Lord was very clear in the scripture when he said the promised word would be the promised seed which was Christ he was talking about Christ the coming of the Lord that would be the Redemption the plan amen the promise of Salvation and that can never come by the law because Ishmael came as a result of unbelief let's Move Along here let's go now because of the original sin back in the Garden of Eden I want you to see that this unbelief and this sin continued all the way down right to this day that original sin back in the Garden of Eden where the Beast where where the serpent went and injected his his own word his own thoughts his own idea into Eve and brought forth Cain it brought forth a wild man it didn't bring forth of the seed of God Amen it was serpent seed that was the original sin and what did it do it placed a beastly nature upon every man and woman that would ever be born by sex and every individual that would ever come forth would come under this beastly nature and that beastly Nature has continued and moved down all the way down through right from Genesis all the way down into Leviticus all the way down into uh Exodus and and all the way like all through the scripture you will see these two lineages that have been operating constantly fighting one against the other amen one look Cain represented law Abel represented faith had a revelation of what God required and he brought the lamb and God accepted it because of Revelation Hagar she was a bonds woman representing the law brought forth all kinds of children because look at the children of the bondswoman are much more than the children of the free that's why Israel a small little Nation surrounded by 200 million Muslims which are the lineage of Ishmael am actually the lineage of Cain amen if you want to go right back to the beginning amen if you want to go even further back the lineage of Satan amen okay because it's it's a nature it's a nature why why why did Cain have the nature to go and kill his own brother what is that that same wild nature operates today I'm not saying that every Muslim is has a desire to kill and no I'm not saying that but if you go back and find the the the the seed The Original Seed and we know that that you know we're not going to get into all of it here but but Abraham was ishmael's father so the Muslim people they have a claim that Abraham is their father and they're right and God blessed Ishmael made him many Nation he says you're that it'll be a a great nation many people actually more than those of the free woman Sarah's Isaac's lineage but this is what it produced and so Sarah she represented the faith to believe God's word okay even though there was doubt originally she received Faith the Bible says in Hebrews 11 she received faith for strength to bring forth the promised word but she actually doubted in the beginning and that's why the natural seed is not the seed that's counted that that that God is the natural seed represents natural Israel out of natural Israel there will be 144,000 that will be brought forth will be born and and come forth out of out of the natural Israel their time is coming but first our time first the Gentile church first the Rapture then the tribulation then this then then then the 144,000 then the tribulation and everything else that goes on which leads us to the millennial Reign where we come back to rule for a thousand years of Peace but anyways Israel Jacob represented Faith Israel represented the law you'll see it all the way through Israel law Gentile free amen denomination denomination they don't realize it they've come under the law of doctrines of man's teachings their own ideas of teaching the word of God but faith is is the message of the hour that God sends a a prophet in the last days to restore the faith of the children back to the original faith of the word of God Amen praise God and so we've got this struggle that's constantly going on so let's let's continue now from where we left off and we're going to read the next scripture in Genesis 16 16 4-6 I want you to see certain things this is just laying it all in that's going to lead up to you know how we're going to finish this message today and he went in unto Hagar Genesis 16 and she conceived and when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes notice that when like Sarah goes and tells Abraham listen take my my bondswoman that was her unbelief she didn't believe the word of God that's why a lot of people today they still don't believe they want to they want to do things naturally they haven't entered and received the promise of the word which does everything supernaturally but notice that when Hagar had conceived all of a sudden Hagar because of the UN you know that Hagar was an Egyptian the Bible says she was an Egyptian she was she was a pagan but she was she was slave to Sarah and if Sarah said you go and be with my husband she had to obey but the moment she got pregnated by Abraham right away she started to despise Sarah and Sarah saw it see Sarah's unbelief brought brought forth trouble yeah amen and if you try to do anything naturally you try to circum circumvent God's plan for your life without coming God's provided way in the church allowing the Holy Spirit to operate through the proper offices the deacons the trustees and and the way of God providing your needs you want to go and do things on your own way you don't want to come under subjection to the word of God you're it's going to lead to trouble it's going to bring forth some wild situations in your life amen praise God and here now listen my wrong she realized I I I messed up here and she goes to her husband she says my wrong have I have given my maid unto thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived I was despised in she's telling Abraham this and the Lord judged between me and thee she was coming to confess I've messed up of but look at what Abraham says he says but Abraham said un Behold thy maid is in thy hand you do with her as you please you got yourself into this situation now you try to figure yourself a way to get out of this situation and this is what we will find ourselves in if we're not uh you know coming God God's provided way and allowing the Holy Spirit to just be still just be still and wait on God on the situations in your life I don't know what you're going through but just be patient wait on the Lord amen the Egyptians listen Sarah uh uh Hagar she was an Egyptian it was it it was the lineage of the midianites and they were constantly a thorn in the flesh of Israel they would constantly be causing trouble trouble they're a type of what we'll have to deal with as we walk with the Lord in dealing with all the unbelief of of of those that have accepted man's word instead of accepting God's word amen look even Moses was under the bondage of of a bondswoman when he was under the Egyptian rulership of his of of uh of of uh pontier or no not pontier um uh Pharaoh's uh sister amen and so we we see that uh you know but but but notice when Revelation came to Moses because in Hebrews 11: 24 it says by faith Moses when he come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter he came into a revelation just like you when you receive the word of God you come to realize wait a minute I'm not the son of of Dominic and Ida missil I'm not the son of so and so the daughter of so and so I'm a Son of God yes this flesh came through the procreative ability that was given to my parents to bring forth just like creation God said let every seed bring forth of its own kind and it brought forth this body but the person the attribute of God that's been awakened to recognize who he or she really is realizes that they are Sons and Daughters of God and they come under now the leadership of the word now look what Moses he said when he come to the years refused to call this to be called the son of pharaoh choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season look it says esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasure in Egypt in other words he was saying for he had respect under the recompense of the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the kings in other words Moses would rather get the reward from the Lord amen then the riches of Egypt he was born into Rich he he was brought up wealthy he he he was smart he was taught by the by the smartest teachers and everything else but when the attribute of God awakened within him he came to realize that he was no longer he he was not an Egyptian as a matter of fact he saw the the the things that they were doing and he went and took the life of an Egyptian he stood for what he believed he was not willing to submit himself to the to the riches of the world or the or the acceptance of the world over the reward that God has for each and every one of us if we stand for this word amen praise God hallelujah so Satan is is going to con constantly try to bring you under the under the control of the bondswoman constantly try to bring you under law try to make you believe this message of the hour by law it'll never work God is separating his people from under that kind of the children of the law will will will persecute Children of the spirit Children of the faith will always be persecuted you're going to be looked at well wait a minute what do you mean you you you you you don't you don't uh you don't fully submit to the prophet of William Mary and brandham are you kidding of course we do we recognize exactly what he did and who he is or who he was and who he represented in the word of God and what he did to introduce Christ to his church and then us back to the word back to Christ we need to rec recognize that we don't serve this message by law there's a lot of people that are under the law of this message and they're under constant condemnation thinking that oh if I don't do this right if I don't do that right they've made the law of the message how you dress they've made the law of the message the Cod book if you don't if you don't go exactly by what the prophet said in the Cod book and what he said about this and how he said it and everything else then then you're off the word they're making the absolute the prophet instead of making the word the absolute amen how do message Believers come into bondage by taking what the prophet said without Revelation that's true and making it a Doctrine or a tradition that's what's going on Saints we want to bring this home don't we we want to we want to be free we want to be completely aware of what this what Christ is trying to do in this hour amen and how he's doing it all of a sudden the Cod book becomes the catechism and the rule book beware you need a revelation of what the prophet said amen making the word personal you've got to make it personal when when you hear the word when you read the word when you hear the messages you are identifying by Revelation understanding what he meant in what he was saying but when we come to this message we come under the school master and it's rightfully so that when you first come in you know the the the the message there's a lot of laws that you know how to dress properly how a woman should dress and how a man should dress and and and you know how we act and and what we believe and how we stay pure to the word of God and how we honor the word in in every aspect amen and and we and we get like you know where we get a little bit you know under that law you can become a little bit starchy and you know but but this is not the hour for that this is where you could you get completely set free from the law the law has to be that bonds woman has to be completely kicked out the scripture said kick out the bonds woman there's Absolut absolutely no inheritance between the two none none whatsoever amen this is the school Master burning out all your paganism because a lot of you and we we came into this message we were full of pagan beliefs and teachings and understandings some of us were carrying a a a St Christopher over here every time we went for a [Laughter] drive you know all kinds of tradition s of of man you know having to do the rosary figuring you know if I can do this so many times a week I'm going to boy oh boy I'm going to be so much more blessed making the word of God by the traditions of man of absolutely none effect to the people to where they're putting their trust in their Works instead of putting it into the law of faith faith is the law law and in the law of Faith there is no law because he took the law of sin and he nailed it to the cross the scripture said he took it and nailed the law listen the law was only brought in because of the beastly nature that was on man as a result of the original sin and and because of that nature we were all like tribes we were all like like like wild beasts on the earth we would kill if if somebody would take something was all like tribal like animals you know animals they they they you know birds of a feather they flock together and animals will stay you know like a lion's den you never want to go into a lion's den the Lion's you know the the the the hunter go the huntress goes out brings back the the prey Everybody Eats anybody tries to come in some of those uh you know those Jackal and those wolves will try to come in they'll fight them off they'll kill them because it's a beastly nature and man was worse than the Beast and God had to bring some order into them and that's why the law had to come in but the law is not what God wants us to serve him by he wants us to be set free so that we can serve him because we love him because of grace and the love of God and what he has done for us amen praise God so we come under the bonds Woman by making the prophet the absolute instead of making the word the absolute and the message that that brought and and the message that he brought which message always pointed to Christ not to himself listen to The Prophet here in birth pains he says oh word Believers give in to my message hear me not not my message but his message do you hear that amen he says Hear Me Not my message Mage but his message that he firmly declares to be the truth you've got to choose from somewhere in other words you've got to recognize where truth is coming from you've got to choose how you're going to H how how the spirit of God is going to lead you into all truth how is it it's going to lead you to the message of Christ look what he says here you can sit still after this you've got to make your choice don't pay any attention to the messenger he's talking about himself here he says look at the message it is pay attention to what I'm saying the the word that's being spoken he says it isn't that don't notice this look he says little baldheaded you know person cuz it's just it's just a human being all and we're just all the same you see what he's saying here I'm not belittling the prophet by bringing you this quote I'm quoting the prophet I want you to understand that he had a revelation of who he was he knew listen you don't think he knew that he was Malachi 4 that he came to a place where he recognized that he was the the the angel that was to be on the earth to fulfill Revelations 10 1-7 when he said that that angel would be on the earth at that time when the second coming of the Lord would come and he was the Elijah that Jesus spoke about when he said Elias shall surely come and then notice what he said and Elias has already come it's because there's five comings of Elijah all the way to the very end he's going to come again when he comes with Moses to the children of Israel to the 144,000 to do what to preach this message Amen to preach that Jesus Christ the Messiah has already come and you missed him and then he's going to come and reveal himself to the 144,000 but you and I we're going to be gone for three and a half years for that meeting in the air and that's what this message today and what we feed on is producing in our lives faith for the Rapture Faith to to be taken out of here for these bodies to these mortal bodies to to to put on immortality it amen and he says so but but watch what's happening that's what declares it I was taken now I know people say all kinds of things and we know that a lot of it's not right he's talking about what the people were saying about him making him God making him more than what he was he wanted the people to to not take their eyes off of Christ the word that's what he was introducing when when those seals were being opened in 1963 he was introducing the coming of the Lord so that the attention of the people would now go to recognize that he was here now and why did William brandham have to go off the scene same reason that John the Baptist had to go off the scene people say oh why did God allow William Brenham to to be in a head-on collision that would end up taking his life well why did God allow Herod his wife to have John the Baptist head seared off and put on a platter and delivered at a feast we don't question how God does things you see those things people will take those things and they will immediately uh I can't believe a God that would allow something like that I I can't believe a God that would do this I can't you need to settle down and read the scriptures and understand the Plan of Redemption why is salvation needed you tell me is the world out there looking like it's getting better you got Wars you got thousands millions of people being killed in Wars what's going on in in Gaza what's taking place over the last year and a half all these War what's going on in Ukraine what's bubbling in the Middle East all these things you tell so so what is there not a God there's a Satan it's quite obvious because he's destroying the world and and every he's turning as many people against as many as he possibly can so if you recognize the darkness of this world you need to recognize that there's a God that's going to save people from that darkness and from that great tribul ation and the wickedness that's coming upon the Earth that's what the message of Salvation is all about so he says I know what people say all kinds of things and we know that it's a lot it's not right I can't answer for what others or any man says I got to answer for what I say amen I can only say what's whether it's truth or not and I'm the one he has to be responsible for it not what somebody else said says I can't judge no one I wasn't sent to judge but to preach the message Hallelujah aren't you glad that God gave our Prophet a revelation of who he was and that he would not have to now uh uh you know come under uh this you know because he came to realize he realized that the people were starting to call him they were saying my God don't no man could do the G the the the the the supernatural healings and and and miracles that were he was Raising Dead documented go back and look into it there's affidavits that are signed by doctors showing that this man William brandham not him it was God just like the signs and the stars in the heavens God sends signs and wonders so that they can be drawn to the attention of the word you got to go back to see why God was doing these Miracles through this man's Ministry and then listen to the messages that he preached while he was doing having those prayer lines and God was doing all of those Miracles through the man you need to go and search that and see why did he do all of this there's so much you know God woke me up in the middle of the night last night I was laying in bed from 3: until about 4:30 and I couldn't stop my mind he was taking me from before the foundations of the world Genesis all the way down through all the scriptures I can't even bring back to you what was flowing through my mind but everything all the how William bram's Ministry Branham b r a n h a m seven letters Abraham the faith of Abraham abbr seven letters how there was two Messengers that went into all these things were flowing through my mind and I'm saying oh my God Lord let me go to sleep please and all these things constantly flowing showing vindicating all of this that that that that the Earth has not woken up to see what's going on right now and to recognize God Vindicated William brandom in so many ways that that it's just mindboggling two Messengers went into Sodom Sodom and Gomorrah was sodomy is is homosexualism lesbianism it was at the heights when when God appeared to Abraham and went supernaturally appeared to Abraham sent those two angels into Sodom and Gomorrah to to Blind the people because God was going to destroy the sin all of a sudden I saw a i DS AIDS as in days Sodom what was AIDS it was a curse it was a disease that that came out of homosexualism out of sodomy out of the lesbianism all these things were just flowing through my mind and I was saying what is all of this Lord and it was just showing how the whole world has fallen into complete where we are now again as in the days of Sodom where sodomy they've taken it and they've they've perverted the word of God I can show you scriptures that absolutely condemns it right in the Book of Revelation God said if you see a man with another man burn them destroy that that unbelief amen he didn't permit it it was because it was Adam and Eve and one thing that I can say that Trump did which was really good and that's the anointing of the holy spirit because it's the age where the bride comes back to her rightful position as a woman in the church he said there's two genders male and female Adam and Eve the word is being restored amen and the Eve is being fully restored to recognize who she is praise God never mind all these alternate genders that's all unbelief it's all man's interpretation it's all men burning it's it's it's it's just total uh uh Abomination you got to call Sin what it is amen praise God because this is the hour where God's going to have a church that's going to stand on the word regardless regardless who you got to tell you might have listen I don't condemn those people absolutely not because it's not the people it's the spirits that are operating from the river Euphrates millions of spirits have come out and they're possessing the people possessing their minds possessing their hearts taking control because they don't want to submit to the word of God but if you make the word you're absolute that h ual spirit will leave you because you got to go back to your original of what you were before you you came into this world Amen praise God hallelujah glory to God Amen let's let's move on here because we're going to wind this down now he says here in the next quote the seed shall not be here with the Shu he says now the stock the tassel the Shu notice Hagar here represented the stock which was the first life that started in the promise remember God goes to Abraham says you're going to have a son 25 years later everything starts coming about but the first son that comes forth out of Abraham comes by unbelief she represented the stock Sarah represents the tassel or the pollen comes in the tassel but now pay attention Mary the Virgin represented and produce the true spiritual seed to bring forth the real true stock Hagar Sarah both by sex and that's why there has to be a church that will that will be produced like the original church back in the beginning without sex Satan perverted it when the when the serpent went and injected his seed through sex into the into the womb of Eve to bring forth a a son who would be a wild son who would end up being a murderer who was a murderer from the beginning because his seed came from Satan it was serpent seed it wasn't Adam's seed it was because of God's law of procreation and Satan took advantage of that law let every seed bring forth so he said oh wait a minute here I can bring forth my own seed and I can be worshiped like God is being worshiped I can create a people that'll worship me just like God is creating a people that will worship Him Glory to God Amen Sarah so Mary the Virgin represented and produced the true spiritual seed to bring forth the real true stock Hagar Sarah both was by sex but Mary the Virgin was by the power of God's promised word by virgin birth he's doing it again thank you glory to God he's doing it again Saints Hallelujah she brought forth the genuine seed that was the seed that God was talking about that that that would be the promised word remember Sarah brought forth the lineage of Isaac Jacob and so forth natural Church natural but the supernatural Church the spiritual church the one that's going to have to go in the Rapture by a supernatural body change she is not going to do it naturally they're trying to go to Mars they're trying to go to these planets they're trying to build spaceships they want to create molecular uh you know these things that they're that they're trying to uh create like a Rapture uh process and they're man trying to produce eternal life trying to break in to the other dimensions and all of these things they're never going to do it it's never going to produce anything you've got to come back to the word of God God God's Plan of Redemption that's what's important in this hour amen praise God and so the stock Hagar the second wife was by doubt of the promise working through a doubt slightly I just hope may God help us listen to what he's saying here may God help us to see here that it's not a natural birth it's not by joining a church it's not by your works it's not by how good of a Christian you might think you want to make yourself this comes by a supernatural Revelation that God reveals himself to you you've got to you've got to make yourself open to the Revelation that all things are possible Lord have your way like Mary said be it unto me according to Thy word let your word take preeminence amen I just hope may God help us I don't I want you to see this so bad you cannot slightly doubt any of it the minute that you say oh I don't need to be baptized in water in the name of the Lord Jesus you've just doubted the word you've just identified where you fit in the whole plan and unfortunately if you're not identified by the holy ghost in the word of God and coming under obedience to the word of God you're going to identify with the traditions of man and all of that all of that is being bundled for a purpose all the the because those are not wheat that's not the wheat remember the Original Seed is the word of God and that that seed that's being gathered into the barn for Christ there's another terar group because the tears are those that are that that that that claim to be Christians but they are actually the tears they don't believe the they've made the word of God of none effect they don't they deny the power of God what what is the power of God the Holy Ghost I will send to you power from on high what is the power the power is the Holy Ghost and to reject the word of God and say I don't need to be baptized I don't need to submit to the word I don't need to believe God's Messengers do you know that if they didn't follow Joshua into the promised land they perished in the wilderness true they all perished because of what unbelief they were not they they saw the pillar of fire they witnessed all the Miracles they saw everything that God was doing in their midst but yet when Joshua which is who is now on the scene this is the Joshua Commission because after Moses which William brandham was a type of Moses calling the people out of denominational bondage it was the Joshua commission that placed the children of God into the promised land amen and they recognized that they were were under the the leadership of Joshua and when they saw the Giants that they had to face they said we're more than able why because they were under the leadership of Joshua they knew that God was with Joshua because God said as I was with Moses so shall I be with thee he says just be strong and of good courage and go forth and take whatever God has shown you as yours amen praise God H glory to to God Amen let's we got to move on here amen praise God let's go to the next slide now Hagar by one little slight difference through woman not through Abraham now Abraham didn't want to do it but God let him do it because he same thing he let balum go on you can go God's permissive will if you want you can deny you can say oh don't listen to Danny don't listen to this don't listen to Tim don't listen to Mike don't listen to and you know they're they're talking about a message don't don't pay attention on Facebook to those messages about this cloud and this and that no you need to pay attention you need to recognize amen glory to God Abraham didn't want to do it but God let him do it because same thing he let balum go on now notice by slightly differing with it she brought forth Ishmael which was a wild man never conquered he lived by his bow he was a wild man he is yet today and I can say he is yet today that spirit is a wild Spirit now Sarah the tassel or the pollen Sarah the true wife of the promise brings forth a gentle man in return brought forth a promised Nation the nation of Israel now but Mary I'm talking to Mary's group here today Mary no sex no injection of man's doctrines not coming under I'm a Catholic I'm a Baptist I didn't ask you I said are you a Christian no no I I'm a presbyterian I'm a Jehovah Witness I'm a Buddhist no I'm not asking you that are you a Christian do you believe God's word amen praise God hallelujah Sarah a true wife of the promise brings forth a gentleman in return brought forth a promise Nation now but Mary no sex but through a promise just like Abraham got the promise from God and the word of God but believed the promise behold the handmade of the Lord see she she came to realize she was just she she had Faith to bring forth Jesus Christ didn't realized that that it was actually in her that that that she could actually believe it amen but it was in her and God is is saying is it in you are you able to stand in the day where where the the Holy Spirit now comes directly personal to you thank you Lord can you say be it unto me according to to to Thy word behold the handmade see brought forth not a stock but the original seed for he was the word that Abraham believed and that Mary believed glory to God see she had a revelation and here now go to the next slide we're going to we're going to I got to finish this he that this great mystery of God made known understands now he that that understands the hour that we're living in the message that we've received the prophet of Malachi 4 the opening of The Seven Seals the understanding of the seven Church ages The Messengers to all those ages you need to go back there's way too much here that I could possibly bring sorry I left off those two Messengers that went into Sodom that was Billy gram and Oral Roberts just so you can know you know I I got sidetracked back there but the Lord brought me back to that cuz he wants you to know that that they were they would go Graham was g r a h a m six six letters Roberts r o b e r TS six you got to see that it was man that was denominational teaching Billy Graham had a tremendous Ministry but it didn't bring the people back to the word it was just a Protestant teaching that everybody can be a Christian just like Billy Graham's son went and prayed right before right there at the presidential inauguration it's it's it's they they're they're they're claiming the word of God but they're so far from the absolute pure and adulterated word of God Amen why because they were sent in to Blind the people amen but who was with Abraham the angel himself Christ talking with Abraham and Abraham saying but what if there's hundred in there will you not destroy he says what if there's 10 what if there's he brought them all he says I want this because there was none all that brought out was lot and his family and even Sarah and and Lot's wife looked back when she was coming out of the world and she was turned into a pillar of salt lot just a type of those that are going to have to go through the tribulation but not the Abraham messenger who stood there and and said that this Abraham faith is going to bring forth a seed that's going to bring forth a bride that's going to go in the Rapture that is not going to go through when Sodom and Gomorrah is destroyed amen praise God hallelujah so he that this great mystery of God made known understands how that God was in Christ reconciling himself to the world how that he and the father were one how that the great mysteries of fulfilling of God taking and bringing himself manifested in the age of human beings God manifesting now in in our age in human beings amen and in the strain of human being and in the company of human beings to make his word manifested in the day in the Eastern rising of the Sun and to do the same things as the sun sets in the west to make make himself manifested in a bride Church in a church for this hour the word made manifest see it will be too he that understandeth that is known that's being revealed to him remember I said this is not something you learn I'm not here as a teacher to teach you about the word of God I'm here to show you in the scripture ures so that God by the by the preaching of the word by the foolishness of preaching the spirit of God will ride the word into your heart and open the understanding reveal himself to you personal amen amen him that sent me has everlasting life and will not come into the Judgment but is passed from Death unto life amen praise God glory to God Amen let's go to the next one here we're just gonna read these quotes and we're gonna we're going to finish off here the true seed come forth from Mary I want you to pay attention here as we we close it came from Mary but it was not her seed you need to understand Mary they want to call Mary the Mother of God God can't have a mother God doesn't have a father it was the Holy Spirit it was the it was the Holy Ghost that overshadowed her and placed in Mary both male and female the fullness of the seed of Jesus Christ she was only a carrier but she had it was the promise of God that she said behold the handmaiden of the Lord and God's got a people on Earth today that have recognized that it's going to be Christ by a Rapture by a supernatural revelation of rapturing faith that is going to transform your life it's going to bring you out of the bondage that you're in many are still in the bondage of of of of this bondswoman of believing that because I belong to a message and I and I've just and I've heard that a prophet came that's good enough no you need to come into contact with the the the the the male you've got Jesus said listen many are going to come to him on that day and say Lord Lord have I not prophesied in your name have I not you know he's going to say I never knew you he's going to say I never injected you with my seed I never my word was not in you you took the word of man you took the word of teachings of doctrines of man you were not a pure uh unadulterated seed word of God that would take the pure word of God Amen behold the handmaiden of the Lord the carrier of life was the woman and now Mary the seed so much closer Hagar had to receive it in a perverted way Sarah doubting thing brought it just a natural seed through sexual desire but Mary without any sex at all believed the word and the Word was made flesh and that's how it's coming forth in our lives it has to be by that it has to be but notice Mary being so close she held the seed in her womb and it looked like it would be her seed and so has the Pentecostals and and here we are in the message of the hour and it looks so close that everybody people claiming I'm in the message I'm in the message and they're going off and and and some are saying oh if you don't listen only the tapes you're lost if you don't if you don't say exactly what the prophet said you're lost they're they're not recognizing that the that Christ himself is in the midst of the people and she that that true church will not be deceived because she operates by Revelation she doesn't operate by the teachings of man and so notice Mary being so close she held the seed in her womb and it looked like it would be her seed and so has the Pentecostals I'm going to come home but remember Jesus said in Matthew 24 chapter he said in the last days the two Spirits not in the early days but now in the latter times the two Spirits would be so close together until it would deceive the very elected if it were possible Pentecostal Spirit just exactly like the real thing so perfect that it would deceive the very elect if it were possible but the true bride that's received Christ in this day and in this hour will not be deceived she will not not follow let the musicians come I got all this right from that message the seed shall not be a with the shock now it's got to come right straight back to that original Ministry he says here go to the next slide it's got to come right back to that original Ministry that he had here on Earth because it's the bride they are one now he promised in the last days how these things would happen and we see them happening like all the promises Malachi 4 go back check the scriptures Luke 17:30 in the day when the son of man is being revealed and how many more scriptures it' be endless he says here he says but go on he says but watch in the in the invisible Union but watch when the spiritual bride when a people come to realize when she begins to have a Revival and I believe that there's only one Revival that's happening right now and it's the bride's Revival it's the true church Revival it's the one that's separating that's being being uh uh that's leaving the rest behind not because she's trying to be something not because she's trying to make herself something she realizes that she can only be led by the spirit amen she can only be anointed by the word of God her understanding is open to see the prophecy that's happening around her she's going to recognize those that are in the message that are it's all law they're operating by law they haven't entered into that place where they've waken up they they've they've woken up to the true understanding he says watch he says when she begins to come back and line herself up with the word of God just like the vision that brother brandham saw he saw them that they were that they were walking in step with the word and some of them were were were were stepping out of line and they were pondering here and pondering there they were being distracted but he said get right back in line he said stay in line just stay with the word don't be distracted don't try to make yourself anything listen I I I I I don't know anything but what God reveals to me I I'm in this position in this office as a pastor some days I I still I still shake my head I don't understand I I you know it scares me it still scares me I'm telling you the truth okay but I know that I didn't do it I didn't start it God started this work 30 years ago God's going to finish this work I can only see what he allows me to see in the scripture I I can only see what I'm seeing I can only hear what I'm hearing and God revealing and making himself known he says watch then again you see how that the scriptures at that time there will be a message that'll sweep out to catch that bride to catch that elected woman and if there's anything that's got a hold of me it's not it's not that God sent a prophet it's not that oh you got to live this way you got to live that way it's that Jesus Christ has become a reality the word of God has become a reality to me I can see what's going on in the world I can see that they've rejected him I can see that they've taken sodomite condition I can see that they will not the word of God that they want to make themselves great they want to they want to profess they want to they want to act Godly but then they deny the power of the word of God what an hour Saints what an hour thank the Lord Jesus praise God forever more let us pray father I I could only bring as best as I possibly could Lord you're going to have to make it real to the hearts of the people Lord this message is it's beyond human comprehension father it takes Revelation it takes your divine intervention
