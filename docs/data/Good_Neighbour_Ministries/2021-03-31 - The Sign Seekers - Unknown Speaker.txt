TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good evening my dear friends once again we have come together in the presence of the lord how thankful we are for this great opportunity at this particular time easter time but for tonight our subject is the sign seekers another lesson in the church age series may god bless our thoughts tonight may the lord jesus help us as we study in the bible in the word of god and may we be strengthened and riched encouraged and enlightened all blessed be his holy name now our scripture is found in matthew chapter 12 reading verses 38 and 39 then certain of the scribes and of the pharisees answered saying master we would see a sign of thee and he answered and said unto them and evil and adulterous generation seek it after a sign and there shall be no sign given to it but the sign of the prophet jonah jonas praise god my emphasis will be on the fourth first part of it an evil and adulterous generation seek it after a sign o praise god let us pray a gracious father once again with joyful hearts we come into thy presence boldly by the blood of christ oh jesus may the great holy spirit anoint our hearts together that we do not come together by tradition or churchianity but we come together led by the holy spirit drawn into his presence with the trill the excitement and the heartthrob of happiness that comes from the joy of knowing jesus christ in the fullness of his power and authority through the word of god bless us now we pray for we ask it in jesus name amen and amen praise god hallelujah amen well friends many books of course have been written and many perspectives given about america's place the united states of america her place in bible prophecy now my that is not my main topic tonight i'm just passing by that but you ought to know that the united states of america is identified in revelation 13. however uh prophets through the ages have preached sermons and spoke the word of god from different perspectives jeremiah was told to write what god said to him and put it in a book john was told to write part of it john right and another part god says don't write but the fact is they were directed by god and what they wrote and said was just saith the lord it came from the mouth and pen of god's prophet of that day and in our day the same holy spirit has spoken to our dear precious brother and said pick up your pen and write and here we see history repeating itself again because from the time of of israel in their history under what was happening on the king ahab is happening again it is now being repeated in the world's history and in particular in the history of america when that was happening it was during that time that the prophet elijah appeared on the scene with a message from almighty god hallelujah and here now in our modern times when the same prophetic type of scenery and atmosphere is here once again a prophet in the spirit of elijah true prophecy of malachi 4 chapter 5 that would turn the hearts of the children to the fathers amen oh my praise god here we are god promised it and we believed it so and just as israel had left egypt to go into the wilderness and then the promised land even so has god's people had to leave they the task masters of denominationalism they had to leave this la that land where they labored and were enslaved there in prisons with stained glass windows and set free by the power of the word of the living god amen and when they were brought out and speaking of israel now they grew as a nation and leaders came forth you know after moses and joshua and then later on we had great leaders david you know coming forth in the leadership of the nation of israel but then israel made a fatal mistake they placed ahab on the throne and ahab brought with him his wife jezebel in actual fact jesse bell kept very quiet mute but she was actually the neck that was turning the head for he was the head of the nation but jezebel was behind him orchestrating manipulating moving scheming uh doing all manner of things to change the complexion and change the atmosphere and the worship in the and culture in that nation of israel i believe the same thing has been done in the united states of america it has already been done and is going on right now because we know the prophet of malachi 4 5 who we believe is brother william marion branham that came the 20th century prophet in the time of uh john kennedy and jacqueline kennedy administered during that time and made his own applications on that particular situation now just the same as the early settlers in the united states left the old lands uh in europe to come to america to find freedom freedom of worship in particular where they could give glory and praise to god and there arose like in israel great men great generals men like washington abraham lincoln and then after that time they began to digress or digress from the word of god and the way of god the way of worshiping god and they received a poorer caliber a poorer quality of leadership in the nation until if we were to come up to that this 20th century and this 20 to 2020 2021 we come to this time where we see america at her lowest point where the leadership has come almost to nothing the this poor caliber and quality of leadership have succeeded great men that have gone before worthy men that was in that position now then we see a an ahab with a jezebel uh behind him to direct him in everything that he does but thank god as it was then so was it again and so is it or then rose up the great messenger that the spirit of elijah that god sent in our day and then in this time of the latter rain this message of this messenger is now ready and a red for battle for a great mount zion showdown mount carmel showdown now we know that john the baptist was the forerunner of jesus christ and he planted of course the former reign it was rejected by the organizations of his day sadducees pharisees uh it was rejected and jesus came and he had a mount zion showdown the second forerunner of christ is going to saw the seed hallelujah for the latter rain oh glory to god hallelujah and when he saw the seed i tell you it will be a showdown between them denominations and creeds between them and the revealed word of god in the lives of the various believers and then he's gonna come back amen and take his bride in a rapture out of here praise god now when they spoke about the latter rain back in the pentecostal days they had a complete misunderstanding of the latter rain they did not understand what it was they just know knew it was the moving of the holy spirit or when they got a second wave within pentecost itself they called that the latter rain not realizing that when it comes to using the term latter rain first of all quoting brother branham spoken word is the original seed now joel in joel 2 28 god is speaking about the coming of the former and later reign that he will pour out upon his people now the word former in hebrew is more h and that means teaching it'll be a teaching reign in other words a former and a lateran it would be a teaching rain and a harvesting amen teaching rain and a harvest rain praise god now we've had the teaching rain now we got to get ready for the harvest rain of course the first rain is when you plant the seed any farmer knows that you you plant the seed and you wait for the spring rain or the first rains former rains at planting time for that rain to germinate the seeds and there we have it but then there must come another rain when those grains or fruits begin to mature you see the sunlight the sun is not enough excuse me the sun will sweeten the grain or sweeten the fruit but if too much sun then it begins to dry up you need a bit of rain to give it some plumpness and ripeness moistness oh praise god how we need the spirit of god to fall upon the word and quitting the word of god to give us that sweetness plumpness and ripeness that we need in this day and in this hour as we minister the word of god to a people in this time of the harvest reign for the seed have been planted the water will raise it up again oh praise god hallelujah a prophet of god has come with the word of god the spoken word being the original seed that seed has been planted in in the heart of the true believers that believed it and received it oh praise god now it's been growing all through this time between his preaching passing and now the growing and now the maturity walking in the way and will of god hallelujah and now i want to tell you friends it's harvest time praise god hallelujah amen it was so strange that just before just before their planting become to a maturity just before the people entered into the promised land let me go back to elijah just before his ministry comes this maturity amen his elisha comes to his maturity elijah was called away into the presence of god just before joshua caleb and the young ones come to their maturity to enter into the promised land moses was called off the scene amen and jesus john was called into seclusion separated from those whom he loved but yet it was for a purpose and plan of god and many don't didn't mess up did not understand that kind of separation that kind of a seclusion but it was in the purpose plan of the living god to make the word come to life again see their messages have been had been rejected moses elijah and john the messages were rejected by the various groups that they had declared the word of god to but thank god their seed had been sown the message had gone forth through their ministry their planting time and hour was over amen the next thing was harvested judgment would strike the land straight the hearts they had served their purpose assigned posts to the nation and to the people so the next step is then the judgment judgment what's coming next hallelujah friends i believe revelation 13 16 that after a while we have a window uh a quick short work where we who are preaching this revelation of this truth they they the devil working true as various means is going to demand that the uh bride the elected believers that have received this word stop preaching they'll do everything in their power to hinder you disrupt you cl shut you down do everything possible to do that that is it my friends because they are going to demand that you have their mark in your hand in other words you're gonna work for them and that you have their mark in your forehead that you have their teaching their brand their brand of their number god knows their name and their number he's got their name and he's got their number but they want to put that in you you're thinking your thoughts of your heart and your mind amen and friends we know right there that the mark of god the seal of god is the holy spirit by which you are sealed unto the day of your redemption the mark of the beast is nothing but the spirit of denominational and its systems that controls the minds and the hearts of men well we know denominations they will all take the name take the mark they'll all take it amen or else they're going to be forced to quit preaching and to shut down their churches then the lamb will take his bride to be ever at his side and judge the great denominational mother of harlots mystery babylon the great that great harlot to the word of god unclean unfaithful rebellious against god's word she'd rather speak her own words make her own books make her own letters her own thoughts and speak all kinds of as we may say bull and give that to the people and reject the word of god not outwardly coming and saying oh we will reject we we we reject the word of god we don't believe no the devil doesn't work like that if the devils believe one will tremble the devil will tell you he believes the word of god but then he'll turn around and disobey it call no man father it's written in your bible but they will do that the word of god will tell you clearly christ died for your sins paul tells you we should pray to no other one but to jesus christ amen oh my they say oh but you know jesus loves his mother and and jesus will listen to his mother if his mother speaks to him so you know you should speak to his mother and and then she will answer your prayer by talking to her son it's not in your bible it is not in the word of god what's the matter with you people wake up back to the bible back to the word the simplicity of the gospel of jesus christ hallelujah is why a lot of people reject the word you want to hear it in a sophisticated you want to hear it in an embellished way you want to hear it in such a way that will tickle your ears but we are not here to tickle your ears we are not here to make you top your feet we are here my friends to preach the word of god so it'll make you give you a heart-stopping kind of religion where you trust god believe his word and walk in his way and in his will oh glory to god hallelujah amen amen so the planting rain goes forth and then the harvest rain oh my think about it brother sister amen now what do we we know billy graham struck the world then the pentecostals struck the world but then here comes the word of god the word of god comes riding in and the word strikes the world hallelujah the unbelievers the make believers and the true believers attracted by the word of god hallelujah so here we are spiritually standing being judged quantified discerned by the revealed word for this day and for this hour lord of god hallelujah amen oh praise god thank god he sent to moses but moses could not come until the people cried in their heart and called out to god for they needed to have a touch from his mighty hand glory to god what a day what an hour you remember when moses was there in egypt how he threw his rod upon the ground and the bible says the magicians the wise men of pharaoh came and threw their rods upon the ground moses rod became a serpent their rods became serpents they were working signs and wonders too and they were doing it but the bible says moses is rod his serpent at the other serpents and swallowed them up completely amen but friends we are here in a day as our scripture says an evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign there are multitudes of them moses came first through his stick on the ground became a serpent then here comes the impersonators here comes an army of copycats here comes these ones that were tried to to do exactly what moses did brother branham comes on the scene with a mighty gift of discernment first of all the first pull mighty gift of healing with the spirit of god moving within his hand it wasn't long after that there came a whole bunch of different preachers at that time with feelings in their hands and fire in their hand and blood in their hand of oil coming out to their hand and everything of that nature but not on not until god had produced it and manifested it through brother branham then we see all these ministries copycatting that then the spirit of god said okay he moved on to discernment where he would stand and with his back turned call the people by their names tell them their address where they're from where they were born and things when you were a child i i can see you you were sitting here and you were thinking you were thinking this this this this and is that true the person would say yes sir that's true oh thousands and thousands and tens of thousands of times are never one time wrong shortly after that oh we end up with a lot of disearners people began to discern they begin to suddenly start to claim everybody is a prophet everybody starts seeing things everybody start to get visions oh you never heard of that before but now all of a sudden there's a proliferation of them like like flies coming off of a dead carcass that all of a sudden you've gotten a whole set of them and now we are ending up with a multitude of sign seekers in one night what was seen in the ministry of this prophet thousands of deliverances thousands of miracles and healings they would be happy if they got ten and they would rejoice at what a revival what a big meeting they had one crippled walk and they oh it was so massive they put it in a magazine or something and it was just a normal everyday thing with him that even while he was going about his normal life during the day he'll be praying for people somebody will come he'll lay his hands upon them they'll be healed he'll tell them keep quiet don't tell anybody about it just go about your business they'll be delivered by the power of god not today they want the glory they want the popularity they want the money they want the spotlight they want the attention they want the name instead of taking the name of jesus and walking as his servants in the shadow in his shadow no they want to put themselves to the front whoa i am doctor so-and-so i have a phd lld you know i i have this and i have that they're plaster your wall with with degrees yeah oh my i'm professor of this and i'm professor of that that's okay you keep professing i want to be possessing but in any case we find there are multitudes of them and we live in this day where they have universities they have bible schools they have all kinds of places putting those things out where you can literally take some money and go buy a buy a doctor divinity certificate or diploma you can go and pay for a of a doctor of this and a master of that and uh whatever else literally for money they can buy it my friends this is the world we are living in and that is why back to the word so that the word could straighten your mind your thinking your thoughts of your heart give you the clarity of thought and the clarity of discerning through the filters of the word of god and separate truth from error right from wrong o blessed be the name of the living god amen they know little or anything about the word but oh they'll jump they'll dance they'll scream for signs and wonders amen they don't know anything about the true move of the living god all they want to see is blood and fire and smoke and feathers and all kinds of various things they don't care what is in the word they're busy doing their gesticulations oh oh they don't want to hear what's in the word of god when the word says all that you do do in the name of jesus christ oh look what we're doing here contrary to the word of god amen i'm a preacher yes you may be assigned both but if the signpost is pointing in the wrong direction you're bearing false witness to the very word of god you claim to represent here it is my brothers and my sisters amen they'll support any sign no matter how unscriptural it is oil coming out of a statue blood coming from brick that man carved with his hand and then kneels before it to worship contrary to the word of god thou shalt not bow down to them nor serve them for i thy god and the living god hear o israel the lord thy god is one lord and the lord thy god is a jealous god amen back to the bible back to the word of god and the original faith taught unto us amen within his promise for this day amen god word warned us about this day coming matthew chapter 24 jesus speaks about this day coming how there'll be these two spirits upon the earth one a deceiving false and the other one the true spirit or the holy spirit who is the spirit of truth but there will be cl so close together that only the elected will be allowed to be able to detect or discern the difference between those two spirits it's just like in the garden of eden did you know satan came preaching to eve he said god said right he quoted what god said he caught it from the very they didn't have a bible then but he caught it from the word of god of what god said he said not god said this this this this and this yes he quoted from it he was one of the first early preachers amen oh my god had to come and say well look uh the woman's seed is gonna bruise that serpent's head and here comes god preaching the word but the two together like that it takes revelation discernment the discern between good and evil truth and error amen how you gonna tell those spirits apart both religious one esau one jacob both are sons what one claim is the son the other one playing jesus son how are you going to know which one is the ear of god my friends only one way give them the word test amen test them by the word as john said try every spirit and prove them amen whether they be in the faith hallelujah so you've got to give give them the word test and if they don't speak in line with the word they are of their father the devil who was a liar from the beginning and he deceived the first two brides they deceive eve in the garden he deceived the church after paul left the scene and took her into the dark ages he deceived them but this one who is predestinated by election to receive this word of god she will not be deceived individually individuals may be well if they listen to the lies of the serpent whispering and hissing within their ears but listen to the voice of god in these last days listen to the word of god that's been given to you in this hour amen see trying to get the last that brighter hybrid dies herself and mongrel lies whatever she's going to bring forth amen but we want to produce nothing but the pure word of god hallelujah amen praise god many are leave many are being fallen by the wayside because they're taken to creeds take into their own thoughts turning from god's original word to a great time of science seeking music loud music dancing shouting running up the aisles amen that's good amen but god never plays signs ahead of his word the bible tells us signs should follow the word amen oh my signs will follow them that believe it doesn't precede they want signs to for a revival and it's not that the signs don't produce the revival the word is supposed to produce the move of god and then signs follow amen after that so stay with god's word and promise of the hour remember when elijah came to that widow he said bake me a cake first and god always says you give me seek first the kingdom god always wants to come to his word first receive the promise first and then all these other things will be added to you and manifested through your life for his glory and for his honor amen praise god come to the word first that for the seed word of god then becomes quickened by the blessed holy spirit amen how can a messenger from god differ with the word of god how can the true messenger of god preach tree gods or tree in one how can a messenger teach something like the trinity when that is only uh something that came forth uh in the early parts of christianity paganism introduced into christianity by the pagans of pagan rome and brought in until today it's accepted as fact that that's the word of god it's not the word of god for god does not change his word or his mind about his word when he said i am one hero israel jehovah is one praise god i the lord thy god i'm a jealous god amen praise god jesus said i am praise the lord i and my father are one not three not two not million whatever one praise god and that is what he taught and that is what we believe a true preacher true man of god will declare the whole word not part of the word and then high discrepancy doctrine part of the word and hide from the people that it's only one not three and baptism is to be in the name of jesus christ not in the titles of father son and holy ghost which are not even names but only the titles of the one person who is a father who came as a son and is now in invisible form as the holy ghost amen hallelujah glory to his marvelous wonderful name amen denominations hated him then and they're gonna hate you now but stand by the word of the living god like they crucified him and persecuted him so he said they're going to persecute you they're going to call you all mandarin names and speak evil and spread all matter of rumors about you amen praise god hallelujah oh i thank god that he sent a messenger in our day a true voice of god in these last days hallelujah to get a people ready for the rapture oh glory to god and that they will act like abraham did as for they are the royal seed of abraham who held to god's word in god's hand and in this hour we will hold god's unchanging hand or praise his name because we are predestinated together to be caught up to meet him in the air by the power of the blessed holy spirit amen praise god thank god that messenger came at god's appointed time this end time that we are living in oh what a hour it's midnight friends it's black out now oh there's only one glimmer of light and it's coming out of this message left by this prophet the rest is the people walking in darkness oh but a predestinated people have seen the light amen praise god israel is now back in our homeland the six-point star of david flying over that nation praise god i've been there seven times amen and i expect to go back once all of this pollution and and plague is over by the grace of god let me tell you israel a nation mixed jews of all kinds chinese jews indian jews black jews and i've spoken to some of them well amen they're in every aspect of life whether it's military whether it's in in their rabbis some of their rabbis and mixtures everywhere amen they have problems like every other nation they've got the discrimination like every other nation they've got all manner of social problems like any other country every that's everywhere but i'm telling you all as a whole there's a great mixture within that nature that nation at that this particular time that she's back in her homeland amen praise the lord jesus thank god a messenger came that was dedicated to the word of god and his presence was indicated by the word of god malachi 4 5 and his ministry was vindicated by the power of the holy spirit hallelujah praise god here it is his ministry is produced and is producing a mount zion showdown there's going to be a showdown praise god hallelujah amen the word of truth versus era lies amen verses the light and truth coming from the word of god many people will not understand this message many people will hate it many will be angry with it and that's because they have been taught the scripture church people so-called christian people yet they'll be angry and misunderstand because they've been taught a certain way and to see the bible from a certain perspective they have on blinders like we put on on horses and donkeys and they're looking through blinders they can't see here they can't see they're just looking in one direction and won't listen to anything air else blind their eyes and deafen their ears and harden their hearts and refuse to recognize the word of god for this day and for this hour amen because they're looking at the scripture in a certain way that they consider to be the truth amen and even a lot of good men and there's a lot of good men and good preachers out there in those denominations when i speak of denominations i'm not speaking about the people in there those people are people in there who are following that because they're trying to meet their spiritual hunger and quench their thirst it's not their fault but the denominational system has caught them in a net of unbelief contrary to the word of god and a lot of men and women and children young people are caught in that denominational uh trap there and so they misunderstand this word and this preaching of this word of god and misunderstand this messenger will call him all kinds of names call you all kinds of names because so much has been called the truth every one of those denominations claim they have the truth oh my i don't have to tell you i have the truth you search the scriptures and then you you believe you'll find it or think you find eternal life you will see you'll know whether i'm telling you the truth or not recognize it by the word the holy spirit will lead you and guide you amen thank god all mine and just as john came the first time and said behold the lamb of god that taketh away the sins of the world thank god he sent another prophet to the gentile dispensation who not only says behold the lamb of god the word that uh you know the beholder that taketh away the sins of the world but now this messenger this forerunner is saying behold the lamb of god that taketh the pride away into glory take the oh praise god hallelujah this messenger the first one came to announce the word seed going into the ground this one is here to tell not to put the word seed only in the ground but to bring it out or to call it out how it is the rising of the sun amen and to bring a bride bring her back into glory praise god hallelujah the messenger of truth amen this true elected uh servant of god sent to call out a word-born bride or a people who has their new birth not coming from a church teaching or a church some church doctrine with church book but their new birth comes from the word revealed unto them behold the lamb of god coming now in glory amen first coming planting of the original seed but now it's the harvest time the harvest rain is falling the message of our prophet is falling everywhere and the power of the holy spirit with this great time of refreshing coming upon us in this hour oh friends i can close i can conclude this sermon that joined my heart telling you that it's harvest time it's harvest time it's harvest time the savior's calling the grain is falling oh do not wait it's growing late [Music] look up my friends behold the fields are white it's harvest time may the lord speak to your heart and may you be sweet fruit harvested for his coming glory in the name of our jesus christ i ask it and believe it amen may god help you to make your choice today be baptized in jesus name come to him be filled with the spirit your lamp filled and clear oh look up your redemption is near may god bless you tonight as we give him all the glory and praise god bless you goodbye friends [Music] you
