[20:42] so when they had dined that's the lord
[20:45] jesus christ
[20:47] eat dining with the disciples
[20:52] nine jesus said unto simon peter simon
[20:56] son of jonas
[20:59] lovest thou me
[21:01] more than this
[21:03] he said unto him yea
[21:06] lord
[21:07] thy knowest that i loved ye
[21:10] he said unto him feed my lambs
[21:15] he said unto him again the second
[21:19] time
[21:20] simon son of jonah lovers
[21:23] doubt me
[21:25] he said unto him
[21:27] yea lord
[21:28] thy knowest
[21:30] that i loved him
[21:33] he said unto him feed my sheep
[21:37] he said unto him third time
[21:40] simon
[21:41] son of jonas
[21:43] lovers down me
[21:45] peter said
[21:47] grieved
[21:48] because
[21:49] he said unto him
[21:52] the third time love without me
[21:56] and he said unto him lord thy knowest
[22:00] all things
[22:02] that
[22:03] know words that i loved he
[22:06] just said unto him
[22:08] feed my sheep
[22:09] may the lord add his blessing
[22:12] you may be sealed now
[22:15] my subject tonight
[22:19] is
[22:21] confidence
[22:24] you know
[22:28] peter know that the lord jesus christ
[22:30] know him
[22:32] that he loves him
[22:35] he know that he lost him
[22:38] but he was asking him a special question
[22:43] not the love
[22:45] that peter was thinking about
[22:48] he was asking him special love because
[22:51] he has a special work for peter to do
[22:56] he wants peter to have confidence he
[22:59] want to know if he has confidence
[23:01] because confidence
[23:03] the word confidence is
[23:05] firm belief
[23:09] trust
[23:11] someone that you can rely on
[23:14] sisterly nice to see you
[23:17] praise the lord
[23:20] someone that you can rely on
[23:24] can god rely upon you
[23:27] right now as you are in his presence
[23:31] it's a question
[23:33] to every one of us
[23:37] the lord is asking do you really love
[23:39] him more than anything in this world
[23:44] hallelujah
[23:46] there is a different love
[23:50] a love between your brother
[23:52] and your sister
[23:54] and at the same time your wife and your
[23:56] husband but god is not asking that kind
[23:59] of love
[24:01] he has a special work for peter
[24:05] so he was strengthening him because you
[24:07] know at that time the holy ghost was not
[24:09] given
[24:11] so peter was relying upon
[24:14] how he walked with the lord jesus christ
[24:17] daily
[24:19] but peter did he understand
[24:21] so what happened he was getting mad
[24:25] grieve he didn't like it
[24:31] but god
[24:32] wants peter to rely upon him because he
[24:34] has a special work for him so do you
[24:39] brethren sitting here
[24:41] tonight
[24:43] can god rely upon you can god has
[24:47] confidence on you
[24:50] because each and every one he calls for
[24:52] a purpose
[24:54] he didn't call us to come and sit on the
[24:56] pew every day day in day out
[25:00] you have to find
[25:02] your purpose
[25:05] where god can use you
[25:08] badly
[25:10] there is a work for each and everyone to
[25:13] do hallelujah
[25:15] could we imagine peter work with the
[25:18] lord
[25:19] for so long time
[25:22] but the lord still asks him
[25:24] do you really love me
[25:30] but peter couldn't understand
[25:32] why he was asking him but later
[25:36] hallelujah
[25:38] let me tell you
[25:40] if you're a believer
[25:43] sometimes people lost confidence
[25:46] especially sometime in their in their in
[25:48] their pastor
[25:51] if you love
[25:52] if you lost confidence in your pastor
[25:57] when he can see you when he does
[25:59] everything if you do
[26:00] a day day in day out he works so hard to
[26:04] feed you
[26:06] and you do something else
[26:08] and he tells you
[26:10] and you take that in his heart fresh
[26:13] heart
[26:14] because he wants to be you want to
[26:18] he is a shepherd god order him to be a
[26:21] pastor to you it doesn't matter whoever
[26:25] stands right on the pulpit here
[26:29] for god chose that person to lead you
[26:33] god already ordained him to lead you
[26:36] through
[26:37] brother abraham said even if you lost
[26:40] confidence
[26:42] in your pastor
[26:44] pray for him
[26:45] and if you think
[26:48] he has
[26:50] he has swept away but abram said your
[26:53] faith and your confidence to the word of
[26:56] god will turn him right back to the word
[26:58] of god
[27:00] to lead you
[27:02] brethren
[27:03] is going home time
[27:05] there is no time to fool around
[27:08] it doesn't matter where you are
[27:11] you know where we standing running in
[27:14] this world here now
[27:16] it's about it's a time to go home
[27:19] you have to find the place where you can
[27:22] fit and stay right there and do your
[27:26] part perfectly
[27:29] if you stay
[27:30] where you are and i'm staying where i am
[27:34] perfectly
[27:36] the word of god will move smoothly
[27:39] because i will not look at what you are
[27:42] doing
[27:43] because that's not my
[27:45] position
[27:46] to look what you're doing
[27:49] i have to do i have to stand
[27:52] firm for what god has entrusted in my
[27:55] hands to do so that your work and my
[27:57] work when we get together the holy ghost
[28:00] will move smoothly
[28:03] and the word of god will manifest the
[28:05] same exactly where he wants to be
[28:08] manifest
[28:10] each and everyone is important in the
[28:13] eyes of god
[28:15] in his place
[28:17] nobody is not important it doesn't
[28:19] matter who you are if you think you are
[28:22] not important i'm telling you you are
[28:24] deceiving yourself
[28:26] you are important in the eyes of god
[28:28] that's why he brought you here
[28:31] thank you lord
[28:32] god call his children because he know he
[28:36] has a work for them to do
[28:38] thank you lord
[28:41] amen
[28:42] as i said if you lost even if you lost
[28:45] confidence in your pastor
[28:50] you don't have to come to that his
[28:52] presence because god ordained him you
[28:55] cannot get nothing from him
[29:00] hallelujah
[29:03] the same thing the pharisees did
[29:08] because one day we're gonna say oh he's
[29:10] a man
[29:11] he's not god
[29:13] let me tell you
[29:15] you cannot bypass him to god to go to
[29:17] god
[29:18] no matter what you do you cannot bypass
[29:21] that pastor that is leading you and go
[29:23] to god god will never listen to you
[29:26] because you're there him to lead you
[29:28] through
[29:30] respect and obey
[29:32] obey him
[29:34] and you'll be blessed
[29:36] hallelujah
[29:37] thank you lord you're gonna say oh yes
[29:40] he's a man
[29:43] yes he's a man
[29:44] but you cannot bypass him to
[29:46] to to god
[29:50] he is your spiritual father
[29:54] on this earth here
[29:56] hallelujah
[29:58] why pharisees failed to see the lord
[30:00] jesus christ
[30:02] why
[30:04] because why they
[30:06] recognized him as
[30:09] he considers him as a man
[30:13] thank you lord
[30:16] but let me tell you
[30:18] he was more than a man
[30:23] when he took five loaves
[30:26] of bread
[30:27] and maybe three fishes or five fishes
[30:30] and feed and fed five thousand people he
[30:33] was more than a man
[30:37] when lazarus was dead
[30:42] for three days
[30:44] and he stood
[30:47] that tomb there
[30:50] and says lazarus comfort
[30:53] he was he was more than a man
[30:56] hallelujah
[30:58] god has a work for us to do
[31:01] hallelujah
[31:06] thank you jesus
[31:09] when he called moses
[31:11] moses was a man
[31:16] he put an anointed mercies the same way
[31:19] he anointed your pastor or the man of
[31:22] god whom god ordained to stand on this
[31:25] puppeteer to speak to you
[31:28] when you come inside the house in the
[31:30] presence of the heart of the lord
[31:32] look
[31:33] past who the man who is speaking to you
[31:36] don't look that man look beyond that man
[31:39] inside that man behind that man there's

[31:48] in the on the pulpit preaching he is
[31:50] going to
[31:52] answer every word that he spoke to you
[31:56] it's not easy
[31:58] for god man to stand on the pulpit and
[32:01] preach to the sins of god
[32:03] because they are god people
[32:06] those people brethren are sitting on the
[32:09] pill they are god children
[32:12] so while you coming to speak to them you
[32:15] tremble
[32:18] there's a butterfly going through your
[32:20] belly your mind your soul
[32:23] because

[32:27] word is the one who's leading them
[32:30] guiding them to the presence of god
[32:34] so if you don't free them the right food

[59:55] against him
[59:57] muslims give him a space of time
[59:59] they couldn't repent
[1:00:01] and god said step out
[1:00:03] every time they do something mercy step
[1:00:05] in
[1:00:07] and say lord if you're gonna kill them
