[9:52] It's a great privilege, oh God, to have

[19:31] Amen. Welcome to the house of the living
[19:34] God.
[19:36] Please can be seated. You can be seated.
[19:38] The Bible said where two or three are
[19:40] gathered in my name, I'll be in your
[19:41] midst. Pastor Danny send his greetings.
[19:44] Um the people that went to Ghana, they
[19:46] have all arrived safely. Pastor Sam and
[19:49] his wife, my wife and Priscilla,
[19:53] um Abigail, Paul, Dborah, Sister
[19:57] Elizabeth and Samuel. They have all
[20:00] arrived safely. So let's continue to
[20:02] remember them that everything will go on
[20:05] perfectly well. Um without wasting much
[20:08] time and I'm going to
[20:10] pray. Oh our gracious eternal
[20:15] God. You are kind heavenly
[20:18] father. You are good
[20:21] God. There is nothing bad about you.
[20:23] It's a bad devil and a good God. Father,
[20:27] we are here asking for your divine grace
[20:31] and mercy to help us tonight. Get
[20:34] ourself out of the way so that your
[20:37] children will be blessed and will see
[20:40] you. Father, my prayer tonight is that
[20:44] no one leave here the same way they
[20:46] came. Oh God, they have come through the
[20:50] rain and sacrifice.
[20:54] Please Jesus, won't you hear our prayer
[20:57] tonight that their needs will be met?
[21:00] Lord, oh God, bless every aspect of the
[21:03] service, anything unlike thee. Lord, we
[21:06] come against it. Lord, you commit every
[21:09] thought, every feeling, every
[21:12] imagination, everything to the subject
[21:14] of the living God. Come and bless your
[21:18] children again in the name of our Lord
[21:20] Jesus Christ. Amen. I have two
[21:23] scriptures um Psalm 60:1-2 and Isaiah 60
[21:28] verse 1-2 and uh Psalm 62 1 to8 just
[21:34] that when I got here I I realized I
[21:36] forgot my little notes at home so I just
[21:39] write wrap something up quickly but
[21:42] doesn't matter it's not about the nose
[21:44] it's about him so don't worry everything
[21:46] will be fine okay Isaiah chapter 60
[21:50] verse1 arise eyes shine for the light is
[21:54] come for thy light is come and the glory
[21:58] of the Lord is risen upon
[22:00] thee. For behold, the darkness shall
[22:03] cover the earth and gross darkness the
[22:06] people, but the Lord shall rise upon
[22:09] thee, and his glory shall be seen upon
[22:12] thee. Um Psalm 62:1-8.
[22:19] Truly my soul waiteth upon God. From him
[22:24] cometh my
[22:26] salvation. He only is my rock and my
[22:29] salvation. Rock is the revelation. He's
[22:32] my defense. I shall not be greatly
[22:35] moved. How long will you imagine
[22:38] mischief against a man?
[22:41] Ye shall be slain all of you as a
[22:44] boowing wall shall ye be and as a
[22:47] torrening
[22:49] fence. The only they only consult to
[22:52] cast him down from his
[22:54] excellence. They delight in lies. They
[22:58] bless with their mouth. May they curse
[23:01] inwardly. That's a hypocrite. Uh the
[23:04] next verse, my soul waiteth thou only
[23:07] upon God. For my expectation is from
[23:10] him. You get what you expect? He only is
[23:13] my rock and my salvation. Talk about
[23:17] rock again means revelation. He is my
[23:20] defense. I shall not be moved. In God is
[23:24] my
[23:25] salvation and my glory. The rock of my
[23:29] strength and the refuge is in God. All
[23:31] talk about all the rock means
[23:33] revelation. Trust in him at all
[23:36] times. Amen. Yay people pour out your
[23:41] heart before
[23:43] him. God is a refuge for
[23:47] us. Let heavenly father please bless the
[23:51] reading of your word in Jesus name.
[23:53] Amen. Please be seated.
[23:56] So for the Psalm 62 it all talk about
[24:00] rock rock rock and rock is a revelation.
[24:03] So if I will title it I'll say that um
[24:06] you must have your own personal
[24:08] revelation. Amen. Because without you
[24:12] having your personal revelation you
[24:13] cannot meet God or you must meet God for
[24:16] yourself. You must see God for yourself.
[24:19] Without you seeing God you can't please
[24:21] him. And there are so many things but I
[24:24] think that
[24:26] um the word itself delight when it is
[24:30] vindicated. So in other words you have
[24:33] to have your own personal revelation
[24:38] because without that that you cannot
[24:40] please
[24:41] God. Amen.
[24:44] Hallelujah. Amen. Because um it's
[24:46] talking about the gross darkness upon
[24:49] the whole world. said you as a Christian
[24:52] there's a light shining through you.
[24:54] Amen. So he said talk about in shalom
[25:00] paragraph
[25:02] 246. Um okay that's fine. Look if the
[25:06] Bible tells us of these things that is
[25:09] to come. Speak of all these hours that
[25:12] we've passed through the days of Noah is
[25:15] predicted.
[25:17] The days of all these others the
[25:18] scripture predicted the days of Martin
[25:21] Luther was the days of Wesley the days
[25:24] of Pentecostal this hour that we are
[25:26] living in was predicted everything
[25:29] happened just exactly the way it was
[25:33] then when it what is it that's my main
[25:37] that really catch my attention here it
[25:39] is the spoken word of God which is
[25:42] vindicated by God makes it the light of
[25:47] the hour. Amen. See, just like the sun
[25:51] is when the word the word itself is the
[25:54] light when is
[25:57] vindicated for the hour. John was that
[26:01] the light he was more light than Elijah
[26:04] and them had Elijah. He
[26:09] wasn't He wasn't Elijah's light, but
[26:13] he wasn't Elijah's light, but he was
[26:17] Elijah in another form, a vindicating
[26:20] the light. See, he was and when Jesus
[26:24] come, he said he was a bright and shine
[26:26] light for a season. You love to walk in
[26:30] this light. And John said, "Now I must
[26:33] dim out. I must go out now. My light is
[26:39] finished shining. I must go. He must
[26:42] increase. Which is other words he the
[26:45] more the Bible said the more we get
[26:46] ourself after the way the little that we
[26:49] become the more that God can what
[26:52] increase in us and what reveal himself.
[26:55] So we are not supposed to think
[26:58] ourselves highly than ourselves or
[27:02] highly than anybody else. And the more
[27:05] that we can humble ourselves and the
[27:08] more that we can belittle ourselves, the
[27:10] more that God himself can use you and
[27:14] me. So if you want God to be to use you,
[27:17] you got to belittle yourself. Humble
[27:20] yourself in the sight of the Lord and he
[27:23] will what? Lift you up. Amen. So the
[27:27] light vindicated light of the word
[27:33] Let me see this
[27:37] again. The word the spoken word of God
[27:41] which is vindicated by God makes it the
[27:44] light of the
[27:47] hour. When the word spoke and is
[27:50] vindicated by God is the word for the
[27:53] hour for that day.
[27:55] And I'll start from Moses because you
[28:02] cannot please God unless God revealed
[28:05] himself to you. And
[28:08] Moses learned everything about the
[28:11] Egyptians. He was h became to become the
[28:16] next pharaoh. He has all
[28:19] the the the
[28:22] knowledge everything and his
[28:27] mom who became his uh nurse nursing
[28:31] mother whatever it was the maid taught
[28:35] him
[28:36] everything and he realized that when God
[28:41] gave Abraham the promise that after 400
[28:44] years I'll bring my people out of the
[28:48] bondage.
[28:50] He have that knowledge that he is the
[28:53] one to do it. But he didn't wait upon
[28:57] God. He tried to do it by
[29:01] himself. So is you and me. Anytime we
[29:06] try to do things by ourselves, we make a
[29:08] mess.
[29:09] And
[29:10] when Moses tried to do this by
[29:14] himself, he end up killing an
[29:18] Egyptian and he failed
[29:22] miserably. So you and me before God
[29:26] called us, we tried to make this world
[29:28] by ourself. We tried everything and we
[29:32] never was we never had any satisfaction
[29:35] in our hearts here because what we were
[29:38] doing was our own strength, our own
[29:42] effort. So we failed
[29:45] miserably. So did brother Moses. He
[29:48] failed
[29:50] miserably. And what happened?
[29:53] God has to take him
[29:55] away from Egypt to a desert. And it take
[30:02] God 40 years to knock away all the
[30:05] dances that Moses learned at the time
[30:09] with the with the Pharaoh. So after God
[30:13] took everything out from him, all the
[30:15] knowledge, the knowledge was good, but
[30:18] the knowledge itself without revelation,
[30:21] he couldn't do nothing.
[30:23] But one day whilst he was heading his
[30:27] father-in-law's
[30:29] um flock, he met a
[30:33] light and that light was
[30:36] burning. So when he met the light, that
[30:41] makes a difference. So is you and me.
[30:46] When we met the light of God for this
[30:48] day, that made a difference in our
[30:50] lives. And you have to meet this life
[30:53] for
[30:54] yourself. As Moses met God face to face
[30:58] in that burning bush. So every believer
[31:02] has to come face to face with that light
[31:04] of God, with that revelation because
[31:07] without you have meeting God for
[31:11] yourself, you cannot please him. It will
[31:14] just be a knowledge and that knowledge
[31:17] it cannot bring anything. The knowledge
[31:20] is good, don't get me wrong. But that
[31:24] knowledge will let
[31:26] you fall. It will let you do
[31:31] um I don't know what the knowledge alone
[31:34] without revelation without the dynamics
[31:38] is cannot bring the manifestation of the
[31:41] word to pass because without the
[31:44] dynamics the mechanics alone cannot make
[31:47] it. So Moses had all the knowledge but
[31:51] until he met the light for his day he
[31:56] couldn't achieve anything he became a
[31:59] murderer and he ran for his life so is
[32:03] you and me without us by the grace of
[32:07] God coming in contact with this word of
[32:10] God Jason for a day our life was in a
[32:14] mess some of us adulteress all kind of
[32:18] life. But the light of God came to us
[32:22] and what it changed us from the inside
[32:24] out and we became a new creation in
[32:27] Christ and our life has never been the
[32:30] same ever since he came to our life and
[32:33] is the same yesterday, today and
[32:37] forever.
[32:39] Amen.
[32:41] And just like
[32:43] Moses, when he had that light, he was a
[32:47] leader. Is that right? And he have
[32:52] confidence in God that he met on that
[32:56] burning
[32:57] bush. So no matter how the enemy come to
[33:00] attack him, he can look back and see
[33:04] I've seen God for myself and that God
[33:07] that I saw is unchangeable God. He will
[33:10] never change. He's the same yesterday,
[33:12] today and forever. So he trusts God so
[33:15] much that he led them through the
[33:19] wilderness and God did a mighty work
[33:21] through him. But the people following
[33:24] him, most of them apart from Joshua and
[33:28] Caleb, they did not have faith. They
[33:33] have that knowledge. They know God can
[33:35] do it. And it was just a hope that they
[33:39] have because
[33:52] As I said the other time, hope just can
[33:56] go on until hope is always looking
[34:00] for some room. It goes only a fire but
[34:04] it doesn't go all the way like a hawk
[34:07] cannot go all the way like eagle. So
[34:10] faith goes beyond hope. So they were
[34:13] hoping this will happen and God fed
[34:16] them. They were baptized in the Red Sea.
[34:19] He fed the mana from heaven. He did all
[34:22] those things. But there was no faith
[34:24] mixed up with it. So when it came to
[34:29] Kadis Bernier, they
[34:32] what they all of them failed
[34:36] God. But Joshua and Caleb was of
[34:40] different spirit.
[34:42] They have confidence in God. It was
[34:45] revealed to them. The difference was the
[34:49] revelation. It became so crystal clear
[34:51] to them Joshua and Caleb that their God
[34:54] is unchangeable God. And they have
[34:57] confidence that God that brought them
[34:59] through the Red Sea, fed them with mana
[35:02] from heaven, gave them water from
[35:04] smitten rock. That God is able to
[35:07] deliver those uncircumcised Philistine.
[35:10] Even though they were giant and big more
[35:13] than them, they look like grasshoppers
[35:15] to them. But they didn't consider that.
[35:18] So tonight, what is it bothering you? It
[35:21] doesn't matter how big the storm is. It
[35:25] doesn't matter what you think you are
[35:27] going through. Don't look at that giant
[35:30] circumstance, but look to the promise of
[35:33] God. Because he said, "I am God and I
[35:36] change not." He never change. is the
[35:39] same yesterday, today and forever. What
[35:43] good is historical God to you? If God
[35:46] cannot do what he did back in the time
[35:49] of Abraham and all those things in our
[35:51] lives, then what is that God to you? But
[35:54] because he's unchangeable God and he's
[35:57] the same yesterday, today and forever
[35:59] and he never change his ways. If we
[36:02] follow that pattern and have confidence
[36:05] in his word, he will do it again and
[36:07] again and again and again because he
[36:10] will never fail nor forsake you. He's
[36:12] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[36:15] Your friends will fail you, your parents
[36:17] will fail you. Everything, your job,
[36:20] everything will fail you. But God can
[36:22] never fail. Because there's two things
[36:24] God cannot do. He cannot lie. He cannot
[36:27] fail. He's unchangeable God. And he
[36:30] makes all things beautiful to them that
[36:33] life him because his word is eternal.
[36:36] Amen. Because God is infinite God,
[36:38] sister. He's not like you and
[36:41] me. Because we are
[36:44] finite. We can make decision today and
[36:47] then we change it. Even like um my
[36:51] family going to Ghana, they bought their
[36:54] ticket and everything because they don't
[36:57] know tomorrow. They are supposed to
[37:00] arrive like yesterday in the capital Ara
[37:04] and take another plane to the second
[37:07] capital. But because they don't know the
[37:10] future once about a day for them to go,
[37:14] they have a thing from the travel agents
[37:16] that the flight is cancelled. So they
[37:20] have to they were forced to go and sleep
[37:22] over in the capital before they go. But
[37:26] they made their plans thinking that they
[37:29] will be arriving yesterday and then go
[37:32] the same day. But they
[37:35] couldn't see it before it happened. But
[37:38] God being infinite God knew all those
[37:42] circumstances will happen. So is you and
[37:45] me. Even right now we are sitting here.
[37:48] God knew before the foundations of the
[37:51] world that we all going to be seated
[37:53] here. And he knew every thought that
[37:57] will pass through any of us our mind. He
[38:00] knows even the hairs on your head. He he
[38:04] knows everything. And because he knows
[38:06] everything when he put his promises in
[38:09] this word of God um Daniel that word
[38:13] cannot fail because he knows today from
[38:16] tomorrow. So his word is
[38:19] final. He has a final word and that
[38:23] final word is this word of God and it's
[38:25] absolute because it cannot fail. When
[38:29] you put your confidence in this word of
[38:32] God, it can it can never fail because
[38:37] it's God's word. It's God's promises and
[38:40] he is not like you and me. He's
[38:43] infinite. Is omniresent, omni signs. He
[38:47] knows everything. He covers the entire
[38:50] world. So our confidence is not in one
[38:54] another, but it's in God's word. It's in
[38:57] God's promises. Because if you look to a
[39:00] man, a man will fail you. But God will
[39:03] never fail you. And he's unchangeable
[39:06] God. He's the same yesterday, today, and
[39:09] forever. He said, "I am God, and I
[39:12] change not." Amen. Our God is awesome.
[39:17] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[39:21] forever. Hallelujah. Just bear with me.
[39:23] Just Hallelujah. And
[39:28] back to the same word that I said that
[39:32] unless God reveals something to you, you
[39:36] might have that
[39:38] knowledge, but you cannot bring it to
[39:42] pass. It has to be crystal clear. It has
[39:47] to be done by
[39:49] revelation. Because if you look at
[39:53] David and his brothers and
[39:57] Saul, Saul and David
[40:01] brothers have the knowledge. They know
[40:05] 100% clear that God can deliver them
[40:09] from golad that they were facing. They
[40:13] have that knowledge. But the knowledge
[40:16] alone was not
[40:18] enough. Even in this message a lot of
[40:22] people has accumulated the knowledge
[40:24] they have knowledge that this has to
[40:27] happen that had to happen that had to
[40:29] happen but because they it's not fully
[40:32] revealed to them they are not able to
[40:34] manifest that word of God and it make
[40:38] the people wonder and that's why even a
[40:41] lot of people has gone out from the word
[40:42] of God because they know this has to
[40:45] happen that has to happen but it's not
[40:48] happening
[40:49] And they fighting. They doing everything
[40:52] trying like
[40:53] Bam, the people that Elijah told them to
[40:57] shout more. They doing everything to
[41:00] bring it back. But they
[41:01] can't. God has to come and reveal it to
[41:06] you. And when he reveals it to you, you
[41:09] are settled.
[41:12] It doesn't matter how
[41:15] um how dim it looks. it will come to
[41:20] pass. So back to what I'm saying, Saul
[41:26] have the
[41:27] knowledge. David brothers have the
[41:29] knowledge but it wasn't revealed to
[41:31] them. So when David went there and that
[41:37] uncircumcised Philistine believe begins
[41:39] to boast, he boast at the wrong time
[41:43] because even though as said it's not the
[41:47] size of the dog, it's a bite in the
[41:50] dog. Most David was there very tiny 12
[41:54] or 14 year old boy or 16. I I forgot the
[41:58] exact age he was. And then Saul the most
[42:02] tall and his brothers big and big and
[42:05] big but they didn't have a bite because
[42:08] they didn't have a revelation. And then
[42:10] David said why do you allow this
[42:12] uncircumcised Philistine to defile the
[42:15] army of the living God. They said that
[42:17] you are too known you what can you do?
[42:19] He said I have confidence. It was
[42:22] revealed to David and based on that his
[42:26] experience with God before gave him the
[42:30] confidence that if God could deliver
[42:33] bear when he came for my sheep to me he
[42:38] was able to deliver this lion can he
[42:42] deliver he's more than able to deliver
[42:44] this uncircumcised Philistine in my hand
[42:48] and all his brothers were angry with him
[42:52] they think he's too no he doesn't know
[42:53] what he's talking about sometimes that's
[42:56] why the people see you when you say you
[42:58] are Christian because they have watered
[43:01] the word of God so low that when you say
[43:05] you are Christian they don't even know
[43:06] what kind of Christian that you are they
[43:08] think that you are those um what am I
[43:11] saying those denomination Christians
[43:14] that have made the word of God of man
[43:16] effect so when you say that you are
[43:18] Christian they don't even know what kind
[43:20] of you say to you you are unless the
[43:22] people get close to you
[43:25] then by your actions
[43:28] and the way you move the way you do
[43:30] things then they realize oh this this
[43:33] sister this sister this brother has been
[43:36] with Jesus because your actions when
[43:40] they get close to you your actions and
[43:42] the way you do things they realize that
[43:45] hey this is not that Christianity that
[43:47] we talking out there this a different
[43:50] form of Christianity that we talking
[43:51] about this has the real thing. He has a
[43:54] real the real the the real thing. They
[43:58] realize that there's something special
[44:00] about you. You are not just a nominal
[44:03] person out there claiming Christianity
[44:06] when they you can even they can um what
[44:10] do I say that they said that they can
[44:12] put that um their hand their hand is
[44:16] like I don't know what what word to use
[44:18] anyway but it's just going it's not
[44:20] coming that's fine they
[44:23] have make Christianity so low so
[44:27] cheap because of the pulpit the pastor
[44:32] who will not tell them the truth. They
[44:36] after their pocket, not after their
[44:38] soul. And because of that, they have
[44:41] make it so cheap like chicken. But you
[44:44] are an eagle. It takes years to produce
[44:46] one eagle. And God has taken years to
[44:50] build you up. No wonder. It says that a
[44:54] time will come those foolish virgin will
[44:57] try to come and get oil and you cannot
[45:00] give them that oil. It's too late for
[45:03] all these years that you have been
[45:05] sitting under the word of God. Faith
[45:07] cometh by hearing and hearing of the
[45:10] word of God. So God has been building
[45:12] your faith all these years here little
[45:14] there little little precept upon here.
[45:17] So little little to bring you to that
[45:19] stage and they just want to get it right
[45:22] away. It doesn't work that way. So, back
[45:26] to what I'm trying to say. Because it
[45:29] was not revealed to David brothers and
[45:34] Saul, they couldn't achieve anything.
[45:37] But
[45:38] because David had met God for
[45:42] himself and it was revealed to him, he
[45:45] was able to defeat that golad. and is
[45:49] the same now and then. You must have
[45:55] revelation. You must have the token. You
[45:59] must have the Holy Ghost. You must be
[46:01] born again. Without fully being born
[46:05] again, without full revelation of the
[46:07] word of God in your soul, you cannot
[46:10] make it. The death angel will pass by.
[46:14] He's only passing by those who are
[46:16] sealed with the Holy Ghost. And because
[46:20] there's a seed of God in you, you can be
[46:23] what? Reborn. The non seed. There's
[46:26] nothing to quicken them. And our God is
[46:30] the same yesterday, today, and
[46:34] forever.
[46:36] Hallelujah. Amen.
[46:49] In every
[46:52] age,
[46:54] God has a
[46:58] vindicated of his word. He has that word
[47:02] of God that has to be what? Made
[47:04] manifest.
[47:06] And the people that recognize that word
[47:09] for their age, they are God's children
[47:12] in that
[47:13] age. And it doesn't matter
[47:17] how their outward life may look to
[47:23] be. They can be a prostitute. They can
[47:26] be thieves. They can be all kind of
[47:28] things that you can talk about. But
[47:31] don't let the outside cover fool you.
[47:35] But if there's a seed of God in them,
[47:38] when they meet the words for their age,
[47:41] something in them will respond.
[47:44] I believe that's what happened that
[47:46] woman at the
[47:47] well. She was prostitute and married
[47:51] about five times and she was even living
[47:54] with somebody's
[47:57] husband. If it was here to be here, some
[48:00] people would go and make their nose like
[48:01] that. and her life was so bad she can't
[48:06] even go and get the water with the
[48:08] regular people. They have to be
[48:10] separated and go at a different
[48:13] times. But down deep in her heart, there
[48:17] was a seed of God.
[48:20] So when it came in contact with the word
[48:24] for the day, she
[48:27] recognized and said, "We know when the
[48:31] Messiah cometh, he will do these
[48:34] things." And her life was never the
[48:38] same. She left the presence of God, the
[48:42] presence of Jesus Christ, a different
[48:45] woman. And the woman types the church.
[48:49] So the bride of Christ any seed of God
[48:53] it doesn't matter their proud life that
[48:56] they live once they come in contact of
[48:59] that revealed word of God their life
[49:02] will never be the same. There has to be
[49:05] a change from the old life. There has to
[49:08] be a change from the way they were
[49:11] before. You can never live the same life
[49:15] when Christ really comes into your
[49:18] heart. He will change you from the
[49:20] inside out.
[49:23] He will change your
[49:25] desires. He will change the things.
[49:28] That's why the things I used to do, I do
[49:31] them no more because I have been contact
[49:34] with the reveal word of the hour. I've
[49:38] come in contact with the my maker. The
[49:40] one who created the whole heaven and
[49:42] earth. He lives in my heart. He lives in
[49:46] you. So it's him living his life through
[49:51] you. And when that happens, Natasha, you
[49:54] become a hot potato in the hands of the
[49:57] enemy, of the devil. Why? Because the
[49:59] Bible says, "Sons and daughters of God
[50:01] are led by the spirit of God." So nobody
[50:04] can determine your
[50:06] move. You can be here today and be here
[50:09] tomorrow. You can say, "I'm doing this
[50:11] and then God will change and you do
[50:13] something different." So your life is
[50:16] not
[50:16] um like the organized churches. Your
[50:20] life is not trapped because sons and
[50:24] daughters of God are led by the spirit
[50:28] of God.
[50:30] Amen. and it leads you and it guide you
[50:34] and sometimes it makes you maybe make a
[50:37] quick
[50:38] decision and later I realize that if
[50:42] something has not revealed to you to
[50:44] make that decision you are could have
[50:46] got into a big
[50:48] catastrophe because you are being led by
[50:51] the spirit of Christ
[50:53] that is what has led us all these years
[50:55] and that God is able to do it again and
[50:59] again and Again and again, he will do it
[51:02] again. No matter what, he will do it
[51:05] again. Hasn't he promised? He promised
[51:07] I'll be with you. Even in you until the
[51:11] consumation of the time, he's with you
[51:15] and even in you. He will never leave you
[51:19] nor forsake you because he's the same
[51:21] yesterday, today, and forever. His word
[51:25] is eternal truth. He's God and he
[51:28] changes not. He will provide all your
[51:31] needs. He will take care of you. Amen.
[51:35] No matter what the circumstances, he'll
[51:37] be there for you. He is on time. God, he
[51:41] may not come when you want him to be,
[51:44] but he will be there right on time
[51:48] because he has always been on time. He's
[51:50] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[51:54] No matter what comes into our life, he
[51:57] is controlling us. Hallelujah. Our God
[52:00] is good. Amen. He's the same yesterday,
[52:04] today, and forever. He's on time God.
[52:09] Praise our
[52:11] God.
[52:12] Hallelujah. Um, another person I'm going
[52:16] to talk about is brother Peter.
[52:23] Peter was a
[52:26] spokesman and he believe
[52:29] God
[52:31] but he has the
[52:34] knowledge. He knew Jesus Christ was God.
[52:39] He been with him for three and a half
[52:42] years. He have that confidence has
[52:45] everything.
[52:48] But when it get to a
[52:51] place when the battle gets so rough and
[52:56] in that garden when those
[53:01] um the the Jews and the high priests and
[53:06] the rest when they are came to when
[53:10] Judas Judas came and give him that case
[53:14] and they saw the Lord Jesus eyes with
[53:17] the assault and
[53:18] everything. Abraham explained that Peter
[53:22] might even be more
[53:23] sharper was more fighter than that
[53:28] people with the sword because he was
[53:31] able to just run away cut that man's
[53:33] head off right
[53:34] away. If that guy was more more fighter,
[53:40] Peter was more fighter than him. So he
[53:42] could able to what the knowledge cut
[53:44] that year off right away and the Lord
[53:48] put it back. So he did this with his
[53:52] knowledge not revelation not revealed to
[53:56] him and because that time things was not
[53:59] handed. That's why he said that when you
[54:01] are converted strengthen your your
[54:04] brethren and because he wasn't fully
[54:06] converted he was doing it out of
[54:09] knowledge. was that revelation part and
[54:13] it gets so bad that he said
[54:16] that I will go with you to the end. Yes,
[54:21] it's good that you go through the law to
[54:23] end but you cannot just go by the
[54:27] knowledge. It has to be crystal clear.
[54:31] Just like I'll come back to what I'm
[54:33] saying, but it's just like Ruth and Opa.
[54:36] Both of them promised to go with Naomi
[54:40] all the way to the end. But because the
[54:43] two of them, the difference was
[54:46] revelation. It was revealed to
[54:49] Ruth that wherever Naomi dies, she going
[54:54] to die with her.
[54:56] It wasn't revealed to Opa. So in the
[54:59] middle of the way, a little bit um what
[55:03] am I saying? Sweet talk, he she just
[55:06] accepted it and get
[55:08] back. But even though Ruth didn't know
[55:13] how Naomi can even get a have a baby,
[55:18] get a husband and have a baby for her to
[55:20] get married to raise her children. She
[55:23] know all none of them. something in her
[55:26] heart tell her to what? Follow her
[55:30] soul. And she followed her all the way
[55:33] to the end. And Peter made the same
[55:36] promise. I'll follow you all the way to
[55:39] the end. And the Lord said that the
[55:41] devil wanted to sift you, but I'll pray
[55:44] for you. I'll help you. Amen. So when
[55:47] the time came, he failed miserably. He
[55:52] denied God. 1 2 3. The third time when
[55:56] he heard the call
[55:58] crying, he was so sad and he
[56:02] repented. But the same
[56:04] Peter on the day of Pentecost.
[56:08] Amen.
[56:09] When
[56:11] that pillar of fire came back again,
[56:14] that's why you need to meet God for
[56:17] yourself. When that light came again, oh
[56:21] man, he wasn't scared. But someone was
[56:24] saying, "Where is Rabbi Jo?" He came
[56:27] forward and said that we are not drunk
[56:31] because it's just even before 3:00 in
[56:33] the morning. But this is that which was
[56:36] spoken of by the Joel that in the end
[56:40] your young man will see dreams. This
[56:42] what is happening is a fulfillment of
[56:45] that scripture. He was able to identify
[56:48] himself back to the word of God. So his
[56:52] sons and daughters of God, the true sons
[56:55] and daughters of God in every age, they
[56:59] have the eagle eye to recognize what God
[57:02] is doing in present tense of his
[57:06] ministry because you cannot please God
[57:09] in the past. You have to recognize what
[57:12] God is doing now. And Peter didn't
[57:17] scared of anyone
[57:19] again. Amen. He was able to what? faced
[57:24] those en those critics
[57:28] and he was so full of the Holy
[57:31] Ghost that on the gates of beautiful
[57:35] himself and
[57:37] um and John when they saw that um the
[57:42] he said silver and gold have I
[57:45] none but what I gave to you in the name
[57:48] of Jesus rise up and go and that
[57:52] rose up and begin to what? Go. And when
[57:56] it get to a place that the high priest
[57:59] and the rest, they were what? They were
[58:02] trying to um scare them. Said, "Don't
[58:07] use this name again." He said, "Should I
[58:09] listen to man or God?" So is you and me.
[58:13] When the enemy threatens you, what do
[58:16] you do? He said, "Should I listen to man
[58:20] or God?" And the people recognize that
[58:23] they have they were in Acts 4:12 said
[58:26] that they recognize that they are
[58:29] ignorant unlearned but they have been
[58:32] with Jesus. That's the evidence. That's
[58:35] the difference. The difference is you
[58:38] have been with Jesus. If you have been
[58:42] with Jesus, it will
[58:44] automatically manifest through you. You
[58:47] cannot push it by yourself. A a sheep is
[58:51] a sheep. He bear wool. You cannot turn a
[58:56] pig into a sheep. You can bath it,
[59:00] babysit, and dress at night. He's still
[59:03] going to go to his m. But a sheep will
[59:07] always bear the wool because he's a
[59:10] sheep. As simple as that. Nobody can put
[59:14] anybody's name and nobody can take
[59:17] anybody's name out. Salvation belongs
[59:20] only to the Lord Jesus Christ. It he
[59:23] didn't left it in anybody's hand. Him
[59:26] alone is the one that gives I'm going to
[59:29] read this to cap it up with what Peter
[59:33] did. But it said here in the putting on
[59:36] the whole armor of God. But when it come
[59:40] to 5, but when it come to rail down
[59:45] inside of him courage, he didn't have
[59:50] it. No, he didn't have it. When he had
[59:54] seen that word, now I'm not going to get
[59:58] religious.
[1:00:00] when he has seen that word made
[1:00:03] manifest by the people in the message.
[1:00:05] They have seen the manifestation of word
[1:00:07] by the prophet and know that that was
[1:00:10] the day for it to be there and seen it
[1:00:14] proved exactly what God said it will do.
[1:00:19] And then with all of his intellectual
[1:00:21] strength, all of his physical
[1:00:25] being, that's the way it is today.
[1:00:30] Men who just walk up and put their name
[1:00:33] on a book. Those who shake hands with
[1:00:36] the minister and when it comes to
[1:00:38] standing in the office and the boss pass
[1:00:41] a drink, they will take it. They afraid
[1:00:44] of their
[1:00:47] job. It comes to paying
[1:00:50] tithes into the into your church. you
[1:00:53] are afraid to do it because you are
[1:00:57] afraid you'll serve to death and and
[1:01:01] know God made the promise that he will
[1:01:04] take care of you all these
[1:01:09] things. So it doesn't matter
[1:01:12] how your coffers is
[1:01:14] left don't be scared to pay your
[1:01:17] sight. Amen. You're never going to be
[1:01:20] starved to death. He said that David
[1:01:23] said that I have been young and I've
[1:01:26] grown. I've never seen a righteous
[1:01:30] forsaken nor his descendants ever
[1:01:33] begging bread to eat. I know we are in
[1:01:37] economic
[1:01:39] turmoil. Everything because of Trump
[1:01:41] tariffs is shaking up and down. But
[1:01:45] let's have confidence in God and let's
[1:01:48] put God first just like that um that
[1:01:54] woman who was only left with his last
[1:01:57] food her last food to eat and died with
[1:02:00] her son when Elijah said bake me a cake
[1:02:05] first. I believe it was revealed to that
[1:02:08] lady. She was so certain of God. She was
[1:02:12] so sad. There was something about Elijah
[1:02:15] and it was revealed to her. So she
[1:02:18] didn't care to give her last food that
[1:02:21] she was
[1:02:23] man. Braham said that get to that place.
[1:02:27] You're going to be more sincere. When
[1:02:29] you know that the next day you and your
[1:02:32] son are going to die. There's no food to
[1:02:35] eat. Your last food.
[1:02:38] She prayed all
[1:02:40] night but she was certain of
[1:02:43] God. When she saw that prophet spoke,
[1:02:47] she gave everything to him and me never
[1:02:52] run down in a household during that
[1:02:55] time. So is believers. It doesn't matter
[1:03:00] what. Let's put God
[1:03:02] first by paying our sight. Not only
[1:03:06] sight, our sacrifice. what you has done
[1:03:08] tonight. I believe God going to bless
[1:03:11] you. It's raining. You sacrificed and
[1:03:14] you came to here. I believe you never
[1:03:16] going to leave here the same. God
[1:03:19] supernaturally will do something to you.
[1:03:21] You might not see it physically, but
[1:03:23] he'll bless you. He'll bless you for
[1:03:26] your sacrifice. He never going to go in
[1:03:28] vain. There's no one that does something
[1:03:31] to God that is going to be in vain. He
[1:03:34] will take care of you. You might not
[1:03:36] know how. We might not as know when but
[1:03:39] he'll take care of you. He will do it
[1:03:41] again and again and again. One word from
[1:03:44] God is more than anything else. You
[1:03:47] might spoke so many things but maybe one
[1:03:49] for you
[1:03:51] tonight that it will help and bless you.
[1:03:56] So you are not here by chance as Simon's
[1:04:01] as the Bible said that Simon was led by
[1:04:05] the Holy Ghost to see the newborn child.
[1:04:08] So Anna was led by the Holy Ghost. The
[1:04:11] same Holy Ghost led you here tonight. If
[1:04:14] you have confidence in God, not in me,
[1:04:17] that the word of God where two or three
[1:04:20] are gathered in my name, I'll be in your
[1:04:23] midst. And God sent us a vindicator
[1:04:25] prophet that said that when we come to
[1:04:29] church and we have a specific time to be
[1:04:34] here, God always meet us before we even
[1:04:37] get here. So your confidence should be
[1:04:40] so much enriching in that word and you
[1:04:44] get what you
[1:04:47] expect. You always going to receive what
[1:04:50] you expect. If you expect God, you will
[1:04:53] hear from him.
[1:04:55] And if you came here like this, you go
[1:04:58] back like this because you never going
[1:05:01] to leave here the same. Either you're
[1:05:03] going to be drawn to God or you're going
[1:05:06] to live here miserable. It's always been
[1:05:09] the case. You can never live in God's
[1:05:11] presence the same way you came. He's the
[1:05:14] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:05:19] Hallelujah. Praise
[1:05:22] God. Thank you. And I believe
[1:05:27] that the same thing is happening in our
[1:05:32] midst now.
[1:05:34] Now because we have a vindicated
[1:05:37] prophet, his name is William Myron
[1:05:41] Braham. He prophesied in 1950s that
[1:05:45] there is going to be American pope. And
[1:05:48] he's here.
[1:05:50] Amen. It's happening. Before you were
[1:05:53] say it is coming. It is coming and now
[1:05:57] we have seen it here. Everything that
[1:06:00] God told that man has happened to the
[1:06:02] dot.
[1:06:04] And always I was telling people even
[1:06:07] before he came to office I was telling
[1:06:09] them that it can be him
[1:06:12] because I read and they were saying that
[1:06:15] in two times those who have been leading
[1:06:19] that has become the chosen as the pope.
[1:06:23] So I said hey maybe it could be him
[1:06:24] because he wasn't among the favorite but
[1:06:27] something was say he it could be him but
[1:06:30] now he's
[1:06:31] here
[1:06:33] but
[1:06:35] what about couple of days Mr.
[1:06:39] Trump who said that within two days he
[1:06:44] comes off he's going to solve that
[1:06:45] Ukraine and Russia war has come to the
[1:06:48] wall he realized he can't do it so he's
[1:06:51] now proposing for the new pope to come
[1:06:55] and solve that
[1:06:57] problem and I don't know if he's accept
[1:07:00] it and he solved that what's going to
[1:07:01] happen he's man of peace now but the
[1:07:04] Bible said that where they said peace
[1:07:06] peace peace Then sudden destruction
[1:07:10] comes. Is that right? And Abraham
[1:07:12] Lincoln said that in times of peace you
[1:07:16] prepare for a
[1:07:17] war. So what
[1:07:20] time are we living in
[1:07:24] sin? What time are we living in? Because
[1:07:29] remember as our former pastor said the
[1:07:32] age always what? Um it always overlap.
[1:07:38] It doesn't just go in like that. It
[1:07:42] always overlap. So
[1:07:45] remember the Jews were blinded so the
[1:07:49] Gentiles can be drafted can come in. Now
[1:07:53] the Gentiles are being blinded so that
[1:07:56] the Jews will come in because the um
[1:08:01] civilization travel with the with the
[1:08:05] gospel and the west here has rejected
[1:08:09] Christ. So it's a blinding of the
[1:08:11] Gentiles to bring the Jews in. So
[1:08:15] everything is in place.
[1:08:18] And as Daniel when he read Jeremiah
[1:08:23] writings, it put him under
[1:08:25] desperation. It's a desperate hour,
[1:08:29] brother, sister. It's not a time to
[1:08:32] joke. It's time to be
[1:08:34] desperate. It's time to seek God. It's
[1:08:38] time to seek his face. It's time to draw
[1:08:41] closer to him. I know you cannot do it,
[1:08:44] but you do your part. He said, "Whoever
[1:08:47] thirst after righteousness shall also
[1:08:49] what? Be
[1:08:51] filled." He's going to fill you. Fill my
[1:08:54] cup, oh Lord. If you know that you need
[1:08:58] a refilling, ask him to refill
[1:09:02] you. You need that. Whatever you need,
[1:09:04] you ask him. He'll grant it to you
[1:09:07] because it's a a lossia age. It's a
[1:09:12] lukewarm. It's the age that spirit is in
[1:09:14] the air, but you have to shake it off.
[1:09:18] Shake that laziness off and get to
[1:09:21] business. This is business time. It's
[1:09:25] not time to joke, brother, sister. Let's
[1:09:27] put every jokes aside and see God's
[1:09:30] face.
[1:09:32] And
[1:09:33] sometimes God allowed us to go through
[1:09:38] trials and
[1:09:41] persecution for a reason. And those
[1:09:44] trials and persecution, it comes for a
[1:09:49] purpose. Um and what God does is
[1:09:53] that the people that you have confidence
[1:09:56] in them, he's allow them to even what
[1:10:02] fail you come against you and see how
[1:10:06] you're going to react. I believe the
[1:10:08] same thing happened to Daniel. Daniel
[1:10:11] was a friend with the king but the king
[1:10:14] turned against him to put him in d in
[1:10:18] the lion's den. But
[1:10:21] Daniel never failed
[1:10:24] God. When that trials came, he believed
[1:10:29] God. He trusted in God. Just like the
[1:10:32] Hebrew children. When that tri comes,
[1:10:36] they have confidence in God. They
[1:10:39] believe God and God bring them out. So
[1:10:43] it is you and me.
[1:10:46] God allow us to go through some trials
[1:10:48] and persecutions. But when we are
[1:10:51] faithful, he'll bring us out. And some
[1:10:54] of the time the trials are so huge and
[1:10:57] so big, we don't know our way out. But
[1:11:01] stand still and see the salvation of
[1:11:04] God. Amen. There in the
[1:11:10] 19s church in Africa, Tanzania, I forgot
[1:11:13] the story. I forgot the name of the
[1:11:14] church or the country but happened in
[1:11:17] Africa if I'm wrong is it Tanzania or
[1:11:20] something they attacked the church
[1:11:24] because of the way they dressed and the
[1:11:26] message that they have and out of
[1:11:29] thousands they all deny the word of
[1:11:32] God. Is it the same thing happening
[1:11:35] coming on us now? Most of them ran away.
[1:11:39] They denied that faith and 500 of them
[1:11:43] were in
[1:11:44] prison and in the
[1:11:47] prison because they stood for word of
[1:11:51] God. The sisters they tried to cut their
[1:11:54] hair with a scissors it never cut.
[1:11:59] So much miracles happened in that prison
[1:12:02] that attracted the president and the
[1:12:05] people accepted Christ and they took
[1:12:08] them out from the prison. Is it the same
[1:12:12] thing around the
[1:12:14] corner? What time are we living in?
[1:12:18] Say when your tri comes, stand for
[1:12:23] Jesus. No matter what the condition,
[1:12:26] stand for God. As the Hebrew children
[1:12:29] stood, as Daniel stood, as Mis Shadrach,
[1:12:33] Mrs.
[1:12:34] Kabedu, God will do it again. He did it
[1:12:38] for them. He'll do it for you. Amen. You
[1:12:41] may not know how. You not don't know
[1:12:43] when, but he will do it for you again.
[1:12:46] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:12:49] forever. He is God who will never fail,
[1:12:52] who will never change. He will do God I
[1:12:55] change
[1:12:56] not. If those people stood by him and
[1:13:02] God stand by them. What about you and
[1:13:06] me? He'll never leave us nor forsake us.
[1:13:10] Let's stand for Jesus and he'll stand
[1:13:13] for you. Because remember, God is not
[1:13:17] looking at your mistakes.
[1:13:20] He's not looking
[1:13:22] at your fault. He's looking at you, your
[1:13:27] stand for
[1:13:29] him. Abraham talked about a
[1:13:32] dream about
[1:13:34] um I forgot the name is it something
[1:13:37] Corey and when he
[1:13:41] went in the have a dream in the presence
[1:13:43] of God they asked him after m whatever
[1:13:47] did you ever
[1:13:49] lied whilst you on the earth he said he
[1:13:53] thought on earth he's been honest about
[1:13:56] it but in the presence of that light he
[1:13:59] realized There are certain things he
[1:14:01] lied. Were you honest about everything?
[1:14:04] He thought he was the most honest person
[1:14:06] on the earth. But he realized in
[1:14:09] presence of that light when thrown he
[1:14:11] wasn't honest and he was about to be
[1:14:14] thrown to that place of darkness and a
[1:14:18] voice
[1:14:19] said, "Father, he stood for me while on
[1:14:23] this earth and I'm also standing for
[1:14:25] him."
[1:14:27] I want that testimony when my time comes
[1:14:32] that he will stand for me. That's why I
[1:14:35] have brother Anthony that when the time
[1:14:38] comes God will stand for me. Amen.
[1:14:41] Because a God will never change.
[1:14:45] Hallelujah. He's the same
[1:14:47] yesterday, today, and
[1:14:49] forever. Hallelujah. God is good all the
[1:14:54] time. So unless it's revealed to you,
[1:14:57] you cannot please God. Amen. And
[1:15:00] revelation means everything to a true
[1:15:04] believer more than anything
[1:15:07] else.
[1:15:09] Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen.
