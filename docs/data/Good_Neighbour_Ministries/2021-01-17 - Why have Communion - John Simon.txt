========================================
[Music] praise the lord and god bless you my dear brothers and sisters in christ dear ones that love the lord and worship him and serve him with all your hearts minds and souls may the lord bless us here today just that you might know we haven't we have not come together here for me to preach the word of god as such but we are here gathered in his name and by his divine order that we should have the lord's supper and we should come together and do this according to his plan and his command and we thank him for his precious words all praises wonderful name of course friends i want to uh just also remind you that this wednesday uh we are going to continue in our teaching on the seven church ages it will be lesson 41 and our topic will be is hell eternal let me repeat my topic will be is hell really eternal may god help us as we look into that subject this coming wednesday night at 7 30 may the lord bless you real good the following sunday or the sunday following we will be back speaking on the topic of the place where god put his name that will be part two of the place where god put his name and i believe we we will be really blessed as we open our hearts to receive the word of god that was given to us but as i've said before we are gutted here tonight my friends to bless his holy name to give him glory and honor we are here to take the lord's supper we are here to celebrate his life we are here to remember him and his words we are here to worship and lift up his mighty name now of course the apostle paul reminds us in the word of god that we should take communion and that we should take it together because of his command his sacred order or ordinance that he has left us with two ordinances water baptism and the lord supper called also communion and so my brothers we thank the lord for these two ordinances to remember how that he poured out his life as a substitute for our lives glory to god and how he poured out his blood to wash up wash us away from our sins oh precious is the flow that makes me white as snow no other fount i know nothing but the blood of jesus thank god the dying thief rejoiced to see that fountain in his day and now hear me i though while as he come to this table come into his presence and wash all my sins away thank god now we know that uh communion is a symbol it's symbolic and we understand the symbolic symbolism of what it is and he left it for us as a reminder to remind us of what he had done for us his glorious sacrifice that he made for us but this communion holds power not only as a symbol but as i said as a reminder that we should also invite the holy spirit of the living god to infuse us to indwell us to control us to lead us to guide us to teach us and bring us into all truth and show us things to come are we must invite the holy spirit that he might come especially at this time to examine our lives to go through our lives make up an accounting of the acts the deeds the thoughts the motives the motivations and that the great holy spirit of the living god will come to us and speak to us as his dear children and continue his work of constantly and consistently washing us by and through the endless marvelous grace of our lord jesus christ i am so thankful i'm so happy that we could be here tonight to celebrate and to magnify the great name of the lord jesus christ for the great work that he has done let us pray our gracious god and heavenly father we are so happy and overjoyed that we could draw nigh to you by the way of prayer and through the precious blood of christ may the great holy spirit of almighty god fill our hearts and our lives lord may the anointing of the holy spirit lord jesus come upon every believer wherever that believer may be yes lord there may be a way far away in africa there may be watching and listening from in india from where we receive notes and emails africa uh over in europe wherever south america lord all around the world oh jesus and and of late jamaica may the holy spirit lord jesus so bless us lord today as we come together around the blood and the bread which represents your broken body to commemorate the great act that you have done oh thou dying lamb thy precious blood shall never lose its power till all the ransom church of god are saved to sin no more father today we give all the praise the honor and the glory in jesus name amen and amen now i'd like to read out of the book of acts let us turn in our bibles to acts chapter 2 and we will read from verse 41. of course acts chapter 2 speaks of the coming of the holy spirit coming upon the believers on the day of pentecost and after the great question was asked men and brethren what mean it this and the bible tells us that peter stood up and he proceeded to answer the question and he said this is that this is the fulfillment of joel's prophecy how that god promised that he would pour out of his spirit upon all flesh all flesh with no partiality but only of course we know only the elected of god only the seed the germ the children of god the attributes of god would come into a new birth by the falling of that refreshing holy spirit soul cleansing rain amen and so that the great holy spirit peter was speaking of peter said this is that spoken of by the prophet joel we have received it and as he proceeded to preach the word and tell them of the end of pillars of fire and vapors of smoke coming of the lord they screamed out men and brethren what shall we do to be saved and he continued repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ hallelujah oh my and you will receive this also for it is unto you unto your children unto your children's children and as many as the lord our god amen shall call thanks be to god hallelujah now let's speak up our scripture then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day they were added unto them about three thousand souls they did not wait to have catechisms talk to them they did not wait to have fundamentals given to them they did not wait for some litany to be given to them but the bible tells us the same day that they heard the word it set their soul of fire with the spirit of god and the same day they wanted to be baptized in water in the name of jesus christ hallelujah amen and the same day there were added unto them about 3 000 souls and they continued in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and watch this listen and in communion and in the breaking of bread and in prayers hallelujah and fear that's holy reverential fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles and all that believed were together and had all things common and sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men as every man had need and they continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking of bread from house to house did eat there meet with gladness and singleness of heart praising god and having favor with all the people and the lord added to the church such as should be saved o blessed be his holy precious and wonderful name amen glory to god hallelujah praise his wonderful name now friends we know most folk believe that the lord's supper or communion ought to be taken in a church or at church and it's wonderful if we could be in this time in our various churches and having the lord's supper together with our brethren uh this great agape meal this love feast of the great holy spirit all greeting each allah praying praising celebrating glorifying with great exhilaration joy thrills and triumph of the holy spirit within our hearts however because of this covet virus that we are all experiencing around the world the various lockdowns and step home orders we have been hindered from coming together in large groups we have been hindered in worshipping together as we we should but of course the bible is a balanced healthy book it tells us to obey the higher powers any genuine true christian will listen to what the word of god says when it tells us even when we don't understand obey those that are above you whether that ruler king or or a governor is it is one that brings terror to your heart yet the bible tells us obey the higher powers of course that means as long as they don't take you away from god in the fact of stopping you from praising praying worshiping giving him glory other than that we are to render unto caesar what is caesar's and unto god that which belongs to god oh praise god's name so when the bible is properly understood it's a balanced book that points you to the truth and so here we find ourselves in this chaotic times in this perilous time as prophesied by the bible oh we find ourselves when troublesome times are here filling man's hearts with fear but freedom we all hold there now is at stake so what should we do humble your heart to god and ask him plead to him cry out to him o praise his name but subject and submit yourself to the higher powers and allow god to do the rest do what you can and then stand hallelujah do your best then let god do the rest let the holy spirit go to work we we we hardly give god the chance to work miracles in our lives because we are trying to work it out by our human wisdom and knowledge we are trying to solve every problem by our own strength our own abilities our own intelligence rather than surrendering it all to him and asking him for his divine help casting our cares upon him and letting him care for us oh praise god my brother my sister nevertheless in the midst of the plagues of egypt israel still had the passover in the midst of all the tracks and trails of the king esther down there in syria still had part time when they had the lord's supper i would call it that it wasn't called that then but my god she said i'm going to see the king doesn't matter what opposition is in my way i'm going to see the king we are presented my friends with these troubles trials and viruses which are everywhere but our faith and our trust is in the true and in the living god but thank god we are not only to have communion in a church building for we have read in our own bibles that after they were baptized they had meals together they act together they had marvelous times together but it also tells us that they went from house to house with the breaking of bread hallelujah oh my they had the lord's supper oh and with prayers seeking god and uniting their hearts together glorifying him so that their lives may manifest his word his written word as the living word living through them bringing glory and honor to his great almighty name and too glad that we are here today and that he lives forevermore for he lives in me he lives in you and together we are the sons and daughters of the living god in this present day and in the midst of this evil age hallelujah and we are proving to the world that we can still live godly in the midst of babylon we are proving to god that we can live pure pure in the midst of babylon like danielle like the four three boys with him we can live according to this word this bible we can trust him for he said his words will never ever fail hallelujah your taking the lord's supper is a real blessing and i'm blessed whenever i take the lord's supper because it's a powerful time it's a holy spirit time it's a jesus time it's a time when anything can happen all glory be to god a powerful time that we can spend with the lord hallelujah jesus said as often as you do this praise god hallelujah so he is encouraging us to remember him as often as possible or and by having to actively participate in this glorious wonderful event or ordinance it reminds us of what he has done for us thank god for his divine implementation of this ordinance that we might remember him oh aren't we not to remember him we must always remember him at the right times remember him when your days are dark and dismal remember him when you have the happy wonderful days remember him when you are young and strong but remember also your creator as the scripture said in the days of your youth for when the evil days come hallelujah and the years draw nigh that you become old remember jesus my friends remember him when you have no money in your pocket remember him or when you maybe have a lot of money still remember him remember him when you don't have a job remember him when you do have a job remember him in every situation remember jesus because of what he has done for us now how are we supposed to take the lord's supper first of all in the scriptures paul said let a man examine himself first of all you should make your heart right with god as we are here now we we're about to take the lord's supper while i'm yet speaking to you start talking in your heart to yourself amen and make your heart right with god because communion genuine holy ghost communion administered by an anointed servant of the risen christ can heal you right now wherever you are it can heal you or in disobedience in rebellion and refusal to repent it can also kill you let me repeat genuine communion can heal you while you're taking it while you're listening to it or it can kill you amen so while i'm yet speaking the word if you're sick receive your healing say oh lord may i receive my healing now i claim my deliverance now i claim my miracle now i claim a touch just to have one touch from you lord may my faith touch the hem of your garment and i know i know it will make me whole put your faith in him right now my friends and he will make you whole amen praise god listen to what paul said in the very word of god for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he'd break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do sure the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man woman examine themselves and so let them eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he or she that eat it and drink it unworthily ease it and drink it damnation to themselves not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sick or sickly among you and many are dead or asleep for if we should judge ourselves we should not be judged amen wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat wait tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come to come not together onto condemnation and the rest will i set in order when i come amen hallelujah now in this scripture paul was writing to a people whose hearts was were not really right with god they were taking the lord's supper and they were taking it when they were hungry and so that caused them to eat the bread and to begin drinking the wine as if they were at a buffet and not with true reverence and remembrance of the lord jesus christ himself therefore paul rebuked them and then he urged them when you come together for the lord's supper the first thing you ought to do is to examine yourself before partaking may we examine ourselves while we are still in the process of this service here today may we search our own hearts may we act as paul said soberly let us come decently let us come righteously and reverently and not into god's presence boisterously but come with the sacredness as this ordinance requires of us and we ought to come that way we must eat at our homes make sure you you you take the lord's supper not when you're hungry so you want a large piece of the bread and you want a great cup of the wine but to come with order come with reverence sacredness in the house of the lord and i believe we ought to listen to this and obey this because as paul said there are consequences serious consequences for taking this bread and this wine as if you were at a buffet are at some normal persons dining table we are here to take not man supper but we are here to partake of the lord's supper now you say well rather simon paul said let a man a woman a person examine themselves how do we examine ourselves well first of all stop and pray stop and pray begin to examine your own heart in the quietness of your heart with the inner peace of god with the stillness of the holy spirit blessed quietness holy quietness oh may the great holy spirit speak to your heart to your need to your desire as you pray to god and in praying begin to ask god to reveal to you if you have any unconfessed sins within your life you might have even forgot you might not have thought of it or you might have thought it was not sin you didn't even know it was wrong but ask the holy spirit to remind you and reveal to you so that you may confess your sins and your faults your mistakes in the presence of the living god as the apostle peter said repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ not in the name of father son and holy ghost for father son and holy ghost are not even names they're only titles it's one name and peter knew that so he didn't repeat the just repeat the words of jesus over the person he said repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for this is the promise hallelujah thank god forevermore and this that promise is still in force it is still in power today as we surrender our hearts and lives to him ask the lord to cleanse you with his precious blood ask the holy spirit ask god for refreshing infilling of his blessed holy spirit to come to your life oh praise god i remember an old song that says something like when i think about the cross where my savior had to die when i think about the cross where my savior had to die oh my friends when we come to take the lord's supper let's think about the cross that all rugged cross and well god is healed may we lift our minds eye and look away to jesus i would say to you my friends that we ought to close our eyes would you do that right now just close your eyes whatever country whatever land wherever you are in your living room wherever you might be stop close your eyes think about him see him hanging there see him bleeding see him dying and see him as the blood pours out from his hands his side and from his feet look at him look at him in your mind's eye breathing dying there and begin to thank him let's start taking him thank him for being your savior my savior our substitute the one who took our place he took the anger of god he took the judgment of god he bore our sins away that all our sins may be blotted out from against us hanging there dying for me and dying for you oh my friends take him for finding you the great eagle flew over the rotten stinking barnyard of the sin-cursed world and screamed out a voice calling you call you out think about his love think about his goodness now give him your life say lord i give you my life as a living sacrifice i give my life to you all over again amen oh hallelujah now my friends let us open our eyes and let us at this point take the lord's supper thank god for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he'd break it amen he took bread praise god he took the bread and the bible says and he break it amen and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me wherever you are with just a piece of that bread let us partake together remembering what i've said before speak to him in your heart what is what do you want what do you desire forgiveness of sins healing of your body healing of some person persons wherever whatever god knows your heart and the sincere prayer faithful prayer of a righteous person avail it much let us partake together thank you lord thank you jesus for this which represents your body for by your stripes we are healed thank you lord you are wounded for our transgressions bruise for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon you and by your stripes we are now healed right now in jesus name after the same manner also he took the cup when he hits up saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me maybe partake of this wonderful blessed emblem which represents it is not wine turned into the blood of jesus it is actual wine and not grape juice not pepsi not some other drink but wine which represents the quickening power of the holy spirit let us partake of this which represents the blood that flowed from his precious side for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord praise god may the holy spirit bless each one comfort each one in this great hour now i want to encourage you to say this prayer with me very important again maybe may you close your eyes wherever you are and say this prayer after me in faith believing god that he will do what he has said say in the name of jesus i now apply the blood the holy spirit and the body or the revealed word of jesus christ i apply it to my life i apply the holy spirit to the lives of my family i apply the token for our safety for our finances i apply the holy spirit for good neighbor ministries and for my pastor i apply the holy spirit to my
