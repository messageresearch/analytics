[5:59] less Stephen both silent was expressing
[6:03] our initial as crossing was back up a
[6:07] number of years oh my it has been a
[6:24] tremendous blessing it is a game changer
[6:32] of so to speak you have to kind of
[6:37] understand where I came from and what
[6:40] what is in our area know for me to like
[6:46] this a lot of lot of it was a lot of
[6:50] spiritual auction any matters
[6:55] and here here this morning
[6:58] your fruit of his legs what he is talk
[7:04] not only topic but what he is
[7:08] exemplified were you and thus her degree
[7:15] knows you're a very generous
[7:21] congregation of people thank you to say
[7:25] the very least
[7:26] I enjoyed Saturday morning with brothers
[7:31] that were able from the big event or
[7:35] perhaps the only day of the week that
[7:37] they had risked additionally and which
[7:40] was sure that risk would be me thank you
[7:44] so much the recipient of a Bureau of
[7:53] your economist just appreciate it so
[7:57] very much once again you're a very
[8:01] generous very kind and thoughtful group
[8:03] of people they the first song that the
[8:10] mic was leading you in was about a
[8:14] dangerous country think of the billions
[8:20] of dollars that are spent cosmetic for
[8:25] people to or the partisans their
[8:33] very ancient process it is because
[8:39] people appreciate you and the bigger the
[8:44] spray for the visions and
[8:47] that of youth holes and and it's very
[8:52] comforting very very cover to realize
[8:55] that when Bertha Wilson impre-- comes in
[9:07] a few weeks he has been asked before
[9:10] because now I know anyone that perhaps
[9:18] brother side can plant every my brother
[9:22] was introduced and he super you know
[9:27] that and he just loves to worship up for
[9:31] solo lasting whatever use all the weight
[9:35] you're dancing and playing the
[9:36] tambourine and there's just what are you
[9:40] doing this so much he said well can we
[9:53] spend and read over just a few
[9:56] scriptures and Mike it's not let me
[10:01] forget perhaps make this statement about
[10:09] all these wooden table Kevin Murphy a
[10:12] husband a lot of you
[10:25] we turn to first Peter chapter three
[10:31] verse number ten and if this was kind of
[10:38] the wording that this was put in in a
[10:41] question for interrogative there's not a
[10:46] human being that has the ability to
[10:49] think that was not the answer in the
[10:51] Huracan do you love Molly do you love
[10:57] good days you know so often at least in
[11:01] America perhaps I'm not indicating to
[11:05] you personally whether the human
[11:07] community how are you doing how's your
[11:09] day going oh it's a bad day now you may
[11:13] have not ever said that you have said it
[11:16] yesterday but this is presented to us or
[11:23] he think we'll love life and see good
[11:26] days here is the the the solution to
[11:34] that the answer let him refrain his
[11:36] tongue from evil and his lips that they
[11:41] speak no God let him refrain his tongue
[11:46] from evil
[11:47] and ladies live speak of God Heavenly
[11:51] Father thank you for this morning thank
[11:54] you for brothers and sisters silently
[11:56] thank you for the incredible leadership
[12:00] has story shield the agape love that
[12:06] emanates from them and thank you for the
[12:10] the Sheep of what that is present this
[12:14] morning that is in those
[12:17] that is allowing the shipper d24 of the
[12:21] oven forged in action
[12:24] father we thank you made the grade of
[12:28] eternity not only come here in life is a
[12:34] word in every individual heart but
[12:37] wherever you're elected ones and
[12:40] redeemed laws are gathered together
[12:42] may the great of heaven we so profoundly
[12:47] present and providing the Amen of the
[12:51] Word of God to every individual and
[12:54] their particular needs and situations
[13:29] and this has been a staple of my
[13:36] attitude not only to the Lord important
[13:40] but it's a staple in my attitude about
[13:44] life and this is what I said from the
[13:48] amplified record for we are God's
[13:52] handiwork his workmanship recreated in
[13:57] christ jesus born anew but we may do
[14:02] those good works which God predestined
[14:06] both for us taking paths which he
[14:12] prepared ahead of time that really
[14:17] greatly
[14:18] the past that he prepared ahead of time
[14:22] this was not randomly done
[14:26] this was done in eternity he meant that
[14:34] we should walk in them that we should
[14:37] live it been living the good life which
[14:42] he prearranged and made ready for us
[14:45] later
[14:50] humans have this propensity to justify
[14:54] what our if it's a a condition applied
[14:59] in our life with we it's not hard to
[15:03] find justifiable causes justifiable
[15:06] reasons of that we were experiencing
[15:09] what we're experiencing but when we put
[15:13] that up against Scripture and this is
[15:17] what God's attitude toward you toward
[15:22] his children and you'll hear brother
[15:26] Gilbert all the kids toward his kids
[15:29] soon that is his attitude toward your
[15:33] life toward my life and maybe this
[15:38] attitude kind of emanates and has its
[15:41] roots in the price that was paid on
[15:46] behalf of our us the price that Calvary
[15:53] was affording at Calvary in order for
[15:57] your life to be retained ransom
[16:00] reconcile or it was God in Christ
[16:04] reconciling the world on that your
[16:08] Center
[16:09] that was a legal work may be done a
[16:13] justifiable the legal work and there's
[16:18] nothing that enemy can do about this
[16:20] Satan has absolutely no grounds or in
[16:25] doing actually much of what he does
[16:29] today
[16:30] puffins are bragging about no means so
[16:35] let's look at the Sun some of the
[16:39] statements the scripture provides about
[16:42] this entity the closer of God and
[16:46] humanity would you mind pokin with me in
[16:49] Hebrews chapter 2 verse 14 and if you
[16:53] don't mind just to keep the mind we'll
[16:55] cut the hand ending with you and we'll
[16:57] look at a few other places in scripture
[17:06] I realized that but I read these over
[17:14] and over again it was said Michael
[17:18] Jordan of basketball thing and that he
[17:28] would it would be hours into those hours
[17:31] as we would say in the genome price
[17:34] practice and we've all expense most of
[17:38] the statement that practice makes
[17:39] perfect
[17:41] only fits perfect
[17:44] and it's a perfect of course it'll sort
[17:47] of imperfection now this is this is an
[17:51] astounding statement to me because
[17:54] growing up around wonderful people
[17:56] Christians godly people I did this and
[18:03] look at these marvelous and majestic
[18:06] works since therefore these his children
[18:10] share in flesh and blood in the physical
[18:14] nature of human beings
[18:16] he misses God himself in a similar
[18:21] manner vertook of the same nature that
[18:23] by going through death he might bring to
[18:28] know and they of no effect him who had
[18:34] the power of death that is the devil
[18:37] [Music]
[18:38] yeah I'm from the country so a part of
[18:46] speech that we heard but all were
[18:48] correct or incorrect was no it means
[18:54] zero so if you want to replace the word
[18:59] not a word zero and see how that sounds
[19:03] by going through death he pipe dream to
[19:07] zero and make up make them nor that him
[19:12] who had the power of death that is now
[19:18] this is God's attitude toward your mind
[19:22] it's his attitude toward his enemy this
[19:27] attitude is based upon what he
[19:30] accomplished
[19:31] fully thoroughly he doesn't have to go
[19:34] back
[19:35] there's no need no requirement I feel
[19:37] going back who called him down
[19:40] who will summons him up according to
[19:43] Romans chapter 10 they there is
[19:46] absolutely no mean event the work has
[19:50] been done so absolutely thoroughly be
[19:57] brought to zero and you may say he's
[20:00] he's still around and served without
[20:04] mister and disagree but in the heart the
[20:07] mind of God which we can develop into
[20:11] this understanding that this culprit has
[20:16] been brought reduced to zero first John
[20:25] chapter 3 verse number eight
[20:38] and if you're very worried together but
[20:42] he convinced and and this can be a
[20:45] really where people kind of trip up
[20:48] stuff it is it is safe you practice
[20:54] whatever that sin would be it's your
[20:57] practicing that if it's like a baby or
[21:01] something that is eventual so that is
[21:05] what the word probably say he who
[21:08] commits in our practices is about the
[21:11] devil takes his character from the evil
[21:13] one for the devil send violated divine
[21:16] law from the beginning the reason the
[21:19] Son of God was they benefits our visible
[21:23] was in human flesh was to hunted and
[21:27] this is the nebula do one to the King
[21:31] James use of the word is growing that
[21:34] were destroying and great things done to
[21:36] do destroying loosen this hop the works
[21:41] of the monkey is about amen
[21:50] there's a story that I read I'll share
[21:53] with you
[21:53] it's told of a prince it was born to a
[21:55] great royal family when the prince is
[21:59] five years old his father the King took
[22:01] the boy with him on a journey into a far
[22:03] country during the journey their shield
[22:06] struggle brief and the entire crew and
[22:08] passengers were thrown into that angry
[22:11] waves near the terminal and rescue
[22:13] effort
[22:14] threats will save by Nady from the
[22:16] nearby hydrants the team was unaware the
[22:19] rescue and the little prince was now
[22:21] separated from his royal family he
[22:24] became a member of the village grew up
[22:26] unaware of his royal heritage
[22:28] now as I read this surely we can use
[22:31] each other to us he learned the think
[22:35] and way of what the natives and and
[22:38] accepted and accepted this last
[22:46] lifestyle as his own in his poverty and
[22:49] simple life he was not made aware that
[22:51] he was from a wealthy family of us past
[22:54] and was heir to the royal kingdom of his
[22:57] father in fact he became a slave to the
[23:00] culture customs stead and standards of
[23:04] the community in which he found himself
[23:05] evils of royal prince living Thunder
[23:09] impoverished conditions
[23:10] I wonder if we the whole Christian
[23:16] community are someone that they are that
[23:25] they know very happy he did not know
[23:31] where he came from where he was why he
[23:34] was born what he was capable of are his
[23:38] rightful claim to be king he lived his
[23:42] life vastly along his inherent
[23:44] privileges not knowing the answers to
[23:47] the critical questions of his life his
[23:49] identity his heritage his purpose
[23:54] potential and destiny now someone many
[24:00] years ago said what you do is self
[24:11] I don't think what they said as as being
[24:14] critical they're just nothing used to be
[24:18] this is what for the brand said oh we
[24:22] forget what we are we forget many times
[24:25] what made us and what we are after we
[24:30] become what we are then we forget how we
[24:33] got here the messenger goes on to say of
[24:39] another this is a he said now if we are
[24:44] born of our Heavenly Father God the
[24:47] Paul's the things which be not which are
[24:51] not as though they work there is going
[24:54] to be something in us like that would
[25:00] you love our reread that because the
[25:07] things which are not as though they work
[25:11] there is going to be something in us can
[25:23] we look in the Bible at James chapter
[25:27] number two three minutes
[25:49] in first one that brother chapter longer
[25:52] in verse 26 it says they've had among
[25:56] you seem to be religious and Brotherhood
[25:57] not his tongue looking to seize his all
[26:01] heart in other words he believes
[26:03] something down here
[26:05] but his mouth is saying something that
[26:07] is contrary to what is the nature of God
[26:11] any of bullies so therefore there is a
[26:14] deception process that has taken place
[26:17] in chapter 3 once again I was gripped
[26:23] with these metaphors that have been
[26:25] provided in this chapter I trust that it
[26:27] will be a blessing to you brethren be
[26:31] not many masters knowing that we shall
[26:33] receive the greater condemnation for it
[26:35] many things we have it all but if any
[26:37] man offend nothing murder the same is a
[26:40] perfect man complete and they will also
[26:42] deprive the whole body and there is a
[26:45] connection of the hole we put pins and
[26:53] here's the metaphors before we put bits
[26:57] and the horse's mouth
[26:59] I'm assuming that you and a lot of
[27:03] videos it's something about this long
[27:06] and it goes it's part of the heart and
[27:09] it goes in their mouth now we put this
[27:13] in the horse's mouth that they may go
[27:15] play us and we turn about their whole
[27:19] body once again the map has an absolute
[27:23] or a direct connection to the body it
[27:27] provides a direction for ever that
[27:30] individual that is behind wherever
[27:33] they're building
[27:35] all the shifts which though they be so
[27:38] preeminent driven by fierce winds yet
[27:41] they are turned about with a very small
[27:44] L whithersoever the governor the captain
[27:48] listen so once again here is the
[27:53] metaphor here is yes and what it does
[27:57] and has the ability to do to the horse
[27:59] and a horse when I think of a horse
[28:03] thinking of a pony I'm thinking of a
[28:07] convert the Kentucky Derby pack horse
[28:10] I'm thinking of a workhorse that is
[28:13] strong muscular and you're able to
[28:19] direct that animal father if it's in its
[28:23] mouth and you're thinking when up is it
[28:28] provides the shoe I'm uh thinking of a
[28:30] fishing problem I'm thinking of
[28:33] something that would be blocking a
[28:39] cruise ship where there's 1,500 2,000
[28:44] people you see and here's a small
[28:47] instrument that is steering that huge
[28:51] ocean-going like you know the metaphor
[28:55] is concerning our our our words do do
[29:03] our words have any meaning whatsoever to
[29:06] do they do they have any significance
[29:11] about them because a lot of times we're
[29:15] just loose with our words well let's
[29:19] look at that one
[29:20] statement as Jesus was speaking in mark
[29:23] chapter of the program we're twenty
[29:26] reference this he said you're getting
[29:28] into private material of verse
[29:31] twenty-three in mark chapter 11
[29:44] first twenty two above it says have
[29:47] faith in God Jesus Antron says that does
[29:49] they only have faith in God they have
[29:51] actual written very Greek the Greek is
[29:53] have the faith of God or have the
[29:56] god-kind of faith and he was on top of
[29:59] truth our early I said to you that
[30:01] whosoever shall say over this mountain
[30:03] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[30:07] the sea and come up down in his heart
[30:09] but shall believe that those things
[30:11] which he said shall come the pastiche of
[30:13] that bolts whoever he says and we'll
[30:16] just pop us up there for the moment here
[30:19] this kind of mirrors of what James is
[30:24] saying it's something small but it
[30:27] produces some the results are
[30:29] magnanimous now the the mountain that
[30:34] was possibly perhaps in the Mount of the
[30:37] Lord when he was speaking this it may be
[30:41] he that the mountain has been created
[30:46] because of words the Institute works can
[30:50] remove mountains and create
[30:55] very calm to create balance and Regan
[31:01] optimizing all we're doing in this great
[31:11] ability and gift that God has placed
[31:13] within his children that we have the
[31:16] ability that Jesus awesome whosoever
[31:21] shall say now pray and be passed out to
[31:29] sea and down now technologies are but
[31:33] shall believe if this varies a ratio of
[31:38] three to one saying to believing so what
[31:45] perhaps a point in brother sister what I
[31:50] believe what you believe not only comes
[31:53] by hearing but it also comes pasta say
[31:58] [Music]
[32:00] say for instance now if if you were
[32:05] really than the environment say your
[32:08] early years years of childhood working
[32:11] where there was the environment that
[32:12] also really help that great maybe use
[32:16] your father
[32:16] I can relate that my father just never
[32:20] he just did not know how to show in any
[32:24] kind of affection whatsoever maybe he
[32:29] never encouraged never remember giving
[32:32] an encouraging word
[32:40] justify myself but usin as an
[32:43] illustration so I grew up with a sense
[32:48] of insecurity I grew up with the sense
[32:51] of inferiority it was very easy for me
[32:57] to just freak they did not like to like
[33:08] to be called upon and so I grew up with
[33:12] that kind of mentality about myself and
[33:18] only maybe not still deal with that
[33:20] today maybe you're an adult and you
[33:22] still deal with that
[33:24] if you've definitely at all so but the
[33:29] Word of God has been extremely
[33:32] instrumental in delivery of be from
[33:41] you know everybody else is better than
[33:44] you are
[33:45] and if you see one sailor and everyone
[33:48] else is better than I this would be my
[33:52] courage brother Simon you can do it but
[33:54] Bob can't you see that would be not not
[33:58] approach from from the angle that I've
[34:00] just described to you
[34:02] so the Bible says that what I believe
[34:07] and the more that I say I would say
[34:11] really the voice of the Father said
[34:25] about me and you thought to yourself you
[34:29] have your lips your points due to sound
[34:33] out reset them of what God said about
[34:41] [Music]
[34:47] you see brother sister it's going to
[34:51] develop real thing and you up over and
[34:54] over again as you declare it verbally
[34:58] your mental attitude toward the promises
[35:02] of God that brother Brown was the first
[35:10] one that said that I think from the head
[35:13] that posture was the first one that set
[35:16] high spec but they will put some threads
[35:18] and from branham was given by the master
[35:21] of the stage as it were of where that
[35:24] could be
[35:25] they embrace perhaps more so than from
[35:28] brother Bosworth now it going back to
[35:32] first Peter if you love life and you
[35:36] want to see good days this is what you
[35:39] do refrain your top story that up better
[35:46] earth this well no minister in America
[35:50] he's had a city that hold the meeting
[35:53] and I'm assumed by how the story and the
[35:56] content noticed that this this
[35:59] individual just probably off the street
[36:01] a local set up set up equipment of the
[36:04] stage and what happened so he that he
[36:08] stayed for the meeting and of course he
[36:10] was sitting in the river in most of the
[36:12] platforming the minister was telling him
[36:14] of the congregation the Word of God God
[36:20] is a good God he doesn't do the things
[36:23] that is blame noting and
[36:25] and they got interrupted to minister
[36:28] cities
[36:30] you need to tell me
[36:33] [Music]
[36:46] [Music]
[36:55] [Music]
[37:08] [Music]
[37:32] the sword and spear has two inches
[37:35] that's going and it
[37:38] [Music]
[37:52] [Applause]
[37:54] folks you just heard that from
[38:05] [Music]
[38:08] that is precious I know I don't want to
[38:13] seem overbearing with that particular
[38:17] statement of the word of God but our
[38:19] performing a probe is exactly precisely
[38:21] correct they meant it to that now let's
[38:28] look at second Corinthians chapter 10
[38:31] verse 3 through 5 this is okay
[38:50] chapter 10 verse 8 o critics verse
[38:53] number 3 for though we walk in the flesh
[38:56] we do not war after the flesh for the
[39:00] weapons plural of our warfare are not
[39:03] carnal but mighty through God to the
[39:06] pulling down of strongholds casting down
[39:11] imaginations image I come from a family
[39:20] of failures image I'll never succeed
[39:27] I'll never try I'll never help joy
[39:31] testing down imaginations and every high
[39:34] thing that exalteth itself against the
[39:38] knowledge of God perhaps there was
[39:41] someone in your family tree they not
[39:44] very earthly of a devastating condition
[39:48] cancer or Alzheimer's or something like
[39:51] all that nature and here we're saying
[39:54] that's in the genes of my earthly family
[39:59] and we begin to image that out that I'm
[40:06] gonna fall driving like this tragedy is
[40:10] don't do those kind of images our
[40:13] embankment or the powers of destruction
[40:19] they are
[40:22] for a it draws that those demonic forces
[40:28] casting down the casting down
[40:32] imaginations and every high thing that
[40:38] exalts itself against the knowledge of
[40:41] God and God is the work against the
[40:44] knowledge of the work that Hosea 4:6
[40:48] people are destroyed or they are cut off
[40:52] is the group meaning of that work they
[40:54] are cut off because of lack of knowledge
[40:57] you see knowledge is pre-eminently
[41:01] importantly testing down imaging or
[41:07] imaginations and every high thing that
[41:10] exalteth itself against the knowledge of
[41:13] the world against the work of God and
[41:16] bringing into captivity every thought
[41:19] now this is possible it is possible you
[41:26] think well it's it's possible but not
[41:30] probable to me it is possible in a
[41:35] process of development in our growth
[41:38] this is absolutely possible
[41:43] [Music]
[41:53] and with you absorb more of this one is
[42:38] the creator in that in that statement I
[42:48] don't think if you find weakness in that
[42:51] state you did not follow your investing
[42:54] BG's the progenitor in the process I'll
[43:01] be change
[43:15] and actually in the grief this is what
[43:19] of that that means guests in them every
[43:21] high thing that exalts itself against
[43:24] the knowledge of the world if its
[43:26] meaning to lift up your eyes to look up
[43:32] to lift up your voice and what that is
[43:36] to say is that these imaginations they
[43:40] may be blue so large then they become
[43:44] cemented in our minds and in our
[43:47] thoughts and that week we are they tower
[43:53] above us and then we're parsing what
[43:58] we're seeing and so therefore these
[44:01] things become strong holes and the Word
[44:16] of God will help us in mark chapter 5
[44:22] you don't have to turn that you can put
[44:24] it down for later reference
[44:26] if you would like and here is a district
[44:29] 9 lady called the one with issue of
[44:33] blood she's been she's died in curve
[44:38] amen yeah and she'd spent all that she
[44:43] had and she was growing worse and that
[44:46] was her attitude early worse I'm growing
[44:50] worse many minutes godly people have
[44:55] that attitude today things are worse
[44:58] her works things are no matter it works
[45:02] but when she heard the word great of a
[45:07] transformation that took place in their
[45:10] activity there was a marvelous
[45:15] transformation she began to say instead
[45:19] I'm growing worse or it's worth to begin
[45:22] to say I'm going to this fellow that
[45:26] I've heard about and if I can touch his
[45:28] clothes
[45:29] I'll be faithful and the amplifi said
[45:33] she kept saying it
[45:35] she said she kept saying that her faith
[45:39] prepared her and the nothing is saved
[45:43] what she believed they propelled her to
[45:46] go through the crap press you know it
[45:49] was not easy until she and we don't
[46:02] think Sun comfortable but her attitude
[46:06] changed from one of her own works to one
[46:12] I can touch in mark chapter 4 there was
[46:16] a statement released from the mouth of
[46:18] the master said let's go over to the
[46:20] other side in the boats and they were
[46:22] boat and they were on their way to the
[46:25] other side now to me it would be simple
[46:28] will never occur whatever come up
[46:31] between a big loss there would behave a
[46:35] word that would have anchored in our
[46:38] soul and that is
[46:42] but obviously there was not a taker and
[46:46] their attitude was one of perish and
[46:50] they have looked the Word of God on the
[46:54] ship and he said oh you of little faith
[46:59] where is your faith another writer
[47:03] explicitly their attitude toward the
[47:07] worker God was a very very poor when
[47:12] it's considered of what they were
[47:14] experiencing numbers chapter 13 younger
[47:19] very familiar of the stories the story
[47:22] of the reconnaissance that had gone into
[47:25] spy of the land and that the reported in
[47:27] brought back to the people
