[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] here we are today
[0:16] again in the presence of the lord
[0:19] may the great holy spirit of god bless
[0:23] us
[0:23] as we come together in his name
[0:28] as we study
[0:31] within the seven
[0:34] church ages we continue
[0:38] in these bible studies of the seven
[0:41] church ages
[0:43] and particularly we
[0:47] are speaking about warning
[0:51] promise and reward
[0:54] may god help us as we
[0:58] read his beloved word
[1:01] and pray together for the
[1:04] fire of god to fall upon our hearts
[1:09] let us pray gracious heavenly father
[1:14] we thank you for this privilege
[1:17] once again on another
[1:21] wednesday night to lift up holy hands
[1:27] and hearts before thee thanking you for
[1:31] the word
[1:31] thanking you for this blessed
[1:34] opportunity
[1:35] and this awesome invitation
[1:39] into your divine presence and to a
[1:43] feast at the king's table take all
[1:46] glory honor and praise due to your name
[1:51] thank you for the word which we are
[1:53] about to read
[1:55] in jesus name amen
[1:58] and amen and now friends
[2:02] let us turn in our bibles
[2:05] to revelation chapter 2
[2:09] reading from verse 20
[2:14] to be speaking about
[2:18] jezebel
[2:21] behold i
[2:25] will cast her into a bed
[2:30] and them that commit adultery
[2:33] with her into great tribulation
[2:37] except they repent of their deeds
[2:41] and i will kill her children with
[2:44] death and all the churches shall know
[2:48] that i am he that searcheth the reins
[2:53] and hearts and i
[2:57] will give unto every one of you
[3:01] according to your works
[3:04] but unto you i say and unto the rest
[3:08] inside cyra
[3:10] as many as have not this doctrine
[3:15] and which have not known the depths of
[3:19] satan
[3:20] as they speak i will put
[3:23] upon you none other burden
[3:27] but that which ye have already
[3:31] hold fast till i come
[3:36] and he that overcome it and
[3:39] keep it my works unto the end
[3:42] to him will i give power over the
[3:46] nations
[3:47] and he shall rule them with a rod
[3:51] of iron as the vessels of a potter
[3:55] shall they be broken to shivers
[3:58] even as i received of my father
[4:02] and i will give him the morning star
[4:07] he that had an ear to hear
[4:10] let him hear what the spirit
[4:14] saith on to the churches
[4:18] amen praise god hallelujah
[4:22] now we know of course uh speaking
[4:26] about this great warning about
[4:30] killing her children with death god
[4:33] is saying you're not going to be
[4:36] sentenced put to death
[4:40] without any uh
[4:44] proof it will be solid
[4:47] rock proof because i
[4:51] the lord search at the hearts
[4:54] and i know the rains or in other words i
[4:58] know
[4:58] your thoughts and that has
[5:02] never changed throughout the very ages
[5:06] no sir there were always two groups
[5:11] within the body of what
[5:14] we call the church god has
[5:18] always looked at this body
[5:21] as having two groups within it
[5:25] the true and the false and of course
[5:28] those who proclaim their revelation
[5:32] is from god and that their
[5:36] relationship is with god
[5:40] however we find both groups
[5:44] but true and false would make that same
[5:48] claim
[5:49] but at the bottom of
[5:52] all of this regardless of man
[5:56] and the proclamations and claims of man
[6:00] god says beyond all of this
[6:04] i know your thoughts i
[6:08] know your reigns i know all your motives
[6:11] and your
[6:11] intentions of course he will know them
[6:15] for he is hebrews 14
[6:18] 12. amen 4 12
[6:21] and here we find again the bible says
[6:27] nevertheless the foundation of god
[6:32] standeth shore having
[6:35] this seal what seal the seal
[6:39] the lord knoweth them
[6:42] which are his god alone knows
[6:47] his own the eternal
[6:51] knows his eternal ones
[6:54] they have a connection and the great
[6:58] shepherd knows his sheep that means
[7:02] even if the sheep doesn't know
[7:04] themselves
[7:05] or know who they are the great shepherd
[7:08] still knows his sheep
[7:11] he knows his own and will bring them to
[7:14] awareness
[7:16] of who they really are
[7:19] the lord search at the reins of course
[7:22] the word
[7:23] search means to track
[7:26] or to follow up god
[7:30] will track down your thoughts many of
[7:33] you have seen
[7:35] the marvelous and i would say
[7:38] amazing uh videos
[7:42] of god using
[7:46] the seventh church age messenger
[7:50] brother william marion branham
[7:54] standing there upon the platform
[7:57] thousands before him and when he is
[8:00] standing there
[8:02] and the spirit of god begins to reflect
[8:05] through that star
[8:07] messenger then the voice of god will
[8:10] speak
[8:11] out and say oh there
[8:14] in this in the massive crowd there
[8:18] is a man or a woman over there
[8:22] and uh you're thinking so and so
[8:25] this is in your thoughts right now
[8:28] he says and you can't even hide your
[8:32] thoughts from me
[8:33] at this point amen the spirit of the
[8:36] lord was upon him
[8:38] and so the lord as he used that
[8:42] prophet and no thought
[8:45] could be hid from him just think of the
[8:48] lord himself
[8:50] saying i know your thoughts
[8:54] i know you're saying
[8:57] i know your reigns and
[9:01] i can track down or
[9:05] follow your thoughts to the very
[9:08] end point of whatever you were thinking
[9:12] about
[9:14] god knows what's in your heart
[9:17] we can't hide what is in our hearts we
[9:19] may hide it from
[9:21] men we may uh uh some gamblers and
[9:26] people of that nature do train
[9:28] themselves to have a
[9:29] poker face expression yeah
[9:33] you may hide your facial features
[9:36] and your feelings and emotions but god
[9:39] knows the heart god can
[9:42] read whatever is within your souls
[9:47] and he'll know your heart and we humans
[9:50] will know your heart
[9:51] also by your works
[9:55] for your works are the mirror
[9:58] are like a mirror of your thoughts
[10:01] oh you will carry out what you're
[10:04] thinking
[10:05] by the works so your
[10:09] my friends you see you can say one thing
[10:12] but your
[10:12] actions will be speaking something else
[10:16] and will know you from what you are
[10:20] manifesting through your
[10:23] life at that particular time for
[10:26] out of the heart proceeded
[10:29] righteousness or wickedness
[10:32] and deceit see all of our motives
[10:38] all of our purposes are
[10:41] all known to him
[10:44] and as one song says
[10:48] known only to him are the
[10:52] great hidden secrets doesn't matter
[10:55] what and where we try to hide it
[10:58] the all-seeing eye of god knows the
[11:02] heart
[11:02] and knows what is within your
[11:06] thoughts even now while i'm in
[11:09] the midst of the secret of speaking
[11:12] and every deed every act every
[11:16] word spoken or acted or done
[11:19] in darkness jesus said it
[11:22] shall be brought to light that which is
[11:26] done hidden will be shouted out
[11:30] upon the house stops as such amen
[11:33] oh praise god think of what we i just
[11:37] said
[11:37] jesus said and then here comes the
[11:40] prophet of god who
[11:42] says the angel of god spoke to him
[11:46] and said to him your thoughts
[11:49] are heard louder in heaven
[11:53] than your spoken words here upon the
[11:56] earth
[11:57] think on it your thoughts
[12:00] are heard louder in the heavens
[12:05] amen then your spoken words
[12:08] are heard upon the earth you'll find
[12:12] that in the queen of sheba
[12:13] message paragraph 21 and in the patmos
[12:17] vision
[12:18] paragraph 193
[12:21] yes my friends there's going to be an
[12:24] accounting day
[12:27] paid day is coming someday
[12:30] and there's going to be a day
[12:33] when the books are open and when we have
[12:37] to make an account
[12:39] of the deeds that we have done
[12:42] while our soul was in this body
[12:47] amen and we'll have to answer
[12:50] for those deeds done in the flesh
[12:54] my friends think of it and repent
[12:57] while there is time to repent turn your
[13:00] heart to
[13:01] god while there is yet time to turn your
[13:04] heart to god
[13:05] may the reality of this word strike your
[13:08] soul and bring you to a recognition
[13:12] of what god is doing and has
[13:15] done within your heart and life
[13:18] amen there is no fear of god
[13:22] in the false vine they'll mock they'll
[13:25] scoff
[13:26] even while i'm speaking it may be
[13:30] a matter of of jokes
[13:33] and entertainment in the minds
[13:36] of some amen but one day
[13:40] they shall pay dearly for their thoughts
[13:45] and their acts that they have done
[13:48] and so let all who name the name of
[13:51] christ
[13:53] depart from iniquity and live
[13:56] lives as are becoming
[14:01] true servants children of god
[14:05] to walk in the light of the world amen
[14:09] you see friends we may put on religious
[14:13] trappings
[14:14] religious clothing religious actions
[14:17] religious words
[14:18] and we may deceive millions
[14:22] we may fool millions of people
[14:25] thousands or those around you but we
[14:28] will
[14:29] never be able to fool the eyes in the
[14:32] heart
[14:33] thoughts of god for the lord know it
[14:37] our reigns he knew it our thoughts
[14:40] amen in the midst of his knowing
[14:45] he knows also that there are
[14:48] some that will not
[14:52] let go of his hand but will haul
[14:56] fast to his word and to trust him
[15:00] in the midst of trial revelation 24
[15:04] 25 but unto you
[15:07] i see and unto the rest in
[15:10] thyatira as many as
[15:14] have not this doctrine and which have
[15:17] not known the depth of satan
[15:21] as they speak i will put upon you
[15:25] no other burden but
[15:28] that which you already have hold
[15:32] fast till i come amen
[15:36] praise god amen or take god
[15:40] we have peril but we have a promise
[15:45] we have a god that gives us
[15:48] his promise like the mother eagle
[15:52] will tell the young ones to hold on to
[15:55] one quill
[15:56] out of her feathers so that she might
[15:59] take flight with them into the heavenly
[16:01] places
[16:02] and so god grants to us hold to this
[16:06] promise hold to this promise
[16:08] hold to my word hold on
[16:11] hold on how long to hold on hold on
[16:15] not till the end of next trial next
[16:18] tribulation next
[16:19] problem but hold fast till i
[16:23] come amen thank god he's coming again
[16:27] and he is encouraging us to hold
[16:30] fast until he comes again
[16:33] praise god so in this book
[16:37] he is speaking and telling us
[16:40] in that age of scientist that there
[16:44] are two vines two vines
[16:48] twins within the
[16:51] confines of christianity twins
[16:55] within the confines of what we call
[16:58] the message here also
[17:02] amen yes sir two groups
[17:05] one has the doctrine by revelation
[17:10] and the other one does not have it
[17:15] and they're scattered everywhere they're
[17:18] all over the world
[17:19] scattered abroad across the nations
[17:23] and there you'll find each one's
[17:25] doctrine
[17:26] opposing the doctrine of the other one
[17:30] it has been so from canaan abell
[17:34] it has been so right through jacob and
[17:37] esau
[17:38] it has been so through isaac and ishmael
[17:42] it has been so true jesus and
[17:45] judas it has been so right through the
[17:49] apostolic times
[17:51] write down to our day our time
[17:54] that we are seeing this with the same
[17:57] two vines god versus satan
[18:01] god in his children versus satan
[18:05] operating through his own and so
[18:08] the contest is on and the greatest
[18:11] longest battle ever thought
[18:15] is in progress even right now
[18:18] and we are we are in we are engaged in
[18:22] it
[18:22] for we fight not against flesh and blood
[18:25] but we
[18:26] fight against principalities and
[18:29] powers and spiritual wickednesses
[18:32] that are in high places and thank god
[18:36] we are conscious of it we are not just
[18:38] reading it in the bible
[18:40] but we know from experience we know
[18:44] from revelation that we are in actual
[18:47] combat against the devil and his works
[18:51] the warfare continues and the
[18:54] battle is here oh praise his
[18:57] marvelous name certainly my friends
[19:01] we see that these branches
[19:05] have intertwined the branches of this
[19:08] great tree have become intertwined
[19:13] and it's hard to separate them one from
[19:16] the other
[19:17] but yet we know they're everywhere
[19:21] one knowing the depths of god
[19:24] and the other one is filled with the
[19:28] knowledge of the depths of satan
[19:31] amen god said i will put
[19:35] upon you none other burden
[19:38] the word for burden here means weight
[19:42] i will put no other weight upon you
[19:45] and here's another word pressure
[19:48] i will put no more pressure upon you
[19:52] you remember the bible tells us
[19:55] god will not give us any temptation
[19:58] more than we are able to bear oh
[20:02] there god will not give us
[20:06] a a test that he knows we cannot bear
[20:10] and he knows your capability more than
[20:13] yourself
[20:14] he knows your potentials more than you
[20:17] do
[20:18] and he is saying i will not put upon you
[20:22] none other burden see pressure
[20:26] i will not put more pressure on you you
[20:29] see
[20:30] the pressure of the dark ages
[20:33] was already upon them
[20:36] and god is responding to that
[20:39] and he is saying i will
[20:43] not put more pressure upon you
[20:46] except that which you already have
[20:51] this pressure of the dark ages upon you
[20:55] now the the pressure that the
[20:59] dark ages was bringing upon the saints
[21:03] was either to bend them or to
[21:06] cause them to break an actual fact when
[21:10] trials
[21:10] test comes your way in temptations
[21:13] it's either to to make you bow
[21:17] bend or break or buff that's the way
[21:21] that the devil works they
[21:24] come with their action and arrogance
[21:27] and attitude you bow down to our
[21:31] doctrine and our teaching or die this
[21:34] is their proclamation and that was what
[21:38] the inquisition's power play
[21:41] was in that day and in that time
[21:45] of trying to empire build
[21:48] uh build an empire based on
[21:51] satanic worship amen
[21:54] how are you going to do that be
[21:57] organized
[21:58] don't be you just got to be organized
[22:02] and uh are you gonna pay with your life
[22:06] if you are not organized and you don't
[22:09] allow yourself
[22:10] to be a part of some recognized
[22:14] great organization we are going to push
[22:17] you to the side
[22:18] we are going to push you into the the
[22:21] flames of fire
[22:22] we're going to push you into a modern
[22:25] day
[22:26] form of inquisition you will not be
[22:29] able to go certain places you will not
[22:32] be able to do certain things
[22:34] because you need to have their
[22:37] organization
[22:39] their organizational registrations
[22:42] and acceptance before
[22:45] you will be received
[22:48] and so my friends the
[22:51] nudges the hunches the the encouragement
[22:55] to to get yourself organized
[22:59] is all around us it may not be outwardly
[23:02] spoken
[23:03] but it is right there before us
[23:06] or you'll pay the price
[23:09] now we know every age has its own
[23:14] particular pressures
[23:17] and for example the last age that we
[23:21] spoke on
[23:23] they had the pressure of riches
[23:27] riches was upon them
[23:30] the devil was trying to carry them away
[23:33] as he may be trying to carry away some
[23:36] people even in our day
[23:37] with with soft living right
[23:41] soft living but with the soft living
[23:45] comes nervous tension yes sir
[23:49] and we know even in our day we live in a
[23:52] complex
[23:53] age an age that uh
[23:57] it seems like uh people are seem
[24:00] unfitted
[24:01] they're not able to live in this age
[24:04] and to meet the challenges of the age
[24:09] now we know in this fourth church age
[24:13] seemed to have a clear-cut burden
[24:17] and it was that there were to defy
[24:20] rome and to stand up for the word of god
[24:25] even unto death so the commission
[24:30] of this fourth church age was to stand
[24:33] against
[24:34] mr babylon romish a religion
[24:38] and to stand for the word of god
[24:41] for their day and for their age
[24:45] listen to the scriptures they have
[24:48] not known the depths
[24:51] of satan certainly because
[24:55] they have consumed themselves
[24:59] with knowing the depths of god and so
[25:02] they were not going to try to search
[25:05] out the depths of satan
[25:09] whatsoever whosoever he is
[25:13] amen oh praise god if we know
[25:17] what the depths of god are we'll
[25:20] certainly
[25:21] be able to figure out the depths
[25:24] of satan now in ephesians
[25:28] if you have your bible i would like to
[25:31] take up a note ephesians chapter 3
[25:36] verse 16 that he would grant you
[25:42] according to the riches of his glory
[25:46] to be straightened with might
[25:49] by his spirit in the inner man
[25:54] that christ may dwell in your hearts
[25:58] by faith that ye
[26:02] being rooted and
[26:05] grounded in love
[26:09] may be able to comprehend
[26:12] with all the saints what is the breath
[26:17] and the length and the
[26:20] depth and the height
[26:24] and to know the love of christ
[26:28] which passeth understanding
[26:31] and passeth knowledge that you may be
[26:35] filled with the fullness of god
[26:38] amen well according to these verses
[26:42] when a man experiences the depths of god
[26:46] within his life it is an actual
[26:49] experience
[26:51] of the spirit of god indwelling
[26:54] the individual and their mind
[26:58] becomes illuminated lit up
[27:01] their minds become illuminated
[27:04] hallelujah by the wisdom
[27:07] and knowledge of god
[27:10] through the re re revelation
[27:13] of the word of god oh my forgive me if i
[27:17] stutter like that a little bit
[27:19] that's just the holy spirit upon my
[27:22] heart glory to god
[27:24] when the spirit of god speaks and takes
[27:27] the word of god
[27:28] and grabs ahold of you and you see these
[27:31] things
[27:32] so clearly my friends it strikes your
[27:35] soul like no man can amen
[27:39] yes sir so the depths of satan
[27:43] is that satan will seek to destroy
[27:47] that kind of ingredient
[27:50] an element of wisdom and knowledge
[27:55] that resides within the heart
[27:58] of the true believer that truly
[28:01] believe and sees what god has for them
[28:06] and to destroy them
[28:09] he will try to substitute his own words
[28:14] for god's word remember he did that in
[28:17] the garden
[28:19] when he substituted his
[28:22] words for god's word to eve
[28:26] when he said had god said
[28:29] amen and he quoted god's word
[28:34] back to her with just one
[28:38] word of his own and twisted the entire
[28:41] thing
[28:42] he twisted the entire thing away
[28:45] from her so what is he trying to do
[28:49] destroy the revelation
[28:52] by substituting giving believers
[28:56] a substitute reality to the word
[29:00] instead of the unfailing reality
[29:04] of the revelation of god's word which
[29:07] never changes
[29:08] never lies but remains the truth forever
[29:12] and forever amen amen yes sir
[29:17] oh you tried to take away that knowledge
[29:20] of the truth from you
[29:22] make you be uncertain of it shaky on
[29:25] your
[29:26] faith concerning the word of god
[29:29] but don't stagger don't shake abraham
[29:33] staggered
[29:34] not but hold to the word of god
[29:37] let god sustain you and strengthen you
[29:41] in your inner man that you might
[29:44] walk up rightly in his marvelous

[30:37] that the christian life is not me trying
