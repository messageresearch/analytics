just automatically turn their attention to the Lord and to the Savior and they you know they by tradition they you know which is fine which is good I mean something is better than nothing amen amen and um you know uh it's it's it's something that that we see the whole world light up we see all the Angels you know getting blown up and put into the People's Front Lawns and we see all the light and the glitter and everything else and the gifts and we see the malls getting so busy people getting busy and spending thousands and thousands of dollars and then going into depression in January when they received their Visa statement y amen but you know um it's really the time that we should be worshiping the Lord Jesus in spirit and in truth it's a time where where we should recognize the importance of the Lord Jesus and not worshiping a baby that came 2,000 years ago but worshiping him that is resurrected and living in our midst this morning amen he's with us this morning I believe that we're going to receive a blessing from his presence this morning amen so I trust that you will um and you have come this morning with great expectation in your hearts amen praise God I want to welcome everybody I want to welcome our guest I know today we have our annual Christmas dinner and we certainly appreciate and welcome all of you all of our guests uh family members and friends we appreciate you being with us we trust that you will leave different than the way you came that you will be blessed not only by the meal this evening but by the one that the Lord has prepared for us today Amen in the word of God Amen praise God and so um we certainly appreciate Frank my partner brother Frank belissimo is here with us today um God bless you brother and thank you for taking the time he's going to uh he's going to break bread with us this evening he's been um he's been there next to me he's been my business partner for over 30 years 35 years now and um you know he's he's been a blessing uh he's been a brother he's a Believer he trusts in the Lord he believes that God is able to do great things and so I pr appreciate him being here today and I trust that he will receive his Blessing amen praise God um just want to let you know that uh missions work continues to move forward uh we've been doing work with our uh Brethren down in uh Ghana through our precious brother Desmond who's been um uh staying closely connected with the work that's happening there the walls are all up now the the the they've put lentils in the roof is the next stage we'll be sending some funds down this week for them to continue that work we've also connected with Brethren from from the West Coast brother um DOD the two brothers uh brother Steve um brother Darren uh there's there's there's some brothers down there that have a work that they've been doing in Uganda and other parts of the world and so we've we've we've worked and assembled with them um we've worked with them in the past and we're going to continue the work and I want you to know that our ministry just recently send enough funds to build um you know probably half to three qus of a church in Uganda amen that's that's you know we want to be a life changing Ministry and if we can't go then we're going to send amen and we're going to do whatever we can to help because they've been building churches they built over 18 churches in 2024 yes in Uganda and and these churches are temporary buildings but yet they're structural you'll be able to see pictures of them on our website we will be presenting it there and you'll be able to see what you're participating in what you're a part of Amen but it's for people that are that are receiving this word for the for this day and there's groups of them breaking away from church and they got nowhere to to work to go and worship so these brothers have found a way to build these temporary churches for these individuals to come together so they can hear and receive the word for their day amen amen we want to be a part of that amen glory to God Amen I I can say that that we can be proud to be a part of something like that because when that last one receives that final Revelation it'll all be finished and this church will be gone in a moment and in the twinkling of an eye God bless you let's go to the word of God how many has a need this morning before the Lord show your hands unto the Lord and I know that there's many needs father we're so grateful this morning to to be able to receive your word and now to deliver it father but it takes your spirit Lord to make it real in the hearts of every individual life and father Lord you see the uplifted hands you know the needs that are in the midst of your people and we ask that you would come this morning Lord and and open the word of God lord we we we've been given the book the book is open we're feasting from the open book lord we Rejoice because you are the life you are the the spirit that gives life and and faith and Revelation to the word of God that makes it real individually personal to our hearts in our lives won't you grant it this morning Lord again and take control of speaker take control of the hearers Lord let your your your Supernatural presence move through the pews this morning and speak to the hearts of even the youngest the child Lord May the word transform and change lives this morning those that are out on the on the on the internet that are listening in Lord may your spirit move and and speak and open the understanding Lord you're the only one that opens and you're the one that shuts blessed be your wonderful name we give you you all the praise the glory and the honor in Jesus name amen praise God God bless you Saints let's read the word of God we'll go to the first slide this morning we're going to end uh this series today I'm trusting by the grace of God I need you to be patient I need you to uh to to just pay close attention there's something in the word of God for you here this morning we may not get finished at one o' but what's the rush is anybody in a rush here today if you have to leave at 1:00 maybe we get done by 1:00 but we we can't go to the hall until about 3: or just after 3 so um you know uh there's no rush let's let the Holy Spirit speak to our hearts so settle in relax and just let the spirit of God speak to you and I believe if you just get sincere God will give you something that you'll that you'll be able to say like those that walked on the road to AAS did not our hearts burn amen burned within us as he spoke to us along the way amen praise God let's read our first scripture first Peter um we open the series with this scripture I want to finish it with this scripture blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy hath begotten us again unto Lively hope unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead this is what Christmas is all about this is a Christmas message may not be a traditional Christmas message but it's the it's the essence of what Christmas is all about and to an inheritance Incorruptible this is what we've been given an inheritance Incorruptible undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for who me exactly for you and for me amen praise God who are kept by the power of God through faith through Revelation through God revealing to you who you are you're being kept by that Revelation the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it it's the reason why you're here this morning it's the reason why you've decided to recognize and and take this message as your absolute it's what's given you the ability to recognize that God sent us a prophet in the 20th century it's it's the Revelation that's going to take you into the Rapture already taking place now amen who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time God bless you you may be seated thank you Lord glory to God Amen this morning we're going to look at taking the book we've been talking about the book we've been talking about the open book we've been feasting on the book we looked at how this book has become such such a focus in these last days and you know especially to to to the Sons and Daughters of God all of a sudden the Lord is bringing this book into Focus for us he's bringing it in such a way where where where listen you need to pay attention people are reading from the Bible they've been reading from that book but they don't realize that book has been opened they don't realize that it takes the spirit to give that book life amen praise God and so we've been talking about the book but now we need to go deeper and to see why it is that God is saying you need to take the book amen hallelujah let's go to the next scripture Revelations chapter 5 last week we let off we we left off you know talking about how it was back in the beginning how Adam Adam back in the beginning was made in the image of God he was the very expressed IM he was God the first Adam when he when he said let us make man in our image it was a spirit man but it was God in the man he was not just a Son of God he was God Amen that was the way it was and then it wasn't until after we see in Genesis chapter 2 that there was need for somebody to till the soil and so God took the dust of the earth created a body now for the spirit man to move into that body until the soil amen and then it was then that he started to name all the animals and and and because God had given him dominion over the Earth told them that their name was Adam it was only Adam but Eve was inside of Adam at that time and God said it's not good that he should remain uh you know alone and so God took Eve from the womb of the man and called her woman took took one of his ribs and created another vessel made of Flesh and Bone amen praise God she Adam himself he he told us it wasn't God that said that she would be the mother of all living it was Adam because Adam had with within him the book of redemption within him he held the book of life he held every understanding every concept of exactly what it was that God was going to express and he said she shall be the mother of all living and that's why we can Now understand by the open book that it wasn't an apple that Eve was deceived by but it was actually an adultery because Satan wanted to be a Creator he wanted to be somebody that could Express and and have children of his own so he goes and he plants his seed in there and now we see this whole Plan of Redemption we see this whole uh we see these the the these two Trails moving all the way from Genesis all the way to the Book of Revelation all the way to this time how there is a deceiver in the midst amen that wants to deceive your mind and get you off of who you really are you were not supposed to come through a natural sex ual birth originally according to the plan of God but he had a plan to be a redeemer to be a savior to be a Healer and in order for something to be redeemed something had to be lost amen so you were already in Adam when you were expressed in Eve and God knew that Eve would be deceived Adam knew that she would be deceived he knew she'd be the mother of all living that's why there's children of God and there's children of the enemy amen laying in a background here so that we can come and and take off from where we want to uh move on from and so understanding all of this it brings us into the clarity of this great deception that is that is moving even now in the land where people anybody can say I'm a Christian I go to church I believe in Christmas I believe that Jesus is savior I believe that he was the son of God but then he was the son of God and then there was a father in Heaven and now there's a holy spirit that's also moving but all three are are are are there's three there but they're all one you see they don't have a revelation that it's actually God come down from being father because father is God above us son was Jesus Christ coming with his own Brethren to be with us and to and to show him self as one of us and there was a great purpose in that and then the Holy Ghost when he was resurrected God by the Holy Spirit now in us but people don't realize this and they and they're still putting Jesus Christ back 2,000 years ago or putting him into a future event meanwhile he's here now he's already Come Oh Glory to God we're going to be looking at those things Revelations 5: 5- 7 will continue and one of the elders saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book because in the in the few scriptures before that there was there was a great Panic John was like freaking out there there's no man on Earth no man above the Earth no man below the Earth no man anywhere that could actually open the book amen because there was no man there is no man that can take the Bible and say I got an understanding on this I can tell you what when the coming of the Lord shall be even Jesus when he was the word made flesh yes sir 2000 years ago go back and read it in Matthew chapter 24 he said not even I know that second coming all he could give them was the conditions of the world the conditions that the world would be in when he would be coming and this is all he gave but he himself because the plan the book the book was still in the hand of of of the one that held it from the very beginning and that book had to be transformed it had to be it had to be uh given and placed into the hand of the Lamb the lamb had to take it let's let's move on come on now Saints glory to God he says Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb well wait a minute I thought there was one in the throne if you go back to Revelations chapter 3 or two you you'll see that there was that there was one that's that stood on the throne and that one is none other than God himself yes the alpha the beginning there's there's no two there we we saw it he saw one but now all of a sudden there's a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and now he goes and takes the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne well wait a minute here you mean somebody can go and take something from God impossible impossible it's not an actual book like our minds because we're we're we're you know we're brought into this Dimension where we we we read books we read words we we we we we get information through words and through books and and our mind automatically will instantly visualize books when we when when I say book you see a book in your mind you probably see the Bible in your mind but the but the but the book is God Adam held the book of life the book of the plan the book of everything that God was going to do which is himself he's the book he's the the the the the the volume amen praise God and so nobody can just go and take anything from God who sits in the throne it's because God was now changing and going into the position of lamb because there had to be a lamb that would be slain from before the f everything was all done and finished before the foundations of the world we need to get this perspective amen you're talking about God yeah he knows the end from the beginning everything was already in his mind everything was planned exactly how this Redemption would take place so he he doesn't need to figure anything out or to say oh oh wait a minute this brother's out of line I'm going to have to do this do that because it's going to change my whole plan are you kidding me that brother or that sister that's out of line is going to come in line amen and God will use whatever he needs to use to bring him in line Hallelujah you know what I'm talking about if you're a part of this word and this message you your life was was was was stirred up when this message came to you your life was changed all your friends thought you were cuckoo they said are you crazy what are you joining a cult with what's the matter with you you talking about God that's all you talk about is God why because God came into you God came into your life that's what this word is going to produce and unless you see it producing that where you will where your life will only look back to the word of God people say oh you take the word so serious you take it so serious you you you want to make it your abs don't you know those are just stories you see that's what Satan did when he deceived Eve he placed a false book into the hand of man and now man has his own book and they've created politics and they've created systems and they've created religions and they've created all these things for one purpose to take the people away from the real book amen Amen to make the people feel like they don't need the Bible they don't need the word of God they don't need an absolute but you will never take it from a son or a daughter of God because they are the word they can't identify with anything but the word hallelujah praise God and so here now we recognize that in this we see now let's go to the first quote here amen praise God the breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven seals now watch here is a verse I want to get to but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets now see the mystery of this seven seal book will be revealed at the sounding of the seventh Church Angels message we know that that was William Branham okay go back into your church history you just need to go back into regular church history you will see the messengers that started right from Ephesus from Paul being the first church age messenger all the way down to William brandham iith before him was John Wesley Martin Luther uh you know all all these other you know you can go back and you'll see the actual history of the seven Church ages of Christianity am amen go back and do your own homework these are things that I'm I'm bringing here today the seventh angel begins to sound and there's messages wrote out there and we got it in tape and in book form now at the beginning of the sounding of the message the mystery of God should be finished see at that time now we will notice the book of The Mystery of God is Not revealed until the seventh Angel's message message is sounded now these points will be important in the seals I'm sure because it must every bit tied together now I'm I'm I'm giving you this quote because we're gonna we're going to be expounding into all of this as we approach and move through this message because we need to see and recognize by the day that we're living in what has been fulfilled according to God's word and what is left to be fulfilled you need to know where you are on a map in order to get to where you're going amen you need to know where you came from you need to know where you're at and you need to know where you're going and the only way you can do that is you need signposts along the way amen praise God and so we need to realize that this Mi this ministry of William Branham fulfilled Revelations 10:7 where all the mysteries of that of those Seven Seals were finished they're finished a lot of people are still looking for them to to to to do something the seventh seal is open the purpose of the seventh seal was to bring Christ to the Earth brother Bram said that the opening of The Seven Seals was was the the purpose of the seven seal was to bring Jesus Christ to Earth amen and so a lot of people people are are are still pointing to a coming of the Lord Jesus not realizing he's already come he's already come and all the mystery of God is now revealed but there's certain aspects of the mystery that you are that needs to be revealed you see that's what that's what all of this is leading to because people go to church oh I go to church I belong to this church I belong to baptist I belong to Presbyterian I belong to Jehovah Witness I belong to Buddha I belong to Muhammad I belong to uh Islam I belong to Allah but do you belong to the word do you come to realize that you're in that church not as a member but I can show you a a lot of scripture that says God has called you according to his purpose yeah amen his purpose so and he didn't say some of you he said you behold I send un Malachi 4:5 there's another scripture for William brandham behold I send unto you unto you the messenger to turn your heart your heart don't be looking to turn other people's hearts unless your heart is turned first amen you got to know that you know what you believe as a Christian otherwise you're just a denominational churchgoer than you Jesus you're not going to have rapturing faith for the Rapture rapturing faith for the rap it's a supernatural faith that only God can give you personal you're not going to get it from your pastor you're not going to get it because you belong to this church or you belong to that church this is not about belonging to Good Neighbor Ministries church this is about belonging to the body of Jesus Christ that is right now going back to to to to the spirit man back to the original position where she has supreme authority over all of the earth thank you Jesus glory to God Amen Hallelujah let's go let's look at the next scripture he says here now in the breach he says now it's wrote mysterious because no man nowhere knows it God Alone Jesus Christ see now but is it is a book a m serious book we're talking about the book it's the book of redemption well we'll get into that in a little while and now we know that this book of redemption will not be thoroughly understood people are reading the Bible they're talking about Jesus the Savior the Redeemer the Healer he is all of those things and he's available to anybody that has enough faith for here healing or for health or for wealth whatever it is you can tap into the laws of God's word but you can never be a part of God unless you were a part of God back when Adam was expressed in the image of God thank you Jesus you can never be that unless you were there then and if you were there then you're going to say Amen to this message am you're going to say Amen to a prophet of Malachi 4 a prophet of Revelations 10:7 God never did anything in the Old Testament L he revealed it unto his servants the prophet why are you believing in following a man we don't even follow him we are following after him because in 1963 when the coming of the Lord came on Sunset Mountain to open the Seven Seals which a lot of people look into the Book of Revelation they think John was was was doped they think he was had too much Veno or something because he had all these visions and he's seen all these dragons and all these symbols they had no idea that the opening of The Seven Seals was going to actually be for this end time church that would receive rapturing faith for a Rapture to receive and to know that that they are that they're Christians and that they know that they're Christians they know that they're in the right Church they know that they're under the leadership of the Holy Spirit Spirit they know they've come under the five-fold ministry they're not afraid to recognize what God is doing in their day and coming under subjection to the word what would you have done back in the day when Jesus was on Earth and only a handful of people were following him they said he was a heretic he was a troublemaker he would he would be causing trouble but yet they couldn't deny that the dead were being raised they couldn't deny that the the sick were being made whole they couldn't deny the discernment when he went to the woman at the well and told her all about her life they they they just didn't understand those things and God does the very same thing in sending us a prophet in in the 20th century and Jesus Christ through the ministry remember it's always Christ amen never look to a man he had the voice of God speaking through him and any man that's anointed by the word of God in this day and in this hour under the father fivefold Ministry and and and and and has a revelation becomes the voice of God in the last days and to the people amen you've got to be able to discern between man and God you got to be able to discern doctrines of man and the revelation of God's word that strikes your soul and you say I see it I can't help it it's it's just it's clear as a bell the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against that nobody can convince me out of it if somebody convince you to come to church somebody will convince you to go to another church you'll be gone before you know it because this word will not find a resting place in your heart thank you but he says that it was misunderstood they've they've been probing it it's probed that through six Church ages but at the end when the seventh angel begins to sound his mystery he winds up all the Loose Ends that these fellows probed at Oh Glory and the Mysteries come down from God as the word of God and reveals the entire revelation of God listen look look what he's saying here he's in because Revelation 10:7 says the mystery of God it doesn't say Mysteries once you understand the mystery all the other Mysteries make sense if you understand the mystery of like I said to you at the very beginning that Adam was was Adam and Eve God was male and female superior male Superior female was in Adam it was God then you will understand the lie that the serpent came and said You shall be like God if you listen to me why how could she become like God because God was a Creator he could speak he could create and Satan wanted to be a Creator but he couldn't speak creation he could only use God's law of reproduction that said let every seed bring forth of its own kind now you see when you understand the mystery of God and who he is and what his plan was now the serpent Seed doctrine the teaching on the serpent seed becomes clear it's no longer a mystery adultery is the number one cause of broken marriages yes broken families broken lives on Earth I I'm not saying it just Google search it today you get married you better flip a coin without the Holy Ghost you got a less than 50/50 chance that your marriage is even going to make it oh yeah because Satan his desire was to have a family too but his family is perverted anything that God did Satan wanted to to to do it better and the only way he thinks he can do it better is by perverting it and that's why the people today they don't want the word they don't want to hear you tell them about Real Marriage that a man leaves his father and his mother and they two shall be joined as one all of that had a purpose in it God doesn't want people to be going from church to church because the woman and always represented the church God don't want you married to this one this week oh I'll go to the Baptist next week oh you know what I think I like Jehovah Witness maybe I'll go there you're hopping from church to church because you haven't found the right husband you're looking for a husband and there's only one husband to the Bride of Jesus Christ she's the unadulterated word of God remember Eve came from his side she will be exactly bone of his bone flesh of his flesh his spirit will will you know a lot of people say Danny you lost your mind you're absolutely right I'll show you the scripture that says that I've put on the mind of Christ Hallelujah because he's the only real mind in this day and in this hour that can bring peace and and and shity and Truth to the word of God Amen Hallelujah praise God and so they've they've they've looked at it and the mystery comes down from God as the word of God and reveals the entire revelation of God and then the godhead and everything else is settled look all the Mysteries see there it is serpent seed and whatever more is to be revealed now now you see I'm not just making that up that's what that's he says that's thus sayeth the Lord he was in the office of a prophet and when the anointing came on him on the opening of the word and he saw it as clear as he saw it it was because God was revealing it and he knew that it was God hallelujah praise God Amen thank you Jesus glory to God Amen and so here now we recognize that these things are are are taking place and the world just doesn't realize what what the real meaning of of of the book and and the word and the Plan of Redemption is all about and they're caught up into world's doctrines and man like we said has created his own book he writes it the way he wants our church trinitarian you want to be baptized you can be baptized we only baptize in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit well what's the difference you might as well baptize in the name of the Sharon uh the the the the the the the Rosa Sharon or the lily of the valley because he's described in all of those ways but when acts 238 Peter anointed by the Holy Spirit having received instruction from Jesus Christ himself after he had been resurrected Ed gives him the formula to go out baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and so we know that that's proper baptism it doesn't save you but it shows that you've got a revelation of what you believe it's an outward expression of something that's changed in you we got a sister that's going to be baptized next week that was baptized as a young woman but she says I did it out of fear I didn't realize what I was doing at the time I need to be re-baptized because this word that I'm hearing now I'm identifying with this word hallelujah glory to God and she realizes that something has changed on the inside and she wants to go to the Waters of [Applause] baptism let's go to the next quote and these things that we're talking about was to be revealed at the last day just before the last trumpet at the end of the message of the last Church age so listen carefully here what we're feeding on and what is being revealed to us this is the last time this is going to be revealed in the last time we've read these scriptures Daniel said seal It Up Until the End Time Jesus said it'll be known in the end time he says when you see the Fig Tree we talked about that a few weeks ago Israel becoming a nation in 1948 he said that generation that sees that will not pass away and we looked at how many years was a generation and we see that it's somewhere between 75 and 80 years well do the math from 1948 to where we are today we're we're there we're right in the ballpark Saints and God is a mathematician okay God is a mathematician and you will find him perfect he doesn't make mistakes if we you if you really want to research God's numerology and God's math go and go and search it it'll blow your mind you will see it everywhere Hallelujah so he says here he says it'll be revealed in the last Church age that's where we're at now it's we're at the end of it it's already over we've entered in the true church has already passed out of leoda and she's already moved into the Eternal Church age because it's an eternal Messenger to that age who's the Eternal messenger that came down in 1963 Jesus Christ how's he speaking to us today through a five-fold Ministry he he says I'm going to perfect my church now I'm going to call them I'm going to position them it's all about adoption it's all about God placing you giving you your position in the word of God and recognizing where you are supposed to be amen you've moved churches or you've you you're being pulled here and there because we're right at the end God is bringing into the body exactly who is supposed to be there he has a purpose for every s he says bone to its bone so if you're a part of my bone you can't escape this body because it's got to be bone to its bone it's the portion of the word of God that you are connecting with the portion of the word of God that's being assembled right here under this local Ministry whatever Ministry you might be under if it's that's where God is feeding you God God revealing himself to you there God making this message real to you and giving you life then you know you're in the right place I'm not pulling people from other churches I could be asking for a whole bunch of trouble there's three kinds of Believers in every church I'm not here to say you're a Believer you're an unbeliever you're a Believer you're no no you will identify by the life that you live I don't need to identify you the word is going to identify you the word is going to show if you're really really knowing who you are and you know that you know hallelujah praise God Amen God adds to the church such as should be saved we only want what God wants to add to the church and even more so as the day approaches amen praise God and so he says here in Revelations he says he says and and I just ref ref to you last night three times Revelations 10 1-7 see and in the days of the sounding of the seventh Angel's message the mystery of God would be revealed and finished and there's only one thing left when this seventh sealed book is open than the entire mystery of God why we've probed at it through through years and according to the scripture then we there was no way to understand it until this day you got to you got to realize that there's there's aspects of the word that you will not understand until it's your appointed day you can't force God you can't people want to be able to identify and they want to right off the pulpit they'll say oh nonsense they're not preaching they're preaching Pentecostal teachings it's a Pentecostal religion Pentecostal religion listen there is life in the church and once in a while you feel like shouting hallelujah praise God is because you've got a revelation and something stimulates you by the word of God to say amen glory to God but this is not a a a Spirit Revival oh watch no sir it's not about a Spirit Revival the reason why they're they're they're they're trying to identify those things and trying to to to to uh you know mock those things and say oh that didn't do anything that that that's not the word of God because they have no Revelation and they can't express Revelation their lives can't catch Revelation they think they've got Revelation but all they've got is quotes and and and doctrines and teachings of man and their own intellectual understanding of the word we don't want our own intellectual remember we said we take on the mind of Christ this this happens supernaturally a move of God is Supernatural it's not it's not orchestrated by man it's not okay we're going to bring these ones in we're going to bring in this one here we're this one here's got a a certain gift of you know he's a businessman you better be careful you could bring a businessman in here that all he's looking to do is catch the Sheep because he's got a business program in his mind thinking oh boy I can can bring together all those people you know I got I got this new business and if I can bring them in I can make a whole lot of money and you know what that does scatters the Sheep we're not looking for that we're this is not the hour for that this is this is God's business this is about the business of the Bride coming into her full position as a as a as a an attribute of God knowing who she is recognizing what portion of the word is now being fulfilled in her life and there was no way to understand it until this day because it's been hid that book was sealed and it had seven seals on that book but in Revelations 10 when he comes the mighty Angel which is Christ it's God it's Elohim yeah it's the the white wigged one the same the same God the Alpha and the Omega and he stood on the land and on on the sea the book was open because the lamb went and took the book from the one that was in the throne in other words he was going to be from lamb now from from from savior as a lamb that was slain before the foundations of the world to a to a man son of man Jesus Christ in the form of the of of of the theophany coming to express that he could have fellowship with his Brethren that he was going to connect with the other attributes of God he would say listen they have ears but they hear not but my sheep they hear my voice you see he was he was coming but a lot of people are hearing the word of God today they're reading the word of God but they're deny in the word of God they they will literally reject the word I've talked to ministers that have been studying the Bible longer than me and will try and convince me that there's three gods in one it just can't happen it's just impossible and the reason why they see it that way is because they their their their eyes have not been open to who he really is but in the seventh Angel's message message that's why you got to be careful when somebody tells you about a a messenger that came in 1963 to open the word of God and bring a progression to the word of God you got to be careful what you say about that man because Jesus Christ said I'll forgive you but when the Holy Ghost comes in his office of prophets and men to bring the unadulterated pure word of God you better be careful if you're not certain then keep your mouth shut and just wait and say Lord if this man has some sort of real significance to the world then I want to know about it let me humble myself and let your spirit reveal and let me search the scriptures you know what people don't take the time to search they don't want it they don't want to search they'll do one search and the first thing they'll put in is scam brandom boom oh yeah there it is it's it's all a cult it's all a scam there it is they don't want to put in William brandham 7eventh Church age messenger opening of the Seven Seals and then actually read look look into it look deeper into it allow your spirit to just be humbled for a moment don't let that ego get all a hold of you there because I know ego is a terrible thing it's it's it's it's so powerful man the man hates to be wrong he hates to be wrong he just you know even people that are born again people that are born again believing this message you know you got to be careful you talk a little bit to you know you get a little bit too far right away you see them raise up and say oh no no no no no you're not seeing it the way I'm seeing it let me tell you the way I see it I'm not interested in that I'm interested in the Holy Ghost I'm interested in the spirit of God coming into the midst and and unveiling himself in such a way that we both see it and now we know where the glory needs to go where the praise needs to go amen hallelujah where we need to look to God and see him in the power of his resurrection and that he can unveil himself to whom he chooses you can't figure out God you can't take anything from God you can't give God imagine a creation trying to tell the Creator I'm telling you the way it is good luck he says hath not the the ability to crush and remake the clay I thank God that he crushed and remade me this clay was a mess thank you Jesus you can look in your own life and you can see what God has done for you amen glory to God hallelujah hallelujah we've seen the symbols what it what it was symbolized by but but could not be correctly revealed until the last day see now then we must be there at the end time there's where everything is going to be revealed at the last time we're there I'm declaring it to you Saints I'm not saying it's tomorrow or the next day but all the things that Jesus told us to be watch he says watch for false christs he says many of them are going to rise up in that day they're going to rise up and they're going to say Lo he's here Lo he's there to the bride she's watching the word she's not watching churches she's not watching YouTube programs that the last Revelation must be seen unveiled five minutes ago you ever see those two those YouTube videos revealed five minutes ago of the coming of the Lord I said my goodness you guys missed it by 70 years glory to God Amen praise God God is already on the scene he's already calling a people he's already Gathering his church one's going to be taken out of the bed one will be left behind you know how many marriages have been broken as a result of this message because the Revelation comes to one doesn't come to the other you know how many families have been broken up because of this message and I'm not saying when I say this message I want to make it clear it's the message of Jesus Christ the word for our day it's Christ just like the way he came 20 years ago he's the same yesterday today and forever he says I don't come to bring peace he didn't but he's not saying I've come to destroy no he's come to bring the word the sword he says I've come to bring the sword what is the sword it's the word and the word when it's when it's properly identified and properly you know placed you're if you've got representation in you that says Amen to the word it's because you were always an attribute of God there was never a time that you would have said yeah you could have said no temporarily when you were in that condition that you were in but once God gets through to you was like Frank you know he says I remember when you came you know you come into the church you come into this into the store every morning we were just talking about it last week he says you'd come in he says you know you'd be listening to brother brandham and you be talking about this messenger and you be talking about how we we need to see this this this is this is amazing and and I was sitting back listening I thought you know and then and then he says I remember when you gave me a t I said just listen take the time to listen and he says I took it and his life went whoop upside down the Holy Spirit opened up his understanding he said that's the prophet of Malachi 4:5 that's God's word that's God unveiling himself in our day that's God sending a message to all these confused churches no wonder you you don't know which church to go to you have no idea where the truth is but God is not the author of confusion God will make it plain and he'll make it real to you personal that's the beauty of this that's why I always tell people listen Danny oh Danny you know tell me about your church I said you know what you need to come and see come and hear the word and see what it does for you that's all I can say because it's not me that's going to convince them if I convince them somebody will take them out their family or their friends will say get away from that man that guy's cuckoo he's too religious we're a million miles from religion we are Sons and Daughters of the Living God that have recognized that he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah praise God Amen amen and so here let's let's let's move along here he says now the reason that John wept because if no one could get the book all creation everything was gone you imagine the whole Old Testament you barely even hear anything about a book you might hear a little bit in Ezekiel you might hear a little you know here there but you don't hear about it in this way but the Book of Revelation is the end time book it's all about revealing the end and the things that are going to happen in the end time and a lot of people want to take the Book of Revelation and put it way off into a future but the Book of Revelation has been talking about the end and you know when it started 2,000 years ago when he was on the on the AL pmos because a lot of those Church ages all those seven Church ages they've already passed everything that was under seal number one to seal number six was all under the seven Church ages and all those things had been opened under the Sixth Seal first world war second world war and there's another one coming and it says woe three it it's go there's one more to come so we need to place everything properly into its proper season and recognize what it is that was unveiled nobody know nobody understood the White Horse writer if you had to talked to any and even a lot of churches today if they hadn't heard the message that William brandham brought in 1963 on the opening of those Seven Seals they would have been a lot of them would have still been believing that the white horse rider was Jesus the first horse rider in in the Book of Revelation and the second horse rider they would have thought that the red horse rider was Jesus just taking on you know and and and putting on a crown and then the black horse rider you know going to the people and establishing ing the churches and and and and the wars and and all of the all of the you got to go back and study we're going to do a study on those on those Seven Seals again I believe it'll be a blessing but nobody knew or understood that those horse riders were Satan changing his disguise he was going from religious to joining with the church in the in the in as the red horse rider connecting with the church and state making it look like that that that Christ listen you go back to a D 3:25 and you will find out that that was where they instituted baptism in the titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost you can go back and Google search it it'll tell you Nia Council 325 ad it was when they actually instituted baptism up until that point it was all done in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there's magazines with articles that show this but it was the Catholic church under Constantine joining church with State and who's joined with the state right up until this day church and state they still have power over the state and politics amen but they didn't know these things these things were all written under those Seven Seals and it took a messenger to come and break those seals to loose what was under those seals and even when even when when when the book and the seals were were were released seven Thunders uttered their voices and John was told to seal it up don't write those things because those things that were written into those seven Thunders pertained to another group of people yeah that would receive faith in this day and in this hour Hallelujah let's move along and so he says here he says everything would be gone imagine the whole the all of creation would be gone in other words everything would just stop and the whole Plan of Redemption would have stopped had nobody gotten a hold of that book and was able to open that book so that somebody could receive their word for their day and progress and fulfill their part in the word not he says my word shall not return unto me void so every scripture that he spoke and wrote about prophecy into the future has to be fulfilled heavens and earth will pass away but his word it will not pass and that's why he could not break the pattern of the restoration of bringing Adam back into his and her rightful position keep that in mind Saints there's a reason for the book there's a reason why God had all of this where imagine all of creation would have been lost everything would have been L he goes on she would just simply turn back to atoms and molecules and so forth and Cosmic light and not even be creation person nothing else cuz Adam lost the rights to that book what remember we said Adam was in the expressed image of God he held the book he had the whole plan all everything was perfectly set in the mind of God but he lost it when he when he allowed Eve to fall into sin and then gave himself for to redeem her and that's all a type remember Jesus came to give himself to redeem the Gentile church back to himself everything so the pattern cannot be broken so here now he realizes that Adam lost the rights to the book he forfeited when he listened to his wife and she listened to Satan's reasoning instead of the word of God when that When God Says You shall not eat of the tree of Good and Evil well that tree was the serpent he's still the same tree today in in today's civilization people are reading from the book book of the Tree of Life of Good and Evil I had a long discussion with my oldest daughter the other day it was fantastic I could believe how much Revelation she's actually caught it's it's amazing they're so close they're they're just pondering around it because they've tapped into what the what the Tree of Life of Good and Evil is here but Satan's only aspect that he could use because it would be so deceiving that it would deceive even the very elect if it were possible but the one thing that he knew he had to do was he needed to have his own creation of people he needed to have his own bride that would listen and follow his teaching so that they could take their eyes away from the word he said it in the beginning the day that you eat eat thereof you shall surely die that never changed when you feed on the word of knowledge good and evil I don't care how beautiful and how pure that glass of water is One Drop of Poison and you're done that's all it takes but that's what the enemy did and that's why this whole restoration cannot be broken the pattern cannot be broken he's looking for a bride without spot or wrinkle I'm not talking about people that are perfect you'll never be perfect brother Gabe I'll never be perfect there's not one person in here that'll ever be perfect and I'm not saying that to anybody oh you got to be perfect to come to this church no sir mostly the ones that are imperfect are the ones that come here because they know they need God they know they can't do it on their own they know they need a higher power over what's controlling them and and and the reason why they can't overcome and they're still in this cycle they get up one day and then the next day they're back down on their face again they get up they get down why because they haven't met the one that the woman at the well met y who was in worse shape than any one of us here yes had five husbands a prostitute but when she got a drink of that water woo Hallelujah glory to God that's the water I'm feasting on that's the water that gives life that's the water that that caused her to get so excited she became so bold even as a prostitute she went in and her testimony converted the town woo glory to God hallelujah let the Holy Spirit get a hold of you one of these days I'll tell you it'll change your life it'll transform you it'll make you who you're supposed to be glory to God hallelujah glory amen Adam lost the rights of that book he forfeited it when he listened to his wife and she listened to Satan's reasoning then it couldn't go back into the dirty hand hands of Satan Satan could never receive Revelation no it had to go right back to the one who who had it in the beginning and that's why he kept it and he sat on the throne and he says this is all going to play out no worries I'm going to make sure that this book that I get back into my rightful position in the end time according to the season that I am going to come and I am going to re and I am going to be in her she will know that I am their God she is my people My Chosen my elect my body Flesh of My Flesh bone of my bone amen she will come to know it Hallelujah that it couldn't go back into the dirty hands of Satan who tempted her out of the way so therefore it went back to the original owner like any abstract deed only the original owner can go in and claim and redeem something that was his from before anything and he says you were written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundations of this world this plan is just playing out you're just recognizing that you're an actor in the play you didn't know the part that you were going to play did you you walk in here one day and you thought oh this is an interesting Church this is interesting these people are interesting that guy's pretty zealous up there but something inside Burns did not our hearts burn every time I come to this church at in my early years and still to this day my heart burns within me when God speaks when I allow the spirit of God to speak and to to go into the to the Deep places of my life where he can set me free and I say thank you Lord have your way Lord deliver your servant Lord deliver your children Lord that's what this is all about Saints this has gone back now to the to the abstract deed has gone back to the to the original owner amen goes right back to its original owner and that was God the Creator who made it and he holds it and there's a price and that's Redemption and that's why the lamb who was slain from before the foundations of the world was was showing that there would be a lamb that would come and be born not of sex no your downfall as a human being and every single human being on this Earth is because you came by sex what is this guy crazy no I'm telling you you came by procreation by by an act between your mother and your father and it's all part of the plan so don't worry it's not you're cursed but that was the original curse and it needs to be reversed and the only way it's reversed is you must be born again you must be born again you've heard it but now you're you're starting to see you got to be born by the word the word has to awaken you the word and you'll respond to the word showing that there's a birth taking place and I don't know about you but when I went in and I watched the births of my children it was messy painful screaming but then comes forth life Hallelujah and there's no birth that's not going to be a little messy you're going to find yourself in situations people are going to say you're crazy what are you doing what are you doing forfeiting your religion giving up what youve been you were born a Catholic you got to die a Catholic but if you're born again you'll never die you'll be identified with eternal life thank you Jesus you will represent who you really are hallelujah praise God glory he says right back to the original and he says and there's a price and that price was Jesus Christ going to the Cross as a man as a man why did he have to go as a man he didn't have to go as a man and why did he have to come a virgin birth because he had to come the original way that Adam would have just looked to Eve and said eve you're going to bring forth Gabriel and in her womb would have been instantly a seed if that's how God wanted to do it all could have also called him right out of that Dimension like Jesus when he walked right into the room with the the the apostles and the disciples and they looked they said Lord is that you he walked through the wall he was in his theophany body he had a body that could move between dimensions and that's the kind of body that you are sitting next to right now that's speaking to your heart that's making you understand what it is that's coming off of this Pulpit that's giving you something Amnesia lifting from your mind and you're recognizing something and you just you you can see it but you can't fully don't worry about it let it unfold you can go back and listen to this message and you can listen to other message you go back and go back and listen the God of this evil age go back and listen to messages Christ The Mystery of God revealed the spoken word is the Original Seed go back and listen to those messages you will hear things that you never heard before because a little more of the veil is has been lifted hallelujah who made it and he holds it and there's a price and that's Redemption there's some price for Redemption and there was nobody that could do it so he said made his laws his own laws of kinsman redeemer that's why a Kinsman had to go a Kinsman is a man Flesh and Blood that's what a Kinsman is a theophany could not go to the cross it couldn't even die it wouldn't die because it's it's Eternal so had to go as a man a kinsman redeemer amen that there's all kinds of types go back and read the book of Ruth and and how Boaz was the Redeemer and all you know glory to God there's it's everywhere then they could find nobody everybody was born of sex born of sexual desire he was in the original sin Satan and Eve so he could not do it there is no man that's why there wasn't there was no man that that's why the original sin was Satan and Eve bringing forth Cain and Abel Cain comes out and he's a murderer why was he a murderer because he was like his father the devil but Abel who went and was brought forth because when Eve went to Adam and said look at this this is amazing you got to do this with me it brought forth Abel and Abel had a revelation of who he was because he was coming through a son of God Hallelujah and he knew what to give as a sacrifice and that's why Cain was jealous because he saw Abel giving a sacrifice unto the Lord it was a lamb because it had to be a lamb that would come and redeem his bride the Lamb of God that would take away the sins of the world and Abel by faith the Bible says Abel by Faith by Revelation made an acceptable sacrifice unto the Lord and God accepted it and rejected Cain's sacrifice because he knew he was of his father the devil and Cain goes and kills the first murder in the Bible who was it Satan's son praise God no he says his own laws of kinsman redeemer then they could find nobody every man was born of sex born after sexual desire he was in the original sin Satan and need so he could not do it there is nothing in him no holy Pope priest doctor of divinity whoever he might be there was nobody worthy and he couldn't be an angel because it had to be a Kinsman it had to be a man if a man sin a man had to die but Jesus was a perfect man he had to be a a lamb without blemish when the children of Israel used to bring the lamb to cover their sin that lamb had to be a a a perfect lamb without any blemishes and they they slit the throat and the innocence of that lamb would go on The Sinner and it would cover their sin but it wouldn't take it away but Jesus took your sin away because you needed it you were a mess you were you were in sin you you done all kinds of stuff adultery uh lying cheating stealing you were doing it all but he says Justified as though you never done it in the first place you you you accept the blood of Christ you accept that that that sacrifice of redemption you're White Snow White as though you never done it in the first place glory and he couldn't be an angel because he had to be a Kinsman he had to be a man then God himself become a Kinsman by taking on human flesh through the Virgin birth and he shed his blood that wasn't the blood of a Jew it wasn't the blood of a gentile it was the blood of God himself it was the Holy Ghost that he had given went up when he died on the cross and he said it is finished and when the Holy Ghost came down on the day of Pentecost it was looking for his bride Hallelujah glory to God we're saved through the blood of God Amen Glory Hallelujah let's go on next scripture we're going to move a little quicker here but we're not going to finish at one but I hope you're going to be able to just take in what's coming forth amen and when he had taken the book The Four four beasts and four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb every having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sang a new they sung a new song Imagine now remember it was always the 24 elders and the cherubims and the angels that were constantly giving worship unto the Lord the Almighty God but now they're singing a new song because he's he's gone into a new position he's now IM morphing himself from on the throne king of glory into a man that could now be slain and and take away the sins of the world now the Plan of Redemption could be fulfilled now there would be one that could go and actually fulfill the purpose they sang a new song and they said Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to who could be worthy other than God himself it wasn't a a a bloody lamb like an actual bleeding animal that went there and and went into the middle and and and he took the book he didn't just he said give me the book who can do that you can take anything from God you going to try to do that good luck Hallelujah Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and H has redeemed us to God by the blood of out of of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and priest he's talking about this Blood being good enough for anyone on the Earth right across the Earth nobody's exempt I don't care if you believe Allah and Muhammad if you can receive this Revelation today you will leave that and you will prostate before Jesus Christ as Savior and Redeemer Hal Hallelujah but you need you need a revelation on God you need a you need to know who he really is amen and they sang and he says and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on earth now we're coming into something else here you mean there's a reason for taking the book and there's a reason why the one who took the book now that holds the book will play because remember a throne go back and read go back into history what is a throne it's where a king sits and a king in a throne has supreme authority he rules over the whole nation he says jump they jump he says sit they sit because it's his position as king he is the supreme leader supreme authority and now look look it he has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on Earth because remember this whole Plan of Redemption is here don't get caught up with the worlds were framed by the word of God there's other planets out there this is another thing you know people are going off into all these planets and they want to go into Mars they want to go here and there they're trying to look for what you're going to miss the whole Plan of Redemption and this Earth is going into a Great Tribulation and unless you receive the Holy Ghost for a Rapture you're going into tribulation with it and I don't know how you're going to end up how there's going to be survivors after the Great Tribulation there's going to be great the World War III is going to be ugly Saints it's going to be nuclear sorry that's scripture Hallelujah and I beheld and I heard a voice of many angels round about the throne and Beast and the elders and the number of them was 10,000s times 10 thousands and thousands of thousands God had now come to a place where he was going to be redeeming and he had made a place now where we could be brought back to our rightful position like Adam and Eve was in the beginning glory to God Amen oh Jesus Hallelujah what slide number is that thank you let's go to the next slide brother Bram speaking here I know there's a lot of quotes here but this is where I'm drawing all this inspiration from Saints this messenger came to unveil the word and we need to pay attention here because we're talking about this open book and how important it is for this book now to be in our hands he says here now before we can lay down the lids of his Bible we can open up the Bible Lids but we cannot open up the Bible there's only one can do that and that's Christ remember we said they're reading from the Bible they're reading the same scriptures that we're reading but they're not seeing the same things that we're seeing here because Jesus himself says I open and no man shuts I shut no man will open the Bible is in the hand of God so now we know the one that sited on the throne he's holding a book now we know that it's the Bible you mean the Bible is the book yeah but the book is closed unless it's open to you the book is still closed to 99% of the Christian world out there they there's they got an open book They're reading the same scriptures but they're not seeing why God required a prophet in the 20th century to come and restore and open the understanding that was in those Thunders that was in that could not be written even Daniel said you got to seal that up that's not going to be available till the end time so there's things being released right now that that's what we're interested in knowing that's what we're interested in in in looking into the why why we need to be a part of that and he says here now it's in the hand of God on a throne like that and there was no man in heaven and no man in earth see how he's he's going back to that scripture he's going and no man beneath the Earth was worthy to take the Bible so now we understand that the Bible the book is the Bible but yet the book is open and yet the book is closed if you don't have the new birth and the revelation of the holy spirit that that gives the word life the letter kills but the spirit gives life Hallelujah bring the heat down a little bit to take the Bible to open it or to loose the Seven Seals that was sealed on the back side of it and John begin to weep and one of the elders said weep not for the lamb that was slain before the foundations of the world was wor worthy and able to take the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and to open it and to loose the seals thereof and that's the Lamb of God that was slain before the foundations of the world the lord Jesus Christ so who was the lamb the Lord Jesus Christ when was he slain before the foundations of the world who could take the book no man can go and just you can't walk up to a King's throne and just say give me that and take it from him you can't do it it was God moving from father into son so that he could go to the Earth and pay the ultimate sacrifice as a man Hallelujah glory to God he said weep not so and he and and to open it to loose the seals thereof and that's the Lamb of God God that was slain before the foundation of the Lord Jesus Christ may he come this afternoon today and open our understanding may he take the things that's written in this book and give them out of the people give them out to the people just as they have need of it you need understanding you need this book to be open to you clearly so that you can see the part that you are in the book The part that you're fulfilling in the book to give you the faith and the confidence to keep pressing on you'll give up you'll you will give up listen this message right now I'm telling you it's progressing it's moving on it's not about oh big camp meetings and we're going to gather all the churches together and we're going to have a big unified camp meeting you'll have a unified camp meeting and a and a thousand of them will come to the Altar and next week 900 85 of them will be right back into the world doing and living the way they were before the camp it's not about praying from morning till night oh I'm going to pray I'm going to I'm going to bring down the angels of God I'm going to preach a message brother I'm going to I'm going to fast and pray for seven days before I bring my next message that ain't going to do it this is not the bride is here the bridegroom's here the bridegroom's here you got to recognize the hour that you're living in so that you don't get caught up and start putting things too far off into the future you need to bring them into the current into the moment that we're living in in the hour where where he himself is moving in the midst gently moving in the hearts and the and the lives of the people glory to God Amen praise God listen here he says uh in in uh Hebrews let's go to the next slide Hebrews chapter 10 we're going to try to move quickly now we might be another 20 20 minutes or so let's see I want to get this out I want you to receive it all and and then just let it chew on it for the next couple of weeks there's so much wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest not listen God's not looking for your sacrifices anymore he's not looking for you to pray like I said six days he's not looking for you to to to to to you know work everything up I'm GNA bring camp meetings together I'm gonna put everything together just do the simple things that God listen we just need to get this word out we just need to allow the Holy Spirit to get this word and this Revelation into the hearts of the five-fold ministry and and not get caught up people want to stop at William brandham they just want to stop right there that's the you know that's the danger you know here when God was moving through Luther and Wesley if the people didn't move on from Luther and go with Wesley and then move on to Pentecost if they had just because a lot of people they stopped at p p and meanwhile William brandham was the messenger to the Pentecostal age to open they were they were rejoicing over the gifts they still do they'll bring you into the church and they'll try to move your mouth to speak in tongues come on speak in tongues this will be the evidence that God is with you and that God is in you that's not the evidence of the Holy Ghost the evidence of the Holy Ghost is your ability to recognize God in your day what he's doing right now how he's transforming your life and changing you right now and making making the Rapture a reality in your life hallelujah praise God we need to understand so here now he's saying in Hebrews 10 he's saying sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me in burnt offerings and sacrifice for sin thou H has no pleasure God's not interested in your sacrifices and how much money you give to the kingdom of God or anything else he's looking for a body that he can dwell in amen he's looking for a vessel that he can possess and take control over and not my will be done but your will be done Lord that's the what he's looking for he says then then said I lo I I come in the volume of the book it is written of me what listen the book The open book it's all him it's all his story it's all about his Plan of Redemption how he's bringing you back into your rightful position as a son or a daughter of God and this he he's he's making it clear now listen pay attention I'm in the book and I want you to be in the book with me I want you to be back into that rightful State like Adam was Spirit man in the image and the expression of God expressing himself here on Earth because God was expressing a new plan new plan listen there was other civilizations I can tell you that it's proven they've shown millions of years that it was all there but it's got nothing to do with this plan it's all you got to go back and you got to stop where God started with you he says to do thy will oh God above when he said sacrifice and offerings burnt offerings and offerings for sin thou wouldest not neither had pleasure therein which are offered by the law when you're doing things by the law it doesn't please God don't be coming and cleaning the house of the Lord because you're doing it by law because you have to do it do it because God has given you a revelation of your position in the body of Christ and that he will bless you and anoint you and prosper you in your position in the body and it edifies the rest of the body amen he says here which are offered by the law then said he lo I come to do thy will oh God he taketh away the first the first Covenant the first Covenant that that that had to be taken away the the law covenant could not work anymore it's not going to be by the blood of bulls and goats it's not going to be by the by by the shed blood of lambs it's going to be by the blood of Christ he's the only one that can restore you back into your rightful position that's where the new birth takes place takes you out of your carnal nature being born by sex now being born again by the spirit word of God placing you into your rightful position and he taketh away and I come to do thy will oh God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second by the which we are Sanctified through the offering of the the body of Jesus Christ once and for all finished we have no more to do with anything that's why I was explaining to my daughter I said Christina I said the one element that must never be left out in this whole plan because they're tapping into Source they're tapping into the universe they're tapping into the laws of God and and how how they they're Souls have have uh come into this Dimension and how there's other dimensions and that you know they're going to come into full Consciousness and everything else but I said do not leave out this key it is the absolute key that cannot be removed it is God's Plan of Redemption through Jesus Christ your birth certificate Bears record that you were born 1988 years after Jesus Christ this world has a testimony he's the only one that died and rose from the dead that could give his own life and come back and and and have a purpose in all of that and if you take out that one element I don't care how close you are how much you believe in in the universal laws you could even meet an individual that has the ability to do miracles signs and wonders Jesus said there'll be false christs false Christ are false anointed ones that can do Miracles they can do things that that other people can't do and you would think oh boy but if they're not going back to the word of God and they're not making Jesus Christ the absolute the word and we need to put Jesus Christ into its proper perspective otherwise we miss the whole thing he says no man comes to me comes back to the father because the father was was the original Adam back in the very beginning that was expressed in the image of God the spirit man and called their name Adam Adam and Eve it has to go back to that you can't go back to the father but by Jesus Christ and that's why he himself is the one that came in 1963 and stood upon the land and upon the sea and said time shall be no more that was Jesus Christ coming to open the seals and unveil the secrets and the Mystery behind him what his purpose was in coming to the Earth what it's always been from before the foundations of the world why he says you now you got to take the book let's move on here and so here Revelations 10 go to the next slide I'm not going to read the whole thing but I want to point out he had in his hand a little book and now it was open so now we know who opened the book it was the lamb and we know that the lamb was Jesus Christ and we know that Jesus Christ was God himself changing his his position come from father coming to to the son through Jesus Christ and now coming in the form of the Holy Ghost in the mighty Angel himself coming in these last days to indwell and possess the Sons and Daughters of God and with him came a cloud and that cloud within that cloud there was I believe there was there was a cloud of witnesses I believe within that cloud there could have been some theophany bodies that were coming to the Earth come on Saints there's there's a lot more that's going on here than what meets the eye God was coming to to redeem his own God was coming to call his own the head was coming to meet with the body but the bodies the ones that were caught into the the spiritual Amnesia that were caught into religion caught into Christian religion maybe under the Catholic Church the Baptist the Presbyterian all these different doctrines of man but in there were Sons and Daughters of God that would hearken and respond to the word and he comes now and he opens he was the only one that could open the seals and within there then then I want you to notice the mystery of God should be finished and we just talked about it how the mystery of God was the godhead it was God always it was always God MDC was God in a theophany body he was the one that had no mother no father he was the one that that had no beginning and no end who could have who could that possibly be it was God coming down to make a promise and to meet with Abraham and to tell him about the promise that we are now fulfilling in this day hallelujah praise God and so I want you to notice here it just continues to progress it moves on the head comes to meet with the body anything or listen you you you you've got to have been there with him in order for you to respond to this word that's now being released into the hearts of the people amen and he said time shall be no more glory to God he came with an open book he came with the book in his hand and I want you to notice I want you to notice here go to the next scripture he moves on here we're winding this down he goes on and he says now he says to the to the uh the angel says to to to the voice says he says which I heard John now John being a type of the Bride he's hearing now and and he sees unto him and that voice spoke to him and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth now why is he now telling the bride to go and take the book because remember Adam in the original creation of God was Adam and Eve the spirit man the revelation of God himself on Earth having full Dominion full Authority sitting on the throne with absolute Authority and he says go and take that book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and I said unto him give me the book oh my good you better have confidence in knowing what it is that God is is placing into your hands you need to recognize the hour that we're living in where you can actually have the confidence and the knowledge and the ability by faith to go and take the book out of the right hand take the book out of God's own hands why because you were Eve you were the one that was with him before the foundations of this world he can't fulfill his word without you he can't finish this job without you he can't take us to the white Throne judgment without you you've got to be a part you've got to sit what did it say in leoan in in Revelations chapter 3 he says to him that overcometh in this last age will I grant to sit with me where in my Throne Hallelujah and what is it to sit in a throne it's a supreme authority and there isn't two in the throne amen no sir we're not looking for two people to sit in the throne we're not looking for some kind of divided understanding on the word of God no God is his own interpreter God is going to make it plain God is going to have a people on this Earth that's going to recognize why they're why they're you know I couldn't understand back in 1994 when I came to this message this scripture struck me and I don't even know how and why it struck me so hard but I went out and I got the email address rev 1011 at hotmail.com because that that scripture became real to me I didn't fully understand it but I just knew that it was something that I was a part of amen and you got to know that you've taken the book you've got to know that you've been feeding on this book that it's a reality to you it's not just a Bible it's not just some man's teaching it's a reality amen today I I got rev 1011 at gmail I like G for God God's mail today Hallelujah I want present truth brother I want I want to receive messages in the present right now amen glory to God I want Gmail I want God's male I want God's male attribute to be expressed in my life as a female aspect of Jesus Christ glory to God Amen he says and I look he goes and now he says take it and eat it up and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and I ate it up takes confidence and courage to do it Saints and he said unto me thou must prophesy again this message needs to go out what message this message what Revelation this Revelation a lot of people are preaching from this scripture but they don't understand how real it is now how there's some Awakening right now amen glory to God let's go to the next uh we're gonna this is where we're going to end we'll be done in 5 to 10 minutes now listen here message 1965 the the God of this evil age remember what I told you he's going to try and deceive by impersonation but this bride she can't be impersonated as she is part of the groom true to him in every Point waiting the wedding uniting not at an ecumenical council this is not an ecumenical council move we're not looking to join the big ecumenical council even though going on right now as we speak but in the sky Oh Glory at a wedding supper she has been given this is for our own church I'm not talking about this church brother bram's not talking about brandom Tabernacle he's talking about the body of Christ she has been given and revealed to her the seven seal Mysteries of the Bible the word has been opened up to her she SE SE the Folly of the deceiver that's one thing she could never be deceived so very close to the truth that almost deceive the elected she sees it she see the the the the the two opposing Spirits at work in this evil age can you see it each very religious Cain and abble Spirits again coming to their heads still same as they started one worshiping by Beauty and by knowledge and by education and by science and by ethics and the other one by Revelation by faith of the revelation of the word of God Amen people say I got faith if you've got faith then you've got an understanding of what God is doing in your day both of them is standing right in this building this afternoon that's right next slide he says but in obedience this little faith woman that lives by Revelation by faith the bride the person here there here off somewhere else some other Church some other denomination whatever it is is not believes the word of God obedient waiting in love oh God for the promise of the age to be confirmed what age are we are we pointing to a future age here are we pointing to a future event it's on now the Rapture is now in progress we're now caught up into Heavenly places in Christ Jesus feasting on the word of God and one's Awakening over here another one's Awakening over there one coming to an understanding over here they didn't see it fully but now they're starting to wake she's watching for it she's a part of that word and she is is watching for her life to manifest that word brethren can't you see that I hope that didn't go over you Hallelujah glory to God these things are going to go right over the heads of the people they're not going to realize what the holy spirit is doing in this hour and they're just going to go on as they were but God is doing a mighty uh work right now listen as we close let the musicians come the body is waiting for what which is the word waiting for the life which is the spirit to confirm or make it alive to make this word live in her life amen that's got to be our prayer Lord let this word live in my life make it confirm it or make it alive that's what she's waiting for no other life will work in her she can't come to life any other way yet she feels it out there she knows it's going to happen then here it happens then she wakes up Hallelujah glory god said let there be and she came forth like the first one come forth which first one the one he said let us make man in our image so that you can have dominion over the Earth so that you can rule and and and reign with me over the Earth because you know that once we go in the Rapture our job our position here as the church is finished yes we come back after three and A2 years to to rule for the 1,000-year Millennium there're that Jesus Christ will have a government but he's going to need some embassadors he's going to need some Statesmen he's going to need Sons and Daughters of God that will be with the right character so that she can rule with him from the throne and then after the thousand years what happens the white Throne judgment and that's when everybody's going to be risen up and they're going to have to be judged according to the works of their flesh Hallelujah let there be she came for it the real Church of God is watching for the coming of that glad Millennial day amen glory to God let us let's stand thank you Lord amen in 2 Corinthians 31:5 it says Do We Begin Again to commend ourselves or need we as some others Epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you ye are our Epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistles of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart that's who we are written Epistles true written Epistles of God for this day and this hour believes the word Waits on the word Waits on him to confirm his word doesn't go unpatient ahead and try to put her own interpretation on the word this is not the hour for us to put our own interpretation on God's word we will let him interpret his own word and such trust have we through Christ to God toward not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of [Music] god take the book Saints and do everything that you can to allow the spirit of God to yield you to his Spirit humble yourself this is a time where humility is going to pay off [Music] big big this is where man is going to need to be able to just step back not going to argue I'm not going to argue and say oh you only got to listen to the table Apes you go ahead listen to the tapes there's nothing wrong with I listen to them every day every single day I I just quoted 10 quotes 12 quotes here from the prophet I'm not going to go outside of the Prophet remember it's it was the word and God sends a prophet and then the bride will manifest by the Holy Spirit exactly what the prophet was saying back to the word she will not go and and and say anything contrary to what the prophet said but she knows that the word is moving on she knows that there's a progression to this word into this Revelation and to her position she's not just called bride she is bride she is Christ in the female aspect she is the fullness of the word now being expressed in these last days she recognize she knows what to do with the word of God she's not unconfident she's not oh I wonder if I can do this She lays hands upon the sick and the Bible says they shall recover that's not up to her to say when it's going to happen she believes the word she knows the word lives in her when we we pray for our food we bless the food we can we can say Lord I bless my children I bless this brother I bless that's why when don't ever hold back from saying God bless you brother there's nothing better than you could ever say to somebody and somebody with a revelation of that when somebody says it to them they receive it amen as the love of God pouring out of that individual's heart amen because when we say God bless you it's real it's a reality you can never say it too much oh you're too religious I don't care I want to bless as much as I can bless because God says you bless and I'll bless you glory to God Amen you bless others and God he just going to just test me he says test me with your tithes your offerings test me with your giving test me with your giving and see if God does I'm not telling you to give to this church I'm telling you to give by Revelation to the kingdom of God where God has placed you where God will bless you where God will prosper you try him and see if he doesn't pour out a blessing that you will not be able to contain let us pray father we so appreciate Lord Your
