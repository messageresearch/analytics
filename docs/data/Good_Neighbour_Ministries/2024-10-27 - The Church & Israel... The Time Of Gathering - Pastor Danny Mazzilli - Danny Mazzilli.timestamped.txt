[42:47] church the
[42:49] time of
[42:51] gathering last week we spoke on the time
[42:54] of
[42:55] Jubilee and we brought a thought
[42:59] that there's a sounding of the message
[43:03] in the trumpet of God that is setting
[43:06] all the captives free and it's a time of
[43:09] Jubilee for the church for the Gentile
[43:12] Church to receive the word for their day
[43:16] and to be loosed from the chains of
[43:19] denominational thinking man's
[43:21] interpretation on the word of God that
[43:23] it's a time to be set free from the
[43:26] slavery
[43:27] of all the bondage that
[43:30] religion religion is putting upon the
[43:35] people religion is not what we are we
[43:39] are not religious We Are Spiritual Sons
[43:43] and Daughters of God that have been
[43:46] awakened by the word of God for this day
[43:49] and in this hour and so uh last week we
[43:53] had brother Bill sound the
[43:55] chofar and this morning I'd like him to
[43:58] sound and and and to and to have it

[44:16] Holy Ghost

[44:25] where the Lord Jesus himself
[44:28] is in the
[44:29] church amen praise God we're living in
[44:32] Ephesians
[44:34] 4 where the church is being united and
[44:37] brought together for the perfecting of
[44:40] the body of Jesus Christ amen we're in
[44:44] the time of Revelation
[44:46] 4 where he says come up hither a time
[44:50] where the church is going to be called
[44:52] up so that she can recognize while she's
[44:55] in Heavenly places all all the things
[44:57] that are to come to pass you're living
[45:01] in that age amen we're in first
[45:03] Thessalonians 4 on Amen where the Lord
[45:08] himself shall descend glory to God
[45:11] hallelujah and we which are alive and
[45:15] remain shall not hinder those that sleep

[45:45] gathering go ahead brother Bill
[45:49] [Music]
[46:20] thank you brother Bill praise God
[46:23] hallelujah amen
[46:28] four if you take the number four and you
[46:31] multiply by two you get
[46:33] eight it's not Revelation 10:7 it's
[46:36] Revelation 108 it's not the ministry of
[46:39] Elijah it's the ministry of
[46:41] Elisha amen we've been given a Ministry
[46:44] in this hour to prophesy the word of God
[46:48] by the anointing because we've been
[46:49] given the book and it wasn't just a
[46:52] regular book it was the sealed book of
[46:55] God it was an open book it was unveiled
[46:59] to the Sons and Daughters of God in this
[47:01] day and in this hour and that word
[47:03] that's now in US is calling a
[47:06] resurrection it's calling Sons and
[47:08] Daughters of God wherever they are
[47:10] locked up bound up under denominational
[47:14] bondage under the chains of tradition
[47:17] wherever they are there is a sounding
[47:19] going out right now saying come up
[47:22] hither come out of her my people be ye
[47:25] set free from the from the chains of sin
[47:28] and unbelief amen glory to God God has a
[47:33] time right now where he's calling a
[47:35] people unto the Lord amen praise God
[47:39] let's look at the next
[47:42] scripture it says here in Deuteronomy 7:
[47:47] 6 and 7 now listen what he says here
[47:50] about his people for thou art an holy
[47:53] people unto the Lord thy God the Lord
[47:56] thy th God hath chosen thee to be a
[47:59] special people unto
[48:02] himself above all people that are upon
[48:05] the face of the Earth the Lord did not
[48:08] set his love upon you nor choose you
[48:11] because you were more in number than any
[48:14] other people but ye were the fewest of
[48:18] all people amen glory to God that's why
[48:20] listen don't be looking to you know for
[48:23] for the majority of of people to to
[48:25] believe what it is that you believe when
[48:27] it comes to the word of God you've been
[48:30] given Revelation on the word of God it
[48:33] goes so much uh so much into another
[48:37] realm as as Sons and Daughters of God
[48:40] that when you receive Revelation on
[48:43] God's word you come to realize that you
[48:46] are a
[48:49] minority you can't add people to your
[48:52] church all that we listen we could do
[48:54] all the Outreach and all the and and
[48:57] these are things that we must do we must
[49:00] testify we must reach out we must speak
[49:02] to people we must let them know the word
[49:05] that we've received in this day is the
[49:07] true word of God that liberates and sets
[49:10] you completely
[49:12] free but it's God that opens the
[49:15] understanding it's the Lord that gives
[49:17] Revelation it's the Lord because
[49:19] Revelation when you go to a person and
[49:21] you speak to them and and they're in a
[49:23] sick condition they might have a cancer
[49:26] they might have a a a you know a a
[49:29] disease in their body and you speak to
[49:32] them about the word of God for this hour
[49:35] and Revelation breaks into their heart
[49:38] it's not you going there to lay hands on
[49:41] them and praying over them that that
[49:43] actually did it though this is what we
[49:46] do but it's because the Revelation
[49:48] strikes the
[49:49] individual and they get healed and that
[49:52] is the interpretation of the word and
[49:54] now you try to get that person to deny
[49:57] God yes when God just supernaturally
[50:00] delivered them from whatever condition
[50:02] whatever circumstance there's no uh big
[50:07] sin and small sin it's all sin there's
[50:10] no big sickness and small sickness it's
[50:13] all sickness to God he can heal the L
[50:16] the the worst scenarios to the to the
[50:19] most simple scenarios amen praise God
[50:22] because he's the Lord God Almighty the
[50:25] one and only true and living
[50:28] God
[50:30] hallelujah so here now when we read this
[50:34] scripture I want you to see that God has
[50:36] chosen an Israel and God has also chosen
[50:39] a people for his name's
[50:41] sake see everything runs in parallels so
[50:44] as you as we're reading as we're
[50:46] speaking as we're teaching I want you to
[50:48] see the parallels until we come to the
[50:51] next aspect of this service to where we
[50:54] focus in on the
[50:55] Gentiles and then you will know where we
[50:59] and the Jews the Gentiles and the Jews
[51:01] fit into the whole prophecy of what is
[51:04] taking place in this day and in this
[51:05] hour but listen here the next scripture
[51:08] in Zechariah 12:10 he says in that day
[51:12] shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of
[51:16] Jerusalem so we we need to see here what
[51:19] it is that God is
[51:20] doing we need to understand that that
[51:24] Israel is a is a chosen people unto the
[51:27] Lord listen I don't I'm not here to you
[51:30] know to to to bash anybody I'm here to
[51:33] bring the word of God and these are
[51:35] scriptures from the word amen and here
[51:38] he says and he that is feeble among them
[51:41] at that day shall be as
[51:45] David and the House of David shall be as
[51:50] God as the angel of the Lord before them
[51:53] and it shall come to pass in that day
[51:55] that I will see
[51:57] to destroy all the nations that come
[52:00] against
[52:02] Jerusalem listen it doesn't matter what
[52:05] comes against the nation of
[52:09] Israel God already promised it by his
[52:13] word listen you go back and read the
[52:15] book of Isaiah go back read all the Old
[52:18] Testament books and and just pay
[52:20] attention lately I've been reading you
[52:22] know Old Testament scripture and I can't
[52:25] help but see every
[52:27] everywhere it's all over the place where
[52:30] he's talking about My People Israel I
[52:33] will stand with you I will go before you
[52:36] I will fight your battles I will put
[52:39] clothes on listen when when they were in
[52:40] the wilderness he was the god that was
[52:42] putting clothes on them he was the god
[52:44] that was feeding them he was the god
[52:46] that was fighting their battles amen he
[52:49] was giving them water to drink he was
[52:51] giving them Supernatural Mana from
[52:53] Heaven amen glory to God and you are
[52:56] that people this morning we don't feed
[52:58] on on on written word we're feeding on
[53:02] the logos The Living Word the Christ the
[53:05] same Supernatural Pillar of Fire that
[53:08] moved in the in the wilderness is that
[53:10] same Pillar of Fire that moves in this
[53:12] house here and moves into the pews and
[53:15] goes into your hearts and your lives and
[53:17] searches out the things that you need to
[53:19] be delivered of Amen he's still the same
[53:22] God if you've got a Deliverance that you
[53:24] need this morning you trust him you you
[53:27] you you reach out to him this morning he
[53:29] he'll speak to that need his word shall
[53:32] not return void if you can receive it it
[53:35] will come back
[53:37] Victorious Hallelujah glory to God and
[53:40] so no matter who comes
[53:43] against who comes
[53:46] against the children of Israel
[53:49] listen
[53:51] Hamas a year
[53:53] ago on October the 7th
[53:57] attacked Israel it was an unprovoked
[54:01] attack we need to understand the enemy
[54:04] when you look at them just just simple
[54:07] things here I want to bring I want to
[54:09] show you something about Hamas in
[54:11] particular okay Hamas was the one that
[54:14] that that that was used to launch this
[54:17] massive attack against the nation of
[54:21] Israel and this Hamas is not a word per
[54:24] se as an acronym like they would but in
[54:28] Arabic it stands for Islamic resistance
[54:32] movement and there's a very similar
[54:34] sounding word in Arabic that means Zeal
[54:37] or those who are
[54:40] zealous but let me tell you the irony of
[54:43] this in choosing this name for
[54:46] themselves is that Hamas is also a word
[54:49] in
[54:50] Hebrew and that means
[54:54] brutal unjustified
[54:57] evil Wicked
[55:00] violence amen last October the UT evil
[55:05] atrocities that amas had done to Israel
[55:08] we have firsthand been able to witness
[55:10] it and see the things that they did now
[55:14] we're not fighting against flesh and
[55:15] blood here I hope you're getting my you
[55:18] know uh the the the understanding here
[55:21] this morning okay we are not
[55:23] specifically targeting people we are not
[55:25] specifically speically targeting Muslims
[55:27] we are not attacking the Palestinians we
[55:31] are talking from
[55:33] scripture and don't tell me that those
[55:36] evil atrocities that they did that
[55:39] there's that there's no difference
[55:41] between killing and outright brutal
[55:43] murder slaughtering children women
[55:46] burning children in front of their
[55:48] parents doing all kinds of rape and
[55:51] everything else right there in front of
[55:53] their families that is not war
[55:57] that is just pure unadulterated demonic
[56:03] warfare
[56:05] Hallelujah and this word repeated
[56:08] throughout the Old Testament it's in the
[56:11] Old Testament and it's used to describe
[56:14] horrific acts of violence rape
[56:18] mutilation Slaughter of innocent
[56:21] people you can find it the Hebrew word
[56:24] Hamas the first time in Genesis 611
[56:27] where it says the word violence and what
[56:30] translated in Hebrew it's
[56:33] Hamas Hamas Hezbollah houthis they are
[56:38] all evil
[56:39] proxies that are operating under the
[56:42] leadership of demon
[56:45] power that is based in
[56:48] Iran it's been
[56:50] identified this is not I'm not bringing
[56:53] something new
[56:55] here that's why it's shocking that you
[56:58] know we see these things the US you know
[57:01] all the all the the the countries
[57:04] they're seeing this very Act of evil
[57:06] they're they're they're they're
[57:07] identified where they're headquartered
[57:09] how they're being supported how they're
[57:11] financially being supported with
[57:13] billions and billions of dollars from
[57:15] countries that are buying their oil and
[57:17] supporting Iran in certain ways it's but
[57:20] you got to understand they are blind to
[57:23] recognize prophecy and to recognize
[57:26] what God is
[57:28] doing the whole world is
[57:31] blinded to this and that's why they will
[57:34] just like nonchalantly allow it to go by
[57:40] happen though Israel does have support
[57:44] from Nations it's it's kind of like a
[57:46] muted
[57:48] support and you can see now that more
[57:51] are starting to turn against Israel than
[57:53] are for Israel
[57:56] this is the time and the season that
[57:58] we're living
[57:59] in and so I don't think it's a
[58:03] coincidence to think that these forces
[58:06] of Darkness that are under these these
[58:09] evil
[58:11] leaderships have chosen this name
[58:14] Hamas Satan knows and has been here
[58:18] fighting
[58:20] against God from before the foundations
[58:23] of the world the Great battle started
[58:27] before we came to this earth it's just
[58:29] manifesting here on the Earth but
[58:32] there's a plan that shows what the end
[58:35] is going to be amen and so all these
[58:38] players and all these demonic influences
[58:40] and powers and principalities they're
[58:42] not stupid in the way that they're you
[58:45] know naming themselves and putting
[58:47] themselves out there mocking the people
[58:50] even saying right outright death to
[58:53] Israel death to America imagine
[58:56] it's in their slogans death to America
[58:59] death to Israel and they can go and
[59:01] speak these things and then outright
[59:04] attack and send in over 180 ballistic
[59:07] missiles into
[59:11] Israel and stand back and say well you
[59:13] know what you got to be careful how you
[59:16] how you handle this
[59:18] response you got listen we're living in
[59:22] the time where prophecy overrides man's
[59:25] decision
[59:26] Visions they are being governed by the
[59:29] word of God whether they know it or not
[59:32] and you are blessed to be able to
[59:34] recognize what it is that God is doing
[59:36] in this day to realize that that God has
[59:39] provided a way for you out of this
[59:43] mess okay it's common understanding you
[59:47] can go into almost any Christian church
[59:49] and they'll tell you that there's going
[59:51] to be a Great
[59:52] Tribulation the only problem is is they
[59:54] don't really believe it
[59:57] they'll talk about it but the majority
[59:59] of them don't really believe it don't
[1:00:01] really want to talk about it they're
[1:00:03] afraid to expose it because hey what
[1:00:06] does that mean for
[1:00:07] me well if it really if you were really
[1:00:10] concerned then you would search the
[1:00:12] scriptures for in them you have what's
[1:00:15] found to be eternal life but you need to
[1:00:19] search the scriptures you need to find
[1:00:21] your placing in the word of God Amen
[1:00:24] praise God hallelujah so there is a
[1:00:27] difference in war between executing and
[1:00:30] and and doing the the the the atrocities
[1:00:33] that they're doing as opposed to an you
[1:00:36] know self-defense War which is what
[1:00:38] Israel is doing right
[1:00:41] now sure there's going to be innocent
[1:00:43] people that are killed and it's terrible
[1:00:46] it's not good but they must defend
[1:00:51] themselves they're a small country and
[1:00:53] if you look at their at their map you
[1:00:55] can see that just a small little sliver
[1:00:58] and they're surrounded by by the enemy
[1:01:01] all around them it's it's Muslim um you
[1:01:04] know uh people that are against Israel
[1:01:08] all kinds of different spiritual powers
[1:01:10] and dominions and principalities and
[1:01:12] they're all focused on one thing
[1:01:15] annihilate
[1:01:16] Israel they can't do
[1:01:20] it and so while this prophecy is all in
[1:01:24] progress we are under a
[1:01:27] prophecy we are under a prophecy that is
[1:01:31] drawing us together go to the next
[1:01:35] slide and so we're going to talk a
[1:01:37] little bit here about the time of
[1:01:39] gathering the Gentile
[1:01:41] church because when that sound of the
[1:01:44] trumpet that is now being sounded
[1:01:46] through the five-fold ministry through
[1:01:49] the through through the mighty Angel
[1:01:51] himself that has come down to call a
[1:01:53] people unto his name while all of this
[1:01:56] is going on in the world there's a
[1:01:58] people that are hearing their V their
[1:02:01] their name being called there's a people
[1:02:03] that are able to respond to the word of
[1:02:06] God it's a uniting time there's a
[1:02:09] uniting going on all over the world
[1:02:11] there's the you know what was it in 2018
[1:02:14] the pope was in in uh in uh uh the
[1:02:17] meeting there with the World Council of
[1:02:19] churches and trying to unite the
[1:02:21] churches together asking them and it was
[1:02:23] their seven their seven the anniversary
[1:02:27] there's the number 70 again he addressed
[1:02:30] the World Council of churches Central
[1:02:32] Committee and other delegates calling on
[1:02:34] Christians to work together in charity
[1:02:37] and to overcome the cultural and
[1:02:39] partisan interests uh um uh partisan
[1:02:43] interests he also said that Christians
[1:02:45] should not appear indifferent to
[1:02:49] those other
[1:02:52] so-called Christians
[1:02:56] denominations religions drawing them
[1:02:59] into a Unity of the World Council of
[1:03:02] churches well we know that this is
[1:03:04] supposed to happen this is scripture
[1:03:07] being fulfilled the United Nations
[1:03:09] Gathering Together mostly against Israel
[1:03:14] now and the true church is gathering
[1:03:19] into the body of Jesus Christ so that
[1:03:22] she can fulfill her part because the
[1:03:25] Gentile Church cannot be here when when
[1:03:28] when the the the angel of the Lord sends
[1:03:31] Moses and Elijah over to the 144,000 the
[1:03:35] nation of
[1:03:36] Israel the Gentile Church cannot be here
[1:03:40] and therefore there's a call and a
[1:03:42] gathering that's going on right now
[1:03:44] within the Gentile church and this is
[1:03:47] what we want to focus on this
[1:03:49] morning let's go to our next slide we're
[1:03:52] going to read some scriptures to lay in
[1:03:54] just some simple Foundation here Mark
[1:03:58] 4 and he taught them many things by
[1:04:01] Parables Jesus always spoke many times
[1:04:04] by Parables and said unto them in his
[1:04:08] Doctrine hearken behold there went out a
[1:04:11] s to seow and it came to pass as he
[1:04:14] sowed some fell by the wayside and the
[1:04:17] fowls of the air came and devoured it up
[1:04:20] and some fell on Stony ground where it
[1:04:23] had not much Earth and immediately it
[1:04:25] sprang up because it had no depth of
[1:04:28] Earth but when the sun was up it was
[1:04:31] scorched and because it had no root it
[1:04:34] withered away and some fell among thorns
[1:04:37] and Thorns grew up and choked it and it
[1:04:40] yielded no
[1:04:43] fruit he's talking about the kingdom of
[1:04:45] God here the whole Plan of Redemption so
[1:04:49] put your mind into that thought into
[1:04:51] that frame of thought as we're reading
[1:04:53] here and other fell on good ground and
[1:04:56] did yield fruit that sprang up and
[1:04:58] increased and brought forth some 30 some
[1:05:02] 60 and some 100 let's go to the next
[1:05:07] scripture so here now he says in Mark
[1:05:09] 4:13 to20 and he said unto them because
[1:05:12] they were asking him after he had told
[1:05:14] them the parable they said well you know
[1:05:16] uh can you give us the interpretation of
[1:05:18] the parable you know we we want to
[1:05:20] understand and this is what he said and
[1:05:22] he said unto them know ye not this
[1:05:24] Parable don't you understand understand
[1:05:25] what it is that I'm saying and how then
[1:05:28] will you know all Parables you see
[1:05:31] unless you are you unless you come under
[1:05:34] the spirit of Revelation it's going to
[1:05:37] be very difficult to really understand
[1:05:40] the the the the meaning behind all of
[1:05:43] The Parables that are written in the
[1:05:45] scriptures but one thing that you've
[1:05:47] been given in this hour is the spirit of
[1:05:50] Revelation by the Holy Ghost to
[1:05:52] recognize what the word means
[1:05:57] there's there's a difference between
[1:05:59] between written word and spoken
[1:06:03] word spoken word when it's
[1:06:08] received by
[1:06:10] Revelation you receive the meaning of
[1:06:13] what is being
[1:06:15] spoken and it's the mind of God behind
[1:06:18] that
[1:06:19] word so the swer Seth the word notice
[1:06:24] what he's sowing
[1:06:26] and these are they by the wayside where
[1:06:29] the word is sown but when they have
[1:06:33] heard Satan cometh immediately and
[1:06:36] taketh away the word that was swn in
[1:06:38] their hearts and these are they likewise
[1:06:41] which are sown on Stony ground who when
[1:06:45] they have heard the word immediately
[1:06:47] receive it with gladness and have no
[1:06:50] root in
[1:06:51] them no now we're going to talk about
[1:06:53] what that root is
[1:06:56] no root in themselves and so endureth
[1:07:00] but for a time a lot of people hear the
[1:07:02] word oh wow man that sounds interesting
[1:07:06] boy I wonder what that you know that's
[1:07:09] that's really cool like I I need to do
[1:07:11] certain things do I need to load up on
[1:07:13] food and and uh should I load up on some
[1:07:16] supplies because tribulation is coming
[1:07:18] and uh you know should I do this and
[1:07:20] should I do that you see they don't have
[1:07:23] a revelation on the word of God
[1:07:27] and have no root in themselves and so
[1:07:30] endure but for a Time afterwards when
[1:07:33] Affliction or persecution arises from
[1:07:36] the for the word's sake immediately they
[1:07:38] are
[1:07:39] offended you know all of a sudden you
[1:07:41] tell your friends and you oh I heard
[1:07:43] that God sent a a a a prophet in the
[1:07:45] 20th century you know you need to read
[1:07:48] this look at this you know it's it God
[1:07:50] sent a prophet you know to to fulfill
[1:07:53] the word of God these are scriptures
[1:07:54] that pertain to this day and this hour
[1:07:57] and you know he was he was the messenger
[1:07:59] and one of the Angels the seven angels
[1:08:01] that was sent through the seven Church
[1:08:03] ages and all of a sudden your friends
[1:08:05] and family are looking at you and
[1:08:08] wondering what are you
[1:08:10] doing I did a search online the guy's he
[1:08:14] he's they call him he's a cult they say
[1:08:17] it's a cult because the first search
[1:08:20] that they did they'll go in there and
[1:08:23] they'll put William brandom is it a
[1:08:25] scand
[1:08:27] and right
[1:08:28] away because a lot of people you know
[1:08:30] they're getting scammed these days on
[1:08:32] all kinds of stuff they get phone calls
[1:08:34] they get textes they get emails and the
[1:08:36] first thing they'll do they'll go to
[1:08:37] Google and they'll put in the name and
[1:08:38] scam Bingle there it comes up oh yeah
[1:08:41] it's a scam it's a
[1:08:43] fraud right
[1:08:45] away you see but not the Sons and
[1:08:48] Daughters of God there's something in
[1:08:50] you that's been placed there from before
[1:08:54] the foundations of the world let's move
[1:08:55] on here and these are they which are
[1:08:58] sown among Thorns such as hear the word
[1:09:01] and the cares of this world and the
[1:09:03] deceitfulness of riches and the lust of
[1:09:07] other things entering in choke the
[1:09:12] word oh what a
[1:09:15] time you know this is
[1:09:17] happening this is a
[1:09:20] reality that if that word isn't solidly
[1:09:23] anchored and you are not constantly
[1:09:26] feeding on the word of God you're
[1:09:28] constantly reading the word of God
[1:09:30] you're you're coming into the house of
[1:09:32] the Lord you're supporting the ministry
[1:09:35] you're in your position listen you are a
[1:09:37] human being with an attribute of God
[1:09:40] inside of you but that attribute is like
[1:09:44] the camels when when uh when you know
[1:09:47] they those camels needed to be fed so
[1:09:49] that eleazer could get his bride Rebecca
[1:09:52] to
[1:09:53] Isaac Hallelujah you need to be feeding
[1:09:56] on the word of God you need to be coming
[1:09:58] into the house of the Lord you need you
[1:10:01] need spoken word you need you need the
[1:10:03] word to be spoken God chose the
[1:10:05] foolishness of
[1:10:07] preaching do you know that preaching
[1:10:09] it's not just Faith to understand the
[1:10:12] word that that you're given you're given
[1:10:15] the ability to overcome you're given
[1:10:18] Faith cometh by hearing and that word
[1:10:21] that's coming in you not only is it is
[1:10:23] it saving you it's healing you
[1:10:25] it's restoring you it's delivering you
[1:10:28] it's breaking the chains that Satan puts
[1:10:31] on your life you need the Living
[1:10:34] manifested Word of God in this day and
[1:10:36] in this hour
[1:10:40] Hallelujah and these are they which are
[1:10:42] sown on good ground such as hear the
[1:10:46] word receive it and bring forth fruit
[1:10:50] some 30 some 60 some
[1:10:53] 100 some gets so excited they'll go out
[1:10:56] and my God they'll add 30 to the church
[1:10:59] some will add 60 to the church some will
[1:11:01] add a 100 to the church because of their
[1:11:04] testimony it's it's because it's a
[1:11:06] reality in their lives and because
[1:11:08] there's life in the word that they've
[1:11:12] received life is the only thing that can
[1:11:15] bring forth more
[1:11:17] life that's why if the word is mixed
[1:11:21] with anything but the pure word it
[1:11:24] cannot bring forth life that's why the
[1:11:28] seven Church ages all the messengers why
[1:11:31] do you think through the Reformation why
[1:11:33] do you think
[1:11:34] Satan who is the devil that comes into
[1:11:37] the midst to seow the terrs we're going
[1:11:38] to read on here why do you think that
[1:11:41] that every Church age fell into apostasy
[1:11:44] fell into deception went off the word
[1:11:47] because they took man's
[1:11:49] interpretation on the word of God
[1:11:51] instead of keeping the pure
[1:11:54] unadulterated word of God to allow
[1:11:56] himself to be his own interpreter to the
[1:11:59] point that by the time they reach the
[1:12:01] Leo Dean Church age Jesus Christ was
[1:12:03] outside knocking on the door saying if
[1:12:07] anybody can hear me in all those
[1:12:11] denominational churches I'm knocking but
[1:12:14] you're going to need to come out you're
[1:12:16] going to need to come out of that
[1:12:18] situation you're going need to come out
[1:12:20] of those bondages out of those
[1:12:22] denominational uh theologian teachings
[1:12:26] of the scripture putting their own
[1:12:28] interpretation on the word
[1:12:30] trinitarian uh all kinds of of of
[1:12:33] scripture that's not
[1:12:36] scripture because they have no
[1:12:38] Revelation on the word of
[1:12:41] God
[1:12:45] hallelujah next scripture in Matthew 13
[1:12:47] now listen he says here so the Servants
[1:12:50] of the householder came and said unto
[1:12:52] him sir did not thou so good seed in thy
[1:12:57] field from whence then hath it
[1:13:02] tears listen you ever go into a field
[1:13:07] that hasn't been properly taken care of
[1:13:10] it's so full of weeds that you can't
[1:13:14] even see the real plants
[1:13:18] anymore and what do you think Satan's
[1:13:22] tactics
[1:13:23] are especially in this this age that
[1:13:25] we're living in right now where where
[1:13:27] where this is information
[1:13:30] overload this is where there's so many
[1:13:32] interpretations on God and the what God
[1:13:35] is and God is you know it's the universe
[1:13:38] God is uh uh you know uh in in in Idols
[1:13:42] God is in in listen people will worship
[1:13:44] something because it's in them to
[1:13:47] worship I don't care even an atheist is
[1:13:51] religious because they're worshiping the
[1:13:53] fact that there is no such thing is
[1:13:56] God and they've got other people that
[1:13:58] believe the same thing and they'll get
[1:13:59] together online and they'll they'll
[1:14:01] they'll they'll have their
[1:14:04] church and they're say oh no we're not
[1:14:06] religious oh yes you are because you
[1:14:08] believe in something to the point where
[1:14:10] you've United with others that believe
[1:14:13] the same thing it's just that what you
[1:14:15] believe is absolutely going to produce
[1:14:18] death because the only thing that
[1:14:21] produces life is word of God amen the
[1:14:27] unadulterated word eternal life is only
[1:14:30] found in God's word not man's
[1:14:34] interpretation on the word man begins
[1:14:37] something there'll be an end to it but
[1:14:40] if God starts it there's no end to it
[1:14:44] hallelujah praise God and so why is
[1:14:47] there so many tears we're living in a
[1:14:49] world and you you know listen you're a
[1:14:52] minority you're a minority you are the
[1:14:54] wheat
[1:14:55] you're the ones that have taken God's
[1:14:57] word that that that receive God's word
[1:14:59] and and doesn't believe anything else
[1:15:02] but the word of God because you know
[1:15:04] that's the only safe place in this day
[1:15:06] and in this
[1:15:07] hour he says an enemy had done this the
[1:15:10] servant said unto him wil thou then that
[1:15:12] we go and gather them up but he said
[1:15:16] no lest while you gather up the tears
[1:15:19] you root up also the
[1:15:20] wheat with them and that's why we're not
[1:15:25] you know we're we're we're not people
[1:15:27] that are you know that that that we we
[1:15:29] force ourselves under people and start
[1:15:32] you know ripping sin out of people's
[1:15:34] lives and tell them oh you're you're
[1:15:35] lost you're this you're that let the
[1:15:38] word do that let them search the
[1:15:41] scriptures I remember it wasn't when
[1:15:43] when I came you know became a part of
[1:15:45] this ministry my brothers and sisters
[1:15:47] were showing me so much love and so much
[1:15:51] grace that that and and it what was it
[1:15:54] it was God showing me how much he loved
[1:15:57] me how much he believed in in what he
[1:16:02] had placed in me that it would not
[1:16:04] return
[1:16:05] void and he nourished that word that was
[1:16:08] in me he nourished and fed the the the
[1:16:11] the desire of my heart to to to worship
[1:16:14] and to know God in because there was
[1:16:17] something already there from before the
[1:16:19] foundations of the world am it wasn't it
[1:16:22] wasn't forced and oh you got to believe
[1:16:25] this and you got to believe that and you
[1:16:27] need to come to my church you're lost
[1:16:29] listen the word will gently tell them
[1:16:33] that what they
[1:16:34] believe is
[1:16:37] false or they will reject the word and
[1:16:40] just go on as they
[1:16:41] are it's as simple as
[1:16:44] that and so that's why we're not he says
[1:16:47] let them grow together until the
[1:16:49] Harvest until this
[1:16:52] day because it's the God is going to do
[1:16:55] something in the end time he says and in
[1:16:58] the time of the Harvest I will say to
[1:16:59] the Reapers Gather ye together first the
[1:17:02] tears and bind them in bundles to burn
[1:17:06] them all right but gather the wheat into
[1:17:09] the barn listen this great economical
[1:17:13] move that's going on all over the world
[1:17:16] on uniting the churches and everything
[1:17:18] else if it's not based and
[1:17:20] foundationally structured upon the pure
[1:17:23] unadulterated word of God it will
[1:17:27] fall it will go
[1:17:30] into a great
[1:17:34] burning okay now what that is is is is
[1:17:37] you know they're going to go into the
[1:17:40] Lake of Fire and a lot of people think
[1:17:42] oh they're going to go into a hell and
[1:17:43] it's a burning hell and it's a fire no
[1:17:45] the Lake of Fire is
[1:17:47] God that's what the Lake of Fire is he's
[1:17:51] just going to consume back those that
[1:17:54] were not
[1:17:56] Sons and Daughters of God from before
[1:17:59] the foundations of the world there are
[1:18:02] children of God on the earth and there
[1:18:04] are children of the devil it's in the
[1:18:07] scriptures I'm only telling you what's
[1:18:09] in the
[1:18:10] scriptures and so you need to recognize
[1:18:13] this a lot of people say oh no no no no
[1:18:15] that's that's you're preaching hell and
[1:18:18] you know Hellfire
[1:18:19] religion I'm preaching the word of
[1:18:23] God you got a
[1:18:25] choice which which which will you choose
[1:18:28] today if you've got a uh you know if
[1:18:30] you've got the ability to choose are you
[1:18:32] going to choose to be one of those that
[1:18:34] are deceived and and caught under the
[1:18:37] traditions of man or are you interested
[1:18:39] in knowing what the truth is for this
[1:18:41] day and in this hour Hallelujah let's go
[1:18:44] to the next scripture here let's move on
[1:18:47] he answered and said unto them he that
[1:18:49] sth the good seed is the son of man God
[1:18:53] has a plan of redemption Saints this is
[1:18:56] not something that just started today
[1:18:59] this is something that he started before
[1:19:01] the foundations of the world in his mind
[1:19:04] he's just expressing it in the form of a
[1:19:06] parable he's just he's just revealing
[1:19:09] what it is that he's doing he says here
[1:19:11] the field is the
[1:19:13] world and he says the good seed are the
[1:19:17] children of the Kingdom but the tears
[1:19:19] are what the children of the wicked who
[1:19:23] was the Wicked one from the very
[1:19:25] beginning who was the liar at the very
[1:19:27] beginning who was that serpent that
[1:19:30] beguiled Eve at the very
[1:19:32] beginning you're Jesus himself stood
[1:19:35] there before the Pharisees and all the
[1:19:37] priests of that day and they were they
[1:19:39] were saying to him we are the children
[1:19:41] of Abraham we are the sons and daughters
[1:19:44] of Abraham we are the Seed of Abraham
[1:19:46] the Lord Jesus God made flesh they
[1:19:50] didn't realize who was standing there
[1:19:52] speaking to them look look what he said
[1:19:55] he says you're not the children of
[1:19:57] Abraham if you were the children of
[1:19:58] Abraham you'd to recognize me because he

[1:20:06] revelation of who I was you've got all
[1:20:09] law you've been you you you've been
[1:20:12] blinded to the word of
[1:20:14] God and he says you're of your father

[1:20:21] Wicked one who was a liar from the
[1:20:23] beginning who was the one that was the
[1:20:25] liar from the beginning and told Eve no

[1:20:29] die if you partake of
[1:20:32] this you see this is the
[1:20:36] deception amen we know who the enemy is

[1:20:42] devil and the Harvest is the end of the
[1:20:48] world and we are in the end
[1:20:51] times it's not that the world is going
[1:20:53] to blow up

[1:20:57] up completely and there's going to be
[1:20:59] nobody and everybody's going to be
[1:21:00] annihilated no there's a lot more to the
[1:21:03] Plan of Redemption but we need to know
[1:21:05] and recognize where we are at now and
[1:21:08] what it is that God requires of us let's
[1:21:11] move on
[1:21:12] here

[1:21:48] vindicate the true and living God of
[1:21:51] this hour look what he says the the
[1:21:54] message that's coming forth in this time
[1:21:59] boy I'll tell you brother brandham was
[1:22:00] saying that back in
[1:22:03] 1965 look what's coming forth now Sons
[1:22:06] and Daughters of God that are coming
[1:22:08] into a a a perfect faith and Revelation
[1:22:12] that greater is he that is in you than
[1:22:14] he that is in the world she's coming
[1:22:17] into that perfect Faith amen you are
[1:22:19] done there before the foundations of The
[1:22:22] World God knew exactly what he was doing
[1:22:26] when he came to
[1:22:29] [Music]
[1:22:31] you listen here I'm going to read
[1:22:35] on in a message a greater than Solomon
[1:22:38] is here brother Braham says all the
[1:22:40] father hath given me will
[1:22:42] come and I'm happy for that so we don't
[1:22:45] know who is who and who is not it's not
[1:22:50] up to us to say oh there's a Son of God
[1:22:52] oh there's a serpent seed oh there's a
[1:22:54] unbeliever oh there's a makeb Believer
[1:22:57] no every church has three kinds of
[1:23:00] Believers the True Believer the make
[1:23:03] believer and the
[1:23:05] unbeliever and they'll all receive the
[1:23:07] rain falls on the just and the unjust
[1:23:10] and sometimes you come into the house of
[1:23:12] the Lord and the spirit of God moves and
[1:23:14] starts speaking and and hallelujah
[1:23:16] praise God just like some of those that
[1:23:17] fell on the on the Stony ground they
[1:23:20] they get excited by the word of God but
[1:23:22] then when they leave on Sunday afternoon
[1:23:24] Monday morning they're cursing cheating
[1:23:27] stealing lying committing all kinds of
[1:23:31] unbelief drinking smoking all the
[1:23:36] attributes of sin because listen those
[1:23:38] things are not sin those are the
[1:23:40] attributes of sin if you fed on the word
[1:23:43] and the word has has anchored inside of
[1:23:46] you and it's and and and it's and it's a
[1:23:48] reality your your life cannot remain the
[1:23:51] same because it's the living word that
[1:23:54] has possessed you and the Living Word
[1:23:56] brings forth life it brings forth
[1:23:59] Deliverance your life starts to manifest
[1:24:01] Deliverance it doesn't manifest
[1:24:04] unbelief if it's if if you go out Monday
[1:24:07] morning and you start manifesting
[1:24:09] unbelief you you no word anchored inside
[1:24:12] of you it wasn't it was just you just
[1:24:16] got caught into the emotion it's like a
[1:24:18] lot of time people go into church and
[1:24:20] you know the way the preacher preaches
[1:24:21] the word of God and delivers the word of
[1:24:23] God he can get the people so
[1:24:26] excited you know because of the emotion
[1:24:28] that he puts behind the word of God to
[1:24:31] the point where you know people will
[1:24:33] will get caught up into the
[1:24:35] emotion and then you'll talk to them
[1:24:37] after the service and you say praise God
[1:24:39] brother did you enjoy that oh glory to
[1:24:42] God do you remember what the scripture
[1:24:44] was do you remember the thought behind
[1:24:46] it they'll look at you kind of
[1:24:50] funny you see they got caught into the
[1:24:52] moment of the emotion
[1:24:55] but they didn't catch the word the life
[1:24:59] the aspect of the word that that that
[1:25:01] transforms them that Chang them that's
[1:25:03] why one word spoken to you this morning
[1:25:07] that that that that meets and and
[1:25:09] attacks a certain situation in your life
[1:25:11] and you say that's me I receive it
[1:25:14] that's me Lord oh God that's me I need
[1:25:17] it right now Lord and and it's because
[1:25:19] you've come into a realization you
[1:25:21] you've died out to yourself you've died
[1:25:23] out to the pride you you died out to all
[1:25:25] the things all the lies of the enemy
[1:25:27] because he's holding you in that in that
[1:25:31] condition let the pure word of God come
[1:25:34] into your life when it speaks to that
[1:25:37] need you will immediately
[1:25:40] manifest
[1:25:43] Deliverance you can never be the same
[1:25:45] that's why listen the worlds were framed
[1:25:49] by the word of God you know that without
[1:25:53] the word of God there there's
[1:25:55] nothing you know that it's it's because
[1:25:57] of God's word that anything
[1:26:00] exists and it's because of God's word
[1:26:02] that even when he went to the children
[1:26:04] of Israel and he gave them the the the
[1:26:06] the Ten Commandments it's because he had
[1:26:08] to put his word into their lives so that
[1:26:11] they could recognize what it was that
[1:26:13] they were because they were living like
[1:26:15] Savages they were killing one another
[1:26:17] they were beating one another they had
[1:26:19] no understanding of of God but when God
[1:26:23] came he gave them his word and he sent
[1:26:26] them his word and his word healed them
[1:26:30] Hallelujah his word is a lamp unto my
[1:26:33] feet glory to God his word is the
[1:26:36] reality that when you receive it and it
[1:26:38] comes into your life you are
[1:26:41] delivered you can't remain the same way
[1:26:44] you face the enemy because you know that
[1:26:47] you know oh glory to God hallelujah I'm
[1:26:51] so happy so we don't know who is who and
[1:26:54] who's not we just scatter forth the seed
[1:26:57] that's all we do some Falls by the
[1:27:00] wayside some Falls this way and that way
[1:27:02] but some does fall on good ground that's
[1:27:06] right Hallelujah ground that's been
[1:27:09] prepared by God to receive his
[1:27:14] seed that's why listen we read
[1:27:18] it the seed is the
[1:27:21] word in the beginning was the word in
[1:27:24] the word was with God and the Word was
[1:27:26] God am without the word there's
[1:27:30] nothing nothing can nothing can can can
[1:27:33] be held together the universe and all of
[1:27:35] the laws that God has placed that's why
[1:27:38] people that deny God deny the
[1:27:41] intelligence of God's
[1:27:43] word even their own ability to speak is
[1:27:46] because God gave them the ability to
[1:27:48] communicate do you know that it's only
[1:27:49] human beings that can speak with words
[1:27:51] to one another
[1:27:55] you don't hear chimpanzees
[1:27:59] speaking we got logic in the words that
[1:28:02] we speak and God has placed his thought
[1:28:05] into his word and that's why when it's
[1:28:08] received which is called by
[1:28:10] Revelation not by teaching of man listen
[1:28:14] when when when he asked the people when
[1:28:16] he come down he says to his disciples
[1:28:17] who do the people say that I
[1:28:19] am he knew he was God he knew the word
[1:28:23] that he was fulfilling but he wanted to
[1:28:25] know what what are the people saying
[1:28:27] about me and they turn and say oh some
[1:28:29] are saying you're Jeremiah some are
[1:28:30] saying you're Elijah this saying that
[1:28:33] you're you're a risen up Prophet this
[1:28:34] and that and he looked to Peter he says
[1:28:36] but who do you say that I
[1:28:38] am you see something was revealed
[1:28:40] directly into Peter's
[1:28:43] heart and you've got to have the same
[1:28:46] kind of experience if you want
[1:28:47] Deliverance in in this word you got to
[1:28:51] have that same experience come into you
[1:28:53] and and all of a sudden Peter
[1:28:55] immediately Thou Art the Christ you are
[1:28:58] the God you are God you are the word
[1:29:00] you're the Messiah that that they've
[1:29:02] been talking about that was to come and
[1:29:05] Jesus said Flesh and Blood didn't give
[1:29:07] you this and that's why it's not going
[1:29:09] to be you just reading the word of God
[1:29:12] oh I'll just stay home and read the word
[1:29:14] of God I'll just listen to the
[1:29:17] tapes meanwhile the logos is in the
[1:29:20] house of the Lord this
[1:29:22] morning he wants to speak to you he
[1:29:25] wants to connect to the word that he's
[1:29:27] placed inside of you so that you can
[1:29:29] manifest him in this day and in this
[1:29:32] hour because when you manifest him you
[1:29:36] manifest the Rapture brother Bram said
[1:29:39] the Rapture is a revelation so if you
[1:29:42] don't have a revelation on the Rapture
[1:29:44] you're going to believe all kinds of
[1:29:46] teachings you're going to go to YouTube
[1:29:48] and you're going to listen to this one
[1:29:49] well that one sounds good oh this one
[1:29:52] sounds even oh is it premim you know
[1:29:54] what the tribulation could be pre or it
[1:29:57] could be
[1:29:58] after you see it's all a guessing game
[1:30:02] but let you get one time into the house
[1:30:04] of the Lord and the logos starts to seek
[1:30:08] out that prepared ground where seed was
[1:30:11] planted in in prepared ground listen to
[1:30:13] brother BR he says any seed has to have
[1:30:16] its ground of course therefore all he
[1:30:20] forne see he already knew what was going
[1:30:23] to happen amen by the forn knowledge of
[1:30:26] God he could predestinate you unto the
[1:30:29] adoption of the Sons and Daughters of
[1:30:32] God because he had a plan he knew what
[1:30:35] he was going to do this is from the
[1:30:36] message works his faith expressed he
[1:30:38] says now notice Jesus said again about
[1:30:41] the seed some fell on Rock others in
[1:30:44] mixed ground see over where uh there's
[1:30:48] Thorns thistles and everything else it
[1:30:50] couldn't grow and others on good ground
[1:30:54] good ground good soil which had been
[1:30:57] prepared already
[1:31:01] prepared so don't you think that it was
[1:31:03] an accident when somebody walked up to
[1:31:06] you and said hey have you heard that
[1:31:09] there's a message in the land that's
[1:31:11] calling the church out of the
[1:31:14] churches what oh yeah you see when Jesus
[1:31:18] was here on Earth he was calling his
[1:31:20] disciples out of a out of a religious
[1:31:23] group group of of of a couple of million
[1:31:26] people in that day and there was only a
[1:31:28] dozen of them that actually
[1:31:30] recognized really yes it's always been a
[1:31:34] minority let me ask you a simple
[1:31:37] question my friend have you been
[1:31:38] baptized well of course I got baptized
[1:31:41] as a baby yeah but wait a minute can I
[1:31:43] show you in the scripture where there
[1:31:45] was 8,000 baptisms just after the day of
[1:31:49] Pentecost when Peter who had the the the
[1:31:52] the Holy Ghost had the reveal word for
[1:31:54] his day he had the instruction for the
[1:31:56] people how they would receive the Holy
[1:31:58] Ghost can I show you in the scripture
[1:32:01] what it says in Acts 238 well sure go
[1:32:03] ahead and you show it to them and I
[1:32:06] remember when I read that and I saw that
[1:32:09] and I seen it it was like an explosion
[1:32:12] took place within my heart don't ask me
[1:32:15] to explain it but all of a sudden I saw
[1:32:18] it as clear as day I realized I said oh
[1:32:21] my God that's when I went to Pastor
[1:32:23] Simon I said Pastor Simon I need the
[1:32:25] Holy Ghost I need to be baptized I
[1:32:28] realized that the Scripture it come to
[1:32:30] life to me it was a reality what was
[1:32:33] that that wasn't because of my ability
[1:32:35] to read anybody can read acts
[1:32:38] 238 but let the anointed logos of God's
[1:32:42] word the spirit that's behind that word
[1:32:45] speak to you just one time and deal with
[1:32:49] you in whatever it is that you're
[1:32:50] overcoming right now for me at that time
[1:32:52] it was a drug addiction
[1:32:54] and when I went into that water and I
[1:32:56] came out of that water don't ask me how
[1:32:58] he delivered me but all I can tell you
[1:33:01] is that that was the last moment that
[1:33:04] that demon power of drug addiction had
[1:33:06] any hold over my life why because he did
[1:33:10] it he
[1:33:12] delivered I didn't do anything I had
[1:33:15] believed all kinds of different
[1:33:18] teachings and all kind I was going to
[1:33:20] all kinds of different seminars on on
[1:33:23] how to Chang my life because I was not
[1:33:26] satisfied with the life that I had and
[1:33:28] that's why the drugs would satisfy me
[1:33:30] and give me a break for a while so that
[1:33:32] it would Release Me from the from the
[1:33:34] from the from the heartache and the
[1:33:36] burden of trying to figure this life out
[1:33:39] but then one
[1:33:41] Revelation one Revelation from God
[1:33:43] started the whole process and that's all
[1:33:46] it takes in your life and that same
[1:33:48] process is still happening
[1:33:51] today not just in my life should be
[1:33:54] happening in your life you should be
[1:33:56] having those same experiences today he's
[1:33:59] the same yesterday today and forever you
[1:34:02] got something you need deliverance from
[1:34:04] he can deliver you he can set you free
[1:34:08] but you need to come God's provided way
[1:34:10] you need to identify that you are
[1:34:12] prepared ground Hallelujah that you can
[1:34:15] receive that word and you can bring
[1:34:17] forth maybe 30 60 or 100 Hallelujah
[1:34:20] bringing forth fruit many of you can
[1:34:24] fellowship with me on this thought
[1:34:26] listen you knew you were different he
[1:34:29] says uh when you was a little boy or a
[1:34:32] little girl you would walk around and
[1:34:34] there would there would be certain
[1:34:35] things that that would just when where
[1:34:38] it wouldn't bother other people but it
[1:34:40] would bother you yes sir you remember
[1:34:42] that yes can you identify when I read
[1:34:44] that I identifi with that I I couldn't
[1:34:47] understand I'd be I'd be with with
[1:34:49] certain friends and I and I hung out
[1:34:51] with a Rowdy gang I'm telling you these
[1:34:53] guys they were just they would be
[1:34:55] training all day long so that they could
[1:34:57] go out Friday night and pick a
[1:35:01] fight all week they were pumping iron
[1:35:04] and doing their you know this and that
[1:35:06] so that they could go to the bars and
[1:35:08] they could stand there and I remember I
[1:35:11] used to hang around with this group it
[1:35:13] was called La Familia which is the
[1:35:15] family you know like like a like a like
[1:35:18] a small little mob group and and we
[1:35:21] would go from place to place we'd be in
[1:35:23] Hamilton at the bars over there and this
[1:35:25] and that and you know that there was
[1:35:27] there was a lot of
[1:35:29] brawls and
[1:35:31] fights and one time actually a good
[1:35:34] friend of mine got into a fight and over
[1:35:38] absolutely nothing just because they
[1:35:41] nudged like this and the guy turned
[1:35:43] around what's your problem no what's
[1:35:44] your problem on the ground kicked my
[1:35:47] buddy in the head so many times dead
[1:35:50] right there on the
[1:35:52] spot I wasn't there
[1:35:54] there there was other fights where they
[1:35:56] tore up the whole place I wasn't there I
[1:35:59] kept saying to my friends said how in
[1:36:00] the world I just left and this all
[1:36:04] happened
[1:36:06] after you see God was in your life and
[1:36:10] he's in your life and he's keeping you
[1:36:11] even right
[1:36:13] now because you got a
[1:36:15] purpose you got a
[1:36:18] purpose God has a reason why he's
[1:36:20] planted that seed into your life he's
[1:36:23] gathered in that seed right now he wants
[1:36:25] to he wants to shift through all the
[1:36:27] tears and all the the the the the
[1:36:30] different uh uh schools of teaching out
[1:36:33] there because he's got Sons and
[1:36:34] Daughters of God that are still trapped
[1:36:37] but he's Gathering them in it's time to
[1:36:39] gather it's time to gather he's gathered
[1:36:42] Israel already Israel's already been
[1:36:45] gathered they're in their Homeland
[1:36:46] praise God hallelujah he says here he
[1:36:49] says you would just walk around and
[1:36:51] there would be certain things that would
[1:36:53] just wear wouldn't bother the other kids
[1:36:55] it seemed like there was something in
[1:36:57] you that cried out there was God
[1:36:59] somewhere yet you were a sinner you
[1:37:02] remember that certainly now what was it
[1:37:05] that was the little form of life in you
[1:37:08] back then this is not something that God
[1:37:11] is just doing now if you're a son or
[1:37:14] daughter of God you were out there on on
[1:37:16] YouTube and you're listening in onto
[1:37:18] this word and you're you're you're just
[1:37:20] wondering what's striking your heart
[1:37:21] it's because God already knew you God
[1:37:24] already started on you from before the
[1:37:26] foundations of the world you just got to
[1:37:28] come into your time you just got to come
[1:37:30] into your season where the word of God
[1:37:33] the life of the lust takes a hold of you
[1:37:36] and it starts to speak back the word of
[1:37:38] God back to God Amen and he says
[1:37:40] certainly he says after a while you
[1:37:42] heard the gospel maybe you went to
[1:37:44] church you picked out this and that and
[1:37:47] went from denomination to denomination
[1:37:49] but one day you being a part of God you
[1:37:52] had to be a part of the word and when
[1:37:55] you heard the word you know where you
[1:37:57] come from you know what was the truth
[1:38:00] you were always the seed was in you
[1:38:04] always glory to God Amen you come from
[1:38:08] God you go back to God you can't go to
[1:38:12] God unless you came from God hallelujah
[1:38:15] you were always the seed you were always
[1:38:18] the seed seen the word and and that was
[1:38:21] in you that was before the foundations
[1:38:24] of the world saw the word and you came
[1:38:27] to the
[1:38:30] word that's why Faith cometh by hearing
[1:38:34] the
[1:38:34] word hallelujah glory to God Christ The
[1:38:39] Mystery of God revealed he says now you
[1:38:41] you see the seals when he was in his
[1:38:44] meditor work back there redeeming but
[1:38:47] someday he comes forth to get this book
[1:38:50] that he's redeemed and all that's in
[1:38:53] this book would be in him for that's the
[1:38:57] believer the words in the book and the
[1:39:00] word is him and if you are in his word
[1:39:06] then you are a manifestation of him in
[1:39:10] the day that you receive the word amen
[1:39:13] hallelujah listen if you can't see Jesus
[1:39:16] Christ from Genesis to Revelation you've
[1:39:19] missed something right everything that
[1:39:21] we've been speaking here on and all the
[1:39:24] scripture that we've read it's all about
[1:39:26] his Plan of Redemption everything
[1:39:29] surrounding his great plan and if you
[1:39:31] can't see Jesus Christ is
[1:39:35] God from Elohim the self-existent one in
[1:39:38] the very beginning to the god that's in
[1:39:41] Revelations 22 where it says and the
[1:39:44] spirit and the bride say
[1:39:47] come it doesn't say and God the Father
[1:39:50] and Jesus and the Holy Spirit say they
[1:39:53] come it says the spirit which is what
[1:39:56] the Holy Spirit which is what Jesus
[1:39:59] Christ which is what the word and if you
[1:40:01] are in the word and the word is in you
[1:40:04] then you're going to be one of those
[1:40:05] that's going to say on that day that I
[1:40:07] know that I am in the father and the
[1:40:09] father is in me and I in you you'll be
[1:40:12] able to recognize that you are the word
[1:40:15] manifest Hallelujah glory to God it's
[1:40:19] always been his Plan of Redemption it's
[1:40:22] always been his word it was his word in
[1:40:24] Abraham it was his word in Abel in in in
[1:40:27] Adam it was his word in in Seth all the
[1:40:30] way down it was his word in Noah it was
[1:40:32] his word in in Abraham it was his word
[1:40:34] in uh Isaac and Joseph and and all the
[1:40:38] Sons and Daughters of God all the way
[1:40:40] down through the Old Testament it was
[1:40:43] always his word coming into
[1:40:46] manifestation in a particular time and
[1:40:49] season and when you can recognize that
[1:40:52] you believe the word and you're seeing
[1:40:55] it in your day it's because you are the
[1:40:58] word that is to manifest the Rapture
[1:41:01] because the message of this hour is the
[1:41:04] rapture to take the church out before
[1:41:07] the Great
[1:41:08] Tribulation when the church goes out
[1:41:11] Moses and Elijah are going to come on
[1:41:13] the scene and they're going to go
[1:41:15] directly to Israel and they're going to
[1:41:16] start to preach Jesus Christ the same
[1:41:19] yesterday today and forever amen they're
[1:41:22] not going to preach a different message
[1:41:24] they're going to preach this word and
[1:41:26] the same deliverer that delivered you
[1:41:28] and me is going to deliver the
[1:41:30] 144,000 as a as a as a nation not
[1:41:34] individually as a nation Israel will be
[1:41:37] converted in one day they're going to
[1:41:40] recognize the Messiah is going to show
[1:41:42] up and they're going to say where did
[1:41:43] you get those nail prints he's going to
[1:41:45] say in the house of my friends they're
[1:41:47] going to realize what you mean it was us
[1:41:51] yes and that is going to fulf fulfill
[1:41:54] the scriptures and it's going to fulfill
[1:41:56] everything about Israel and then there's
[1:41:59] more to come after that after
[1:42:03] the 144,000 go up into the into their
[1:42:07] Resurrection then comes the Great
[1:42:11] Tribulation where there's going to be
[1:42:13] some serious Wars on the
[1:42:15] earth there's still going to be Nations
[1:42:18] on the earth when we go here there's
[1:42:21] going to be hardly anybody that's going
[1:42:22] to really notice
[1:42:23] only those that are your friends and you
[1:42:25] know those that are your family are they
[1:42:26] going to be calling they're going to be
[1:42:27] wondering wait a minute
[1:42:29] here how come I haven't heard from them
[1:42:31] this week and then they're watching the
[1:42:34] radio they're listening to the to to the
[1:42:36] radio they're watching the TV and
[1:42:38] there's all kinds of missing people
[1:42:41] reports you've seen it in the
[1:42:44] movies it's going to happen it's a
[1:42:47] reality Saints it's something that's
[1:42:50] going to happen amen praise God
[1:42:54] glory to God
[1:42:56] listen I'm going to wind it down here
[1:43:00] Christ The Mystery of God
[1:43:02] revealed what was it that God was trying
[1:43:04] to do here what is it that he was doing
[1:43:07] when he planted that word in you is
[1:43:10] because he wanted to express himself and
[1:43:13] Christ The Mystery of God revealed first
[1:43:15] to express himself completely God in
[1:43:18] Christ so he came as God in flesh
[1:43:22] Emmanuel will God With Us second to have
[1:43:26] preeminence by this in his church which
[1:43:30] is for him to come and take control
[1:43:33] within the the the boundaries of the
[1:43:35] church and this is what we are under
[1:43:37] right now amen glory to God and then
[1:43:40] which is also the lifegiver to the word
[1:43:43] the seed to vindicate that seed in that
[1:43:47] season you see that's what he came to do
[1:43:50] he came to awaken the seed of
[1:43:53] himself in you you can't even believe
[1:43:57] this word unless he's in you to believe
[1:44:02] it that's why without the Bible says
[1:44:04] without faith it's impossible to please
[1:44:07] God what's he saying there unless you
[1:44:10] can repeat back to him his thoughts that
[1:44:13] he's given to you by Revelation you're
[1:44:16] just quoting
[1:44:18] scripture the listen the letter it can
[1:44:21] kill but when the Holy Spirit comes upon
[1:44:24] you to read the letter it brings it to
[1:44:26] life and that's what he's been trying to
[1:44:28] do his Spirit coming upon you upon that
[1:44:32] seed that like he said here so that he
[1:44:34] says in his church which is his body he
[1:44:38] says uh he which is the lifegiver to the
[1:44:40] word the seed to vindicate that seed for
[1:44:45] That season for which season this
[1:44:47] season this season there's seed in you
[1:44:51] that's got to overcome amen there's seed
[1:44:53] in you that's got to let drop away all
[1:44:55] the sin and unbelief in your life the
[1:44:58] only way it's going to happen is if that
[1:45:00] word that life of the word gets in you
[1:45:03] and it awakens you to recognize that
[1:45:05] this is the truth this is absolutely the
[1:45:08] truth I can't see it any other
[1:45:10] way glory to God
[1:45:14] Amen so here now he says first so he
[1:45:18] continues on here Christ The Mystery of
[1:45:20] God revealed he says Christ he says
[1:45:24] first to express himself completely God
[1:45:27] in Christ second to have preeminence by
[1:45:29] his church and his church which is his
[1:45:31] body the bride till he could have the
[1:45:34] preeminence to express himself through
[1:45:39] them he's expressing life through you
[1:45:43] that's why don't take it for granted
[1:45:45] what you've received Saints don't make
[1:45:48] it complacent in your
[1:45:51] life feed on on the word of God every
[1:45:54] day you you you you don't realize what
[1:45:57] that does for you you don't realize how
[1:46:00] powerful it is when you read the word

[1:46:05] when you come into the house of the Lord
[1:46:07] and receive the
[1:46:08] word you you you come with expectation
[1:46:12] and you come with faith in your heart it
[1:46:14] changes you it delivers you it sets you
[1:46:16] free sickness Falls away from you just
[1:46:19] automatically things because the word
[1:46:22] was sent to deliver his
[1:46:24] people and that's why you need the word
[1:46:27] for this day and for this hour you can't
[1:46:29] live on a on a word from that day gone
[1:46:31] by you can't be just quoting oh God sent
[1:46:34] a prophet God sent a prophet yeah but
[1:46:35] what did he send the prophet for to turn
[1:46:38] your heart back to the original word so
[1:46:41] that you could receive the word and
[1:46:44] awaken the seed of God the attribute of
[1:46:46] God the part of the word that you were
[1:46:49] ordained to be in in 2020 4 a lot of you
[1:46:54] have still not fully awakened to
[1:46:56] recognize your part in the word of God
[1:47:00] but God is is shaking God is Gathering
[1:47:03] God is sifting through God is saying
[1:47:06] wake
[1:47:08] up come out of your sleep and slender
[1:47:11] that's why Ephesians 4 and he gave some
[1:47:14] Apostles and some prophets and some
[1:47:16] evangelists and some pastors and
[1:47:19] teachers for what for the perfecting of
[1:47:21] the Saints we are now in a maturity
[1:47:25] state where we are being perfected for
[1:47:27] the Rapture amen praise God listen what
[1:47:30] it says for the perfecting for the work
[1:47:32] of the ministry for the edifying of the
[1:47:35] body of Christ listen God is going to
[1:47:37] he's going to sift out every demon I'm
[1:47:40] telling you right now I'm praying I'm
[1:47:42] believing for this church God didn't put
[1:47:44] me here to be the pastor of this church
[1:47:47] just to be in a position I don't need
[1:47:49] more positions I I couldn't even
[1:47:52] understand why he put me here with all
[1:47:53] the positions that I already had but I
[1:47:55] said Lord it doesn't matter whatever
[1:47:58] your will is whatever your plan is you
[1:48:01] if you start this work in my life you're
[1:48:03] going to finish it you're going to keep
[1:48:05] me and but I come to realize that this
[1:48:07] position holds holds a
[1:48:10] seriousness I I I got I I've I've never
[1:48:13] been so stirred like I have been and
[1:48:15] I've never fought battles like I've been
[1:48:16] fighting in the last six months I can
[1:48:18] tell you right now God gave me a little
[1:48:21] honeymoon the first six months
[1:48:24] I said Lord thank you very
[1:48:27] much I thought oh wow praise God you
[1:48:30] know feeling nice inspiration you know
[1:48:33] but all of a sudden the enemy starts
[1:48:35] attacking my God why because I started
[1:48:37] to get serious I started to realize wait
[1:48:39] a minute here wait a minute here this
[1:48:43] what's going on here this look look at
[1:48:46] Israel look look at the condition of the
[1:48:48] world look at look at the condition of
[1:48:50] the people look what's going on in the
[1:48:51] United States right now now in a week
[1:48:53] from now we don't know what's going to
[1:48:55] happen we've got a country that's fully
[1:48:58] divided split right in half completely
[1:49:01] like night and
[1:49:03] day how can a country listen unless two
[1:49:06] walk together and agree how can they
[1:49:08] walk
[1:49:10] together we're living in a time where
[1:49:13] there's a gathering going on but the
[1:49:15] rest of the world is gathering into
[1:49:18] Clans into tribes into into teachings of
[1:49:22] man men they're they're they're they're
[1:49:24] they're they're stealing the word of God
[1:49:25] out of the schools they're they're
[1:49:27] they're stealing our gender identity
[1:49:29] away that we are Sons and Daughters we
[1:49:32] are men and women male and female
[1:49:35] they're stealing all kind they're
[1:49:36] putting so much confusion into the
[1:49:38] people's minds so that they don't know
[1:49:41] who they actually are but you as a Son
[1:49:44] of God as a
[1:49:46] logos son the attribute of God when you
[1:49:49] come to that word you come to realize
[1:49:51] that wait a minute here I know who I am
[1:49:54] I realize what God is doing I I can't
[1:49:57] help but see it it's just clear as a
[1:49:58] bell this word is a lamp unto my feet
[1:50:01] this word is my shield and my buckler
[1:50:04] without it listen if I I can study all
[1:50:07] kinds of things but the minute that I
[1:50:08] start to look to
[1:50:11] psychology I'm going to need a
[1:50:14] psychiatrist who's also seeing a
[1:50:17] psychiatrist you know that that's a fact
[1:50:20] a lot of them a lot of psychiatrists
[1:50:21] have psychiatrists yes because they
[1:50:23] don't realize what they're dealing with
[1:50:25] you see they need the word they need to
[1:50:28] understand that the word has to have a
[1:50:31] meaning in their hearts today they're
[1:50:33] taking the word and they're they're
[1:50:34] they're making it of none effect to the
[1:50:36] people because they'll accept
[1:50:39] anything they're replacing the word
[1:50:42] they're coming up with their own words
[1:50:44] their own interpretations on words and
[1:50:47] it changes the meaning behind the words
[1:50:49] and it changes everything to the
[1:50:51] individual do you know that if you if
[1:50:54] you you know you know you've heard the
[1:50:56] the people say oh he talked me out of
[1:51:00] it why because there's power in
[1:51:04] words there's power when you can when
[1:51:06] you can talk somebody out of something
[1:51:09] somebody can talk them into
[1:51:11] something but not with the word of
[1:51:14] God because the word of God is
[1:51:17] life it's it's it's Eternal it discerns
[1:51:21] the thoughts and intent of the heart
[1:51:24] that's why you can't fool God God knows
[1:51:27] your heart God knows what you mean when
[1:51:30] you tell some listen when you tell lies
[1:51:32] that's coming back to you I can tell you
[1:51:35] right now it's going to come back to you
[1:51:36] and it's going to haunt you it's gon to
[1:51:38] it's going to come back because a lie
[1:51:40] when it goes out it's got to return to
[1:51:43] snap and and to hit you back and to to
[1:51:46] distort everything it's going to ruin
[1:51:49] your life it's going to ruin people are
[1:51:50] not going to trust you anymore a liar
[1:51:52] how can you trust a
[1:51:54] liar you can't trust anything that that
[1:51:56] comes out of his mouth anymore and that
[1:51:59] destroys your reputation it destroys
[1:52:02] your ability to have any kind of effect
[1:52:05] that's why you got to watch the words
[1:52:07] that you speak you got to be careful how
[1:52:09] you speak those words to people and how
[1:52:11] you interpret things to people how you
[1:52:13] share your testimony share it but share
[1:52:16] it with a reality don't be putting so
[1:52:19] much supern Supernatural this
[1:52:21] Supernatural that Supernatural this
[1:52:23] people are wondering this guy's
[1:52:25] cuckoo show me something
[1:52:28] simple show me how you were delivered
[1:52:31] this is what God did for me I don't I
[1:52:35] can't give you an understanding on it
[1:52:37] but God did it I believe God's word it's
[1:52:41] become a reality to me amen we don't we
[1:52:44] want to share the gospel of Christ in a
[1:52:47] way that's that's a reality that's
[1:52:49] something real that's not something that
[1:52:51] you know oh you know he's he goes to
[1:52:55] that church for 6 weeks and then you'll
[1:52:57] see him at a different church then
[1:52:59] you'll see him at another church it's
[1:53:01] because there's no foundation on the
[1:53:03] pure word of God let the word anchor
[1:53:07] into their hearts I'm going to finish up
[1:53:09] here five more minutes let's go to the
[1:53:11] next scripture we're going to close this
[1:53:12] up real fast because I want to get
[1:53:15] something H
[1:53:18] Allelujah Jeremiah 3110 it says hear the
[1:53:22] word of the Lord all ye nations and
[1:53:24] declare it in the Isles of far off and
[1:53:26] say he that scattereth Israel will
[1:53:29] gather him and keep him as a Shepherd
[1:53:32] doth the flock amen praise God
[1:53:35] hallelujah listen to brother brandom he
[1:53:37] says now 2700 years ago since that time
[1:53:41] he said in the third day we'll be
[1:53:43] gathered again after two days and in the
[1:53:46] third day will be gathered again and
[1:53:48] receive life in his sight do you see the
[1:53:52] promise the hour perfectly wrote on the
[1:53:55] wall we see where we are living now in
[1:53:58] the Homeland waiting for the Feast of
[1:54:00] trumpets Israel now in their Homeland or
[1:54:04] the recognizing of the atonement to wait
[1:54:08] to wait for the coming to mourn for the
[1:54:10] rejection the first time that they
[1:54:12] rejected it they're in the Homeland for
[1:54:15] that waiting what are they all
[1:54:18] everything is positionally
[1:54:20] placed okay everything is in place right
[1:54:24] now for Israel they're in their Homeland
[1:54:27] they're they're they're defending their
[1:54:29] Homeland amen praise God but here we are
[1:54:32] in our position now listen here he says
[1:54:35] he gathered Israel the three days in the
[1:54:38] third day he said he would do it 2700
[1:54:42] years have passed in that third day he
[1:54:44] said he would gather them together and
[1:54:46] he's done it he said he'd make known the
[1:54:48] way of life there you are just waiting
[1:54:51] now for the bride to get out of the way
[1:54:54] so they can come home the two prophets
[1:54:57] Hebrew prophets that'll
[1:55:00] recognize amen praise God let's go to
[1:55:03] the next
[1:55:05] slide so we're talking about Israel is
[1:55:08] God's time piece and in Matthew 24:31 he
[1:55:12] said Jesus he said he shall send his
[1:55:15] angels with a great sound of a trumpet
[1:55:18] and they shall gather together his elect
[1:55:20] this is the hour we're living in for the
[1:55:22] Four Winds from one end of Heaven to the
[1:55:25] other now learn a parable of the Fig
[1:55:27] Tree when his branch is yet tender and
[1:55:30] put it forth leaves you know that summer
[1:55:32] is nigh so likewise ye when you see all
[1:55:36] these things know that it is near even
[1:55:39] at the doors verily I say unto you this
[1:55:44] generation shall not pass till all these
[1:55:47] things be fulfilled now I want you to
[1:55:50] understand here Jesus was talking
[1:55:52] to the Jews he was talking to the
[1:55:55] children of Israel at that
[1:55:57] time and so he was talking about a time
[1:56:01] when the when because he knew that that
[1:56:03] there was going to be an absolute
[1:56:06] desolation of of
[1:56:10] of Jerusalem okay and in
[1:56:13] ad70 he they went in there and they
[1:56:15] completely the Romans went in there and
[1:56:17] completely annihilated Solomon's Temple
[1:56:20] completely wiped out everything
[1:56:22] and Scattered the the the the children
[1:56:25] of Israel that they could not have
[1:56:28] anymore their Homeland until
[1:56:32] 1948 now Jesus was talking about a
[1:56:34] future event here and I believe he was
[1:56:37] talking about this day this time where
[1:56:41] Israel is now in her Homeland because
[1:56:43] the Fig Tree is Israel how many knows
[1:56:46] that brother Braham said that very often
[1:56:48] and we know that through the scriptures
[1:56:49] you can go back and read where God
[1:56:51] speaks about about the Fig Tree and even
[1:56:54] Jesus spoke about the Fig
[1:56:56] Tree but he said when you see this
[1:57:01] happening that generation I believe he
[1:57:04] was talking about this
[1:57:06] generation now if we look at Generations
[1:57:09] you know a lot of people say oh but a
[1:57:11] generation I used to think oh a
[1:57:12] generation is 40 years or 50
[1:57:15] years guess what if you were living in
[1:57:18] the days of Noah generation would have
[1:57:19] been maybe 150 years
[1:57:22] if you were living in the time of
[1:57:24] Adam and Seth you might have lived 800
[1:57:29] years
[1:57:31] okay but here I want you to listen here
[1:57:33] as we close now because I'm going to end
[1:57:35] with with this okay listen
[1:57:40] here now brother braham's speaking here
[1:57:42] in the seventh seal he says now when he
[1:57:44] said you see these Jews begin to put
[1:57:47] forth their buds Out Over Yonder when
[1:57:50] that Israel begins to turn back getting
[1:57:52] into her country when she gets there the
[1:57:55] church is ready to
[1:57:57] Rapture okay now he was saying that back
[1:57:59] in
[1:58:00] 1965 1963 in the seventh
[1:58:04] seal there's only three and a half years
[1:58:08] left until the end of the old world and
[1:58:10] she goes into total chaos and it comes
[1:58:14] to the
[1:58:15] Millennium and to the new Earth said
[1:58:18] even at the door 1,000 years on Earth is
[1:58:21] only one day with God in three and a
[1:58:23] half years what would it what would it
[1:58:25] be it would be like the blink of an eye
[1:58:27] so many seconds in God's time that's the
[1:58:30] reason he said it's at the door verily I
[1:58:32] say unto you that this generation shall
[1:58:36] not be consumed done away with this
[1:58:39] people until all these things are what
[1:58:43] what won't be done away with they've
[1:58:46] tried to kill the Jew off the Earth all
[1:58:48] the time they'll never be able to do it
[1:58:51] but notice the very generation of Jews
[1:58:55] that seen the return back to Palestine
[1:58:59] that generation would see these things
[1:59:02] happen and just the last two years she
[1:59:06] was fully become a nation with her own
[1:59:09] money and whatever there she is now I
[1:59:12] want to take you to the next scripture
[1:59:14] here go to Psalms 90 and we're closing
[1:59:19] here just a few minutes bear with me and
[1:59:21] we'll get
[1:59:22] done he says now this was the only Psalm
[1:59:25] that Moses wrote and he says here Lord
[1:59:29] thou H has been our Dwelling Place in
[1:59:30] all
[1:59:32] generations see he he recognized Moses
[1:59:34] had a revelation of who Christ was who
[1:59:37] God was he was their Dwelling Place he
[1:59:40] knew before the mountains were brought
[1:59:42] forth or even thou Hast formed the earth
[1:59:45] and the world even from Everlasting to
[1:59:48] Everlasting Thou Art the Lord Jesus
[1:59:51] Hallelujah Thou Art
[1:59:53] God but he goes on and he says here the
[1:59:56] days of our years are three score years
[1:59:59] and 10 and if by reason of strength they
[2:00:02] be for scorn Years yet is their strength
[2:00:05] labor and sorrow for it is soon cut off
[2:00:09] and we fly
[2:00:11] away now I'll read it to you in the
[2:00:14] Amplified version now what I'm talking
[2:00:15] now we're talking about a generation
[2:00:18] here and we're looking at how long a
[2:00:21] generation is
[2:00:23] the Days of Our Lives interpreted
[2:00:26] Amplified Version Psalms 910 it says the
[2:00:28] Days of Our Lives 70 years or even if
[2:00:31] because of strength 80 years yet their
[2:00:35] pride in additional years is only labor
[2:00:38] and sorrow for it is gone and we fly
[2:00:43] away oh there's going to be a flying
[2:00:45] away one morning let me tell you Saints
[2:00:47] glory to God hallelujah go to the next
[2:00:49] slide real quick real quick
[2:00:53] this here is a gentile dispensation I'm
[2:00:55] not going to spend any time on it but it
[2:00:57] just shows you all the way from the book
[2:00:59] of Acts when the Holy Spirit came down
[2:01:01] all the way to where we are right now
[2:01:04] which is 1 Thessalonians 4 1 Corinthians
[2:01:06] 15 where the bride is going to be taken
[2:01:10] in a Rapture and then after this it goes
[2:01:13] into and it goes to the Jews we go for a
[2:01:16] three and a half year
[2:01:17] honeymoon and the Jews are going to
[2:01:20] receive their two Prophets
[2:01:23] next slide just showing you the time
[2:01:26] here that's gone by this the 70 weeks of
[2:01:29] Daniel if you look closely here you
[2:01:30] can't really see it you know perfectly
[2:01:33] but you can see here that Daniel's
[2:01:35] prophecy to the end it's all you know if
[2:01:40] you want a copy of this just let me know
[2:01:42] send me a text message I'd be happy to
[2:01:44] email it to you um you know you can pick
[2:01:46] it up right off the internet okay it's
[2:01:48] done by Pastor Ron m malbo okay but it's
[2:01:53] it's a nice illustration of the times
[2:01:55] and the season and where we're at but
[2:01:56] here's what I want to show you that the
[2:01:59] Holy Spirit showed me and and Saints I'm
[2:02:02] just I'm just bringing what the Lord
[2:02:04] laid on my heart so take this and and
[2:02:07] understand that that you know it's it's
[2:02:09] just God has always put it on me that
[2:02:12] prophecy is something that that I've
[2:02:14] always been watching I'm watching for
[2:02:17] prophecy that's why you saw you know I
[2:02:19] ministered on the on the sun and the
[2:02:20] moon and the and the and the eclipses
[2:02:22] and and and the timing of the of the of
[2:02:25] the the cloud and all the breakdown of
[2:02:27] all those things and the hour that we're
[2:02:29] living in but here now watch Israel in
[2:02:31] the time piece a chart and a table of
[2:02:35] Israel's life expectancy which I got
[2:02:37] which was right from a a a good source
[2:02:40] from the United Nations projections okay
[2:02:43] also included right through the year
[2:02:45] 201100 you can look this up on the
[2:02:47] internet but the current life expectancy
[2:02:49] for Israel in 2024 is 83.6 three
[2:02:54] years
[2:02:56] 83. 63
[2:02:59] years the life expectancy in 23 was 83.4
[2:03:03] n so life expectancy is actually in a in
[2:03:06] in a bit of an uptrend right now so
[2:03:09] let's go to the next slide because this
[2:03:11] I just wanted to draw out draw out here
[2:03:14] where are we at Israel became a nation
[2:03:16] in May of
[2:03:19] 1948 and that was the time that the Fig
[2:03:21] tree was putting forth its buds and the
[2:03:24] average life expectancy in 2024 if we
[2:03:27] look at Psalms 90 and we look and we see
[2:03:31] how it says that you know between 75 or
[2:03:34] you know 70 to 80 years and we use that
[2:03:39] formula today it's between 73 and 83 as
[2:03:44] a reference and you add those two
[2:03:46] numbers together which equals 156 you
[2:03:49] divide it by two equals 78
[2:03:52] when you take the year of
[2:03:55] 1948 and you add 78 years to it we come
[2:03:59] to
[2:04:01] 226 I'm not telling you that that's
[2:04:03] exactly the date that it's going to
[2:04:05] happen the year it's going to happen the
[2:04:06] scripture didn't say it said we wouldn't
[2:04:09] know the the the
[2:04:11] hour but I believe that we're coming
[2:04:14] into
[2:04:15] the
[2:04:17] very last moments of this season
[2:04:22] and if this points to
[2:04:25] 2026 this generation will end around
[2:04:28] 2026 to
[2:04:30] 2030 or maybe
[2:04:32] 2025 we don't
[2:04:34] know but all I know is that this
[2:04:37] generation that he was talking about is
[2:04:40] going to
[2:04:41] see that
[2:04:44] event of
[2:04:46] Israel receiving their two
[2:04:49] prophets they're going to witness
[2:04:51] they're going to these things are going
[2:04:53] to
[2:04:54] happen what time are we living in Saints
[2:04:57] brother brandham said that Israel was
[2:04:59] allotted
[2:05:01] 1,954
[2:05:03] years up until when they rejected
[2:05:07] Messiah and then it went to the Gentiles
[2:05:10] and if you take the Gentile dispensation
[2:05:13] and you go 1900 and brother Brenham
[2:05:16] talked about at that time when he when
[2:05:18] he did the formula he says he he
[2:05:20] believed that it would all come and and
[2:05:22] happened right around
[2:05:24] 1977 and he was looking for something to
[2:05:27] happen right around that time that all
[2:05:28] things would come together but he never
[2:05:30] said thus sayeth the Lord he said now
[2:05:32] this is me but he knew something was
[2:05:35] cooking because he was looking at the
[2:05:36] time and the season and the and the and
[2:05:38] the and the the 70 weeks of Daniel and
[2:05:40] he was putting it all together and if
[2:05:42] you add
[2:05:44] 1954 to the time when
[2:05:48] Israel okay rejected the word you had
[2:05:51] 1954 years when they rejected Messiah
[2:05:55] you'll come and if if the number was
[2:05:57] 1977 which brother Brenham said it was
[2:06:01] then you add 50 years to 1977 which is a
[2:06:05] Pentecost which is our
[2:06:09] Jubilee you'll come to
[2:06:12] 2027 I'm not saying that that's all I'm
[2:06:15] trying to say is where are we at how
[2:06:18] close are we are we are we recognizing
[2:06:21] ing the hour that we're living in are we
[2:06:23] are we see let the musicians come are we
[2:06:25] seeing the the the time and the season
[2:06:28] that we're living in are we taking H our
[2:06:31] our walk with God
[2:06:33] serious are we are we looking to to
[2:06:36] improve our walk with God to get closer
[2:06:39] to God to let others know what the Lord
[2:06:42] is doing in this day and in this hour
[2:06:44] because we're just looking for that last
[2:06:45] one remember the Gentile
[2:06:48] dispensation could already be over
[2:06:51] it could already be over Saints all that
[2:06:55] the that that's to be in there they just
[2:06:56] need some perfecting they need some some
[2:06:59] some some tweaking they need some some
[2:07:01] Deliverance in their lives they need to
[2:07:04] be placed into the body of Christ to the
[2:07:07] place where God wants them to be so that
[2:07:09] they can manifest the portion of the
[2:07:11] word that God wants to manifest because
[2:07:14] he called you for a purpose
[2:07:18] amen what time are we living in Saints
[2:07:23] what an hour amen we were thinking 2000
[2:07:27] then we were thinking
[2:07:29] 2015 then we were thinking 2020 then we
[2:07:32] were thinking but then you know as the
[2:07:34] time goes on all of a sudden the
[2:07:36] inspiration starts to come and I believe
[2:07:40] that we are going to receive faith in
[2:07:42] this word that's going to bring us right
[2:07:45] into Heavenly places where we are going
[2:07:47] to see so much of the word he's going to
[2:07:50] reveal so much because remember this is
[2:07:52] all a progression of his plan and his
[2:07:56] plan will never stop it's going to
[2:07:59] progress us until we go into the Rapture
[2:08:02] until we spend three and a half years
[2:08:03] with him and then come back to have to
[2:08:07] fight and and Reign and Rule with Jesus
[2:08:10] Christ in the
[2:08:13] Millennium what an hour what a
[2:08:16] plan I'm just so glad to be a part of
[2:08:19] this Saints I'm rejoicing night and day
[2:08:23] as I walk this Pilgrim way I'm rejoicing
[2:08:26] to know that the Holy Spirit has given
[2:08:28] the the the ability given this church
[2:08:31] this group of people here the ability to
[2:08:34] recognize the word and to say Amen to
[2:08:37] the revealed word of this day and of
[2:08:39] this hour and allow it to over uh
[2:08:42] possess them and take control and lead
[2:08:44] them and guide them
[2:08:47] regardless of the
[2:08:50] battles isra Israel said we will fight
[2:08:53] this alone if we got to fight it
[2:08:56] alone and I'm telling you if you've got
[2:08:59] the spirit of God inside of you you will

[2:09:27] person but they need
[2:09:30] Deliverance they need the spirit of God

[2:09:34] can't stay that way amen they'll be
[2:09:36] delivered they'll be set
[2:09:39] free I'm not bashing gazing this and
[2:09:42] that that's not what that I'm just
[2:09:44] telling you what the word of God says
[2:09:46] it's an Abomination before God and we
[2:09:49] will not we will not bow down to to
[2:09:52] man's teachings and the laws of this

[2:10:33] Abomination today he's the same God back

[2:10:45] and he is going to interpret his word we
