[10:35] Welcome.
[10:37] Hallelujah. trust that we're all
[10:40] expecting to hear from the Lord this
[10:42] [music] morning. I am. Hallelujah. Let
[10:46] us turn to Psalms 139.
[10:49] [music] Going to read little parts of
[10:51] it. It's a long one, so we'll just see.
[10:54] Hallelujah.
[10:56] Oh Lord,
[10:58] thou hast searched me and known me.
[11:03] Thou knowest my downsitting,
[11:06] my [music] uprising.
[11:08] Thou understandeth my thought a far off.
[11:12] Thou compass my path
[11:16] and my lying down,
[11:19] and are acquainted with all my ways. Oh
[11:24] man, does he know you that way?
[11:26] Hallelujah. For there is not a word in
[11:31] my tongue, but lo, [music]
[11:33] oh Lord, thou knowest it alltogether.
[11:38] Thou [music] hast beset me behind and
[11:41] before and laid thy hand upon me. Oh,
[11:45] hallelujah.
[11:46] Such knowledge [music] is too wonderful
[11:49] for me. It is high. I cannot attain to
[11:53] it unto it. [music]
[11:55] Whether shall I go from thy spirit? Or
[11:58] whether shall I flee from thy presence?
[12:02] If I ascend up into the heavens, thou
[12:04] art there. If I make my bed in hell,
[12:08] behold, thou art there. [music]
[12:11] If I take my wings of the morning and
[12:15] dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,
[12:18] even there shall thy hand lead me.
[12:23] Doesn't matter where we are this
[12:24] morning. and what condition we are.
[12:26] Amen. And thy right [music] hand shall
[12:29] hold me.
[12:32] If I say surely darkness shall cover me,
[12:35] even night shall be light unto me.
[12:39] Hallelujah. Yay, the darkness hideth not
[12:42] from me thee, but the night shineth as a
[12:46] day.
[12:48] The darkness [music] and the light are
[12:50] both alike to thee. Doesn't matter
[12:54] saints. Hallelujah. What you're going
[12:57] [music] through, it's all light.
[12:59] Hallelujah. We're going to skip down to
[13:01] here.
[13:03] Hallelujah. How precious also
[13:08] are the thoughts unto me, oh God. How
[13:12] great is the sum of them. If I should
[13:15] [music] count them, they are more in
[13:19] number than the sand. Oh, hallelujah.
[13:22] When I awake, [music]
[13:24] I am still with thee. Surely thou slain
[13:28] the wicked, oh God. [music] Depart from
[13:30] me there, therefore, ye bloody men. Let
[13:34] us go down to 23.
[13:37] Search me, oh God. [music] This is what
[13:39] we want this morning. The word of God.
[13:41] Search me, oh God, and know my heart.
[13:45] Try me and know my thoughts and see if
[13:49] there be any wicked way in me.
[13:52] and lead me in the way of everlasting.
[13:56] Amen. That's our prayer this morning.
[13:58] That's why we're here. [music] We're not
[13:59] here because of the building. Even we're
[14:02] not even here because of one of another.
[14:04] We're here to meet with the word, the
[14:06] revealed word this morning so that we
[14:08] may leave different out of those doors
[14:10] than when we came in. God bless you.

[25:05] doctor, there's no lawyer, there's no
[25:07] nothing besides me that can handle your
[25:10] situation. You want to bring something
[25:12] before him. Praise God. He's the mighty
[25:16] God [music] this morning. The creator of

[25:37] and ride down. [music]
[25:43] &gt;&gt; Gracious, loving, precious heavenly
[25:46] father, living God of heaven and earth,
[25:49] we humbly bow our hearts and our lives
[25:51] before your presence this wonderful
[25:54] morning, Lord, to give you thanks and
[25:56] praise for Lord for what you did for us
[25:59] 2,000 [music] years ago. And we gather
[26:01] here, Lord, Lord, to worship and to
[26:04] praise you and to let the enemy know
[26:06] whose side we [music] are on. As Lord,
[26:09] we recognize, we thank you for raising
[26:12] from the grave and giving that witness,
[26:14] Lord, in our heart today. [music] And
[26:16] Lord, through the preaching of your word
[26:18] today, Lord, we ask that you produce in
[26:21] us, Lord, a heart that will continue to
[26:24] worship you and praise you and give us
[26:26] strength, oh God, in this [music] dark
[26:28] hour that we're living in, heavenly
[26:30] father. And as we're here, Lord, we just
[26:32] ask you once again to remember our
[26:35] friends and our family, Lord, who are
[26:37] not yet gathered in Christ, [music] oh
[26:39] God. But we're believing for them, Lord.
[26:41] Trusting, Lord, that maybe today will be
[26:44] the day, Lord, where they surrender
[26:46] their life to you, oh God. Amen.
[26:47] &gt;&gt; And accept Christ as personal savior in
[26:51] their life. Father,
[26:52] &gt;&gt; we're claiming them, Lord. And even
[26:54] though that rapture day hasn't come yet,
[26:56] Lord, we still haven't given up, Lord.
[26:58] We claim them today under your token. Oh
[27:01] God, knowing that Lord, the day will
[27:04] come where they will come into Christ.
[27:06] Heavenly Father, we ask you, oh God,
[27:08] today as you know the many burdens and
[27:10] things upon our heart, heavenly father,
[27:12] we're [music] desiring, Lord, healing,
[27:14] maybe, Lord, some financial help,
[27:16] Heavenly Father, whatever it might be,
[27:19] maybe discouragements, [music]
[27:20] Lord, that we've experienced throughout
[27:22] the week, we just lay them, Lord, at
[27:24] your feet. We ask you, oh God, we thank
[27:26] you for a wonderful pastor and brother
[27:29] Danny. We ask you, Lord God, today
[27:31] [music] just use him, Lord, in a mighty
[27:33] way, heavenly father. Lord,
[27:35] &gt;&gt; search our heart, oh God, this morning,
[27:38] and answer our prayer. As you've seen,
[27:40] Lord, we were on our knees this morning
[27:42] and asking you, heavenly father, for
[27:44] something. May today be the day, Lord,
[27:47] that prayer is answered. [music]
[27:49] And we know, Lord, that when we leave
[27:51] this place, we will be blessed because
[27:54] we came. Amen.
[27:55] &gt;&gt; We ask these things and we lay them at
[27:57] your feet this morning in Jesus Christ's
[27:59] name.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Greet one another, brethren. Greet one
[28:06] another. God bless you.
[28:09] Praise God.
[28:11] Good to be in the house of the Lord this
[28:13] morning again to [music] hear his word.
[28:15] God bless each and every one of you.
[28:17] [singing] The world is falling apart.
[28:20] [music] I saw Jesus down in my
[28:26] [music] car away

[30:17] changed.
[30:20] We [music]
[30:21] shall be changed

[30:30] in between.
[30:34] [music]
[30:37] Amen. I've got my mind made up and
[30:41] [music] I won't turn back. I am going to
[30:45] see my Jesus someday.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; [music]

[39:45] heavily impacts the vocal ability and

[49:57] it's the message of the hour. It's what
[49:59] God is doing in this hour. It's the
[50:01] Joshua commission. Amen. It's where God
[50:03] comes on the scene. He comes direct. He

[50:59] and um the last few weeks we've been
[51:01] looking at obtaining our inheritance and
[51:03] all the elements around it. And um today
[51:06] we just want to continue um you know
[51:08] it's part four of obtaining our
[51:10] inheritance. It's actually part 10 of um
[51:13] the purpose of God series. Amen. And the
[51:17] uh being called unto the adoption, being
[51:20] called to sunship. Amen. That's what
[51:24] this is all about. This is the message
[51:26] of the day. Amen. That the sons and
[51:29] daughters of God will manifest
[51:32] and she will produce the rapture.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. The message of the hour. Let's go
[51:37] to our scripture.
[51:40] Amen. Our scripture is from Ephesians
[51:43] 1:es 9-11.
[51:46] having made known unto us the mystery of
[51:49] his will, according to his good
[51:52] pleasure, which he hath purposed in
[51:55] himself. Amen. that in the dispensation
[51:59] of the fullness of times he might gather
[52:02] together in one all things in Christ,
[52:04] both which are in heaven and which are
[52:08] on earth, even in him, in whom also we
[52:14] have obtained an inheritance. Amen.
[52:18] being predestinated according to the
[52:21] purpose of him who workketh all things
[52:24] after the counsel of his own will. Let
[52:29] us pray. Father,
[52:31] Lord, we've read your word. We welcome
[52:33] you now to come and break the word of
[52:36] life. Lord, the same way that you did it
[52:40] when you came the first time, Lord, on
[52:44] the resurrection,
[52:45] you came and you met individually. It
[52:49] wasn't a public show anymore, Father. It
[52:51] was you speaking to the hearts
[52:55] individually of your sons and daughters,
[52:58] bringing them into a recognition of your
[53:02] presence in their midst. Lord, won't you
[53:04] do it this morning once again? speak to
[53:07] our hearts. Let that element of silence
[53:12] just explode within our hearts the
[53:14] revelation of your word, Lord,
[53:16] manifesting the day, the hour that we're
[53:19] living in now. We pray in Jesus Christ's
[53:22] name. Amen. God bless you. You may be
[53:24] seated.
[53:26] Glory to God. Amen.
[53:28] You know the mystery of his will.
[53:32] We are the inheritance of God. He has a
[53:37] will. Everything that he purposed within
[53:39] himself before the foundations of the
[53:42] world, he will bring to pass.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; He will bring into manifestation. And in
[53:49] that will, there are sons and daughters
[53:51] of God that have an inheritance. Amen.
[53:54] And he says here that he's making known
[53:56] unto us the mystery of his will. Amen.
[53:59] Praise God. And that we have obtained an
[54:03] inheritance. It's not something that
[54:06] that you know that you have to work for.
[54:09] It's not something that you have to um
[54:11] you know pay the price for. The price
[54:14] has already been paid. Amen. He's
[54:17] prepared the will. He's prepared your
[54:19] inheritance. All you need to do is
[54:21] obtain it. Amen. Recognize that it's
[54:24] yours. That your name is written there.
[54:27] And how do you know? By recognizing the
[54:29] word for your day. by recognizing what
[54:32] God is doing in this hour. Amen. Praise
[54:35] God. Because this is all a
[54:37] predestination
[54:39] according to his will. Amen. Glory to
[54:42] God. Amen. Let's read the the the quote
[54:45] here. Um you can go to the next slide
[54:47] from adoption 4. He says, "Look,
[54:50] has predestinated us unto this
[54:53] inheritance."
[54:55] If I'm right, inheritance is something.
[54:59] If God is knocking at my heart and
[55:01] saying, "William Brandom, I called you a
[55:03] long time ago before the foundations of
[55:06] the world to preach the gospel. I have
[55:10] an inheritance, an inheritance of
[55:12] eternal life." Now, God sent Jesus to
[55:16] make that inheritance real to me.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. God has sent the word for our day.
[55:23] Who is Jesus? Jesus is the word. In the
[55:26] beginning was the word and the word was
[55:28] with God and the word was God. Amen. And
[55:32] if he's the same yesterday, today, and
[55:33] forever. And he's sent Jesus to you,
[55:36] it's because he sent you the word.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Amen. And he says,
[55:45] and he's made it real to me because
[55:47] there was nothing I could do to he says
[55:51] there uh but in the fullness there was
[55:54] nothing I could do to to inherit it. It
[55:56] was blank. It was valid. There's nothing
[56:00] I could do. But in the fullness of time,
[56:03] God sent in his own good time.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Amen. God's got a
[56:10] plan. It's not according to man's plan.
[56:13] It's all according to his good time.
[56:16] Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[56:20] Amen. Uh uh Jesus the lamb slain from
[56:24] the foundation of the world. His blood
[56:27] was shed that I might go to my
[56:30] inheritance. Amen. Why would he have to
[56:33] shed blood for us to go to our
[56:35] inheritance?
[56:36] TO BE WHAT?
[56:39] WHAT INHERITANCE? The sunship. to be a
[56:43] son of God. Amen. Glory to God. Amen.
[56:48] You know, when we look at um you know,
[56:50] the original definition of adoption, we
[56:52] go back into the Bible days, it was all
[56:55] based on the fact that there would be an
[56:57] inheritance. And it was not based on the
[57:00] concept of today. And we've, you know,
[57:01] we've said this already. It was based on
[57:04] the concept, you know, that God that
[57:07] that that a father would declare his son
[57:12] supreme authority over his inheritance.
[57:16] Amen. This is the biblical inheritance.
[57:20] This is the one that we are looking
[57:22] into. This is the one that we have come
[57:24] into adoption of. Amen. It's a full
[57:28] authority in full power. Amen. This this
[57:32] is the adoption that we're talking
[57:34] about. Amen. It's the manifestation of
[57:37] the sons of God in the last times. Amen.
[57:41] In the last days. And the Lord
[57:43] predestinated you for that particular
[57:47] portion of the word.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; That's the portion that you are ordained
[57:51] to. Amen. In this day and in this hour
[57:54] to manifest sons of God. Amen. Glory to
[57:59] God. in a supreme authority to speak on
[58:03] his behalf. Hallelujah. Amen. To speak.
[58:07] He says, "This is the only age where
[58:09] full adoption brings you to be the voice
[58:12] of God."
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the last days, in the end time,
[58:17] God has given us his full authority to
[58:20] speak his word. Amen. Why? In order to
[58:23] produce mature believers. Amen. To
[58:27] fulfill the purpose of God. Hallelujah.
[58:30] Amen. Glory to God. Let's go to our uh
[58:33] next scripture.
[58:36] Ephesians chapter 3 verse one. Now for
[58:39] this cause I Paul the prisoner of Jesus
[58:43] Christ for you Gentiles. If you have
[58:46] heard of the dispensation of the grace
[58:48] of God, which is given me to you, Ward,
[58:53] how that by revelation he made known
[58:57] unto me the mystery.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. So, so pay attention
[59:03] here as we as we go into this. as I
[59:06] wrote a for in few words whereby when
[59:09] you read you may understand my knowledge
[59:13] in the mystery of Christ.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; So there's an element of mystery that
[59:19] God would would leave until the end time
[59:23] and he's not talking about mysteries.
[59:26] Paul is making it very clear here that
[59:29] there is a mystery of Christ.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. The whole plan of
[59:34] redemption is based around this mystery
[59:38] of Christ. Amen. Which in other ages was
[59:42] not made known unto the sons of men.
[59:45] Amen. This is not for sons of men. This
[59:49] mystery is for sons of God.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The manifested sons of God.
[59:55] Amen. Glory to God. It's not revealed
[59:57] unto his holy prophets. uh a and is now
[1:00:02] revealed unto his holy apostles and
[1:00:05] prophets by the spirit. Amen. Aren't you
[1:00:08] glad that God sent us a prophet?
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. To make known the mystery of
[1:00:13] Christ.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is this is what's
[1:00:16] actually brought us here.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; This is why you're here today.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; You're not here because, oh, I'm a
[1:00:22] Christian and I belong to this church.
[1:00:24] Oh, I belong to that church. I go to
[1:00:26] this church. I'm a Baptist. I'm a
[1:00:29] Presbyterian. I'm a Catholic. No, this
[1:00:31] is not why you're here. If you're here
[1:00:34] today, you're saying, "I'm a son of God.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; I'm a daughter of God.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; I've come into contact with my father.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; I know that I have a heavenly father."
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; That's the true relationship of
[1:00:48] Christianity. Amen. If there's a
[1:00:51] definition, Christianity is is to have
[1:00:54] Christ in you
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; and to know it.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he goes on here, verse
[1:01:01] six, that the Gentiles should be fellow
[1:01:04] airs and of the same body and partakers
[1:01:09] of his promise in Christ
[1:01:13] by the gospel, by the word. In Christ,
[1:01:17] by the word. Amen. whereof I was made a
[1:01:20] minister according to the gift of the
[1:01:23] grace of God given unto me by the
[1:01:26] effectual working of his power. Amen.
[1:01:29] Glory to God. Let's read on. Go to the
[1:01:31] next slide. Now pay attention. And he
[1:01:34] says, "Unto me
[1:01:36] who am less than the least of all the
[1:01:39] saints is this grace given that I should
[1:01:43] preach among the Gentiles the
[1:01:45] uncarchable riches of Christ."
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Like you you got to see here what like
[1:01:50] Paul is bringing forth a revelation of
[1:01:53] God. And he goes on and he says, "And to
[1:01:56] make all men see what is the fellowship
[1:01:59] of the mystery." There is it. There it
[1:02:02] is again. You see, there's a mystery
[1:02:04] that's unveiling itself. Amen. Now,
[1:02:07] we're not trying to make this
[1:02:08] mysterious. That's not Listen, if if
[1:02:11] there's anything, I want this to be so
[1:02:13] simple that even the children can
[1:02:16] understand it. Amen.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. But here he's
[1:02:20] saying there's a fellowship of that
[1:02:22] mystery so that we can see it. And Paul,
[1:02:26] he was, you know, he he was the the the
[1:02:28] first church age messenger that was
[1:02:31] given so much revelation on this mystery
[1:02:34] of God. Hallelujah. But yet, he didn't
[1:02:38] have the full understanding of this
[1:02:41] mystery of God.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He only had the portion that
[1:02:45] he was given in that first church age.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's move on. which from
[1:02:51] the beginning of the world hath been
[1:02:54] hidden. God
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; who CREATED ALL THINGS BY JESUS CHRIST
[1:03:00] TO the intent that now unto the
[1:03:02] principalities and powers in heavenly
[1:03:05] places might be known by the church the
[1:03:09] manifold wisdom of God according to the
[1:03:13] eternal purpose which he purposed in
[1:03:17] Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; You read that, you study that scripture,
[1:03:24] you can go back and you can draw so much
[1:03:27] out of that. It was all a mystery that
[1:03:30] he had from before the foundations of
[1:03:32] the world. Where was that mystery? In
[1:03:36] him.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; What who whose purpose was it? His
[1:03:40] purpose. How was it all done? Through
[1:03:43] Jesus Christ who created all things. How
[1:03:47] can Jesus create all things and not be
[1:03:50] God?
[1:03:52] So he was God in the beginning. In the
[1:03:54] beginning was the word. Amen. The word
[1:03:56] was made flesh. This whole plan is all
[1:04:00] about him.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; It's all about him bringing himself into
[1:04:05] manifestation. And this is what the
[1:04:07] world, the church world has always
[1:04:09] missed. They missed it the very first
[1:04:11] time that he came. He came to his own
[1:04:14] and his own received him not.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Why? Because they were not given the
[1:04:20] eyes to see. They could not recognize.
[1:04:23] He said to them, you know, to the to the
[1:04:25] disciples when they're, you know, they
[1:04:27] said, "Lord, you know, you just preached
[1:04:30] the word of life and and it's so real to
[1:04:32] us." But look, they're all leaving. Why?
[1:04:34] Why are they leaving? He says, "Blessed
[1:04:37] are your ears. unto you. It has been
[1:04:40] given to know the mysteries
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; of the kingdom.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, there's an element that
[1:04:48] draws us together. And this is what Paul
[1:04:51] is is preaching here. And this is what
[1:04:53] we want to look at. We want to look at
[1:04:55] the depths of the fellowship of the
[1:04:57] mystery. Amen. Praise God. So, in order
[1:05:01] for us to look at this, let's go to the
[1:05:03] you just stay on this slide here for a
[1:05:04] few minutes.
[1:05:06] So in order for us to be like God, we
[1:05:09] need to understand that this that this
[1:05:13] fellowship was in him from the very
[1:05:16] beginning. Amen. Glory to God. Paul here
[1:05:20] who's the first church age messenger
[1:05:22] speaking to the Gentiles
[1:05:24] these uncarchable riches of Christ. So
[1:05:28] you can't search this out.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; It must be revealed. He made it very
[1:05:33] clear who who God who by revelation
[1:05:38] you know people read that scripture and
[1:05:40] they don't understand the the the the
[1:05:41] the importance of revelation that that
[1:05:44] the word of God is not something that
[1:05:46] you figure out.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; It's something that you surrender to.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; It's something that you yield your
[1:05:52] spirit to him and you say Lord reveal
[1:05:55] your thoughts unto me.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; And this is what Paul was making very
[1:06:00] clear. these unsearchable riches. He
[1:06:03] couldn't search them. He couldn't
[1:06:04] listen, he was he was a theologian of
[1:06:06] theologians.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; But when he got converted, he had to go
[1:06:09] to the to the desert for for two or
[1:06:12] three years to get all his theology out
[1:06:14] of him.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it was not God. Listen,
[1:06:19] you can take in the word, you can read
[1:06:21] the word, but it takes the spirit to
[1:06:24] give it life.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; It takes the Holy Ghost to bring it to
[1:06:27] life in you. And that only happens by
[1:06:30] revelation. Amen. And he says that the
[1:06:33] Gentiles should be fellow heirs of the
[1:06:35] same body, sons of God. And what does
[1:06:39] the adoption do? It makes you a minister
[1:06:42] of the word for your day. That's what
[1:06:46] sunship does. It brings you into a place
[1:06:49] of authority as a son to speak on behalf
[1:06:53] of God. So Paul is preaching so that we
[1:06:56] can discover what is the fellowship of
[1:06:59] the mystery fellowship of the not
[1:07:02] mystery of fellowship.
[1:07:05] It's not about coming to you know oh
[1:07:07] let's get together and and let's have
[1:07:09] fellowship you know we can fellowship
[1:07:11] all around. No no no there's a mystery
[1:07:13] there's a there's a there's a fellowship
[1:07:15] in the mystery.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; That's where the true fellowship lies.
[1:07:20] Amen.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; That's the fellowship that sons of God
[1:07:23] gather together week in and week out.
[1:07:25] They're they're under the fellowship of
[1:07:27] the mystery. Amen. Praise God. And our
[1:07:30] ministry is to show that fellowship, to
[1:07:34] show that ministry, to show that mystery
[1:07:38] in our lives
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; to show that Jesus Christ is not just
[1:07:43] some denominational teaching out there
[1:07:46] or some man's interpretation of of the
[1:07:49] word. It's of no private interpretation.
[1:07:52] Amen. Praise God. So, what do we get
[1:07:55] from this scripture? We see that this
[1:07:57] this was hidden from the foundations of
[1:08:00] the world. But yet it requires sons of
[1:08:04] God to be manifested
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; in order to bring out this fellowship.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Understand?
[1:08:14] This this this mystery
[1:08:17] that that Paul is is is explaining here
[1:08:21] is also telling us that it that it takes
[1:08:23] it takes sons of God to come into
[1:08:26] manifestation
[1:08:28] in order to to bring this mystery into
[1:08:32] into plain view. in order to draw the
[1:08:36] sons and daughters of God
[1:08:39] to where the carcass is to where the the
[1:08:42] mana is to where the fresh revelation of
[1:08:45] of God making himself known having
[1:08:48] preeminence in the church. Amen. Under
[1:08:51] the five-fold ministry, it takes the
[1:08:54] sons to manifest. This mystery was from
[1:08:57] the beginning. It was hidden in
[1:08:59] [clears throat] God who created all
[1:09:01] things by Jesus Christ. So if all things
[1:09:03] were created by Jesus Christ, then Jesus
[1:09:06] Christ was in the beginning.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And he's the same God.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; He's not one in three. He's not part of
[1:09:16] a trinity.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; No, sir. Hallelujah. He was the word
[1:09:21] made flesh. God became man.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This was God's plan right
[1:09:27] from the very beginning. This is the
[1:09:30] fellowship of the mystery. Amen. Glory
[1:09:32] to God. That he was the logus, the word
[1:09:35] that went forth from himself. Jesus only
[1:09:39] came 2,000 years ago. So, how could he
[1:09:41] create all things?
[1:09:45] Because he is the self-existent one.
[1:09:48] Hallelujah. It's the fellowship of the
[1:09:50] mystery that was hidden in God
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; but now being made manifest.
[1:09:58] So we are here to manifest that very
[1:10:01] element of the mystery of God which is
[1:10:05] to reveal the sons of God and to
[1:10:08] manifest the sons of God. Amen. Let's go
[1:10:11] to our quote here
[1:10:15] in adoption two. He says some people say
[1:10:17] well why didn't God just stop it in the
[1:10:20] beginning? You know and one and and and
[1:10:23] brother Bram's speaking here and he's
[1:10:25] quoting some. He says he somebody said
[1:10:27] he's a cruelhearted brute said Joe Lewis
[1:10:30] the one that condemned Joe or Jack Co.
[1:10:33] See he said he's just a cruelhearted
[1:10:36] brute. There's no such a thing as God.
[1:10:39] If there was such a thing he'd oh I'd
[1:10:42] just call him all kinds of names. See
[1:10:45] but it's just because he might have a
[1:10:47] lot of knowledge up here but he ain't
[1:10:50] got nothing down in here.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why a lot of people there,
[1:10:55] I'm an atheist. I don't believe Jesus
[1:10:58] Christ. I don't believe that God exists.
[1:11:01] It's because there's nothing in here.
[1:11:03] There's no representation.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. But watch what he goes on to say.
[1:11:07] But it's just because he might he might
[1:11:10] have a lot of knowledge up here, but he
[1:11:11] ain't got nothing down here. Now, that's
[1:11:14] where it's at. See, this word tells it
[1:11:18] here, and he's hid it.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. And these mysteries has been hid.
[1:11:24] Now remember the Bible said since the
[1:11:26] foundation of the world.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; But watch waiting for the manifestations
[1:11:32] of the sons of God to display them to
[1:11:36] the church.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. You get it? You see, there's a
[1:11:42] portion of word that you are
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; that you've been ordained to that you
[1:11:48] will display in these last days
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; to the church. Amen. Glory to God. It
[1:11:55] It's God and man, God on earth. Amen. To
[1:11:59] bring many brethren like unto himself.
[1:12:03] Philippians 3 21 says, "Who shall change
[1:12:08] our vile body?" Amen. Praise God.
[1:12:11] Hallelujah. That it may be fashioned
[1:12:14] like unto his glorious body,
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; according to the working whereby he is
[1:12:20] able even to subdue all things unto
[1:12:24] himself. Let me tell you something. If
[1:12:26] you're in Christ and you've receive the
[1:12:29] word of God and you are heir to this
[1:12:32] revelation, all things are subject to
[1:12:36] you as a son or daughter of God.
[1:12:39] Hallelujah.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; When the Holy Ghost came into you, it
[1:12:43] came in order to have his purpose
[1:12:46] control and and and take divine
[1:12:49] preeminence over your life.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; No matter what comes into your life, no
[1:12:54] matter what situation comes into your
[1:12:56] life, if it's sickness that comes into
[1:12:58] your life, IT'S IRRELEVANT. THE HOLY
[1:13:00] GHOST in you will override that sickness
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; because God's purpose will and must
[1:13:07] override that sickness.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; It is the It is because sons of God will
[1:13:12] manifest God.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; And sickness cannot stay where God is.
[1:13:17] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; It has to come subject to him. It must
[1:13:22] obey the word of God. You his purpose
[1:13:25] will override your purpose. It'll
[1:13:27] override your weakness. It'll override
[1:13:30] your days when you feel depressed. When
[1:13:32] you feel that you can't you can't do it
[1:13:35] on your own. You you can't figure it
[1:13:37] out. You you just you just can't you
[1:13:39] CAN'T YOU CAN'T PUT IT TOGETHER, RIGHT?
[1:13:41] YOU JUST YOU'RE LOOKING EVERYWHERE.
[1:13:42] Everywhere you look, you can't see the
[1:13:44] answer. Amen. BUT THE PURPOSE OF GOD
[1:13:46] WILL OVERRIDE IT.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; He goes on here. He says, "Now you go to
[1:13:54] the next slide." He says, "Now I stop on
[1:13:57] my story just a little bit or I'll bring
[1:14:00] I'll go to my to my next thought to get
[1:14:02] this." Now remember, all through the
[1:14:06] ages of Moses, back through the ages of
[1:14:08] the prophets, back through all the ages,
[1:14:11] they've waited until this latter days
[1:14:15] for these things to be displayed
[1:14:17] according to the scriptures. That's
[1:14:19] right. For it is to be revealed to the
[1:14:22] sons of God. Hallelujah. This revelation
[1:14:26] is not for everybody.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; It's not, oh, I'm in the message. I
[1:14:30] believe God sent a prophet. I believe in
[1:14:32] the opening of the seals. I believe in
[1:14:33] the seven church ages. THAT'S THAT'S
[1:14:35] THAT DON'T MEAN NOTHING. AMEN. It's for
[1:14:38] sons of God.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; It's for those that have recognized.
[1:14:42] Amen. That's right. For it is for it to
[1:14:46] be revealed to the sons of God. Why?
[1:14:49] From the lost until like the pyramid. As
[1:14:52] I as I have said, building closer and
[1:14:56] closer. There is a plan of God. Why do
[1:14:58] you think we call this the capstone age?
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's because Christ himself come
[1:15:04] down in 1963.
[1:15:06] Hallelujah.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Listen, you he may not
[1:15:10] have come to you yet.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. The coming of the Lord is not
[1:15:15] always Listen, we can't put a date on
[1:15:17] the coming of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:15:19] Listen. Was the coming of the Lord the
[1:15:21] same when he came to Zach? Uh uh
[1:15:25] Zach uh Zakiah
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Zakius. Amen. Was he coming to Zakius
[1:15:32] the same at at the same time that he
[1:15:34] came to the woman at the well?
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; No. It was different times. But yet when
[1:15:39] he came at his appointed time,
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; they said, "Thou art the Christ.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Thou art the Christ." Our father said
[1:15:47] like the woman at the well that that
[1:15:48] that that when Messiah would come, he
[1:15:51] would do these things. Hallelujah. Glory
[1:15:54] to God. You've read it in the word. You
[1:15:56] heard what brother Brandham said. You've
[1:15:58] listened to the tapes. We listen to
[1:16:00] those tapes. I listen. I wouldn't even
[1:16:02] have a message if I didn't listen to
[1:16:03] those tapes.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; We wouldn't have a message if we didn't
[1:16:08] recognize the prophet of Malachi 4:5.
[1:16:10] Amen. REVELATIONS 10:17. YOU would not
[1:16:13] know. you'd have nothing to preach.
[1:16:16] Hallelujah. But the Holy Ghost, HE SAYS
[1:16:20] THE building is moving closer and closer
[1:16:24] into completion.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. My my my servant Moses is
[1:16:30] dead. BUT HE SAYS, JOSHUA, BE courageous
[1:16:34] because you're going to need courage in
[1:16:35] this hour
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; to to hold that word before the people
[1:16:40] and to stand there and and take the uh
[1:16:43] the the the reproach for the word of God
[1:16:45] because because you're YOU'RE
[1:16:47] RECOGNIZING JOSHUA IS YOUR CAPTAIN.
[1:16:50] JOSHUA is your leader. And who is our
[1:16:52] Joshua?
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. The same yesterday, today,
[1:16:57] and forever. Amen. Glory to God.
[1:17:00] Hallelujah. Amen. In order to manifest
[1:17:03] and to reveal or to make known
[1:17:08] sons of God. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:17:12] Now, with all the great power and
[1:17:15] victories that all the Old Testament
[1:17:17] prophets and kings, they had they did
[1:17:21] they did not get to where they could be
[1:17:25] in this position of manifested sons of
[1:17:30] God.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Look at their great accomplishments.
[1:17:33] But yet, it took the coming of the Lord.
[1:17:37] Without the coming of the Lord, there
[1:17:39] would be no manifested sons.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Because he was the first fruits,
[1:17:45] remember we are the ones that are going
[1:17:47] to take on that same image as his
[1:17:51] glorious image. Amen. Praise God. And
[1:17:54] they could not achieve it. They had to
[1:17:56] die and they went to that fifth
[1:17:58] dimension. They had to wait on the
[1:18:00] coming of the Lord. Amen. They were me.
[1:18:02] Look at David. He had great victories.
[1:18:04] He was anointed with the Holy Spirit,
[1:18:07] anointed by God to to have great
[1:18:09] victories, but yet he fell back into
[1:18:11] adultery. He fell into situations. He
[1:18:14] made mistakes. Hallelujah. Because why?
[1:18:17] Because it was going to take the one to
[1:18:19] come and take the place for all sin.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; If a man sin, a man had to die. Amen.
[1:18:27] Glory to God. That was the only way that
[1:18:29] God could bring sons of God, daughters
[1:18:33] of God back to eternity.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where we were before we came
[1:18:40] here. Amen. Glory to God. He had to pay
[1:18:42] the price for redemption by going to the
[1:18:45] cross and giving up the Holy Ghost which
[1:18:47] now made a way for the Old Testament
[1:18:50] saints to receive their sunship. They
[1:18:53] listen when Christ came when when when
[1:18:55] when Christ died on the cross, he he
[1:18:59] went back to his theophony. He went back
[1:19:02] to his to his sunship. Amen. To the
[1:19:06] image of God. He was now God in human in
[1:19:10] a human form back on earth. And he go
[1:19:14] and what does he do? He goes down to
[1:19:15] hell because that theophony body can
[1:19:18] moved dimensional.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. This is the hour where we
[1:19:22] interdimensionally change, saints.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; And and this was all reflected in him.
[1:19:26] He went down. He He grabbed all those
[1:19:29] that were waiting on him, took the keys
[1:19:32] away from the from the enemy. Amen. And
[1:19:35] took them to their theophony bodies.
[1:19:37] Amen. Glory to God. And now they're
[1:19:39] waiting on us
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; because we've got something that we need
[1:19:44] to do.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. We listen.
[1:19:48] They cannot be made perfect without us.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. So what is
[1:19:55] going on? It's the Holy Ghost, the
[1:19:57] person of God himself uniting or capping
[1:20:01] the body in order to produce sons and
[1:20:05] manifested sons of God. Amen. Glory to
[1:20:07] God. But why does BUT WHY NOW DOES THIS
[1:20:10] come to its fullness? Why why why does
[1:20:13] it have to come to its fullness now?
[1:20:16] because we're at the age where the
[1:20:19] rapture must be manifested
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; in order to produce and manifest sons of
[1:20:27] God who and what is a son of God? He is
[1:20:31] a God. He is he is like God.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Listen, if God brings forth children, he
[1:20:38] brings forth sons. He brings forth
[1:20:40] daughters. Amen. Glory to God. But why
[1:20:43] now? because it's the time of the
[1:20:45] rapture.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; And then it's the time for the
[1:20:48] millennium. Hallelujah. Where the sons
[1:20:51] of God will come back in their
[1:20:54] theophanes
[1:20:56] in order to rule with him. Allelujah.
[1:20:59] Praise God. Forever more. [snorts]
[1:21:02] Let's let's move on here.
[1:21:04] In John chapter one, we're talking about
[1:21:08] manifesting sons of God and that there's
[1:21:11] a there's a there's a fellowship in the
[1:21:13] mystery of that. And that's what we are
[1:21:16] here doing this morning. This is what
[1:21:19] Paul was bringing out. And this is what
[1:21:21] now has been it's been it's been given
[1:21:23] to us to to manifest that mystery of
[1:21:26] God. Amen. Praise God. And look, he says
[1:21:29] here, he came unto his own, and his own
[1:21:32] received him not. But as many as
[1:21:36] received him, to them gave he the power
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; to become the sons of God.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even to them that believe on his
[1:21:47] name, which were were born not of blood,
[1:21:52] nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the
[1:21:55] will of man, but of God.
[1:21:58] We must be born of the word.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; We cannot be born by man's
[1:22:04] denominational teaching.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; We cannot be born by the by by the
[1:22:08] teachings that are even within the
[1:22:10] message. Now
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; that you know that they're they're
[1:22:14] telling you how you you must approach
[1:22:17] God. There's only one way and that's
[1:22:19] through the tapes. That's not God's
[1:22:22] provided way. Hallelujah. Praise God. We
[1:22:26] need to recognize the revelation of God
[1:22:29] himself come down in order to fulfill
[1:22:33] and and and manifest the the the portion
[1:22:37] of the word which brings the
[1:22:38] manifestation of the sons of God into
[1:22:41] their fullness. Amen. And when that
[1:22:44] happens, we're changed.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; We manifest the rapture. Hallelujah.
[1:22:50] Praise God. Listen, let's read the next
[1:22:53] quote here in in adoption because this
[1:22:55] is all about the adoption of sons. How
[1:22:57] many's been reading the paper this week?
[1:23:00] What Kruchev and them said? Oh, they're
[1:23:03] ready. So are we. Amen. Ready. It's all
[1:23:06] right. See? Oh, what? What a privilege.
[1:23:09] What a day. If the Christians could only
[1:23:12] realize the day that we're living in. My
[1:23:15] what do you think the writer of this
[1:23:17] book that's seen it and seen where it
[1:23:19] would be manifested in the last days
[1:23:23] waiting waiting and groaning for those
[1:23:27] sons of God to rise in the last days.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; So there's there there's something about
[1:23:33] us that brings the word into its
[1:23:37] fullness. Amen. And you can see that the
[1:23:40] earth is groaning.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; There's wars. There's there's there's
[1:23:43] this political systems are falling
[1:23:45] apart. What is it? That's all the
[1:23:47] groaning of the world
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; because the because we are the only ones
[1:23:52] with us here on this earth. This earth
[1:23:55] still continues to survive. But watch
[1:23:58] when the Holy Ghost takes the sons of
[1:24:02] God and lifts off of this earth. You
[1:24:05] watch the chaos that comes into this
[1:24:07] earth.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Do you know that it's because we're here
[1:24:09] that this earth is still intact? Amen.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; It's the only reason why things are
[1:24:14] still intact here on earth is because
[1:24:16] the sons of God have not come into full
[1:24:19] manifestation yet.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're coming into manifestation.
[1:24:25] We are predestinated unto the adoption
[1:24:28] of sons. Amen. A lot of people, they'll
[1:24:31] read about the adoption. They'll talk
[1:24:33] about the adoption. They'll listen to
[1:24:35] the tapes on adoption, but they don't
[1:24:37] recognize that it's an adoption unto
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; sons of God. Amen. Praise God.
[1:24:44] Hallelujah. So, he says here in the last
[1:24:46] days with the power of the Holy Ghost at
[1:24:49] the end of the age to reveal the secret
[1:24:53] things from the foundations of the world
[1:24:56] to bring it up. Now, let's go back into
[1:24:58] the foundation of the world again to get
[1:25:00] a revelation to see if we're right or
[1:25:03] not. You see, brother Brandham, he was
[1:25:06] he was recognizing that all of our
[1:25:09] positioning, all of our salvation, all
[1:25:12] of our healing, if if if if there was
[1:25:15] ever going to be anything saved, there
[1:25:17] would have to be a savior and there
[1:25:19] would have to be something to save.
[1:25:22] Everything was back in the before the
[1:25:24] foundations of the world. And brother
[1:25:26] Brandham was seeing the clarity of that
[1:25:30] because there were sons of God before
[1:25:33] the foundations of the world.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a there's a difference
[1:25:38] between sons of God and the angels. God
[1:25:41] created the angels.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Those angels were created to worship him
[1:25:46] and that's why he could be called God.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; But it was sons that were actually a
[1:25:52] manifestation of himself.
[1:25:55] Amen. And brother Brandham saw this. He
[1:25:59] saw that this element had to come in the
[1:26:02] last days. Amen. Where the where the
[1:26:05] sons of God would manifest the word to
[1:26:08] produce this rapture, this change that
[1:26:13] we are now in the midst of.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. So he goes on here.
[1:26:18] Let's go to the next slide here. In
[1:26:20] adopt in adoption, he says, what did he
[1:26:23] do? He by fornowledge foresaw us knowing
[1:26:28] that he was a savior, self-existent.
[1:26:31] There was no angels, no nothing, just
[1:26:34] God, Ella Elohim, the self-existent one.
[1:26:37] Nothing but him alone.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; But in him was a savior.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, what's he going to
[1:26:46] save? There's nothing lost. Knowing
[1:26:48] that, then he knowed that this great
[1:26:51] attribute in him would project something
[1:26:55] out yonder that he could save.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; And that's why the logust in the
[1:27:00] beginning was the word. The word was
[1:27:01] with God and the word was God. When the
[1:27:03] logust went forth, it was Jesus Christ
[1:27:07] in the image of God, a son of God, in
[1:27:12] the image of God to create and to bring
[1:27:16] the first manifestation
[1:27:18] of a son of God.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. One unto like his glorious body.
[1:27:24] That's what we're in the process of.
[1:27:28] Amen. So he knowed that that that great
[1:27:31] attribute in him would project something
[1:27:33] out yonder he would save. Then when it
[1:27:36] did that by fornowledge he looked down
[1:27:38] and he saw everyone that would accept
[1:27:41] it.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; He saw that you would be in this day and
[1:27:44] in this age.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; He saw that you would have that
[1:27:48] attribute that he sent forth.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; That attribute happened to land in you.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; But it didn't have to land in you. It
[1:27:56] could have landed anywhere else. But it
[1:27:57] landed in you.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; And and because it landed in you, when
[1:28:01] the word is spoken, that's why you don't
[1:28:04] know where the seed is. You he he
[1:28:07] scattered the seed. Some fell on good
[1:28:08] ground. Some fell on on on stony ground.
[1:28:12] Amen. But but there was there was some
[1:28:15] that when the when the word receives the
[1:28:18] when when that seed receives the word
[1:28:20] for their day and they are that
[1:28:23] attribute that he that he saw in his
[1:28:25] mind. He he saw that in his mind that
[1:28:28] those attributes were going to go out
[1:28:30] there like a like a like a a cluster of
[1:28:33] attributes in in this in this age.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; And you you you had to come to this
[1:28:39] revelation. You you had to unite with
[1:28:42] what we had to unite. I had to come
[1:28:44] under this leadership.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; There was nothing that could stop it. I
[1:28:48] didn't understand why I was pulled
[1:28:50] there. But something Gabriel had
[1:28:52] something the Lord had placed within
[1:28:55] him, a word that had to BE SPOKEN THAT
[1:28:58] BROUGHT life and and watered the seed,
[1:29:00] the attribute that was in me and it
[1:29:02] brought it to life
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; all of a sudden as without understanding
[1:29:07] being pulled to the word of God. What is
[1:29:10] it? It's attributes of God coming into
[1:29:12] manifestation in order to produce the
[1:29:15] word for our day.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; That's why you can't how can you dis how
[1:29:22] can you just say oh I can just listen to
[1:29:23] the tapes. You need the you need Christ.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; YOU NEED CHRIST HIMSELF TO SPEAK to you.
[1:29:30] You need his word to come directly
[1:29:33] purposed into your heart as an attribute
[1:29:35] of God to bring you into manifestation
[1:29:38] in your day. Otherwise, you're just a
[1:29:40] churchgoer.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; You're just like anybody else. Amen.
[1:29:44] Glory to God. Go on. Now, he says the
[1:29:46] next slide. He says, "Then he came down
[1:29:48] and he taken upon himself. And while he
[1:29:51] did that, he did that he might save you
[1:29:54] who wants to be saved."
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; You had a desire. Listen, don't try to
[1:30:00] explain it. I was in a condition, all I
[1:30:03] know is I I was in a condition where
[1:30:05] where Satan had me bound by drugs, but I
[1:30:09] wanted to be delivered.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; I wanted to be delivered. And and I knew
[1:30:15] that I couldn't do it on my own. God
[1:30:17] places certain, you know,
[1:30:20] characteristics and certain conditions
[1:30:22] in your life.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; You look at the situations and the
[1:30:26] circumstances that you're that you're
[1:30:27] in. You need to be in them.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; THE ATTRIBUTE THAT GOD SENT to you
[1:30:34] has a purpose to overcome those
[1:30:36] circumstances.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; OTHERWISE, HE WOULD NOT HAVE SENT IT TO
[1:30:40] YOU.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; He He needed to send it to you so that
[1:30:44] you could know and want the word to
[1:30:48] deliver you.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; you you you didn't know what you needed.
[1:30:53] YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND what you needed,
[1:30:55] but you knew that you needed salvation.
[1:30:57] You knew that you needed deliverance.
[1:30:59] You didn't. But then when the
[1:31:01] deliverance came, then he drops a
[1:31:03] revelation on you and says, "You are a
[1:31:05] son."
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Glory to God. What?
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; I'm a son." Yes. You and I've given you
[1:31:11] eyes to see. And then all of a sudden,
[1:31:13] you start reading. You start listening
[1:31:15] to the prophet. You start reading the
[1:31:17] books. And all of a sudden, the the the
[1:31:19] word is just coming to life. You're you
[1:31:22] go to church and you know you the
[1:31:24] preacher's preaching and it's just
[1:31:26] burning within your heart. You can't
[1:31:27] understand what it is. What is it? It's
[1:31:30] the manifestation of a son of God.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; It's an attribute coming into its
[1:31:36] maturity.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; You can't stop it. It's going to happen.
[1:31:40] It's going to it's going to transform
[1:31:42] you. It's going to it's going to
[1:31:43] translate you from this dimension into
[1:31:45] that other dimension. Hallelujah. Glory
[1:31:48] to God. And he goes on now he says here,
[1:31:50] do you see what I mean? By forn
[1:31:52] knowledge the infinite God who knowed
[1:31:55] all things saw the lamb
[1:31:58] and he slayed the lamb when before the
[1:32:01] foundations of the world. Oh, glory to
[1:32:04] God. I'll tell you, John was just having
[1:32:07] one great big party. Hallelujah. in in
[1:32:11] in chapter five, he goes from from from
[1:32:15] who's who who's worthy to loose the
[1:32:18] seals, WHO'S WORTHY TO OPEN THE BOOK
[1:32:21] BECAUSE THERE'S A MYSTERY in there that
[1:32:23] that that he knows that he's he's in
[1:32:25] desperation that he needs to understand.
[1:32:28] But here now, here's that that lamb that
[1:32:32] that that he saw a lamb. He slayed the
[1:32:35] lamb before the foundation of the world
[1:32:37] and he put your name on the lamb's book
[1:32:39] of life. Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen.
[1:32:43] Listen, I'm telling you, John got
[1:32:45] excited when he saw the lamb step out
[1:32:48] from the throne.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; He knew that the mystery of his name
[1:32:53] being in that book was now going to be
[1:32:55] released.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. You didn't
[1:32:58] understand what was going on. That's why
[1:33:00] I'm saying you're you're just you're
[1:33:02] just coming to church. You can't you you
[1:33:05] don't you can't go anywhere else. You
[1:33:07] try to go to another church and it's
[1:33:09] dry. YOU CAN'T HEAR NOTHING.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; You you you turn the station on and and
[1:33:15] they're TALKING ABOUT JESUS. THEY'RE
[1:33:16] ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT JESUS, BUT YET
[1:33:18] THERE'S NO REVELATION COMING OUT OF THE
[1:33:20] TEACHING.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; WHY? Because your name was written under
[1:33:26] this mystery.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE MYSTERY.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; This is what calls you. This is what
[1:33:33] brings you into manifestation as a son
[1:33:36] of God. There's no mystery there.
[1:33:38] There's no revelation there. How you
[1:33:41] going to be called?
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. He goes on here and he
[1:33:48] says, he says, next slide.
[1:33:53] And he and he's seen the deceitfulness
[1:33:55] of Satan. Amen. Of this age. That's why
[1:33:59] it's so deceiving. And now that
[1:34:01] deception has come right up into the
[1:34:03] message. So, so you know, keep your
[1:34:05] thinking cap on here. All right? Because
[1:34:08] this is the end. This is where that's
[1:34:11] why he saved this to the end. Amen.
[1:34:14] Because the deception would be so
[1:34:16] deceiving that it would deceive the very
[1:34:17] elect if it were possible. But listen
[1:34:19] what he says. And he's seen the
[1:34:20] deceitfulness of Satan what he would do.
[1:34:23] So he put your name on there and he said
[1:34:26] that the antichrist would be so
[1:34:30] religious.
[1:34:32] Oh boy.
[1:34:34] So good.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Such a fine fellow. Amen. Such a smart
[1:34:38] man, such a religious man that he would
[1:34:41] deceive the very elect if IT WAS
[1:34:44] POSSIBLE.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; OH my goodness. Hallelujah.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But it is impossible.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE YOUR NAME IS WRITTEN UNDER
[1:34:57] THAT MYSTERY.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE MYSTERY THAT PAUL'S TALKING
[1:35:01] ABOUT. THAT'S THE FELLOWSHIP that that
[1:35:03] that that we're fellowshipping on here
[1:35:05] this morning. THAT'S WHAT'S BROUGHT YOU
[1:35:07] INTO LIFE.
[1:35:09] GLORY TO GOD. IT'S WHAT GIVES YOU
[1:35:10] CONFIDENCE and courage TO TO PRESS ON
[1:35:13] and to believe this word and to and to
[1:35:16] keep pressing THE BATTLE. AMEN.
[1:35:18] REGARDLESS of the battle, don't worry.
[1:35:20] The attribute in you will overcome.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Impossible. Because their names were for
[1:35:29] ordained before the foundation of the
[1:35:32] world. By election he chose them. And by
[1:35:35] predestination they know where they are
[1:35:39] going.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; There you are. THAT'S YOU.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; THAT'S YOU. That's you that he's talking
[1:35:47] about. There you are. Amen. Glory to
[1:35:49] God. BECAUSE YOU HAD THAT mystery
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; placed within you before the foundations
[1:35:56] of the world. Amen. There's no devil in
[1:35:58] hell that's going to take that out of
[1:36:00] you. Listen, let's read the next
[1:36:02] scripture here in in uh Hebrews 11:es 1
[1:36:06] to4. He says, "God who at sundry times
[1:36:09] and in diverse manner spake in times
[1:36:11] past unto the fathers by the prophets
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; hath in these last days spoken unto unto
[1:36:19] us by his son."
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:24] He's still speaking, saints.
[1:36:26] He's still anointing
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; the five-fold ministry to speak his
[1:36:31] word. Amen.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Who hath appointed heir
[1:36:36] appointed heir of all things by the by
[1:36:39] whom also he made the worlds. Glory to
[1:36:41] God. There it is again.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just like we read in
[1:36:45] Ephesians 3:9. And to make all men see
[1:36:48] what is the fellowship of the mystery
[1:36:50] which was from the beginning of the
[1:36:52] world hid IN GOD.
[1:36:55] WHO CREATED ALL THINGS by who? Jesus
[1:36:58] Christ. And what does the scripture say
[1:37:00] here? He says, "By whom also he made the
[1:37:03] worlds."
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; So if he made the worlds, then he is the
[1:37:08] self-existent one. You see? You see how
[1:37:10] all of a sudden there's no such thing as
[1:37:12] a trinity?
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; You see, that's the mystery. That's the
[1:37:16] mystery of God. They don't realize
[1:37:19] that's that's the very mystery of God
[1:37:21] that that he he didn't he he he he could
[1:37:24] express himself in attribute form and
[1:37:27] yet he could have many attributes but
[1:37:30] yet still be one.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See who being the
[1:37:36] brightness. Now let's go on. Who be
[1:37:38] being the brightness of his glory and
[1:37:41] the express image of his person.
[1:37:45] He's ex showing here that Jesus Christ
[1:37:48] was the expressed image of God and
[1:37:51] upholding all things by the word of his
[1:37:54] power. [snorts]
[1:37:56] Okay? Not by your own power, not by your
[1:37:59] own ability, not by I'm going to speak
[1:38:01] the word. No, no, no. You need to speak
[1:38:03] the word that's anointed by him speaking
[1:38:06] through you.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; That's the anointed word. That's
[1:38:10] understanding that you are a son of God.
[1:38:13] Amen. Praise God. That has the authority
[1:38:17] as a son of God. Amen.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. THIS THIS AUTHORITY,
[1:38:21] SAINTS, like we need to see what what
[1:38:23] what what he's placed in our hands.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; We need to understand the you know the
[1:38:28] the the importance of this revelation
[1:38:30] that he's giving us as sons of God in
[1:38:33] this hour having this fellowship around
[1:38:35] the mystery.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; It puts us into full authority.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; It'll change the way you approach
[1:38:41] somebody that needs prayer. AMEN.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; COME ON, SAINTS.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT YOU
[1:38:48] KNOW IT CHANGES EVERYTHING.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; You lay hands ON THE SICK, YOU KNOW THAT
[1:38:53] THEY SHALL RECOVER.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BUT NOT NOT NOT BECAUSE
[1:38:57] YOU'RE making them recover because the
[1:38:59] word said
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; and YOU ARE A REPRESENTATION of the
[1:39:03] word.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. He says here
[1:39:08] upholding all things by the power of his
[1:39:10] word. and he had by himself purged all
[1:39:14] our sins. So listen, once you're in him,
[1:39:19] don't let the devil lie to you and bring
[1:39:21] back your past and bring back you
[1:39:23] remember this, you remember that. You
[1:39:26] remind him where he's going.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; That's what you need to do. Just remind
[1:39:30] him, Satan, you're going to the lake of
[1:39:32] fire pretty soon.
[1:39:35] [laughter]
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory. You're going to be
[1:39:38] bound up for a thousand years. I'm going
[1:39:40] to get to watch you bound up for a
[1:39:41] thousand years. Amen. If you're a son of
[1:39:44] God, you don't fear that devil.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; You have nothing to fear as a son of
[1:39:49] God. Amen. Glory to God. When he by
[1:39:52] purged our sins, sat down at the right
[1:39:55] hand of the majesty on high. Now listen,
[1:39:58] this is Paul displaying and telling us
[1:40:02] what a son is.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. that a son sat down
[1:40:08] on the right hand of the majesty on
[1:40:10] high. Listen, the lamb when he took the
[1:40:14] book out of out of from out of the one
[1:40:16] that was in the throne, that was he
[1:40:18] himself
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; stepping out of the throne
[1:40:23] because there was you go back and read
[1:40:25] chapter 4 of Revelation, he says there
[1:40:27] was one that sat on the throne
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; and then all of a SUDDEN A LAMB STEPS
[1:40:32] out from the throne. one who had been
[1:40:34] slain from the foundation of the what
[1:40:36] what God's just expressing his plan.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; He was he was showing TO JOHN EXACTLY
[1:40:43] WHAT was going to take place. Amen.
[1:40:45] Glory to God. But but here Peter, he
[1:40:48] didn't understand that this time and
[1:40:52] season would have to come. He all he
[1:40:55] could see was what God was revealing to
[1:40:57] him that that that that we would be
[1:40:58] seated at the right hand of the majesty
[1:41:00] on high being made so much better than
[1:41:03] the angels. You remember God created the
[1:41:06] angels first. Angels cannot be sons.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Angels have a beginning. They're going
[1:41:14] to have an end. Sons are are expressed
[1:41:17] from God.
[1:41:19] So we have we have a a an existence so
[1:41:24] much higher. He says so much better than
[1:41:26] the angels as he hath an by inheritance
[1:41:30] obtained a more excellent name than
[1:41:34] they. What is that name?
[1:41:37] Sons of God.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Sons of God. They were angels. That was
[1:41:42] their name. But you're not an angel.
[1:41:45] You're a son of God.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen.
[1:41:50] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Oh, a son is
[1:41:54] someone who the father can speak by.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what Paul is trying to
[1:41:58] explain to us here. He's trying to show
[1:42:00] us true sunship, heir of all things that
[1:42:05] the father owns. All things.
[1:42:08] The brightness of his glory. What is the
[1:42:10] brightness of his glory? What what what
[1:42:14] is the brightness of his glory? The
[1:42:17] brightness of his glory is his
[1:42:18] theophony.
[1:42:20] That's what the brightness of his glory
[1:42:22] is. That that's how we are going to be
[1:42:24] expressed. That's when we go into full
[1:42:27] sunship, we connect with our theophony.
[1:42:30] And we have a a a we have a a a glorious
[1:42:33] body. This corruption must put on
[1:42:36] incorruption. Amen. A body like unto his
[1:42:40] glorious body. Amen. Glory to God. So,
[1:42:43] so what this revelation of sunship is is
[1:42:47] a revelation that you've got a theophony
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; that you've got a body that's that if
[1:42:52] this earthly tabernacle be dissolved,
[1:42:54] you have another one waiting.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; And yet, you're you're you're already
[1:42:58] dissolving.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Little by little, YOU ARE DISSOLVING.
[1:43:02] YOU'RE DYING OUT to your own
[1:43:03] interpretation of the word of God.
[1:43:05] You're dying out to your own ideas, and
[1:43:07] you're taking on the full word of God.
[1:43:11] She hath made herself ready. Amen. Glory
[1:43:14] to God. Sons reveal the father. And what
[1:43:18] is the father? It's the nature of God.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; It's his nature, his authority,
[1:43:26] his strength, his ability, not your
[1:43:29] ability. As a son, YOU CAN EXPRESS HIS
[1:43:33] ABILITY. AMEN. you you're able to uphold
[1:43:36] all the challenges that come your way by
[1:43:39] the power of his word in you.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. We're winding it
[1:43:44] down here.
[1:43:47] Sat down at the right hand. He is equal
[1:43:50] to the power of God. Has the authority.
[1:43:53] Listen to him that overcomemeth.
[1:43:55] Remember what it said in Revelations 3
[1:43:57] 21. Let me read it to you from verse 20
[1:44:01] because this is the hour that we're
[1:44:03] living in right now. He's outside of the
[1:44:06] church door right now. Did you know
[1:44:07] that?
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; And he's still knocking.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; He's knocking. He says here, "Behold, I
[1:44:13] stand at the door and knock. And if any
[1:44:15] man hear my voice and open the door, I
[1:44:18] will come into him and will s with him
[1:44:21] and he with me."
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You know, people want to
[1:44:26] put this in the in the seventh church
[1:44:28] age. They just want to place it there.
[1:44:31] He's still knocking
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; because there's people that are outside
[1:44:36] that that that that are that are not
[1:44:38] letting him in. They're they all they
[1:44:40] want to do is just nope. We just go to
[1:44:43] listen to the tapes. That's all we do.
[1:44:45] We just we don't want we don't we don't
[1:44:46] need any uh you know authority. People
[1:44:49] that that only say I only listen to
[1:44:52] tapes, you know what they're saying? I
[1:44:54] do not come subject to a pastor.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's the truth.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; That's what they're saying. I'm not
[1:45:01] coming subject to a pastor.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; I'll pay my tithes to brother Brandham
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; and they'll send their tithes to Voice
[1:45:08] of God. And I'm not saying that that
[1:45:10] Listen, if they've got a revelation of
[1:45:13] Brother Joseph as their pastor,
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; fine. That's their business. Praise God.
[1:45:19] Let them pay their ties. I got nothing
[1:45:21] against any of that. But what but what
[1:45:25] is it that a person who doesn't want to
[1:45:29] belong to a church doesn't want to be
[1:45:34] you know exposed
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; and and and and be a part of a body
[1:45:39] because now they got to come under
[1:45:41] subjection.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; They don't realize the person that
[1:45:45] they're they're they're rebelling and
[1:45:48] not coming under subjection to is not
[1:45:50] the pastor.
[1:45:52] It's Christ the word
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; in the present stage of his ministry.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; That's what they don't want. They don't
[1:45:59] want the word to correct their lives.
[1:46:01] They don't want the word to tell them
[1:46:03] that they need a pastor. Even the
[1:46:04] prophet said you you stay with your
[1:46:07] pastor.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; He even said it. He says he'll take you
[1:46:10] through. Amen. You need a revelation on
[1:46:13] that. But listen, you can't give people
[1:46:15] revelation. You just have to let them in
[1:46:17] their own time and season come. So he's
[1:46:20] still knocking. But to him that
[1:46:22] overcomemeth,
[1:46:24] this hour, the deception of this hour, I
[1:46:27] will grant to sit with me in my throne.
[1:46:30] How can you be in the throne unless you
[1:46:33] are in Christ?
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As as and he goes here, even
[1:46:43] as I overcame.
[1:46:47] Remember Jesus came to show us the way
[1:46:51] back.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; He came to display himself. Amen. He
[1:46:57] that hath an ear, let him hear. He says,
[1:47:00] he says, even as I overcame and am set
[1:47:02] down with my father in his throne, he
[1:47:05] that hath an ear, let him hear what the
[1:47:07] spirit saith unto the churches. Amen.
[1:47:10] Praise God. This is our inheritance.
[1:47:14] Glory to God. We become the mystery of
[1:47:17] God. Let the musicians come. Amen. We
[1:47:20] are listen a more excellent name than
[1:47:23] the angels. Why? Because he God became
[1:47:26] man.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is his original plan that God
[1:47:31] could be man so that man could be God.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sons of God. What is greater
[1:47:38] than the angels? The sons of God. Amen.
[1:47:43] The sons of God are coming out of their
[1:47:45] spiritual amnesia.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. The church forgot that we are the
[1:47:50] express
[1:47:51] that we are to express Christ.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; That's you know that's people just go to
[1:47:57] church out of tradition. They don't
[1:47:59] realize that their purpose in in in
[1:48:01] being a Christian is to express Jesus
[1:48:04] Christ to this generation. Amen. So by
[1:48:08] Jesus Christ the word for our day. He
[1:48:10] awakens us and he awakens others through
[1:48:14] you and me as we live and manifest this
[1:48:18] word. Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:48:23] I'll just read this last quote here from
[1:48:24] spiritual amnesia.
[1:48:28] [snorts]
[1:48:30] He says, "They think just because I
[1:48:32] belong to church that's all that is
[1:48:34] necessary. Oh brother, that means no
[1:48:37] more to God than to be a mason or
[1:48:39] anything else." any other lodge to
[1:48:41] belong to church. That don't mean
[1:48:43] nothing to God. You've got to be sons
[1:48:46] and daughters of God. You've got to be
[1:48:49] born of God. And God is the word. And
[1:48:53] when I become a part of my father, I
[1:48:56] become all my I become all my father.
[1:49:00] Hallelujah. Did you hear that? I become
[1:49:02] all my father. When you become a part of
[1:49:04] God, you become God in full.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. his whole word. You believe it all
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; spiritual amnesia. He says you come out
[1:49:15] of your spiritual amnesia.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; I'm going to stop right there. There's
[1:49:20] more, but we'll continue the next time
[1:49:22] that we come together. And I just want
[1:49:25] to remind you that next weekend I'll be
[1:49:28] ministering at brother Isaiah Brooks in
[1:49:31] Iowa. Okay? and you're going to have the
[1:49:35] wonderful treat of our former pastor,
[1:49:38] John [music] Simon, to minister the word
[1:49:40] of God.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; And I believe you're going to be
[1:49:43] immensely blessed. So you you be praying
[1:49:46] all week. You be praying for for my
[1:49:48] meetings. Amen. And you be praying
[1:49:51] [music] for brother John who's going to
[1:49:53] minister the word of God to us. Amen.
[1:49:55] And you're going to be immensely
[1:49:57] blessed. Invite your friends. Invite
[1:49:59] [music] your family. Amen. Let them come
[1:50:01] and rejoice around the word of God
[1:50:03] because we are under the mystery of this
[1:50:07] tremendous this fellowship of this

[1:53:22] of God have chosen their side. And the

[1:58:13] we're going to assemble back in half an

[1:58:18] meeting, our general business meeting.
[1:58:20] Um it's it shouldn't be starchy and
[1:58:23] cold. Why? Because [music] it's his
[1:58:24] business we're talking about. Amen. It's
[1:58:27] his business, friends. It's not just
[1:58:30] numbers and this and that. It's his
[1:58:32] [music] business. Are you interested in
[1:58:33] his business? His business is beyond
[1:58:36] anything. All right. God bless you as we
[1:58:39] go. We are the sons of God.
