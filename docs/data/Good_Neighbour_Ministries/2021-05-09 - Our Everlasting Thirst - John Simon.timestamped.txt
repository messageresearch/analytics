[3:22] and i will briefly
[3:25] just express the thoughts about
[3:27] motherhood
[3:28] uh or mothers but at the same time
[3:32] uh i will not swerve
[3:35] in any direction away
[3:39] from the thoughts that i have to preach
[3:41] today
[3:44] and so i will just minister
[3:47] as normal but i do recognize
[3:51] mother's day i want to say to you
[3:55] that it's a wonderful and marvelous
[3:57] thing
[3:58] for anyone to have a
[4:01] a mother that cares about them
[4:06] watches over them and
[4:09] makes sure all is well with them
[4:13] and do you know that even after we have
[4:16] grown up
[4:17] our mothers still look upon us as if we
[4:20] have it
[4:20] we are still their children i thank god
[4:24] for a a godly mother
[4:28] that raised me watched over me and
[4:31] pointed me to the way of the lord
[4:35] god rest her soul she's with the lord
[4:39] she's went on from new york
[4:43] into the presence of almighty god
[4:46] and i thank god for her my friends
[4:50] there is no there is no price given
[4:55] for a mother a grandmother
[4:58] a sister a friend
[5:02] a wife that's good
[5:06] filled with great love and dignity
[5:11] christian modesty christ-like
[5:14] spirit the character
[5:18] of real womanhood i thank
[5:21] god for women who accept the
[5:25] challenge to live like that in this
[5:28] ungodly
[5:30] wicked and perverted age
[5:34] where women are belittle
[5:37] despised where
[5:41] women are sometimes rated second
[5:44] class but in god's book
[5:47] he doesn't put them there god tells you
[5:51] clearly
[5:53] that the she is to be a help
[5:56] meet or a mate and we
[5:59] thank god for them the
[6:03] book of proverbs tells us clearly
[6:06] that her the value the true
[6:09] value of a woman for many men
[6:13] don't know how to value their
[6:16] wives their daughters
[6:20] oh or any female for that matter
[6:23] they have no sense of value for them
[6:27] not realizing of course
[6:31] that a good woman or price the bible
[6:34] says is
[6:35] far above rubies in other words her
[6:38] value
[6:39] she is priceless if she has the
[6:42] character she has the the way
[6:46] of being a help
[6:49] meet or mate as god's word says
[6:53] and if the man responds in kind
[6:57] and together they can walk life's road
[7:01] together from
[7:02] use to old age might i say may i say
[7:07] that's my wife and i at this particular
[7:09] time
[7:11] oh i thank god for her i thank god
[7:15] for this grand wonderful uh
[7:19] mother of my children and i give glory
[7:22] to god
[7:23] for giving her to me and i pray that
[7:26] every man within the sound of my voice
[7:32] or watching this broadcast
[7:35] will come to think of the value
[7:39] we place upon our wives
[7:44] we are called by the holy spirit who is
[7:47] himself a gentleman
[7:49] to be gentleman to be like jesus
[7:55] do you hear what i said to be a
[7:57] gentleman
[7:58] or a gentle man that means to be a man
[8:03] but at the same time to be gentle
[8:07] so there's time a man must be formed and
[8:10] be able to say
[8:10] no but at other times he must
[8:14] recognize when his wife
[8:17] placed there by god to be his help mate
[8:20] may give him
[8:21] some good advice or say something that's
[8:24] right
[8:26] or give him some sense of direction
[8:29] i'm not talking about domination control
[8:32] influence
[8:33] i'm talking about just as a a loving
[8:37] um cooperative wife
[8:40] walking working along with her husband
[8:44] what just talked to him and sometimes
[8:48] men's pride get in the way and they want
[8:51] to rail up but
[8:52] but a real man even if at first he does
[8:54] that he'll come right back and say you
[8:56] know i'm sorry i was wrong i shouldn't
[8:58] have done that
[8:59] you were right to begin with and and and
[9:02] things like that but we've got to
[9:03] understand brother sister
[9:06] the value of a real woman
[9:09] a bad woman the bible says is like water
[9:12] in your blood
[9:13] it'll weaken you weaken your efforts
[9:16] weaken everything you're trying to
[9:17] accomplish
[9:19] but if god has given you one
[9:23] then i tell you brother work with her
[9:25] and let her work with you
[9:28] and together you can work together
[9:31] and lay the foundations
[9:34] of a marvelous and wonderful
[9:37] family future and leave
[9:42] a legacy behind
[9:46] one that may not be just financial
[9:50] maybe one of finance
[9:54] and faith faith being the foremost thing
[9:59] but whatever it is you leave your
[10:03] children with the indelible
[10:05] imprint of them being
[10:08] molded into the image of jesus christ
[10:13] the son of god the flesh that god lived
[10:17] in
[10:18] may the holy spirit bless these
[10:21] few thoughts to your heart today
[10:24] please take them to your heart and
[10:26] accept my
[10:27] greetings to my dear precious
[10:31] sisters everywhere

[10:37] america

[10:48] one and all glory to god god bless you
[10:53] happy mother's day god bless you
[10:59] our topic for today
[11:05] our everlasting thirst
[11:09] our everlasting thirst for you know
[11:14] that our thirst cannot be
[11:18] eternal for when we
[11:21] get back into the presence of god
[11:25] then we can search no more for
[11:28] now we are living a life of complete
[11:31] total satisfaction all our joys will be
[11:35] full
[11:36] and all the glories that we imagined
[11:39] within our hearts
[11:40] and above that which we think or even
[11:43] imagine or desire
[11:45] it will have become into reality
[11:48] and we will be satisfied let us read our
[11:51] scripture
[11:55] as the heart painted
[11:58] after the water brooks so
[12:01] panthet my soul after thee
[12:05] oh god my soul
[12:08] searched that for god for the
[12:11] living god when shall i
[12:15] come and appear before god
[12:19] hallelujah praise his marvelous
[12:23] and wonderful name
[12:26] my friends i want to
[12:31] look over in the book of joshua
[12:35] chapter 2. and there
[12:40] we find a beautiful
[12:43] young woman by the name of rahab
[12:49] now the story of rahab can be found as
[12:52] i've said
[12:52] in joshua chapter 2.
[12:57] and i'm going to speak about her
[13:01] briefly because it ties
[13:04] in with the fact that man
[13:08] was made with a thirst within his heart
[13:12] for god and the devil changed that
[13:16] into having a thirst in his heart for
[13:19] god's
[13:20] and changed it worked it twisted it
[13:25] and brought it to the place where
[13:28] his taste and his tears have become so
[13:31] twisted
[13:32] warped in every way that he longs
[13:36] lust and thirsts after many things
[13:40] that he should have no thirst for no
[13:43] desire for
[13:46] no attraction to but because of the
[13:51] magnetizing power of the temptation of
[13:54] the temptations of
[13:55] satan men are drawn
[13:59] to these evil traps that the devil
[14:03] has set
[14:06] now in our day of course we find
[14:11] that these traps have multiplied
[14:15] and they're all around us everywhere
[14:20] now this rahab of whom we speak
[14:24] she of course received the spies
[14:28] that were sent out ahead of the churn of
[14:32] israel
[14:33] to spy out the land of canaan
[14:38] and to go into the
[14:41] city of jericho
[14:45] and others and to spy out the strength
[14:48] and weaknesses of the land
[14:52] in this case there were trapped within a
[14:56] city
[14:57] where the gates were closed and
[15:01] a search was on for the spies
[15:06] and there was rahab
[15:10] according to the bible she was a harlot
[15:14] and to find young full-blooded
[15:18] men entering into her house
[15:23] the bible says she took them to her
[15:26] house
[15:27] and the bible tells us she hid them
[15:30] covered them up and hid them from the
[15:33] king
[15:34] and his soldiers when they came to
[15:37] search for these
[15:39] israelite spies
[15:43] and they were kept there
[15:47] safely and when the soldiers were
[15:49] finished searching
[15:51] and were gone she kept them in her home
[15:55] until it was night
[16:00] but you see she lived on the wall
[16:04] of the city so through her window
[16:09] below was outside of the city
[16:13] so when it got dark enough
[16:16] the bible tells us that she got
[16:20] whether a basket or a rope or something
[16:23] and was able to let them down
[16:27] outside of the wall so that they could
[16:30] return
[16:31] to joshua and
[16:34] report to him what they had seen and
[16:37] heard
[16:38] but before they left her house
[16:42] they made her a promise
[16:45] that you've been good to us
[16:48] and we're coming back and we know
[16:51] that we this city will be destroyed
[16:55] for the lord god has said we are to
[16:57] destroy the city
[16:59] but because of what you have done
[17:03] if you will place a scarlet
[17:07] colored cord in your window
[17:13] right remembering our house is on the
[17:17] wall of the city and the scarlet
[17:21] card in that window would be
[17:25] highly visible i'm sure she had
[17:28] one on the outside window on the outside
[17:32] of the wall
[17:33] and i believe she had another one on the
[17:37] inside wall of the city
[17:41] for after they breached the city and
[17:43] they are on the inside
[17:44] they may not recognize that it's the
[17:46] same house
[17:48] so here she was with the scarlet
[17:52] cord and the bible says she
[17:55] gathered all her family into
[17:59] that house now i will not dwell on the
[18:02] fact that here we are
[18:04] that the harlot whom they might have
[18:06] looked down
[18:07] upon whom they have cast aside whom they
[18:11] spurned she would be the very
[18:14] person that would be the savior of our
[18:17] entire family
[18:19] of course the scarlet cord was a sign
[18:23] and
[18:23] symbol of the coming blood of christ
[18:27] that would save a world
[18:31] caught up in harlotry with satan
[18:34] dancing with satan living with satan
[18:37] moving with satan
[18:39] in every way but if a seed
[18:42] is buried in there and it catches the
[18:45] revelation of the word
[18:47] it will hold to the scarlet cord of the
[18:50] blood of jesus christ
[18:52] and change to from harlotry
[18:55] to being one of his own oh glory to
[18:59] god blessed be his holy name
[19:03] my friends today we are deduces the same
[19:06] thing
[19:08] this word which is spurned
[19:11] this revelation of this
[19:14] word of god that's open
[19:17] book that's been given to us that's
[19:21] being spurned in every
[19:22] quarter has come to you
[19:26] and is coming to you right now come to
[19:29] your house
[19:30] will you let him him will you give him
[19:34] a hiding place will you
[19:37] let him hide behind your skin
[19:40] would you let him live within your heart
[19:44] would you let the holy spirit so use you
[19:47] that you will change and be a blessing
[19:50] to the entire world and your family and
[19:54] friends
[19:55] and everyone that is around you for
[19:58] today it's not the scarlet cord
[20:00] in the window but uh the blood of jesus
[20:03] christ which is the holy spirit
[20:06] within your heart making himself
[20:09] visible by the character and the life
[20:13] that you're
[20:14] living that becomes expressed to the
[20:17] people
[20:18] so they can recognize it that
[20:22] you the old you doesn't live in that
[20:25] house or in this body anymore
[20:27] but jesus christ has come in to
[20:30] take up his abode and now
[20:34] you are a new person in jesus
[20:37] christ washed by his precious blood
[20:40] amen praise god the life
[20:44] is in the blood so that scarlet cord
[20:49] represented the life of christ
[20:53] that was coming that would become
[20:56] manifest in the life of the believers
[21:01] so that people can see your salvation
[21:04] when it works itself outside when it
[21:07] works out praise god hallelujah
[21:10] so we have a salvation not on our lips
[21:14] not on our tongues
[21:15] not just like that but we have a
[21:18] salvation that we are living
[21:20] we are expressing and we are manifesting
[21:24] for he has come into us to take up his
[21:27] abode
[21:29] now this rehab with this horrible
[21:33] terrible background
[21:37] she was saved and her family
[21:40] was saved no matter what the world
[21:43] thinks about you
[21:45] whoever you are wherever you come from
[21:49] i tell you today in the name of jesus
[21:53] christ
[21:55] that the holy spirit can take your
[21:58] life rich or poor higher
[22:01] low whatever your standard your status
[22:04] is
[22:05] the great holy spirit can take your life
[22:09] and cause you to be the one
[22:12] that will lead your family to jesus
[22:16] christ
[22:17] oh praise god i don't mean you'll harass
[22:20] them you harangue them you'll be pushing
[22:22] all kinds of stuff at them
[22:24] but i'm saying with the life that you
[22:27] live
[22:27] full of love full of the his nature
[22:30] full of his character and you won't have
[22:33] to put it on
[22:35] because it it's living in you
[22:38] and it begins to live itself out of you
[22:41] unconscious godliness you don't even
[22:44] have to think about it
[22:46] not being like uh the old form
[22:49] of them thinking how christianity was oh
[22:52] i've got to be a christian
[22:53] therefore i've got to keep my temper i
[22:56] need to be a christian
[22:57] therefore i need to do this and this and
[23:00] this and that
[23:01] that is you trying to live the life of
[23:04] christ
[23:05] but if you would allow jesus to come in
[23:09] and to take full control of your life
[23:13] he will live in you and he will
[23:16] live his own life through you
[23:20] then you will rest you will come to a
[23:24] place of rest
[23:25] and realize not i but christ
[23:29] that liveth in me he do at the works he
[23:32] is the one that's living
[23:33] he is the one that's manifesting he is
[23:36] the one that's declaring himself
[23:38] and then my friends the pressure
[23:42] you let off the pressure from your life
[23:45] you let off the pressure from the people
[23:48] around you
[23:49] because the first form of christianity
[23:52] you're caught up with people who are
[23:53] looking at you people who are
[23:55] criticizing saying this is saying when
[23:57] you become
[23:58] one that the holy spirit controls
[24:01] and christ lives through you then
[24:05] you don't worry about anything because
[24:07] you know
[24:09] it is not i but it is the lord
[24:12] amen lord of god but i want you to know
[24:16] after the great battle rahab
[24:20] met one of the israelite generals
[24:24] and his name my friends
[24:27] she married him
[24:30] and they had a son now you remember you
[24:34] realize that
[24:35] an israelite general was like a prince
[24:38] of
[24:38] israel and god allowed her
[24:43] a gentile to marry
[24:46] this israelite general and she had a
[24:50] son by him and his name
[24:54] was salman salman
[24:57] now this salmon according to
[25:00] scripture and history was
[25:04] the founder of the city
[25:08] of bethlehem and so
[25:14] he was also the
[25:19] father of boaz who became the
[25:24] husband of ruth now there's a pattern
[25:28] there how that god is consistently
[25:31] using gentiles working through
[25:35] gentiles and we see the figure
[25:39] of a woman which types the church
[25:42] rehab sarah rehab
[25:45] ruth god showing gentiles
[25:49] praise god foreshadowing that
[25:52] salvation would come and be
[25:57] sent out to the world spread out
[26:00] evangelize
[26:01] and gentiles will be the ones
[26:05] that will be used to do it already
[26:08] foreshadowed here in
[26:11] the word of god
[26:15] hallelujah my friends
[26:18] we find out that
[26:21] bethlehem was one of the smallest cities
[26:26] and the scripture reads
[26:29] of bethlehem of judea
[26:32] art thou the least amongst all the
[26:35] princes
[26:37] of the cities of judea
[26:40] oh praise god but out of thee shall come
[26:44] the governor that shall rule
[26:48] my people out of this little
[26:51] despised rejected city
[26:54] of bethlehem would come
[26:57] the governor that will rule my people
[27:01] which of course is jesus christ oh
[27:04] praise
[27:05] god so god used a rejected city
[27:10] to have jesus christ come on the scene
[27:14] then we see later how
[27:18] david when there had to be a choosing
[27:21] for david
[27:23] and samuel went up there and all the
[27:26] brothers came
[27:27] many of them tall and burly handsome
[27:30] striking looking men and there
[27:34] this great uh one went there and he said
[27:38] none of these don't you have another one
[27:41] say oh there's another one but he's out
[27:43] in the field
[27:44] he's just a shepherd he just looks after
[27:47] the sheep
[27:48] and samuel said no go bring him
[27:51] and you see my friends david
[27:55] despised rejected
[27:58] overlooked and yet he
[28:02] was the one that god choose to use
[28:06] to be his anointed one and to be
[28:09] king of israel even though he was
[28:13] overlooked by man he was not
[28:16] overlooked by god oh thank god
[28:20] friends hallelujah amen
[28:23] god always love the rejected
[28:28] you may be rejected for for all i know
[28:32] god loves to pick up family rejects
[28:36] god loves to help and to pick up
[28:40] people that are rejected by society
[28:45] god loves people that are rejected
[28:49] by their very own family he loves

[32:37] in book of psalms chapter 42 verses one
[32:40] two
[32:41] two david speaking as the heart
[32:45] searched it for the water brook
[32:48] so my soul searched it after thee
[32:53] oh god i think
[32:57] david is a great hunter
[33:02] i think that he was a great hunter
[33:05] and watching the movement of the animals
[33:10] he had a lot of meaning behind those
[33:13] words
[33:14] i repeat them as the heart or
[33:17] deer as we know it dear
[33:21] but as the heart thirsted for the water
[33:24] brook
[33:26] so my soul searched that
[33:29] after thee oh god
[33:33] our everlasting thirst that
[33:36] god has placed within our hearts and
[33:39] we as believers and as human beings
[33:43] whether sinner or saint god has placed
[33:46] the
[33:46] thirst in there where we will thirst for
[33:50] him
[33:50] until we find satisfaction
[33:53] in him and in his presence it is
[33:56] not eternal it is everlasting
[34:00] for when we were in him we didn't have
[34:03] to thirst for him
[34:04] but away from him in this earth's
[34:07] uh journey we search after the living
[34:11] god and the presence of the living god
[34:14] whom we
[34:14] love and serve with all our hearts
[34:17] praise
[34:17] god hallelujah brother sister
[34:20] so david being a hunter
[34:24] and out there brother sister hunting
[34:29] you know what he was referring to
[34:32] is that when you're hunting gear
[34:36] and the deer gets wounded
[34:40] and the homes the dogs
[34:44] start running chasing the deer and the
[34:48] deer goes running the deer goes
[34:51] running as fast as it can jumping
[34:53] everywhere
[34:54] because it's wounded but because it's
[34:58] wounded
[34:58] and the blood is flowing up only by
[35:01] drinking
[35:02] water will it be able to sustain its
[35:06] life to be able to escape so
[35:09] as the deer panted after the water broke
[35:14] so my soul task thrusted after thee
[35:17] so if that deer doesn't get to water
[35:20] to drink it will die it will
[35:23] thirst it will get tired and weak and
[35:26] fall
[35:27] by the wayside and this is what david

[54:24] listening to me now to get it and let
[54:27] the holy spirit
[54:28] open up his word to their hearts and to
[54:32] their lives
[54:34] my friends as i begin to wind down
[54:39] i want to let you know that here
[54:42] in canada this is a nation
[54:47] that has an animal called a beaver
[54:52] and i found
[54:56] some news that came in
[54:59] saying beavers chew through
[55:02] a cable and knock out
[55:06] internet service to hundreds and
[55:09] hundreds
[55:10] in a canadian town
[55:14] and this was on cnn
[55:17] they not through the cable first in
[55:20] several places
[55:22] it was buried three feet on the ground
[55:25] and was protected by a
[55:29] 4.5 inch thick conduit
[55:33] was protecting the cable but they chewed
[55:36] through
[55:36] all of it and you may not be able to see
[55:39] it clearly
[55:40] but here is the article from
[55:43] cnn detailing this how
[55:47] this communications problem telephone
[55:51] tv internet everything
[55:54] was clean cleared shut down
[55:57] completely well you know
[56:00] we got a lot of beavers here in canada
[56:04] i believe there's a lot of beavers all
[56:06] around the world
[56:08] because beavers have a way of putting a
[56:12] log across the river or logs
[56:14] blocking up the water to stop it from
[56:17] flowing
[56:19] and they'll they'll put leaves and mud
[56:21] and twigs and everything else
[56:23] until they can block off that water
[56:26] the channel in that water and the water
[56:29] gets
[56:30] backed up and that's what we call a
[56:33] beaver
[56:33] dam the beaver builds a
[56:37] earthen and wooden dam across
[56:40] a river and blocks it up
[56:44] completely amen and i believe
[56:47] the denominations of this world today
[56:50] are very much
[56:51] like a beavers they build dams to keep
[56:55] their members in
[56:57] they build dams to keep the truth out
[57:00] they keep building dams and we have a
[57:03] lot of beaver preachers
[57:05] also damn up all the fresh water
[57:09] of the word of god away from the people
[57:13] amen keep them away from the
[57:17] open word the truth and the fresh waters
[57:21] of the word of god hallelujah and
[57:23] they'll say oh
[57:25] this water over here is ours and this
[57:28] water here
[57:29] is is is back this water pentecostal
[57:31] water is this water it's that water it's
[57:33] the other water
[57:34] there's only one rail genuine water
[57:38] that's not stagnated
[57:40] and that is the revealed word of
[57:43] god for the hour hallelujah we
[57:46] don't want water from organizations
[57:50] because they have stagnated cistern
[57:53] water that we have all kinds of tadpoles
[57:57] and
[57:57] tails in it every and every possible way
[58:00] amen as i said before when you get
[58:03] stagnated water
[58:06] then you start getting tadpoles
[58:09] you start getting all kinds of wiggle
[58:11] tails in it
[58:13] and the church begins to wiggle and
[58:15] waggle and and slip and slide and
[58:18] and dance and move this way and they're
[58:21] changing constantly
[58:22] constantly like that that's the matter
[58:25] with the church
[58:26] today they have a little wiggle here a
[58:28] little waggle there
[58:30] little twists here a little turn over
[58:32] there
[58:33] amen this is all oh they hear this kind
[58:36] of a preaching
[58:37] oh there's nothing to that there's
[58:40] nothing to it
[58:41] there is no such a thing as one god
[58:45] all the churches most believe in tree
[58:49] gods the trinitarian doctrine
[58:52] there is not nothing to that water
[58:54] baptism they're telling you about
[58:56] there is nothing to that opening of the
[58:59] seven seals
[59:00] there is nothing to them seven angels
[59:03] that were in the heavens going back
[59:05] and their form was taken out in the
[59:09] in the as the face of jesus christ
[59:12] typical of the pin
[59:13] that i'm wearing here at this particular
[59:16] time but friends
[59:17] it actually happened
[59:20] but they will wiggle here and waggle
[59:22] there and tell you
[59:24] that it's not the case and don't you
[59:26] worry about them
[59:28] don't you believe them they're talking
[59:31] about this and talking about that
[59:33] oh there is nothing to that serpent seed
[59:36] there is nothing to that
[59:37] eve of going with this serpent you see
[59:40] they're thinking a serpent is a snake
[59:42] like we see it today
[59:43] but back in the bible it says he was
[59:46] intelligent he was wise
[59:47] he was standing upright and then he was
[59:49] cursed then put on his belly and from
[59:52] this day
[59:53] you're going to waggle and wiggle like a
[59:55] snake and that's what we find the spear
[59:57] the serpent spirit
[59:59] that's moving within these denominations
[1:00:03] everywhere my friends and my goodness
[1:00:06] they're drinking stagnated water
[1:00:09] from some beaver dam that they're
[1:00:12] getting
