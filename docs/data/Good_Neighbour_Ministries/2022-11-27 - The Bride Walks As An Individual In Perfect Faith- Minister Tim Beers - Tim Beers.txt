come forth you may be seated [Music] amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning good to be together again amen amen expecting great things from the Lord I don't know but I believe the Bride of Jesus Christ comes to expect from him not anybody else because there's this thing can't be touched that is being developed matured In You by man's hands it's only the Holy Ghost God himself had to come in this last day and age and complete that work amen and that work that has started inside of you is only him that can complete it hey man it's good to be in the house of the Lord it's been a while since I've been up here so I'm just going to preach this morning you know you know what preaching is just here there everywhere see what the Lord will do kind of leaving myself open to see what the spirit of God will do amen and what he'll speak Hallelujah it's uh let's remember our pastor sister Pam brother Bill that are going to Israel let us remember brother coffee he's ministering this morning in Africa right we we welcome back brother Desmond I was walking by the office there and I heard the voice that's a voice a voice of joy amen so we're glad that the Lord brought him back safely and we know that God fulfilled his will in bringing him there and bringing him back to us let us stand this morning as we get into the word of God I have a title here this morning it's called The Bride walks as an individual in perfect faith but I got a subject this morning that is even burning on my heart is that God is a reality God is real amen God is a reality and God is real and I know one group of people that God is a reality and God is real to them and that's what we call the Bride of Jesus Christ a selected group so let's get into the word this morning and see what God will reveal to us amen amen you know we don't come expecting from man you know when the children of Israel gather together you know around the Tabernacle they knew that the pillar of fire was going to come down at certain times and visit them that's why they lived around the Tabernacle that's why they they they urged in hunger to go in to the presence of God because they knew the pillar of fire was going to be there I wonder if we had that kind of expectation this morning that when we come together in a what we call a building that the same Pillar of Fire would come I wonder what it would do to your hearts because we know when the pillar of fire comes what he does that only God can do we come with the same expectation this morning he will reveal himself to you he will make himself known to you but if you come just with your Dead traditions rituals that's another Sunday we're coming to church I'm a message believer so I gotta go to church I gotta that's dead that's dead and the Bride of Jesus Christ don't walk there she's come this morning to see to catch to experience the reality of God and he's here this morning he said where two or three are gathered together in my name I will be in the midst Matthew 16 13. let us read the reality of God when Jesus came into the coast of Sierra and Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said unto him some say that thou are John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets he said unto them but who say ye that I am and Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God something had to be made real to him for him to answer that way because everybody else was trying to guess who he was trying to understand who he was but God made himself real to Peter so he can say those words you know your words that you speak your testimony that you Proclaim shows the age that you're living in whether you're living in the seventh Church age or you're living in the Eternal age Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art Dell Simon barjorna for Flesh and Blood had not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven and I say unto thee Thou Art Peter and of and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and I give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever thou shall bind on Earth Thou shalt be back that shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven that's reality that to a True Believer is real in your life In your experience in your walk if this doesn't become real to you a revelation to you so that you can take the word of God you will not continue to walk in this battle and in this fight and overcome in this hour the only thing that's going to stand as we get closer to the end and wickedness gets more wicked and more Darkness gross darkness is that that word has to become real in your life amen real Matthew 13 11. he answered and said unto them because it is given to you to know the Mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven but it's not given to them for whosoever had to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever had not from him shall be taken away even that he had therefore speak I to them in parables because seeing see not and herein they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the of the prophecy of Elias which said by hearing you shall hear and shall not understand and sin you shall see and not and shall not perceive for this people's hearts are wax gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have clothes less at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with the ears and should understand with their hearts and should be converted and I should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for verily I say unto you meant that many prophets and righteous men have desire to see those things which ye see and have seen them not and to hear those things which you hear and hear them not wow let's pray father thank you for your word this morning we just commit ourselves into your hands both speaker and hearer Lord we commit brother coffee in Africa to you all the ministers that are preaching the word of God this morning to the Bride of Jesus Christ we commit to you what else can we do father but surrender into your hands O God May the spirit of God have its way this morning in our hearts and may your word go forth in power and demonstration it's not by might it's not by power but by your spirit father let your spirit speak to your people this morning and make yourself a reality and more real than you ever been in our lives because that's our hunger and that's our thirst father we hunger and thirst for the Living God oh Grant these things this morning that only you can do father wash Us in the precious blood father let every sin be place in the precious blood this morning and let every flesh be placed behind the cross Lord hide my flesh behind the cross this morning in Jesus name we pray you may be seated wow the things many prophets and righteous men desired to see and hear but here we are in the last days receiving those things those great things I believe the Bride of Jesus Christ knows when she reads the scripture she knows that she knows that she's receiving things that those prophets and righteous man desire to see and to look into she has an understanding this morning of what she's receiving what she's feeding on and what she is walking daily with him it's a reality to her this walk and John 3 1. it says there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came by night to Jesus saying Rabbi we know that thou art teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him Jesus answers and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God I believe that's the problem that the message has not leading people to a new birth leading him to a religion something that can Comfort them and not lead into a real change not exposing sin here was the prophet in the last days hitting the denomination saying you're not exposing sin in the people and the way that they live and act and here it is come all the way around again my brothers and sisters history always repeats itself it says things always repeat itself again because what was fulfilled back there got to be fulfilled today again where where where did the where did it change where did that entering into the kingdom of God change where did it we're seeing these things in the kingdom of God changed man changes things all the time man tries to interpret things all the time and put their own interpretation on it but this word has and needs no man's interpretation it is what it is and it says Jesus himself you must be born again you can't fall short of it you can't accept anything else you wonder why you're not growing you wonder why you're not you know you're you're getting dead and dull and and stale lukewarm lazy powerless check to see if you've been born somebody who hasn't been born is dead Nicodemus said unto him now these are people that the cardinal carnal believer that interprets the word this way how can a man be born when he's old can he enter the second time in his mother's womb and be born you know these are just words but if you spiritually discern what the the spirit is saying there the person the experience that is saying there the carnal impersonation the Cardinal interpretation there you'll see where they're at it's no different today people are saying the same thing about this message this word how can it be how can this Christ be how can I be born again how can this word and I become one and the same well you're going to interpret that way you're going to look at the scriptures you're going to look at the preaching and not the message and things that are coming forth if you're not born again because you're not seeing the kingdom but those who are seeing and are born again they know what Jesus meant when he said you will know in that day that I in the Father the father and me I and you and you and me and we are one in the same yes they know that they understand that they see that it's a reality to them they're experiencing it that because they can see and understand the kingdom of God within them the kingdom of God Has Come the kingdom of God is here it's amongst men it's in men and women this morning that are born again that's what this is all about that's what perfect faith is all about that's what the Rapture in faith is all about that's why we're here to fulfill in this hour is all about there's no other age there's nothing else coming but that that is the coming of the Lord that which is born of flesh is flesh that which is born of the spirit of spirit Marvel not that I say unto thee you must be born again the wind bloweth where it listed and thou hears the sound thereof but can us not tell when succumbeth or whether it is or goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit of God I'm just preaching the letter you have it's between the spirit and you to understand hello there is nothing a man can do to make you understand or make you see this Kingdom that is here this morning we are living in such a day of confusion living in a day when men and women hardly know what to do everything seems to be in turmoil everything seems to be in so many different ways and so many different directions listen to my brothers and sisters I'm not going to preach to the world out there I'm not going to preach to the denominations out there I'm going to preach to the message here that's who I'm preaching to they are fulfilling their part they're we're way beyond that why because we're any better no is because God has purpose in his heart and position us into a position and a place and something to fulfill and we must fulfill that purpose of God every man and woman of God in the scriptures that has been given amen a position in in the word of God had to come to that place of surrender to fulfill that position amen Hallelujah recognize your day in this message they want a Great Awakening they're crying and believing that there will be an Awakening they're good people why is it what have they done they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride by being a Christian they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what has been done what has been done you tell me that you have to be primed I'm just going to speak playing this morning you tell me you have to be primed you have to be pampered in this hour under the ministry that we're under and we have been under listen I've been under this ministry for 32 years listen I'm not sitting here like a little baby this morning I'm not sitting here like a little weakling this morning I've been growing and matured which I believe under a supernatural word of God in this hour as about time I stand to take my position and who I am and what God has called me to do and anointed me to do not looking for any individual anybody even my own Pastor to pamper me I gotta be mature grown up in this word because I recognize what has been done I recognize that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that's not a scene on the wall there that's not the dead letter to me it's a reality to me it's real to me because he's real to me every day of my life he's real he's real every thought that runs through my mind goes through a filter an unconscious Holy Ghost filter well yeah there's flesh is that enmity this carnal Minds that enmity with God this flesh don't want to serve God this flesh is lazy but let me tell you there's something greater than this flesh inside here it's called an attribute of God it's called The Seed of God it's called the life of God and every time the enemy comes in as a flood and he will God raises a standard he makes the word that's inside of me more real amen so I could press on and I can move on I'm here this morning because of that every Minister that comes up here you don't know what we go through and you don't need to if you're not called to but the pressures you look oh brother Simon you know he preaches Wednesday or Sunday and all week he's doing that yeah yeah you know I was off for a long time with my back and that stuff being at home I wasn't working to do nothing but let me tell you those unseen uh pressures and those unseen battles don't go away they're there just to break into the presence of God Amen the priests go into that Tabernacle they had to go behind that where the pillar of fire was to stand in the presence of that Pillar of Fire you think that's easy you you don't even understand the challenges that that that is brought before a minister that he has to face just to get to a place to stand here what is it going to be on that day those who come those who come and criticize in your mind the preaching the person that's preaching the weaknesses what is going to be like on that day when the sacrifice was laid before you the sacrifice was given to you the sacrifice is here this morning for you to receive something so you can overcome you can be healed you can be delivered you can be set free that's here every born-again Christian has a road set before them you've got to follow that road God marks it out by faith it's marked by the blood what is the blood the blood is the life and the spirit always lives in the blood because through the blood comes life that's the blood cell in the seven Church age the message is then broadcast to all but through it it is broadcast to all who come within range of the message that message is received individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way every individual of that group is one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by the way of the messenger those who hear are not getting their own private Revelation nor is it a group getting their Collective Revelation but each person is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from God do we understand that amen he was the wave sheep he was our example in this hour he walked with God as Enoch walked with God he walked in a life separated to God a life of perfect faith an example for the Bride of Jesus Christ that those bloody Footprints we would walk into now I'm not talking about being the messenger the prophet but I'm talking about the life there was the ministry and then there was the life there was a separation between both of them and they were both one and the same but our calling our our gift that God has given us there comes a life a consecration a surrender that we need so that they can match up and they can go together and without it you're missing pieces of the puzzle you're not collectively putting the gas and the spark together to unite in your walk into your experience with God Enoch walk with God and by faith he pleased God and only Faith pleases God and when these two come together in your life that's when you please God you'll know you will know when you are pleasing God there is an atmosphere I can't explain it in words but there's an atmosphere there's a move of God around your life in your heart in your mind when you're obeying and surrender to the Lord there's a there's a there's a the spirit of the Lord gives Liberty and freedom there's a peace around you when everything is in turmoil when everything's falling apart around you you have a piece of that that mind can understand man can't understand that's when you're pleasing God and I'm not talking about you making mistakes you know we we jump back and forth to our flesh into this and we justify we you know we contradict both of them we make excuses for both of them that's not what I'm talking about I'm not talking about your flesh this morning I'm not talking about your Cardinal mind this morning I'm talking to the soul I'm talking to the attribute I'm talking to the spirit that's inside of you the word of God amen Hallelujah glory to God you can say Amen it's okay I'm going to preach anyways I'm I'm I'm growing up enough though if nobody says anything I'm just going to say what I say but if you want to say Amen go ahead and I'm not like my brother Brad says so many times I get that runs through my mind I'm not angry right just the way I I am this is the way I preach it when God become this is the way God makes himself real to me [Music] I I just as much as you want the realities of God and God to be more real to me that was my prayer well I'm up here God be real to me more and more Hallelujah amen the seals are open the Mysteries are revealing is self to the bride perfect faith is here perfect faith is not coming perfect faith is here that struck me because you know as a preacher you got to learn and grow in the word and I always you know you got to get perfect Faith you got to grow in and mature into perfect faith but see perfect faith is already here the faith that was delivered to us in this hour is perfect it's perfect faith the thing is you've got to come to realize and grow into that perfect faith but then brother Brown said that perfect Faith Rapture and faith lies in the tapes well what do you what do you mean by that not just you didn't mean take Ministry only he meant the revelation the shields that have been broken by the lamb who took the book amen and opened up the seals amen is here it's open it's done it's released it's available to us is available to you this morning why come and leave empty why come is there not a bomb in Gilead is there not a God here is not the word of God real not the word of God in reality doesn't he not fulfill his promises still can his word fail can he fail oh my God this is the bride's reality in her individual walk with God the bride walks in a world of perfect understanding of who he is she understands the realities of God when Jesus said in that day you will know that I'm in the Father the father me I in you she understands how Jesus and the father are one because she in the word are one you know you you see how important that the understanding of God and Jesus Christ are one in the same you know there's still people in this message that don't understand that and if you don't see that by faith you can't see how God amorphied himself down Elohim coming down through Melchizedek coming into flesh and being God manifested in flesh you cannot see the same process that's taken place in your flesh it's very important and we take all these things I don't need to understand this I don't need to understand that you need to understand because they are blueprints they are blueprints to what God will be doing and is doing in you so that when you come to understand remember brother Brown said these things I'm going to quote a lot of stuff say a lot of stuff when he said these things he said when a bride recognizes who she is she's going to be invincible oh there's going to be a power an anointing an understanding around her life she's going to know what to do with the word that God placed inside of her life that's what's going to manifest that is that's what's manifested now but there's a greater move there's a greater thing that is coming amongst the Bride of Jesus Christ God has secretly been molding her shaping her you think nothing's been going on oh you come to church this brother comes to church he comes to church and oh we all leave the same we all go to dinner we all go and have this fellowship and that stuff but God has been working secretly in the bride in certain individuals he's been molding her shaping her and building her and developing something in her that he is getting ready to manifest in this hour thank you Jesus that's why desperation is amongst the Bride of Jesus Christ all the time oh God where are you what are you doing speak to my heart show me yourself because there's an hour there's a time that's coming right now upon the Earth where she's going to be moving into a manifestation and if you're not there you're not there you're only going to be watching it and there's going to be a a a thing that's going to come and understand it it's going to come to you because you're left behind well I know this is not positive preaching uplifting preaching but it's the truth it's up to you as individuals it's up to you and your consciousness to stop if something is real in your heart and talking to you stop playing Church stop playing religion and get real with God when you get real with him he'll get real with you secret catching away is happening now you think that this is it you think that this is all of it no my brothers and sisters this is just winding up this is building a momentum and growing are you in that momentum are you growing in that momentum of Faith a a perfect faith in this hour are you seeing yourself are you understanding the kingdom of God that's inside of you you've been given eyes to see ears to hear it's not for me to judge it's not for no man to judge here I'm not here to judge I'm here to speak the truth and this is the truth in this hour this is what's happening Hallelujah perfect faith means for the laity every individual walks in a world with God alone you stand alone you walk alone you battle alone you overcome alone with God I thank you for my your prayers because your faith the Bible says by your faith and your prayers it's helped delivered me it's helped heal me but in reality I gotta face everything I have to face in my life alone with God as long as God is here and with me I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me I can overcome every challenge that is faced before me challenge I can walk unconsciously of fear who's speaking the attribute is speaking God is speaking you can walk unconsciously of fear when you're walking with God Enoch walked with God he walks so close to God he understood so much of God the word understood so much of himself God says you know what you can't stay here anymore there's no challenges for you here anymore there's nothing for you to overcome down here anymore while the bride's coming to that same place you know what you are fulfilled you have completed you have finished your course you have run your race that's why people are going home don't get puzzled why people are going home and the way that they go home the way that they exit they're going home because it's home time people are finishing their course and they're and they're and their race and they're going home you know what they're very happy that they're home oh happy ain't the word that they finish in their home and here we are here we are still November 27 2022 and we're here this morning what does that tell you it tells you that there's a possibility that you might not taste death that's what it says to me Lord I'm still here I'm still running the range they still have a desire I still have a hunger and thirst I still feel a pull of my heart I still feel the word inside of me is still gonna still gonna develop and grow a little bit more and manifest the challenges that are coming upon the Earth and that are here upon the Earth this Faith that's placed inside of us is going to challenge that it's going to overcome that it's going to meet the devil face to face in this hour that's when playing church and playing message and all that's over it's done then whether you have it other you know or you don't know in that hour if you're still confused you're still guessing you're still the hour I don't know when that door is going to close but that door is closing fast oh brother Tim you don't know fast something in the spirit tells the Bride of Jesus Christ right doesn't these cells show you things to come you might not know the hour or the day or the time but the year go look in the scriptures the year you'll know you know wow you see what's prophesied out there we know we have a we know what we believe but amsterdamus prophesied for 2023 what they're saying about 2023 wow all right wow what do you say what do you say s basically you want to put well I want me to put in my own words Rapture time Glory going home time you're baptized into the kingdom there's nobody in there but you and God he gives the orders you pack them out whatever he says there's not a Shadow of Doubt nowhere you walk right on if the Lord says this there's nobody in the world that can talk you out of it you just go right on the same you're coming into perfect Faith perfect Perfection and that cannot fail that never fails you see he was a Mystic to them with his perfect faith and so it is now to those who have those who have perfect faith are Mystics to others remember what I said in the beginning keep your spiritual Minds on I'm not talking to them out there talking to the message I'm talking in the message this is what's going to happen here this is the word of God today for this day for our day Hallelujah my brothers and sisters we see this battle that has taken place we understand that in order to overcome our flesh we need the faith of Who We Are we need to understand these things that we're going through because each and every one of us are individuals and our challenges our battles are different they're unique they're designed differently you can't look at the way I battle or this brother or this sister battles because your challenges are unique your battles are unique that's why you and only you yourself has got to go in in behind the veil the Shekinah Glory with God and when you go behind there and the curtain shuts behind you then there is the voice of God the still Small Voice that speaks to you directly and gives you a word gives you a Direction gives you an inspiration gives you a faith that you need to meet that challenge because we got to face one challenge after another challenge after it is not going to stop my brothers and sisters this battle is not going to stop this testing is not going to stop it's not going to stop until we finally reached our last one [Applause] and when that last one is completed in the bride only God knows that's gonna unite or Unite trigger off amen trigger off like the cross triggered off so many prophecies being fulfilled that's going to trigger off God knows when that's going to trigger off we say when the last one comes in comes into what comes into what it's true but what is she coming into Romans 7. but I see another law in my members warned against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my member oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from this body of this death I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so when with this mind I myself serve the law of God but with this flesh the law of sin we need to surrender the human part now listen to this this blessed my soul when I came across this we need to surrender the human part to the god part we've been talking about the two parts mostly the god part that's the one I like to talk about the most so God's word can interpret the portion of the word of faith in us because entering behind the inner veil by the third pull which is the revealing of the word in to the individual cannot be carnally impersonated my egg but there's so much of that going on today so much self-righteousness so much self-works and all these things watch are you going to see here as we we keep going down people are trying to live and act or dress and talk like the prophet or someone who is living in the third pole manifestation of perfect faith it's an individual affair the husband cannot give it to the wife wives the life cannot give it to the husband the parents cannot give it to the children which a lot of people believe that it's an individual Affair the word of God says you you individually must be born again it period thank you somebody's with me here Hallelujah it must be revealed to him to you personally because the secrets are Unwritten it's the unwritten word like Paul said I was caught up into the heavens I seen and heard things I cannot utter with human voice or understanding that cannot be uttered this morning every morning every time you come it cannot be uttered by human voice or understanding when you leave here you're going to leave here with something that he gave you not what I gave you because if you leave here only what I gave you you're in trouble because you're going to forget it and you're going to go back to your doll lazy lukewarm life that's what's going to happen no victory that what it was it was revealed to the bride when she enters into the king's chamber where the Shekinah Glory is and the world is shut out and your heart and mind and the only voice that the bride hears is the voice of her husband whisper and secrets of love to her all day long what does Jesus say I'll take one and I'll leave him what do you say what did he say uh in the bed in the marriage bed is that what it means I don't know I'll take one I'll leave one in the field where you work in the church I'll take one I'll leave one listen my brothers and sisters don't look to the left don't look to the right don't look at personalities don't look at family don't look at relationships stop it look to Jesus get focused on him not caught up in personalities and caught up in in this person's faith and that person's faith and what they're doing in God and what they're fulfilling in God know who you are know where you stand I don't care how old you are I don't care how old you are Mary when she received the message the Revelation from the angel was a teenager I don't care how old you are how young you are this is real this is reality this is what the word and what God is doing in this hour he is separating the attribute he is separating the attribute from All Flesh her flesh All Flesh I don't want your flesh you know what I mean by that some of you do I don't want your flesh I don't want I don't want you know you like me I'm happy I'm happy you like me I'm happy that you know but you don't I'm happy I'm still happy because I'm separated from your flight you don't like the way and what I like to eat I'm happy if you do okay I'm happy I don't care it's all flesh your culture you're native your land your way you speak the way you're brought up your traditions It's All Flesh the attribute are separating from All Flesh if it's separating inside of me from my own flesh because I know the greatest I know the greatest enemies myself not you you're not my greatest enemy if you think that your brother and sister are still your problem yeah your Revelation got to tune in you know you know when they used to tune in the TV and tune in the channel tune in the picture you gotta tune in you're not your greatest enemy it's yourself [Music] I battle every day I wrestle every day I get up every day and every time I step under that bed I'm battling with myself you're not controlling me today you're not having dominion over me today the Lord God is and whether I I finish the day with you know losing a few battles and you know the flesh took a little Vantage on me or I got a little uh upset at my job or whatever that's okay that's okay that doesn't stumble me that doesn't make me all you know panicky and and flared up and stuff like that worry me no because I know that this thing shall not inherit the kingdom of God right this thing is definite shall pass away but the attribute inside of me is eternal brother Brown's speaking here the unfailing realities of the Living God now the holy spirit will not misbehave itself in one person and behave itself in another it makes each person come into its character remember what brother Brown said the only thing we take with us is character and that's what the Holy Spirit deals with is your character it's not your flesh that he's so much worried about it's your character the spirit that leads you it brings and makes you subject to its nature now listen you don't bring it subject to your nature how many times have we heard that and I believe that too we got to bring this flesh under subjection to the word we've all heard that bring it on we hear preaching bring it under subjection to the word preaching is delivered in certain ways to make you live by the law to do this to do that you've got to have standards you got to do this you got to do that take in the very element of Jesus Christ the holy ghost out of your life preachers not leading people to Christ leading them to their personalities leading to the law do you understand do you understand you don't bring a subject to your nature it makes you subject to its nature there's a difference there that the bride is understanding in this hour and she's being set free well I know I've been set free I can experience that this morning the difference between that I used to be under so much guilt so much condemnation some of you guys are still are under that that that level of maturity because you're trying to bring your nature subject to his nature but when he says I will bring your nature subject to my nature there's a difference there the difference is there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus Paul said it's not I that live and bring this nature subject to his nature but it's Christ that lives inside of me that does it amen so I'll stand back and watch and give him the the preeminence in my life to do that you understand okay Hallelujah watch oh how you love to give up the things of the world when the Holy Spirit comes in how it cleanses you how it washes you how it puts a desire in you to follow him searching hungering and pulling for the realities of God because God is a reality to you you do that no he does that he has done it in my life he's done it in some of your lives why are you here this morning while you're walking with God while you're hunger and thirsting for God there could be Never Enough of God how can people have enough how can people oh I read all the messages I listened to all the tapes I've heard every preacher in this message so what so what good for you oh good for you I'm happy for you that's not what it's all about the attribute separates from the flesh brother Simon preaching about that the seed of God separating not only from its own flesh but all flesh we are in a day of total Deliverance total separation and the faith that was once delivered to the Saints is now perfect in the bride look at Abraham I'm going to run through this quickly now look at Abraham a person and we are Abraham's seed separated person from the world when God called Abraham at 75 years old separate yourself from your Kindred from your from all unbelief come out into a world that you'll that that you never walked in before and amongst people that you have never known before I believe that's happened to me I believe that's happened to me come out and separate yourself from everybody that would be contrary to what you believe and that's the problem that's the problem with some people that God is a separator not man not you but I I still have a relationship with my my family my kindred friends out there but you know what the more reality and what's more real to me that I'm separated I'm like I'm standing in a room alone with a million people but I'm still alone with God I don't have to carnally impersonate or kindly interpret how to separate from anybody but the attribute separates me the art the spirit of God moves Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God so the spirit of God moves you in a Direction not you not your own interpretation your own mind your own thinking but the spirit moves you and when you're led by the spirit you can look back at your life and you can see a separation taking place and happening not by what you have done not by why decisions that you have made or things that you have said but the spirit of God has done it unconsciously has done it because you are walking listen you are walking with God the realities of God you're walking with this word my brothers and sisters you're you know what you're going to walk brother I'm seeing the bride walking like this that is what's happening now you're walking up how can you still think about it be walking with flesh when you're walking up my I you know what kind of like the human part of me have to apologize to you know what I'm saying here this morning because you don't understand it's could be really really a battle for you really a battle for you separating Hallelujah Abraham let's move on our battles are individually fought and are different in ways that we fight them perfect faith has to come you are designed to meet every challenge that you face the Lord will raise a standard against the unbelief that is challenging you in your position by making your walk and your part more real the reality of who you are and who he is so that you can overcome and keep fighting and walking in Victory that's what he'll do Satan is hiding in the light the bride is walking in the light but Satan is there hiding trying to to deceive her it would be so close you see can you imagine that and it's the truth look in the scriptures Satan transform himself into an angel of Light hiding in the light trying to deceive you trying to throw you off God's plan for your life and your path throw things in your way look at this life as a a a schooling ground a testing ground look at the people in your life and your family everything that's placed around you everybody who's come into your life as a purpose and when you look at it that way you'll start seeing what's leading you off the path I don't have to tell you you're running into this you're running into brick walls you're running into problems you run into all kinds of demons fighting against you it's order for you to find out the path that you're on if you're walking in that path and know so that you in the spirit of God can get together and he can reveal to you so you can stay walking then you'll know you don't need nobody to tell you brother you know what should I uh separate from this person should I not see this person should I those days are gone don't call me and ask me for that I know that maybe somebody else will will answer you but not me I'll say I'll pray let the Lord reveal it this is the hour brother where she knows who she is she knows what to do with the word Jesus Christ no matter if he was in a storm the way the waves were knocking the boat from side to side he was standing face to face with a mess of demons he never moved him he walked right on just as calm and as quiet as he could be why he was simply unconscious of fear or anything around him he didn't say oh I have to pray through ouch we're going to hit some hit some beliefs here wonder if I fast long enough wonder if I did this he just walked right on unconsciously he believed what God Said was the truth the words you see there's a difference here you know why you know why some people I'm gonna say it like I said I'm going to be saying in all the service you know why some people pray pray pray pray pray pray about this pray about this you got to pray about this you got to pray about this I'm not against praying you know that those who know me but it's because you don't believe it's because you don't believe I'm going to tell you the truth a lot of the prayers is because you don't believe because if you did believe Jesus walked unconsciously of fear he walked that way why because he knew and believed who he was and what God said about him if you know and believe who you are what God said about you then why cry in prayer speak the word speak the word you are met with a challenge whatever it might be speak the word and walk unconsciously of fear of that thing what do you got what do you got this morning in this that fears you your life is not in your hands the Lord gives the Lord takes whatever he wants and he'll give life when he wants death is in his hands death is swallowed up in Victory in him foreign so we fear death what do you got what material things you got what finances you got cars all these things that you fear that Satan threatens you what do you got that Satan threatens you that that brings you into that kind of fear lose it those who lose their life will gain it lose it Let It Go even to life Let It Go that's what he walked in he looked at the word he looked at his position he knew what the scripture said about him and that's what he walked in nothing else death look how he reacted to death oh so-and-so died so-and-so died he went over there and raised them up from the dead have no power death has no power over you no not if you're an attribute because you know that God that walked the Earth that I'm talking about here broke himself up and believe it or not that same God is inside of you [Music] so I want to come in contact with that reality more than anything I want to come subject and surrender to that portion of who I really am that's who I am oh Lord I recognize Who I Am Lord who I am I can see now just who I am I'm a part of my father I'm a part of my savior oh my God oh Lord Jesus help us all help brother Tim here this morning Lord thank you I'm I'm the chiefess when I'm when I'm under this anoint in this word I look at my heart is crying for the Holy Spirit more and more the words must be fulfilled in his life he knew that so he walked unconsciously of fear he walked unconsciously of criticism not paying attention to the right or to the left just keep moving just keep moving keep moving I don't care what goes on I can't predict what's going to go on next week whatever we hear our pastors is going into a retirement keep moving keep walking we have come into a maturity amen this is everything is happening for a reason and and a purpose and a time and a season because he knows I said he knows what's going on and he knows we're in a time of maturity no more pampering no more babysitting no more holding hands that's done you come in here with your maturity you come in here with your portion of Faith you come in here with your perfect faith knowing who you are and you stir things up you make things happen what God shows you when you come in here or you're at home and he reveals to you you speak it you you speak it and you expect it to happen what happened those days are not gone my brothers and sisters those days are not gone to the Bride of Jesus Christ when she sees the supernatural moving all the time confirming revealing oh my let me just try well I I must it must be uh there must be a pull here or something this morning I figure I'm going to be done in like a half an hour I haven't been up here in so long and I'm going to be pooped out I'm a little pooped out but amen I'm just having a good old time up here I'm sure a couple of you are having a good time too as individuals we must stand alone with Christ and meet that devil face to face and defeat him on every level oh yes and defeat him do you do you hear that on every level every level or you might you might you know when you're battling you might lose a battle here and there but you'll get back up but you'll win you'll win that war you will win it you will win it God deals with the Gentiles a people he called out the Gentiles his bride a people one here one there one over here he deals with us as individuals regardless of race color or Creed he deals with us as individuals that's the way he does it perfect Faith brings the bride into perfect confidence that's what she's got perfect reality perfect confidence perfect everything brother Brian says everything is perfect in her because everything is perfect in her and him nothing wavering nothing locked nothing falling short everything is perfect oh I believe that that's all I have to do is believe that I believe that attribute is hard of me that one who started to work inside of me the one who's keeping me is perfect favorite oh my because why the quickening powers in her oh yeah this message to her is the resurrection when this word comes alive in the bride for a perfect manifestation that quickening power makes her aware of all things shows her how to live above all her weaknesses all her struggles all circumstances oh I know personal revelation is the way we know for ourselves the most important truths of our existence that live in realities of God and God's purpose and directing for us personal revelation Hallelujah let me just try to close it off here with something here Hallelujah Hallelujah it's called The Musicians up the answer lies in the position of the key is not it is not in his hands is not worn around his neck it is not placed in the hands of another man or could it be he alone has the key he opens no man shuts he shuts no man opens he has that right Jesus himself isn't that right but where is the key it's on his shoulders but what does shoulders have to do with it read Isaiah 9 6 the government shall be upon his shoulders but what does those what does that mean the answer is in this phrase the government upon his shoulder comes from the wedding ceremony of the East when the bride has committed to the groom she takes off the veil and places it over the groom's shoulder signifying that not only is she under his Dominion she has transferred her rights to him I know this is just words but this is this is a reality to the bride it is this is a reality to the Bride of Jesus Christ she walks and lives this and experiences this every day that he is the head but also that he Bears the responsibility and the care and that he and he alone no one else no other man no other power has the right and responsibility but him oh that is so powerful and that that beloved is the Key of David God being Sovereign he foreknew by Divine degreed exactly who would be in his bride he chose her she did not choose him he called her to the ones who recognize that you are this this is powerful this is powerful because you did not Choose Yourself remember the scripture says many are called but few are chosen but you recognize in this hour by the word of God being manifested and come into a place of clarity perfect realization is coming through the word of God that he chose you you didn't choose him he called you he placed you he positionally placed you in him he washed her with his own blood he paid the price for her she belongs to him and him alone she is Holy committed to him and he accepts the obligation he is her head for Christ is the head of the his church as Sarah called Abraham Lord even so the bride is happy that he is Lord what is Lord what is Lord it's not just a word he is ruler over everything I know I have to come and I will come to a place where he will be fully Lord in my life because I can still see things you could still see things that that may put questions in your mind but see my faith inside of me what I've recognized my position in the word and my calling that he's called me I know that everything because it's in my heart it's the desire of my heart for everything to come under lordship to him and because of that right because what does it say in the Old Testament I'm trying to remember the scripture they and their faith was not made perfect without us but God counted for them for righteousness and counted them in while you're counted in when you come and recognize Who You Are and your position everything that the word of God says is counted in for you we we we say he looks through the blood the word the bleeding word that's all he sees in you only if you can see that you see that's What Makes You Different that's what's going to make you walk talk live that's what's going to create an atmosphere around you a presence around you it's not how much you study it's not how much you pray those things help but even greater than all that when you understand who you are that was the power that was around Jesus Christ the understanding of who he was what he was called for what he was positionally placed on the earth at that time what he needed to fulfill that's what created the power in him that's why demons were scared of him not because oh you can walk around you got great power in the name of Jesus Christ casts out that demon that's all man-made that's gone that is gone but when you walk with that confidence of who you are in him and that word living unconsciously around you that's what creates that atmosphere and that's what demons are scared of that is the light of God that is projecting through you darkness is leaving my friends the light is growing thy light is pushing out the darkness [Music] um Hallelujah God is a reality God is real and if you don't know him like Paul said I want to know him in the power of his resurrection the power of the reality of God the word he in the word are one of the power of the word in my life in your life my brothers and sisters [Music] I have this confidence in the word of God that all the father has called will come I'm not going to persuade you I'm not going to threaten you with hell or this or that [Music] because the truth and the reality is people will go to hell but the truth is there's a bride that God is the elected that will go to heaven foreign why Wonder [Music] when the reality is here the kingdom of God is here [Music] and all I can say is that the bride [Music] it's her life it's her everything she is sold out [Music] to
